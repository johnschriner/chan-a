[ If a man turns into a big titty anime woman, and you get a boner for the big titty anime woman, does that make you gay? Asking for a friend.  <br>You're getting a boner for the big titty anime woman, not the guy. So no.</br>  It's only gay if you don't stop fucking them when they turn back mid-fuck.  <br>It does if you're a girl.</br>  So what was this anime even about /a/? I'm genuinely curious. Did it have some amazing deeper meaning?  <br>Why don't you find it out for yourself?</br>  Autism and stuff  <br>Because I suck</br>  She had really cute toes.  <br>Darkest corner of the internet</br>  <br>Oh, sorry, I didn't notice your hands were already full...with something.<br><br>Kinda comfy, some cute girls, some autism, a little bit of drama, a little bit of mystery, and a little bit of uchuujin. <br><br> Ryuko a shit. </br></br></br></br></br>  Erio a cute!  <br>It's basically Sakurasou if Sakurasou was a harem, had aliens and rockets instead of art, and ends essentially the same way. Only it's way more painful because all the better girls lose, after a whole volume of "What-If" short stories about what life would be like if they had won.</br>  bootleg thread    I'm always curious about these things. For DVDs like that, is it actually a cartoon that's animated and colored, with actual voice acting and done to imitate whatever it's ripping off? Or do you just open the package and out comes a little pamphlet or something instead of a DVD and you just got ripped off.

Here’s the details: The book is called “Numbers” and was written by Victor Pelevin in 2004. It is a novel with no illustrations. This picture appears to be of a bootleg copy of the novel given a “unique” cover, but I can’t guarantee that as pictures of the novel without the Pokemon cover are scarce. All I could find was what appeared to be a book-on-tape version which had an abstract design for the cover instead.<br>Numbers has absolutely no relation to Pokemon whatsoever.<br>While this solves the mystery of the book’s origin, it opens countless more questions about the human mind.</br></br></br>  would you still love your waifu is she turned out like this?    <br>She still has a nice bum so it's all good.</br>  <br>You could probably just cut off her head and it would look great.</br>  more amazing russian literature  <br>I could never do that to the work of a 12 year old sweatshop workers 5 year old child.</br>  Not so much a bootleg but this Sailor Moon and DBZ discussion only reminds me of one thing.  <br>Just thinking about that shit makes me laugh.</br>  <br> 7 balls <br> 7 </br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128541663 <br>Do you see Banana Man<br>Hopping over on the white hot sand<br>Here he come with some for me<br>Freshly taken from banana tree<br>(1, 2, 3, 4)<br>Banana man, me want a ton<br>Give me double and a bonus one<br>Give me more for all me friends<br>Dis banana flow will never end<br><br>Do you want a banana?<br>Peel it down and go mm mm mm mmm<br>Do you want a banana?<br>Dis banana for you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't even know what to call this.  <br>I'm really confused.</br>  <br>You have a point there.<br><br>You could probably just do the same, you shittalking faglord.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that the dude from Friends in the background?</br>  <br>vaporwave</br>  <br>Do...Do they really sell that on the walmart website?</br>    <br>They got Rei down pat there.</br>  <br>They used to.

They do make copies of the AR-15 in limited amounts, for special forces training as well as export, as well as a number of copies of old classic guns for commercial export, such as the 1911 and the Winchester 1886, but all those patents have long since expired, and they're sold explicitly as modern replicas, so I wouldn't call them bootlegs.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=byE<wbr>IP9mRAwA</wbr>  [ ]<br>Here's a pretty good demonstration of what you'd call a Chinese 'bootleg' gun, from the 20's/30's.<br>It's basically a piece of shit, it mixes various elements from various famous guns, as well as featuring the trademarks and identifiers from various famous companies and manufacturers, proofmarks from various countries, sights that you can't actually use, marked with gibberish, etc. Typically these wouldn't be safe to even fire.<br><br>Hell, Communist China had their own thing with that. When the AK-47 was introduced, China bought the rights from the Russia to make their own for their army.<br><br>At some point though, relations cooled between Russia and China, they weren't very great friends anymore (Chairman Mao was buttmad that Russia was abandoning Stalinism, because Mao was a crazy asshole like that), so they couldn't really do deals with them anymore, it was known as the Sino Soviet Split, they went to war over it even.<br><br>Later, the AKM was developed (AK Modernized, if I'm allowed to simplify), which used a stamped steel body and a number of other improvements you see on basically all AK rifles today, China wanted to get on that, but they couldn't cut deals with Russia anymore, even if they wanted to, so they reversed engineered it and did their own variant of it. Russia was mad and tried to sue China, or something like that, claiming they used the design without paying, but China was all "lol fag".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  No one post Ranbu 1/3 and Kim piece yet?  <br>It's Ramba 1/3, you dumb fuck nigger</br>  <br>Except that's real, that is an actual book written by two spanish-speaking youtubers that do Minecraft lets-plays.

Only dumb animals care about raw sensory experiences.</br></br>  <br>Both.</br>  Story.<br>The only time I thought animation carried the show was Gunbuster and YZQ.<br>YZQ had a mediocre story though and Gunbuster's actual gunbuster scenes were nothing short of a masterpiece.</br></br>  Story.  <br>story. If I would care how it looks I would watch live action movies/series. They always look better/more realistic than anime.</br>  Good characters are most important, followed by story and world-building.<br><br>If you're adapting shit source material, you may as well prioritize good animation.<br><br>And if you can't do either, make the show purposefully bad to attract the garbage-eating ironic audience who buy shit like Ninja Slayer.</br></br></br></br>  overall? narrative ("story" sounds too linear).<br><br>for anime specifically? animation, after all the source material usually has a better story or at least more of it.</br></br>  <br> Good characters are most important, followed by story and world-building. <br>Sounds like the opposite of Nasu's priorities.</br></br>  Story 61% ≥ art 59%. the scale for drawing getting better curves a lot faster than someones ability to tell a story . Most artists find a nich though and just stick with a certain style anyway   very important <br>Artstyle <br>OST <br>Narrative<br>Characterization<br> not as important <br>Animation<br> ruins more anime than it helps <br>Character development</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No wonder his works are all shit.</br>  <br>well /a/'s definition of "character development" yeah.</br>  Animation is a deal breaker for me. I couldn't watch Bleach at all because of how autistic everything looks  <br>For me its "how characters change over the course of a story".<br>Heavy character development shows rarely have a likable character become an even more likable character. Its usually a likable character becoming unlikable or the opposite way around. I have no particular interest in seeing internal changes in characters as well. It turns me off a lot of anime.</br></br>  <br>For me it's "adding character to a character"<br><br>showing the character's fears, hopes, dreams, motivations, etc. You learn more about how a character works and operates and thus are more familiar with the character as if they were actual people instead of just some shallow plot device to run the story or some archetype. <br><br>When a character changes to a radically different character without much explanation or obtain traits that were completely contradictory to what the character had before, that's not character development, that's character derailment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the show is very whimsical in nature than the artstyle should reflect that. If the show it trying to be serious and realistic, than massive QUALITY will distract from that serious tone.</br>  <br>I always described that as characterization or "fleshing out".<br>But I do think that is very important. You connect more with fleshed out characters than cardboard ones.<br>I just generally see a lot of characters who are supposed to be unlikable at first and develop into someone you could like and you are supposed to connect with that change, or something.</br></br></br>  Well on the one hand you have glasslip with all into animation and none into story. On the other hans you have ping pong with all into story and none into animation. The choice is clear.  <br>The thing I like the most is when the character doesn't change, but your understanding of them changes as you learn more about them. I think that is what is closest to our own experiences of people.</br>  Animation<br><br>I wouldn't bother with hand-drawn moving pictures if it weren't for that.</br></br>  <br>Depends on what the director is going for.</br>  <br>what does this face is trying to convey</br>  Both can make or break a show. However story is more oft fucked up, so it has that going for it.<br><br><br>But we are all dumb animals, anon. Never underestimate the raw sensory experience.</br></br></br>  <br>Story. But there is a limit to how much QUALITY the viewers will allow. After all it's still anime, not a novel.</br>  Seiyuu.  <br>This</br>  <br>Oi-chan's happiness</br>  <br> Glasslip <br> good animation </br></br>  Story if you a nigger hipster piece of cancer<br><br>Animation because its fucking anime</br></br>  <br>This except with OST in not as important.</br>  <br>Story, is so fucking obviously</br>  <br>Story and characters, otherwise I wouldnt drop every single kyoani polished turd.</br>  <br>It's important, but story first.</br>  <br>That an actual inbetween shot or someone fucking with 60 fps, I can't tell.</br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br>Watch that scene.<br><br>Or, watch Shirobako.</br></br></br>  Books have no animation and are leaps and bounds more interesting and memorable than the average anime.<br><br>Story is objectively superior.</br></br>  <br> all these faggots saying story <br>Why the fuck would you even watch anime then?</br></br>  <br> tfw we never got to see Zuka get so desperate for work she had to resort to doing ecchi or full on hentai <br><br>Such a waste.</br></br></br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #5<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>  <br>Requesting Kukaku Shiba dressed as Frank Sinatra singing into an old 50's microphone.<br>Or anything is fine.<br>Thanks and have a nice weekend!</br></br></br>  <br>Requesting waifus in booty shorts</br>  Requesting Akame anything is fine!

Requesting Asuka playing an Axis version of a 1942 cabinet. Reference here http://a.uguu.se/mwtdqh.jpg If you plan on getting detailed with the actual game screen, make sure to switch out the Lockheed P38.<br><br>However, anything that is both cute and decent/tasteful is appreciated.

Requesting my love, Yuzuko wet from being out in the rain. I'm fine with mostly anything.  <br>Best you could get is probably the OR's ref picture<br/></br>  <br>I'll do this one</br>  Requesting Mei Hatsume! Here's a big list of request ideas:<br><br>-Reading a comicbook<br><br>-Making a superhero costume or fitting a hero costume around a mannequin<br><br>-Looking for her toolbox either in her room or in a workshop<br><br>-This one is probably really hard, but I want a picture that makes it look like she's inside the monitor, fixing the insides behind a shattered part of the background. And to make it look like there's a glass wall between the viewer and the inside<br><br>-Cleaning/doing maintenance on her goggles <br><br>-Doing/wearing anything steampunk related<br><br>-Anything with her in chibi form<br><br>Thanks for considering!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I took it in order to make the drawing.

Thanks to all you drawfriends out there, and lets all have a good day!  <br>I think it looks fine. Really Miura's original is a little derpy, no offense to OR.

Thank you.  Requesting Asui Tsuyu, anything really, however her tongue extends to 30 meters so I was thinking some shenanigans with that length would be fun to draw.  Independent of anonkyun's ongoing Pokemon requests, I'd like to request Vanilla handing a Snorunt a jelly doughnut while the Snorunt hands back an onigiri   all the newfriends have been scared off   Requesting Tsuruya please. Perhaps as a magical girl or idol.<br><br>Anything else is fine. Take it easy!</br></br>   yfw fire phoenix was reios zan   <br>I've posted this here a few times but if the enzymes of her Shikai heal, what if the enzymes of her Bankai was acidic and corroded. It would explain why both of them were melting and she raised them with Kido. It would also explain why Aizen didn't what to fight her seeing as her Bankai instantly transports you there. So his illusions would hold no bearing. Just a thought.</br>  What would have been different if Ichigo didn't make it in time and Rukia was successfully executed?<br>Would Aizen's plans go undetected and would he succeed?<br>Where would Ichigo's allegiance lie? Surely he wouldn't forgive Soul Society, would he join Aizen, the Fullbringers or the Quincies?</br></br>  <br>If Rukia was executed, Ichigo would lose all of his resolve, which means he loses a lot of power, which means he gets murdered by Byakuya in the Soul Society arc.</br>  <br>Wouldn't the hollow/zangetsu just take over instead?</br>  <br>If Bleach follows the same fate as Inuyasha, then it will be adapted into a 30 episode OVA one year after the manga finishes, which will probably take 4 years.</br>  Here it is, hot off the press. Leaking it here on /a/ a little bit earlier than it going up on Batoto because once it goes up on Batoto, I have to make a tumblr post and tumblr users have been fucking annoying this week in regards to the chapter so here's a reward for not being... well, that.<br><br>Anyway, this chapter was interesting. It's rare we get 3 whole plot chapters in a row. There's more Karera being adorably irresponsible, then we get some confirmation on a lot of info we kind of all already know, and then shit gets pretty fuckin real. So without further ado, enjoy. <br><br>(side note: If anyone is able and willing to do some cleaning work here and there, we'd really appreciate it. Email to ota.raws@gmail.com thank you for consideration)</br></br></br></br>              I'm pleasantly surprised that I didn't even have to come up with the profanity to use (instead of the stock anime insult "bastard") in this page. Good job Kewl          <br><br>Looking mighty Jotaro there Gappy.</br></br>                  <br>Looking pretty masculine in the top right panel there Karera.</br>        i guess this chapter might seem shorter than usual because tadaaaah it's all spreads  Wans't there a page about Karera getting burned in fire?    <br>dude spoilers</br>    I'm sort of getting tired of the fact that Gappy only has two facial expressions (mildly confused and mildly pissed off). Maybe he has too much Jotaro in him?    <br><br>She's pretty cute when drawn like a woman.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Goddamn. Araki never even drew this many spreads in a row during his shounen days. He must have spent more time than usual on this chapter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  whoops i'd forgotten to typeset this one. Sorry for the delay here  <br>There's been a few SBR chapters with lots of spreads, and I think some earlier chapters of this part like during born this way had lots of spreads</br>    Again, I've been wondering. Are you going to clean and typeset these chapters again when the tankobons come out?  <br>I think that's the least stylish series of attacks I've ever seen in Jojo. Still neat though.</br>  <br> the entire left side <br>I can see your underwear?</br></br>  <br><br>As strange as it may sound, it seems araki is experimenting with realism in this series, sometimes.</br></br>  <br>Reminds me of Westwood, except the JoJo here is built.</br>  <br>I really dunno if we'll get to these later ones... But actually, yeah we're about to release JoJolion 2.5 HD ReMix once Kewl gets back from Otakon</br>  So how crazy would the fights get if Araki saw Raid 1 and 2?  <br>Yeah that makes a lot of sense, there's something still charming about his weird designs having a really bland exchange. Good contrast to the other fights.</br>  <br>There's definitely a lot of experimenting going on in JJL compared to earlier arcs...</br>  <br>Damn, wires.<br><br><br>He's gonna retranslate the entire chapter from the tankobons?<br><br><br>Not much since he must have seen a lot of Jackie Chan and Jet Li already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand that's the end! Thanks for reading. This should be up on batoto by the end of the night. Just waiting for Kewl to get back to his hotel room and take of his Dainenjiyama cosplay and then upload everywhere  <br>Thank you for sharing.</br>  <br>Nice blog.</br>  <br>Well, keep in mind that fights in the Raid series are more like Araki's fights. Not the tactics part, but people taking stupidly high amounts of brutal damage and then stepping their game up anyways.</br>  <br> We're changing the order  <br><br>WHO ORDERED THEM TO DO THIS<br><br>JOBIN YOU FUCK ITS YOU ISNT IT <br><br>Jobin is the fucking main villain I know it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks over chapters and fixes translations that need adjustment (due to them either being old translations or because of future knowledge gained from mag chapters). No need to completely retranslate the chapters. Only thing that has to be redone is... *shudder* editing...<br><br>Here's some pages from v02 now. I don't wanna dump the whole thing until Kewl's had the chance to look over it but I can drop some of the title pages and stand info ones</br></br></br>  <br> people taking stupidly high amounts of brutal damage and then stepping their game up anyways <br>Like in a lot of anime and manga?</br></br>    Why is everyone so confused and lethargic  <br>Order as in the order they're killing (or attacking, whatever) them in. Karera was their first priority it seems, but now as he said they've changed the order to have Josuke be first. You idiot.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they meant the actual order of who they were going to attack. i.e. attacking Gappy first and Karera later.</br>    <br>No Gappy. Trying to expose your chest like Yasuho isn't normal.</br>    <br>Gappy looks extra creepy here</br>  I can't wait for this page to replace the version of the tile page where the Gomi scans people didn't  ERASE THAT STRAND OF MY HAIR THAT FELL ON THE SCANNER     <br> Kewl to get back to his hotel room and take of his Dainenjiyama cosplay <br><br>Are there pictures of him?</br></br></br>  oh yeah, we're gonna add in the artbook scan for this page I think as well.  <br>He posted a pic on his twitter (same as his name anywhere else) yesterday or two days ago</br>      <br>You must have had an easier time redrawing that than us redrawing this.</br>    <br>lol fuck part 5 redraws<br><br>I tried to help out with JJP on it but then I got to the Sex Pistols title pages and *fart*<br><br>Anyway that's all I have to dump from v02 right now but look forward to the full release soon.

I just keep H@H running and enjoy the rewards. Past that I'm lost.</br>  <br><br>Meh it's just luck of the draw, hoping a translators who cares about the work/artist/fetish happens to see your bounty. The higher the reward the better but mostly you rely on being lucky.<br><br>No one does whole tank translations for bounties, no matter how high the reward but I've had simple average length bounties sit untouched for ages even with high rewards.</br></br></br></br>  <br> oppai loli <br> trashman.jpg </br></br>  <br>Well yeah for tanks, but that isn't a tank, its just one relatively short chapter.</br>  <br>As a translator and editor, the rewards are *completely* meaningless to me. I don't buy anything with hath or GP or whatever. I don't see the point, honestly, though if I have hath I'll spend it on some perk that interests me to some degree. The only bounties I take are ones that I think are pretty hot and would have wanted to do anyway. <br><br>Also, no transparent bubbles, ever ever.</br></br></br>  <br> not using MS paint to crudely white out the transparent bubble and write the translation on it <br>its like you actually have standards.</br></br>  <br> No one does whole tank translations for bounties <br>http://g.e-hentai.org/bounty.php?bi<wbr>d=11432</wbr></br></br>  <br>So are you saying high hath rewards interest you?<br><br>Or not?<br><br>Either way, I get that bounties aren't important to most translators, but they do work sometimes, I think. Either way, its really the only means available to me until I start a new job at which point I could pay for translations I guess. But got so many untranslated things on the back burner already to commission.<br><br><br>Damn thats cheap for 160 pages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Been a while since I last checked bounties.<br><br>It surprises me someone really thinks anyone is going to pick up http://exhentai.org/g/706110/895744<wbr>30ed/ for translation. And it's even is a top translation bounty.</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> edgy </br>  <br> NTR all over the place <br> not edgy </br></br>  This thread had potential, and now I'm just back to fapping to traps and cucks. <br><br>Thanks again /a/</br></br>  <br>If they offer nothing but credits, I don't even register the bounty. Hath is all I look at, but even then, it doesn't matter too much. It's purely decided by "do I want to do this? is the work hot?" etc. Bounties are still better than nothing, though, because there's such a fucking hue quantity of un translated material and bounties are like lighthouses for pointing out certain gems.<br><br>Speaking of which, what kind of things do you want to commission? <br><br>I don't have standards but I translate on commission 90% of the time and doing sub optimal stuff like that makes me feel like a crook.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That pencil thin neck is fucking offputting</br>  <br> I don't have standards [...] doing sub optimal stuff like that makes me feel like a crook. <br>baka</br></br>  <br>Lots of things.

Which is harder these days because Wani, but whatever.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I don't have standards but I don't providing sub-par work for OTHER people.<br><br>When I do non-commission work I don't have standards. When I do commission work I give myself standards to follow so I don't feel bad about taking money. It's kind of like, I myself don't mind eating cheap and bad food, but if someone paid me to make food, I'd definitely try to make better stuff for them.</br></br></br>  <br>I love his cute and funny stuff, but I'll be damned if I can deal with his really dark stuff.</br>  Any manga with android banging chicks?  <br>Why does adding new works to one of my favorites categories when using thumbnail mode occasionally make recent existing added works completely ignore timestamp order? For example, yesterday when I added around 10 new tankoubons to the category, it caused the row above the one I was currently archive downloading to move 2 rows down. This row now has works all ranging from 2 hours to 7 days younger than the works on the row above it, which is completely retarded. I'm pretty sure I have missed entire rows of works while archiving because of this timestamping issue.</br>  <br>Sounds very odd. You're better off making a bug report to Tenboro.</br>    <br>where the fuck would you even get a little green dick</br>  <br>Anon, do you know what a dildo is?</br>  <br>LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT DICK! THAT ISN'T A DILDO. WHY WOULD SOMEONE MANUFACTURE SUCH A TINY PENIS?!? WHAT HAS BECOME OF HUMANITY?!?</br>  <br>but it's like 1 inch long<br>it has the girth of a normal mouse wire for christs sake</br></br>  <br><br>Gotta have'm in child size</br></br>  <br>Oh, I've had the same shit happen. I believe it's because galleries with "wide" thumbnails (as in their width &gt; height) can't be positioned normally with "tall" thumbnailed galleries, so they kinda go where they fit.<br>Look at these, my trap &amp; shota favorites, for example.</br></br>  <br><br> Keikoku no Elf <br><br>It's not fair to be that cute AND a boy</br></br></br></br>  <br> You're better off making a bug report to Tenboro. <br>I have no idea how to do that. Anyways, it seems to only be an issue on thumbnail display, where ALL of the works in the category are completely jumbled up in comparison to the timestamps of list display. You can test it out yourself if you'd like. I'll just stick to list display while archive downloading, since thumbnail display seems to be completely fucked.</br></br>  <br>Oh, that's terrible for archive downloading then. I wish I had known about this sooner then, so I wouldn't feel so paranoid about having potentially missed works while archiving.</br>  <br>Just PM him on the forums.

A nip wrote a a futa hentai manga, then comissioned the art for it for $3500 (I think). <br><br>Currently he has made around $2000 of it back in nip DLsite purchases, and $1 (read: one fucking dollar) back by selling it, untranslated, on an english DLsite. <br>He blames piracy for $4000 worth of lost revenue because he's retarded. <br>Most of the people say that he should try advertising on various futa communities before selling it, or translating it then selling it, or using another form of distribution so he can make more money per purchase.<br>One guy starts telling him why he's retarded in nipspeak (I can't read it, but that seems to be the gist of it) and is generally super cheeky about it.<br>Most of them also agree that the story was boring.<br>Nip gets mad and says he's going to use DRM in the future.

I feel kind of stupid for saying this, but I wish there was a tag for breast sizes in-between cowtits and washboard. I really like my breasts around a C-cup or D-cup but you can't tag anything bigger than maybe a medium B-cup as small without the DFCfags getting angry and you can't tag anything smaller than about an FF as large without the tittymonster fans getting equally outraged. Excluding both tags hurts more than it helps because of the relativity of the terms (hell, I've seen my favorite size range tagged as both) and also because doing so knocks out almost all works with more than one girl.<br><br>Anyone else feel my pain?</br></br>  <br>When it comes to hentai, unless it's specifically mentioned ("Ah fuck this 45 year old woman's J-cup titties!) then it's sort of up to the users imagination and is likely not going to be perfectly consistant depending on how long the manga is. It's a tough situation to be in, but it seems like you could just search for other fetishes, then pick which one you want to fap to based on breast sizes on the covers.</br>  <br>That's what I do, it's just relatively quite inconvenient.</br>  <br>just make a list of big breast doujin artist, and avoid them.</br>  <br>That's pretty shitty advice, artists don't just draw one character type.</br>  <br> no doujin of Nagisa getting dominated by Bitch-sensei while being forced to wear girly outfits <br> only one doujin translated that includes similar premise <br> section is only 3 pages </br></br></br>  <br>life is suffering</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/836365/3e1170<wbr>5d9e/</wbr>   search for artist:jun english because I want to find shit from jun in english <br> get fucking everyone who has jun in their name (plus some more) <br>http://exhentai.org/?f_doujinshi=1&amp;<wbr>f_manga=1&amp;f_artistcg=0&amp;f_gamecg=0&amp;f<wbr>_western=0&amp;f_non-h=0&amp;f_imageset=0&amp;f<wbr>_cosplay=0&amp;f_asianporn=0&amp;f_misc=0&amp;f<wbr>_search=artist%3Ajun+english&amp;f_appl<wbr>y=Apply+Filter<br>why does this shit happen and how can I stop it?</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  I need cute shit.<br>Post cute shit.<br>Shit so cute that I die from diabetes.</br></br>  <br><br>http://exhentai.org/tag/artist:jun</br></br>  <br>I don't think you can really stop it if you really want other tags as well.

Hell, Desu lives in a country where it's haram and still does it.</br></br>  <br> I don't really see how doing any of those things would cause cascading issues, but then again I'm not that tech-savvy. <br><br>You can't just write 'delete' on an account when everything contained in the account is linked everywhere in the site. What happens to that account's gallery comments, or galleries he has uploaded, or forum posts etc.?<br><br>You're asking him to commit way too much work in redoing the whole basic structure of the site because some random idiots don't want to have an account on random site on the internet anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What happens to that account's gallery comments, or galleries he has uploaded, or forum posts etc.? <br>Renamed to "posted by Anonymous" or something similar?</br></br>  <br>How much does check the info provided?<br>Is it easy to fake it up?</br></br>  <br><br>You're dealing with real money, I don't think you can fake shit since you need a real bank account/credit card linked to paypal to transfer your earnings or pay using it.<br><br>Or you could fake info on Paypal but I'm not sure how your bank/credit card company will take that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, probably the serves pay themselves.</br>  <br>They need to do the same for Girls forM.</br>  <br> people who know shit about computers talking avout computers </br>  Well /a/, I've hit a wall that I don't know how to overcome.<br><br>I can easily use saucenao/pixiv but once I get the title and find it on some site like this <br>http://www.toranoana.jp/mailorder/a<wbr>rticle/04/0030/04/12/040030041272.h<wbr>tml <br>I don't know what to do next.<br><br>I can't find it on sadpanda, can't read runes well enough to use something like dlsite or perform good searches.<br><br>Is this because of the purge?

Is the account name the same as the screen name or are they separate?<br><br>Back when e-hentai first opened I had this weird habit of registering to H-websites not with my usual account names, but intentionally extremely stupid ones, so that people that knew my, back then, rare account name wouldn't be able to make the connection to me.<br><br>Now, many years have passed and everytime I do anything account-related on e-hentai or Sadpanda, I have to see this stupid name, and I just feel embarrassed, so I wish to eradicate it fully from that account, since it's too import to me to just register a new one.<br><br>So, before I donate 100$ in eurodollaridoos, which I would mostly do because I appreciate Sadpanda and not just because I want to change my name, though, I would like to know whether "screen name" refers to all instances of names there and not just the publicly shown ones, like in Steam.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe it's just the display name on the forums. Not sure if all future gallery actions would have the new name or not.</br>  <br>Your login username stays the same. Your forum and gallery name changes.</br>  <br>Noooo!

Sometimes I can't discern whether the blowjobs he does have great amounts of saliva or if the girl is just vomiting.</br>  <br><br>I don't really like it or dislike it. I just find it kind of odd that it'd be a fetish is all.</br></br>  <br><br>It's less odd than making an entire book about belly punching, and not even having the courtesy to make it pregnant belly punching.</br></br>  <br>It's more like I'm trying to figure out what it is that makes the barf fetish so appealing.</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/815759/8a37ae<wbr>dd1a/<br><br>The objective best position</br></br></wbr>  <br>Feels like something he acquired from the deepest darkest depths of the internet.

But it indeed has been pretty long time since I last took a look at anything S;G related, so a rewatch would be in place.</br>  <br>There's an official release now.</br>  <br>DON'T REWATCH IT. If you've forgotten a lot of the anime, that means your experience with the VN will be even better. I made the mistake of re-marathoning the anime before I started reading the VN, and it made the considerable parts of the VN that got adapted 1:1 in the anime completely tedious, since I remembered every little thing was gonna happen in them. There's an official translation for the VN now that's a lot better than the fan translation, go read that before you rewatch the anime.</br>  <br><br>Official VN translation is here. S;G 0 is on the horizon. It's a good time to be a SciAdv fan, though no Noah is disappointing.</br></br>  <br> no Noah <br>What?</br></br>  <br><br>Steiner said that corporate opinion was still out on a Noah localisation. Current trends are pointing towards Chaos;Child being the localization. As I recall, it was annouced that C;C along with Psycho Pass are coming over to the XboxOne.</br></br>  <br>I should perhaps step in and say that I've made it a point to refuse Chaos;Child without Chaos;Head being a preceding factor. PQube is aware of our stance on that.</br>  <br>Both Chaos;Heads?</br>  <br>Which is why they decided to release Hiyoku Renri no Darling with Zakobot's translation instead.</br>  <br>WINKEL PLS</br>  <br>Please no.</br>  <br>Damn it Blick we weren't meant to say anything before the reveal.</br>  <br>By upscaling images of her and drinking Dr.Pepper while listening to the OSTs.<br/></br>  <br>Oi, whats up with the RD Kickstarter,<br>is there some bonus if you back the game?</br></br>  <br><br><br>That's cruel.</br></br></br>    <br><br>It's in bad taste to joke like that, guys.

Didn't you say that corporate opinion was out on you confirming Noah, NOT that corporate opnion was out on Noah being localised? And I'm taking it that C;C for XBone wasn't actually announced like  said? Wouldn't there be a bigger fuss if it was?<br><br>But then the real question is:<br>Why did you not clear properly any of those up?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because ambiguity is my greatest ally. Aside from Israel.</br>  <br><br>Seriously? Man, that sucks. Fucking niggers and gooks.</br></br>  <br>Chaos;Child for Xbone wasn't announced, that anon was talking shit.</br>  <br><br>It is bad that I'm younger than her? I don't know how to feel about this.</br></br>  <br>It's okay, I'm not even as old as she is  during the events of the VN . Can't be worse than that.</br>  <br>It's fine. You're only given so long here on earth, would be a shame to rush it.<br><br>Come back when you're 18.</br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri figure.</br>  <br><br>Oh my god.</br></br>  <br>Nice. I'm happy they made figures based off this illustration.</br>  <br>Fug she's even exactly the same age as me. Perfect waifu, why can't you be real?</br>  <br><br>I would've love this to happen anyway just to fuck with everyone's head.</br></br>  <br>If she was real anon, she still wouldn't love you.<br>Her heart belongs to Okabe.<br>  the only reason i don't have a waifu is because Kurisu only has eyes for MADDO SEYENTIST.  </br></br></br>  <br>Not in every worldline. Even if they only exist as possible states for the universe to assume, that's enough for me.</br>  <br>Everyone's  chaos  head</br>  Happy Birthday Kurisu  How long has it been anons?  <br>Since?</br>  <br><br>Since the first time you celebrated her birthday?</br></br>  <br>This is the first time I've been in a thread for it.</br>  <br><br>Ah, welcome then!

She just has a confused and warped idea of what love is.  <br>No, shes a horny little semen demon who is sexually frustrated</br>   tbh   <br>this<br>If she had accidentally kissed somebody else are something along those lines, she would have gone after them.

Although it looks better than I thought it would.  <br>yes! I think so,too</br>  Sasaki bestgrill.        <br>Of course I remember, it's just that no one is going to be replying to every "I know that" post in this thread.</br>  <br>You should make one for every frame of that gif.</br>    ITT : 1/10 Anime.    This is a good rec thread  <br>I couldn't ever bring myself to finish it. I enjoyed its plight but I just couldn't get interested in it.</br>  Noragami<br>I fucking hated that piece of shit.</br>    Weaksauce was so fucking good holy shit<br><br>2016 can't come soon enough</br></br>  So it was supposed to have a 3rd cour where it went 100% relentlessly grimdark but they pussied out, right?<br><br> Right? </br></br>  WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?<br>WHAT DOES IT FUCKING MEAN!?</br>  <br> Hype for OKADA and maybe a manga cameo in the movie. <br> Spin-off cameo in a movie <br>Neither Oriko or Kazumi related stuff appeared in Madoka Magica. I already lost all my faith in that happening yet Takara Tommy guys could do something since they are so fucking based, like in the end of Spread.</br></br></br>  Speaking of Okada, since these threads often devolved into talking about her.<br><br>Is anyone here hype for Mobile Okada Gundam: TEKKETSU?</br></br>  <br>It can't really be worse than the last couple of Gundams.</br></blockquote>]
