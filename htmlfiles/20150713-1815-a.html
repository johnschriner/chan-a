The one you posted looks nice tho.</br>  <br>I think what you've noticed is wrong.</br>  Why did Mandarake think adding machine translation was a good idea?  <br>Well I mean, what would happen if your friends or girls comes over? Kinda embarrassing tbh.</br>    <br>Because little girls dont order lewd figures, also dont forget to preorder the 2015 Figure of the Year™.</br>  <br>With the amount of unique items they have, with stock constantly changing, having an actual person translate it isn't viable.</br>  <br>What's this, free shipping?</br>  <br>I feel like I should get more horse sluts to go with Celia, but I really don't care about the series.</br>  <br>normalfag please</br>  <br>Would this be considered lewd? I always considered lewds to be completely explicit, like not just cast off but there was no option to put clothes on.</br>  <br>I do mention that I'm waiting on this beauty though.</br>  <br>Not him but they kinda look like ballsacks. But I bet you like that, huh?</br>  <br> lewd <br> /lo͞od/ <br> adjective <br> adjective: lewd; comparative adjective: lewder; superlative adjective: lewdest <br> crude and offensive in a sexual way. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I missed the preorder window for this, now I have to settle for Pochaco.</br>  <br>So any figure in a bikini is a lewd? wheres the line?</br>  Everyday I order a flat chested figure it feels like the Canadian government is going to come for me.  <br>It's all in the eyes, anon.</br>  <br>stop</br>  <br> bikinis are crude or offensive in a sexual way <br>Are you a 1950s' nun?</br></br>  <br>yes it's a bikini with a bit of armor, on the other hand this one not <br>unless you put the dildo in her, or display her with her boobs exposed.</br></br>  <br><br>brehs you need at least a 8x6 for that</br></br>  <br>meant to quote <br>first.</br></br>  <br>/fit/ pls go</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>You're gonna need more than that m8, Pocha loves the BBC</br>  <br>And I imagine the only people that love porkchopo are the blacks.</br>  <br>Because I don't like them.</br>  <br>Beaners tend to like gorditas too.</br>  <br> 8x6 <br>What</br></br>  <br> 2 preorders for this month  <br> see this <br> July release <br>Fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>Simply not interested, all the characters I like that get figures are usually aidorus and not lewd.</br>  <br><br>I get that, but they should leave it untranslated.

I'm thinking of ordering this to match<br><br>http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-011758<br><br>but its a figuart, as opposed to figma. So dumb question time, is there a big difference between the two? It'll rustle my jimmies if they end up different heights or something</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>stop responding to the porkspammer</br>  <br>Yes we do, it's called staying single.</br>  <br>Ordered this and another one, coming in dec. Fucking pricey as fuck, both are 11.5k</br>  <br><br>Im black and Irish and I love Pochaco.</br></br>  <br> Im black <br>We know.</br></br>  <br> Jointshit </br>  <br>Some lewds are tempting, but I'm trying to keep high standards, no lewds is one of the bars I use.</br>  <br>Don't tell me what to do, mom.</br>  <br>Actually thats great because it will arrive broken and itl be easier to melt down. <br>I sure hope that figure melter guy buys it.</br></br>  <br>Generally I agree with this. That one is pretty high quality though so it's tempting.</br>  <br>You better listen or you won't get any chicken tendies tonight.</br>    <br> not wanting to lick the velvety skin <br><br>what kind of faggot are you?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I agree, but where do you draw the lewd line? Swimsuits? Tits out? Most figures are a bit lewd.</br></br>  <br>I don't think swimsuit figures are lewd in generally, unless they're presenting.<br><br>But they usually get filtered by the boringness threshold anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok mom, but can you please stop insulting my Pochaco collection, shes not fat just horizontally challenged and I like that.</br>  <br>I'm so fucking sick of hair seams</br>  <br> oppai mousepads any worse than figs. </br>  <br>Get good at garage kits.</br>  <br>Imagine all the great figures that could have been bought with that money instead of that fat garbage</br>  <br>Who dis?</br>  <br>YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE</br>  Anyone know a place that's taking the z-ton centaur pillow preorders still, or is it just amiami?  <br><br>Imagine the figures that could have been made with all that plastic.</br></br>  <br>you already asked that previous thread and got your answer</br>  <br>And the oil that could have been kept underground. One pork is probably like 3 deepwater horizons.</br>  Anyone know where I can find this guide stated in the OP?  <br>I rephrased it so it's now a different question.</br>  <br>Why are you posting on your first day here?</br>  <br>The bunny suit bikini figure is the most absurd one of them. That pose is impossible, especially for her. Her ass is almost at the same height as her tits.</br>  <br>fine. It's still available  how about reading the guide? </br>  <br><br><br><br>Pochaco is the most infuriating character ever, curse you tsuji santa for coming up with with such a shit character.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Ranka Lee from Macross Frontier.</br></br>  <br>I'll never understand how anyone can think this looks good but I guess there's more than one way to skin a cat, as they say.</br>  Why is it that suddenly we have all this fatspam? I genuinely believe there are just a couple of them who want to shit up the thread as much as possible.  Anyone here assembled a garage kit? How much of a pain in the ass is it, if at all?  <br> that doesn't really answer the question <br><br>also none of the sites listed even have it either.</br></br></br>  <br>Just discuss something else instead of metashitting.</br>  <br>I'd like to fuck my cat.</br>  <br>Is her figure not based on that image?</br>  <br>Careful anon, as the saying goes, there are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream.</br>  <br>She looks amazing, it's just her breasts that are ugly.</br>  <br>Contacted PETA, you're going away for a long time scumbag.</br>  <br>Do you have steady fingers? Do you often accidentally get epoxy on your fingers? Are you good with a brush?<br><br>If you answered no to any of those questions, you're going to have a bad time.</br></br></br>  <br>8x6 inch dick. It's a/fit/ meme.</br>  <br>I pretty much order lewd things exclusively. But I've had to significantly cut back on my spending now that I moved to a new place. Money is sadly ridiculously tight right now.<br><br>Still have these girls on order though. Football Pochaco should be here on Monday or Tuesday too.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw only 7x5 </br>  <br><br>I've built a few. It depends totally on the kit.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>Fag.</br>  <br><br>I remember there used to be this cat that lived in an alley that would always come up to me and get pet. Holy fuck she was a slut. She would sit and my lap and I would get a boner and she would rub her ass against it, she would get on her back and spread her legs, bend over and try to show off her ass. I wanted to creampie that cat but obviously I would have killed it if I tried. Are all cats this slutty?</br></br>  <br>I'm as white as it's possible to be without being ginger or an albino.</br>  <br>Bottom left is the only one of those that doesn't look like shit.</br>  <br>Awful.</br>  I bought some display case things for my nendoroids.  <br> top right <br>Her abdomen looks like a noodle.</br></br>  <br>How much were they?</br>  <br>Take your blogshit to </br>  <br>Your nendos look so dead in that picture. They remind me of those butterfly collection showcases.</br>  <br>wow i didn't even know this was a board.</br>  <br>Resize already. People told you so often and you still don't remember to do it.</br>    pew pew  <br>$10 at the container store. <br><br>Well they are dead. I think they look fine this way. <br><br>Sorry, anon. I'm on an iPhone and I did the best I could by cropping it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>    <br>I don't understand people like you, can you not contain your excitement over posting your shitty picture to get to a computer first and resize and touch it up there?</br>  <br>I don't understand autistic people like you. Is you're internet really so shit that you have to complain about the size of photos? Is it that hard to just not complain about it? I post large photos just to trigger autistic fucks like you.</br>  <br><br>We've gone over this many times, groups of nendos together naturally gravitate towards standing blankly in a row. Its hard to do interesting things with them.</br></br>  <br>Do you really think there's nothing wrong with posting a shitty oversized picture like that ?</br>  <br>Nendos are trash.</br>  <br>That's the only reason I kind of want to buy all the sword nendos. It'd look pretty great putting them all in attack mode and displaying them in a formation.</br>  <br>Not really, no. I don't mind large photos.</br>  <br>At least the filesize is ok. I don't mind the resolution if the filesize is fine.</br>  <br><br>Same reason I'm getting all the Kancolle nendos, they look fun ganging up on attacking Re and Wo.</br></br>  <br>Pochaco is Perfection</br>  <br>I'd marry a girl that looked like her in a second.</br>  <br>Potaters gonna potate. This is a lovely collection anon. I need to get that kneeling Pochaco one of these days.</br>  <br>All of that useless fat disgusts me to no end.</br>  <br>It's not useless. It's for fucking. Fuckmeat</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>Their heights are listed on their respective pages, you know. And besides the height, the styles will be very different.</br>  <br>where2cop?</br>   tfw you own more "large breasts" figures than most people own figures in total   <br> Not wanting to get into all those crevices.  <br>Get a load of this faggot.</br></br>  <br> Belly button <br><br>L-lewd</br></br></br>  So what's the deal with these two? Kahotan's twitter said that they were being sold at a Haikyuu event, but will they'll get a GSC online shop release too?  <br><br>I am married to a girl like Pochaco. It is true that this is the post perfectly fuckable body type.</br></br>   that shitass First GE episode <br> those pre-orders <br>Aragami figures literally never. Fucking kill me.</br></br>  <br>FUCKING NORMALFAGS LEAVE FUCKING LEAVE<br>REEEEEEEEEEE</br></br>  when?  will you?  <br>This is a garage kit right?|</br>  <br>I can't even begin to imagine the inner turmoil you feel on a daily basis when you see a fine thick ass.</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br> anime of imako <br> by queen bee <br><br>oy vey</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have never seen a Macross figure this lewd before. Good thing I like Sheryl more out of the Frontier girls.<br><br>Beta-san is ordered, but I'm still on the fence with D'Artagnan. I never really cared for her as a character, but I like how they did her clothes and sword, and Alter hasn't disappointed me on a single Nishi design except Senhime's Succubus fig.</br></br></br>  I got some scales, am I cool yet?<br><br>Limitgunz was only $25</br></br>  <br>You do realize that like 20+ people here have Amakuni's Momohime preordered, right?</br>  <br>Pain in the arse regarding customs.<br><br>I'd probably get more if I had my own place. Lewds seem like where people I live with would draw the line.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no problem with the concept of lewd figures. They just don't make any that appeal to my tastes. Most of them of grotesquely huge breasts (I'm fine with up to an D-cup), a lot of the outfits are ridiculously gaudy, and the faces are often ugly (although the one in your picture is good).</br>  <br>you posted this last thread</br>  This is my line of lewd. Anything cast-off is a no-go. But things like this are fine. However, if it's loli, I think exposed flat chests are far less offensive and displaying figures like Mordina is fine.  <br>That's pretty lewd dude. Way too lewd for me.</br>  <br>I really want a scales of them in their work uniforms. Also nendos, especially for Rize</br>  <br>What about this? What's your condition of lewd?</br>  <br> Anything cast-off is a no-go <br>She's cast off. It's the reason the swimsuit looks so terrible.</br></br>  <br>Re-read what I said.</br>  Question<br><br>When I see the stock images for a figure and some of the images contain removed items of clothing or bare breasts, does that mean you can remove some pieces of clothing or do they sell extra parts you have to buy for that?</br></br>  This Pochaco fig when? I love huge breasts in yukata.  <br>It'll include everything shown, whether its removable or separate pieces that you can swap out.</br>  <br>Great, thanks.</br>  <br>Never, they don't make Pochaco figs without exposed breasts and thighs.</br>  <br>If I take the clip off would she still be fat?</br>  What kind of packaging does Big in Japan use? Is it similar to the plain "FRAGILE" boxes amiami uses?  <br>It would be extremely painful.</br>  <br>There's no anime girl or anything weird on it if that's what you're worried about. Just a box.</br>    <br>That is one good looking figure.</br>  <br>Figure soon..</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12799885 <br>but sadly too small.</br>  <br>Look at those feet. That's slimmer than some Sonico figures.</br>  <br>That is a Sonico figure.</br>  <br>it's based on that image</br>  <br>Regular brown box with a generous amount of newspaper filling and some bubble wrapping.</br>    When will pirate sento be shown?  <br>That explains it. What a shame, slim Pochaco is cute.</br>  So GSC decided to ignore their own poll to justify their higher prices by buying through them?  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>Not soon enough</br>  Want to buy this, but I don't know anything about Revolve.  <br>we already know that, scram.</br>  <br>That tail connection looks awful.</br>  <br>yup.</br>  <br>What was the poll?</br>  <br>Me either but I love that hair</br>  <br><br>Do lewd doujins count? Lewd figures for the most part just seem pretty shit.</br></br>  <br>Thats probably the least disgusting porkchoco I've seen. Still wouldn't buy tho</br>  <br>Odango a cute</br>  <br>Wait till after wonderfes, better looking kiniros might be announced. <br> I'm hoping for a good scale of aya. </br></br>  <br>too skinny would not buy</br>    <br>I disagree.</br>    I don't know the character either, but she looks beautiful.  <br>She's a fucking bitch. That's what she is.</br>  <br>Too bad she's dead.</br>    <br>Waiting to see GSC color theirs.</br>  <br>Please understand.</br>  <br><br><br>at least you should have put spoilers, you people are awful.</br></br></br>  <br>that looks amazing too, is she 1/8?</br>  <br>They cover their boxes in loli scat h manga pages and have a special barcode on them so when they go through sorting at the terminal they get scanned and an alarm will go off that suddenly yells "ahahahaha get a load of this loser [your name] ".</br>  <br>The show aired last season, there's no excuse for not knowing who she is. That's what you get for being retarded.</br>  <br>Not all of us are nerds that watch anime 24/7. Some of us have backlogs.</br>  <br>Well I don't watch anime :/ .</br>  <br>I'm not even asking you to watch it, just to know who she is. <br>When you post comments like that you're pretty much asking for it.</br></br>  <br>If you've ever looked through the catalog these past months or so you would have known. I haven't watched it and I knew.</br>  <br>my response was this one </br>    <br>Careful</br>  <br>I saw the wrong figure, then. Looks nice.</br>    <br>Sell me her body? 200 bucks.</br>  <br>GG is shit, could not even finish the first episode.</br>  <br>This is not the thread for that.</br>  <br> Dropping it before zombies </br>  <br><br>That body would sure look good covered in hotglue...</br></br>  <br><br>I'm amazed you think anyone would give a shit about the opinion of someone like you.</br></br>  <br>Good for you anon. I'm sure there's somebody out there who cares!</br>  <br>Plastic Gurashis when</br>  <br>I did. Your statement is inconsistent with the picture that you say is "fine".</br>  <br>Yeah I got confused too.</br>  <br>that's the whole purpose of that fig, I wonder I should order her, the bad thing is that I would have to order her on my mom's name.</br>  <br>Looks like you're just shit at picking up context.</br>  <br><br>I found two people who care about his opinion.</br></br>  <br> I want a Miki figure but shovel knight is ok </br>  <br>is that a dude?</br>  <br>Re-read it again. Do I really have to spell it out for your secondary English speaking ass?</br>  <br><br>If it's cute, does it matter?</br></br>  <br> anything cast-off is a no-go, but things like this cast-off are fine <br> matter of context <br>No, it's a matter of either not using your words correctly to get an idea across, or you being retarded. Look up the word "anything" if you care to improve yourself, or perhaps throwing in the word "usually" in the first part would have cleared it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Can you read?</br>  <br>I think he meant the cast off figures are better when their clothing parts aren't off. Basically, the picture.</br>  <br>Well Celia has a pretty nice body too but I havent seen any hotglue pics or vids of her.<br>I also might just end up getting her for hotglue purposes, that body should not go uncovered.</br></br>  <br>"If the figure is cast-off (past tense), it's no-go. But things like this (picture) are fine. I think exposed flat chests [compared to exposed breasts] are far less offensive"</br>  When?  <br>just let it go.</br>  <br>If he had written that, there would have been no confusion. As I said, the word "anything" being used was not the best choice.</br>  <br>No point passing the blame for your inability to grasp context. You're in the wrong here.</br>    <br>I should feel bad, but  he was ok with the region lock </br>  <br>I think I could never cum on a scale, maybe on a prize but definitely not on a proper scale,</br>  What's on the way to you at the moment? <br><br>I picked up a couple of Sonico prize figures but otherwise nothing else I'm waiting on has shipped.</br></br>  <br>I only made the two posts suggesting not to have used the word anything, but okay big boy.</br>  <br>"Has been cast-off" would have been correct, not "is cast-off".</br>  <br>Only selvaria</br>  <br>Okay, that makes sense. It's confusing because in normal usage saying a figure is "cast off" refers to the fact that the figure can be cast off, whether or not the clothing has been removed.  should have just said "Anything nude is a no-go."</br>  <br><br>I didn't know what you guys were talking about. At first I thought he was fired or something.</br></br>  Is this lewd?  <br> overlapping bases <br><br>No, it's shit</br></br></br>  <br>This fatty should be home in a few days, cant wait to cover her mammaries in my man juice</br>    <br><br>I didn't realise I wanted a garters-chan figure until just now.</br></br>  <br>This set up makes me want to puke.<br>Please remove that base from overlapping the other.</br></br>    <br><br>That sakura looks so retarded. What a shitty setup. Don't you have room for wall shelves or something?</br></br>  <br>I only did that because Medaka was covering too much Sakura for the pic.</br>  <br>That girl on the right from gundam or some sunrise anime?</br>  <br>Oh its okay then, you should get a better place to keep them though, that shelf looks ugly and clashes terribly with them.</br>  <br><br>Are you displaying two of the same figure?</br></br>  <br>I have little room and too many figures :/</br>  <br><br><br>This looks bad, cluttered, your bases are overlapping and makes you look like a 10 year old who leaves his toys anywhere. <br><br>From the looks of it, its a very narrow shelf and I bet you can only look at them from the front, leaving many things to be seen. <br><br>Also, mixing scale heights and lewds with regular figures just makes it look stupid too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's the same I moved it with the bigger ones.</br>  <br> shitty setup <br> one piece <br> emoticons <br>poetry</br></br></br></br>  <br>End yourself or buy a fucking display already, you could have bought a couple of simple planks and some hangers with the price of any of your figures and your whole collection would fit on it.</br>  <br><br><br>I know, I'll buy this one, next month.</br></br></br>  <br>You still have shit taste.</br>  <br>That's a nice cabinet, Anon</br>  <br>is the color bad?, there aren't much options where I live.</br>  <br>I mean your collection.</br>  <br> wheels <br>absolutely haram</br></br>  <br>Nice one.

I ordered 3 books this weekend and they're scheduled to get here on Wednesday. UK's shipping takes weeks.</br></br>  <br>Im going to keep tabs on it, hope it does.</br>  How are Figuart Zeros? I don't have any experience with them but this looks very nice.  Gathered my comic-con loot in one place.<br><br>Sorry for the potato quality.</br></br>  <br>The same kind of tard who buys a laptop in the first place. Probably some Apple shit.</br>  <br> going to comic-con </br>  <br>DHL uses time travel magic.</br>  <br>UK Customs. Why else.</br>  <br>so edgy</br>  <br>I wish she wasn't an exclusive. Guess I'll wait and see if anything else goes up in GSC's store in the next two weeks.</br>  <br><br>That's a massive oversimplification. I'd have things take weeks to even get to customs. I presume it has something to do with SAL, if I recall correctly, using spare space. combined with less flights overall.</br></br>  <br>They're all pretty nice, worth picking up.</br>  <br>It's fun going with your  friends  <br><br>Whats the matter anon, don't you have  friends? </br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it, but there might be some nendoroids or something for cheap. <br><br>post your collection please. I want to see what good "taste" looks like.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't anon, I don't</br>  <br>But both sites use DHL, not SAL.<br><br>I've had an outgoing parcel stuck in customs for a week now and that's being shipped by Royal Mail. UK Customs a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Guys like him never post theirs.<br>They're all talk.</br></br>  <br>She's up on GSC's store right now.</br>  Can you combine Wonfes exclusive orders with the other figs in the GSC shop during Wonfes?  <br>Hopefully amazing, Umarun is life.</br>  <br>No shit, but full price + sales tax + 2k shipping for one nendo is pushing it. If they put up other things during the next 2 weeks it becomes more bearable since the shipping is split between them, making for some nice cheap EMS.<br><br><br>No, they're considered 2 different shops.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's saying that one fig doesn't justify the flat 2k.</br>  Oh no, she's adorable.  <br>Are you serious? You don't need "credentials" to criticize someone's tastes.<br><br>It's simple; people who like the same things have good taste, and those who do not have bad taste.<br><br>Why are you taking it so personally?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No, they're considered 2 different shops. <br>Thank you.</br></br>  <br>Not worth it, the sailors are too small, and sometimes they have paintwork issues.</br>   People who bid way before a listing ends.   <br> 2.7 MB, 4000x3000 </br>  <br>Shut up and post your collection. Literally all talk no bite.</br>  <br>sorry, i didn't notice.</br>  <br> not just putting in your max bid and walking away </br>  <br><br>Newshit please stop posting.</br></br>  <br> not inching your bid up when you know you're going to lose anyway just to make the other guy pay more </br>  <br>Why should I?<br><br>I never made any comment about anybody's collection, and am not a child that buys to satisfy random people on the internet.<br><br>Grow up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not trying your best to please a number ofanonymous people on an anonymous image board <br><br>f-fucking non-autists!</br></br></br>  <br> not snipe bidding a figure that's a uncommon and a good price just to imagine the other person distraught at losing </br>  <br> Not just using Buy It Now so you don't have to worry about anyone outbidding your prized item. </br>  <br>Crap... there goes an other $50.</br>  <br> ebay </br>  <br>I remember when I made some fucker spend well over 10kY on two doujinshi. <br>I felt sad back then but I got one of them for 1.5kY the other day so it's not too bad.</br></br>  <br>What? Yahoo Auctions also has a buy it now feature.</br>  <br> not buying authentic figure 100% China home version Anime Girl Miku Saber Tony ver. for $19 free shipping </br>  <br>I've thought about buying a cheap bootleg for glueing.</br>  <br>That's all they're good for, unless you're a pyromaniac apparently.</br>  <br> Gluing shitty bootlegs of your waifu with a busted face <br>Not even once.</br></br>  <br>You will probably die having your junk anywhere near that stuff.</br>  <br>If I was going to die it's be from Chinese resin model kits I've already done.</br>  <br>did you  went to the udon boot? </br>  <br> not blasting your waifu's malformed clones with cum as a final mercy before putting them out of their misery </br>  <br>??? <br><br>sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.</br></br></br>  <br>oh, nevermind then.</br>  imako is such a simone d'mone  Do HLJ and Amiami have certain days where they update upcoming preorders, or is it whenever they get it. I really don't want to miss out on the upcoming Lupin III prize figures. The first one is up on HLJ now, but there are still 3 more announced.  <br>Not really that I can tell. Your best bet would be to follow comments on MFC and hope somebody posts the link, or hlj post it themselves.</br>  Anyone know how the 3.0 Evangelion Real Action Hero figs came out, especially Rei? I hear it can be a hit or miss with RAH.  <br>I'll probably do those. I'm also checking Banpresto's recent releases daily. I lucked out and found the first Lupin figure today. These prize figures sell out quick.</br>  Does anyone here have the Dragon's Crown elf? How is she?  Ended up doing it on canvas instead of framing it. Came out decent enough hopefully  <br>It's conflicting. I like the idea of materials used on figs but it looks like really loose skin. Like the plug suit didn't shrink right.</br>  <br>I had Asuka Q (battle damaged) RAH, and to be honest, it was a bit shit. I think it being crappy for me has a lot to do with the plugsuits not being very pose friendly. The fabric is very tight and I worried just slight movement would rip it. I tried to the poses on her box and I couldn't. Then again maybe I got a fluke one with shitty joints.<br><br>tl;dr<br>My experience was it's a jointed doll that will stand in a boring position, with a real clothing gimmick.</br></br></br></br>  finally the cast-off pictures, pretty sure this is the best pochaco so far  <br>Sales tax? Are you a britbong or is there some extra prices that an amerilard should be concerned about.</br>  <br>10/10 would  ejaculate on then feel immediate regret, clean her off then ejaculate on again </br>  <br>GSC doesn't remove Japanese sales tax from their international store. So instead of just paying the full base price, you pay that plus 8%.</br>  <br>Well shit, guess they have to justify their shitty pre order bonuses somehow.</br>  <br><br>Neither does Amico or any store aside from Manda and Amazon, so complaining about it is dumb. <br><br>Also, the tax is usually like 300 yen so you're even more dumb to complain about $2 extra.</br></br></br></br>  <br>BiJ, HLJ and HS and CDJ don't include the sales tax. AmiAmi usually has enough of a discount to essentially get rid of the sales tax.<br><br>And the amount of the tax depends on the base price. Something that costs 15k isn't going to have 300 yen tax, it's going to be 1200.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good thing we're talking about a 4k Nendo and not a 15k scale. My point is that complaining about having to pay that tax is dumb because it is already included in literally everything you purchase, Amico elevates the retail price and then offers a good discount so people don't notice, BiJ usually charged the same as Amico, HS, HlJ and CDJ can charge anywhere from 1 to 3k more that both Amico and BiJ, so at the end of the day it doesn't matter if they tell you "nuh uh we're not charging you any tax!" because you're already paying more.</br></br>  <br>I hope it's easy to get her to hold something else instead of the handegg.</br>  <br><br>I'm not sure if the nipple plasters make it better or worse.</br></br>  <br><br>well, her nipples are kinda meh</br></br>  <br> My point is that complaining about having to pay that tax is dumb because it is already included in literally everything you purchase <br>Oh I see, you just don't know what you're talking about.<br>BiJ, HLJ, HS and CDJapan DO NOT include sales tax in their pre-discount prices.<br>AmiAmi DOES NOT elevate the retail price, they take the base price + 8% tax (which is what you'd see at GSC's store) and then apply their discount, which generally puts them on par with BiJ's prices.<br>The other stores simply have smaller discounts, but they are still not charging sales tax. At no point are you paying more at any of these stores than you would at GSC's. Usually you're paying less.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>front view</br>  <br>The bandaids wouldn't be so bad if they didn't look so fake. Personally I've never seen a bandaid with such dark spots, unless blood is seeping through.</br>  <br>Sorry for replying to such an old post, but what trouble could there be at customs for lewd figures?</br>  <br><br>You're one dense motherfucker.</br></br>  <br>No, you're just a fucking idiot and I'm done with you.</br>  <br> dumb to complain about $2 extra <br>You're pretty stupid, man. Of course complaining about it isn't going to change anything, but it's normal to not be happy over the idea of spending more money unnecessarily. The system is the way the system is, and discounts can often cover the fee, but that doesn't mean a person has to agree with it.<br><br><br> it's fine since the consumer doesn't notice it and is paying it already <br>You are one hell of a little bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>October's going to fucking suck.<br>Not looking forward to paying 10% tax for proxy/forwarding stuff to a nation I don't live in.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait are they fucking raising sales tax again?</br></br>  <br>Definitely better without. 11/10 would  tenderly love </br>  <br>Loyalty</br>   buy Japanese shit <br> pay 10% tax <br> UK customs shows up <br> they want 20% </br></br></br>  <br>Why are Walkure Romanze designs so good? This is the third figure I've preordered from the series.</br>   Buy Japanese shit <br> Happily pay the asking price because I'm not a miserable Jew <br> Package promptly delivered by local post kangaroo with no customs charges </br></br>  The following release dates have been confirmed:<br><br>Shipping out from GSC on the 22nd July 2015:<br>Good Smile Company - Eren Yeager<br>Good Smile Company - Rin Shibuya: New Generation Ver.

I can't believe it.<br><br>Not the best board to post that, but damn...</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I. CAN'T. BELIEVE. IT.</br></br>  <br>Why is Kotori so perfect?</br>  <br>She just is.</br>  <br>Based FFF</br>  I missed some threads after the las Summary Anon post.<br><br>Has there been any new summary of the short stories?</br></br>  <br>Wait, have there been any other threads after the summaries other than that Miku one?</br>  <br>I lost hope. Finally someone is doing the BD's.</br>  There is still hope.  Volume 2 when?  <br>Always<br><br><br>Any minute now, that or it'll take the same amount of time it took vol1 to be released after it came out</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I don't know.</br></br>  For those who didn't see the other thread that's up right now. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RTS<wbr>haDDj6Mg</wbr>  [ ]  <br>It was posted yesterday too but just like this OP he made the terrible mistake of making a thread on a weekend plus it was almost too late for most people.</br>  <br>Such is the fate of DAL without clockfags and paperfoldingfags to argue and/or circlejerk.</br>  <br>We can always post about rape or something</br>  <br>What do you mean? Clockfags left the same year S1 ended, after the first game was released and we got the summaries for some routes.</br>  <br> Clockfags left the same year S1 ended <br>They didn't leave, they just decreased in post frequency.<br><br>I want to rape Origami, willingly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Clockfags are dead in actual DAL threads</br>  <br> they just decreased in post frequency. <br>That means they left, clockags are the kind of people who don't give a shit which thread they post as long as there is Kurumi circlejerking.</br></br>  I'm a clockfag but I have no need to say it out load each thread when there is not much screentime for her in the last novel.  <br>I'm sure that a bunch of fags who only liked this series for clock have left, but it's easy to assume that a lot of people here are still clockfags.</br>  <br><br>She had way too little time in Vol 12 but it really looks like she will have much more in the following one.</br></br>  <br>What? Do you even know the why we call these guys "clockfags"? True fans are called Kurumifags while clockfags are those cancerous faggots who made those Kurumi circlejerking threads, you can even see them in the archive bitching about mods deleting their threads.</br>  <br>Woah, so sorry I misused your highly thread-specific terminology anon, I see now how you could have been confused by my post.</br>  <br>It's not that important but it can be useful because usually clockfags refer to Kurumi as clock, they also don't give a shit about Kurumi's actual character and hate the main series.</br>  Baka tsuki is coming along with Volume 12 translations. I didn't read anons spoilers because, spoilers. Hyped for more Shiori.  <br>Shiori was the worst part about it though, just like in volume 6.</br>  <br> Shiori <br> worst part <br>This is going to be one hell of a good book.</br></br></br>  Date A Live is one of the most enjoyable anime trainwrecks i've ever seen.  <br>I don't know what you are expecting but it's only a pointless short scene and as usual Miku was also shit.</br>  <br>This is not Symphogeah.<br><br>DAL is an enjoyable LN</br></br></br>  <br>but trainwrecks have no breaks, in this case each arc ends when the girl is sealed. Origami arc was a hell of ride though.</br>  <br><br>I don't like anime with singing, and none of the symphogear girls are cute imho. it's like a bad mix of idolmaster and infinite stratos</br></br>  <br><br>Origami is the best girl too!</br></br>  <br> none of the symphogear girls are cute <br>That is some serious shit taste.</br></br>  <br>They said it could never be done. They mocked our dreams, they guffawed at our hopes, and they chastised our ambition. But look at us now. We did it, /a/.</br>  <br> ! <br>First: stop that and second: Origami used to be worst girl but her arc fixed that.</br></br>  <br>Wat</br>  <br><br> stop that <br><br>; ;<br><br>so you want me to do what i did above, or use proper punctuation instead. exclamations are proper, emojis are not. pick 1 and only one you sperglord.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We managed to move over into the realm of the impossible, Spicy wolf S3 confirmation tomorrow</br>  <br>Now we need a DtB S2.</br>  <br>Anon, please.<br><br>There are some things you just don't joke about.</br></br></br>  <br> First: stop that </br>  <br><br><br>That's a lot of pixels.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't like anime with singing <br>What are you, gay?

She would accept my dick.  kallen had the bigger butt  <br>Of course. Geass contracts have no downside.<br> magical power that gets stronger with every use <br> if you get tired of it you can trade it for immortality </br></br></br>  <br>you could get stuck with a lame Geass though, like the ability to control fish</br>  <br><br>I want my Geass power to be the ability to please C.C. physically and emotionally.</br></br>  <br>lol<br><br>geass all seems to be mind powers related to people.<br><br>you could however get stuck with the power to feel whenever someone takes a dump.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>or inhuman reaction time when asleep.</br></br>  <br>Is it worth the price?</br>  <br>Yes, and I would do so knowing that, in the best case scenario, I would turn into a Mao-level C.C. fetishist autist, because I'm already basically there.</br>  Yeah, sure, why not?<br><br>It's not like I've got anything better to do.</br></br>  Let's see what Geass powers are in the show.<br>Leleouch :can control a persons will<br>down side: can only use once a person and needs eye contact<br>Mao: Can read minds of anyone <br>no eye contact <br>downside he can't turn it off <br>Charles can implant false memories give you a false life. <br>Needs eye contact <br>Marianne can use her power to transfer her soul to another body<br>downside needs eye contract<br>Rolo can stop time but in a small field <br>downside heart problems</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A soul pledged to the darkness.</br>  <br>C.C. is best and perfect. I would become her sex slave if she wills it.</br>  <br>Now i've lost it</br>  <br><br>Objectively speaking they wouldn't, unless they wanted to kill C.C. in the process or had no intention of fulfilling it past getting a Geass for themselves</br></br>  <br>I know I can kill</br>  <br>The truth exists beyond the gate</br>  <br>THE TRUTH EXISTS FROM BEYOND THE GATE</br>  Why so many Code Geass threads latley?  <br>YOU ARE STUPID</br>  <br><br> lately </br></br>  <br>This a thousand times. It's been almost a decade and she still drives me crazy.</br>  <br> No downside <br>It's like you didn't watch the thing at all<br>Mao goes crazy<br>Lelouch kills everyone he loves<br>Charles abandons his family<br>C.C. hates life</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I accept your contract*<br><br> *On the condition that C.C. becomes my mistress <br><br>SIgn here babe _____</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mao goes crazy <br>His weak personality was the cause of that.<br> Lelouch kills everyone he loves <br>Only because of his goal and the fact that he didn't know of the side effects of Geass.<br> Charles abandons his family <br>Because the end justified the means for him.<br> C.C. hates life <br>Again, she became immortal against her will. She barely knew anything about Geass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even when they're all justified, it's hard to consider there would be no potential to disaster, even if you had previous knowledge about Geass</br>  <br>True enough. It's just that the average faggot from /a/ would know enough to rectify the potential disaster.</br>  <br>Depends on the power.</br>  <br>The power is always related to what your heart desires the most, so probably something you'd appreciate but wouldn't be able to handle properly</br>  C.C would literally become a live-in waifu.<br><br>Does she have any particular power other than immortality? From memory she just has an inordinate amount of sass.</br></br>  <br>Bismarck can see a few seconds into the future<br>Downsides: ???</br></br>  <br>Still no downsides for anyone here<br> Mao goes crazy <br>Would you be discussing this shit if you were sane?<br> Lelouch kills everyone he loves <br>Pretty sure most anons here are a loner/hikki shit that don't even love himself.<br> Charles abandons his family <br>The only reason the average anon stay with their family is because they are too poor to afford living alone.<br> C.C. hates life <br>topkek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read that as 'inordinate amount of ass'</br>  <br>She lost her Geass after gaining her Code, same with Charles<br><br>It's either immortality or a Geass</br></br></br>  <br>Also true.<br><br><br>So pretty much if you're stronger than her, you literally can do whatever you want with her, with the downside being there's a chance you'll get a shit Geass power?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying C.C. would let a pleb like you touch her, let alone sign a contract with her <br><br>Remember, she CHOSE Lelouch. They were destined to fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're going under the assumption that 'you' (meaning, every anon here) has been chosen by her, for some ungodly reason.</br>  <br><br> tfw I am destined to fuck a 700 year old exotic green haired beauty with the voice of a lewd angel </br></br>  <br> what your heart desires the most <br>What would my power be if I wanted to become a hero?</br></br>  <br>I'm already alone so that doesn't really create any downsides for me.</br>  <br>inflict orgasms at will. <br><br>So much fun</br></br></br>  <br>I think the upsides definitely outweigh the downsides. As  said, the power is related to what you want most, but it's sort of like a genie wish - you gotta be careful or it'll find a way to dick you around. See Beloved Chairman's insanity or Lelouch's accidental 'Murder everyone, little sis' accident.</br>  Sidney was the best girl. She was the only character that Lelouch had legitimate feelings for.  <br>If we consider that this is pre-Lelouch C.C., she's hoping to give you (random anons) the shitposting Geass so she could kill herself later on and curse /a/ with an immortal tripshitter</br>  <br>Her death was the saddest moment in the entire show.</br>  <br>I'm still not 100% sure how the contract works? So like, was Lelouch's to kill his dad or rule Brittania or some bullshit? And the reason C.C kept hanging around is because he hadn't completed that goal yet?</br>  <br><br>Shirley cuck get out</br></br>  <br>It has to be stitched up after use?</br>  <br>Sure. I'd like the power to make everyone happy, please. Just make it like Mao's in the fact that it's AoE and doesn't need eye contact.</br>  <br>It's completely true though. I'm just raising awareness, that's all.</br>  <br>Shirou pls</br>  <br><br> it's completely true <br><br>but it's not. Quit shilling your cuck ship</br></br></br></br>  <br>Think of it as a mutual benefit wish. <br><br>C.C. granted Lelouch a Geass in order for him to do what he wished (kill his dad, change the world and all that shit) but he also had to fulfill her wish in order to get the Geass.<br><br>Her wish being getting killed herself, since she was immortal and was tired of living. Plot progresses and turns out all she needed was a reason to continue living / attaining true love, even if it wasn't in a romantic sense</br></br></br></br></br>  What guess power would you like to have? Must be in laws of Geass verse and please state pros/cons.  <br>Geass is a monkey's paw wish. You'd make everyone happy, but they would get increasingly happy and in a state of ecstasy when around you that they would stop functioning as people. They'd be happy to sit there and just die from starvation. You'd be cursed to be away from the people you love in order to protect them from withering and dying from not wanting to do anything since they're content with just you around.</br>  <br><br>If you look closely at this line, the ending finally makes sense.</br></br>  <br><br>But my desire is to not die. I don't think I can get a Geass that does the same thing as Code.</br></br>  <br> Does she have any particular power other than immortality <br>She can fuck with peoples' heads, like she did to Suzaku.</br></br>  <br><br>You're an idiot. Shirley loved a fake ego of Lelouch.<br><br>Lelouch has his true self, and his two alter ego<br><br> Lelouch Vi Britannia - C.C.  <br><br>His true self<br><br> Lelouch Lamperogue - Shirley <br><br>his cuck self<br><br> Zero - Kallen <br><br>His superhero side</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goddamn it, Anon. Let a guy dream.<br><br> But yeah, I can see that fitting in the CG universe. Nice job. </br></br></br>  <br>So hang on, when C.C first got the Geass, did she wish for immortality, because I understood it as immortality becoming a side-effect of having the Geass for too long.<br><br>I haven't watched this in ages, I really need to run through it again.<br><br>So C.C gave him the one-shot Kotoamatsukami in return for her being allowed to die...but she can't die until...plot happens?<br><br>Either way  incredible amounts of hot immortal goddess dicking will go down </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying she didn't accept every side of him before she died <br> what is character development </br></br>  <br>How is it not true? It makes complete sense, I'm not sure we watched the same show.</br>  <br>Immortality isn't just given to a Geass user. You have to have a Code for that. C.C. had the power to make everyone love her.</br>  <br>No, she wished to be loved. Her predecessor wanted to die and she granted that wish by becoming immortal herself.</br>  <br><br> Implying Shirley had any relevance to the plot at all <br><br>Which is why she was killed off. Her character in its entirety is more akin to a used condom than anything. To say she was the only character Lelouch had any feelings for is completely moronic, when you're forgetting Nunally, Euphy, Cuckallen, and especially C2<br><br>Time to pull the dildo out of your ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thank you. I like the idea of Monkey's Paw wishes. </br>  <br>Partially true, since Lelouch had feelings for all four main girls.<br><br>He had fraternal love for Nunally, her happiness was his raison d'être.<br><br>C.C. showed him the meaning of loving people but not showing it, even at the expense of his own happiness.<br><br>Kallen taught him about having a true passion for a cause, with her being the only person in the Black Knights he cared for the most.<br><br>Shirley ultimately showed him the power of love, that with proper love the world could be turned into the place he had dreamt of.<br><br>All in all, he loved all of them, with Shirley being the one with the highest possibility of becoming his life partner (using pic related as a supporting point, since it's official art)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nunally <br> CC <br><br>Anon, I was talking about actual feelings. You know, like love and a desire to be together for life. <br><br> no relevance <br><br>Right, because she was killed before she could be useful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Of course. Why would I reject what I wanted all my life? I fucking want proper mind control powers.  <br><br> Le officialy promo art <br><br>nice meme. Lets post the pictures of Lelouch eating C.C.s asshole and sucking on Suzaku's cock too</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>triggered</br></br>  <br> The power is always related to what your heart desires the most <br>Then I'd probably end up getting CC's power</br></br>  <br>I like you anon. You ignore official art and instead spout nonsense.<br><br>I'm glad you were able to defend your point.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ah. So the person before C.C had the Code which made her immortal. C.C took the Code, allowing previous person to die, and got her wish of...making everyone superficially love her but not actually feel affection for her?</br></br>  <br>I'll try to run this down as simple as I can<br><br>Code users are immortal, can give Geasses and use their psycho powers to tinker around a person's head.<br><br>Geass users get granted a monkey paw wish that gets increasingly powerful. <br>Once their power mature, a Code bearer can choose to transfer his Code to the Geass user, losing his life in the process and the Geass user losing their Geass in the process</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> official art <br><br>absolutely astounding.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd have the power to have premonition-like awareness at all times. Like, if there was a deadly truck or something like that coming, I'd know to dodge and get out of the way quickly. That or I'd know to carry an umbrella on the days when deadly colds were rampant because of the rain.<br><br> The drawback is that as the power would get stronger, I'd become more and more paranoid. Eventually leading to complete insanity from the belief and premonition that everything out there would kill me. It would culminate with becoming completely insane and committing suicide out of the realization that death is inevitable and there isn't any way to avoid one's self from becoming the most dangerous threat. </br></br></br>  <br>You did it again. Nice one anon, you really showed them.<br><br>Just admit when you're wrong, it's not that hard.</br></br></br>  <br>No you!<br>I'm nothing like Shirou.</br></br>  <br><br> Admit that I'm wrong <br> headcanon cuck is supposedly right <br><br>Promo art means nothing. Headcanon cuckery means nothing. C.C. was the closet one to get Lelouch's dick and the only one even remotely implied to, next to Suzaku and Rolo.<br><br>Shirley shill pls leave.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>   wanting anything other than the Geass that turns you into Master Asia   <br>I bet the actual show means nothing either, right?<br><br>I'm not entirely sure how you're able to throw away episodes worth of character development, but okay.<br><br>I'm glad you're able to delude yourself to a point where you're convinced your right regardless of the evidence to the contrary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> His weak personality was the cause of that. <br><br>Most people get overtaken by Geass. Mao's was kind of fucked up from the start because he was never able to control it. CC gave a little kid a power and drove him mad for her own selfish reasons.<br><br>You ever notice that those who give Geass to others never actually explain it before signing the contract. Because they know most people probably wouldn't want it if they understood the risks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fellow ally of JUSTICE!</br>  <br><br> Actual show <br><br>You have cited nothing from the actual show. Provide screenshots, or done anything but write down headcanon fanfiction.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was close to not posting that art since people like you would likely use it as an argument point, ignoring the whole post accompanying it, hence I said supporting point and not final point.<br><br>Yes, the art can, and when possible, should be ignored, but I'm using the Word(Art) of God as a partial support on my argument. Dismiss it as you may, but it still doesn't change the fact that Shirley held more importance to the series than you chose to see fit</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> samefagging <br><br>new low Shirley shill</br></br></br></br></br>  So was it ever determined if things like mirror sunglasses could block Lelouch's Geass? Cause his helmet had the little slidey eyehole to allow shenanigans.<br><br>When it grew in power did it eventually overcome those limitations? Cause if not, Lelouch's power is pretty sweet, as long as you don't mind the title of 'That douchebag who always wears his $300 hipster sunglasses inside'</br></br>  <br>Of course he'll ignore your post. Your post goes directly against his delusion and he can't have that. <br><br>I'm not entirely sure why he's so set in his ways, but oh well. <br><br><br>Nice anon, instead of posting a rebuttal you say samefag. You really are a shitposter.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So was it ever determined if things like mirror sunglasses could block Lelouch's Geass? Cause his helmet had the little slidey eyehole to allow shenanigans. <br><br>It's because you need direct eye contact.</br></br></br>  Wouldn't a blind person whose Geass gives them Zatoichi-level super senses be the strongest user since no one Geass (aside from Mao's) can affect him?  <br><br>HOLY SHIT HE SAMEFAGGED AGAIN HAHA<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you'd be safe with Lelouch's one - without accidentally ordering mass-murder - as long as you were bright enough to either a) wear sunglasses or b) cosplay as a pirate 24/7?</br>  <br> That douchebag who always wears his $300 hipster sunglasses inside' <br>Shut up anon, sunglasses are cool.</br></br>  <br><br>Or you know, don't look at him when he talks to you.</br></br>  <br>I guess there's no point in responding to you. You've provided absolutely no genuine rebuttal. Instead, you shout samefag at the top of your lungs in order to disrupt any type of legitimate discussion.<br><br>Nice, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Monkey's paw wish, anon. Eventually their senses would become overbearing. They'd flinch at the slightest sound or feel pain from the slightest touch, etc.</br>  <br>I know this is weak tier Ad Hominem bait, but I'm still willing to argue about her being useful to the plot.<br><br>Lelouch didn't just suddenly choose to kill the entire Geass order because he felt like it.<br>The Geass only caused suffering to him and those around him, Shirley's death after Lelouch finally accepting his feelings towards her and vice-versa was the driving point that caused him to go berserk. I'm not doing shipfaggotry or any of that, I'm just retelling the events as they happened</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How come Charles got no downsides to his Geass?</br></br>  <br>I meant if YOU were the one with Lelouch's power. The average person wouldn't think to look away just because someone's iris is purple. You just generally wouldn't want to accidentally cause a genocide because you took off your sunnies to wipe them and didn't put them back on before going on to explain in detail what Hitler should've done to cleanse the human race.</br>  <br><br><br> changing the argument from "Shirley is the only character Lelouch had feelings for" to "Shirley was important" <br><br>Obvious jonautist corner cutting plebbit tier arguments here.<br><br>Go update your blog</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he's a shitposter, I doubt he'll actually respond to you with any legitimate counterpoints.<br><br>I'll never understand why people are so against Shirley. It's almost as if any discussion of her makes people upset.</br></br></br>  <br>Hell yeah I would. <br><br>There is literally zero downside. The worst that can happen is that I become a Witch? Warlock? Wizard? Whatever the male version of a Code Holder is called. <br><br>I am now Immortal until I pass on my code, I then fuck around until I get bored and then immediately ruin the world by giving as many poor people as possible a Geass each, throwing the world into chaos and increasing my chances of finding someone who can take my code if I want to die. <br><br>Here's hoping for C.C's Geass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's the only one actually adding to the discussion here. You're just being a faggot.</br>  <br>He likely did, we just weren't too exposed to it. The apathy toward the current world might have been part of it, as his Geass dealt with the past and memories. He was so focused on the past that he didn't care if half his children died at the hands of the Black Knights in the battle of Tokyo.</br>  <br><br>Probably because she's the worst female character in the show and triggers people's PTSD for a certain character<br><br>Also this is a C.C. thread, not a Shirley thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know once your Geass becomes too powerful you can just trade it in for a Code, right?<br><br>Feels like immortality could come in handy in a bunch of ways.</br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty much what that contact lenses shenanigans was for, quick access/blocking of the Geass</br>  <br>That would be a pretty hellish existance for someone who was blind, though. They'd have gone from extreme senses to being essentially crippled in that sense of the word. <br><br>Plus, now they'd be immortal and forever cursed with the results.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty funny, Orihime and Shirley are my two favorite female anime characters. How fun.</br>  <br><br>The cancer has been spotted</br></br>  <br> worst character in the show <br>I'm not entirely sure you understand the definition of the word worst, anon.<br><br>Also, what are you even talking about? People can't discuss Shirley because it upsets a few people?</br></br></br></br>  <br> That would be a pretty hellish existance for someone who was blind, though. <br><br>Well I meant in general with the whole monkey's paw thing.<br><br>Though if you're immortal, eventually people will develop electronic implants for your eyes, which you'll totally be alive to benefit from.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> worst female character <br><br>Completely a matter of taste, I'd personally choose Nina or  NANI MAI HUNNI <br><br>No arguing that C.C. is the best one though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Great contribution.<br><br>I love how summer /a/ thinks threads are about sick burns and trolling each other. September can't come soon enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does that make me cancer?<br><br>Both of those characters are attractive, plus they both have enjoyable personalities.<br><br>I'm sorry that people liking characters upsets you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Baiting C.C. lovers in a C.C. thread with Shirley shitposting <br><br>Wow this is like 2007 all over again. you forgot your trip this time</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess that is true. Still, they'd have to wait a long time as a blind person again after having seen a much better existence.<br><br>It really goes either way with this, though. I guess you found the one Geass that can be overcome. <br><br> Technically Lelouch overcame the weakness of his Geass too, though, now that I think of it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> talking about a character is shitposting <br><br>I'm glad that discussing a character is equated to shitposting.</br></br></br>  Not going to lie, while immortality would suck after a while, you could become a literal God and/or head of a fanatical death cult devoted to you. It'd be interesting to see how humanity plays out, and you could manipulate it as much or as little as you wanted.<br><br>People don't want to listen or pay attention to you? That's alright, you have forever to get more charismatic. Can't strong-arm people to do what you want? Work on you gainz for several centuries. Become a literal master in everything you ever decide to turn your mind to. Then when you're bored, find someone, give them the Geass, and use your near-infinite wisdom to help them quickly and easily achieve their goal/complete the contract.</br></br>  <br>Talking about a character isn't shitposting.<br>Talking about a character I dislike IS shitposting, though</br></br>  <br> I guess you found the one Geass that can be overcome. <br><br>Because it doesn't actually GIVE you anything, it just makes up for a disadvantage you have.</br></br></br>  <br>You could also get convicted for a crime wrongly and be stuck in prison for eternity.</br>  <br>Hadn't thought of it that way.</br>  <br>  Eternity <br>Make a breakout attempt. What are they going to do, put you in jail? Electric chair? Get all frazzled, come back, and make another break for it. Sooner or later, you'll be in a prison and the reason for you being there will be long-forgotten by everyone.</br></br>  <br>So CC's love geass would just be making up for my own social ineptitude?</br>  <br>If you live for a long time under supervision, someone would ask questions. You'd likely get taken as a test subject and submitted to painful experiments for the rest of your life just to see what you are.</br>  <br>You're immortal, why do you care? It's basically just an extended nap in the grand scheme of your lifespan.</br>  <br>Immortality is already boring, anon. Jail is even more fucking boring than immortality.</br>  <br><br>Walk out of the prison, get shot and declared dead, come back to life and play dead in the morgue until closing time then leave on a truck.<br><br>Or if you're REALLY patient, wait until walls of the prison are destroyed by erosion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>From the time of your capture to the heat death of the universe, there will be SOME point for you to escape, whether that's jacking a guard's pistol and fighting your way out or going all Solid Snake. When you have several billion years to make escape attempts, the odds are in your favour.</br>  <br> trying to discuss main character's most important love interest <br> automatically trip fag <br>Nice.</br></br></br>  <br> From the time of your capture to the heat death of the universe <br> immortality means you survive it <br> as per comic book rules, as the sole survivor of the universe's destruction, you are the Galactus of the new universe </br></br></br>  <br>End up like EMIYA 2.0 or Kerry 2.0?</br>  <br><br>Do you not remember how obnoxious the shirley shills were?<br><br>I hope you don't</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or you could be accidentally buried alive before you revive.<br><br>Trust me, anon, immortality is one of those ultimate double-edge swords.<br><br><br>Dear god, can you even imagine how fucking boring immortality would be in a universe having gone through heat death? You'd literally have nothing to do. Or worse off, you'd have gotten sucked into a black hole and would be stuck in extremely hot conditions for the rest of eternity because of the time dilation effects.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you continue to live now because you know you're going to die at some point?<br><br>I'm going to assume you're enjoying life currently for the purposes of this discussion. <br><br>Does knowing you're going to die at any moment make your life better in any way?<br><br>The way I see it, if you're being a pessimist about immortality then you're doing it wrong. You've got an infinite amount of time and a way out, you can do what you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  Hanging around long enough to survive the heat death of the universe means you get to become the God of the next one <br><br>That would be fucking sick.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you got tired of immortality, you could always give someone a geass so they can take your code</br></br>  <br>I still don't understand why people discussing Shirley, a character that the main character indisputably loved, is considered shit posting.<br><br>I'm sorry that people upset you with the discussion of her. I really am.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone mentioned heat death of the universe. Being bored for all time is even worse than death. Your mind wouldn't be able to withstand that.</br>  <br>Does the way out require another human to pass it to?<br><br>If so, what if there's no one left to pass it to? Who knows how many of us would have the will to persist even after the heat death of this universe.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you could be stuck outside the new universe because a new big bang would make space expand exponentially from the beginning point, putting you forever outside the new universe's reach.<br><br><br>Not if you wait billions of years like some anons in this thread are saying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You've got plenty of time before that. You can always shotgun enough people with Geass Powers that at least one of them would fulfill the contract. <br><br>There's nothing stating you even have to live a long life, you could choose to have a short life but take full advantage of the immortality to become a real life Big Boss.</br></br></br>  <br>See my point here. </br>  <br>Hell, does it require another human? If not, just float around in space, continuously dying, reviving and dying again until you crash on a planet with life, and pass it onto them, even if they can't understand you.<br><br>Dunno how it would work if said beings didn't have eyes.<br><br><br>Spend eternity figuring out how to create matter from nothing. It's not like you won't have the time to figure out how to make the laws of physics bend over and spread 'em.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Immortality is tricky anon. It's always a tricky subject. Human life becomes long after so many years. Old people are generally not that afraid to die even.</br>  <br> real life Big Boss <br><br>Well, Lelouch did achieve that without immortality, I can't see how much harder that would be with limitless time in your hands</br></br></br>  <br>Asimov pls, just because you're immortal doesn't mean you're going to figure out how to bend the laws of physics. You'd have to have the tools for that, and if you're suffering through heat death, you'd eventually have to deal with all the matter you're interacting with turning into liquid from quantum tunneling, matter decaying from proton decay, or everything in the universe turning into iron-56 nuclei. No matter what happens, your technology and possibly even your own body would be fucked.</br>  <br> Dunno how it would work if said beings didn't have eyes. <br><br>You don't give Geass through eye contact, you do it through touch</br></br></br>  <br>Then live a short life and just do everything you can. <br>Don't even do what C.C and the other did by dedicating themselves to a larger goal. That'll just end up poorly. <br><br>Spend your entire time planning a bank heist, get paid and then get on a bender. <br>Sell your organs for money and let them regrow. <br>Take up Boxing, you'll never get brain damage no matter how often you get punched in the head.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But how would eyeless alien use the Geass?</br>  <br>That's quite the ass grab.</br>  <br>I mean going around on the battlefield with just yourself and On-site Procuring of weapons and items while singlehandedly winning a war.</br>  <br><br>A man knows what they want</br></br>  <br><br>So NoN Lelouch?</br></br>  <br><br> that one finger inside of her panties <br><br>hnnnnng. He needs to slip a few fingers inside her pussy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If not, just float around in space, continuously dying, reviving and dying again until you crash on a planet with life, and pass it onto them, even if they can't understand you. <br>Welcome to a premise of getting powers from nothing.  Because it may have come from an immortal who finally found their way out. </br></br>  <br>You don't have the advantage of super strength but yeah, basically.</br>  <br><br>C.C. is blushing</br></br>  <br><br>When you have the power to remotely control KMFs at will, the super strength is just a bonus</br></br>  You know, with so much time up your sleeve, you could just become that eccentric multi-trillionaire. You won't have to do anything behind the scenes, because you'll be able to say "Look, I know my checkbook is written on A3 paper, but it's still not big enough to fit all the zeros on. So are you SURE we can't work out away to get this genocide charge dropped, officer?"  <br>A pretty sweet bonus not to be ignored. Super Strength is highly underrated amongst super powers. <br><br>Everyone always picks metahax or super speed but Super Strength is straight up one of the best of the basics.</br></br></br>  <br>As long as you can control it even while under stressed. As nice as it would be, I think there'd be an issue with literally putting your fist through a Chad's skull and wrenching his spine out through his mouth.</br>  <br>Yeah but all powers come with that issue generally unless it's passive like Immortality.</br>  Seriously but, for most people here, if someone like C.C offered you a power and decided to follow you until you fulfilled some contract, you'd spend most of your time plowing her rather than actually doing anything contract-related.  <br><br>precisely. It's a wonder Lelouch got anything done. But we all know he had his midnight fun with her.</br></br>  <br>Your point being?</br>  All this talk of immortality reminds me of someone...  <br><br> A-Anon, it's been eight times already. Sh-shouldn't you be -ah!- working on fulfilling our contract? </br></br>  <br> you'd spend most of your time plowing her rather than actually doing anything contract-related <br><br>You'd think that but knowing /a/'s luck, she'd deny us sex until we get a Geass to a sufficient level. <br><br>She's the hard mode route compared to the Shirley Easy and Kallen Normal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Baby you know you love it</br></br>  <br>  Deny us sex <br>You seriously just need to be stronger than her and you could keep her contained. She has no face when it comes to police or the outside world, by and large. You could keep her in a basement with no one any the wiser.</br></br>  <br>Shirley isn't easy mode though. She'd want to get married right away.</br>  <br> Raping C.C. <br><br>Get the fuck off the internet, Mao. Don't make me make you compact.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You're sick<br><br>Especially since all she wants is to be loved for real</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pffft, yeah, cause I'm the only one here thinking it <br><br>With any luck, you wouldn't need to, anyway.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Shi Tsu, you have been a loyal accomplice up until now, do not disappoint me!</br></br>  <br>Sorta what Mao did, he plowed her until she got bored and wandered off somewhere else</br>  <br>So she's tutorial mode then? <br><br><br> With luck <br> Luck <br> /a/ <br><br>There's the issue. /a/ is forever bad luck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  You sign the contact <br>  The randomly generated Geass power is... <br>  You shit yourself whenever you look into someone's eyes <br>  /a/ does it again </br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds about right. <br><br>If /a/'s Geass was personality based and not forever bad luck we'd probably get something which puts the target in an illusion of their best dreams so /a/ could be with their ideal version of their waifus.</br></br></br>  <br>  Everyone else gets to be with their perfect waifu <br>  Except you <br>  Everyone you look at gets happier <br>  Except you <br><br> And none of the Shin no Ippou mirror bullshit, that doesn't work </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Since mangafags are already spoiling the shit out of this new show and the animation is AWFUL, I thought I might as well read it.<br><br>So far so good, but why the fuck is she spraying a zombie with the fire extinguisher?<br><br>Anyways, discuss Gakkou Gurashi!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Since mangafags are already spoiling the shit out of this new show and the animation is AWFUL, I thought I might as well read it. <br> So far so good, but why the fuck is she spraying a zombie with the fire extinguisher? <br> Anyways, discuss Gakkou Gurashi! <br><br>we've already discussed all there is to discuss. just wait till next week, god. this isn't your blog.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But what about the fire extinguisher?</br></br>  <br> the animation is AWFUL </br>   I'm an anime only faggot and I expect everyone to treat me like a special snowflake and stop discussing the manga so I don't get spoiled.    Implying the anime will be anything like the manga. <br><br>It's like you didn't even watch the first episode.<br><br>At this point, it's so different that reading the manga might not even spoil anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not OP but i do hope that at least those chapters of Megu-nee stay the same, those were pure gold</br>  <br><br>Stop putting words on my mouth or I will put my dick in yours.<br><br><br><br>It seemed to be well animated at first, then for the most part was awful, then it got good again right at the very end.<br><br>It looks as if the studio was tight on the budget.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It looks as if the studio was tight on the budget. <br>They're animating three shows (that trap shit, monster harem shit, and this).</br></br>  <br>What if the helicopter pilot makes it in the anime and they escape to safety?<br><br>Also, who's going to translate the Korean or Chinese chapters?</br></br></br>  Since miki is already there first episode, I'm hoping they skip around the timeline to show her introduction. That way you can keep people guessing when the episode is taking place and between yuki-delusions and flashbacks.  <br>See: </br>  Megu-nee turning was really heavy for some reason<br><br>so even after turning zombie they retain their sanity in the first moments?<br>that's fucking awful oh god</br></br></br>  <br>because they all cray, also kurumi is dead</br>  <br> even after turning zombie they retain their sanity in the first moments <br>They retain parts of their mind even further, as they come to the places they used to love.</br></br>  <br>So Kurumi's parents are alive somewhere then?</br>   Rii goes to school to find her imouto <br> brings back a teddybear with a smile on her face </br>  <br>On boy</br>  <br>Maybe they died. And to think of it, isn't it strange that children come to school, not their houses? Inb4 japanese are fucked up.</br>  <br>it's not impossible that deel died of suffering while trying to translate the next two chapter</br>  <br> isn't it strange that children come to school, not their houses? <br>oh this is really fucked</br></br>  <br>I don't want to go full blogshit, but I can actually relate</br>  <br>Well, japanese kids do spend a lot of time in school, moreover if they are children is like their second house, so that's that, but i do still believe that Rii's sister is the goddamn teddy bear</br>  <br>R.I.P Based Deel, we'll remember you for the great little girl you were</br>  <br> Her real imouto turns up, she wasn't dead <br> Rii kills her because mindbreak </br></br>  <br>no because in the cases of disasters and emergenices, schools usually have disaster zones which are located near or inside school grounds.</br>  <br><br>He's on vacation</br></br>  <br>  Rii's imouto wasnt dead but covered in blood and couldn't speak for fear <br>  Rii's state of mind is beyond help in actual world <br>  Seeing what she did she enters in a mental state of denial <br>  Grabs teddy bear trying forcing herself to think its her sister <br>And then you have to spoiler where she's grabbing something in the darkness like a psycho</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least when he cames back from vacation we'll have 2/3 chapters in a row, or so i want to believe</br>  <br>So what, the Infected in The Last of Us are occasionally crying as they chew on you. It's a common enough zombie trope. Still disturbing, but if you've seen it enough..</br>  <br> playing movies </br>  <br>It's kind of ironic how that love made shovel doomed.</br>  Berserk Chino when?  <br>And worst things will come, says the bible</br>   mangafags spoilering most of their spoilers surprisingly <br> mangafags spoiled the shit out of this show <br>What?<br><br>Also if you're talking about the twist, that shit was known already since this manga was dumped on /a/ when it was first scanlated, and I think quite a few of the descriptions of the show already spoiled it so you didn't actually need to read the manga to know that. <br><br>Also the manga is on chapter 35+ so obviously it's going to be spoiled a bit, just like how the first episode of the anime is by people who only watched the anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The fanart's really starting to pick up, thankfully.  <br>Still needs more Mii-kun.</br>  gurl walks into classroom im laffin<br>i ask her wtf is she talkin to<br>its tomodachi<br>but im sad cuz i cant talk to them<br>i wish i was diejoubu</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know which is best girl yet.

Like spraying water on them from a hose or playing an annoying sound?</br></br>  <br><br> Liking a mental patient <br>Well, if that's what your heart tells you</br></br></br>  <br>It's about time.</br>  I want to impregnate Rii-san!  <br><br>Crazy or not, who can resist this body.</br></br>  <br> I-I just wanted to talk, maybe have a drink together. <br> tfw cute girls attack you when you try to hit on them. </br></br>  <br> Useless bags of fat. </br>  <br> Useless <br> In a world that needs repopulation <br><br>I bet you like one of the girls that can't even give birth properly, you useless piece of shit.<br><br>I will marry Rii-san and make her my loving housewife.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd take my chances</br>  <br>Got a picture of her in pajamas?<br><br>I remember her wearing those tight shorts that make me go crazy.</br></br></br>    <br> repopulation <br> implying men are allowed to exist in that world </br></br>  <br> males <br> in MY yuri world <br>NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOpe</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine a male character popping up, corrupting shovel or Yuki-chan.</br>  <br>The girls almost died and<br><br>save them , so she's the best<br>Second is shovel.<br>Third is pretending.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, if you would.</br>  <br>It's probably bait, since the show is not yuri at all, but just to be sure:<br><br>And don't come to shit on our threads again please.<br><br><br>Kurumi liked a man, males appear in chapter 36 and 37 too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> i not read the manga <br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br> Kurumi liked a man <br>She is a slut. She wants to sell her used goods to Mii-kun.</br></br>  <br>There aren't any hints of romance between them, please fuck off to </br>  <br>Two  guys chased them with their car. </br>    <br>You're gonna carry that  shovel. </br>  <br> guoh <br> That panic sweats coming out of the zombies <br>That's kinda cute</br></br></br>  They really just let a delusional girl run around an abandoned school all day and sit in an empty classroom talking to no one?  The last shot of the show is gonna be   Miki's note to Kei,   right?  Just read the whole thing, when do new chapters come out?<br><br>That loli is too pristine.</br></br>  <br>Yuki-chan heals their ailing mind.</br>  <br> loli <br> That's not a loli. </br></br>  <br>Yes, because if they didn't they'd also crack from the stress. With Yuki going full-retard, they at least have something to get their minds off of the harsh reality of their situation. It's for Yuki's sake too, I guess.</br>  <br>Anon, I...</br>  Is it known if the whole country is experiencing a pandemic or is it just the town itself? <br><br>People said that the test was a failure, but did shit hit the fan or is it a contained failure? Because if it isn't why haven't the girls blown the coop out of town?</br></br>  <br>Well they haven't gotten any long range radio signals</br>  <br><br>That's bad news man, I don't know how to feel about that. I imagine stations within their proximity could have been forced off the air by umbrella corp.</br></br>  <br> but did shit hit the fan or is it a contained failure? <br>Considering the government/Randall Corp is sending infected pilots, it's probably the latter, unfortunately.<br><br>They're staying because they want to know why the outbreak occurred (go to the university to find a connection between it and their school, then go to the Randall Corp building to discover the source of the pandemic, then probably offer assistance to whoever is trying to find a cure afterward).</br></br></br></br>  What is this shit. I thought that pink haired chick was just retarded. But shes also delusional?  The power of secondaries<br>This is the audience this shit is bringing in.<br>It won't be long until they start shitting up the threads<br>Or have they already?</br></br></br>  <br>Keep reading if you haven't.<br><br><br>Youtube is a special kind of retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop feeding the fire.</br>  <br>Theres more complaints about people shitting up the thread than actual people shitting up threads.<br><br>Why the fuck would you even come to ANY type of discussion if you feel that it will be shit? Just watch the fucking show and enjoy it. People who drop shows based on their fanbase are the true retards here.</br></br></br>  <br><br>THIS<br><br>STOP POSTING SHIT ABOUT THREADS GOING TO SHIT</br></br></br></br>  <br>People complaining is mainly about "my taste &gt; your taste, so you are shitposting". And they are always the most vocal. So stop posting shit about threads going to shit.</br>  <br><br>?<br><br>I'm talking about imouto-chan, what am I missing here?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Again.<br><br>Anon...</br></br></br>  <br> Look at her appearance, then look at Yuki's bear at the start of the chapter. </br>      <br>The girls this artist draws are so damn cute and hot and plump.</br>  <br>Well let's be fair, she didn't want her friend to become a zed in front of her eyes</br>  <br>That's not a girl, though.</br>  <br><br>But cute imoutos anon, you can't break my delusions like that.</br></br>  <br> that two in one filename <br>Ya done good Anon, ya done good.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Explain this then from the previous chapter. <br><br>Just there to fuck with you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That just means she didn't even trust Miki.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>It's safe to assume the whole world is in trouble. They've been there long enough that the US military would've killed all the zombies by now if there wasn't any shit going down outside Japan.</br>  <br>Yup.</br>   yfw Rii never had a little sister at all   Is the emergency manual ever gonna get translated?  <br> Rii-san was actually an only child <br> Her only way of coping with the madness was to create a little sister <br> Little did she know manifesting and convincing her mind that something she's never had exists was another step deeper into insanity </br></br></br>  What'cha doing there, Kei?  <br>I also think it's widespread, but there may or may not be shelters everywhere. It could just be a localized area that got safety measures.</br>  <br>I what they're gonna do about Kei in the anime. Will they even address her?</br>  <br>Inevitably.</br>  <br>*I wonder what</br>  Shovel reminds of this girl. It must be the twintails.  <br>She's riddled with despair. It doesn't look like she'll get her happy ending.  ;_; </br>  <br>What's this one?</br>  <br>That reaction of hers made that doujin one of my favourites.</br>  <br> he doesn't know where that's from </br>  They're all best girls.  <br>But my waifu is the bestest.</br>   http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/66<wbr>014</wbr> <br><br>Manga got a good sales boost. Season 2 when?</br></br>  <br>All bestest.</br>  <br> http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/66<wbr>014</wbr> <br><br>That's terrific, but I'm still cautious. I remember when that awful Vanadis adaptation came out, all the books went straight to the best sellers list, and the anime both was shit and sold like shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But the Vanadis anime didn't cause as much of a stir as Gakkou Gurashi's first episode. GG easily had the one of the best first episodes of the season.</br></br>  <br>Very happy to see this. That guarantees that the manga won't be cancelled any time soon. Maybe I've been overly worried though, I mean you don't normally give anime adaptions to series that are in danger of being cancelled.</br>   just read all the translated chapters <br><br>Shovel will be daijobu, right?</br></br>  <br><br>I really hope that stir sticks around. I'm really paranoid about it not doing well since I'm hearing so much praise for the first episode. I'd hate to get my hopes up and then disappointed.</br></br>  <br><br>I want to see crazy Rii animated. Especially the one of her at the elementary school.</br></br>   Ep 1 views still rising on niconico <br>Neat.</br>  <br><br>I like what I'm hearing.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure I fapped to it but can't remember.</br>  <br><br>We'll at least get Shovel's incident stuff. Plenty of her losing it</br></br>  <br><br>The anime better do this scene justice.</br></br>  <br>Sometimes anime doing poorly in terms of advertising the manga has spelled doom for the manga. This doesn't seem to be the case here though.</br>  Umaru vs Kurumi in a zombie killing contest, who wins?  <br>sounds unfair<br>Umaru can't die</br></br>  <br>RIP C3-bu</br>  <br>Hopefully Gainax finally learned their lesson and will stop injecting pointless metaphysical bullshit into SoL series. Or better yet just stop making anime altogether.</br>  <br>Depends on how they manage the huge amount of flashbacks they need to have, we can only hope they do them in such a way that they don't bore the anime audience.<br><br><br>As I said fuck off to </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm hoping it just goes the way the manga did from chapter two on, with the caveat that the first episode is set just after miki arrives.</br></br>    <br>I miss Twilight Zone.</br>  <br><br>Oh I remember this. Wasn't this an actual thing from Garfield too?</br></br>  <br>Damn, Jim Davis.</br>  <br>That might explain the low quality, but it doesn't make it justified. Low quality is low quality, whether there's a reason or not.</br>  Does anyone have the Korean raws? I have a friend who might be able to translate.  <br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336</br>  <br>Just looking around on the archive for a bit gave me ch 37<br>http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>452324</wbr></br></br>  <br> http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336 <br><br><br>Sent it over to him. I'll post it straight here if he's able.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So is she better or worse off if Yuki hadn't left the bear there to begin with? Would she have given up and come back, or just kept searching until she got killed?</br>  <br>The latter. Yuki leaving the teddy bear saved her from getting killed by stupidity and letting the zombies of the classroom loose.</br>  <br>I don't know. She probably would have just projected her sister onto something else instead, like a zombie for example.<br><br>I'm more excited to see how Yuki acts with the tables completely turned like this. She's the reliable one now and Yuuri has the crazys.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh fuck fuck, dinosaur anus said he'd translate. It might just be chapter 36, because I don't want to ask too much, but shit man we'll be able to read it soon.</br></br>  <br>When did the teddy bear show up and what was the context? I don't rememeber it too well.</br>  <br>Reread the manga.</br>  <br>The bear did a brief appearance before the graduation, don't remeber which chapter. Then it appeared in Ch 35 when they entered into a elementary school looking for survivors and Yuki thought it'd be a bait for kids.</br>  <br>Don't have the time for that. I would if I could.</br>  <br>Well in a sense I guess it was  imouto pedobait </br>  I just noticed Yuki's sleeping bag is the bear, too.<br><br>Would be hilarious to see Rii-san mistake a sleeping Yuki for her sister.</br></br>  <br>Yuki is quite possibly the cutest character I've ever seen.</br>  <br>It's also in episode 1 of the anime, which was made before that chapter came out, so you can at least tell it was there from the start.</br>  <br>Did they actually end up rigging that together? Also, I'm suspending my belief, but my own car battery dies pretty quickly after not being used for a few weeks, so any time I see a story where they just start a car that hasn't been touched in months it just makes me do a double take.</br>  <br>I'm...so...hungry</br>  I went into this blind, /a/.<br><br>What. The. Fuck.<br><br> Please hold me. </br></br></br></br>  <br>annoying sounds would most likely catch even more attention to a hoard of zombies</br>  <br>I love you all, so why won't you open the door?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Legit gook here. I can translate this shit RIGHT NOW if you want me to, if you just send me the raws. Problem with marumaru is that I can't save any of the images there, and I'm not willing to go so far as to screencap every single page and cut it out.<br><br>So, just provide me with an easy-to-edit raw and I'll literally get it done in like, 40 minutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In firefox, right click &gt; view page info &gt; media.

Eat your heart out, Murata</br></br>  <br>Oldest yes but Yuki is the one who actually is the "rock" and keeps everyone else going batshit insane.</br>  <br>No-pan whore. She's probably already lost her virginity to shovel-kun too.</br>  <br>And thus the cycle begins again</br>  <br> How are we going to get those stains out of the bear? </br>  <br>Ritz would be proud</br>  <br>You mean walnut-kun</br>  <br> Auditory hallucinations <br>It just gets worse.

Its a been a while since I remembered this series existed. I think it was about the time that Magical Girl gore porn one was popular on /a/ that I had read it.</br>  <br>i miss that series so much.<br>it was hilarious to follow.</br></br>  <br>If you mean Mahou Shoujo of the End then I found those in the same thread too. I read through both the same day and was fucking astounded by how hilariously awful Mahou Shoujo of the End was and how much I enjoyed reading Gakkou Gurashi.</br>    <br>Jesus Christ that ear.</br>  <br>The last I saw of that was three people holding hands and two walking out. I wonder where it went after.</br>      I'm starting to think the author is just one step ahead of us and is making us think Ruu is the bear, when actually she really is Yuuri's sister. Is he trolling us or am I drunk? I don't know what to think anymore.  <br>I'll just have to think thats Kagami on screen when I watch this.<br><br>  Lucky star s2 when........ one can dream  </br></br></br>  <br> Yuki without the hat <br><br>What's gonna happen now?!</br></br></br>  <br>Awww so cute, she's hugging her teddy bear.</br>  <br>Rape cop was the best character in that mostly for the fact he was competent about his shit.</br>  <br>It's the fucking bear dude Jesus.</br>  <br>Isn't that Miki?</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128011964 <br>That's Yuki.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128011964 <br>That's Yuki, not Miki.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128011964 <br>But that's Yuki.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128011964 <br>She's not Mii-kun</br>  <br> Its actually her sister but she's a zombie. Her mouth has been bound which is why she can't speak but has a muffled scream. </br>  <br>No, Yuki's hair is parted down the middle. Miki's isn't.</br>    <br>Truly the strength of a mother  bear </br>  <br>yeah rage cop was hilarious, holy hell.</br>  <br>She even has a little bear bag.</br>  <br>Miki's hair isn't toned like that. Yuki's is</br>  <br>KUMA SHOCK</br>    <br>That fuck Miku wears garter belt?</br>  <br>Damn, shovel is so Operator.</br>  <br>Well yeah but I didn't want anyone saying "it could just be the shadows making it look darker".<br><br>Either way, my point is that it's Yuki and not Miki.</br></br></br>    <br>My little Anonymous cannot be this  fucking blind holy shit </br>  <br>You only just noticed?</br>  <br>u wot m8</br>  <br>How are you just now seeing this?</br>  <br>Rii is the bear.

Kurumi is asking because Miki said she's not sure how to act around kids. What Miki means by this is that she's not sure how to pretend there is a kid there.<br><br>4. Nope.<br><br>5.
