[ If we post enough of Asuka-chan moot will come back to us.  Who?  <br>Asuka. Its that girl from Evangelion.</br>  <br>moot still owns the site anon. <br>Which means even if you don't see him posting he's still calling the shots. <br>The reason this board is going to shit is because moot is still in charge.</br></br></br>  Posting best grill  <br>Why is he so perfect?</br>    <br>He's the biggest faggot in the show after Shinji.</br>  ''best''  <br>Indeed.</br>  <br>I want to cum on his glasses</br>  <br>Anyone who likes such a garbage character can go and stay gone as far as I'm concerned.</br>  <br>I want to break his glasses and then buy him a new pair</br>    <br>I want to force him to eat his cum-covered glasses</br>  <br>I want to slit his throat and shit in his mouth as he bleeds to death</br>  <br>Reminder that Kensuke literally has AIDS</br>  <br>He has GLASSES AIDS</br>  Why is her design so god tier though?  <br>Aids protruding from his GLASSES</br>  <br> 777 <br>Trips of perfection.</br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Because it's literally the only redeeming factor she has.</br>  <br>Kensuke is probably the most influential Eva character of the Towa period.</br>  <br>Kensuke is probably the most influential Eva character ever.</br>  <br>Kensuke is love, Kensuke is life.</br>  <br>Reminder that moot was last seen in a Planetes thread.</br>  <br>I think it's more because Sadamoto struck gold</br>  <br>That's not Kensuke you fucking nerd</br>  <br> you will never stick your dick in Kensuke's glasses <br>Why even bother living</br></br>  <br>Stop shitting up my Kensuke Appreciation thread you stupid faggot</br>  <br>POST K E N S U K E<br>O<br>S<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>French Kensuke is best Kensuke.</br>  <br>Kensookay</br>  <br>Kensuckayy</br>    <br>japkensuke</br>    Kensuke? More like KensuGAY  Fucking reifaggots, man.    <br>Kensuke is the straightest, realest nigga. He sells videos of his dick for money.</br>    <br>Kensuke a shit.</br>    <br>Ayy, yo fuck you Touji. Stupid cockass nigga.</br>  <br><br><br>At least Kensuke still has both his arms and legs.</br></br></br>  Abandon thread.  <br>That's the same fujoshit that hijacked an Asuka thread yesterday ain't it? And then was being butthurt in the other eva thread up.</br>  <br><br>Nah, fuck you. Touji best grill. This is now a TOUJI APPRECIATION THREAD.</br></br>    <br>KENSUKEFAGS NOT WELCOME.</br>  <br>He did this same thing in an Asuka thread a while back too. These threads are cancer anyway though.</br>  Isn't Kensuke the oddman out? Jock has freckles girl. Shinji has painful strangulation girl. <br><br>Who does glasses have?</br></br>  <br>KENSUKE A MAJOR SHIT.</br>  I want to watch evangelion. I really can't find the best subs and the /a/ wiki says nothing... So i'm kneeling in front of you /a/autists<br> tell me the best subs for the best anime ever, onegai </br>  <br> still clinging to the fujoshit boogeyman <br>You're just booty blasted that you Asukafaggots can't maintain your own thread.</br></br>  <br>Touji is the REALEST NIGGA.</br>  <br>Damn, he is an asshole. An asshole and a huge faggot.</br>  <br>Download [2D4U].<br>There. Fucking retard.</br></br>  <br>HE'S ALSO BEST GRILL, KENSUKE IS WORST GRILL. FITE ME FAGGOTS.</br>  <br><br>if I post Rei will moot stay away?</br></br>  <br>Which episode is this, I don't remember this.</br>  <br> backpedaling after saying you were assblasted about Asuka threads <br>Dis fujoshit.</br></br>   thread overrun by Toujifags <br>You faggots always do this shit. Everytime I try to have a nice peaceful Kensuke thread you fuckers have to ruin it. Your waifu is A LOSER WHO GOT HIS LEG CHOPPED OFF. KENSUKE WON THE SHINJIBOWL, SO DEAL WITH IT YOU AUTISTIC RETARDS.</br>  <br>Fuck off, Kensuke is an EMOTIONLESS DOLL. Touji is feisty and hot and has a great ass. The superior waifu is pretty much every way.</br>  <br>You know, you don't have to invade an Asuka thread and spam like a retard, go make your own thread.</br>  <br>Unlike Kensukeshit, Touji actually has a fucking character and is way hotter than Kensuke. Touji is superior waifu, moot and Anno agreed; don't bother them about it.</br>   that landwhale from yesterday is so anally rekt they will argue with themselves <br>Anno didn't die for this</br>  <br>Also Touji won the Shinjibowl, not Kensuke you stupid faggot. Sasuga Kensukecucks.</br>  <br>Kensukecucks don't even understand how deep Eva is, so they choose the shallowest fucking character as best grill. What a fucking joke. NO ONE FUCKING LIKES KENSUKE, EVERYONE LIKES TOUJI MORE. Kensuke is literally a meme waifu with no character and depth and backstory whatsoever.</br>  <br>Also Touji's dub VA is LITERALLY HIS OWN WAIFU; HOW FUCKING EPIC IS THAT? Literally the best waifu. Stupid shitty emotionless doll Kensuke can't even compare.</br>  <br>There's a reason why Kensuke was replaced with Kensuke Q in 3.0. It's because HE SUCKS. No one in Japan wants him in the movies so they fucking replaced him with a clone that ended up being more likable than he ever was! IF YOU ACTUALLY LIKE POKA POKA KENSUKE GO FUCK YOURSELF. Touji won the Shinjibowl in NGE, in the Manga, AND he'll win it in Rebuild too! He's simply perfect, and there's nothing you Kensukeshitters can do about it but cry.</br>  <br>Now I'm going to bed, and remember this Kensukecuckshitters: If I ever see you make another Kensuke thread again I'll fucking derail it with BEST WAIFU TOUJI MOTHERFUCKING SUZUHARA. Peace.</br>  He even copypasted exactly what he wrote a few weeks back. There's not even effort involved.  <br>Moot won´t come back until Third Impact.</br>  Where are the Asukafags at?<br>Lets end this gay shit already.</br>  I cry to myself every night while jacking off because no one loves me  <br>I´m with you good sir.</br>  <br>Nobody wants to get involved in the fujoshit's autism</br>  <br> tfw you don´t even love yourself </br>    I hate Asuka, she's ugly. But not as ugly as me :(  <br>Ooh, you leveled up! Have fun shitposting, I need to go do  not anime </br>  I want to have sexual relations with Bossuka.  <br>No she´s not.  ;_; </br>   fujos assblasted they will never be as perfect, beautiful or desirable as Asuka-chan <br>It must be a sad existence they live.</br>  <br>I only wish I could lift like her :(</br>  <br>Eyepatch Asuka, best Asuka.</br>  <br>If you stopped being such a useless shitposter you too can get a nice body.</br>  MUH DICK    seeing asuka smile like that makes me really happy, it´s just perfect  <br> his dick </br>  <br>Of course I've never really cared much about moot as a person, but I do have to be a bit thankful towards him considering he even bothered keeping this shitheap going at all, regardless of reCAPTCHA and other crap. I don't really miss him, but I do miss when he used to fuck with the board's format, like with BELIEVE IT, Komm susser tod, and Code Geass. Also, when he got drunk and shitposted, and Asuka's birthdays. Those were kind of fun.<br><br> Also, I summon this card from my deck, and it is a five. </br></br></br>  <br>More of Misato-san please</br>    <br>It can make you believe in miracles.</br>    <br>I don´t know who the retard was that though it would be a good idea to give Asuka blue clothing whatsoever but there you go.</br>  <br>Is this what the kiddies consider a nice body nowadays?</br>    <br>Who is this "moot" you're talking about OP?</br>    <br>Misato a whore, but I kinda like her anyway.</br>  <br>A landwhale like yourself would only be familiar with those.</br>    <br>no u<br><br>Asuka is a bitch, but I don't want to stir shit in your thread so<br><br>she also has no tits</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The founder of 9gag, he always wanted to be a little girl and marry Asuka.  but he can´t ;_; </br>    <br>I don't even like seafood. But at least I'm not a homosexual like yourself.</br>    <br>Ay mate, hold ya horses. I meant no disrespect. She is a very charismatic old hag.</br>  <br>Stop being fat and angry all over the thread goddamn<br>Go take a roll somewhere</br></br>    She´s looking at you anon.      <br>LITERALLY WHO?</br>         he will never hold her.     <br>Why would I want an SJW admin back?</br>  <br>What's wrong, anon-kun? Did I strike a nerv?</br>  <br> moot <br> SJW </br></br>  <br>Also, Asuka has the typical feminist phenotype without being a card carrying feminist - a selfish, mentally ill bitch.</br>  <br>They hugged for an eternity anon</br>  <br> this flapping pile of butthurt blubber is still managing to post <br>Impressive</br></br>  What if she was just slightly older, like 16 or 17 years old?    <br> times Shinji has held Asuka: 0 <br> times Shinji has held Rei: 1 <br>Checkmate atheists.</br></br></br>  <br>He is though.

My Takarajima (Treasure Island) animation cel arrived today. Cels from Takarajima are really hard to find. I've only been able to find one site that has them, they only had a small selection.  <br>Anime ja nai!</br>  <br>I never said it was.</br>  <br>Its Ple</br>  <br>I thought turn A was the masterpiece</br>  <br>I watched about 16 episodes, it's kinda stupid and the mecha designs are awful. At least Laura is cute.</br>  <br>Good to know the site's at least legit.</br>  <br>Don't you already have a few of these?<br><br>Anyways, they're not uncool. Congratulations on your finds.</br></br></br>  Can't stop thinking about this beauty.  <br>So many gatari characters, I don't know if I should buy them all or none at all.</br>  <br>How about you only buy Kissshot and Shinobu.</br>  <br>Right now I have both ougi and kiss-shot on preorder. You just gotta get both.</br>   moving out because you can't bear the shame of your figure collection of half naked women to your family   <br>I already preordered Kissshot. I'm considering Nadeko.</br>  I didn't see anything in the guide related to managing finances related to figure purchases. I was wondering how you guys keep track of how much you will owe per month and all that.<br><br>Thinking about making a simple Excel file, but I was curious to see if anyone here does anything different.</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate Ougi but this is really nice.<br><br>Such a strange conflict.</br></br></br>  <br> not hiding your figure collection in your closet in led lit deltofs </br>  But what if I only want GAR things?  <br> still living with your parents when buying that shit <br>damn you really fucked up</br></br>  <br>Nope, this is my first cel.<br><br><br>Yeah, they were pretty fast with shipping too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm the only one who thinks this will bin?<br><br>Just going by MFC numbers, there's 1k people with her on pre-order, then add the Japanse and the number can grow 3 times more or so, yet she's still available fucking everywhere. Kinda feel this is going to end up like Mikasa, shit ton of people with her, yet it never ran out of stock and now is selling for like 6k.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just display them anyway</br>  <br>whatever</br>  <br>Work is less than 30 minutes away and I live here rent free while paying student loans.<br><br>Seems dumb to move out. Besides the obvious shame.<br><br><br>Could try this.<br><br><br>You are a better man than I.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it might be a case of them overestimating the popularity and making too many, or it's just been SO LONG since it was announced nobody cares any more<br><br>... or they're just waiting for kizu to air then it'll be super popular - himouto stuff on amiami went from nothing to the 5 most popular spots after the first episode aired so it can happen if SHAFT actually fucking finish it</br></br></br>  <br>Even though you ask, it's not like there is any solid alternative to an Excel spreadsheet.<br><br>I recall many people here manage their orders on Excel. It's easy to make and use.</br></br></br>    Anybody else getting the pink version? I'd prefer the original version but I missed out on it. Pink hair looks alright to though.  <br>I used one for about a month and stopped. I don't see the point unless you spend a huge amount every month or are really poor.</br>  <br>who wants a gomora?</br>  Does anyone have experience with those $15-25 chinese knockoff oppai/butt mousepads form ebay?<br>Not expecting them to be anywhere near official ones, but are they at least serviceable?</br>  <br>Get the best one.</br>  <br>I like Ultraman, so this and the Baltan have me kind of tempted, but I don't collect girl figures.</br>  <br><br>I use Excel, I got a job exclusively to maintain this hobby, so it helps me keep track of how much am I going to spend each month and if I can spend more if anything goes up without warning.</br></br>  <br>How about you just buy an official one?</br>  <br><br>I don't known the character and I usually don't like male figures, but that one looks pretty cool.</br></br>  <br>Wow<br><br>super cute</br></br></br>  <br>I have the original, but I can't decide if I want to buy this one, or not.</br>  <br>It's just aesthetically pleasing, don't mind the the character.</br>  <br>the only official ones that interest me are in the hands of scalpers and cost about 3 times as much as I'm willing to pay.</br>  <br>How is the original anyways? Besides being over hyped, did it turn out alright?</br>  <br><br>Dat ass so phat, even the skirt clings to it.</br></br>  <br> did it turn out alright? <br><br>It turned out pretty great. <br><br>http://toy-navi.net/archives/441507<wbr>55.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they are probably made by the same chink as the official ones</br>  <br>That is super lewd.</br>  <br>Looks like I'm getting the strawberry version then.</br>   I missed preorders <br><br>Do you think there will be any Rankos after she gets released?</br></br>    <br>That's a tiny butt.</br>  <br><br>But it looks firm and tight, those are the properties of a good butt.</br></br>  <br>I think it could use a little more depth.</br>  Please sell on the PLUM shop so someone can sell this.  <br>This is the only worst girl worth getting.</br>  <br>Yes, preorders have been closed for months.</br>  <br>I buy too much with my dick. I have a thing for lolis in bathing suits / bikinis or lewder.</br>  <br> not putting them back in their packaging and hiding them in the closet every time you leave the house </br>  <br>I think it looks good.</br>  <br>are you me</br>  NEW D.GRAY-MAN CHAPTER OUT?!<br><br>That's super random. Wtf it's been years.</br></br>  <br>Those poppies</br>   The original Earl splited into Nea and Mana. One of them would become the Earl and the other one would become the 14th Noah. <br><br> Unfortunately, the soft-hearted Mana was chosen to become the Earl and a part of him gave up to his Noah memory.  <br><br> That part became the Earl, killed Katherina "to make things right". The remaining part of Mana wasn't able to take this and eventually asked Nea to kill him. <br><br> Nea, understanding the fact that killing Mana would save him and his heart, accepted the request but at the end he just couldn't kill his other half. He then took Mana and went on hiding. <br><br> Not long after that, Nea got killed by the Earl. Mana lost himself even more and went full batshit insane. <br><br> To the point of 9 years ago, only an extremely broken piece of Mana that was called Mana Walker was left. This is the Mana that Allen turned into Akuma and destroyed him with his Innocence. <br><br><br>Did I get it right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This was really sad<br><br><br>seems about right</br></br></br>   Wtf   <br>How many times did you have to reread this manga to get that. It actually sounds legit</br>  <br>Do the poppies has significant meaning or it's just there?<br><br>Some anons paid a lot of attention to the poppies last threads</br></br></br>  <br>Red poppy is Nea, white/yellow poppy is Mana</br>  <br>you can get all that from the last chapter and the vague memories of a first complete readthrough though</br>  <br>I had to create a chart for that though. The information fragments are too scattered</br>  <br> Poppies have long been used as a symbol of sleep, peace, and death <br> A second interpretation of poppies in Classical mythology is that the bright scarlet color signifies a promise of resurrection after death <br> poppy symbolism is inspired by a dream, which is pretty uncanny as the poppy is a symbol of Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams </br></br></br>   "Allen, you seem to be in really bad mood" <br><br>He read the chapter</br></br>  <br> thinking he is the main character <br>Lavi's delusion is getting worse and worse</br></br>  oh shit  <br>Why is Miranda such a miracle of universe?</br>  I don't even remember what happened last. When the manga turned monthly or whatever everything became a clusterfuck.  DGM threadly reminder that Past!Allen is responsible for:<br><br>[x]Musician code along with the song<br>[x]Almost destroying Noah Clan via using 14th<br>[x]Turning Cross's life into shit<br>[x]Turning Allen's life into extreme deep shit<br>[x]Cross's death<br>[x]Lavi turns into wormslut<br>[x]Road made a contract with QB and become magical girl, only for getting Madoka's bless and gone for good<br>[x]Timcanpy's death<br>[x]Not!Shou Tucker raping everyone<br>[x]Turning everyone into gay<br>[x]Link's unrequited gay love <br>[x]Turning Kanda and Alma from straight to gay<br>[x]The manga switches to quarterly<br>[x]Nea and Mana being the Earl<br><br><br>[for later update]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  After reading the new chapter this scene is so much sadder now  <br>Oh fuck</br>  <br>If Mana turned into an Akuma that means he was dead, but Mana is still alive or is it the Earl confusing his memories with Mana's? I'm confused</br>  <br>Allen's memories might be phony</br>  <br>The Earl is the Mana that was corrupted. That Mana never raised Allen.<br><br>The Mana that was turned into Akuma is the only part of Mana that hasn't give up to the Noah memory. That Mana is dead</br></br></br>  <br>Take Wisely in this chapter. He speaks of "Wisely", his Noah memory, as some other entity. So even if Mana died and had his soul taken to be used as fuel for an Akuma, it could be that the Noah portion of him was strong enough to continue living even after his body died. It also exists as its own separate body (we see it sinking into the Earl's shadow when he went to hug Nea), so it seems like the two are able to act independently to some extent.</br>  Will Tim be as strong as Allen at the end of the series?  <br>Tim is dead</br>  <br>Timcanpy contained the music score for Allen to play. Seems like it was more of a tool to record that information.</br>  Just to be sure since it has been so long: not!Allen<br> = Nea ?</br>  <br>yes</br>  Shounen Jump is uploading the first 5 volumes for free  <br>Is that really going to be their new uniforms? They look like strippers.</br>  <br>Only Allen.<br>There is going to be a coat</br></br>  could someone post the Allen with the coat?    what if "the heart" is literally means their heart?  <br><br><br>Hoshino can't be serious with these outfits.</br></br></br>  <br> wtf <br><br>m8</br></br></br>  <br>well for allen Sleeveless sleeves makes sense because of his Anti-akuma weapon but Lavi...it makes no sense.</br>  <br>Yes. It doesn't make sense and that's what the pic really means</br>  <br>its that hoshinos cat in the corner? also chibi circle guy is the little kid that can control akuma right? <br><br>also love the coffee cups. Panda cup for Lavi and Tim cup for Allen.</br></br></br>  <br> its that hoshinos cat in the corner? <br>Yes. It's Koro<br><br> also chibi circle guy is the little kid that can control akuma right?  <br>It's Hoshino</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought her OC thing was the bunny.</br>  <br>Allen actually intends to say "You looks shit" there</br>  <br>That's Yoshida</br>  <br>Allen thinks the same, but it could because his mood is really bad there.</br>  wonder how "real/our" Allen Walker will take it when he finds out Mana is the Earl?  <br> a part of him gave up to his Noah memory. <br>what?<br><br>and who was katherina, that girl that saw him turn into 2 babies?<br><br>also i still dont really get it so i guess im stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This anon  pic related</br>  <br><br>these niggas need to put trenchcoats on</br></br>  <br>The previous Earl was fucking Katherina. She was his waifu.</br>  <br> what? </br>  <br>AH THAT HELPS EXPLAIN IT.<br><br>I was pretty hammered when I read it last night to be honest, but I got pretty much everything else. Just didn't connect that to what happened later. <br><br><br>Okay, but it's the same girl that saw that earl staring into the sunset and then turn into 2 babies that was his waifu, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the same girl.</br>  <br>Yes, she's the same.</br>   you'll never get to see Allen strip   <br><br>k thanks.<br><br>Now I'm just waiting for Kanda and Lavi to fuck shit up and hopefully kill those Third Exorcists and the Noahs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>OHOHO ALLEN PLEASES FUJOSHI FOR MONEY</br>  <br> That's super random. Wtf it's been years. <br> being this slow <br>Newfag, get out of 4chan. There's nothing more to discuss</br></br></br>  <br> newfag <br> &gt;/b/ </br></br>  <br>I admit, you did a nice try this time.<br>Here is your reply</br></br>  <br>Sounds legit.</br>  Why mana/earl kill their mother?<br>Where's Allen comes from then? From 215, he's Nea that gotten younger, so why his memory was fucked up?<br>Mana was turned into Akuma with help from Earl, that's batshit insane logic going around here...<br>Also Hoshino need to get her artstyle back to pre-Jump SQ...</br></br></br>  <br>He's millions of dollars in debt, I'm sure he sold his body before considering he is such a qt.</br>  <br>I see she purposely coloured/designed it that way to look like they are not wearing any pants.</br>  <br> Why mana/earl kill their mother?  <br>Katerina was the reason the Millenium Earl suddenly dissapeared. Since "the Millenium Earl must not stop", she must be killed to prevent the same thing occured once again.<br><br> Mana was turned into Akuma with help from Earl, that's batshit insane logic going around here... <br><br>This anon  gets it<br><br> Also Hoshino need to get her artstyle back to pre-Jump SQ... <br><br>I prefer this chapter's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  so..lets talk about the plot twist. after so long i dont know if this was all planned out or just random asspull  <br> Rhoad is a pixie now <br> Hey Listen </br></br>  <br>Somebody had a nice collection of volume covers that suggests it might have been that from the beginning. Also obvious sword thingy and Earl's human face.</br>  Still curious what will happen to Allen Walker?<br><br>it wasn't random at all, its been hinted since forever. you just need to reread it.</br></br>  <br> Also Hoshino need to get her artstyle back to pre-Jump SQ... <br> I prefer this chapter's <br>This chapter wasn't as bad as it was before. But it still isn't as good as the early manga was.</br></br></br>  You know, I've been rereading the manga and I remembered that Allen has the power to "exorcise" the Noah from the humans so given this chapter... could Allen... "save" Mana? I think I would barf.  <br>I hate the Earl's design nowadays, it contorts too much and is too bubbly. Otherwise I'm find with the art. This chapter is also mcuh better.</br>  <br>Sword of Exocism is the most useless thing in this manga</br>  <br>Considering how Allen Walker is Fighting every single faction in the show by himself. Him "saving" Mana won't happen for a very long time.</br>  <br>He may decide to do that. It's gonna be sad as fuck, but he will do it</br>  Why is shapeshifting so best?<br><br>Lulubell best family pet someone could ask for.</br></br>  This moment was so damn good  <br> implying </br>  <br>I never said it was the best</br>  <br><br><br>i remember it was hinted  the fact that earl is them still somewhat surprises me though </br></br></br>  So Nea and Mana were flewing from Mana after Nea betrayed Mana, wait what?  <br>It seems that the Noah are separate "souls" that try to take over the body of their host. The Earl took over Mana and whatever was left of Mana went insane. Also it seems that the Earl "armor" can separate from Mana</br>  <br> The Earl took over Mana and whatever was left of Mana went insane. <br>Yeah, but there was only one body, so how could Mana-Earl and the Clown Mana exist at the same time?</br></br>  <br> With the Noah <br>Still possible. Also, how Mana and the Earl work as entities is yet to be clarified.</br></br>  <br>Also keep in mind this is Cross saying it, and just above he admits to not being very precise so everything must be taken with a grain of salt. At this point we can't even trust Allen's memories of the Mana-akuma incident.</br>  <br><br><br>What makes me think is why Earl split in the first place. Probably will end up being some bullshit about him living with humans and part of him becoming attached to them, but not sure.</br></br></br>  <br>materialize ability or some shorts. Also, most of the time when the two appear together, the Earl was just an empty suit.</br>  <br>what gets me is the first time we saw his human form he seemed so cool and collected and smart, but he's actually quite insane. Though after what Nea said in the chapter I'm thinking he started to loose it once Nea started to emerge in Allen.</br>  <br>It'll probably have something to do with Katherine, yeah. But since it's so evident it won't get me mad when they reveal it. It's probably about living both lives or something. The Earl had wondered like ~7000 years at that point so I can understand up to a point.</br>  <br>the real problem is that clown mana's appereance is fucked up in allen's memories. There is a time when he remembers Mana as a fat clown and then there's this. Both of those are memories from Allen's shota time. Of course Mana could have just used some clothes to make himself look different as a clown, but this feels really off</br>  <br>Allen is really mad about this chapter I see</br>  This file does make me feel somewhat stupid for not realizing it immediately. Just look at the clothes and...  <br>I actually posted it two posts above you weird </br>  <br>I've always assumed that was the case, that he made himself look fatter so it was more amusing. He's clearly not proportionate if he was a fat man because his face and arms are slim.</br>  <br>Haha yeah. I'm actually in that chapter in my reread.</br>  <br>But why does his hair change and his mustache disappear? Did he always shave it when he was doing clown things or what? That's really putting me off somehow.<br><br><br>Where are you rereading it? Your scans seem to be different somehow</br></br></br></br>  <br>  There is a time when he remembers Mana as a fat clown <br><br>That was just his clown costume. Allen was the same when he was in the costume</br></br></br>  <br>It makes perfect sense, but I somehow still feel triggered</br>  Anime continuation when?  <br>Actually, now that I think about it, that page is weird....... o.O<br>If he learned that code while being with Mana, then hadn't the 14th disappeared by then? Whn did he have the time to go and leave it? Unless... it was actually Mana that created the tune for him in his non-earl times..<br><br>Batoto, it's incomplete but until I get to that part... If you have a better place do tell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He slicks his hair back and I assume does shave. It's not like he has that great of a mustache, he could easily grow it back in no time.</br>  <br> If you have a better place do tell. <br>ah, I'm reading over at kissmanga, but I don't think that the scans are any better there.<br><br><br>hmm, yeah that is a flawless explanation I guess . I mean if the author would state/imply that, then there's literally nothing against that. Seems like it's just my autism that makes this so weird</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>realistically speaking, never. There might be a chance if it was still a weekly or monthly, but as a quarterly the chances are next to nil.</br>  <br>I hope soon but more as a redo then a continuation. Because the manga just restarted. I don;t want filler needless filler. They can make a redo anime all the way up till the very end of Alma arc.</br>  <br>It was called Musician code because it was created for Musicians to use (the Earl, Mana, Nea, Allen/pastAllen and Cross). Mana and Allen simply recreated the code together from their lost memories</br>  <br>Wow that makes so much sense, great!<br><br>The quality actually varies from very good to plain bad... but well.</br></br></br>   One of the best shonen jumps ever <br> doesn't have a single movie </br>  <br>I wonder what program she is using.</br>  <br>Kekkai Sensen got a anime even though its quarterly, but yeah the series has a low chance in getting a anime.</br>  <br>Clip studio paint, EX version<br><br><br>DGM's arcs tied too much with each other and filler is shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> DGM's arcs tied too much with each other <br> thinking this matters for a movie plot. </br></br>  <br>LFoS has the ability for a stand alone plot, but then I don't think I could sit for an hour of <br> Akai Ude being edgy brat  <br> Mana's batshit insane <br> No action </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying the movie staff wouldn't turn coolest boy into Sasuke 2.0 </br>  <br> Ask Hoshino to do the script <br> Make it about Nea and his edgy team of NTR <br>   animated by Shaft </br></br></br>  The best DGM arc is the attack on the HQ.  <br>nope</br>  <br> filler arc </br>  <br> Implying Timothy's innocence isn't the heart </br>  <br>I would love this and given current developments it would be greatly appreciated. By the way, is it canon?</br>  This manga's reread value is fckn amazing. So great.  <br>Can't remember why I dropped this but now seems like a good time to start over.</br>  ITT: Wife material.  <br>I'd do some nasty shit to Asakura's butthole</br>  She was the only reason to watch that dull show  Best wife/mother/onee-san material. <br><br>Also, her version of the OP is the best:<br>https://<span>youtu.be/jOuPM8ALU_M?t=565  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> No more Asakura anymore </br>   tiny as hell <br> dfc <br> loyal <br> insane libido <br> loving <br>Sora is truly the perfect wife, but only for Haru</br></br></br></br></br>   Asakura will never cook you dinner and listen to you complain about work with an understanding smile     <br> You will never make silent but sweet love while Nagato is sleeping 5 feet away from you </br>        How is the backup far superior than the main?

The manga's done a good job avoiding that so far.<br><br><br>Cousin &gt; tomboy = cake &gt; daddy complex &gt; shy &gt; yandere. Loli doesn't get ranked because she's yet to really get characterization.<br><br>Also, what the hell is it about tomboy redheads/brunettes with ponytails that makes them so sexual?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think teaching him to break up with a woman so that he could get with ten more as part of an arbitrary bet is probably a bad idea.</br>  <br>Because Kaoruko has been an associate professor until now. Konoe basically offered the full teacher post in the bet.</br>  <br>he offered to help, not get her the full job, he's just aother teacher</br>  <br>She seems well off to me, dresses fancy n' shit.</br>  <br>She looks like best girl material.<br><br>Big breasted blonde girl contestant is a best.</br></br></br>  I miss the cousin so much  <br>I want more of cousin's friend that writes the erotic stories.</br>  <br>And she got her tits sucked by love master?!</br>  <br>I want more of cousin's friend's sister who asks weird questions.</br>  <br>wait, who's the love master? What chapter does he first appear in?</br>    <br><br>that running joke</br></br>  <br>Goddamn, the setup for some Kaoruko NTR is so high, manga would get a million sales or something</br>  <br>oh, alright. So it's basically a running gag. He seems them the first time in ch10, then lovemaster tries to impress Terumi with the blonde, and then he sees them again in the library.</br>  <br>Best choices, you have good taste.</br>  <br>Cousin NTR would be worse.</br>  They are third years now, but the guy Kurumi liked was her sempai, so he was at least one year older. Yet he turned into a zombie while being in the school.<br><br>Which means it's been at least 1 year since the zombie outbreak.</br></br>  <br>I'm starting to be annoyed by Cathat's hallucinagenic shenanigans. She's always putting the others in danger as well as her self.</br>  <br>Also. shovel a best.<br><br>A BEST</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't one of the chapters say it had been like a month?</br>  <br>Finally someone who agrees.</br>  <br>Shovel a slut.</br>  Why are the zombies always blurred as shit?<br>Why did they cut Shovel's blood splattered face and uniform?<br><br>I'm not liking the way they're handling the whole zombie killing thing, feels really tame and toned down so far. They also skipped the part with pre-delusion Yuki and the gang holding the door against the zombies. The way the whole zombie senpai things was presented makes no sense here, what the fuck was she doing staring at the campus with a zombie beside her, without even noticing?</br></br></br>  It's very possible senpai-kun-chan-dono was just following what the typical zombies do in this story, which is walk somewhere they feel comfortable or last remembered. He also could have been hiding there in the wake of the outbreak, but got caught up in things and got bit on his way to the roof. It's assumed that there were a bevy more students inside of the school than outside of the school when it began, but Megumi, Yuki, Kurumi, and Yuuri were the only ones who have made it to where they had, and they were clearing out zombies before making that powerful barricade.  <br>Maybe he was just her senpai in the club. He can be still her senpai</br>  <br><br><br>They guy has his sushi roll they are given when they graduate, so the outbreak could have happen when they were about to turn into 3rd years.<br>But in the bottom page she's wearing her PE outfit so they still had classes.<br><br>The problem is, if it's been already a year, how did they survive the winter?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Didn't he turn on the spot?</br></br>  Rii is not bad either  <br>The zombies would have to be censored if they didn't do it this way. <br><br> staring at the campus with a zombie beside her <br>It was a dream right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Winter wouldn't be so bad if they had access to heating the building (especially if they could only heat the rooms they use to conserve power). Otherwise wrap up I guess? It isn't insane to suggest they could've looted some winter clothing</br>  <br>She was only looking at a silouhette she recognized as her senpai. She didn't know if he was actually a zombie or not. It was even implied that the two of them spent a number of days on the rooftop just looking over at the horizon, which lays more credence to "going back to places they remember" idea.</br>  <br>So that they can kill them without thinking of them as humans. It's a part of their coping mechanism. Well it also helps with the censorship as well.</br>  <br>Just like Yuki's delusions are about things being alright, the others' delusions are about things being worse than they really are.<br><br>Also, do zombies have that much blood anyway? I always find it unrealistic when blood splatters like if it was a geyser.</br></br></br>  <br> no mole </br>    did they add stuff to the OP? I don't remember those scenes with the zombies and ruined classroom being in it before.  <br><br>What are you talking about? They were there the entire time.<br><br>You are being delusional again, Anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They were there in the original OP if I recall.</br>  <br>Thank you Mr. T.</br>  <br>Anon, you are not making any sense</br>  I think I've finally cracked why the zombies at the school were responding to the school alert system. <br><br>They follow all of their old memories and instincts blindly and aimlessly until they find a human body to chomp on. However, they seem to follow everything they remembered doing regularly. They went into the school because the rain would soak their clothes. They responded to the various school broadcasts because one might mean "Time to go home", so they would start heading home. One might've meant to head to fire drill locations, so they will auto-pilot their way to the fire drill locations. The meat-eating monsters they turned into seem to simply be running automatically, and they bite humans because they are EXTREMELY hungry and don't know anything else to eat.<br><br>It would also explain why they keep running after glowsticks and loose change, because those are some little commodities that a normal person might pick up and return to someone else, or they themselves might pocket.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the zombies would have much more problems surviving the winter.<br><br>Has any zombie story deal with snow?</br></br></br>  So how is the adaptation so far from someone who as read the manga, no spoiler pls.<br><br>Also is it heavily censored?</br></br>  <br><br>Dead Snow, those were nazi zombies that rose from the snow.<br><br>Never watched it tho.</br></br></br></br>  <br>World War Z had entire chapters about frozen zombies and winter survival scenarios.</br>  <br>World War Z explained it well. <br> Zombies go to a snowy location, as in FREEZING snow <br> Zombies aren't weatherproofed against it, so most of them, at minimum, are slowed down dramatically <br> A large number of them, and eventually all of them, freeze up and their bodies are just corpsicles until the weather changes <br> Those unfortunate enough to shamble into regions like Russia or float into Alaska periodically defrost and wander into areas thought to be cleared, or bite/infect people who get snagged on an exposed jaw or hand </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not as much censorship as it is cutting off the violent parts.</br>  <br><br>Dumbledore dies.</br></br>  <br>The only reason zombies would struggle with snow is mobility. The ones in GG are very clumsy, giving humans an even bigger advantage. Although snow would make more noise as humans walked over it</br>  <br>That's not really a valid example as the Nazis there were more like revenants (physical ghosts hellbent on revenge) than actual zombies.</br>  <br>Senpai in track club, not senpai in year.</br>  <br> They are third years now, but the guy Kurumi liked was her sempai, so he was at least one year older.  <br><br>sempai in the track club =/= higher grade</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they'd live to see the winter. They'd run out of stuff to eat eventually. Winter would only make that harder I guess.</br>  <br>Winter zones are amongst the worst for humanity, as most of them would simply freeze and lay in wait indefinitely until anything that would defrost them, causing a second or third or fourth outbreak with every new spring.</br>  Shovel is impure.<br>Miki is a slut.</br>  <br> defrost and start moving again <br><br>Have them heard of frozen water crystals breaking the meat? Their flesh and bones shouldn't have the strength to hold them standing</br></br></br>  <br><br>He was graduating though, he's holding his diploma tube in the scene</br></br>  <br> The ones in GG are very clumsy, giving humans an even bigger advantage <br>One wonders how in a whole school with facilities prepared for a zombie outbreak, only a group of little girls survived.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, even if we disregard zombies decomposing, henceforth stopping being operational in less than a week, freezing does damage to the tissues.</br>  I've only read a few chapters (gonna try to catch up soon), but am I interpreting this correctly:<br><br>  Megu-Nee doesn't really exist, therefore Yuki is at least on a subconscious level aware of the zombie outbreak?  </br></br>  <br><br>Do you think Miki would've gone down on that guy if given the chance?</br></br>  <br>Most stories that do don't have the zombies turn into minutely shredded meat due to frostbite. Which is fair enough, because it would be a very short zombie apocalypse.</br>  <br>The same way only Miki and Kei survived the second outbreak of their group, they were on the roof with only one door to hold and one zombie to kill.</br>  <br>That's not necessarily true, the outbreak could have happened right around graduation, so a month or two at most</br>  <br>No shit, like most people with PTSD she is aware of her surroundings on some level.</br>  <br>What were they doing on the roof with Shovel? Was he getting back to the school sometimes to hump her once or twice? Maybe it was during class period so they could spend an hour on the roof, that's the only logical answer.</br>  <br>How is her vision of "ghosts" not a sign of awareness of the situation already?</br>  <br>You mean the leader of their group? Kei was more into him, and so where the other girls. She just didn't know how to deal with a drunkard.</br>  <br> Skipping school to go shopping <br> Doesn't reject drunkard's advances <br> Wears Garterbelt <br>She would've gone all the way with him if her shitty friend didn't butt in.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It would also explain why they keep running after glowsticks and loose change, because those are some little commodities that a normal person might pick up and return to someone else, or they themselves might pocket. <br><br>Please. So if I throw a pantsu to the floor, the male zombies will go for it? Lights and noises, nothing else.</br></br></br>  <br>Correct. <br><br> Megumi wanted Yuki to experience happiness amid the hell that was a zombie apocalypse, so she implanted herself deep within Sakura's conscious mind and buried her vision of what the world was really like inside of a fantastical world where everything was perfect.  <br><br> This delusion fades periodically and it absolutely devastates Yuki until she comes back to her happyland.  <br><br> Megu-nee existed at one point, but she died protecting all of the Gakkous. <br><br> You can assume, knowing this genre, that it isn't the last we see of Megumi. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The problem is, if it's been already a year, how did they survive the winter? <br><br>It's been less than a year, this episode takes place before summer and japanese schools end around like March, so more like three months.</br></br></br>  <br>She'll redeem herself eventually.</br>  <br>They need to know that you've thrown it. Pantsu don't make a sound when they hit the ground. Coins do. Glowsticks do.</br>  <br>I've never been to a war so I wouldn't know<br><br>which vision do you mean?</br></br></br>  <br>People sometimes go back to school for club and stuff like that. Didn't the keions go to their clubroom after they graduated to p̶l̶a̶y̶ ̶m̶u̶s̶i̶c̶ hangout with Azunyan?</br>  <br>Was she wearing the garterbelt before the outbreak or she got it then?</br>  <br>It's still time for humans to regroup and fortify themselves. Of course, contingent on technology level; the cold could be just as deadly.<br><br><br>Shovel said being a manager wouldn't suit her, and managers usually serve as cumdumps for the entire club in doujins. She's pure.<br><br><br>These are the same people who deny that zombies decay from exposure even as said zombies' skin sloughs off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean her knowing that ghosts are to be avoided in general. That might have been badly worded.</br>  <br> &gt;Doesn't reject drunkard's advances <br>She was obviously being bothered by it, take your slut-googles off.</br></br>  <br>Tan Shovel is even better.</br>  Which Gakkou would you Gurashi?  <br>Speculated by a character in World War Z, that ice ruptures cells in humans, so why doesn't it happen to zombies? Never answered though. Zombies gonna zomb</br>  <br>The zombie in library for example.</br>  <br> knowing that ghosts are to be avoided in general <br>Well shit, isn't that just common sense among little girls?</br></br>  <br>Fuck: Kurumi, Yuuri<br>Marry: Megu-Nee, Yuki<br>Kill: Miki</br></br></br>  <br>Not even ice can fuck with Tengen Toppa Solanum.</br>  <br>I want to marry Yuuri.</br>  <br>muh bruder</br>  <br>Humans tire and get careless. An alert human can easily deal with one zombie, but when you are up against a lot (early stages before they disperse) and are tired it's easy to slip up. And zombie outbreaks are essentially perma hell and hell difficulty</br>  I wonder if they're going to remove  Megu-nee on the letter? .<br>That was a nice subtle touch that Yuki did know deep down. It'd be a shame if they changed it.</br>  <br>Yuuri for second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every year for the rest of my life</br>  This is Miki.  She is Nuclear.   <br>Miki.</br>  <br>REMOVE DOG</br>  <br>All of them, at the same time.</br>  <br>You mean the we are daijoubu drawing?<br><br>BTW, in the manga, she only drew the 3 girls without megu-nee.</br></br></br>  <br><br> She is standing on the edge </br></br>     wasting water washing off your shovel <br><br>Shovel pls</br></br>  <br>You fucking ESL retard, I put that in spoilers for a reason. Yes, I've read the manga, I'm wondering about future anime original changes.<br><br>Serious advice here - kill yourself!</br></br></br>  <br>Enjoy your bacterial growths. She uses it for gardening remember</br>  <br>Is water limited? Seemed like all the taps and things worked.</br>  <br> Not cleaning parts of your body just because you it's not always in use <br><br>Might as well cut your dick off right now.</br></br></br>  <br>They have an unlimited supply.</br>     steppen king <br>Heh</br>  <br>Stay mad, autistic spic.</br>  <br><br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre<br>http://pastebin.com/8rz8gEUM<br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br><br>Don't remember in which link it is but they have unlimited water supply</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope. They got water purifiers, solar panels, a vegetable garden and all manner of resources  the school was sponsored by the same company who manifactured the virus, and was a hidden survival-shelter location in case of outbreak </br>  Is the final twist going to be that Yuki is actually the only sane person and acting as a doctor in a mental asylum while the others are all fantasizing about all that stuff?  <br><br>What of it?</br></br>  <br>In Walking Dead the zombies just freeze until it gets warmer again. They don't die because they don't drink (much) water, so the ice crystals don't destroy their brain and muscles.</br>  <br><br>I hope not</br></br>  <br>Where did you get that info from?</br>  <br> Skipping school <br>She wasn't, it got out early. The other girls were still there for club activities.<br><br><br>Before.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that'd be so then  said doctor would slowly be turning crazy like her patients </br>    <br><br/></br>  <br> Inb4 Yuki is   actually a patient in an asylum and all this is her delusions <br> &gt;Miki, Kurumi, Rii-san, and her sister visit her on occasion, but they can't bear to see her like this </br></br>  3) Strains<br>Written below are the strains of research up until XXX Year XX Month. This is only a general description which may change with time.<br> <br>Alpha strain:<br>Wide range infection type. Using XXX mushrooms as a base, the infectivity and range increased. Symptoms include fever, sweating, and nausea.<br>Incubation period is 3-6 days. Infection through contact, liquids, and blood.<br>Lethality is low but when not given medical treatment, weakness followed by death may occur.<br>Taking into account the incubation period, you should put these people in quarantine for 10 days.<br>Be careful of infection (wear airtight clothes if available), and use the alpha mark first-aid kit.<br> <br>Beta strain:<br>Lethal infection type. Using XXX virus as a base, it was made to be heavily resistant to existing vaccines. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, vomiting blood, and hemorrhages. Infection through blood.<br>Incubation period of 2 hours. Death rate near 100%.<br>Do not approach those infected by the beta strain. The virus should die out seven hours following death.<br> <br>Omega strain:<br>...at the domain level...<br>...do not apply.<br>...cardiac arrest...<br>...omega mark... do... use...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hidden <br>It's in the school brochure.<br><br> Emergency Storehouse <br> A certain portion of the produce produced in the gardens are stored underground in our emergency storehouse.
