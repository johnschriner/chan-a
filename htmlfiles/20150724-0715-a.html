[ Ruri a cute  Wait, how many kings are there again?  <br>There is only one King, and it's Jack Atlas.<br>Everyone else is a pretender</br></br>    <br><br> I was only nine years old <br> I loved Jack Atlas so much, I owned all his cards and merchandise <br> I pray to Jack Atlas every night, thanking him for the burning soul I have been given <br> "Jack is love," I say, "Jack is life" <br> My dad hears me and calls me a traitor <br> He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Jack <br> I call him a jealous commons <br> He duels me and beats me 2-0 because of Blackwings <br> I am crying now because my pride hurts <br> I lay in bed and it's really cold <br> A burning soul is moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Jack <br> I am so happy <br> He whispers into my ear, "This is entertainment" <br> He grabs me with his mighty arms and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my Duel Disk for Jack <br> He summons a bunch of monsters in one turn <br> I have no cards but I do it for Jack <br> I can feel my field emptying as cards are destroyed by his absolute power <br> I push against his force <br> I want to please Jack <br> He laughs a mighty laugh as he synchro summons his very soul <br> My dad walks in <br> Jack looks him deep in the eyes and says, "There is only one king! And it's me!" <br> Jack drives away on his Wheel of Fortune <br> Jack Atlas is love, Jack Atlas is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's complete shit, anon.</br>   we've never seen Ruri <br> we probably won't see her until close to the end <br> we won't be free from this bullshit until we see her <br> it'll probably be meh either way <br>Say goodbye to your memes when Shun is carded and Ruri turns out to be bossy and unlikeable. Where will you be without your memes, /a/? WHERE WILL YOU BE WITHOUT YOUR MEMES, XYZ SCUM?</br></br></br></br>  <br>is Dennis actually a fusion nigger?</br>  <br>I'm concerned that whenever Ruri is finally reunited with Shun, that he's going to hug her so hard that it crushes her ribs and kills her. It's probably one of the reasons Yuto intervened when he attempted to embrace Yuzu.</br>  <br> destiny draws Polymerization by mistake <br> welcomes Yuri into Standard <br> worlds better than your average LDS shitter <br>Nope. No way. Nuh-uh. Not at all. What made you think, that? Don't be silly, anon, hahaha!</br></br></br></br>  <br>well he can use xyz too<br>and he knows about Yuya's dad<br>so it's possible he may not be</br></br></br>  <br> well he can use xyz too <br>It wasnt true XYZ since it didnt trip off any NEET cave alarms</br></br>  <br> Say goodbye to your memes when Shun is carded and Ruri turns out to be bossy and unlikeable <br>The thought of Shun pulling a Fubuki, and suddenly becoming a deredere/submissive type in her presence appeals to me more than it should.</br></br>  <br>he could still be from standard though</br>  <br>This. Dennis has managed to not set off any alarm bells other than Crazed Imouto Man's "LDS shouldn't be good" alarm bells.</br>  <br>The more I think about, the more I'm inclined to agree.</br>  <br>what if he is from standard, but Leo/Yuri contacted him to be his personal spy?</br>  When will be the next time Yuya summons Odd-Eyes EGAO Dragon?  <br>that's what I've been thinking</br>  <br>A double agent huh.</br>  <br>When he jumps on this next against his first actual Friendship Cup opponent<br> tfw fucking around in your spare time and drawing a D-Wheel for some reason <br> tfw Yuya's turns out to look just like it <br>whoah man</br></br></br></br>  I don't care if she isn't the best, I want to run this qt in Performapals.  <br>He isnt true XYZ. Like how LDS summoning isnt the true summoning.</br>  So, writefags or anyone with free time out there, I will trigger your autism. Write a summary of how an OVA about your favourite monster will be.

Random side characters will be left for dust.</br></br>  anyone got the mega download link for GX?  <br>It's called Google</br>  <br>What are you talking about,anon?

I wonder if the other lancers and yuzu gonna have custom duel runners that match the ace cards of their decks,too. I also wonder if Crow really does have a new dragon this time as well. Seriously,konami, you made two shitty black winged dragons, You've got one more attempt before it's 3 strikes and out.</br>  <br>Of course, there are the rank 4 engines you use to get your rank 4s out!</br>  Why is she so lovable?  <br> Not properly pink hair <br> Arms are totally not cude and strong, you'd barely feel a thing when she knocks you around for fucking up <br> No ZR <br><br>Shit tier</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not blonde <br> No trench coat  <br> Stiff, non nimble movement meaning she can't survive falls from skyscraper heights <br><br>Shit tier</br></br></br></br></br>  MC from 5D was in Kamen Rider Drive and Wizard.

The part that connects with soft breasts can be made hard, but it's probably cheaper to make the rest of the body from regular plastic. If you want to see examples look at Alleyne's knees (as if they couldn't not skimp on half of her fucking legs, jesus christ) and Katsuragi's collar (hidden by the tie, dunno if there are any pictures of that part on the internet).</br>  <br><br>I REALLY WANT TO COMMIT A CRIME</br></br>  <br><br>I sure hope they're cast-off (at least their bras).

It's just a cluttered shit mess.</br>  <br>Makes me sad I'm not into boatshit. Some of their figs are so pretty. I love the designs. I would've bought like 10 already.</br>  <br><br>What the problem then? <br><br>The game is based completely around you liking their designs, and an anime doesn't even exist. So what's stopping you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That one looks ugly though.</br>  <br>Those fucking thighs</br>  <br><br><br>When are these going up?</br></br></br>  Fuck me Zaraki, those don't grow back you know  <br>Myuri will give him some medicine, he can make his limbs grow back after all</br>  <br>Decent chapter I guess and I'm still holding on to the hope that Monster Quincy is gonna be a qt grill for now.</br>  <br> Decent chapter <br>It's always a good chapter when Mayuri struts his stuff Zaraki is getting bodied pretty hard for a guy who supposedly stopped fighting while holding back.</br></br>  <br>either that or die.<br><br>So... pernida....</br></br></br>  <br>ehhhhhhh  no. </br>  <br>What was the point of Unohana dying again? Kenpachi has gotten more stupid. Still holding back despite almost getting killed after debut and getting his ass saved and in case losing an arm and doing the same thing which lost his first arm</br>  Is Zaraki retard moe?  <br><br>because it's fun for zaraki, remember that he likes to fight<br><br>There is no fun (for him) if she says Bankai (or even Shikai) and instakill the enemy</br></br></br></br>  <br> commander <br><br>zaraki and mangapanda both.</br></br></br>  <br>but unoihana's death taught him responsability and always fight full on from the start and that shit.</br>  Yes they do, it's called Orihime.  <br>I'm sure he's having plenty of fun</br>  <br>In bleach yeah they do, just wait for the group healer</br>  How many people have jobbed now to make Mayuri look even more based?<br><br>I love it.</br></br>  <br>It sorta made him a tiny bit stronger i guess. and quelled his cockyness.<br>Think of it like if Gilgamesh from Fate acted serious all the time with every fight. shit would be over fast</br></br>  <br><br>nah, he is still retarded. Proof is he doesn't use his shikai even after an arm destroyed<br><br><br><br>As i said, he is retarded, but at least it's Mayuri's time to shine!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was it really worth one of the best healers and experienced captains in Soul Society though?</br>  Kind of hoping for Nemu's shikai to be revealed here.<br><br>Bit of a long shot, but hey, I never expected Yachiru's to be shown either, so it's not totally out of the question.</br></br>   Mayuri gets his shit pushed in by glasses early in the series and only escapes with his regen trump card <br> Has been the strongest character in the series ever since then <br>Does Kubo have a boner for him or something?</br></br>  <br>Mayuri has taken out like 6 Captain class fighters this arc, something like that. Nigga is now embarrassing Kenpachi and the super Nazi thing simultaneously and earlier also made Askin walk away. He even talked shit to Yama's face and got away with it. If you try to fuck with him he will introduce your angus to the most arcane concepts you can't possibly imagine.</br>  <br> not having at least one original and two artificially implanted boners for mayuri-sama at all times </br>   controls people by inserting it's nerves into their bodies and taking over <br><br>Then how did it break those trees way back during the fight against the Royal Guard? Shouldn't that power only work on things that have nerves?</br></br>  <br><br>I think Kubo likes writing characters like Mayuri and Aizen more than he does the others.</br></br>  <br> Hype Kenpachi up as the strongest shinigami since sliced bread <br> Kills a dude that can control reality <br> Gets beat by nerves and stupidity <br><br>And Mayuri is fucking toying with him. I mean I expect the old "My power is actually" back and forth for a while.<br><br>Seriously though, Mayuri has done the bulk of the successful fighting himself in this war.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri was toying with Uryuu until he pulled the "technique that will make me 100 times more powerful but make me lose my powers afterwards, at least until the next arc where I get them back through some convenient plot device" card. That and the friend sacrifice power ups are the most effective and unbeatable power ups in shounen.</br>  <br><br>MAUYRI NEXT SOUL KING!</br></br>  <br>For christ sakes, how many times does this need to be repeated.<br><br>The point of Unohana's fight with Zaraki wasn't about Zaraki's power-up. At least not in the first place. It was more about telling and completing her backstory that we never got. <br><br>Zaraki's power-up was secondary result of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> exploding knees: the chapter </br>  <br>The narrative point of it was that, but there also needs to be an "in character" reason for the way characters act and that reason needs to have impact if it's carried out.</br>  <br>He didn't really even beat Gremmy. It was literally death by stupidity, he was and could have continued running circles around Kenpachi if he wasn't such a dumbass.</br>  <br><br>Still a shitty story device, Unohana death could have been better by having her fight versus an actual enemy and making zaraki arrive in her last moments</br></br>  <br><br>Could have been plain old spiritual pressure. Or maybe he's not only restricted to using nerves.<br><br>The correct answer is always kubo making shit up as he goes along</br></br></br></br>  shinigami are spirits how can they haves nerves. kubo messed up.  <br> Become all powerful <br> Be too retarded to make any use of it <br>Kubo is too deep.</br></br></br>  <br>That's meta knowledge though, what he's asking is what purposes in universe is there.</br>  <br><br>Good thing you weren't here for the Rukia Bankai chapters then</br></br>  <br> kills a person whose Bankai is literally about melting the flesh of her opponents <br> kills the top medic in Soul Society <br> all to give one guy a vague chance of a power-up <br><br>I'm pretty sure Unohana's death was less about her backstory, and more about Kubo wanting an excuse to have characters drop like flies. Can't have edgy death counts if there's a medic around I guess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't here but it was pretty dumb. worrying about body temperature.</br>  <br><br>Does that mean Orihime's going to bite the dust too?</br></br>  <br> Orihime <br>You know what? I honestly forgot she existed, and yeah probably. The fact that she never used her "reverse time on life threatening wounds" shit is pretty stupid in of itself. <br><br>But I'm pretty sure Kubo would come up with some bullshit reason like "the particles of the Quincy's attacks negate her abilities" or some other contrived concept.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah it was pretty stupid. Apparently spirits have the same physiology as humans and even obey the laws of physics, except when they don't. <br><br>I get that Kubo wants to pull off a mix between science and the supernatural but he's such a shitty writer he can't pull it off convincingly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ no. its fucking retarded to have one 8.5/10 in exchange for two 7/10's<br>Kubo has just butchered Kenny since his 'buff' he shoulda been untouchable but got fucked over by hax Gremmy</br></br>  <br> Unohana dying <br>You're going to feel real dumb in the near future.</br></br>  <br> Gets beat by nerves <br>That shit is broken as fuck.No shame in losing.<br>Nerves control your heartbeat, blood pressure, digestion, information sent from your senses to your brain, balance and general motor function.<br>Technically Pernida can fuck up your entire body and not puppeteering shit but controlling, manipulating and destroying it from the inside including what you see,hear,feel,taste and smell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just how Kira and Frenchie are not dead, right?</br>  <br>The point is that Zaraki is a retard for rushing in despite getting his arm destroyed in the blink of an eye earlier. <br><br>You'd think he'd learn after his fight with Gremmy but he's really that retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but he survived fighting god and like cut space or some shit.</br>  do you think Kubo has fun writing Bleach?  Isnt the nervious system controll litteraly the same thing?   those don't grow back you know <br>Orihime.</br>  What happened to the old other thread?<br>Deleted or died because of inactivity?</br>  <br>Mayuri learns from his mistakes, not like any other character in the series.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Only difference is that eyes arrancar actually controlled the victim, this guy just breaks them.</br>  <br>So she basically has an enhanced version of Ywach's super Blut Vene?</br>  <br>he manages the reishi currents through his nerves, and that currets are probably in the blood or some shit, so he probably did the same to the trees though their savia or some shit.</br>  <br>Well yeah. Except it follows the exact same flow.<br> Controlls Byakya/Zaraki's arm <br> Cuts nervs in arm to stop unwanteded seppuku <br> so you controll body parts huh <br>Its litteraly just abit more violent for an unnessicary reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inactivity <br>I doubt it, we have enough posts to keep one alive. Why was it deleted then?</br></br>  <br> Has been the strongest character in the series ever since then <br>Huh?</br></br>  <br><br>He's dominated every fight he's been in after his fight with Uryuu. But that's more because he knows how to pick his targets.</br></br>  <br>I think it's all part of Shunsui plan to get rid of any captain older than himself and Ukitake.<br><br>The reason? No fucking idea.</br></br></br>  if he control nerves hy not juust send nemu or some other robot to kill it  <br>It was Kubo being Kubo. He just didn't tell us that Ishida beat the strongest character in the manga.<br>I don't even care if that's not the case. I'm just gonna pretend it's foreshadowing.</br></br>  Shunshui as captain commander:<br><br> Sacrifices Unoanaha pratically for nothing. <br> Gets ready for an attack that got him by surprise even though mayuri knew it would happen. <br> Sacrificed Ukitake just to give Yawach a powerup. <br> Fres Aizen to make the rest of captains angry, so Aizen killed a bunch of minions because ther est of the captains are useless, and then leaves Aizen sitting there in his chair. <br> Invades rhe Royal Realm and forgets to bring Kenpachi with him. <br><br>if anything, i'd say Shunsui has been the best ally yawach ahs had in this war so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Nemu has nerves.</br>  FUCK YOU ALL GISELLE DIEDE?!<br><br>in other news can someone please update pic related.</br></br>  <br>So what?You're behaving like this is something new.This is fucking Zaraki.After what, 500 chapters since he debuted you call him a retard NOW?<br><br><br>Irrelevant when his opponent has a power like this.Pernida is the absolute worst possible match up for Zaraki.Someone he needs to use his brains, analyze and come up with a countermeasure.<br>With Gremmy he could just tank and rely on his power which is different from Pernida who bypasses defenses by targetting nerves which makes Zaraki's durability, his greatest asset, absolutely useless.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pernida is the absolute worst possible match up for Zaraki <br>Who fucking isn't. He has had like one good pairing.</br></br>  <br><br>Looking at this it really seems like Kubo blew his load too early in this arc.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Does Sunshui want to dstroy Soul Society? Is he workign under yawach? or with Aizen?<br>He avoided fighting with Haschwald, and now he's just bringing every shinigami to the doorspet of the main villain, knowing none of them cn do shit to hit,<br>He was OK with fighting yamamoto after destroying the soukoku and directly opossing his command.<br><br>has been killing or setting up to kill powerful/old captains.<br><br>When he entered the royal realm didn't even wondered about the royal guards or to make an alliance with them or work together to find a solution.<br><br>Freed aizen with no clear reason.<br><br>Shunsui is really fishy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For the first time ever, no captain is from the original death squad that formed the Gotei 13.</br>  <br>He definitely has fun writing Mayuri's fights</br>  <br>exactly.<br><br>And he also let ukitake die, his goodbye with him was way too cold for soemone who have been friends since 2000 years ago.</br></br></br>  <br> Frenchie <br>Who?</br></br>  <br> Mayuri has done the bulk of the successful fighting himself in this war. <br>He is the expert about them.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying trees don't have nerves?</br>  <br>there aren't any anymore. if they have conventional powers, he will stomp over them due to his immense reiatsu and a zanpakuto that cuts through anything<br><br>so he fights unconventional opponents, who wreck his shit because he's too much of an idiot to fight intelligently.</br></br></br>  <br> Freed aizen with no clear reason. <br>Obviously he wants to make him the new SK. Both he and Ukitake expected Yhwach to go to Royal Realm and took measures: Shunsui went to free Aizen, Ukitake activated Kamikake.<br>Which is why Aizen was left behind in Seireitei. Shunsui's plan will be ruined if Quincies find a way to kill Aizen.</br></br></br>   Zaraki without an arm and paralyzed <br> More than likely going to stay that way for this series of fights <br>Fucking gee, so glad you gave him a power up so he could be useful, Kubo. Almost like you were about to make him an important character.</br></br>  I've just realised something. We still haven't seen Ichigo fight since he got his two swords.<br><br>I mean it's good, Ichigo fights are boring, but how long ago was that?</br></br>  <br>English Co captain</br>  <br> More than likely going to stay that way for this series of fights <br><br>well mayuri decided to save him because he thinks he could be usefuul still, so I think he will still do something.</br></br></br>  <br>the only tiem he did something it was vs thunderbolt and he even told ehr to dodge because she woudl get killed otherwise.<br><br>And then he shoot one or two getsugas at yawach that did nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>He had a short fight versus T. Blew her arm off, then everybody started swarming him.</br>  <br> implying he won't pull a bankai out of his ass and then pic related will happen </br>  <br><br>What chapter was his good-bye in? I'm looking for it but I can't find it</br></br>  <br>he has no legs now.</br>  <br> arm already missing <br>Deviantart faggots knew the future all along</br></br>  <br>Lol that can't even be called a goodbye. It was in the chapter where Gotei finally arrived in SK's realm.</br>  I'm worried<br>Other than mayuri, who else could have a good fight now? Zaraki's downed, bromamura is wolfed, and even grimmjow was brought back to job.<br>The vizards are only fodder<br>And even hitsugaya's fanservice couldn't help much<br>Who else is left??</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are just broken.</br>  <br>The captain commander, Ukitake's ghost, Ichigo Squad and  Hinamori </br>  <br>Shunsui, of course. He is our last hope.</br>  <br>yawach you mean.</br>  <br><br><br>Byakuya, Renji, shunsii and I hope yoruichi</br></br></br>  <br>Shunsui<br>Urahara<br>Aizen<br>Ishiin<br>Tessai<br>Ryuuken<br>Ginjo<br>Facebook<br>Ichigo<br>Shiji if he goes bankai.<br>Byakuya new upgraded bankai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about the scene where Shunsui says "We'll save Soul Society, that's what Ukitake would've wanted."</br>  <br> Byakuya new upgraded bankai. <br>The bankai he couldn't upgrade because As Nodt had it while he was training?</br></br>  <br><br>I was talkin about the chapter where Shunsui went off to the prision and freeed aizen.</br></br>  <br>did they ever explain how johnny got out of that one? I forget if he can just stop it at will its bee so long</br>  <br>are you retarded? or just have bad memory?</br>  <br>Sounds like you have an argument to use. Show it.</br>  <br>That's the one I'm talking about too, it's the chapter that cemented for me that Shunsui is up to something</br>  Is it just me or did Mayuri just grift powers off Tousen's corpse. Fear Factor 4 is awfully similar to Suzumushi's cry.  <br>You kidding, right? Kubo would never get rid of earth nakama. Well, unless her death would conveniently make Ichigo/Ishida go berserk.</br>  <br><br><br>Found it. Chapter 605</br></br></br>  <br>of course they did.</br>    <br><br>Byakuya did the same trainign as ichigo, ruukia and renji, so he learned teh true names and all that shit of his sword.<br><br>his shikai was on his bankai level on the fight with as nodt, so his bankai WILL be different or better or whatever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shunsui.<br>Shuhei if he didn't literally get killed in one panel.<br>Aizen<br>Urahara</br></br></br></br>      <br> based on what was foreeeen <br><br>BY WHO<br><br>did the king gave them incompelte information on the future?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you prove that true name asspull isn't unique to Renji?<br>And his bankai couldn't have become stronger for the reason I stated earlier.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>That mofo si happy.<br><br>happy because he knows ukitake is going to die? happy because he's going to free aizen? happy because the quincies are in the royal realm?<br><br>why the fuck is Shunsui that fucking happy there?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he didn't ahd his bankai, but if he knew more about it he can improve it when he gets it back.</br>  <br><br> More than likely going to stay that way for this series of fights <br><br>Not counting the fact that Mayuri is as good a healer as Unohana, Zaraki still has power boosts up his ass that'll make him ignore whatever damage he has. If the his shikai, his eyepatch.<br><br>Then again, they're fighting the Elite Sternritter who were boosted by the Aschwallen and who managed to beat the Royal Guard, why the fuck do people think they're going to be pushovers in any way?<br><br>1x1 duels are not going to happen anymore for the most part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Since when do power-boosts regenerate arms and legs? Also, Mayuri is able to heal himself and Nemu because of the extensive body modifications he's done, he's not good at healing others.</br></br>  <br><br> he's not good at healing others. <br><br>He already healed others during the arrancar arc and he most definitely un-zombified Jizzelle's victims.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he fixed uryu and renji's internal organs.</br>  <br><br> Since when do power-boosts regenerate arms and legs? <br><br>Ludicrous amounts of reiatsu being poured tends to have bullshit healing effects.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I forgot about Uryuu and Renji. Guess he could Zaraki if he wanted to then.</br></br></br>  <br> That scene and the one directly after </br>  <br>kubo has a boner all the time</br>   Mayuri Vs. Aizen will never happen <br>This world is hell</br>  What the hell? I missed a couple of chapters. why is Mayuri fighting Zaraki?  <br>Shunsui is evil though.<br>Aizen do something pls.<br><br> Where the hell is Ryuken anyway? Not relevant anymore? </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even understand why Gremmy sent his "real" self out to fight. If he can just imagine extra selves, why would he ever not have an extra self chilling out at home? Total bullshit.<br><br> Also sick quads, pic related </br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri is a quincy, why do you think he was in the maggots nest? He only uses sceince to fight and not reiatsu like the restof the shinigami.<br><br>The clues where all there but nobody conected the dots until this reveal.</br></br></br>  The worst parts of Zaraki and Mayuri together.<br><br>Zaraki too stupid to take off his eyepatch or use Shikai after losing a fucking arm. If losing an arm doesn't name you get serious nothing will.<br><br>Mayuri magically knowing everything about his opponents abilities because he can analyze anything like he has the Sharingan and has drugs for all occasions on his person.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nobody connected the dots <br>IMPLYING<br><br>it was obvious, if you werent a fucking level 1 reader</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri is the shinigami that Bruce Wayne became when he died.</br>  <br>Well, yeah, but the guy asked why they where fighting, he is clearly a level -1 reader.</br>  <br>That's entirely on character for Zaraki, and Mayuri explained exactly how he'd come to determine how Pernidas power worked using information that we the reader already had access to. Both points are entirely invalid, you shitstain.</br>  <br>Implying you arent too</br>  <br>Ryuken is a coward. Didn't show up to protect Karakura from Aizen, and he won't show up now.</br>  <br><br> Mayuri magically knowing everything about his opponents abilities <br><br>After not attacking Pernidas like an idiot and observing Zaraki getting attacked not once but twice, it's completely natural that Mayuri would start counter attacking in some way. Not that he has done much so far.<br><br>Zaraki should fucking know better at this point, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   implying mayuri knows everything about someone's power just because of a few seconds <br><br>He was surprised Ishida could use Ransentogai. Seeing quincies with schrifts should be completely foreign to him.</br></br>  <br>It's just a bad match up for Zaraki. If Miracle had shown up this situation might have been reversed.</br>  <br> implying he's even a war potential </br>  <br>you fuck off right away</br>  People always complain they hate powerlevel battles then when someone with a huge powerlevel gets wasted by someone who doesn't care about your reiatsu everyone is complaining.  <br>I'm implying no such thing. But Kubo promised us to show his bankai in this arc.</br>  <br> being retarded <br>He's seen plenty of them by this point, and they're all just applications of various reishi powers. Seeing it once and knowing what it did would be an asspull; the second time proves it's pure science.</br></br>  <br>Every schrift is completely different. You say that like they are even remotely similar. <br><br><br>the only thing any of them have in common is being granted by nazi jesus</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also we don't know how much of his power is compromised by the high Reishi density in the Warwelt</br>  <br>He wouldn't die, even if he was killed to death.<br><br>Does he even know HOW to die at all?<br><br>Yes you really need to literally know how to die in order for you to actually literally die to death, otherwise you're an infinite loop.<br><br>Trust me I know this shit.<br><br>Or do I?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes that's exactly what I implied. Are you having brain problems?</br>  <br> Overkill: super strength <br> Superstar: super strength <br> Power: super strength </br></br></br>  <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>He almost got meatball'd. He's looking like a jobber this morning, at least by /a/ standards.</br>  <br>Wasn't the Unohana fight supposed to beat the dumb out of him and return him to his brutal killer self of the past? Being a fucking 'tard kinda hinders that.</br>  <br> seeing it twice means he can know whether someone can create matter out of thin air, has zombie blood, injects people with nerves, has a love gun, is easily forgotten, or can do any other never before seen magical Quincy shit </br>  <br>E Y E P A T C H<br>E<br><br>Y<br><br>E<br><br>P<br><br>A<br><br>T<br><br>C<br><br>H</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, not even remotely. It was to release the limits he placed on himself; if anything it made him even more dumb, but also more strong. I don't know how the fuck you people didn't get that the first time, you're all level one filth.</br>  <br>It took much less for Zaraki to get serious against Ichigo. not being serious after losing an arm is not in character, it's just being regarded</br>  Reminder Zaraki will forever be at half strength due to no two handed grip on the sword.  <br>The Quincy will probably be taken out with team ups of two or more people. Grimmjow might stand up and reveals something new so don't count him out yet.<br><br>I expect Shinji to finally deliver because jesus fucking christ his character deserves some dignity back after jobbing against nonvolständig Quincy and being held of by fucking Tosen. Renji might take down that gladiator themed guy with the help of one or two others, at least I hope his fight against that Star faggot was not the last we saw in the series.<br><br><br>Shunsui might fight Haschwalth or something like that. The last cpt. commander already jobbed against Ywach so I don't expect the next to do the same mistake. Ishin and Ryuuken are bound to show up some time though I highly doubt that Tessai will show up since Kubo might have forgotten about him completely. Ginjo and the others are there to jobb. Byakuya might tagteam one of those Quincy and as will Yoruichi. Aizen, Urahara, Kenpachi, Ichigo and the fifth war potential (who the fuck? maybe Ishida that flaming faggot) will go up against Ywach.<br><br><br>Shuhei is out man, it'll be fucking bullshit if he stands up after that one. It's dumb as fuck though, what good is it to tease a bankai (even more than just once) that's never going to be revealed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're a scientist who basically made a large chunk of his early career on the study of fucking Quincy then I really shouldn't need to explain this to you. Do you even induction? Deduction? Fuck, it's not magic, it's literally just particle manipulation. And it doesn't just apply to the Quincy either. You're an absolute retard, don't bother replying.</br>  <br> implying taking off the eyepatch will protect him from hax powers or heal his wounds </br>  <br>that's bullshit anon. Just admit you have forgotten that he did not have his bankai. He might have gotten physically stronger but no new bankai for him.</br>  <br>Zaraki's entire purpose of being there with Mayuri is to boost Mayuri's wow-thats-so-fucking-cool factor. Kubo is simply playing favorites with a captain we have limited information about. Remember Zaraki's fight with the sternritter imagination? Same stuff.</br>  <br>That was pre-awakened Kenpachi. Just saying.</br>  <br>There is literally nothing he can deduce from just seeing these powers twice<br><br>Like nothing about watching the V- Vanish would tell you he was manifested by someone with imagination powers or that Superstar was a puppet body for james.</br></br></br>  <br> implying limitless reiatsu pressure wouldn't suppress any quincy power </br>  <br>Except it's literal fucking magic you stupid twat. The bleach universe doesn't even have a set of rules to follow to accurately deduct anything when it comes to power-levels. Kubo going "b-but he's a scientist!" is just a shitty cop-out.</br>  <br>fagit</br>  <br>No I'm pretty sure you're just a retard. <br> quincy can pump reishi through the body <br> Pernidas attack removes control of Kenpachi motor control, arm contorts of its own volition <br> uses paralysis on kenpachi- tests hypothesis  <br>It's the scientific method. It's barely even an ability, it's just logical reasoning.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for level -1 reading. Go back and start from chapter one, you clearly missed something important.</br>  <br> quincy can control and pump reishi <br> instead of using nerves it's some sort of pseudo telekinesis <br> mayuri just paralyzed their greatest asset for some shitty guess <br><br>Hell there is nothing there that lets you know it was nerve control and not mind control or any of the other various stern ritter powers we saw.<br><br>The V-Visionary should be able to do the samething pernida does without any of the nerve shit. Then mayuri would be looking like an idiot.<br><br>There is no way to tell what's going on or the opponent's power is with just sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean the trees that were grown from one of the Royal Guard's body? They probably had nerves too.</br></br>  <br><br> Reishi density? I'm talking more about a way to accurately to predict or deduce specific powers, not power-levels, my bad.</br></br>  <br>You know he's shown he can flip that shit on and off at will.<br><br> Oop I poked you with my sword and you're paralyzed <br> didn't work <br> guess I'll unparalyze you and probably magic your arm back too <br> why not have a free powerup while we're at it because science </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fucking who?</br></br>  <br>the classical musician<br><br>rip</br></br></br>  Bleach is worse than Naruto now.<br><br>How can a series devolve so much? It's absurd.</br></br>  Remember when mayuri was blown the fuck out by hitsugaya 10 times in a row?   now <br>it has been worse than Naruto since the end of Aizen arc and generally not that good since the end of Soul society arc.</br>  anyone got and cool bleach 1080x1920 s4 wallpapers  <br>I agree</br>  T-they are fine, r-right?<br>Gigi too</br>  How do we defeat Yhwach?  <br>about as fine as hitsugaya and kira</br>  <br> Hitsugaya <br><br>Oh so they're o-<br><br> Kira <br><br>Getting mixed messages here anon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can someone explain what exactly mayuri did when he stabbed kenpachi? Mangapanda is fucking impossible to decipher sometimes.  <br>reach is heart. He will abandon everything, die, and thanks the heros.</br>  <br><br>You don't. Yhwach will be betrayed by Uryu and then Uryu will sacrifice himself.</br></br>   Yamamoto dies <br> Captains not wearing the haori <br><br>For shame.</br></br></br>  <br>They're both dead ghosts, the fact that one was a zombie ghost doesn't change that without his master he is probably a dead ghost zombie. Or a dead zombie ghost. Man why the fuck did they have to include that dumb power.</br>  <br><br>His shikai ability paralyzes whoever it cuts. I have no idea what the screech did.</br></br>  <br>ichigo will receive a powerup and kill him the end</br>  Poor Kenpachi. He's being used like he's a Nemu.<br><br>Gremmy might be about as badass a fight as he gets.<br><br>Hopefully he can get to use his true shikai.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yamamoto dies <br> All the captains except based Kurotsuchi job <br><br>That's what you get for not applying your rape culture enough.</br></br></br></br>  Do I have to do everything myself?   has won every single battle without any injury, always toying with the enemy in creative ways, always having a countermasure for everything, regardless of how powerful the enemy is <br> has only lost to a surprise "if I use THAT i will lose all my powers" attack, and everyone knows this kind of attack is only second to friendship powerups <br><br>Is Mayuri Batman? I think he could defeat every single bleach character without even trying, except maybe bach with "almighty" on, aizen in butterfly form, ichigo in mugetsu/friendship/plotkai mode and maybe the mad monk and yamamoto.<br><br>He is the only one worthy of being a captain, everyone else is just ridiculous.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There will never be a fight between Urahara and Mayuri trying to out science each other to gain the upper hand in combat. </br>  <br><br>It's been pretty apparent since the beginning that Kubo loves writing keikaku doori scientist characters. <br><br>When you think about it, Urahara, Aizen and Mayuri have never really lost. Aizen is literally getting stronger every second even while sealed in the comfiest chair in the universe, Urahara is still mysterious as fuck and Mayuri's only loss was simply him turning himself to liquid and leaving the battle (having infected his opponent with tracking devices and forcing him to use an ability that would make him unable to ever use his powers again).</br></br></br></br>  <br>11/10</br>   Unohana died for this retard <br>Damn, I'm still mad.</br>  <br>8/10, you missed one panel there anon</br>  <br>lolreiatsu and keikakus, hyogoku and nakama power.</br>  <br><br>Yhawch gets accelerated ghost cancer. As he dies he reaches out to Ichigo and the final page is <br><br><br>THE HEART<br><br>written by Kubotite</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is that Kenpachi's face in the bottom right? Holy shit I only just worked it out.</br></br>  kubo is an talentless hack  <br>what else is new</br>    <br>Pernida's ability seems to be utilizing target's strength.</br>  <br> Mayuri have never really lost. Aizen is literally getting stronger every second even while sealed in the comfiest chair in the universe <br>Why? Up until she died she had no character didn't even participate in the final battle against aizen or any battle for that matter.</br></br>  <br>Sauce</br>  <br>because you are doing god's work anon.</br>  What was Zaraki's shikai power again?<br>On the release the said something like "devour" or "engulf". But I don't recall his shikai being explained.</br>  <br>Momo, what a big body you have!</br>  <br>Ayyyy it can't be helped.</br>  <br><br><br>His shikai ability only paralyzes the limbs, the screech paralyzed everything else.</br></br></br>  <br>His shikai doesn't have a defined power. It's just a fuck huge sword.</br>  <br>It just cuts things.<br><br>Is Zaraki out for the count now, or will someone heal him again? Recently it seems that his job has been tanking strong attacks of the bad guys.</br></br></br>  <br> werewolf Komamura <br>I almost forgot about it. Shit was broken as fuck but I liked his new image</br></br>  <br>Kubo will never fail to find an excuse to slip his amputation fetish into Bleach.</br>  <br>I don't think you need us to answer that for you, anon.</br>  <br> I expect Shinji to finally deliver because jesus fucking christ his character deserves some dignity back after jobbing against nonvolständig Quincy and being held of by fucking Tosen. <br><br>Bazz-B was actually one of the strongest Sternritters and he ended up not really doing anything to Shinji so that one most likely ended as a draw. And Tousen was one of the strongest motherfuckers in the Winter War so I don't see how that's anything to complain about.<br><br>That said, he could have defeated all of the above if he actually used his broken zanpaktou<br>instead of monologuing like an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It hits you really really hard.</br></br>  <br>Momo's bankai is a meta-bankai<br><br>It allows her to be swapped with whoever has been stabbed in the manga in any moment in time, so she can save them</br></br></br>  <br>Hitsugaya was confirmed to have been still alive before being zombified, making it a transformation closer to voodoo than walking dead. As such he still has potential to return to normal, or something close to normal, it's all in the hands of Mayuri now.</br>  <br>shinji will deliver vs lille. Lille's power is absolute, but only a very narrow field of fire.<br><br> he'll get oneshot right after confusing lille </br></br></br>  Who Dragon Quest here?  <br> go to reddit <br> check r/bleach <br> this has been posted there <br><br>i don't know what i expected</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And yet Kubo insists on writing brute-force "my powerlevel is bigger than yours" fights. <br><br>The ransom asspulls he keeps resorting to all the time would be much more bearable if they were handwaved with "it's science, and I'm hella smart, don't have to explain shit" than "reiatsu, that is all."</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did kubo draw that?</br></br>    <br><br>That's what you get for going to Reddit</br></br>  <br> kenpachis bankai </br>  <br>No, his twin brother, Kobu</br>  <br> shinji will deliver vs lille <br>This, I could see a Shinji vs Lille coming a mile away<br><br> Shinji is still free to fight <br> Still needs to show bankai <br> Fucker needs to win at least once come on <br> His power is messing with directions <br> Lille Barro has an ultrapowerful but straight-shot directional attack <br><br>It's fucking obvious</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Kubo gets invited by Square Enix to talk in a Dragon Quest event <br><br> Kubo just ends up mocking his gaming buddy saying he got him to "lend" an enormous shit ton pile of money without ever returning </br></br></br></br>  <br>I expect him to pull this on Lille, then just get shot anyways when he won't shut the fuck up.</br>  <br> &gt;Fucker needs to win at least once come on <br>Ahahahahahaha</br></br>  <br>Why are you posting a shitty downscaled version from facebook?</br>  zaraki woulda won eventually   Of all people, Hisagi is the one who gets sniped by X nigger <br><br>I know Kubo is actually healing character much faster this arc, Yumichika and Ikkaku get getting up despite getting their asses kicked constantly but fuck, is kubo ever showing Yumichika's and Hisagi's bankai?<br><br>Just make up some lower tier characters and give them a decent fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bankais we will never ever see:<br>Vizards<br>Kyoraku<br>Ukitake<br>Zero Division</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you'll get Byakuya owning in yet another fight and you will like it</br>  <br>I feel bad for the lower tier characters, the only villains left are all monsters</br>  <br><br> Zero Division <br><br>They're practically confirmed to be working for Bach now that he's the "new" Soul King. They'll be added to the enemy line protecting him. <br><br>There's a reason why Kubo barely showed any of their abilities in their first fights with the exception of Rape Culture Monk. They're going to show their A game now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They do in Bleach.</br>  <br> not Job "Jobber" Mc job Monk The Jobber </br>  <br>Matsumoto had her entire stomach plug ripped out.<br><br>For all we know Kira is still alive.</br></br></br>  ERmm ... Kubo ? <br><br>  Yfw Kubo is a huge Bon Jovi fan </br></br>  <br><br>I thought Kira was confirmed ded?</br></br>  <br>I think for a long time after the soul society arc, he didn't. Then he kinda stopped giving fucks and seemed to enjoy coming up with all kind of stuff with the nazis.</br>  <br>There was an implication that it has an absorbing/disintigrating/'eating' kind of power.</br>  <br>Kira was confirmed dead.</br>  <br><br>Sauce?</br></br>  <br>"Bleach the dagger", google it.</br>  <br> implying hisagi wont get to kills the nigger </br>  <br>Isn't the Dagger just a collection of editor's notes and has nothing written by Kubo himself?</br>  <br>Sorry, but killing niggers is Byakuya's job.</br>  <br>I don't have a source that confirms that kubo did it and yeah there is a good chance that an editor did it for him, but the dagger was released during the 5 week break, so Kubo definitely had enough time to confirm the things written in there and well Kira being 100% death is one of them.</br>  God damn it, Kubo.  <br>they don't lmao</br>  <br>Ukitake<br><br>BTFO<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, Kubo has been giving even more bizarre enemies to Zaraki fight with. Weird pairings as said in another thread. Reality breakers, sense numbers and limb torning aberrations, etc are all but interesting fight to see he deal with it since physical threats are not a challenge to him anymore.</br>   13 Blades cover revealed <br><br> It's going to have drawings from guest manga authors <br><br>Hope Araki and Murata are included in that guest list.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Top meme</br></br>  <br> Gin <br>too soon</br></br>  <br><br>Gerard might be a challenge. I assume his physical abilities are augmented by whatever the miracle does.</br></br>  <br><br>You know what, I think the ressurection was his doing. Everyone else displayed their letter based powera except him in the fight against the royal guard.</br></br>  <br>Because he's  Aizen[\spoiler], anon. </br>  <br>No there was not.</br>  <br> Ukitake <br> no awesome lightning &amp; water elemental weapon <br>I'm salty.<br><br>also<br> we will never know the name of Tetsuzaemon's sword and it's release command <br> we will never see Yoruichi's sword nor get to know it's name <br> we will never see Ichigo's other friends get powers <br> we will never see full body devil Chad <br> Tsubaki is ded <br> we will never see Kira again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember how Hisagi vs Exacta was practically the best animated fight of the FKT arc.</br>  <br> Yoruichi's sword  <br> Soifon on uses it</br></br>  <br><br>I remember how they re-used the exact same animations for the Ichigo vs Ulquiorra fight</br></br>  <br>soifon is such a qt</br>  <br> Tsubaki is ded <br>But Hachi brought him back.</br></br>  <br>Sweet Yama  ;_;7 </br>  <br>soifon is going to rape/marry the yoruichi shota in the finale after the big bad is dad</br>  <br>Kubo has really weird idea about Hisagi. It's like he was in the perpetual loop of "Hm... I think I will make Hisagi important" and "Nah, fuck Hisagi after all". Rinse and repeat.</br>  <br><br>Because he was actually a very famous character in the manga, despite barely doing jackshit during the Soul Society arc. Then Kubo gave him the Exacta fight and it had huge ratings in SJ. The anime team capitalized on that and gave his fight a big budget and a competent animation team.<br><br>But then again, Kubo doesn't give a shit about popularity for the most part, which is why Hisagi and Hitsugaya are doing nothing but getting their shit pushed in and Mayuri, an extremely unpopular character, gets a bunch of panel time kicking ass and employing GHOST SCIENCE because he's one of Kubo personal favorite characters.<br><br>That said, I'd like to see Hisagi's bankai. His shikai is pretty cool and has a nice theme going for Hisagi's character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri's science shit is BS<br><br>how did he ever fucking lose his first fight</br></br></br>  <br>He's just playing a game.<br>"How many times can I make Hisagi look like a bitch before it's time to show his bankai?"  He won't show his bankai </br></br>  <br>Does kubo really have that for a profile picture?</br>  <br>He didn't even lose. He left Uryuu to die while surviving himself</br>  <br><br>Because all the science in the world wont save you from getting your shit nuked.<br><br>Same reason Yhwach with all his allmighty bullshit still lost to Yamamoto a thousand years ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, they have Omaeda.</br>  <br>He still had a dick at that time, grave mistake.</br>  <br>Talking about corpses. Where are the Espada and Zombie Squad? They could be useful now.</br>  <br><br> with my A i can see the future you are powerless to stop me <br> all he can see is fire </br></br></br>  <br>But he should've known Nemu had the antidote. Plot-induced stupidity?</br>  <br> Implying Uiharu won't use her time reversal healing powers to give him back his arm. </br>  <br> Grimmjow jobs <br> Zombie Squad could be useful </br></br>  <br><br>How could he have guessed that Nemu would betray him?</br></br>  <br> through some convenient plot device <br>Uryu's father shot him in the same spiritual organs where Byakuya stabbed Ichigo in their first meeting. Ichigo lost powers that weren't his to begin with, Uryu got his back.<br>It's like pottery.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if he could've predicted that, but Nemu was paralyzed anyway. If Uryu had tried to search her on his own, she couldn't have done anything to stop him. At the very least, Mayuri should've destroyed the antidote if he really wanted Uryu to die.</br>  <br>Yes. Because Gremmys fuck huge meteor was annihilated. Either it was vaporized of consumed.</br>  <br><br>Nah it's clearly Chads.<br>Who else has a black with red lines color scheme?</br></br></br>  <br><br>He was a pool of liquid, i don't think he was in the position to do anything.</br></br>  <br> one and togashi will include their scribbles </br>  <br> implying he's not </br>  <br>he could still shittalk</br>  <br>dont forget miura</br>  <br>Because Gremmy is literally unbeatable as Kubo wrote him and what you said is just 1001st way of him killing any opponent while sustaining no damage whatsoever.</br>   the fullbringers are still on their way <br>Come the fuck on, I want the shinigamis from the second arc fully fleshed out already. I have been so hyped about all dem sword releases since that cool as fuck ending showing all 13 squads separately.</br>  <br>Nice meme.<br><br>First fight was a draw, he didn't win but he survived. <br><br>Syazel losing was glorious because he basically defeated himself. Not a lot of people remember that.<br><br>Having studied the Quincy for years gave him a very particular advantage this time around, not to mention he brought extra fodder with his revived Arrancar. He'll probably get killed by Uryu and that will be the end of it, but the ride will have been glorious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't even have to be clones of himself<br><br>He literally created another being with it's own power<br><br>He never has to reveal who he actually is. There could be a billion different people<br><br>He could imagine the entire dbz cast. Ywach gave him the imagination power because he literally has none at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yhwach see's he's going to lose <br> still has to fight yama and get roasted </br></br>  <br>You are an idiot. He obliterated it with one swing. You're misconception has become a retarded headcanon, which you should dismiss before you continue to spew verbal diarrhea</br>  <br><br> Yes. Because Gremmys fuck huge meteor was annihilated <br><br>Uhm, yes, that is literally what happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah Uryu is going to "prove" Jugo/Ywatch that he's loyal by killing Mayuri</br>  <br>what is that? the next databook or what?</br>  <br>what is heart?</br>  <br><br>Thanks for correcting me, guys.</br></br>  Weekly reminder that Senna is canon  <br>How many people haven't showed their Bankai yet?</br>  <br>He used the nerve paralyzing shit. Guess why he deduced that's a power based on nerves, you schmuck?</br>  <br>Lille is probably the most based SR. Fuck off.</br>  <br>He current Shikai is now as powerful as his old Bankai. Logically, his current Bankai should be more powerful than his old Bankai.</br>  <br><br>Shunsui, Aizen, Urahara, Yoruichi, Ukitake, Hisagi, Yumichika, Ichigo(he probably has a new one), every Royal Guard except for the Monk and Kenpachi.</br></br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>post 3 bankai that you are interested in the most:<br>Urahara<br>Isshin<br>Kyoraku</br></br></br></br>  <br> Lille <br> Not goofball Aizen impersonator </br></br>  <br>Replace Kyoraku with Aizen, and it's perfect.</br>  <br> Shinji ever winning a fight <br><br>Give it a rest.

Got derped by Bambietta, what makes you think he stands a chance against the elites?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I forgot the Vizards and Ishiin and Tessai, but can you blame me?</br></br>  <br>Aizen<br>Shunsui<br>Ukitake</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, Bambi's blasts were OP as hell<br>It took a dude going God Mode to beat her</br></br>  <br><br>Shunsui<br>Aizen<br>Urahara<br><br>In that order.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yachiru bankai/ new form since shes fucking small<br>ichigo bankaibankai<br>momo bankai</br></br></br>  <br><br>She was strong but she wasn't that OP, her ability being "anything i touch explodes" just means that anyone with speed or ranged attacks could've killed her.</br></br>  <br>isnt yachiru real zaraki sword? like starrk and lilynette?</br>  <br> white bones (death) after black clothes (Kyoraku's final attack) <br>This page was before Starkk died, right?<br><br>Foreshadowing, everywhere.</br></br></br></br>    <br>actually, his point was pretty spot on<br>had he released his shikai, he probably would have killed pernida.<br>But as we know, Kenpachi's not good at estimating how much power is going to be needed.</br></br></br>  <br>more like</br>  <br> Wii, Wii U and Windows <br>Fucking japs I swear</br></br>  <br> Demotivations <br><br>Did I travel back in time to 2007?</br></br></br>  <br>nice digits.<br><br>I'm actually starting to like the elite 4. Askin is hilarious in ever panel he's in, Lille's pretty based and Thor is pretty neat as well. 3/4 aint bad. Most of the sternritters are crap, but these guys aint so bad</br></br></br>  <br>Hisagi's problem is that ultimately he's a jobber who's big, foreshadowed mentor figure is an even bigger jobber. Don't forget that Hisagi was hyped up quite a bit during the SS arc just so it was a big deal when Yumichika beat him.</br>  <br>I hate Lille's stupid name and his shitty hairy gun.<br>The rest are cool.</br></br>    <br><br>Silly anon, you never left 2007.</br></br>  <br><br>Thor literally hasn't done shit except for falling down and dying instantaneously.</br></br>  <br>tbh, comparing the sternritter to the entire arrancar cast (which is probably a better fit than just the espada) the turn out pretty well.</br>  <br>2008; obamas still president</br>  <br> pupetto mapetto </br>    <br>ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING</br>    <br>Yachiru and Yachiru are actually the same person.</br>  <br> foreshadowing kenny's death <br>b-but possible bankai a-anon   ;_; </br></br>    <br>i see nothing wrong with another transforming character</br>  <br>Yamamoto's butler VC that got rekt by the Overkill.

Every character has bad shit happening to them.<br><br>Every single one of them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why did Zaraki became Yamcha?  <br>Well I guess that explains why Bleach tag on pixiv is slowly updated and most is shit.</br>  <br>Except he's completely unlikable and selfish, not very good qualities for a main character in a shounen. Ichigo is boring but his good qualities are well developed.</br>  <br>Some is quite fun.</br>  <br>tfw Nnoitra is dead<br><br>tfw all couples or duos are dead<br><br>tfw rukia will die too no doubt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>until kubo asspull allows her to transform<br>she's been around a long time anon.<br>ever ichigo asked what she was</br></br></br>  <br> Mayuri <br> unlikable </br></br>  <br>We still have true romance. Aizen and Aizen are still alive.</br>  <br>He beat the strongest Quincy outside of Juda, and is called one of the strongest Shinigami ever now who has surpassed the original Zaraki.<br><br>However when characters are all grouped up fighting, individually they tend to do worse.<br><br><br>She's Kenpachi's zanpakuto spirit come to life, just like Stark and Lilynette<br><br>You'd notice that her clothes were found after Zaraki unleashed his Shikai, since he now remembered its true name, the spell was broken and he couldn't lie to himself. She reacted at the time as well pretty heavily, like "Ken chan, you finally", and we never saw her again as Zaraki started panicking after the battle when he couldn't find her. <br><br>One day a man only knew solitude, so he created a friend. Some pink haired baby walked up to him on the battle field, but did not fear him, and they became the best of friends.<br><br>However from the start they were two in one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mayuri didn't even have to stab Kenpachi right through the torso. Just a scratch would've been enough.<br><br>What a dick.</br></br>  <br>fuck that's sad</br>  <br>Stab in the heart is the fastest way to spread the paralysis you dummy</br>  <br>Kenpachi's fault for acting like a retard.<br>Not like that stabbing him will kill him anyway.</br></br>  <br>It would take longer for the paralysis to take effect from a scratch.<br><br>It would also be less amusing.</br></br></br>  Still wondering when Juha will pull this out  <br><br><br>here comes the MIDF</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like how he has a specific solution to everything like Batman and his "anti-shark bat spray". Unless he's fighting completely out of his league (which never happens) you can be sure that he'll pull something out of his ass to win.</br>  <br>I swear that Kubo faps over Mayuri more than Aizen.</br>  <br>tfw most of ichigo's powers were foreshadowed in volume 8</br>  <br>I like how this unique training method was specifically tailored to unlocking Ichigo's bankai. There were so many swords around and Ichigo had to check all of them in a very tight timeline, so he had to develop super speed.</br>  <br>I find it way more interesting than the usual battle stratagem of behind you + power ups.</br>  <br> Mr. Steele helped Johnny get on a horse, so then he was able to shoot himself with an opposite rotation with Act 3. <br><br>The end of SBR was kind of bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>That was just NOT-Zangetsu's way of training Ichigo. Urahara's doll only forces the zanpakuto to start the bankai training. I bet that other zans would have different ways.</br>  <br> behind you <br>When was the last time someone pulled this off?<br>Waiting for it to happen between Ichigo and Yhwach.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's what I meant. At the time I didn't really see the point but it's clear now.<br><br>I wonder what the other bankai training sessions looked like. Maybe renji had to practice throwing a lasso or something.</br></br></br>  <br>no no and no<br><br>speed had nothing to do with finding the correct sword<br><br>secondly Ichigos bankai is the direct representation of his will to acquire power faster</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>renji woke up in bed with zabimaru next to him</br>  <br>Yamato's Lieutenant who died a while back.</br>   What is the best Bankai and Shikai? <br><br>Post your favorite Bankai and Shikai.</br></br>  <br>Yhwach x the monk was entirely behind yous.</br>  <br>He had trained with Zabimaru for years though. He only came to the cave to finish it.<br><br>Naturally it's just a lot of hard work and meditation with your zan, like what Ikkaku did in Karakura or what Ichigo did in the Dangai. Fighting with your inner self, verbally and metaphysically.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Favorite Shikai Ichimonji<br><br>Favorite Bankai Zanka no Tachi</br></br></br></br>  <br>Urahara's training method had nothing to do with the sword gimmick, that was yhwachgetsu's thing. Normally the whole sword thing requires learning to go into your inner world and talk with the spirit, then learning to bring the spirit out and talk to it. Urahara's doll sidestepped all the soul searching and meditation and just yanks the spirit right out to force it to converse that way.</br>    <br>in case anyone need some reminders</br>  <br>Lucky.</br>  <br> bankai <br>Hchigo/Zangetsu's bankais<br> shikai <br>pimp cane of the red princess</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shikai - Yumichika one<br>Bankai - propably ice shota dragon, but Yamamoto was great too</br></br>  <br>That shota needs a good dicking.</br>  <br><br>Best Shikai is Shunsui's<br><br>Best Bankai is Gin's</br></br></br></br>    <br> sokuykou hill execution bird shikai <br>of who? it wasn't yamma's</br></br>  <br>Mayuri's Caterpillar with a baby head thing</br>  <br>Are you so retarded that you do not understand how the circulatory system works?

It's Thursday? Time for another chapter of Bleach full of lame new characters nobody gives two fucks about? Great!  <br> Shikai <br>Benihime<br><br> Bankai <br>Konjiki Ashisogi Jizo</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>back when I was compiling those I misremembered a line about the souyoku being "made from a thousand zanpakutou" or something to that effect and considered that implication to be that it's a zanpakutou, albeit a highly unusual one. I realized I was mistaken but never took the time to go back and fix it realigning all the other pages.</br>  <br>True he isn't like that gay homo from bakemonogatari. You know the guy who stole from people and thought it was edgy doing it?</br>  <br>step back and watch closely</br>  <br>His true weakness was his reiryoku reserves<br><br>His weakness of imagination was negated by him creating multiple clones</br></br></br>  <br>actually it was this form</br>  <br>I wonder if the Soukyoku is made from the shinigami who fell in the war a thousand years ago, or 200. It would make sense that the zans would've been collected immediately, as otherwise they would've likely disintegrated if they were collected on a long time span. Although we don't know what happens to zans after their owner dies; at least Kenny's and Yama's zans were intact afterwards.</br>  <br><br>I never realized Zabimaru can fuck himself up the ass whenever he wants</br></br>    <br>and if it's a pheonix shikai they might rise again!<br><br><br>kek snekseks</br></br></br></br>  <br> himself </br>  <br>The line I had remembered incorrectly just said it was a strong as a thousand or however many zanpakutou, not that it was made from them.</br>  The sokyokou apparently had the power of one million zanpakuto, whatever that means. And everybody was super shocked that Ichigo could stop it, it was supposed to be impossible. But then later Byakuya was sparring on par with Ichigo. So does that mean any of the Captains can stop the Sokyokou?  <br>whats this?</br>  <br>shunsui and ukitake sealed it</br>  <br>maybe there was just never anyone in 2000 years dumb enough to jump in front of the capital punishment bird and try hitting it.</br>  <br><br> tfw a woman has a bigger assdick than you </br></br>  <br><br>The next data book. It comes out august 4th. They've been advertising it in wsj all year, where have you been?</br></br>  <br>It was foreshadowing Ichigo's Quincy powers.</br>  <br>clearly the Reio's</br>  <br>Yeah. ZabiMARU is a guy and always has been. Do you even read Bleach?</br>  Actually they do. Don't forget that shinigami use time and space magic in healing. Also several characters have regen abilities. Yamamoto didn't regrow his arm out of a sense of guilt for Ichigo and co, Soifon had no problems whatsoever restoring her own lost arm. Losing an arm is only a temporary inconvenience. Might be a permanent one if you don't know any good healers.  <br>I only read Bleach. is it being translated to english? or will we get screwed out of it like unmasked?</br>  I miss this smug asshole. You guys think he'll ever come back?  <br>did you think wsj would print the bleach ads somewhere other than with the bleach chapters each week?</br>      <br>Sorry i am not as cool as you. please impart your fathomless knowledge upon me.</br>  <br>In the anime the monkey part of Zabimaru is a woman.</br>  <br>His power is not absolute, his range of effect and effectiveness are both limited by what he can visualize. As far as reality bending powers go, it's pretty OP and it made him unbeatable in any form of combat, so he never bothered to avoid an attack, or hide himself from the enemy.<br>It was a mix of arrogance and lack of imagination that killed him. It's too far fetched considering that he was just a brain in a vat. He got drunk on power, thought of himself an god and lost.</br></br>  <br><br>Just saying, it's been several months, it's been at the top of the website, and there've been the polls and all. But consider your sarcastic apology sarcastically accepted.</br></br>  <br>That was filler you fool</br>  <br>Aizen's return had like 16 threads that week and more the following, likely surpassing Juha/Zangetsu reveal, yet it only got a single panel. The hype really died down with the second invasion, it went from a panel every 1-3 chapters to every 5-10 with some that were forced in between because it looked too plain.</br>  <br>That actually came from an omake. Renji paid Mayuri for a sex change.</br>  <br>his final words to ichigo</br>  <br>No, in the anime Mayuri performed a cosmetic operation on the male zabimaru.</br>  <br>The zanpakuto designs are Kubo's, and canon. The story itself isn't.</br>    <br>But it proves Zabimaru was not ALWAYS male, as you claim, and it lasted for an entire arc.</br>  <br>Literally not how canon works. Not even close.</br>  <br>tumblr gtfo. zabimaru was always a nue. that joke about changing its sex in the data book was exactly that : a joke.</br>  <br>Man not much has actually happened in awhile, has it?</br>  <br>Oh wow you actually don't understand how "proof" works. Are you in like 4th grade and doing really badly in science class or are you just retarded?</br>  <br>We saw the cover weeks ago, just not in full color. Also that's a god awful looking scan.</br>  <br>I think everyone just got tired of updating it.</br>  <br>where's the fucking updated chart?</br>  <br>dat Unohana....  ;_; </br>  <br>I'm actually glad Bleach had it's 10th anniversary guest art skipped. Had they done it back in 2012 then Shun Saeki wouldn't have been drawing Sokugeki no Soma and wouldn't be here to give us delicious Bleach fanart.</br>  <br><br>Zangetsu brutally curbstomping quincy when?</br></br>  <br> tumblr gtfo <br> post a tumblr gif </br></br>  <br>At a guess? never</br>  <br> zangetsu turns into old man again and goes up to ywach, asspulls with 'i am you' and commits suicide to kill ywach <br>'goodbye again, ichigo'</br></br>  <br>saved from Bleach threads. sorry if i dont go all sherlock holmes on everything i save. pls 4giv</br>  <br>No, it's you who doesn't understand how people's memory works. Zabimaru was a woman once in the anime, people saw that, people remember.

She'll remember that when Kyouko and Yui start dating and you try to come back to Chitose as a backup plan. She will drink the delicious tears falling from your eyes, then leave you in a pool of misery. <br><br>But go ahead. Keep making fun of the only friend you've ever had.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you can't even spell her name right you might aswell just leave</br>  <br>Great! It's a start.</br>  <br><br>Stop trying to corrupt his mind, liking anybody but Yui is intolerable and disgusting.</br></br>  <br>Let's be fair, I think the Coalgirls release uses Kyoko, and that's the most well-known one.

Just one of the reasons why I love her. </br></br>    <br><br>China is morally ambiguous, due mostly in part to her social retardation, and that's part of why I enjoy her character so much. It's not like Namori is blind to this fact, in fact she revels in it and loves pulling out that particular side of her character when the viewer/reader least expects it. In a genre full of good girls, China is pretty refreshing for me.<br><br>Even if their relationship is essentially Stockholm Syndrome, I think it's developing slowly into something incredibly cute. I know it's Namori, and YRYR doesn't exactly like to advance the plot, but I will have a heartgasm the day China finally realizes it's Akari she loves and she only creeps on Yui because of her obsession with idealistic princess/prince romance. Chapter 100 is coming up, who knows? Maybe something crazy will happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't worry, Yui. She loves you too.</br></br>  <br>Kyouko puts out all the time.</br>  <br><br>One day she will add all the Amusement Club and Student Council to her harem, as she drags them around on lesbian adventures.<br><br> Akari still won't get any though. </br></br></br></br>    <br>Obviously, who couldn't love her?</br>  <br><br>N-Nande?</br></br>  <br>Akari is a good girl.</br>  <br>The harem is Ayano's.</br>  <br>inappropriate</br>  <br>In the short interludes in the episodes where two yurus are running and their name is in the background, Kyouko is clearly spelled 'Kyouko'.

What happens when the little girls are no longer little girls?  <br>No. They're stuck in a timeloop.</br>  <br>As if Chinatsu will ever join her harem.  She and Akari will have lesbian hijinks of their own. </br>  <br>B-but Kyouko x Akari is my OTP.</br>  <br>Holy mother of Godoka Akari is best girl.</br>  Soooo, did yui confess to kyouko already?  <br>I don't know what you're talking about, but Yui isn't gay if that's what you mean.</br>  <br>Yui'd only confess to Ayano if anything.</br>    <br>I believe some form of validation is in order.</br>  <br>Have you ever see her pursue another girl romantically or sexually?</br>  <br><br>When has Yui shown sexual interest in a man?

He felt like Guts was acting 'too cool' or too good for that life and resented him for it among other things.</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense. But Guts was just trying to be Griffith's equal. To have his own dream, to tread his own path.</br>  Can we get some respect for the Tapasa that not only pasted Raksas with that column, but threw it in anticipation for where he would rebound to.<br><br>I mean, before those guys couldn't even land a punch on him.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Holy fuck keep em coming. Ill try to retrieve my sides from orbit.</br></br></br></br>  If you could choose your own stand what would it be?  <br>I've always wanted Killer Queen just because it had cat ears. I just want to touch them.</br>  made in heaven  <br>Cheap Trick</br>  Supa Hot Fire  Foul feats fulfilled at a bargain  <br>Za Warudo or Emperor - both those are baller as fuck</br>  <br>Isn't Emperor essentially just a gun.</br>  <br> Improves user's reflexes and reactions <br> stealth weapon, can summon whenever <br> HOMING. BULLETS. <br>Yeah, but it'll still be a great stand for general life and i wonder if you could ever learn double up and dual wield</br></br></br></br>   not wanting Death 13 <br>do you even lali ho?</br>  <br>I want MILF hunter Kekyoin as my stando</br>  Catch the Rainbow. It wouldn't be the most useful stand, but it'd be the one that would give me the most fun.  I think heaven's door would be awesome because you could just go around reading about peoples lives and shit. Also being able to force people's will by writing rules on them is so powerful.  <br>Uncleanly doings made cheaply</br>  <br><br>Hard to say, but Heaven's Door is fucking OP.</br></br>  Schlong Slinger  Easily Star Platinum<br>Stronk as fuck and I would be able to draw so well I wouldn't need the manga aspect of Heavens Door. Plus time stop and I'm basically set, plus all the plot armor. Second would be Tusk because it just seems like a neat stand</br>  Id need a straight forward powerful one like star platinum or something, im not clever like a jojo character so i couldnt make the weaker ones work. And its important to be blatantly overpowered because stand users being drawn to eachother means id have to encounter some of you faggots.  Mandom.<br><br>There are so many applications of reversing 6 seconds in my life. Cheating the fuck out of RNG is the main one.<br><br>I don't need some bulletproof iron-wrenching punch ghost. I need the ability to undo my mistakes.</br></br></br></br>  Strength.<br><br>I've always wanted a boat.</br></br>  <br>If /a/nons with stands often encountered each other do you think we'd fight? I'm pretty sure we'd just wank to the fact we have stands</br>  <br>That hair looks really out of place, it really looks flat as fuck compared to everything else.</br>  "Razzmatazz"<br>It'd literally be the soul of Frank Sinatra</br>  <br>It'd be the scene where Polnareff and Kakyoin do the secret handshake, only stretched out over our entire meeting.<br><br>I'm absolutely sure you faggots would fight eachother though, just to jerk over the fact that you can. And of course there's be that one guy who had to make everyone his fuckboys.</br></br></br>  <br>i forgot the ability again, freezing raindrops midair and walking on them right?</br>  So who was stronger SP or the world? Dio did punch through SP's attacks but was he just lucky? Yes SP ultimately did kill the world but that's because Dio was already hurt  <br>I'd be friends with you anon. We could fight all the fuck boys together, because be honest, some fighting with your SUTANDO POWA does seem cool. <br>On some basic stuff what would people use their stand the most for? I'd probably  use the stand to get the remote and get me a drink <br><br>Yeah<br><br>They seem about equal, I'd say SP is stronger just due to the compensation for it's range while The World has a much larger range in comparison</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Run the Jewels<br><br>Ability to move at a fast acceleration, hide and store objects</br></br>  <br>I like the reference <br>I'd do King Krule <br>When it hits someone they experience their worst experiences and or feel an extremely heavy drug trip, of course with the ability to weaken said trips</br></br></br>  <br>If I had time stop or whatever, lewd shit, for sure. Or I'd use it to get myself some easy cash and live the good life. I'd basically go full NEET like DIO did.</br>  Heaven's Door or maybe Diver Down they both seem pretty cool. I wouldn't want a combat stand, because it seems really fucking useless.  <br>But anon, that's unjust. I would do the lewd though. Would sign up for those "Strongest man" tv shows and use SP to lift</br>  <br>I'd say what really makes a difference between SP and the world is the users. Dio being a vampire gives him a much longer time stop duration, but I think jotaro's wits makes him and his SP stronger in the end.</br>  <br>It fits well after affect should be insomnia</br>  <br>I was thinking of that, but also an effect on the user from over use would be insomnia.  I want to write a JoJo knock off with all the potential music references I know Araki doesn't listen to. </br>  Crazy Diamond for sure. Just seems to match my personality  <br>a stand who make you poop in your pants until you die of malnutrition.<br><br>I called it The Final Countdown.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd probably grab Jailhouse Rock, just because it's the stand I personally fear the most by far, and it'd make me feel a lot more comfortable knowing 'I' was the one with control of that stand.<br><br>I'd rather fight Dio 1v1 without a stand of my own (Die.) than face Jailhouse Rock.<br><br>I'd rather die than live the rest of my life with fucking alzheimers.</br></br></br></br></br>  My stand would be called anal cunt. He would show up, shut on the ground, call me gay, then leave  <br>as someone who works with alzheimers patients for research, after all i've seen, if I developed it later on in life I would most likely off myself, because we are not gunna have a cure by the time I'm 60-70</br>  <br>So the spirit and stand of /a/?</br>  <br>I haven't read through it in a while but watching the anime recently It looked like SP did the killing punch on the same spot on The world as where Dio had his legs fucked up moments before. I was assuming it was Dios arrogant personality attacking with his injured body that got him killed.</br>  <br>Yaaaaooooooo, I volunteered at a nursing home for a summer, that's how I learned I'd fucking end my life if I ended up like that too.<br><br>Well, I would if I could even remember that I wanted to die.<br><br>Just gotta make some suicide pacts I guess...<br><br>You know you have a friend when they'll visit you while you're sick. You know you have a best friend when they'll put a bullet in your fucking brain when you won't get better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  you are now imagining all of bizarre adventure being told as a re-cap by some guy with a Brooklyn accent  <br>now listen here u lil shit</br>  So, was Vanilla Ice a true vampire or a zombie? I thought you could only become a vampire via Stone Mask shenanigans, but the people Dio Brando turned into zombies generally looked all grey and weird.  <br>The zombies looked strange and gray, and Vanilla Ice didn't, I mean.</br>  <br><br>It's easy to say this when we have recollection of memory, but as I see it, if you can't remember the horror of the condition, there is no longer any horror to it. Now I don't know how they see it, so my view might be simplistic philosophical bs.</br></br>  <br>Highway Star</br>  <br> once i marry and have children im going to put it in my will </br>  <br><br>it's been a while since I saw the fight but I don't remember vanilla ice regenerating at all during the fight so he might as well have been a zombie right? I get what you mean about the look but I don't think we have enough references other than the abomination zombies to say what they had to look like.</br></br>  <br> If you could choose your own stand what would it be? <br><br>A gay one.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why the condition creeps me out so much on a deep existential level.<br><br><br> Good idea, I'll do the same. Fuck that noise. </br></br></br></br>  <br>done</br>  Floral Shoppe<br><br>Power E<br>Precision D<br>Speed C<br>Range C<br>Durability C<br>Potential B<br><br>The stand itself manifests itself as a pink fog that can quickly surround objects.<br><br>Objects covered in the gas cannot exert a presence on anything outside its range. For example, covering a police car in the fog means that people won't be able to see or hear it or the noise the sirens make and a person walking into the fog will simply pass the car and end up on the other side.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And breaking your body down to follow raindrops, like he did by sending his jaw down with a drop and biting Johnny's shoulder IIRC.</br>  "Teen Spirit"<br><br>My stand would have a ghost like physical appearance and my powers only work on people the ages of 13-19. My "teen spirit" stand has the ability to poses any teenagers body and take over full control of their consciousness.<br><br> I will only use this stand to do lewd stuff with teenage girls. This stand will most likely not be suitable for combat situations unless I'm fighting another stand user who is in the teenage age bracket and then I could just command them to kill themselves. </br></br></br></br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>As a philosophy  minor  it doesn't scare me within my perspective, however if I do know of my condition and could remember how I can't remember shit then yeah, I'll probably be inclined to do something rash. I might as well put it in my will too, thanks for thought to.</br>  <br>that feels like a stand that would be overpowered if araki put it in the series.</br>  <br>Should be called Smells like Teen Spirit.  The aftereffect of the stand is that if used for too long the teenager has an increase in suicidal thought, so if used for stuff like interrogation you'd have to time it wisely and not over use it. Also since it is "teen spirit" maybe if said teenager has a stand you can make use of their stand as well </br>  <br>Lol, Philosophy. What a waste of college money, why don't you get a real degree like  Sociology with a minor in Anthropology, for the love of God end my life plz. </br>  <br> I'm majoring in Anthropology mate, I just plan on doing med school after </br>  <br>In my country you can apply for self-termination. Just fill in the paperwork and pick out a date and a doctor will be dispatched to your location with a syringe.<br>No need to wait for a slow, agonizing death. Time is money wasted.</br></br>  I was re-watching a few episodes of stardust crusaders and for all the crap ive heard about part 3 no one ever talks about the 4th wall being broken during wheel of fortune. <br>this scene made me laugh so hard. too bad this is probably the only instance of it in part 3 or any other part.</br>  <br>If you can choose then why not choose the most broken Stand?</br>  <br>That isn't Heaven's Door or Hey Ya.</br>  <br>I don't know anon, Gold exerience requiem is pretty bullshit. I mean I know the translation for part 5 is ass, but from what I could tell it basically negated king crimsons power and said "fuck you" over and over again.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool dude. I thought about going into forensic anthropology so I could be a fucking coroner (People keep telling me that's creepy as fuck, but I just remember being fascinated when I dissected shit back in the day.), but I'm starting to think I'll just do some social work and then go into law later.<br><br>That, or maybe join the army as an officer and try to get a civil affairs position where I can oversee our relations with some foreign country somewhere. I got a 97 on my ASVAB (A 96 is required.), so that means I can definitely do it.<br><br>I wanna hold off on making those decisions until later on though, for now I'm happy being a broke college student fucking around on the internet.</br></br></br></br></br>  Expectations for EoH? After seeing N'Doul play out, I'm hoping for more gimmicky characters like Mountain Tim.  <br>fuck man N'doul is gonna b everyones partner come full game hes just the best support</br>  C-moon. <br>It would be cool to be able to float around and if I feel like it I could go to Florida and reset the universe in whatever way I want.</br>  <br> Time in a bottle <br><br>The ability to reverse time by 30 seconds with only its effects being known to the user. I would only use it for gambling (Roulette/Craps) and wouldn't bother doing stand fights or anything badass. Just doing some gambling to make enough money to live the way that I want to.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just a stronger Mandom.</br>  <br> I want Ringo Roadagain's stand Mandom except better in every way. <br>There's gotta be a downside Anon, like you have to age a month every time you do it, and it makes your hair and fingernails grow a month too.</br></br>  Pet shop's stand.  <br>me too dude</br>  <br>That's actually a pretty crappy stand, not gonna lie.<br><br>Iggy managed to beat it, and his stand was probably worse than Hermit Purple.</br></br></br>  King Crimsom would be the best for trolling.  <br>  worse than Hermit Purple <br><br>It can create sand clones, help you glide, etc.</br></br></br>  Probably a stand capable of physical recomposing or rearrangement like Sticky Fingers, Soft Machine, or Metallica. <br><br>Part V the bes.</br></br>  I'd like to have Metallica to fuck people up big time.  <br> worse that purple hermit  <br>Negroe please.</br></br>  Mandom.<br><br>Because fuck you</br></br>  <br>Hermit Purple's not great in Stand terms, but it's probably the best Stand a Ripple user could ask for. An extendable Ripple conduit that can bind enemies, pull you around like a grappling hook for mobility, wrap around you like armor for defense, and can even find your enemies for you or create maps.</br>  <br>this is why joseph had it.</br>  I want D4C so I can have anal myself.   mandom <br><br> the world <br><br> king crimson <br><br>any one of those will do, really</br></br></br></br></br></br>  No wait, Chocolate Disco. Super useful.  <br> can have </br>  <br><br>Once DIO is gone Joseph's stand gives him nigh omniscience as long as he looks in the right places. Plus it has long range and he can channel a ripple through it.<br><br>Iggy can float around and make sand bullshit. Sure he might be able to beat Joseph up, but it's only just slightly better at actually fighting.<br><br>Saying Iggy's is better because it's slightly better in a fight is like saying a spider is slightly stronger than an ant.<br><br>Not exactly a selling point, and Joseph's is still crazy better outside of combat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any time based Stand would be great</br>  The Ensemble of Shadows.<br><br>A stand similar to Star Platinum but made out of fog emanating a dark aura that automatically rots everything it touches or takes out the evil in one´s heart if they breath the air it rots.<br>Can also be used as a protective barrier and can solidify itself to fight or lift heavy things if needed but not as physically strong or fast as Star Platinum.</br></br></br>  <br>That stand is nothing like Star Platinum.<br><br>Why did you even mention Star Platinum? It served no purpose in describing your stand.<br><br>Also that stand sounds extremely edgy in that special "bad guy from kingdom hearts" kind of way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so all it can really do is lift things thats fucken gay</br>  <br>That stand is gayer than gay priest.</br>  <br>I meant like Star Platinum in the sense it has a form and literally stands behind me and that also has short range. Something like that.<br><br>And it´s more based in that bitch from Medaka Box that could rot everything she touches</br></br></br>  <br>Same for me, definitely Heaven's Door. It might not seem like the most powerful compared to ridiculous stands like The World, and King Crimson. But being able to write in rules would be the best.</br>  Alright, if I had a shitty fanfiction stand:<br> Revolution <br>Stand itself is short range punch ghost with 4 arms that spin around it.<br><br>Whatever it touches will revolve around on an orbit (Or simply rotate in place), the trajectory and speed of which is decided by how hard the stand slaps it.<br><br>The objects will revolve around me as if I were the 'sun' in a galaxy.<br><br>The orbit may be elliptical or whatever.<br><br>Not exactly great, but the stand itself would make for a pretty good asskicker and the ability itself does have some creative applications (I can make the wheels of my car spin without needing gas.) and at the very least it can be used to fling shit at people.<br><br> Revolution Number 9 <br>The evolved form for when I need to fight Diavolo. This form has has the ability to... I don't really know, I can't really think of anything original that's fucking OP without ripping off of C-Moon.<br><br>Obviously something to do with gravity though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Challenge for the thread:<br><br> Take two Stands which share one word of their names (Hermit Purple and Purple Haze, for example) and combine them and their powers into something new, then rename them. <br><br>That's it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like it. And there are a lot if gravity based stands anyway. C-moon just has most of their basic powers.</br>  <br>Highway Star Platinum<br><br>It's a remote Star Platinum that moves at 60km/h and kicks well<br> Am I doing this right? </br></br></br></br>  <br>C-Snake<br>Can steal the gravity from a object In the shape of a disc add that gravity to something else by inserting the disc.</br></br>  <br>Mine would be this:<br><br> 「Crazy La Paint」 <br><br>Power: B<br>Speed: B<br>Range: C<br>Staying: D<br>Precision: A<br>Potential: B<br><br>「Crazy La Paint」 appears as a vaguely humanoid entity, only just fitting the bill due to standing upright most of the time, though its build suggests that this would not be a natural pose in a real creature. Further de-anthropomorphising it is the fact that its entire body is composed of specific musical instruments - each limb is represented by an old-fashioned accordion, whilst its body, shoulders, and limb extremities are all composed of drums of various types, with the two shoulder pads also possessing piston-like devices that beat the two drums sequentially in a steady pattern; its fingers are flexible keys from a xylophone- or glockenspiel-like instrument, and its head is essentially a miniature pipe organ, like a scaled-down version of something one would see in a church moulded to form around the drum body, with the holes in the pipes acting as eyes.<br><br>「Crazy La Paint」 possesses the ability to induce "spin" in a target, represented by one of its limbs winding itself into a spiral for as long as needed, with stronger spin needing more wind-up time, then hitting a target to release that twisting into the target. Said spin can be utilised on both physical targets, either twisting the target's form up to and past the point at which the target breaks from the torsion or physically forcing them to start spinning round in a given plane of rotation at speed proportionate to wind-up, and on abstract or otherwise nonsensical concepts, for instance "twisting" a target's words to sound more convincing or "spinning" a literal web out of thin air as a spider would. Naturally, this has a lot of significant uses, but being made of constantly-sounding instruments makes stealth with this Stand totally impossible unless it is desummoned completely, which may hinder the user to a significant extent in many situations for one reason or another.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Shiieet I'm just beginning SBR, sorry I'm a hack guys.</br></br></br>  <br> Highway Star and Highway to Hell <br><br>This is an automatic stand that activates when the user dies. The stand pursues the target any distance in an attempt to kill the target in the same manner that the stand user died in. In doing so the user comes back to life if done within 24 hours. <br><br>Name? Sympathy for the Devil.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes<br><br>Close, but no Cigar.</br></br></br>  <br>Love it<br><br>I would have gone with C-Moon and Dark Blue Moon if I'm honest.</br></br></br>  <br> dark blue moon and C-moon <br>Basically a nerfed C-moon</br></br>  <br> Heirophant Green and Green Green Grass Of Home <br><br>This Stand is capable of unfurling itself into Tendrils that subject those pieced by them to Xenos paradox the further into the body the tendril penetrates. Its name is Savage Garden.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Shifty Stunts for Scant Shekels</br></br>  <br>So combing Dark Blue Moon with either C-Moon or Moody Blues nerfs the latter two horribly.</br>  <br>Stealing that for a JoJo RPG I'm running. Gonna be quite the shock for the players when this seemingly ordinary guy challenges them and actively tries to get himself killed by them.</br>  <br> Boy II Man and Mandom <br>Standard Boy II Man RPS game except instead of stealing power the winner takes time (life) from the loser. Maybe a week of their life or more and there is no limit to how many games it can play.<br>As for a name, 「I'D DIE FOR YOU」</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit that'd be a cool villain Stand.</br>  <br>The Lock+Jail House Lock would be terrifying though, wouldn't it?</br>  <br>sounds cool</br>  <br> Red Hot Magician <br>I'm fucking Cole Macgrath that has Storm Spirit for a stand. How fucking awesome is that?</br></br>  <br>Bretty rad</br>  <br> Green grass of home and green day. <br>A green and black humanoid stand with long black hair. The closer a living thing gets mold when begin to grow on their bodies and will rot them away until they distance themselves.<br>When punched by the stand they will be instantly reduced to nothing <br> Beautiful World </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck..how would work.</br>  <br>Yeah go for it, the way I wrote it the user didn't necessarily have to be killed by the target but the closer they are the faster the stand would be able to pursue since it's on a clock. I imagined the user getting run over by a car then having the stand attempt to kill the target in a similar fashion.</br>  <br> Dirt Cheap Trick <br><br>Cheap Trick but with D4C dimension hopping.</br></br></br>  My stand would be one that manipulates time and simply removes moments of when my opponent or me did something, removing my mistakes or getting rid of my enemy's correct judgement. It will also be able to put scenarios that have made up in certain time slots in the past or future...Is tht too OP?  <br>*That I have made up</br>  My stand would be Crawling Skin. <br><br>Its would be some sort of horrible wormlike creature that burrowed underneath the flesh of its victims and drove them to screaming insanity.</br></br>  <br>Bloody hell<br> Cream and Cream Starter <br>Piranha manifests as a Spray can with what appears to be swimming fish on the sides, when the nozzle is squeezed it releases a stream of bruise-colored flesh-foam that will move to the largest piece of Organic material and begin consuming it and growing larger, Typically this flesh-foam will cling to surfaces without moving, but it can form its mass into limbs to pull consumables in.</br></br></br>  <br>You start having a Guilt Trip and can't remember why, which makes you guilty, you can see the end of this path, can't you?</br>  <br>There's no coming back from that. That's terrifying.</br>  <br>"tap that"<br><br>I get to read the mind of anyone I touch.</br></br></br>  <br>You have good taste. Crazy Diamond is easily the best Stand.</br>  <br>It's my favorite as far as design goes. It's a nice straight forward stand that takes some cleverness to master. Like I said I think it'd work well with how I am.</br>  <br>Hell, it's worse than the fusion of Lovers and Love Deluxe I came up with. And that is Strands of hair that detach from their users body, burrow into someone and replicate along their nervous system, and take control of them by firing off all of their pain receptors at once if they don't listen to the User.<br><br>Jojolion gave use a hell of a lot of combos for KC, didn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>Underhanded Undertakings for Unsatisfactory Wages</br>  <br>Shame train<br><br>The closer someone gets to me the fatter, uglier and bald(er) he gets.

Variation of Combat Merging. User is able to fight at incredible speed, striking their opponent in rapid succession that may even kill opponents instantly.

If the speed is fast enough, it can distort space to bypass defenses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  I think my stand would be something like this.<br> Eyes Without A Face <br>It has the ability to read a person´s mind and see what they´re seeing, If a person is not paying attention to what they´re thinking I can implant thoughts and suggestions.

Maybe its user could try to bait people by laying the jewelry in the middle of the street and curse them for being greedy bastards and picking it up.<br><br>The bad luck could be minor with just one piece, but the stand itself can attach more through physical contact to increase the bad luck effect.

Alright.<br><br>"Crystal Japan": can make diamonds on victim's skin that hurt on contact, allowing to prevent it running away or getting closer by covering feet. Can also cover with diamonds its user to shield from an attack, but that would also hurt him in the process. Another possible use is to grow diamonds on user's arm to use as melee weapon.  Maybe for evolution can grow diamonds on the inside and kill, but that's OP. <br><br>"Ashes to ashes": a physical revolver, bullets from which teleport the user to the place where the bullet stopped. The bullets themselves aren't physical, and disappear upon the teleportation. Not much by itself, but can lead to interesting scenarios.<br> investigation of possibly stand-related locked room murders with strange wall destructions or extremely gory bodies without a fitting murder weapon <br> when retrieved from a user and shot at him missing/wounding him teleports from a fight <br> user can confuse the pursuers by firing several bullets in different directions (teleporting to each stopped bullet, eventually to the last one) <br> if bullet stuck in a body victim has to immediately move and try to remove the bullet without stopping or else teleport kill <br> can get on some glider, shoot straight above and fuck off far away if held out from attackers enough for bullet to stop mid-air </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You think instead of making it blow up, EoH will have the road roller stay on the stage after DIO uses it?  <br>people would start murdering real quick if we had stands</br>  <br>Killer Queen is kawaii and Kira was my favorite villian so KQ.</br>  <br>What if you encounter a person who is ashamed of his own power?</br>  The Sun, because it is a fucking giant fireball. You would never overcome this.  Rite Where You Stand  Reference to Gang Starr <br>The user has to stay still but when they do their stand emerges from below the enemy and is similar to the hands in Morioh, so just a shit ton of hands reaching for the enemy. The more stands you defeat, not necessarily kill, you get another set of hands</br>  <br>1 trillion lions can</br>  Alright, how much do you guys think the blu-ray releases will fix DIOs world? the last episode was great, but there was a lot of terrible animation especially after the knife throwing part and the cab.<br><br>Looking back at it I'm really dissapointed it looked so shitty at times, I really wanted this part to look fucking amazing.

I really do hope shit is fixed in the blu-rays.</br></br>  <br>How often do they try to impress you with their knowledge of memes?</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br>Specials is probably the coolest stand in that game on top of being pretty good gameplay-wise.<br><br>Nothing like snarky secret agent bodyguards backing you up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This.

The only actions the combined pair can take are those both people agree on. (There's no telepathic connection so you have to guess or precommit to doing something the other person would do, like the ultimate Prisoner's Dilemma)<br><br>The user can also combine himself with someone else but loses the ability to use the stand until he goes back to normal, not sure if this would make it too OP already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Star Platinum with higher range <br>NO WEAKNESSES</br></br>  <br>Tfw you'll die lonely or with a landwhale by your side</br>   threads die whenever I post in them   <br><br>I'd pick something from the following: Harvest, The World, Silver Chariot, Emperor Diamond is Unbreakable, The Hand, Heaven's Door, Cream or King Crimson.<br><br>Realistically I'd go for Harvest or The World, Harvest has a lot of benefits but then again if I had The World I'd just use it to work on my many backlogs.<br><br>If you had The World how would you use it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By freezing time however the fuck I wanted?

But Star Platinum is a better punch ghost, with stronger and more precise swings. <br><br>At the time of the fight SP was probably stronger (a couple of seconds timestop is plenty + better punching), but The World has better overall utility because more timestop. However because The World has potentially infinite timestop, given time DIO would be completely unstoppable. Part 6 Jotaro is probably Star Platinum at its strongest, with a full five seconds Time Stop and without the dip in Durability that he suffered from going a bit soft in Part 4.</br></br></br>  <br>Whitesnake.<br>He could be my stand and  my only friend .</br></br>  <br>Bretty much<br><br> White Album Of The Snake <br>Generates a Suit of armor composed of Frozen Air, that has all the properties of White Snake, with the added bonus that it can insert Stand Discs into itself and turn them into weapons.</br></br></br></br>  I'll take hermit purple because  no one else will  I can also make random people trip for no reason which can be fun for a few days + spider man.

D4C would be my ideal stand can go into any dimension and interact with no consequences really and save me from danger if need be. Love the design too and he can still punch.

Did no one read the manga? The dude's twin brother got hanged by the KKK for being black and kissing a white girl in the South. (Even tho Weather passes for white easily.) Of course the dude is black, a fucking degenerate shitbag southerner able to figure out that Weather was black with a little research. How would Weather's much darker twin brother not be black?  <br>NOBODY PANIC!</br>  Is the translation out?  <br>Read the FUCKING manga<br><br>Weather and Enrico Pucci are twins from the Pucci family, which has two white parents. But at the time of weather's lynching, only Pucci knew that they were twins. They KKK thought that Weather's parents were the woman that swiped Weather at birth and her black husband. Weather doesn't actually have any black genes.</br></br></br>  <br>They just got the raws today.</br>  <br><br> This, but also his family is explicitly Italian. He most likely has a dark-skinned Sicilian grandparent or something.  Which isn't much different from black but it's not the American idea of black. </br></br>  <br>GOLD EXPERIENCE  REQUIEM </br>  <br>Eh, damn.</br>   You see, Jotaro, it's simply useless. <br> Actually let me say it in a way you can understand me better... <br> MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA </br></br>  Remember that Pocco kid from part 1?<br><br>Jonathan could've saved the world from Pucci by killing or not saving him from zombies, which would prevent Pucci's birth due to Pocco being his ancestor.<br><br>Jonathan biggest fuck up  but still manly .</br></br></br></br>  Bad Company, for shenanigans.  <br> which would prevent Pucci's birth due to Pocco being his ancestor. <br>You made this up didn't you.</br></br>  <br> Pocco being his ancestor <br>u fukn wθt</br></br>  <br><br>He is black and had a whiter sister.<br>Deepest lore, gotta accept it.<br><br> Just an idea that came to my head before i fell asleep today, of course i made that up since the beginning. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Neat.<br><br>Stand Name: Streamline<br><br>Stand Ability: [Psychic Force-Field Generation](http://powerlisting.wik<wbr>ia.com/wiki/Psychic_Force-Field_Gen<wbr>eration)<br><br>Power - B<br><br>Speed - D<br><br>Range - C<br><br>Durability - D<br><br>Precision - E<br><br>Potential - C<br><br>Description: The power to generate force-fields of psychic energy.

They'll get bored. Just remember to always post lolis and loli threads.  <br>It's been like this all year, don't kid yourself</br>  <br> /a/ is dead <br>I wish.</br></br>  <br> summer <br><br>You're new? This Naruto garbage on /a/ has been going since last year with the manga ending.</br></br></br>  <br>And for that reason they'll eventually go away. It's not the first time Naruto in particular has invaded this board but it will likely be the last</br>  <br> but it will likely be the last <br>just like dragonball, amirite?</br></br>  <br>Naruto has never invaded the board for most of a year before.</br>    <br> Naruto feet </br>  Don't lie yourself, cunts.  Im literally on suicide watch.  Dragon ball is just as bad and no one complains, you're just a bunch of nostalgia wankers  I'd rather have 2 Naruto threads than 6 Fat threads  Because it's impossible to ignore threads about anime you don't like  <br> 6 Fat thread <br>what?</br></br>  <br>Where you been for over a year now? This shit ain't nothing new.</br>  check em  <br>Naruto's haters have always been massively worse than actual Narutards.<br><br> purposefully shit up the catalog with trash threads (e.g. this one) <br> the usual trash inside of actual Naruto threads <br><br>Note that despite irritating people like me who don't give a fuck, and despite distracting jans and mods from the rest of the nonsense that goes on all the time, Naruto is still discussed here. The key word here is impotence: anti-Narutards are flatly unable to stop Naruto discussion. They make things worse rather than better, out of selfishness and sheer delusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok</br>  I hate all normalfags and think they have no place on /a/. I'm not an /r9k/ tier autist but fucking hell, I hate hearing people talk about their lives or their "hurr my gf recommended this"<br>Literally nobody gives a shit about your fucking life. 4chan is not your blog.<br>I hate generals, and I wish everyone who participates in them would get banned<br>I hate crossboarders, especially /soc/, /b/, /pol/ and /v/<br>I hate JoJo faggots, they're by far the most obnoxious people we have here<br>I hate that Naruto is allowed now and nobody seems to even be against it anymore<br>I hate spoonfeeders and wish they would be permanently banned<br>But most of all I hate how posters are becoming less elitist and more friendly to the normalfag masses. You can tell a lot of people who post here don't belong here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least the narutards have the decency to title their threads so I can filter them all out. Can't say the same for Yaharifags or Fatefags.<br>Also meta threads aren't allowed. saged and reported.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128485236 <br>You are obviously here mods or jani-kun.<br><br>So why are these Narutards threads not being deleted? You said it yourself that they are only allowed if they have new materials and right now they dont.<br><br>They already discussed that ''new materials'' yesterday.</br></br></br></br></br>  Which anime/manga have the best foot service, in your opinion?<br><br>Pic related</br></br>  <br>Perowan, probably. Also, I must commend you. This is the proper way to start one of these threads, OP, by providing an anime/manga-related discussion prompt. Anyone else wishing to start a thread like this, take note.</br>  Barefoot Gen  Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko  Probably a Shaft show. <br><br>They have some real foot fags on staff.</br></br>  When will the mods take a hint and give you shit eating subhumans your own fucking containment board?  Oy vey, this thread is automatically the greatest thread on /a/. I have to tell all my Deviantart friends about this thread!  Which anime/manga have the best room service, in your opinion?    <br>When will the mods take a hint and ban all fetish threads from /a/</br>  <br><br>When Troid gets kicked off of /a/ and we get a decent mod in her place.</br></br>  <br>So never?</br>  No mentions to Nisemonogatari?  <br/>  I haven't even watched it all but the gatari series looks great for it.<br><br>Kyoani are slowly becoming foot fags.</br></br>  <br>Now the thread is objectively irredeemable trash.</br>  <br>No it isn't aside from a very few scenes.<br><br>And how comes you are on /a/ for so long and haven't watched it yet you filthy peasant?</br></br></br>  <br>I remember that Zettai Shounen had an inordinate amount of feet shots, to the point that people thought the director had a foot fetish.</br>    <br> tfw foot licking happens never in anime <br> sometimes it's hinted at but censored </br></br>   When a Gun Nerd is Reincarnated to a World of Magic, He established a Harem army with Modern Weapons!?   <br>Is he a super special snowflake or only good because of his wits?</br>  <br>He was born with magic potential and he trained it like crazy so he is super strong in that way but fighting strength really isn't that important to the overall story.</br>  <br>Nah, not enough Light novel volumes yet. I don't think so, anyways.</br>  Why are all these LN protags pretty boy fags?  <br>I would probably read it.</br>       <br>How is chiho a loli.</br>  <br>I wish she was part of the harem ;_;<br><br>or maybe I haven't read far enough in the light novels</br></br></br>  <br>Dub was better than expected.</br>  <br>She used magic in that world. Without it she's just an angry teenage girl.   Also she just wanted the d(emon). </br>  Emi is for tender loving.<br>Chiho is for hardcore raping.<br>Suzuno is for ignoring.</br></br>  Who's got the better design out of the whole cast?  <br>Nobody would are for the sales of S2, Getting an S2 is enough itself.</br>  <br>FUCK OFF TRIPSHIT HAAA<br> would are for the sales of </br></br>  <br>no she isn't</br>  <br>You're grossly overestimating the numbers and the importance of people who strongly demand a KumikoxReina canon end.<br><br>MizorexNozori would make most yuri fans forget about KumikoxReina anyways.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Has an artist ever received this much attention in these threads before? what makes her so special?</br></br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128430<wbr>156/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, I just didn't get why you felt the need to comment this in response to some chaika trollface that was obviously only meant as a joke.<br><br><br>You should use Tae Kim to refresh your memory about the various grammar points you'll encounter in Genki. Considering Genki will teach you things at a very slow pace there is no need to systematically read Tae Kim at the same time.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>(me again) I'd like to add that there isn't anything wrong reading both as long as you have the time and motivation to do so. In my opinion, although they will cover the same things, the explanations will hold different nuances, and none of them in the end will strictly be better than the other. I hope you follow me what I'm saying. (On the other hand don't get stuck reading beginner materials for too long, that would be the biggest mistake you could do.)<br><br>In the same vein, you can also check out Japanese the Manga Way, which is available in the OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hourou Musuko.</br>  <br> TK <br> beginner material </br></br>  <br>Yes, TK is beginner material.</br></blockquote>]
