[ Bros before Hos  <br>Last Thread Shuukan Shounen<br/></br>                          Is this that retarded cocoon one?    <br>It's been a long time since I've read this, it has a retarded ending  with cocoons  doesn't it?</br>  <br><br>I think so. although maybe you're talking about that other genderbender cocoom shit.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah it's been a while for me but I don't remember the cocoon scene being that stupid.</br></br>  did they fucked          <br><br>What the fuck, don't tell me they don't end up in a slight femdom relationship? What's the point of a guy turning into a girl and going full sub pussy? Like, it's interesting turning into a cum loving pussy if the guy still has his male body. Now is this just a normal shoujo?</br></br>      <br><br>Normal shoujo don't typically have a male as an MC, honestly.</br></br>    <br>nothing intense or detailed</br>      <br>Yes they do, they don't even have to have female characters. There's non-homo male SOL that are shoujo, they just don't become as popular or iconic as the het feMC romances.<br><br>So does the bitchboy become full typical girl?</br></br></br>    <br> saw your browser history on PC <br>not cool</br></br>  <br><br>But you said "Normal" shoujo or typical ones and the most shoujo normally have female MCs. Of course those you're talking about, as you said, aren't normal or what most people would think of when they think of shoujo.<br><br> typical girl <br>Feelings and the way people act aren't restricted to their gender.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Gonna go out to buy dinner.</br>  <br> Feelings and the way people act aren't restricted to their gender. <br>I know, I meant as in becoming the prevalent shoujo manga heroine going dokidoki for some asswad guy. Anyway, I can already see how pussy the bitchboy becomes in just the first chapter, so even though the characters seem sweet I won't pick it up, but thanks for posting.</br></br>  <br> being ignored by you was the worst <br>what a gay</br></br>                                              <br> Bros before Hos <br>His bro became a ho.<br>If he fucks him, both are gay.</br></br></br>             Genderswap <br> They really fucked <br><br>That's so gay</br></br></br>    <br>I hated the spinoff. A guy is in love with girl but he turns into a girl himself and now he seems to start falling in love with another guy while he/she's desperately trying to remain in love with the girl. The idea that something or someone can fuck you up so much really pissess me off.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with fucking your bro if he's a girl.<br><br>Although, I'm starting to see why there's such a fine line between liking traps and being full blown gay.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Well, at least that means I won't have to dump that one if it's like that.</br></br>                        <br>I agree, I don't really have anything against gay subhumans, but genderswap always makes me feel weird when reading it, as if it's just a way to tell a gay story without being "faggy" or whatever.<br>Can't even fap to genderswap or bodyswap hentai because it's just gay, at least in my mind.<br> But I did like prunus girl. </br></br></br>  <br><br>I hate gender bending. Tell me why this is worth reading?</br></br>    <br> I hate gender bending <br><br>Leave right now for your own good</br></br></br>    <br>Why?</br>    OK /a/. Your best friend is now a really pretty bona fide girl. What do you do?<br><br>How well do you get along now with your friends and how well do you think you'd get along with them if things get more intimate?</br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't call this gender bender. Honestly, if the chick was always chick but MC was immune to her because she was a tomboy there wouldn't be too much of a difference anyways.</br></br>  <br>I'd rape him.</br>    <br> friends </br>  <br>I guarantee we'd fuck pretty much within the first week. We have pretty similar personalities so I'm pretty sure if the whole issue of neither of us being a gender we're attracted to was gone there'd be nothing left to stop us from going out.<br><br> Though I wouldn't ignore the possibility that if it were me who turned into a girl that I would stick with just one partner .<br><br><br>I feel like this story would be much more engaging if there was a bit more depth to it, but I suppose not every gender bender story has to be Balance Policy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>He's pretty much like the chick here. Dunnow if we'd fuck but we'd definitely be life partners in some way.I wouldn't mind introducing him, now her, to someone I trust.</br></br>  <br>As for me, It'll be awkward as fuck at first and he/she will be against it. <br><br>Well, until those chromosomes start taking effect and then anything goes. Always used to think of a friend being a female partner back in primary school hypothetically. Weird as fuck man,</br></br></br>  <br> Could it be that I like that girl? <br>I know she used to be a guy until pretty recently, but that's an extremely dense statement to make.<br><br>At least it'll make her eventual realization that much  sweeter .<br><br><br> Or... <br>Oh, good. It'll happen quicker than expected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whoa, that's some seriously bad bullying he went through.</br>  <br>This better not end with Mamiya becoming a member of the Hand of God.</br>  <br><br>My favorite Gender Bender manga, Gacha Gacha Secret, doesn't have depth but I like to for some reason. i know it's not objectively anything special but I really do like it.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you with your blogshit</br>      <br>The dude isn't an ass, so I wouldn't say that it fall under that category.<br><br><br>A boy having sex with a girl isn't gay.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>DROPPED.</br></br>    This is actually more gay than gay porn  <br>I think that sort of thing makes sense. One can't consciously control who they are attracted to after all and if a character in that situation ended up with a heterosexual female brain to go along with their female body then it would make sense for them to start liking dudes, since brain structure is what determines who you are attracted to.<br><br><br>I didn't like Gacha Gacha Secret. It ended up as a story about an unpopular dude in love triangle with two beautiful girls and just kept dragging on and meandering without really leading up to anything. And I found the ending both stupid and abrupt. The final story arc came completely out of nowhere (the author really ought to have thrown hints before since what he wrote was a pretty transparent attempt to inject drama without building on anything), was resolved in a really stupid deus ex machina manner and had no effect in the plot either (the characters went back at exactly the same state they were before it happened so all the forced drama it was entirely pointless).</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>As I said, it's not really good but I like it as it's pretty comfy for me. The guy actually slowly starts getting to the girl. The progress is slow but it is there and it's not an immediate turn. From stranger, to friend, to close friend, to crush.<br><br>I liked the nice chill pace. You don't go into that sort of thing looking for story anyways. It's very chill.<br><br>It wasn't really a love traingle. While I don't really like how they made the little sister like the MC immediately, their interactions are still pretty comfy.<br><br>The ending was an obvious axe ending though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Be back in a bit.</br>  <br>Decided to read Gacha Gacha Secret in the mean time; I can see what you mean about it being comfy. I like the idea of a male character warming up to the object of his affection (or lust, in this case) and learn about how it might feel to be a girl firsthand.</br>  <br>To me it felt like the story wasn't building up to anything. I found it rather similar to Pretty Face in that regard, which I think also lost its sense of direction and meandered until its editor pulled the plug.<br><br>And I do think it was a love triangle. The MC had two girls interested in him and didn't pick one. I also didin't like the fact that in the end the situation was abruptly resolved for him. And the way the manga was axed shows that the manga had no real end goal, since the status quo remained the pretty much same as it had been during the series.</br></br></br>   ITT <br>Another weirdo shit shoujo</br>  <br>Kingdom threads are dead for a reason, now go away.</br>    Oh boy, I fucking love this one, OP! Hopefully you get some people to pick it up!  <br><br>This never really had any direction though. It jsut kept moving and there was nothing wrong with that. Most manga like that end up having dissatisfying endings as they always inject drama in the end out of nowhere anyways.<br><br>I only would consider it a love triangle if both of his interactions with the girls actually clashed in a way. He never had one of those "Who should I pick moments". They never really did till the end and that was the same time it was pretty much axed. There are a lot of underutilized points.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's completed though.</br></br>            <br>Kissu time?</br>      that's not cute that's gay    <br>I clearly see an attractive female coming on to her attractive male friend. Nothing gay about it.<br><br>Pic related: just cute girls doing cute things.</br></br></br>  <br>THERE IS ONLY CUTE AND NOT CUTE THERE IS NO GAY.</br>  <br>YOU ARE PROOF THERE'S PLENTY OF GAY</br>  <br>To be fair, there is gay in that image, since the blonde twintailed girl is a lesbian. The other two girls are straight though.</br>  <br>nonsense, if it wasn't gay OP wouldn't stop posting<br>fuck damn it why did he stop?</br></br>  <br>OP will come again! Just keep the faith.</br>  <br>God this net is so shit.</br>  <br> Captcha images pop-up doesn't show when using reply box <br>Hrmmm.</br></br>  <br> mutually exclusive </br>  <br>Why does it work on the one in the top but not the reply box? Weird.</br>    <br> history shaming <br>bruh</br></br>        <br>It's only gay if the balls touch<br>And one of them doesn't even have them</br></br>    <br>Oh dang OP,<br>I thought you gonna post the new chapter for Kanojo ni Naru Hi Another.</br></br>    <br>The cocoon thing is stupid as fuck because it's fixed in a few pages. Why introduce something like that if you're gonna fix it so soon?</br>  <br>Thank God this didn't happen, it would have been retarded tsundere x abusive guy bullshit for the whole story</br>            <br>I'd be creeped out as fuck, but in the end I think I'll still be his friend and accept his change. Kind of like Erika from Catherine, but I wouldn't stick muh dick in that still.</br>            <br><br>Reading ahead, the manga doesn't end  with the cocoon thing and their confirmation of their feelings , does it? There's 12 chapters scanlated and it seems like your standard fare for  couples  afterwards, with the exception/justification of Mamiya still getting used to being a girl and/or Miyoshi accepting it. Nice to see the story continues but it doesn't feel particularly interesting compared to other stories once they overcome the main hurdle in their relationship.</br></br>      <br>Yes, it continues, which makes the cocoon thing even more pointless. It's like in a manga the MC discovers that he has cancer and then it's fixed in the next page. Why bother giving him cancer in the first place if you're gonna fix it that quick?</br>    I fucking love this shit. Thanks for sharing OP.    <br>The cocoon represented him accepting himself as a woman and becoming a couple. It was not pointless</br>      <br>Then make him accept that normally and not "I'm in a coocon five years, now I'm fully a girl". It was just stupid.</br>    <br>Even for "emergence" and the symbolism of his transformation, it was bizarre. It felt shoehorned when the entire manga was already previously about him coming to terms with his new life as a woman and how it affected his relationship with Miyoshi. If you want imagery, there's better ways to go about it.</br>        <br>Me and my best friend have already answered that question. We would fuck like rabbits. We love each other. No homo of course.</br>            <br>oh fug ;_;</br>        <br>It's not over yet. Mrs. Akane wasn't very optimistic about the series being popular, so she decided to end it there. But people were enjoying themselves too much with it, so the publishers asked for a second part. And then people asked to bring the originals back. So now she is working on two series at the same time.</br>                        <br>"Can his heart change so easily?"<br><br>What. It was his/her slut of a mother who changed easily.</br></br></br>      <br>godammit <br><br>OP please post faster, my heart can't take it<br>also I want to sleep</br></br></br></br>      <br>She dies. That's my guess</br>         stupid cute love shit <br> bros before hos <br> posts stupid gay shit <br>I'm mad.</br></br></br>    <br>bro becomes ho</br>    Is this a shoujou thread pretty much?<br><br>Cause that's a good thing</br></br>      <br>Thanks for posting op</br>              <br>(‘∀’●)</br>    <br> (‘∀’●) <br><br>Fuck off reddit.</br></br></br>      <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Its japanese emoji dude</br>    <br>WHAT THE FUCK</br>  <br> As expected, she entered a cocoon <br>NO, THAT WAS NOT EXPECTED AT ALL</br></br>    <br>What in the fuck</br>  <br>What is this bullshit</br>    <br><br>BRAVO<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The author was so baked making this.<br>10/10 Op thx</br></br></br>  <br>It wasm't that bad.</br>  <br><br>NOLAN<br>O<br>L<br>A<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just joined this thread.<br><br>So is this reason to not pick this series up?<br><br>I mean what the fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>bloody hell the author's art needs to step up</br>  <br> As expected <br>HIT ME WITH THAT GAY SHIT AGAIN I'LL SLAP YOUR FUCKING FACE FUCKBOI</br></br>  <br> if that's the case I wish I had come out earlier <br>wut</br></br>  <br>And that's thatm<br><br>I dunnow where all this accusation that this was gay came from when it wasn't THAT gay. <br><br>Tomorrow Berserk.<br><br>https://mega.nz/#F!LVcCTaJQ!41XeOOf<wbr>uVv2tEvJyMujJHQ!vd8xGCCL</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Berserk <br><br>This is cute how?</br></br></br>  <br><br>aaand it ends with a curve to the curve ball</br></br>  <br>Guts is moe.</br>  Weird end but 7/10 cocoons thanks op  <br>Are there any translations for the two series she's working on now?</br>  <br><br>That was anticlimactic.</br></br>  <br>I bet you wanted actual gay shit</br>  <br>If I'm hot enough to get a qt Kouhai to confess, you can be sure I will date a real girl and not some undicked dude.</br>  <br>Thanks OP, it was a pretty nice read.</br>  <br>There are both being scanlated, yes.</br>  <br>It was gay from the start. Anything would have been better than that fucking cocoon deus ex machina.</br>  i don't know how to feel about this  <br>did you like it?<br>if yes you should feel gay<br>that was pretty gay senpai</br></br></br>  <br>actually yes <br><br>fuck</br></br></br>  <br>Not OP, but that's not the end. It was probably intended to be one, but there's a normal continuation afterwards, not just a little epilogue.</br>  <br>But it's not gay in the end. <br>Or at least I'm trying to think so.</br></br>  Gender bent only works if it is temporary and the couple has to reconcile being same sex  <br>That's gay man.</br>  <br>Nah, get fucked.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  I'm really confused. <br>It's not gay cause one of them is a girl. <br>But it's gay cause he's still a guy.<br>In the end he transformed into woman both mentally and physically.<br>While his boyfriend was ready to fuck him in a dude form,which makes him 100% gay</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the series finished or ongoing?</br>  That wasn't the real end or some shit. He comes out of the cocoon 5 years later, they go to university together, have sex all over the country and her dad punches some dick ass and tells him he'll always love his children no matter how totally gay it is for him to marry her best bro.  <br>It's over. Chapter 12 is a sort of epilogue and 11 is pretty much it.</br>  <br> which makes him 100% gay <br>Nah, it makes him 100% bi.</br></br>  <br>If I believe the scanlator's site, it's still ongoing, but on hiatus till January. I'm really enjoying the second part, hope we'll get some sweet happy  newlywed  life.</br>  <br><br><br>So which is it??!?!?</br></br></br>  <br>Not over.</br>  <br>Well, I'd tend to have more faith in the guys who translate it than in some random anons.<br>http://thecrimson-flower.com/2015/0<wbr>9/17/kanojo-ni-naru-hi-chapter-12/</wbr></br></br>  <br>I know it makes sense, and that's what the most annoying thing about it! Your own brain is screwing you over and you have no control over it! I know I felt furious when I read it originally.</br>  <br>It's a thing many other species in the world have, right now. It's a valid survival mechanism. Only humans care whether or not they were male or female in the first place.</br>  <br>Sequential hermaphroditism<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seque<wbr>ntial_hermaphroditism</wbr></br></br>  <br> muh heterosexual female brain <br>every single time<br>this series actually points out a number of times how the brain itself isn't affected/changed by the whole emerging process other than by the change in hormones<br><br><br><br><br>I really hate how Another tends to go full shoujo drama plus the whole"oh god, he's being nice to me, better start falling in love with him now" crap</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  That was pretty cute, even if it was weird as fuck.  <br><br> best friend is an older milf <br><br>Uh...</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>HAHA OH GOD. I LOST IT.<br><br><br>At first I thought the cocoon thing was a facetious, but it's real. I'm dying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is a bimonthly publication. Don't panic.</br>  <br>I liked this.<br>But the pupa shit ruined it.</br></br>  <br><br> it wasn't that gay <br><br>You're right. It wasn't gay at all. I just need to find some LSD so I can properly assimilate the expectation of cocoon baffoonary.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Per the expected side effect </br>  <br> Per the expected side effect, she entered the cocoon <br><br>every fucking time</br></br></br>  <br>Ok, serious question to you people complaining about the cocoon thing: How do you justify an overnight transformation that does NOT involve magic? I cannot imagine such a severe process of apoptosis and cell migration without it being lengthy and complicated.</br>    <br><br>Don't you dare bring actual biology into this motherfucker. Even from a simple thematic perspective, it's a complete WHAM climax.<br><br>Also, this is SHOUJO. It's inherently more absurd than shounen or seinen.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I read this shit months ago and seeing everyone else's reactions to this is killing my sides. I don't really care about it now cuz it's a cute love story, but looking back the whole "As expected" line is fucking hilarious.</br>  <br>The alternative might have been to show a half-formed human, which would have been pretty disgusting. I can see why the author went with the pupa route. Though it might have been better to just have her covered up with a blanket or something instead.</br>  You guys should read the spinoff, Kinojo ni Nary Hi - Another. It's set in the same universe but focuses on a tomboy who resists her change as much as possible. Makes my heart go doki doki.<br><br>Also the first one is still going too.</br></br>  <br>Same here, I didn't even blink the first time I read it, but now I'm dying.</br>  <br> Nary <br>Naru*</br></br>  <br>I think the people here are overreacting a bit to this whole thing. This stuff is much less out of the left field that the stuff we saw 2 days ago in Shuukan Shounen. And yet people are overreacting (and were spoiling) so much today.<br><br>Although I guess the selfcest cockblocking cat did cause a shitstorm too.</br></br></br>  <br> .stupidly cute love shit <br> Berserk <br>Unless you somehow classify Chicchi's part as romance, I don't see how this is going to work.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really the "as expected" shit that got most of us. Like the author just thinks this is the natural next step and we should have been prepared.</br>  <br>you don't want to touch and kiss your friends too?</br>  <br>Thanks OP. <br><br>Also mildly related to the thread, but does anyone know the name of that one manga with the little rich girl who can't resist trying things? (Things like flipping tables at social gatherings and swearing on television) She had a butler that always intervened to save her image and a friend that thinks said butler is gay. It was adorable and I cannot find it anymore.<br>Anyway, I think it would fit these threads nicely if you can find it.</br></br></br></br>  Are they brother and sister?  <br>you talking about domino kick?</br>  <br>What happened with it? Haven't seen a translation for a while.</br>  <br>Yeah that's it, thank you! I've been trying to remember the name for ages. It's stupidly cute, so I figured someone here would know it.</br>  <br><br><br>It got more chapters.<br><br>http://thecrimson-flower.com/catego<wbr>ry/kanojo-ni-naru-hi/<br><br><br><br>Love stories tend to shoehorn in a timeskip as the "final boss" before the couple can get together at the end. I don't know why, but it's common as fuck. There's probably a TVtropes page on it somewhere.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That sounds like Kaichou wa Maid-sama to me.</br>  Neat thing about Kanojo ni Naru hi Another is one extra chapter where you find out Nao becomes a counselor/psychologist for people that emerged.<br><br>Anyway, I need to ask you /a/. If your best friend turns into a bona fide pretty girl, what would you do?</br></br>  <br>Ignore that secon question. Thought I asked that on another thread</br>  <br>Literally nothing will change.

How do they react to the news?<br><br> &gt;Takes a surprising amount of imagination for me to properly guess but I'd say my mother would just be happy I'm not a NEET.

Thanks OP.<br><br>Happy thanksgiving to all you FREEDOM anons.</br></br>  <br>Yeah. Hell, it's already definitely implied they're quite sex-happy so it won't be long.<br><br>Still, if I turned into a girl, I'd be pretty freaked out that my role is to have the dick inside me  until it turns into a newfound fetish or my XX chromosomes do the trick </br></br></br>  <br>Genderbent characters in hentai tend to get reconciled with the idea really fast.</br>  <br> implying you don't want it right now <br>bend over fucboi</br></br>  <br> As expected...  <br>This shit is so crazy it's almost painful.</br></br>  <br> No impregnation occured yet <br><br>Her (his) sister mentions her niece in the spinoff.

Idiots assume that Harry Potter is popular because of its whimsical setting and fantasy elements. The truth is, it manages seven separate mystery plots that all tie together with an overarching story. Very few humans could write something like that and make it work.</br>  <br>No, Fate is actually good.</br>  Anyone remember this show?  <br>He also told Mexiah that he was taught swordfighting by his Grandpa, who's just a normal old man as far as he's aware.</br>  Dub Ryoko makes me hard  Bump<br>jap &gt; lat spanish &gt; english</br>  Im afraid to watch OVA3.

Its never going to happen even though it would work perfectly.</br>  <br>Neos needs a whole different set of neo spacians and contact fusions. Not only that, they need to be capable of being fusion summoned the traditional way, no longer be forced to return to the extra deck to initiate a contact fusion or if Neo space isn't out, have decent stats and effects on the neo spacians AND their fusions, Yubel and Neos wisemen need to be retrained into HERO monsters as well with Neos wiseman going back to being a fusion.<br><br>I estimate that about 15 or 20 cards like this are needed and Konami does not ever do that for an old archetype, especially an unpopular one. The only way you'd get that is if you were part of the Make-a-wish foundation and even then, Konami would just make another Tyler the great warrior and fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br>Ritual, obviously.<br><br>Ritual Dimension SOON, btw.</br></br></br>  <br>Wrong, just redo the neo spacians as better pendulum monsters and then offer some new support. Contact fusion will work perfectly in combination with pendulum summoning and getting out a field spell is not particularly difficult.<br><br>It is never gonna happen but I can dream.</br></br></br>  Lewdest Yuu.  <br> the biggest problem is their "Return to the deck" clause in all of their fusions and Most of Neo's support forces him to return to the deck after a turn as well. It's a major weakness on an already weak archetype, what the fuck were they thinking?</br>  <br>If they had to insist on returning to the deck, at least make it like Gladiator Beasts. Meaning that when a Neos Fusion returns to the extra deck, it should be able to summon Elemental HERO Neos and any 1 Neospacian monster (except the returned one) so that the Neospacian player gets SOMETHING in return, even if those two monsters would probably get destroyed by your opponent on their next turn.<br><br>I still think the Neospacians would have been better if they didn't return to the extra deck at the end of the turn. Even just making a card where when a Neos monster gets returned to the deck/extra deck by its own effect, it destroys cards your opponent controls, or special summons Neos/Neospacian monsters, or inflicts significant damage to your opponent (the Fusion's Original ATK?).</br></br></br>  No magazine previews for next episode?

Just another shitty Gaia card, several Marik cards and maybe 2 or 3 more original cards that reference the final arc and support the god cards. Through there is a slot open between the new gaia and Five god dragon.</br>  <br>What? <br>Silent Magician and Swordsman are in millennium box according to the last thread where the full set was revealed. <br>If you meant new cards then I don't blame you</br></br></br>  <br> tfw /dng/ is dead because PePe sucked all the fun out of the game and nobody is inspired to try anymore <br>That isn't the reason you shouldn't go to /dng/ for serious conversation about the game. The reason is because they are retarded, you only go there to watch them violently hate everything for little to no reason. I swear /dng/ has taken shitposting to an artform.</br></br>  <br>It's because of synchro, heck even in the Shun vs Crow duel the threads died by Tuesday. No matter how hype the next duel may be the threads will just die off.</br>  <br> Level 9 Pendulum/Synchro <br> Crow gets BTFO'd by Egao Yuya <br>Damn, I fucking want this so much.</br></br></br>  <br>Just do what I do and browse  and translate  doujin sample pages so that you can become even more depressed when they'll never get scanned.</br>  <br> Implying Crow won't break him free through the power of friendship <br>Don't forget the power of childhood friends</br></br>  <br>Why is 5ds the point where Yugioh took a turn for the worst?<br>Didn't the director learn to not shoehorn stuff people won't like lest the curse be transferred?</br></br>  <br>What if I told that  No ?</br>  <br> Brainwashed for literally 2 episodes <br>Come on anon, it's called a sub plot for a reason.</br></br>  <br>Sora is still free and alive and saving Yuzu, dude.</br>   Yuri masquerades as Yuya and joins the Lancers <br> Yuya crashes and becomes a crippled amnesiac duelist on a momentum powered wheelchair  <br> Yugo becomes possessed by Yuto becomes a crazy dude with multiple personalities and mumbles to himself <br> Sora gets captured by Security and is rescued by Yuzu who loses an arm in the process <br> Tsukikage assassinates Crow in his hotel room and it becomes a closed room mystery <br> Jean kidnaps Shun and puts him in a stasis tank to rebuild him into a rage powered mecha bird weapon to use against Academia <br> Reiji    duels  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Millennium pack was listed as having cards that work with Millennium Box 10 new cards total. <br><br>5 of them are God card support, the 3 egypt cards yami marik used, Ra's final form and an original card that supports the gods. 1 is a new gaia fusion and the last is Kaiba's own card of sanity nerfed into the ground. So that leaves 3 new cards left.</br></br></br>  So who has the best EGAO?  <br>You cannot defeat the power of childhood friends, anon</br>  <br>The funny thing is that it wouldn't even be out of place in YGO.</br>  <br>Yuri's EGAO is the greatest EGAO.</br>  <br>Yuri is overrated. And I happen to like him.</br>  <br>You just posted it</br>  <br>Everyone. Yuya's Egao is innocent. Shun's Egao is cute. Yuri's Egao is menacing. Reiji's Egao is Keikaku. Yuto's Egao is forced which is a good thing for him. Yuzu's Egao is full of Joy. Serena's Egao is smugness.</br>  <br>J udai </br>  4 new main deck monsters <br>2 new fusions <br>4 new spell cards</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Sora's Egao is the most cute/innocent Egao. How can someone with such a cute Egao be from Academia?</br>  Will Kaz utilize Synchro/Xyz/Pendulum or will we see more Ritual support in the movie? Or could he be a complete madman and introduce the next big summoning method in the movie?  <br>He won't and we've already gotten our big Ritual for Yugi in Super Black Luster Solider</br>  <br>The last episode was pure crap, to be honest. The next one looks fun, at least.</br>  <br>The next episode looks fucking retarded and the last one at least dealt with relevant characters and their development.</br>  <br>At least Yugo vs Serena would be better than Yuya vs Shinji, Yuya vs 227 or Gongenzaka vs Crow.<br><br>There is no way this duel could be worse than Yugo's duel with Sawatari, since the only way Yugo could do worse is he did Recontract Universe which is impossible for him.</br></br></br>  <br> The next episode looks fucking retarded  <br>Yeah. And actually funny.<br> the last one at least dealt with relevant characters and their development. <br>True, again. And was really boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair Yuya vs Shinji was good only because of EnPal, first parter was shit though.</br>  <br> relevant characters and their development. <br>They may be relevant but so far Yugo and Serena are much more interesting and fun characters than Sora or Yuzu.</br></br>  <br>Lel exactly this, and the funniest part is that the threads was alive not by the fact it was a Sora and Yuzu episode but by the idea of Yuya getting brainwashed.</br>  <br> To be fair Yuya vs Shinji was good only because of EnPal <br><br>The fact Yuya didn't even need EnPal to beat Shinji, and could have just used Dark Rebellion, proved how shit that duel was. They should have put Yuya in a position where EnPal was the only option but by leaving Dark Rebellion as another option, it takes the only good thing about the episode and makes it worthless.<br><br>EnPal could have easily been debuted against Duel Chaser 227, so dueling Shinji didn't really matter.<br><br><br>Will the threads be revived if Yuya reunited with Yuzu and nothing separated them afterwards for the rest of ARC-V?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is he so hard to summon?  <br> Implying anything can fix a duel involving Shinji <br>Shinji uses a deck based around bees. He has a BEE THEMED DECK. Nothing can turn a duel involving Shinji into something interesting unless it ends in him getting carded.</br></br>  <br>I liked the Sora and Yuzu stuff. It was  cute .</br>  <br>At least we got Jack Egao from it, and Jeans infamous OOOOOOHH. Also DRXD shows anger, so defeating Shinji with it wouldn't be no different to how he defeated 227 with pure anger.</br>  <br>Run him in pendulum magicians and hope you draw it?</br>  <br> Will the threads be revived if Yuya reunited with Yuzu and nothing separated them afterwards for the rest of ARC-V? <br><br>Let's just say that the pixiv fanarts will probably implode like Ruri's first on-screen appearance.</br></br></br>  <br>NTaRc-v please go<br><br> I joke, Sora is throwing up way too many of death flags to end in NTR. </br></br></br>  http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Spirit<wbr>_of_the_Tailwind<br><br>I-is Mieru.dek finally good now?</br></br></wbr>  <br>I still have no idea where the whole NTR meme came from when Sora is the biggest Yuuya/Yuzufag around.</br>  <br>Her deck is a based around rituals, flip summons, and random chance. Fucking nothing will make that deck good.</br>  <br>Why do people assume that Yugi and Kaiba will show off synchro and xyz when Takahashi did not do anything for 5ds and Zexal besides draw some characters and give the OK. <br>It's also a movie for old Yugioh fan i.e. The ones who stopped at DM manga so the best you can hope for is a continuation of Millenium world and a couple duels between Kaiba, Yugi and Jounochi</br></br>  <br>Idea/Eidos loops won't affect Monarchs too much, if you want to cripple them you have to ban or limit Pandeity/The Prime Monarch, those are much more dangerous tools than Idea/Eidos, I run 2 pairs and they're there only to cover my ass until I can start milling and searching with Pandeity so I can set The Prime Monarch and have infinite tribute fodder and protection.<br><br>If you want to fuck over Monarchs though you just really need to use Zombie World or Vanity Fiends or both, the only way to get out of those is Erebus, naturally you could also use generic traps or spells but Monarchs are extremely dependent on their own archetype support and having more than 45-50 cards doesn't sound too good due to having more probabilities of getting bad hands, or at least that's how I see it.<br><br> a couple duels between Kaiba, Yugi and Jounochi <br>That's literally all I ask of the movie, I really don't care about the new cards shilling for us nostalgiafags, I just want muh DM characters and hammy fights and Jonouchi banter.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mostly because the YGO movie is going to be like Return of F / Origins for the franchise, which means it's going to try to shill to the nostalgiafags in an attempt to entice them to use Synchros, Xyz, and Pendulums.</br>  <br> Sora already has his redemption, making the entire point of Smile World fucking pointless. <br> yfw Sora saves Yuya from the brainwashing but gets captured himself, then gets brainwashed. <br> yfw Yuya has to duel him to set him free, using the EGAO World he got from Yoko to bring him back. <br> yfw this is how we get Pendulum Synchro Odd-Eyes. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Except Return of F guaranteed SSJSSJG before it came out and Origins shilled Mega charizard before it came out. <br>I don't see where's the shilling for synchro and xyz</br></br>  <br>He's garbage.<br><br>I hope we get a retrain or Sorceress of Dark Magic that stops spells.</br></br></br>  <br> which means it's going to try to shill to the nostalgiafags in an attempt to entice them to use Synchros, Xyz, and Pendulums. <br>I know Konami is stupid but it can't be that stupid. <br>Look at the comment section of any LK vid and you'll see why this will cause the movie to fail catastrophically</br></br></br>  <br> implying Sora won't be forced back to Academia <br> implying Leo won't threaten Sora with getting carded, a fate worse than death <br> implying Sora won't just duel Yuya in a duel to the death only so he can die by Yuya's hands rather than get carded by Leo <br> implying Sora won't lose to EGAO World and die with a smile in Yuya's arm <br><br>F.am, you don't even EGAO.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you are actually tributing for the most part you are running the deck wrong. Idea/Eidos are what make that deck actually viable through proper speed in the current meta. Without that pair Monarchs drop from tier 1 to tier 2 instantly, and thats being a bit generous.</br>  <br>PACHINKOMACHINES, SON</br>  <br>Panchinko is actually a pretty good investment since Japan has sold out consoles for mobile games on phones so Konami basically just made a money printing machine</br>  <br>This sounds more like it. To be truly redeemed Sora will have to make some kind of an ultimate choice between Academia and his friends, not just stall for time and look for loopholes.</br>  <br>It's incrediubly easy now with Pendulum Magicians and Majespecter Unicorn.<br><br>Just not worth using it, when the only Trap that will be used next format is Solemn Notice.</br></br></br>  <br>This is a bad card. The deck needs the Normal Summon to Summon Manju/Senju and Set Flip monsters. Plus, Coinorma is much better. <br><br><br> random chance <br>Eh?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meme Shoukan best Shoukan</br>  <br>He kind of already did choose Yuya and Yuzu over Academia this ep, he apologized to Tsukikage and everything.</br>  <br>Why is Reiji the only one with a straight duel disk blade?<br>Is he  from the Ritual dimension? </br></br>  <br>No, he's from the  Meme dimension </br>  <br>That is the logic behind Konami. They want to maximize profits and their pachinko/mobile games rake in WAY more than any games they make. Konami are ruining games, but logically it makes sense why they are doing it. <br><br>Don't blame just Konami being evil, blame Japan for being so obsessed with mobile games and almost gambling too.<br><br><br>My mistake, I remembered a card having a coin and misremembered it being a coin flip effect. Her deck is still ritual flip based so its utter dog shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But flipping is fun, is what I had the most fun with in Shaddolls.</br>  <br><br> Red blade <br> Straight duel disk <br><br>IS REIJI A FRIEND OR ENEMY?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but none of that is stuff that directly goes against his orders from Academia, just like the whole Ruri trade he suggested to Yuuya. I don't think he's quite over the whole "being part of the Academia is my fate" thing yet.</br>  <br>Clearly Sora needs to take lessons from Kaiba about ignoring his destiny and instead deciding his own fate.</br>  <br>Why didn't Isis just attack directly for game instead of relying on that trap(which still should have worked btw) instead of trying to screw Kaiba over with Obelisk? <br>What was with that Deus ex Machhina?why did the Millenium Rod coincidentally decide to show Kaiba his past life at that crucial moment?</br></br>  <br>IIRC, she was trying to humiliate him because Kaiba took her card intending to keep it for himself (rather than just borrowing it for the tournament... which he basically that anyway). By beating Kaiba by screwing him over with Obelisk, it would be her own version of payback by making Kaiba regret thinking he could do whatever he wanted.<br><br>Aside from Exchange of the Spirit, she never really had anything that could stand up to Kaiba anyway. If anything, Exchange of the Spirit gave Isis a fair chance of beating Kaiba considering she was weaker than either Rishid (would have beat Jonouchi legitimately if he didn't summon Fake Ra) or Marik (all Marik has to do is not summon Ra and he wins, unless she takes Ra from him like Mai did then do the egyptian chant to actually turn Ra against Marik, she wouldn't win). I would even argue that she was one of the weakest of the final eight, either tied with Bakura or weaker than him.</br></br></br>  <br>Isis must really suck then. <br>Even when she cheats using her necklace, she barely stood a chance against Kaiba. <br> Isis is weaker than Rishid  <br>Holy crap why do all the female duelists in DM except Anzu and Mai suck so bad.</br></br></br></br>    I think I have a new respect for Odd Eyes Saber Dragon. That effect that wastes another of your opponents monsters without needing to battle it saved me today.  <br>A friend, obviously.</br>  <br>This was a great duel. On the one hand it showed how pre-determinism is wrong and you have the ability to change your future, but on the other hand it also showed that sometimes you need to embrace who you truly are even if you don't believe it/don't want to.</br>  YAMEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOO</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  I have an urge to pendulum  <br>Bakura had Destiny Board<br>Nothing is weaker than that</br></br>  <br>Bakura almost beat Yugi using fucking Destiny Board of all things. The fact Yugi even needed Slifer was silly in my mind considering how shit Bakura's deck was, and probably could have won with or without it (then again I always assumed Bakura was a strong duelist with a shit deck).<br><br>Then again, all of Bakura's duels were against characters with plot armour, most of them being against Yugi (can't lose) or Kaiba (strong plot amour unless its the main antagonist of an arc). The only duel he was in where the opponent wasn't saved by plot amour was against Bonz and he was a shit duelist anyway who got BTFO easily.<br><br>Then again I haven't seen Yugi vs Bakura at Battle City in a long time so I might be wrong about some of the things.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bakura was a master tactician that was thrown outside of his field of expertise. He was really talented with RPGs to the point of almost cheating (such as being able to throw dice to always roll criticals WITHOUT magic) and unfortunately for him the card game wasn't something he could manipulate, unlike Atem.</br>  <br>Dark Necicrofear was bullshit</br>  Show me your best card, /A/rc-v.  <br>Best Odd-Eyes.</br>    <br>ETERNAL AVENGE</br>  <br>Nice triples.</br>  <br>That card is literally useless against DICHROIC MIRROR.</br>  <br> implying he needs to activate the secondary effect <br><br>Just nuke the field and ram into it.</br></br></br>  <br> 2500ATK isn't less than 3000ATK <br>???</br></br>  <br>The three cards above don't even need their effects to take down clear wing.</br>  <br><br><br>Ok so what about this bad boy?</br></br></br>  <br>shut up let me have this.</br>  <br> tfw summon this against an idle Farmgirl <br> tfw Farmgirl tags out during the battle phase into Destroyer and tries to pop it <br> tfw negate and destroy Dark Destroyer and ATK becomes 5500 <br> tfw Dark Destroyer attempts to activate in grave <br> tfw negate and destroy Dark Destroyer again and ATK becomes 8500 <br> tfw swing for game <br><br>Only worthy use.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need need some REVOLUTIONS!</br>  <br>Odd eyes attacks this. Both gets destroyed with Odd eyes going to the extra. Pendulum summon Odd-Eyes again.</br>  <br>Only if you had Pendulums. Any shit can boost CWSD attack and you are fucked.</br>  <br>The only way of destroying clear wing is with an XYZ or a monster with higher attack points.</br>  <br> Not summoning Odd-Eyes the pendulum way </br>  <br><br>Clear Wing is actually overrated as fuck once it becomes evident that any duelist can take their 2550+ ATK monster and just run Clear Wing over. Goyo would troll Clear Wing since it can run it over and summon it on Security's field. Chimera trolls Clear Wing card since it negates effects in the damage step (or in the anime, its the entire battle phase), can revive Clear Wing on Sora's field with all of its 2500 ATK (only in the anime), then it attacks Yugo directly. If Yugo targets either Chimera or Clear Wing (since both are Level 5 or higher), Yugo gets DICHROIC MIRROR'd himself.<br><br>Shun could just summon Revolution Falcon and just attack Clear Wing since Revolution Falcon's effect when it battles Special Summoned monsters doesn't target.<br><br>The majority of the DDDs can just kill Clear Wing in battle. The only ones that can't are Temujin, Caesar and Ragnarok, the former two get effects when they die and the latter is a Pendulum that revives a DDD every time it is summoned.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Howl of the king, shake the heavens and the earth! Engrave the power of the one and only supreme king into yourself! Synchro Summon! Savage soul, Red Daemon's Dragon Scarlight!</br>  <br>HANKI NO GEKIRIN SUTORAIKU DISUOBEI!</br>  <br>I Miss him</br>  <br>Reminder that Scarlight will get BTFO by OERD and Yuya will become the KINGU</br>  <br>The funniest part is that Academia will invade, soon after that, in which changing the orders and rule of synchro is literally futile.</br>  <br><br>When are we seeing him again? The gorgeous purple wings are just so fucking orgasmatic.</br></br>    <br> Implying Clear Wing anime doesn't have another effect who avoids his destruction in battle. <br><br> Just Kidding </br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had more art of Dennis with Chaos Giant.</br>  <br>Clear Wing is still a pest to most of Chimera's actual materials. There are ways to circumvent that, obviously, and Frightfur Fusion takes the edge off, but that's why Yugo supports Clear Wing with Tri-Eyed Dice (or Chasing Wings), like he'd have done if Yuto had swung with his 2500+ ATK monster.</br>  <br>Well of course when he's up against THE PERFECT it's nothing.</br>  <br> mfw Reiji's next duel has him debut a Pendulum Synchro and/or a Pendulum Fusion. <br> mfw Reiji's Pendulum Synchro and/or Pendulum Fusion will be so powerful that they make the anime version of Kali Yuga look completely shit. <br><br>If people thought the anime version of Kali Yuga was ridiculously good, just wait until Reiji goes BEYOND THE PERFECT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reiji will need to see Yuya synchro/pendulum first to gather the information. Although he probably has his XYZ Pendulum right now.</br>  <br><br>just curious</br></br>  OOOOOOHHH  lmao yuya is always crying n shit. bitch ass nigga  <br>has reira dueled? i forget</br>  <br>No, although his XYZ monster can literally BTFO the entire security force.</br>  <br>His only on-screen duel was against Ayu</br>  <br>Against Ayu in MCS</br>  <br>Against the You Show kids back in Standard only.</br>  <br>LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ENTERMACHINES</br>  <br> Gives Tatsuya the Entermachine archetype <br> Has the "Enterma" theme like Entermates and Entermages <br> Completely unrelated to them since they have no Pendulums... or any extra deck stuff for that matter. <br> Tatsuya's duel with Reira was hyped for nothing, and their interaction at the end meant nothing since Yuya and Jack were the one who gave Reira the character development. <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean Tatsuya never gave up on yuya so there's that but yeah it's not great.</br>  Will Yugi get synchro monsters for Dark Magicians? We'll obviously be out of synchro by the time April comes but I still feel like they could use them, Dark Magicians are all over the place with their levels unlike Blue Eyes.  <br>Megatard X wasn't even revealed before Origins.</br>  Find the person who fucked up.  Yuya is going to be rescued before a microchip is implanted in his head, right?  <br>Shun, he fucked up his ribs and slowed everyone down in the first place.</br>  <br>sawatari<br><br>because he's sawatari</br></br></br>  <br>Ninja. His life points is the lowest.</br>  <br>Yuzu's hair is blue instead of purple.</br>  <br>The writers are sadists.<br>Why wouldn't they? The nips are already going nuts.</br></br>  <br>Sora will save him.</br>  <br>I just want more Yuzu suffering as she finds out what happen to Yuya.</br>  Does anyone have that edit of the subs in episode 80 with Yuya saying "FUCK YOU SHINJI"?    <br>thank you.<br><br>when will commonfags ever learn?</br></br></br>  <br>Never, their destined to be retards.</br>  What's up?  Huh, we didn't get a preview today. I guess we really will have to wait a week to speculate. What shock wa's do you think we'll run into in the episode,zam?  <br>Just have to wait till Sunday for that 30 second preview.<br><br>So what did Jean do to the highway? Did he change the lanes, or is he trying to get rid of Yugo?</br></br></br>  <br>He started fucking with the duel lines, likely to capture Serena and ignore her and Yugo's duel. The people won't give too much of a shit because it means they'll get to Jack vs the champion much faster.</br>  <br> people honestly believe Shun's hand in that duel didn't consist of 3 Vultures and 3 Vanishing Lanius so he could OTK the jobelisks any way he wanted </br>  <br>Roger's priority is to capture Yuzu and Serena, and then have Sergei or Yuya defeat Jack.</br>  <br> Is he trying to get rid of Yugo <br><br>Yeah, he's probably trying to make him crash. Jean really does hate the Yuu's. Scared of Yuri, Wants Yugo to lose, and cutting Yuya's head open.</br></br></br>  Reminder that Moonlights wohn't released ever.   Reiji dueled 3 times thus far <br> Episodes 12-13, where ARC-V's opening was Believe x Believe (1st OP) <br> Episode 40, where ARC-V's opening was Burn (2nd OP) <br> Episode 50-51, where ARC-V's opening was Unleash (3rd OP) <br> We are now at ARC-V's 4th OP <br> mfw Reiji will only get to duel 5-6 times in all of ARC-V. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Guys, I must remind you that Yuya isn't Judai.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> FUCKING YURI CLONES EVERYWHERE GET OUT OF MY DIMENSION <br>I wonder how Roger would react to the knowledge that Yuya ate Yuto.</br></br>  Remember when there was a trash town sub-plot?  <br>Thanks for the movie nobody asked for.</br>  <br>Remeber that Gongenzaka and Sawatari used to be important? Me neither.</br>  <br>Anyone else find it how ever since 5Ds YGO series started fucking blowing through their opening/ending songs?<br>I mean DM was just 5 OP/ED across a grand total of 224 episodes, and then GX had 4 across 180 (99% and Wake up your Heart are pobably the OP/ED that ran for the longest amount of episodes in the entire series), 5Ds had even less episodes and got to 5, Zexal... yeah, Zexal, and now Arc-V, right before even reaching 80 episodes, it jumped to its 4th OP/ED.<br><br>Did they just realize around 2008 that they could cash on the singles or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, especially when they realized that if they pick catchy songs people will buy them. Burn and Trump card are still the best of Arc-V so far, I hope the fifth opening can match with them instead of BelieveXBelieve and Hanate</br>  <br> Burn and Trump card are still the best of Arc-V so far <br>Good taste</br></br>  <br><br>They are wasting money.<br><br>Mieru was also a waste of money, given her lack of relevance as the show goes on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Hanate was the best Arc-V opening?<br>One of the few things that made the transiton from NEBAGIBA NEBAGIBA NEBAGIBA to ARC of Smile a lot easier.<br><br>I mean I like AoS but it just isn't DA PERFEKT</br></br></br></br>  BELIEVE IN NEXUSSSS  <br>True that doesn't mean he can't feel true suffering as well.</br>  <br> mfw ARC-V got fucked over harder by Darkside of Dimension than 5Ds ever did by Crow or the Carly VA sex cult thing... and yet despite those setbacks, is STILL the best YGO series, and could NEVER be considered purely because Zexal (and to a lesser extent, DM) exist. </br>  <br>HASHIRE ASU E</br>  Please let the 5D'sfag put his money where his mouth is and make whatever combination Clear Wing Synchro Dragon and Odd Eyes Pendulum Dragon make amazing to see when appears. I know it won't be Shooting Star Dragon level of awesome but I want it up there.  <br> yfw we get pic related but with Reira because 5Ds reference. <br> yfw Yuri cards Reira because Reira was trying to get in Yuri's way. <br> yfw Yuya witnesses Reira suffering physically and mentally, experiencing true despair before getting carded by Yuri. </br></br></br>  <br>That'll be nothing comapred to when Yuya witnesses his own flesh and blood carded along with his friends</br>  <br>That duel was seriously creepy, I mean, Jeez, Luka actually started dying as if the writers suddenly remembered that she was a bit on the frail side. In fact, I always felt like the twins really didn't belong in this series and were suppose to be kid inserts so they could identify the show as a card game.</br>  <br> Yuya-nii-chan why are you making that face <br> Yuya-nii-chan is that an Academia duel disk <br> Yuya-nii-chan what's wrong with your eyebrows </br></br></br>  <br>I hope it's a scene at that level, Shooting Star's first summon was the hypest moment in my YGO memory.</br>  <br>Indeed, way better than Quasar.</br>  Why do some people still believe that Dennis is better than Sora?<br><br>I don't know, but I always was suspicious of him because of his nice guy personality. Sora was a jerk, therefore he seemed to be more natural and unlikely to be purposely plotting against our MC and his friends (Shun isn't Yuya's friend).<br><br>UNLIKE Dennis, who I always believed he was a classical 'Bitch in Sheep's Clothing'. His friendliness was a mask.<br><br>Even if it turned out that Dennis' personality is genuine, he still doesn't do anything and doesn't genuinely repent. His friendliness is irrelevant if doesn't do anything about it.<br><br>Sora had showed that he cared in spite of his jerkassery. Heck, he even apologized to Tsukikage and admitted that that wouldn't be enough.<br><br>And if that wasn't bad enough, Dennis is just another Shingetsu clone and Academy spy. He strikes me as redundant.<br><br>Any ideas of why people still love Dennis more?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't say "Level/Rank X", they do say "I Fusion/Synchro/Xyz summon"</br>  <br> &gt;Yuya-nii-chan what's wrong with your eyebrows <br>Your post was sad until you wrote this.</br></br>  <br>I really hope that's not the case.<br>He needs more suffering.<br> Mind control is my fetish too.  </br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>I hope.</br></br></br>  <br>THE MEMES JACK</br>  <br> Any ideas of why people still love Dennis more? <br>IT'S SHOWTIME<br>SHOW MUST GO ON</br></br></br>  <br>Mindcontrol is fine but fucking slicing his head is not, it'll surely leave a traumatic scar to his life.</br>  <br>Some people just have shit taste anon</br>  <br><br>I remember hearing the main reason Reiji doesn't duel much is because his VA is very expensive</br></br>  Haven't watched anything since Yuya beat that one guy from the brutal dojo with Rebellion. Is it worth catching up? And where can I watch it?  <br>I really like the Battle Royal stuff that happens soon after that. Synchro is... okay but has some highlights worth watching in my opinion i.e. Yugo vs Sawatari, ETERNAL AVENGE!<br><br>And I'd say just google search for episodes anon.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuya and Yuri's VA <br> Reiji's VA <br> Dennis' VA <br> Mieru's VA <br> Shinji's VA <br> Crow's VA <br> Darkside of Dimensions drains the budget even more <br> If IV comes back for the Xyz Dimension, that a bucketload more money because its also Reiji's VA. <br> If Edo comes back for the Fusion Dimension, that would also be rather expensive. <br> If Aoi Yuuki ever voiced a character in ARC-V other than Mieru, or even if Mieru became more prominent, ARC-V is kill. <br><br>Does the writers even know that they have a budget to keep track of? Even without the nostagiafag movie existing, those would be some REALLY expensive VAs.<br><br>Were Yugi's, Judai's, Yusei's or Yuma's VA ever as expensive (or moreso) than Yuya and Yuri's VA?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I always liked Sora, but I don't buy his redemption. In my opinion, the writers ruined the character. <br><br>At this point, I like Bennis a lot more.</br></br>  <br>Dennis is a genuinely entertaining character and is quite earnest. He feels like a product of his environment that would rather be an entertainer but his alliances lie with his countrymen. Dennis has shown to be useful even if he was a double agent, he also is shown to be more of an informant rather than a soldier. Was it obvious he was a traitor? Yes. But he put more effort into getting along with everyone and it seemed to come naturally due to his natural charisma.<br><br>Sora is a douchebag who was a piece of shit to everyone but was treated nicely for essentially no reason. Not only was he very blatantly not trustworthy from the start but he took sick levels of pleasure in hunting games and is twisted to a personal level. He seems to be showing "remorse" but he only has had any regret for his actions when it directly affects something directly connected to him. Sora is ultimately an extremely selfish little turd, he has said he is sorry but none of that felt genuine other than a way to get Tsukikage on his side.<br><br>Ultimately Sora has done more awful on screen shit than Dennis. Dennis has also shown levels of restraint that Sora has not, he only went all out against Shun and even then he tried to avoid going that deep. Are they both traitors? Yes. Are they both victims of circumstance, fighting for the world that raised them? Yes. But Dennis is far more enjoyable and endearing.<br><br>Also I hate Sora's stupid monkey face.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yugi <br><br>Think not.<br><br> Judai <br><br>KENN only really started his career with him. He noticed it too and tried to ask for moar money. He is the reason why GX ended so weirdly.<br><br> Yusei <br><br>I think he was a bit expensive, he wasn't really a VA<br><br> Yuma <br><br>A dubber (Spencer Breslin's and Edmund Pervensie's 'official' VA) and a nobody so I'm guessing that not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judai's VA was probably the only one who was known when before voicing Judai, compared to Yuya's though, Ono was reginonally recognised in Japan before voicing Yuya, so him being expensive is a no brainer.</br>  <br>Yuma's one started his whole VA career with ZEXAL. So I doubt that he won a lot.<br>Yusei is the singer in a band, Judai and Yugi have singing careers so they are sightly more expensive. <br>Kensho is by far the more expensive MC VA.</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny, I think the opposite. I could always see his redemption from a mile.<br><br><br>He was loved because of his cute face and that didn't last.<br><br>For me, I can buy Sora's redemption. I can't even see Dennis redeeming.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dennis is a fun character, I like him.</br>  <br> &gt;If Edo comes back for the Fusion Dimension, that would also be rather expensive. <br>Really a bunch of the important people from GX are surprisingly big names, Taiki Matsuno, Sanae Kobayashi, Koyasu, Akira Ishida, etc.<br>Also, let's not forget how they've had 4 opening and ending themes across 80 episodes, and you can bet your ass once we reach 100 they're gonna change them again.<br><br>Yugi and Yusei's VAs are singers first and foremost, so you can bet they were at least a bit expensive, as he played Judai, KENN got even more popular and expensive as a VA, on top of his musician career, Yuma's was a no one.<br>Yuya's VA is basically going the KENN path except more expensive even (and he already had a bit of a name before Yuya)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He was loved because of his cute face and that didn't last. <br>And I never found him cute. I found him to be an annoying and cocky little piece of shit that I couldn't stand. His obsession with candy was also overly forced down my throat as "endearing" but just came off as annoying since it was so overt.<br><br>Personally I am hoping that Dennis  is revealed to be part of Reiji's keikaku and was made into a triple agent .</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ultimately Sora has done more awful on screen shit than Dennis <br><br>The worst thing Sora ever did was card Hikage, someone who if Sora didn't card him, Obelisk Force probably would have carded him along with Michio and Teppei.<br><br>Dennis is literally the entire reason the Heartland Invasion happened because he greenlighted the invasion and manipulated Ruri completely. Him ordering the invasion after finding Ruri was single-handedly worse than anything Sora has done both on or off-screen, since he directly caused the invasion which led to basically everyone in Heartland getting carded aside Yuto/Shun/Ruri... and some random people Shun neglected to mention until we get to Xyz Dimension.<br><br>Even then, Sora told Yuto that his allies (Academia duelists) went to Heartland and fought gallantly but Sora said nothing about himself taking part in the invasion. Surely if Sora did take part, that would be the first thing he would mention to Yuto just to be arrogant. There is no way Sora would omit his role in Heartland to appease Yuto since this was during the duel against him.<br><br>I assumed that Sora only became a high-ranked Academia member recently, not long before he first came to Standard, so he wouldn't have even been given permission to go to Heartland by Leo since he wouldn't have been experienced enough in Leo's eyes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, I think the Standar infiltration was his first mission.</br>  <br>I feel the same. Sora went from laughing maniac to "Do whatever you want with me" way too quickly. I fully expected him to become a good guy because FRIENDSHIP but the way it was done was just lazy.</br>  <br>I miss Sawatari being important...</br>  <br>It's because his priority is his promise with Yuya.</br>  I watched 5DS all over again, and ARC V. And Crow is a very likable character, I do have to say that Crow was way better in the first episodes he was introduced oppose to BUY BLACKWINGS at the very end. But it's the same thing with Kurosaki, very likable but he's just there for BUY RAIDRAPTORS. If you want me to compare the first 64 episodes of the series, 5DS feels real, while ARC V feels a bit generic and lifeless. Or maybe that it's just a lot of content they want to showcase so they cut most of it and try to cram<br>Everything. For example two tournaments , and so many characters to develop, oppose to 5DS which was one tournament and fewer characters to develop. YUSEI feels like a good MC he feels genuine, while YUYA feels generic all he does is scream M-MUH YUZU every episode. Also I don't understand how a lot of you guys HATE CROW but LOVE SHUN when essentially they're the same character at the same time period. IM SURE whe ARC V is over and Shun is just a BUY RAIDRAPTORS you guys will hate him too. I think 5DS is far superior, I think ARC V is good better than DM ZEXAL, and I guess IN MY OPINION TIED WITH GX OR JUST A BIT BETTER THAN GX. I think that if ARC V Spent more time developing characters and not having every episode being MUH YUZU it would be cool. Kinda like the battle royale arc. That was pretty fucking good.</br>  <br>I can buy that. <br><br>Their love transcends any ideology.</br></br></br>  <br>[acoustic guitar intensifies]</br>  <br>There is a difference between being the informant that gives the go flag and being directly responsible. He was just their signal to know where Ruri was, Dennis finding her was not the true catalyst of the invasion just the one that decided when to start. We can only speculate what level of participation they had in the hunting games, but the way I inferred it was Dennis was an informant who spent his time trailing Ruri and bowing out once Yuri showed up to take care of her. Likewise Sora's extreme eagerness and excitement at the hunting game showed a level of pleasure that he seemed accustomed to, Sora was fully aware of what he was doing and loved every second of it showing absolutely no remorse.<br><br>In the end we do not know how much they participated in the hunting games, but Sora just seems more rotten to his core than Dennis. Even if that isn't the case Dennis is just a lot more entertaining and is by far the best entertainer in the cast so I just enjoy his presence a lot more, his duels have been the most fun.<br><br>Also  hit another one of my big problems with Sora: his redemption feels way too rushed/forced and people are forgiving him way too easily.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuya feels Generic <br><br>What? If anything he feels less generic and different to the MC's of the past series. <br><br> He never won any tournament by now  <br> He doesn't steal the spotlight compared to the past MC's <br> He hasn't defeated any major villains yet <br><br>If anything he feels way different to the others MC's which I like, considering this was the problem of the past series. The MC gets a shitton of focus where the side characters just vanish as if they are not there or needed. <br><br>Also Yusei not generic? Come on that guy was a stu with no fucking personality. If you want an example of a good MC then Judai is one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dislike Kurosaki at the end <br>Remember that we still have an XYZ Dimension arc to go through, and I'll bet anything Shun will be with Yuya there.

However, Magica Akiyuki of Quartet Akiyuki maker of original, Ume Aoki, Gen Urobuchi (Nitroplus), the shaft, even after the public that has continued to meeting towards the new work of "magical girl Madoka Magica". But this time the concept of the movie was born from among them. Series general director of Akiyuki Shinbo is a video, such as serving as the base for the new work depicting the storyboard. Although there is a short story, it was equipped with elite staff for video production. Theatrical Yukihiro Miyamoto director of supervision, it is something full-fledged theater company that Inukare was in charge of the different space design and Junichiro from the main staff Taniguchi, chief animation director, will participate. Furthermore BGM is Kajiura has created the world of series of music Yuki was composed new music for a new image. Character also of voice, has become a new recording by the cast of our past. After a long time I meet in nostalgic that voice. There is further information to be worried about.

The movie hints at a new project for the franchise, but nothing has been officially announced.<br><br>Magica Quartet—the team behind the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime, consisting of director Akiyuki Simbo, character designer Ume Aoki, scriptwriter Gen Urobuchi (Nitroplus), and animation studio Shaft—have continued plans for a new work since the Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie Part 3: Rebellion film opened in October 2013. The concept movie was born from their meetings.<br><br>Simbo created the storyboards and served as chief director for the short, while series director Yukihiro Miyamoto returned to direct. Composer Yuki Kajiura contributed a new musical piece. Other returning staff members include:<br><br>Alternate Space Design: Gekidan Inu Curry<br>Animation director: Junichiro Taniguchi<br>Sound Director: Yota Tsuruoka<br>Sound Production: Rakuonsha<br>Animation Production: SHAFT<br>The following cast members from previous anime recorded new lines for the concept movie:<br><br>Aoi Yūki as Madoka Kaname<br>Chiwa Saito as Homura Akemi<br>Kaori Mizuhashi as Mami Tomoe<br>Eri Kitamura as Sayaka Miki<br>Ai Nonaka as Kyōko Sakura<br>Emiri Katō as Kyubey<br>Kana Asumi as Nagisa Momoe<br>The original television anime premiered in January 2011, and Crunchyroll later streamed the series. Aniplex of America released the television series, two compilation films, and Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie Part 3: Rebellion sequel film in North America.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, but I still want to see Madoka respond to Homura's feelings.</br>  <br>Anti-Aniplex-kun, please go and stay go.</br>  <br>→</br>  <br>I want to see homuhomu's inept attempt at seduction by feebly performing the Swan Lake.</br>  <br> tfw he suddenly started posting in other threads too <br><br>Guess he just woke up.</br></br></br>  <br>  No Zetsubou Sensei </br>  <br>Considering Homu is a ballet nerd, it would probably work.</br>  Absolutely happening.  <br>But Rebellion didn't conclude anything? The ending even hint that Madoka is going to get her memories back eventually, we need to know whatever will happen to Homura's devil world once Madoka return to being a goddess and realize what Homura did.</br>  <br> Alternate Space Design: Gekidan Inu Curry <br><br>Nice, should look great.</br></br></br>  <br> not realizing an open ending of vague, ominous suffering like that is the perfect way to cap the series <br>I said "thematically," didn't I?</br></br>  <br><br>ANN is always fast with Aniplex related news since they give them a lot of sponsorship and money for helping with their publicity machine.</br></br>  <br><br>AFTER SAYAKA VS HOMURA<br><br> Sayaka dies, Madoka powers up in anger </br></br></br></br>  <br>Sayaka would probably get along well with Homura if she understood her. They're basically mirrors of each other when it comes to the concept of justice.</br>  Why can't they just let it die? I love PMMM but Rebellion ran that shit into the ground.  <br><br>Homura isn't exactly making it easy for her.</br></br>  <br>it's just a cycle</br>  <br><br>If they do a reboot and just disregard Rebellion I'd be more interested but I still think it's pretty much hopeless and that the ending to the TV series was satisfying and final enough in how it closes out the story and that anything else will just feel pointless. Don't forget that when working on the movie Urobuchi pretty much realized this himself and couldn't think of anything new to write when approached about a sequel until that shitlord king of edge producer Iwakami came to him with another one of his stupid edgy ideas about making Madoka and Homura enemies which Urobuchi rightfully questioned as a dumb idea but was told that if he did the movie he had to go with that since it was pretty much decided on by the rest of the Madoka Quartet that that was what they were going to go with. They tried to spin it in the press as Urobuchi being grateful for getting him through his writers block but really you could tell he was kind of chaffing at the idea and can pretty much see how he really felt about it in how he left it right till the end of the movie and seemed to script it so as to be so deliberately sudden, bizarre, poorly explained and questionably in character. Not only that but the fact that he didn't even do anything with the idea of them becoming enemies so much as just presenting the idea almost as if to say "here I had to do this, see how stupid and much of a shock value gimmick this is?" feels like the actual rebellion.<br><br>I swear every idea that Iwakami has is fucking terrible and entirely revolves around trying to combine x edgy idea/personality with y contrasting one in the theory that it will result in some sort of gap moe smash hit and major bucks which so far has worked entirely once with Madoka despite Aniplex's desire to apply it to all of their original shows and making them stupid in the process. Everything else he's done has just relied on Type-Moon or in one instance Mekaku City Actors which thankfully bombed and was laughed at.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A show can only die when almost no one remembers it. Like Tari tari.</br>  Yes! Yes! Finally, life will return to Meguca threads and we can banish the tripfaggot menace. Rejoice!   Ballet-themed sequel <br><br>This was literally teased at the end of Rebellion.<br><br>Masterful work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Odette Homu vs Odile Homu confirmed.</br>  <br>That's the entire conflict, Sayaka thinks she's out to do evil when she isn't.</br>  <br>One can dream friend, one can dream...</br>  <br><br>Homura literally tells her that she's the embodiment of evil now.<br><br>It's not Sayaka's responsibility to assume she's lying. It's bad enough she ripped the God right out of her best friend and possibly fucked up the universe for everyone, even if it was for Madoka's sake.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the most surprising thing is that Shinbo storyboarded it</br>  <br>The symphogear killer</br>  <br>Unbelievable.</br>  <br>Someone has to break Homura out of her chuuni devil delusions. Sadly, this series lacks a lesbian with a determination to fist in the protagonist role.</br>  <br><br>Can we not use the sketchy at best retelling of a sotyr to see if something is canon or not? Its like going through and using the lord of the rings movies and trying to talk about the book from it.</br></br>  Madoka looks, uh, older in that concept art. Few year timeskip, maybe?  <br>But Homura is also and autistic chuuni so her words can't be taken at face value.</br>  <br>She says that in the movie too, turbonerd.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Well she didn't fuck up the universe and the cycle is still intact and now madoka can live outside of being a martyr. How was homura wrong at all?<br><br>Because she takes away madokas half assed dream of helping people? She literally thought that up in one convo with her mom</br></br></br>  <br> Well she didn't fuck up the universe <br><br>Did you not notice the moon at the end?</br></br></br>  <br>The thing people never realize about Madoka is how much Homura actually means to her. If you watch Rebellion from her point of view she spends the movie basically obsessing over Homura. It doesn't matter how much good Homura does if it hurts her, just like it didn't matter what good Madoka did to Homura if it meant Madoka died.<br><br>She would definitely try to reach out to her.</br></br></br>  <br>Aniplex of course rally wants to push Madoka for all the cash that it brings but I think Shimbo and Shaft have enough say that they can keep them out of the influence of the anime until they are ready to continue it, they may be just of big of shills but they won't put anything out if they know they're not ready, it was iffy with the movie coming out as quick as it did but they really have to put the main series on hold if it's going to keep its repute, and Shaft/Shimbo has that power</br>  <br><br>For Sayaka to fight Homura they actually have to remember she exists and is supposed to be relevant in the first place and really I have zero confidence in that.</br></br>  <br><br>People only remember or care about it for the hype and getting to shitpost about it on the internet at this point anyway. Have you seen the fanbase for this show lately by the way, it's kind of fucked up and fanatical and doesn't even seem to know up from down, just that they're supposed to go ballistic over anything related to the franchise.</br></br>  <br>of course spin-off titles will still be milked to hell by aniplex, but shaft will keep full hold on the anime and the level of quality they are trying to keep with it, they won't let aniplex interfere just to make a quick buck</br>  <br><br>I don't recall anything about the original TV series being anywhere near that simplistic or black and white. Why exactly should Homura be the embodiment of evil anyway, what about her character is supposed result in her representing that anyway? It barely makes any sense.</br></br>    <br>no one cares if the TV series ended well, this is anime and if we can get more fap material of best girl for whatever show is getting most money thrown at it, I'll take it integrity be damned</br>  <br><br>Which probably means it's going to be a clusterfuck of weird imagery, fanservice and things that are ripped off from Osamu Dezaki style directing and shot framing, the latter if we're lucky. Really I'm just expecting a whole lot of overblown nothing out of this short and if they do do a sequel they'll probably just end up taking the greatest hits of whatever the audience reacted too which knowing the Madoka fanbase will probably be the stupidest most irrelevant shit.</br></br>  <br>sounds like something a really nice person would say, as expected of Homu, taking the bullet or the sake of a better world</br>  <br>I swear I thought that was Homu in the picture first.</br>  <br> Which probably means it's going to be a clusterfuck of weird imagery, fanservice and things that are ripped off from Osamu Dezaki style directing and shot framing, the latter if we're lucky <br>yes, it's going to be great.</br></br>  <br><br>Shinbo is just Aniplex's favorite yes man that isn't a fan. He's quoted as saying that his primary goal as a director is to make shows that will make a lot of money and please the producers. It's why Aniplex loves working with him and Shaft so much, he's like their dream director that will completely tow the line and never do anything unexpected and that he isn't told to since he is so stuck in one particular style over substance approach that is similar to Aniplex's own view on how anime ought to be produced. It's also why the franchise is kind of fucked now because if Aniplex gets some stupid idea that they see as having commercial potential he's going to go right along without so much as a question and the fanbase will eat it up because they have this misguided view of Shinbo as a visionary that's in control and only has great ideas that are uniquely his own and they don't know how to have any reaction to anything related to this franchise other than to start tossing out words like masterpiece and genius like they're going out of style. It's all pretty meaningless and really they're no better than other zealot fanbases like Type-Moon or KEY that just say yes and praise everything they do to the point where they get inflated egos and we end up with crap like Charlotte that anyone besides KEY fans can see is a mess of a script.. It's why Aniplex is also starting to latch onto and exploit Key and Type-Moon stuff more and more and why I can never expect much out of them. When you're favorite sort of core fans are ones that will never give anything but glowing praise as long as a certain persons name is attached to a project even in the face of obvious shoddy work how can you realistically expect much. Nobody is challenging or is going to hold these people to any sort of standard. It's been a problem with this scene for a long time and only really benefits producers ultimately since idiot fanboys have no idea what they're talking about anyway.</br></br>  <br>wew lad</br>  <br>Is this the new Homuhater?</br>  <br><br>If you're asking me it's pretty shallow and a further simplification of her character, possibly to do a little light yuri pandering. Madoka's character like most of them in the TV series had a lot more on their minds and things they were concerned about than how the movie portrayed them. Really everything in that movie just came across as kind of shallow, black and white and frankly just kind of stupid in comparison.</br></br>  <br>You're so full of shit, dude.</br>  <br>God I hate Key shows  Angel Beats was cool </br>  <br>No, it's the anti Aniplex autist from sales threads.</br>  <br><br>What level of quality is that exactly? What is it with this franchises fanbase and all this wishful thinking anyway?</br></br>  <br><br>Finally an honest post. This is absolutely what anime is all about once you strip away all the bullshit about masterpieces and genius material. People are so full of shit when they go on about that sort of stuff.</br></br>  <br><br>Well seeing people eat it up if that is the case and try to make incomprehensible fanboy fueled arguments about why it's gods gift to media and should win an Oscar should be hilarious. I still remember when people were legitimately pissed when Rebellion was rejected by the academy for Oscar consideration as if it ever had a remote chance of being considered anyway. Maybe in their delusional fantasy filled heads.</br></br>  <br><br>Hey somebody has to say it.<br><br><br><br>Maybe a little but definitely not that much compared to the Madoka fanbase</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't even have any arguments, it's just hearsay that wouldn't even matter if true when it comes to how good the movie itself is.</br>  <br>Timeline 1 Madoka felt the same way. She was just a run of the mill magical girl who became on for a really minor reason until Homura gave her something to fight for.<br><br>Homura has always given her strength. It's not really oversimplification when her character is based around never giving up hope. The same thing applies in this case, Homura could condemn herself to the worst sins, but Madoka would never revoke her hand in aid.</br></br></br>  <br>Well I knew Frozen would easily win the Oscar since it was the best among those submitted.</br>  <br>Well, to be fair, saya even when her mission was to help her, didnt made things easier for homu back in the dreamworld up until the very last moment.<br><br>I know, its in the script and all, but im pretty sure an enlightened being would think a better way to guide or leave clues to an angry PTSD ridden girl than to confuse and scare the shit out of her.</br></br></br>  <br>LOL</br>  <br>I visited Disneyland last summer and everything was Frozen. I mean everything. Every show, every parade, every piece of merchandise.<br><br>That piece of shit is the most overrated film ever made. Nothing comes close.</br></br></br>  <br>Word.</br>  <br>Frozen was shit though. Even Rebellion deserved it more.</br>  <br><br>Heresay? Then what do you call this whole it's a concept movie that might lead to a new work so clearly that means we're getting a new work and it'll be awesome no matter what thing that people seem to be having as a reaction to this. Like I said this fanbase is fucked in the head.</br></br>  <br><br>Frozen was pretty much a result of the Academy yet again bending to popularity and pressure and going with the easy familiar chose in the Disney/Pixar movie. I even remember reading quotes from Academy voters literally saying things like they didn't see the other movies or what the fuck is this shit or that they're daughter liked it and it's Disney so they voted for it by default. Best animation category is a joke, but that doesn't mean Rebellion should have won either like angry weaboos think.</br></br>  <br>Original series was great, Rebellion was even better in many aspects and much more ambitious. There's no reason to expect that its continuation will be bad, especially not with that very interesting and mysterious ending that left things off. If it comes out and it sucks then we'll contend with it then. Of course people are excited about the prospect, silly. It's even dumber to presume that the thing will be bad.</br>  <br>My worry is Rebellion was virtually perfect. Unless they can come up with an interesting twist, it will just end with Madoka and Homura getting together.<br><br>Which is fine, everyone wants a happy ending for those two, but Rebellion's ending is the best from a storytelling perspective. All that was really missing was a guidebook explaining the semantics of Homura's new world.</br></br></br>  <br> Someone has to break Homura out of her chuuni devil delusions <br><br>Fucking this.<br>I love you Homura, but for christ's sake, just stop.<br><br> pic unrelated </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kino <br>Why's Kino there? <br>Is there a Kinos Journey short or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Shaft did second movie of it</br>  <br>Usui is there.</br>  what if we get super happy slice of life?  <br>That's highly unlikely.</br>  <br>Fucking neato.</br>  <br>That's called Hidamari 5th I guess.</br>  I want an extremely edgy ending where Homu goes crazy and kills everybody including herself. I can't be the only one, r-right. I know it would probably be shit but I want to see it happen.  <br>Only an ending edgier than Rebellion's would satisfy me.</br>  <br> You're not wrong. <br> That ending would most definitely be shit <br><br> I respect your opinion though. <br><br><br> Do we really want Homura to turn into the Shadow the Hedgehog of anime? I mean you have to have some edge to fit her character, but going full CRAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWLING IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN is a bit much, don't you think? <br><br> pic related </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A couple of loops of leading the megucas into death or killing them, seeing Madoka pass out before her eyes. Laughing in masochistic pleasure.</br>  <br>Really I just want to see her continue being chuuni and universe-rending-tier yandere for Madoka.</br>  <br>stop posting forever</br>  <br>I agree. We already get the twists and symbols and themes of the work.<br><br>At this point there's nothing but torturing cute anime girls for the sake of it.</br></br></br>  <br>But I don't want to.</br>   concept movie released <br> Shaft just does Kizu and prism nana <br> no news for years <br>I can see it.</br></br></br>  <br>Not the other way around?</br>  <br>Homura is walking Masochism. She hates herself, has her own familiars pelt her with tomatoes on a daily basis, and [spoilers]thinks she[/spoiler]became the literal embodiment of evil and suffering.<br><br>She's Madoka's whore every day of the week.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I personally wouldn't want some painfully unfitting ending like that to be the canon end to my favorite anime, but I don't see them saving the series after Rebellion.</br></br></br>  <br> fucking up the spoiler that badly <br><br>Someone just hand me a rope already.</br></br></br>  <br>Really, if you don't count Homura becoming the devil out of love, Madoka is gayer than Homura throughout the series.<br><br>So yes, Homura is Madoka's property. Has been from the start.</br></br></br>  <br/>  I thought Rebellion was shit compared to Beginnings and Eternal.  This thread got really gay really fast.<br><br>That's because Beginnings and Eternal were recaps of an already good series.</br></br>  <br>  it is a code for 'Milk-this-franchise-dry'. <br><br>Is it still a thing. <br><br>Remember when people claimed that they would milk the series after the third movie with a second season and stuff. <br><br>After three years I'm still waiting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   concept video <br><br>Will this become something like Ufotable's Touhou thing and normal people will never see it?</br></br>  <br>Because it was.</br>   Animation studio SHAFT will unveil a short concept movie for a new story related to Puella Magi Madoka Magica <br>If you think about it a bit deeply, you realize Rebellion sequel will never happen. People were right.</br>  <br>If you actually looked, you'd see it stars the same characters. Unless this is some kinda prequel shit or retelling, it's a sequel to Rebellion.</br>  <br>Shinbo even said that people should see it as alternative ending. <br><br>It basically the bad end in movie form.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If that's really the case I'd be really sad as there was a lot of things I wanted to see fixed after rebellion. I just want some closure on the series and want a real end. Yet alas the only end I can really see working is that all the girls end up in the afterlife and I don't want to see that.</br></br>  <br>You could basically do a Zelda thing and tell the same story in different way. <br><br>With all the time travels and unvierse rebuildings. It would work within the narrative.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck Madoka and Monogatari, I want more Kino.</br>  Why is Kino suddenly a Shaft thing if they only did one Kino OVA and REC with the same director?  <br>Rebuild of Madoka, do you really think people are joking about that?</br>  <br>That pose in the OP pic is probably from the ballet "Dying swan"<br><br>And here is the plot summary of dying swan.<br> Arms folded, on tiptoe, she dreamily and slowly circles the stage. By even, gliding motions of the hands, returning to the background from whence she emerged, she seems to strive toward the horizon, as though a moment more and she will fly—exploring the confines of space with her soul. The tension gradually relaxes and she sinks to earth, arms waving faintly as in pain. Then faltering with irregular steps toward the edge of the stage—leg bones quiver like the strings of a harp—by one swift forward-gliding motion of the right foot to earth, she sinks on the left knee—the aerial creature struggling against earthly bonds; and there, transfixed by pain, she dies. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Magica quartet would never do something that shitty<br><br><br>I don't think I can handle homu dying</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Madoka. Probably.</br>  <br>WHY they would call sequel as "a new story related to PMMM?" It's a new story, if it has same cast - it's rebuild.</br>   he wants Homura to lose <br>you want to go back to the world where Madoka dies and the incubators run the show?</br>  <br>I still fail to see how rebellion was the bad end. I simply don't understand how homura saving madoka from being a martyr and keeping everything from her original wish intact is somehow the bad end. Is it because she's wearing black?</br>  <br>The last film ends with a whole new world being created, no shit it's gonna be a new story. <br><br><br>The promo key frame? That's definitely Homura.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is your point to lie so terribly? Picrealted. If you hate Rebellion you should gtfo from these threads long ago.</br>  <br>The most likely scenario is that the short movie will be standalone, and tease a new project, which is the actual sequel.<br><br>It's very hard to imagine them doing a new unrelated story with the same characters.</br></br></br>  Maybe a short spin-off or maybe an even more experimental thing? That's the sort of impression I get from "concept movie".<br><br>The actual continuation would be pushed a lot harder and made a much bigger deal than a random screening like this with little other fanfare around it, unless this ends up being a sort of prologue to the next thing.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, bring the melancholy, I'm ready for it. I felt cheated in Rebellion, I could see the ending. Homu goes to afterlife with Madoka, tears would be shed but ultimately it's for the better and she's together with Madoka. Then time skip to Kyouko and Mami having tea in Mami's apartment with the other 3 as silhouettes sitting around the table all laughing and having fun together, which servers to crush my soul and bring all the tears flooding forward.</br></br>  So exactly s2 when?  This will inevitably happen.  <br>Ooh wait, I have a picture for this occasion.</br>  <br>It's got Madoka's hair and outfit.  And breasts. </br>  Early screenshot  <br>I guess this is a photo of a TV but was the actual photoshopped image that was photographed here ever actually posted anywhere</br>  <br>But eyelids. Homu has double eyelids while Mado has single ones.</br>  <br>Fake</br>  <br>I think it could be either. Again, Homu is the one of the six who is the ballet nerd.</br>  <br>Another screenshot.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134013778 <br><br>I could see Urobuchi going with this and people praising it as a stunning display of unexpected and avant garde writing. I mean most of the Madoka movie was the cast trundling around in some fake world with stupid songs and fights to make Homura look cool and most of Psycho Pass was the characters just babbling and retreading the beats from the end of the first season. The guy doesn't seem to give much of a fuck anymore, he pretty much knows he's in that magical position of eroge writers like Maeda who can write anything and have it get A+ rave reviews from his cult of fanboys. It just sucks for anime that these people got brought in and now we have to suffer and endless rotation of them and the bleeding of their creepy weird fans. It also sucks for other aspiring writers who might have good ideas but would get passed over from hack eroge writer just winging it because their fanboys from their own scene would bring in more money. Face it at this point populae late night anime has pretty much just fallen under the subset of the eroge subculture its not its own distinct entity anymore.</br></br>  It's just for the Madogatari exhibition nothing special  <br><br>That's cause it was full of stupid half baked ideas half the staff clearly didn't even want to do. They could have had it just be a 60 minute flick and nothing would have really changed</br></br>  <br>Are you gonna be the new crack-kun type character, faggot? We just got rid of him and already someone almost as annoying has taken his place. At least he would get banned for his shit.</br>   Madomagi sequel is now in Japanese twitter trends <br> Japanese google it and watch that april fool fake trailer as if it's real <br>lel</br></br>  <br>NO FUCKING SHIT</br>  so is it a continuation for rebellion or something totally different? like the other magical girls around the world <br> id like both </br>  <br><br>I honestly dont know what that means</br></br>  Who needs Madoka if Shaft is already doing another magical girls show?  <br>Even if its total milking, I won't say no to a new tv serie.</br>  <br>No one knows yet. Do not believe anyone that claims they do.</br>  <br>It's a "concept movie".</br>  <br>It's a kind of insurance.</br>  <br>Hopefully it's a moe SoL wherein instead of fighting, they eat cake all day and do random things in school</br>  <br>They eat school all day and do random things in cake</br>  <br>More like QB race will create artifical catgirl from their own race with sole purpose to become strongest magical girl to defeat Homura.</br>  <br> muh headcanon <br>Magica Quartet Team handles the story, not only Urobuchi<br>See Gekidan Inu Curry being the ones who made the bizarre aspect of the witches instead of the dumb kaiju thing Urobuchi thougth</br></br></br>  Children's Card Game Heterosexual Madoka is better  <br> And breasts <br><br>Spot the homu.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he's Anti-Aniplex-kun. Pretty infamous already, but usually he just trolls the sales threads.</br>  <br>barf</br>  <br>The 11s can't read witch runes, I take it?</br>  <br>The press release never said "sequel." For all we know, SHAFT could have reconned Prism as a Magica spin-off.</br>  Well, I didn't expected this.  <br> Homura literally tells her that she's the embodiment of evil now. <br>that's the role she took up for herself</br></br>  <br>Anon please.</br>  <br>what? i love the tv series and i like rebellion, but i don't need more milking, oh fuck... i'm ok how it ended, i don't need more<br><br>Maybe is just a short to make a spin off or something related but i don't want milking of the main story</br></br></br>  <br>the villain Madoka Magica deserves</br>  <br>Hello anon. If I find a foreigner in there this sunday. It might be you.</br>  <br> milking <br>I never really understand that particular line of criticism for the franchise. Madoka doesn't get yearly reboots. It's been 5 years, and the entire franchise has a grand total of ~6 hours of animation. Where's the milking?</br></br>  <br>It's been two years since Rebellion. If this is milking, qutie frankly, they been doing a pretty shit job at it.</br>  <br> make a spin off or something related <br>there are several spinoff mangos they could adapt if they wanted to</br></br>  <br> i like rebellion <br>fucking WHY?</br></br>  <br> literally nooooo Stop liking things! </br>  <br>Please don't find me. I'm still like, what the fuck.</br>  <br>Wow, that's interesting.</br>  <br>Why not?<br><br>If they want to do something more, Different Story anime fucking when?<br><br><br>i know i could sound exaggerated, but i'm afraid about the franchise could be ruined or turn shitty with some forced sequel just for money, i don't know what wants to do SHAFT after finish Monogatari right now</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>It's a reasonable concern but I wouldn't go so far as to make assumptions about its production circumstances and certainly not before judging any new work on its purely on its own merits first.</br>  <br> You sound uninterested. </br>  <br>I'm the same way. Madoka (and Rebellion) is perfect, and I'm eternally terrified of the franchise become tainted by a subpar sequel. It'll take at least a year after this announcement before we get any actual release date. The long delay leave me some faith that the Magica Quartet really do want to find the right story to tell. It's not like the franchise is hurting for money right now. They mobage collabs keep coming, and Madoka SLOT is still available at 7405 pachinko parlors.</br>  More Kyouko! That's a great thing.  <br>maybe because of all kind of merchandise released since 2011<br>You are making a point here, yet shitposters and haters will ignore it just because of Madoka popularity</br></br>  <br>Well, you know, it's not like there's any shortage of people who thought Rebellion was the sequel that tainted it</br>  <br>As much as I like Kyouko, she was the weakest character in rebellion with the least development. I wouldn't mind if she had more of a focus in future works, but I had also hoped that they'd expand the universe by bringing in additional characters rather then lock in to the same core - but I suppose I misread Ume's involvement with the character design, and perhaps the lack of imagination beyond that point. In theory there should be many more magical girls active in other cities; I'd like to see more of those stories.</br>  Setting hype thrusters to medium. We'll see what comes of this.<br>I'm not familiar with the concept of concept movies, how long are these things generally?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134013778 <br>Giving a complete, easy to understand lecture on thermodynamics in only 90 minutes would be actually a feat most teachers would dream of.</br>  <br> but I had also hoped that they'd expand the universe by bringing in additional characters rather then lock in to the same core </br>  <br>Literally who</br>  <br>Bebe was way more helpful than Nagisa though<br>Hopefully she will have some development in the new story</br></br>  <br><br>Oh I love Charlotte, my favourite witch. Mami needed pairing of for Rebellion, hence bebe, that's how I read the movie line up.</br></br>    <br>The whole concept of "tainted" is bullshit though.<br>Probably comes from the same people who watch a 5 hour series for the ending.<br>The main series stays good no matter what comes afterwards.</br></br></br>  <br> In theory there should be many more magical girls active in other cities <br>there are, considering the spinoffs. but the big action seems to be happening in mitikahara.<br><br><br>I found her design a bit disappointing.

Karera is cutest girl.  <br> purest <br> not Shizuka  <br><br>shit taste to be very truthful bro</br></br></br></br>  <br> two left hands </br>  <br>all Joestars have the innate genetic desire to fuck people up, act like manchildren and cause shenanigans. Let's look at the facts<br><br> Joseph fucks with police, starts fights with people out of nowhere, is a lazy fuck <br> Jotaro is a delinquent, starts fights, walks out of restaurants without paying <br> Josuke starts fights with randomers about his fucking hair of all things, tries scamming everybody, scamming Rohan, scamming the lottery, spends his off time being /v/ <br> Giorno is a fucking Mafioso and Dio's son, nuff said <br> Jolyne - chronic masturbator and all round lack of manners/respect <br><br>Johnathan only grew up to be a legit, respectable gentleman because he wanted to prove a point about being better than Dio in the eyes of his father. Before Dio came along, Johnathan was implied to be a slacker, had poor table manners, and started fights with strangers under the pretense of being a white knight</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Joseph in his youth is canonically the tallest.</br>  <br> chronic masturbator </br>  <br>What about Gappy?</br>  <br>Johnny blatantly hangs the biggest dong, but he can't use it until he gets cured of his cripplehood. That's why he's so salty and ruthless throughout SBR</br>  <br>Did my best.</br>  <br> Jolyne - chronic masturbator <br>You scallywag.</br></br>  <br>who the hell knows</br>  <br>He steals people waifus and daughters.</br>  <br>I was only talking OG universe genes, but Johnny and Gappy are both even more morally grey and unphased by conflict than all of the OG universe JoJo's put together</br>  <br>Everyone is a cunt during their teenage years, the point is that most of the Joestars grow out of it and mature alongside the reader into upstanding citizens once they become adults, it's character progression. <br>We haven't had a chance to see Giorno or Josuke as adults, which is a shame, but this applies to Jonathan, Jolyne, Jotaro, and Johnny, every adult Joestar is a pretty decent person.<br> Except for Joseph. </br></br></br>  <br>Jolyne</br>  <br>Adult Giorno would be a scary motherfucker. If he was this ruthless as a teenager there's no telling how bad he would be.</br>  <br>If you were forced to pick between having either Cheap Trick or Notorious BIG as your stand which one would you choose? One kills you and becomes another person's death sentence if someone sees your back and the other will only activate after you die and will become a world ending catastrophe if left unchecked.</br>  <br>Araki will never let Giorno become an adult, he needs to stay a teenage twink to generate maximum fujobux.</br>  <br> live or die  <br><br>B.I.G.</br></br></br>  <br> One kills you <br>Does it?<br>BIG either way.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, he also inherited Jonathan's moralfag genes.</br>  Forgot to update this.  <br>One of the first things we see him do is scam Koichi and steal his luggage.</br>  <br>Notorious B.I.G. <br>So I could plan where to die and who to take out and not have to hide my back from everyone like a idiot.</br></br>  <br> Obtain Cheap Trick. <br> Build a movable house around myself, or alternatively, hold up an umbrella with a shower curtain attached to it. <br>No one will see my back, and it's not clothes. <br>Checkmate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's 1/2 Josuke, 1/4 Jotaro, 1/4 Kira, right?</br>  Random blathering here, but assuming 48 for each part from here on, with the next part airing the spring after it finished, we won't see people's reactions to Part 6's ending until 2022.  <br>48 episodes, I mean.</br>  <br>Can I see your math? The last time I saw an anon calculate when each part was going to air they said that part 7 was going to air in 2021.</br>  <br> describe /a/ in one picture </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Going to sleep now, but thanks for your contributions! They've all been added. I'll check back in this thread tomorrow if anyone else wants to contribute.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, so Part 4 starts in 2016. Assuming it runs for 24 episodes, stops, then resumes in summer for 24, it'll finish in 2017. Part 5 would start in spring 2018, run for 24 episodes, take a break until summer 2019 and finish in 2019. That'd make 6 start in 2020 and finish in 2021, with 7 starting in 2022.<br><br>I guess I did fuck up my math but not in the way you had me thinking, so we'd see people's reactions in 2021. This is all assuming they follow the same schedule for Part 3 for all of the parts, of course.

Just size. 20,000 is a lot of words. That's all there is to say on the matter.</br>  <br>That's not really much. All you've gotta do is learn 50 cards every hour, which is pretty easy. That's more than a minute for every new card, so you could just spend 50 minutes on new cards and the rest of the 10 minutes on reviews and other stuff, and then you just keep this pace all day, and then within the month, you'll have learned 36,000 words. That'll make you native level. There's really no excuse to not knowing Japanese. Anyone could do it in a month if you really wanted to.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter how long it takes to learn them. 20,000 is a lot.</br>  Drawfag Thread - 1638<br>second rarfag's files until thread 1629:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://desustorage.org/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Previous thread #1637 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> Not him <br>But using the exact same argument as him.</br></br>  <br>Thank god no one remembers the shit I drew when I started</br>  The collage is ded anyways, so discussion about it should be ded as well  <br><br>Oh boy, he's desperate.
