Why didn't you just wait for the 4koma guy to make one when he was done?</br>  Its not like 'shit threads' for any other anime get banned. I don't understand the jannny sometimes.<br><br>Most times.</br></br>  Artist intentionally makes Shigure look yandere right?  <br/>  <br/>  I just want a place to post dank shipsluts.  <br>I-I'll take her in...</br>  <br>The reason I keep living is because of kantai thread.<br><br>Kaga-san don't make a face like that</br></br></br>  <br><br>Funny how that Kaga singing is the no.1 thing that artists and drawfags draw about. Nobody really cared about Abubear kai2.</br></br>  Dear diary: today, the stack was fat.  <br>Either that or fat tenryuu</br>  <br>Abubear is only bearable with the game muted.</br>  Why do I like  Zuikaku  so much?  When did you first realize that Aoba and Furutaka were lesbians?  <br>Fat Tenryuu is the greatest thing to happen to Kancolle in ages.</br>  <br>Fat Tenryuu &gt; Kaga singing</br>  What happened to the previous thread? More than 200 posts were deleted after the thread died for some reason.  <br>Hot pockets.</br>  <br>4chan is not a stable site.</br>  I sortof just remembered I trimmed these.<br><br>The other 40 pages in this book were shit, but there was 8 good pages at least.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Last thread got deleted because it was a shit thread and titled with "general" in the OP with dank meme image on top of that. Probably was the same anon from months ago that was doing pic related.</br></br></br></br>    <br> Kancolle <br> small c <br><br><br>Too many secondaries around. Only those who play the game would appreciate Abubear's Kai 2.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>OP is a faggot</br>      <br>Right after you said that.

Game discussion will drown out everything.</br>    <br>I meant a link, even if no one proofs it here the person who runs the blog can still catch errors when I send it over.</br>    <br>Not really, /jp is now full of crossboarders shitting up the thread, including that annoying as fuck small c anon<br><br><br>That's why we need to organize translations, it's all over the place and it blows because it's the only good content.</br></br></br></br>  <br>During events maybe. The rest of the time it's practically dead. There used to be plenty of doujinshi dumps over there.</br>    <br>Yeah, but not all the errors will be caught like that.<br><br><br>The /jp/ thread has always been full of crossboarders though.<br><br><br>And there's a reason why the doujinshi stopped being dumped there. Because hardly anyone read them when they were posted there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  A documentary about Mutsu?<br>http://may.2chan.net/b/res/34511430<wbr>8.htm</wbr></br>  <br>Is that the same trick from Battleship?</br>  Abukuma for MC of S2!  <br>That's what I was thinking when typesetting it, I forgot to get a video to go with it.</br>  <br>Hello my white friend.</br>  <br> wanting S2 </br>  <br>I thought it was because towyen got tired of dumping on two places.</br>  <br>I'm gonna ring that useless piece of shit some day kamo.</br>  <br>What, it proved that kancolle was the yuri show we all knew it was meant to be.</br>  <br>wasn't it more like a segment of a tv show? an anon posted a link yesterday<br>they interviewed a former crew (?) 85 y/o man</br></br>  <br>S1 was utter crap, yuri or not.</br>  <br>Episode 6 was good. And the part with the Kongou sisters shenanigans in episode 4 was good.<br><br>About everything else was terrible though.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh fug, gonna go dig for the link then.</br>  <br> episode 6 <br> great <br>It was better than the rest, but it was anything but great. I bet whoever was in charge of it decided to write things that way because every other episode was so much worse than 6 that he figured he could get away with whatever crap he wrote.</br></br></br>  <br>I only saw Kaga here, is Kagafags really that cancerous?</br>  <br>It wasn't a video link but a matome <br>http://akankore.doorblog.jp/archive<wbr>s/44754708.html</wbr></br></br>  <br>And there's a reason he chose /a/ over /jp/ in the end.<br><br>Besides if the translators move to /jp/, chances are so will the spammers.</br></br></br>    It seems that 秋津洲流戦闘航海術 is an actual thing going by jp wikipedia page for Akitsushima being the first result. Too bad there aren't any records I can find in English of the maneuver.  <br>Yeah but only Shoukaku is a canon yandere</br>  <br> tco37K4a </br>  <br> He doesn't check Maupons twitter account. </br>  Will we see Akizuki and Oboro being lovers in the next season?   Poi   <br> playing for stats </br>  <br> Maupons <br> s </br></br>  <br>No, we will see S2 being cancelled because S1 was so crap that if they made an S2 no one will buy it even if they gave event tickets for every BD volume.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>    <br>S1 was a resounding commercial success<br> S2 cancelled <br>Nice fond wishing though</br></br></br>  <br>Are you being negative because you don't want them to be lovers or something?</br>  <br>Nah, the reason this thread doesn't get deleted is because mods are sleeping</br>  <br> resounding commercial success <br>Not according to Kadokawa</br></br>  <br>Sure, I'll watch S1 being a commercial success and S2 having 3 digit sales tops because people are so disgusted by Kadokawa that they'd rather drop this franchise and go to something else.<br><br><br>I can't care less about them. However, the cancerous anime is a different matter altogether.</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to industry standards, no one cares what Kadokawa believed to be the numbers to be a "line" passing success.</br>  <br>The anime isn't influencing the players to leave the fandom regardless of how bad potentially it could be.</br>  <br> no one cares what Kadokawa believed <br>They're the ones in charge of deciding if there's a season 2 or not.</br></br>  A side character has never deserved to win more than this girl.  <br>Fuck yeah</br>  <br>I do support her, but I'm unsure whether Shu will choose her or Tailred.</br>  This show is fun.  <br> I do support her, but I'm unsure whether Shu will choose her or Kanade. <br>FTFY.</br></br>  Kanade is better  Who is the one on the window?  <br>I hope she becomes a superhero</br>  <br>Looks more like phantom thief to me</br>  <br>I hope she becomes a superthief, then</br>  <br>She dresses so well.</br>  <br>Chuuni?</br>  <br>Whenever I see her, my dick flies up to kingdom cum</br>  <br>I more think it as a case of spoiler.</br>  <br> Red  grasper </br>    <br> A-Are you hurt..? <br>I want to feign injury so she can lick my "wounds".</br></br>  My heart.  <br>Why not all including Kanade, Aoi, Shiori, Misaki,  and the boys ?</br>  <br>Akane is really endearing, but that lack of tits though.</br>  KINTPATSU<br>I<br>N<br>P<br>A<br>T<br>S<br>U</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying implications </br>  <br>Shinobu, fuck off.</br>  <br>It's okay, Akane has these instead.</br>  <br>This is my fetish.</br>  <br> Nah </br>      <br>Megane + twintails is the strongest combination.</br>  <br> 10 years old </br>  <br> those slight bulges <br><br>Diamonds.</br></br></br>    <br>So goddam cute. Romance of the season</br>  <br>Isn't it great?</br>  <br>Oh, it is.<br>She could be anything I wanted.<br>A teenager, a christmas cake, a loli, an even younger loli or  a boy .</br></br></br>  Tail red is the cutest.    <br>She could shrink you and have you engage in /ss/ with her.</br>  Who would you give your vote to?  <br>Or she could turn me into a woman and then turn herself into a shota.</br>  <br>So close</br>  <br>Fuck you. Kanade or death.</br>  <br>Or she could turn me into a loli and then turn herself into a faceless fat guy.</br>  <br>Akane</br>  <br> She could be anything I wanted. <br>Not necessarily. Her powers affects the growth of an organism, so I don't think she can change species or biological sex.</br></br>  <br>I'd try an convince Hikari to turn me into a little girl whenever I wanted in exchange for my vote.</br>  <br>9</br>  <br> 4 6 and 7 </br>  <br> I'd try an convince Hikari to turn me into a little girl <br>This is it.

Is Kana supposed to be in love with Shu or something?  <br>There's something weird with them.</br>  Damn she's delicious.  Think they gonna get Nobunaga Shimazaki to voiced this guy?  <br> meido outfit <br>My dick.</br></br>  <br>She injured his leg when they were 4 trying to impress Akane. She's also mad jelly about Satou.</br>  <br> when they were 4 trying to impress Akane <br>More like "when she was jelly about Akane liking Shuu more and wanted to impress Akane."</br></br>  <br>This artist is so damn good at making delicious girls.

But her power won't disappear.</br>  Hikari got stuck with the most useless power, really.<br><br>Being applicable only once every 24 hours and needing to wait for the first effect to wear off before re-applying it really limits its uses. You can't even make yourself immortal since you regress to your original age ever 24 hours, however briefly. <br><br>What else is it good for? She can't even prevent deforesting on a large scale by rapidly growing tree farms since she's required to touch the trees herself (and what happens to the processed wood after the 24 hour transformation expires? Does it just go poof?). It's use as a disguise rapidly diminishes after everyone becomes familiar with her appearance at all ages.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her powers are made to write doujins.</br>  <br>Her power is the reason she is best girl, you pleb</br>  <br>Will this even get any worth looking at?</br>  <br>But Misaki's powers are even better for doujins.</br>  <br>Not for loli doujins.</br>  <br>Kanade's probably the only one who'd have a balanced budget and not make a ton of well-meaning mistakes, so her.</br>  <br> Akame <br> flat </br></br>  <br> Maybe I'm retarded <br>Let's call it severe ADHD.</br></br>  <br>I should just put the keyboard away for today</br>  <br>Why did they cut this panel?</br>  So why is the show called Castle Town Dandelion/Dandelion of the Castle Town?<br><br>Is the dandelion Akane?<br>Or does it symbolise everyone's wishes?</br></br></br>  <br> Is the dandelion Akane? <br>Yes--please re-watch the end of ep 1.</br></br>  <br> Kanade's probably the only one who'd have a balanced budget and not make a ton of well-meaning mistakes, so her. <br>She'd blow the entirety of the nation's budget on fixing Shu's leg the moment she could.<br>Aoi's the better choice.</br></br></br>  <br>Aoi has no drive to become the king. She most likely will do nothing special and just let a bunch of advisors run the country.</br>  <br>Actually I'm interested why is this, especially why she hides her geass from public view.</br>   9 siblings <br>How much do you think the parents fuck</br>  <br>People would probably get upset if they knew she could make them do anything.</br>  <br> No one likes Shu <br>He's the only one I'm rooting for. Besides Kanade, he's the only one with a sense of money, but he's also honorable, and doesn't drag others down with him.<br><br>Plus, teleportation is OP as shit. If I wanted a king with super powers, I'd want him to be able to fuck up all other contenders. Really, no one could even battle him. The closest contender is Teru, and then Akane.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Hikari could just turn all her siblings into babies and do whatever she wanted with them.</br>  <br>Shu would be a good king.<br><br><br> couldn't even negotiate with a single dog <br> violence is needed to enforce law <br>Never, ever.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kanade or Akane or death.</br>  <br>Not before Shu nothing personnel's her. The only thing holding him back is him being a good person. That's pretty much all of their flaws, though.<br><br>Teru could pitch a stone and kill everyone else before their powers went off, too. Aoi and worstboy are out for the count. Akane's ability could make her a threat against everyone but Shu. The other 2 don't really have a shot either.<br><br>Battle royale spinoff series when?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>D-Does Akane like Shu too?</br>  <br>She kinda is an idiot so it took her some time to sink in </br>  <br>As far as the immortality goes, if she regresses back to the age she was when she applied it, then she'd only age for a minute or so for every 24 hours lived, so whilst no immortality, pretty damn close.</br>  <br>Isn't that Orin with glasses?</br>  <br>You mean something like Chaos Dragon? Where you take a series and put the edge up to eleven? Personally while i would like some fighting i dont think we will go full on war between them. I dont want to destroy this cozy feel</br>  <br>In terms of being a king, I'd argue that Shu and Aoi are the best choices. Aoi also seems to have a sense of money, honor, and all the good qualities Shu has plus charisma and popularity.<br><br>Also, when it comes to battle, Aoi can fuck Shu up because she can just  order him to do whatever she wants.  Too bad the two of them support Akane.</br></br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br> File not found </br>  <br>Why is she the worst character in this series? <br>Her appearance brings forward unnecessary shit which takes away from fun family shenanigans. Fucking cock starved sluts always destroy everything.</br></br>  <br> Why is she the worst character in this series? <br>Because she's generic clumsy girl with a crush.</br></br>  <br>Except she did win.</br>  <br>Hair isn't fluffy enough</br>  <br>It's okay anon, I'm sure a kind anon will upload the image somewhere.</br>  <br>Sensation, he makes a line about it in another scene</br>  I just want to have lots of sex.  <br>Literally this<br>Am I supposed to care for her becasue she's in a constant blushing mod and the Shu's dick is all she has on her mind?<br>Worst girl</br></br></br>  <br>With who?</br>  <br>With all of the siblings and even the mom and the dad.</br>  <br>You're an anon of good taste, the designs of this are so good that it's hard to think of someone that I wouldn't fuck.</br>  <br>Except this girl actually confessed unlike that cumguzzling nisekoi slut.</br>  I'm going to vote for Misaki.  <br> unlike that cumguzzling nisekoi slut <br>It's not her fault he was asleep at that moment.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128301293 <br>The links are ded anyway.</br>  <br>But she's an incestfag.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  If a girl becomes the King, Does that mean her husband will be the Queen?    <br> Yes  I want to be Akane's queen! </br>  <br>Get in the line.</br>    <br>Holy shit I just realize that Hikari wears her outfit this ep.</br>  <br>Idol wars woo</br>  So why is Shu against Kanade becoming King again?  <br>Kanade might use the national budget to restore his disabled legs, which she was the one who caused it.</br>  <br> She'll spend all the kingdoms money to fix his dodgy leg </br>  <br>One of her sisters will be the queen.<br>Or she marries a trap.</br></br>  <br>Why are idols so gay?</br>  <br>My dick will for sure.</br>  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/a/1437134244671.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/a/1437134244671.j<wbr>pg</wbr></a><br> no shiori adult from <br>WHY</br></br>    <br>Kanade looks like her Mother in this koma</br>  <br>Borscht will kick the shit out of you</br>  So are these siblings incestuous or not.  <br>Full version of that image, seeing as people like posting it so much</br>    <br>dat titty monster.

He'll be the greatest king ever.</br>  <br>She's killing everyone with her mass destruction cuteness.</br>    <br>So reliable.</br>  <br>So was Kanade just jealous that Akane was playing with Shuu in the first page?</br>  <br>Seems like she wanted to get out of the house and bring Akane with her. All three of them could have been playing together.</br>  <br>Well it just seems like Kanade is jealous of Akane giving attention to Shuu, especially in the other pages.</br>  <br> your imouto will never be super impressed that you can perform simple tasks <br><br>Why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>She seems to be into little kids in general.</br>  <br>All three of them were preteens then, and I guess Akane was probably at Shiori's age. It'd be natural for her to be impressed by a ramen.</br>  <br>You'll have to excuse the lack of redraws, not feeling up to snuff right now.</br>  <br>I guess something happened to make her more responsible with her power. Probably has to do with Shu's bum leg.</br>  <br> a castle for just the two of us </br>    <br>Is that all?<br><br>Good work nonetheless</br></br></br>  <br>Nice blog</br>  <br>I think you might be stupid.</br>  Akane, Shu, and Akari just need to fuck  What's EVO?  <br><br>Fighting game tournament</br></br>  <br>The biggest fighting game tournament.

Shu doesn't want her to dedicate her life for that purpose. </br>  <br>Bankrupt the country to produce nanomachines to fix his bum leg and maybe this.</br>  <br>She really is an NTR material. Maybe because of the pink hair</br>  <br>Because despite it being a childhood accident and Shuu's assurances that he doesn't blame her, Kanade still feels responsible and wants to fix his House-tier bum leg.</br>  <br> his House-tier bum leg <br>I think Shuu's not as worse. I don't think he's on opioids, for one thing.</br></br>  <br>What if Shu is impotent?</br>  <br><br><br><br>What a troublesome imouto. Shuu must be a saint.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Important? That he already is.</br>  Kanade a shit.<br>Worst imouto.<br>Worst nee-san.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off Kanade a best.</br>  <br>I'm sorry I can't hear you over the sound of Shu being crushed by rubble.</br>  <br> Any Dandelions <br> shit <br><br>You, me, playground in 10 minutes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>kid kanade a cute</br>  Why are the pink twins so irrelevant?  <br>Hikari needs to get around to lolifying Kanade someday.</br>   KAIMONO   <br>Even if she does that she won't have that need to impress other people anymore. Though it'd be funny to see her now as a kid.</br>  <br>Who is Akari?</br>  <br>Too busy fucking each other.</br>  <br>Even the loli and the shota feel like they get more screen time then them.</br>  <br>planning the yosuga no sora end.</br>  Ah I want Onii-sama to pump me full of his kindness.  <br>That's true Dandelions are all really great.</br>  <br>Some Dandelions are greater than other Dandelions though.</br>  <br>I don't think that anyone's disputing that.</br>  <br>Yeah like Kanade, Shuu and Akane</br>  <br>Aoi still a best though.<br>Citizens have good taste.</br></br>  <br>Aoi is best but she doesn't want to be King.</br>  Im not quite sure where i am right now, but it scares me  JUST  DO  ANAL   Hey anon, move your sorry ass and buy my lunch.

Sundays <br><br>It's almost a year now</br></br>      <br>B-but it was so  good. </br>  It was too good for us  s2 when?  One of the few really enjoyable anime I've seen in the past few years.  <br>Maya is so best.</br>  the narrator alone made it worth watching  Urara is loved and missed.  I think I missed some OVAs or something  Auuughhh I need a season 2, but I don't think it was successful enough in Japan for any more.<br><br>I watched this back-to-back with Watamote and started to enjoy anime like I hadn't probably since before high school  15 years ago ;-; </br></br>  <br>I don't fucking remember this at all.</br>  mfw season 2 never and manga cancelled from show doing shit.  Checked out the airsoft related show from this season. It's not particularly good or too funny but between the hotblooded MC and this dense fucker it has its moments.  <br>if the manga gets canceled it'd be because the manga is doing shit</br>  <br> all the girls have short hair <br>Is this some sort of fetish hybrid anime</br></br>  <br>I think it's still going on, but there's no one scanlating it right now.<br><br>Uh, anon, there's only one girl in that picture.</br></br></br>  <br>duuuuude what</br>      <br>She's in heaven now.</br>  <br>Subs literally never</br>  <br>Not proper subs but anon subs yes.</br>  <br>There are.

I just checked the files exported from PS in a hex editor.<br>Both png and jpg have some metadata in the header that identifies PS as being the writing software. This is nothing strange.<br><br>Outside of that, I couldn't find anything that would identify the individual PS license.

Plus, it would be a huge privacy issue.<br><br>Maybe psd files have some identifying metadata stored, but exported png or jpg files are most likely safe.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How the fuck did he have time to write all that  That's nothing for the strongest man in the world.

Sadly I doubt I can properly translate it to english to share with you guys.</br>  <br> Tail up your ass <br><br>Dude that's like getting fucked by a black cock, I preffer the tongue or at least a finger.</br></br></br>  <br>whats your native language, anon? maybe some here can do that for you</br>  <br> I wouldn't ask Miia to sully her beautiful tongue by sticking it somewhere that filthy <br>Why not? It can't possibly taste worse than her food.</br></br>  I can never decide if I like Miia or Rachnee more  <br>Why would I care for a Jelly pot? I can buy one on the 23 hours store and put my dick into that, is the same as fucking suu.</br>  Okay, real talk, do you think he'll stop at 7 girls? Or is he gonna pump the gas in the next couple chapters and shit out another waifu?  So, how come you guys manage to go from the chap. 35 of monmusu to enema, prostate and tail up the ass, what the hell  <br>a jelly pot is not reactive to what you're doing like Suu is,</br>  <br> Also the orgasm coming from that is fucking glorious. <br><br>this<br><br>just jacking off normally with some prostate stimulation is already miles better than just doing it normally<br><br>i've only been able to get off purely on prostate stimulation once, but it's the best thing i've ever felt, it was insane</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Being this newfag <br><br>Where do you think you are?</br></br></br>  <br>Go on</br>  <br>At least the jelly pot will not digest your dick</br>  <br>just because this manga appeals to /d/ taste doesn't mean we should turn it into /d/</br>  <br>I tried doing the prostate thing <br>never worked for me</br></br>  <br>but if she used her tail, she could enjoy it too<br>and you guys could have normal sex AND be kissing at the same time<br><br>your whole body could be in pure bliss in Miia embrace</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> All this talk about enema and prostate is going strange places <br><br> why don't we return to talking about cute monster girls? Like best girl Suu, for example <br><br>The irony in that statement is that Suu is probably by FAR the single best girl for both Enema-play and Prostate-play.<br><br>Seriously, there's no way a liquid-goddess like her couldn't find a way to send you to Heaven from inside your own body.<br><br> She'd probably be into S&amp;M force-feeding as well, which is a pretty underrated fetish. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought /d/ was just dickgirls and diapers</br>  <br>It's been like this since the MM threads started.</br>  <br><br> this scene in the anime <br><br>G.M.

They are two of the best girls, and easily the best for Femdom lovers.<br><br>Personally, I prefer Miia due to her utterly loving and dedicated personality and her better ability for epic cuddling.

I think Rachnee is rubbing off on her.</br>  <br>If she could go to class or two she could get better, but she's shackled to her man like some Arabian peninsula shithole.</br>  What's darling name again? Don't check, just post. Do you remember it?  <br>For years it's been that way. From Pathfinder and D&amp;D.</br>  <br><br>Actually they look more like autistic imp</br></br>  <br>but I liked to cook, that has made kurusu a relateble character for me actually.</br>  <br>I've never bothered learning his name because darling is just better <br><br>plus i'm really bad at remembering nip names</br></br></br>  <br> Not By The Dong's Early Light <br>C'mon, Anon.</br></br>  <br>See</br>  So wait, if a human has a baby with a monster girl would that kid be half monster?<br>Would they still retain monster physiology the more the monster blood is diluted?</br>  <br>Kurusu something.<br><br>Only know because it reminded me of Kurisu and I found it weird</br></br></br>  <br>No, but your Harpy daughters will forget you.</br>  <br>It fully takes the mother's race I think</br>  <br>That'd be disrespectful.</br>  I can tell how this isn't as generic as other harems by how the girls are referred to by their names rather than their hair colors.  <br>Have to admit that this looks cute.<br><br>Kimihito Kurusu<br><br>Mostly monster.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>have you not read the manga?<br><br>monster DNA takes over completely</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on the species.

What if I need something in that hour</br></br>  <br>So its like Pokemon</br>  <br>in the databook</br>  <br>To be fair though, their names are based on the names of their respective species, which is pretty much the equivalent of hair colors for naming monster girls.</br>  <br>Harpies.</br>  <br><br>If memory serves, the child inherits the race of the mother like she's some kind of fucking pokemon.</br></br>  Last one archived before I could answer the guy asking about Smith in the game. She shows up whenever you break the law. No leaving them alone, or funny lovey dovey stuff with the girls.  <br>well it would have to since some species are %100 women <br><br>if they gave birth to half monsters they would stop being nearly as monstrous really fast</br></br></br>  <br>That sure looks like rachnee has human leg and is just possibly mid stride. Looks rather odd.</br>  <br>for some reason I think they're more like Kikimoras than Harpies</br>  <br><br>Anyone find it very sweet how Rachnee's bondage play with Darling isn't anywhere near as bad as what she does to the monster-girls? Looking at this page compared to others could make you think she genuinely cares for him.<br><br> What if the BDSM is really just that? Something she does because it puts up a front, but the closer she gets to someone the more she's willing to go for something more "traditional." </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not calling her by the name<br> Kuroko Sumisu </br></br>  <br>well Kikimoras are just a subspecies of harpy</br>  <br>Random question. What font is that? Seems like a good crazy girl font.</br>  <br><br>Well yeah, she's just a little more reserved than the other girls until she gets some quality time with her honey. Also she goes full fucking dere when you get some coffee in her.</br></br>  <br>Reminder Miia is only dedicated to her own quest for dick.</br>  <br>And sometimes when you choose a 10 points answer, a MON member appears</br>  <br>I thought it was pretty clear it was just a front by how she acted when she was drunk</br>  <br>with candles. Can't forget the candle</br>  <br> Dat chuuni <br>I'd choose Lala</br></br>  <br>They call themselves Avian, which means any combination of bird and human features.</br>  <br>I am having a hard time deciding between horse pussy and spider eggs. Two fetishes are warring in my brain.<br><br>Sadness. I-I... fuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>When she was drunk she just got all cute and cuddly, that doesn't necessarily mean she's still not into bondage.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She willingly shrugged off the law too, he would have been gigafucked right then and there both figuratively and literally. Raped by snake women, and then thrown in jail for fuck knows how long, what a way to go.</br></br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <br><br> Insert spider eggs into horse pussy and fuck the horse pussy, impregnating both. </br></br>  I watched both seasons of Spice and Wolf and absolutely loved it and I would like to continue reading the manga as well as the light novel, although I have a question: <br><br>Where does the anime leave off in terms of what volume of manga? I keep hearing either volume 5 or volume 6; is this where it ends or where the manga continues on afterwards? Would I start on 5 or 6? I understand the series skips volume 4 and that the light novel is better but I'll pick both up at a later time.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128319820 <br><br>Since when did Spice and Wolf attract le ironic shitposting? I thought people liked this series.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128320064 <br><br>What?</br></br>    <br><br> Liking S&amp;W means you're summershit <br><br>Fuck off, faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128319820 <br>you didn´t read the light novels..</br>  <br>see<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128320064 </br></br>  <br><br>That post doesn't make any sense though. Are you saying that guy is lebbit?</br></br>  <br>meant this guy v<br><br><br>I for one like spice and wolf, and can't wait until next month for volume 15</br></br></br></br>  I only have manga scans through volume 6 and it's up through S1. If you were going to the books then the anime ends after volume 5 (but you should start from the beginning if you're reading the novels at all). Couldn't tell you where the manga gets to "new" material, but I'd assume volume 10 or so.  <br><br>Thanks a ton mate. Just the answer I was looking for. I definitely plan on revisiting the books and light novels when I catch up on the manga. <br><br><br><br>Hype in between releases is painful.

They are a fun and EASY read.</br></br></br></br></br>  Avoided watching this for a long while.

People sure have become jaded around the years....Season 3 when, and why don´t we have it?</br>  <br>They couldn't even if they wanted to. They skipped book four and it'd be awkward to go back to it now, especially since it set up Lawrence/Holo's motivations for the last arc in the anime.</br>  <br><br> Implying she meant that literally  <br><br>I bet you think that when a girl tells you she just wants to be friends it's because she doesn't like you.

No. She straight up says that she's already come to terms with outliving him. Her fear was what a lot of people have before getting married - the flame will eventually die, and all they'll be left with is happy memories.

Congrats.<br><br>No point in keeping this dialogue alive but I sincerely hope that you would change your ineffective methods in future, positive changes requies a lot of efforts, not time, try to understand it. Bye.</br></br></br></br>  <br> <br>Reminder. It's just colors so it's not a delivery. Hope you like it!<br><br>Also I might need some help identifying the last husbandos during the week, maybe tomorrow. For now here's Shichika and L-Elf.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Requesting a drawfriend try to give a Bankai for Senna please. Usually with Shikai the sword changes in appearance but some don't. And with Bankai the sword could change again or not all all, the user could get a costume change or not, and the power is sometimes the same as the Shikai but may be different but keeping the same concept (I.E Making ice to making more and stronger ice, having a small 2HK weapon to a massive 1HK missile, or freezing opponents to controlling temperature and freezing yourself to absolute zero and being able to move.) They also get a newish name (Zangetsu - Tesna Zangetsu, Sode no Shirayuki - Hakka no Togame, Ryujin Jakka - Zanka no Tachi) but naming Mirokumaru for Bankai isn't necessary.<br><br>Examples of Shikai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=km4<wbr>R8J_CqoU</wbr>  [ ] Senna's is at 8:30<br>Examples of Bankai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4IU<wbr>khdqLeso</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>But anything else is welcomed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128325864 <br>You are silly.</br>  Accidentally quoted, fuck my tired ass.
