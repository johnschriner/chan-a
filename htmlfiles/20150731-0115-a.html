[ Has there been a more pure and innocent soul in the existence of anime?  I bet she pleasures herself with tentacles.  <br>I'd be fine with that, so long as she was doing it for the Tentacles sake</br>  I'd rather the qt shota to br honest  <br>only if you're shipping him with the cake Herbalist</br>  Shiragami a cute!  <br>I m-mean Shirayuki!</br>  Why do I like her so much?  <br>Cake herbalist has a childhood friend/fellow herbalist she'll end up with in an ideal world.</br>  Who /autism/ here? How do you keep track of the shows you are following?  There's this thing inside you called brain.  <br><br>fuck that</br></br>  Stop being a special snowflake/autistic and just use MAL.  Whiteboard.  <br> just use MAL. <br><br>i refuse</br></br></br>  <br>MAL is okay if you don't interact with the community.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br> using a spreadsheet is being a special snowflake/autistic  <br>4chan is an 18+ board. I suggest you come back in a few years.</br></br>   not meticulously recording dates   <br>I use notepad.</br>  I don't need a list to keep track of what I watch because I don't have the memory of a goldfish  <br>A simple list on what airs what day in notepad.</br>  I use Taiga  <br>I stopped paying attention to dates years ago. For example this year I only realised by birthday had past nearly two months after the day. Do you use the dates to help with cataloguing your archives or something?</br>  <br>I wish MAL implemented an airing date column for the lists.</br>  hummingbird.me  <br> For example this year I only realised by birthday had past nearly two months after the day </br>  <br>Like this?</br>  What do you mean keep track of?<br>Why would you forget something you watch weekly?</br>   Being an autist when you have free, easy to use, flexible programs and a gigantic updated database at your disposal. <br>Just fucking get Taiga and make a MAL</br>  <br>No, just for fun</br>  <br>I have a template list of the days of the week, and like that I keep track of when shows air. When shows stop airing, I just remove them from the day of the week they aired on. I have a different list to make sure I watch everything as well, by doing nearly exactly what you're doing with the crosses, but I do it in Notepad+<br><br><br>Of the 578 titles I have completed, only around 6 don't have a starting date, mainly because I have absolutely no clue when I started it, just that I finished it in a particular month, and two with neither dates for the pretty much same reason.</br></br></br></br>  I just use Anilist.  <br><br>Have you tried animecalendar? I just choose which shows im following and it updates to my calendar subsciption, its really neat.</br></br>  <br> For example this year I only realised by birthday had past nearly two months after the day </br>  <br>anilist.co</br>  <br>Since this is an /autism/ thread, I'm probably just going to stick with what I'm doing.</br>  I don't do anything like this but I liked seeing people's charts anyway.<br><br>Did you like Zeta Gundam? Are you going to watch ZZ? I loved ZZ but most people don't.<br><br>Why do you watch so many short series? Are you afraid of commitment or just prefer more concise and to-the-point storytelling at the probably cost of character development and world-building?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It was an anecdote to provide context for the statement. Stop trying to fit in.</br></br>  <br>I see you did that a long time ago</br>  <br><br>I dont understand what you mean by short? They are the usual seasonal length.</br></br>  <br>Could you project any harder?</br>  Dangerously close enough.     yfw you realize Kaido is Oda's way of making fun of people telling him to kill himself because they don't like his manga   <br><br>Fanart by etc. etc</br></br>  <br>So if weapons break on Big K then Moria might've tried to go for a cheap win by cutting big Ks shadow off only to have his scissors snap apart and slice himself up.</br>  Glad I didn't read the spoilers, this was a great wake-up this morning.  Holy shit, is this real? My dick is harder than stone. This is way better than anything I imagined.  <br>too much boobs</br>  Great chapter. Why is ther no talking about it here?  <br>There was already a huge thread when the issue came out hours ago. This is the late comer after party where everyone is asleep/at work.</br>   reveal Kaido <br> he wants to make a greatest war in a world <br><br>If that aint hype I dont know what is.<br>Also funny how Apoo and Basil are scared but Kidd only seems angry.</br></br></br></br>  So Kaido is a shitter who has only gotten to where he is by being a lucker dog.<br><br>DISGUSTING.</br></br>  So, I don't get it. Does he WANT to kill himself? Or does he just do it for fun because he knows he will live?  So… apparently the rest of the crew managed to escape, and the 3 eyed girl went with them??? Are they fighting Kaidos crew in Zou?<br><br>Why is Kaido going after the Kidd Alliance? Did Urouge become his ally?<br><br>Holy shit I have a lot of questions.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is Kaido going after the Kidd Alliance? <br>He doesn't. He just happened to fall next to them. Urouge just happened to meet him.</br></br>  <br> too much boobs </br>  So does this mean Kaido, the king of beasts, doesn't have a devil fruit?<br><br>Because jumping from there would be pretty stupid if he ended up falling in the water.</br></br>  <br>He was trying to commit suicide.</br>  So, since the guy who attacked Brook and Nami is a sheep man, it's probably save to say they are Kaido's men. (Plus there was an elephant, but an elephant fruit is alread in use.) Why are they searching for Kinemon? (Assuming that Kinemon is the samurai they talked about, who they assumed would be with the strawhats.)<br><br><br>He probably just jumped when he saw land. Or he tried to kill himself but was just "lucky".<br><br>Quick, what animals are said to be immortal/have multiple lifes?<br><br>Cats, obviously. Or snakes. But Kaido does not look really cat'ish to me. And snake zoans are already in use.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nemean lion</br>  Do you think Kaido goes on /fit/? I mean look at him.  <br>Stop posting this, the top one looks nothing like him aside from maybe hair, and the only similarities with the bottom is they have a left arm tattoo.</br>  <br> the only similarities with the bottom is they have a left arm tattoo <br>Are you implying that's not enough?</br></br>  <br>Yes, the tattoos don't even look similar. The Rock seems to have a tribal tattoo where Kaido seems to have a japanese tattoo.</br>  There has to be a reason for all of the yonkou to not go straight for the One Piece.<br><br>Shanks knows what it is, I guess, and doesn't want it.<br>Whitebeard knows it exists, but his goal in life was to have a family, not treasure.<br>Kaido just wants to an hero apparently?<br>Big Mom is only in it for the sweets.<br>And Blackbeard is still busy building his territory.<br><br>Come to think of it, the "One Piece" is getting less and less important the closer we get to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun. He realised he can't die by conventional or abnormal means and is just seeing how much he can survive.</br>  <br>Who cares about the drawing?<br><br>Left arm + left pectoral tattoos aren't common.</br></br></br>  <br>Aside from them not wanting it, I would say it's pretty near impossible to find the island without a fuckload of luck.</br>  <br> Also funny how Apoo and Basil are scared but Kidd only seems angry. <br><br>Fucker probably knows he's about to lose another limb fucking around with these damn Emperors.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why is he cursing after having survived the fall from the cloud? And the narrator said he searched a place to die. (The narrator in One Piece is usually reliable, isn't he?) Kaido also said something about Whitebeard having done it, so he should be able to do it aswell. (Though this is kinda weird, the translations are all very ambiguous.)<br><br>I think it is save to say he wants to commit suicide.</br></br></br>  <br> Left arm + left pectoral tattoos aren't common. <br>http://lmgtfy.com/?q=yakuza+arm+tat<wbr>too</wbr></br></br>  <br>I think Sakazuki has that aswell.</br>  <br>He does. A different pattern though of course.</br>  <br>so did whitebeard tell kaido to jump off a sky island 2 years ago and he did it?<br>the absolute madman</br></br>  <br>He's based on /fit/.</br>  <br>Meh, The Rock is also Hercules which is the strongest man just as Kaido.</br>  <br>It seems like Kaido wants to go the way of the Whitebeard and die.</br>  <br>WB's dead.</br>  <br>Kaido is the strongest creature, not the strongest man. Shirohige is the strongest man.</br>  <br>mirin</br>  <br>huehue</br>  <br> hage  is the strongest man.</br>  <br><br>Hydra<br>Byakko (we have Suzaku in Marco, arguably).<br>Chimaera</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which one is stronger ? Whitebeard or Kaidou ?</br>  <br>Kaido is both creature and man. And Whitebeard is also dead.</br>  Is Kaido's crew going to be like Doffy's with 1 really strong captain and then a bunch of jobbers.  <br>Whitebeard was stronger. Kaido is a shitter who has been captured by the marines 18 times.<br><br>Whitebeard would just need to lock him up and let him rot since he can't actually kill him due to lucker dog status.</br></br></br>  <br>hopefully not<br>i want alabasta/enies lobby fights back</br></br>  <br>Had a skin that couldn't be pierced. Not sure that's the same thing.</br>  <br>Whitebeard likely left that scar on his abdomen. It may be less that he wants to die and more that he's bored with being nearly invincible and few at sea can stand up to his might.<br><br>He's an unfulfilled thrillseeker.</br></br></br>  <br>this is what zyzz-worshippers actually believe.</br>  <br><br>Well if he really wants to kill himself all the time then it would be kind of a plot hole if he has a devils fruit, cause then he would just have to jump into the ocean to get the job done.</br></br>  <br>No, because we know it's needed to set up the final arc. It's becoming more and more important, what's becoming clear is someone special is needed to use it. Whitebeard knew what it was and knew Blackbeard wasn't the one who could use it so clearly not everyone can take advantage of whatever it is. Shanks knows what it is and has specifically been grooming Luffy to use it because he knows Luffy is the one Roger has been waiting for.</br>  <br>you can die by jumping into the ocean even if you don't have a devil fruit<br>just saying</br></br>  <br>He is a yonko. His crew will be strong, since it has to control territory.<br><br>Also, I am fucking glaf that Kaido doesn't have a goofy design. There is a little too much goof in One Piece character design ever since the time skip for my taste.</br></br></br>  <br>So he just needs to find a really large sauna?</br>  <br>whatever it is, it will cause luffy to destroy marejois and fishman island along with it, just like shirley predicted</br>  <br>His hobby being suicide isn't goofy?</br>  So does this chapter confirm that Kaido himself doesn't have a devil fruit?<br><br>If he did have one, couldn't he just throw himself into the sea?</br></br>  <br>Whitebeard is the unstoppable force and Kaido is the immovable object.<br><br>It's a fight without an end.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Fishman Island depends on the tree Eve, which grows straight to Marijoa.<br><br><br>It does not seem to be a hobby, it seems that he genuinely wants to die. And that is more tragic than goofy.<br><br><br>It'd be hillarious if he tried several times and each time landed on a seaking or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, an unstoppable force and an immovable object would just phase through each other.</br>  <br>What I was trying to say is that it should be easy for him to die if he has a devil fruit because of the way they work. So him being depressed because he can't kill himself wouldn't make much sense if he has eaten one.</br>  <br> It does not seem to be a hobby </br>  <br>It doesn't confirm anything. Kaido just amuses himself in finding ways to get killed, but his body keeps surviving and getting stronger. He probably doesn't want a boring death like eating 2 fruits/diving into the sea/ingesting Magellan's poison, etc.</br>  <br>I love you</br>  <br> Kaido is a devil fruit user <br> throw himself into the ocean <br> sink o the bottom <br> give no fucks and walk to the surface again </br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because Mangapanda is better that Mangastream doesn't mean it's 100% accurate.</br>  <br>GR8 B8 M8</br>  <br>Spears broke against Kaido's skin, so it is at least one of his superpowers.</br>  <br>I was browsing /a/ and sadly saw <br><br><br>It still had impact, but damn...</br></br></br></br>    <br>oh wow</br>  <br>Just some good ol' tekkai</br>  <br> Just because Mangapanda is better that Mangastream </br>  <br>I miss them too man maybe if Oda has the other strawhats do something meaningful other than fighting jobbers. Hopefully withfights that push them to their limits we might get some more meaningful development for them.</br>  <br>wow rude</br>  <br>Are you serious?!</br>  So was Kaido Ope Ope'd? Is that why he's seemingly immortal? Or is it something else?      <br>well maybe if dofla learned about ope ope from him it would make some sense<br> kaido confirmed for joining luffy-law aliance </br></br>  <br>Whatever happened, I'm glad it happened.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Is it me or is that speech bubble covering his eyes just like Doffy's?</br>  <br>Ask Kanjuro</br>  <br>thank god, his new design seems much cooler than the old silhouette.</br>  <br>where are the horns coming from?</br>  <br>Isn't that proto-Big Mom?</br>  <br> kaido blinded himself to be more vulnerable </br>  <br>nah big mom is the blue one</br>   Kaido's crew is looking for a samurai <br> Kaido's tattoo looks Japanese; his clothes look kind of Japanese <br>So I'm guessing there's a connection between Kaido and Zo. Maybe Kaidou was originally a samurai himself?</br></br>  <br>It's the same, faggot!</br>  <br>first is mankind and next is the rock</br>  Kaidou fucking sucks<br>"Captured by the navy and Yonko 18 times, tortured over one thousand"<br>All that hype for nothing, I bet he'll be outsmarted by Kidd team.</br></br>  <br>You do realise the original shichibukai silhouettes all looked like Mihawk right?</br>  <br>is anyone else reminded of oars with those horns</br>  <br>oh god I knew it.<br><br>It's been fun everyone</br></br></br>  <br> WHAT HAPPENED? <br><br>2 years timeskip</br></br></br>  Doesn't really look like a monkey to me. <br>Guess Sun Wukong is off the table.</br>   really wanted a Supernova war <br> each supernova picking a side between Kid and Luffy <br> they're all headed for Wano and will probably team up like a bunch of faggots </br></br>  <br>Squats and oats.</br>  <br> anime silhouette <br> canon <br><br>Do you even try?</br></br></br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1552<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1551 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting Sylphy lifting Salama’s dress so its bottom is at her ribs, lustfully licking her navel as saliva dribbles down Salama’s cheek in ecstasy.<br> The cycle must be completed. </br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.

Yep yep.  <br>Deliver on some of the non lewd requests or fuck off.</br>  <br>I only apologize because I know some people don't like hearing them even if they know its good for them.

Also thank you.</br>  <br>zzz</br>  <br> i think that was also me</br>    <br>Is it bad I couldn't tell? But I don't really request her often. But she's pretty great although some wouldn't agree. She's stronger than at least 1/5 of the rest of the gotei 13 and can create life. She only gets fat so she has enough energy to cook really great food that gives you a boost and and fight/use her powers and ends up looking like that on the left. Too bad Kubo killed her.</br>  <br>zzz</br>  <br><br>I like the composition in this one</br></br>  <br><br>Only have energy for one. I'll do the rest after I get some sleep.</br></br>  <br>left a layer on</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br> higher res ref would work miracles for me, anon </br>  <br><br><br>Nice. Its good to see fun requests drawn.</br></br></br>  <br>Care for some Cave Exploration?</br>  <br>Requesting Rukia exploring a cave</br>  <br> Don't worry, that faggot couldn't kill a fly, even if it fell into a fire after being swatted it would be alive before the arc ended or it would show up half way through the next one stronger then ever. </br>  Yukari Yakumo looking serious with D4C (will include in second post) floating behind her as a stand.  <br>D4C should be hovering over her like on the right side of the pic</br>  <br><br>hey newfriend please edit your pictures into one post next time</br></br>  <br>This was pretty fun, I'd love to do more.</br>  <br>I probably should have but I got lazy. I guess being called a newfag as a result is what I get.</br>  <br>I don't know anon, they look pretty dead. Only rape monk lived because of name shenanigans. Also they've done their intended purpose so I doubt they'll be coming back.</br>    <br>10/10 delivery</br>  <br>Nice!

FUCK OFF</br></br>      <br>?</br>  <br>I like how in anime they just say fuck it and separate the lip with empty space rather than draw in the cupid's bow.</br>  <br>It's evolving</br>  <br>some styles have done that, though.</br>  <br>Yeah but bigger, like she drew it on.</br>  <br>That's how abstraction works anon. You get rid of unnecessary detail and in anime they decided that a lot of the detail was. That's not them being lazy, that is literally the style.</br>  <br>uhh</br>  <br>Perfect</br>  <br>Boa, you're the best</br>  <br>I hate my sides now, thanks</br>  <br>Here you go, it was kind of difficult since she's so bland.</br>  <br>It's one of those details you mind can fill in so it's not much of a big deal.</br>  <br>Nice</br>  <br>Do Satsuki?</br>  <br>Thanks<br><br>Alright.</br></br></br>  <br>That's great, anon! Thank you very much!</br>  <br>I know it's against the "rules" but could you draw Nelliel as a Macaroon?

Expect another below-average chapter.</br>  <br>But what if it's really "woah" this time?</br>  <br>It's his job to hype the manga. Why are you still too dumb to get it?</br>  <br>He'd go "woah" if Eren pushed Armin down and fucked him the ass hard. Which frankly isn't much higher than a typical fanfic.</br>  I, for one, trust Editor-Kun's "woah"s.  <br>Because you are retarded and got nothing else but this manga.</br>  <br>True, I don't deny it. Someone has to have hope for this manga.</br>  <br>Damn I'll laugh if it's whoah. I'll laugh too if it isn't.</br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>Annie is everything  to me <br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>  スミスの太ももに挟まれてしにたい !  <br>her stripper name would be Crystal</br>  Which chapter was the "whoa" chapter again? Was it 59?  <br>Yes. The "whoah" part was supposed to be Armin killing that soldier. Too bad it was easily guessable.</br>  <br>There were also other chapters hyped by the editor, which turned out to be boring like the rest.</br>  <br> There were also other chapters hyped by the editor, <br>Which one?</br></br>  <br> according to his editor (Back-san) <br>Is Back-san Mr. woah?</br></br>  <br>yep</br>  <br>I don't trust his opinion. What do you think this chapter is about then? Connie gonna get into trouble while visiting mama titan, or political intrigue?</br>  <br>Connie monologizing about politics near his mom.<br><br>Hopefully BRY and MT</br></br></br>  <br> Hopefully BRY and MT <br>Not gonna happen no matter how hard people wish for it. Isayama baited us with their segment and he'll prolong the wait.</br></br>  <br> Hopefully BRY and MT <br>Haha I wish. BRY and MT aren't appearing anytime soon, give it at least 5 months.</br></br>  <br><br>The Y isn't even there any more, it's just BR.</br></br>  <br>If anything it would be just BR and MT.</br>  Take a shot every time a character says something about how they used to be / still are a terrible person or every time a character says they've finally learned to believe in themselves.  <br>It'll be another Keith chapter.</br>  <br>What would really be a "woah" moment? <br> Wall titans wake up and start walking <br> major character death <br> they get to the basement and there's absolutely nothing there <br> Reiner, Berthold and Monkey Trouble decide to attack <br> Annie escapes from crystal prison <br> Where the fuck is Ymir </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not much of a difference. If BRMT don't appear there's still no way we get their side of the answers, unless Ymir somehow appears and gives some insight herself, which I doubt. MT holds the most answers anyway, according to Isayama.</br></br>  <br>This could be applied to any shonen and you'd still be drunk after 5 pages.</br>  <br> Annie escapes from crystal prison <br> Where the fuck is Ymir <br>The only possible ones in that list.</br></br></br>  <br>Getting to the basement alone is woah enough. The last one isn't that woah but it would be better than the last chapter at least.</br>  <br>Maybe he is impressed by how boring it is.</br>  <br>They're the least possible actually.</br>   Last pages of the chapter <br> A crystal <br> Everyone is hyped to see Annie again <br> Ymir is inside <br> Still no trace of Annie. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Suffering.</br>  <br>Indirectly. He's impressed by Isayama's cash milking ability.</br>  <br> Last pages of new chapter <br> A crystal <br> there's no one in side <br> Where's Annie? </br></br></br></br>    I bet my ass that either Annie or Ymir make a reappearance in this chapter  <br> Last panel of the chapter is a zoom-in of a hole inside the crystal shaped like her nose </br>  <br> the other editor was impressed <br>the cute one?</br></br>  <br>Is this your first woah chapter?</br>  <br> Last page of chapter is a hole in the ground with Annie's huge nose poking out </br>  <br> 1944 <br>Oy vey</br></br>  <br>I thought the one who said "woah" wasn't the retarded editor, but cute editor-san.</br>  <br>Levi using the titan serum is also possible. But I doubt he'd use it that soon since they're still in the walls.</br>  <br>No, it's the retarded one.</br>  <br>There's no purpose. Eren can crystallize and there's no information Annie has that wouldn't be an irrelevant distraction from the direction things are heading right now. Ymir maybe could warn them about MT or something, but I don't think that's even slightly likely.</br>  <br>Annie would be an irrelevant distraction enough to postpone the basement trip again.</br>    The other day I saw a theory about MT not being related to BRA because he doesn't have the Semitic nose. Looking closely he resembles Grisha quite a bit.<br> small nose <br> exact same glasses <br> messy hair <br> facial hair <br> crazy scientist vibe </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Grisha was also from outside of the walls and obviously had no clue what was going on inside the walls.</br>  <br>MT is obviously from Grisha's family. An older brother or an uncle, maybe cousin. Could be his father since shifters don't age when they are in their titans, and MT seems use to being a titan.</br>  <br> since shifters don't age when they are in their titans <br>That's probably only when they are mindless, since their human body is pretty much gone. Also it looks like shifters age much faster every time they shift or use their ability or rather they get sick and die sooner.</br></br>  <br> MT is the big bad <br> Grisha is his son, escaped and lost memories <br> remembered his father <br> made Eren into the only thing that could stop MT <br><br>My bets are on this.<br>We will probably find out once they finally get to the god damn basement.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't kept up with this since the anime started airing, whats the story behind this page? MT BTFO Bert?</br>  <br>No Reiner was btfo.</br>  <br>I don't care about Ymir. I just want to see Annie again and more interactions between her and BR. A reappearance of MT with BR would be good too.</br>  <br>I want to see Annie interact with Armin and the rest. Armin is an intellectual so I don't think he wants to torture and kill her and BR. I'm not sure about Eren though. He feels he needs to kill BR but I wonder how he feels about Annie, he seemed sympathetic to her before.</br>  <br>Hanji is also smart, but she still tortured someone. Armin can also be pretty creepy sometimes.</br>  <br> Armin is an intellectual so I don't think he wants to torture and kill her and BR <br>I'm not that sure.</br></br>    <br> tfw no ymir </br>  <br>Nice girly eyelashes.</br>  <br><br>At the very least I don't he would do it for fun/revenge. He'd only resort to that to get information. Eren doesn't care about answers when he's angry.</br></br>  <br><br>Doubt MT is the big bad - Ymir almost spilled the beans on who the big bad was, but BR stopped her before she could say it, and they were just talking about MT before that. my guess is that the big bad is either going to be the first king or some other faction BRA/MT are at war with and need the coordinate to defeat.</br></br>  <br>BRA interaction is what I want to see most in this series right now. I hope Isayama doesn't leave it out.<br><br><br>Don't want this at all, nor do I agree with the idea that Armin wouldn't do whatever he must to have humanity come out victorious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>BR stopped her exactly because their faction is the big bad. And who's their leader? MT.</br>  <br>Some people still assume she was about to say warriors. Especially in other languages it looks like she was about to say that. Would also explains why Reiner interrupted her.</br>  When did MT vs AT happen? Just after reaching Shiganshina? Or exactly at the end of chapter 70, when Eren went to see Keith?<br><br>Since bertolt and Reiner didn't have a beard, I guess it was the day they reached shiganshina. That would mean they stayed in Shiganshina for at least 2 months since MT wants to wait for Eren. I really hope they have a beard now. Ymir included.</br></br>  <br>BR are probably still too young to grow a beard or they simply won't have one.</br>  <br><br>I don't understand how MT can be the leader of the faction if BRA's returning to their hometown was based on finding him - as Ymir says "if you find him, you can go home". He doesn't seem like he was somehow lost and they were on a mission to take him back home.</br></br>  <br>They're all old enough for it, and should be pumped full of the hormones for it, it's just that Isayama can't into puberty.</br>  <br> BR are probably still too young to grow a beard <br>They are 16-17. A normal teenager has a fuzz when he's 14, and a young beard when they are 17. Especially if they are european.</br></br>  <br>Girl who knows nothing of male biology detected.</br>  <br><br> they get into the basement <br> Holographic message from Eren's father explaining how the previous civilizaion was a futuristic one and that the story takes place in Earth's far future </br></br></br>  <br> as Ymir says "if you find him, you can go home" <br>She probably meant that they could go back home after meeting up again.<br><br> He doesn't seem like he was somehow lost and they were on a mission to take him back home. <br>It was based on bringing the coordinate back home with them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They're 17 years old and Caucasian.<br><br>I was capable of growing a beard at 16.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I've personally thought will happen for a long time. Just waiting on nanomachines to confirm all the psuedoscience bullshit Isayama put in.</br>  <br>Maybe they're just Asian</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure people used to reach puberty later in the past.</br>  <br>Or native American. Ber could pass for one.</br>  I don't know if I've ever seen a teenager have a full blown beard in an anime/manga. Actually, the only one that comes to mind is School Rumble but they made that into a joke.  <br> the story takes place in Earth's far future <br>Isn't that canon already?</br></br>  <br><br>My biggest fear is that there's some sort of bullshit twist like this that completely ruins the world-building. Kinda like how in BSG  it turns out that the "Earth" they were looking for was actually a prehistoric Earth and they just abandon their ships and all that bullshit that made no sense within the context of a futuristic sci-fi world. </br></br>  <br>Or maybe Isayama just doesn't care.</br>  <br>I meant the anon who didn't know how beards work</br>  <br>Does Bertolt and Reiner look like prepubescent boys?</br>  <br>What if the "Earth" is actually one huge titan.</br>  When yout think about it, there is not a single relevant male adult character who doesn't have facial hair. Except Erwin who shave regularly  <br>Levi and Moblit also don't have facial hair.</br>  <br>Levi</br>  <br>No, but the growth of facial hair is normally one of the last stages of male puberty.</br>    <br> more sitting Bert merch <br>Fucking finally the promo team caught up.</br></br>  <br> Moblit <br> relevant </br></br>  <br>Moblit is relevant because he's more popular than Sasha, Annie, Ymir and Historia.</br>  <br> popularity makes a character relevant </br>  If titans attack shifters, why do they listen to MT? <br>Do you think they attacked Annie when she led them against the Survey Corps expedition, or did they listen to her as well?</br>    <br>So Marco is relevant too? Since he's more popular than Moblit.</br>  <br>MT probably has a coordinate.</br>  <br>Yes, Marco is extremely relevant.</br>      <br>Remember when everyone though that Frieda was a female Eren?</br>  <br> Reiner <br>Kek. Not surprising they treat him like a joke again though.</br></br>    <br>He looks rather female with these eyes.</br>  <br>It's actually possible that it was female as a human</br>  <br>Or Eren is a Reiss theories in general.</br>  I wonder what Ymir's titan voice will sound like in the anime.  <br>Males can have prominent eyelashes.</br>  <br>I know, but maybe not in this manga.</br>  <br>Eren kind of does at least on volume 15 cover.</br>  <br>It's a very pretty titan. I'd fuck his boypussy, no homo</br>  <br>Is this Jean reading porn before his mum comes in?</br>  <br>my eyelashes are longer then most grills. It's an important factor in perfecting your trap body.</br>  <br>I wonder what MT will sound like.</br>  <br>Eren is female.</br>  <br>It's an extreme and very detailed close up of his face. The again, at this point even canon was explicit about him looking a lot like Carla. Maybe he is somewhat feminine looking in-universe.</br>  <br><br> no YH or SC </br></br>  <br>He has soft features and big eyes. He is kind of effeminate.</br>  What's her role in this story going to be?<br><br>Ultimately just a support character for Allen?</br></br>  <br>That's pretty much what Isayama said in the Brutus magazine.</br>  <br>Nice scans when</br>  <br>I feel like those are starting to be BRA's signature merchandise poses: fighting, sitting, and ass.</br>  <br>Reminds me of when he was drawing his ideal waifu in the ovas.</br>  <br>Like Caesar in Planet of the Apes</br>  New promo illustration for the SnK exposition  <br> Levi's cape blocking Annie's ass  <br>Damn it</br></br>      <br>Annie seems so out of place in this</br>  <br>I'm okay with this.</br>  <br>I want him to sound like the french dub of Sauron's Mouth<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?featu<wbr>re=player_detailpage&amp;v=VI-9QeDAOJw#<wbr>t=95</wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>They needed a female the anime watchers would recognize to balance things out. Sasha would look even more out of place.</br>  <br> Annie in the promo art <br>She's coming back guys. She'll come back in this arc.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128795129 <br>I couldn't care less about Ymir coming back, but Annie has been away for way too long. ;_;</br>  <br>And should hopefully be gone longer unless you want her to suffer</br>  <br>Don't forget that the second recap movie came out last month.</br>  I have mailed two questions out to BSM. They are "Does any of the 104th shave?" and "What are the popular food/drinks in the walls?" If, and this is a big if, any of them make it, it will probably appear in the October issue based on past experience, so don't hold your breath.<br><br>In addition, I will be heading to the SnK expo in Oita on the first day. Editor says he and Isayama will be there so I guess my pockets will be full of spaghetti to be spilled.<br>In other great, almost unbelievable news, I have been selected to go to the Magazine Gakuen event on August 8, where a bunch of mangakas, including Isayama, will be there. I don't know if it's really okay for a filthy gaijin like me to go, but I might as well if I can. There's not much details about the event, so I can't collect any questions to ask them at the moment as I don't know if there'll even be a Q&amp;A session. Anyway, to say I'm hyped is an understatement.</br></br></br>  <br>Well we also know where she is, which makes her coming back a little less interesting.</br>    <br>That's pretty cool anon. Do you live in Japan or just visiting? How did you get invited to go to the event?</br>  <br> "Does any of the 104th shave?" <br>Holy shit I wanted to ask you if you could send this question due to this thread. Coincidence?<br><br>Will you have the possibility to ask questions to Isayama during the exposition or the event? If yes do you already have questions?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nevermind the question part I didn't read you whole post.</br></br>  <br>Damn, good luck anon, and have fun. There were some other questions posted in the other place if you're interested for the next bunch of Q&amp;A.</br>  I almost forgot that we're also getting the first chapter of worst girls.  <br>Oh</br>    <br>D-did we get to see Annie smile in the end?</br>  <br> Worst girls <br>Kek.

I understand it why people don't like it, but why they say it's bad, I honestly don't know.</br>   Waiting for something interesting to happen in Vol 5.   Chuunis and Tamako Market are still the worst crap Kyoani ever produced but Hyouka is in strong 3rd. I don't actually know how I managed to finish this snorefest, guess I was waiting for something exciting to happen but it just got worse with each episode.  <br>Lots of people watched it expecting a "serious" mystery show and instead they got a coming of age story with mysteries serving as little more than plot devices.<br><br>There is also the shitposters and the edgy contrarian brigade</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br>Not getting what you were expecting isn't a reason to hate something.</br>  <br>The mysteries were pretty damn good regardless of that.</br>  Mediocre but still one of the best Kyoani.  <br>Welcome to /a/</br>  Hyouka is probably the best thing KyoAni has ever done. S2 never.  <br>My heart, anon. ;___;</br>  <br> WHY WAS THERE NO AKSHUN IN A SOL FOCUSED ON CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, FUCKING SNOREFEST </br>  <br>I blame Yonezawa.</br>  I think it would be a lot of fun to see KyoAni make a serious mystery anime.  <br> chitanda ass </br>  <br>God I hate characters like Chitanda<br> she's a special snowflake because she's an autistic retard with good grades </br></br>  <br> Oreki checking out Chintanda booty </br>  <br> but why they say it's bad <br>It's not good either and if you say it's one of the best that's false as well. You're just too delusional because you really enjoy SoL or you're a KyoAni fag. There are many problems with Hyouka. I would make a list but it's not really worth the time. However, if you really would like to understand why there are people who say it's bad, just analyse the show. You'll find the plot and subplot weren't really convincing and the development was lacking. The pace was bad overall. It wasn't a bad show but definitely not the "masterpiece" some retards here like to spam everywhere.</br></br>  <br>He checked it out way more obviously earlier that episode.</br>    <br>Its just really slow for a good part of the show, even for Kyoani, then it pulls out the sudden mystery solving and it becomes interesting again.</br>  <br> this is shit! seriously! <br> I can't prove a single point but it is! <br> So, take my word for it. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sEy<wbr>NMUeNokw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> then it pulls out the sudden mystery solving and it becomes interesting again <br>Oh look another one of these faggots</br></br>  <br> this greentext will show him to not mess up with my shitty cantonese cartoons! <br>Wow you sure showed me, fucking idiot :^)</br></br>  I can't really give objective reasons why Hyouka was mediocre. It's still up to this day one of the most pretty and well animated TV series. But while I enjoy a vast array of anime genres, I couldn't simply find something interesting in watching it. The mysteries "twists" felt completely ridiculous to me, and while I loved Hyouka in the first episodes because of the great MC and Chitanda, I quickly came to vview Hyouka for what it is: It is boring. It's objectively good, aside from the cheap mysteries that felt underwhelming, especially in the second half, but it is simply boring and I couldn't help but fall asleep on it every night until I completely lost interest. I don't even understand it myself because I generally enjoy every kind of anime if I can recognize that it has some important qualities. The only other time it ever happened was with Honey and Clover, but I think it's only because I couldn't relate at all to the themes and characters  <br>Tamako Market is redeemed by the movie, otherwise it's just 'ok'</br>  <br>Indeed, I did, faggot. Glad you admit.</br>  <br> I still have no arguments, so I'll just attack your use of greentext and call you an idiot </br>  <br> The mysteries "twists" felt completely ridiculous to me <br> aside from the cheap mysteries that felt underwhelming <br>Oh look it's another of these faggots</br></br></br>  <br> she's a special snowflake because she's a rich girl that didn't have to deal with retards like me. <br>FTFY.</br></br>  <br>I just didn't like the last 4 episodes</br>  <br/>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>The mysteries aren't cheap. They are well-built, well-planned and well-delivered. Sure, they don't carry any real consequences whether or not they are solved, but they still are good, even if they are not your kind of mystery.<br><br>Boring to you, maybe. You can say that's what Hyouka is, because to me, it's one of the most brilliant and substantive stories I've ever had the pleasure to follow.<br><br>To me, it looks like the only reason you had to not like Hyouka is because you couldn't relate to it.<br><br><br>Calm down. At least he's being respectful. Try to show him respect as well</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why?<br><br><br><br>Meant "You can't say that's"</br></br></br></br></br>   well its boring as fu.. <br> YOU JUST DUN GETTIT <br>Oh shit didn't know I was watching Jean-Luc Godard directed anime, all these deep themes of growing up went straight over my head.</br></br>  <br>I never said I was expecting mysteries.<br>I just thought Chitanda was cute.<br>3/4ths of every episode tended to drag on a lot but it would catch my attention again once Oreki started going Gary Stu on them mysteries.<br>The last episode was good though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Not him, but the last eps felt rather underwhelming and anticlimatic after the festival arc, which is arguably the highest point in the series</br>  <br> Why? <br>It felt like the anime just kept going even though it had no point left to prove. And the weird romance made me dislike the characters.</br></br>  Damn.<br>I'm gonna watch this says.</br>  <br>I didn't feel them as such. Felt like a good slowdown from the festival.</br>  I've read the first novel, and it seems that they dumbed Chitanda down quite a bit for the anime. Which is a shame, really.  <br>That's because those last episodes are the final chapters of the 4th volume, where Yonezawa sets things up for his 5th volume. KyoAni didn't do the set up for obvious reasons, but they still were good episodes, if nothing else, for the conclusions of the main 4 characters relationships. Chitanda and Oreki getting closer and closer, Mayaka warming up to Oreki, Satoshi not being a faggot anymore and owning up to his feelings for Mayaka, etc...<br><br>What weird romance?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but as  said they just felt tacked-on and went nowhere, mainly because it's an ongoing series of novels.<br><br><br>Did anyone translate the novels?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's absolutely shit.</br>  <br> http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/?<wbr>title=Hyouka</wbr> </br>  chitanda was just not a very interesting character, and because of that the whole ending sucked. and all of the mysteries in the second half were lame. the second cour was about half as good as the first cour. overall the show was like 6.5/10  <br>Wish Yonezawa would release volume 6 already! ;__;<br><br><br>Up to the 4th.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Satoshi being a faggot, Oreki and Chitanda getting stuck in a shed together for tension that ultimately doesn't matter later<br>I would have been more specific but I forgot the fucking names</br></br>  This show always put me in a good mood.  <br>might as well kill yourself</br>  <br> weird romance <br>I thought it was believable.</br></br>  <br>Thanks, haven't checked baka in a while</br>  <br>Satoshi stops being a faggot. That was the point of the whole thing.<br><br>But it does matter, ultimately. What are you talking about.</br></br></br>  Do you think Oreki is plowing Chitanda's fertile fields right this very moment?  <br> I can't into interpretation so I have everything that doesn't spoonfeed me. <br>Go fuck yourself.<br><br><br>Not quite, yet, but soon enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Weird. Why they skipped the last 3 chapters of vol 4?</br>  <br>Here's your reply, since you're that starved for attention.</br>  <br>Hopefully after the race.</br>  <br>This sums it up quite nicely. As far as a show goes, Hyouka is just mediocre.</br>  <br>Because BakaTsuki and their retarded first-come-first-serve translation exclusivity policies</br>  <br>Meaning?</br>  Hyouka movie in 2016, right?  <br> posting best girl </br>  <br>Lelouch, go away.</br>  <br>I  enjoyed  it.</br>  <br>Usually there are several translators working on different volumes, and once a translator grabs a series or a volume he can do whatever the fuck he want's with it (including hogging it) and no one can do anything about it, because muh unspoken rules</br>  <br> unspoken <br><br>So, there is no actual hard block to it?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Namely vol. 4 of Hyouka was picked by a different translator from the rest of the series, and unfortunately he's slow as fuck</br></br>  <br>You may cause some serious drama if the guy translating it comes and says you are stealing the project from him</br>  <br> drama <br><br>Like I give a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't retarded. You are, however.</br>  <br>Well, this cutie isn't gonna make herself.</br>  <br> The love for one of the best anime of the last 5 years hasn't gone down, has it? <br>No but the vocal minority has gotten more obnoxious</br></br>  <br>I'm not retarded. You are, however.</br>  <br><br>You're a mystery</br></br>  <br>It was good except for the unresolved sexual tension between Oreki and Chitanda.</br>  <br>When are Oreki and Chitanda going to start fucking like rabbits?</br>  <br>WHERE ARE YOU, GACHI-RANGERS?</br>  <br>But it was solved.</br>  <br>Not in the anime.<br> what did you say? <br> n-nothing </br></br></br>  What the fuck was this show even about? <br>22 episodes of things happening without any sense of direction. Doesn't even qualify as SoL shit as I doubt anyone found these retarded modern day mystery shenanigans relatable.</br>  <br><br>Damn. Forgot the pic.</br></br>  <br>Better than Madoka</br>  <br>autist</br>  <br>Oreki finding the motivation to take advantage of his talents is one of the main components of the narrative.</br>    <br>Hardly works as a theme since Kyoani puts "talented protagonist is too autistic to live his talents through" shit in almost all their show. More like a common trope designed to make self-insert characters more enjoyable for otaku shitters</br>  <br> Chitanda Oreki <br>I thought married couples in Japan still always chose the man's name even if the women is of higher status. Am I wrong?</br></br>  <br>No. Sometimes, when the wife is from higher status, they mostly leave up to the couple to choose, with a implicit motivation for the husband taking up the wife's family name. Also Chitanda Oreki sounds 10x better than Oreki Eru.</br>  <br> Yes <br><br>My fucking heart.</br></br></br>  <br> those skinny legs <br><br>Literal skeletons.</br></br></br>  <br> without any sense of direction <br>This is basically the problem in Hyouka.</br></br>  <br>Since everyone was calling it boring, I went into thinking it was a bunch of retards who didn't handle not being spoonfed.<br><br>I went into it expecting a substantive and thought-provoking show that didn't coddle its viewers, but I didn't get any of that. I got a genuinely boring show with nice animation and pretty art. <br><br>They were right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what other KyoAni show dedicates that much time towards it and handles it as seriously as it does in Hyouka other than Hibike.</br>  <br>Now that the reverse bait has been thrown, can the hater leave?</br>  <br>The entire plot of two seasons of Free?</br>  <br>Except that the whole point of the series was about Oreki developing from a lazy ass/insufferable edgelord to a functional human being with his own goals and motivations, and each arc/mystery helps developing him.</br>  <br>fair point, although Hyouka aired prior to it so I don't exactly see how it "cheapens" the theme at all.</br>  <br>Not him. Never watched Free. Likely never will.</br>  <br>Speaking of which...</br>  The first half of Hyouka is boring as fuck. I don't blame people who dropped it.<br><br>The second half is the best work Kyoani has ever done.</br></br>  <br> The first half of Hyouka is boring as fuck. I don't blame people who dropped it. <br>This is wrong.</br></br>  <br>Nope. Re-watched it last month and was shocked at how dull it was at times, and honestly struggled to make it to the OVA.<br><br>Fortunately, the last 12 episodes are great.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you think so?</br>  <br> The first half of Hyouka is boring as fuck. <br>I disagree.</br></br>  S2 fucking wHeN  <br>When the novel author gets off his ass and writes enough material</br>  <br>after more Accel World or  Spice and Wolf </br>  <br>The second half of Hyouka is inarguably better than the first one, but the tone of the show doesn't really change throughout the episodes, so I don't know why you would say it is boring.</br>  <br>A lot happens in the first half, but there's very little that grabbed my attention beyond the beautiful art/animation. Nobody can realistically go in to Hyouka and expect action - that's insane. But having entire episodes dedicated to sitting around and talking about inconsequential things doesn't excite, despite the character development. These episodes are absolutely necessary and well-done. Just a little dull to watch. <br><br>The movie arc also does nothing for me, but its only four episodes and Irisu is fun.<br><br>This is all personal taste, of course.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hyouka is one of the best seinen ever made. I'd put it up there with Mushishi and Monster<br><br>  I've never seen Hyouka </br></br>  <br>Normally, I would agree with you, but in Hyouka, it isn't just the still image of two people staring at each other talking. Prime example of this is that episode where Oreki solved why the student was called without anything to back him up, and the whole 20+ minutes of it was just Oreki and Chitanda talking, but it wasn't boring, because they show visuals. This is a constant throughout the whole show, in similar moments. Hyouka is an anime that knows how to be one, how to take advantage of everything you can do with an anime. Pic very much related.<br><br>Irisu a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The show was always a visual treat. I've deemed the first half boring, but one of my favorite sequences was reverse-aging the librarian, a scene from episode 5. It would've been much worse had they just shown Oreki standing there explaining who the librarian was.<br><br>Still, overall the first half just didn't do as much for me as the second half.</br></br></br>  <br>I honestly cannot understand why do you think that. I really can't.</br>  It was boring. I gave it six episodes before dropping it since the only character I remotely even gave a shit about was Fukube and I wasn't sticking around just for him. Getting through those six episodes felt like a chore. I was never hooked by it.  <br>Mostly has to do with what the second half offered in comparison with the first.<br><br>Th standalone OVA after an arc I disliked was a good start. In the festival arc, all four main characters get their own storyline - Mayaka and Satoshi confront inferiority issues, Chitanda tries to ask favors and inadvertently teaches Irisu life lessons, and Oreki does Oreki things. Plus the cooking competition, and a mystery that brings the whole school into play.<br><br>Post-festival, we get five stand-alone episodes to finish. Self-contained 22 minutes stories that developed the Oreki/Chitanda relationship changed the pace enough to be refreshing.<br><br>The second half felt livelier because it was, and it made interesting characters better. "Boring as fuck" might have been a crude description of the first 11 episodes, but I didn't feel they were as captivating as the next 12.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't think that's a fair comparison, since it's one made from hindsight. I agree that the movie arc isn't as good, but the Hyouka arc, specially its conclusion, to me, it's a tough contestant for best arc of the season, against Kanye Festa.<br><br><br> and inadvertently teaches Irisu life lessons <br>Wait, what? Where? How? I didn't see that at all.</br></br></br></br>  One of thsoe anime you like on the first watch and love on the second.  <br>Not possible to review anime without hindsight, especially one that's three years old. <br><br>"Life lesson" is when Chitanda tells Irisu that they have fundamentally different ways of asking for favors and getting people to do what they need. Might be small, but it is the conclusion of that story line.</br></br></br>  <br>'<br> "Life lesson" is when Chitanda tells Irisu that they have fundamentally different ways of asking for favors and getting people to do what they need. Might be small, but it is the conclusion of that story line. <br><br>How do you see that as a life lesson?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just re-watched the scene, it wasn't really a life lesson. They agreed Chitanda is bad at Irisu's ways of seeking favors, but good at getting straight to the point. Learning experiences for everyone</br>  <br>Ah. I see. I don't think Shitirisu cares too much, though.</br>  <br> hyouka is 5 years old <br>mfw</br></br>  Hyouka is my crack, I fucking love it.<br>It's funny because I almost dropped it the first time, but I think I have rewatched it twice now.</br>  <br>I dropped it around episode 3 or 4, before giving it another chance. It was a really fucking slow start, and took a while for me to giving a shit about the characters to keep going.</br>  I never downloaded the BD's, who's should I get?  <br>Bloatgirls. For once, the file size is justified.</br>  Which mystery book should I read?<br>I want to stop being a illiterate.</br>  <br>Eh, maybe the romance itself wasn't resolved, but the whole point of an open ending is that it's not over yet. I think as long as they plan to continue the novels (which they won't) the romance will eventually be resolved.<br><br>I don't think it really matters that Oreki never actually confessed to Chitanda, but he THOUGHT about going to the effort of essentially proposing to her; Which takes a lot more effort than he was willing to do at the beginning of the series. So at least we can say the show developed some characters well.</br></br></br>  <br> a illiterate <br>Please start as soon as you can.</br></br>  <br>Just get the classics like Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle, then work your way from there to author that influenced or were influenced by them.<br>Amateur stuff is often pretty good too if you know where to find them.</br></br>  <br>I didn't even notice that, I really need to start right away.<br>English isn't my first language, so can I get a free pass this time?<br><br><br>I will look into it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> (which they won't) <br>[citation;needed]</br></br>  <br>Sherlock Holmes<br>Inherent Vice<br>Rebecca</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I was just being pessimistic.

The only thing to surpass Hyouka recently is Shinsekai Yori, I d say.</br>  <br>What's crazy to me is that something 3 years old is a serious contender for the prettiest anime ever without much in recent years really putting up a fight.</br>  <br>I thought something similar when I re-watched it in March. I mean Monogatari can be pretty when it tries and Euphonium had its moments, but Hyouka is still gorgeous.</br>  did the nips like hyouka?  I thought harmless mysteries were really refreshing.  The best KyoAni show since FMP.  <br>It's boring plain and simple.</br>  What if it wasn't water?  I liked Hibike more. I wonder if that opinion would be different if I wasn't a bandfag.  It was fucking boring and had a terrible ending. Mayaka is adorable though.  best girl  Magnus  <br>W-what else could it be?</br>  <br>Sand</br>  <br>She's not Chitanda.

How wasn't Sasuke cucked in those 12 years?</br></br></br>  <br>1010 is a weaponfag, also temari is missing</br>  <br> Mitsuki is fucking Orochimaru's son <br>Yet he's a much more upbeat character. <br><br>Also, I'm liking the idea of everyone constantly telling Burrito he's going to be Hokage and him telling them to fuck off in retaliation. <br><br><br>This was great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nepotism.</br>  <br>She only gets wet for the Sauce.</br>  <br>it was just a kid doing narration</br>  <br>Yes, it has been confirmed. <br><br><br>Also Oro has stretching powers. <br><br>We don't know if Oro is his mom or his dad and taking into account Orochimaru has been female too and the kid looks like Kabuto...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto and Sakura's potential <br> Sakura's <br><br><br> also temari is missing <br>I guess assistant-kun just doesn't like sandniggers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in the bedroom obviously</br>  <br>Sakura was popular  pretty according to konoha citicens during academy and also post war</br>  <br><br>Because she'll never cheat on Sauce. Unless Ino becomes a giant futa.</br></br>  <br>That's in a special edition of Springtime of DARKNESS.</br>  You guys do realize it was Mitsuki doing the narration right?  <br>If that movie with Bitchnata in it wasn't sharringans making up bullshit then her dad would be stronk as fuck if he wasn't a lazy shit.</br>  is this official? because the bolt oneshot had him peeing on sasuke  <br>If it took as long to load for them as it did for me, then no.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't be Sakura be popular? Regardless of what her character could appear to the readers, she saved a lot of lives as ninja and as medic, she continued to save lives and took care of orphaned children after the war. She's pretty, devoted and smart.<br><br>But she has a terrible case of shit taste.</br></br></br>   Could your dad be Monkey D.. <br><br>Boruto pls.</br></br>  <br> Hinata <br> Elite <br>I like her bit that's just bullshit.<br>The entire chapter is clearly ninja propaganda that can't be trusted.</br></br></br></br>  <br> is this official? because the bolt oneshot had him peeing on sasuke <br><br>He said monkey d...so no it's a joke and not canon. <br><br>I thought it was official until it turned into shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares? It's Mitsuki speaking and Sakura's been part of the gags for years as "pretty yet bitchy girl who has horrible things happen to her".</br>  He stretches making his body looks like a snake.<br><br>He's Orochimaru's son.</br></br>  <br>Sakura has a lot of potential, she's just not a reincarnation of a ninja god. But as far as medic nin go, she fucking massaged a heart with her bare hands.<br><br>You keep shitting on the people who keep the other ones alive.</br></br></br>  Springtime of Eugenics when?  <br>Officially this is what she's considered, outside of these threads with "Ugh, lame. Stupid side character doesn't count, Juuken is the weakest shit".<br><br>Officially Hyuuga is the strongest clan in the leaf as well, but the thread reacts quickly against it when reminded.<br><br>Just because something isn't accepted by all, doesn't mean officially it isn't right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Officially Hyuuga is the strongest clan in the leaf as well <br><br>This chapter says those were the Uchiha before they were wiped out.</br></br></br>  t was nice but not what i expected<br>The assistant got Boruto's and Sarada's personalities all wrong<br>Boruto would never use the Sexy no jutsu. And Sarada doesn't act like Tsunade getting mad at everything <br>But oh well is just a parody</br></br></br>  <br>Does some have the hyuuga strongest Clan manga edit parodies from Japan saved?</br>  <br><br>It was written by his assistant. Everything here is NOT canon.</br></br>  Mitsuki is the best. I hope he never goes dark edgy.  <br>They are best friends?</br>  <br>Mitsuki is accurate.</br>  <br>It is pretty hard for dead people to compete in a race.</br>  <br>That's the code for they are fucking anon.</br>  <br>YOU ARE MY FRIEND<br>AHH</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's referring to her Talk no Jutsu during the war on Naruto? Everyone was listening, maybe it was a metaphorical shaking of the world?<br><br>But yeah calling her a Jounin by birth is laughable considering she was basically cast out by her family for being a crappy ninja.</br></br></br>  <br> Boruto would never use the Sexy no jutsu <br>Says you.</br></br>  Why do bois like hinata while gurls prefer sakura?  <br>ANO HI NO YUME</br>  <br> Mitsuki is accurate <br> Thinks Bolt will be Hokage. <br>That alone and the fact this is written by the assistant should have tipped you off.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't she a commander in the war, with a lot of troops under her? Don't underestimate Hinata. She's only ever lost to monsters like<br><br>-nedgy<br>-pain<br>-netori</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thinks Bolt will be Hokage. <br>But he does. It's in the novel adaptation as well, which is included in the movie. <br><br>Mitsuki can't read the atmosphere very well. He's like Sai in that regard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does not seem like he uses it in the movie.<br>Also<br> Salad acting like her mom. </br></br></br>  <br> Why wouldn't be Sakura be popular? Regardless of what her character could appear to the readers, she saved a lot of lives as ninja and as medic, she continued to save lives and took care of orphaned children after the war.  <br>Not popular nor important enough for the village to provide her with a house free of mortgage payments</br></br>  <br>Boruto technically has the skills and Talent of a future hokage and pretty much the general populace expect him to become one</br>  <br> Salad acting like her mom <br>But she does. She's just not a bitch.<br><br>Jesus, anon. Get the stick out of your ass. It's not 100% accurate, but it's meant to be played for laughs.<br><br>I'm sure if it gets adapted into a full manga the author will get a better feel for their personalities.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That alone and the fact this is written by the assistant should have tipped you off. <br><br>That's literally something that happens in the novel with the panda as well.<br><br>He tends to say often "Hoh, you're certainly your father's son, the next in line to become Hokage" which gets at Bort. Mizuki is said to be that type who doesn't get subtleties and just says things.<br><br>That's not "This is proof its noncanon shit and wrong", that's "This is just like the official story where he also says it".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought he was just trolling honestly.</br></br>  <br>As true as that might be the clan was considering exterminating her because she was that weak until around the timeskip. <br>Do not misunderstand me. Hinata was never born an elite ninja as is outright stated in that page. She worked her ass off and her Byakugan is weak compared to others.</br></br>  <br>Kishimoto clearly drew the first couple pages, though. I think we can safely accept them as canon.</br>  <br> Hyakugan </br>  <br> Not popular nor important enough for the village to provide her with a house free of mortgage payments <br>Pic related makes it look like she's still living in that shitty apartment we saw at the end of Gaiden.</br></br>  <br>-a rock</br>  The assistant even do the art in the first two pages thats why it all looks a bit off   Sakura <br> elite by birth <br>This guy should stop the drugs.</br></br>  <br> The assistant even do the art in the first two pages thats why it all looks a bit off <br>Really? I thought that was Kishi but he just rushed it.<br><br>He's not bad at emulating his style. If the series gets a new writer he could draw.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It really explains why he spent his childhood annoying his grandad instead of his parents.</br>  <br>Konoha is like ninja-/a/ with shot taste<br>After their waifu sakura married sauce and became pregnant, they exploded in rage</br></br>  <br>I don't think he did just look at Mitsuki or the first page</br>  <br>Read it again, shithead. He's talking about Salad. That's why it's a separate from the paragraph.</br>  Salad's gotten pretty bitchy since the end of Gaiden. Oh well. At least she's got talent unlike her shitty mother.  <br>I thought so.</br>  <br>Her Byakugan is about the same as others, but she wasn't naturally gifted from birth. Her eyes can still see the same things other eyes can and with training she was finally able to make something of herself. She wasn't gifted from birth but her eyes aren't naturally weak, as shown further with the way she was able to eventually become something with training.<br><br>Then the movie happened and she got a slight upgrade as Byakugan Princess, who has some Hameru chakra.</br></br></br>  <br> implying pinkshit is her mom <br>kek</br></br>  <br>A lot of his assistants can emulate him you know. Though it tends to look a bit off.</br>  <br> He doesn't know <br>Sakura's 900% her mom, anon. It was a red herring.</br></br>  <br>Salad is nothing like Sakura. Sakura is<br><br>-bitchy<br>-obsessed with her crush<br>-plays the good girl who follows the rules<br>-gets angry quickly<br>-secretly likes to do childish things<br>-enjoys bossing people around and criticizing them<br>-proud whenever she accomplishes stuff and wants praise<br>-a tattletail<br><br>Does even one of those apply to Salad? Salad is<br><br>+calm and vaguely unenthusiastic<br>+unconcerned with looking strong in front of her classmates<br>+the straight man<br>+the type to let people have their eccentricities without calling them out on it<br>+one to get happy or sad easily, but doesn't start yelling unless she gets pushed really far<br>+good at keeping secrets/being a bro</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She never trained under Tsunade, she just tagged along with her uncle's girlfriend.</br>  <br>Come on, anon, don't be delusional. It was fun to laugh at the tears who for one fucked up reason or another like Pinkshit, but she did somehow manage to acquire Sauce's sauce and got pregnant with his daughter.</br>  <br>You have autism anon. The point is they're supposed to represent comedic archetypes. She's the bitchy tsukkomi/straight man of the group. Just like 10/10 was in Lee's spinoff.</br>  <br> dat pose <br>so father is that clay guy?</br></br>  <br>I knew that pose looked familiar.</br>  <br>Stretching powers are not unique to Orochimaru.</br>  <br>He's still the dad/mom anon</br>  <br>Which is why we were speculating he could be an Otsutsuki. His name means full moon or something and the previews point out his eyes look like crescent moons when he smiles.<br><br>But the spoilers confirmed he's related to Orochimaru.</br></br></br>  <br> But the spoilers confirmed he's related to Orochimaru. <br><br>Born from.</br></br></br>  <br>What if Orochimaru is his mom and Netori is the dad?</br>  <br>Fucking hell, I know Sakura's man faced but this is ridiculous.</br>  If an assistant can imitate kishi to this degree, then he could do some Naruto Super/GT manga spinoff like Toyataro is doing it with toriyama's DB super  <br>I'd buy it.</br>  <br>Hinata was not a Division general in the Fourth Shinobi World War, no.<br><br>Hinata is by no means a close-combat beast - her younger sister by like six years was better than her and was more accomplished with the Byakugan. I mean, Hinata BARELY landed the 8 Trigram 64 Palms in the middle of the Fourth Shinobi World War - she got up to 32, was about to call it quits, and remembered the cute lil hand-holding with Naruto, and apparently that gave her the push to land the other 32 attacks and knock down ONE Juubi spawn.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the biggest Hinata fans there are, but she's not even slightly a combatant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, Shizune's related to Dan? <br>Also Tsunaded said that Sakura was even more capable student than Shizune implying she did teach her.</br></br>  do you think its somehow big deal for kishi to spend 1 day to draw couple pages  <br> Her Byakugan is about the same as others <br>It was probably Kishi not paying attention to what he wrote, but she could see ten kilometers ahead of her. For reference, the genius Neji could see fifty meters.<br>I suppose it could be explained by Hinata having more experience with using the Byakugan for expressly scouting purposes as opposed to Neji's focus on combat, the Branch family seal fucking with the efficiency of their Byakugans, or simply her hard work paying off and surpassing Neji's natural talent, but again, it all depends on my presuming that it was not just Kishi not paying attention/fucking up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I never said he wasn't, anon, and it's a better than evens chance he IS, whether vat-born or otherwise. I was simply saying that extendo-limbs does not immediately make him Oro's kid.</br></br>  <br>It could work <br>He just needs to change Boruto and Sarada personalities because with this<br>It looks like fucking jiraiya and.tsunade all over again but of course this is just a parody so everythings okay</br></br></br>  <br>She's got lion fists though, that's much more powerful than anything Hanabi has to offer, and she later got Hamura's chakra like Naruto got Hagoromo's.</br>  <br>Didn't she give some speech about how this was a war to protect Naruto so failure was not an option? I haven't read those chapters in ages, but I thought she had some level of command.</br>  <br>The guy does not strike me as someone who'd want to handle the manga seriously. He likes his gags and applies a very clear formula to pull them off.<br>Sure, that would make him more amenable to the idea of a light hearted SoL-esque format that would best serve the seires, but I am unsure whether he'd be willing/able to pull of something less ridiculous than the Lee spinoff.</br></br>  <br><br>There's nothing stopping Hanabi from also learning Twin Lion Fists, and Hamura's chakra was presumably just a temporary power-up.</br></br>  <br>We've seen diddly dick all of Hanabi's abilities. We can't really compare them at this point - we've only seen when Hiashi told Kurenai that he didn't care what happened to Hinata as Hanabi showed a ton more promise.<br><br>Pretty sure all Hyuuga's have Hamura's chakra, don't they? Wouldn't any main-clan Hyuuga have sufficed? He just wanted to get down to some delicious long-time incest.<br><br><br>I'm actually reading those chapters now. It was when Neji died and Naruto was seriously beginning to doubt his ability to protect everyone. Hinata gave him a big ol' slap and basically said "Fucking wake up to yourself you big stupid beautiful lovable faggot. We're all fighting for you. We knew what we were getting into. Neji did. I do. We all do. But we need you to get your head in it."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She gets pretty proficient with her gentle fist during the war arc, mastering 64 Palms (128 is filler), using vacuum fist and twin lion fist. She probably caught up with hanabi at least, who was supposed talented<br> twin lion vacuum fist never </br></br>  <br>Hanabo has kitten lion fist in storm 4</br>  <br>From the looks of it she's the equivalent of a lieutenant, appropriate for her chuunin rank.<br>What she does is rally the troops a couple of times, fights for a few days straight on the front, cooperates with Ino to pull off a move that ends up saving the whole army from being wiped out in a single attack, TnJ's and slaps the sense back into Naruto and impresses Madara while buffed by Naruto.<br>That's plenty for a character who is not expressly main cast.</br></br></br>  <br> we've only seen when Hiashi told Kurenai that he didn't care what happened to Hinata as Hanabi showed a ton more promise <br>Which was twenty years ago and everyone including Hiashy himself has said that it's bullshit to judge power by inherent talent since then.</br></br>  <br> they can heal almost any wound <br> can't heal eyes so you don't have to wear glasses <br>dropped like  a female baby in China </br></br></br>  <br>Larger titties.</br>  <br>But if they healed the need for glasses we wouldn't have gotten Sarada with glasses. It was a necessary choice.</br>  <br>As I said in , she only JUST gets around to mastering the final 32 palm strikes in the middle of the Fourth Shinobi World War after holding hands with Naruto. She gets to 32 palms and says that's her limit, so we can assume that she never got past that point before then.<br><br><br>Yeah, this is true I guess. I'd like to see a Hinata v Hanabi face-off now. While Hinata trained hard, Hanabi trained hard AS WELL AS having natural talent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Hinata's not a bitchy lying hypocrite, that's it.</br>  <br>She still can't do palm rotation, which is instrumental to covering the weakness of the byakugan.<br><br> Personally i liked that version of the palm rotation she invented in that filler where it was like a slicing field that played on her strength of inherent flexibility. I kinda wish it was canon, it could have been a good development for her character.  </br></br></br>  <br>Guys want a nice and supportive wife as Hinata, girls want to be iniative and confident like Sakura.</br>  <br><br>Is breast envy the root of all problems?</br></br>  <br>The sasuke rescue arc in part 2 (during sauce vs itachi) was pretty wasted for Team 8</br>  <br> Wasn't she a commander <br><br>No she was a nobody scrub like she had always been before</br></br></br>  <br> initiative and confident like Sakura <br>Sakura is neither of those though.<br><br>Girls like Sakura because she is flawed = human = good for self insertion. Boys like Hinata because they want to insert their dicks in her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> elite by birth <br>Maybe her chakra control.<br> beauty <br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>And great asses are the end of them.</br>  <br><br>Sakura's had at least two admirers that I can remember, Lee and that one fodder during the war. Like it or not it's pretty well established that she's canonically beautiful.</br></br>  <br>  you will never have a threesome with the Hyuuga sisters, with Hinata bringing the tits and Hanabi bringing dat ass. </br>    <br>Guys like the idea of having a girl like Hinata that will unconditionally love you and support you.<br><br>Girls like how Sakura never gives up on her lust for the good looking bad boy,</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, Sakura is a genius.<br>Took her two years to get as good as Tsunade was medical-wise back during the Second Shinobi World War..</br></br>  <br>Every other girl in the Narutoverse is more attractive than Sakura. Maybe she had Moegi beat.</br>  <br>Delicious cake. Must eat.</br>  <br>I don't see why not. Hopefully none of Kishi's autism rubbed off on him.</br>  <br> Sakura <br> Confident </br></br>  <br>Even after he tries to kill her.<br><br>Twice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>if anything it's orochimaru and  kabuto's  kid</br></br>  <br>Sakura has always been hyped up as beautiful. Kishimoto thinks that by having people in the story tell you this, you'll believe it and it'll make her more likable. In fact, when he found out Sakura wasn't very liked, the first thing he tried to do was make her more beautiful... instead of developing her fucking character.</br>  <br>Well it's not happening to them. It's all fun and games until it actually happens to you. Then you find out it isn't fun.</br>  <br> The guy does not strike me as someone who'd want to handle the manga seriously <br>Good. Serious edgy bullshit is what killed nardo to begin with.</br></br>  <br>Hinata had a nice character arc, getting stronger in the background, each time we saw her she was a little better. Until she was finally showing enough strength to stand up seriously, even correct and stand behind the guy she loved by the war arc.<br><br>There's a lot of discrediting going around, it was always more than that though. <br><br>She was liked well before she was revealed to have boobs. She earned major points during the Chunin fights, never giving up during an impossible fight unto the verge of death, being the first one to like Naruto for just being him, and her speech right before he fought Neji. She stood up to Pain to save Naruto, saving her life while sacrificing herself, and confessing at the time thus showing her guts. How she's evolved can be seen there compared to previously.<br><br>Even the VA's comment they like her because she progressed and grew strong like that, even if it wasn't in the lime light.<br><br>Being attractive is a nice bonus. Nice character, nice character arc, and a hot body, not just in the sense that she has curves, but her hair, her eyes, her face, it all works in a nice way. She's that mix of cute and sexy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  下げる  <br><br>Well this is true but he had two errors with her. <br><br>One she cut her hair in some ugly rigid style. Two she's too flat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well considering some LNs that don't have the heroine mature until the 20th volume and real life celebs, I can see why he would think this.</br>  <br>And has yet to get a single kiss.</br>  Who are Mitsukis parents?  <br>  Sakura and Sasuke's first night together <br>  Sasuke dyes Sakura's hair black and puts it in a ponytail <br>  Draws lines on her face with charcoal <br>  Puts in Sharingan contacts <br>  Only from behind, just in case <br>  Sakura has to yell "MAYBE NEXT TIME" the whole time they're doing it </br></br></br></br></br></br>   implying Burrito won't go down as the strongest Jyuuken user of all time <br>Why are you wasting your breath on Hinata?</br>  <br>I was reading part 1 recently and I had completely forgotten how cool her fight with Neji was, Such a good moment.</br>  <br><br> that little push <br><br>It's like a bitch mode shinra tensei</br></br></br></br>    So if hinata didn't get with nardo, would she have remained single forever or give in to hyuugacest?  <br>People really need to think more about these things.<br><br>He was stopped by Shikadai's shadow bind before the blow could connect. The fact that his skin ripped isn't saying "Oh man what fucking weak shit", its saying "That's how powerful the blow was, just imagine if it had hit".</br></br></br>  <br>Orochimaru.</br>  <br>Still fucking brings me to tears, every time.<br><br>Just stay down, Hinata. You've done enough. You've shown everyone how strong you've become. Don't get up again. My heart can't take it.  And neither can yours .</br></br></br>  <br>Brianna Wu?</br>  <br>No thanks i don't want this series to become Dragon Ball 2 with funny shit</br>  <br> He was stopped by Shikadai's shadow bind before the blow could connect. The fact that his skin ripped isn't saying "Oh man what fucking weak shit", its saying "That's how powerful the blow was, just imagine if it had hit". <br><br>How did he escape it?</br></br></br>  <br>Orochimaru already has a kid, anon.</br>  <br>Cheating</br>  <br>I don't deny that Hinata is a likable character with mostly positive traits. I just think it's funny that when someone remarked that they liked her, Kishimoto laughed and immediately figured it was for her big boobs. She isn't a complete blob, but she (like most females in this manga) was dropped flat and her only saving hope for relevancy was her thirst for Uzumaki dick.</br>  <br>Again, the distinction is between the dreadful, wannabe serious/edgy bullshit that Kishi did and the overly goofy stuff of the Lee spinoff aimed at 6 year olds which got old pretty fucking fast.<br>There should be a happy middle ground between those two, I'm just not sure if that assistant can reach it.</br></br>  <br> How did he escape it? <br>No clue. All we know is they fight, some green shurikens are thrown, Shikadai holds a kunai and it ends when Bort uses Mass Shadow Clone via device and Shikadai surrenders.</br></br>  <br>YES.</br>  <br>   Daughter </br>  <br>He contributed enough to the main series. I don't see why he can't capture a similar tone with the new one. <br><br>On the bright side at least he hates Uchihas.</br></br></br>  <br>The idiot could have won without cheating</br>  <br> On the bright side at least he hates Uchihas. <br>Okay, I like him much better now.</br></br>  <br>Then Naruto interrupts the match, strips Bort's headband off, declares Shikadai the winner instead.<br><br>Says he'll talk to him about this when they get home, Bort suddenly explodes about how a lecture would be something he would be glad to receive, but Dad isn't even home for that much. Don't pretend you'll suddenly be home enough for it now.<br><br><br>Shadows are serious business</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And murder Shikadai in the process.<br><br><br>Anyone who pisses on Sasuke's head is alright in my books.</br></br></br></br>  This is even better than the Rock Lee series.  <br><br> Elite Jounin by birth <br><br>The fuck is this? Hinata was a clear example of hardwork and guts, she wasn't an "elite" by birth unless it means "being born in a prestigious clan"</br></br></br></br>  Plebs don't know that it's  Anko's  child.  <br> she wasn't an "elite" by birth unless it means "being born in a prestigious clan" <br>That's what he means. <br><br>And you fucking Jews, I'm not typing the CAPTCHA wrong. Stop telling me that I am.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this getting translated yet?</br>  <br> Anko's child <br>Who?</br></br>  <br> yfw Burrito had to perv on all his friends' moms for research </br>  <br>Get the fuck out of this place, dare to post sakura's smug on cancerous thread. <br><br>All of you just fucking kill yourselves, and fuck off with your ''HUG CLUB'' bullshit.</br></br></br>  The Countdown/Secret is a new anime, novel, manga or movie about these three    <br> And you fucking Jews, I'm not typing the CAPTCHA wrong. Stop telling me that I am. <br><br>I'm getting the same Shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The fat lady in that was not the little niglet in 700.</br>  We'll never now what's in the big city  <br>Either that or it just announces when they'll be opening the doors to the theater.<br><br>I'd prefer the former though. I like this generation too much.</br></br></br>  <br>When is the announcement supposed to come out again?</br>  <br>Half an hour before the movie comes out.</br>  <br>So 1st and 2nd trained the 3rd<br>3rd Team leader of Jiraiya<br>Jiraiya Team leader of Minato<br>Minato Team leader of Kakashi<br>Kakashi Team leader of Naruto<br>Naruto Team leader of Konohamaru<br>Konohamaru Team leader of Boruto</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> The movie is set to be released in Japanese theatres on August 7, 2015 <br><br>Fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>we actually knew a long time ago</br>  <br> Naruto Team leader of Konohamaru <br>Not officially, but he definitely taught Konohamaru some shit. <br><br>So basically either nardo has to teach Salad, or Konohamaru has to become Hokage first. Otherwise the nepotis- pottery doesn't work.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you retarded? Naruto was not the team leader of Konohamaru, Ebisu was.<br><br>Nice going retard</br></br></br></br>  holy shit.<br>I hate hate hate what kishi did to this fucking series.<br>It was badass when it was "hard work pays off" with Rock Lee, Naruto beating Neji, and the cool sidecast.<br>Now literally EVERYFUCKINGONE that matters is "elite bloodline".<br>Fuck that noise.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>there is a like 14 years gap between Last Naruto movie and Naruto becoming a hokage, he can easily be team leader in that time frame, he was already teaching shit on the academy anyway</br></br>  <br> Mitsuki is a not creepy Orochimaru <br> Boruto just wants daddy to be proud of him <br> Sarada proves two minuses make a positive </br></br></br>  <br> being this autistic </br>  <br>well, they do are elite blood lines, Naruto only beat neji cause he has kyubi chakra when neji blocked his</br>  <br>Naruto only taught Konohamaru, he wasnt their team leader.</br>  <br> Fuck that noise <br>Nah. You see enough "muh hard work" characters in shounen even though they almost always turn out to have some secret past and are destined to save the world or some shit. <br><br>It's much more refreshing to have a bunch of Ubermenschen whose destinies are unclear. That way the ridiculous feats they'll inevitably pull out of their asses seem less stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>how said he was not? he spent 14 years doing nothing?</br>  <br>It took Kishimoto this long to create a team that could actually work together effectively and isn't filled with wannabe psychopaths. He better not leave us hanging.</br>  <br>This is why I like that new ultra battle sattelite series. I hate how shonen always need that damn bloodline trope - I mean I get why, in that bloodline is a convenient way to make a bullshit powerup (oh hey I just awakened my legacy powers how convenient!) and distinguish why they're the MC, but it's so much cooler when a character whose family is a non-factor actually makes something out of themselves... although now that I think of it you're right I can't name a damn shonen that doesn't fall into that trope besides battle sattelite and world trigger.</br>  <br>Up there, there is nothing but jonin financial analysts.</br>  <br> he spent 14 years doing nothing? <br>He probably had to climb the ninja social ladder, ninja Jesus or no. He also had to bang Hinata and raise two kids.</br></br>  <br>Saved the earth from the Moon, dated hinata, married hinata, Fucked hinata, took care of boruto,fucked hinata again, took care of himawari,</br>  <br> implying he only fucked hinata twice <br>more like he spent 6 years having sex every fucking night.</br></br>  <br>those 14 years is after the moon, so in boruto time, its been about 16 years since the 4th ninja war, a little over 32 - 35 years since the 3rd</br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>You can't have everything in a Shounen<br>At least Kishi didn't make Naruto.Marry the main heroine</br></br>  <br>Naruto's theme never was hard work, it was never giving up. That's why they make a big deal of the word shinobi (endure).</br>  <br> At least Kishi didn't make Naruto.Marry the main heroine <br> made the busty shy girl win last generation <br> childhood friend his a shoe-in for this one <br>All he has to do is hook up nardos grandson with Shizune and all will be right with the world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he was promoted to Jounin rank and was a sensei to three Genin (could be pretty entertaining, to be fair), it would have to be three new rookies, not Konohamaru's group. They are what, three years younger than he is?<br><br>Let's say he gets more focused and is promoted sometime before his marriage (really fucking short time, maybe a double promotion like Neji, because he is the single most powerful being on the planet, which he just saved again). He is in the 19-20 age range. It's possible for newly minted Jounin to be granted students (see Kurenai), but at that age he'd only have a few years of experience and a helluva power gap on his new students. Realistically he'd have to spend a year or two as a Jounin but doing missions normally, like Shikamaru or Sakura were doing before taking on students. Promoted, I can see him take command of units composed of Chuunin and Genin, but not as an officially appointed teacher.<br>By the time he got to an age where he could responsibly take on students (22-24?), Konohamaru and his friends would be at 19-21 themselves, easily already Chuunin, possibly Jounins themselves. There is no way he'd be listed as Konohamaru's teacher, not formally at any rate.<br><br>That said it could be interesting to see a team trained by him, and Sarada (say, spotting the patterns thanks to a comment by Bolt) getting nervous someone would snatch the Hokage title and she'd have to play the waiting game as her best option.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Boruto won't use his own mother for sexy jutsu <br><br>He'll never max out it's potential at this rate</br></br>  <br>Westermarck effect, anon.</br>  <br>Funny as the one-shot was, I don't see the guy use the technique at any rate, not until he resolves his daddy issues and learns to have some fun. Preferably he'd start to develop an odd similarity to Jiraiya at this point.</br>  <br>She was never said to have perfect chakra control.</br>  <br> thanks to a comment by Bolt <br>Which one?</br></br>  <br>Naruto probably made the Sexy Justu: Hinata Varient a SSS rank forbbiden jutsu, whos use is punishable by death.</br>  <br>I was speculating, anon. He made no such comment, but I could see him starting to point dubious shit out about the Hokage system's nepotism. Which would make Sarada kinda butthurt that she did not really get any training from a previous Hokage, is instructed by a guy who only got unofficially taught a single technique from Naruto and her only real link is being daughter to his rival. <br>Should he have three pupils of his own, the elders might pick any of them over her Uchiha ass, hence the speculated annoyance.</br></br>  What I want to know is WHY they still haven't done anything about Orochimaru. They treat him almost like an old friend, and even allow his creepy spawn into the village. Did I miss something?  <br><br>war hero</br></br>  <br>He's like a cockroach. He's been killed like 4 times, he had his soul sealed twice, and he just keeps coming back.<br><br>If you can't get rid of him, you might as well put him to work.</br></br></br>  <br>Well a) he said he wasn't evil anymore and b) it's pointless trying to do anything against him, he'll just resurrect and try to destroy the village again.</br>  <br>The only people who can manage to even kill him at this point are Naruto and Sasuke, maybe Tsunade if she brings her A game. <br>Once you achieve that massive feat, he has a million and one ways of coming back from the dead.<br>He also helped to save the world.<br><br>It's easy enough to see how some sort of compromise could be reached with him, to avoid headaches and future conflict all around. You know, he agrees not to do TOO horrible things, so long as the Leaf does not watch too closely, maybe he gives them some of the fruits of his scientific work while they happen to lose supplies near his place and neglect to burn down his old hideouts. he sticks to using clones and genetically engineered bodies for his host migration and does not kidnap children, they don't murder him and everyone with the curse mark.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Did I miss something? <br>Yes, anon. Yes you did.</br></br>  <br>Elders can't pick shit, Naruto runs a dictatorship.</br>  <br>the power of forgiveness and friendship anon</br>  <br> implying he can be a bad guy/girl when he gave us best boy </br>  <br>The previous Hokages did not get to pick their successors, otherwise Danzo would not have had a shot at becoming the one after Tsunade.<br>Technically it is the feudal lord who appoints the head of the mercenary city state under his vague vassalage, but he is heavily advised by the clan heads and the elders who look for someone who is sufficiently popular, powerful and connected to the previous Kages in some way, probably reflecting various clan interests.<br><br>It's a real shame the main focus of the series was Uchiha fucking shits and DARKNESS, because we could have had a story focusing on missions and intra- and inter-village politics, with some shit with the feudal lords and elemental nations thrown in. And when the story would inevitably go to a Fourth World War it would not be against faceless plant zombies and characters we've already had a resolution with, but against fellow (ninja wizard) humans fighting for their country like the good guys, maybe having to face characters they have previously met under more positive circumstances in joint missions or in the chuunin exams.<br>Or we could have vaguely gay, continent-busting Uchihas ruining everything for everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The previous Hokages did not get to pick their successors <br>Tobirama made Sarutobi the hokage out of the blue.</br></br>  <br>Hashirama picked his brother. Tobirama picked Hiruzen. Hiruzen picked Minato. Minato died and then Hiruzen died and here we have the only case of someone other than the Hokage picking the next Hokage. Tsunade picked Kakashi and then Kakashi picked Naruto.<br><br>Naruto's a military dictator.</br></br></br>  <br><br>We see the feudal lord and the elders/clan heads actively discussing who to pick to succeed Tsunade.<br>So out of the successions we see in any detail there's the elders asking Jiraiya to either take the post or hunt down Tsunade and make her take the post, and the above case.<br>That points to succession not being directly controlled by the Hokage. By all means it is possible to steer the process if you make precautions while alive so that it goes to someone you want, and it might be a different matter if you step down on your own accord.<br>The real question, then, is whether Naruto would step down after, say, ten, fifteen years like Kakashi.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto's a military dictator <br>Of the National Socialist variety?</br></br>  <br>That was Kakashi.</br>  <br> The real question, then, is whether Naruto would step down after, say, ten, fifteen years like Kakashi <br>The only person he may presumably step down for is either Konohamaru or Salad once she's old enough.<br><br>His children will be old enough to live on their own by that point, and likely have families of their own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They can discuss it all they like but the power of succession ultimately resides with the Hokage.</br>  <br> Naruto's a military dictator <br><br>fucking what</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck me, I'd gladly help her restart the Uchiha clan, even knowing that at the very least the men are damned to insanity. Imagine how different the past would have been if Madara was a woman.</br>  <br> Imagine how different the past would have been if Madara was a woman <br> implying anything would change </br></br>  <br>Naruto commands a shinobi army and his word, in Konoha at least, is law. Military dictatorship.<br><br>And lets face it, the feudal lords are only in power because the ninja let them be.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Hashirama would have fucked her and just given her enormous power over Konoha. I don't know why the men are in charge of anything when the women are the clear road to power.</br>  <br>Any average girl will have at least 15 admirers before she turns 18.<br><br>If Sakura only had 2 she must be ugly as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> she's now butthurt over Hashiarama picking another woman <br> wipes out the Uzumaki village/clan in petty revenge </br></br>  <br>You're such a god damn moron</br>  <br>Oh please do go on, explain how.</br>  <br><br><br> Naruto ranks coincide with real life politics <br><br>You're giving Kishi way too much credit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Calling it, Mitsuki best boy</br>  <br> kishimoto created a society based on nothing <br>You are the one who is giving him too much credit.</br></br>  <br>All I can think about is that series of doujin with Sasuke love/hate-fucking a female Itachi.</br>  <br>Kishimoto created the idea of Hokage because he wanted wanted to create a character that represented leadership. Anything else is fan fiction</br>  <br>Did he also created the daimyo? is Kishimoto a time traveler or maybe he based his manga on something that already existed?</br>  <br> spinoff of Naruto centered around literal corporate espionage operations on Konoha's Wall Street <br>Imagine the possibilities.</br></br>  <br>How did it turn from learning to walk up a tree to being able to blow up planets with their powers? Like that is a fucking bs power jump</br>  <br>He might have gotten inspiration from Daimyo. But since there's no interviews stating that he did, we can't just outright claim that was the source of inspiration of from the Daimyo. We can only assume. The Presiden of the United states has control of the army, Kishi could have gotten the idea of Hokage from there for all we know.</br>  I can't believe Orochimaru was the only Sannin to reproduce.  <br>And it wouldn't be too far-fetched because the Hokage monument is literally ninja mount rushmore</br>  <br>If only Naruto was about ninjas and not battle wizards...</br>  <br>Why can't it be both?</br>   Is your dad Monkey D.... <br> Nope </br>  <br>Or Senju before they disappear for no reason.</br>  Naruto and One Piece shall never be apart  <br>all salad will do is take tenten's place, with boruto taking lee's place</br>  <br>That's the joke, from the perspective of the new generation all of them were elite by birth, while in reality so was only sasuke<br>Naruto, Hinata and Sakura had to train three times as much as Sasuke to get to his level</br></br>  <br> That bottom left shot with Neji <br>;_; fuck nigga</br></br>  <br>Ninjas had always the reputation of being capable to perform magic.<br>Those Jutsus are nothing new.</br></br>   unfunny chibi bullshit   <br>well an elite bloodline needs to start somewhere.</br>  Since Kabuto is a snake-guy too, why can't Mitsuki be his spawn?  Orochimaru and Luffy had kid yo  <br>The thing is, the Village could put pressure on the Daimyo and his councillors if they tried to appoint someone the ninja didn't approve of. If they try to push it, Konoha could just shrug and say "Righto, we'll being taking back those twelve incredibly powerful shinobi we designate to protect you. So, you know, good luck protecting yourself when someone from Kirigakure comes to take your head."</br>  <br>Yes and no. The shinobi world is currently at peace. Konoha wouldn't go to war against Suna simply because Naruto says "Fuck those Sand faggots." More than likely, he'd be kicked out of the Hokageship.<br><br>Also, if the ninja start acting up, odds are the Feudal lords could hire either another Village, the Samurai, or both.</br></br></br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/pmEJaM3NS5c?t=42  [ ]<br><br>At least he got to be part of the best jutsu in the game. Even after he died</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and that falls under the concept of a coup where people are dissatisfied with their leader and overthrow him. Not that they could. You try kicking the worlds strongest man out of power when the only other person who can match him doesn't care about you at all.<br><br>It's not like with us how the law and armies secure the Hokage position, it's that they could kill a whole army by themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke cares about Konoha now. If Naruto started pulling shit to try destabilise it, Sasuke would step in.</br>  <br>As if, if Naruto started throwing his weight around and turned from a benevolent dictator into an oppressive one Sasuke still wouldn't care.<br><br>You could maybe stretch it by having him care about what happens to his family, but since Naruto likes them it's not like they're unsafe.</br></br></br>  <br>Where can i read this? PLEASE </br>  <br>Sasuke came back to blow a fucking meteor out of the sky in The Last. He wanted to fight Naruto to the death for the title of Hokage. Sasuke cares about Konohagakure now. It's just the truth.</br>  Why is Burrito such a winner? Best Naruto character since Kakashi.  <br>I'm enjoying this Boruto shit more than I did Naruto. Hoping a series comes from this and not just movies.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>easy there, naruto shouldn't be on that list. He is practically on the same level as sasuake, with them being alien reincarnations</br>   Hinata <br> Elite Jounin by birth <br><br>HA, still best girl though.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not buying it, it makes more sense he did that out of friendship for Naruto; who is coincidentally the only person able to kill him and wouldn't be happy if his home was exploded and Sasuke could have stopped it but didn't.</br>  <br> He wanted to fight Naruto to the death for the title of Hokage <br>He also wanted to be a villain and kill all the kage with that title.</br></br>  <br>As I said, the Daimyo's decision is likely heavily influenced by the advice he gets from the various elders and family heads in the village proper.<br>Unless it was someone the feudal lord would outright refuse to deal with (i.e. an Uchiha) he would likely be fine with appointing whomever, so long as they are reasonable and know their place. <br>The succession seems to be operated on the lines of<br> 1) the previous Hokage steps down and picks a successor/nominates someone who, with the blessing of the previous leader of the village, will have a massive advantage in the determination of successor <br> 2) the previous Hokage is killed/died and has to be replaced, having left some sort of instruction for succession - much like above, though without real enforcement of it, on the honour system <br> 3) the previous Hokage is killed/died and has to be replaced, having left no suggestions as to who picks up the slack - the decision is handled entirely by the clan heads who make a number of proposals and deliberate amongst themselves, at which point their recommendation for the post goes to the Daimyo who 'picks' the candidate that they want <br><br>Now I wrote it down, the process sounds a bit like the British elections (or any other constitutional monarchy, I suppose), just replace voting citizens with clan heads and elders making the call.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that's not how it works, there's nothing democratic about Hokage succession if there's already a Hokage alive. The votes only happen if their previous dictator never appointed his successor.</br>  <br>Well yeah, obviously the last bit only applies to option 3.<br>We really should have gotten more political shit.</br></br>  <br>You can not buy it all you want, dude. If he was indeed friends with Naruto, he'd stop Naruto fucking up the Village by going to war with an allied nation.<br><br>Friends don't let friends declare war on allied nations.<br><br><br>There's no real reason a Feudal lord wouldn't approve of an Uchiha, depending on who it was. They wouldn't have a problem with Shisui or Itachi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking more along the lines of a post-world war feudal lord licking out Naruto's successor. If it's the same guy, he might remember squatting in some hole, shitting his pants as two Uchiha fucked up their lands and their peasants' villages. <br>A guy could take that personally. Hell, even the next generation of feudal lords would likely remember that Uchihas are fucking shit.</br></br>  <br>I think you're gravely misunderstanding the character of Sasuke and what he'd let Naruto do. Naruto would win the war against sand by himself, anyway, leaf village would remain unfucked.</br>  <br>There's no way Naruto isn't putting his son and his husbando's daughter on the same team even if they are both busting planets since birth.</br>  Soon..  <br>There's a worldwide ceasefire at the moment with all of the Villages, included the smaller ones like Ame. Konoha would immediately become set against the rest of the world. I think you're misunderstanding the character of Sasuke. His entire THING of talking to all the Kage was that he was doing a Heel Face Turn and putting the Village first now.<br><br><br>I guess. Still would largely depend on the candidate. If the Feudal lord turned down Sarada, he'd have to explain his position to a probably rather upset and indignant Sasuke, Sakura, and Seventh Hokage, among others. And he'd probably get ignored anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The one who gave the inspiring speech about protecting Naruto was actually Sakura</br>  <br>Once again, "Elite from birth" went to Salad because of who her parents were, not Sakura.</br>  <br>You know, that takes me way back. I think I actually liked the artstyle more back then too.</br>  <br>Didn't have the same impact as Hinata's had. Before Hinata's slap, Naruto was set to pretty much just give up, because holy fuck I can't protect everyone.</br>  <br>Naruto and Sasuke could take the whole world, there wouldn't even need to be a war. Naruto would just inform them they're now under his command and if they refuse they die.<br><br>Boom, now all village is konoha village.</br></br></br>  <br>But again, that's if Sasuke decided to go along with Naruto's insanity, which I don't believe he would.</br>  <br>How so? He made Sasuke the MC of the second spinoff</br>  <br>Sasuke's version of not going along with Naruto's insanity is telling him he can't come with to dick around in the forest for twelve years looking for a mysterious enemy he has no way to find, or find out if it really exists.</br>  <br>I'd enjoy seeing Sasuke say goodbye to Sakura and everyone and just muttering 'Jackass' as he wanders away from the Village, and he just spends the 12 years going to all the other Villages and makes it his mission to visit every brothel in every Village.<br><br>I'd read that Doujin.<br><br>I also have no idea how it took 12 years to dick around in about half a dozen realities.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boruto despises the whole Nara family</br>  <br>And all because Shikadai didn't go rabble rousing with him that one time, Nara fucking shits!</br>  <br>Why do you think so? If anything he's got a distaste for hard work that they have too.<br>Is it just him blaming Shikamaru for his dad not spending so much time with him?</br></br>  <br><br>Not quite.<br><br>His assistant does like to include elements of canon in his stories, but they are buried between a shitton of batshit insane, exagerated hillarity and they become apparent only in hindsight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man,now I remembered how awesome Land of the Waves arc was with Zabuza and Haku being a legitimate villain pair with proper characterisation. Then the Chuunin exam arc which had some legit clever fights where you never knew who was going to come out on top and how.<br>If Bleach reached its peak with the Soul Society arc, what would you say was the last good Naruto arc? The hunt for Sasuke, maybe?</br></br>  <br><br>Mitsuki does believe that in canon, though.<br><br>It's only after the events of the movie that Boruto decides he rather be the shinobi working in the shadows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Boku no Hero Academia. (although that is the case with some of the cast).<br>Mahou Sensei Negima.<br>Also, pretty much every martial arts manga ever.</br></br></br>  <br>The last good bit of the main manga was probably the Pein arc (sans the mass resurrection and the very end of it all), but what it was was a small oasis of 'hey, actually this isn't shit'.</br>  <br><br>Actually, by the time of the war, Hinata's byakugan is explicitely stated to be better than Neji's.<br><br>Her weaknesses are psychological mostly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>From the official movie novelization's first chapter:<br><br> Mitsuki without sarcasm: “As expected of the Nanadaime Hokage’s son, and the Yondaime Hokage’s grandchild…Eventually Boruto will also become the Hokage…?’ </br></br></br>  <br> vaguely gay <br> vaguely </br></br>  <br>I think Kishimoto's first asspull was Naruto winning his fight via fart. Absolutely hated that.</br>  <br><br> Pretty sure all Hyuuga's have Hamura's chakra, don't they? Wouldn't any main-clan Hyuuga have sufficed? He just wanted to get down to some delicious long-time incest. <br><br>Nope. It's more explicit in the novel, but Hinata was chosen.<br><br>That's why she was granted the title of Byakugan princess.<br><br>It was destiny/prophecy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Actually, by the time of the war, Hinata's byakugan is explicitely stated to be better than Neji's. <br>Where? The closest I remember to that is her having a 10km field of vision, far above Neji's when he was a genin, but we never do learn what his range is in Part 2.</br></br>  <br><br>She had some people after her in Sakura Hidden too.<br><br>And even if I'll always choose Hinata, I can admit that she looked pretty as fuck in her The Last design (which is presumably what she looks like in the novel).</br></br></br></br>  <br>What novel?<br><br>The only sub I've seen was the shitty English one with Korean audio, so I probably missed it.</br></br></br>  So does naruto die in the new movie or what? Any of it been leaked?  <br> So does naruto die in the new movie or what?  <br><br>No, just kidnapped</br></br></br>  Yay  filler  next week    <br>It was more of a joke than anything. He did pull off a proper combo attack using his clones, but before that moment of the class clown loser overcoming an enemy everyone else thought superior to him, someone rowdy and loud like him but who had all the guidance and comfort of family he wished for but never had, before all that Kishi felt it necessary to add in a fart joke.<br>Funny thing is, if it was just for something to slow Kiba down, the former prankster could have used a stink bomb or something amusing but at the same time inventive and useful, but he went with a fart joke instead.</br></br>  <br>Hinata is seriously like the best of the best. I like her The Last look as well, but I think her Shippuden look is my favourite.</br>  <br> At least Kishi didn't make Naruto.Marry the main heroine <br><br>That's standard in battle/action shoujo: YYH, Dragon Ball, etc.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That and connections.<br><br>Both Naruto and Sasuke were desitned for greatness, but Naruto achieves his dreams by forming connections with others, protecting others, etc.<br><br>In contrast, Sasuke erodes as a character the more he obsesses with vengeance and pushes people away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Niggastream.</br>  <br>He reminds them to their better times when they could understand what the Sharigan really did.</br>  <br>Yeah, I guess joke would be better way than asspull. I still really didn't like it.</br>  <br>And as his friend, he would beat him through the power of friendship to make him DE-EDGE just as he did to him once.<br><br>Sasuke's no longer edgy. He's just Batman.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure it's mentioned in the latest databook.<br><br>There's also the fact that she can tell Naruto and his clones apart, while Neji couldn't.<br><br>And Hinata kept her byakugan working longer than Neji could.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shikadai seems to be his rival.<br><br>I wouldn't be shocked if he has to compete with him for Sarada.<br><br>Probably he also has more contact with Sakura, Karui (because Chouchou hangs around with Sakura), Ten Ten (selling him illegal tech) and Ino.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsunade can beat oro <br>Oro is in a 20 year old body and Tsunade is going on 80.</br></br>  <br> she can tell Naruto and his clones apart, while Neji couldn't. <br><br>It's because he's her husbando, and what she could tell was that Naruto wasn't a Zetsu clone. No byakugan can tell a clone from the original.</br></br></br>  <br> Tsunade is going on 80. <br>Regeneration</br></br>  What do you think is the most mindfucking spoiler you could give the 2005 you?<br><br> Their children are best friends </br></br>  <br><br>That's the reason she's going 80, you dumbass.<br><br>That's probably why she was so eager to hand everything to Kakashi.<br><br>She's running out of years.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it stops the aging process given that Sakura is aging aswell and she has a better version.</br>  <br>  Tenten runs an underground weapons market that she builds alongside master smiths from the Land of Iron <br>  Wrist-mounted shuriken launchers <br>  Chakra siphons <br>  Pills that temporarily change your chakra element alignment <br>  Implants that allow mixing of two elements to 'create' kekkei genkai <br><br>I'd watch it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    She is cute. Cute!  <br>The regeneration makes her age FASTER. Her cells have a finite number of splits, and once those splits are used up, no more regeneration.<br><br>Considering she used it against Orochimaru and Kabuto, and then overcharged it against Madara, I'm surprised she's still able to look as young as she does.<br><br>Then again, Mei Terumi doesn't use that and she still looks like a top-tier MILF.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She only needs the power of love, anon</br>  <br>They kinda messed up the eyebrows.</br>  <br><br>There's really no evidence what so ever that Sakura has ever used Creation Rebirth under any circumstance.<br><br>I think her age lines are mostly stress than any shortening of her lifespan.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shame we never saw how her body looked like. Damn that robe.<br><br>Then again, I like girls with byakugans.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm surprised she's still able to look as young as she does. <br><br>The amount of chakra she spends to keep her illussion is negligible.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 5head vagoo <br>I don't know, man</br></br>  <br> Implying Sakura would show signs of aging and Tsunade wouldn't <br><br>She's lost at the very least 4 relatives. 2 of which was due to her own weakness and countless friends.<br><br>I would hope Tsunade reproduced but given her age and her spam of auto healing techniques I'd say her chances of fertility 0<br><br>This means only Boruto and Karin carry senju dna.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> as anon said, genetics are everything in the new series <br> fucking literally forgets as you would to water the fucking plants to give Boruto the Byakugan <br><br>good job Kishi, good job!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying Sakura would show signs of aging and Tsunade wouldn't <br><br>Where the fuck am I implying that?<br><br>You do realize I'm talking about Sakura there, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why I said A game. If she uses everything she has at her disposal she could maybe win, due to her in depth knowledge of his abilities, her own regeneration matching the shit he can do and her having an advantage when it comes to direct physical combat. The slugs are supposed to beat the snakes. We never really saw her use ninjutsu, but it is safe to presume he is better at it than her. <br>If she does everything just right, she has a chance of killing him. Probably also dying in the process due to exhaustion/poison/wounds.</br></br>  <br> Then again, Mei Terumi doesn't use that and she still looks like a top-tier MILF. <br><br>Because she was only in her 30s during the war. <br><br>Meanwhile Tsunade is like in 70 in the last chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's like you guys have never read an Naruto SD before  <br>He didn't forget. Giving the byakugan to Boruto would fuck over his not-gaySN.</br>  <br><br>I'd say Mai is pushing 40s by then. Still a real fine cake.<br><br>I kinda wish she had gotten involved with Chojuro.</br></br></br></br>  <br> knowledge <br><br>Anon, its been like 20 years and Tsunade hasnt needed to fight anyone strong, meanwhile oro has been getting refresh on his body AND learning new techniques.<br><br>She is physically 70, Hiruzen had trouble with oro's original body at 50.<br><br>Not to mention I'm pretty sure her regeneration doesn't reverse aging.<br><br>Tsunade can only punch, which is useless against oro given that he has senjudna from taking a zetsu body.<br><br>Also Naruto CUTHIMINHALF and he survived easily.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Where's the Fourth Mizukage? <br>  She's been spending a lot of time with the Fifth. Like, A LOT. Locked up in their office. <br>  She's probably passing on tips on how to run the Village. <br>  Yeah, that's probably it. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto <br> Being surprised by loopholes <br><br>top kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>She invented the secret Hyuga breast pressing technique.</br>  <br>All kages have sex with their successors. It's a rite of passage.</br>  <br>Onoki was busting his back up at his shippuden age and wasn't even a physical fighter<br><br>Hiruzen's chakra reserves and capacity were garbage due to his age.<br><br>I doubt she can dish out the punishment needed to put down a monster like Orochimaru anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Kakashi was the Sixth Hokage <br>  Naruto was the Seventh <br><br>  Hashirama was the First Hokage <br>  Tobirama was the Second <br><br>  Tobirama was the Second Hokage <br>  Hiruzen looked about 15 when he was field-promoted <br>  Sounded by like five other 15-year-olds <br>  With the Kinkaku Force closing in <br><br>NO EXCEPTIONS!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's all going to end after the Boruto movie isn't it?  <br><br>Tsunade was struggling against an Orochimaru with no arms before shippuden.<br><br>AND she had a partner. Technically 3-4</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope  not <br><br>I'm still hoping for slice of life-esque mini-arcs dedicated to showing all the Konoha couples meeting and falling in love.</br></br></br>  <br>He was 18 I think, so it's kosher <br><br>So much for Minato being youngest Hokage</br></br></br>  <br>Possibly. Hopefully Kishi is retiring/moving on to something else, leaving SP and whoever to make more stuff which hopefully they won't fuck up.</br>  <br>It fucking better, Kishi is beating a dead horse</br>  <br>Damn the earlier art sure had a lot more charm</br>  <br>everything about earlier Naruto had more charm</br>  <br> I'm still hoping for slice of life-esque mini-arcs dedicated to showing all the Konoha couples meeting and falling in love. <br>That's not gonna happen. The Last was an exception because it is the main character and a fan favourite and interesting side character, not the first of many. Even for that SP had to push for, Kishi would have been content with jumping ahead and just stating that they got together.  Which would still have been far more than what I was expecting. <br><br>That said some stories in The Last era could go over well. There's a bunch of new, pretty neat designs for the Konoha 11 to be used, some political stuff around forming the Ninja UN, still plenty of people who would not be happy about it, sorting the whole thing out with the Feudal Lords and what have you. Give that to someone competent and you could have some interesting stories in that period. Possibly including the stuff you wanted too.</br></br></br></br>  I want to make sweet love to Kurotsuchi  <br><br>They COULD happen if Kishimoto gives the go at some assistant or whatevs to continue with the Post 700 stuff.</br></br>  <br>Even if it did happen, I can see them botching it up with banal, boring shit rather than anything interesting.<br>Look at the recent exam arc filler for reference. So many neat opportunities to explore and expans characters, to show them as people who have grown and matured, right alongside an excellent opportunity to explore the world a little bit, maybe placing the exam in a location we've yet to be seen.</br></br>  <br><br>Not ALL filler is complete dogshit.<br><br>SP did good with The Last.<br><br>The people working on the Hidden novels are pretty good.<br><br>One of his assistants could have real talent and ideas.<br><br>Who knows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sp always fuck up.</br>  <br>I'm sorry, but I REFUSE to accept that Sasuke is Naruto's best friend. It's just too stupid</br>  <br> They used Breakdown for that scene <br><br>Fuck, my dick expected it and yet, it wasn't ready.</br></br></br>  <br> Konohamaru-sensei </br>    <br>His best actual friend is probably Shikamaru. He could have had a great friendship/rivalry with Lee but we never saw anything like that happening.<br>Sausage is the first friend he made and as such, imprinted on that idea of the guy being his best friend, cemented in his mind. That is precisely the sort of shit that happens when you spend the first 12 years of your life being feared and shunned by everyone around you. It is sad, but what can you do.</br></br>  <br>Well she did get a power-up in the Last</br>  <br>Where were you when Hiashi won?</br>  <br>There's a pretty decen ty chance that he was the sensei for Asuma's daughter<br><br>I'm pretty sure she's a jounin now, since she serves as a bodyguard of sorts for 'Kashi</br></br></br>  Konohamaru became a looker.  <br>Come on, it is obvious as all fuck that Shikamaru was her sensei.</br>  So I just finished Vita Daisshutsu and planning to watch Magical Nanoha. <br>Two questions: <br>Is the game related to the anime? <br>Is the anime good?</br></br></br>   nanoha <br> 2004 <br> literally 11 years ago <br>just forget about it op</br></br></br>  <br> Is the game related to the anime? <br>I don't think so.<br><br> Is the anime good? <br>A's is generally agreed to be the best, original is generic mahou shoujo until Fate shows up, and whether you like StrikerS is probably affected by how much /m/ you like.<br><br>As for the manga, <br>Vivid, people say its shit, but it's alright imo.<br>Force, a lot of problems with the writing/characters/art, but great designs for the weapons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  DVD/BD #03 Cover (Pic related) and preview of the episode 04.   tfw they discarded the normal version   <br>That's some long hair.</br>  <br>Thank God.</br>  the manga became great after sylphin was regular  So in Japan every episode is sold as a solo blu-ray/DVD? And future seasons are based on that? Seems like lunacy, kinda.  Is this what you guys mean when you say you only watch a show for one character?  <br> not watching for imperialist japan </br>  Black &gt; Red &gt;&gt;&gt;Blue &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yellow  next<br>http://ponpokonwes.blog.jp/archives<wbr>/38433602.html</wbr></br>  <br>YES</br>  <br>No, if you look a bit to the right you'll see what we mean.</br>  Is he a Gary Stu?        <br>Did giganigga get an animation?</br>  I need doujins of him fucking Yamada.<br><br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2766119</wbr></br></br>  What did /a/ watched, expected and got?    <br>Animeonlyfag, I'm sorry, but, fuck. I already had the twist spoiled for me from reading the Wikipedia article, but it still got that gut reaction out of me.<br>The direction in the first episode was great.</br></br>  <br>The new ones got pretty creative.</br>  <br>holy shit, that is fantastic, is that a bot that changes what's inside based on who the opponent is?</br>  <br>The bot bites down it opponent locking them and spits out fire. Don't know if it relates on the bot your describing.</br>  is fansubbing dead?  <br>Well, I'm guessing it's possible to export CR subs and then combine them with some nice quality raws. I don't know why we don't have that.</br>  People actually care about GodrobeSubs?  bump  <br>Someone would have to put in effort. It's easier to just bitch about things as they are and pitch ideas.</br>  Speedsubbing is dead.<br><br>There will still be fansubbers who do it for high quality subs but those will take up to a week if not longer to come out.</br></br></blockquote>]
