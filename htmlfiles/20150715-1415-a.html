Ive run out.<br>Also, t answer your question. It's obvious. The setting is unique, the characters are unique and the pacing is good. The romance ain't nothing special, but it becomes special because of what i said above. <br>Sagara being in love and just seeing how he reacts is pretty interesting.<br>Also, it feels good to see a main character more autistic than myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some anime are worth re-watching.

I didn't dislike it but i couldnt see where the anime was heading or what it actually tried to accomplish. Should i cont?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah you can watch 08th MS team without watching any other Gundam.<br><br>Texhnolyze is a slow psychological anime so you've got to stick through it if you want to enjoy it. If you don't like slow paced shit then you probably won't like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess i'll watch it.<br>Here is mine, you might find something interesting.<br> http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Sa<wbr>nosai&amp;show=0&amp;order=4</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br>She's black hair canonically.</br>  <br>Gunbuster actually didn't run out of budget, they did the last episode like that because they wanted to be artsy.</br>  <br>Go home to Tessa</br>    <br> Rasengan </br>  <br>Panic.</br>  <br> Grab her <br> Tell everyone to leave the class room <br> Throw a grenade inside the class room <br> Take Chidori to the get away jeep <br> Take out the pursuing cops, and helicopters (no killing) <br> Fight 2 AS on foot <br> Use a decoy jeep to ensure our escape <br> Now with classes cancelled for the rest of the day/week, she won't get punished for not bringing her notebook. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just not care and leave her be, what a dumb broad.<br>Who cares about her supposed mental capabilities, what a bother, I couldn't be arsed.</br></br>  <br>Chidori is possibly the only time a tsundere has ever been done right in the entirety of anime.</br>  <br> tsundere has ever been done right <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.......<wbr>.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</wbr></br></br>  <br>Normally I would agree, but Chidori is by far the least shit, even if they are all shit.</br>  <br>wish i was actually part of a good series</br>  <br>Freefags need not apply.</br>  <br>Still shit, though bearable shit, but still tsunshit.</br>  <br><br>Receive suplex.</br></br>  Kick her in the balls.

It felt too rushed and that they just wanted to show some cool fights, art/animation and recolor Goku. <br><br>It was pretty fucking boring. Super is funny, the jokes make me laugh. The movie felt just dumb.</br></br></br></br></br>  What percent of DBZ is filler?  Goku &gt; Saitama  <br>Is this some trick question?<br><br>Elaborate</br></br></br>  <br>According to Kai, it's about 1/4 filler. Maybe a bit more if we include pacing issues</br>  <br>No I'm serious, it's hard to tell because seemingly every episode has filler scenes. It's not easy to calculate it like other shows that just have filler arcs, DBZ is just covered with random filler everywhere.</br>  <br>It's more about pacing than fillers, like One Piece or World Trigger.<br>I mean there are fillers like goku lasting against Buu when in the manga he just gets rekt and stuff like that but most of it is just toei stretching the fuck out of everything.</br></br>  <br>Yeah the pacing is terrible too, but there is definitely a ton of fillers.<br><br>In particular the Vegeta and Namek arcs seem like almost more filler than canon material, then of course they are followed by a pure filler arc (Garlic Jr).<br><br>http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Fi<wbr>ller</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it essentially is a springboard for the new series.<br>Especially since its being re-done in the series.<br>Personally can't wait to see the Universe 6 arc.</br></br></br>  <br>There is a lot of pacing issues which is the real filler but both DB and Z do have a very long history of filler episodes</br>  <br>opening is amazing</br>  <br>BoG was dumb as shit but fun as all hell, is Resurrection of F as enjoyable?</br>  <br>Lets Go!

He was always my fav character and I would love to see him come back in this series.  <br>Episode 2 was great! <br><br>Dragon ball GT was rubbish. Watching episode 2 of dragon ball super felt like watching the old dragon ball episodes. Fucking amazing! <br><br>Well, it's fucking obvious why it's great because the master is back! <br><br>Akira Toriyama is back into business.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my friend is watching all of Dragon ball through Z had to switch the Kai because there was just so much filler that it was suffocating</br>  and im sitting over here waiting for grown up gotenks...  <br> &gt;&gt;twitter </br>  <br>I heard dragon ball gt was anime original and had nothing to do with the manga of dragon ball. Can someone confirm this? <br><br>If it's true then I can actually understand why Dragon ball gt destroyed dragon ball. It was a horrible series. Well, it's actually obvious because the mastermind behind the dragon ball, akira toriyama didn't direct it.</br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama destroyed Dragon Ball himself with the 0/10 Buu arc. Let's see if he can redeem it with Super, but I really doubt it.</br>  <br>Toriyama provided some designs, everything else was anime original, SS4 included</br>  <br> Toriyama destroyed Dragon Ball himself with the 0/10 Buu arc. Let's see if he can redeem it with Super, but I really doubt it. <br><br>Destroyed dragon ball with buu arc? Did we watch the same anime? Did you watch dragon ball gt, that's what I call real rubbish and Toriyama only provided some designs but didn't work on the plot of dragon ball GT. <br><br>The first two episodes of Dragon Ball super were refreshing. For a change after the rubbish years of Dragon ball GT I finally had a feeling I was watching the real dragon ball again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes<br><br><br> Toriyama destroyed Dragon Ball himself with the 0/10 Buu arc <br>What? Dragon Ball was still quite popular to the point fan demand required that Toei NEEDED to continue the anime which is why GT existed. However it sucked</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's no Tiger that's a Smilodon Fatalis</br>  <br> What? Dragon Ball was still quite popular to the point fan demand required that Toei NEEDED to continue the anime which is why GT existed. However it sucked <br><br>Exactly! I have a feeling he mistakes the Buu arc for Dragon ball GT. The buu arc was really popular too.</br></br></br>  <br>It's non canon dbz fanfiction, but ill watch it anyway</br>  <br> The buu arc was really popular too <br>Buu arc is only popular among diehard nuthuggers that think Toriyama can do no wrong.<br><br>And no you fucking retard I'm not mistaking it with GT. No one cares about GT or even considers it canon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why you think Dragon Ball lost popularity during the Boo arc? The manga was still very high in shounen rankings during its run and the anime ratings remained as high as ever.<br><br>If you didn't like the Boo arc, that's one thing but saying "It wasn't popular" is kind of wrong</br></br></br>  <br>Is this bait, anon-kun?</br>  <br>I don't give a shit about your sourceless data whether or not it's true, I'm just saying Buu arc is shit and believe me I'm not the only one that thinks so. My original point was the series went downhill far before GT.</br>  <br><br>Shut the fuck up you autist</br></br>  <br>The series went downhill after Goku defeated Piccolo Jr.</br>  <br>  <br>underrated post</br></br>  <br>Toriyama nuthugger detected<br><br><br>I thought the Raditz/Vegeta/Nappa stuff was pretty solid, but yeah I agree other than that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>IMO the series should have ended when Goku turned into a super saiyan. If it ended at the frieza saga it would have been a GOAT anime series.</br>  <br>Namek arc was still pretty bad though with all the filler and horrible pacing.</br>  <br>Yes, it's confirmed.<br><br>Toriyama only provided some designs and that's it.</br></br></br>  I honestly think the Boo arc was better than the Cell arc. At least Boo was a fun villain<br><br><br>It was fine in the manga.<br><br>A lot of DB's pacing issues aren't really noticeable in the manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  where was Arale when the earth was being threatened or destroyed by cosmic beings?  Best subs for this?  <br>not giving a singular shit and probably exploding planets somewhere.</br>  <br> Bills dies and gets replaced by Arale the destroyer </br>  <br>i personally think it would be hilarious if arale is the god of destruction in another universe.</br>  We want Yamcha!  <br>Dragon Team</br>  <br>where is dragon team episode 2?</br>  <br> Great OP and gread ED too by the way. <br>Meh. Could be better.</br></br>  So, you think he'll at least get knocked out like Tien during the Beerus fight?  <br>Fuck of Puar.</br>  <br>Fuck off Chiaotzu At least Puar saved the planet.</br>  <br><br>I like the Buu arc better than Cell, too. The Cell saga is just full of things that dragged DBZ as a whole down. The focus on Saiyans became irreversible at this point, with Super Saiyan power ups being handed out like mad(Vegeta should've NEVER become a Super Saiyan, imo. It cheapened the whole concept when he achieves it simply out of self-pity.). Cell is a dull villain who's motivation is purely out of plot necessity of their being a villain. Buu saga may be guilty of a lot of the same things, but it constantly plays on expectations and subverts them and makes for something way more amusing.</br></br>  Welcome to WhackDonalds Anon!<br><br>Will you be eating here?

Look at the DoA guys and the Dynasty Warriors guys. They hate working on PC.<br>Also, finaly: They still have 3 vita spin offs out, with no port on sight for PC and 3 more coming, with also no word of a port.<br><br>Yes.

Nijiiro doesn't have the power behind it.</br>  It's a shame Nanjolno got such a irrelevant role. I would not mind hearing her duet with Nana.  <br>It is a good song; but that specific duet version is hampered by Nana and Minami not meshing together well.</br>  So what about Hajimari no Babel? Does the majority agree that it's the best song of them all?  <br>Really? I found they complement each other well. and Minami is the only one so far to have not been over powered by Nana during singing</br>  <br>On the converse, I can barely tell that Minami is singing when they're singing the lyrics together, while Hikase's voice is much more distinctive and able to break through Nana's.</br>  <br>It's a pretty hype song with its changing of key in the chorus and energetic dynamics, it worked great on that scene too, and it blew my fucking mind how they composed it putting together all of their activation chants as verses and the swan song as a chorus.<br><br>Having that said, though I have nothing but praise for it, it's not even close to the best song.</br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br> “Celestial Stars Galaxy Cross” which had been released prior to the concert, ranked at the top of each nation’s music charts, and is becoming a hot topic.  <br><br>The song is literally so good the entire world bought it.</br></br></br>  Reminder Aoi Yuuki will also sing one of the EDs for Rokka no Yuusha this season.  Can Shirabe and Kirika exist without each other?<br>I imagine experiments involving two adjacent rooms, a glass wall, and shutters.</br>  <br>I didn't see any muslims giving glory to Nana this time.</br>  <br><br>I can't think of any better best song than this.<br>Only First Love Song and Fushichou no Flamme come close.</br></br></br>  <br><br>They were already seperated in G, in the end they fought each other while declaring how much they love each other.</br></br>  <br>Can you prove they are even 2 different people?</br>  <br>One of them is flat, the other isn't.

I don't read much moon so I can't tell if its a set buy, or just a thing they keep track of if you buy the whole set individually.</br>  <br>In my experience, you can do it individually.

It sounds pretty standard, can hear everything else fine.</br>  <br>He relieves tension by training harder and watching more movies.

I mean they're already holding hands in public and everything.</br>  <br><br>No, I'm not that guy but there's definitely a problem with the audio mixing going on.

Did we manage to agree on  how the Symphogears like their steak?   Hibiki blue steak master race reporting   ‘Saving for well-done’ is a time-honored tradition dating back to cuisine’s earliest days. … What happens when the chef finds a tough, slightly skanky end-cut of sirloin that’s been pushed repeatedly to the back of the pile? He can throw it out, but that’s a total loss. He can feed it to the family, which is the same as throwing it out. Or he can ‘save for well-done’—serve it to some rube who prefers his meat or fish incinerated into a flavorless, leathery hunk of carbon, who won’t be able to tell if what he’s eating is food or flotsam. Ordinarily, a proud chef would hate this customer, hold him in contempt for destroying his fine food. But not in this case. The dumb bastard is paying for the privilege of eating his garbage! What’s not to like?   I thought symphogears was about ham  <br> blue <br><br>Hibiki isn't that savage, she'd at least have it be rare.</br></br></br>  Chris eats hers medium rare and very messy  <br>There's already a thread up </br>  Well done just like  Carol's dad   Miku was eating a steak in S1 ep7~8 so at least we know her taste    Pretty sure Hibiki would be like me - well done to burnt black<br><br>Can't stand even the hint of blood on my plate</br></br>  <br><br> savage <br><br>It's called appreciating the meat<br><br>And I defy anyone to tell me that Hibiki would disrespect a slab of fine meat</br></br></br></br></br></br>   L̗̳̰͇̝͍ͤͥ͘Ǫ̻̲̜̰̺̩ͩͬͭͧ̓͆̂ͯ̒͠͡N̆̑ͨ̏ͣ<wbr>̤̹͙ ̫͓̰̆ͧ͋D̨̫̽̋ͦ͂̂̈́ͨͧ͟͜ͅǪ̶̠̻̿̇̄ͫ̄̚N̔ͭ̇<wbr>̛̺̱̱̮̮̈̒ͅ</wbr></wbr>   We need a new thread, and I haven't seen one yet.  <br> We need a new thread <br>Why?

It's far from flawless, but it holds it's own damn well, and has some solid rewatch value, since almost everything in the beginning has a hidden meaning that makes sense later, and the later events are foreshadowed well in advance, if you know where to look.<br><br>Watch the series first, then move onto the third Movie, since the first two are just recaps of the series, while Rebellion is a proper follow up.<br><br>Enjoy your suffering!</br></br></br></br></br>  What is she thinking?  <br>Kevin</br>  homerun best girl  <br>Fact</br>      <br>You speak truthful words.</br>    <br>Do you have any saved links to said articles?</br>  <br>I hear the judges never even watched it.

Going through some threads, I feel dark temptations coming along.

While they did it for the wrong reasons I think there's a clear connection: both are genre shows that appeal to those who don't like the genre. People who couldn't tolerate super robo loved Eva, and people who can't stand a single transformation sequence loved Madoka.

It's literally factual. Like, dude, get over it, they hate each other now.    <br>It was easily the best thing out that year. It had some magic ingredients to help it on its way, Ume Tentei as the artist, Gen Urobuchi as the writer, Akiyuki Shinbo as the director... even before the first trail was released it had fans on edge wondering what the result would be like... and then there was the trolling. Epic levels of trolling, from the studio, and a dedicated fan base that stretched threads that scarred across /a/ for weeks on end, unbroken. Speculah to drive you crazy. Fan art pouring out from every corner of pixiv on a daily basis in reaction to each episode. By episode 10 we were fixed to the edge of our seats... and then the earth quake. Walmart night struck Japan and wiped out all the other animation studios. We waited with baited breath for the end of Homura Magicka...<br><br>Meanwhile, fangirls from the across the world resonated with the angsty teen drama that was unfolding, the dark tragedy told through the eyes of characters they most certainly could relate to.<br><br>And it was set in stone. Madoka was the next Evangelion. We received not one, but two godesses to lead the way, representing light and dark. Homura did nothing wrong. Madoka did everything right.<br><br>And so it continues.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The drama cd is canon, the manga adaptation is up to you.</br>  <br>That was never confirmed, you should go watch the film again.</br>  <br>Cause homura best girl</br>    <br>Homu a  cool. </br>    <br>how can one anon be so correct?</br>    <br>this actually helped thanks</br>  <br>It was though. Madoka only thought of Homura as some acquaintance that stalked her obsessively. Now she hates her for being evil itself who ruined everything.<br><br><br>Worst. Fanart like that sucks because it implies Madoka cares about Homura and Homura is not a monster worthy of mockery and hate.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Nah, note that TDS or the CD drama it's based on was not written by Gen, but Masaki Hiramatsu. A person who is not on the anime production staff.<br><br>http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Masaki_<wbr>Hiramatsu</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Anon is wrong because  Homura did somethings wrongs. </br>    <br>Like be born.</br>    <br>Like not making this happen.</br>  <br>no apple that is not correct!. Homu a best and did nothing wrong! But kyoko is a very close 2nd best!</br>    <br> was the personality development of the characters just really subtle <br><br>No it wasn't, you must be brain damaged to have not seen it</br></br></br>  <br> I don't know how canon works <br><br>It's not an adaptation of an IP owned by Gen.</br></br></br>    <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Madoka never loved or liked or cared about some random stalker who was a bitch to everyone.</br>  Below Saya, above rest of Butchers work.    <br>Oh, but you are wrong for Madoka loves Homura, her very best friend.</br>  <br>"you were my very best friend"</br>  <br>The term canon means what is true within a fictional setting. And the only way you can prove something is true is to support it with facts. There is nothing in the main story (e.g. The movies or anime) that supports the events that took place in CD3 Thus you have no proof to support the fact the events from CD3 are true in the same fictional setting as the anime/movies. <br>You can Google the word canon to confirm the definition.</br></br>  <br><br>Obvious lie to make her suffer less because in Rebellion Madoka didn't care about her at all. The real Madoka, not Homura's fake one.</br></br>  <br>Obvious lie you are telling us.</br>  <br>If madoka never cared why would she lie and say homura is her best friend</br>  Of course Madoka loves Homura. Why else would she save her, and then proceed to hug rape her during Episode 10, as well as sacrificing her self on numerous occasions to save Homura again, before personally welcoming Homura to a world without Madoka, and using Homura as the only point of contact back to the universe via fights with the Wraith... if she didn't love her?  <br>Kyouko knew Mami, and they were together when Madoka went ghost hunting despite not needing to be, like Sayaka who went to watch violinkun. Not that it would have to be addressed in the anime or movie to be canon. They can write a LN that takes place after rebellion and call it canon if they feel like it. You're just trying to enforce your own autistic idea of what constitutes canon on what was a company's project, not one man's IP<br><br>Though you're free to be one of the few in the fanbase who doesn't believe Mami trained Kyouko.</br></br></br>  Is homura yandere?  <br>I guess that question was finally answered then.</br>    <br>Madoka is so lewd.</br>  <br>I think Akuma could be considered so, but before then she was a tactical genius, who became extremely skilled in warfare. She was borderline tsundere towards Madoka (she had her moments), being uncaring towards all others, but she was never controlling of Madoka - at least not until the end of Rebellion when she snapped.</br>    <br>I speak the truth.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Lies. She would treat anyone kindly like she did to Homuwhore.<br><br><br>Yes. A shallow one.<br><br><br>Sick.<br><br><br>It's degenerate fanfiction. The real Madoka hates Homura.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>it seems like homu would be the most dominant, but im nearly certain madoka would be the one on top.. just look at this smug, this is the face of a backdoor destroyer</br></br>  <br>Is that a lie I hear? Sounds like it.<br><br>Of course it's fanfiction. Madoka isn't lewd like that.<br><br><br>Her innocence might be an act.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The lie is your image. Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  <br>I wonder what your tears taste like. I bet they're delicious.</br>  <br>You're right. Just look at my image. There was no love involved. Just  cheek rubbing. </br>  <br> innocence is an act <br>You just gave me an image of an alternate dimension Madoka who's dominating over a meek and submissive Homura, doing a nice footjob while being all smug of Homura's powerlessness.  Help </br></br>  <br>Why would you lie like that?</br>  Good night everyone. Never change /a/.  <br>that is lewd, forbidden lewd!</br>  <br>Goodnight</br>  <br>love that artist</br>  <br>What's wrong with them? The first two were just the show retold and I liked Rebellion.</br>  Tell me what it means, Madokafags. Last week, I woke up in the middle of the night with an intense desire to ship Homura with Madoka. I've never liked Homura, and always thought Madoka was bland, but this urge inside me could not be contained. Explain it to me so that I may understand.  <br>Wow, calm down.<br><br><br>Hitummy pls.<br><br><br>I don't know whether to like it or not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of their works are great.</br>  <br> hitummy <br><br>needs some explanation me feels</br></br></br>  <br>Madoka and Homura are meant for each other. They literally can't live without one another.</br>  <br>Don't think about it just embrace it</br>  <br><br><br>It's like...for just a few moments, I could feel what Homura felt. It wasn't love. It wasn't lust. It was...this deep and intense longing. It was very powerful. But why was I touched with such a thing? And at such a random time? I hadn't even been in any Madoka threads for months.</br></br></br>  <br>i want the green fiend to become the new enemy in s2.</br>  <br>Ai Yo</br>   muh fanbase! <br>You know what?<br>Only good fanbase is a non-existing fanbase</br></br>  <br>you now understand..</br>   <br> <br> <br>Because, !Akemi, it's obvious who you are for many reasons.<br>Not the least of which is that you always say the same shit and post the same pictures. Why you think it's so hilarious to constantly treat the characters like shit and spam crack I'll never know.<br><br>What I do know is that one of your very many obvious tells is that you always go "lol I would never be !Akemi ur crazy XD" while posting more crack. And constantly ignoring that actual issue, which is that you are treating the characters like shit. The fact you always dodge the same thing is the proof of who you are.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Aiyonai. I've felt love before, and that wasn't it. It was too subdued to be love.</br></br>  <br>I'll be disappointed if she doesn't at least become a Mahou shoujo.</br>  <br>What about the touhou fanbase?</br>  <br>I just found the full one. Hahahaha.<br><br><br>She was totally like the high school drama enemy of Sayaka. Not withstanding Homura being a complete dick, and Sayaka threatening to break people's arms. And Madoka being the most useless bff, and Mami being smug. Seriously. "Everyone's an Asshole" the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128088928 <br>I don't think they're dead, they were banished however.</br>  <br>What you felt is probably slightly different for as you said, you didn't like them that much.</br>  <br><br>A quick thesaurus check tells me that what Homura feels for Madoka could probably be best called languishing. Yearning or pining would also work.</br></br>  <br>Except I'm not !akemi crack-kun</br>  <br>No tears only hate.<br><br><br>No love ther, Madoka was excited they all survived and Homura didn't fuck up.<br><br><br>It's true, Madoka never thought of Homura as good or special.<br><br><br>Don't come back.<br><br><br>You had a nightmare.<br><br><br>No they aren't.<br><br><br>Ew.<br><br><br>You had a nightmare.<br><br><br>Madoka would never do that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have yet to see this !Akemi person</br>  <br>fuck i love this guy, you got the full metal jacket one?</br>  <br><br>Doubtful it was a nightmare, since it was happening while I was awake.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh look. You did EXACTLY what I said you would do.<br><br>Say "no waaaay I would never be !Akemi" while dismissing the actual point of the argument. Which is how you spam crack and treat the characters like shit.<br><br>And it totally a coincidence you show up at the exact same time as your other persona "fake homuhater." </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka was happy with Homura. The exite was before the fight.<br><br>Withoit Homura there wouldn't be a Madoka. They are very meant for each other.<br><br>Yet she did.<br><br><br>You'd rather not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't remember the dream and it left you reeling, confused. The truth is Homura doesn't deserve Madoka and Madoka never loved her. She wants rid of her.</br>  <br> If I randomly accuse someone of being someone else they shouldn't deny it <br><br>You're like the ultimate shitposter</br></br></br>  <br>Why not?<br><br>But I'm not !Akemi your argument is with that person not me</br></br></br>  <br>I want to say you're !Akemi playing stupid.<br>But there aren't enough tells in your post to make it probable.<br><br>But my instinct rarely lets me down. So I'll go with "you're pretending not to be !Akemi so you can try and fool other people in the thread into think it's actually rare for !AKemi to be here and try to promote the agenda it's not obvious who you are." <br><br>But this one is just a guess based on instinct.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Madoka is happy without Homura. Homura brings her pain and suffering. It's canon Madoka never valued her.</br>  <br>Swallow 13 episode series that too many people try to say is super awesome. The art is nice but that's about all the good I can say about it.</br>   not ignoring shitposts  <br>That's the problems here</br>  <br><br>Yup, now I'm sure it's you. Because now you're posting from your phone at the same time to try and make it look like you're two people.<br><br>But again the main tell is that you always dismiss the actual argument. Not just that you're stupid enough to think that "I would never lie over the internet" has any weight.<br><br>Keep spamming crack and keep proving what a shitposter you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka said so while being naked with Homura.<br><br> &gt;implying spoiler is said scene </br></br></br>  <br>I am posting on phone but I'm at work so I have no access to a computer for another 6 hours</br>  <br>Like I said Rebellion confirmed it was a lie said out of altruism.</br>  <br>Because you would never lie. Nope. You wouldn't do that at all. Each time you say "I would never do X" just further proves exactly who you are because not many retards are dumb enough to keep making the same mistake over and over.</br>  <br> what is self moderation <br>If you don't tell off shitposters no one will. And then they will stay here. That's the problem.</br></br>  <br>No confirmation friend, just love</br>  <br>But your accusing me and another anon of being !Akemi</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128089596 <br>Wow wow wow easy there, paranoia-kun, I'm not the other shitposter, I just randomly found this picture in my folder so I wanted to share some soothing friendship on this shitposted thread.<br><br>You're not bettering the situation either.</br></br></br>  <br><br>These were posted right away.<br>It's like you're showing everyone that you're indeed samefagging.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's canon Madoka never loved her.

Get kill and become undead <br>2. Become an experiment for Demiurge<br>3. Become meats for the maids</br></br></br></br>  <br>Define " Become meats for the maids"</br>  <br>I think it's pretty obvious</br>  <br>Entoma is eating a human arm that was fried as if it were shrimp, what do you think it means?<br><br> I would like to become food for CZ2128. </br></br></br>  <br>Are we talking about sex or you becoming their literal food?</br>  <br>The image isn't clear enough?</br>  How exactly does Albedo plan to  bone  Momonga if he's got no benis? He doesn't appear to have an interest in obtaining one, either.  <br>If there's a crazy will there is an extremely fucked up way.</br>  <br>stop looking at me like that donut</br>  <br>Albedo is likely in for the long term, if she reserts herself as the top female in Nazarick she's in a good position for when Ainz does think about an heir, the issue of Ding can be resolved then.</br>  <br>You want to become machine oil?</br>  From previous thread.<br>Funi sub rip: http://pastebin.com/43X55q7x<br>Raws: http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>11746</wbr></br></br>  <br>Everyone in Nazarick believes the supreme beings to be gods, so they don't bother trying to apply logic with them.<br><br>Plus Ainz could always just wish for one with a spell.</br></br></br>  <br>Majyyck pOnOs<br><br>Secret 20th rank magic</br></br></br>  <br>well he could technically just become regular oil and then go through whatever crafting methods they have in Nazarick to become machine oil. How about anon, do you know a good swamp you want to die in?</br>  <br>I'll oil her up, alright.<br><br> But seriously, it's probably the option with the least amount of pain if we're assuming slavery after death is unending torment. You don't want to be one of Demiurge's "two-legged sheep", or eaten by Solution. <br> Yuri is the other safe option, but she'd probably eat you out of loyalty. </br></br></br></br>  <br>in order of safety by maids it would likely go<br>Shizu&gt;Yuri&gt;Nabel&gt;Lupus&gt;Entoma&gt;Solut<wbr>ion</wbr></br></br>  I really like how they are doing Albedo's reactions.  <br>I thought Lupus was supposed to be extremely cruel? I also heard that while Entoma's favorite food is humans, she doesn't really care enough to harm humans if she's full and they don't bother her.</br>  <br>What is Albedo exactly? I think I may have zoned out if he did say what she is or not.</br>  <br>Imp</br>    <br><br>Not going to lie I thought she was like a human dragon hybrid or something. Didn't expect and imp.</br></br>  <br>Well she's got 20 levels in some other things too.</br>  <br>From what I can tell, Imp is sort of like the "base" for the other demonic races. If I'm, remembering right she also has levels in succubus and other stuff.</br>  <br>imp's likely one of her lower racial levels, the shown levels aren't all of them. She has mentioned having succubus blood so there's a least another 10 there. Anybody recall what the higher tier for a sucubutt would be?</br>  <br>What do humans taste like? I've always wondered because despite the moralfaggotry with eating a human it should be no different since humans are different from animals.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=21R<wbr>WUIFHD_s</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Similar to Pork iirc</br>  <br>If I remember it's similar to pig</br>  <br>IIRC some scientist guys documented on the taste of human flesh, don't remember any of the details for it though.</br>   all these people debating who Momonga will fug <br>He put his first ring on the best  boy_  already.</br>  <br>He won't fuck anyone. He is a skeleton. He has no penis.</br>  <br>Oh he has a penis alright.<br><br>Mare's. Right through here.</br></br></br>  So after gauging people's reactions here and there, I think it's almost to safe to say that the only people who didn't complain about the pacing are light novel readers.<br><br>Why do people want to see meaningless action so badly?</br></br>  <br>She's a Succubutt Blackguard.</br>  <br>He has 8 fingers and two thumbs as well as an large pool of magical powers. Trust me, a penis isn't needed.</br>  <br>A magic caster's staff has a knob on the end<br><br>This should be thread theme of Overlord generals</br></br></br>  <br>Stop being so lewd guys.</br>  <br>All D&amp;D fags know that Create Penis is only a 5th lvl spell so he can most likely even do Create Greater Dragon Penis by now.</br>  So how come vampire was engaging in airborne magical fisticuffs with papabones in the OP?  <br>It's a thing that creates a lot of division.<br>Some people prefer world building, character development, interactions, etc.<br>Others prefer fast paced action.<br><br>For me it's all about world building, I just want to know more about the characters and their motivations, the world they inhabit, etc.<br>Kinda how log horizon (anime) has shit battles, and the raids are pretty fucking boring unless there's some exposition going on, but the world and characters are pretty cool.<br><br><br>He could cast a penor, why not.<br>Or use some spell to change appearance for a while. It's not unheard of.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the vampire.</br>  <br>I want to become Shalltear's sex slave.</br>  <br>Either read the LN, or wait on the Anime. I'm not going to spoil anything.</br>  <br>Look at the blushing gorilla</br>  <br>Well, since Arche  is no longer there , she has an opening.</br>  Will we be seeing lots of Shalltear in the future as well?<br><br>Will the maids be big side characters as well? I have a soft spot for "elite squads" of characters.</br></br>  Wait, it just occurred to me. is Ninya's sister  Toile ?  <br>Yes to both.</br>  <br>Checked the archives, some anons say it's more similar to veal than pork. Nobody says it tastes bad though.</br>  <br> slowbonek.jpg </br>      <br>It's a failing of mine.</br>  <br> Will we be seeing lots of Shalltear in the future as well? <br>Haha you have no idea.</br></br>  <br>But only two of them eat humans.</br>  i dont like how the oversexualize albedo in the OP  <br> Will the maids be big side characters as well? <br><br>Only best maid Narberal.</br></br></br>  <br>Momonga is a good role player.</br>  <br> Sense of Justice -500 <br>But he saves people all the time, Touch Me must have had a heck of an influence on him</br></br>  <br>so, the funimation version is still shit?</br>  <br> literally retarded <br> best anything </br></br>  <br> But he saves people all the time <br>Only when it suits him. He saves people for a reason, not just to be nice. I think the only non-calculated impulse decision he made to save people was the very first time he did it.</br></br>  <br>Even then, that was only because of Sebas.</br>  <br>Even then it was kind of justified because he needed information.</br>  <br>Ah right. Sebas was like "if you won't, I will" so he decided to do it himself. And then ended up turning the situation to his advantage anyway.</br>  <br>a cute retard.</br>  <br>He's also a former human and proper member of society, so while the -500 and being a Lich influences him hella hard, he's very open to sparing anyone if they have even a remote semblance of value to Nazarick.</br>  Threadly reminder that Shalltear is the best girl  <br>No that wasn't the case. Sebas was going to leave them be, but his expression and face reminded Ainz of Touch Me, and nostalgia was what influenced Ainz to take action.<br><br>Sebas wouldn't dare do shit once his master says fuck em.</br></br></br>  <br>Part of that is also him being very shrewd and thinking in the long term. Like the deal with the herbalist lady. He foresaw the need of developing new potions since his existing stock will eventually run out and they might not be able to replace them, so he jumped on the chance to snag an herbalist and put her entirely in his control.</br>  <br> Traitor </br>  <br><br> He sent in 5000 troops to kill hundreds of lizard men so Cyoctus could learn how to think. </br></br>  <br>Haven't read the books but wasn't that magically influenced</br>  Why on earth would Funi not translate "Otoko no ko" into trap? They've never even shown a willingness to leave things in their original language so why now?  <br>Ah, this just reminds me  WN Arche . If only her stupid group member in the LN hadn't angered Ainz.</br>  <br>Maybe they have some new translator who spergs out about MUH ORIGINAL MEANING, MUH CULTURE. The last episode had the whole bitch=slut screw up too.</br>  <br> Not Solution Epsilon. <br>Discarded taste.</br></br>  Alright do y'all nigga enjoy this episode? <br> I do </br>  <br>Look at this faggot, can't appreciate the greatness of Narbel</br>  I'll take the undead over being slowly melted by slime bitch or flayed forever by demiurge. I'll at least be mercifully slain when used as fodder against lizardmen or something.  <br>Really. Looks like the best deal you can get in this story is to be right quick.  Gazef  had it pretty good then.</br>  <br>CUTE<br>U<br>T<br>E</br></br></br></br>  <br>Funi always has that one instance where they make really weird choices.</br>  I want to befriend the maids and stay alive somehow. What do?  <br><br>I don't understand funi, shows more weeb than this get localized more, but in overlord they partially leave honorifics.</br></br>  <br>That's because they are lizardmen, not humans. He still has attachments to his old life as a human.<br><br>That said, those things dry up real fucking quick once he's exposed to the humanity of this new world. While people like the village elder and Enri are favorable in his eyes, the vast majority of shitlords that mess with him take away whatever sliver of consideration he has when it's already negligible to begin with. He could have easily just knocked out Iguva's group and taken only Iguva for a corpse and leave the other innocents out, but just by being in the same group as the faggot they are dead. In contrast he saves the girls at the village when he could have just asked his questions then left them for dead and taken their corpses later. It's not like he was gonna get exposed and objectively there was no merit to saving Enri at that point. It was even written that he felt something for her protecting her sister.</br></br></br>  If I opened up sadpanda how many doujins will I see have momonga shoving up his boner in best girl?  <br>They put effort into being terrible, it's their trademark.</br>  <br><br>Stop being human. <br><br><br><br>None, right now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> calls her a traitor <br> was controlled by a world class item <br><br>How long is this shit argument against Shalltear going to go on</br></br></br></br>   Momonga practicing Overload poses in the mirror. <br>What a moe villain.</br>  <br>It's the logic of the industry.<br><br> Weeb shit? LOCALIZE HARD  <br> Western shit/ Well it's already localized enough by being western stuff, so let's be lazy! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Till Shalltear drinks herself into oblivion for going against Ainz-sama.</br>  <br>fuck,any pixiv ones?</br>  <br><br>He even rolls on his beds when he is tired, just to find Albedo's smell all over the place.</br></br>  <br>There's a few naughty pics, mostly of Albedo and one poor Mare.</br>  <br> In contrast he saves the girls at the village when he could have just asked his questions then left them for dead and taken their corpses later. <br>He could have but didn't because Touch Me's giant ass ballsacks were smacking him in the head.</br></br>  <br>Well yes, but  the magic behind it got fucked up due to Shalltear killing the caster at the time it was cast. The end result was that her behavior got reset to that of an MMO mob in that she aggroes on things that attack her. Ainz initiated combat and she was compelled to fight back to the best of her ability even if no one was actually controlling her. <br>Something like that, if memory serves.</br></br>  <br> people thinking he gave Mare and Albedo the teleportation rings just out of the goodness of his heart. <br>Sure but it wasn't the main reason. Has he even done something with no strings attached or no benefits at all?</br></br>  <br><br> Just throwing a bone at you. <br> http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51416884</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br> Caster aint dead. She's critically injured </br>  <br> Has he even done something with no strings attached or no benefits at all? <br>Pat Mare's head.</br></br>  <br>Demiurge will help him figure it out.<br><br>As well, maybe Ainz will have to temporarily take on a more fleshy humanoid form and bone Albedo.<br><br>He did have a few monsters that at least have muscle-mass on their otherwise skeletal frames, so he could possibly give himself some magic muscle and skin and go all out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was under the influence of a world class item<br><br>Fucking get over it<br><br>She wouldn't betray him of her own accord unless her creator came back and for some retarded reason wanted to stand against bones</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> special potion to give momonga a dick <br> special potion to turn momonga into a   generic faceless hentai MC <br> special potion to give momonga a tentacle dicks to impregnate everyone   including cocytus <br>This is not hard</br></br></br></br>    <br>What does pure-virgin succubus pussy juice smell like?</br>  <br>what about a potion that turns him into a grill with a dick?</br>  <br><br>All I can think about it, is how will the child turn out? Will the baby carry the genetic material of the once Human overlord?<br><br>Also I would very much like if Albedo were to have a girl she ends up turning completely different from her mother, as in a calm gentle girl who even likes humans and plays with them.<br><br><br><br>Like flowers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Does Ainz ever find out and take the World Item from her cold, dead corpse? </br>  <br>How does bones smell? He doesn't have a nose.</br>  <br> To busy with Blood Emperor to invade the South yet but he knows they're alive. </br>  <br>He's in an anime</br>  I've had the OP on repeat all day <br><br>Help</br></br>  <br>Why does he even have a bed? You'd think it would be a coffin or something.</br>  KOTAE WA DOKO EEEEEIIEEEEEIIIEEEE  <br>It's relaxing for him, but I do think he has a coffin.<br>Anyone remembers where did they put  his skull after the big fight </br></br>  <br>Because Touch Me wanted a bed.</br>  <br>Why?<br><br>He doesn't get tired</br></br></br>  <br>Because shut up</br>  <br>To set his respawn point, silly.</br>   the cute twin is a trap <br>dropped</br>  <br>He doesn't even know they are from the Theocracy.</br>  <br>Maybe due to magic, the child will take after the flesh parent, in this case Albedo, Shaltear, and Aura (someday she'll be the 3rd member), maybe some of the maids as well, but inherit his or her father's higher magic power.<br><br>In fact, I'd guess that the child would always be female, given that the only flesh parents available are female, but the degree of magic they would inherit from Ainz would vary.<br><br>Albedo's child might become an incredible tank (able to use immense magic to boost her own abilities inherited from Albedo).<br><br>Shaltear's child might either become well-balanced or hilariously overpowered (her parents' strengths and few weaknesses, given Shaltear having been proficient in the few things that could actually harm Ainz).<br><br>Aura's child will definitely be a powerful summoner and tamer. Even if her beast pets die, she could resummon them as undead. She'd probably also have the highest magic pool if assuming that Aura's Dark Elf race sticks to RPG convention and has naturally high mana reserves.<br><br>I do wonder if he'd also be permitted or would bother to screw some of the maids and impregnate them as well (the ones that are likely to be able to reproduce, that is. After all, the Guardians themselves said it'd be odd for Ainz to only have one or two wives).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The girlish one is a trap <br> The boyish one is a reverse trap <br>How can you not love this</br></br></br>  <br>I certainly do</br>  <br>Wait the other one actually is a girl? Wow.</br>  <br>Shalltear can tank too</br>  <br> reverse trap <br>You meant tomboy.</br></br>  <br> I do wonder if he'd also be permitted <br> permitted <br><br>Is not like anyone would oppose Ainz. But maybe his future daughters would get jealous of her father being with several woman. <br><br>That's it if he can get his libido back in the forst place.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aura is a girl though<br><br>The ugly one, Mare, is the trap silly</br></br></br>  <br>the only reason she can do that is because of spiut Lance, she takes damage way too fast.</br>    Excuse me, best girl coming through<br><br> This picture makes me want to die in a corner because shalltear will never be my true vampire girlfriend and give me undead children and be the best thing ever </br></br>  I want to join them and play with Aura and Mare all day.  <br>But you're a Humie.</br>  <br>You don't play with mare and aura<br><br>Mare and Aura play with you</br></br></br>  <br>That's due to her magic lance though; otherwise, she has limited magic reserves and has the issue of not being able to use most weapons. Her child however, would likely be able to offset that weakness with some level of magic item creation, on top of a larger magic reserve.<br><br>Speaking of, I do wonder if the children would end up being loyal only to Ainz, or Ainz first, or to their mother's and their mother's creators, in the priority list.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure a human from Ainz' world would get an exception</br>  <br>Ainz doesn't let any humies into Naz outside of the one human NPC</br>  <br>Moe as fuck.</br>  <br>Why would the prioritize one parent over the other unless they just started favouring one along the way?</br>  N-Nice face...  <br><br> Implying Ainz's little girls wont be all over his bones. </br></br>  <br>A fake shit</br>  <br>You could be right; there probably would only be maybe 3 heirs (2 for sure).<br><br>I can see it: Albedo's daughter, both best sister and at the same time worst rival to Shaltear's daughter, while Aura's daughter (who's not going to be around for so many more years until Aura matures), is spoiled and treated well by both older sisters (although they might use her to try and say who's the better older sister at times).<br><br>Still it would be funny if Ainz also took a maid or two; because the younger sister didn't want to be lonely in her age bracket.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>[Craziness Intensifies]</br>  <br><br>Man I can see those little runts making uncle Cocytus's life hell.</br></br>  <br>Best expression so far.</br>  why is the framerate of this show so bad?  <br><br>Your GPU is not powerful to render Ainz properly.</br></br>  <br>All he needs is the dick for purely practical purposes. The characters that want to fuck him want to fuck the big skeleton him. They think he's sexy.</br>  Why is Cocytus so best?  <br>He'd probably do the whole maid squad.<br><br><br>It's a bad port.</br></br></br></br>  Why no one likes her?  <br>There's a difference between the thread you link and any other /c/ thread. These are:<br><br>- /cm/ thread is a general thread<br>This means the topic at hand is a lot broader, it's an Evangelion general not a Kaworu general or any other character general. The Rei /c/ thread is a thread for Rei, just like the Asuka one is on /c/. The discussion in those threads should stay on topic of Rei.<br>/a/ is used for general discussion of all characters and the story/plot.<br><br>To quote the sticky:<br> Finally, as much as /a/ is a discussion board, /c/ is a board for sharing images. <br><br>It's not really a discussion board, but there's plenty of discussion to begin with.<br><br>- There is currently nothing to discuss concerning Rei Ayanami in Rebuilds or spinoffs<br>Unless you want to drone on about how everything is pointless, simply being appreciative of Rei is the less turbulent way to go. I'm sure we can agree here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a reason why you ignored the very beginning posts of my case, the very beginning of the argument? Is there a reason why I linked back to it in every other response to you? Is there a reason why I still have yet to receive a reply?<br><br>The answer to all these questions is an unfortunate yes, you mentally deficient manchild.</br></br></br>  <br>the /c/ OPs always say there is an encouragement of Rei discussion. And yet there never is any. Reifags don't care about discussing her, or any other part of Eva or its characters. They only care about fapping to how kawaii she is and complaining about meta shit. Pathetic.<br><br>The fact that your entire 'love' and obsession for her relies on something simple like her gender and ability to whiteknight her only proves you don't even really love or care for her in the first place. Get rekt, autist.</br></br></br>  <br> No, those are literally the only ones from that thread. <br>https://fgts.jp/cm/thread/2959138/#<wbr>q2960761<br><br>Have another one. There's plenty more.<br><br>Just pick any thread.<br>https://fgts.jp/cm/thread/2959138/#<wbr>2960579<br><br>There's bound to come up something in every one of them, it's the same sort of victim-complex about EVA-geeks. Wouldn't be surprised if that poster is you, although I'm not saying it is.<br><br> Meta about Rei Q is not discussion. It's just more complaining about Rebuild because that's all you retarded faggots can muster. <br>It's discussing the original Rei in the context of the new, that is discussion.<br><br>It IS complaining, but if you can take away your hateboner a little bit, isn't the complaining justified?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Because she loves being an Eva pilot and wants everyone to recognize she is one. Wearing the headset is her way of flaunting it. She still takes them off when showering and sleeping.</br>  NEXT G<br>http://g-tekketsu.com/</br>  <br>1 bong</br>  <br>4 OVAs.
