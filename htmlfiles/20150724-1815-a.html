[ Why do you guys hate me so much?  <br>Because someone has to, and no one in your shitty show does.</br>  Bc your a shit from a show, that is also a shit.  <br>Just hope this thread dies so I don't have to look at that hideous face anymore.</br>  <br>Because you dual-wield swords</br>  <br>Because your very presence steals other people's agency.</br>  <br><br>because you're a faggot</br></br>  <br>Because SAO fucking sucked 8 dicks. <br><br>It was pretty interesting for the first quarter of the anime and then i realized, Fuck this. How am i supposed to self-insert myself into a beta position where I get all the girls? Not to mention, an introspective emo ex-hikkikomori beta who gets a harem with gorgeous girls that play video games? <br><br>It didn't happen in highschool, didn't happen in college. It just doesn't happen. <br><br>This anime made me face reality with its setting that was pretty similar to ours, a futuristic technology that scientists are already starting to venture into. Instead of implementing fantastical elements into it, it places itself directly into my fantasies and crushes it because of my cruel experience in real life. <br><br>Not to mention, everything after the original game was fucking retarded. Why would you jump off a 50 floor building onto the face of your enemy just to shoot a sniper rifle? The purpose of a sniper rifle is so you can shoot it from faraway. <br><br>Also, he chose the wrong fucking girl. Asuna is a very poorly conceived character. She starts super dan but then becomes not kuu. She then becomes tsun as fuck but then decides to not be tsun. Instead, she chooses to become super-yan as she was retardedly confined to a hospital bed for the majority of the second half of the first season. <br><br>Girls, in real life, are already full of shit and take stupid shit to extremes. I don't want to watch it in my animes as well. <br><br>I mean, I'm not THAT fond of incest but even the fucking cousin would have been a better choice than Asuna.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know who the fuck you are.<br><br>Kirito, on the other hand, is a poorly written character in a show that stayed long past its expiration date.</br></br></br></br>  <br>" I should warn you. I have a tiny bulletproof shield the exact size of a bullet, somewhere on my body. And if you hit it, I'll be unharmed and your plan will be foiled. You'll be the laughing stock of me."</br>  <br> Why would you jump off a 50 floor building onto the face of your enemy just to shoot a sniper rifle? <br><br>do you even fucking trickshot you scrub</br></br></br>  <br>You're cool in Alicization.I liked how you and eugeo got rekt by the minister.</br>   128504102 <br> Deformed ears <br> Wears only black and gray <br>You really need to ask?</br></br></br>  <br>Why would I like an edgy dual-wield black coated swordman gary-stu shit character?</br>  <br>Batman is one of the most popular characters ever.</br>  <br><br>Because you're not real.<br><br>And the girl you gave your globs of semen to is not real either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because your white Haired clone has a better harem and isn't a edgelord.</br>  <br><br> hatin` the post <br><br>u mad jelly of Kirito right now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you remind me of those shitty fanfics that I wrote when I was 14.</br>  Pretty simple.  <br> animes </br>  <br>Because a fatass neckbeard can teabag you.</br>  <br>game is VR is called SWORDart online only one person can use dual wielding or a shield implying that already is not a retarded concept for a game making economically not viable why would you limit your potential to attract more faggots when your whole point is to take people hostage so instead you give a single faggot the ability because he has the fastest reaction making him a special snow flake when his only special ability is to hold 2 sticks and use them in combat when the game is called sword art</br>  <br>because you remind me of my high school days</br>  Did she survive?  nope, there were only three survivors at the end of the joestar story.  <br>An encounter with a black man? No one can survive that!</br>  MONKEY TROUBLE  Nope.  monkey dicks are pretty small  No turning back now.    Miki's breakdown comes when they find a cure after Kurumi has already turned and been killed by Miki. Leaving only Yuki who's still sane<br><br>Just wait for it</br></br>  Shh gurachos are  durmiendo   Rii-san a beautiful  If only Megu-nee were here.<br><br>If only.</br></br>  Needs more memes.  Is it just me, or did the anime look a lot better in this episode than the past two?    <br>ETA for chapter 38 raws?</br>    <br>What are you talking about? Megu-nee is alive and well</br>  <br>ayayay</br>  <br>Wait, is this not just a slice-of-life moe shit?<br><br>Someone give me a better summary than the one-liners anime fan sites post.</br></br></br>  <br> Kill yourself </br>  Episode 3 basically proved definitively that this is a good adaptation, I think. A great episode for newcomers and manga readers alike. I almost cried  <br>Is it normal to be physically aroused by Rii's crazy expressions?<br><br>I think I'm developing a new fetish thanks to this series.</br></br></br>  <br>What's Kurumi doing to Mii-kun?</br>  <br>Why does that butthole have eyes?</br>  <br>sure, i just need you to kill yourself first</br>  <br>Just watch episode 1. You can afford 24 minutes, right?</br>  You will never make Kurumi feel this way about you.  <br>That's fair. Done deal.</br>  If shovel dies, I riot.  <br>Better stock up on pitchforks</br>  So the first episode takes place after Miki joined? I had actually thought they retconned it so that Miki was there all along, but now I see that they're just introducing pieces in a different order.<br><br>Man this adaptation is fucking great.</br></br>  Yuki says she's going home.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong at all.</br>  <br>First two episodes were okay, only the third episode was great.</br>  <br>I thought that was obvious with the mention of the mall.</br>  <br>Tell her that the School Living club lives in the school and tell her to recite the code of the club</br>  <br> If shovel dies, I rot. <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br> Take her hat and burn it. It's a stupid hat. And rip out her side hairs. </br>  <br> Watching Kurumi falling for her first love <br>This episode is too much for me.</br></br>  <br>Tell Megu-nee about it.</br>  <br> And rip out her side hairs. <br>H-how could you?</br></br>  <br> Positions her hand so that perverts can't get a peek at her panties <br>The purest</br></br>  Did they change the OP this episode? I was really hoping for more zombies but i couldnt tell.  <br>What can a corpse do?</br>  <br>Zombies only dies when their head are crushed/severed as far as I remember so she's pretty safe.</br>  <br><br>Watch the whole thing though. It's imperative that you watch until the end.</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? Megu-nee is not a corpse! She's diejobu!</br>  <br><br>Wait until Megu-nee dies. When they show the reveal of her face in the OP it'll be half-rotten.</br></br>  <br>It's a psychological zombie apocalypse dude, the first episode is all the delusions of the MC until they reveal the zombie twist.</br>  mall next week<br><br>hype or no hype?</br></br>  <br><br>Where the hell do those side hairs come out of anyway?</br></br>  <br>She's  Hungry </br>  how often do chapters come out  <br>Kei need some loving</br>  <br>Hyped for Kurumi visiting her house.</br>  <br>It's in one of the Manga Time Kiraras, so monthly. Chapter 38 is today.</br>  <br>I'd bet $5 they skip it.</br>  <br>Once a month</br>  What is it like being a zombie?  <br>aw sweet just caught up to 37</br>  <br>Ask Kurumi</br>  <br>Its monthly I think.</br>  <br>For the millionth time, monthly.<br><br>I hope they don't</br></br></br>  <br>Feels cold at times but it's okay.</br>  <br> tfw no senpai to keep her warm </br>  People think Yuki was bullied?<br><br>I think that's a little much. I think she was just a weirdo with no friends.</br></br>  <br>Yuuri is the cutest.</br>  So just re-read some of the latest chapters and my mind started going places.<br><br> I think Rii-san used Yuki as an accomplice to help her with her self delusions. <br>The first 2 pages of chapter 35, she has a conversation with her asking for something. Then it cuts ahead to the four of them reading the note from the elementary school. <br>It's set up to make it seem like the note was what she wanted to talk about, but I think she used the time earlier to convince Yuki to bring the bear along with them, so Rii could "discover" it later.</br></br> <br><br>I could be completely wrong, but there's more than enough to be suspicious about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck, that was the first scene that really made me cry.</br>  <br>Isolation is bullying, too.</br>  <br>Anon, you're a faggot.</br>  <br>Read between the lines.<br>It might not have been physical, but she clearly wasn't left alone.</br></br>  <br>People were laughing at her and talking shit behind her back. They said they felt sorry for Megu-nee for having to deal with her. Not only that, but Yuki appeared lonely and depressed. I think she was bullied, even if it was only lightly. Bullying is more than hiding her shoes, drawing on her desk, and insulting her to her face.</br>  <br>Holy shit thank you<br>At least I'm not the only one who's thinking this</br></br>  <br>I suppose it is. It kinda reminds me of those sad Lucky Star comics: pointing out that a cutesy strange girl would probably be ostracized in real life.</br>  <br>I know I am, but watching her curl up in her bed after her family has (presumably) turned... I couldn't take it.</br>  <br><br>Shit, that actually makes sense anon<br> FUCK a lot of sense </br></br></br>  <br>What bothers me is that it feels clearly made for 400x(400+90) but not only that the blue background is 91 px. high, it's also pushed up by 1 px., showing that ridiculous white line underneath. Goddammit whoever made that one Atelier Totori pic I copied.<br> Triggered. <br> Right after I hit Post in the previous thread, my OCD knew I fucked up. </br></br></br>  <br>Man up and be her replacement senpai.</br>  I want to protect that   hat    <br>fuck, man.</br>  <br>That sounds really stupid though. Why would she do that? It's not like they'd have known no one would be at the school either. This whole thing does seem suspicious though.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>Would you swim with drunken Gurachos?</br>  <br><br>Part of it was because of the hat. Why does she even wear the hat? She looks better without it.</br></br>  <br>I would if I could. But we're separated by dimensions.</br>  <br>While it does make sense, I can't help but stop and think: Why would Yuki agree? Why would Yuuri want to do something like that?<br><br>Just why?</br></br></br>  <br>It's cute</br>  <br>She's chuuni.</br>  <br>She's just crazy. If anyone's chuuni, Kurumi is.</br>  <br>It's cute AND she's childish as fuck. Even Megu-nee said that she acted too much like a little kid.</br>   Want to read the manga. <br> Norway scans. Translated by AP. <br> Fuck this, I'll read raws. <br> no raws of first few chapters on senmanga. <br><br>Suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>    So, we finally learned that senpai had already.graduated. When will we learn about the different colored uniforms for students in the same year?  OP or ED?  <br>She's also reverse chuuni.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mqQ<wbr>8Y9Sjp7o</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>gakkou_gurashi.avi</br></br>  Post Megu-nee  <br>Like 3 weeks ago<br>It's symbolism</br></br>  <br>I was under the impression that only Yuki and the zombified students that she believes are alive have the blue-colored uniform, while everyone else has the white/green one.</br>  <br>Or, what if everyone is crazy? <br>Like, what if Kurumi, Yuuri and Miki started a zombie survival club, spurred on by their fandom of zombie media and the like, and this is the result of overactive imaginations on their part? They started out harmless enough; playing survival games at school, and recruiting one lesser-enthusiastic girl, Yuki. All is fine and well, until one day one of the girls goes too far and kills a "zombie", one of their classmates. The school is instantly thrown in a panic, and evacuated. The girls take this as a zombie invasion, and begin their process of boarding up the school to protect themselves. The police quickly arrive at the scene to apprehend the girls, but their traps and violent demeanor render the situation too dangerous and risky for standard police to interject.<br>We then learn, with time, that the girls were secretly apart of an underground cult that values purity and innocence above all else, living in a world of near-perpetual corruption. They kidnapped a girl, Yuki, and brought her to a place where no one would intrude and poison their rituals, an abandoned school. The girls keep Yuki here in order to develop an object of purity worthy of their worship. The zombies/police are actually agents of a secret organization, determined to keep corruption spread, and eliminate innocence entirely. Soon, the agents start infiltrating the base, to retreive Yuki for corruption, and eliminate the other gurashis.</br></br></br>  <br>ED<br><br>The OP only worked for me with episode 1 and kinda for 2. I was hoping it'd be changed to something more overall appropriate to the series</br></br></br>  <br>One day you'll be able to meet her.</br>  <br>All is not over yet, however, as it turns out that actually this is the stage of a hit reality television show gone completely wrong, where three actors bring in an unsuspecting girl and see if she can live a cutesy school life while three actor girls are pretending to protect her. The show is a hit; sweeping across japan, and the three actors that chaperone yuki start developing rabid fans. One subsect of those fans, one would argue rightfully the most extreme, is a trio of girls who look up to the three actors in an almost obsessive way. Overwhelmed by this obsession they break onto the set of the show one night while they're sleeping, and kill them in their sleep. They then pull off immaculate cosplays of their heroes, and live as the idols they'd loved so dearly, while no one is all the wiser. Well, almost no one.<br>Eventually, the other extreme fans notice slight character changes in the "new" Gurashis; no one is perfect at pretending to be someone else, after all. Conspiracies develop that question the legitimacy of the girls, and soon a sect is developed to capture them and reveal to the world their illegitimacy. A rogue faction of fans tries to break into the set, as the three super-fans once did, but these three thought ahead; they fought back against the otaku, until they were eventually forced to retreat. Not to take the situation lightly, the fans devised a plan; let in a dog, bugged with a microphone, to spy on the girls. This would work well, as the girls are known to hold fondness for small dogs. A dog is gathered for the operation. It's small, so it should be harmless. Or so they thought.</br></br>  <br>That's real stupid</br>  <br>The dog was actually one they found as a stray. It seemed peaceful, though almost weak, so they captured it for the mission. Little did they know, however, that a few nights earlier, the dog had been bitten by a rat with a strange disease, and was afflicted as well. This showed in its steadily increasing rage upon being caged and transported to the school with a group of elite fans. The moment they released the dog, it viciously turned and attacked its owners. It bit and scratched every one of them, before eventually sucumbing to its own illness and dying on the spot. They decided to abandon the mission and implement a secondary plan of some sort. They went home that night, defeated, and slightly nauseous.<br>It didn't take long for the disease to spread through Japan's dense population. One by one people were killed and brought back, until all that remained were few secluded factions. This is the story of one such faction. A group of girls whose dreams became reality.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah but in the flashback other kids had her uniform color</br></br>  <br>What is that expression supposed to be?</br>  Is it wrong fapping to the garashis?  <br><br> No </br></br>  <br>It won't be the same.</br>  I know zombie survival isn't the main point of the show but holy fuck are these people inept. They're up against easy mode zombies that move slow as shit, how have they not cleared at least the school building of zombies and locked the doors so more can't wander in  <br>No, wait, I've got it!<br><br>Yuki is real.<br> The other girls are puppets! </br></br></br></br>  My friend told me to get into this because it was LITERALLY MADOKA XXDDD.<br><br>It's not Madoka, but in some ways I think it's more disturbing. There's this real quiet sense of despair, which waves and wanes but overall seems to be building up.. It's pretty spooky.</br></br>  <br>And don't forget that forshadoing, the teddy bear and the helicopter</br>  <br>They're like 14.</br>  Nice touch showing Megu-nee's location at the end of the ep.  <br>They're like 17</br>  <br>Second and third year high schoolers. 16-18 years old.</br>  <br>I had already completed around 4 call of duties when I was at that age.</br>  <br> holy fuck are these people inept <br><br>No shit, only one person in their group carries a weapon even though there should be plenty of baseball bats and materials to make weapons laying around.</br></br></br>  Will they show Megu-nee's suffering next episode? Until some real suffering i won't be really satisfied with the anime  <br>Why do you want to see cute innocent girls suffer?</br>  <br>They should've literally been able to clear the school grounds by now.<br><br>Just lure the zombies to the wall and drop shit on their heads from the rooftop</br></br></br>  <br>I don't want suffering. I want everything to stay daijobu for a few more weeks.<br><br>Everything has to be daijobu ;_;</br></br></br>  Now this is the kind of Megu-nee I like  <br><br>Kurumi being forced to brutally beat her first love to death with a shovel coupled with Yuki's first breakdown wasn't suffering enough for you anon? I got a little choked up when Yuki ran over and hugged Kurumi and sobbed.</br></br>  <br>Megu-nee doesn't shower in the morning.<br><br>I thought all girls showered in the morning.<br><br>And that is the saddest breakfast I ever seen in anime.<br><br>Just cheap toasted bread with no butter, jam, or cheese in sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megu-nee a cute</br>  <br>That got me excited.<br><br>Fuck I'm a deviant.</br></br></br>  <br>The  alive  one?</br>  <br><br>Be careful not to cut yourself on those edges.</br></br>  <br> having time for breakfast </br>  <br>I most say that scene did shock me a little, no music, good camera works and sound, really nice, but that's just the tip, if they don't show Megune-nee reading the book then later on that "scene" won't be that much of a shock</br>  <br><br>Pretty sure most elevens in general don't shower in the morning. They take showers/baths at night before bed and then just wash their faces and get dressed in the morning. <br><br>If you think about it it's actually probably a better order of operations in many ways.</br></br></br></br>  <br>eric</br>  Hey hey Nozaki-kun!   You will never marry Megu-nee <br> She will never say "It's not Megu-nee, it's Sakura-sensei!" to you <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br>Why would I call my wife Sensei or Nee?</br>  So when are we getting Korean scans for chapter 38?  <br>Questionable hobby?</br>  When you see it  <br>Because you want to bully her.</br>  <br>The suffering in just getting started.</br>  <br>Because Onee-san and also this: </br>  what kind of shitty track team members can't outrun zombies  <br>Just a little translation.</br>  <br>THIS<br><br>The zombies are slow as fuck.<br><br>I can't believe the track team can't outran literal mindless retards.<br><br>It's like they never played Tag before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gotta kill as many people i can and as fast as i can, and peole woulnd't react that fast thinking "oh, its a zombie apocalypse!" only diehard zombie fans</br>  just caught up fuck im excited ep are they gonna adapt up to  <br>The ones that trip. Good fucking job, guy.</br>  <br>Oh, fuck you</br>  <br> Tfw when blue/green colorblind. <br> Tfw can't tell which ones are wearing blue and which ones are green. </br></br>  <br> Part of the track team <br> Trips on thin air <br>This is why they make certain people sit out</br></br></br>  <br>Would you Taroumaru her Brazilian flags?</br>  If rii is yuri then what is ruu?<br><br>yuru?</br></br>  <br>Everyone knows what a rabid dog looks like.<br><br>Normalfags know to stay away from people stumbling around which is why it is easy to react to zombies or drunk people.<br><br>Nobody in real life is gonna get close to someone walking weirdly much less touch them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If they're coming at you from multiple directions and you get cornered, then you're fucked.</br>  <br>They will if they're your friend, or if you're in the middle of practice and someone collapses and you think they might have heat stroke or something.</br>  <br>Japanese cold sure is a bitch</br>  I genuinely wonder how I'd act if I was caught in the middle of a zombie outbreak in a world where the concept of zombies didn't exist.  Two ways for zombies to be real and they'll be sprinting zombies no matter what in our future:<br><br>1. Advanced Mad Cow Disease or Rabies that evolved i.e. 28 Days/Weeks zombies<br>2. Nanobots in the far, far future where it kills the host from the inside and takes over to make your corpse go nuts</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck. I didn't come back to read this until it was done.<br><br>That was a mind rape of a twist. I didn't get why the halls were barricaded at first. But then I started to figure something was up.<br><br>This is dark as shit. I love it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd be more wary of truck-san</br>  <br> Zero ways for zombies to be real <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>Zombies don't have good coordination.<br><br>They are also easy to trip and push around.<br><br>Zombies are far less coordinated than Big Dog.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>FUCK OFF NO. Shovel will be diejobu.<br><br>R-Right? ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When you're panicking and there's ten zombies coming at you, you're not going to think straight.</br>  <br>I'm not stupid enough to touch someone that is collapsed even if they are my friend.<br><br>The first thing I would do is call 911 because in fiction and in real life, they always repeat to people to not touch someone that is collapsed and call for help, instead, because you could make the injury worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Seems all the females are laying down for their male classmates.</br>  <br>her ears. She is 90</br>  <br>  2. Nanobots in the far, far future where it kills the host from the inside and takes over to make your corpse go nuts <br>That's fucking Jason X<br><br><br>The only monster more dangerous than zombies and man</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But humans are the strongest when they are panicking.<br><br>The adrenaline rush makes you forget pain or fatigue and makes you capable of strength that you normally wouldn't be capable of using.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, anon.</br>  So i'm about to start this series, what i'm getting into?  What kind of zombies they are? 28 days ones? Resident Evil ones? Walking Dead ones?   <br>While a few people die every year, 99 percent of humans still survive Black Friday.<br><br>And Black Friday humans are way more dangerous than zombies.</br></br></br>  <br>Well most people will do the contrary and check on them if they are ok or something.</br>    <br>Pain and fatigue, yes.<br>"There's three thingies over there, two over there and one over there. I need to run this way, which is in the middle of them, to get away.<br><br><br>I don't have a proper reply for this. Have a cookie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just cute girls doing cute things, anon.<br> Romero type, except things don't add up somewhere. </br></br>  <br>They're walkers, but the focus isn't really on the zombies. Don't expect tons of zombie chopping action.</br>  <br> And Black Friday humans are way more dangerous than zombies. </br>  <br>No, most people will call 9-11 than touching an injured person. <br><br>You're not a doctor. <br><br>Who do you think you are?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The walking dead ones<br><br><br>Anon, you evil genius</br></br></br></br>  <br>The guy on the track looks headless. Did I see it?</br>  <br>It's just a slouch.</br>  <br> And Black Friday humans are way more dangerous than zombies. <br><br>Yeah, fighting over cheap made in [insert sweat shop country] products.</br></br></br>  <br>The brazilian shirt?</br>  How fucked would the School Life Club be if the zombies were 28 Days type?  <br>Then what was I supposed to see?</br>  <br>I love how you're generalizing<br><br>You're not a doctor.<br><br>Who do you think you are?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They would be already dead by now, those fucking monsters were unstoppable</br>  <br>In a situation I see someone sprawled across the ground, the first thing I'd do is get close first and ask if the guy is ok or something. What happens next depends.<br><br>I'd have to be really paranoid or careful to stay away a good distance the whole time without knowing the situation and call 9-11<br><br>And no I'm not a doctor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there wouldn't be a series</br>  <br><br>I wanted you guys to see a torso standing up but its shadow is the whole body. It tickled my fancy.</br></br>   Gakkou Gurashi   <br>Rii is sex, and so's her voice. Who voiced her anyway?</br>  <br>You have no idea. All it takes is one idiot to screw everything up. I once saw a guy get hit by a bus, and some guy just comes running and flips his body right side up, killing him in the process while asking if he's okay. People aren't as smart as you think.</br>  <br>M.A.O</br>  <br>I once almost stepped on a drunk guy sleeping in the movie theater parking lot and almost jumped backwards in the air in fright and just get the fuck out of there without wondering what the fuck was that guy doing there. <br><br>It made me regret not using the elevator and like I think I would have shat bricks if that guy just suddenly opened his eyes and looked at me.<br><br>This was at night too. Common sense would dictate not to stick around in weird situations.<br><br>I could have gotten body slammed by the drunk guy if I tried to ask if he was okay or not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ichimichi, Mao who also voiced pic related</br>  <br><br>Even as a medical worker and good Samaritan act protecting me, the only help I'll give to a collapsed person is calling an ambulance if no one does it. No more after that.</br></br>  <br>These aren't strangers though. These are friends and classmates in your school and club.</br>  <br>Based M.A.O.</br>  <br>I'd do the same, but I wouldn't touch the injured fuck. There's a difference between getting in talking distance and being in touching distance.</br>   Is Megu-nee dead?   <br>This is why Chinese people are so shitty.</br>  <br><br><br> also voiced Aoko and Vorona <br> looks this pretty <br><br>Holy wow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8/10, I kek'd</br>  <br> Are you? <br> You sure? </br></br>  <br>Of course not.</br>  <br>And what if you can't get through to an ambulance like in ep. 3? You just gonna let your friend sit there and die on the ground?</br>  <br>Her Kansai-ben is sex to listen too as well.</br>  <br>to*</br>  <br><br>Everyone ignores her existence except for hat.

It's almost  like I wish we'd go back to calling each other faggots like civilized people. Nowadays you go to any other board and it's "cuck cuck cuck" </br></br>  <br> No. But I respect the scat fetish shitters more than cuck faggots. </br>  <br> That's saying quite a lot.

They literally inject their fetish into everything. This might literally not be a thread in the last year or so that hasn't had some faggot spouting cuck, ironically or unironically. it was funny when it was about moot, but now the actual fetish faggots are out in full force and you cannot tell who's shitposting anylonger <br><br><br>Then I feel sorry for you.<br><br><br>Yes. Refer to: Moot's departure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    You guys are going to  love  this chapter.  <br>I hate the "cucks" shit, it's fucking everywhere and also people who say "kek". It's so stupid and I don't find any of it funny. I have a friend who says kek out loud all the fucking time, I physically cringe a lot.</br>   I agree cuckposting was funny when it was about the space cuck meme maker former ceo of troll inc. but now the real NTRfags think they are in good company.   <br> Growing up isn't so tough <br> Except when I've had enough </br></br>  <br><br>Pretend to be KoG, apparently.</br></br>  Why cant i find any recent chapters anywhere?  <br>You need to look in the archive for the threads.</br>  Relevant.  <br>Why is Loki so fucking ugly.</br>  <br> トップケク </br>  To tide you over as I finish up~  <br>Love me some Eroe</br>        Wait, Chapter 70 is already out?  <br>Chapter 72 is out ain't it ?</br>  <br>Yeah it was done on Monday.</br>  <br>What about the text below "kiss"?</br>  <br>Well shit</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the point of it was that it's a better raw + cleaned<br><br><br>Aereus said on his site that it was absent from the latest issue of YJ</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aereus <br>Could you regularly release chapters?

Yui<br>  + She is the only girl known in the series that is canonically a virgin <br>  + She only has eyes for her one true love and when other guys try to approach her she turns them down without a second thought <br>  + She is fill with love and although she might call her loved one gross or creepy, she would do anything in bed to make her significant other happy <br><br>2. Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3. Iroha<br>  + She wants something genuine and is working towards attaining it <br>  + Once she sets her sights on her true love, she does everything to obtain him <br>  + sly, yet genuine to her true love  <br>  +/- She hangs around random boys (although that might change now that she wants something genuine) <br>  - She used to like the cunt (even if it was a superficial) <br><br>4. Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pan-san girl a best.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit. Yukinofags are literally Cuckinofags.</br></br>  <br> yui <br>  - even 8man called her a slut <br>  - penguins and fish </br></br></br>  <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>This one is backwards, she was cold towards Yui for placing value on losing her virginity early.</br></br>  <br><br><br>nice samefag</br></br></br>  <br>hey cunt killer, I think you're too hard on the cunt. I had a dream where it was revealed the true nature of the hayato and indeed he is a more miserable individual than anyone in the oregairuverse.<br>probably the one that needs the most love and sympathy of anyone, especially of someone that is his mental equal AKA 8man and not some retard like Tobe or idealizer like Yumiko</br></br>  <br>Yes, someone sweet like Iroha would be perfect for him.</br>  <br>You mean moeblob Yukino.</br>  <br>I think you mean Yui, she is the Y girl after all</br>  <br>Indeed, Iroha would have definitely been a great support for Hayama. He should've said "fuck you" to his group and accept her confession ensuring that he would at least live his own life for a bit. Aside from the issue that he would surely get NTR'd by 8man he would've at least been happy. Funny thing though, if he had to balls to really be himself he wouldn't need Iroha, or anyone for that manner.</br>  <br>why yukino has bulge</br>  <br>Too bad moreblob Yukino is dying soon, Hayama was cucked again by 8man</br>  Brothers?<br><br> I have not forgotten you my brethren. Ch. 2 tl when? </br></br>  <br>Extremely puffy vulva.</br>  <br>Too bad she doesn't love him  romantically . And Miura recently is just trying too hard it might be backfired.</br>  <br> she doesn't love him romantically <br>so she likes him platonically as friends? I didn't know their relationship was that sexual already</br></br>  <br>Haven't been in these threads lately, but I drop by every now and then.<br><br> http://imgur.com/a/VuMzL </br></br></br>  <br>What? There's nothing sexual about it. You said it yourself it's platonic.</br>  When will we see cookie man?  <br>It's just a small crush.<br> Like Yui or Yukino toward 8man </br></br>  <br>I actually finally figured out who the cookieman really is. It took a while be here it is.</br>  <br> Yui <br> Least slutty <br>naaaaah</br></br></br>  <br>I'm Hayama?</br>  <br>You are? Well I'm sorry to say this but that means I'm here to kill you.<br><br>Don't resist, I'll try to make it as quick as possible.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe it.<br>I always knew I was Zaimokuza.</br></br>  <br>Me?</br>  <br>I didn't know Yui liked homeless NEETs with drug problems</br>    <br>I remember you brother. Thanks again for sakicolor.</br>  alone-end when?    <br>She should fuck 8man in front of Yukino<br>I'm sure she wouldn't mind, Yukino only likes him platonically after all<br>Haruno should also say how 8man prefers her over Yukino and talk about how 8man fucks her, that will make Yukino glad that her sister found someone genuine</br></br></br>  What would happened to your dick if yukino turned yandere?  <br>Adorable. It's too bad I don't take sluts.</br>  <br>She would rely on Haruno or Yui to help her do something about it.</br>  <br>A yandere? Well it looks like my work isn't done yet.

No more innocent lives will be lost, justice will prevail!</br>   Final scene <br> 8man confesses to Yukino <br> "I-I love you too..." <br> Goes in for a kiss <br> Suddenly stops <br> Yui in the backscreen <br> She has a gun pointed at Yukino <br> Yukino has a hole in her chest <br> Dies, a tear goes down her cheek <br> Helpless 8man stares at the scene, astonished <br> "I love you, Hikki..." <br> Scene ends with a BANG and a black screen <br> "15 years later..." <br> Christmas Cake Yui gets out of jail <br> Series ends with an uncensored shot of Yui pooping all over Yukino's grave </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck the yandere out of her</br>  <br> Series ends with an uncensored shot of Yui pooping all over Yukino's grave <br>DEVILISH</br></br>  <br> Guns <br> Japan <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd watch this</br>  <br>If she forcibly rapes 8man my dick would be 11/10</br>  Context: After Haruno teased 8man about being his girlfriend in front of Orimoto, 8man rejected her description of their relationship and this happened:<br><br> “Aw, you’re no fun.” <br><br> After she said that, Haruno made a pouty, sulky face. I was thinking how I’d like to poke those cheeks of hers, but there was no way I could do that and I shrugged my shoulders instead.  <br><br>How do you think she would have reacted if 8man had poked her cheeks? <br>Would 8man still be a virgin?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 15 years for double homicide <br>unrealistic</br></br>  <br>That'd be incredibly autistic of him. Maybe he could pull it off he did it in a playful manner, as in adding a retort along with it. But suddenly poking?<br>extremely autistic.</br></br>  All I want is for 8man and Yukino's cynical banter to escalate into wild sex.<br><br>Is that too much to ask?</br></br>  <br>Would new Yukino even continue to insult him?</br>  Posting best doujin  <br>Not in Japan.</br>  <br> During those 15 years 8man happily lived his life out <br> having survived his near fatal encounter he ends up at an hospital <br> Iroha visits him everyday <br>  due to being in the hospital he couldn't graduate on time <br>  spends his final high school year not as Iroha's senpai but as her equal, though Iroha still calls him Senpai </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but it would be much closer to flirting than before</br>  <br> Is that too much to ask? <br>Yes, because Yukino would just lie there as a dead fish. There would be no "wild "sex".</br></br>  <br>8man has dead fish eyes, and women don't need stamina if the guy is dominant</br>  <br>you're confusing "dominant" for "could have just bought an onahole"</br>  What would happen to your dick if orimoto turns yandere and kills every girl around 8man?  <br>No, THIS is best doujin.</br>  <br> dead fish meme <br>Yukino doesn't have the best stamina but that doesn't mean they can't have wild sex before her stamina runs out. She lasted long enough in the tennis match</br></br>  <br>I don't know what you mean by "wild sex" but she'll definitely leave his back with some scratches.</br>  <br>Best fanart, presented by the 8 himself</br>  Why is Hayama the happiest and the most  genuine  when he interacts with Hikitani-kun?  <br> Yui with fangs <br>Fangs only belong on Komachi, off yourself right now</br></br>  <br> single homicide <br><br>I was reading through some mass-murder serial kill shit from Japan, some of these guys clearly had mental problems and had criminal records with time served.<br>These mother fuckers literally got slapped on the wrist for rape, assault, and attempted murder.<br><br>In Japan Yui would probably get sentenced 2 years, then placed into psychiatry ward and released 6 months after it's deemed she's sane.<br>Then she'd go and kill who ever is on 8man's tip a week after.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the judge had any sense he'd let her off without even that much. Serves those bitches right for touching her Hikki.</br>   8man makes a request to the service club <br> Yui and Yukino watch with hopeful, curious eyes anticipating his request <br> "I...I..." <br> Their eyes widen and become teary at the thought.

You're in the same boat as all of us simply because you're still here.</br>  <br> Anon, any of the non-autistic fans left ages ago.  <br>I guess this explains why Irohafags are the largest around here.</br></br>  <br>I remember starting DAL after reading the synopsis thinking it would be similar to TWGOK<br>Damn was it disappointing after having my expectations brought so high</br></br>  I wonder if sensei's<br> It doesn't have to be you <br>implies that 8man is better off with other girls.</br></br>  <br>No, 8man won't be better off with Iroha, sorry.</br>  <br> implying 8man didn't already have his perfect future staring him in the face </br>  OVA when?  <br>And you hate her because?</br>  <br>cuz he ain't her</br>  <br> implies that 8man is better off with other girls. <br>That's why Iroha exists.<br>Drama queens can fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>So marry Yui and cheat on her with the mom?</br>  <br>By "her" you mean?</br>  <br> Nipples piercing top <br>I don't know why, but it's one of my fetishes.</br></br>  <br>Or just marry Yui and have eternal love without having to fuck her mom.</br>  Was he always this handsome or only FEEL made it so he's like this?  <br>I don't, I just enjoy baiting Irohafags. It's one of the few joys left in my life now that S2 is over and we've got to wait for Spyro to translate the current books.</br>  <br>Iroha's existence is meaningless<br>why is she even there anyway</br></br>  <br>He's suppose to be relatively good looking, but has a shitty attitude and stare. Hence the "rotten fish eyes" that everyone fucking loves to harp on him in season 1 / earlier volumes.</br>  <br>Comedy relief. Look the term up, it's exactly what Iroha's scenes represent in the grander scheme of the narrative.</br>  <br>To shill for Coca Cola.</br>  <br>Where's the fun in that?<br>If there's Yui end, he's probably going to end up fucking the other girls anyway because she would have no backbone<br>In Yukino end, probably Haruno would seduce him<br>In Iroha end, YY would probably end up fucking him <br><br>He's too easy to get close to, I'm sure he'll accidentally have multiple affairs after he ends up with any girl</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rotten fish eyes <br>Aren't they just wonderful?</br></br>  <br>It means he doesn't have to try and get close to Yukino or help her if he doesn't want to.</br>  <br>I thought he developed that shitty attitude because people were being shit to him/ostracizing him on purpose.<br><br>Why did he get isolated in the first place if his attitude at the start wasn't so shitty and he's relatively good looking? Just because of his rotten eyes?</br></br></br>  <br>Only Watari, 8man, and Komachi would know. We do know that the Hikigaya parents have not treated as well as Komachi, but that might just be Watari playing on the spoiled younger sibling thing.</br>  <br><br>It's the most realistic version of him, you have to be that handsome to have 4+ girls liking you. <br>I'm pretty sure he just needs to get glasses and be less distant and the other girls will be all over him.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he was an idiot, misinterpreted and misunderstood people's motivations way too much and acted on his feelings like a fucking retard instead of accurately reading the mood.<br><br>Aka hikki has autism</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty fair to say that both 8man and Yukino are somewhere on the autism scale.</br>  <br>Why do you hate him so much? He simply fell into the loner trap and never got out of it. It's the same thing that happened to Rumi.</br>  <br>His attitude wasn't that bad back then but his eyes with the way he acted made him come off as really creepy and he was socially awkward.<br><br>His face isn't that bad but the rotten fish eyes make him look like a prowler (source:Yukinon)</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's kinda why we're reading/watching about this fucking fictional Japanese teenager. We're waiting for him to either grow or just go full spaghetti [and then grow later].</br>  <br>Will the picture she bought ever come up again?</br>  <br>His punishment and her request were just a ruse to get 8man to befriend Yukino. (Probably at Haruno's request.)<br>Yui enters the picture and befriends Yukino. Shizuka gave him the okay to leave the club and make his own as long as she gets to watch over him at the end of Vol 2.<br>She pretty much says that she didn't think he was wrong in how he looked at things, she just wanted him to be able to put up with other peoples bullshit if he wished to continue to live in the world of adults.<br><br>But Yui bailed after the nicegirl monologue so Shizuka had to find a replacement or force them to bring her back, so she can have 8man to herself.<br>8man realized Yui's feelings and understands that he is the only thing keeping Yui and Yukino together.<br>(Yui isn't the glue)8man is a clamp forcing two block(heads) of wood together, waiting for the adhesive that lies between the two to dry.<br>He can't bail on them until they give up on whatever feelings they have for him and continue their friendship.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They'll never mention it, but in the epilogue when WW shows us a glimpse of Yukino and 8man's married life we'll see the photo framed on top of the fireplace or something</br>  <br>He grew up as a  poorfag  just like Iroha.<br>When kids notice that shit they can be pretty cruel. IE calling him Hiki-germa or Froggygaya.<br>So he never got to interact with others properly and never got to develop proper social skills.<br>But you better believe, he spoiled the shit out of Komachi so she wouldn't have to feel bad.<br>Their parents tried protecting her smile too, like the one time the only thing 8man got for Christmas was a pack of magical girl trading cards.<br>Komachi had probably realized this later on and it kind of explains why she's so adamant in trying to be the cutest imouto to make him happy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats a really nice interpretation. I hoped the LN author was thinking of this.</br>  <br>He was Korean.</br>  <br>He is supposed to be that handsome:<br><br> Given that it’s a weekend, the movie theaters were thriving. <br><br> As I looked at the movie showtimes and the seat availability, Isshiki pointed at an extraordinary, Hollywood-esque poster. It was gaudily labeled as an “Academy Award nominee.” <br><br> “I want to watch this.” <br><br> “Alright, I’ll watch this one.” <br><br> I, on the other hand, chose a movie that had no relevance to Academy Awards. Both movies ended at nearly the same time, so the both of us should be out of the theater almost simultaneously. <br><br> “Now we just need a place to meet afterwards. You okay with the Starbucks below?” <br><br> My nature didn’t place me in the habit of watching movies with other people, so I decided on something that seemed reasonable. As a matter of fact, I even took into account the length of both movies, so why was Iroha-chan making such a dumbfounded face? <br><br> “…Huh? What?” I asked. <br><br> Isshiki nodded her head, finding something convincing. “I see. So things turn out that way because you respond like that.” <br><br>This is the point where Iroha realizes why her handsome senpai doesn't have a girlfriend or random girls blowing him. She realizes that it's all because of his attitude.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This doesn't explain why he was called Froggygayakun, or Hikigerma-kun by other kids when he was younger though.<br><br><br>Kinda makes sense</br></br></br></br>  <br>8man has always been socially retarded, even if he wasn't jaded back then.<br>Notice how he misunderstood Orimoto's behaviour back in the day, he thought he was lead on, when Orimoto was just being friendly as she's with pretty much everyone.</br></br>  <br>It's ironic how the late comer understands this side of 8man a lot more than the ones who were around him since the start.<br>No wonder he said that Iroha could earn a third grade Hikigaya certificate.<br><br><br>Also, friendly reminder that Iroha is the only one that knows how to enjoy a date with him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This would make sense but both of his parents work all day, when Komachi was younger 8dad was indebted due to some stupidity which made 8mom mad so for a while they didn't make much money, but this was after he was already a loner.</br>  <br>That's because Yukino never saw him in that light and Yui is kind of innocent. <br><br>The only other person who'd probably notice the problem and not be pissed off by it because she understood he was like that is  Ebina. </br></br></br>  I wonder what Yui would feel the exact moment she saw Hikki kiss another girl or flirts with one. Not after she rationalizes it but at the moment  <br>Implying any Japanese writer would have a Korean be a main character.</br>  <br> Also, friendly reminder that Iroha is the only one that knows how to enjoy a date with him. <br><br>Aside from the 3p date Yukino did enjoy bieng at the animal expo and going to the mall with him despite Haruno's interruption.</br></br></br>  <br>She would just cry again, because that's what she does best.</br>  <br><br>meh all the girls were sucking up to him in one way or another while he did nothing for them.</br></br>  <br>Enjoy as in both of them being able to appreciate it. On that matter, double YY is just awkward and can't even do stuff properly because 8man's defenses block them.<br><br>But let's face it, even though 8man is "I want to go home" multiple times during his date with Iroha, that loner was enjoying it. Not to mention his dick having a hard time remaining calm.</br></br></br>  <br>I really liked Iroha after reading the LN, I really wished the author would write more about her. <br>She's really interesting and not bland. I wanna see the girl who develops her character with the main protagonist. I liked that she didn't made Hikigaya feel bad about himself nor did she cornered him and ignored him, but instead tells him about his faults straight to the point and no drama needed. The date arc was great. The only problem I see in Iroha route is if the author would still forcibly push Iroha's attraction to Hayama till the end.</br></br>  <br>It's not like his parents were finishing up their degree, working two jobs, and raising two kids at the time.<br>It's not like his dad fell for some get rich quick scheme at the hands of some floozy.<br>It's not like his parents got a promotion or got hired for whatever degree they got while he was growing up.<br><br>This is why 8man likes Saize the only time both of his parents have time off from work/college they would go to the only place the could afford. It's filled with the few happy moments of his childhood. <br>He thought things would be different when his parents got better jobs, but they have to work slave wages to afford a middle-class home and save up college tuition for two kids. <br>Also explains why 8man knows a decent amount about scholarships and why he tried taking on part-time jobs, he wasn't really going to pocket his parents money for himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see why it would. Does the thought of Hikki being with another girl bother her that much?</br>  <br>Hoping the same here, anon. She's a lot of fun. Currently reading through that chapter where she's trying to set up the newspaper in volume 10.5.<br><br> tfw best girl never wins <br>I like most of the cast, but Iroha is truly the best for 8man</br></br></br></br>  /oregairu wars  Iroha was the editor's idea, not WW's. <br><br>Post your reasons why this is true.</br></br>  <br> Iroha is the only one that knows how to enjoy a date with him. <br> Enjoy as in both of them being able to appreciate it. <br>Those two are different first one stated one side enjoyed it then you say it had to be both.</br></br></br>  <br>WW only creates shitty characters, so yeah, your theory seems about right.</br>   Yuigahama briefly sighed and looked at Isshiki. “You know what, the way you’re asking really is the problem…” <br><br>Yeah, no shit sherlock. No wonder you can't do shit.<br>You don't tease or flirt with somebody with a stupid face and an emotionless voice.<br>At least you got him into his denial mode with that, so you got that going for you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm aware of that, my choice of words on the first post was poor.<br>ごめん</br></br>  Hey guys maybe 8man will end up with Yukino  <br>Really? What makes you think that?</br>  <br>Personal experience, for the most part .</br>  <br>They'll most likely end up together but not in a romantic sense.</br>  <br>You too? I thought I was the only one who had 2 bitches riding my dick in high school.</br>  <br>MAX Coffee already fills the job.</br>  <br>Well I had a crush on a girl similar to Yukino but she always had her eye on a guy who was similar to 8man. She would always smile and talk to me so I thought I had a chance but those two ended up dating all of sudden. She never really talked to me after that...as if I was some embarrassing memory of hers.</br>  <br>It's alright Hayato, no need to relive those memories.</br>  <br>I want to kill this fucking cunt.</br>  <br>Maybe if you weren't such a Tobe...</br>  <br>I want to kill this fucking cunt.</br>  <br>There's no need to fret over the past anon, over the years our eyes open to the 2d and anything else gets irrelevant.</br>  <br>It's okay. Her older sister might occasionally use you as a booty call.</br>  <br>Then why does 2d never go the way I want it to go? Why can't childhood friends win? What did Hayato do wrong?</br>  <br> What did Hayato do wrong? <br>Literally everything, he never had the balls to put himself at risk for someone like Hachiman.</br></br>  <br><br>Shoulda protected Yukino from getting made fun of back in that American elementary school. But no, you dyed your hair blonde to fit in and should stood there while she got teased.</br></br>  <br>I just think people hate him more than they should...hes actually really nice once you get to know him.</br>  <br>Don't worry. Hayato will win the 8-inch in the end, while Yukino will win neither.</br>  <br>Yeah he isn't a bad guy, but he's a complete conformist that rejects change.</br>  <br> 888 <br>Man..</br></br>    <br>Not enough though.<br>Max Coffee-tan isn't a realistic name.<br>Ilohas-chan is.<br><br>yfw neither WW or his editor came up with best girl Iroha, but Coca Cola.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So they platonically stay by each other's side, live together, sleep together platonically, and then raise a family together, platonically of course.</br>  <br>Well unlike Iroha,<br>Yui doesn't really need to act like a slut to get 8man's dick hard.<br><br>Also 8man prefer Yui this way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Love is never brought up but they do things lovers do. They go on dates, hold hands, have passionate sex. They're like the Unsentimental Couple in that manga.</br>  <br> Yukino <br> passionate </br></br>  <br>Yui has tits, that's enough to get him going.<br> act like a slut <br>Figured, here's a reply to keep you going.</br></br></br>  <br>She can get passionately angry, she'll release her angry frustrations on his dick, platonically.</br>  If Yukino had tits, it'd be his perfect girl physically<br><br>So basically he should marry Sensei</br></br>  <br>He said he actually would be head over heels for her if she were 10 years younger<br><br>inb4 final form Yukino is basically sensei.</br></br></br>  If she had tits she would be 15/10 to him, he would have died from lack of oxygen and blood to his head.  <br><br>Sensei is a ruined Yukino. What 8man means is he would be head over heels for a 10-years-younger non-ruined Sensei i.e. Yukino.</br></br>  <br>But anon Sensei is not ruined.

I wish she got more screen time towards the end. That's my biggest gripe with the show, I think. A bunch of characters who were important in the beginning sorta got shafted by the second half.  <br>which you wanna first <br><br>amaburi season 2 or hibikes season 2</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger the drawing is gorgeous. What the fuck are you even talking about? don't you have western stylized yuri shit to read? kek</br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>Euphonium easily, It's probably the best Kyoani show since Hyouka.<br><br>Amagai Park was embarrassing by Kyoani standards despite the god Takemoto being on it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Reina looks fine, it's Taki that looks weird. He looks like a hunchback.</br></br>  For those who missed volume 2 spoilers <br><br>Thoughts in general? Did you like it?</br></br>  <br><br>I like  it to be animated. </br></br>  <br>Her, Midori, and like Shuichi I guess. They all sorta dropped out of the main cast once auditions and trumpet solo melodrama came around. Obviously they were still there, but they just felt less important, you know?</br>  <br>Not that guy but Taki does look a bit weird.</br>  <br>They were only really in the main cast because Yamada need her 4-5 friendship group for the OP and ED.</br>  <br>He looks fine by me.</br>  Make way for real art<br>http://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/t<wbr>hank_you_tuba_kun</wbr></br>  <br>His legs look stumpy compared to the length of his torso, his back his is oddly hunched forward and the way his shoulder + arm is positioned looks kinda unnatural.</br>  <br>Yeah Reina does look good, its just her hair bothers me. Any minute now I think its gonna fall off in the pic. Sorry just saying, I tend to say things I'm not suppose to sometimes. I mean I like the art its just Taki needs to be drawn more lean and stuff. Fujoshi's are the best at drawing men. I seen a really nice Taki drawing by one.</br>    <br>There are a few small things wrong with the drawing.</br>  <br>But you care enough to reply on a Hibike thread.<br>What a losser.</br></br>  <br>i-it's too cute for you!</br>  <br>why everyone likes shuui</br>  <br>There's a part of his legs the drawing isn't covering for perspective's sake. His torso looks fine, he's lifiting his right arm after all, while the left one is resting.<br><br>I can't believe you guys always point out te minimal errors of drawings whenever is something that isn't yurishit.<br><br><br>Name them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me too.</br>  /u/ is still mad, I see  <br>I thought he was a cool guy. I liked how he was able to point out Asuka's "flaws" before the rest of the cast, and he had great chemistry with Kumiko. I preferred their interactions to Kumiko and Reina, which came off as like "unrealistic" I guess, I can't think of a good word.</br>  <br> taki's right arm isn't drawn to show that it's angling inwards so it looks too short <br> taki's legs are too short <br> taki's back is oddly hunched over  <br> reina's legs are angled too inward and start too far away from the center of her body </br></br></br></br>  <br>The artist is quite good at drawing Taki though<br><br><br>She's fixed that drawing several times. You should check out her gallery and upload the most recent version.</br></br></br></br>  There is my lean boy. Look at those legs.  <br>Tuba</br>  <br>Link? She removed the link and protected her twitter account.</br>  Kumiko best mother and Oreki best father.  <br>That Taki looks derpy though. Look at the mouth and nose. The jaw is also too wide, Taki's one is pointy.<br>It barely looks like him. <br>The anatomy is great though.</br></br></br>  <br>that would imply they are going to make a second season and so far that doesn't seem the case.</br>  <br>wow, this because yurifags?</br>  <br>The link is still there, anon.

Kumiko and Shuuichi don't get together until the very end, like right after Nationals. Season 2 is gonna focus on regionals, the second years, Taki, Asuka, new characters and Band Camp.

She has an attractive teacher next to her who lifts his shirt slightly to fan himself, and somehow that makes her feel hot/turned on.</br>  Emerald-chan  <br>Good question, anon. I can't choose between these two.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128487934 <br>Kyoani just enjoys doing yuri scenes. There is no ulterior motive. They don't plan on retconning the story and making them a couple. They don't intentionally plan on fucking with yuri fans by making them believe they're making them a yuri couple only to give them a het end. They read the novels, thought their scenes were nice, and thought "How can we expand on this?". You people are all making a much bigger deal out of it than it really is.<br><br>Can't you just enjoy the show without all this faggotry? Ironic that people here constantly complain about how yuri scenes detract from the show but 50% of all conversation is always yuri related.</br></br></br>  <br>The design is the of the same quality for all characters. What's of favorite type, I'm doubting between Natsuki and Asuka.</br>  <br> Plenty of scenes? <br><br>Only like 3 scenes. And its mostly Reina talking about him to Kumiko or Reina -----&gt; Taki or Reina angsting over Taki. Most of the scenes are dedicated to the second years and Asuka. but who knows maybe they will throw some extra stuff for Reina. But they will focus more on other characters.</br></br></br>  <br> Kumikos octopus hair &gt; ponztail </br>  <br> Ironic that people here constantly complain about how yuri scenes detract from the show but 50% of all conversation is always yuri related <br>Of course it is. Fifty percent of the show was yuri related. Which is an issue when the yuri doesn't go anywhere.</br></br>  <br>She is best.</br>  <br>Kumiko and Shuuichi have a much nicer and cute relationship in the novels. I'm just bitter they didn't show their true dynamic in the anime.</br>  <br>I hope KyoAni add scenes with Kumiko and Hashimoto.</br>  <br>We got the scene where Reina goes to his ofice early in the morning, and the scene where she asks him if he's dating the hot teacher.</br>  <br> Fifty percent of the show was yuri related. <br>It literally wasn't. Episode 8 had a slightly longer scene, but no other episode spent more than a minute of subtext scenes. And outside of episodes 8 and 11, no episode had heavy subtext at all, all of them require you to wear yuri goggles to consider the yuri scenes. <br><br>These threads just blew everything out of proportion by trying to overanalyze every single frame.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah with Kumiko next to her like when she goes to the office or observing her like when she pushes her to talk to Taki at band camp. <br><br>We never get scenes of them together alone. Kumiko is the main character and instead of focusing on the talk with Taki and Reina, she turns her attention to Hashimoto, who scares the shit out of her.</br></br></br>  <br>Its still going down in history as the KyoAni show with Yuribait. Thats all people talk about not just here, but outside this site.</br>  <br>Kumko isn't next to her though. She's awaiting outside and Reina talks to Taki personally.</br>  <br>I guess I'm considering most of Kumiko and Reina's scenes to be "yuri related," and I can see why people might not agree with that view (because obviously the actual yuri stuff is more confined), but I feel like their relationship is sort of colored by the subtext scenes. If you'd like, I can instead say that fifty percent of the show was about a relationship with (misleading) yuri undertones.</br>  <br>Its still not the main focus though. Since Its in Kumiko's POV.</br>  <br>Why does she cover her ears than if she isn't near her? Reina can't be that loud when?</br>  <br>So what? all of HIbike is from Kumiko's pov, but they clearly changed that in the anime.</br>  <br>Did they really? we don't exactly get inner thoughts from any other character, and only glimpse of what they are doing out side of Kumiko's eyes.</br>  You guys do know there is gonna be more Yuri subtext in the second season right? Especially with Yuuko/Natsuki and Mizore/Nozomi.  <br>I would definitely agree that Kumiko and Reina's relationship and the character growth Kumiko experiences due to Reina is one of the most important parts of the show, if not the single most important plot point.<br><br>But half the show being about them is still a gross exaggeration. It's enough to look at the screen time Reina had. She was featured prominently in the festival episode and the second audition episode, but I doubt there was any other episode in the show where she had more than five minutes of screen time (not just with Kumiko, but in general).</br></br></br>  <br>I am fairly frightened of the idea of Reina as a mom. She could be such a bully, especially over music.</br>  <br> second season <br>Nice one.</br></br>  <br>Can't wait for Asuka Love Story movie</br>  <br>Outside of 1-2 people like <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128488878  who use the word "degenerate" unironically, I don't think there are many people who have any problems with that. People are annoyed by "yuri bait", the relationship between Kumiko and Reina which will never be a romantic relationship, they're not annoyed by the idea of having yuri subtext. And annoyance with "yuri bait" is not an exclusively anti-yuri thing, either.</br>  <br> Asuka love story? <br><br>Don't even joke about her plot, Asuka really goes through a lot of shit in volume 3. The movie if anything will focus heavily on the Eupho Trio and since Its KyoAni Haruka, Kaori and their friendship with Asuka.</br></br></br>  <br>useless-chan<br>sorry novelanon</br></br>  <br>But you and I both know, the second years are gonna have a lot of focus as well as Asuka, and by the spoilers, Yuuko/Natsuki and Nozomi/Mizore are quite gay with each other.</br>  <br>That's why Asuka Love Story, a movie about how she could surpass difficult times through her passion for music you pleb</br>   tfw Asuka villain on next season   <br>Isn't it more about her daddy issues? Or how connected her and Kumiko are to one another?</br>  oct should come closer....  <br>Yes, I have never disputed that.</br>  <br>Asuka did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>This. I'm fine with actual yuri, I just don't enjoy shows giving non-romantic relationships romantic flavor that doesn't feed into anything.</br>  Post your favorite scene  <br>this was the moment when we realized that bestsuki was the best character, right?</br>   kyoani will use cg for the instruments they said   <br>Reina would be the cutest mom</br>  <br><br>Reina was bullied when she was a child due to her personality.

It was meant for this anon<br/></br>  <br>People do care about the canon stuff. Not now maybe, but once the anime starts, the second years are gonna be even more popular with the amount of focus. Natsuki also gets a lot of focus in the second and third novel, and she already has a lot of art on pixiv. Imagine how popular she'll get by the time KyoAni starts to put her in promo art, right beside Nozomi. since they are team Flute.</br>  <br>No she covers her ear because Reina is too loud, also she's beside her because Kumiko also notices how red Reina's cheeks become, you can't really see that kind of detail far away. And Novel anon also stated that Reina and Taki when they have scenes are always in front of Kumiko. They never have a real private scene without Kumiko. Maybe the anime will change that, but I we'll just have to see.</br>    I want to grab pigtails.  <br>bochou did nothing wrong</br>  <br><br><br>they will force yuri upon us next season and there's nothing you can do about it</br></br></br>  You will never open a cafe with Natsuki.<br><br>Why even make capital?</br></br>  <br> Why even make capital? <br>So you can pay people to animate more Natsuki.</br></br>  <br>w-wait<br>are you the guy who was making the kaori doujin?</br></br>  I want to cum in Asuka's mouth.

Anyways, her art is pretty cute and the way she draw the kyoani style is pretty accurate, can't say the same about Nori though. Just look at Reina and Kumiko's face.<br> Besides, I went and looked at her pixiv profile and she's a hobbyist artist. She's doing a good job so far </br></br>  <br>Who said I was a yurifag? God you anti yuri shits need to get over yourselves. I'm just saying that in terms of hibike art, Nori has the best ability and the art you're praising isn't anywhere near god like.</br>  <br>nice try to movement the thread but at this rate no one cares that much</br>  <br>Nori is godtier in every he does though, not only Hibike. He must be a professional artist.<br>Anyways, it doesn't mean ferufer's art is bad in any way. There's always going to be someone better anyways.</br></br>  I do wonder how people will get through the amount of yuri subtext in the second season with the second years, and how Reina becomes less important compare to Asuka.  <br>he is right though Nori doesn't have nothing to do with It</br>  <br><br>I don't frequent that much, I'm genuinely curious.</br></br>  <br>well they will react well?</br>  <br><br>It'll probably sell 9k average. That isn't bad.</br></br>  <br>Most people hate Asuka, so with her getting more focus compare to Reina, it will get ugly.</br>  <br>Well if that's the case Hibike wasn't a flop by any means, actually it sold quite well.<br> but for Kyoani standwards  <br>That's relative and shouldn't be used as "argument". What's definitive is that the production price to make Hibike was low compared to others studios, certainly the lowest between the major ones. <br>Just like this anon said  9k average wouldn't be bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Most people hate Asuka <br>You are just making things up. Do you even browse Hibikes threads, curious one?</br></br>  <br><br>9k might have been optimistic, but for comparison.<br><br>Nichijou 3,020<br>Tamako Market 3,818<br>KnK 4,503<br>Amagi 6,732<br>Chu2Ren 7,063<br><br>Eupho will probably outsell all of these, but it depends on how well the remaining volumes sell. The next recent KyoAni show that comes close is Hyouka with 10,044.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't the first Chu2 around 15k?</br>  <br><br>Yes, the second season bombed.</br></br>  <br>I was there during everyone being pissed at Asuka. Do people like her now?</br>  <br>What, the shitposters samefagging like there's no tomorrow? You have a point there. <br>Look at best girl lists made by anons along those threads and you will notice Asuka is always up there.</br></br>  <br> Hurr the art I like is better and the one you like is shit! <br>God, you sure do sound like a petty yurifag though.</br></br>   N-Nani?   <br>Look at that face, those fingers<br>Where's her nose?<br>awful, nowhere as good as Nori.</br></br></br>  <br>She play the left fagott so I call her left faggot.</br>  Maude?  <br>She's so cute. Her design shouldn't have been wasted like that.</br>  Threadly reminder Reina is old enough to marry  Taki.   <br>I was almost missing you.</br>  <br> Reina is old enough <br>I'm drunk, but even I know that bullshirt</br></br>  <br>Prepare your lips for a kissu.<br><br><br>She's 16, so she can marry  in some regions  as long as her parents give consent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at that mustache, that face structure. What's wrong with his fingers? atrocious.<br>Nowhere near as god as Nori.</br></br>  <br> Western art </br>  <br> as long as her parents give consent. <br>And bring shame to the family for allowing a handsome pedophile to take their daughter's hand</br></br>  <br>You called?</br>  <br> Pedophile <br>You take that buzzword to tumblr and stay there.</br></br>  <br>Kumiko will be so good to her.</br>  <br>Haven't you watched JAV? literally 90% of japanese porn is grandpas making fuck to barely legal girls.<br>They really dig the older thing.</br></br>  <br>You silly anon, Reina will never give up her love for Taki-sensei and Kumiko's will date shuuicihi later on.<br>Ahahah silly anons sure do make my day!</br></br>  <br>Ahaha Kumiko and Reina will make the cutest babies.</br>  <br>Silly anon! women can't impregnate each other</br>  <br><br>Look at those noses, what the fuck is wrong with these? tears and pimples? a hunchback Reina?<br>Disgustig. Nowhere near as good as Nori.</br></br></br>  you guy posting this shit please stop faggot  <br> women can't impregnate each other </br>  <br>God, I can smell /u/ from here.</br>  <br> you will never have kumiko's gains </br>  <br> &gt;&gt;kancolle </br>  <br>Look at that lineart, those hands. What the fuck was the artist thinking?<br>Vile, nowhere near as good as Nori.</br></br>  <br>you are just making things up....</br>  <br>He's mocking all the people who critique art.</br>  <br>The lineart is shitty and the colors are bland. Now look at the hand holding THE baby. What in the actual fuck.<br>As I said, the ability of the artist doesn't compare to Nori's.</br></br>  <br>You have a problem with /u/? Sounds like an inner issue.</br>  <br>Which is stupid since the Chilean artist is really shit tho.</br>  <br>How is a inner issuee when /u/ posters are so damn annoying?</br>  <br> Tho <br>Please go back to tumblr and stay there.</br></br>  <br>I think the anti yuri shitposters are more annoying. They try so hard it ends up being a hugbox.</br>  <br> do I fit in yet? </br>  <br>What will you do next fag? post frogs?<br>fuck off to whatever shithole you came from, landwhale.</br></br>  <br>Because you want to find things wrong with a post but can't you try to nitpick about literally nothing. Keep a check on that autism.</br>  <br>How am I the autist one when you write like that? Stop projecting for once and cry about this shit on your blog.</br>  <br>  since the Chilean artist is really shit tho. <br>Oh I can show you shit. <br>Can you do the same?</br></br></br>   Plot for the second season.   All western artists are shit.  <br>There are some excellent ones, like this <br>But most are like pic related, so I'm inclined to agree.</br></br>  <br>That's not good though, its pretty but the proportions are glaring. People should just let eastern people draw.</br>  Poor Feru, if she only knew the shitstorm her art produces.  <br> that seagull <br>Giant Reina a cute</br></br>  <br>Shindol</br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with the proportions in that comic?</br>  <br>Shindol is a japanese dude who stayed in america for some years</br>  <br>You're splerging out over nothing m8. I write like that on this board frequently and no one gives a shit but you.</br>  <br>Look at the colors, the faces. What the fuck is Reina doing to her trumpet?<br>0/10, nowhere near as good as Nori.</br></br>  <br>What's wrong with that? Are you really that bitter?</br>  <br>Then you haven't been here enough, landhwale.</br>  <br>And you have the nerve to ask? ayy</br>  <br> land whale <br>Do you know any other insult or is this the only one and you're excited about it?</br></br>  <br>I like how you still have more KumiRei than anything else. It's good you know what the true pairing is. Keep posting the good post, sister!</br>  <br>I also have hambeast. You see, people like you are generally really fat and hideous and there aren't many words that can capture that well enough.<br>Landwhale does it just fine.</br></br>  <br>It's sad you can't really compete when it comes to shittiness and lack of actual talent in terms of fanart.<br>Really sad for you, but very funny for me.<br>Here have this.<br>Trans Kumiko and Reina for girls like you to insert themselves in! you should be grateful of me, really.</br></br></br></br>  <br> autistic neckbeard calls someone else fat and hideous <br>We'll meme'd my friend.</br></br>  <br>As long as you continue promoting KumiRei I don't mind what form it is. Our OTP will win my yurifriend.</br>  <br> Implying I'm wrong <br>You forgot to post a frog you fucking cow kek</br></br>  Could someone post more Yuuko/Natsuki or Nozomi/Mizore art? Don't you care for the best parings.  Has Shaft jumped the shark? Why are they wasting their time with Nisekoi?  Because they must obey their Aniplex masters.  because it sells well...  Does anyone believe Shaft can find a way again?  <br>isn't nisekoi: over or did it get another sequel?</br>  <br>They can always pull out more madoka, r-right?</br>  They don't care about Nisekoi or shit like Mekaku.<br>Kizu is going to be top seller anyway</br>  <br>I want more SZS.</br>  See <br><br>Stop treating studios like brands, shaft is doing nisekoi because they're being paid to</br></br>  <br>I believe that Monogatari's going to continue finding a way for a while to come. Outside of that, I'm cautiously hopeful. I mean, they're basically in the same situation KyoAni's in, where their main issue is source material, so if someone feels like funding a better project for SHAFT, I'm confident they'll pull through.<br><br><br>The anime's done for at least the time being.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The dream is over, what can I say?<br><br> God is a concept by which we measure our pain </br></br></br>  <br>I think shaft should do Medaka Box's Minus arc. I would love to see best villain well animated, and they do other Nisio Isin stuff. I would say everything after Minus arc isn't wanted, but I kind of want Fresh animated.</br>  <br>I've heard suggestions for Voynich Hotel.<br><br>From the description I've read of that, it sounds right up their alley.</br></br></br>  <br>If Kizu aired 4 years ago it would've been a top seller. Like topping LL and EVA top seller. Now the franchise is at an all time low point and the next season is going to sell even less.</br>  <br> Has Shaft jumped the shark? <br>Monogatari's still going strong, but a lot of their other shit isn't so hot.<br><br> Why are they wasting their time with Nisekoi? <br>Money, dear anon.<br><br><br>Don't forget to laugh anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No,it isn't</br>  <br> Monogatari still strong <br> Sales declining at an unbelievable speed <br> Shaft has to air in seasons with no top seller scheduled already. <br>At this rate we won't even get an adaptation for the final book.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It certainly does. Nisekoi is the top selling non action manga by tank numbers. They have a lot of money to advertise it.</br>  <br> Sales declining at an unbelievable speed <br><br>Really? Last I heard it was still doing well. When did this come to light?</br></br></br>  <br>That anon is spinning things heavily a certain way.<br><br>Sales have been declining with every installment since the start, but it's still selling very well.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder for colorblind people, Lala is exactly how she looks in the manga.<br><br>If you guys want to read ch35 with a summary made by TF use the archive (128480321)<br><br><br>Reminder:<br> Report and ignore the shitposters <br> Keep the thread clean </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to  bully  Lala.

Her attraction to Darling seems to be primarily as a sex-based dalliance to have fun with rather than an actual romantic relationship. That may change in the future, but that's what I've perceived in the manga so far. Also, Rachnera makes me detect some major slut-vibes. She really doesn't seem like the kind of woman who cares who she ties up, so don't confuse that behavior as a show of any real affection.<br><br>And Darling has  good taste  because of this, because  Cera decent girl, Rach good girl, but Miia best girl .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh hey, everyone!<br><br>Look what I have!</br></br>  <br> no legs <br> awful personality <br> slut <br>I guess people are just too picky about what they want for the mother of their children.</br></br></br></br>  Now, this is probably not going to be a common occurence, but because we got nice-ish scans today, we decided to slap something together.

I can't recall how it was resolved.</br>  <br>Most likely but to answer the question above that's why it was put there in there.</br>  You anons, liked the anime or episode 3?  Is childhood friend a dyke?   tfw until you reached the end of the first episode you didn't realize the title of the show was literally just the same name as the flower/weed and instead were were pronouncing it dan-del-eon    cute girls doing cute things <br> Shuu best character <br> Haruka second best <br><br>How?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Despite on Kirara this is not a CGDCT.</br>  <br>I don't get this part, does Akane hate Kanade or something?<br><br>Not knowing moonrunes isn't helping either.</br></br></br>  Defend this shit.  I don't get why Utaha got so upset that Aki didn't want to read the end of her LN.  <br><br>Bad English. There was probably a better way to word that.</br></br>  <br> Megumi is so beta and such a pushover  <br><br>Nice fanfiction.</br></br></br>  <br> beta <br><br>Nice lie. If you kept up with the show you'd know how scary she is when she gets mad.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, it seems like too young to understand that simple of a sentence. However, considering how many megumifags there are in this thread, it wouldn't surprise me that they are a bunch of kids who haven't even reach the double digits.</br>  And they said fansubbing was dead.  <br>Flax is so low? Am I the only one who uses them regularly?</br>  <br>Commie and CR translations are hit or miss.<br><br>Commie encodes and typesetting are god tier.<br><br>Funi everything is bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Inverse Telecine</br>  <br> And they said fansubbing was dead. <br><br>RE-Encodes of existing work do NOT count. So your pie chart is completely wrong. In addition, re-packaged copies of Crunchyroll or FUNimation should not count as they are not fansubs. They are commercially made products that someone copied and uploaded. <br><br>Actual fansubbing is dead as most of the CURRENT popular works with "fan released subtitles" are actually 98% based upon Crunchyroll's subtitles but have the text or font choice and position tweaked to be "better". <br><br>As for groups that do free (no charge or subscription) original fansubbing without using a commercially released subtitle, the most prominent group for that is Doremi which has even done subs for certain specific japanese live-action shows and documentaries. <br><br>Doremi is not liked by the Cartel because it opposed them, so you won't find them on cartel sites. <br><br>http://doremi-fansubs.com/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And they said fansubbing was dead. <br><br>A RIP from a DVD or bluray is not a fansub. Most of what you have listed are rippers. They never did any real subbing. <br><br>RIPs are not fansubs.</br></br></br></br></br>  No time to be depressed about Karasu=SAN, the ED album is out. Too bad it hasn't been leaked yet.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K0z<wbr>K3zSYlVU</wbr>  [ ]  Im probably gonna regret asking but where are Koki's parents   Yukano loses her memories and her comfy clothes <br> her bust became less ample <br> we got fishnets, ass and ponytail in exchange <br>I'm conflicted.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;her bust became less ample <br><br>it's about as ample just more bound. Fish net under mesh clinging to her bosom tightly</br></br></br>  <br>They look as ample as usual in that scene, but they felt a lot smaller everywhere else.
