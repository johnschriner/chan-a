[ What do you guys think about the adaptation so far, 3 girls introduced and now Suu, 2 chapters per episode (even if the studio probably is going to skip something) and is probably the best animation compared to other shows in this season full of awful QUALITY like Rokka.<br><br>To me is a solid 9/10, at least for now.<br><br>Youtube playlist, (there is another one with subs but isn't complete).<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Whats up with all this shitting on Miia?<br><br>She's a cute</br></br>  <br> leg man <br> not leg fetish <br>Seven seas got this one right.<br><br><br>What sort of life does this man lead? He destroy the button and zipper of his pants doing that. And also his belt. It's a matching suit so he either has to throw it out or get it repaired every time he does that. Not only that he has to buy another belt. <br><br>And how does he intend to get home? Does he have a car or use the train and just keep his hands in his pockets to keep his pants up? <br><br><br>This man must live a terrible life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not enough Papi fanservice.</br>  <br>They know she is endgame</br>  <br>Like Hell she is.</br>  <br> Goes to fancy exotic foreign restaurant. <br> I can has cheezburger? <br><br>American Cheeseburgers *are* exotic in Japan.<br><br> What chapter did this happen again? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to fuck papi-chan  <br>Because of first girl syndrome.</br>  <br>Can you elaborate that idea?</br>  <br> that one scene <br>Which one scene? She had a lot of scenes.<br> The last one with that guy who unfroze her? </br></br></br>  <br>Shitty personality. Most of the time she's annoying, jealous and clingy. And when she isn't she's just deredere with nothing else to make her character interesting.</br>  <br>Is she really a Chunni if she actually has the power to manipulate death is is part of the reason Darling is still alive?</br>  <br>I want to fuck Centorea's  breast  pussy.</br>  <br> The one in the batcave where Terry swallows a a whole lot of ooze <br> I'm not even into vore </br></br>  <br>She openly admits she isn't the reason Darling's alive. He's just too determined to die.</br>   What do you guys think about the adaptation so far <br><br>It's alright. Not mindblowing, not totally shit. The source material isn't stellar but both the manga and anime are enjoyable, which is more than can be said for other shit this season.</br></br>  Cerea is my girl of choice.  <br>Then why did she travel to save him at the hotsprings when the Yuki froze him solid? <br><br>She didn't even travel up with them and then appears when Darling's life is in danger.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not AOTY or anything  and I'm actually enjoying Shimoneta a little more than it  but it's fun and pretty cute, and so are the threads.</br>  <br><br> 2 chapters per episode <br><br>This won't necessarily hold true for every episode.<br><br>There are several chapters I doubt could economically be compressed down to 11 minutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't she just ask Rachnee to custom make her a silk bra? Isn't spider silk stronger than thousand-folded Japanese katanas?</br>  <br>I think this is part mistranslation and part author ambiguity. She has something to do with it.</br>  <br><br>First Girl Syndrome<br><br>Not only do they want to root for the underdogs, but rooting for the underdogs is hopeless because we're getting a Snek End regardless.<br><br>That translates to a bunch of jealous shitting on best girl,  even though most of the other girls are pretty good. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is waiting patiently for him.</br></br>  <br>I don't think she saved him. I think she just showed up because he was on the brink of death again.</br>  <br>I want to  love  Centorea's everything.</br>  <br> because we're getting a Snek End regardless <br>The Miiafag tears will be delicious.</br></br>  <br> first girl always wins <br> niggas be hatin' </br></br>  <br>It's a decent cheap adaptation of a meme-tier manga. I sure hope they add 500 more monmusu who no one cares about because god forbid anything happens other than fanservice.</br>  Number wan  <br>God, I hope Suu doesn't try something like that. There's a thin line between fetishistic and nightmarish.</br>  <br><br>Darling a best. Monmusu get rek.</br></br>  <br>What are these shorts? Did they come in the episodes?</br>  <br><br>That's not even vore. It's force-feeding.<br><br> And it's an underrated as fuck fetish in the S&amp;M category, and perfect for Slime-Girlslike Inque or Suu. <br> Personally, I totally wouldn't mind being held in place by Suu while she gives me a nice full meal of her excess slime, whether I wanted it or not. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Bike Cop will never get a Wolf-Girl partner. <br> They will never go on walkies <br> She will never get headrubs <br> He will never get alerted to her position by awooo~ </br></br></br></br></br>  S M I T H<br>M<br>I<br>T<br>H</br></br></br></br>  I'm enjoying it a lot thus far. But If they don't animate gif relayted or show Miia in one of Snake's outfits I will be salty for a very long time.  <br> tfw Miiafag <br> tfw want a harem end </br></br>  <br><br> Seriously believing Darling, or any of the girls that actually care about Darling, would stand for that. <br><br>It won't happen.<br><br>Darling is to much of an upstanding man to treat women like personal stock for his enjoyment. He's interested in what would be a traditional relationship.<br>The only girls that would POSSIBLY be up for this would be Suu and Papi (who are too retarded to understand what a real relationship is anyway), and POSSIBLY Rachnera since she's a slut anyway. Cera and especially Miia wouldn't stand for this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The main problem about "what is the best of the season" is how people judge every show, for example most of the people who likes Monmusume are going to say "AOTS" or "10/10" even if is a well done adaptation or not. On the other hand you have the casuals saying "it's ok" and the people who doesn't like it spouting "I-Is shit!".<br><br>There are some points to know how an adaptation is AOTS or at least a 10/10:<br><br>-Quality of the animation<br>-Follow the main source or change it a lot <br>-VA's work<br>-OP and ED<br>-It is friendly with new people? explain the main argument? the characters are likeable? <br><br>If we take these points Monmusume is really good, if Lerche keeps the hard work probably this adaptation is going to be a really good candidate for AOTS. Even stalker points shows how Japan likes it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no buddy cop shenanigans <br> she will never wag her tail when they catch a criminal <br> they will never fall in love <br> they will never uncover a huge underground crime ring </br></br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't need to be near someone to met them in the afterlife unless your implying that Lala is able to stalk Darling at all times.</br>  <br><br> She will never nuzzle her head against his neck <br> He will never get awoken to her laying on his bed, leg lightly kicking <br> They will never become the heroes the city deserves <br> Bike Cop will never beat Darling to the punch and marry Wolf-Girl, removing the impetus on Darling to marry a girl. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does this do it for you, Anon?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UpN<wbr>R9d-2Ed4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Being forcefed slime from a slime girl is my biggest fetish, especially if you can feel the slime moving around inside you as she is controlling it </br>  <br>Isn't that basically how she met him in the first place? And how Dullans are depicted in their myths and lore? If Daring wants to truly get rid of Lala he has to offer her gold.</br>  <br> tfw when flip flopping between her and miia <br><br>Both are adorable and both my top two monster girls</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think they did a good job on Cerea, they really caught her cute side good.   I want to do all sorts of naughty things to her even more now.  </br></br></br>  <br>She'd only be able to get away with it for so long especially since Ms Smith is already pissed at her for what she was trying to pull. <br><br>The big thing is if she had pale white skin she might be able to get away with being out in public, but since the blue skin is canon now, She sticks out like a sore thumb.</br></br></br>  There was horse version wasn't there?  <br>Stop being a retard and read the fucking OP.</br>  <br><br>the cutest <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bk4<wbr>bcPoaKNo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br><br>the cutest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and it was perfect in every way.</br>  <br>Why would I make my own webm when someone else has it already</br>  <br><br><br><br> Set up a chapter where Suu begins to feel like she needs not just be helpful in a practical sense but also in a nurturing sense for her Master to be a real marriage partner. <br> Darling comes in from mowing the lawn and makes an offhanded remark about being thirsty. <br> Suu dive-tackles him and holds him down, happily pouring her excess mass down his throat and into his stomach till he matches the physique of a full-term pregnant woman. <br> From that day on Darling could never walk by a dessert-plate of Jell-O without having a PTSD flashback. <br><br>Now I feel bad for imagining it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that all the girls are great in their own ways and fighting about who is best is pointless.  <br><br> especially if you can feel the slime moving around inside you as she is controlling it <br><br>That's OK for force-feeding, but unnecessary.<br>That aspect works better if it's a Slime-Girl giving you  a slime-enema .</br></br></br></br></br>   you will never be stuck with an icy-hearte, mean spirited Raptor girl due to the exchange program and slowly learn to love her as she learns to love you in turn, until eventually, one day, you get married <br><br>Why?<br>h<br>y<br>?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh anon, how could you completely miss the point about Darling's character and the harem setting? It's not about his personal enjoyment, it's about making everyone happy.<br><br>Darling literally conquers death every single day just for that purpose, as you can see in . He's not a caliph who wants to collect girls to be his concubines, he's fucking monster girl Jesus, coming back from the dead to redeem all of them with his huge and generous  heart. <br><br>Honestly, I'm surprised there are still people like you who don't get what MonMusu is all about. You'd rather shit on the other girls calling them retards or sluts when those are precisely the girls that already understand their situation. Miia has a long way until she realizes she's not the only one who loves him and that he'd never do anything that could make even one of them sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  all girls are best girls  <br><br> She will never learn to trust you enough that, one day, she asks if you could put a hood on her and take her out hunting. </br></br>  <br><br> Cera with her hair down <br><br>I'm Grand Wizard of the Horse Pussy Haters club, but DAMN would I even love to sit behind her and bury my face in that golden silk cascade.<br><br>10/10 hair, second only to  __Miia__ , because  nothing can ever beat red as far as hair-color goes. .</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of garbage I'm reading right now.</br>  <br>But she has no presence.</br>  <br><br> you will never have to deal with a tsundere <br><br>Thank God. Am I supposed to feel sad about that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't feel bad about that, it gave me a semi.<br><br>I see what you mean.<br>I'm fine with it either way though cuz that's my shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> from tip to root  <br>Mmm girl knows how to take care of her hair. When is she going to ask Darling to groom her?</br></br>  <br>Where's the snek one with audio?</br>  <br>It hurts.<br><br>Another idea I had for a spinoff, host takes in a monster girl who is of a species he's afraid of. Like a guy who's afraid of spiders taking in a spider monster girl, something like that.</br></br></br>  <br><br> it's about making everyone happy <br><br>A harem-ending would make most everyone involved miserable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> assuming she'd be tsundere <br><br>no.<br><br>Tsunderes are just bitches for no reason despite usually having feelings for the MC or whoever.<br><br>That's different from someone who's initially cold and mean and gets progressively nicer and nicer as they develop feelings of love and trust.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please stop with the fanfiction fantasy bullshit. It's obnoxious and autistic as fuck.</br>  <br><br> a raptor girl will never leave you presents of small game animals to cook for your dinner later </br></br>  <br>And then she leaves you high and dry.<br><br> I don't think she's coming back. </br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, that was me. I was mocking the guy picking the human in the monster girl show. I also have<br> Going to Baskin Robbins and asking for a hamburger/hot chocolate/hot anything. </br></br>  <br><br> complaining about the discussion of fetishes in a thread about a manga that is 90% a vehicle for fetish-porn </br></br>  <br>What I think is the adaptation is alright.

Suu, Papi, Rachnera and perhaps Lala are more open to it each day. All it takes is Cerea, Mero and, in particular, Miia, to be developed and there won't be a single person miserable in that house.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Slimes likely don't have the same psychological need for parental validation that other species have.<br>I doubt she'd feel bad about it.</br></br></br>  <br> the girls play part to become her replacement mother <br>   Lala does it the best </br></br>  <br> fellow red hair lover <br>red is the color of heaven</br></br>  <br>Discussing fetishes is fine, sitting there narrating your own personal fanfiction fantasy is Tumblr-tier and cringeworthy as fuck.</br>  <br> mfw there's 5 large girls and only 1 small girl for lewdness <br>Not very balanced at all.</br></br>  <br><br> Wanting your husband to not be fucking other women. <br> "egocentric" <br><br>When did Muslims start posting on this board?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Suu can be any size you want, why are you counting her as large?</br>  <br>I am shamed</br>  <br><br>Because that's 100% new to Monmusu-threads, huh?</br></br>  <br>Because she turns into big form whenever she does lewd things to Darling. So she's large.</br>  <br>Red haired girls are always sluts. Blue hair shows that they're refined.</br>  Which set of fluffy ears would you  gently nibble on?   <br>Great rebuttal. I'm counting the seconds until you start ranting about cuckolding.</br>  <br>Isn't that Kuudere?</br>  <br><br>There's not much to stimulate that wouldn't be painful from WITHIN the stomach, aside from some satisfying sloshing.<br><br>From the other end though, a Slime has plenty of things to work her magic on, namely the single most heavenly prostate-massage in the history of the planet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? She would smell like fresh cut spring flowers strewn across a babbling brook with a hint of lemon. And her hair would smell like Main and Tail.   Then i'd stir up that her, if you know what I mean.  </br>  <br> blue hair <br>distracting as shit<br> red hair <br>fiery and warm and fucking perfect</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Miia hated ?<br>see <br><br><br><br>Miiafags are delusionnal, cancerous and aggresive towards other -fag, that's why.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>You're making it very clear you have warped ideas on how marriage works. And yes, you're basically fine with asking the women involved to be female cuckholds.<br><br>I'm not really sure why I cam to /a/ expecting people to have knowledge on how healthy emotional relationships work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>kuudere is cool initial as the name implies, not mean.<br><br>meandere would be someone like an abused kid or something, someone who wants to love and be loved but is wary of other people.</br></br></br>  <br>And red hair isn't distracting at all?</br>  <br>It's not, but it's the kind of shit that got MGQ/MGE kicked to /jp/, and I'm not really fond of my phone taking several minutes to reload a 1000 post thread of (seldom good) OC that may or may not be related to my own tastes.</br>  <br><br>Yes, it's very distracting, because it makes me preoccupied with thoughts of having sex with that woman every time I look at her.</br></br>  <br>I'm not disagreeing with anything you posted. <br> As a matter of fact you've sort of won me over.<br>There is way more room and nerves on the other end that would feel fantastic, I agree. Either way I want a belly full of slime.</br> </br></br>  As an adaptation, it's as good of one the manga could hope for, but it's still a fairly mediocre harem that's only above others of its kind by the novelty of monster girls.  <br>The worst Miiafags are just as aggressive and delusionnal as any of the other fags besides papi and suufags who aren't</br>  <br>Are you implying lamias are muslims? Because they are totally okay with their husband fucking other lamias.<br><br>Ironically, Miia was seen by some readers as a prude among her village, but she only comes out as a selfish lamia compared to the rest of her species, if not immature. Darling's harem is actually God's punishment for her egocentrism.</br></br></br>  <br>That could we said about any waifufag in this thread, Anon.</br>  <br>And that's why red haired girls are sluts. Blue hair, on the other hand, is calmer, and therefore more refined.</br>  <br>The loli miko obviously.</br>  <br>Huh. Your last paragraph sorta describes Raven from Teen Titans, who is normally classed under KD. Aloof, slowly warming up to others. Oddly enough, a lot like Rach, even down to having multiple red eyes.</br>  <br>Sorry to disappoint you, Anon, but I'm not a Miiafag.</br>  <br><br>But I want to have sex with those too.</br></br>  <br>I'm a Papi fag but I know my place. This is not a series where a DFC fag should start a war against more favored girls.</br>  <br>I know in MGQ lore lamias are very possessive and territorial like regular snakes are, but I guess they do have giant orgies too.</br>    <br> Raptor girls would be way smarter than dumb-ass harpies like Papi, right? <br><br>Barely.<br><br>It's just Raptors have significantly more willpower and charisma, so they're *still* dumb, they just mask it with an air of mysteriousness and strong words.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tfw nobody else appreciates Rachnee <br><br>She has a tough exterior but a lot of integrity and care. I like her characterization even if I'm not much of a spider-fag.<br><br>I dunno how people can pick a favourite out of the current cast. They all offer something unique and appealing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be loving and tender sex, compared to the wild sex with the other kind of girl.<br> Not that there's anything bad at all about wild sex. </br></br>  <br>I think you might need a dictionary. If they are all married to him there's no adultery and they can't be called cucks. <br><br>Also, it's hilarious how you love to talk about it but always misspell the word.<br><br> how healthy emotional relationships work <br>Certainly not on jealousy and possessiveness.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> prude among her village  <br><br>Even tho her mom tells her she understands</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, in fact if I had to say<br>Cereafag are mostly not even revealing they are cereafag because of the "MLP, FILTHY HORSE PUSSY"<br>It can be said the same for Merofags with the "hurr Cuck" <br>Suufags are mostly saying "SUU BEST" and that's all<br>Papifag just compete with Poltfag to know who got the best butt<br>Rachnefag are the same as Suufag with more render<br>Miiafag, nah they basically have to humiliate other to make themselves feels good, it's probably caused by a single thing though, people who discovered the serie, saw her first and wants to fit in and follow the bad exemple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>all the girls are great  besides lala  some girls just appeal to some anons more than other girls</br>  <br> Even tho her mom tells her she understands <br>I said some readers understood that, not her village.</br></br>  <br> Raptor are smart retards </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Why are you all saying such things about the most American monmusu out there?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> If they are all married to him there's no adultery and they can't be called cucks. <br><br>Just because you call it "polygammy" that doesn't stop it from basically being an institutionalized form of cuckolding.<br><br> it's hilarious how you love to talk about it but always misspell the word. <br>Apparently you're the one that needs a dictionary, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Bike Cop will never get a Wolf-Girl partner. <br>He is only of the brothers of the original doujin protagonists. There is very good odds her would get his own monstergirl if he doesn't have one already.</br></br>  <br>so is there no corvid girls with hyper intelligence?</br>  <br>Isn't that why though? People can latch onto the girl that fits their tastes the best, and every girl  except Suu and the cuck  has enough characterization that none of them get typed as the boring generic girl.</br>  <br><br><br>Just throwing out the definition of Cuck for you two :<br>Cuck, short for “cuckold,” is a term referring to a man with a female significant other who engages in sexual activities with other men.</br></br></br></br>  <br>High and dry guy here.<br><br>Was trying for a subtle, old Simpsons joke with that one. As if a creature of that elegant nature would leave behind such a caring mate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Remember?</br></br>  <br><br> Because they are totally okay with their husband fucking other lamias. <br><br>Concubine. Not "husband".<br><br>And again, why does that matter? Last I checked we were talking about Miia and not her entire species.<br><br>Again, if you SERIOUSLY think the mindset of "I don't want my husband porking other women" is an "egocentric" one, you very clearly don't understand how relationships work and are most likely an insipid NEET that has never and will never touch a woman.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why are Miko so lewd?</br></br>  I want to  hold her tail as it wags   <br>But if you hold her tail, won't her tail start wagging her?</br>  <br><br>They're confident idiots, it's probably even more adorable than a normal Harpy watching them explain themselves.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't know any better, anon<br><br>Remember how mad the shrinekeeper was after he found out what she was doing?</br></br></br>  <br>For the same reason that Nuns are highly lusted after.

But stop trying to insert 3d values into 2d the only reason I ever want a harem end in stories is so nobody gets rejected, the whole point of a story is that it's fiction anything the author wants to write down can happen. I can write a story about a normal speechless earthworm that lives floats in a puddle outside of a highschool and somehow has a harem of the schools 20 most beautiful girls if i wanted to because it's fiction.</br>  <br><br>Cera would be a terrible harpy.<br><br>Tall and busty isn't aerodynamic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mero episode <br><br> Deep sea luminescent blind as a bat crazy looking mermaids <br> Tropical brown mermaids with colorful scales and frilly fins <br> Albino arctic mermaids with huge tits (blubber) and more dolphin/whale like appearance <br> bro-tier meek freshwater mermaids with neutral-toned scales </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so are the subspecies canon in the manga?</br>  <br> agree <br><br>Every thread we have had ever proves that wrong, Anon.</br></br></br>  So can we add to the other memes?

I'm surprised Vega Tale is still even alive. What's the point of his existence anymore? He might as well be Yamcha at this point</br>  Could he reach ssj10?  Cell can.  Yamcha can.  <br><br> Yamcha is actually a Saiyan <br> all the times he's been defeated has actually made him the potentially strongest Saiyan but he's never figured out how to train properly </br></br></br>  <br>I know, it's almost like DBZ is an anime.</br>  <br>That's why I said sudden you smartass , theres like 8 DBZ or DBZ related threads up right now.</br>  Who is Whis?  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Explain yourselves</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Careful if you say things like that its gonna be time.</br></br>    <br>Just saying that even yaharifags contain themselves.</br>  <br>Even Narutofags contain themselves. But the rules are selectively enforced, so it doesn't matter.</br>  <br>there should just be a faggy dbz general, or have the fucking mods make a damn sticky about this issue.</br>  <br>It's not bothering anyone though. Those threads just die in a few hours, really no different from the bait and shitposting we already had. <br><br>You know that you can just block them if they annoy you right?</br></br></br>  <br>and people can create generals as well.</br>  <br>Its not really annoying or anything , it just makes a lot of clutter of dead threads in the catalog , making a general would be a great since it provides more discussion and less clutter.</br>  <br>/a/ would sadden me if I didnt see at least 3 DB threads</br>  <br>There are people who gets annoyed when they see 10 different threads about the same topic.</br>  <br>Vegitto is like SSJ 4 transformation. It's already above SSJ 3 but far below SSJ 4. Vegitto transformation is not ki consuming like other SSJ transformation the same reason why SSJ 4 is more of permanent transformation and rarely have limited time. So they can be at that state in very-very long time or near permanent as long as they're not unconscious.</br>  <br>They can suck a boner</br>  <br>You should go somewhere else. /a/ isn't for you.</br>  <br>Wah, this thread isn't about softcore porn and moeblobs, I better throw a tantrum, that'll show em</br>  <br>Ok, quote the part of my post where I said that. Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Maybe you should because there always three up moeblob</br>  <br>Logic says that since Goku has the knowledge to perform the transformation then so should Vegito.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  That lightsaber move is cool as tits.  He Cant even die. He can literally just leave crumb size pieces of his body somewhere and regenerate from that in a few seconds. Punches don't work, energy blasts blast through him and he is like "whatever". Even the biggest spirit bomb in the series almost failed.  How is this anime pic related devoid of ANY gore ?!<br><br>As an audience, this is just insulting for a late nite anime!<br><br>Come on, even children-tier 7-no-taizai that aired last year @ 6 PM (Japanese time) was a gore-fest by comparison!<br> <br>Did Japanese TV watchdogs started getting more vigilant again?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why do you feel like it needs gore?  <br>This. It's not really necessary to the story.<br><br>There's enough guro anime out there to make OP happy. This anime is not one of them.</br></br></br>  <br> not reading the manga <br> not realizing the time-slot GATE is occupying in jp tv stations. <br><br>Seriously, GATE could have easily been a global summer blockbuster if it had more edge to it. <br><br>Seriously, watching the first 3 episodes of GATE is like watching a Rated R or MA content that's badly edited to make it PG-tier. What makes it even more intolerable is that now we have a PG-version and it's still slotted for midnite airing on Japanese TV!<br><br>I'm gonna stress it again, there is something seriously wrong when 7-no-taizai had more gore and is aired 6:00 PM JST and GATE is aired 12 midnite JST that's heavily sanitized and would not look out of place in children's anime timeslot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because GATE is bad OP. In all of its forms.  <br> complaining about gore <br>Where's my Rory panties?</br></br>  <br> Late-night anime has to be a gore-fest <br><br>That's your problem.</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read the manga or pick up the show, and don't plan to. I'm just curious as to why you thought it needed to be harder edged.<br><br>Anyway, the time slot is for the audience it aims to draw in. In this case, probably otaku.</br></br></br>  <br>To show off the destructive power of modern weapons and dragons. <br><br>A column of soldiers gets shelled by artillery and all they do is fall down? <br><br>An enormous dragon gets its arm blown off there's nothing? We don't see the limb. We don't see blood. It just flies away like nothing happened. <br><br>How can they show the gap in power and sheer destructiveness of modern weapons if we never see the results of it being used? Simply having a character saying "my, so powerful" has no meaning when they're looking at a bunch of unconscious bodies in pristine condition. <br><br>This also applies to Rory. She's an apostle for the god of death. She enjoys killing. In the anime she throws rocks and digs up the ground.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anime about people being brutally slaughtered <br> can't show blood  <br>That's your problem</br></br></br>  <br>Even that Mr bones anime has more gore than GATE. Also the GAte anime will be a fucking harem show.</br>  <br><br>That's a fair point and I don't disagree, but the studio is probably aiming to appeal to people who enjoy waifubait more than gritty/gorey shows.</br></br>  Gunslinger Stratos had more gore than this.<br><br>Then again maybe 2 people watched it so no one noticed or cared.</br></br>  <br><br><br>The story isn't about killing, but about two nations far too different meeting each other, with all the politics interest behind each nation's decisions. The battles are a plot device in the story rather than the central plot.</br></br></br>  <br>The manga version has more violence than anime version.<br><br>The gore scenes are present in both manga /LN.</br></br></br>  <br>Gore and violence are overrated, GATE doesnt need them.</br>  <br> can't <br>They don't need to. Why is gore porn necessary here? I understand people like that sort of thing (and there's nothing wrong with that, obviously) but why is it necessary? It would be nice if someone could answer this basic question.</br></br>  <br/>  OP here<br><br>another pet peeve of mine is that the first episode was suppose to be like a Japanese 9-11 !<br><br>Because the anime was totally sanitized that "9-11" effect was totally lost!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Plot device.</br>  is gore illegal in nipland? why do no shows except 80's-90's OVAs have gore?  <br>Even the fisrt 15 min of Beserk movie 1 trailer was censored.</br>  <br> Also the GAte anime will be a fucking harem show. <br>I'm willing to get another 2 cour season for that since the harem surely ain't showing itself this season.</br></br>  <br>War is a part of diplomacy, and war involves killing. A part of the story involves the Empire being unable to conceive or fully realize the immense gap in strength between it and Japan. So far they haven't shown that, just told. <br><br>Oh, the Empire just lost 50,000 soldiers? All we've seen is a bunch of random bodies, perfectly preserved, strewn around randomly.</br></br></br>  <br>Muh plot</br>  Big Boss?  <br>I'm not a gore-hound at all but it needs more punch than it has, even just some small changes would go a long way.</br>  <br>Killing is a part of Rory's character. Remove that and she's just your standard goth-loli. <br><br>In the manga the how and why Rory kills establishes the kind of character she is. In the anime she's just... good. We lost all that character development because it was tied to that fight. <br><br>At this rate Rory is just going to be another loli character who loves the MC for no reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just expecting the not romans using some magic bullshit to equilibrate the power diference but seems not happen in manga.</br>  GATE is supposed to be seinen. <br><br>We got something more family friendly than most shounen.</br></br>  <br>So his hair doesn't turn white in the LN.</br>  <br>adding gore would delay airing</br>  <br> seinen <br>Hanamaru Kindergarten is seinen, fuck off berserk fucktard</br></br>  <br>The third episode pf Mr. Bones showeed more gore than firsy 3 gates episodes together.</br>  <br> Hanamaru Kindergarten <br> Lolicon bait <br>So is sienen too</br></br></br>  <br>Just watch Akame ga Kill and Tokyo Ghoul, it has that edgy shit you crave so much</br>  Feels completely fake and I don't read the manga.<br>Especially when they came crashing through in the first episode. It's hard to make a big deal of what happened when nothing was shown.</br>  7 no taizai? wuts that   ?! <br> ! <br> !!! <br> ?! </br></br></br>  <br><br>not looking for hard edge.<br><br>GATE as presented reeks serious business like war, and it does not have the visuals to properly back it up...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit stop shilling this shit. I've read your Mr Bones shit thrice in 10 minutes already</br>  <br>because it was full of gore in the source</br>  <br> shilling <br>Your point is reasonable, but you're not using that word correctly.</br></br>  <br>Is this your first time watching an adaptation? I'd prefer this over sunbeams covering shit up</br>  <br>Good riddance</br>  I can't believe the mod deleted the last one because he didn't like the discussion about ignorantly racist scenes. Who the fuck finds these retards? <br><br>Anyway, Reinhard a shit Yang for life</br></br>  bump  <br>RIP Yang ;__;</br>  <br>Wow spoilers.</br>  <br>Frankly, I have no desire to discuss racist or misogynistic anime.

The filler in Alabasta did suck.  There's no way it's worse than the filler nowadays though. </br>  <br>That's the point, nowadays filler is 15/20 of a episode, but he complains more about 4 episodes he can easily skip.<br><br>And 4 episodes ruining the whole arc it's bullshit, even Ennies Lobby had more filler episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>What was the filler in Alabasta anyway? Can't remember much of that.</br>  <br>I remember one about a Bounty Hunter</br>  <br><br>Also the one about the sand pirates with the sand ship.</br></br>  reminder that we've seen doflamingo's eyes a long time ago  <br>Ace stayed with the crew for a bit trekking through the desert.

Now you niggers with inferior taste will try to ship robin with franky</br>  <br>TBH I like this ship more</br>  <br>Frobin a cute. Zoro/Robin also cute. It's all good, no fightin'.</br>  <br><br>stay mad plebs</br></br>  <br>nice tits</br>  <br>Nanda korea?</br>  <br>Obviously. Robin best girl</br>  <br>There need to be more side boob shots of Robin.</br>  <br>How was I mad?<br>I was stating that I thought the Thousand Sunny is a better ship then ZoRobin</br></br>  What could Sanji even have learnt during the time skip? There is only so much you can do with kicks, I think a technique like skywalk was the most logical follow-up.  <br> dwarf king look like he just woke from coziest nap ever </br>  <br>I'm 100% certain that Sector B is the coziest place one can imagine.</br>  <br> POP! </br>  <br>couldn't agree more</br>  <br>improved his kick strength<br>new recipes<br>can fly<br>haki<br><br>and I'm sure there's something else since he was never brought into a corner yet</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, my bad. I thought you were agreeing that Zoro/Robin was the superior ship.</br>  <br> Everyone knows black leg sanji has the craziest kicks <br> everyone prepares to defend/counter his kicks for when they have to fight him <br> big surprise <br> suddenly he punches </br></br></br></br>  <br>no, its all good, mistakes happen though pic related is undoubtedly my favourite One Piece ship</br>  <br><br>okama kenpo</br></br>  <br> &gt;suddenly he punches </br>  <br>I prefer the Moby Dick. But probably because that is the greatest novel in literary history.</br>  <br><br>would go against everything that defines the character<br>don't you want him to punch women too?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. thats a good one as well</br>  <br>i'd pay him to punch you</br>  <br>Donquixote's ship is definitely my favorite.</br>  <br><br>The only time Sanji punches women is when he punches them in the dick</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128629978 <br>This is really OC, but it makes me laugh.</br>  <br>Sanji's not a whore  unlike your mom </br>  <br> Attack cuisine <br> he learned how to cook with his feet <br> now he doesn't have to protect his hands anymore and can fight using all his limbs </br></br></br>  <br>Sanji's not much of anything</br>  <br> losing the point <br>Sanji needs his hands not to cook but to masturbate.</br></br>  If sanji really becomes a drag queen will that ruin his character even more? or would you be okay with it.  <br>what if he could masturbate with his feet</br>  <br>He'd whore himself out for nami, but not your mum</br>  <br>It's a shame it was destroyed by Akainu, but I guess that was necessary, because it does not belong in this era.<br><br>I would like it if Law's submarine was called the Nautilus, because if he is the Shiohige to Ruffy's Roger then there would be a nice parallel to the old man, both their ships having a name from 19th century literature.<br><br> captcha: pick all the boats <br>Nice.<br><br><br> not being able to fap with your feet <br>Casual.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck I hate that vid so much but I laugh every time</br>  <br>it would only be okay if he did it to become even madder and then stronger for a while<br>if he actually became a true nakama it would be so much shit</br></br>  <br>Full Okama might get annoying, but a secret Okama mode to counter Zoro's Asura would be hilarious.</br>  Who is doflamingos sancho panza?  <br> TBH </br>  <br> 8 legs <br> &gt;7 penises </br></br>  <br>whoever ends up saving him</br>  <br><br>While we are being literary, I still want a bug zoan user called Gregor. Maybe in Kaido's army?</br></br>  <br> sanji <br><br>Who?</br></br></br>  <br>This guy</br>  <br>Oh, right, I saw his wanted poster before the time skip</br>  <br>No problem</br>  <br>  He puts shoes on his hands to punch </br>  <br>This. Also Zoro is with Perona and Frobin best Robin ship.<br><br>Me too. Why is he saying he's making onigiri (and something about bread but I can't into kanji) though? Is this from a Japanese meme or something?</br></br></br>  Is this the guy you all thought was CP0?  <br> he thinks the anime is relevant <br>They fucked up underworld lucci, so of course they put a random guy there,</br></br>  <br> tfw you'll will never be threatened by Doffy </br>  <br>But they weren't at all. Alabasta was loooong, and had multiple locations, characters having to overcome their weaknesses to defeat opponents, some pretty good twists, but it did feel pretty long at points. <br><br>Dressarosa feels like a template for a One Piece arc, kind of like Movie Z. It's not bad, it's just not mind-blowing. Definitely better than the last few arcs. At least IMO.</br></br></br>  So how did that sea king appear in the middle of the track?  Did Kuma awaken his fruit? Some of his attacks and abilities have no correlation with each other whatsoever.  <br>he attacked captain bones and got cut in half<br>is there so few things you need to discuss that you actually wonder about that?<br><br><br>nobody knows</br></br></br></br></br>  Finally, a new week and a new chapter soon  <br>Zoro<br>Zoro ultimate weapon is a sword he wields in his mouth.<br>Guts rely on a armor.</br></br></br>  <br>Jumped.</br>  <br> alabasta at 63 chapters <br> dressrosa at 95 and counting </br></br>  <br>  Is this from a Japanese meme or something? <br>it's some sort of Frozen sketch <br>https://mixch.tv/m/d3EeBY4h<br>They probably changed the lyrics to fit Law more.</br></br></br></br>   strawhats drawn by oda's mouth <br>is this real?</br>  Why is Brook so based?  <br>Robin looks like fake Robin.</br>  <br>he's all talk</br>  <br><br>Filler</br></br>   0 major fights <br> only support role <br> did fuck all training during the ts (spent it just running from trannies)  <br> almost got himself killed due to nosebleed in FI <br> almost got Viola killing him due to his stupidity <br> jobbed to vergo <br> jobbed to doffy <br> hasn't been seen since the beginning of Dressrosa arc <br><br>Mr. Prince is dead baby, Mr. Prince is dead - 0 "cool" moments for him since the ts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>His hair is green?</br></br>  <br> jobbed to vergo <br>Let's be fair, who didn't?</br></br>  <br>To this day, it still fucks me up that Brook is a 80+ year old skeleton hanging with a bunch of kids</br>  <br>The anime is shit?<br><br><br>him confronting doffy was very cool</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I imagine Sector A is pretty cozy too.<br><br>Sector C would be hell.</br></br></br></br>  <br> jobbed to doffy <br>really nigga</br></br>  <br>Does the goatee mean he's a fake blonde?</br>  <br>It's pasta.</br>  <br>to be fair, he spent 50 years out of 80 alone on a ship, i guess his character didn't really develope much during this time.</br>  <br>I'm not quite sure what to think about this. <br><br>It doesn't look that green to me, it's more like this snot colour.</br></br></br>  <br>Hard to develop a man's character when there's no characters around HEYO~</br>  <br><br>Here's a question - does Brook still age?</br></br>  <br>He just ran at first. Once Iva got back he actually trained.<br><br>So basically the whole time Luffy was breaking in and escaping Impel down and then fighting at marineford he was running. Then Iva came and he learned cooking and fighting.</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't just run from Trannies though during the timeskip, he trained with Bonclay and Ivankov.</br>  <br> he trained with Bonclay <br><br>no</br></br></br>  <br><br> Bonclay </br></br>  <br><br>My mistake, its been awhile since I read it, I thought Mr. 2 escaped Impel down with Ivankov.</br></br>  <br>He was Me. Prince only one time ten years ago. Stop waiting for his return.</br>  <br>Hard to say.<br>His fruit gives him a second chance at life, but once he found his body it was already a skeleton. He's moving bones fueled solely by his soul and no actual living parts.<br><br>Maybe if he had found his body sooner, he would have died of old age or hunger like a normal living being.<br><br>And now that he can separate his soul from his body, I'd wager him being effectively immortal since you can crush his bones to dust and he could separate himself beforehand and "survive". You'd need a fruit capable of destroying the very essence of a soul to kill him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>our hero is still there</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it'd be pretty cool if he was immortal.</br></br>  <br><br> speedreaders <br><br>Even if ID was a while ago, he was shown;<br><br><br>On the front covers in PH.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128638397 <br><br> he doesn't read the manga </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128638397 <br>fuck off with your meme</br>  <br>Blondes get black facial hair all the time.</br>  <br>it's just a shitposter pretending to be an animefag<br>https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>v15naZh%2FBMBq1H8KYeQ3VQ%3D%3D</wbr></br></br>  <br>Most bro One Piece character</br>  <br><br>I know.</br></br>  <br>And how long ago was Punk Hazard? Like two years? I've read alot of other stuff in that time, I don't remember every detail.</br>  <br><br> I don't remember every detail </br></br>  <br>LOOK I'M FUCKING SORRY OK?!</br>   tfw Caesar won't become nakama <br>why live</br>  <br><br>Nah I'm jesting - I reread often.</br></br>  <br>Don't think so. His fruit gives him a second chance, not a third one. He may be a skeleton, but he can still "die", just look at the Ryuma fight in Thriller Bark; had he lost there, he'd be dead for good. He may be able to separate his soul from the skeleton, but only because he' still alive.<br><br>He's basically a really skinny no-DF human that can't swim.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hmm I think it'd be interesting if he could 'die' - e.g. in a fight, but not by natural means.</br></br>  <br> He's basically a really skinny no-DF human that can't swim. <br>He can Astral project and freeze stuff now though</br></br>  <br>b-but maybe he will</br>  <br>why is robin so tiny</br>  <br>Yeah, that's exactly how I can see him dying. There's no more flesh to rot and perish, but his body can be defeated/killed like any other human's.<br><br>He actually got lucky that it took him so long to find his body, because now he can't really die by any normal means.</br></br></br>  <br> implying he won't become the crew's permanent prisoner after they fail to get rid of him time and time again until he redeems himself by saving Luffy's life and is officially accepted as nakama under the occupation of   scrub boy .</br>  I made Vergo a straw hat  <br>you didn't make that hat and you have no friends.</br>  <br>Oh, I forgot that. So yeah maybe he's a bit better than a no-DF human.</br>  <br>Dude, there's only room for one photoshop artist in this thread.<br>Get out.</br></br>  Friendly reminder Mancock is the next Strawhat.  <br><br> "Hai guise, wut calur iz dis drezz? xDDD" </br></br>  <br>hahaha oh wow this takes me back</br>  <br>You suck.<br><br>Why is your dog blurry but orange coat not?</br></br></br>  <br>My money is on  Monet .</br>  <br>I'm sorry.</br>  <br>Reminder that the baroque works cover story took place 4 arcs after alabasta.<br><br>I hope you like waiting anon-kun</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128640854 <br>Sanji</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128640854 <br>Madara</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128640854 <br>Garp because i'm strong as fuck.</br>  <br>Guts fights Gods that Zoro doesn't even believe in.</br>  <br>post pics or you are lying</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Don't tell the mods.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128640854 <br>Charloss.

Veryo being alive makes sense since no one does from explosions. But Monet took tashigis attack and a stab to the heart. Ace didn't survive a hole in the chest. I don't see how surviving an attack to the heart is doable. Plus if she was was alive how will she find her heart? Plus the stone thing she was stabbed with is still in there not to mention there was blood leaking. And don't get me started on this she'll join the straw hats shit. If she is alive for some retarded reason she would want to slaughter the strawhats. Did anyone in baroque works think about joining the straw hats? Not even Mr.3 after being linked by croc thought of joining.<br><br><br>TL:DR<br>Monet is dead</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ace didn't survive a hole in the chest. <br>Jinbei did</br></br>  <br>Episode 0</br>  <br> Jinbei did <br>that hole didnt destroy his heart.

Igaram survived them, so did Nami (Sanjis Body) and Usopp</br>  A previous iteration of this thred made me realize that Hody, in his super-roided form, is in all probability stronger than Lucci.<br><br>I still find that a bit hard to believe, but the logic was sound.</br></br>  <br>Your retated</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>Lucci could be even stronger since the timeskip though.</br>  <br>Of course he was his water droplets flew through tonnes of buildings. What's even more crazy is Jinbe deflected those same droplets with his own.</br>  <br> You're missing the point, explosisons don't kill in One Piece <br><br>then why bother mentioning the gas at all? You could just say Law expected the explosion to kill them both somehow not taking into account that explosions apparently do shitall damage in OP universe<br><br>Of course they'd ride out the explosion with only minor burns and scratches</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As they were when they respectively fought Luffy, I mean.</br>  <br>Eh, I'm sure a Rokuougan could do that sort of damage too.</br>  <br>So he lives on sniper island?</br>  <br>Dont forget about Pell.</br>  <br>Damn. My retated is really hurt right now.<br><br>Sorry. I guess you weren't even born yet when Little Garden was happening.</br></br></br>  <br> Doffy and his entire crew are sent to Impel Down <br> nobody knows about Sugar's powers <br> entire prison stuff is turned into toys <br> ??????? <br> BREAK OUT! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seastone cuffs are probably standard for all prisoners, powers or not.</br>  <br>yeah but what are they gonna do when they go to put them on her? she only has to touch them.</br>  <br>she's unconscious<br><br>the cuffs are probably already on her</br></br></br>  <br>Have we seen her been taken away? or still unconscious with marines etc around her? She woke up last time relatively quick what's to stop it happening again</br>  Will Usopp ever get a serious fight again or is he just regulated to dealing with female chars with bullshit powers from now on? It was kinda funny with Perona and Sugar but come on we need to see how the nigga grew since the ts.  <br>He took out the cookie-cutter guy.</br>  <br> what's to stop it happening again <br>plot mostly</br></br>  <br> yfw Dellinger becomes a fuckhole in Impel Down </br>  <br> implying anyone would get close to him with these like that <br><br>the scent of crazy alone would keep people away</br></br></br>  <br>Do people even know she's an executive? Even Law didn't recognize her.</br>  <br>Even so as  said they could just think she's a child etc and leave her</br>  <br>Crazy or not, who could resist his legs</br>  <br>Law never saw Monet and Sugar when he was part of the Family. He only met Monet at Punk Hazard.</br>  <br>Cavendish</br>  <br>it calls her one of the 8 executives right there in the image</br>  <br>I wonder how the scene when Yasopp reunites with Usopp and asks him how his mother is doing will go</br>  <br>Didn't buggy escaped because they didn't know he was a user?</br>    <br>That's a shitty scan.</br>  <br> they were voiced by the same guy.... </br>  <br>manly tears<br><br>then actual tears later when he falls into his cup</br></br></br>  <br> we need to see how the nigga grew since the ts <br>He practically willed himself CoO during the Sugar fight so that's a great indication.  I enjoyed the Perona fight. </br></br>  <br> implying the villains level up. </br>  <br>fuck. this shit got me so pumped when i first read it. one of the best moments in dressrosa.</br>  <br>My dream fight is a fight between Usopp and some New World sniper who is so good they actually pin down the entire crew from an enormous distance.<br><br> Usopp loses and gets his hand blown off. <br><br> Franky makes him a robot hand. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For real, just how power is Zoro now after the time skip?<br><br>Could he actually be admiral level now?</br></br></br>  <br>   it's the size of franky's robot hands </br>  <br>That's probably gonna be what Usopp vs. Van Augur is like.<br><br>I kind of think it MIGHT be cool if their fight is the first that takes place as the Blackbeard crew is already on whichever island the BB vs Straw Hats fights take place on (maybe even Raftel? Who knows) and Usopp has to defeat Augur before the crew can actually land.<br><br>mite b cool</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just think it'd be cool for one of the crew to get a franky prosthetic.</br></br>  How many of the previous villains could Usopp defeat by now?  <br> Brook gets badly damaged in a fight and his bones are crumbling, he can barely keep his soul in <br> franky makes a metal skeleton body for Brook that he moves his soul into </br></br>  <br> Franky donates some of his own hair. </br>  <br>i dont see him taking out anyone before Lucci</br>  <br>He is getting rekt in Wano soon.</br>  <br> anyone before Lucci <br>Usopp&gt;Enel confirmed.</br></br>  <br><br>I remember that nearly the same thing was said about Sanji. <br><br>Someone being surprised that he was someone's underling.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah Seaking Usopp had some great moments in Dressrosa.</br>  I have notice some lack of this threads in /a/  Good, because now they're filled with the kind of shit that you've decided to start off with.  <br>Motherfucking this<br><br>Also, is there any godtier mango like that one ?</br></br></br>  <br>Or that one ?</br>  Remember, don't leave your imouto alone too long. She might slut it up with your best friend  That's what you get, you cheating harlot  <br>Onii-chan did nothing wrong. Fuck that little slut.</br>  <br>Onii-chan was not giving his imouto the proper amount of love, so she looked for it elsewhere. Everyone in that manga was in the wrong</br>  Same author as Nichibros  Probably because everyone is tired of all the /v/ermin and reddit fucks who come straight to them and complain nonstop about being told to conform or leave.  <br>This manga was trying so hard to make the MC out to be the bad guy though<br> How dare you get angry at your best friend for fucking your elementary school sister! <br> Wow, you won't let them date despite only being at least 10 years apart? <br> It's your fault our deadbeat father left us because you kept calling him out on being a deadbeat! <br> You're working hard to support me and get an education, but since you're not spending enough time with me I'm going to go have sex with your friend! </br></br></br></br></br>      <br>I know what you are trying to say, but that doesn't mean that every character in that manga isn't a piece of shit<br> Onii-chan is brutally honest, and works to hard for his sister <br> Imouto is growing up and wants to be loved, and given that onii-chan is always working, seduces his friend instead <br> Friend is an idiot for letting an elementary schooler seduce him, the only good thing he did was not come back in the end <br> Dad was a complete deadbeat who abandoned his children because his son called him out on it. <br>Yes, a lot of emphasis is put on MC being a piece of shit, but that is just to distract you from the rest of the cast being fuckers too</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How about that  suffering ?  <br>That was my point, MC is hardly the bad guy in the story. Sure, he's a pretty unpleasant guy but everyone else is just as bad or worse.</br>  C A N O N<br>A<br>N<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br>     tfw   the magazine fell through and the story never got picked back up   <br>This is such a depressing manga. Sure, the artstyle looks cute, but damn. Honestly, the biggest villain is either the imouto or the dad. The MC is a hardworking, but hard to like guy who just wants to care for his sister. The friend is a victim of circumstance.</br>    Be gentle when you dump the crazy ones  <br>The real kicker is that she get's off scot-free after shanking her ex-boyfriend in front of his sister. Sure, she's in a psych ward, but there were really no consequences for her</br>  <br> victim of circumstances <br><br>Yeah how can We blame him, it's just a peadophile that banged his best friend's little sister who's in elementary school behind his back while that friend worked his ass off for the only family that's left for him. (Yeah the pure little girl that the victim of circumstances deflored)</br></br></br>  <br>Used goods like her won't even sell at a clearance sale.</br>    <br> Woman cut her hair.  <br><br>Didn't read but dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok, let me rephrase. He was a victim of circumstance, right up until he kept their relationship going. If he had cut her off after the first time she seduced him, I would have more sympathy. But, as it turns out, little girl pussy is just too dank.</br>  <br>You shut the fuck up. She was more pure than your waifu.</br>  Let's get some decent pages going and not endless boring conversations over 8 panels.  If there is a third, I hope MC stops being such a massive faggot, and gives in to the crazy, qt, time bending mothgirl  Getting people into Mx0 knowing the ending.<br><br>YOU MONSTER FRISBEE</br></br>  <br>  Fuck you  </br>  <br>I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of  heart-breaking suffering </br>  <br>Fuck.<br><br>You.<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone should read it just to condemn japan for their shit taste.<br><br><br>What's the author up to these days ? Still making oneshots because all his series are getting cancelled ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone dropped that little gem in a father's day thread. I was caught flatfooted, and I fucking cried like a bitch.</br>  <br>Gets me everytime</br>  <br>Fuck. You. Anon. Fuck you right in your stupid face</br>  <br>Why does anyone read this shit series?</br>  <br>There are two hints in the biggest panel.</br>  How about, instead of suffering, some tall girls instead?  i don`t get it   fucks waifus and they came <br> turns strong men gar in the pants <br> even hot aunt is beginning to succumb to the true Genji power <br><br>Minamoto is the harem king we need</br></br></br></br>  <br>Posting a better page from later on when it gets a bit less lewd that isn't a downscaled jpeg from some reader site, because more people should read this series.</br>    <br>He fucked a girl in elementary school. He is not a victim of circumstance.</br>  <br> Anime never <br> Maybe it's a good thing </br></br>  <br>Updates when?</br>  <br>No, you are not a victim of circumstance even if you are only once seduced by an elementary school student.</br>  <br>Play Persona Q.</br>  <br>Never ever.</br>        Nothing makes my heart go doki-doki quite like stupid vampire girls falling in love            <br>Yeah, so sad she died.</br>  <br>It's really ambiguous, but there is no evidence to say whether she survived or not. For all we know, she died, and he's burning incense, and he see's her ghost. On the flip side of that, maybe the white hair is from the stress of her surgery, he's cooking and she just came home.</br>  <br>I'll never get why didn't the MC jump all over her. Guess that his charm was not being like everyone else but then again, what was the point?</br>    <br>so first I thought maybe they weren't actually fucking, maybe just some kissing or whatever. then she drops the bomb when she talks to him later about how when she grows up, it'll stop hurting when they have sex.</br>  <br>They're both nude. There was definately some little girl sexing going on here. Plus the look of shame the friend is giving off, and the horror on imouto's face</br>  <br> Naked on the bed <br> Maybe they weren't actually fucking <br>Anon, you can't possibly be this dense.</br></br></br>  <br> she means walk me home gently </br>  <br> walk her home gently  <br>every fucking time</br></br>  <br>maybe he spilled coffee on both their clothes so their only choice was being nude</br>    <br>My little anon can't possibly be this dense</br>  <br>This is such nonsense. He did what he could given how busy he was. His friend is a huge asshole for calling him immature and shit. He was, at first, but manned up when his retarded dad (who explained nothing) took the advice of a child and left.<br><br>Fuck, I'm still mad.</br></br></br>    <br>at least the omakes at the end served as a sort of palate cleanser after reading that mess.</br>    <br>HE COULD'VE SAVED HER</br>  <br>This. It's only good when it's against their will and it upsets them.</br>  <br>She even asked for salvation with those subtle "let's just go out"</br>  <br>Ah, yuri: just what I want from my trap manga.<br><br>Prunus Girl went to shit way too fast. Had great potential too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, they were worth reading to calm down. Plus, ending with yuri was good. I fucking love yuri.</br></br>  <br>The novelty wore off pretty quick. Though it was a happy end.</br>  <br>I this worth the read?</br>              <br>I'll riot if this doesn't end in happiness.<br><br>C'mon, you've got an infinite amount of time to get it right moth-chan.</br></br></br>  <br>This manga is fucking hilarious. Love the scumbag MC who has a thigh fetish.</br>      <br>Moth-chan chose a shit husbando, if he'll run away from her like that, and call her a monster. Then again, she did off his mom because she got in the way.<br> That lying fucking title <br>I thought it was going to be happy, with moth-chan actually being pregnant</br></br></br>    He did not deserve anything that happened to him in this arc.  ;_;       <br>no, its strange ive been here for 5 years and ive almost never seen a /a/ talk about this manga even though it has good art, good story, an anime adoption, neat /k/ stuff, gooks actually looking like gooks and is still ongoing</br>          <br>Is this Naze Toudouin Seiya 16-sai wa Kanojo ga Dekinai no ka? I searched by the guy's name but I'm not sure.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>name?</br>  <br>Sauce, yandex and reverse gives nothing.</br>  This manga made me fucking sob. Not light crying, actual sobs of pain.      <br>Reiroukan Kenzai Nariya.<br><br>Yes they do.</br></br></br>        <br>I love this one, mostly because every tradition and custom in the manga is so familiar to me since I'm  Turkish . Especially this part made me cry so much.</br>  <br>dont forget shes not wearing the right season uniform</br>      <br>thanks</br>    <br>So was she a normal girl possessed by something?</br>    <br>This guy looks like I wouldn't mess with him.</br>    whatever you do, don't click on the image    <br>Fuck, i can't remember the name for this.<br><br>The girls name starts with a K right?</br></br></br>    The NTR    <br> short as fuck <br> still taking forever to scanlate <br> some smartass translated just the ending for some reason <br>This happens far too often.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Kyoko</br>    <br>GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br><br>Doesn't Alibaba get shit on every arc though? I mean man, I stopped reading a while back, but he was always going though tough shit.</br></br>  <br>There's a TTGL manga?</br>  <br> Honestly, the biggest villain is either the imouto or the dad. <br>The girl is really selfish, but all kids are like that. There isn't any "real" villain, except the dad. They were trying to make him likeable, but he's still a piece of shit.</br></br>    <br>First arc is the worst so far, at least from what I've seen. I'm not caught up yet though, gotta read 60 or so chapters. This guy had it bad too.</br>  <br>This any good?</br>  <br>Luruku Mo Aru</br>  <br>holy fuck</br>    <br>Damn, you got me</br>  <br>He left because his son called him out on being a piece of shit, and his daughter got sick of hearing it. Why the fuck would you let your daughter, who is elementary school, push you out of your own fucking house? Jesus christ, the dad is a piece of shit</br>  <br>Well... I'll just tell you, you will feel the need of droping it every now and then</br>  <br>I may check it out then.</br>  <br>btw is in hiatus either by the translators or the mangaka</br>    <br>That's not a great sign, but thanks for the head's up.</br>  <br>This manga sure was a emotional rollercoster</br>  <br>fuck that manga and the most beta MC i've ever had the displeasure of reading</br>  <br>Yep. Basically, Kanda and the dad are human cockroaches.<br>I mean, the imouto told the dad to get out of the house so he can have peace from his chucklefuck son. Okay. But did he use the time out to search for a job and come back home ? Nope. Goin to rest in the mountains. He didn't even give a fuck about his son.<br>Kanda has by far the worst personality, he always puts up a good front and seems like a nice guy, and he's a little shit with no sense of responsibility or self control. And he still calls out MC, a "normal" teen (He isn't more of an asshole than your average 16 years old), on his being immature and shit.</br></br></br>    <br>This manga was really good. Wish it was shorter; there was too much nothing and unnecessary drama.</br>  <br> I think I may "love" this series for discussions about it. Everyone always sounds so passionate about their fury and interpretation can be varied. It's kind of exceptional. </br>  I hoping this thread is the best place to ask but I need help to find 2 mangas I read ages ago.<br><br>One was about a ninja girl who fell in love with a normal guy but the whole ninja clan ended up staying in the guys house they also made the :x face a lot.<br><br>The other I only read the start but it was where a guy was really good at playing piano (I think) but then ended up meeting a girl and doing drugs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even ignoring the fact that he didn't immediately run out of the house when confronted with a naked loli, and continued their fucking relationship, and then calls out MC on being a piece of shit. The only good thing Kanda did was not come back at the train stop<br>This manga tries so hard to make it seem like MC is the one at fault, when everyone in the cast is a piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>Second one is Bokura no Henbyoushi. The piano and drugs thing is only the first part, it's a collection of short stories.</br>  <br>Interesting read. I wonder what fate the prostitute will have. My gut tells me not good, and he'll have something to do with it.</br>  <br>Yeah, me too. I reread it a while ago, and the way the manga was made also enrages me. It's really pushing the MC as a selfish, unlikeable asshole when he's right about everything.<br>  He's still an asshole for forgetting his imouto's BDay  </br></br>  <br> when everyone in the cast is a piece of shit. <br>The little girl did nothing wrong. She's just a child, and had to shoulder crushing responsibility, which she did. Everything she did that was "wrong" should have been taken care of by the adults :<br>Kanda shouldn't have fucked her<br>Dad shouldn't have listened to her about getting out of the house<br> The only good thing Kanda did was not come back at the train stop <br>His way of doing things is absolutely despicable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Just because she's a little girl doesn't mean she's exempt from responsibility. Yes, the adults should've acted like adults. But she was the one who seduced Kanda and she was the one who told the dad to leave. She is also at fault here.</br>  <br>Even if his method of leaving was despicable, it was still the only respectable thing Kanda did throughout the entire manga</br>  <br>Well, he also helped out the MC a bit after the dad left.</br>  <br> Not-Kuro looking to sensei as a father figure in the authors next work. <br>I've always loved the relation ship between the teacher and Kuro, glad it's getting more focus in the next work.<br> even if the main guy and not-rin are boring as shit. </br></br></br>  <br>I really did feel that she was the most venomous character in the series. I realize it was because she was a product of her environment and I hope she got the therapy/help she needed after all was said and done.</br>  <br>Updates when. Chapter 11 raws should be out by now. I wanna see the two childhood friends fuck already.</br>  <br>I hope there's a third as well. Would love to see the MC get his mind broken and just fuck the moth girl for all eternity. I still have no clue what the fuck was going on though</br>  <br>And that makes up for all the other shit he pulled?</br>  <br> Just because she's a little girl doesn't mean she's exempt from responsibility. <br>Kinda does actually. She was even younger when both these things happened. And having a crush/trying to seduce an older teen is quite frequent among children. And it's always brushed off as a joke by the target of the affection. It just took a kiss for Kanda to lose self control and stick it in her.<br>She just told the dad to leave. It wasn't an order, but an advice. Dude booked it the second he heard her say that. Usually this would be followed by the dad telling the girl about why he can never abandon his children. But no. He listened to a 9 year old and left.<br>And keep in mind that for Kanda, she was desperate for affection, she has excuses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Given what happened in the second part, mindbreak is the only possible way moth-chan will have a happy ending, given faggot-kun's actions</br>  <br>It seems like the MC is stuck in some sort of time loop, like he's constantly reliving getting raped as a kid by a moth girl every single day...at least I think that is what's going on</br>  <br>Is IB a light novel or a manga original?</br>  <br>No, just saying.</br>  <br>Moth-chan is reverting time whenever he comes back. But I don't think his mom has ever come into the shed before. Something might have changed</br>  <br>From what I understand, she reverses time each time he returns, so she fucks him as a kid, he runs, 10 years later he gets headaches and returns, and she reverses time again to make him a kid.<br>It's like steins;gate, but instead of repeating time to save tuturu shes rewinding time to fuck the shota.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but to say she did "nothing wrong" is just false. She was the reason for everything that happened. But she shouldn't be blamed for it, I blame the environment she was raised in. Mainly her Dad though, if he just gave a little bit more of a shit about his family this wouldn't have happened.</br>  <br>People don't magically obtain the burden the burden of 'responsibility' on their eighteenth birthday. It's a gradual process where their family and society slowly raise the bar and more is expected of them. Whether or not a person is 'responsible' for something is complicated function.</br>  <br> But she shouldn't be blamed for it <br>Yeah sorry that's what I meant to say.<br>And I get she can be kind of scary as a child, and that now her personality's all fucked up, but she's still functional.</br></br></br>  <br>Barely. I'll be surprised if her tryst's with Kanda haven't made her dependant on using sex to get affection.</br>  <br><br>So basically if I'm right about this:<br><br>-He gets headaches like you said and decides to go back to his childhood home to find out what happened to him in the past<br>-He finds a shed in his parents backyard, where in which his headaches start getting progressively worse <br>-He enters the shed and meets the moth girl<br>-Moth girl rapes him in the present<br>-After he starts crying about how she was the cause of his problems, she reverts time back to the day he was raped as a child. <br>-He runs away as a kid<br><br>Going forward to the newest part of the doujin<br><br>-Once again the MC is back heading toward the shed, suffering from the same issues he had in the first one  basically once he left time reverted back to the present <br>-He enters the shed again and the same thing happens, although this time Moth Girl reverts time back to when he was a kid before she rapes him<br>-She proceeds to rape him as a kid<br>-As the kid is crying his ass off, his mother shows up, something that didn't happen before in the previous time loop<br>-The Moth girl panics and causes something to attack the mother. <br>-The kid runs from the moth girl and goes to rescue his mom<br>-Time once again reverts back to the present, where the MC is about to enter the shed yet again<br><br>so its like the MC is literally stuck in a timeloop put upon by the moth girl so that she can break him in so that he can fuck her for the rest of his life. However the mom showing up was interesting, as that didn't happen in the previous time warp in the first doujin. So I am assuming that different things will happen the more the moth girl reverses time...or something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Manga  but it gets shittier as the story goes on. </br>  <br>I'm guessing that there are slight variations each time, and this has happened before as the moth said "again... you are interfering again".<br><br>I'm guessing she keeps trying until she gets a timeline where he stop running away and he becomes hers.</br></br></br>  <br>If she'd been 12 or more at the time she told her dad to fuck off and kissed Kanda, I'd agree.<br>However, this wasn't the case. She was still a kid and there was absolutely no one who dared to say "Nah you're full of shit, you still have a lot to learn"<br>She was raised to be a substitute housewife, and that caused her to think that she's always right about how to handle the house better. She was alone all the time in her house except for Kanda, and when she did what could be called a gesture of desperation and yearning for affection, instead of giving her the usual speech about love and stuff, he gave the child a good dicking.<br>She isn't responsible for anything.<br><br>You might be right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How much is translated, I've only found up to chapter 9. <br> It's not as good, but it's still bearable. </br></br>  <br>Hopefully if the author decides to make another one, which might possibly happen, we'll defiantly get a mindbreak ending, where in which the MC in the present just gives himself to the moth girl</br>  <br> There hasn't been translations after that chapter, only raws </br>  <br>It seemed pretty clear in the epilogue that she hadn't been fucking anyone since then, though.</br>    <br>Let's be honest here, she's going to keep him as a shota sex slave for eternity.<br> Every time he ages past a certain point she just reverts back to him being a kid. <br> I love how a OPT turned into a discussion about the plot of a moth girl hentai. <br><br><br> Does it get worse? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its just so insane how this hentai doujin is. Yeah the moth girl is fucking hot and all that, but god damn is the plot drawing me in. Like I wanna see what shit the moth girl is gonna pull next</br>  <br> It does, sadly. Hopefully someone can pick it up so you can see for yourself. </br>  <br> How so? does the MC stop being an edgy faglord because of the power of friendship or some shit. <br> &gt;Last translation like 7 months ago.<br>It's dead isn't it.</br> </br></br>    <br>I said i'll be surprised. I didn't say it was a definate. Maybe onii-chan finally showed her the affection she was craving.<br> Or maybe she and Onii-chan are doing the dirty </br></br>  <br>Sauce? It looks like decent read.<br>Cant find it.<br>Pretty please</br></br></br>  <br>Would you rather have your imouto get fucked by creepy pervy men or do it yourself?</br>  <br>God tier romance manga. This is how you mix sex into story.</br>    <br>Why do you fags self insert into this fucked up situation?</br>  <br>Most overrated thing in OPTs.<br><br><br>MC was awful, but Karin was pure happiness, and that was enough to carry the manga until the rejection, when it went to shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's talking about it hypothetically, you dunce.</br>  <br>Maybe not god-tier, but definately worth a read. Cheating aside, of course, if that's not your schtick</br>  <br><br>Think about it. I'd equate it with letting your kids drink at home because it's a safe place.</br></br>  <br>Except if the reason you're doing it is that she's dependent on sex for affection, that's like letting your alcoholic kids drink at home.</br>  <br>Well it'd be in moderation like only twice per day</br>  <br>But that's still just going to worsen the issue if she's overly attached to sex. You need to make her not dependent on it, not just give it to her.</br>  <br> some smartass translated just the ending for some reason <br>Why do people do this? It's cruel and unusual.</br></br>  <br>Google fu is failing me.</br>  <br>You fail yourself.</br>  <br>Sauce?<br>Show some mercy please.</br></br>  <br>Mitsuharu's short story.</br>  <br><br>Did the trap turn out straight?

She bares some fault and blame.</br>  <br>How recent was that? I just remember seeing some twitter post saying it will be coming back summer of 2015</br>  <br>She technically  cheated on his boyfriend with MC.   But still, she was using him and didn't deserve to be with him.</br>    <br>Yuusha mc is more of a ZR fetishist</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are all you butthurt.
