She might slut it up with your best friend  That's what you get, you cheating harlot  <br>Onii-chan did nothing wrong. Fuck that little slut.</br>  <br>Onii-chan was not giving his imouto the proper amount of love, so she looked for it elsewhere. Everyone in that manga was in the wrong</br>  Same author as Nichibros  Probably because everyone is tired of all the /v/ermin and reddit fucks who come straight to them and complain nonstop about being told to conform or leave.  <br>This manga was trying so hard to make the MC out to be the bad guy though<br> How dare you get angry at your best friend for fucking your elementary school sister! <br> Wow, you won't let them date despite only being at least 10 years apart? <br> It's your fault our deadbeat father left us because you kept calling him out on being a deadbeat! <br> You're working hard to support me and get an education, but since you're not spending enough time with me I'm going to go have sex with your friend! </br></br></br></br></br>      <br>I know what you are trying to say, but that doesn't mean that every character in that manga isn't a piece of shit<br> Onii-chan is brutally honest, and works to hard for his sister <br> Imouto is growing up and wants to be loved, and given that onii-chan is always working, seduces his friend instead <br> Friend is an idiot for letting an elementary schooler seduce him, the only good thing he did was not come back in the end <br> Dad was a complete deadbeat who abandoned his children because his son called him out on it. <br>Yes, a lot of emphasis is put on MC being a piece of shit, but that is just to distract you from the rest of the cast being fuckers too</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How about that  suffering ?  <br>That was my point, MC is hardly the bad guy in the story. Sure, he's a pretty unpleasant guy but everyone else is just as bad or worse.</br>  C A N O N<br>A<br>N<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br>     tfw   the magazine fell through and the story never got picked back up   <br>This is such a depressing manga. Sure, the artstyle looks cute, but damn. Honestly, the biggest villain is either the imouto or the dad. The MC is a hardworking, but hard to like guy who just wants to care for his sister. The friend is a victim of circumstance.</br>    Be gentle when you dump the crazy ones  <br>The real kicker is that she get's off scot-free after shanking her ex-boyfriend in front of his sister. Sure, she's in a psych ward, but there were really no consequences for her</br>  <br> victim of circumstances <br><br>Yeah how can We blame him, it's just a peadophile that banged his best friend's little sister who's in elementary school behind his back while that friend worked his ass off for the only family that's left for him. (Yeah the pure little girl that the victim of circumstances deflored)</br></br></br>  <br>Used goods like her won't even sell at a clearance sale.</br>    <br> Woman cut her hair.  <br><br>Didn't read but dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok, let me rephrase. He was a victim of circumstance, right up until he kept their relationship going. If he had cut her off after the first time she seduced him, I would have more sympathy. But, as it turns out, little girl pussy is just too dank.</br>  <br>You shut the fuck up. She was more pure than your waifu.</br>  Let's get some decent pages going and not endless boring conversations over 8 panels.  If there is a third, I hope MC stops being such a massive faggot, and gives in to the crazy, qt, time bending mothgirl  Getting people into Mx0 knowing the ending.<br><br>YOU MONSTER FRISBEE</br></br>  <br>  Fuck you  </br>  <br>I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of  heart-breaking suffering </br>  <br>Fuck.<br><br>You.<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone should read it just to condemn japan for their shit taste.<br><br><br>What's the author up to these days ? Still making oneshots because all his series are getting cancelled ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone dropped that little gem in a father's day thread. I was caught flatfooted, and I fucking cried like a bitch.</br>  <br>Gets me everytime</br>  <br>Fuck. You. Anon. Fuck you right in your stupid face</br>  <br>Why does anyone read this shit series?</br>  <br>There are two hints in the biggest panel.</br>  How about, instead of suffering, some tall girls instead?  i don`t get it   fucks waifus and they came <br> turns strong men gar in the pants <br> even hot aunt is beginning to succumb to the true Genji power <br><br>Minamoto is the harem king we need</br></br></br></br>  <br>Posting a better page from later on when it gets a bit less lewd that isn't a downscaled jpeg from some reader site, because more people should read this series.</br>    <br>He fucked a girl in elementary school. He is not a victim of circumstance.</br>  <br> Anime never <br> Maybe it's a good thing </br></br>  <br>Updates when?</br>  <br>No, you are not a victim of circumstance even if you are only once seduced by an elementary school student.</br>  <br>Play Persona Q.</br>  <br>Never ever.</br>        Nothing makes my heart go doki-doki quite like stupid vampire girls falling in love            <br>Yeah, so sad she died.</br>  <br>It's really ambiguous, but there is no evidence to say whether she survived or not. For all we know, she died, and he's burning incense, and he see's her ghost. On the flip side of that, maybe the white hair is from the stress of her surgery, he's cooking and she just came home.</br>  <br>I'll never get why didn't the MC jump all over her. Guess that his charm was not being like everyone else but then again, what was the point?</br>    <br>so first I thought maybe they weren't actually fucking, maybe just some kissing or whatever. then she drops the bomb when she talks to him later about how when she grows up, it'll stop hurting when they have sex.</br>  <br>They're both nude. There was definately some little girl sexing going on here. Plus the look of shame the friend is giving off, and the horror on imouto's face</br>  <br> Naked on the bed <br> Maybe they weren't actually fucking <br>Anon, you can't possibly be this dense.</br></br></br>  <br> she means walk me home gently </br>  <br> walk her home gently  <br>every fucking time</br></br>  <br>maybe he spilled coffee on both their clothes so their only choice was being nude</br>    <br>My little anon can't possibly be this dense</br>  <br>This is such nonsense. He did what he could given how busy he was. His friend is a huge asshole for calling him immature and shit. He was, at first, but manned up when his retarded dad (who explained nothing) took the advice of a child and left.<br><br>Fuck, I'm still mad.</br></br></br>    <br>at least the omakes at the end served as a sort of palate cleanser after reading that mess.</br>    <br>HE COULD'VE SAVED HER</br>  <br>This. It's only good when it's against their will and it upsets them.</br>  <br>She even asked for salvation with those subtle "let's just go out"</br>  <br>Ah, yuri: just what I want from my trap manga.<br><br>Prunus Girl went to shit way too fast. Had great potential too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, they were worth reading to calm down. Plus, ending with yuri was good. I fucking love yuri.</br></br>  <br>The novelty wore off pretty quick. Though it was a happy end.</br>  <br>I this worth the read?</br>              <br>I'll riot if this doesn't end in happiness.<br><br>C'mon, you've got an infinite amount of time to get it right moth-chan.</br></br></br>  <br>This manga is fucking hilarious. Love the scumbag MC who has a thigh fetish.</br>      <br>Moth-chan chose a shit husbando, if he'll run away from her like that, and call her a monster. Then again, she did off his mom because she got in the way.<br> That lying fucking title <br>I thought it was going to be happy, with moth-chan actually being pregnant</br></br></br>    He did not deserve anything that happened to him in this arc.  ;_;       <br>no, its strange ive been here for 5 years and ive almost never seen a /a/ talk about this manga even though it has good art, good story, an anime adoption, neat /k/ stuff, gooks actually looking like gooks and is still ongoing</br>          <br>Is this Naze Toudouin Seiya 16-sai wa Kanojo ga Dekinai no ka? I searched by the guy's name but I'm not sure.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>name?</br>  <br>Sauce, yandex and reverse gives nothing.</br>  This manga made me fucking sob. Not light crying, actual sobs of pain.      <br>Reiroukan Kenzai Nariya.<br><br>Yes they do.</br></br></br>        <br>I love this one, mostly because every tradition and custom in the manga is so familiar to me since I'm  Turkish . Especially this part made me cry so much.</br>  <br>dont forget shes not wearing the right season uniform</br>      <br>thanks</br>    <br>So was she a normal girl possessed by something?</br>    <br>This guy looks like I wouldn't mess with him.</br>    whatever you do, don't click on the image    <br>Fuck, i can't remember the name for this.<br><br>The girls name starts with a K right?</br></br></br>    The NTR    <br> short as fuck <br> still taking forever to scanlate <br> some smartass translated just the ending for some reason <br>This happens far too often.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Kyoko</br>    <br>GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br><br>Doesn't Alibaba get shit on every arc though? I mean man, I stopped reading a while back, but he was always going though tough shit.</br></br>  <br>There's a TTGL manga?</br>  <br> Honestly, the biggest villain is either the imouto or the dad. <br>The girl is really selfish, but all kids are like that. There isn't any "real" villain, except the dad. They were trying to make him likeable, but he's still a piece of shit.</br></br>    <br>First arc is the worst so far, at least from what I've seen. I'm not caught up yet though, gotta read 60 or so chapters. This guy had it bad too.</br>  <br>This any good?</br>  <br>Luruku Mo Aru</br>  <br>holy fuck</br>    <br>Damn, you got me</br>  <br>He left because his son called him out on being a piece of shit, and his daughter got sick of hearing it. Why the fuck would you let your daughter, who is elementary school, push you out of your own fucking house? Jesus christ, the dad is a piece of shit</br>  <br>Well... I'll just tell you, you will feel the need of droping it every now and then</br>  <br>I may check it out then.</br>  <br>btw is in hiatus either by the translators or the mangaka</br>    <br>That's not a great sign, but thanks for the head's up.</br>  <br>This manga sure was a emotional rollercoster</br>  <br>fuck that manga and the most beta MC i've ever had the displeasure of reading</br>  <br>Yep. Basically, Kanda and the dad are human cockroaches.<br>I mean, the imouto told the dad to get out of the house so he can have peace from his chucklefuck son. Okay. But did he use the time out to search for a job and come back home ? Nope. Goin to rest in the mountains. He didn't even give a fuck about his son.<br>Kanda has by far the worst personality, he always puts up a good front and seems like a nice guy, and he's a little shit with no sense of responsibility or self control. And he still calls out MC, a "normal" teen (He isn't more of an asshole than your average 16 years old), on his being immature and shit.</br></br></br>    <br>This manga was really good. Wish it was shorter; there was too much nothing and unnecessary drama.</br>  <br> I think I may "love" this series for discussions about it. Everyone always sounds so passionate about their fury and interpretation can be varied. It's kind of exceptional. </br>  I hoping this thread is the best place to ask but I need help to find 2 mangas I read ages ago.<br><br>One was about a ninja girl who fell in love with a normal guy but the whole ninja clan ended up staying in the guys house they also made the :x face a lot.<br><br>The other I only read the start but it was where a guy was really good at playing piano (I think) but then ended up meeting a girl and doing drugs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even ignoring the fact that he didn't immediately run out of the house when confronted with a naked loli, and continued their fucking relationship, and then calls out MC on being a piece of shit. The only good thing Kanda did was not come back at the train stop<br>This manga tries so hard to make it seem like MC is the one at fault, when everyone in the cast is a piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>Second one is Bokura no Henbyoushi. The piano and drugs thing is only the first part, it's a collection of short stories.</br>  <br>Interesting read. I wonder what fate the prostitute will have. My gut tells me not good, and he'll have something to do with it.</br>  <br>Yeah, me too. I reread it a while ago, and the way the manga was made also enrages me. It's really pushing the MC as a selfish, unlikeable asshole when he's right about everything.<br>  He's still an asshole for forgetting his imouto's BDay  </br></br>  <br> when everyone in the cast is a piece of shit. <br>The little girl did nothing wrong. She's just a child, and had to shoulder crushing responsibility, which she did. Everything she did that was "wrong" should have been taken care of by the adults :<br>Kanda shouldn't have fucked her<br>Dad shouldn't have listened to her about getting out of the house<br> The only good thing Kanda did was not come back at the train stop <br>His way of doing things is absolutely despicable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Just because she's a little girl doesn't mean she's exempt from responsibility. Yes, the adults should've acted like adults. But she was the one who seduced Kanda and she was the one who told the dad to leave. She is also at fault here.</br>  <br>Even if his method of leaving was despicable, it was still the only respectable thing Kanda did throughout the entire manga</br>  <br>Well, he also helped out the MC a bit after the dad left.</br>  <br> Not-Kuro looking to sensei as a father figure in the authors next work. <br>I've always loved the relation ship between the teacher and Kuro, glad it's getting more focus in the next work.<br> even if the main guy and not-rin are boring as shit. </br></br></br>  <br>I really did feel that she was the most venomous character in the series. I realize it was because she was a product of her environment and I hope she got the therapy/help she needed after all was said and done.</br>  <br>Updates when. Chapter 11 raws should be out by now. I wanna see the two childhood friends fuck already.</br>  <br>I hope there's a third as well. Would love to see the MC get his mind broken and just fuck the moth girl for all eternity. I still have no clue what the fuck was going on though</br>  <br>And that makes up for all the other shit he pulled?</br>  <br> Just because she's a little girl doesn't mean she's exempt from responsibility. <br>Kinda does actually. She was even younger when both these things happened. And having a crush/trying to seduce an older teen is quite frequent among children. And it's always brushed off as a joke by the target of the affection. It just took a kiss for Kanda to lose self control and stick it in her.<br>She just told the dad to leave. It wasn't an order, but an advice. Dude booked it the second he heard her say that. Usually this would be followed by the dad telling the girl about why he can never abandon his children. But no. He listened to a 9 year old and left.<br>And keep in mind that for Kanda, she was desperate for affection, she has excuses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Given what happened in the second part, mindbreak is the only possible way moth-chan will have a happy ending, given faggot-kun's actions</br>  <br>It seems like the MC is stuck in some sort of time loop, like he's constantly reliving getting raped as a kid by a moth girl every single day...at least I think that is what's going on</br>  <br>Is IB a light novel or a manga original?</br>  <br>No, just saying.</br>  <br>Moth-chan is reverting time whenever he comes back. But I don't think his mom has ever come into the shed before. Something might have changed</br>  Which Love Live would you battle in a pillow fight?  Maki of course.  i battle rin!  Now, I've lost it.    What was her deal? Why was she such a fucking bitch the entire series?  <br>Critical lack of dicking</br>  <br> She was a bitch <br>She was only a bitch when bro was doing something stupid.</br></br>  <br>Selfish cunt.</br>  <br>Literally the kiss of death.</br>  <br>Pretty much this.</br>  Read the guide before asking questions<br>buyfag.moe</br>  C A N A D A<br>A<br>N<br>A<br>D<br>A</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>This one was up first.</br>  I don't even want them anyways.

I really don't see a problem with these because this picture maybe screwing with perspective.<br><br>Source: Ten million years of model painting experience, 500 hours of Microsoft paint experience.</br></br></br>  I think I'm finally going to start getting some male figures. There's been a few I've wanted but they would look out of place surrounded by so many females, but between this and Archer with Shirou's hair, I think it's about time.    How did this turn into this?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bOM<wbr>qR4Y_-8U</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I would so get this is breasts weren't exposed like that. I don't know why since I have lewder.</br>  <br><br> Nico's mouth <br><br>What the fuck.</br></br></br></br>  FREEing a shit.  So did Koufuku Grafitti get anything at all? I really wanted some nendos but didn't see any.  <br>This. <br><br>It'll look so much better</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this? Image search not helping. Not getting anywhere with tags on MFC.</br>  <br>Those figures aren't even that bad. <br><br>The fuck is with all these lumps?

No matter how I look at this, I am counting two extra lumps per side.</br>  <br>http://whl4u.jp/wh22/exhibit/galler<wbr>y/<br>A bunch of the figures are in here, you can also check #wf2015s on twitter for all the other stuff</br></wbr></br>  I'm going to put Rin's dog leash on her like the bitch she is.  <br>Most definitely. Yes.</br>  <br>Thanks man. Didn't spot her with the flat_chest tag. Guess sort by release date wasn't a good idea.</br>  <br>Yeah, sort by addition date is better if you're looking for something specific. She has no release date yet.</br>  <br>FUCK YOU</br>  <br>There's literally no difference between 3D and clay sculpting nowadays.</br>  <br>Well. As a start, you can hit up MFC and search by the tag "wf2015s" then filter stuff from there.</br>  <br><br>thanks, have a chaika</br></br>  Anyone collect Chaos TCG? I'm thinking about getting into it. How many boxes are usually needed to make a set?  <br><br>I tell you some secret</br></br>  Does this shit get checked at customs when you buy them?

Just really odd looking ones. But yeah, that shit's all fucked up. Not to mention the gracilis isn't anywhere close to it's origination point.</br>  <br>That is beautiful.</br>  <br> external obliques <br>Now I see it. Yes, that makes sense with human anatomy... but damn, it's weird to see obliques that big on an otherwise skinny little girl.</br></br>  Why do people care so much about how the anatomy compares to real people when their eyes are alien eyes?  Cool, I guess... I'm always happy for more 2hu nendos, and SA is my favorite game, but I can't help feeling like this is going to be a disappointment. What kind of accessories could she possibly have besides hearts and... more hearts?<br><br>Really wish they went with Rin and Utsuho instead. That would be awesome. Rin could have a little wheelbarrow and zombie fairies, and Okuu could have fire effects and a removable control rod...

I don't know if you just came to /a/ a month ago, but figure discussion comes and goes. We post pictures of NSFW figures sometimes and the mods have no problems with this, generally, since there's no other way to talk about these figures. During periods in between major ero figure announcements, we would naturally only talk about SFW figures.

I really don't get why they're not going with something more dynamic. Is it because they don't care?

Over the past couple of days I watched the Monogatari series and really enjoyed it. Am I a pleb with shit taste?<br><br>And why is Hachikuji best girl?<br><br> Also, I now have a toothbrushing fetish </br></br></br></br>  <br>owari in 2 months</br>  <br>Monogatari is for men with fine taste. Only plebians with the attention span of a goldfish would argue otherwise.<br>It's the epitome of theatricality and actually subtle character development.</br></br>  <br>Why do you need /a/ to validate your tastes op?<br><br>And you know why she's best.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh you're in for a treat with the Monogatari threads on /a/.</br>  Normally I'm not bothered by having to watch anime in English, but this series was different. I really felt like I missed out on some important dialog because of the translation.<br><br>As an example, there seemed to be some clever wordplay in the Hachikuji/Araragi scenes that completely went over my head, which I assume is because it didn't translate well.<br><br>It's things like this that make me want to learn moonspeak, but I have no other uses for it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Monogatari is one of the few examples of a series that is popular because it's good. Anyone on /a/ that says it's bad either has zero attention span or is trying to stir shit up for keks.</br>  <br>One of us.<br>Here, have a snake.</br></br>  <br>pretty much one of the few good harems out there</br>  It's a harem but it's good.

I absolutely loved that tension only to end it on such a note.  <br>For me, in regards to monogatari, the slot for best girl is solely dependent on which of them is the most enjoyable to listen to. Most of them I really like, especially Hackikuji and Tsubasa, but none as much as Shinobu.<br>I fucking love Shinobu.</br></br>  <br>Snailfags are nice. They rarely insult other girls. I like them. Also helps that she's one of the best girls.</br>  <br>you have great taste, my friend, Monogatari is a masterpiece of modern animation.<br>Snail is best girl because all the gataris are best girl.

Every genre can be good, anon-kun.</br>  <br>Most harems aren't very good.</br>  <br><br>I liked  Hyakka RyÅran: Samurai Girls </br></br>  <br>I enjoyed NouCome. It was amusing.</br>  <br>Except most harem dont have something where its heavely implied to be an ex that meets up with the other harem girls aswell.</br>  <br>People are glad he's dead. There is nothing likeable about him other then he got what he deserved.</br>  <br>Stop it Karen-chan, please.</br>  <br><br>You're not wrong. Monogatari's best feature is the characters.</br></br>  <br>Banana butt boy why arent you at your condo again?</br>  Guess who was raped by her step father, /a/?  <br><br>Are you kidding? I thought he was pretty likeable. I was upset that he died immediately after he had finally redeemed himself.<br><br>He was a better character than Cat, anyway. Cat was worst girl. All her arcs were boring as hell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't pay attention to Karen-chan, she's just an autist. And you probably need to watch Hanamonogatari.</br>  <br>You</br>  <br>He didnt, he cant redeem himself since people who steal from children obviously are psychopaths.<br><br>Again, the liar fabricated it. Hence why the illogical consistancies.<br>People also pointed out that its disgusting to see another male guy meeting the MC's harem girls, let alone the implication that he was hitagis ex, which it wasnt and she joked about it in her dry way, but its still disgusting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, banan butt boy here, which is his yaoi homo defender tends to ignore logic. Such as hana is before and logicly he is already killed by other people he scammed, but it was technicly araragi who did it.</br>  <br>Do you want to talk about it?

As proven in Hana which chronologically happens after koi, where Kaiki dies according to the lie he tells us in his story.<br><br>Sorry Karen, based Kaiki is still alive and well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence why he lied about everything, including mixing fact and fiction, and just lied about everything.<br><br>Hana is also before koi,hence why he is in hell telling his story. Logicly he died by ougi in some other fashion since that ougi is someone who "punishes liars".<br><br>Sorry banana butt boy, but you have to find another yaoi boy to fuck you in the ass, your other guy is not hot in the sense of attractiveness, but due to burning in hell.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Banana butt boy, just because you are a cuck does not mean other wants to have your hobby. That includes what other people do to your butt. I wouldnt be suprised if it was hitagi's dad aswell that did something simular since you can relate to people like the conman clown. <br>I'm not a cuck, I'm not a fag, but I will admit I think girls wearing clown make-up is one of the sexiest things to rarely exist</br></br>  <br>Why in gods name would you want a girl in an anime that was with someone else's beforehand and then meeting up with him several times?<br><br>I thought it was just a meme, but you do seem like a cuck, a bisexual one though,not a homosexual one.</br></br></br>  I read Kizumonogatari yesterday at the suggestion of an anon from here and shiiiiiiiiiiiet. I was not expecting it to be SO FUCKING GOOD.  <br> Hence why he lied about everything, including mixing fact and fiction, and just lied about everything. <br> Hana is also before koi,hence why he is in hell telling his story. Logicly he died by ougi in some other fashion since that ougi is someone who "punishes liars". <br>So you're telling me we got a whole story that's completely made up aside from the one part in the end where the person telling the story supposedly lies, and your only back up to these claims is your ridiculous head canon?<br><br>Naw mate, face it, best girl is alive and well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are defending a homosexual clown that you could make an anime arc named "lovestory" soley focused on what happens to your bowels.<br><br><br>You are also ok with this.<br> a girl in an anime that was with someone else's beforehand and then meeting up with him several times <br><br><br>If its just someone you bang sure, but this is the fucking main love interest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why in gods name would you want a girl in an anime that was with someone else's beforehand and then meeting up with him several times? <br>I don't. Crab a shit.</br></br>  Monogatari is pretty much Avant Garde: The Anime  <br>I was doing fine, until that last frame.   I'm not a snailfag but fuck me if Hachikuji isn't perfect. </br>  <br>nice bait made me reply</br>  <br>You are saying that the fiction wasn't made just to benifit the conman and liar who have done something simular before, let alone the latter is a strawman on your part, and instead that he is dead due to ougi's intervention by logic and reason.<br>Infact you have no argument and the only thing you can back up is your own emotions isnt it?<br><br>Face it cuck, worst guy is dead and suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br> animation never </br>  <br><br> yfw Kaiki dying was a symbolism of his bad self dying <br> thats why he grew a beard and appeared in Hana as a good guy <br><br>Hana is not before Koi, it is chronologically proven to be after. Not to mention it's very obviously near the end.<br><br>It's just 2deep4u<br><br><br><br><br>Februrary, 2016.<br>[Hope Intensifies]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You are also ok with this. <br> a girl in an anime that was with someone else's beforehand and then meeting up with him several times <br> If its just someone you bang sure, but this is the fucking main love interest. <br>I'm not okay with with it, it's just a fact that this is the kind of girl the love interest is, a shit one<br><br>best girl never wins, this is a pretty well known fact</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how people can go on /a/ and not watch monogatari. We had daily threads for the last 6 years.</br>  <br> that pic </br>  <br> You are saying that the fiction wasn't made just to benifit the conman and liar who have done something simular before, let alone the latter is a strawman on your part, and instead that he is dead due to ougi's intervention by logic and reason. <br> Infact you have no argument and the only thing you can back up is your own emotions isnt it? <br>christ you talk alot<br><br>I'm saying the story was mostly true, I'm saying kaiki really did end up doing good actions against all odds, and I'm saying the only major lie in his story is that he died in the end of it. Why was that the only lie? Because it's the only lie disproved directly at the start of Hana which has been proven to take place after koi.<br><br>Dunno where you're getting all these head canons about ougi doing magical shit off screen and kaiki being in hell despite absolutely nothing telling us about it<br><br>You're funny</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We'll be keeping those threads up for at least 2 more thanks to Kizu coming Soon(TM)</br></br>  <br> beliving the words and unreliable narration of a liar and conman who steals from children <br> not having heard of the term "long con" <br> Infact the word "con" is short for confidence trick, to gain confidence first. <br><br><br>Hana is before Koi, it is chronologically proven to be after. Not to mention it's very obviously near the end. <br><br><br>Its like a dan savage who was bisexual and yet not so smart enough to look up the dictionary.<br><br><br>A long con or big con is a scam that unfolds over several days or weeks and involves a team of swindlers, as well as props, sets, extras, costumes, and scripted lines. It aims to rob the victim of huge sums of money or valuable things, often by getting him or her to empty out banking accounts and borrow from family members.<br>How the flying fuck would you ever trust a transexual clown for his word just by the look alone? let alone after you KNOW he is a liar and thief who stole from children? thats the sign of a psychopath who cant redeem himself, and just lied about the narration.<br><br>Hence his death is proven by ougi is "punishing liars" which was before his unreliable narration.<br>The liar and thief lied again, gee what a suprise. Someone who stole from little children lied again, what a suprise. he even stole from hitagi and others remember?<br>Thats why the long con is the same reason he joined the exorcists, he knows if they are any way connected to those naive folks then they certainly have a tendancy to be naive. Like he couldnt cure crab first, he cant cure nadeko for sure, and neither help monkey in anyway. The nadeko part was fabrication while the kanbaru thing was just a lie like when he tricked those kids about the charms.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> delayed to february 2017 <br>It'll happen, you and I both know it.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pWd<wbr>d6_ZxX8c</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Your source is the conmand and liar, and he is known to lie so he isnt reliable source. Infact even if hana was after koi it wouldnt be a surprise if kanbaru saw an illusion, hence why he could run so fast.<br>Of course that is if.<br><br><br>Ougi is an spirit, so like those other spirits of course he/she can do shit offscreen,whenever its making others do it or do it her/himself.<br><br><br><br>Then stop trying to imply it with your defense of said person who meets up with love interest.<br>That includes the other harem girls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In the end, Kaiki is an anime character. Do you really think anyone gives a shit if he lied during the story? Until we get some solid evidence that he did stuff for reasons other than what was shown in Koi why even give a shit?<br><br>If all of Koi was a lie then there is no real reason he did anything but if that was true he'd lie and say he had a really good reason.<br><br> inb4 you'd think he'd lie about lying about lying as long as everytime he does so it benefits you <br><br>Why do you accept him calling himself a liar if he's a liar?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I bet it's already ready and they're just circle jerking to it in private until they're done making all the other seasons.<br><br>Kizu is the iron grip Shaft has on our balls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you have absolute nuthouse logic<br><br>So you'd rather believe that all the events shown on screen except the one you like because of your unreasonable butthurt caused by one character aren't really happening, and instead of all these things happening stuff you've made up is happening off screen as evidenced by nothing but your head canon<br><br>either way, Hana is told by monkey, and monkey isn't an unreliable narrator and you should therefor have no reason to doubt that Hana takes place after koi and that Kaiki is still alive... and best girl</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, thats why he discuss his shitty character.<br>Do you really think people care for the word of a liar and conman? from what was said over and over again, his actions BEFORE his narration tells he is a liar and conman.<br><br>He would lie if it benifits him, even if it amuses him of his boredom in hell.<br><br>Why do you keep doing strawmen?Check his previous behavior from bake and nise, he is a conman and liar, even other witnessed what he did.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> he is a conman and a liar <br> check bake and nise <br><br>You mean when he agreed to leave the city after being told to do so and didn't return until he was requested to come back?<br><br>He really conned us on that one!!!!!!111!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you'd rather believe that all the events shown on screen except the one you like because of your unreasonable butthurt caused by one character aren't really happening, and instead of all these things happening stuff you've made up is happening off screen as evidenced by nothing but your head canon<br><br><br>Your own wrods right back against you, that includes the fact he is a unreliable narrator since he is a liar which is well known before he narrates.<br><br>So you would believe the words of a conman and liar who steals from children? thats great anon would you believe and trust the word of a psychopath who you know are a psychopath when he says he is going to tell you a story where your parents really are if they went missing?<br><br>Monkey is, as evidence by his speed there. If spirits can magicly make monkey arms appear on a human, then it certainly can induce illusions and fabrications. That is if hana was after s2. Which it isnt, and he is dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean when he stole money from children and this is confirmed from others and his other acts that were confirmed?</br>  <br> Do you really think people care for the word of a liar and conman? <br>Only if it's the most based liar and conman in anime history. You're the only one who doesn't love him.<br><br>How does it feel to have such obscure and shit taste? The rest of us will never be able to come close to grasping how lonely you must feel as the sole person in the universe to not worship our lord and savior Kaiki</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do you think Koi takes place after Hana? You do realize that is literally impossible if you follow the timeline because Graduation ceremony was when Nadeko would kill Araragi and Araragi is already graduated in Hana. Kaiki "decieved" Nadeko a month before graduation, so it could not be after Hana.<br><br><br><br><br>And after leaving the city he was no longer confirmed to be conning anyone else. He in fact seemed to be just kind of going around pointlessly. Going to shrines to watch people "Throw away money"<br><br>He still agreed to leave the city and then didn't lie and kept his word. How did he lie in that scenario?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Acording to what source? the liar?<br><br>Acording to who? someone who steals from children and con others for a living would not stop logicly, but just move to another city to continue. Unless there is huge evidence he got a stable job somewhere else. Though I supose someone who is a serial murderer might stop after 88 murders, since nobody can find the 89 victim, yet.<br><br><br>The most horrible one.<br>You're the only one who love him you silly cuck, though I supose if even there were other cucks, people wouldnt want to be with you guys for a reason.<br><br><br>How does it feel to have such obscure and shit taste and being a bisexual cuck?<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Snail thread derailed by a single obvious bait </br>  <br>yeah you got me, but it was so anoying when people acted like cucks you couldnt believe it.</br>  <br><br>There's a difference between acting like cucks and being in awe of autism.</br></br>  <br> You're the only one who love him <br>I can guarantee that every single person in this thread but you is a kaiki supporter, you're the only person I've ever seen disliking kaiki in these threads and it ain't exactly rocket scientist to tell which posts are yours since your distinct posting style is pitifully hilarious</br></br>  <br>let him, he's keeping this alive and giving us an excuse to say nice things about best girl</br>  <br> Februrary, 2016. <br>Anon. February doesn't have 30 days. Kizumonogatari won't be on February 30th because 30th doesn't exist. It was a hoax. A simple joke.</br></br>  <br> hilarious </br>  <br>Holy fuck do you even read the previous post before vomiting your answer on the keyboard?<br>You're seriously as retarded as the other faggot you're arguing with.</br></br>  <br>man I look forwards to Kizu now</br>  More Hachikuji<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RcF<wbr>fLglB0Yw</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TDf<wbr>PyJKwmO4</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=R2o<wbr>uVSWIqL4</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=MZh<wbr>wuWiTUhE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> vomiting your answer on the keyboard? <br>I quite like this visual image of myself vomiting words on my tacka tacka 95 keyboard</br></br>  <br><br>Who are you?

Unless Kaiki is actually the narrator of Hana as well, which he isn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Might be wrong though, since "ourhotwives" forum got quite alot of members. They cucks homebase seems to infiltrate other parts of the internet.</br>  <br>He didnt, someone who steals from kids is a psychopath, let alone his other behavior. he didnt redeem himself, no reason for him to do so.<br><br><br>Let alone when one can puzzle toghether that they fixed the nadeko problem with actualy excorcists who can excorcist them, he cant as evident by the crab situation (he wouldnt though even if he could, since he is a edgelord villian)</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kaiki was in the club with all the important exorcists do you honestly believe he doesn't actually have any powers even though he can fuck someone up with a single touch?<br><br>That's why he can run faster than a human, just like Oshino can stop three people with one limb each while balancing on a single foot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaiki's biggest scam is tricking people that he isn't a fucking great exorcist</br>  <br>No he does not, he is tricking them out of their money. he is a conman and liar remember?<br><br><br>Noo, oshino is a someone who can cure people, he couldnt even if he wanted too. The latter would be the same reason karen could do those insane stunts. Shaft is mainly responsible for it.<br><br><br>He is with them to try to get their money, as he tried with other people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> braids <br> big tits <br> cute face <br> glasses <br> girly mannerisms <br><br>Holy shit, original design Hanekawa is the one and only (and best) thing to come out of this series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So how did Kaiki lie to make Karen's fever debilitating if he has no powers?</br></br>  <br>but he wasn't motivated by money in koi, he was motivated by helping his niece<br><br>I mean sure the money did encourage him a little even if it was a lot less than what he'd usually agree it, but that's just because he's such a lovable little kike bastard</br></br></br>  <br> good animation <br>You're kidding right?</br></br>  <br>It wasn an illusion remember.<br><br><br><br>No he wasn't, he is a liar remember? Like others stated, dont trust a liar. Same reason he is in it with the exorcists, to get money from them, he steals from kids for shits and giggles.<br><br>If they are related, its no wonder he thinks he can do the longcon as he tried with kanbaru.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It wasn't an illusion? So it was real powers then.</br></br>  <br> No he wasn't, he is a liar remember? Like others stated, dont trust a liar. Same reason he is in it with the exorcists, to get money from them, he steals from kids for shits and giggles. <br>Provide so proof that any of what you say is true. No offscreen head canon shit that you made up. Only shit that happens on screen.<br><br>Fucking prove anything you say is true</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think he means good art.</br>  Please stop going for that fucking bait  <br>If you got evidence he didnt steal shit based on the other episodes where he wasn't the source, feel free to do so. if not then those episodes speaks for themself when he stole from those kids and from hitagi. No offscreen canon or words from a unreliable narrator or known liar, only shit that happens on screen.<br><br><br>the power of magic?</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/xZ_Wp4L9Qzg?t=374  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-HO<wbr>AuiY5XFQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5AM<wbr>hXnMjrUw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Because fags like you need IMPRESSIVE animation in fighting scenes to be satisfied.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the power of magic <br><br>So you admit that Kaiki actually has powers.<br><br>Your shit posting wont work if you agree with me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you got evidence he didnt steal shit based on the other episodes where he wasn't the source <br>He did steal shit. Nobody is saying otherwise.<br><br>We're saying that despite being a greedy and thieving bastard, he still actually saves peoples lives and cares for a very specific set of people, and that he's still alive. Disprove all of these facts with actual events in Monogatari, no head canon.  You can't </br></br></br></br>  <br>1. there hasn't been much since snail left. what? koi, hana, and tsuki? koi was awesome anyways, hana was a pretty neat story that focused on SOMEONE ELSE, and tsuki would've been shitty with or without snail<br><br>also, snail comes back in owari</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ononoki was told by Gaen, who knows everything, that Kaiki stole from Hitagi and didn't help her with the crab because he was helping cut the mom out of the family.<br><br>Ononoki isn't an unreliable narrator.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The story is told and narrated by him, that includes that the doll is there. No way gaen can know everything in the first place.<br><br><br><br>Then im glad you admit you were wrong, and that what we are saying here is that a greedy and thieving conman and liar cant be trusted. He does not save people nor cares for other people and only wants money to benifit himself. Disprove all these facts with actual events in monogatari thats not sourced from a liar. you cant.<br><br><br>Your shitposting wont work if you agree with me. no powers then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Please just listen to <br><br>Also post more cute girls.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its also evidence by the fact he could help her first which would take less time. Either nisio is being a bad writer or he was being a bigger cunt for trying to break up the family.<br><br><br>Hitagi never wanted it but wanted to try to help her mother out, hence why she wanted him dead and still does.<br><br><br>Like stealing from those kids he did it for shits and giggles.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dem hanekawas</br>  <br><br> no way gaen can know everything in the first place <br><br>But she does though.<br><br><br>You didn't refute my point though. You said that Kaiki is a liar and has no powers, then you said he has powers, now you're saying you originally said he had powers. This is a sign of mental illness called delusions.<br><br><br><br><br>But I'm enjoying the bait, and it's keeping the thread alive. Just ignore us and keep posting cute girls. I like those too.<br><br><br><br>He was her love interest and saw her being around this abusive mother, realized he needed to get rid of the mother to save his love, but didn't realize his love wanted the mother to stay.<br><br>He stole from the kids for money, not just shits and giggles. Name one time when someone other than Kaiki said he did it just for fun, since Kaiki's word on his reasoning cannot be believed beyond the undeniable fact that he was raking in cash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>If you got evidence she does, feel free to post it.<br><br>You didnt refute my point, you said he has powers, glad you admit you got a mental ilness and delusions towards your autism and cuckyness.<br><br>And no she wasn't unless you got evidence for that from a non liar source. Logic and reason would tell you one wouldnt do that even if one tried to be a "anti hero" but he isnt he is a villian.<br><br><br>So you admit he is a villian then again if he stole from kids for money? Its like taking candy from a baby and you silly cuck defend your boyfriend like that? you just admitted he is a psychopath and not trusthworthy, ever.<br><br>Hence he did it for shits and giggles aswell, not just because it was easy. He is not a source to be trusted you clown since he is a liar, even you admit to it now. Hence unless you got reason stating he didnt, then no, a psychopath does that aswell. and since he is one its evidence. if you got evidence he isn't from a non liar source feel free to post it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like this anon said. Just post more snail while enjoying the show. Wish I vould join in but I'm on my cellphone</br>  <br>He is just baiting since he defends him. No matter how many times one debates that you can't trust someone with his behavior even if he didn't steal from people or tricked them out of thier money and was a conman, they wouldnt believe it.<br>Fools believe what they want to believe. Weakminded people tend to do that, both the conman and him are weakminded and tend not to do what the majority of people would do, to be cynical from time to time instead of beliving what one wants to believe.</br></br>  <br>You truly invest a lot of time and effort into shitposting</br>  <br>Thats you, but if you got evidence you weren't feel free to post it.<br><br>So far you haven't, you didnt refute any point and only got more desperate when you lost your debate points.<br>Maybe you shouldnt defend psychopath who are pathological liars....and actually famous for it.<br><br><br>Either that or you must be the biggest SJW tumblr yaoi fanboy on the planet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She constantly knows things before anyone else and has never once not known something that someone else does.<br><br>You had no point, you simply shit-posted a response to me catching you being an idiot. Now you're literally just going, "I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I!!!!?!?!"<br><br>It's very easy to tell from the dialogue between characters that there was once something between Kaiki and Senjougahara. She either pretended to like him, or lied to him and tricked him. Either way, Kaiki loved her.<br><br>It depends on if you actually think stealing money from kids is bad. The money was taken from middle-schoolers so it probably came from their parents and thus he was stealing from adults who decided to give their money away to idiots.<br><br>Show me your Psychology degree and or the writer stating that Kaiki did it just for shits and giggles. Otherwise it is simply an assertion you are making that he did it for those purposes.<br>"HURR DURR PROVE HE WASN'T!" Burden of proof is on you.<br><br><br><br>And you're in a Monogatari thread every day on 4chan discussing a fictional characters theoretical motivations with a stranger online. It's not as if you're some paragon of truth buddy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  every girls is best other than snake and arguably cat  <br><br>Cat was pretty cool. Helping Koyomi find Shinobu as well as develop his character was pretty baller of her.<br><br>Snake is just complete garbage though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Since you got no source from no liar, you further admitted to be wrong on every point. But if you got somehow can find a source thats not from a liar and conman then feel free to post it. Stealing from children means you are as amoral and immoral as him.<br><br><br>"Why are you against people banging your mom anon? im sure she would have left anyway."<br>You rationalising evil and immoral acts is hilarious when its given back right at you. We arent even talking about how he tried to get araragis other sister killed since he told the other excorcist about her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>snake is worst girl but has the best arcs<br>cat is not bad at all (I think she catches too much flak around here) but she has pretty terrible arcs, especially the snoozefest from the beginning of second season</br></br>  <br><br> points are refuted <br>"U HAS NO SOURCE"<br><br>Tsukihi is a shit anyways so who cares about her?<br>Karen isn't much better.<br><br>All of Araragi's family could die and the story impact would be minimal because they're so shit in fact.<br><br><br><br><br>I just think that cat was a bit odd and changed opinions too much. But then you have to remember that it was possessing a high school girl so it makes sense to a degree it's illogical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsukihi is a shit anyways so who cares about her? <br>I care you sperglord.</br></br>  <br><br>List her redeeming qualities.</br></br>  <br> POINTS ARE REFUTED I SAY SO! <br> no source given from non liar, while the other sources are from non liars from other episodes. <br>All of your family could be fucked and you would gladly accept it "hey its a dog eat dog world after all!"</br></br></br>  <br><br>You are providing no source either, so I saw it only fit to do the same and provide things that you could easily understand if you remembered more about the anime other than the parts where Kaiki was the bad guy.</br></br>  <br>She's friends with best girl.</br>  <br>Literally the only character in the monogatari series who is true to herself as seen in Zoku.</br>  <br>Thats you, hence why sources from other episodes were stated, you have no episode from no non liar.<br><br><br>So far you haven't, bake and nise contradicts you.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They aren't friends anymore. Sengoku actively avoids Tsukihi and Tsuhiki avoids her.<br><br><br><br> true to herself <br> is literally a physical embodiment of lying <br><br><br><br>Bake and Nise prove that Kaiki is a man of his word since after being told to leave town he agrees to do so and does not return. He also no longer is shown to be scamming people anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are there any monkey fags left  <br>yes</br>  <br>Thus no source in bake and nise he didnt lie to them and isn't a liar and conman. Someone who steals from children logicaly is a psychopath and will continue to be so and do everything he can to his own benifit.<br><br><br>If you got evidence he got a job to back up your claim, then feel free to do so or if he didnt steal from those people or kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't she helping Nadeko with her manga?</br>  <br><br>No, he was a liar and a conman but changed his ways after Bee when he agreed to leave town. He is never again mentioned to be conning people so assuming he did continued is entirely up to your opinion.<br><br><br><br>She didn't let ANYONE see them. I don't think she helped with 'em.<br><br>Her parents, even Koyomi weren't allowed to look.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everything bad that these characters have done was redeemed in this scene  <br>Really? Memes aside, Kaiki was probably my favourite character of the anime.</br>  Who else enjoyed the comedy more than than fanservice?  <br>No source stating he didnt steal from those children, thus like said before, he will continue to do so unless provided from a non liar source. He does everything to benifit him, no reason for him to quit now by his previous behavior and lack of empathy.</br>  <br>I don't know moon, but every Anon who has talked about what happens to Nadeko after Koi says she's openly working on her manga with Rara-chan, she cut her hair short, and she's making an effort to say Koyomi-san instead of Koyomi-onii-chan. They said all this comes from a chapter from Tsukihi's point of view.</br>  <br><br>I never said he didn't steal from the children. Though doing one wrong does not mean that is the norm for you.<br><br>Did Kanbaru continue to hurt people because they were better than her?<br><br>Did Hanekawa continue to hurt people because of the cat and tiger?<br><br>Did Nadeko continue to hurt people because of the snake?<br><br>Did Shinobu continue to hurt people because she literally eats humans?<br><br>Nope, they all changed. It only makes sense Kaiki changed as well.<br><br><br><br><br>Ah, well then I guess after she decided to embrace her manga side she got some help and let people see it. I just didn't see it in the animes and the only LN I've read so far is Kizu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed. Someone who goes as low as him would never stop doing shit like that.</br>  <br>I honestly don't remember most of the fanservice and can't name the scenes unless someone mentions them specifically. I couldn't care less about it compared to the plot and jokes.

Psychopaths tend to do that. If you got evidence he didnt steal from children and thus wouldnt be a psychopath, feel free to do so.<br>If not, then logicaly like psychopaths tend to do, he will continue. Nothing indicated he felt remorse and he just lied further and tried to rationalised it, he only left town to benifit him as evidence people caught up to his shit when people started contacting him like she did.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's mostly out-of-nowhere stuff and the extended scenes like the Shinobu bath scene and toothbrush scene.<br><br>Also this, from the scene I posted before: https://d.maxfile.ro/fnciisrgqk.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't watch his anime at constant 0.25x speed to properly appreciate every frame of animation </br>  <br><br>Shinobu had been eating people for nearly 600 years yet she stopped.

Like being burned alive for being a fucking furry!</br>  Fun Fact: When a Lamia fully encoils her lover in her tail,  preferably while he is naked, but with clothing on it still works,  she can allow the surface of her tail to become hyper-sensitive to stimulus by human-sense standards. The surface of her tail, when coiled around a human, can likely sense everything from heart-beat to the subtleties of them breathing in and out, all the way down to hard to notice minutia like tiny differences in body-temperature and the change in directions of bloodflow. Having sensory-nerves receive this information from a surface that is coiled around a human's body several times gives them an almost three-dimensional cognition of what's going on in their lover's body, almost like some sort of natural MRI machine. Imagine it the same way you can feel an item completely enclosed in your hands, but if you could feel the same details on objects several orders of magnitude larger.<br><br> This ability to detect and monitor all sorts of minutia about human biology, as well as a general knowledge of how to use it to their advantage (which is likely passed-down through generations of Lamias from elders to new generations) allows them to know just how and where to squeeze, rub, caress, slither, lick, constrict, etc. in order to bring the recipient maximum pleasure. They know what your body wants better than YOU know what your body wants, and they have the ability to give it what it wants. </br></br>  <br> f/a/ggots  <br><br>You DO know you can talk like a normal person on 4chan right?</br></br></br>  <br>The Spiders are all big Venga Boys fans.</br>  <br> Bitching because OP call him a faggot. <br><br>First day on 4chin reddit-kun? how new you are retard? <br><br>You're on /a/, you're a faggot, i'm a faggot and everyone in this shithole is a faggot.<br><br>GET IT?

No shilling or anything, I don't like neither Jacob or Daiz.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I was awhile since I visited sad panda thread <br>You just got here, you fucking newfag. Don't try to hide it.</br></br>  <br>   they did nothing wrong <br>it's just a bunch of autists complaining they have to torrent things now</br></br>  <br>He was talking about non affiliated scanlators being trash</br>  <br>Oh.</br>  <br>I think it's because it is not guaranted that everything will become available online.Ishikei's new chapter still hasn't been realeased.</br>  The amount of fakku shilling and ignorance going on right now is palpable.<br>Just pirate their fucking shit and stop talking about them here. Go to /h/ if you must. It's fakku central there.</br>  <br> tfw I just wanted to talk about the fucked up shit Meme50 does and people used that as the engine to for their shilling. <br><br>I never asked for this.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean this one?</br>  <br>There is nothing to talk about Fakku, though. The only thing left is talk shit about it.<br>And who the fuck goes to /h/? All threads are awful.<br/></br></br>  <br>No shit, they're awful. No need to make these threads awful too.</br>  <br>The reason these threads are allowed on /a/ is because we discuss ero manga and artists. Fakku is a part of that if you don't like it leave. Discussion for example about these skateboards they debuted at anime expo from bosshi, henreader, and toshio maeda</br>  <br>I can talk about meme50's sick shit if you want, anon.</br>  <br>Yes.Would you be kind enough to share?If not,that's fine.</br>  <br>But they're not awful, people in these threads are just babies</br>  <br>He can't because that's Jewcob bragging as usual.</br>  <br>I think we're being a little paranoid.Let's wait and see if he'll respond.</br>  <br>everyone posting in these threads is jacob<br><br>even I am jacob.</br></br></br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>Hi Jacob.</br>  <br> Fakku is a part of that if you don't like it leave. <br>The main reason is because Fakku has been irrelevant on /a/ these last years and we have grown accustomed discussing about sadpanda and the content; suddenly talking about a site which its admin hates sadpanda feels very forced, and on top of that a site that has had very little to offer and act as if they are the best resource makes us don't like discussing about it.<br>Why should we talk about Fakku? Why should we talk about those skates? Are the artists themselves selling them? Go back to the buyfrag thread if you want so much to advertise it.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>1) I don't want a DMCA notice like the previous anon. <br>2) people shittalked, even though I was willing to rip the upcoming subscription service from Fakku, simply because I supported some, not all or even most, of what fakku does</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pin-point games will never get a translation <br>It's so hard being a nukige fan. People just want "muh plot".</br></br>  <br>Oh you are THAT faggot from some threads ago? How is that dick in your mouth going on?</br>  <br>Probably not as good as the one in your ass.</br>  I see that Jewcob and Daiz's bans expired today. Such a shame, we were having such nice threads for a while too.  <br>That's fine.I understand.Hope you'll change your mind someday though.Also,thanks for responding.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128632807 <br>I don't agree with most. DMCA, DRM+lower resolution no download releases, directly or indirectly pretty much killing wani scanlations, etc.</br>  <br>There is no drm on their releases, now you're just making stuff up</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128632807 <br>Fuck off Jacob</br>  <br>By DRM I meant making it harder to rip the web releases, not necessarily full blown content encryption/decryption. It took some hoops to losslessly rip their gift chapters when they should have been available to download from the start. I fear the subscription releases will be harder to rip.</br>  mods pls ban fakku posters. I just wanna enjoy a panda thread without the bullshit  <br> directly or indirectly pretty much killing wani scanlations <br>Wani translations were killed by Wani, last April. Lusty Lady Project and 4dawgz both quit translating, and countless others (Life4Kaoru, Flatopia, doujin-moe among the ones I know for sure) completely swore off Wani due to their DMCAs. This was 100% before any Fakku nonsense started.</br></br>  <br>You are the reason we can't enjoy free porn.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128613842 <br> Picking on shit scans <br>You wanna compare the Hamao version?<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/835776/d7f732<wbr>8056/<br>https://www.fakku.net/manga/lets-do<wbr>-something-nice-english</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't think someone else would pick them up if it weren't for fakku's licensing deals? A lot of fan translations drop the project when the series they're working on gets licensed.</br>  <br> responding seriously to samefagging shills <br><br>Why would you do that?</br></br></br>  <br>Different chapters, also wehasband is cgrascal tier</br>  <br>The volume of translators hit by the first DMCA far outweighs the influx of new translators.</br>  <br>Now that fakku is simulpublishing there is no reason to scanlate wani, its the same reason almost no one fansubs cr shows</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>You could upload it to some site like https://luscious.net/ or http://pururin.com/ and then some other anon would post it.</br>  <br>But those sites are shit</br>  <br>Fakku hasn't simlpublished shit so far.<br>It's all either been delayed to oblivion or old as fuck and already 80% translated already.</br></br>  <br>Still,they are good enough for this specific purpose.</br>  <br>Being shit? Yeah they are the best at it, maybe in comparison to Fakku.</br>  <br>All of the magazine chapters they've released so far went up before scans of the magazines appeared. You're an idiot</br>  <br>The scans of the magazine are usually 1-2 months behind, retard.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128633703 <br> http://i.imgur.com/8nz4iWL.jpg <br>I'm not gay but damn that dick looks good</br></br>  <br>That's just not true. Even the Ishikei one they just released was released after the scans of X-EROS 32.<br>And you know, magazine scans are a month delayed. 33 is already out.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128633703 <br> FAKKU mater race <br>This is now a trend. How sad.</br></br>  <br><br>That's the point. Fakku is beating scans and the subscription hasn't even started yet</br></br>  <br> still using your signature catchphrases while samefagging <br><br>How stupid can one person be?<br><br><br>It's just Jewcob samefagging again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fakku is beating scans <br>I just told you, they aren't.</br></br>  <br>What about the rest of the magazine? What about BEAST, XTC, Shitsurakuen, etc.? I'm all for uncensored releases, but they are slow due to only having 1 translator on the magazines.</br>  <br>I just told you they are</br>  <br>You truly are cancer.This is you &lt;&lt;I am acting aggresive and being an asshole in general,because a person who started a site as a hobby became successful enough to start making serious money while also supporting the</br>  <br>Fakku has a good ammount of unique translators (aside from the known big names). It's just that some of them are insufferable faggots and weeaboos, I've seen them in cons and twitter.</br>  so... are there any torrent batches with fakku shit around? (fap nyaa is quiet)  <br>Just filter it. Granted, it kills more than half the thread, but at least it leaves you with on-topic posts.</br>  <br>Noone cares about your life, you are shit for hating the panda.</br>  One day these threads will just be people sharing the latest FAKKUâ¢ releases  <br>artists,which is something almost no one in this thread does,and i can not access my cartoon porn without paying.&gt;&gt;</br>  <br>But sadpanda is shit and its run by a my little pony fag. We all know its shit its just the best of all the shitty websites we use</br>  <br> so butthurt that you can't even finish your post before sending it <br><br>You still have the same temperament as the first time you got banned for samefagging, I see. Now fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It doesn't matter how many they have if they're currently averaging 2-3 chapters a week. Hopefully they'll get those FULLY translated magazines out soon to up those pathetic averages.</br></br>  <br>The combined magazines are 40+ chapters a month. I personally can't wait till it starts</br>  <br>I won't even respond anymore because it is obvious you can not respond to my points with any sign of intelligence and have to resort to being a baby.Have a nice day.</br>  <br> which is something almost no one in this thread does <br>Why the fuck do you always have to act like a saint or some shit? You can support the artist without relying on your awful site, shut up.<br><br> sadpanda is shit <br>No it's not. You are just jealous because it's way better than Fakku<br> muh mlp <br>Just shut up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Fakku master race they said   <br> which is something almost no one in this thread does <br>Holy fucking shit, quit projecting so hard.<br>It's possible to support an artist without making a gigantic show about it, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually do through amazon.jp.The question is,do you?</br>  I'll continue to pirate the shit out of anything Fakku does. I didn't start paying to watch shitty streams when Crunchyroll became legit, and I won't pay for hentai now that Fakku is legit. Shouldn't this be the end of the discussion? Don't pay for Fakku's stuff and just pirate it.  <br> Even if I have to deal with the whole Fakku fandom and their normalfaggotry. <br>It's awful knowing you share the same interests as these people.</br></br>  <br><br>No shit. Difference is CR devs didn't blatantly come in here and shill; key word is blatantly.</br></br>  <br>that image isn't even accurate. fakku master race confirmed.</br>  <br>If you think that's making a gigantic show,i apologize to you,but truly ,it,s not.</br>  Remember when these threads were about porn?<br><br> Me neither. </br></br>  <br> making your customers QC your content </br>  <br><br>The difference is cr was and still is shit. Fakku at least releases something worth paying for</br></br>  <br>Sometimes.<br>Also, it's easy for him to say "support the artists!" or "don't pirate!" because he now has a deal and has made enough money with a pirate site for years.</br></br>  <br>You would think that someone who has spent an entire year samefagging in these threads would be able to recognize when they're responding to a different person. Guess that's just the good ol' temperament kicking in.</br>  <br> They used a different font? <br> Just keep using Wild Words, but italicize and bold it. <br><br>A recurrent issue with their releases.<br>And fuck Daiz for saying he'd talk to the typesetters about it, they're still making the same mistakes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I won't even respond anymore <br>Finally.<br>Now go back to Fakku or /h/, maybe you can act so almighty and protector of hentai and have a following there.</br></br></br>  <br>I have been lurking for about 4 years.I starte posting about 2 months ago.Of course ,there is no reason for you to believe me , but it;s the truth.</br>  <br>It's a losing battle at this point, really.<br>Posting random links anyways.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/760365/3ef483<wbr>b5b2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/689398/5fe7b5<wbr>3fcf/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/685583/a0f8d1<wbr>9a7e/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/640837/78bebb<wbr>267e/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/399072/e0fc74<wbr>7f58/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You realize there are people here who have sadpanda accounts from before 2011, right? Fuck off newfag.</br>  <br>Ok.Bye.</br>  <br> I see that Jewcob and Daiz's bans expired today. Such a shame, we were having such nice threads for a while too. <br>Someone ban those fuckers right back.</br></br>  http://g.e-hentai.org/g/836545/d9a9<wbr>cc0f8c/</wbr>  <br>They were banned again?

It's like saying "Hey guys, check out the difference between this BDrip and the TV broadcast."

The only rational conclusion is that they were banned and their bans expired today.</br>  <br>And that's why I choose to support them!</br>  <br>I don't think they're pointless.

But please stop using "master race" as in implying that using Fakku is somehow better when it's clearly not.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Well, yeah, I was talking more just about the image quality and such.

It's not rocket science, they aren't even being subtle about it.</br>  <br> Hanafuda doesn't count because it's art and/or because I say so :^) </br>  <br>We can easy, people just need to ignore attentionwhores, trolls and samefags, which apparently is pretty hard for people.</br>  <br> People who were holding hath or GP can cash in now <br><br>HATH WENT UP IN PRICE?<br>AWWWWWWWWWWWW<br>YEAH</br></br></br></br></br>  Any non-rape exhibitionism where two people fuck with lots of people around and aware of it?  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/835933/d9695e<wbr>7a7d/</wbr></br>  <br>Hakase anon isn't around ;_;</br>  <br>Its around 8k creds now, it was 6k a month ago.<br><br> You currently have 283 Hath. <br>I was going to waste it in perks anyway.</br></br></br></br>  Did Daiz's and some anonymous shill posts just disappear?

But at least the best girl won.</br>  <br><br>Aaaaaaaaaaaand /thread.</br></br>  Aoyama didnt win.  <br>She didn't end up with MC; that's a win.</br>  It wasn't my first harem show.  Should have focused on autism girl BTFO everyone and their shitty art, would have been more entertaining than what we got instead  <br>pretty much this. Nanami was too much for that faggot</br>  Mashiro a shit. A SHIT.  <br>Pretty much everything.</br>  <br>I can tell you one thing that went right.</br>  <br>It's a shame Shiina didn't carried out Plan C. That would had been perfect.</br>  <br> worst girl winning <br><br>This series managed to be even worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Note: This actually happened.<br><br> Why did Sorata suddenly decide to bang Mashiro? </br></br></br>  <br>Short and to the point</br>  <br>Because he has shit taste.</br>  <br>What is love, anon.<br><br>Q. Do Sorata and Mashiro kiss?<br><br>A. Mate, they do more than kiss.<br><br> Sorata was no longer the ignorant boy he had once been. He felt the atmosphere keenly, and it told him what he wanted to know.<br><br>The timing was now.<br><br>Gingerly, he placed his hands on Mashiroâs shoulders. She trembled in reaction. And then, without any hesitation, he bent over slightly and kissed her. As their lips met again and again, they collapsed on the bed, where their fall was broken by the mountain of clothes swathed all over the sheets.<br><br>Resting on her back, Mashiro gazed up at Sorata with misty eyes. Their hearts were each thumping with the same frantic beat.<br><br>Mashiro was beautiful, Sorata thought, so irresistibly cute and loving. He wanted to hold her in his arms and possess her.<br><br>âMashiroâ¦â<br><br>ââ¦ Yes.â</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Q. Soâ¦ they do it?<br><br>A. It is strongly implied at the end of volume 9.<br><br>There is also a âmorning afterâ conversation which they have in the beginning of volume 10:<br><br> âItâs cold,â Mashiro mumbled drowsily in complaint.<br><br>âThatâs âcos you were sleeping without any clothes on.â<br><br>Intending to wake her up, Sorata pushed Mashiroâs forehead away from where it rested against his body.<br><br>âNrghâ¦â At last, Mashiro opened her eyes. She looked at Sorata, blinking in surprise. âItâs cold.â<br><br>Unfortunately, waking her up did not progress the conversation. Once again, Mashiro cuddled up against Sorataâs body.<br><br>âP-Put some pajamas on already! Why are you butt naked anywho?!â<br><br>âItâs your fault.â Her condemning eyes seemed to look right through him.<br><br>âOh really now. Letâs hear your reasoning.â<br><br>âYou took my clothes off.â<br><br>âUrk! Ahem!â he spluttered.<br><br>âDo you have a cold?â<br><br>âNo! Itâs because you said something weird!â<br><br>âIt was the truth.â</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> âW-Well, that may indeed be the case, but I clearly told you to put pajamas on before you slept, remember?!â<br><br>âI do.â<br><br>âLetâs go over this again, why are you naked?â<br><br>âI couldnât find my panties.â<br><br>âOh? Hm, isnât it somewhere around thereâ¦?â<br><br>âYou took my panties off.â<br><br>âOh, right! Iâm the last one who touched them!â<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br>Q. Has Sorata really turned into such a pervert?<br><br>A. Yes. Itâs disconcerting how his personality seems to have done a complete 180 last time I checked.<br><br> âDo you really want to have sex that much?â<br><br>âOf course!â<br><br>âIs that the only thing you want to do?â<br><br>âN-No way at all! I-Itâs because I love you that I want to do it with you! So donât say I only want to do that kind of thing. Definitely not!â he insisted vehemently. He was truly frantic, and his desperation seemed more awkward and unsightly by the second.<br><br>Mashiro was unimpressed.<br><br>âI-I love you, Mashiro!â<br><br>âYou love my body?â<br><br>âAll of it, I mean all of you! I love everything about you, Mashiro!â<br><br>âReally?â<br><br>âReally!â<br><br>Silence. It was clear she was waiting for something.<br><br>The silence continued.<br><br>Mashiro looked at him expectantly. He figured she wanted him to repeat himself.<br><br>âI love you with all my heart and soul.â Slowly â and clearly â he put his feelings into words.<br><br>ââ¦Okay.â<br><br>Blushing slightly, Mashiro smiled.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Best girl not only wins, but literally gets the D. More rom-coms out there should follow in Sakurasou's footsteps.</br></br>  <br><br> Wins the Mashiro and has sex with her <br> Still acts like a tremendous faggot after the fact. <br><br>This is the worst MC of all time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best girl <br>No. She's terrible. Misaki a best.</br></br>  <br>Wait,  isn't it a good thing he left because he realized he'd be a dick to her still? </br>   Her mind probably got blown away by her first experience of wild sex <br><br>My little savant can't be this cute.</br></br>  There wasn't enough polygamy.  <br> Implying Sorata didn't fumble around awkwardly and finish in 12 seconds while Mashiro lay there bored and unimpressed. </br>  <br>Not much, other than too much Aoyama screen time. /a/ just self-inserts into the MC too much and thus can't enjoy anything when the MC has serious personality flaws that negatively affect their waifus.</br>  <br>I think they actually improved Aoyama in the anime. Heard she was more bitchy in the LN proper.</br>  <br>The author knows shit about talent and hardworking, too.</br>  <br>Not everyone enjoys watching faggot being faggot, it has nothing do with self-insert. Besides, he had nothing to redeem that shitty part of him because he had a typical anime "nice guy" boring personality</br>  best girl not enough screentime   No one ever called Rita out on her selfishness <br>I hated her so fucking much.</br>  <br>I only remmber that her drama was just as bad as the others, something with her sister being the one the glasses liked</br>  <br>Stupid MC, genius anime girl that only makes stupid sounds when drawing and she wasn't actually good probably due to the writer's lack of skill, autistic girl that wasn't a even character, stupid senpai, stupid programmer, stupid dreams, stupid school, stupid useless painting rival of the autistic girl, stupid projects, stupid problems and pointless everything.</br>  That show helped stop being a faggot and start dropping the shows I don't enjoy even if I already watched half of it.  <br>Rita was another "fuck you Mashiro for being so talented". Ryuunosuke help her get over it and then she starts thirsting for him afterwards.</br>  I liked it.    <br>Her entire arc was about how she was projecting her jealousy onto Mashiro and masking her desire to force Mashiro to keep being a world class painter out of spite as concern for Mashiro's future.<br> You're better than me and make me feel like shit because I can't stop comparing myself to you, so you need to just shut the fuck up and paint forever </br></br>  <br>blonde won by being an autistic shit-for-brains</br>  I want to be on Mashiro duty if you know what I mean.  <br>Yeah, same point as I made in another thread. The two characters that didn't get what they want spent more time in their self involved drama rather than sticking to what they wanted. to acheive.<br><br><br>Admittedly the girl whom was a rival to Mashiiro I can understand somewhat as a friend of mine practically got carte blanche to do whatever she wanted for her art projects due to her talent, the tutors would just give her pounds of clay to take home and she didn't even have to come in.</br></br></br></br>   People like the autistic personality-less moeblob  <br><br>Why?<br><br>For what purpose?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why I dropped it after the first episode.</br>  Watching it was like watching a standard slice of life. Except every once in a while you get slapped in the face. It smarts a lot but the pain starts goes away after you keep watching. Then it slaps you in the face again. You start to winder the slaps to the face are actual development. But no. At least at the end you get ice cream, but your face still hurts after the repeated slaps and you start to wonder why you even watched the show.  Sorata's character seemed to reset back to square one at the beginning of the second half. He seemed to undergo very similar development again and had pretty much the same subplot as the first half, and it was incredibly frustrating to watch. And then the demolition arc just sucked.<br><br>The first half was great though. Hell I didn't mind Sorata much at all back then.</br></br>  What is she trying to say?  <br><br>"this is how plastic memories was greenlit"</br></br>  <br>GJ-bu or GJ club</br>    <br>I will say it again.<br><br>The imouto always wins.</br></br></br>  <br>Dam straight my nigga.</br>  what's the worst mecha ever made and why is it it aldnoah.zero?  <br>That's actually the joke. If you were to say something like "I'm so fucking mad that Bones screwed over ZnT", I would have said "But J.C Staff/Mappa did Zero no Tsukaima/Zankyou no Terror!â. Itâs not really that funny, but the point still stands.</br>  <br><br>From WONFES.</br></br>  <br>Star Driver</br>  <br>I absolutely love 0048 but have a very difficult time calling it a mecha show. It has mecha in it, sure, but it's a pretty minor aspect of the show.</br>  <br> Urobuchifag <br>If that were the case wouldn't he have mindlessly given Aldnoah a 10/10 just because Butcher worked on the first couple episodes?</br></br></blockquote>]
