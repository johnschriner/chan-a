[ How good is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien? <br><br>Appearently called Rumbling Hearts for the official English release.</br></br>  Bump.  do you like melodrama? it has  ntr.  also the ova has chizuru from mub rub.  <br>Do you like rage? Then Kimi Nozo is the anime for you.</br>  What kind of MC cucks his comatose girlfriend for her best friend?  <br>Pretty damn good.</br>  <br><br>it will make you angry<br><br>it's good</br></br></br></br>  <br>The kind of MC who would have gotten laid without the accident. He had been clearly mentally expectant of sexual intercourse and thus couldn't handle the lack of it.</br>  <br>Best girl won.</br>  <br>It's a good adaptation of the VN, but lacks in certain areas and removes some character interactions that still have a presence. Too bad the anime dropped all of Takayuki's soliloquies. This is pretty bad as they gave far more depth to his character. Now you really have to think yourself what he is going through, which most people just don't do. <br>It would be good to approach it with an open mind and trying to relate most characters.<br><br><br>The kind who tries to move on with his life rather than stagnate in one moment in time, especially afterwards he is kicked out from her life by her own parents. Then everything just goes to shit after he is just getting a bit better.  Haruka was aware of Hayase's feelings and basically fucked her best friend because she just wanted to have some dick. She also realised Takayuki had feeling for Hayase early on, but continued to spin him around her finger. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>An MC who is traumatized, guilt-stricken and not written to appeal to otaku fantasies.</br>  One of the few shows to give me a real feeling of anxiety while watching  It's like a Telemundo soap opera, I loved it.  Oh, watch the first two episodes back to back. That's a must now that you don't have to wait a week between them.  <br>He gets counter-cucked, so it's all good.<br>Also, Mitsuki a slut.</br></br>  <br>Legends say that waifu wars were impressive when this shit aired.</br>  <br>I've never seen worse kind of faggotry. All the secondaries who never even touched the VN couldn't wrap their heads around why things were happening and why characters acted like flawed human beings. We are talking about socially awkward faggots like  that throw catchphrases around like it was the hottest shit around, so we should never expect them to take real life into notion.</br>  <br>Is the VN good? I heard it suffered from bad pacing.</br>  Mitsuki was one of the first girls I religiously saved images of  <br><br>Rumbling Hearts is a good title considering how rage-inducing the series can be.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure being a slut for revenge is a shitty thing to do no matter what the circumstances</br>  <br>The VN is excellent, âge's masterpiece by all means. Pacing issues are always subjective. There are bits that may seem mundane and long, but we are talking about true slice of life story, not that K-On kind of silly shit. Even with the mundane you get glimpses into the characters, their motivations and what carries them. Father Suzumiya has a much larger role in it and really works great balance to inexperienced Takayuki. Sadly his most important role was moved to Fumio, the red haired nurse, despite she being a complete slut. A nice slut, but a slut nonetheless.<br>The pacing issue can be said to apply to all of âge's mainline works. This is how the writing style is usually applied with characters actually pondering and waging issues. Muv-Luv Alternative had few of those info dumps in form of classes, but we are in assumptions that the reader takes the role of the main character, so the reader has access to the main character's experiences and inner life.<br>Takayuki's inner life is one of the main reasons people really need to read the VN, as it show how fucked he is after the accident to the point of freezing due to PTSD at multiple points.<br>The VN of course has more time to elaborate on the strong points of each character as well as how they are weak, and I see a lot of people missing how weak Hayase's psyche really is, despite it being on the platter even in the TV-series.<br><br><br>It's also the series' official international title, used in Hong Kong DVD release that came before Western ones.<br><br><br>Fumio is a slut, Hayase's literal complete mental breakdown doesn't amount to that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My nigga</br></br>  <br>Hey there  Kiminozo Guy. </br>  <br>Thanks for the in-depth post. I have Latest Edition installed so I'll finally get started on it.</br>  <br>Didn't the anime adapt one of the less than optimal endings?</br>  <br><br>Niggas have good taste<br><br><br> Tee hee hee too much whisky <br><br><br>Just keep away from Homura's routes until you've gone through all others and are properly drunk.<br><br><br>It adapted less than optimal route for  Hayase . It is possible to stand firm and tell  Haruka as things are when it comes to it, preventing Hayase's mental breakdown.  It takes some liberties with certain events and goes even to the extent to change how they go.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Muv-Luv Thread?  <br>Reminder that Mitsuki is the worst.</br>  <br>The worst was really Shinji. It's pretty easy to have your way with a person with almost complete breakdown.<br>Or Haruka, depending if you want to see love stealing little faux-princess who acts like she is doing nothing wrong as a friend betraying act.</br></br>  I recall acquiring a sinking feeling in my gut as I watched it with the dull realisation that there was absolutely no positive way this could end for any of these people. All I could do to stay afloat was cling to the knowledge that as bad as things were for them, they had it a lot worse one universe over.  <br>It's really more Takayuki's fault than anything. If he wasn't trying to have his cake and eat it too, then maybe things would've ended better.</br>  This show is fucking horrible, like no joke people complain about forced drama in SOL series but this takes the cake, it relies entirely on the MC being a complete retard and the heroine being a complete sociopath. It attempts to be mature but winds up feeling like a 3rd rate porno plot.    <br>But he wasn't. He was guilt ridden to four different directions. He still had a standing PTSD due to the accident, the current situation with Haruka and whatever delusions he had with it, his guilt towards treating Hayase like shit and ignoring her pleads to notice her shattering mental health. Then you have Haruka's dad coming back and requesting him to help Haruka to get better, and then Akane just drops the fucking bomb about her own feelings, after which she just gets sick and Takayuki has to take care of her. Oh wait, that didn't happen in the series.<br>Everything around him just shatters, and he can't literally move on for three years. Then when he is finally making some progress, shit just goes wrong. Too much responsibility is stacked on him to the point he can't even handle his own emotions and acts on how things were, not how things are and that's why he can't be true to himself until, once again, it is forced on him. Only when shit hits the fan he manages to drop the responsibilities that are not his to deal with.<br><br>And nigger, I'll fight you about the end. After all, it all ends in  Haruka marrying some with Murakami as his last name and realizes her dream as a children's book author, Akane becomes the school swimming team captain, Homura doesn't peg sex-changed Takayuki all night, and Hayase and Takayuki live as a proper family and they all get together after some time to meet again as friends  on that hill.</br></br></br></br>  But White Album 2 does the whole flawed characters thing a lot better.    <br>And nothing of value was lost.</br>  <br>I just think it's funny how he was the one to get fucked for a change. I like to think it made life for Mitsuki and Haruka better.</br>  <br>Hayase never getting into swimming, Haruka having legs broken and both drafted into army to fight aliens that are constantly killing everybody you love and care for.<br>Dunno, their EXTRA life is pretty fucking comfy compared to that.<br> SFD has best route; no accidents and Hayase gets her man </br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't talking about extra thought. I'm strictly speaking of muv luv verse. They're better off not having to put up with Takayuki's shit on top of everything else there.</br>  <br>Didn't Hayase confide in Takeru that they were both pretty broken up about him and that they never really got over him even years later?</br>  <br>I think it was Munakata or Kazama who told him that.</br>  <br>Seeing Takayuki has no needless pressure put on him and no PTSD due to accident, he most likely is his jolly self with Shinji. Much like all other BETAverse versions, he would have his no-bullshit side and stronger constitution. He'd still like TSFs, he was pretty into Valgern-On. <br>We can't really say that they would have put up with his shit, when they are talking him in such a warm manner whenever he gets a passing mention. <br><br><br>Pretty much. BETAverse trio didn't manage to get that ever sorted out, and when Takayuki died everything was just there. They're friends, but both know they couldn't get him because of the other.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've got a rumbling ass, does that count?</br>  <br>My first anime NTR. Mitsuki sleeping with the guys best friend. WHAT.THE.FUCK.</br>  <br>I guess you missed the total nervous breakdown, alcohol, Shinji takinf advantage of her and how Takayuki was in hospital spending time with a girl from three years ago and basically telling her how she mattered jack shit.</br>  <br>If I had a wish, I'd wish that this could air today to see /a/ burn to the ground.<br><br>Jesus, imagine this airing in today's /a/. It'd be worse than Guilty Crown, Vaverape, Yahari, etc. This shitposting would make most other shows' threads look like proper discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>Watch what you are wishing for, anon.</br>  <br>Did you see the threads for the first two episodes of Death Parade? It would be like that, only ten times worse.</br>  Mitsuki route is canon  <br>Oh please yes.</br>  Bakayuki is such a faggot.  Well, thanks, guys.I was really buttmad when Takayuki choose Mitsuki.I'm just a filthy secondary after all.  Mitsuki best girl.<br><br> the VN will never be translated </br></br>    <br>Watch it, then watch the randumb akane side story, then read the muv-luv trilogy and then watch the akane sidestory again.</br>  <br>You mean Akane Maniax? It's really great how well it connects KGNE and Muv-Luv. It's even more amazing that Extra starts with Takeru and Sumika wondering where the hell Gouda went.</br>  <br>Really loved her in the novel.</br>  <br>Yes, Akane Maniax, it's great context for the whole experience.</br>  <br>And it's the only anime featuring the Muv-Luv main cast.</br>  Here's a really bad rip-off of this that I wrote for a short paper.<br><br>https://www.dropbox.com/s/5vvde31f4<wbr>e6y4a3/Kimo%20ga%20Nozomu%20AP%20En<wbr>glish.docx?dl=0</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>This is funny since I ripped off Narcissu for my English final in high school</br>  <br>Post where?</br>  <br><br>White album 2 took it and did it a million times better.</br></br>  <br>Mitsuki did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>You have that backwards.</br>  <br>Will we ever get Day Zero VN ?<br>Well after MLA, I reach the conclusion that every single harem/romcom protagonist will automatically become better by dropping them in BETAverse.</br></br>    <br> Well after MLA, I reach the conclusion that every single harem/romcom protagonist will automatically become better by dropping them in BETAverse. <br>Well, two things can happen which really come out benefitially to us:<br>1)they get better<br>2)get turned into Soldier class</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Seriously fuck Takayuki, if he just moved on. Everyone would have been happier. I mean he knew her for like a week, and he ends up ruining his life over her.</br></br></br>    <br> And nothing of value was lost. <br>But that's wrong faggot, he fucking got Yui's father killed with his stupidity.</br></br>  <br> why did this picture reminded me of muv luv unlimited? </br>  <br>Because they died in Alternative.</br>  <br>fuck you faggot</br>  <br>http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/620<wbr>20</wbr></br>    New anime, get fucking hyped!<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VeE<wbr>6xf5yFqw&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Love that song</br>  <br>You do realize that was posted as part of April Fools 2015, right?</br>  Haruka a shit  <br>what shinji did was a dick move but he wasn't taking advantage of her. she was planning on slutting it up with a bunch of random guys because she was mad at takayuki. in the end shinji saved her from a gangbang.</br>  Akane was the better sister,  Hayase is best   Damn, this KgNE thread reminds of that Onigiri (?)'s April Fool special filled with wrong subs and gay innuendo. Anyone have a copy of it?  That fucking ending when you make Hayase your sex slave. My dick. <br><br><br>I know, I was trying to ruse people.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope you followed all the symbolism that was going on. Nobody was doing anything right in that moment. Haruka was being fooled, her stealing the love of that was clearly about to bloom between Takayuki and Hayase and continuing to lie her about her core reasons and feelings, Takayuki was practically ignoring Hayase to the point of pic related, Shinji being an asshole and Hayase cracking down to itty bitty pieces. <br>Everybody is doing something wrong at that period in the story, and the heavy handed symbolism depicts this. <br>If you want to get to the core of it, Haruka should have encouraged Hayase to go forth with her feelings towards Takayuki rather than force her own wantings in there over Hayase. There's a reason Shinji says it always had to be Takayuki for Hayase and why he never could move forwards with his feelings.</br></br></br>  <br> planning on slutting it up with a bunch of random guys <br> saved [...] from a gangbang </br></br>  <br>I want to make Mitsuki my sex slave.<br><br>I'd love her more than Bakayuki, though that isn't saying much.</br></br></br>  I wish i could forget this show.      <br>MASTERPIECE.<br><br>It was the first anime in history that split the fanbase into 2 large raging groups coming at each other everyday.<br>There were even arguments coming from nipland, it was fucking glorious.<br><br>Present /a/'s shitpost storm is nothing compared to this shit back in the days.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Bakayuki just evacuate?</br>  <br>Wait a second, what is this? Some kind of sci fi sequel to Kiminozo? Haruka and Mitsuki have their school time hairstyles though?</br>  <br> much country <br> He acted as a decoy for the other squads to flee. <br> He saved Sagiri </br></br></br>  <br> tfw i will never be able to experience shitstorms of this magnitude <br><br>And i like Kimi ga Nozomu Eien. I'd love to see people react to it unspoiled.</br></br></br>  <br>No way, why would age do that<br><br><br>Probably like True Tears, but worse</br></br></br></br>  <br>The game is way better.<br>That is all.</br></br>   tfw they play a brief snippet of Rumbling Hearts in MuvLuv EX when Yuuko rams Sumika into the sky with her car   /a/ just had to remind me of this Rage Inducing Anime.<br><br>That fucking slut Mitsuki. Everything would have been fine but the Best Friend had to sleep with Hayase and then Punch the Current Boyfriend ? Jesus Christ that was the worst. In all honesty. Not only did he sleep with her but he made it sound like he was on the right and to make matters worse he punched the one he NTR'd. I mean Fucking Hell seeing that faggots face makes me wanna punch my screen to oblivion.</br></br>    <br>If you count drunken cheating and regretting it forever ntr. Still gave me my first ever encounter with ntr feels and still makes me seethe. Fact it was with Takayukis best friend made it the worst.</br>  <br>If it's any consolation Shinji was probably also killed by American G-bombing of Yokohama Hive.</br>  <br>Seriously though, did they make more sequel to Kiminozo or something? Takayuki is now dead?</br>  <br>No way, that's just silly. KGNE is a done story</br>  <br>Oh, and Haruka became Alien's food. I'm not even joking.</br>  <br><br>you must be shitting me, way to ruin a perfectly decent slice of life drama.</br></br>  <br>Bakayuki dying is the best closure for the both of them</br>  <br>Not really.  It's an alternative universe <br><br><br>But that didn't close anything and left everything open and things were never handled. They were just left floating in the air.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DEAD PEOPLE CAN'T MARRY</br>  <br>People don't die, they get to shipped to Altered Fable.</br>  <br>Might as well be dead with everything on a standstill on there</br>  <br>Oh, so it's just Kimi ga nozomu Xenoglossia?</br>  <br><br>Still how would he fare in combat though ?<br>From the brief trailer, it seems while he wasn't Takeru-tier, he was at least pretty decent.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like an eternity they wished for.<br><br><br>Seeing how it is said he was pretty good at Valgern-On, I'd say he was most likely better than Hayase.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Decent enough to hold a line without one of these or an A-10</br>  <br>More like Kiminozu:Blue Gender, actually.</br>  <br> It's like an eternity they wished for. <br>Oh you</br></br>  <br>Better than Hayase ? I always thought Alt!Hayase would be stronger than Takeru due to her experience. Than again, this is Alt!Takayuki here, Extra!Mikoto is better than Takeru in Valgern-on but that doesn't mean her alternative self is stronger than Takeu, right ?</br>   Kimi ga Nozomu Eien <br> means something like "The Eternity You Desire" <br> EOPs desire a translation <br> it's still not translated a decade and half after the game was released <br> EOPs might have to   keep desiring it for eternity <br><br>It's like pottery,<br>it rhymes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Takeru's main problem at Valgernon according to Mikoto EX is that he keeps falling into predictable patterns. <br><br>This is why you can win against Mikoto at Valgernon by picking the exact opposite of what Takeru aka STORM VANGUARD MOTHERFUCKER would do. Keep your distance instead of closing to melee, keep moving and wait for an opening instead of attacking immediately, strafe to evade instead of closing the distance or retreating. Don't be fooled by Takeru saying that Kaizer is an excellent CQC machine.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course experience amasses more skill, she wasn't killed in the line of duty after all. The series mentions games only in one passing point in the first episode, but the VN has few more spots where you can notice Takayuki's interest in games. Of course, later on the series you see him in the arcades racking up some points in a lightgun game. I'd say that comparatively speaking Takayuki was most likely a pretty damn good surface pilot to the point of being better than Hayase. Of course, in Alternative Hayase has racked more experience so there's that.<br>Sure, in Takeru's case he had the info from his home world, but I am making this argument based on Takayuki's basic interests that the two versions share at most basic level, just like the rest of the cast.</br></br>  <br><br>Before we follow this line of logic any further I'd like to point out that Meiya is an awful copilot when you have her as a partner in Extra so it's not like valgernon capabilities correspond directly to tsf pilot powerlevel.</br></br>  <br>Not directly, that's true enough. Takeru was a surface pilot god mostly due to Sumika forcing him to go through shitloads of stomach twisting roller coasters and him trying to beat Mikoto in Valgern-On. It's comparative only to a point.<br>However, we do see most of previous âge cast being pretty damn decent pilots, so I would assume Takayuki and Shinji followed the same suit.</br></br>  But who sucks dick better?<br><br>Mitsuki or Haruka?</br></br>  <br>Statistically sucked more dicks, a competitive streak, and better lung capacity</br>  <br>Anon, I like your style.</br>  <br>how deep is the ntr</br>  On the topic of pilot experience. When Takeru landed in Alternative universe on October 22 they hadn't even been in a simulator yet. But somehow by December 25th everyone in the squad was a radical ace who are like ten times better than normal army pilots with more combat experience. I'm sure XM3 helped a bit, but even so. Less than two months is barely enough time to get familiar with basic combat maneuvering, and it doesn't help that they switched to the Shiranui past the halfway point and had to familiarize themselves with a whole new machine with its own handling characteristics.  <br>Thank you anon. If only Takayuki is as appreciative as you</br>  <br>You don't even know half of it all, anon.</br>  Episode 01 preview<br>http://www.symphogear-gx.com/next/<br><br>燃え尽きそうな空に歌は響き、 明日を輝かす種火となる。<br>拳も命も鎧い支えるは、 胸に揺れる小さな奇跡。<br>だが、逆巻く炎に涙する瞳は、 そうと知ってなお対峙する。<br><br>EPISODE 01 奇跡の殺戮者<br><br>鎮魂の夜を急ぐ血塗られた魔縁と、 かけてもつれた抒情詩。<br>耳をすませば遠からず、 世界を壊す――歌がある。</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think there is a translation?</br>  <br> kirika and shirabe with tears <br><br> Y-you mean were free to go as long as maria is kill? </br></br></br>  My sides.  So is Carol watched too much Michael Jackson's MV and JoJo manga/anime so her doll act like that.  Who FIS here? They need to sing while wearing the straight jackets.  <br>I think the dolls just have their own personalities. Say Leuir even has a young sister, this might implies they were living like a big family.</br>  <br><br>I would marry Maria and adopt DMJII.</br></br>  Here's hoping for plenty of ass-shots in episode 1.<br><br>Hopefully the anon that tried to compile the ones in G while it was airing will come back or have someone else take over.</br></br>  <br>Considering it more seriously, Maria probably made a deal since we saw a shot of her talking to someone through a glass while she was in a straitjacket. Probably includes her having to be watched by Tsubasa and the girls going to the school where Chris and Hibiki are.</br>  It's good to be back.  <br>Why are they in straight jackets anyways? Was saving the world not enough? Why didn't anyone stand up for them?</br>  <br>"Taking responsibility" and all that bushido stuff.</br>  <br>I figured Maria would do that, but not DMJii too. Although I guess they would follow behind her. Wonder if they share a cell or not?</br>  <br>No, no, my guess is that they were forced to. Like, as shown in G specials, after 1st season Hibiki and others were supposed to hide, now FIS has to 'take responsibility' for their actions and stay in jail for a while.</br>  <br>This got posted in the last thread<br><br> 燃え尽きそうな空に歌は響き、 明日を輝かす種火となる。 <br>In the scorched sky a song resonates, it becomes the ember that illuminates tomorrow.<br> 拳も命も鎧い支えるは、 胸に揺れる小さな奇跡。 <br>The fist, the soul and the armors support, in (her or their) chest a small miracle stirs.<br> だが、逆巻く炎に涙する瞳は、 そうと知ってなお対峙する。  <br>"but amidst the roaring flames those tear filled eyes know the confrontation that is to come."<br><br>The title is something about "miracle slaughter" or "miracle killer".

Retarded otaku support seiyuus by buying their shitty music and chinese cartoon cds. This is contingent on the fact that these women portraying their waifus are as pure as the waifu since it's the closest they can get to them in "real life" They must maintain the image of purity at all costs. <br><br>In reality, Sakura has probably talked to many men, and sucked and fucked many dicks to get where she is today.</br></br></br>  I takes an expert koebuta to distinguish the pure seiyuus from the ones that just pretend to be lonely to pander to Otaku.

Inoue Kikuko, Tanaka Atsuko, Iwao Junko etc), he can go at a relaxed pace. <br>The problem is when it's someone who isn't that much into 2D and/or goes full "girl's talk" with other female that it becomes a problem. <br><br>Uesaka had been on Anigera (Sugita's radio) already and she is a big fan of Votoms, so Sugita has no problems with her (or to be more exact, he likes her).</br></br></br></br>  <br>She can't do anything to stop it anyway</br>  My Seifu  I'm still mad she's not Alice  Is this an Imagine thread?  <br><br>That is a weird way to spell best girl.</br></br>  <br>New main roles fucking where?</br>    <br>Change the actress name and write '' young girl" in place of "girl" and this chart can also apply to her</br>    <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mW-<wbr>JAiZcGbU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br><br>stop pushing Taneda Risa or /a/ will think she's overrated.</br></br></br>    Why are you fags such sad cases?  <br>She's actually underrated though.</br>  It's almost July now.  <br> &gt;Satomi Akesaka <br><br>I want to marry Meruru-chan</br></br></br>  <br>It's just an observation ok.</br>  Is Sugita still bald?  <br>Muv Luv killed her career.

He's the one doing it.</br>  The fuck did I just read?<br><br>I knew there was gonna be a reset beforehand, I understood what happened, but all the events that happened prior to it, even after it... Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Just fuck my universe up</br>  wot if jewjoe is a nig?  <br>Nothing.</br>  <br>Is that from the new chapter? He looks suave as fuck</br>  <br>Nah.</br>  <br>I wonder what the rhythm is to this song.</br>  <br>I imagined him singing the "I like large fries" like the beginning verse of that French lullaby I think its called "Frere Jacques"</br>  <br>Man, I bet this hit Araki hard.<br><br>I actually did some research on it. The timing of Sennas death happened around when Araki was making the "let's go hunting" chapters of Diamond is Unbreakable. These chapters really did suck, and it makes sense that they were created by a man in pain who just wants to fuck the world off and draw rats melting people into cubes, because his racing hero decided to run into a concrete wall.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that would be pretty good, just a shame it doesn't fit the whole thing. <br><br><br>Let's Go Hunting is great though.</br></br></br></br>  So how did Dio end up in the coffin when Erina was the one in it?  <br>He had a couple of spares in his head pockets, just in case.</br>  So some people require the Arrow to get a stand, while others are just born with them?  <br>From what I understand you can get a stand from: <br>1. People in your family getting a stand <br>2. The arrow if you have potential<br>3. Pure dedication to something can develop one (see Pearl Jam)<br>4.Being born with it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br>Erina was actually Dio all along</br>  Apart from names did Viz change anything? Censor any of the violence.  <br>Some of the volumes say the art was edited, but I haven't noticed anything* in the ones I have (SC 10-16, PB 1 and 2) but then again, I haven't cross referenced.<br><br>*Changing Oingo Boingo on the books to Mondatta Zenyatta falls under name changes to me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>All right, one more question. Why didn't anything happen to Gold Experience when it was stabbed with Black Sabbath's stand arrow?</br></br>  <br> picking up etro <br> she starts pretending to be kidnapped </br></br>  <br><br>I thought he could only phase through himself, and he punched a hole through Joseph's chest</br></br>  <br>Araki hadn't thought of Requiems being made that way yet.</br>  <br>I thought only Giorno got stabbed? Anyways I'll just assume he did there's a few explanations but they are mostly just to cover up the plot hole I think the common explanation is that to give yourself a requiem stand you have to stab yourself on purpose. Really though Araki done goofed</br>  <br>Well, Part 4 did have Bites the Dust after Killer Queen was pierced by an arrow.<br><br><br>Nah, Gold Experience's hand was stabbed. Also doesn't Polnareff discover Chariot Requiem when he accidentally stabs himself after dropping the arrow behind a shelf or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br> 3. Pure dedication to something can develop one (see Pearl Jam) <br>A better example would be Heaven's Door since the Pearl Jam one could be disputed if PHF is considered canon</br></br>  <br>Bites the Dust wasn't a requiem though. It just gave his existing stand a new ability, rather than change the stand and its ability as a whole.<br><br>Worth noting that the arrow stabs Kira for that, where Black Sabbath stabs Giorno's stand.</br></br></br>  <br>The arrow only pierced Kira though <br><br>PHF is not canon in my opinion. It could be but we can't take anything from it as fact unless Araki states otherwise</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, that's right. I was just confused by nothing happening at all from a stand user / stand being stabbed by an arrow after finishing Part 4, but I guess that kind of makes sense.</br></br>  <br>I'd imagine most people have an instinctive vague idea of how to use their stand.<br><br>You don't just accidentally figure out how King Crimson works.<br><br> inb4 jotaro <br>Never in a situation where he'd instinctively stop time (as dio was), and even then, I doubt he figured out how to stop time by doing all the math for it in his head (hell, I doubt he figured it out at all, he pretty much just got so mad it Worked)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jotaro and Joseph actually had their stands manifested fully. Holly just had this half-manifested mess of a stand that she couldn't handle - she hadn't stabilised it so she didn't keep it.</br>  <br>I LIKE LARGE FRIES AND I CANNOT LIE<br><br>YOUR FRIED CHICKEN I DENY</br></br></br>  <br>I always figured that Star Platinum learned how by watching The World</br>  <br>WHEN PUCCI WALKS IN <br>WITH KFC AND A GRIN ON HIS FACE</br></br>  Be real /a/, which anime made you cry?  <br>Hard workers without talent are always the most depressing characters.</br>  <br>5 centimeters per second.</br>  Humanity Has Declined.<br>It was so fucking sad at the end.<br>She was the blonde lolis only friend.<br>And they never saw each other again.</br></br></br>  <br>I was literally beside myself with tears and its almost time for the english dub version to play that episode.

I recall reading in other threads that he ran away. Did that actually happen?</br>  If Luffy's dick is rubber, can he auto-erotic asphyxiate himself with his own penis? It would be the ultimate sensual pleasure.  <br>Omg how about taking 10 seconds to skim through the last couple chapters</br>  <br><br>I believe that Pandaman has been stalking the straw hats from the beginning. What are the odds that he would travel the exact same path as them through Paradise and the New World and do it at the same pace as them?<br><br>Pandaman is going to follow them to Raftel and get to the One Piece first, he will be the final villain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But who is he specifically following hmmmm</br>  <br><br>cucked by sabo<br><br><br><br>a couple of things could happen next chapter<br><br>1. everyone leaves for green bit and lives there while he gets fucked by kaido<br><br>2. burgess steals his fruit in the aftermath leaving him dead or defenseless</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   all that build up <br> all that hype <br> Luffy beats him in like 6 punches total <br> Doffy does fuck all the entire fight <br><br>Jesus fucking Christ this entire arc was fucking dogshit, literally only thing worth a shit was Sabo and Bartolomeo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have never read One Piece in my life </br>  <br>No anon, there's no defence. This arc was literally a poor man's Alabasta, with a shittier villain and shittier fight. With shittier characters.  Rebecca was even more cancerous than Vivi. </br>  <br> omg </br>  <br>Let me guess, back to reddit?<br><br><br>Top kek</br></br></br></br>  <br> 6 punches total <br>Luffy only landed 6 punches in 20 minutes of G4? Kaido's gonna rape that ass.</br></br>  <br>Shieeet, meant this post </br>  <br>This arc is easily the best arc since sabody, the fights werent just the same 'my crew beats your crew' a bunch of random people fought the executives and won, usopp unlocked haki, Robin was shown to have amazing speed by babying hakuba, sabo and koala are just fine and working under dragon, doffy is a world noble and thinks his child hood was hell, laws flashback of Cora, Franky had the most manly battle in any manga series, Leo and the tontattas literally saved everyone's ass by stopping jora from reviving the defeated executives, fujitora is the smoker of the new world, king rikus flash back, rebecca-kyros flash back, gear 4, big mam, kaido, black beard.<br><br>But no you're either gonna cry about it being too much or not enough you narutotards are the worst.</br></br></br>  <br> fujitora is the smoker of the new world <br><br>Fuck, I can't believe I just noticed this now.<br> Smoker fought Ace to stalemate like Fuji vs Sabo <br> Smoker didn't do jack shit about Crocodile, still got the credit <br> Smoker never once trusted Shichibukai pirates, Fuji wants to disband the system <br> Smoker called the WG shit, Fujitora said they weren't God. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Vivi didn't have her entire country executed and be forced to fight/sexual favors Vivi would have literally killed her self if she went through half of what Rebecca did</br>  So how is Jinbe going to die before he joins the Strawhats?  Luffy has now defeated 3 Shichibukai, 4 if you count Buggy. He will soon have a former Shichibukai join his crew. Why doesn't the WG offer him the position of Shichibukai?  <br><br>Summary of this chapter:<br><br> people talking about how the fight is over <br><br>We're getting into Bleach levels of content-density</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why doesn't the WG offer him the position of Shichibukai <br>He was responsible for the destruction of Enis Lobby<br>Responsible for the worst and (discounting Shiki) only prison break Impel Down has ever suffered<br>Major player in the Whitebeard War<br>Slugged a Tenryubito in the face and got away scott-free<br>Son of Dragon, the most wanted man in the world<br><br>At this point too many people in the World Government want him dead. Either that or Garp would hear and laugh at them for even considering the idea.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shichibukai <br>Aren't they like the group that the goverment can use and thus normally don't pick the strongest but the ones with aspirations to submit to the goverment? Luffy would never be controlled.</br></br>  <br>One Bleach</br>  anyone else feel doflamingo should have won that fight/would've beat luffy if he wasn't so arrogant as to take that punch head on? he could have dodged it and then easily destroyed luffy  Soon.  <br>meh</br>  imo, Fujitora was easily one of the worst aspects of this arc  <br>They're picked for their reputation mostly but someone who has displayed open contempt for the government as often as Luffy has wouldn't be considered.<br><br>They receive benefits to aid their strength and influence when needed. Nobody in the government actually trusts them and indeed the only time the government ever said "Do what we want or you're not a Shichibukai anymore" was the Whitebeard War<br><br>They're really all about appearances which is why Buggy is a Shichibukai now</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's cool, it just seems like bullshit to have an admiral show up and then "PRESUMABLY" let the Strawhats off the hook when his explicit mission is to capture them, and they've already have a million close calls</br>  <br>I liked him initially but goddamn he basically did nothing as the citizens of an entire country were being slaughtered around him. <br><br>He easily stripped Law of his title and Doflaming's knowledge of Mariejois' treasure couldn't have been enough to prevent him from attacking Doffy when his life was in danger from the birdcage too.</br></br></br>  <br>He's too unpredictable.</br>  5$ sayas Doffy gets up madder than ever with the crazy eyes finally revealed BUT since the shonen protag already defeated him he goes down easy when the CP Aegis show up to chain him up now that he's weakened.<br><br>Then Fuji tells them to haul him away and later on as he's getting transported to Impel Down he gets "rescued" by Kaido and last we see him a giant shadow is looming over him and Doffy is scared.<br><br>Then we don't see him until much later.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he could have dodged it <br>He was barely keeping himself up and just because the attack was large, doesn't mean it wasn't fast. That and the range was enormous.<br><br>If that isn't enough to convince you, then I don't see why Lucci couldnt have dodged jet gatling and Crocodile not turn into sand and avoid storm.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The seventh shichibukai is responsible for Zephyr losing his family and arm.</br></br>  <br>Aokiji, Garp and Smoker (3 times) have all let Luffy off the hook when they could have captured him. I don't see why Fuji should be treated differently. We already have at least one batshit crazy admiral and a batshit crazy fleet admiral. We need the 'good guy marine' somewhere.</br>  <br>The point of the Shichibukai is to balance the three powers, not fuck with it.</br>  Do you think there's a chance that Toei will get their shit together and give proper animation to the Law flashback and G4?  <br><br>There's obviously a difference between "good" marines and "bad" marines and in the end the good marines will end up as the good guy police of the world while the bad ones will be defeated as arc villains.</br></br>  <br>Minimum logic goes into fights, Oda mostly draws stuff that looks cool.</br>  <br>The WG and Marines are pretty separate in that sense. Something like Zephyr can be sweeped under the rug, but enlisting the pirate that is known to have fucked up Marineford, Enies Lobby and Impel Down would not be as easily explained away. <br><br>Sure, Marines might not be happy about him, but to the public, Luffy would appear far worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes to both. Hoping they stretch out Law's flashback a bit to rake in that filler time. Extra scenes with the past Donquixote Family would be cool.</br>  <br><br>I think the main issue is that they don't have anything Luffy wants and Luffy has no reason to use that position to his advantage since he's all about reaching the goal, not lingering around establishing criminal empires or consolidating his power.<br><br>For the WG it would be a matter of public prestige to declare him a shichibukai since it would mean to the world that they reigned him in and he's now a known quantity and so on...</br></br></br></br>  All I'm hoping for is that Kaido has a penguin zoan.  tbh I expected much more out of the boss fight in this arc.<br><br>After the initial couple of attacks Doflamingo couldn't to jack shit to Luffy and for Luffy it was all a matter of landing that big G4 hit and that's it.<br><br>Really underwhelming considering how interesting Doffy's fruit power is and how diverse his moveset is.<br><br>I was expecting something more choreographed with them exchanging blows more.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think the last time Luffy got seriously injured was when Magellan kicked his ass.  <br>Can't luffy change the punch's direction in gear 4th? You know, that snake thing.</br>  <br> meh <br><br>Reminder that Kaido is the only and best foseeable chance of bringing One Piece back to Enies Lobby levels of balanced hand-to-hand fighting again.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He was fucked up pretty bad in Marineford and almost got killed if Jinbei and Law didn't save his ass. Not to mention that Akainu would've ended him if Ace didn't jump in.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm fully expecting the Gorosei to go Lao G crazy mode at the very end and offer up a good physical battle.</br></br>  <br>Luffy didn't do anything until G4, even Red Hawk was called superficial. And then the power up completely reversed the situation.<br><br>It was pretty annoying. I don't like one-sided shit fests.<br><br><br>Hody bit him so hard Luffy was losing too much blood and needed a blood transfusion from Jinbei.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Magellan took ten years from Luffy's life and was the main reason Luffy didn't reach ace at ID</br>  <br><br>Taking ten years from a shonen protagonist's life means precisely nothing.</br></br>  <br>Luffy would have been further away from Akainu if Ace hadn't gotten buttmad from Akainu's childish taunting</br>  Honestly I can't want to see Drake X stomp shit in his full on dino mode.<br><br>Just imagine his awakened zoan mode too. <br><br>I like that Oda did that small introduction for him in Law/Cora's flashback.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It will when Luffy dies at the end</br>  <br><br>Yeah at the end of One Piece Luffy's going to go on a trip similar to Roger's final voyage where he visits all the places and people he's met on his journey before dying</br></br>  I enjoyed this arc, especially the tournament, but the Doffy V. Luffy fight was a massive letdown.<br><br>Doffy pumping out new attacks every 3 panels was just completely unnecessary.</br></br>  Time to rub it in to Doffyfags<br><br><br>DOFFYFAGS <br><br><br>B L O W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>L O W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>O W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>N T HE F U C K O U T<br><br>T H E F U C K O U T<br>H E F U C K O U T<br>E F U C K O U T<br><br>F U C K O U T<br>U C K O U T<br>C K O U T<br>K O U T<br><br>O U T<br>U T<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump for doffyfags eternally and impossible to recover BTFO  <br>speedreader please</br>  <br> &gt;Doffy does fuck all the entire fight <br><br>But that's completely wrong, they had at least 3 or 4 skirmishes with each other throughout the arc</br></br></br>  <br>Do you just skip whole chapters at a time when you read?</br>  <br>You mean like this?</br>  <br><br>and this?</br></br>  Anyone else get the feeling that something REALLY big is about to happen in the next 2-3 chapters?  <br>u mean my dick in ur mums ass?</br>  <br>enel comes back or kaido reveal</br>  <br> 7 hits <br><br>Doflamingo confirmed shittier villain than Hody.</br></br></br>  <br>Well no shit it's the post arc period.</br>  what happened to burgess?  <br><br><br>Exactly. I wish it continued like that.<br>Instead Doflamingo was brushing off everything like he's invincible until Gear 4th happened and that's that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br>I'm expecting at least one good Gear Fourth episode.</br>  <br>Major Fight rankings:<br><br>Lucci &gt; Oars &gt; Crocodile &gt; Doflamingo=Arlong &gt; Enel &gt; Shit &gt; Hody</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking buggy was better than hody</br>  <br>Crocodile &gt; Oars &gt; Foxy &gt; Lucci &gt; Doflamingo &gt; Krieg &gt; Arlong &gt; Enel &gt; Hody &gt; Wapol</br>  Where the fuck are Sanji and Brook?  <br>either safe in zou with the rest of law's crew or they got rekt by big mom</br>  <br>That's a ridiculous claim since Vivi is much stronger as a person than Rebecca can ever be and Rebecca had the strongest person in the entire country protecting her while she grew up and teaching her how to protect herself. That's why she's such a baby, if Rebecca didn't have Kyros she would be dead. He did all the work and she still turned out weak.</br>  <br>You really don't have friends, do you?</br>  <br>And Kuro was even worse than Hody. He had the shittest plan known to mankind and all he did was sway back and forth. We just see Luffy and other fodder getting slashed and then bam Luffy punches him down and that's it. I don't know why people like him so much now. He was worst villain.</br>  <br>Can you actually be this dumb? Being a Schichibukai means all your past crimes are erased. Luffy has literally declared war on the World Government, destroyed all their major institutions and defied the Nobles. Besides the fact he wouldn't accept, they wouldn't be able to get away with absolving him of those crimes anyway.<br><br>At this point he's just lucky they haven't decided to go killing all the people who helped him along the way like they did with Roger.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what? I thought his mission was to keep an eye on Doflamingo. That's what Kuzan told Smoker to report to Headquarters. At the time he arrived, they didn't realize Doflamingo hadn't actually resigned from the Shichibukai.</br>  <br> what's your power? <br>Oh I'm made of rubber and do rubber stuff<br> what's your power? <br>Oh I can make an area in which I control reality<br> what's your power? <br>Oh I'm a really big guy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can anyone post the gif of Donquixote family big shake please, I need it  <br>for you</br>  <br>He has to be a D, that nigga never stops smiling even when Kizaru's about to finish him.</br>  <br>Okay post OP characters and what board they would go one<br><br><br>Is /fit/</br></br></br></br>  <br>He can easily destroy luffy but he can't handle the Dong.</br>  <br>Kaido - throw him in the dungeon</br>  <br>Akainu let luffy off the hook too since he's luffys mom</br>  <br>I don't know who the other guy is but Brook is defending the sunny</br>  <br><br><br>Time to share it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2021  <br> Not knowing crocomom <br><br>Fucking summer man</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you will never have those gains of his caliber </br>  <br> Do you just skip whole chapters at a time when you read? <br><br>AFTER the commencement of his fight with Sabo, you damn sticking ape.<br> <br>Some people said he ran away in a tiny almost off-panel area.

Me, too.</br>  <br>I want Brook to see and meet Apoo. The guys who captured him are from his tribe of four elbows, right?</br>  <br>Yeah<br><br>He might be an outcast though because I don't remember a single one of his crew being a long arm like him</br></br></br>  So was Arlong killed by Luffy? He has gone 16 years without being shown again in the story, and there have been numerous subtle hints that he may have been killed; either that or whatever happened to him post-Arlong Park was unknown so his death was perhaps presumed.  <br>Did you read the arc with Duval ? Hachi said he was in jail with his crew mates.</br>  <br><br>Back to 7chan, faggot.</br></br>  <br>Not since it was released, so I guess I forgot that. Are they just in some regular jail in East Blue then? Since they weren't in Impel Down.</br>  <br>Villains don't die in One Piece anon</br>  <br>Whoever is in charge of selecting the Shichibukai needs to be fucking fired anyway<br> Crocodile planned to find an ancent weapon and was defeated like a bitch <br> Moriah wanted to become King of Pirates eventually and was defeated like a bitch <br> Doflamingo was an underground mafia boss and was defeated like a bitch <br> Trafalgar Law betrayed the government at the first occasion and was defeated like a bitch <br> Jinbei betrayed the government <br> Hancock betrayed the government (in secret) <br> Blackbeard betrayed the government 2 dys after he became a Shichi and he is now one of the most dangerous threats <br> Kuma helped the mugi in various occasions and had to be turned into a robot to get some authority over him <br> Mihawk does whatever the fuck he wants <br> Buggy <br>"balance of the world" my ass</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 16 years <br>you mean like 3 years right?</br></br>  <br>I like to think he knew that the Straw hats would defeat Doflamingo. He wants to get rid of the Shichibukai, and most likely does not want what happened with Albasta. This time all of Dressrosa knows that the Straw hats defeated Doflamingo, so they might be regarded as heroes. Because of this the Marines might get rid of the whole system in general.</br>  <br><br> Buggy </br></br>  <br>16 in our time. Usually Oda shows the previous villains in a coverstory or a whereabouts cover page for them, but Arlong got nothing. I guess it's unneeded though as  said.</br>  <br>That's why Fujitora is on the ball.</br>  <br>I wonder how he's going to try to achieve his goal.<br><br>He basically just sat back while Doffy did his shit.</br></br></br>  <br>but muh three great powers</br>  <br>That's his plan. Let Doffy fuck everything up and use it as proof that it's a stupid idea giving somebody like him power.</br>  <br> He easily stripped Law of his title and Doflaming's knowledge of Mariejois' treasure couldn't have been enough to prevent him from attacking Doffy when his life was in danger from the birdcage too. <br>He placed his bet on Luffy and everyone else. If they failed that then I suppose it wouldn't leave him in the best situation, but they didn't fail and he therefore didn't have to do anything.<br><br>He's an admiral. He doesn't always have to directly follow a mission and it doesn't really matter if he succeeds or not (technically Kizaru failed his at Saboady too). His own personal resolution was to protect the civilians of Dressrosa, and his secret goal is to allow Luffy to defeat Doflamingo to use as supporting evidence to back the abolition of the Shichibukai system.<br><br>I'd say so. Kuzan told Smoker to report that an admiral/admirals should be mobilised and present at Dressrosa for what was going to go down. Fujitora was sent based on this insight.<br><br>He's pretty much just achieved it. All he has to do now is present his argument (backed by all his evidence) to the higher powers of the WG once Reverie comes around and its mission accomplished.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So did Fujitora inherit Aokiji's Lazy Justice?</br>  <br>No but I'm sure his past is very interesting, it's likely he's also from Wano so we could get a backstory for him there.</br>  <br>Fujitora was still actively following his own sense of justice. He is "Blind Justice" which is why he told Doflamingo earlier on that he'd ignore the things he was doing and just protect the people from Luffy and the others. He was protecting civilians the whole arc until the end. His justice not leading to him defeating/killing everyone who opposes him doesn't mean its lazy, its just not his domain.</br>  <br>I'm surprised Akainu, being the Fleet Admiral, is even allowing the Warlord system to continue existing</br>  post some legends  <br>obligatory</br>  <br>But he got jobbed in a lot of crowd scenes too. He can't be that strong.</br>  <br>Issho is giving the helping hand to Saka-san; they probably both want it but Sakazuki might have too much on his hands. You have to remember that the Marines do not have control/power over the Shichibukai, only the WG do. Fujitora being the one to work on its abolition probably saves Sakazuki the effort.</br>  <br>Ok.</br>  <br> Garp would hear and laugh at them for even considering the idea. <br>Nobody wants Garp to laugh at them.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind an additional, completely unrelated filler arc before or after the Law flashbacks. It's the perfect point to take a break in the series, and those niggers need it badly.</br>  I don't know if this was discussed already, but Luffy just kind of beat the shit out of a celestial dragon<br>again<br>Considering everything he has done since Water 7, why haven't they just brought down the full force the government on his ass yet?</br></br>  <br>I wonder if Garp and Sengoku are OTP</br>    <br>Sengoku is a dick but secretly doesnt want to hurt Luffy because he's Garp's grandson<br><br>He deliberately only sends weak marines in the SHs general direction. THe government trusts that Sengoku is doing all he can</br></br></br>   Bellamy blubbering like a bitch in that episode <br><br>I wasn't prepared for that to hurt as much as it did</br></br>  anyone have that pic of the donquixote family with the snapchat text bar on it calling buffalo ugly af lol  <br>They don't consider Doffy a dragon anymore. He even offered them his father's head and they still told him to fuck off</br>  <br>Doffy is just a about a piece of shit even among the CDs. So even if he was still one of them, which is isn't anymore, he'd be the one that they'd want to avenge the least.<br>The only thing that can get the WG to add this atoricity to Luffy's list of shenanigans is Doffy's warlord title. He's nothing more to them than a filthy pirate. <br>And maybe even that won't affect them now that more and more high level marines are against the Warlord system.</br></br></br>  <br> They don't consider Doffy a dragon anymore. He even offered them his father's head and they still told him to fuck off <br>True, but what's to stop him from giving the world one final middle finger and blabbing about the supposed "secret" he has now that his ambitions have been crushed? He still has the leverage that allowed him to retain CD privileges</br></br>  <br>They'll probably let the Yonko attack Luffy first.</br>  <br>Luffy indirectly did a huge favor to celestial dragons, Doffy used to blackmail them and the WG all the time,because of that "national treasure that will shake the world"</br>  <br>Alternatively, he just fucked the WG over immensely because now Doffy will have nothing left to lose by blabbing.</br>  <br> what's to stop him from giving the world one final middle finger and blabbing about the supposed "secret" <br><br><br> now Doffy will have nothing left to lose by blabbing. <br><br>Well that's assuming someone doesnt swoop in and kill Doffy now that he's too weak to defend himself. Now's a good time for the MiB to arrive in Dressrosa to cart Doffy away for some advanced waterboarding lessons</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Post funny Luffy harassing Law stuff!  <br> Well that's assuming someone doesnt swoop in and kill Doffy now that he's too weak to defend himself. <br>You're talking like there's some guy hanging around who's already shown he wants to murder fruit users for their powers</br></br>  <br>Either fujitora bring him back to Mariejois or he will escape.</br>  <br>Does this count as funny, though???</br>  <br>Doffy is too much of a important character to die.</br>  <br> implying Burgess is important enough to get the kill on Doffy </br>  <br>Threadly remider.</br>    <br>Burgess has run away like a bitch thanks to sabo.</br>  <br>What's with Law's skin?</br>    <br>I have no idea why they color him like that.</br>  <br><br><br>Why is why the only scenarios for Doffy not to blob is to be captured by Fujitora or CP0. If Burgess took him in under Blackbeard it could also be a tool that Blackbeard could use.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet Tumblr made him black but gave him vitiligo so he'd match his hat</br>  <br>The right hand man of the final and best villain isn't important enough to you?</br>  <br>"What-if" Law kept the skin patches from when he was dying</br>  <br>Except he's way too fucking brown and they're in the wrong places<br><br>My vote is black with vitiligo, it's a newer tumblr thing to do</br></br></br>    <br> You're talking like there's some guy hanging around who's already shown he wants to murder fruit users for their powers <br>But he just had his WEEEEEEEEEHing ass handed to him by Sabo<br>but there is CP0, all it would take is one den den mushi call and they'd probably happily 86 Doffy</br></br></br>  <br>One Piece is a story about everything going crazy, not about everything not going crazy.

I disagree with  →<br><br>Yui doesn't want them to go back to the awkward status quo. She legitimately declared her intention to take 8man for herself.

That way you can avoid getting hurt.</br>  Could we agree that S1 was way better in all aspects?  <br>This is probably the first fiction that I read where the main heroine keep getting worse and worse.<br>To think that she was the best girl in S1. Can you even redeem her anymore?</br></br>  What the fuck is even going on? I guess some shit would probably make more sense had I re-watched the first season before the second season began but why are these high school students perpetually talking in riddles?  <br>Except visuals, yes.</br>  <br>Don't listen to that fag, he's obviously wrong.

Like holy shit Watari what did you do to her</br></br></br>  <br> 8man telling her to solve her problem herself <br><br> implying that's not 8man genuinely caring for yukino <br><br>he won't let her give up. that's what happened. yui tried to pull off a gambit, trying to pressure yukino into conceeding because she's being pressured by haruno as well. but 8man wants her to live up to the strong girl he knows she can be.<br><br>capcha related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you, but both proposed scenarios state that Yui intended for 8man to shoot her down. Why would she want him to do so? Can anyone elaborate?</br>  <br>Nah, it was 5/10. This season was at least 7/10.<br><br>No other anime had me on the edge of my seat for literally nothing happening for 13 episodes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, she did WHAT?<br>And 8man, get your eyes off of her for a second, jesus.<br><br>Are these for real?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>get off of 4chan s1 hikki</br>  <br>8man starts confronting her on her bitch ways. She's never gonna get with Hayama anyways.<br>Might as well have an onaie master type end for that route.<br><br>Than again she isn't even a yankee.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You were just excited to shitpost about new developments.</br>  <br>She is hinting that she wishes Yukino and Yui were fighting back like Yumiko.

All of you retards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even browsing /a/ except for season beginnings and finals.</br>  Yukinoshita Yukino.<br><br>Is this the most well written character of all time?</br></br>  <br> Now I'm stuck with those weeabo losers on /a/ with all their shitty theories. <br><br> implying you wouldn't miss our company <br><br>tsundere is so 2007, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sha~</br>  <br> She legitimately declared her intention to take 8man for herself. <br><br>You are wrong, Yui's whole plan from the beginning was to have 8man step up and reject her obviously bad plan.<br><br>She did an old 8man ploy that she knew the new Genuine 8man would decline.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you're confusing Yui with Shizuka.<br>Yui hasn't done much besides dragging him around on shitty dates.<br>Yukino still has very little development.<br>No one has really opened up yet, that's why there's a problem in the first place.<br><br><br>Mutual disarmament, unless Yui actually expected 8man's refusal and not just going "haha i was only pretending to be retarded"<br>Then it'd be Yui trying to force 8man's and Yukino's hand to confess, so that she could also confess.<br>The service club would break up or lose one member at that point, thus it'd be their last and final request.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does she make the sound sha?</br>  <br><br>The whole plan was purposely meant to be turned down, Yui has no real intentions to "block" Yukino from pursuing 8man.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Nah I've read the LN.<br><br>It's definitely </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because Yui either pities or respects Yukino. She wasn't actually going for the kill, she just wanted to make a real threat to get them out of the love triangle quagmire. Yui wants a fair fight. Think about it. She backs off to let Yukino give Hiki the cookies, but Yukino spergs out. Then Yui blows her date promise to bring Yukino along to deliberately sabotage her own confession. When Yukino is about to back off, asking if she's a third wheel, who brings her back in?</br>  <br>That makes no sense. If she intended for 8man to reject her plan then they return to the non-genuine awkward shithole they've been wallowing in.</br>  <br>Basically because her proposal was her "one answer" and she knew it was wrong because it demanded they ignore their feelings. But in additon to that, she knows 8man. She knows he'd never accept it and she trusted that somehow, he'd have the words that would set them on the right path again.</br>  <br>When I watched S1 for the first time, I was struck by how incredibly bizarre it was.<br>I was expecting an actual romcom under the guise of of not being a romcom, and I got bizarro.<br><br>I expected the same out of S2, and I got based Hayato and actual romance.<br><br>I think I liked S1 way better because the ending wasn't begging for money.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna quit being an abnormalfag now after witnessing how many people self-insert into hachiman. If it means to be autistic and retarded I won't do it.</br>  <br>It's easier to understand if you read the novels but I'm also wondering when the conscious decision to write so cryptically happened.</br>   wanted Yukino be win <br> watched her character degenerate into a cracked mirror and a doormat <br><br> wanted Hachiman to win <br> watched him become a complete GENUINE retard who has no idea what he is talking about <br><br> wanted Yui to be happy <br> completely impossible now with the shithole they've all dug themselves into <br><br>I'm done, I can't do this anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nah I've read the LN. <br>You say that like it means anything.</br></br>  <br><br><br>You fucking cocksucking horny teens.<br>WATARIIIIII, what are you doing??</br></br></br></br>  I liked S2 of Ore no imouto and S2 of this better.  What did he say?  <br>sha~</br>  I was just like what the fuck am I even reading the whole episode.  <br>You are right. I also read the light novel.</br>  <br>IROHA OR DEATH</br>  <br>If they mutually disarm, they get nowhere. They still remain in the awkward love triangle.</br>  <br>Truly the highlight of this final episode.</br>  Why the fuck would anyone read the LN? Might as well read trash like 50 shades of grey.  GUYS<br><br>8man is a "nice guy".<br><br>Do you think he'll finally realize he's been stringing along Yui too long?</br></br></br></br>  <br>is than sena</br>  I wanted Yui to win but she's just such a bitch now. She's become the villain somehow. What the fuck. Oh my god THE STONE TABLETS SPOKE THE TRUTH, IT'S ALL REAL<br><br>FUUUUUUUUUUUCK</br></br>  <br>I like this explanation. Are you the one who posted<br> <br> <br><br>?</br></br></br></br></br>   Yukino turns from a strong and independent character into a doormat with dependency issues out of nowhere and drags everyone into her black hole of self-hatred and suffering <br><br> 8man goes from a jaded teenager into some retard afraid to do anything because he's searching for genuine, which even he doesn't know what it is <br><br> Yui goes from a dumb bimbo into someone who is cleverly trying to push the group to a point where they can talk about the elephant in the room (yukino) and is able to understand 8man better than Yukino ever could <br><br>What's wrong with watari? Everything is making no sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nyaa~ Sha~ <br> so KAWAII DESU <br><br>literally useless moeblob</br></br></br></br>  <br>The proposal was a mutual disarmament one, but Yui wanted Hachiman to shoot it down. That was her goal,</br>  <br><br> Iroha literally blows 8man in a supply closet in Vol11 <br> FEEL cuts it <br><br>FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Author approved it, don't bother him about it.</br>  <br> If they mutually disarm, they get nowhere. They still remain in the awkward love triangle. <br><br>Listen<br><br>That's the proposal Yui made that she KNEW was going to be turned down for the exact reason you just stated.<br><br>Understand?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>MY DICK</br></br></br>  <br>Mutually disarm is good because the cat is out of the bag and now they can slowly work towards something. Otherwise yukinoshit and 8man would continue to ignore the problem until it escalates and one of them breaks. Yui is smart enough to not let it get to that point.</br>  <br><br>Why was this spoiler so late?<br>Is it legit? Why isn't anyone talking about it earlier?</br></br></br>  Why does everyone want Hachiman now? I thought he was some creepy depressing fuck  <br><br><br><br>You guys can stop pretending now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off false flagger.</br>  <br><br>Yui and Yukino needs to switch now.</br></br>  What causes yukinons autism? Was she dropped on her head as a child  I think my main problem with this show is the damn monologues apply to too many aspects and issues within the characters at once so you have to play the guessing game which is being problem is being referred to. <br><br>Also, fuck that ending, 2 years for fucking buy the very last LN is some serious bullshit.</br></br>  <br>Yes, I get that but that's the equivalent of saying Yui is okay with things staying the way they are (a fake status quo much like Hayama's group)</br>  <br>And? I could dump the whole saika 8man interraction then the thread would hit the bump limit. Does that mean saika will win the 8inch? No he won't. <br><br>Now go fuck yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Being born after Haruno.</br>  <br> &gt;Yui goes from a dumb bimbo into someone who is cleverly trying to push the group to a point where they can talk about the elephant in the room (yukino) and is able to understand 8man better than Yukino ever could <br><br>This was developed all throughout season 2.<br><br>Ebina fake confession scene<br><br>episode 4 end scene<br><br>episode 5 scene with Yui grooming 8man's hair.<br><br>She understands him better than anyone else, save for Sensei perhaps.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretending? Nigga she just handed him some cookies while he just went full dere dere for her again.<br><br>I'm pissed, you can fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br> No he won't. <br>Hachiman just lead him on again and again.</br></br>  <br>Vaccinations.</br>  <br>Yui's always wanted the 8man from the start.<br><br>Yukino has like no other human contact and learned how reliable and nice he can be.<br><br>Iroha is there because there needs to be jealousy as a catalyst.<br><br>Orimoto is a typical female animal who sees that the male she rejected is now desired by many other superior female specimens, and her primitive brain is telling her that what is desired by those superior females is now desirable to her as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui goes from a dumb bimbo <br>No, her dumb is never potrayed as something negative for her so far, she is just being Yui even in this episode, she doesn't really change.</br></br>  <br>Yukino is depressing fuck too</br>  <br><br>You don't understand, for 8man to turn that plan down, which would be a forced status quo, he needs to outright say he doesn't want it.<br><br>Yui's plan succeeded. Everyone can now move forward.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why did Yui wait a year to Yahallo 8man?<br>Why did Yukino stop acting like a cunt to 8man when Haruno shows up?<br>Why do they keep following around 8man when he's doing grunt work for Iroha?<br><br>Men become more valuable to women when other women are after him.<br>Slap a ring on him and who wouldn't be able to beat them off with a stick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has Iroha seen Hachiman at his worse like everyone else already?  <br> Orimoto is a typical female animal who sees that the male she rejected is now desired by many other superior female specimens, and her primitive brain is telling her that what is desired by those superior females is now desirable to her as well. <br>Fucking kek. You have my laugh for the night.</br></br>  <br>Sensei has offered 8man guidance, but has done nothing to get him out of his shell.<br><br>Yui constantly pulled 8man and Yukino out of their comfort zones. Her silly conversations and occasional skinship were the spark of real companionship that made it so the two of them didn't feel alone anymore.<br><br> Yui hasn't done much besides dragging him around on shitty dates. <br> Yukino still has very little development. <br><br>Part of me can't believe I'm actually responding to a shitposter this obvious but I didn't read anything past your first line until I had half my post typed up.<br><br>At least you're half right on the last point- Yui has been open about her feelings, she just hasn't been DIRECT with them, because she knows pushing them on 8man would just scare him away. Yukino has opened up as much as she can which, given her issues isn't a whole lot. "Help me someday" was a huge moment of growth for her, though it seems like she's plateaued since then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Orimoto is the only girl who doesn't want to fuck him.</br>   commie seeing who is still watching the OP   <br>No, and that's why she's digging him so hard. She hasn't seen him at his worst, but she likes what she's seen.</br>  Yui won.  <br>What do you mean?<br>When he was a loner or when he was doing his genuine shit?<br>If you mean 8man throwing himself to the grinder for Sagami and Ebina, then no.</br></br></br>   Season 2 ends of a cliffhanger <br> "BUY THE LN FAGGOTS" -Watari Wataru <br> LN ends the exact same way <br><br>God fucking dammit Watari.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's smart, see's through bullshit, hold's his own, and calls out others who at first glance would seem above his punching power(Hayama), and is relatively fashionable and attractive. <br><br>He's basically an stealth alpha once you get to know him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> try google searching for verification <br> error 400: you've made an illegal request <br><br>What the fuck /a/</br></br></br></br>  <br> exiting the entrance </br>  commie or horrible subs?  <br><br> PRAISE THE SUN! </br></br>  <br>I just want to see how they use they weapons and mutually destroy eachother.

She's solved no problems.  <br>The only thing S2 has over S1 is Iroha. S1 wins.</br>  Do I even want to see this open ending because FEEL is too pussy to make Yukino win.  <br>Yes, in both scenarios Yui does indeed intend for 8man to shoot her down.<br><br>However, they differ in that one guy is saying Yui actually confessed for the sake of claiming 8man.<br><br>While the other guy is saying that Yui confessed for the sake of pulling them back to square 1 (back when no one had made a move on 8man)<br>At least this is what I think. I may be wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  She's basically an upgraded Yui. FInally found the best girl of the show.  <br>She might not win the war but she won S2 by landslide. Yukino stock has never been lower.<br>She is even more unlikable than the Yukino during the stuco election. Can people still like her even after reading the latest vol?</br></br>  <br><br>Middle option takes the position Yui has no intention of ever actually following through with her proposal, as it's designed to be turned down by 8man, and reject everything it stands for, thus rejecting the stalemate, and confronting their issues head on.<br><br>She could never do something that awful to Yukino, Yui nearly loves her as much as she loves 8man. Unless she's bi then hot damn, let the doujins flow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You may be onto something.<br><br> Humanity <br> Praise the Sun <br> End of the episode is Yui telling Yukino to   GIT GUD </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course. She knew she was going to lose from the start, but still remains determined. Remember her bid for student council president? This time, though, we know that she expected 8man to step in.</br>  <br>Episode 13 made Yukino look like a fucking robot.<br>Or an emotionless cold tuna.</br></br>  <br>Upgraded non-shit Yui.</br>  How do I find something genuine, /a/?  <br>cant wait for doujin of yui getting cucked by her momma</br>  <br>I got your genuine right here.<br><br>*unzips dick*</br></br></br>   last volume <br> yukino finally get over her problems with the others helps <br> time for 8man to choose <br> yui thinking she will lose exit the room to give them both the space <br> 8man wanted to chase after her but doesn't have the courage <br> "and why are you still here ?" <br> "b-but" <br> "go and get her" <br> 8man chases after her <br> 8man finally found her with zaimokuza,saika,etc helps <br> "hikki, what are you doing here ? are you supposed to be with the one you love" <br> pic related <br><br>SAGASHI NI YUKUUNDA SO KOEEEEE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So who's gonna take the 8man D first in the inevitable 3 some?  <br>Forgot where but I think it was stated in the LN that she plays puyo puyo and harvest moon.<br><br>She definitely has disney tsum tsum in her phone.</br></br></br>  <br>Can confirm those are legit, give me a minute to edit the raw pages in just one pic.<br><br>Watari is pushing Iroha x 8man so hard, incredible.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it made her look look like a helpless child. Or a retard.<br><br>The way she looks like a deer in headlights when Yui tries to egg her on to giving 8man her cookies, Jesus.</br></br></br>  <br>Dyed hair is genetic</br>  <br>Shit thanks man. That works a hell of a lot better than my pile of words when I posted the pic in the other thread.</br>  <br>By being yourself. :^)</br>  <br>Read 2ch they don't say anything negative about Yukino, they are well aware that Watari is doing more effort with her character. They are discussing how to help her instead of hating her like /a/ do?</br>  <br><br><br><br>It's legit, from pages 193 and 194 of the LN.<br><br>Iroha had another scene that never even got put into the anime. Not that I can read it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They broke Yukino's shell, only to find out there was nothing there.</br>  <br><br> plays the vidya <br> praises the sun <br> uses epin maymays </br></br></br></br>  Whats going to happen to Fishygaya  I don't even really understand why Yukino has to be attracted to 8man at all. What does that actually have to do with her problems? Wouldn't she be fine if she just had friends she could rely on?<br><br>This love triangle shit annoys me when it feels like Yui's entire angle from the start was about romance, but nothing in Yukino's arc has anything to do with love.</br></br>  <br>Who would have thought that her tough girl facade is the one everyone like while her real self is shit.</br>  In all seriousness, how well would Yukino handle it if she finds out 8man is cheating on her with Yui? Would Yukino shrug it off or would she take it badly?<br><br>This is if Yukino is in love with 8man btw. <br><br>Also, you guys should be able to solve this problem in the pic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui first, because Yukino would want to ride 8man's face for a while, and it's kinda rude to make a man suck his own baby batter out of you like that.</br>  <br> All throughout the story Yui is the one trying to help Yukino and befriend her <br> At the end, Yukino is the one to help Yui for the first time  <br><br>It's so poetic that I know Watari won't do it because he's a terrible writer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope they are laughing at her and calling her コピペのん (Copypaste-non)</br>  <br><br>8man took alot of what Shizuka said to him to heart.<br>Can't remember any of it, but he has mimicked other things she pointed out to him and forgot where he heard it from.<br>He's been the most honest with her and Haruno despite all the silly bear nonsense.<br><br>Being pulled out of your comfort zone doesn't mean much, unless you get something out of it. 8man got nothing. He just doesn't have much chemistry with Yui and wants to keep her at arms length because he doesn't want to lead her on.<br><br>Her skinship is more akin to her wanting a relationship rather than companionship. Those are things you do to make someone like you. It's like she's playing AA2, get enough dates, head pats, and talk about love enough the other person will eventually confess, even if most of those interactions failed. She's doing it for herself and not for 8man's own benefit.<br><br>In Iroha's case she acts sly because she knows 8man likes it and he plays along. That can go either way into companionship or a relationship.<br><br>Her being direct wouldn't scare him away, she knows she would be friendzoned. She knows she doesn't have nearly enough points.<br><br>Yukino has only "opened up" about shit she knew that 8man already figured out for himself. "HELP ME someday" gee I wonder where copypastenon got that from?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> He's smart <br>I mean he's above average seeing as how he's in an acceptable school and seems to be on track to graduate without any issues, but that's about it.<br>The real defining factor of 8man's character is that he's a selfless loner. He puts other people's happiness before his own and always has a cynical view about things.<br>He has messed up many times in trying to fulfill people's requests and that has hurt himself as well as the people close to him.<br><br> see's through bullshit <br>Not as well as you might think. It's more that he isn't afraid to call people out on it. This ties in with the problem I just mentioned. He also idealized Yukino until he was faced with the truth that he was wrong all along. Hence the "I hate myself" monologue.<br><br> hold's his own <br>Yep, that's another one of his defining characteristics. He's quite fearless in very particular situations.<br><br> calls out others who at first glance would seem above his punching power(Hayama) <br>He only really does this when he's trying to help though. Hayama was never a bad person so making him out to be a villain to be challenged isn't accurate.<br><br> relatively fashionable and attractive <br>He has decent looks aside from the fish eyes. But hey, if fish eyes are you thing then it's no big deal.<br><br> He's basically an stealth alpha once you get to know him. <br>8man isn't a social creature at all. He lets people insult him, to his face sometimes, and he's considered a weirdo by most people. I don't think you know what alpha means.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I cringed. She's all "DON'T BAIL ON ME, YUIGAHAMA NONONONONONO" at that moment.</br>   Yui did everything right <br> she will lose <br> Yukino just cries about her problems and acts deredere <br> she will win <br>Why is this okay?</br></br></br></br>  <br> She's solved no problems. <br><br>Did you not just see the intended outcome she designed?</br></br></br>  <br><br> 「……他の人には内緒ですよ？」 <br> 昔の俺なら一瞬で即落ちだったよ、今の？ <br><br>Tell me this is real and not just some fake spoilers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino would either break or go 110% Haruno and just destroy them.</br>  <br> This time 8man won't wait, he will chase instead. </br>  <br> laughing <br> hating </br></br>  <br><br>Confirmed, pic related<br><br>Verification for you guys.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Honestly, if Iroha doesn't at least confess next volume, Watari is a massive hack.<br>These new spoilers are ridiculous, 8man is full dere dere / muh dick for Iroha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One anon suggested that Yukino is merely copying Yui's love for 8man, but doesn't know what to do with it. I'm unsure if Yukino's feelings are genuine at all.</br>  <br>I Fucking hate it how the terms alpha and beta have not only been appropriated by Internet retards, but that they don't even make sense anymore. <br><br>An alpha is someone who has no social circles and let's himself get walked all over? What?</br></br></br>    <br> Yukino just cries about her problems and acts deredere <br> she will win <br>Yukino is fake as shit. Why would she win when Yui is shown to be the most genuine girl right now?</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for making me regret trying to put any thought into your posts, anon.<br><br>Have an Iroha trying in vain to measure up to Yui for besting me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yui, with no protection, on a dangerous day.</br></br>  Commie pls do the blurays.  <br>sha~</br>  Reading this thread only made me more confused.<br><br>From what I've gathered, are there two schools of thought?<br><br>(1) Yui confessed with the intent to claim Hachiman for herself, yet knew 8man would reject her. Can someone explain why she would do this? Doesn't make sense to me.<br><br>(2) Yui confessed with the intent to "mutually disarm" and revert everything back to normal. This sort of makes sense, since as another /a/non mentioned, 8man would reject the status quo and force everyone, notably Yukino, to move forward.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That'd be interesting. I never considered that kind of angle. Seems to somber for this story, but in a way, it would make sense.<br><br>I don't think that's how it's going to end up, but I'd have a lot of respect for the story going that direction, with Yukino maybe realizing that she doesn't actually need or want a relationship when she's still got so many of her own issues to sort out.</br></br></br>  <br>Fake</br>  <br>While YY had their drama moments, Iroha managed to get not one, but two scenes. How can you tease us like this, Watari?</br>  <br>How does it compare to the spoon scene?</br>  <br><br>Hello Alone Yukino Ballad<br><br>A tear will roll down her cheek, but she'll be standing tall, with anime smug girl face, while Haruno is opposite her losing her cool.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xaT<wbr>znrAN6t8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really understand how Watari can handle every other character fine, but go full retard with Yukino's. What the fuck is he thinking?</br>  <br><br>Yukino is doing exactly what she did with Hayama, you're supposed to think exactly what you're thinking.</br></br>  <br>She did more than anyone for the club itself but as far as requests go, 8man easily wins the contest. Sensei will also likely give him the win since she favors him.</br>  Ok, I'm rewatching the final scene and giving a play-by-play so we can properly decipher it.<br><br> Yui says she wants to figure out what's next with her, Yukino, and 8man <br> Yui looks into the eyes of Yukino angrily and her fists start shaking and lips start trembling <br><br>Declaration of war, about to do something that takes courage.<br><br> Yui gives cookies to 8man while not making eye contact with him with a shy look in her eyes while running up, solid eye contact and confidence while talking to him afterwards <br> Yukino feels her heart rip in two and touches her bag knowing she fucked up by not giving 8man his cookies back in front of the school <br> Yukino then shakes her head to rid herself of that memory (?) while still looking stressfully at the exchange between Yui and 8man before looking away <br> Yui says "remember my request?" referring to her first request of the club, to make cookies for someone <br> Yukino chimes in with "tezukuri cookies," providing a different meaning to the cookies other than fulfilling the request <br> "You're amazing, Yuigahama" blatant double meaning, doesn't need explaining <br> Next few lines are just Yui re-affirming her confenssions to 8man in a round-about way <br> Yui: "I want it all. What we have now, and what we'll have in the future. I'm a coward. I play dirty." <br><br>She wants everything. She's selfish. She wants 8man as a bf and Yukino as a bff.<br><br> Yui: "But I've made up my mind." Yukino suddently looks dejected. <br> Yui: "If we figure out how each of us feels, I don't think we'll be able to stay the same." <br><br>Basically just the status quo argument from Tobe's request. When feelings and love and everything get involved, friendships and relationships crumble.<br><br> Yui does her "final task, final request" thing, which is to fix their problems <br> Yui brings up the battle between the club where whoever helps the most people gets to order the loser to do whatever they want <br><br>Continued...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui says she can solve the problem Yukino is facing, and how this solution will solve the club's problems too <br><br>This right here says Yui is wrong because the whole plotline of Yukino to stop depending on people will just continue to be perpetuated if she goes through with this.<br><br> Yui says by doing this, she will win the battle <br> 8man starts his internal monologue about she didn't specify anything and everything is all vague, and if she would put it into words it would confirm everything, but Yui is purposefully avoiding doing that <br> Yui says it might not be fair, but this is all she could think of to keep the status quo the same and keep the three of them "this way forever" <br><br>Going back to what we learned from the Tobe request, maintaining the status quo when romantic feelings are involved means not confessing and/or staying friends without letting the romantic feelings get in the way. This goes against what the series has been preaching for the three of them though, with all the talk of being "genuine" and stuff.<br><br> Yui asks what they think of that <br> 8man starts another internal monologue about how Yui was probably searching for the right answers to all the problems while Yukino and 8man go be autists, and how accepting her proposal would make things easier <br> Yui walks up to Yukino, grabs her hand, and asks "are you okay with that, Yukinon?" <br><br>She's laying into Yukino. She's forcing her to make a move. She's asking her in no uncertain terms "are you okay with letting the status quo remain? are you okay with not discovering and announcing your feelings?"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Being this much of an autist </br>  Best girl is  Sensei   <br>What<br>the<br>fuck<br>is<br>this<br>shit<br>watari</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What a waste of time this season was.  <br> Yui and Yukino look into each other's eyes with that glimmering "omg they're going to cry" anime eye effect and Yukino is obviously taken aback and doesn't want to go with Yui's request of maintaining the status quo <br> Yukino starts to answer and mumbles out a "watashi wa..." in a broken voice <br> Yukino then starts to answer with a more facially confident "watashi wa..." (smiling, etc.) but her voice is still noticably wavering and broken <br><br>This means that her first "watashi wa" was her thinking about what she really wanted vs. what was "best" for the club (aka Yui's suggestion). The second one was her begrudgingly succumbing to Yui's suggestion and being ready to give up everything.<br><br> Yui realizes this, and now has a look of disappointment in her eyes <br> All throughout this exchange, 8man started another internal monologue about how Yui was wrong, and her suggestion is bullshit and does nothing to further Yukino's independence as it will leave her future, again, in someone else's hands <br> Yukino takes one last gasp of air before making her declaration of being ok with Yui's suggestion while Yui looks on with a noticeable look of disgust <br> Yukino starts saying "I wouldn't mind-" with pain and tears in her voice, saying that she'd accept Yui's proposal, but it obviously isn't what she really wants <br><br>Yukino not being genuine, again.<br><br> 8man speaks up and saves the day <br> 8man says Yukino needs to solve her problems herself instead of being disingenuous and putting on the visage of happiness and content that she always does <br> Yukino looks surprised because 8man just said what she wanted to but couldn't <br><br>ayy lmao Yukino relying on 8man again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I go with (1)<br>Yui is tired of all of them acting like superficial friends. She knows 8man wont accept her proposal and got everyone to talk about the elephant in the room.<br>Yukino will never act and Yui back her into the corner so much that she finally talk. Yui is being fair to her.</br></br></br>  <br>It's more accurate to say that 8man is an idealized beta.</br>  <br>I'd have to see a pretty big wall of text detailing it before I bought that. I don't think Yukino had even been sufficiently aware of Yui's feelings until very recently, so it really doesn't explain a lot of her earlier dere moments.<br><br>If there is a flaw to Yukino's love, I'm still 100% behind the idea that it's simply too difficult to separate her real feelings from her dependency on him.</br></br></br>  <br> Yui looks at 8man, her face is hard to read. Not anger, not disgust, but not happiness either. <br> Yui is a nice girl, Yukino is a strong girl, 8man says these are things he accepted without question regardless of their basis in truth and they are ideals he held each girl to <br> 8man says Yui's solution is nothing but deceit and he doesn't want "vague answers" or "superficial relationships" <br> 8man says he knows that by doing things this way, he knows how it'll end, with him being alone and with nothing <br><br>8man thinks that by not accepting the easy way out and not maintaining the status quo, things will go awry due to their struggle and he'll be left as he was before the service club started.<br><br> 8man says he wants them to sruggle, writhe, etc in order to find the answer instead of faking it <br> Yui, with tears in her eyes, says she had a feeling 8man would say all that while Yukino looks on with tears in her eyes <br> Yui looks back at Yukino, smiling, and Yukino realizes what this means and starts looking shyly at the ground before telling Yui "don't you tell me how I feel" and telling 8man "this isn't the final anything" <br><br>Blah blah blah, Yukino not being genuine with her feelings again even though Yui and every person watching the anime/reading the LN knows how she feels.<br><br> Yukino says "we still have your request" <br><br>8man's made two requests, but we know the one she's referring to obviously.<br><br> Ends with Yukino saying she has a request, but we don't hear it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukinoshit has lived her entire life an empty shell mimicking others in a desperate need to fulfill the void in herself. There's not much to her that's genuine: the only genuine thing about her is her call to 8man for help in the future.</br>  <br>So, all in all, taking everything into account (facial cues, audio cues, etc.) the only proper conclusion I can draw from all this is that Yui a) makes her feelings towards 8man 100% known to Yukino with the cookies and basically says "you're a pussy", b) Yui provides a bullshit conclusion to their issues in the hopes that Yukino speaks up and turns it down because it would be disingenuous, c) Yukino originally plans on going with it and throwing away her feelings for 8man and maintaining the status quo, d) 8man then speaks up and gives the answer Yui was looking for all along, that they'll work out their issues properly instead of sweeping everything under the rug, and they'll face all emotions and feelings head on instead of running away from them like Tobe's group did with his request. Yui goaded Yukino and 8man into action. She's already given up in the 8man bowl.</br>  <br> Wouldn't she be fine if she just had friends she could rely on <br>which friend?</br></br>  <br><br>Your argument makes sense if S2 wasn't all about breaking down 8man's cynical world views.<br><br>Like hating "nice girls", and ignoring any sign of affection in order to not get hurt.<br><br>At the end of the final episode, 8man finally realizes he's pigeonholed both girls onto false images he's created.<br><br>Underestimated and misunderstood Yui, and putting Yukino on a pedastel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's already given up in the 8man bowl. <br>And how the fuck did you come to that conclusion?<br>She is way ahead of Yukino right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino's character is fine, the problem is people keep trying to shoehorn her into being a serious love interest.</br>  <br>i want to cuddle with yukino</br>  I get the feeling all /a/ wants is a series with perfect characters that make no mistakes and always do what's right.<br><br>Because fuck love triangles, fuck conflict, and fuck character development.<br><br>Just have cute girls doing cute girl things while worshiping the main character.<br><br>And fuck it why not have like 6 girls so that everyone has someone they like?<br><br>Why stop there? We're tired of things progressing slowly, why not have all the girls trying to fuck the MC and have them half naked all the time?<br><br>Is this what you want /a/? Are you really so afraid of actual storytelling that you'll call the series shit and complain whenever things don't turn out like a fairytail?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Delusionalfags sugar-quoting Yui's action and words.<br><br> Yukino walks out in the penguin scene but 8man chooses to be with her. <br> Yukino almost says she'll agree to Yui's demand; 8man stops her. <br><br>Now tell me why Yui likes to suffer; is she a maso?</br></br></br></br></br>   mfw people are discussing Yui vs Yukino <br> mfw new spoilers just showed 8man accepting yet another move by Iroha </br>  <br>sha~</br>  Yui's mom is fucking hot  <br>It's different interpretations as to what the hell Yui is talking about when she says she'll take it all, and what exactly she's trying to offer as a solution. Ultimately it doesn't matter, the end goal is to shake them out of steady state.<br><br>The way I see it, Yui isn't outright confessing or getting rejected. She's asking Yukino to back down before she confirms her feelings for 8man. In giving 8man the cookies, Yui is saying that she is confident in her feelings as contrasted to Yukino, and that Yukino backs down, she can avoid getting hurt.<br><br>My interpretation of keeping "this way forever" was that she doesn't mean that they'll maintain the same relationships because she knows they can't, but she's saying they can still all be together even if she makes her move on 8man if Yukino just agrees to dismiss her tumultuous feelings.<br><br>The reason I think this over the idea that she just wants to maintain the status quo is because she first off obviously makes a confession that is clear to both 8man and Yukino, and because she declares that she doesn't just want to lose. I don't feel like she's actually being selfish or playing dirty by saying she wants the status quo, nor do I think that saying she wants to keep things the way they are is enough of a stimulus to rock the boat, which is clearly her intent.<br><br>But again, either way, the effect is the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The simple explanation is she's regressing to the same situation she had with Hayama.<br><br>Find someone to idolize, and depend on, then turn their dependency into love.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's some more shitposting 4u<br><br>8man is Naruto, wants to make connections<br><br>Yui is Sakura, just stands there with a kunai pretty much useless<br><br>Yukino is Sasuke, thinks she's above everyone else because of her bloodline, gets bootyblasted everytime 8man gets shit done where she couldn't has to run to Orochimaru(Haruno?) for help<br><br>8man got hit by Yukino's car <br>Yeah Sorry...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only redeeming quality of this episode.</br>   help me someday <br> no you dumb bitch do it yourself <br> meanwhile he helps Iroha all the time <br><br>fucking kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, FEEL went full Yukino-fag the last few episodes.<br>They cut everything that would make you think 8man likes Yui and highlighted everything that makes you think he likes Yukino. They even gave Yukino the final end card just to salt the wounds.</br></br>  <br>The way she handles relationships and love are two separate matters when dealing with Yukino.<br>Her main focus isn't love like the other girls.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Yukino walks out in the penguin scene but 8man chooses to be with her. <br><br>「……中で待っているわ」<br><br>　言葉少なにそう言って、振り返ることもなく、園内へと戻っていく。<br><br>　ペンギンゾーンは野外だ。天候のことを考えればそろそろ中へ戻ってもいい<wbr>頃合いだろう。<br><br>　声をかけて俺たちも先に進もうと振り返ると、由比ヶ浜はまだ二羽のフンボ<wbr>ルトペンギンをじっと見つめていた。目を細め、優しい眼まな差ざしを送って<wbr>いる。<br><br>「……そろそろ行くか」<br><br>「あ、うん……。もうちょっと見てから行く。……あ、あのちっちゃいのの写<wbr>真も撮らなきゃだし！　……すぐ行くよ」<br><br>　言って、フェアリーペンギンのほうを指差して携帯電話を掲げて見せると、<wbr>またフンボルトペンギンのほうへと向き直った。手にしている携帯電話も使わ<wbr>れる様子はなく、ただぎゅっと強く握りしめられている。<br><br>「……そうか」<br><br>　そんな様子を見てしまうと、それ以上何かを言うことは憚はばかられた。短<wbr>く答えて、俺は一足先に建物内へと足を向ける。<br><br>　背後ではきゅいっと鳴き交わす、二羽の鳴き声が少し悲し気に聞こえていた<wbr>。</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is irrelevant they said <br> Iroha was rejected and looked down to the bowl they said <br> Iroha didn't manage to give 8man chocolate they said <br> 8man has no feelings for Iroha they said <br> Iroha ship already sunk they said <br><br>And yet she gets all the romantic flirting scenes while the service club is drowning in cheapass k-drama</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I hope the new VN has routes for all the girls. Yukino, Yui, Komachi, Saika, Saki, Sensei, Miura, Ebina, Iroha, Kaori, Haruno, Meguri, and Yukimom.</br></br>  <br><br><br>So what's even going on here? Does 8man just get some cookies and respond to them well? Or is there at least a second round of heavy flirting?<br><br>I can't imagine it's that heavy since Miura's present.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't she realize that her actions will make them both codependent?<br><br>codependency is not a good thing anon!</br></br></br>  <br> sugar-quoting <br>This must be bait, but you honestly think Yui likes to suffer?</br></br>  <br> Discussing the central plot of the series instead of sperging over another Iroha flag that will inevitably go nowhere <br>I see no problems with this.</br></br>  <br>IROHA OR DEATH</br>  <br>It's almost as we treat every person differently in our day to day lives.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>This makes more sense than anything I've read so far regarding theories. The biggest tell for me was the disappointment on Yui's face when Yukino was going to accept her proposal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> (1) Yui confessed with the intent to claim Hachiman for herself <br><br>(2) Yui confessed with the intent to "mutually disarm" and revert everything back to normal.<br><br>Yui has no intention that her plan will be followed through at.<br><br>The plan is for all status quo to be BTFO by 8man, and Yui would never intend for her to INTENTLY plan on blocking Yukino from confessing to 8man.<br><br>Her intention is for the plan to be rejected from the get go, and avoid status quos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're in for a surprise.</br>  Just when I needed her  <br>Figure out who was right and report back to us. By who I'm referring to the 2 anons mentioned by </br>  <br/>  <br>Exactly. To Yukino romance serves as a character conflict and nothing more. She's in no way written to actually have a chance at winning 8man.</br>  <br>Because if you watched the final scene that's the obvious conclusion you'd come to. Everything Yui does is to goad Yukino into action.</br>  <br>Don't tell them yet, anon.</br>  At this point, I want an an end where neither Yui or Yukino win.<br><br>Loner End, Iroha End, Orimoto End, Miura End, Ebina End, doesn't matter. Both of these bitches are crazy and I'm surprised 8man has put up with them this whole time.<br><br>But if I had to choose between those two, Yui probably deserves to win the most as shown by this episode. She tries so hard and finally wants to come clear with what she wants and her feelings whereas Yukino can't do anything by herself for shit without following someone or having someone tell her what to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Is this what you want /a/? <br>I do. Even better if we remove the MC so I can get more screentime for the girls.</br></br>  <br> "Hey Yukino-chan, get in the car. The scheduled biweekly worming is an hour from now." </br>  <br> no best girl gahamama </br>  <br>I don't. That sounds terrible. You would just have micro-routes for everyone.<br><br>I would much prefer the developers focus on the main 3 heroines. Every additional route would just waste budget and degrade from the overall experience.</br></br></br>  <br> Hayama like girl with Y <br>Hayama x Yui confirmed</br></br>  Commie subs pls mai sides cant take this.  Does anyone have the Last Samurai image?  <br>2 is correct. She did it with the intent of 8man/Yukino shooting her down. This is evidenced by her reactions to Yukino's almost acceptance and 8man's refusal.</br>  <br>I just want to see Yukino and 8man hug</br>  <br>If that is the case, then aren't (1) and (2) the fucking same?<br><br>In both scenarios, Yui WANTS Hachiman to say no, destroying any status quo and forcing everyone to move forward and be genuine with their feelings.</br></br></br>  <br> And Yukino will still win because main girl <br>Bravo Japan. Bra-fucking-vo.</br></br>  <br>8man figured out Yukino's dependency problem. Giving into her "help me" plea would only cement her dependence on him.</br>  <br>In the LN it was Yui who asked 8man to go after Yukino.</br>  <br>Other anons have already said it but I'll say it again- Yui wants a level playing field.<br><br>She was afraid of them hurting when everyones' feelings were in the open and she may have been considering concession to Yukino, but after 8man shut her down as she expected to, it renewed her own resolve. Yui will not go down without a fight.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the LN</br>  <br>it must be intentional Iroha didnt meet Komachi yet</br>  <br>Yes, the results are the same.</br>  <br>8man blew the "help me someday" card when he stopped her from giving in to Yui's request</br>  <br>Her level playing field IS a concession. She could've BTFO Yukino because Yukino doesn't know what she wants while Yui does.<br><br>Yui is fucking herself over by reaffirming Yukino's feelings fo rher.</br></br></br>  <br>She already is gorgeous with her hair up.<br><br>Would love it if the two MILFs were the main girls instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait so how do the two differ? At this point my head feels like fucking jello, I can't think clearly anymore.</br>  <br> Yukino can't do anything by herself for shit <br>That's how you can always tell the winning girl. She never has to do anything; fate has decreed that the hero will fall in love with her and that's romantic as fuck because it's all predetermined.</br></br>  <br>Komachi would immediately read their relationship and realize they're basically in JUST FUCK ALREADY status.</br>  <br>This. Watari even had to tweet that they turned an innocent scene into full blown yukinoshipping.</br>  <br>Just in the interpretation of what Yui was offering to be rejected.</br>  <br>I dont think he was ever cynical.<br>He just wanted to rationalize his feelings and the actions he takes.<br>He wants to rationalize his loneliness by labeling everyone else fake assholes.<br><br>Yui herself wasn't so sure of her feelings for 8man when he brought up her feelings for him as feelings of pity. She tried to rationalize that her feelings would have manifested some other way through a club request.<br><br>If she was so sure of her feelings she could have just kissed him then and there, and 8man would've dismissed some of his insecurities about her, but she walked away sulking.<br><br>S2 is about people punching 8man in the feels and telling him he isn't living his life right, when it's everyone else who are wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>5 stages of loss and grief. <br><br>Stage one: denial and isolation. <br><br>Expect the second stage of anger coming soon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>S1 has the world revolves around 8man and we only see how he's always right and other characters must suck his cock.<br>S2 is better since it's more serious and we get to see what the other characters are thinking and they aren't always "muh popularity".</br></br></br>  <br>Komachi would be so pissed because Iroha would actually be a threat. All the other girls are people that 8man instinctively rejects, which is why she supports all of them. But Iroha is an active threat to her position as his cute little sister.</br>  <br> wrong as expected </br>  <br>50 bucks on komachi shipping her with 8man harder than any of the other girls.<br><br>Volume 12 here we go.</br></br></br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br> he still thinks Iroha is imoutozoned </br>  <br>Why are they such best girls?</br>  <br> Just in the interpretation of what Yui was offering to be rejected. <br><br>Sorry, what exactly are the interpretations of what Yui was offering?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>DING DING DING!<br><br>Exactly what I was trying to get at.<br><br>Yui's intent all along for the proposal to be rejected, not to take advantage over anyone, especially Yukino.<br><br><br> She's already given up in the 8man bowl. <br><br>A sad conclusion she probably thinks for herself, because of how low her self-esteem is, how no one really expects anything out of her.<br><br>But what does 8man think about it Yui now would be interesting. Shame FEEL took out a lot of his inner monologue on that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino will win. Not because she has romantic chemistry with 8man. Not because she helps 8man overcome his own issues. Not because she's the best fit for him. <br><br>But because she's the first girl and this is Japan. You're delusional if you think she won't win especially when this LN is now written like a poor kdrama where the firstgirl always wins.</br></br></br>  <br> Yui is fucking herself over by reaffirming Yukino's feelings fo rher. <br>It just shows that she cares for Yukino and doesn't want to just stomp all over her when she's most vulnerable. Why people would claim Yui is a cunt when she does this is beyond me.</br></br>  <br>She would be pissed that he has been hiding Iroha from her.</br>  <br>Nobody knows what they even say. What do you expect?<br><br>This thread is actually quite productive, people would be discussing the scene if it were translated.<br><br> Well probably not, because the spoon scene pretty much cemented Iroha's position and anything else before she confesses to 8man is mostly redundant. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My goddess</br>  <br>Wasn't Sensei first girl?</br>  <br>Imoutozoned is pretty good when the protagonist is a siscon.<br><br><br>see </br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Yui was asking Yukino to give up and let Yui have the 8man.<br><br>The other guy thinks Yui was asking Yukino to agree to neither of them going for the 8man and maintaining the status quo.</br></br></br>  <br>What? They're released already.</br>  <br>First day in these threads? Check the archives during the almost kiss scene.</br>  <br>I don't know why, but I kinda liked the art style of S1, it had a certain charm. Hachiman doesn't look as slimy in S2.</br>  <br> It's different interpretations as to what the hell Yui is talking about when she says she'll take it all, <br><br>It's obviously only the face of her proposal, designed to be as negative as possible in 8man's eyes so he rejects it.</br></br></br>   people seriously watching Commie Oregairu <br><br>They can't fuck up Yahallo that badly. Yo 'sup? What were they thinking? <br>Changed to Horriblesubs after one episode.  They only made on mistake in the last scene. </br></br></br>  <br>Because THEY'RE cunts. Yui is too good for this shit.</br>  <br>That wasn't Watari criticizing the animation, it was just him poking fun at 8man.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br>She's only disqualified because she's sensei. 8man is absolutely smitten with her.</br>  <br>Let me spoonfeed you just this time, new guy.<br>I hope you like maymay translations.</br></br>  <br>I never said it was criticizing, just that it was changed from the LN (which was more innocent and more of the usual). Watari acknowledged it.</br>  Since we can't agree on best girl, who's the worst girl?<br><br>Hint: Pic related</br></br>  <br> Yui All Alone now.jpg <br><br>http://<span>youtu.be/OHgHuKPSQlQ  [ ]<br><br>Hello, hello, alone  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  Machine translated tweet because shitposting.<br><br>Watariwataru: "Yui and Yukino , their relationship while in contrast, it resembles the actual very well, surface layer and the foundation is compatible"<br><br>If Yui and Yukino have found the actual, what does 8man get?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not. He can't get over the age gap because he's got shit moral sense.</br>  <br/>  <br>Yui acted out of fear, and fear alone. She was so afraid of losing that she tried to force Yukino into the friendship route.<br><br>That doesn't make her a bad person considering what she wrote in her diary but you're a fool if you can't see why it would upset some people.</br></br></br>  <br>Who's the best crack pairing?<br><br> (pink) <br> ebin <br> sore aru </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui</br>  <br>Was going to say something or other, but realized that there's really no point anymore, but here's one last "have at you" again, to make this my last post on this subject</br>  Since Yukinofans are autistic and terrible at reading people, despite thinking they are good at it, just like 8man, clearly Yukino is the best and most genuine ending, as Yukinofans are the most similar to 8man and thus know what is best for him.<br><br>Additionally, this entire point is stupidly faulty logic which 8man also often displays, further cementing the similarities.<br><br>As such, Yukino is the objectively best end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, this is my reason as well for watching S1, it's quite unconventional which is why S2 is quite disappointing. Malfags have it the other way around though.</br>  <br>You are still talking from your ass</br>  Watari is waiting for Iroha to meet Komachi after they're already dating.<br><br> Komachi I have a girlfriend now <br> ONII-CHAN YOU FINALLY GOT ONE WAS IT YUI OR YUKINO <br> Her name is Iroha <br> Who? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha</br>  <br><br>Protip: it's becasue FEEL knows how it's going to end, and is setting the anime up for that end because anime viewers are largely younger kids and idiots, plus everyone knows adapting a book into a movie/TV show is hard and requires some things to be cut. The LN is left somewhat vague as the final girl because it has more chance at exposition, but the anime has to kinda force it in order to maintain interest and fit everything in properly.</br></br>  <br>Whatever you say, anon.</br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>She had no fear of losing.

If it’s for that, I think I can hang in there. <br> But I get scared that the more I try, the more it’ll get farther away from me. <br> The truth is, I’d be fine with a lie. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever you say, bro.</br>  <br><br>Her humanity is grossly incandescent.</br></br>  <br>cunt of course</br>  Why couldn't we protect that cheeky smirk  <br>Because kdrama happened.</br>    <br> 「……他の人には内緒ですよ？」 <br><br> もはや素直に恐ろしい……。昔の俺なら一瞬で即落ちだったよ、今の？ <br><br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAA</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As someone who struggles in social interaction, you have to wonder if he even knows what "falling in love" actually means.</br>  <br>We don't know, but it's a harem anime so whoever ends up confessing to him will be the one he likes.</br>  <br> b) Yui provides a bullshit conclusion to their issues... <br><br>What was the bullshit conclusion she provides? I'm on the subway to work, can't rewatch the scene unfortunately.</br></br></br>  <br>It's both. A part of her would have been fine with the lie of her proposal. But the real her wants the painful truth and that was what Hachiman gave her when he rejected it. .</br>  <br><br>Now I don't have to type a reply to you guys anymore.<br><br><br><br>Thanks anon, this cherished image will be a holy relic to beat back the hordes of chaos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yui's ballad. <br>Based.</br>  <br>He does, the problem is he just shies away from it now because he fell hard for girls that didn't return his feelings before.</br>  <br>Maintain the status quo, push all their feelings aside, don't be "genuine" with each other, etc. Basically, a way for them to all remain friends without ever discussing the pink elephant in the room and just letting their feelings go by the wayside.</br>  <br><br>Anon collated all posts explaining everything here </br></br>  <br>All I know for sure is that Feel really wants us to believe he likes Yukino.<br>See <br><br>Honestly though 8man's feelings are a wild card. They could be anything and we just don't know. He simply hasn't given any clear indication that he wants to become romantically involved with any of them. All we get is it usual shit we've been getting for the entire series in regards to romantic hints.</br></br></br></br>  <br>god dammit that OCR software you are using is mixing furigana to actual sentences. Please considering choosing another one.</br>  <br>And that was the thing that 8man hates most.<br> <br>Yui know it and believe 8man gonna reject her proposal.</br></br></br>  <br>This is what always bother me about the LN/Anime. <br>When it come to everyone else (iroha, saika, hayama, etc) , 8man's monologue always make it clear how he feels about them. But when it come to Yui and Yukinon, it always vague and shit. It's like he always avoid thinking about them.</br></br>  I was worried this episode was going to feature some very blatant confessions with 'I Love You' but it wasn't the case. Obviously giving cookies is a big sign, but ultimately they talk in vague enough terms to pretend that it's all fine.<br><br>They're still not quite there though. They talk about being genuine and wanting to fix their relationships and misunderstandings. But instead of doing it then and there, they talk about it as an ongoing request and drop it. Why not just blatantly say 'We both like Hikki, choose one of us fgt'? There's no subtlety that way and Watari wants to stretch it out some more.</br></br>  <br>Can someon give sense to this moonrunes? I'm not skilled enough to get it.</br>  <br>This. Ichigo 100% was one of my first harem manga, yet till now no harem girls ever come close to the perfectness that is Tsukasa Nishino.</br>  <br>I don't know man. <br><br>When Yui give 8man her cookies and emphasis it as thank you gift. I think it was separation gift from Yui to 8man.</br></br></br>  <br> yui <br> won't nag you <br>  will development on a great mama (with a sexy body as seen) <br><br> yukinon <br>  high maintenance <br>  will develop like her mom, a raising in personality and in bed <br><br>the choice was obvious after this!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a kindle text rip. <br>You're seeing the furigana in the middle because it's also extracting the rubies along with it.</br></br>  <br>Because this an anime that's supposed to reflect real life in a roundabout way, and that scenario with both girls confessing and making the MC choose only happens in shitty harem series that have no basis in reality outside of NEETs wet dreams.</br>  <br><br><br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-a/prologue-1/<br>Yui's own thoughts before she did any of this.<br><br>She's not at all the saint you guys make her out to be.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Pick your poison.  <br>Fucking disgusting.<br>They're all fat.</br></br>  Man I was asshurt as hell when the fat guy was actually nice and had a heart to heart with the brown girl only for it to end up in a gangbang anyways.  <br>The "fat" just needs to be in the right places.</br>  <br>Fat fuck ends up being a hypocrite.</br>  <br>As expected, fat people are amoral.</br>  <br><br>Yeah it was the old man who was the hypocrite.</br></br>  <br>I would casually fuck the brown-haired slut.</br>  I can't wait till I'm a fat old man and can enjo kosai all the gyaru.  <br>Gyaru are extinct in Japan besides porn.<br><br>A lot of those past mainstream gyaru fashion magazines have shut down.<br><br>It's considered an outdated fashion style now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Delicious brown <br> Fucked by a fat guy <br><br>Yet again</br></br></br></br>   not watching the only gal anime   <br> as long as japan is still filled with betas, fat ugly fucks are the ones that are going to bang all the delicious gyaru </br>  <br> fat  <br> delicious <br>Choose one.</br></br></br>  <br>What is the fucking appeal?<br><br>There's a July hentai dropping with another delicious brown getting fucked by some especially sub-human nidnog<br><br><br>Just more of her to love, baby</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> subhuman gets fucked by a subhuman <br>I don't see the issue.</br></br>  <br>You trying to say I gotta deal with pic related type of sluts now?<br><br>There also needs to be a clarity and distinction of what is Gyaru. Certainly in any era there will be trendy slutty gals. <br>It's also doesn't seem like JK have gone back to being more conservative, Their uniforms are still as slutty as ever.<br><br> shame about kuro gyaru death though </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Equating 2d brown to 3d brown <br>I want /a/ to stop</br></br>  <br>All brown is subhuman. If there can be 2D nignogs then it's alright to equate it.</br>  <br>Pretty fierce battle between Ikeman nampa artists and Big dick oji-sans. Ikeman might have good looks and charm but those business men have deep wallets and they can just buy a bigger dick. <br>As Adam Smith put it, "The great affair, we always find, is to get money.

They are already almost non-existent in regular manga (or at least what has been translated), and I can't remember since we last saw one in an anime. I really hope they remain as a fetish for as long as possible, it will be a sad day when there is no more cute brown gyaru sluts to fap to.</br>  <br>I don't think we have ever gotten a brown Gal that wasn't some stereotypical gonk caricature. It might not be brown, but best we can hope for is a Gyaru-ko anime.<br><br>Mika getting so much screen time in the Cinderella Girls anime is also nice.</br></br></br>  <br>God damn it. I fucking hate fatties, so why does this get me hard?</br>  <br>this is very pretty and cute</br>  <br>Can't help it. Gyaru exist pretty much made to drain your balls.</br>  I want to marry a gyaru!  <br>So you want to marry as slut?</br>  <br>a*</br>  <br>I'd make her my slut!</br>  Would you run away JK sluts?

Futaba?<br>It's times like this where I wish I knew moon</br>  I want to  _be_  Yuuna      GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!<br><br>I got sick of the 2nd VN not being translated so I decided to go do a scenario myself.<br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/q<wbr>ppe7mp6adnelap/10-Inubouzaki+Fuu+ca<wbr>n%27t+deal+with+ghosts.txt<br><br>The translations are http://pastebin.com/KGYa8RaR but heavily edited as the original were crap. My Japanese is not amazing, so some things I had to assume the original was right in, but at least the English grammar is now readable. Also there are a few things lost in translation, especially さしすせそ, but if that's a problem, just go learn Japanese already.<br><br>Instructions for inserting the script into the VN can be found here: https://www.mediafire.com/folder/67<wbr>05q59djxz5n/YuYuYuS<br><br>It took a lot longer than I expected, mainly because the game crashes if there isn't a line break in the right space in every single goddamn line and English takes up so much more space than Japanese. Still, it would've been impossible without the guy who provided the mediafire files for inserting the script into the VN (see above), so kudos to him.<br><br>If someone else wants to do other ones, I'd be happy to provide editing/translating work for the other 2 crappy translations ( http://pastebin.com/3Jn10QDg and http://pastebin.com/cGYp9HEy ) but I'm not going through that line-spacing nightmare again. Have fun.<br><br>But on the bright side, enjoy Fuu and Itsuki trapped in slime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon!</br>  <br>Thanks anon!

I've been really busy lately, but now I have some time to work on adding translation data.<br>Also some good news, while fiddling with the data files I found how to remove the text size limit, so separating lines won't be necessary anymore, I also found how to translate the color codes for names so adding the @ won't be necessary either.<br><br><br>Yeah the most annoying part is getting the line breaks right, but the crashing issue should disappear with this fix, if you can edit the other translations I'll gladly add them to the script file.<br><br>After I'm done re-editing the existing translations so they work with the new fix I'll upload them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, good times</br>  <br>There's still 3 unannounced news so I'm pretty sure a second season will be one of them. I'm not surprised they haven't released any information about a s2 yet considering it was only a short while ago s1 aired and they didn't expect it to get the popularity it did. I rather wait for them to pan out the details than rush it.</br>  <br>i l-love you anon</br>  <br>You're doing God's work anon!</br>  Got some tiny bit of information<br> The new LN chapter doesn't directly connect to the supposed S2 but to Nowayu. <br> Highlight is Wakaba's picture. <br> Chapter has an unrest atmosphere. <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cleaned this picture up a little bit.<br>Though, having a scan in 1200 dpi and original size I'd be able to make it look better.</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>It kills my kokoro that we know that something is wrong with Yuuna but we don't even know what exactly.<br>During the whole second VN Yuuna acted like she was daijobu so the others don't have to worry.<br>God damn it Yuuna you are supposed to talk to someone if you are troubled ;_; <br>Protect Yuuki Yuuna, even if she is 100% Vertex or godess or whatever now she still is perfect!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna may turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>c-come on anon,,, t-tell me it's a joke ;_;</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>Why this</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>So she's an immortal divine being with the  soul of a lion  now.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>W-which Yuuna?</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>REAL HUMAN BEAN</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  Okay, guys. Brace yourself for chapter summary, as well as a tiny snapshot of Wakaba. <br> Chapter starts with Sonoko and Karin in the bath talking about candidates for the next club head. <br> When Sonoko went home she found an old Hero Record book. <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br> However, at the last page there's a picture of a girl that looks like her. <br> The name is Nogi Wakaba, the year is 2015. <br> Sonoko shows the book to the club. <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br> She spaces out and only comes back to her sense when Fuu calls out to her. <br> Last illustration is of the entire club looking at Wakaba's picture. <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br> Chapter ends. <br><br>Inb4, the old Yuuna's soul hijacks our current Yuuna's body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br>damn not again Taisha</br></br>    <br>I'm scared, /a/. Also, <br> 2015 </br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br><br>I bet her soul is  burning as hot as the sun .</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br>I don't want to see her cry...</br></br>  <br>Guys, we got too used to the cute SoL moments in the vita and VNs. This is the true face of Takahiro. Brace yourselves.</br>  <br>E-everything will be ok.</br>  <br> Yuuna suffering continues <br>I can't go on guys, this is too much for my heart.<br>Can't she just punch things back into daijobu again? ;_;<br>God I need NoWaYu now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Y-yeha be postive guys!<br>The healing will feel even better after Yuuna dealt with the next shit happening. She is a hero she won't lose! let's just belive in her!<br>You're likely to succceed if you try!</br></br></br>  Okay, prediction time:<br>Yuuna absorbed a part of Leo's soul when she touched the core. She was in coma because of the adjustments in her soul that had to happen.<br>Leo's soul is now sleeping inside her waiting for a trigger to wake it up. I can see two different paths from there:<br>1. Yuuna becomes a combined hero-super-vertex and the final boss, Tougou calls out to her, Yuuna fights within her soul against Leo and wins.<br>2. Leo is actually an observer and messenger and its task is to see what's going on inside of the walls of the Shinju-sama and to assess if they should continue trying to destroy humanity or if the Shinju has a point.</br></br></br></br>  we evangelion now  <br>I'd like the first thing.  Actually as long as Yuuna is fine in the end I'd love any ending I guess. <br>The whole Takashima deal makes all this a bit complicated though. I think because of the <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br>we can assume that Yuuna either has <br>A. The memories of Takashima<br>B. Is Takashima<br>Just being named after her won't work now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God I need these YuYuYu Character songs now.<br>I am in need of healing.</br>  <br>Or may be Takashima   is Leo </br>  <br>Or maybe Takashima got absorbed by Leo, and now both got absorbed by Yuuna.</br>  <br><br><br>It would make a lot of sense that the humans dying within that small world reincarnate over and over again as they have nowhere else to go.<br>I like this idea a lot </br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like the Yuuna unintentionally absorbed Leo as fuel and is slowly becoming a godess theory. As time goes on she is becoming more aware of the past events and her blacking out is the recalling of past events triggered by her immediate surroundings. That play that they put on may have actually occurred word for word in the past.</br>   mfw all the people who got crazy about Yuuna's fainting after ep.12 aired were right after all   Guys, I think we're too naive to thinks that there'll be any scans in the near future. Remember that this is from a Visual Fanbook, not a magazine, not many people are willing to dissect their book to scan it.  <br><br>Makes me wonder why there are no paper-thin flexible scanners. There are paper-thin flexible displays, shouldn't be too hard to create something like that using a combination of microscopic light sources and detectors that basically create a snapshot of the surface they're put on.</br></br>  <br>T-try not to give up ;_;</br>  i need more healing already...  <br>Just gives me incentive to buy the books myself.</br>  I want to fuck Yuuna.  <br>Healing when ;_;</br>  <br>Staying true in her time of struggle, eh?</br>  <br>Alright, here's Yuuki Yuuna 24-hour coverage, edited/retranslated: http://pastebin.com/QpW8Dys6<br><br>Note that the original TLs don't distinguish between Tougou dialogue and Tougou narration - I've left it as is, but if you get confused anywhere let me know.<br><br>Actually, the original translations were a lot worse for this one, reading like a machine translation at times - my favourite parts were the copy-paste definition of 顔パス - "free admission for being well known" and the translation of 国語 as "national language" instead of Japanese. <br><br>Note everyone that this scenario contains the most information about Yuuna's post-recovery status that we get in the VN.<br><br> Tougou: There are still mysteries left, but with everyone, I'm sure... <br> Tougou: I casually raise my head to the sky. <br> Tougou: Since it is noon, the stars aren't visible. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tougou is becoming a stalker.<br><br>Also<br> Tougou: However, did they really return? <br> Tougou: Could it be that we were granted something new...? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn Takahiro! i'm not ready for this!</br>  <br>No need for that, my copy will arrive in about 4 days. If there's still no scans for 2nd translator anon, I'll take up the task myself.<br><br><br> Yuuna's soul (consciousness) fused with Leo and then got taken away as offering. <br> When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br>I can see this happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tougou: ...I let them know about being chosen as an offering. <br> Tougou: However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Tougou: Just being delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>About this part, I think it should be<br> ...My parents knew about me being chosen as offering. <br> However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Just seeing how they're so delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>As seen in Wasuyu, Taisha only hid the truth from the heroes, not their parents so it'd be weird for Tougou to be the one letting them know. Her parents knew the truth and didn't do anything about it, however, seeing how they still truly care about her, she doesn't blame them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Such a mature behaviour from a teenaged girl really strains my suspension of disbelief.<br> Just kidding. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 喜んでくれただけで, which definitely means that the parents are the one's being delighted with Tougou's recovery. I think I intended it to be "Just them being delighted with my recovery is sufficient" but accidentally a word. Sorry.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>However, the "let them know" is correct, 知らされていた definitely implies Tougou imparting the information to her parents.</br>  <br>Wait nevermind, I'm an idiot. The information was imparted to the parents but not by Tougou, you were right.</br>  <br><br>I love Karin</br></br>    <br>She looks like a mix between Sonoko and Wasshi.</br>  <br><br>That's a fucking glorious hairstyle.</br></br>   From Texas. <br> In Cali til August. <br> Just found out Anime Expo exists. <br> Anyone going? <br> Wanna hang? <br> How much yen should I carry? </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>For what?</br>  <br><br> <br>Lol. This thread calling me a loser is like a handicapped child calling me retarded. You want to say something devastating. But you just relent and let them have their win. It's not worth it.</br></br></br>  <br> Anime expo <br>sorry im not a weaboo like you faggot</br></br>    Tomorrow is the final episode/epilogue so I thought I should post this.<br><br>For those who don't know.<br>A artist on twitter by the name of Tsukumo has for every episode since UBW started up in October has posted multiple comics of Saber reacting to watching the UBW anime and Shirou reacting (along with other characters watching it). He was doing it based on what was should happen in the episode based on the VN (So he posted it when it happened live) and everything original in the anime.<br><br>It got really popular on both twitter and pixiv and he even decided to publish it as doujin.<br><br>Going to post all of it from episode 0-episode 24 along with the translated text and Shirou's reaction he posted with it on twitter.<br><br>Hope you enjoy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pls work hard, oniichan~</br>        Thanks OP, I shame we missed it through the season.
