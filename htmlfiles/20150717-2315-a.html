[   Fuck off  <br>bretty gud actually</br>  <br>fuck you</br>  Posting best nee-chan  Best girl.  <br>fuck on</br>  Best girl  <br>literally TALKING:the anime</br>  <br>One of my personal top 10 shows. I loved it.</br>  Kizu never.  The best thing Tarantino has ever made.  Probably had one of the most appropriate and even best endings of all time  <br>Got a couple of artbooks. Shit's so cash.</br>  Where's the yuru thread, yuris?  It died. You didn't protect it while I was sleeping.    <br>6 feet under the ground.</br>  Fucking idiots are gonna get yuru threads banned<br><br>Please fucking behave retards</br></br>  <br>How are we supposed to live without these threads?</br>  <br>I don't care what you do just don't start 4 different threads at the same fucking time and don't complain about the fucking janitors and get us put on the shit list.</br>  All girls are best girl<br> But there's only one true best </br>  <br>So why didn't you post her?</br>  <br>Might as well kill yourself right now.</br>  Does Chinatsu have any redeeming qualities?  <br>good intentions<br><br>and she's cute</br></br></br>  <br> good intentions </br>  <br>True</br>  <br>good intentions no<br>and although she is cute, so is the antichrist<br>cute, seductive and evil</br></br></br>  You have been visited by a oppai demon<br>Cute lesbians and yryr episodes will come to you.<br>But only if you respond with ''Himawari is the best girl''</br></br>  <br>I want to marry Himawari.</br>  <br>We all do</br>  <br>Futanari Himawari is best girl</br>  <br>But anon-san, this is the only thread for yurus at the moment!</br>    <br>Why did her and Akari's personalities almost switch between then and now?</br>  Sadness.  <br>Henshin!<br><br>Anti-bully Rider!</br></br></br>  <br>What turned Kyoko from the  good girl  that she was to what she is today?</br>  <br>Rum raisin.</br>  <br><br>Too late anon</br></br>  Why does Sakurako only have fangs sometimes?  Posting best couple.    <br>her vampire powers allow her to disguise them as regular-length teeth. sometimes she forgets to do so though because's she's sakurako.</br>  Akari is objectively best girl.<br>Look at how fucking cute she is.</br>    <br>kawaii!</br>  I want to hug Yui!  <br>She doesn't have any redeeming qualities, because she needs no redemption.<br>She is small and cute, also have extreme girly charm, and even if she can be a bit of a lustful devil, she isn't evil and loves Akari.</br></br>  <br>She so adorable!</br>  <br><br>Welcome back!</br></br>  <br>I want to hug you!</br>  <br>And sometimes, she has no teeth at all.</br>  <br>Thanks! I love you anon-chan!<br><br><br>Well come here then!</br></br></br></br>  <br>i-i don't think i have any hug images.</br>  <br> Well you shouldn't be so new <br><br><br>How's another thread without triggers going?, afraid people might forget about it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>b-b-b-but i'm not new!!!</br></br>  <br> Then you should save more images </br>  <br> i only save the ones i really like </br>  <br>I'd tear off her cloth starting from that botton on her chest, then I'd block her arms and start licking and kissing her collarbones</br>  <br> So only lewd ones? </br>  <br>o-of course not, hagu-chan!</br>  <br> botton <br>This thing has a spell check</br></br>  <br> Futanari <br><br>What?</br></br></br>    <br>It's a disgusting meme. Pay no attention.</br>  So new season's this fall, yeah?  <br>W-well I'll let you off the hook for today</br>  <br>No. It's cancelled.</br>  <br>That's a shame.</br>  <br>It's also getting two OVAs in the months before.</br>  <br>The knife was disturbing, so i've removed it.</br>  <br><br>Namori is dead anon<br>What are you talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>Two? Excluding Nachuyachumi?</br>  <br>They're called Nachuyachumi+ I believe. But shh, keep it a secret.</br>    <br>Yeah, I downloaded something recently, but haven't watched it.<br>It's an hour long. Is the first OVA an hour long, or is that both of them in one file? Because OVAs are usually like 10-30 minutes.</br></br>  <br>There's just one out at the moment.</br>  <br>That's one hell of an OVA.</br>  <br>s'alright</br>  <br>Watch it, anon.</br>  <br>T-thanks now it just looks like  she ripped out her eyes instead of gouging them out </br>    <br><br> Tittymonster </br></br>  <br>Sakurako a perfect.</br>  <br>Sakurako is so perflat</br>  <br>That's her name. Are you really going to claim that isn't her real name?</br>  <br><br>It's a crime to display those little butts.</br></br>    <br><br>This was so unnecessary. I remember facepalming hard when I first watched it.</br></br>  <br>The real crime would be not displaying Yuru butts.</br>  <br>a-are you okay?</br>  <br> This was so unnecessary. <br> facepalming <br><br>Remind me again, did we call 2010 and ask for their faggots?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ayano's pajamas accentuated her figure so much.</br>  <br>Seemed par for the course. I think sexual fanservice is boring, I just didn't focus on it.</br>  <br>What you say..?</br>  <br>I agree completely.</br>  <br><br>Do you guys possibly prefer dicks in your mouth, perchance?</br></br>  <br>You gay, son</br>  <br>Seeing it as sexual is your own problem. I thought it was a breath of fresh air seeing a bath scene where the characters aren't wearing towels for no reason.</br>  <br><br>I must claim responsibility for the thread's death. I killed it with my terrible Ayano pun. I'm so sorry. I feel so bad Baghdad.</br></br>  <br>p-please stop trying, you're literally worse than Kyouko</br>  <br><br> i didn't get this reaction when i made my flavour pun a few threads ago <br>does this mean i'm funny?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh stop it, Yui. You laughed, we all know it.</br></br>  <br>When they were in the hot tub it was fine, showing them standing around barely covered was unnecessary. The anime also had scenes like this and I didn't mind it because the focus was on something else. Even Chinatsu looking at Yui's back was about Chinatsu rather than Yui. <br>Although Akari having problems both times was funny. The bonk on the head sounded painful.</br></br>  <br>They didn't do the dirty kind of disgusting ecchi, just showed us the girls glorious little body to appreciate it.<br>If you can't, that's your problem.</br></br>  <br>Can't remember sorry<br><br><br> pic related </br></br></br></br>  <br> showing them standing around barely covered was unnecessary. <br>Being in that state of undress is actually pretty necessary for a bathhouse.<br>Excessive steam covering them from the shoulders down, or wearing a towel everywhere even though they're all friends hanging out at a bath would be unnecessary.</br></br></br>  Do these people ever become relevant?  <br>That's not what I mean at all. It's all about camera angles, or whatever the equivalent would be for anime. In  showing so much of the bath detracts from the scene. A close-up or something more dynamic would work better.<br><br><br>Also not what I mean. Scenes like  are a nice detail.<br>Also</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Himawari <br> not Ayano <br><br>Explain, Ukraine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally who<br>  no really who  </br></br>  <br>In a spinoff maybe.</br>  <br>Yuru reset</br>  <br> Futanari Himawari <br>If only</br></br>  <br> showing so much of the bath detracts from the scene. <br>It's not the most interesting shot, I guess, but I don't think it's bad. Honestly I can't think of other ways to handle showing Sakurako pranking Himawari while she's washing her hair that aren't unavoidably ecchi.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128181668 <br>Fine I'm a bit biased because I'm not a pun person, but even I giggle at the grand pun exchange between Yui and Ayano.<br><br>You just need to get better material<br> Take it as a challenge and make me laugh </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not a pun person <br> using exclusively Yui reaction images <br><br>Irony = funny, amirite?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui gotta be kidding me.</br>  <br>That's because I'm a Yuifag, nothing wrong with that.<br><br><br>I chuckled</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you found that funny, you really are full of it Nunavat.</br></br>  <br>Ayano I'm not funny; you don't have to rub it in.</br>  <br><br> it's funny when Ayano exchanges puns with Yui, but not funny if literally everyone else tries the exact same pun scheme <br><br>10/10, I've taken the bait. Tell my parents that I love them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sakurako has NOTHING</br>  <br>When I saw the initial screens I thought I was going to feel the same way, but the actual scene was actually rather funny and tasteful, nothing too overtly lewd about it.</br>  <br>you can't be this retarded, even in the show when Ayano puns Yui laughs like an idiot, when Kyouko puns Yui doesn't even try to pretend it was funny</br>  <br>she has shampoo though???</br>  <br><br> cute girls that get embarassed easily <br> no one bats an eyelash in the OVA about going full nude in front of everyone else <br><br>I don't get it. Does the steam in bathhouses change your brain?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like everyone in Japan is so used to seeing each other naked that body-accentuating clothes are what they find lewd.</br>  <br>It's different for bath houses. In fact bath scene nudity isn't even considered ecchi, and happens even in the most innocent series, becuase nips are used to naked bodies in public baths.</br>  <br>I only called it sexual because another anon said he face-palmed and thought he shouldn't mind it so much. But I did think it was a bit boring, sorry.</br>    <br>I enjoyed the gags that they had in the bathhouse, but humour is subjective. I respect your opinion, anon-chan!</br>  <br><br> "I respect your opinion" <br><br>Am I even on 4chan right now? Where am I?</br></br></br></br>  <br>In a comfy yuru yuri thread.</br>  There's a distinct lack of Chitose art on Pixiv and Danbooru. How sad.  Which Yuru do you think is Namori's favourite?  <br>Akari. That's why she bullies her.</br>  <br>Which Yuru got her own spinoff, anon?</br>    <br>Nadeshiko!</br>  <br> I'd like to think so because Akari is my favourite too. <br><br><br>Honestly I think that indicates that she wanted to show more of Nadeshiko and Hanako than Sakurako being her fave.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Sakurako is my favourite, but she loves Akari-chan so of course I do too!</br>  <br>That always confuses me. I don't think it would matter if I was used to communal bathing or not, if I were in a bath with my crush I would freak out, but it's like that always gets ignored. Octave being a notable exception.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Anyways I think Akari and Sakurako fans have the largest fanbase overlap between any Yurus, so either choice is fine.<br>They are also the two popularity poll winners among nips.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> It's a tie between Best Genkis</br></br>  <br>still mad about the het fling</br>  The OTP  <br>Except Kyoko is actually good at things</br>  <br>Funny anon, now that you mention it I realize that my top three girls are essentially Akari, her developing lover, and her fangirl. Basically Akari is the pillar of my Yuru love and her bestness is what decides who follows her.</br>  <br>Different culture.<br>You see that even lolis get bath scenes for example in anime, while they have a hard time getting any real fanservice, and it's because of that same reason too.<br>Bathhouse nudity is just natural in japan. Unless they take extra efford making it ecchi, it isn't even considered lewd or fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakurako is good at being cute, fun, and beautiful.</br>  <br> Where's the yuru thread, yuris? <br>on /v/<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/v/302810737 </br></br></br>  <br> Still having best girl arguments <br> Still talking about China being a rapist <br>I bet the majority of them have never even made it past 5 chapters of the manga.</br></br></br>    <br>Stay mad. Octave is perfect.</br>  <br>Sakurako is bad and drawing, studying, cooking, and any kind of skill required for a student council member.</br>  <br>There's a distinct lack of Chitose in general.</br>  <br> her developing lover <br>Is that Chinatsu?<br>Just asking because my top three are Akari &gt; Sakurako &gt; Chinatsu.</br></br></br>  <br>I love Octave, but I really do hate how the MC had sex with a dude she didn't know. I don't care that he was a dude, I'd be just as mad if it was a girl. She didn't know the person, and was already in love with a beautiful woman. It makes me sick thinking about what she put herself and Setsuko through.</br>  <br>Her being childish is one of Sakurako's most endearing qualities.</br>  <br>i exhaled through my nose at a faster rate than normal for almost a second</br>  <br>W-we have the exact same best girl order.<br>Can I be your friend, anon-chan?</br></br>  <br>I just want her to be good, but I can't find any redeeming qualities for her.<br><br>Even the spinoff manga doesn't make it all that easier.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's because she's terrible. Setsuko was partially responsible for it as well.</br>    <br>Sure.</br>  <br>It just really broke my heart. Even thinking about it now makes me feel awful  and I kind of want to cry. </br>  <br>Good at what?<br>Like I said, she has many endearing and lovely features.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry anon. tbh it is pretty heartbreaking, for both parties. But at least they discuss it (eventually) and move past it! That's why I actually like it as an aspect of the story. Even though reading it makes you feel like crap.</br>  <br>She and Himawari love each other. Do you really want to ruin that love by changing them?</br>  <br>i don't understand the third from the left in the top row...</br>  <br>I don't feel like Sakurako being less of a useless shit would ruin their love. If anything, Himawari loves Sakurako in spite of her personality most of the time and she honestly deserves more.</br>  <br>Whoever edited the picture is a shit.</br>  <br><br><br>Ren-chon is also some 120-ish cm actually.<br>There was some joke about it that I don't remember exactly, maybe something about the top of her hair gave her extra height.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why beside Koma-chan's height it says "self-proclaimed". Learn to read first.</br>  <br>She's a good cook. She made pancakes. That's about it, I think</br>  Chitose a best  <br>More please. Her and Chinatsu. Those are the two I wish to lewd.</br>    <br>Is it possible to lewd Chinatsu?</br>  <br>Thank you.<br><br><br>I hope so. I mean I like all of them but Chitose and Chinatsu are amazing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, Chinatsu really is quite sensual.</br>  Chinatsu is a satan  <br>Do they have pubic hair?</br>  <br>What went wrong after the first volume?</br>  <br>I like to think they shave/wax, but that's only because I'm a pervert.</br>  <br><br>I think the smaller girls don't have any, or just have weak, silky, hard to notice pubes.<br>Chinatsu is probably smooth as a newborn though.</br></br></br>    <br> Chinatsu is probably smooth as a newborn though </br>  <br>The thought makes me very horny. I really want to feel.</br>  Sakurako is a terrible character and must be removed. Join me at #removesakurako.  <br>They had to evolve past their larval state eventually, anon.</br>  <br>Sakurako is literally the best.</br>  <br>Do not bully the bestest.</br>    <br>She is the best, along with Akari.<br> Chinatsu a close second </br></br>  <br>Please tell me what a smooth Chinatsu's... lewdness feels like, to touch.</br>  I finally fixed Sakurako, guys. Now she's not shit anymore.  its 3am<br>you're half asleep<br>shitposting<br>its raining and theres lightning outside<br>you're home alone<br><br>you turn around as lightning flashes<br>and you see pic related<br>what do</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's a sign</br>    <br>why</br>  <br>I bet about 50% of people posting here are Finnish</br>    <br>My heart.</br>  <br>I'm sorry Saku, please forgive me</br>    <br>At least make the hair blonde too.</br>  <br> suddenly spats <br>I'm sure many people felt betrayed by this. I'm not even a Sakurakofag.</br></br>  <br>Cute.</br>    <br>I don't know, spats are miraculous on firm loli butts, and we at least got an underskirt shot like this.<br>I was quite satisfied.</br></br>  <br>I love spats, though.</br>  <br>What do firm loli butts feel like to touch?</br>  <br>a little surprised by how they came out of nowhere</br>  <br>Firm, I guess?</br>  <br>Once you will have an answer to that, you will know what heaven is like.</br>  <br><br>Describe it for me!!</br></br>  <br><br>But there was no indication whatsoever, given how long the spats actually are.</br></br>  <br>It's true that they were too long, but again we knew already that we won't get pantyshots in Yuruyuri.</br>  <br><br>Well this thread's already lewdbound seeing as everyone's starving for OVA news, so I might as well just leave this old screenshot here.</br></br>  <br>I don't know about that.</br>  The best Yuru    <br>Like nothing because they don't exist</br>  <br><br>Who is this person trying to sneak into the camera shot? I feel like I've seen her before.<br><br>Great picture of Yui, though!</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's  a ghost. </br>  If Sakurako was Russian, she'd be Slavkurako  <br>P U R E S E X<br>U<br>R<br>E<br><br>S<br>E<br>X</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If Himawari was born into Japanese royalty, she would be Himewari.</br></br>  <br><br>If Ayano saw Kyouko kissing Yui, she'd be Cryano.</br></br>  <br>She already saw them kiss. Everyone did.</br>  <br><br><br>ayano pls stay &lt;3</br></br></br>  What are the 5 best episodes? <br>I like the 2 comiket episodes, The childhood adventure, visiting the pool, and the valentines day dates.</br>  <br>If Ayano was a /pol/ poster, she'd be Aryano</br>  <br>Please?</br>  <br>Look at this instead and try to imagine.</br>  <br><br>Not sure about a Top 5, but my 2 favorites are the Field Trip episodes. Genki Kyouko is Best Kyouko.</br></br>  <br>1. Hold your arm out straight.<br>2. Make a fist.<br>3. Touch the top of your arm just before the elbow joint where it's meatiest.<br>4. Imagine that but bonier; even a well toned lolibutt is bony.<br><br>Source: have touched lolibutt.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should touch softer lolibutts too if you think all there is is being bony.<br>It's the silkiest and softest thing ever, unless she is too thin or too athletic.</br></br>  <br>I like my lolis athletic, not fat.<br><br>Allegedly.</br></br></br>  Goodnight, anon-chan-tachi.  <br>In no particular order and because I can't remember well, from S1, 1 and 12<br>From S2, 1, 7 (the sisters ep) and 10 (the second field trip)<br>Hopefully this isn't a mess to read</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good night, Anon-chan. Sleep well, desu-wa!</br></br>  <br>Why does the pajama adhere to her breasts like that?</br>  <br><br>Because Fuck Physics.</br></br>  <br>I compare it to how seeing a girl's pantsu is very lewd but seeing a girl in a bikini is considerably less lewd, even though you're seeing just as much.<br><br>It's all about context - it's normal to be naked in a bathhouse.</br></br></br>  I want to feed brat  <br>Sakurako is so lovely in that particular scene.</br>  Why does everyone pair Akari and Chinashit?<br><br>Akari deserves better than that</br></br>  <br>Yes, she does.</br>  <br>Looks like a mum and her kid.</br>  <br>Because Akari  perforce  learned to love because of her.</br>  <br>Wow how rude.</br>  <br>Chinatsu Self-Defense Force pls</br>  <br> Self-Defense </br>    <br>I  donut  want Akari to get fat.</br>    <br>Why does she laugh at the doughnuts?</br>  <br>cuz they're funny mang</br>  Yui dominates the battlefield  <br><br>Yui-senpai can dominate  me  anytime.</br></br>  Dead thread is Yui thread  <br><br> tumblr <br> gets trips <br><br>Kill me now.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Sakurako-sama, please save us!</br>  <br>God I want to fuck Yui.</br>  <br><br>What anime is this from?

The Sisters episode. The anime finally gets Nadeshiko and Hanako, with Tomoko and Akane finally getting meaningful screen time. Leaves vast possibilities for Season 3.<br><br>#4: Season 2 Premiere. Akari Harem was an absolute classic. Akari deserved an episode like this after all the teasing she had taken. Aside from that, the Ping Pong and Onsen parts were icing on the cake  (that Akari may have eaten) .<br><br>#3: Season 2, episode 3. As someone who ships the OTP of SakuHima, it was very heart-warming to see Sakurako shedding tears over not having Himawari by her side.  Chinatsu a succubus and homewrecker. <br><br>#2: Season 1, Episode 10. The 1st Field Trip with Genki Kyouko at her absolute finest. In my opinion, this is the funniest episode of the anime thus far. My sides were exploding from start to finish.<br><br>#1: 2-way tie  (Deal with it) . Season 1 &amp; Season 2, 11th Episodes. Both episodes portrayed just how much Akari and Kyouko each mean to the series as a whole. I enjoy the YrYr manga &amp; anime for its comedy and "easygoing yuri", not as much for the feels. But I would be lying if I said "neither of these episodes gave me the feels". <br><br>Much like the 11th Episode of Season 1, I needed a good chuckle at the end of Akari's Time-Travel episode to escape from the feels. So it was hard for me to pick one over the other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   page 9 <br><br>Background lesbians to save the thread!</br></br>  <br> Check Bakkin. <br> No new chapter. <br>I hope the mods delete your thread and ban you OP.</br></br></br>  <br>Akari's lack of presence is so great that her right arm's just gone straight through China.<br>Fufufufufu</br></br>  <br> all of the inside hand of the walking couples out of shot <br><br>lewd</br></br></br>  <br><br>Iori, you can stay.<br><br>Yoko, so can you.</br></br></br></br>  sip  fuck off haruhi  fucking slut  fuck you  <br>Fuck you, leather man.

Ryoko did.</br>  <br><br>They both did</br></br>    THE NEW CHAPTER IS OUT!!<br><br>http://readms.com/r/dgrayman/219/28<wbr>65/1</wbr></br></br>  Now suggest Allen a way to successfully kill himself  <br>Oh fuck. I feel a bit for the Millennium Earl. He just wanted his qt 3.14 Noah back</br>  What's wrong with a normal telephone, or even those golem thingys they use for communication.  <br>It's amazing how Hoshino draw expressions. We can immediately tell that's not Allen from that alone.</br>  <br>That looks convenient as fuck for me.</br>  Why is Kubo sabotating every other manga?  YES!<br><br>I thought it was dead, I was so upset. Is it officially off of it's Hiatus?</br></br>  <br>That's because that's actually what she tried to focus on. If i remember there was an an interview where she said the hardest part of drawing Allen was with his facial expressions. To differentiate between his emotions. In that aspect she really earned my respect as a mangaka</br>  <br>Yes, but you only get a chapter every 3 months because I imagine it's hard to fully recover from arthritis</br>  <br> Kubo <br> sabotaging DGM <br>It's impossible</br></br></br>  <br>You're right, that's not enough ink for Kubo</br>  I don't remember a shit about this manga.<br><br> &gt;Alzheimer </br></br>  <br>Hoshino actually pours a lot of black though</br>  <br>It's almost impossible. No matter what he does, Crown Clown will just patch him up.<br><br>It's not like Allen never plans on suicide before. He used to try to slit his throat.</br></br></br>  <br> oh god now I have to take care of these two babies <br> my life is ruined </br></br>  <br>She's not Kubo's level yet.</br>  <br> My husbando turns into babies <br> I never has chance to fuck him </br></br>  OH FUCK WHAT.<br><br>Someone help me here? Last I remember, Apocryphos or whatever the fuck was trying to kill Allen because he has/is the Heart, and Kanda was trying to save Allen for him allowing Kanda and Alma their final moments together.<br><br>Allen is slowly being taken over by Nea, so the Order has officially said 'WELP, guess you aint an Exorcist no more, bye.' And that leads to where we are now where Allen is running from Apoccy and the Earl, right?<br><br>So, yeah, Nea and Mana. What the shit?<br><br>Mana is the Earl? That's where I'm lost, because Mana raised Allen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember absolutely loving the first few arcs then it gradually getting worse until it was completely uninteresting and I stopped reading. How bad is it now?</br>  <br>You missed an entire arc</br>  <br>I don't blame you, it's been almost 2 years and a half years. We might need to write up a main point synopsisfor those who doesn't want to reread. <br><br>Although a reread is a guranteed enjoyable experience..</br></br></br>  <br>Well the current chapter was absolutely amazing and it didn't even have a fight, so that's pretty impressive.</br>  <br> not posting grimmjow's cero </br>  <br>Did I? There's probably something I'm skimming over but not missing, I'd think.</br>  <br>The spreads were fucking amazing, honestly so much of it looked so good.</br>  I cannot put into words how I feel about this chapter.  <br><br>Is that really ink or inverse coloring; white on black paper?</br></br>  <br>That new chapter was interesting and very well drawn. A huge revelation after 2 years of hiatus is always welcome. And now we have to wait 3 months.</br>  <br>Not having a fight is what makes it good, since Hoshino's action scene is terrible</br>  I thought they were gonna snog.  Why was it on hiatus again?  <br>Shonuen Jump are arsenuggets.</br>  <br>arthrisis or something similar. She kept drawing but couldn't keep publishing DGM.</br>  <br>Health issues. She has some kind of chronic. She is doing better now</br>  <br>You misses Searching for A.W arc.<br><br>About Mana is the Earl, it was forshadowed the whole time, like, everytime, since the very begining</br></br></br>  <br>  And now we have to wait 3 months. <br>Fuck, can I do this again? Why did I choose to read this now?</br></br>  <br>Noticed that the big "Earl" part of Mana sunk into his shadow. I guess that explains one mystery, of where the big fat jolly Earl goes off to.<br><br>What a messed up family tree they have. The Earl's lover (presumably) became his mother and his brother became his surrogate son. On top of all that, Mana seems pretty senile. Feel sorry for the guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Ask MS to release 20 pages per month.</br>  <br>Like Volume 1 cover beginning right?</br>  <br>At least it's ongoing now, not in hiatus. If she keeps delivering 60 pages of this quality every Trimester that's good enough for me.</br>  <br>Hoshino's instagram will always be there for you. Just don't shitposting</br>  <br>Ah, no, I skimmed. Searching for AW was what I meant by Kanda going to save him.<br><br>To be honest, and it might of just been the slow updates, but that arc was slow and tedious as fuck. But I did love me some Yuu.<br><br>But also I hope this Mana is the Earl thing gets cleared up soon, I want to know just how the fuck Mana would raise Allen only to want to murder him later.<br><br>Or maybe that's just it. Maybe the Earl raised Allen as Mana, as he forgot about Nea but felt automatically drawn to Nea with Allen. But then again, the Earl was around as Allen went to be an Exorcist, so... I don't know.<br><br>I'm confused as shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> one chapter every 3 months <br> but its a 60 page chapter <br>i'm entirely alright with this.</br></br></br>  <br>Not only that</br>  We seriously need that light novel OVA adaption for this  <br>Mana is batshit insane all the time. Allen knows but never says anything</br>  <br>nah the next chapters will be shorter iirc</br>  <br>I like how Allen has grown.<br><br>I forget why his hand is all nasty, even though he lost it and then it came back as a sword-hand deal.</br></br></br>  <br>HOSHINOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.</br>  <br>The chapter Lavi returns has fairly the same amount of pages to chapter 219</br>  <br>So is the Earl just staying and raising Allen as Mana, and then fucking off to go be a Noah as Earl constantly, do you think?</br>  <br>that's probably true, but someone explained that the regular chapter size equals that of a mothly serialised chapter, so in the long term the chapters will be shorter than wwhat we got now</br>  <br>Mana didn't even think he was raising Allen. He mistood Allen with his dog.</br>  <br>Oh shit. So aye, pretty much senile.<br><br>How the fuck did he manage to handle being the Earl?</br></br></br>  <br>basically the earl is insane and clearly has some weird issues between being human/noah, so i think he sort of flip flops and is thus insane.<br>this is how allen grew up.<br>also the earl isn't even the full version of him,self, hes like half a millenium earl.<br>its kind of goofy shit.</br></br></br></br>  Are there any Viz/CR rips or something of this?  Still Gay as fuck.  So the earl is nea?  <br> But also I hope this Mana is the Earl thing gets cleared up soon, I want to know just how the fuck Mana would raise Allen only to want to murder him later. <br>The Earl seems unaware that he IS Mana. So maybe the time when the "Earl" we knew showed up to killed Nea, Mana hadn't yet properly awakened. When Mana finally "died" and Allen was grieving for him, that was when Mana truly awakened as the Earl and lost the memories of who he was.</br></br>  <br>earl got split between nea and mana<br>mana was already awoken by the time allen was growing up<br>mana as the earl is an unstable batshit insane fuck<br>so both of them have the same damn powers, in addition nea now has ahold of allens hand.<br>so theres that.</br></br></br></br></br>  Remember when akuma were relevant? Well...  <br>This reminds me, allen made mana an akuma. That makes no sense if the earl was mana.</br>  <br>Maybe... still confused to shit.<br><br>Here's hoping Kanda comes in soon to stab the Earl and kiss his Allen-waifu.<br><br><br>Also this is what I recall, as well...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate what this did with akuma. The level 4 leveled the main base, and then after that it seems like level 4's were just normal shits to be delt with. Wasnt that level 4 the first thy ever saw too?</br>  Honestly, the Earl being Mana makes a lot of things click together nicely. Which freaks me out.<br><br><br> Here's hoping Kanda comes in soon to stab the Earl and kiss his Allen-waifu. <br><br>Stop posting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Level 4's were shit anyway.<br><br>Level 1's are retarded balloon-guns.<br><br>Level 2's are based as they take on different looks that actually look good or interesting.<br><br>Level 3's were alright with their Knight appearance but still bland and samey.<br><br>Level 4's are creepy fucking baby-looking cherub fucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Honestly, the Earl being Mana makes a lot of things click together nicely. Which freaks me out. <br><br>What clicks? There are some things I can think of, but nothing that startles.</br></br></br>  <br>Yah I'll agree how level 4's lost their originality. I never noticed level 3's had a knight theme though.</br>  <br>I would explain if it wasn't 4:04 in the morning and my brain hadn't entirely checked out by now. But it made a lot of fucking sense when I first read it.<br><br>Though I'm still wondering about the first akuma that Allen killed that was supposed to be Mana.</br></br></br>  <br>What I can think of is why the earl didnt kill allen when he made "mana" an akuma, something the earl noted himself. Also why they have the same sword.</br>  Looking pretty good. Let's hope the quality doesn't drop. I'm already looking forward to the next one.<br>3 months between chapters is pretty long, though.</br>  <br>Oh! The sword, right.<br><br>I don't think the Buster suits the Earl. Never did.<br><br>I just see it more at home on Allen, but that's likely because I'm used to my skinny anime pretty boys that wield the massive sword.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think of it as something to look forward to during midterms.</br>  <br> Let's hope the quality doesn't drop <br>You mean it hasn't already</br></br>  I don't even remember what the fuck is happening anymore.  Damn, D.Gray-man?<br><br>I remember discovering this when my Weeabo of a mate was watching the episode where Krony becomes a bloody mess in the Iron Maiden, and that got me interested as to what was happening.<br><br>And then I saw Allen dancing about with his one arm and a sword, and I was interested in thinking that there was a soldier that fought with a handicap.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering that the Earl and Mana were able to act as separate entities, maybe the Earl represents the Noah part of him and, even after Mana died and had his soul stuck in an Akuma doll, was able to continue acting on his own? Then, after Allen destroyed the doll, Mana's soul was reunited with the Earl?<br><br>I mean, the Noah with the 3rd eye seems to consider "Wisely" as a separate person. He mentions something about not letting Wisely take him over, which seems similar to the time when Tyki went into a berserk state when Joido took over his body.<br><br>The Noah memory reawakens in a new person whenever the last person who carried and awakened to the memory died. Their souls transmigrate between bodies, but they don't kick out the original soul that inhabited the body. At least, that's what I think.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it's pretty good now.<br><br>On a side note, does anyone think we'll see a new adaptation in the future?</br></br></br>  <br> I never noticed level 3's had a knight theme though. <br>Huh, really? That seemed pretty self-evident, though.<br><br>Anyway, yeah. Level 4's have nothing unique about them at all. At least with the level 3's, they had their unique techniques, but the level 4's just seem like typical brutes/next-level mooks.</br></br></br></br>  What has to be done to make Sakura more popular?  <br><br><br>If you want see glimpse of "Matou Rin" personality then you read Rin's eclipse in Hollow Ataraxia. Here at nearly end Rin for a moment becomes completely mindbroken from all pleasure and even develop Sakura-like dull eyes. This is how "Matou Rin" would be if you get on her Dere side.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Underrated post.</br>  <br>this whole scene is so much better than her usual self.</br>  <br><br>Well, they are sisters by blood.<br>Ironically, the Rin mistakenly thought the future dere Rin was Sakura.</br></br></br>    MIKI A CUTE<br><br>A CUTE</br></br>  <br>already a thread<br/></br>  Shovel×Miki OTP  <br>Ignore this, I'm just retarded</br>      <br>I seriously doubt something that costs millions of dollars is expendable, especially one that is invaluable in rescue missions. Not to mention how hard it would be to acquire another one when it's Hell on Earth. There's something fishy.</br>  <br>Dem thighs.</br>  <br>Every single panel featuring the pilot suggest that he is on a solo mission. This makes little sense for a multitude of reasons if they were on a retrieval mission and had non-fucked amounts of manpower. Helicopters aren't really disposable either, nor are people that can fly them.<br><br>Was it clear that they actually developed the disease? The levels of preparation might also suggest a more Fallout-ish scenario - somebody is aware of the possible threat and is building shelters and handing out survival manuals. An evil corporation wouldn't just hand out confidential, sealed documents to a freaking teacher. The chance of them getting leaked would be too high.<br><br>I think I'll just stop speculating and enjoy the ride. There's barely any info given to us regarded the whole mess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a good chance they developed it. There's a lot of cryptic background notes about chemicals in the water, and a past incident where half the population just disappeared. However, it doesn't mean they're totally evil. Corporations are made of people. The ideologies of the company itself might be evil, but there's often a good conscious keeping it from going full tilt. Like with Google.</br>    <br>The costs are nothing compared to a more valuable, healthy person. Healthy manpower can build shit like those, damn the expense as we are in an emergency situation.<br>Also, transport choppers are cheaper compared to attack choppers which would have been escorting the chopper if it was a rescue mission. Plus more guys on it loaded for bear. But judging from the suitcase of the pilot, it really looked like it is just a routine collection</br></br>  <br>It does make sense to send an infected pilot alone if you send them at all, though. Infection symptoms and bitefights in the cockpit don't sound particularly good no matter how many guys you brought.<br><br>Ideally you'd want non-infected, healthy pilots, but maybe they don't have enough of them to spare. Or risking them for this mission is too much of a liability.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I think too. It seems weird for a truly malicious corporation to take so many measures to ensure the well-being of the people they supposedly intend to use as test subjects.<br><br>They still likely developed the virus but they also clearly didn't want things to get too bad in case of an outbreak. They knew things could go horribly wrong and took measures to attempt and minimize the damage in case it did.</br></br></br>   tfw the biker bros were just trying to warn the group the dangers of the people in the Uni, but are too jaded by the apocalypse to approach them in a friendly way   <br> skindentation <br><br>This mangaka needs to do porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they just heard the racket and came running with baseball bats, not knowing what to expect. The girls pretty much just ran away at first glance on them.</br>  <br>I would love to see a bunch of random army grunts with no education in engineering build a chopper from scraps. It's not about money, it's about helicopters being limited as fuck.<br><br>The other thing that is expensive and rare are pilots. Everybody can be trained to be a soldier in an emergency. WW2 is a good example of that. Give a man a gun, train him in using it and let him run at the enemy. Cheap and disposable. A pilot on the other hand requires years of expensive training and not everybody is suited for the job, especially if it is a combat pilot. Expensive, limited, and have to be responsible for not getting everybody around and under them killed.<br><br>Now, in a zombie apocalypse manpower obviously becomes MUCH more valuable and even a grunt isn't something you could just toss away, but the same thing applies to pilots. If they were limited and expensive before now they are worth their weight in solid gold.<br><br>The odd thing about this is him being infected tho.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one word they said here translates to stop, but literally means "stand still". However, this isn't the original, so it could've been a loose translation from Japanese as well.</br>  <br>Why is a boy wearing garters.</br>  <br>Don't be mean to Miki.</br>  <br>You have manual labor though. Better to have healthy persons build shit than infected ones that can cause delays.<br>And that is the point. He was infected and it would be more prudent to send him than a healthy pilot. He is good as lost if there was no cure and sending an infected on a potentially high risk area is acceptable. Besides, it is just basic flying not ACM which requires time. Even a civvie can land a plane with instructions from control tower alone. I do not think it would take that time to train someone just to fly around and look for things. Combat pilots are the ones that take time.</br></br>  <br>You are a faggot for making me post in the wrong thread.<br><br>Phone posting so no images. The pilot was most likely Ground JSDF because of the helicopter and gear: UH-1 Huey, Sig P220 pistol and that type 88 helmet. The gas mask I got no idea, but the rest is standard issue for ground force. The other branches don't use the huey.</br></br></br>  <br> boy </br>  <br>If it is JSDF, does that mean Japan is fucked?</br>  <br>Sending him by helicopter seems a bit weird though. Let's assume he's as good as done for, but gets selected / volunteers for a rescue / sample collection mission. Would you really give him a helicopter that he could potentially crash and kill everybody around him? This would be especially true if he was sent to exterminate the girls and bring the samples back (if it was a case where they needed survivors dead at any cost they would send a squad of healthy men).<br><br>Why not just send him by car or let another guy fly him in. The car would take time, but he'd eventually get there with a much lower risk of losing something valuable or getting people killed. Unless all comms are dead he could call in a chopper after he makes sure they are fine if he was there to rescue the girls.<br><br><br>If the JSDF sends a single infected man with just a single handgun in a single chopper for 3 girls it dun look too good to me. At the very least it is wide-spread. Otherwise there would be search choppers all over the place. Japan isn't exactly poor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> boy <br>I love this meme.</br></br>  <br>Probably because it will take time? Let us also assume while he is planning to take samples, it might also include getting the girls out of there ASAP. You do not want the subjects to turn before you can get the samples while they are still human aftet all.</br>  Any /tg/ drawfags here? Somebody needs to draw Kurumi in Nurgle Chaos Space Marine armor wielding a Chain-Shovel. It needs to happen  <br> chain-shovel <br>Fund it.</br></br>  <br>Also no point of having another pilot fly him, moreso if pilot is healthy. If one man can do the job then that is enough.<br>Let us also assume that while he may seem expendable, they do not want to lose him or the chopper as much as possible because he would be still useful flying more missions. Now probably due to the nature of the mission, he was considered an acceptable loss if things do not proceed as planned.</br></br>  <br>Somebody post a high-res pic of Kurumi with her Shovel, I'll try it.</br>  <br>Then why use a corpse-candidate as a pilot if speed and reliability are important? Either everybody involved is disposable or not. <br><br>It makes sense sending an infected if it is a low-priority mission, but you wouldn't give him a chopper unless everybody else that can use it is already dead or there's way too many lying around for the amount of people that can use them. You don't half-ass in an apocalypse.<br><br>I'm starting to think that Japan is simply fucked and this was some desperate mercy mission or something. Get them out or at least give them a clean death, but there was nobody else to send so they went with the infected pilot. I mean, the letter was hella cute.<br><br>Since the syringes weren't clearly visible they may have been with a little bit of serum in them or empty. Markers on the map may have been known safe-zones.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I suppose it could make sense. This also means that Japan is fucked tho.</br>  <br>Chopper is probably written off as an acceptable loss. Anything to get there immediately depending on the mission, just not attack choppers or Chinooks if the JSDF are operating them. They are more important than Hueys</br>  Oh shit.  stronk  <br>Best one I could find.</br>  Goddamn Kurumi unf  <br>Seems like a normal spade.</br>  <br> Best girl polishing her rod </br>  <br>Rii really was depending on Yuki so looking back I can see why she got so angry.</br>  <br>It's anything but normal if it hasn't broken after months of heavy usage.</br>  <br>She got experience in maintaining wood.</br>  <br>Maybe she  replaces it. </br>  <br> Was Miki trying to wake up Yuki by just showing the zombies up close and what they are? Miki is kinda mean hearted, but not wrong about Yuki's personality yet kinda going the wrong way about it.  </br>  Bike, bike, as fast as you can<br>You can't get caught by the Magic God, man.<br><br>Chapter 2, 3/16 parts translated by js06:<br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_2</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's a LOT of collateral damage</br>  Last thread <br> GcUKb19e </br>  ,126<br> “(Wow… We’re on a bike together. I’m riding a bike with a boy! Eh? Eh? What’s going on here? This isn’t a drama and it isn’t a movie. O-oh, no. If I’d known this was going to happen, I’d definitely have worn a white dress. Ahh…)” <br> “Um, Misaka-san?” <br> “Ah!!!???” <br> Mikoto had been speaking her strange ramblings aloud, but she rebooted a moment later. <br> “Ny-nyothing!! And what is that thing!? Is it alive or is it a stuffed animal with a robot skeleton inside!?” <br> “It’s probably alive. But getting caught by it is a really bad idea!!” <br> Even if the anti-crime orientation was underway, they were lucky it was a weekday. <br> Eighty percent of Academy City’s residents were some kind of student. <br> Even if the city streets were their stage, the odds were much lower that anyone else would be caught up in all this as the High Priest pursued them. <br> Mikoto tried to understand the situation using the severely inadequate information available to her. <br> First, she looked behind them. <br> “So that’s the enemy.” <br> “Right.” <br> “He’s trying to harm us.” <br>“&gt;I think that’s pretty obvious!”<br> “Then what exactly are we going to do!? If we do nothing, he’ll harm us, but if we keep running around, there’s a chance some unrelated people will get caught in the middle!!” <br> “!!” <br> (Yeah, that’s right, dammit. We have to do something!!) <br>Cute.<br><br> They could achieve supersonic speeds with their own body, so what would happen if someone set up piano wire and escaped using countless sharp turns? It might not apply to all Saints, but at least a few of them would self-destruct by decapitating themselves or flattening themselves against a wall. The Saints pushed themselves and pushed themselves further to draw out their strength, so using their physical bodies to their fullest was a way of triggering their own self-destruction. It almost made one suspect that the greatest threat to a Saint was their own strength and not some external enemy. <br>Kamachi nerfing Saints?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't need to nerf them when everything else is way above already.</br>  <br>Meant to quote .

That’s dangerous.”<br><br>He sounded entirely unconcerned.<br><br>At the same time, the ground split open again and another giant arm burst out.<br><br>It pulled up another building and responded to the iron sand sword.<br><br>He did it all as casually as someone grabbing a chair or fire extinguisher when a suspicious person entered the school. That was all it took for him to use a building full of dozens or even hundreds of people like a disposable tool.<br><br>“This guy!!” roared Mikoto after she unintentionally slammed her whip-like iron sand sword into the building.<br><br>The High Priest did not seem to care.<br><br>“Now then, young lady. There are a number of ways to save people.”<br><br>“Kh.”<br><br>“The people inside this building will die without pain or fear, not knowing what happened to them. Isn’t that one form of salvation?”<br><br>As he spoke, the High Priest grabbed more and more buildings and threw them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not even Mikoto could hold back all of this. She focused her powers on saving lives by pulling water pipes and rebar from the buildings as cushions that were meant to be broken through, but it was unclear how long she could keep it up. She tried to stop and support the buildings while fighting to prevent the “contents” from being crushed, but more and more buildings were piled on top.<br><br>She could not say just how many people would be crushed inside if she made a single mistake.<br><br>(Not good! If this keeps up, I’ll be crushed underneath it all!!)<br><br>“Dammit!!”<br><br>Mikoto suddenly swung her iron sand sword, but not to attack the High Priest.<br><br>She cut into the ground below his feet and sent him falling into the subway tunnel below.<br><br>“Ho?”<br><br>The mummy actually laughed.<br><br>He sank down with the calm of an old man delightedly and intentionally falling for the pitfall his first grandchild had made.<br><br>The dozen or so seconds this gave Mikoto allowed her to somehow use her magnetism to set down the pile of buildings. <br><br><br>Nice feats here. So how strong do you guys think Mikoto's magnetism is?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This guy!! <br>js06, I hope the original phrase wasn't こいつ.

The mummy priest cracks me up though</br>  <br>Agreed, Touma knowing full well that even running from High Priest is useless and yet still pulling all this sort of shit on him while he just yells "Uho hoi!" slays me</br>     mikoto calling herself a monster <br> thinking she can beat an enemy that touma is running from <br>her pride must be at an all time high</br></br>   yfw Touma will never garotte you   Could accel beat high priest at his current level?  <br>No</br>  <br>Considering High Priest isn't even trying and is fucking around it's impossible to say</br>  <br><br>Nyaro~</br></br>  <br> thinking she can beat an enemy that touma is running from <br>Well to be fair, she can probably take on America.</br></br>  Best Magic God.  <br>All Level 5s are monsters though, so it's not not an empty boast.</br>  <br>What</br>  <br><br>Holy shit. Is Zouken on meth now? He looks even worse.</br></br>  <br>He set the bar way to high for nyang and nephy.

Second is her in dere mode.</br></br>  <br> So how strong do you guys think Mikoto's magnetism is? <br><br>She's a level 5 doing level 5 things. If anything's surprising its her capacity to multitask to that degree. The more Kamachi writes about her the more embarrassing Nagai's anime adaption looks in retrospect.</br></br></br>  I want to get off from Mr. High Priest wild chase.  <br>I chuckled.</br>  <br> Othinus is comparable to Sakura </br>  <br>Nagai Space is a sin.</br>  <br> thinking she can beat an enemy that touma is running from <br><br>To be fair, she stands a better chance than him against any foe that doesn't rely entirely on an ability.</br></br></br>  <br>Misaki is Xavier</br>  <br>The fact that Saints and people on their level can exchange blows at all with their level of strength and not be instantly killed would point towards Saints having durability to match up with the rest of their capabilities.</br>  Mikoto in action is always good, but I dread the inevitable shitpostings from you-know-who.  <br>Rape worms when?</br>  <br>She is.

Bitch. </br></br>  <br>Why do you think Arrow Head Comet was mentioned? there's no escape.</br>  <br>If Mikoto can't beat him, then throwing him into the sun definitely wouldn't work. Could Accel accurately chart a course to the nearest black hole and try that?</br>  <br>Come on, anon. Let's not start that. We're trying to have a decent thread for once this week.</br>  <br>So it's retarded to think she deserves to die for what she did? Okay, waifushit.</br>  <br> "(Friction doesn’t work, busting his head open with a sign doesn’t work, Anti-Skill’s bullets and shells don’t work, and strapping him to a helicopter rotor and slamming him into the ground at over 1000 rpm doesn’t do a thing!! It all seems so surreal, but I guess a Magic God really is a Magic God. Even a Saint or member of God’s Right Seat tries to protect themselves from an attack coming their way. Even the #1 deflects the attacks. But this guy doesn’t do anything to defend himself! So how am I supposed to reach his level!?) <br><br><br>OKAY. WHO THE FUCK TAUGHT TOUMA ALL THESE SHIT<br><br>THATS DANGEROUS NIGGA</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean one death is not hard enough punishment here.</br>  <br>So Shirou = Katze?</br>   absolutely powerful Magic God chasing Touma <br> it turns into a comedy scene <br> I love you Kamachi</br></br>  <br>He probably experienced some of those things during his time with Othinus.<br><br><br><br><br>Go away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe? I'm a huge Accelfag but I don't see him being able to much of anything against this guy anymore than Mikoto</br>  <br> several people probably dead <br> comedy <br>it is pretty funny though</br></br></br>  <br>I was under the impression quite a number of people were dead.</br>  <br>  vectors of magic <br>  vectors of divinity <br>High Priest got no chances here</br></br></br>  So... Why Touma can't be just mediator but without bullshit mikotofishes swimming around.  <br> Touma doing all dem bike stunts <br> High priest fucking around <br> Misaka going magneto <br>Wow<br>just<br>Wow</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was always under the impression he CAN deflect or learn to deflect anything, but if it's bullshit enough, he has to learn it, but if said bullshit can one shot him, it's over regardless</br>  <br> infinte power <br> immune to any kind of physical damage <br> Accelerator can't do anything to him, nigger takes a shit on logic.</br></br></br>  <br>When has anyone every tried to negotiate with Touma in good faith? He's wised up to that shit by now, I believe.</br>  <br> Check Google <br> There are no mutants with vector powers <br>Seriously, Marvel?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>A twenty-story building and a few more building stacked on top of that? That level of magnetic field strength should easily be Saints tier Mikoto's body may not be Saint tier, but her abilities sure are. In a way, she's is like Asuka from Mondaiji. Great ability, but her body is a weakness for being human.</br></br></br>  <br>Touma seems use to all of this</br>  <br>Misaka really needs to get her awakened wings already. Come on Kamachi, make it happen.</br>  <br><br> (? Oh, I get it. They were all chasing after Tsuchimikado and me, so were they all gathered to one side of the building? That means they might not all be dead yet!!)  <br><br>Touma has seen so much shit that a few dozen deaths don't even phase him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  check 4chan <br>  there are no espers with scalar powers <br>Seriously, Kamachi?</br></br></br>  <br> scalar  <br> Working against black-winged Accelerator </br></br>  <br>Well Uiharu controls temperature sort of. If my Grade 12 science isn't failing me that's a scalar</br>  <br>Guessing this is where her character arc that has started at the end of this novel will lead to.</br>  <br>I bet he saves Nuit Mode Mikoto for last volume</br>  <br><br>So much suffering.</br></br>  <br>Yeah this seems to confirm Mikoto is stronger than previously assumed. She's still not enough to deal with a Magic God. I agree with </br>  <br>Temperature = Speed of Molecules = Vector</br>  <br> Speed <br> Vector </br></br>  <br>Yeah I think we'll be seeing more Mikoto soon and she'll go through something that will give her her wings</br>  Anyone else just waiting until the translation is finished?  <br>How is speed not a vector?</br>  <br>Hard to wait when people drop exciting excerpts in these threads.</br>  <br> "Meanwhile, Kamijou held a thick wire in his hand. <br><br> He had borrowed it from the side of a crushed armored vehicle. As soon as he landed, he threw the end toward the High Priest so it would loosely wrap around the mummy’s neck. <br><br>Savage as fuck, i guess nt9 wasnt just for naught.</br></br></br></br></br>   Uho hoi <br> The people inside this building will die without pain or fear, not knowing what happened to them. Isn’t that one form of salvation?  <br> Uho hoi <br>I wonder how I describe my feeling for this charactor.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Mikoto STRONK. This novel is shaping up to be great already.</br></br></br>  <br>She is likely the Accelerator of NT for the 2nd half of the series. As in one of the big character arcs.</br>  <br>She was always strong. Just run some numbers. Billion volts contain enough energy to destroy hundred B-52 at once.</br>  <br>Agreed. I think she'll shift away from Touma, though.</br>  <br> go through something that will give her her wings <br>Yes please. I'd throw all of my money at Kamachi to make this happen.</br></br>  <br>There's going to be a hell of a shitstorm when we reach THAT scene.<br> &gt;BTFO BTFO ship has sunk etc <br><br>Though if I read the spoilers and screenshots right, that part is actually something we've been waiting for a long time. A wake up call.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at it this way:<br>To be approached for negotiation is to be considered a threat. Otherwise, you would've already been coerced.<br><br>Touma's already realized that someone getting him to accept power will never be just because. They would've just dumped it on him.</br></br></br></br>  Just for fucks, Kamachi should give Mikoto electric spider legs.  <br>That scene is literally nothing. All it's going to do is motivate Mikoto to get stronger than she already is. Her personality will never let her give up.</br>  <br>  mfw instead of this mikoto will die </br>    <br>Reminder that vectors are whatever Accel wants them to be and that anything involving movement on a molecular level counts.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's why I said it's a wake up call. Now she knows exactly what Toums is up against, she's had a taste of the enemy's power, and she'll try to improve. Granted she probably won't get anywhere until Crowley greenlights it but still.</br>  <br>Reminder the question wasn't about Accel but if any espers had scalar powers</br>  <br>We all know that status quo end is inevitable. No girl is going to end up with him. Point side, Mikoto's ship hasn't sunk yet at all in NT13 if I'm reading spoilers right. Touma didn't reject her or sunk any flags that would prevent Mikoto from chasing after him. Misaka had a wake up call in seeing how she wasn't able to be useful in the way she wanted to (against a Magic God no less). So she realized the distance between Touma and herself in that regard. This basically should open up some plot for her to grow stronger so she can provide greater help beyond what she has done for him already.</br>  <br> electric spider legs. <br>Why? What would that even look like any ways?</br></br>  <br> tfw peaceful touma at rest ending will never happen </br>  <br>I do think the ship's over but I don't hate Mikoto nor am I going spam BTFO BTFO TSUNSHITS BTFO because I'm not a hater. However, I do think this opens up Mikoto for good development even if she doesn't get her ship. I think it will bring her into the plot rather than having her as a one sided love interest</br>  <br><br>Imagine a daddy long legs. With legs protruding from the back made of electricity.</br></br>  <br>She has long since realized that Touma doesn't return her romantic feelings, she just doesn't give a fuck. All she wants to do is help him in any way she can. That's why she's probably going to get stronger(hopefully wings) or some other enhancement of her power.<br><br> You don’t need a good reason to save a friend. If you want to save them, then save them. …I know someone who kept saying those stupid things even when he was driven to the brink of death, and he really did save over 10,000 people in the end. And that idiot that saved so many people is trying to save someone today like always. I know I can’t stop him. No matter how much I don’t want him to do anything dangerous, seeing him off with a push to the back is the sign of a good woman! </br></br></br>  <br> die <br>I don't think Kamachi is suicidal, anon.<br><br><br>But electric wings that crackles and produces biribiribiri sound is much cooler.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  scalar powers </br>  <br>When will Misaka ever be inform about magic? I swear to God she needs to fucking know already.</br>  <br><br> Touma dies <br> his friends and family decide to send him off beautifully <br> lay his body on a coracle and heap it high with flowers <br> Index and Mikoto push it out to the river with tears streaming down their faces <br> Touma peacefully floats down the river <br> coracle suddenly sinks <br> Touma comes back to life because MAGIC <br> almost dies again anyway because drowning <br> fruit cola </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> electric wings <br>but kazakiri already exist</br></br>  <br>I find it kind of hilarious how adding friction to the air is supposed to stop mechs in their tracks, Accelerator's author is worse at science than Kamachi</br>  <br>Wait... She doesn't know? She was literally told x told about it twice and fought magicians and even Magic God.</br>  <br>Iron sand wings that crackle with electricity?</br>  <br>That's not allowed. Level 5s have the most exposure to magic, but all of them are going to remain quite ignorant about it. They represent SCIENCE, so mixing magic is something Kamachi won't do.</br>  <br>She's been informed, she's just really stupid about these things.</br>  <br>How it isn't supposed to work like that?</br>  <br>but anon if she knew anything about magic she wouldn't try to fight HP and we would be deprived of this scene.</br>   people talking about Mikoto getting wings <br><br>We already saw her angel mode, she gets swordlimbs. Wings are Accel/Kakine's thing,</br></br>  <br>the moth stuff looked better than shit.</br>  <br>Well think about it, if it was he ground it'd be fine but making the air have friction is only going to make the air molecules not slide over things, so sure they stick to the mech instead of slipping past it but it's not reasonably going to be enough mass or force to stop it especially within a half meter or so I would imagine</br>  <br>  Accel/Kakine <br>  implying they will be relevant again </br></br>  <br>Add four more limbs and have crawling on the ground and she's a spider.</br>  <br>Kakine, sure. But Accelerator will always be relevant</br>  What if Mikoto awakens into a giant headcrab?  <br> implying Kakineball won't come back and try to roll over 15cm Othinus like the boulder trap in Indiana Jones </br>  <br> yfw accel has only been relevant one time in the last seven volumes </br>  <br><br> spider <br> headcrab </br></br></br>  <br>I have imagined Misaka's wings might be similar to Hyouka's electric wings. Since Hyouka is an amalgamation of AIM, she should be drawing powers from countless Espers. Her electric wings might be a result of an accelerated wing form of an Electromaster.</br>  <br>It's so stupid, though. Can't we have a story where the characters win by their wits rather than brute force power ups? Mikoto did well against the magic god if you look at it through the lens of preventing a much larger body count of innocent bystanders. I've never had a personal beef with her for not being able or willing to kill her opponents. But for some people that's the entire measure of a character's worth.</br>  Can a magic god survive Touma exploding into dragons? I feel like this should happen.  <br>well iirc she can only go angel mode by putting LO in a coma so it is probably a electromaster/sisters thing.</br>  <br> NT6, NT7 (well sort of), NT10 <br>I count two and a half</br></br>  <br><br>Oh anon. What is your fascination with electric and spider legs? Just curious cause spiders are seriously creepy  and I'm scared of them. </br></br>  <br>Othinus effortlessly beat invisible thing, so probably.</br>   we will never see the full extent of these dragons and no they are shit tier   <br>You can't really outwit magic god.</br>  <br>As fun as his stint in NT10 was it was pointless. Every level five turned the job down before he started and mikoto went any way. but as guess it still counts with NT6. He only had one scene in NT7 didn't he? Just beating up fake heroes.</br>  <br> Night sky, stars, and space are reflected of her body <br><br>I always love that sort of thing. You generally see that sort of thing from cosmic beings, which is always cool and a show of being powerful.</br></br></br>  <br>Does she not get any props for being the go to character when there's a science mystery to crack? I bet most magic side characters wouldn't understand anything about AIM diffusion fields or quantum theory.</br>  <br>Crowley, and ollerus did.</br>  <br>Does it matter? Magic God &gt; Dragons.</br>  <br>The air surrounds every last inch of it, though. It's like being bound to the ground with ropes; you wouldn't have enough free movement to create the force necessary to break them.</br>  <br> I bet most magic side characters wouldn't understand anything about AIM diffusion fields or quantum theory. <br>Nor a number of Science side characters, for that matter.</br></br>  <br>Without it we would t have had a scene from the Will, which I think was the point.</br>  <br>It takes another Magic God/Magic God candidate to do that.</br>  <br><br>If you've ever seen an electroball, I kind of imagine Mikoto's awakening to look similar. The body (the ball) and the wisps that attach to any near surface ( in this case the ground ). WIth that in mind, it would sort of look like a spider.</br></br>  <br> a mortal outwitting a immortal <br><br>Nice try anon, but that isn't going to happen</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the will scene was in NT6</br>  <br>Put it this way, stuff entering the atmosphere from space is in the same situation, but it'll make it a lot farther than half a meter before burning up, there is simply not enough air there to stop it that quickly.</br>  Reminder that Fiamma&gt;Magic Gods. Fiamma could also beat anti-Touma since he isn't a magic god.  <br>  ollerus <br>He was actually failure from day one</br></br>  <br> You generally see that sort of thing from cosmic beings <br><br>Well, yeah, that's what she was turning into.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the literal description of Nuit in the Thelemic belief system. Plus OT volume 3 had a reference to loli Mikoto aspiring to create a body of stars of her very own.</br>  <br>Fiamma is the new Stiyl so no.</br>  <br>What if there were more dragons? Like 7 more?</br>  Who would win? A magic god? Or a billion fire ants?  <br>There was one in NT10, which "reminder that Lo and Worst's feelings for Accel are fake" anon ignores (or he's just trolling)</br>  <br>We never saw the full extent of them though.<br>Why is kamachi such a bad writer?</br></br>  <br>No way. Fiamma is world tier at most. Magic Gods are universal and are from a higher dimension to beyond the beyond.</br>  <br>That leaves only asspulls and DBZ level bullshit to bring closure to any real conflict. I hope you guys seriously aren't hoping for this. My standards are a bit higher than that.</br>  <br>Fiamma is this guy who keeps upgrading his top PC but doesn't play anything except five years old games.</br>  <br><br><br>Rather than actually compressing the air, her ability is changing that actual frictional coefficient, so that they could theoretically have an unlimited friction value. Ie, all kinetic energy is turned into waste energy very quickly regardless of what kind of material is invovled.</br></br></br>  <br>Magic Gods are world tier too. Thats the point.</br>  <br>I know. That's in part what makes it so cool.<br><br><br>Foreshadowing or not, I don't think FC Mikoto is going to happen again. Nuit probably won't be realized either. The best I hope for is Mikoto getting her awakened wings.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To outwit magic god you need to know how magic works or at least their mentality. Mikoto lacks both.</br>  <br>But she said it was only being applied to the air, and the mech was already moving, so to stop it that quickly even if you're going to say "infinite waste energy" the area around it would have burst into flames rather than simply stopping in one spot in front of her.</br>  <br>Only if they limit themselves to fit into the world. They have to nerf themselves from infinity to a ridiculous number to barely just fit into the world.</br>    <br>Billion fire ants or a guy who can create billion explosions? Seems fair battle to me.</br>  <br>I'd love to see Othinus in a pit of rape worms</br>  <br>Wait, you're talking about this part from Chapter 11?<br><br>She negated the ground's friction with the mech at that exact moment to make it spin, making its momentum scatter.</br></br></br>  <br>They can't operate on more than world basis. High Priest said this. Only one world and nothing more to change.</br>  <br>Mortal=/=omniscient anon, a lack of permanent danger makes one lapse of thinking things through.</br>  <br>what does FC stand for again</br>  <br>How would you outwit magic god?</br>  <br>Not that, I'd have to check for it but there was a part where she just stuck her hand out and it stopped moving and she claimed it was because of the friction</br>  <br>Not him, but to be fair Touma has outwitted him a couple times this chapter alone, it doesn't amount to anything and the High Priest is fucking around, but he still didn't see it coming</br>  <br>It isn't about Mikoto. It's about the cast working together to come up with a solution to a problem. Why can't we have this instead of a lame power up?</br>  <br>This, it is exactly how crowley got them and probably why othinus didn't remove the fairy stake early on.</br>  <br>Found it.<br><br>How much would this mech need to accelerate to bypass 1 meter of max-friction air?</br></br></br>  <br>Forced Connection. It's what happened to Mikoto in Railgun in the Level 6 attempt arc.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? They can do whatever they want at full power. Literal reality warp on universal scale.</br>  <br>We don't even know if it's possible without Exterior, anyway. If Mikoto absolutely needed a power up, Heaven Canceller, Kiyama Harumi and Will of the Misaka Network are the only ones who could facilitate one. Crowley doesn't want her in danger and she won't consort with a Kihara for strength.</br>  <br>I dont know about accelerating, but it was already moving at a decent pace since he was trying to attack her, I don't know the actual numbers but I do know that she's basically trying to say 1 meter cubed of air has enough force to stop the mech which sounds rather far fetched to me.</br>  <br> turns a battle against a magic god into reverse Road Runner comedy <br><br>What the fuck, Kamachi?<br>Are you fucking with me?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, I think more people need to realize this.</br>  <br>Kamachi is a shit writer don't expect anything form her.</br>  <br>It's great. I love his writing.</br>  <br>I never noticed this the first time, but:<br><br> Mikoto imagining herself in black pantyhose <br><br>Holy fuck my dick is diamonds.</br></br></br></br></br>   Misaka being absolutely shat on and being surprised about it <br><br>Oh god her fucking hubris, this is why I feared her involvement with stuff after not getting the talk in NT2. She probably still thought Accelerator is the biggest deal.up to this point.<br><br>Can't wait for the wake up call so we can finally move on from this shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> black pantyhose <br> dat girly dress shoes <br>Woah. I didn't even noticed myself. Mikoto is so pure.</br></br></br>  It was fun while it lasted. Thread is going to shit!  <br> Puts up a decent show against a Magic God <br> absolutely shat  <br>Bait too strong.</br></br></br>  <br>Please THK, just go back to bed. This thread doesn't need you.</br>  <br>I can't do it anymore, man. You win.</br>  Well shit, we made it to 200 posts before it happened. I reckon that's a record.  <br> decent show <br> barely prevented some people from dying while a bunch still did <br> HP isn't even trying <br> Even is she could mount an attack it wouldn't matter <br>there is no decent show against the gods.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We did it bros. Discussion died down anyway. See you guys in the next thread.</br>  <br><br><br>I'm serious, it's simply jarring to see the "science character acting like hot shit before getting shot down by magician" so far into the story. There really was no reason for Misaka to not have been present for the magic 101 class in NT2 since she was going to be in Hawaii anway, a lot of stuff would have worked better with her being well informed.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Birdway with brown hair</br>  <br> barely prevented some people from dying while a bunch still did <br>You're not even trying anymore. Mikoto practically saved those people in the buildings High Priest throw at her.<br><br>Geez, I know how you operate. I really should stop replying to you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know what it is I just didn't know what that particular abbreviation stood for</br>  <br><br>I'm out too. Backlog keeps beckoning me. It's about time I answer it.</br></br>  <br> I really should stop replying to you <br>You really should. Remember UnLucky?</br></br>  <br>She accomplished more than anyone at that meeting would have. Apparently saving lives isn't important. Accel and Mugino would have been just as ineffective, but wouldn't have given a fuck about bystanders.</br>  <br>Did any of her attacks have an effect on him? If not she didn't do well, she only lives because he chose to keep fucking with her.</br>  <br> Accel and Mugino would have been just as ineffective, but wouldn't have given a fuck about bystanders. <br>Did you forget accel protecting everyone in his fight with kakine? He would have tried and considering all his bullshit he might have done better. Mugino has been on a nice streak but either way she probably couldn't save anyone.</br></br>  <br>Accelerator would care but Mugino wouldn't and couldn't save them even if she did</br>  <br><br>At this point even lives don't really matter anymore, the High Priest can fix all the damage he's done if he feels like it. Magic gods are only good for chatting, not being a threat.</br></br>   Replying multiple times <br> Downplaying at any conceivable angle <br> Being unreasonable while fully knowing the enemy is a Magic God <br>The sudden shift in discussion is so noticeable.</br></br></br>  <br> Accel doesn't give a fuck about bystanders <br>That's why you'll always be a second class villain</br></br>   was for    actually engaging it in conversation <br>When will you tards learn to NOT REPLY?</br>  <br>I guess Mikoto should just kill herself since she's not capable of feats 99% of the rest of the cast also aren't capable of.<br><br><br>Regardless of your personal feelings, I bet Touma has a fuck ton of respect for Mikoto after watching her do all that. She may feel like she came up short, but she was proactive enough to prevent a worst case scenario. Your standards are way too fucking high.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd hardly call crowley mortal at this point</br>  <br> I bet Touma has a lot of respect for her <br>I mean, all he did was say "I told you so" and grab her so I doubt it, it's probably about the same as normal</br></br>  In an hour I'll come back to this thread and ctrl+F "delusional" + "Mikotofags" to get a dozen hits.  <br>This. I'd bet 98% of Mikoto shitposting is just for the guaranteed replies</br>  <br>pull you head out of mikoto's ass. I merely commented on you saying accel wouldn't care about innocent bystanders and couldn't do any better despite having a far more dynamic power.</br>  <br>Can't help it Mikotofags are THAT stupid.</br>  <br>Except Accelerator would care and would do better if only marginally so you're wrong regardless</br>  Man I haven't used this in a while.  I'm just wondering why Touma is running.<br>He knows running won't do anything, he also knows he has no way to fight back.<br>The only way for him to defeat a Magic God is with a frank discussion. Touma should just talk him to death. Actually, that might be the best solution. <br>I think Touma could be able to convince the Magic Gods to kill themselves. <br><br>But I guess it wouldn't make a for a good NT. Oh well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reread his post and try again</br>  <br>Oops I misread your comment ignore</br>  <br>The point is nobody did well against HP, including mikoto. You're going to claim her preventing deaths is a plus but at the same time HP probably would be chucking building if she kept running like touma said instead of trying to fight him. She had the best intentions but it ended up with the same results she said just running would have, more people got dragged into it.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br> probably would be chucking building <br>probably wouldn't be</br></br>  <br><br>Had he kept a cool head, he would have realized that accepting the deal on the condition of keeping the world as it is was a totally valid idea. It's like his brain turned off after heard "perfect world"</br></br>  <br>He's avoiding answering is what it comes down to basically, sure he can only discuss with them but he doesn't have any options currently available that he likes so he's putting off giving an answer. I doubt he could convince them to kill themselves or that he would do it, but if spoilers are to be believed his running around wildly does work out for him eventually</br>  <br>I wonder how touma is suppose to know what problems are natural coincidences and what is caused by magic gods existing. Minor reality warping could keep it from being the magic god puppet show. Although considering what he said using their powers at all even to fix things might cause other problems because they would be putting there power into the world again.</br>  <br> It's about the cast working together to come up with a solution to a problem. <br><br>That's what's happening right now, except its pretty much all Touma. Mikoto doesn't know what the fuck is going on and can't offer much in terms of raw power OR wits because she just doesn't know how to apply them. Sure, she handled the building situation well, but that situation wouldn't have happened in the first place if she listened to Touma. <br><br>She's been fighting with her head dunked in AC kool-aid for a long time now and that just doesn't cut it anymore. She either needs to pull it out and learn so she can compensate, or get a big powerup so her blind flailing will start working again.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why does everyone being happy immediately amount to everyone being puppets/fishes/prisoners? Does he think people suffering or having memories of having suffered makes everything "real"? Is he just determined to think happiness that isn't brought by his fist is bad?  <br>Purple is my way of life.</br>  Alright folks, settle down. Let's all take a break with...<br><br>B/a/thtime with Laura!<br>*fanfare*<br><br>Please join me in welcoming our dear Archbishop, the lovely Laura Stuart!<br>(applause, cheers and whoops)<br>(a bathtub is wheeled in full of steaming water and Laura is inside it, waving merrily)<br><br>And how are you this evening, Laura?<br> Very tolerable, thank you! Oh what a crowd we have tonight! You are all wonderful people. <br>(more cheers)<br>Haha, is wonderful the first word that came to your mind?<br> Actually no. "Easily manipulated" is more like it. <br>(laughter)<br><br>Your cheek is impeccable as always. Now, what have you brought in today?<br> WELL, I've recently purchased a 17th century Bavarian treasure on the market. <br>(oohs)<br>On the market, you say? The black market?<br> No, the grey (sarcastically). <br>(laughter)<br> No, but really. Antique bathtubs on the black market? My good man, you are off your rocker! <br>(laughter and more cheers)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fuck is this</br>   tfw you will never get to be in a mixed bath alone with Kanzaki <br>why live.  ;_: </br>  So a lot of us agree Touma will die at the end, but how will he die? explosion? bleed-out? illness? perhaps some sort of endless void?  <br><br>You do me a great disservice, madam. I was never on the rocker to begin with.<br> No doubt. <br>So tell us more about your new bathtub. What about it attracted you?<br> It has this very elaborate floral pattern around the side. Painted in fine brush strokes, every leaf and wisp on the flower stalks and vines. The gold rim and clawed feet are standard fare, of course, but painted designs left intact are rather hard to come by. <br>And why is that?<br> Colors fade, surfaces get chipped from bumps and scrapes. I have tubs I never bathe in because if I got inside them, they would in all likelihood fall apart. I keep them intact with magic. But this one is sturdy and with minimal damage. Best bargain we ever made! <br><br>Am I right in assuming that you've used it already?<br> Quite. The interior was somewhat narrow for my taste... but I felt regal, I really did. It was a grand experience. <br>"Was"?<br> One of my boys accidentally tripped over it this past weekend. <br>(groans from the crowd)<br>Goodness. Nothing hurt, I hope?<br> A sizable piece on the rim, chipped! Thankfully the crack didn't reach the flowers. <br>I meant your employee...<br>(laughter)<br> Oh, him? I had him sent to the Tower. <br>(laughter mixed with some groans)<br>Wow. That's a bit harsh, isn't it?<br> Not at all. A few hours hanging from his ankles won't hurt him. <br>(laughter)<br> And might I remind you that this was, after all, a Bavarian treasure. <br>From the sixteenth century. I quite understand.<br> SEVENTEENTH, dear. <br>(laughter and cheers)<br><br>Haha... we'll be right back after the commercial, folks! Stay tuned, we'll be right back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically people should create their happiness by themselves not by some phony god blessing.</br>  <br>Suicide</br>  <br>Shot</br>  <br/>  <br>He drowns in Laura's bathtub.</br>  <br>The TouMAN is gritty as fuck now. Like, he'd Colombian neck tie a dude like it were fucking nothing.</br>  <br><br>Death by marriage to Fukiyose.</br></br>  <br>Problem with touma is he doesnt really care about becoming strong or playing as God. This is a guy who constantly proclaim himself as a just a normal highschool boy. He even ranted how he just want to continue his normal life of feedig his headcrab, going to school and hanging out with his bros.</br>  <br> Touma <br> dying <br>He probably will be forgotten and will wander around saving people and moving like a puppet controlled by strings of life.</br></br></br>  Where can I get these in epub? They took them down so many times from the baka forums  <br> Problem with touma is he doesnt really care about becoming strong or playing as God. This is a guy who constantly proclaim himself as a just a normal highschool boy. He even ranted how he just want to continue his normal life of feedig his headcrab, going to school and hanging out with his bros. <br><br>And it isn't just a mere problem. His wish is literally impossible, unless he received help from the Magic Gods.<br>Even a normal life is constantly changing. If he is unwilling to accept the Magic Gods's offer he will have to deal with the fact he cannot avoid change forever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://yadi.sk/d/v3qBTocKh3cgX</br>  <br><br>Thank you so fucking much.</br></br>  <br><br><br>STRONK<br>T<br>R<br>O<br>N<br>K</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you know if there are epubs for the new testament?</br></br>  <br>There are, they're on Baka-tsuki's epub generator<br>(http://ln.m-chan.org/v3/)</br></br>  <br>I had Nova's mediafire bookmarked which had all the .pdfs and .epubs and whatnot, but now it's been nuked from orbit.

Saving everything and backing it up to keep it safe.<br><br>Appreciate it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They reinforce their bodies with magic. But going full Saint mode all the time would be suicidal. There's a limit to what magic can do.<br><br>From what I can tell, the basic tactic is to go Saint mode for brief moments and revert once they're done. Like using Devil Trigger for certain attacks and immediately reverting to normal after you're done attacking.</br></br></br>  It's kinda surreal seeing Touma use lethal tactics.  <br> Like using Devil Trigger for certain attacks and immediately reverting to normal after you're done attacking. <br>Are you telling me that Saints use Distortion?</br></br>  <br>One day he'll PTSD mid fight and whip out some truly brutal shit and just demolish some poor fucker without realizing.</br>  <br>Basically.</br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Would make a novel 10/10</br>  <br><br>Haha, remember when Enshuu channeled Touma and crushed Byouri's torso?</br></br>  this is canon right?    <br> Haha, remember when Enshuu channeled Touma and crushed Byouri's torso? <br>I do, but how did it go again? Was it just a punch?</br></br>  <br>It was offscreen.</br>  <br>It was off screen violence, which reminds me that Touma was fairly fucked up since the beginning.</br>  <br> crossover <br> canon </br></br>   magic god causing this chaos in AC <br> Crowley probably doesn't give a fuck <br><br>Send the fucking dog already.</br></br></br>  Study &gt; High Priest confirmed.  <br>yeah its like he personally experience seeing all that lethal tactics</br>  <br>Wasnt on Ot 2 he was particularly brutal when he snapped?</br>  <br><br> Off screen <br>Fuck that's probably why I don't remember it. Was she still alive? She referred to the card as Touma-Oneechan didn't she? It Touma like some kinda big brother figure to girls in the darkness? They know he'd save any one of them if they asked.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, though that's because someone died in front of him. Still, the man is brutal.</br>  <br>Touma experienced more lethal shit than anyone in this series can imagine. Not even a hypothetical Accelerator brutally picking apart all 20,000 clones, Last Order, plus another entire Network of WORSTs could even come close</br>   Touma doesn't resort to punching his enemies no more <br><br>Fuck.</br></br>  Reminder that Touma would literally carve off pieces of his own flesh to feed others if it was necessary. Reminder that he's actually done this in one of Othinus' worlds.  <br>He can't. There's no way he can beat a Magic God in a fist fight.</br>  <br> Punch magic gods </br>  <br> punches HP <br> literally jack shit will happen <br>his problem here is Magic gods have even higher durability then saints do and saint wreck toumas shit in hand to hand every time.<br>hes gotta be more brutal or hes gonna get completely screwed in this fight.<br>we will have a good old punchout fight next volume between him and the anti-touma, just watch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I meant the cunny game.</br></br>  <br>He was decomposed alive in humus.</br>  <br/>  <br>he also got cannibalized alive.<br>and a horde of other terrible shit.<br>pretty certain he got ebola as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that Misaka in thigh highs? Please tell me that's Misaka in thigh highs.</br>  <br>I bet he was put through the same helicopter torture too.</br>  <br>Those are stockings.</br>  <br>She's only wearing them in her head, anyway</br>  <br>I have the feeling Touma will be pounced out.</br>  <br> Was she still alive? <br>Byouri or Enshuu? Byouri survived it because loldarkmatter, Enshuu is "lost" but never explicitly died. And calling the cards oneechan was just her thing, the other Kiharas (or at least Byouri) are scared shitless of him.</br></br>  <br>Didnt he also got smashed by an asteroid in one of those hells</br>   the more NT goes on the less Touma punches <br>I-I'm scared.</br>  <br>Unfortunately.</br>  <br>On the bright side we have Touma wrecking shit and being a madman, so we have that going on.</br>  <br> unfortunately  <br>Please, he needs a punching out</br></br>  <br>His spaceship got smashed by an asteroid or a giant robot, yeah.</br>  <br> yfw someone confesses to him on the roof but instead it was a bitch that pushed herself and him off it <br> Ash slowly dies with his neck broken just before Othinus resets the world again </br></br>  <br> No more horrible speeches followed by a deck to the female antagonists face </br>  <br> implying laura isn't gonna get her shit punched in for this stupid magic god shit later </br>  <br> the more he let other people do his bidding or beat his enemies for him <br> yfw Touma is slowly turning into a dark lord </br></br>   this faggot Touma being based as fuck in this chase scene   <br> Implying Touma would punch a cute face like this </br>  <br> implying this mess isn't entirely her fault, literally everything from him losing his memories because of lyl brain capacity shit from index to fiamma's shit to everything is gonna be linked back to her at some point. </br>  <br>touma's seen enough shit to realize when bullshit arrives he just needs to end whatever the shit.</br>   The world will suddenly end one day. <br><br> The world will be destroyed all on its own if left alone. <br><br> Just as humans wither up all on their own if they forget to breathe or eat, the world will roll down the hill to destruction if it is simply left to the ravages of time. The world has only lasted to this day and this moment because a &gt;great many people are desperately holding that giant snowball up and keeping it from rolling down. <br><br> That is why the end will come suddenly. <br><br> No matter how hard people work, the world’s end will arrive like an unexpected death. Even if everyone’s work manages to avoid that end once, there is no guarantee that death will not make a second visit. Through the &gt;ages and eons, the world has fallen ill and been in accidents. And one day, it will be tormented by its own lifespan. <br><br> The world will not be destroyed because something special happens. <br><br> The world is only being maintained because something special is happening.  <br>The World is Fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder what other lethal methods Touma can do.  <br> from him losing his memories because of lyl brain capacity shit from index  <br><br>You know he could have avoided this by telling index to just fuck off from his house in the beginning when he first met her.</br></br></br>  <br>He tried billions way to kill othinius.<br>He is the best assasin.</br></br>  <br>He tried to.</br>  <br>to late.<br>Old Touma fell in Love with index</br></br>  <br> Implying everything didn't went just according to keikaku </br>  <br> didn't went <br>*didn't go</br></br>  <br>Nigga isn't even the final boss</br>  <br>This. Even if he calls himself a normal highschool boy doesnt mean he cant possess some tricks in his sleeve.</br>  <br>toumas probably tried everything under the sun thats physically possible to do against othinus.<br>i kind of hope he tries hitting HP with a train next.</br></br>  <br>Demon Lord Touma will be so fun!<br>I hobe when Touma changed to Demon Lord we can see his tricks from another point of view.</br></br>  <br>He tried billions way to kill othinius.<br>He is the best assasin against othinus. <br>Fixed.</br></br></br>  <br>i just want to see all the brutal shit he does in addition to his full powerset going from another point of view, like say accelerator.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128205687 <br>wrong thread m8<br>but hilariously appropriate for whats going on with the MC right now.</br></br>  <br>Kamisato would be a good opportunity for that. Just a "normal high school boy" desperately trying to survive the crazy bastard that can turn everything around him into torturous death traps.<br><br> did he just crash a plane into my apartment <br> holy shit he derailed a train at me <br> finally, some saints are here to oh my god he just splattered them on the walls <br> good thing I have an escape tunnWHY ARE THERE LIONS IN HERE </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enshuu has real potenzial!<br>She needs a Teacher.<br>Then she could be real awesome.<br>Sogiita would be the perfect person for her</br></br></br></br>  <br> normal high school boy <br>if he says he is a normal high school boy then he is as crazy as Touma.</br></br>  Is there any mentioning about WWII in To Aru novels? Is hitler was magician?  <br>Not that I can recall, but with their interest in the occult I'd be surprised if there were no nazi magicians.</br>  <br> Is hitler was magician? <br>Oh man, I want to see this.

It's implied she was less of a shithead until she moved in with him. Like I'm totally okay with him being a beta enabler IF he wasn't the reason shes fucked in the first place.</br>  <br> implying you wouldn't spoil the shit out of her <br><br>Fuck, every time she forces me to promise spending a whole day with her, I'd stand no chance.</br></br></br>  <br>She fucking blackmails him by acting all innocent in front of strangers and making everyone think he's a bad brother if she doesn't gt her way</br>  <br>I would too but I'd make her do actually cool shit. I'd take her rock climbing or go to the beach, fun shit like that where she can actually meet people when shes an adult. What hes essentially doing it raising her to be one of those people who peak in highschool. Shes gonna end up one of those people who smoke a pack a day, work at an office over time, come home pound down a 6pack, then get 4 hours of sleep because they stayed up late watching TV.

Why did she shrink down to the size of a ping-bong ball?  <br>is this a new meme?</br>  Best cover story aside from From the Decks of the World.  Do you guys think bellamy will actually become a crew member? he seems like the most likely out of dressrosa at the least.  <br>at this point yes he is the strongest candidate<br><br>but<br> redundant power set <br> may wind up with Law because tattoo <br> Viola still a strong contender <br> he's kind of a fucking loser </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More likely to join Laws crew because<br><br>1. His chest tattoo can easily be changed to Laws.<br><br>2. He originally joined Doffy for being the pride of the North Blue, Law is also from the North Blue.<br><br>3. He wants to survive the great wave mentioned in pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There will be no-one from Dressrosa.</br>  <br><br>That and I can't imagine Nami being comfortable with it. Though Luffy wouldn't listen to protests anyway.</br></br>  <br>Second best you mean.</br>  <br><br><br>He's going to go an adventure alone to find his true self.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Oda paired Jinbei and Sanji up in FMI to convey them as equals. While I feel like Jinbei is stronger, I pair them together still because they're similar and close in general.<br> <br>Jinbei's body is naturally better at handling something like that. He's much larger and possibly has organs spaced out more/differently. Like with Ace, Sakazuki's magmafist is large in comparison to the torso and therefore is much more likely to kill Zoro/Ace.</br></br></br>  <br> Viola still a strong contender <br>Anon you could have made sense if you just didn't add this.</br></br>  <br> was a consenting member of the pirate crew the marines are arresting <br> first girl to actually like sanji back <br> unique and practical powerset <br> unique group dynamic (isn't a slut) <br> Rebecca can be princess in her stead </br></br></br></br></br>  so is sabo strong, or is burger weak?<br><br>is sabo possibly as strong as doffy? stronger?<br><br>do you think sabo is stronger than g4 luffy? (obviously he would win a 1v1 either way, he'd outlast like doffy did most likely)</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'd be better off with Law.</br>  <br>All of that is irrelevant. And Rebecca can't become the queen, legally she isn't allowed to. Honestly, Rebecca has a more likely chance of joining than Viola.</br>  <br> legally <br><br>they JUST overthrew the government...</br></br></br>  <br>If he's the second strongest member of the revolutionaries it would make sense that he can beat somebody who's only like the 5th or 6th strongest member of a yonkou crew. <br><br>Sabo is probably around Marcos lever.</br></br></br>  <br> Has a fruit that ruins every part of adventure and exploration. <br><br>You can't honestly think Sanji will finally get what he wants right?</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter. She may be blood to Riku, but her mother abandoned the throne. She wasn't born into royalty. She's just a regular woman. And I really don't see her becoming the princess. Viola's powers are more suited for keeping the kingdom under a watchful eye, which would fit with One Piece's way of doing things after an arc or with cover stories. Plus, why do you want someone who can see what's coming ahead before it happens? That's not what Luffy would want.</br>  <br>Viola is so similar to Robin though. Monet/Perona would have been a nice change-up.</br>  <br> lever </br>  <br>They're pulling each others levers all day anon. You can't deny it.</br>  <br>Agreed, not saying she's the best most interesting possible new female nakama, just that she has a good chance.</br>   people still think Straw Hats are getting a new crewmember out of this <br>nobody in Dressrosa stood out except Law and he's not joining</br>  <br>Brook was the first one to sacrifice himself.</br>  <br>Honestly, after the Paulie feint, I don't even pretend to know who Oda's going to have join or not.</br>  <br>You mean after Robin, right?</br>  <br>Actually, regardless of who did what and when, in the end the order of royalty will go by bloodline. I don't remember who was older, Viola or Rebecca's mom, but whoever was older would rule next. I believe Viola. If Rebecca's mom was older then at the moment next in line is Rebecca (followed by Viola of Rebecca dies before birthing kids).</br>  <br>it was rebeccas mom, she's next in line.<br><br>I wish that kyros became king though, hes able to protect his country with strengh if he has to, and hes nice like king riku. just seems ideal</br></br></br>  <br>He can't. Not a drop of royal blood. But, he can rule by proxie, more or less, as an advisor to his daughter.<br><br>I agree he is strong, but is he wise enough yet? It's true that we see a transition of him going from hooligan to an actual asset to the crown. And while that does take scruples to be picked up or developed, I doubt he's fully there yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Jango's Dance Paradise a  underrated but still not better than Miss Goldenweek's </br>  <br>Ha! That was one of those Oda stunts that left a deep impression on me. I felt so confused when it first happened.</br>  <br>I like how those two overlapped through coverstories. The bromance formed between Jango and Fullbody and the fun of it makes it my favourite. Baroque Works one was also enjoyable though.</br>  <br>I want him to join up with Barto and Cavendish as a Strawhat fanboy</br>  what will be sanjis new secret technique that puts him back in the top 3 strongest strawhat? <br><br>Honestly though the monster trio has become very broken, zorro is miles ahead of sanji and luffy is on a whole level entirely compared to the rest of crew ( just like every other captain)<br><br>I think the new monster trio is going to be ussop zorro sanji once ussop and sanji get their shit together</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, I can't really pick a favourite.</br>  <br> not Zoro, Franky and Sanji <br>they're the heavy hitters that aren't Luffy. Chopper could also be up there if he was better at actually fighting.</br></br>  <br> x=26+x <br><br>Iva taught him how to wink REALLY hard<br><br>or him being able to fly is really handy for Godzilla sized bosses</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daz is the most underrated cutie<br><br>Does ANYONE have a more adorable dream?</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks, Law and Kuzan suddenly got really hot<br><br>Honorable mention to Helmeppo</br></br></br>  <br>Sarkies was the one that Doflamingo controlled to cut down (and presumably kill at that time) Bellamy.</br>  <br> 1. The first timeskip that occurred was when luffy was 10 and higuma was the first named character to be killed and the next named character was Lacuba at the slave house who bit his tongue. <br>Pretty sure it was Roshio actually.</br></br>  Aokiji isn't actually allied with Blackbeard is he? He must have some sort of scheme.  <br>probably</br>  <br>There must be something else, however I don't see Kuzan betraying BB, because BB is not the kind of guy one would be truly be surprised to see outsmarted, imho Kuzan will try to use BB to destroy the WG.</br>  <br>He is, but not for the purpose of supporting him.</br>  <br>I know Luffy is stronger than the others but I can't see Zoro being too entirely far behind. He's scary when he wants to be.</br>  I'm looking for a new anime but I'm hesitant to watch one piece as I watched it as a child and I didn't like it.<br><br>I've only just got into anime and my favourite so far is fairy tail. I like childish humor and strong emotion, fairy tail made me cry and cheer and I'm hoping one piece will do the same what do you guys think are they similar?</br></br>  <br>I think you're a faggot for liking Fairy Tail.</br>    <br>I'm a girl.</br>  <br>I'm a prettier girl.</br>  <br>If you really are an animeonlyfag then watch the first 310 episodes but then switch to the manga. But beware that you will quickly come to realize that Fairy Tail is utter shit compared to One Piece.</br>  <br>Why didn't you like it?</br>  <br>Doubtful. Since you're so boastful I'll let you post a timestamped picture of yourself first.<br><br>9/10 average on /soc/ let's see you.</br></br></br>  <br>After watching and reading One Piece for years I started watching Fairy Tail and it really is inferior to One Piece in pretty much every category.</br>  <br>It creeped me out, the main character how he stretched his body, I was 10 or 11.</br>  <br>So you didn't like One Piece because of a rubber boy's ability to stretch? I mean if you're half mature now, then that wont even matter. Fairy Tail is a poor man's One Piece.</br>  <br>And you've probably seen the dub right?</br>  <br> Fairy Tail Shanks is pre-timeskip Shanks <br>Deep.</br></br>  <br>4kids dub undoubtedly.</br>  <br>Yes, it left a sour taste. That picture is interesting. I'll take your advice than and give it a chance.<br><br><br>Yes, does that matter? I can't really watch subs unless I mute it which makes it unwatchable the language puts me off.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people keep thinking there's gonna be another crew member? Luffy said he only wanted 10 people in his crew at the start:<br><br>1. Luffy<br>2. Zoro<br>3. Nami<br>4. Usopp<br>5. Sanji<br>6. Chopper<br>7. Robin<br>8. Franky<br>9. Brook<br>10.  Thousand Sunny </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dub is the reason you didnt liked it in the first place, that wasnt one piece, go and watch the sub now and see you in 2 or 3 weeks after finished, go and search some page who show you what chapters are fillers and what you can see so yo can watch like 100 less chapters</br>  <br>luffy doesnt count</br>  <br>As much as I really like the idea of Bellamy joining after all these years and becoming a good guy, he's going to end going with Law. The whole 'dark past with Doflamingo' and the tattoo just kind of seal the deal.<br><br>Either that, or he's going to go off on his own and make his own crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Burgess is strong as shit. Sabo is just stronger, and that whole scene was just Burgess being a jobber to hype up Sabo.</br>  <br>Luffy said that he wanted 10 nakama/crewmates. That doesn't include himself.<br>1. Zoro<br>2. Sanji<br>3. Nami<br>4. Usopp<br>5. Chopper<br>6. Robin<br>7. Franky<br>8. Brook<br><br>That leaves two spots.<br>Jinbei is pretty much confirmed, leaving just one more opening. Oda also said some time post timeskip that there would be more members joining the crew (so likely the two final ones), and he said they'd show up successively.<br><br>Jinbei is highly likely to actually connect and properly join at Zou (next arc), and it'd be likely that we get someone from the following arc based on what Oda said, meaning Wano. I personally think it'll either be Kinemon, some samurai or  Monet if she's somehow alive </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure Jimbei all but confirmed joining the crew, he only had "something to do" which prevented him from joining at that point.<br><br>Now that he has the Poneglyph he'll probably join up the next time they meet.</br></br></br></br>  Oda said there would be more crewmates coming.<br><br>I think that there will be 12 of them at the very, very max at the end of OP.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what I was saying.<br><br>Luffy asked him to join and he accepted, and especially now with the poneglyph, I don't know how anyone could deny it.</br></br></br>  <br>Jimbe refused to go simply because his presence in the crew would make future fights extremely trvial for quite some time. Oda obviously wants Jimbe to be in the crew but cannot allow it until the Strawhats and their enemies reach Jimbe's level. That way, his sudden power introduction wouldn't be so jarring.</br>  <br>Good thing we're about to reach the Yonkous now isn't it.</br>  <br>The stalling was pretty smart. Jinbei's current bounty exceeds Luffy's, so atleast post-Dressrosa will raise Luffy's to 550 million or so, giving Jinbei's some room without encroaching Luffy's too much.</br>  <br>Luffy and zoro are already shown to be stronger than jimbei already. He is stronger than sanji but weaker than zoro.</br>  <br>No, they aren't. Jimbe is still in a league of his own and is a former Shichibukai. I doubt that Zoro can bat Doflamingo on his own, and Luffy was barely able to do it.</br>  <br>And I don't see jinbei beating doffy either.</br>  <br>Xusasu Basasu got his ass kicked by Ace earlier, and then got his ass kicked by Sabo. He's supposed to be strong, but definitely isn't as strong as the number 2 of the Revolutionaries. <br><br>Sabo is likely around Admiral tier, and Xusasu is likely somewhere below that, though probably a bit higher than Luffy.</br></br></br>  Jimbei did mention "things", so maybe there's something other than the Poneglyph.  <br>Robin used to be so hot.</br>  I understand some hype around Monet given personal preferences and taste. Im not particularly fond of her character in any way but hey. <br><br>However, I fail to understand how, not being driven by one's own doujin wishes, would somebody think she is anywhere near being a new crewmember.</br></br>  <br>Had to go help that kitten.</br>  <br> not living a life being driven by one's own doujin wishes </br>  <br><br>In/near water Jinbei is more than likely to win.</br></br>  <br>Ace was a deadly logia who was the second division commander of a yonkou, while Blackbeard's crewmates were just newish recruits of Blackbeard who were probably strong back in the blues/early GL. Of course they'd have nothing on Ace back then, same goes for the SHs including Luffy. <br><br>Sabo is under admiral level; around Doflamingo I'd say. Jesus is strong, yes, but I'd put him equal to or a bit below Luffy now that he has G4.<br><br>Still though; Burgess isn't weak. Losing to a very strong character =/= weak, despite what many people seem to think.<br><br><br>That's the ties to Big Mom he's got to cut, but where is Big Mom right now? Dressrosa/Zou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> used to be <br>she is even hotter now</br></br>  <br>Robin's in her hotness prime currently.</br>  <br>She used to be the prettiest and most unique-looking woman in all anime and manga. Now she's just a generic hottie. I miss those bangs.</br>  How strong was Roger really?<br><br>He could hear sea kings, rivaled WB without any known devil fruit and commanded a legend like Rayleigh.<br><br>Still, I'd find it hilarious if it all turned out to be some red herring and Roger was extremely weak winning all his fights by pure luck.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Roger recruited Buggy because he reminded him of himself. Buggy will be the next Pirate King </br></br></br>  <br><br>We can only hope.</br></br>  <br>What's up with Luffy's left arm? (His left, our right)</br>  <br>Buggy vs God Usopp<br><br>Who wins?</br></br></br>  <br>It's just shrouded by the stream produced by Gear Second.</br>  <br><br>Usopp and all the dolls he rescued in Dressrosa<br><br>Vs.<br><br>Buggy and all the criminals from Impel down</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one true god.</br>  <br>I miss her too. She was hot as fuck in her first appearance. <br><br>Big boobs don't always make things better.</br></br></br>  <br> She was hot as fuck in her first appearance. <br>eeeeeh, sorry but when she first appeared she looked awkward as fuck</br></br>  <br>You like a little Miss All-Sunday hey?</br>  <br>Yeah but how is he holding it? Is it bent or is cut off from our view? There's also a weird bulge near the armpit.</br>  <br>On paper Buggy seems like an incredibly powerful pirate.<br> is a Shichibukai <br> was on Gol Rodgers crew <br> long time childhood friends with a Yonkou <br> part of one of the only successful escapes from Impel Down <br> leads tons of powerful pirates <br> was part of the Whitebeard War of the Greatest <br>The man's resume packs a punch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Chopper and Robin are the only Straw Hats left that don't have a Number chapter. Chopper's The Sixth seems to be related to some sort of Vegapunk arc, but Robin's The Seventh is ambiguous. You'd think her chapter would have been during Enies Lobby, but it wasn't. So what's left for her? Her guilt about Vivi? Something about the Poneglyphs regarding the Will of D.?  <br>And then you realize he's just like Zonge.</br>  <br> Fairy Tail is a poor man's One Piece. <br>That's a severe overstatement<br>Fairy tail is repetitive titty bait and a poor man's dbz (muh courage, muh resolution, muh friends, muh powerlevels)<br>One piece has actually got plot and interesting characters with reasons behind their actions</br></br></br></br>  <br>I started reading before Water Seven, stopped due to circumstances, and then came back after Enies Lobby. I honestly don't understand how people thought Paulie would join, I never got that vibe from him at all.</br>  <br>This cover always reminded me of a cover from death note where this leather wearing chick had her fiance killed by Yagami<br>Anyway, yes, I do miss that Robin<br><br>Kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Paulie was cool and all, but Franky was so obvious and much more prominent.
