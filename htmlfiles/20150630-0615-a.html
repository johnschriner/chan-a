[  We are all just specs of dust flying through space <br><br>It's time for a full marathon of this beauty now that it is fully out. Who else will be joining me?<br><br>What is your favourite episode /a/?</br></br></br></br>  Have fun, I gotta go outside now.  <br>Nanako 13</br>  <br>I came here to post this</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br>Episode 8 was gr8<br><br>r8 nanako over 8</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>mfw when Nanako passes Pioneer 10 in space and the music starts playing</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never forget.</br>  <br>Speaking of which, there's a thing that I've been asking myself ever since watching this episode.<br><br>Aparte is only 3 light months away from earth, right? Isn't that close enough to cause at least some trouble for our solar system and earth once it becomes a complete star?</br></br></br>  <br>Not an astrophysicist here, but I doubt any heat created by the new star would have negative effects.</br>    <br>What about no more night time or extra solar wind?</br>  <br>Again, not an astrophysicist<br><br>I'm not even sure light from that far away could make much of a difference to us</br></br></br>  <br>It's fairly further away from us than our sun, so it's affects wouldn't be as great. It would appear in the sky as a much smaller version of our sun.<br>Also as a young star, it won't be as bright or as big.<br>But who knows, maybe the oceans would boil without night time.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not an astrophysicist either but I believe that the gravity of Aparte may be a problem for earth. <br>There's been a a theory for decades now about a brown dwarf called Nemesis circling sun at a distance of 1.5 light years. It is supposed to cause mass extinction on earth every ~30 million years by directing asteroids into the center of the solar system with its gravity.<br><br>I don't know whether Aparte's mass and distance of 3 light months is enough to have similar effects.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The gravity would be the exact same, since it's the same mass. The only thing that changed is that Apate is now also making light. if their solar system works exactly like ours but with a dwarf planet, then Apate turning into a star won't change that.</br>  <br>I don't think it gains mass by becoming a star<br><br>And that thing about Nemesis sounds like something a foil-hat conspiracy theorist pulled out of his bum</br></br></br>  <br>Now that I think about it you're right, it's 20,000 times further, only 30 times larger than Jupiter (isn't that the minimum for a star?)  and just light up so it's radiation won't go past the value for moon brightness much less the value for a RGE.</br>  <br>It doesn't need to be much larger than Jupiter, it just needs enough mass to start the core collapse necessary to cause fusion.</br>  <br>I'm down for a marathon. Is someone going to stream it?</br>  <br> RGE <br>*runaway greenhouse effect</br></br>  <br>Rewatching, I feel so bad for Subaru now how no one wants to watch the meteor shower with her.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Yo<br><br>I tried this out in universe sandbox, with the hella rough estimates for distance and mass<br><br>If its accurate in comparison to the anime, then Apate would be about as bright as a brown dwarf. Hardly noticable</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br> 30 jupiters <br><br>SHIIIIIIIET that's massive</br></br></br>  <br> m=30 jupiters <br> gas giant <br> assuming sol metallicity </br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigga I dont know this science shit<br><br> What would you have me enter? </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the thing, we could assume assumptions but that will only tell us it won't be as bright as the sun.</br>  <br>Make an earth and then just add a whole gas giant's atmosphere worth of hydrogen and helium</br>  It was a fun show, gainax put effort into this ;_;  Reminder  <br>What if they were sick since birth?</br>  Hoping the show will sell at least 2k copies    <br> anon in a not-so-distant-future pleiades thread </br>  <br>In a not so distant thread, Gainax will be no more. And when the light of Betelgeuse reaches the Earth, even Subaru will be no more. Pleiades will outlive them all, hopefully.</br>  <br>I can always make a wish upon Altair Vega in nine days.</br>  So, concerning Apathe:<br>http://www.space.com/28284-planet-x<wbr>-worlds-beyond-pluto.html</wbr></br>  <br> And that thing about Nemesis sounds like something a foil-hat conspiracy theorist pulled out of his bum <br>Most stars are believed to be binary and they have ways to measure the effects a brown dwarf would potentially have. I believed the theory developed for that very reason, to explain certain anomalies.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she comes across as a loner. :\</br>  <br>Saturn/Itsuki one, even though Itsuki is not even my favourite</br>  <br>4</br>  <br><br>Universe Sandbox guy here<br><br>Apate's distance in the anime was 3 lightmonths, which was MUCH farther away than any other solar objects. In the simulation, with a mass of 30 times the size of Jupiter, it had no effect on the orbits of any of the dwarf planets.<br><br>I will admit that we don't know the actual mass of Apate, so this whole thing is still up for debate</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I also don't know if its orbit was eccentric to a drastic degree</br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown<wbr>_dwarf<br><br>Try the simulation with 80 jupiter masses</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Starting</br>  <br>orbits before Apate was added</br>  <br>After one century of Apate</br>    looks like shit's happening  <br>Not much changed</br>  <br>But Apate was always there even if it's gravitational pull was as strong as the one of a black hole the planets orbits could have reached equlibrium way before humanity existed.</br>  <br>I can run the simulation for 4.6 billion years if you want</br>  <br>Do it, then tell me if any planet survives</br>  <br><br><br>I've recently discovered the limitations of my computer.<br><br>4.6 billion isn't happening, not for me anyway.<br><br>If any anon has a baller ass computer and/or baller-ass math, please try this out and post results.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I didn't watch this little girls cartoon to learn about space and relativity physics shit.  <br>We probably have similar specs so I won't do it</br>  <br>If you did a million years, it should be enough</br>  <br> little girls cartoon </br>  <br>The thing is, my computer shits itself every time I increase the speed to near a decade per second.<br><br>I'd be lucky to make it to one thousand.</br></br></br>  <br>That's ok. Honestly, I don't think it would make much of a difference. The Sun is over 1,000 Jupiter masses.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupit<wbr>er_mass</wbr></br></br></br>  I'm a little disappointed I was so behind on this show and didn't get to participate in any of the threads, since it seems like a lot of fun. But still, I had a great time watching Pleiades. I think it's going to be a bit of an underrated gem of the year. <br><br>Nanako best girl.</br></br>  <br>That was some of the most interesting parts.</br>  <br>I'm unable to understand even the most basic of shit when it comes to the scientific and space stuff they'd talk about, but I still enjoyed those parts.</br>  <br>Did you at least check out the charts and space talk in our previous threads?<br>Hikaru best girl, Itsuki best grill.</br></br>  <br>Nope. I hadn't looked in any of the threads since maybe the third episode when I started falling really behind on the show.</br>  <br>Lots of fun space talk in the episode threads, I was always late to them so I may as well have been lurking the archives, so take my word that you can still get a lot out of them if that's your thing.</br>  Literally bump.  SOL spinoff sequel when?  Was that song at the end of the 4th ONA ever released?  <br>Speaking of which, How are the ONA?</br>  <br>Horrible, they're sponsored by Honda.</br>  <br>Oh shit, does anyone have all the endcards?<br>It escapes me why CR wouldn't include them (or why gainax wouldn't send them, if that was the case).</br></br>  <br>A kind anon posted this in the last thread.<br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!YNFj2KzL!KCKo<wbr>V5ppyuNcSYt4FLl5NA</wbr></br></br>  <br>Cool, thanks.</br>  <br>at least Kano's version of it is available somewhere, and I kind of prefer it over the ONA version.</br>  <br>What is the name of the song?</br>  <br>「ひとりじゃないよ」<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CaM<wbr>KMdkLbck</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>I'm gonna rewatch when the BDs are out, in the meantime you're on your own.</br>  <br>I really want this now<br><br> every episode has at least one cutaway to Minato the Human Vegetable </br></br></br>  <br>In the last episode, we see Apate light up in the sky.</br>  <br>No we don't.</br>  <br>Yes we do.</br>  <br>Timestamp?</br>  <br><br>Well there's this part where she looks at the sky and this reflection is seen in her eyes.</br></br>  <br><br>But that's exactly the same visuals as when the spaceship crashed before.<br>I'm not sure if Gainax is trolling here and implying that everyone's wish to fly into space again was so strong that the crash happens just all over again, or if they were just reusing this is a symbol.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Then there's also this rather prominent pink dot right above the meteorite. I don't know how strong exactly the luminosity of a brown dwarf is, I know it is much much weaker than the sun and it's much further away and it has a different spectrum. The Sun's spectral maximum is around 550nm in the visible light, a brown dwarf probably only gives a very small part of it's radiation off as visible light and most in the infrared.</br></br>  What's most surprising is that this was really good when I just expected it to be a 12 episode long car commercial.  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown<wbr>_dwarf#Spectral_class_T<br> the actual appearance of T dwarfs to human visual perception is estimated to be not brown, but the color of magenta coal tar dye </br></wbr></br>  Guess everyone else is sleeping right now.  <br><br>Cool.</br></br>   didn't watch this show, because the OVAs were mediocre <br> just now check the archives and realize it had the best threads of anything this season <br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>If it IS Apathe it leads to another implication. The girls basically jumped back to the point where their worlds were merged to begin with and they are now in worlds where none of the magical shenanigans ever happend, so the only way for Apathe to be visible in the sky would be that the girls apart from changing their own characters a bit before returning also made the silent wish for Apathe to light up and become visible in the sky.<br>Not sure how likely that is, then again, why would they draw a completely uniformly colored starry sky, and then put ONE prominent pink dort there for no reason?<br>Closest to this color would be Mars, and Mars is red.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sorry for all the samefagging, I compiled everything into one image now.<br>Makes me wonder how many more hidden things we may have missed.</br>  <br><br>Only problem is that Apate isn't exactly magenta in the show, but maybe the fusion reactions change its chemical composition and its appearance.</br></br>  <br>Thanks. That's definitely Apate. They even used the shooting star to draw attention to it.<br><br>It's a shame more people didn't watch this show. Maybe we could have picked up on different things.</br></br></br>  The whole show was basically a long dream. It was a fanciful show with lots of visual allusions to previous stories: Girls riding sticks like the Daicon short sword-riding, Gunbuster time dilation, a boy and a girl in front of a red sky and ocean a la EoE. But it was all just a dream, and the characters had to wake up in the end, go their separate ways, and move on with their lives. <br><br><br>Kinda fitting for Gainax' last anime.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127336799 <br><br>Found two spelling errors.</br></br>  Fuck it, final version, with a simpler explanation!  <br>that pretty much is a gas giant<br><br><br> 30 jupiter masses <br>that thing would fuse deuterium, i.e. be a brown dwarf</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> which was MUCH farther away than any other solar objects <br><br>Astronomy 300<br> what is the oort cloud? </br></br></br></br>    <br>The sexiest.</br>  RIP Gainax  <br>Why Gainax hates Aoi?<br><br>She never watched the meteor shower.</br></br></br>  <br>It's going to happen  in the OVA </br>  <br> mfw told people show wouldn't be as mediocre as the OVAs because they had a lot of potential <br> was right </br></br>  Thank you, Gainax.   1997 <br> 2015 <br><br>What happened, Gainax?</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because most Gainax shows were mostly only worth watching for the animation and story was mostly neglected but it's the other way round this time.</br>  <br>You go the years wrong. Should be:<br> 2015 <br> 4000000000 BC </br></br></br>  I only watched this anime mindlessly for relaxing purpose without checking threads on 4chan. What are these "nanako 13" and physics stuff?   ONA 6 <br> TV series 9 <br>How'd they do it?<br><br><br>Read the charts in this thread/archive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nanako 13 is Nanako's episode. A lot of people like her so they liked the episode. Also its the episode where FTL travel is introduced and there's a lot of relativity going on so the show moved to higher physics</br>  The Subaru BRZ looks really nice. <br>Seems kinda cheap for how it looks too. I wish I had one.</br>  <br>Even now I want to lick Hikaru's thighs.</br>  <br><br>Get in line.</br></br>  <br> FTL travel is introduced <br>The whole point of that it's not FTL.</br></br>    <br>As in solar objects we actually care about</br>  <br> not caring about the Oort cloud <br> not caring about Sedna, Orcus, Varuna, Quaoar, etc <br><br>You are the reason they are all sad and lonely.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm already rewatched 7 episodes of it and I will finish it today.<br>Favourite episode was either the final episode or Nanako 13.</br></br>  <br>typed it in a hurry, sorry.</br>  So I heard something about a artbook being released in August but can't find where I can possibly pre-order it<br><br>Is it not up for pre-order yet?</br></br>  <br>Search 放課後のプレアデス デザインワークス(仮) on jp Amazon.</br>    <br>Beginning of Evangelion</br>  <br>You start caring about those objects once they come hurtling towards earth</br>  <br><br><br> What is your favourite episode /a/? <br><br>po-warm episode because i'm not a paedophile.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is your CPU?</br>  <br> implying  <br>This is a family friendly show.</br></br>  <br>Half the plebs in this thread fapped to Hikaru, and Aoi and the shotas.  Because shotas are flat right? </br>  <br>I only masturbated to Minato, and only the handsome and charming grown-up Minato.</br>  <br>Nanako is my favorite but I haven't masturbated to any of the Pleiades yet.</br>  Just a reminder<br><br/></br>  read the guide for questions: buyfag.moe  <br>Karen the british slut when?</br>  FUCK  Never  It really doesn't look right, but I still want her. I might as well just get it  Cute as fuck  Anyone know of a decent display unit that would fit into a 24cm wide space?  <br>Her dress is too big she looks like an orphan child dressed in hand me downs</br>  <br>ikea</br>  <br>Horse pussy</br>  <br>It's the least awful Flonne that there ever will be so you might as well.</br>  <br>Ikea isn't a display unit.</br>  <br>I'm really mad about how much the price of figures have gone up in the past couple of years.</br>  <br><br>The price is different bu you're paying almost the same with how weak the yen is now.</br></br>  <br>It still seems like more, but outside of importers, how about domestic buyers?<br>Their main market is getting screwed with having to pay a lot more, although, i'd say the quality of figures have gone up as well as the prices at least.</br></br>  I have a question for you guys on something I'm conflicted about.<br><br>I want to buy the manga of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, but can't read nip for shit, and doubt I ever will.<br><br>So why do you guys buy manga that you can't read? I'm conflicted about buying it because I wouldn't be able to read it, but having it would be nice. Even if it would just sit on my shelf.<br><br>Is buying it worth the fact that I can't use it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's the least awful Flonne that there ever will be so you might as well. <br>Don't be so honest with me it hurts, the nendo was alright</br></br>  The following release dates have been confirmed:<br><br>Shipping out from GSC on the 7st July 2015:<br>Good Smile Company - Nendoroid Plus Trading Rubber Straps: The Rolling Girls<br>FREEing - Sayaka Miki: Yukata Ver.<br>FREEing - Miki Hoshii: Yukata Ver.<br><br>Shipping out from GSC on the 13th July 2015:<br>FREEing - Kagamine Rin (Senbonzakura)<br>FREEing - Kagamine Len (Senbonzakura)<br>FREEing - Kagamine Rin &amp; Kagamine Len (Senbonzakura)<br>FREEing - Dynamic Change Shin Getter Robo<br><br>Arrival at wholesale stores on the 13th July 2015:<br>Good Smile Company - Nendoroid Plus: KanColle Straps - 5th Fleet<br><br>Shipping out from GSC on the 16th July 2015:<br>Good Smile Company - Nendoroid Umi Sonoda</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Karen nendo would make my heart explode.</br>  <br>The main purpose of a raincoat can't be utilized when there's no rain, but that doesn't make it useless to own on clear days.</br>  <br> I'm conflicted about buying it because I wouldn't be able to read it <br>This is something that you can do something about, you know.</br></br>  <br>Learn moon, faggot.</br>  What is the quality on WING figures normally like? Closer to main GSC or FREEing?  <br>Buy it if you can appreciate it sitting on a bookshelf. I see it as buying official merchandise. Go for it if you like the series and it's at a fair price.</br>  It begins. Hopefully.  <br><br>You want to read it?<br><br>Get in in english.<br><br>You want it just to have it in your collection?<br><br>Get the Original Japanese version.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A good Karen scale would make my dick explode.</br>  <br><br>What does that have to do with Racing?</br></br>  <br>Horse racing Miku?</br>  anyone get a payment e-mail for her yet? i'm not dying to have her, but she's holding my june order back  <br>When it comes to that era of figures, you gotta take what you can get. I have Daiki's Mint, and her face never stops looking a bit wrong...</br>  <br>...but it's nothing compared to Koto's version.</br>  <br>I will never own that whole set.</br>  <br><br>how awful</br></br>  <br>Pic related is the designer</br>  <br>I laughed more than I should have.</br>  <br>She looks like that character from Onechanbara</br>  <br>Maybe GSC is gonna sponsor a NASCAR team.</br>    <br>What retard drew this. The race queens wear the design. Why would you cover their entire ass and back and make them wear that heavy shit and awkward half dress.</br>  <br>She's a wholesome Christian racing queen.</br>  <br>sauce of that bike?</br>  <br>It came with a Silver Surfer toy ages ago. It looks pretty rad.</br>  Even if she's at Wonfes, I guess she won't actually release till next year at the earliest.  <br><br>I'd buy a Texan stereotype Miku statue.</br></br>  <br>That movie was retarded</br>  <br>Yeah, that why I asked, thanks for the info anon<br>It will looks much better if you painted black or silver</br></br>  <br>I haven't watched it yet, don't plan to. I just happen to own many dinosaurs.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/list/<wbr>35369<br><br>Is this seriously every single male nendo? Most of it is western, vidya, or fujoshit.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Just like most of female nendos are moe shit.</br>  <br>Define moeshit.</br>  <br>Well yeah maleshit is for scum.</br>  <br>true, but dinosaurs.</br>  <br>Who were you expecting?</br>  <br>something you look at and think "shit, that's moe"</br>  <br>I didn't say it was bad</br>  <br>So it's a good thing?</br>  <br>I don't know what you want and I don't even think you know what you want <br><br>What are the male characters that you want nendos of?</br></br></br>  hiscore girl nendo announced, yet next to no capcom or snk nendos to be found  <br>I have a combination of the 3. It's cool I guess, but if I had more space I'd dedicate my display to more helves with spotlights shining down on them. I have the spotlights, but I just haven't gotten around to installing them.</br>  <br>This likely sounds pretty fucking stupid but I think it'd be nice to see some of the Jojos in nendo form.</br>  <br>Impossible, Bandai owns the JoJo rights.</br>  <br>  jojo <br>  not fujio bait <br>But yes I want some too. Sadly we will never get any.</br></br></br>    <br> it's hard to find non-popular male characters that has not been sexualized by fujos</br>  <br>You're right, it does sound retarded, they would look horrible in chibi form.</br>  it's july already where the fuck is my chitoge  <br>I mean popular character</br>  <br>Can't wait.

Never. They all bin. Every single one of them.</br>    Lewd.    <br>Anyone buying figma today is an idiot. They are overpriced shit. They came with more stuff when they were half that price.</br>  <br>I want some hand holding nendo hands but the only characters that come with them are shit.<br><br>They should just sell them separately.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, fuck Patrick!</br></br>  <br>Quality has gone up and with what yen is now, you'd be able to buy something ~20% more expensive now compared to a year ago so I'd say that the only thing that has changed is the quality going up despite the seemingly higher price numbers.</br>    <br>That looks dope. Why the horse though?</br>  <br>The line got better though, some of the new figures are much better than the old ones. Saber 2.0 looks like a must have for figma/fsn fans. <br><br>I do agree that the pricetag is getting ridiculous though. I'd understand if they released a very detailed sculpt or something out of their comfort zone (like a mecha) for 6k, but a little school girl with little to no accessories for 6k is really low. And let's not forget their whole exclusive webshop shit too.</br></br></br>  <br>Horseracing?</br>    <br>The yen is 25% weaker than what it was in 2008. The quality has gone up a fuckton since then too. GSC and Aniplex are the only companies with merch booths on overseas cons. Their increase in price is reasonable. <br><br>But fuck their "exclusive faceplate/glasses for only 4.5k more" is complete and utter bullshit.</br></br></br>  K-Onfags, what's the best Yui scale in your opinion?  <br>None because I don't own any of that piece of crud.<br><br>DOWN with Yui. UP with everyone else.</br></br></br>  <br>Alter's.</br>  <br><br>Finally best girl getting what she deserves</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck both of you. Mature women should have pubic hair. If you want to fuck little kids, then go abduct a gradeschooler.</br></br>  <br>Don't many Japanese buyers flip figures shortly after buying them, since they're just buying crap to support a series?<br><br><br>And cost of manufacturing has shot up a great deal.<br><br><br>Alter, followed by Kyoani. Either way you're committing to getting an entire set of Keions. Except for Azuza. You don't need Azuza. Nobody needs Azuza.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mature women should have pubic hair <br>Yes, but in this case, Lala is 16.<br>Do mature artists even draw pubic hair?</br></br></br>  <br>Lala's an alien though.

I don't even remember ordering these anytime recently so these have been sitting in my closet for at least 2-3 years now. <br>Have you ever bought something and completely forgot about it?<br><br> I'd post pictures but I'm on my way to work so I can't; was pretty surprised that I found some random nendos but not surprised enough to be late </br></br></br>  Does anyone else think her face just looks fucking weird?  Surely tomorrow will be the day right?  <br>I can't even remember that fags name</br>  <br>I do. Tatsuta is my favourite boat but there is no good figures of her, all of them look stupid and not like her at all.</br>  <br> University undergraduate tutor bang daughter and wife. <br><br>Get both in the end, win-win.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow she looks great. Why is there no nendo of her?</br>  <br>To some</br>  <br>Because people have shit taste and almost no one likes her, and those who do like her sister even more. Poor Tatsuta.</br>  <br>It's not great but it's the best so far and I like the look of Tenryuu's figure. So I might just get her so the two are together.<br><br><br>There's medicchus of Tenryuu and Tastuta and that's it. I'm still hoping every time some new nendos get announced that it's these two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I thought the movie sucked, don't know why my friend liked it.</br>  <br><br>That sucks she has a great design. The only shipgirl I enjoy as a nendo so far is shimakaze and the abyss girls.<br>I wish the poi girl would get a nendo too.</br></br></br>  <br>I only watched it because of that picture that was posted.

They're okay I guess.  </br></br></br>      I wonder if all the LL training nendos will get hand holding as an extra so at the end they can all hold each other. Would be cute. Surprised that its not a bonus.  <br>I think that's what they're aiming for.</br>  <br>wheres your proof faggot?</br>  <br>Oh I guess it was more than 8.</br>  How much do 1/6 Alter stuff cost this year?  <br>Disgusting</br>  <br>It's fun to pose them and take pics though.

Is his dad into incest traps?</br>  <br>Apperantly  his dad and sister forced him to wear girls clothes when she was little. </br>  <br> His sister liked to dress him as a girl when he was little. </br>  <br>I don't have any official art where their Di-Swords are visible, but doesn't the hilt of Taku's sword not have an eye on it?<br><br>Well, one can play the 2deep4u game until one is sick of it, so I hop you'll have fun in your autism.<br><br> she </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a tradition to lead misfortune away, yes, but he's not a child anymore.</br>  <br> Kurisu in Miko <br><br>I NEED MORE</br></br></br>  <br>My mind and  my dick  is confused about that matter.</br>  <br>What kind of place do you work in, anon?</br>  <br>He is a homosexual male, there is nothing to be confused about.<br><br>Are you a homosexual male?<br>If the answer is yes, I wish you two well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm happy to oblige. She looks beautiful in it.</br>  <br>I work in a court.</br>  <br> He is a homosexual male, there is nothing to be confused about. <br>Which looks, acts and sounds like a girl.</br></br>  <br>Once I rented out two rooms to weebs for two semesters and slept on the couch. Scenes like this were common where I'd play Japanese VNs on the PS3 and explain the gist of the story while one roommate built gunpla (or in this case the Muv Luv Takemikazuchi).</br>  <br>Please don't judge me for my tastes.<br> Do you get it, judge me? </br></br>  <br>I don't know if it's an eye. I thought so, but doesn't it it look more like an arrow?<br><br>And thanks. I know I will.</br></br></br>  <br>Announcements when?<br> Please. <br><br>We went over this so many times, I'm tired of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it looks like an eye, but after digging out this CG here, I know better.</br>  <br>I  do  get it.</br>  <br>I get it, anon.<br><br>Also, why the hell is this thread moving so fucking fast? Are meme OPs really that effective?</br></br></br>    <br><br>It looked like an Imperial Eagle to me for some reason.</br></br>  <br>Japanese wiki says that the original Di-sword designs are based on flowers.</br>  <br>There is no fist on Takumi's Di-Sword though.<br><br>Because now we have actual discussion about hidden symbolic meanings on Di-Swords.<br><br>I can see it, but if it's a Reichsadler, it doesn't have a head.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why flowers?<br><br>And who is what flower?</br></br></br>    <br> it doesn't have a head. <br>I can't quite see if there is even something in the middle because of the light though. It might just be that I'm blind too.</br></br>  <br>You do me a great favour. Though, what the hell is that. Explosion? Radiating light? I've no idea. <br><br><br>Hmm. That's very interesting, though I'm not sure how that translates into shapes like that of Rimi's or Nanami's.<br><br>Also, does that mean I'm correct in thinking that Nanami's got a tulip in the centre of the crossguard?<br><br> googling tulip symbolism <br> see this: http://www.proflowers.com/blog/hist<wbr>ory-and-meaning-of-tulip</wbr> <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know one person most definitely buying it, a bro that may be buying it and another with a very slim chance of buying it. May buy a second copy for someone though.</br>  <br>Incest being perfect love is nothing new.</br>  <br>Why do you have to ruin everything?<br><br><br> Still waiting on that copypasta. </br></br></br></br>   wake up <br> see this <br><br>What do?</br></br></br>  <br>Stop having delusions.</br>  <br> KURISTINAAAAAAAAAAAAA </br>  <br> I want to wait for the anime to be honest. I'd like to not spoil people with a copy pasta. You'll get it one day. </br>  <br>I know, it's just kind of hilarious if that's what they had in mind when they put it in the middle of the sword that's a manifestation of her delusions.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Wouldn't that imply that Nana subconsciously craves oniichan's dick?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Took you long enough to realize, isn't it plain obvious, that Nana wants her Onii to love her?</br>  <br>Well duh, of course. But loving your onii is not equal to LOVING your onii.</br>  <br>She wants him to give her a good bang le </br>  <br>She loved her Onii, but started LOVING (as you put it) the man who she thought was her Onii.</br>  <br>Who thought the buying of the fake Di-Sword would have such far reaching consequences?</br>  <br>Okay, that would make sense.<br><br> I WANT DUAL AND I WANT IT NOW </br></br></br>  <br>Moeka a  best.

Fuckin' Kevin.</br></br>  <br>I hate and love her.</br>  <br>W-what if it's C;C?</br>  <br><br>Thought Dual was confirmed for not happening?</br></br>  <br>Kevin once sent me an email that had<br> 'sent from my blackbury whatever' <br>Fucking hell Kevin, get with the times.</br></br></br>  <br>That was at the end of the mail, too. I just cropped it out.</br>  <br>Then I would be disappointed. I want an actual explanation for all the shit in, and conclusion to, C;H before moving on. not like it's actually gonna happen anyway.<br><br><br>Nope. All they've done is keep giving us hints that it could be happening.</br></br></br></br>  <br>C;C is not understandable without Noah and Chuchu.</br>  <br>Donations to get Kevin a good phone when?</br>  <br>What the hell Kevin?</br>  <br>I vote we get him a Droid Turbo. I love mine.</br>  <br>Are we making an unaffiliated PQube employee a sciADV meme now? I want FUCKIN' KEVIN to become the new ROBOTS.</br>  <br>Is it okay to start the hype engines? To which velocity should I set it?<br>Noah?<br>Dual?<br>Darling?<br>Elite?<br>Child?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some where between Noah and Dual. I doubt they'd do a Child release before Head</br>  <br>I want my CHUCHU now.</br>    <br><br>I think they could pull it off, with the anime coming out somewhere at the time.</br></br>  <br> Retweeted by PQube <br>So, NoaH, eh?</br></br>  <br>I don't know if it's just my country, but blackburys have been dead for years, any phone would be better.<br><br>I will happily blame any localisation or delays on fucking Kevin from now on.</br></br></br>  <br>Steiner retweeted it too.</br>  <br>They're pretty dead in America. It's either Droid or iShit out here.</br>  Wait, wait, wait<br><br>https://twitter.com/5pbgamesUSA/sta<wbr>tus/613420318762254336<br><br>If this is true, are we gonna have a licensing battle between PQube and 5pb America?<br>I know that this may speed the releases, but the quality may suffer because the different translations.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  That R is a blight on the otherwise most perfect picture of my husbando.  <br>That's a girl, baby</br>  <br>FUCK OFF HE HAS A PEEN AND DON'T GIVE ME NO TRANSGENDER BULLSHIT HE KNOWS HES A GUY AND ACCEPTS IT HE AIN'T NO HIPSTER FAGGOT HES JUST A FAGGOT.</br>  <br>There wouldn't be a licensing battle because 5pb. USA is a direct extension of 5pb. They'd win every time. Blick and Steiner aren't with 5pb either, so the translation would be different.</br>  <br>Settle down, Brohan. There's nothing wrong with liking girls.</br>  <br>They won't do a shitty insider translation, will they?<br>They will hire Steiner again for the job, yes?</br></br>  <br>Blick and Steiner are freelancers, they can be with whoever they want.</br>  <br>If Steiner was going to be on it, he would've probably been contacted by now. And he clearly isn't due to a tweet he made to 5pb.<br><br><br>Right but 5pb isn't as likely to hire them because they're Japs and don't know their western reputation. Japanese people are apprehensive, too, so they'd probably pick their own people like that Italian chick they used to poorly sub the Steins;Gate movie.</br></br></br></br>  So we will finally get all SciADV, but in the most terrible ENGRISH imaginable?<br><br> Despair </br></br>    <br> PQUBE does C;H, Chuchu, R;N, C;C with Steiner and Blick <br> 5bp do all the S;G related shit with   Zakobot or shit inhouse </br></br>  <br>Would not fucking mind. Hell, I could even put up with my husbando's name being misseplt with an R if it meant all other sciADV being uncontaminated.</br>  <br>Sounds fucking awful.<br>Zakobot's a cunt anyway.</br></br>  <br> my husbando <br> husbando <br><br>We went over this already</br></br></br></br>    <br>I ain't some kind of... straighty, alright?</br>  <br>I don't mind Renri and Phenogram's translation to be bad, but I do mind Zero's translation, because it's canon.</br>      C;H looked really interesting to me at first with all the murder stuff, but these characters with all their stupid looking giant fantasy swords really turn me off. Can anyone tell me what the deal is with them?  <br>How about you play the game and find out?</br>  <br>It's all explained and reasonable.<br>Explaining it here would spoil it.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather just know now instead of buying or downloading it.</br>  <br> reasonable <br><br>Hmm.</br></br></br>  <br>S;G looked really interesting to me at first with all the time travel stuff, but these characters with all their stupid looking hacked together gadgets really turn me off. Can anyone tell me what the deal is with them?</br>  So let me get this straight.<br>PQube are confirmed to release another SciADV game this year, we just don't know which for sure?<br>Is that right? That's fucking exciting.</br></br>  <br> The swords are delusions. </br>  <br> gadgets literally do nothing <br>I don't want to play something with an interesting premise that ruins it with generic magic shit.</br></br>  <br>There. Thank you. Now that makes it look a whole lot more appealing.</br>  <br>The swords are not magic, it's set in the same universe as Steins;Gate.</br>  <br>5pb. USA is not a direct extension of 5pb. It's a publicity front run by another company, Strangely Compelling Media. Yeah, they localized Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds, but they're not a subsidiary of 5pb.<br><br><br>PQube didn't retweet that. They follow the guy's account because he's an employee.</br></br></br></br>  <br> gadgets literally do nothing <br>The entire story of Steins;Gate revolves around Future Gadget #8.</br></br>  <br>But it's VERY strongly suggested to be either Noah or Dual. I guess C;C is possible too, but extremely unlikely given the circumstances.</br>  <br>The only gadget that does anything. Literally created by accident.</br>  <br>Still a gadget, assmunch</br>  <br>He's a  girl in my worldline. </br>  <br>What is even your fucking point?

Could Infinity4 be intentionally made to look like it, then?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Easily.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure 4infinity was first, although the countdown is a recent thing so I'm not so certain anymore.</br>  <br>It has also the PSP ending theme</br>  <br> It has its own opening, exclusively made for the Vita version. <br>What? Since when? Link?</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure it was confirmed several threads ago the Vita version had PS3 OP ( Hisenkei Geniac ) and PSP ED ( Preghiera no Tsukiyo ni )</br>  <br>That's what I thought.</br>   lukako couldn't even fill in the right lottery number <br><br>Holy shit, how can one person be so useless</br></br>    <br>Damn, I like this one.</br>  <br> microwaves bend space time <br><br>holy fucking shit</br></br></br>  Good news for pleb Americans<br>http://www.ricedigital.co.uk/na-ste<wbr>insgate-release-date-anime-expo-boo<wbr>th-na-el-psy-kongroo-edition-exclus<wbr>ive-rice-digital/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Ah, I ordered the European version because I thought it would be my only shot at the Metal Upa.<br><br>It still hasn't arrived either.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fucking damnit.

No regrets.</br></br></br>  <br>No, because they've actually read it. Unlike you.</br>  <br> non-stop may-may vomit <br><br>Sorry, were you talking about Steins;Gate or your post?</br></br></br>  <br>Luka had porn before the anime existed.</br>  <br>"Hoping" to release something means that it's not coming out in time.</br>  <br>That's kind of terrifying.</br>  <br>Right, but it also confirms that they are in talks and do intend to release something. That's really good news, it means more SciADV in the west is completely confirmed.</br>  <br>What part of hoping to release is unclear?<br>That is not a verification or proof of anything.</br></br>  <br>It's someone from the company who officially said they are "hoping" to release another title in the series and will have more info next month. That's definitely better than the nothing we were mulling on the last few months. Plus with all the hinting from Blick, Steiner and even some PQube employees we know something's gonna come of it.</br>  <br>Sure it is</br>  <br>You do realise that "hoping" is just a phrase that means "planning on", right? At this point in time, the game's translation is near-complete, they know there's a substantial fanbase ready to purchase it, and deals for the rights have already been struck up. It would take a catastrophy to stop the game from ever being released now.</br>  <br><br>More like they are waiting for sales report of the S;G before deciding if the project is getting axed or not.</br></br>  <br>But we already know that Steins;Gate has been selling well. That's all PQube has been talking about lately.</br>  <br>We've had a European sales report for over a month now, and given that PQube is a Europe-based company, it's probably gonna be released in Europe first again.</br>  <br> we <br>I see, so that's how it is.</br></br>  <br>Went there. The answer is yes. Cicadas, and in some areas, crows.</br>  <br>What does El Psy Congroo even mean?</br>  <br><br>It doesn't mean anything.</br></br>   tfw fapped to all scanned Luka doujins in existence <br>No homo, btw</br>  <br>The psychological Congo</br>  <br>I didn't mean it like that. Everyone and their grandmother knows that both sets of the EPK edition sold out before the release date even arrived, and that the regular edition and digital version has been selling like hotcakes ever since.<br><br>By "we've had a sales report", I meant that "everyone knows how well it's been selling".</br></br></br>  <br>Keep it away from the psychological Belgium.</br>  <br>I'm kind of proud of myself for getting this joke</br>  I made a short list of some of the problems with the dub a while back:<br> localising all the Jap internet references as Reddit memes  <br> giving characters lines almost doubly as long as their original, forcing every other character in the scene to speak as shortly as possible, or even speak over each other in some cases  <br> giving characters voices that aren't anywhere close to their original - most prominently Daru, who's meant to be a creepy otaku, the most ostentatiously American, fast-paced voice in the cast, combining with the le epic Reddit memes he now constantly spouts, to make him sound like a dudebro  <br> lazily just getting rid of some terminology, like "PhoneWave (Name Subject to Change)" and "Celeb 17", because they couldn't even be bothered to try and localise them  <br> getting terminology mixed up, most infamously getting the most core plot element wrong in probably the most important scene in the show  <br> "R"uka, "C"ongroo, Kiry"uu", the list of spelling mistakes goes on </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Okabe and Kurisu referencing Takumi, someone they don't know or would have no reason to know.<br><br> most infamously getting the most core plot element wrong in probably the most important scene in the show  <br>Which part was this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that anon is talking about when Okabe is talking with Beta Suzuha in episode 23, he gets the attractor fields mixed up. He refferes to Beta as Alpha, if I remember correctly.</br>  <br> giving characters lines almost doubly as long as their original <br><br>This didn't bother me with Okabe, honestly -- especially since he's supposed to be pompous and verbose. It makes sense that his speech would be filled with fluff.</br></br></br>  <br>Kiryuu isn't exactly wrong, is it? It's usually localised with the single accented u but that just stands for a long sounding u also shown as two u's.</br>  <br>But her name is Kiryu, not Kiryū. I think they have different meanings when not used as a name.</br>  <br> localising all the Jap internet references as Reddit memes <br>This I can pardon. They didn't have to do that in the VN translation since there are annotations and notes in the game that would let someone unfamiliar with 2ch culture figure out and understand each reference. It makes sense that they would handle the dub differently since they don't have that luxury.</br></br>  <br>Sure Mr.community manager, what ever you say.<br>We all know how it sells like hotcakes.</br></br>  <br>How did they localize the "tsundere" stuff?</br>  <br>Yeah, but they could've had a little more tact with it. We all cringed when Okabe said "Therefore, the cake is a lie!" because it was horribly outdated, but now that S;G is really popular, you can bet that some newfag is gonna watch it in 2021. By then they're not even going to get why him proclaiming the cake to be a false existence was intended to be funny at all.</br>  <br>They removed it.<br>Here's a direct line from Daru in the dub where he originally called them both tsundere.<br>"They're the OTP in the fanfic I call my life."</br></br></br>  <br>When/where do they reference Takumi?<br>Haven't watched the dub myself, just wondering.</br></br>  <br>They replace the "Nullpo..." "Gah!" scene where he catches Kurisu browing @Channel with.<br>"Neidhardt's been pretty active lately..."<br>"Yeah."<br>I get they were trying to make a little nod, but they fucked up big-time because it makes no logical sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They fucking didn't. It was really fucking disgusting how the script was changed in my opinion.</br></br>  <br>Yeaahh.. Dont think that either Kurisu or Okabe play ESO.</br>  <br>Yeah, they don't.<br>Hell an entire plot thread of Steins;Gate 8-bit (non-canon "sequel" game set post-True End) was that Okabe had no idea who Neidhardt is.</br></br>  <br> I still don't know what they meany by nullpo. </br>  <br><br>It could have been worse, I guess. But changing the script like that is generally the worst.</br></br>  <br>It's a Japanese meme about Javascript.<br>It's short for Null Pointer Exception.</br></br>  <br>Btw, wasnt it Knight-Hart? Atleast in the version/translation of the VN that I played (C;H, not 8-bit)</br>  <br>Secondary confirmed<br>Or atleast you didn't read the tips.</br></br>  <br>But why is it there? What relevance does it have to that scene?</br>  <br>Blick and Steiner use Neidhardt der Blitzschnelle, rather than "Lightning-fast Knight-Hart". It's that way in the official Steins;Gate release too.<br><br><br>Saying Nullpo on 2ch/@channel is followed up by a gah. He says it in the hopes that Kurisu will instinctively say Gah to out her as the memer she is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a meme, Okabe said it to confirm that Kurisu is a true shitposter</br>  <br>I did play the official S;G game some months ago, C;H only recently tho, from <br> mofumoe <br>Guess thats why the tips werent translated either.</br></br></br>  <br>W-what</br>  <br><br>Oh! I always thought it had something to do with the actual plot at that moment. I thought they'd come to a sudden realisation about the proprietary code or something. It makes sense now.</br></br>   you will never have a genious neuroscientist girlfirend to shitpost with <br>Why live?</br>  <br>I ask myself this question every day and I still don't have an answer</br>  <br>There is no point Anon.

She'd never put it in her butt and would never let it go anywhere near her puss, but she had to have been curious as to what a big dick was like and simply didn't have time for dating since she was so absorbed in her research. So sometimes, on her way back to her apartment, she'd just stop in the ladies room, knock on the wall, and pop goes the weasel, you know?<br><br><br>That makes her even more perfect, though</br></br></br>  <br>Vita TVs are super cheap if money is an issue.</br>  <br>A friend of mine also mentioned Vita TV.<br>I'll look into it.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but how much are those running for now?</br>  <br>A quick search on Amazon gives me $40.</br>  <br>They often go on sale for $40.

Also that Spellcasters outnumber Dragons.<br><br>Either way, that's about as expected.</br></br></br>  <br>Another one.</br>  <br>If she were Serena or Yuzu should of been good enough to wall jump.

In Zexal Kaito establish this against Jinlong and saying something like strong duelist guide their cards. In GX manga, Judai's luck affect even his opponent's draw (that Angel almost defeat him if she draw a monster card). <br><br>Then we have Jounouchi who, well, gamble. That's why Kaiba dissed him so hard. But I do love it when he and Valor beat the shit out of each other. We were like "is this a card game anymore?"

I did most of the Dojos and the extra stuff all at once. <br>I cant remember if she gave a reason for Saber, or does she just understand him genetically because he is a sword and she uses swords?<br><br><br>But she has Sakura beat in others.</br></br></br></br></br>   not even a single shot of Shirou at his butler job <br> no Flat cameo <br><br>ONE JOB UFO<br><br>ONE JOB</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait Luvia's voice actress also voiced Kanzaki? This makes her better.</br>  <br>Ah yes, based UTW. Thanks anon.</br>  <br>But Shirou doesn't become Archer.<br>Start paying attention</br></br>  <br> Itou Shizuka is a wonder. <br>I like her when she is doing cute stuff.</br></br>  <br>make sure to get the second season come october or november from them</br>    <br>Reminder that Luvia is going to lose.</br>  <br>Rin best attribute seems to be her ass, why does she looks like she has no ass in here?</br>  <br> comic relief character <br> relevant <br>I love her too, but c'mon</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rin and Sakura are only similar though. But Sakura is more seductive underneath it, so she is the real maneater of the sisters, according to Nasu. A fair competition of them vying for Shirou would be pretty intense. <br><br>But it will be like when they let their guard down and their masks go off in Hollow. They did such a wonderful job of showing Luvia vs. Rin, imagine if ufotable amped up the drunken little sisters competition, where Sakura turned Rin into onee-chan sludge with imouto cuteness.<br><br>Or better yet, have Luvia, Rin, and Sakura in the same room together, and watch the European tigresses come out as their masks fall at once. My duck couldn't handle it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well you have notMikiya who will reject Ayako in a foreseeable future.</br>  <br> Rin best attribute seems to be her ass <br>And thigh.</br></br>  <br>Why does Ayako want notMikiya anyway?</br>  <br>Because you are a nigger.</br>  <br>because she's notRyogi</br>  <br><br>Truly the best ass and legs.</br></br>  <br><br>They don't want you to blow your load too much. They have you Rin/Shirou overdose, they gave you Luvia, they gave you Waver. <br><br>They want to savor the hype.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nevermind what I was going to say. This sums it up perfectly.</br>  <br>The episode burned me out.<br>It was just perfect and I feel sad that UBW end now.<br><br>That older Rin</br></br></br></br>    <br>I keep rewatching it, I don't want it to end. ;_;</br>  <br><br>For the Fate route, Ilya herself said she would be there for him. Which was Nasu's way of hinting she'll likely survive somehow to guide him.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't even make sense.</br>   tfw slightly worried they're not gonna be able to fit all the best tracks on the second OST <br><br>As much as people gave the music some shit early on, I really want to listen to the next album. There's probably two CDs worth of great stuff for season two alone.</br></br>  <br>Get used to it and enjoy the superior HEAVENS FEEL MOVIE</br>  <br> Or better yet, have Luvia, Rin, and Sakura in the same room together <br>Only would have happened if she wasn't a Matou. What could of been.</br></br>  <br>Q: Will Ayako ever have a boyfriend?<br><br>A: It seems like she wants to find one, but it also seems like she wants to stay single as long as possible... Miss Mitsuzuri is still fully interested in maidenhood, so she’ll probably be shot down soon after she enters college. By a young man suited to black-rimmed glassses, harmless to man and beast. ...I think I’ve seen a photo of those two somewhere...</br></br></br>    <br>No.</br>    <br>I really hope they do more than one movie for it.<br>Even a three hour runtime can't do that route justice.</br></br>  <br>I still don't understand how people think they won't do more than one movie at this point. I'm expecting 3 minimum.</br>  <br>Why is she so insecure around Shirou?<br>She should be more confidant in her sexiness.</br></br>  Do you think she laughs like that during sex?  <br><br> But Sakura is more seductive underneath it, so she is the real maneater of the sisters, according to Nasu. <br><br>That reminds me of when Shirou and Rin imagined everyone in maid outfits. When they got to Sakura, Rin was cutely angry at him imagining her sister that way, but also acknowledging Sakura would have no trouble doing (and succeeding) with romantic roleplay, and forbids it.<br><br>It's telling that she mistook the future version of herself in the Zelretch box scene as Sakura playing a joke. Rin knows.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it obvious?<br>She's a girl and Sherio is a boy.<br>She's not very familiar with Sherio and lacks of pleasing old men for money experience unlike Rin.</br></br></br>  <br> the drunken little sisters competition, where Sakura turned Rin into onee-chan sludge with imouto cuteness. <br><br>I refuse to believe this happened. It sounds far to ridiculous.</br></br></br>    <br>Because 3 is the maximum amount of movies you can reasonably do.<br>And even the middle one wil be shit/boring</br></br>  <br> 3 is the maximum amount of movies you can reasonably do. </br>  <br>For HF.</br>  I'm not content with that last episode<br>I want more ;_;</br>  <br>They did a movie for each part of KnK. HF isn't nearly as easy to split as that.</br>  What will it take for Case Files to skip ahead until post-FSN so we can get some London shenanigans?<br><br>-Waver being a grumpy weeb<br>-Butler Shirou<br>-Flat meeting Shirou and being retarded <br>-Moar Luvia<br>-Moar dere Rin<br>- Rin and Luvia being NTR'd by Gray <br><br>Just do the fucking casino story already Nasu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because of what? The slow buildup? KnK didn't start feeling like it had a story until movie 5.</br></br>  <br>Because HF is unbelievably flat and boring in the second act. With three movies, the second one will be dud as fuck, affecting the success of the third and ironically best one.</br>   That slap fight <br>Goddamn Type-Moon is so much better when it's being silly</br>  <br>A personal problem for multiple movies would be the massive blue balling I would get waiting the months between movies. A week for UBW was hard enough and if they're great it'll be even harder.</br>  <br> Her bust is slightly too big for her top <br><br>Stop it, dick.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There are a dozen different things that happen in that time span. The people who say it's only cooking are dumb. What days are you including in this "second act"? Because the only slow part was day 11, and even that had really great Sakura/Shirou relationship development, with Distant Twilight.</br></br>  <br>Movies aren't TV. They have to back beginnings and ends. If they wanted to be looser they could have just gone with OVAs. Can you figure out a way to split HF up into a 7+ series like KnK?</br>  <br>This<br>I can forgive them for making UBW grimdark shit to appeal to zero fags</br></br>  Why is he so perfect?  <br>Best fight in the show</br>  <br>You know less about them so they are harder to hate.</br>  <br>The four or five days in which nothing happens but Shirou think about Sakura, cry a little, go help Rin and Ilya, cry some more, then bum around the house doing nothing until Sakura comes to eat Ilya.</br>  <br>Shirou, Flat, Luvia, Rin, and Gray.<br><br>Either the best team ever, or completely disfunctional nonsense.</br></br></br>  <br>Flat would make Rin grind her teeth to dust from sheer irritation at his mixture of ridiculous magic talent and total bumfuck retardation. He'd probably get along with Shirou though.</br>  <br><br>I really think your grasp of the route is confused, because there is never four or five days of Shirou moping. Shirou doesn't even find out Sakura is Rider's master until day 9.</br></br>  <br>I played it once, two years ago, and it bored me to tears. Sue me.</br>  <br> There seems to be something wrong with Sakura, I'll ignore it til something really bad happens. <br><br>This felt extremely out of character. What the fuck,Shirou?</br></br></br>  <br>I'd have to read the HF again, but sure. <br><br> They have to back beginnings and ends. <br>If people know there's it's a series of movies in the first place then they're gonna expect a conclusion in the last movie. If they really feel like it's a problem, then they can just release them weeks apart like a lot of anime movies that have similar goals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Daily Reminder that If this Holy spear is destroyed Humanity will lose it's dominance of the Earth.</br>  <br>I think he's confused about the middle section of HF where the readers have all figured out that Sakura is Rider's master and responsible for the Shadow but it's another 2-3 days in the game before His Magnificent Denseness figures it out and gets the story moving again.</br>  <br>Everyone gets along with Shirou, except Shirou.</br>  <br>It's okay, Gray can just show it to Shirou and he can make another one.</br>  <br> nothing ever comes out of Shiro/Rin meeting Gray because she always covers her face with a cloak <br>That poor girl El Melon 2 is heartless.</br></br>  <br>It's actually pretty funny that he completely rejects his older self, yet his final opinion of Kotomine is "We gotta kill each other because reasons, but dude's alright."</br>  <br>Not even KnK did stuff weeks a part. Most got put out over the span of a year.<br><br>The point is to create something compelling that's worth attending in a theater and doesn't just feel like it was an episode of a TV series that you spent money to watch.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He had a feeling, but didn't know how to go about finding out about it, much less doing something about it. You have to remember he has good acute senses, but is pretty bad as a magus. Rin didn't understand the situation until later either. It was Ilya that kept the important info about Sakura secret. We find out it was to carry out her duty as the lesser grail.<br><br>Also please don't encourage the guy who hardly knows what he is talking about please. He pretty much admitted he didn't care if he remembered everything wrong but still calls it shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, they won't. Rin leaned over the table to push Shirou forehead is now canon.</br>  Ass is fattttttttttttttttttttttttt. DAMN  <br><br>And you have to remember that KnK was redone in several ways to make it work as a series. So if they plan to take a 20 hour route that is much longer than UBW, and condense it into a theatrical format, than of fucking course the way it's presented will be different.</br></br>  ARA ARA<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rLa<wbr>XYE0NO_U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>And the question is how do you properly recut it?<br><br>Like for instance, the rain scene is an obvious one to end a movie on. What if you want to stick a movie or two between that though?</br></br></br>  <br>Can we get some god damned Luvia doujins already Japan? I mean, I enjoy jerking off to Rider as much as the next guy, but throw some fucking variety in already.</br>  Disgusting secondary here, was the Holy Grail War big shit or not? Seems like there was a power jump going to Uni  <br>I wonder if a non!Matou Sakura would've fallen for Shirou while watching him high jump.</br>  <br>Gotta love the boobcheck counter</br>  Honestly I kinda wish they would just heavily retool HF into a sequel to UBW, and make it more about Rin and Sakura then Shirou Sakura.<br><br>But then you get fucked with no Illya and Kotomine.<br><br>I mean you could probably bring back Illya through mage nonsense, but Kotomine is too important.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Small to moderate.<br>It's not the craziest thing to ever happen, but it still gives you some street cred.</br></br>  <br>It's a big enough thing, but the Clock Tower is snobbish and people there only care about what's going on immediately around them.</br>  <br>It was a big deal in terms of what could have happened, but hardly anybody knows about it. <br><br>Modern civilization ended, but since most magi didn't even know what was going on, most won't even think about it. The Grail War was regarded as an obscure ritual some families got involved in every half century or so, but otherwise flew under everyone's radar.</br></br></br>  <br> Modern civilization ended <br><br>Shit, I meant "Modern civilization COULD HAVE ended".</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>then what the fuck counts as "a big deal"?</br></br></br>  <br>Anything involving Aoko, Melty Blood stuff, petty mage politics</br>  <br>Luvia's tits.</br>  <br> then what the fuck counts as "a big deal"? <br><br>Something people actually fucking know about.<br><br>The three families weren't exactly running fucking ad campaigns for the Grail War. They only created the other four Master seats when they realized three wasn't enough, but the idea that the competition was supposed to be fair and open to all was never there originally. They needed four schmucks to summon four other Servants, so they made up all that bullshit about the "Holy Grail".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A Dead Apostle appearing <br>A Dead Apostle disappearing <br>Zelretch poking his head in</br></br></br>  <br>Zelretch showing up at the end of Heaven's Feel and the destruction of the ritual itself all counted as major events at the Clock Tower.<br><br>Other big incidents are probably mostly about Apostles.</br></br></br>  <br>DAA not DA, right?</br>  <br>Arcueid</br>  <br>Yeah sorry<br>The church cares about dead apostles but the mage association probably only cares about the important ones.</br></br>  <br>They did care when Kerry's dad's research made a new vampire.</br>  <br>Well the Heavens Feel is the Third Magic, so it's more that it is a big deal that people just don't know about.</br>    <br>Kiritsugu's dad had a sealing designation on him because his work was getting closer and closer to become fruitful which when it comes to making vampires/immortality, is a pretty big no-no for the Church and the MA</br>  <br>The association was after his dad way before that/</br>  <br>Yeah, Heaven's Feel is a big deal but them blowing up the grail isn't that big of a deal.<br>After HF, there's no doubt that the Association started delving into everything that happened in the war.<br>UBW, they don't get close to "muh root" so they don't give a shit but it's different when Ilya makes shit happen</br></br></br>  <br> hungry Saber and Red Arc <br><br>How horrifying.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a big story.</br></br>    <br><br>Dirty Red.</br></br>  <br>what the fuck is she saying?</br>      <br>That's the Solar Plexus. Medulla is part of the brain.</br>    <br><br> Luvia handled Rin's combo better than Caster <br><br>How?</br></br></br></br>  Tohsaka Rin is a woman without any natural human kindness.  <br>OOOOOOOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO</br>  <br>Do you expect Nasu to know this shit?</br>  <br>No luvia doesn't show up til fate hollow</br>  <br>Stop being stupid. They even say it in the fucking fight.<br>Modern-day mages have to know hand to hand fighting skills because magic is weirder in current times<br>Age of the Gods was just balls to the walls magic fights everywhere with no time for fistfighting</br></br></br>  <br>Rin did hit her in the head though. The one making the mistake here is you.</br>   Implying it didn't just end in hate sex one day. <br><br>The real question is who had he magic dick.</br></br>  <br>In Caster's age mages were strictly mages. No close quarters combat aptitude at all. That's the only reason Rin was able to land hits on a Servant.<br><br>Luvia, however, is a modern mage like Rin, so hand-to-hand is beaten into her from a young age. The fact that there are proper Self-Defense classes in the Clock Tower should be your biggest hint at that.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't imagine how buttblasted Caster if Luvia went wrestling on her.</br>  <br>Luvia gets one line at the end of Heaven's Feel.</br>  I think a big part of the appeal of ponytails/twintails is how nice they look when they come down.  <br>Really? What was it I don't recall this at all.</br>  <br>No, you got the wrong screencap.<br>And it would be ufotable, not Nasu.</br></br>  <br>It was her saying Rin should be her maid. It was in the epilogue.</br>  <br>To be buttblasted one would have to be conscious. The last thing Caster would know is the sensation of being carried by her waist.</br>   forklift lady was finally animated <br>almost makes up for completely bungling the rest of the route.</br>  Can Luvia beat Rin in naked wrestling?  <br>And voiced by Tamura instead of Itou, so it's not completely obvious that it's her.</br>  <br>Gap moe is a vast and fantastical plane.</br>   beautiful blonde Swede grill <br> only wants to racemix <br><br>Every time.</br></br></br>  Why does Luvia make retarded sound effects such as 'OHO OH HO' and 'ARA ARA'?  <br>Because they're arousing.</br>  <br><br>Nope, Nasu said the Grail War isn't a big thing like you make it out to be.<br><br>All the smart, actually powerful people avoid it because they sense a scam.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can beat to Luvia and Rin in naked wrestling.</br></br>  <br>What a gorilla onna</br>  <br> swede <br><br>But that's wrong you retard</br></br></br>  <br>Otaku fetishes.</br>  Rin still lost to Luvia despite delivering blows to the stomach and head.<br><br>Luvia confirmed true alpha.</br></br>  Does anybody have a picture of the new Ryougi figure?  Am I just missing it or did we not actually get a ohohohoho in the epilogue?  <br><br>Never mind, found some.<br><br>My dick is very hard, seeing this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Instabuy for me if I saw it in a store<br><br>Even better than the Rin one</br></br></br>  <br>We got ara ara~ instead.</br>  <br> Not wanting The Red Girl </br>  London, somehow not having shitty weather all the time.  <br><br> Instabuy for me if I saw it in a store <br>I'll be pre-ordering.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait a fucking second.<br><br>THE SWORDS ARE IN THE WRONG HANDS</br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br>  <br>welp. there goes money i cant really afford to part with</br>  <br>Yeah, we'll just get 10 minutes of it at best. Season 3 never.  ;_; </br>  <br>How long were the Fate/Zero drama CDs?</br>  <br>Well now I'm not getting it. Thanks</br>  <br>17-19 mins. But remember ufotable are Hebrews now. Faggots counted the soundtrack to the run-time of the first BD box, wouldn't surprise me if they went all "yeah, Drama CDs!" fucking 8 minutes per story. We'll get Clock Tower, Archer's monologue and Shirou saying "trace on" eighty times.</br>  Reminder there's a Fate fighting game where you can play as Luvia.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=c0_<wbr>VspNN9iY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Are you even looking properly? They're in the right hands.</br>  <br>The Rin figure has the right hand on the black sword and left hand on the white sword. It should be the other way.</br>  <br>Oh, the figure. Woops.<br>I'll show myself out.</br></br>  <br>Someone post a webm of that slap fight.</br>  <br>Gotta love Rin's post-HF look. She almost has the same aura about her as Touko.</br>    <br>Thanks.</br>  Luvia is the only good thing about fate shit.  <br> Shirou treats Rin like a cat <br> Those two fight like cats <br>Adorable</br></br></br>  <br> tfw literally Excalispear </br>  <br>Rider is too perfect for Shirou.</br>  <br>It's called Rhongomiant faggot.</br>  <br>look up ''fate kaleid liner prisma ilya''</br>  <br>Takeuchi needs to kill himself.</br>  <br><br>Why would Rin get NTRed? At the worst she'd have a rocking threesome to satisfy her gay urges.</br></br>  <br><br>And full of Nip-Speakers.</br></br>  <br> Luvia is calm while Rin is buttmad  <br>ohoho</br></br>    <br>She´s adorable.</br>  <br>SHEROU</br>  <br>Fuck you. Flat is the best girl and the superior choice. <br><br>He's like male magus Arcueid.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you really believe that bitch rhymes with adorable?</br>   based Nekosan <br>yes</br>  <br>Rin's left is white.</br>  <br>Wait a second...<br>With those kind of skills she could take caster out in 3 seconds and surely not be knocked out with one punch from kuzuki</br></br>  <br>Luvia is considered to be equal in everything that Rin is in terms of ability.</br>   Sex first before marriage   <br>Luvia is stronger than Rin.<br><br>Rin attacked Luvia's stomach and head and still lost to Luvia despite the fact that head blows usually result in KOs like in boxing but Luvia tanked that shit and wrecked Rin's shit in the end.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou <br> Not Shero <br><br>You had one job anon, just one</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did you two even read what he typed? He questions how Rin didn't take down caster quicker and lost to Kuzuki with a single punch and you start talking about Luvia.<br><br><br> you can stay over <br> assumes sex, pregnancy, marriage as a result <br><br>Pretty slutty there, Luvia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was the question? If that's the case then it's because this takes places two year sin the future and RIn's gotten better.</br>    <br> Why are support characters so objectively better than main characters? <br>This applies to all media</br></br>   they made her a rhino too <br><br>God damn it.</br></br>  <br>They enhanced her man face more then anything. The profile shot that comes later is bad though.</br>  <br>I like her design here but I still prefer the Prisma one.</br>  <br>Primsa makes her look fat as hell. Original design is better them all.</br>  <br>M-muh dick</br>  <br>Not a Luvia fan but she doesn't look fat at all. Does the best job out of all the iterations of Fate in actually making her look feminine as well.</br>  <br>Tits and asses are made of fat. The Prisma design also has the best hips by far.</br>  <br><br>I prefer her with boots on.</br></br>  RIN A BEST!  <br>Did you mean Otoko?</br>  <br><br>I don't like the colors in Prisma. I feel like they're too, I don't know, saturated?</br></br>  <br> tumblr <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  hnnnnnnnnnnnnng  <br>I think it is more washed-out.</br>  <br>I don't understand why they'd go throw the effort of adding this as a cover page to the script.</br>  <br>To ram home to fans that yes, they fucked.</br>  <br>Not everything must be sexual</br>  <br>Fans wouldn't have seen that had Udea not tweeted it.</br>  How much money could Shirou make by projecting video game swords and selling them to /v/?<br><br>Can you even mail yourself, swords, in the first place?<br><br>Has anyone tried before?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably knew she'd post it, or even asked her to.</br>  <br>Pretty sure the Association would go after his ass for abusing magic.</br>  <br><br>Don't think /v/ isn't into being buyfags.</br></br>    <br>Better project Tolkien weapons and sell them to /tg/</br>  <br>They would go after his ass in any case if they will learn about his ability.<br>It's both unique and way broken to just allow him to move freely.<br>Although i don't think that anything but Bazett-tier combat mage will even be able to scratch him if he went serious.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou isn't part of the Association and they can't do shit to him.<br><br>Association is in a 3 way stalemate with Middle East and Asia.<br><br>They aren't globally powerful like you think they are.<br><br>Association can't stop Shirou from selling swords to freedom loving Americans because they are Eurofags cucked by Asia and the Middle East in the Nasuverse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What would it feel like to be molested by Luvia?</br>  <br>Jojo is full of QUALITY, they said.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br/>  <br>Yeah?<br>Jojo looks decent enough animated too, your point?</br></br>  <br>Is this what happened during the 30 second sunset?</br>  Body built by daily sex  <br>REMOVE GORILLA</br>  <br>Point is you're signaling out a frame in an action shot.</br>  <br>Depends, in your case that would happen when you take of your pants.</br>  <br>College Rin is a miracle of the universe</br>  <br>so the last scene was just symbolism right? so he is still with Rin in clocktower for 3 years and after that he gonna make hero shenanigansis?</br>  <br>Yes and Rin follows him.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Yeah it's symbolic, Because he looks down, sees the spot where Archer stopped and keeps moving forward with a fake smile full of hope.</br>  <br>Only if luvia is the mc.</br>  <br>It's canon that Shirou goes on vampire hunting dates with Luvia on a casino riverboat.</br>  <br>Exactly, that's the point.</br>  Did Shirou and Rin have sex at least? Because it didn't look like that.  <br>Y E S<br>E<br>S</br></br></br>  <br>How can you be sure?</br>  <br>Are you blind?</br>  <br>They had sex before Shirou wrecked Gil in the VN.</br>  <br><br>Explain.</br></br>  How strong is Shirou compare to the other mages at the end of UBW?  <br> Filename <br><br>Fucking kek</br></br></br>  <br>That's not what I asked.<br><br>That's just art.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the script cover for episode 25.</br>  <br>Bazett levels.</br>  <br>Right after the end of UBW he's still not experienced to take on a serious opponents.<br>After mastering UBW and getting Caladbolg and Hrunting? Lmao good fucking luck killing him, especially if he holds his anti-magic swords in hands.<br>Only specialized combat mages like Bazett will be able to stand against him, and only thing that will seriously stop him is his morals, if he didn't had those he could just rain someone with Hruntings from afar.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, art.<br>Not to mention they aren't even fucking there.</br></br>  <br>Kicking a baby/10, just use basic mind control magic and it's the Caster scenario all over again.</br>  <br> Naked and embracing each other <br><br>I guess they're just waiting on their laundry.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you giving credit to a secondary source like the cover of the episode's script when there's a primary source like the VN?<br><br>Are you guys retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>It can't be more obvious.<br>https://data.archive.moe/board/gif/<wbr>image/1435/49/1435492063164.webm (embed)</wbr></br></br>  <br>Nasu penned all the anime original stuff in this episode. It's his script in the first place, and on the cover of that script is a picture of a naked Rin and Shirou.</br>  Secondary here. Just wondering where Luvia ranks power level wise in the rest of the F/SN cast  <br>Don't forget that Shirou is also a tactical genius. Catching him on mind controlling spell won't be easy and against direct magic attacks he has his chinese swords.</br>  <br>she is equal to rin.</br>  <br>She's a modern day magus. Pretty low just like anyone else who isn't a servant.</br>  <br>You wish.<br><br>Again.<br>Do they fuck in the source material at this point or not?<br>Answer this and nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Shiki also saying the KnK movies will be better than Tsukihime's if Ufotable adapts it like that?</br>  <br>In the original VN? Yes, they fucked the night before fighting Gil.</br>  <br>Isn't Rin fairly powerful herself? Then where does Rin rank?<br><br><br> So where does she rank with everyone else?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Again. That's not what I asked. Why do I have to keep repeating myself?<br>Do they fuck in London at this point in the source material or not?</br></br>  <br>THIS WAS ANIME ORIGINAL ADDED BY THE AUTHOR.</br>  <br>Nigger all the London shit was anime original.</br>  <br>Almost nothing about London is described in the source material. The novel ends with them still in Japan.</br>  <br>I dunno anon, would a couple that's obviously in love not make love to each other?<br><br> That means yes. </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Why are typemoonfags so retarded?<br>Is it implied in F/HA that they regularly have or have had sex in London before the beginning of the story?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kid's gotta sleep sometime.</br>  <br>Above Tokiomi level combatant.</br>  <br>This shit was like, the first time we've gotten /anything/ on London. I don't think you understand how big of a deal this episode was in a meta sense.</br>  <br>F/HA is a fandisk and isn't a continuation of the original novel to begin with. If you weren't such a retard, this conversation could have ended with your first post.</br>  <br><br>So there's no source and you can't tell if they have sex or not from the anime.<br>Thanks for the indirect answer.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes anon, clearly Rin and Shirou are pure chaste Christians who haven't even seen each other naked despite living together.</br>  <br> you can't tell if they have sex or not from the anime <br>If you need to explicitly be told something to understand it then let me explicitly tell you to fuck off</br></br>  <br><br>It's not implied in any way.<br>If that was the intention of the writer then he's shit at what he does.</br></br></br>  So is Luvia supposed to be a Swedish Finn? She dresses in Swedish colors, her name doesn't sound Finnish and she doesn't act like a stereotypical Finn at all, I mean where the hell is her knife.  <br><br>What the hell? A FAN made F/HA? Meaning it's somewhat noncanon, right? So a fan's work became slightly more canon when the anime acknowledged it's existence? That certainly is impressive.</br></br>  <br>That they are a couple living together and very comfortable with each other?<br><br>Yeah of course they didn't fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>You are so new.</br>  <br>God, you people are stupid.<br>You really think I don't get that? Who the fuck do you think I am? Some demented that somehow retains teh ability to post on the internet in a language different from his original one?<br><br>The point is that from what we've seen you can't clearly say that they are fucking. Doesn't matter what's probable or not and how much that is. You can't say that for sure. Stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never claimed to not be</br>  <br> A FAN made F/HA? <br>Please stop</br></br>  <br>If she was Finnish she'd look asian like rin, I think she's Swedish</br>  <br> Some demented that somehow retains teh ability to post on the internet in a language different from his original one? <br>Yes.</br></br>  <br> Swedish-speaking Finn <br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>  <br>Seeing as they fucked in the VN before this point and in H/A they did it after this point I would say the answer is yes. Shirou may be a lot of things but he isn't gay.</br>  <br>Could Shirou beat them in a fight?<br><br>assuming he uses his swords</br></br></br>  <br>Again, I don't claim to know these things, which is why I'm asking</br>  <br>UBW Shirou is Bazett level of course he is going in dry.</br>  <br> Shirou <br> Bazette level <br>Bazette would destroy shirou. Her combat skills far suprass his and she always has fragarch if she really needs it.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you really are stupid, because not only that's impossible but it isn't even funny to answer like that after I said so myself.<br><br>That still doesn't give any certainty.</br></br></br>  <br>It's implied that they are fucking but it wasn't shown, there happy?</br>  <br>I never said he was above her, but in the same plateau as her.</br>  <br> Shirou <br> with a female he supposedly loves <br> not jackhammering <br>I don't think you understand Shirou very well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's not implied. Stop repeating yourself.<br><br>From all I've seen is a limp fag.</br></br></br>  <br> No, it's not implied. Stop repeating yourself. <br>It is when you have a couple living in the same dormitory, sorry.</br></br>  <br> No, it's not implied <br><br>You're retarded, just stop posting.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't know what to imply means.</br></br>  <br> From all I've seen is a limp fag. <br> Never read the source material <br>I'm sorry you need to be shown curtains or waves to draw obvious conclusions.</br></br></br>  <br> to indicate or suggest without being explicitly stated <br>Okay.</br></br>  <br>When you imply you give a certainty. This is not the case.<br><br>Never seen Shirou taking the first step in all the anime. Limp dick.</br></br></br>    <br> Shirou's true waifu <br>Wrong pic</br></br>  <br>Mollusks and jackhammers.</br>  <br>but kirei is his husbando</br>  <br> When you imply you give a certainty. This is not the case. <br>No you don't, read the damn definition and go eat shit.<br> taking the first step in all the anime <br>Not even that anon but you are also full of shit, at least watch the anime before shit posting.<br><br>I am done.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you should reread the definition.<br>Unfortunately I've watched all the Fate anime.</br></br>  <br> Implying Kotomine isn't his husbando &amp; waifu </br>  Everyone loves Shirou<br><br>Anyone have the updated version of this?</br></br>    <br>Why is Bazette or Karen there? They pretty much exploit Shirou the one time they actually meet. They only care about dressing him up like avenger.</br>  <br><br>What is Rin standing on?

Doesn't Caster have at least E?</br>    <br>Rin buffed herself up plus she knows how to fight, it's clear advantage. Honestly I doubt E means anything more than peak human.</br>  <br> Those umbrellas </br>  <br>E means 10times as strong as human.</br>  <br>All the ones that have actual artwork in Tsuki/KT<br> Arc <br> Ciel <br> Akiha <br> Hisui <br> Kohaku <br> Aoko <br> Yumizuka <br> Arihiko's sister <br> Len/Ren <br> Akira <br> Sion <br> Miyako <br>I think thats pretty much it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Did trying over and over to climb up some children game made 3 (three) girls want Shirou's dick?  <br> Kirei and Shirou fighting over who get's to keep Illya <br><br>Nice. I always forget that Kirei is pretty Bro in HF.</br></br></br>  <br>Where is the citation on that? If that's True then Rin had to buff herself 10+ times as strong as a human, knowing martial arts was what gave her the edge.</br>  <br> For sake of argument, let's assume that a normal value is 1. In that case, E would be 10. And, every rank after that adds another 10, all the way up to A, which is 50. <br> Now, things like B+ and A+ represent the unique ability to multiply these numerical values for just an instant. <br> In other words, an ability ranked B+ would normally be weaker than an ability ranked A, but can momentarily exceed it by doubling its own power from 40 to 80. <br><br>Caster has 10 times human strength, 20 times human Endurance and 30times human agility.<br> You're kinda underestimating Rin. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> E is 10 times human something <br>But it doesn't say that anywhere.</br></br>  <br> let's assume that a normal value is 1. In that case, E would be 10. </br>  <br>   You're kinda underestimating Rin. <br>How so? Are you suggesting that she buffed herself to D-C rank strength to bypass Caster's C endurance?</br></br>  <br>But that's just someone's bullshit<br><br> Parameter Rule <br><br> A set of rules for representing the rank of a particular status. They range from A~E. EX is in a league of its own, representing powerful to the extent of rendering comparisons meaningless. If we assign numbers to ranks, then E=10, with each subsequent rank increasing by +10. Ranks with “+” such as A+ and B+ can momentarily multiply its associated numerical value. For instance, C+(30) can temporarily boost its power to 60, exceeding Rank A (50). Also, “++” represents multiply by three times. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But that's just someone's bullshit <br>Literaly Fate/Side Material<br>http://tmdict.com/en/ha.parameter-r<wbr>ules</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Bear in mind that the norm is 1, a particularly strong but nonmagic human would be a 2 or possibly 3.</br>  <br>I'm missing info here<br> Newfag blah blah i know <br>Is this from the Vita game or is there an anime on the way?</br></br></br>  <br>nigger</br>  <br>Are you for real?</br>  <br>Yeah there's a sequel coming for 2018.</br>  <br> In other words, an ability ranked B+ would normally be weaker than an ability ranked A, but can momentarily exceed it by doubling its own power from 40 to 80. <br><br>So what's a minus mean, then? Like Archer's C- in Orthodox Magecraft? A flat minus to the skill, or some kind of indication that the skill is actually lower but is being buffed by something external?</br></br></br>  <br><br> They would go after his ass in any case if they will learn about his ability. <br><br>Only if he keeps passing it off as projection.

I've been wondering this forever and I've been losing hair trying to figure this one out. Please help me and give me an answer! &lt;Lord Baldy&gt; <br> Nasu :That's a tricky one. A minus sign is like that one thing, you know? It's like a B in terms of rank, but for your ability it's less than a B, maybe even a C. Something like that. Think of it as a number that's not very stable. Also, take care of your hair. <br> Takeuchi: I see. Kind of like when a new game you've been waiting for causes your writing speed to become unstable. <br> Nasu:A clear, perfect example, thank you... Please be gentle to mushrooms. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thankyou<br><br><br>Troll harder you useless cock-socket</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, that's how it goes.

Kirino a literal best, objectively speaking. To be fair, though, the only bad girl in the series was Manami.</br>  <br>someone has creepy, disgusting, indecent-in-public tastes<br><br>Like seriously I hate it enough when tsunderes get any affection from the mc, but for the bitchdere to be his sister too and he still chooses her over everyone else?<br><br>Why was that ending even allowed? Kuroneko, Ayase, and Manami tears had to fall. Their smiles left unprotected.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Translating into a made-up alien alphabet <br>I hate this meme.</br></br>  Is there any consolation to this super terrible sister ending?  <br>You didn't even get her name right you dingus</br>  <br>I have dyslexia</br>  Why would someone so obviously against incest watch a show called My Little Sister Can't be this Cute?  <br>I was rooting for her all through season 1!!<br>until he dated kuroneko...but then she dump him then I was back to rooting for her all through season 2!!</br></br>  <br>Her presence in S2 was pretty fucking minimal. You could tell by that alone that there wasn't going to be a Manami ending.</br>  <br>Fuck Manami. She a cunt. I'm sad for the others, though. Kuroneko a cute. Kirino was just more important to him. Rightfully so, too.</br>  <br>It actually hurt to see Kuroneko screaming in anguish. Her rejection was by far the worst.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EA2<wbr>mKbl_L5k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Literally the only thing Manami did wrong was having morality in a show that pandered incest.</br>  <br>it wasn't adapted in the Anime and non-LN fags never knew they got together in the first place</br>  <br>I know. She loved him. Made me sad.</br>  <br>But her ship sank for the sake of a relationship that the producers didn't even have the balls to go all the way with. A shame. By the end, I actually liked Kuroneko</br>  <br>Never even bothered with the garbage, but why the fuck are people this assblasted over a siscon ending of a series called: MY LITTLE SISTER CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THIS CUTE?</br>  <br>Yeah, I wish the plot twist never happened. Felt like they just said loljk the whole point of the show was a meme xD. I don't dislike the way it ended, but I would feel happier if they kept with it. <br>I just can't say no to a qt3.14 that buys her brother a minifridge and an eroge as housewarming gifts. Literal perfection. That level of trust that they had makes me feel warm inside.</br></br>  <br>my nigga</br>  <br>Because they made the sister an unlikable bitch, and every other girl introduced was better than her in every way</br>  <br>I know that OreImo was dealing with the whole incest thing in a more mature way than Yosuga No Sora, but I kind of want to see what would happen if Kirino and Kyousuke pulled the same shit, and ran away after Kirino graduates from high school. I'm sure Kirino would have enough of a nest egg at this point to set them up for a while, at least long enough to find employment</br>  <br>The anime butchered her personality, she was a much more likeable character in the LN</br>  <br>Literally only good for doujins.</br>   no one remembers Dutchguy   <br>That's what I was hoping for. They don't need society telling them who they can't love. They were deeper than that. I felt so many feels when she said yes. How can you watch that scene and not want them to do what makes them happy?</br>  <br>Manami will get over it and marry me!</br>  <br>No one WANTS to remember dutchfag. Don't mention his name, he might show up.<br><br>But it's a reality we will never see, unfortunately. <br> Imagine a crossover </br></br></br></br>        <br> I won, eat shit normalfag <br> I don't have any more gifs of the fight, BUT I DO HAVE THIS <br> A really shitty webm <br> Oh god why did I save this </br></br></br></br>  <br>Ayase should have won.<br>Fixed</br></br>  <br>Nigga, incest is my shit.</br>  Did someone say Kirino thread?  <br>I dont get why a rips on kissanime. It's pretty convienient.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about the content of the webm, i'm talking about the quality of the webm.<br>That scene is probably my favorite in the entire series, but i have a shitty webm of it.</br></br>  <br>Would Kyousuke and Kirino canonically make babies?</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Is Yosuga worth a watch? I'm a shitter when it comes to starting new shows. I'm amazed I manage to watch anime at all.</br>  <br>Unlike Haru and Sora, they have a good chance that their kids won't be fucked, gene wise. So i can assume they tried.</br>  <br>Watch it and read the VN. They're different enough to consume both.</br>  <br>You're absolutely right.</br>  <br>The healing will begin when you accept her victory.</br>  <br>It wastes time for the first 8 or so episodes with "what if" arcs with other girls, and the incest is pretty rushed, but it's overall a great watch, and has some fantastic fucking music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HnV<wbr>NYIyE2hs</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EFE<wbr>R3VRV27A</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lJh<wbr>i8tX-RP4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>explain</br>  <br>I like being butthurt. Bitching about shit is more fun.</br>  <br>Haru and Sora are twins, so if they tried for kids, there is a pretty high chance they would come out with some kind of deformity<br>Kyosuke and Kirino are merely siblings, so the chance for deformities is fairly slim.</br></br>   tfw not an incestfag and still liked oreimo <br>Kirino best girl.</br>  <br><br>Thanks p/a/ls. What about the OreImo LN/VNs? I only watched the show because Kirino is everywhere.</br></br>  <br>I can't say I blame you. It is more fun to talk about things you hate sometimes.</br>  <br>Kirino on being the best girl.</br>    <br>The Oreimo anime is butchered badly, the LN is a lot better.</br>  <br> English <br> you <br>Also no.</br></br></br>  <br>Not sure about the VN, but i really enjoyed the LN. I'm currently doing the PSP one for shits and giggles, but i know about the whole twist on Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship, so i'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.</br>  <br>I like how she warms up to the idea of Haru and Sora going out it in the VN.</br>  <br>Sisters should always be devoted and loyal.<br>Best sisters are best.</br></br>  <br> should of <br>Fucking Americans, when will you fucks learn to English?</br></br>  <br>It's true, the what if arcs are pretty wasteful, especially considering none of the other female characters are particularly engaging.<br><br>I don't understand why they left that little town though. Everyone found out about and agreed not to discuss the relationship. They could have lived in that house, and spent their days together in quiet peace. Honestly, when I think on it, that town was probably the most Zen place I've ever seen depicted.<br><br>But no, let's travel to a foreign country where we don't speak the language and try to start up there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It truly is, now if you excuse me I gonna go to a raildex thread and call Touma a faggot some more. Good day.</br>  <br>Read the LNs.</br>  <br>VN it is implied they'll go back and I hear in the extension of their route they might try to open their family's business back up.</br>  <br>It would have made any interactions with their friends unbelievably akward, and they probably didn't want to hurt them any more than they had. Look at how Kozue reacted. Who's to say someone wouldn't be even more radical in their reaction, tell someone, and that would force Haru and Sora apart?</br>  You think all incest stories have a happy ending? Go read Kana Imouto, you happy fuckers. See if you're still smiling by the end of that<br> My heart still hurts </br>  All endings are shit endings. Things must not stand still.  <br>Anime haru was better than VN haru.</br>  <br>how long is it</br>  <br> Implying it was an American <br>Thou art not worth of this thread  faggot. <br><br><br>I remember reading the first volume and became a Kirino fag before the anime and all that shit.<br><br>I didn't pay attention to the incest thing, just liked them as a couple. Kuroneko too, but she lost my support when she broke up with Kyousuke.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the issue with KA?<br><br>It's got a mobile site with direct html video links, there isn't much not to like</br></br></br>  <br>About 8-10 hours or so. And it's nothing but pain, pain, less pain, and more pain.</br>  <br>That's good to hear. I think in time, the village would rationalise it as coping with the grief of the loss of their family.</br>  <br>wish me luck</br>  <br>Is there more Manami-chan in the LNs? Not giving her an arc in s2 was an unforgivable crime</br>  <br>You will be feeling the pain for a LONG time afterwards, anon. But godspeed.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks. May you all be blessed with kawaii DTF imoutos in your next life.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I am asking.</br>  <br>I always felt a little sorry for the other chick in that VN. Even if she drunked you up and sorta kinda raped you </br>  <br>The anime was not that far from the LNs though. You are not missing much about Manami anyways.</br>  <br>I didn't have time for Yumi, i was too busy  making sure Kana didn't suffer </br>  <br>Hopefully one that will run away with me</br>  <br>Oh, I didn't realize it was a visual novel</br>  <br>Yep. Fun fact time, it was also my FIRST VN ever. Fucking hell of a place to start</br>  <br>Damn right.</br>  <br>Manami is the Squealer of Oreimo.</br>  <br>Japan is too fucking good at piano</br>  <br>Squealer was doing everything right until he lost the war against those inhumane psychics that should all burn in hell</br>  <br>You say that like it's a bad thing<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Hfr<wbr>jSHd3wgo</wbr>  [ ]<br>But seriously, the entire YNS soundtrack is fucking god tier</br></br></br>  <br>I liked that one bgm from the VN that plays when Sora walks out barely clothed much to Haru's horror.</br>  <br>My favorite is probably the one from the anime, where Haru watches Sora masturbating while calling his name. It drove me fucking insane trying to find it.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EFE<wbr>R3VRV27A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  how easy is it to blow a load to kio kaze as compared to.. oreimo?  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Eq0<wbr>Tiuix3tY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The start menu theme from VN is nice too.</br></br></br>  Only retards like Kirino  <br>What do you mean, blow a load? Koi Kaze is a lot cuter than oreimo, and has a better ending, if you ask me?<br> Plus the fact that the doujin's are canon, that is something i like. I actually think they were done by the mangaka, if memory serves me right </br></br>  <br>4th from the top.</br>  I think Kirino would have been better as a yandere in the anime. Would have fit, given how abusive she was.  <br>third chapter never.  I still want to hurry up and waste that stardust one out of my mouth by finishing it too </br>  HN5 when?  <br>Win what?<br>A retarded moron called Kyousuke?<br><br>Perhaps if you hate Manami.<br><br>In fact both MC were awful, they deserved each other and now the other girls are free.<br><br>I hated when the author ass pulled Ayase falling for douchebag mc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of want a sequel to pic related.

Lewd as the scene was, for some reason Sora was just even cuter than she usually was, quietly squeaking her brothers name </br></br>  <br>Companies have mostly stopped using glass for corrective lens for a while now. More than likely your lenses are going to be plastic, polycarbonate, or other similar materials. Those don't shatter the same way glass does.</br>  <br>Mine are glass, and they fucking suck to clean, unless I remove them from the frame. And god help me if it gets scratched</br>  Post Ayase's feet  <br>she must be a scat fetishist then</br>  <br>Nah, both of my pairs are glass. Someone hit me full in the face, and shattered them, and it fucking hurts, getting small glass shards in your face</br>  <br> Stop. My dick can't take any more. </br>  I wanted Ayase to cuff kyouske to her bed and force herself upon him  <br>Where the hell are you even from, did you not change your pair for years?</br>  <br> Man, that little minx just couldn't get enough of her brother's cock. I wonder how many times they did it before Not-Manami and the QT class pres caught them in the act? Do you think they continued afterwards? Give how Sora was all "Look at me, Haru. Only ever look at me", i think he would have had to fight her off. </br>  <br> I've been on the same 2 pairs for almost 8 years now. </br>  <br> If nothing else, at least it means your vision isn't getting worse. </br>  <br><br>Thread almost ruined. Only way it could possibly get worse is if Dutch showed up.</br></br>  <br>this is an imouto thread of course it's also a kirino thread</br>  <br>I love imouto threads. They draw all kinds of people in.<br>I remember that one anon who had practically raised his sister, since their parents were shit, and something about her getting in a car accident and telling him how much she loved him</br></br>  <br> all that unprotected sibling sex <br><br>too lewd</br></br></br>  <br> stoooooooppppp </br>  <br>Haru must have fought to keep her satisfied. it's a possibility that she was entirely Haru-sexual, and never even entertained the thought of going to another man for sex, but it's also a possibility that Haru just fucked her brains out every opportunity he got, so he didn't lose her.<br>Oh, the doujins write themselves. Too bad they don't draw themselves, too</br></br>  <br>That's one of my favorites.</br>  <br>All imouto threads are Kirino threads but not all Kirino threads are imouto threads.</br>  <br>Yes, she appears much more often. Everything is better in the LNs, and the anime butchers the most important plot elements. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</br>  <br>It's definitely one of the best oreimo doujins. Best ending, too, none of this "My Father and Little Sister"/"200 Day War" shit<br>A proper, adorable ending, for an adorable fucking doujin</br></br>  <br>You're right   and wrong since the LNs give her a different motive </br>  <br>Holy shit.</br>  <br>I've never seen the show and am more than content just saving cute pics and doujins, but have often wondered what was the cause of this scene. <br>Is it safe to assume that Kirino was being a cunt?</br></br>  <br>Kirino and Kyousuke tell Kyousuke's childhood friend about their relationship, Kirino and said childhood friend get in a fist fight over it, Kirino wins, as always</br>  <br>Kirino bragging to Manami that Kyousuke loves her even though they're siblings. To be fair, she was holding it in for a few years.</br>  <br>Manami gets full on butthurt and unleashes it.</br>  <br><br><br>Why were they punching each other?</br></br></br>  <br>Minami is a jealous bitch.</br>  <br>It's justified, but i almost believe Kirino deserved some kind of comuppance. She really was up in Manami's face about, literally.</br>  <br><br>Manami gets rejected, isn't willing to accept that her childhood friend will be happy with someone else, lashes out.</br></br>  <br>Because Manami is butthurt about losing, and Kirino is rubbing it in. Manami punches Kirino, Kirino punches Manami, both accidentally punch Kyosuke when he tries to break it up</br>  <br><br>Thanks, anons.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Cold-blooded, man. Glad I got to Number2's stories before knowing about this.</br></br></br></br></br>  Manami was the only sane and pure girl for kyouske <br><br>Everyone else had some sort of fetish and mental illness</br></br>  <br>Adorable.</br>  <br>Pure? She warps Kirino's tender young mind, and then orchestrates Kyosuke's fall into mediocrity. She was just as twisted and fucked in the head as the rest of them.<br>If anything, Kuroneko is the only truly normal one. Sure, she's chuuni as fuck, but otherwise she's normal</br></br>  <br>Did he ever continue?<br>Tell me.<br>PLEASE.</br></br></br>  <br> fetish and mental illness <br><br>That's real life man. I've seen the way my friends sisters act around them, it's not a stretch to think siblings can love each other.</br></br></br>  <br>I KNOW RIGHT</br>  <br>I don't think so. Kind of sad, I would have loved to see what happened.</br>  <br><br>Probably go caught up in real life now, like OHB. I certainly don't think I'd be here as often if there were someone I cared about.<br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>I keep hearing OHB referenced. What/who is it?</br>  <br>You're overreacting, so as that picture. She just tells Kirino that incest is bad and Kyosuke to calm the fuck down because he might hurt somebody if he's not careful. He grew up of course he wasn't going to be the same genki #YOLO kid forever. Manami didn't mold him to be some kind of dependable and boring loner like most Kirinofags make believe. He had friends and everything.<br><br>What's funny is that Kirino looked up to the hyper Kyosuke, but that personality never comes back, even at the end of the series he's still the same person Manami "molded" him to be.</br></br></br>  <br>He's  lurk more before you post again and embarass yourself by asking dumb questions, newfag </br>  <br> Pic related </br>  <br><br>I'm fucking kidding, relax</br></br>  <br> not all Kirino threads are imouto threads. <br>yes they are</br></br>   should of <br><br>Minamifags everyone.</br></br>  <br> same person Manami "molded" him to be. <br>Did we watch/read the same thing? The whole series is Kyousuke doing extraordinary things for his sister and others, which is exactly what Manami's molding intended to stop. <br><br>The end is no exception, where he kisses Kirino despite the more responsible option being letting their relationship go.<br><br>You have to be completely blind to Kyousuke's character arc to suggest such bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Much as i understand where you're coming from<br> minamifags everyone <br> minamifags <br> MINAMI <br><br>Oh my god, FUCK YOUR STREET SIGNS, CAPTCH</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both that image and your post are wrong.<br><br> Manami didn't mold him to be some kind of dependable and boring loner <br><br>She actually did. Part of her motivation was to protect him from himself, and in that she was right, but she also used the opportunity to influence him towards the low achieving lifestyle that she believed was superior and that she wanted him to have, so that (hopefully) he would fall in love with her.<br><br> that personality never comes back <br><br>It comes back to some degree. I don't know how you could believe it never comes back at all, Kyousuke literally says it right in the text. It sounds like you're explaining things based off of a few LN quotes and what you've read on /a/. Super Kyousuke is more of an on and off thing after his character development finalizes, where he learns to control his ambition and find a balance between being safe and normal, but still being passionate and fiery about what he cares about.<br><br>The point of Manami and Kirino's fight was to show how childish their grudge was, and how wrong both of their idealizations were. Both of them wanted different extremes of Kyousuke, but only Kirino was accepting of end-story Kyousuke as a person because, as she learned more about him when they grew closer, she realized he's just a human being, not the perfect guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kuroneko a shit. Worse than Manami.   like Manami the most out of the Oreimo girls <br> didn't want her to win <br>I just don't know man.</br></br>  <br>Dude knocked up his Imouto at least.</br>  <br>Not really. I think there's an anon recently trying to make that happen but nope. There have been a lot of Kirino threads that are simply Kirino threads.</br>  <br><br> Extraordinary things <br><br>He was a kid, a fucking kid. Saying Manami is the sole reason why he's not as proactive as he used to be as a fucking toddler is dumb.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't even what I was arguing, I suggest you reread my post. <br><br>His actions during the series indicate his reckless genki attitude very much did return, while you claimed he was the same person Manami molded.</br></br></br>  post lewd Kirinos <br>only they can save this thread</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127283606 <br> amifitinginyet xD </br>  <br>Sounds more like you than him.

Yes, I know there are people who actually speak like that, and they are also legitimately retarded. <br><br>This is why I don't read translations in Thai, fuck "speech" Thai is retarded, and "formal" Thai is awkward.</br></br></br>  <br> summerfag <br><br>Please, new or not you're pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't see how  is less of a "fitting in" post than </br>  <br>He went into legend as a hero.</br>  <br>Manami kuso</br>  Better ending coming through  People worship characters that did things far worse than Manami just because they happen to look cute, why can't we just like Manami?  <br>She made the incest end possible so she is alright in my book. A necessary evil if you will for Kyousuke's true end.</br>  <br>See, I mean, even the most die-hard Kirinofag has to realise the only reason the incest happens is because of Manami anyway.<br>Kind of funny really, if she didn't get involved and let them progress normally she could've gotten Kyousuke pretty naturally.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what she did wrong.<br><br>She's cute, kind, always lends her time, knows how to cook, and even has a bit of a dom side to her so that's hot</br></br></br>  <br>She is so obsessed with the idea of normalcy that she practically ruins Kirino's relationship with Kyosuke, and basically forced Kyosuke to become a filthy normy, just so he would fall in love with her, the queen of the normies. She did plenty wrong</br>  Bully the Neko  <br>Don't bully the Neko, she doesn't deserve it. Bully the filthy megane, she's earned her punishment</br>  <br>I thought Kyouske became a normal guy during middle school after forcing a female friend to go on a field trip then coercing her into a forbidden section where she gets injured, her parents get livid af, and she ends up moving away and he blamed himself for everything and died inside</br>  <br>it wasn't just Kyosuke's self hatred, Manami decided to stick her big fat stupid nose into it, and make him terrified to do anything more than normal</br>  <br>Guess I have to read the LNs then</br>  <br> Minami should of won </br>   tfw Dutchguy killed himself over this.   <br>Who was that again?</br>  <br>Manami tripfag.</br>  <br>How horrifying.</br>  <br>He went insane at the end and a few people made him so scared that he stopped being my friend and disappeared from the internet.</br>  <br>Being friends through the internet doesn't count as actually being friends.</br>  <br>wow.<br> mfw bf recognized him and started to chat with him on skype </br></br>  <br> ~40% <br> fairly slim <br><br> https://www.psychologytoday.com/blo<wbr>g/animals-and-us/201210/the-problem<wbr>-incest</wbr></wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>I found her annoying.<br><br> pick every option I can to reject her <br> still end up with her <br><br>She's like some succubus you just can't escape from.<br><br> Though she was pretty sweet in the 'MC goes insane from grief' ending </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That ending was the only time i could bring myself to like her. She was trying so hard for Taka.<br>This VN, man, i fucking swear.<br>The first ending I got was the one with Kana's recordings. Dear god, i cried like a fucking bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>That was never in the cards for her. <br>Kyousuke mentally associates her with his dead grandma. It's why she had so much influence over him.</br></br>  <br><br>Summer summer summertime <br>Time to sit back and unwind<br><br>Here it is the groove slightly transformed <br>Just a bit of a break from the norm <br>Just a little somethin' to break the monotony <br>Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be <br>A little bit out of control it's cool to dance <br>But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance <br>Give me a soft subtle mix <br>And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it <br>And think of the summers of the past <br>Adjust the base and let the alpine blast <br>Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme <br>And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime<br><br>Summer summer summertime <br>Time to sit back and unwind <br>Summer summer summertime <br>Time to sit back and unwind <br>Summer summer summertime <br>Time to sit back and unwind</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn. First end I got was the 5th one, the second intellectual ending. And that was painful enough.<br><br>The Taka goes crazy ending was probably the worst, but the Recollection ending with the recorder hurt me the most.<br><br> I'm still butthurt about the fact that Kana possibly leaves Taka in the "good" ending and am currently reading a fanfic to alleviate it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who was it that went full autism and did troll subs for an entire episode? Was it you or Dutchguy?<br><br>Is Dutch still tripfagging? I haven't seem him in any Oreimo thread this past year.</br></br></br>  <br>For the love of god, don't read the third installment of that fanfic. It takes everything, and crushes it in your hands. Just finish the second, and be done with it<br>I love this VN, i really do. It was my first, and will always hold a special place in my heart. But fuck me, it keeps tearing holes in me.</br></br>  <br>It's still the only one I've played. <br>I plan to try either Hoshizora no Memoria or Ikikoi next but I'm still not over Kana Imouto yet.</br></br>  <br>Me and I think his trip got leaked.</br>  <br> Minami should of won <br>As if I couldn't hate Minami more</br></br>  <br>This VN is nothing but pain. I hate it, but i love it. I'm like an abused spouse, it keeps beating me but i keep coming back</br>   Wanting retarded babies.   <br>Are you upset?</br>   Childhood friend <br> glasses <br> short hair <br>Can you even make a girl more shit tier than this? It's like the author tried his best to make a girl as unappealing as possible.</br></br></br>  <br>He said in another oreimo thread that his trip got permabanned. Don't know if that is how it works.</br>  <br>How does it feel to have the worst taste on planet earth?</br>  <br>Kirino looks like an aquatic salamander in this image.</br>  <br> disliking worst girl means he has worst taste <br><br>That's not how it works. Manami is empirically shit.</br></br></br>  <br>She has done nothing to deserve such spite<br><br>She was the nicest and least retarded of all the girls</br></br></br>  <br>I never said anything about Manami herself in that post, but two of the qualities he listed are GOAT and childhood friend has no negative consequences for any character.</br>  <br>You're right, I just assumed you were defending Manami.<br><br>I find nothing wrong with those qualities he described, but in Manami they all form into some perfect storm of shittiness.</br></br></br>  <br> <br>I still like Manami though</br> </br>  I'm just a sucker for motherly-type girls<br><br>Probably cuz my own mother used to neglect and beat me when I was child.<br><br>Yea</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, Manami never had any chance. Kirino is undeniably the best girl for Kyousuke and they are the OTP.</br>  <br>They're my OTP, They're perfect for each other.</br>  <br>Manami is the fucking WORSE. I hate her so much, that passive aggressive fakeass bitch. Kirino forever.</br>  <br>Manami is definitely the most unwelcome for porn.</br>  <br> Make all the bad things go away <br> Please don't leave me again <br> I need you <br>Something about desperate, yandere Kirino just makes my heart go doki-doki</br></br></br></br>  <br> Manami is definitely the most unwelcome for porn <br>How come her doujins are the best though?<br> I admit, the ones that had multiple girls were really great too, like those ones with LN-sized titles. </br></br></br>  <br> yandere Kirino <br>That sequel was so shit. I get Hyocoroad was experimenting but it's obvious it wasn't a good idea past the drawing board.</br></br>  <br> How come her doujins are the best though? <br>Eh. The one where she gets raped is alright I guess.</br></br>  <br>Only be good if we got Kirino torturing Kuroneko.</br>  <br>I dun get it.</br>  <br>I bet you like NTR, too<br> To be honest, one of my first doujins was Manami, before I really got into what this shit was. <br>http://exhentai.org/g/429378/295fc6<wbr>d2aa/<br> Then i got it confused with <br>http://exhentai.org/g/448843/364110<wbr>99e9/</wbr></br> <br>And the distinction forced me to watch/read both, and that began my downward spiral. So, in a sense, I owe Manami for forcing me to get into manga.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Shame fatty's arc was so fucking boring and needed to be resolved in the next season.</br>      I hoped the PSP VN would sorta redeem this series because you were able to choose the girl.<br>Yet it was still disappointing with no conclusive endings whatsoever. Not even a single kiss in most routes</br>  <br>Are you just randomly shitposting?</br>  <br>PSP VN was just for self inserting, right?  Considering they made Kirino his cousin. </br>  <br>Yes, it butchers characters for the sake of pairing and totally removes Kyousuke's personality to make self inserting easier. Go for it if you only care about seeing your favorite girl winning.</br>  oh hey daily oreimo thread, have your share of happy oreimo doujins :^)<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/698811/f5dd74<wbr>37d4/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/652499/b33440<wbr>1d53/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/387824/5d4c58<wbr>6a31/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I really like Kanako's design, pity she didn't get more development.</br>  Mfw never even watched the show and I knew the sister would win<br><br>Was it really not that obvious to everyone?

I'm still going to watch it regardless. I'm on this thread for the same reason. This is a huge ass fucking spoiler amd reading it made me tear up. That's something thays never happened before. <br> pic related </br></br>  <br>He looks like a kind old man. 10/10, would entrust barely-pubescent daughter to his care.</br>  <br> Sorta kinda NBR </br>  <br>Go back to /mlp/ you faggot.</br>  Kirino is a miracle of the universe.  Greatest love story ever told. I loved Kirino the first time I watched it and opened up to Kuroneko the second time. If you get into it and read the lyrics of the ED songs, which are often inner monologues of the characters, it adds a lot to understanding them and appreciating the story, and at some points it's terribly sad.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-O-<wbr>CXaNgfI8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Shame the anime adaptation was butchered so.</br>  <br> greatest love story ever told <br> not Toradora </br></br>  does anyone else think about assplay and anal sex when thinking about kuroneko?  <br>Of course they do. At least I do.</br>  <br>I think about yeast infection and other girly diseases but then I remember that she is 2D and perfect.</br>  <br>Kuroneko really has the make of a buttslut if you ask me.</br>  Minami is an ugly piece of shit, ugly people don't get love.  We will never get S2's full OST.  <br>She'll probably end up some christmas cake and end up hitting on some younger guy that looks like kyousuke.</br>  <br> That song makes me cry every time. I'm so glad Kirino and Kyousuke got together. </br>  Kirini is shit<br>Manami is shit<br>Kuroneko is shit<br>The anime is shit<br>The LN is shit<br>The author is shit<br>Overall everything about this is shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand but that song is actually Kuroneko lamenting her rejection, sung by her seiyuu. It's the ED of the episode where Kyousuke confesses to Kirino, probably shows how biased the anime staff was towards Kuroneko.</br>  <br>Because it played right after the confession I somehow only associate it with Kirino, even if it's actually about Ruri.</br>        <br>The only anime original part that made any sense.</br>  <br> that gif <br> that doujin <br>Why, anon. Of all the doujin's, you had to pick the one with the  second worst ending. <br>Piece of shit, just love the imouto, don't abandon it</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have trouble reading doujins like that even ones like Manami being raped bug me.</br>  <br> should of <br>Why do Americans always make this mistake?</br></br>  Kuroneko is best girl<br>Manami did nothing wrong<br>Kirino a shit <br> Ayase is nothing more than cumdump garbage </br></br></br>  <br>I can tolerate rape, if it's a yandere reverse raping someone with love.<br>I can't tolerate the darker side of Oreimo doujins, with all the rape, mindbreak and NTR.</br></br>  <br>Oreimo doujins tend to be super sweet loving or super dark shit.</br>  <br>the only good oreimo doujin is a  ruri  doujin</br>  <br>I'm so thankful that i can blacklist NTR. Unfortunately, 200 day war technically doesn't have any bad tags, so it slipped through my radar. Hell of a shock i got, expecting yet another cute doujin where Kirino has loving sex with her brother. Dear god, that ending got dark</br>  Can you faggots stop talking about NTR shit if you hate it that much? It sounds like you're just shilling.  <br>ah sorry</br>  <br>Every day, threads on this show. The story revolves around a guy and his pixie dream girl little sister that is in love with him and likes playing siscon H-games.<br><br>You couldn't make up a more pandering otaku crap show if it was a parody.</br></br></br>  The series would have been infintely better without Manami or Kuroneko. We didnt have to see their suffering.<br><br>Should have only focused on Kirino and Kousuke's development.</br></br>  <br>So what would be a better incest story then?</br>    Manami a shit.  <br>Manami a shit. Forever and always. Fuck dutchguy.</br>  <br>Nigga when you post a song or whatever you gotta at least give us a tune to sing it to, otherwise it's useless.</br>  <br><br><br>These gifs were so cathartic during that time. /a/ was so split and antagonistic  even more than usual  for the duration of the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Manami a shit to you too, anon.</br>    <br>Should have read the LN, friend. Also:<br><br> muh neko </br></br></br>  I want more Kirino.      <br>I'm just waiting for pic related to get an anime to fill the void since we're not going to get more Kirino and Kyousuke.</br>  <br>I'm sure. Just a shame about that whole  NBR  thing.</br>  <br>I think it's ok as long as it's properly revealed at the start and not pulled at the end randomly.</br>  <br>We remember him. I just want to know if he already set himself on fire with the LNs.</br>  I want to fuck Kirino.  <br>how the hell do you make these</br>  <br>Love.</br>  <br>hi man i noticed u didnt spoiler the end of a show! can you please do this next time to avoid people having such a plot rich anime spoiled!!! <br><br>thanks !!</br></br></br>  <br><br>She truly is the best girl of our time.</br></br>  Kirino is love.<br>Kirino is life.</br>  <br>should HAVE won you fucking inbred</br>   should of   <br><br>You need to update.</br></br>    i want to  hug_  kuroneko  <br>She probably needs a hug after getting dumped so hard.</br>  <br>i-it was mutual</br>  <br>She draining Kyousuke of his motivation. She literally limited his future possibilities by brainwashing him. Kirino is a bitch and can go diaf, but Manami ain't no innocent.<br><br>Hell, if it wasn't for her removing his overclock, Kirino never would have become bitchy at him and he probably would have fucked both his sisters friends like a boss.</br></br></br>  <br>Bully the Neko</br>  <br>neko was too dumb, she needed to be more aggressive if she wanted to end up with kyousuke's dick inside her</br>  <br>She was still sad.</br>  <br>Yeah, she totally wanted to break up too, that's why she fainted after asking him if he'd still choose her and continued evading and interrupting him when he tried to tell her the truth.</br>  <br>s-she was only pretending to be sad</br>  <br>Totally. At least she got over it in the end and is still friends with the siblings.</br>      <br> Ball so hard motherfuckas wanna fine me </br>  Kirino is our only queen.  <br>Heh, that makes 4 off by 1 in a row I think.</br>  <br>Come on.</br>  <br>You tried, anon. You tried.</br>    <br>normal sibling behavior</br>  Everyone else&gt;shit&gt;Kirino&gt;Manami.      <br>Except that's not how genetics work, idiot. Two children of the same parents have the exact same set of chromosomes as one another, they're merely expressed in different ways. Additionally, only monozygotic twins are identical, and this is merely because two children were born from the same egg, and hence their genes are expressed identically. Fraternal twins (which is what Sora &amp; Haru are btw, since it's literally impossible to have monozygotic twins of opposite genders) have the same genes but are not identical.<br><br>Twins vs siblings doesn't impact the statistical probability of undesirable genetic traits that results from children born of incest.</br></br></br>  <br>Siblings share 50% genes, the closest you can get without any prior incest in the family.</br>  <br> 50% <br><br>how does that happen? aren't we 100% of what our parents are?</br></br></br>  <br>We get 50% from each parent.</br>  <br>We're 50/50 from each parent but still 100 of each bruh</br>  <br>This is the better thread for you. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127320321 </br>  <br>That thread is a /pol/ thread on /a/, not an incest thread.</br>  <br>let me make this simpler to understand<br>imagine that you have a red and blue marble<br>you combine these marbles (just put them in the same spot) and now you have a 2 marble combination of 2 marbles. you can say that each marble represents half of the combination because that is correct, but it is still the totality of the marble within the two marble combination<br><br>now replace marble with parents and the two marble with the offspring and you should get it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Say what you will about Kirino being a bitch, but Manami crossed the line from bitch the psychopath a LONG time ago.</br>  <br>Exactly, they will listen to your stupid shit.<br><br><br>I truly hope you know how retarded that metapher is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i truly hope you know how retarded you're being</br>    <br>I know I'm talking to a shitposter but just for the sake of completeness, it's 0.5^n with n being the degree of kinship. The closest is 1 for siblings orparent-child, 2 for half-siblings, 3 for niece-nephew, 4 for cousins and so on. I think you get the concept.</br>  <br>can i have source for that?</br>  <br>Every single biology book ever, just wait until you're in the 6th grade of whenever they start teaching it in your shithole.</br>  <br>Thanks, friend.</br>  <br><br><br>I can watch this all day.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm genuinely curious because this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeff<wbr>icient_of_relationship exists but it has nothing to do what we're talking about, or are you simply confused?</wbr></br>  <br>Kirino has higher stats so Manami would eventually lose.</br>  <br>what are these siblings doing?</br>  <br>Advanced Cuddling.</br>  <br>i suppose that is fine so long as it is normal</br>  <br> full siblings <br> 50% (which equals 0.5^1) <br>Thanks for confirming what I said earlier. Your wiki article just proves everything I said, only that I used the simpler formula that doesn't apply to all forms of incest.</br></br></br>  <br>Mamori would have been the best in bed.. I think she would be more giving and willing to please than any of the other gyrls</br>  <br>But I was not discussing that with you, perhaps you want to scroll up a little bit and re-read what I argued from the beginning?</br>  <br>see i am pretty sure normal siblings do not kiss this way</br>  <br>You're a funny guy, considering the first thing I said was that siblings share 50% of their genes.  </br>  <br>Yes, and I said that you are wrong. What we inherit on 50/50 is the alleles but we inherit 100% of genes from our parents.</br>  you watched a show called "I can't believe my little sister is this cute" and expected someone other than the little sister to win? Thats the problem. I dropped this show after episode 1 when I noticed it was going to be an incest shit.  2 0 1 5<br>0<br>1<br>5<br>AND PEOPLE STILL THINK<br>THAT KIRINO WASN'T ALWAYS GOING TO WIN<br> 2015 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course the child gets 100% of its genes from the parents but the statement "aren't we 100% of what our parents are?" doesn't make sense as you only share 50% with each parent, not 100%. It reads like you think the genes/chromosomes/etc. double every generation. No matter how you read my posts it's all correct. I'll stop responding now, I'm not bored enough to continue this.</br>  <br>Minami's mammaries the bestits</br>  <br>Will the butthurt ever end?</br>  <br>I doubt it.</br>  <br>People still cry about True Tears, so It'll probably never end.</br>  <br>I know, it's a crime that such a good show only had 7 episodes.</br>  <br> No but I'm kinda glad because we wouldn't have nearly as many threads if people weren't butthurt about x losing or the ending.

I haven't heard anything regarding the manga either. Worth a try?  It's written by a woman, the drawings are clean like seiman douman's style and It has 2 male main characters. just read it in japanese or english.  <br>IT's pretty cool. The whole deaf swordsman thing is kinda cute.</br>  <br>It certainly is very entertaining and pretty original in my opnion, you should give it a chance.

I'm probably just going to skip and wait for any webms of the brown whore.  <br>i absolutely love how casuals cant fucking stand the possibility of the shit you love having flaws<br> hey dude, I'm holding your daughter and wife hostage, now go and commit a columbine for me <br> good job! Oh and your wife and daughter got cut up into pieces for shits and giggles!  <br> just wanted to let you know! <br><br> hey there pal, I kiddnapped your twin sister as a child, and proceeded to rape her every day <br> just wanted to let you know! <br><br> hi there! im some shitty spoiled little brat, Ive been thrown about everywhere to the point where I should have been utterly crushed, but one little cut on my tendon and I cant fucking move anymore, also my entire team betrays me <br><br> hi We're the antagonists and we all love killing and murder for the shits and giggles, but its ok because we're totally doing it for a greater cause, right? <br><br>  hey there lets kidnap this girl, and then cut her up a bit and send her to the protagonists! I mean there's pretty much no reason to do it because we're sure we're going to win, but hey why not? <br><br> Hi I dress like a slut, have an eyepatch and wield a giant axe. And my teammates backstab me for no reason other than being edgy. Original character do not steal. <br><br> its 20 fucking chapters since this so called arc, and not a single antagonist is dead. Every time they beat one of the edgeshits the edgeshits run away and they don't finish them. Every time an edgeshit wins they run away. <br><br> here are the three laws of robo-- I mean three laws of twilights. Before these three laws, the rest of humanity proceeded to utterly discriminate, torture and murder twilights. These three fucking laws simply place forth more fucking restrictions on twilights. A good deal of twilights dont give a shit about these laws. But somehow these fucking jim crow laws end up making the rest of humanity reduce the violence on twilights in some fucking manner. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh and just a fucking reminder, that little nurse who works for the doctor is going to probably be murdered for shits and giggles as well, and when it happens edgeshits like you will go full on white knight mode and hail it as great writing</br>  <br><br>Literally nothing you said in this retarded manner was in the actual manga edgy, you pretty much made a fool out of yourself right here and right now, because you literally did not understand the motivation each of the characters has. If everyone would think like you then every character killing another character or practically using violence would be edgy. gg autist, keep it up.</br></br>  <br> It's not edgy guys I swear! I'm sure that these characters have legit reasons to be that much of a fucking dick! I mean being racist sure is reason enough for child rape! I swear guys! It's going to come up in the next 40 chapters! </br>  <br> I mean being racist sure is reason enough for child rape! <br>Who are you quoting and why are you making shit up? It seems to be the first manga you read. Not every villian gets a backstory that get foreshadowed 600 chapters long. The villians in Gangsta are human, who act like human: unpredictable. We had enough villian who's reasoning we know and some who are still mysterious just like in any other manga. Your new is truly overflowing. Yes, truly the weakest bait.</br></br>  <br>look at all that damage control. why are ganstafags so fucking retarded? Oh wait it's because you enjoy reading shit<br><br> kiddnapped as child <br> raped to the point where she stops moaning <br> not child rape <br><br> The villians in Gangsta are human, who act like human: unpredictable <br> How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't <br>real?<br>I mean seriously do you even read the crap you write? &gt;&gt;&gt;/gaia/<br><br> they're mysterious <br> there sure is mysterious enough shit out there to justify puppy kicking!  <br> I'm sure every one of these assholes experienced it! <br><br> It's bait! I'm going to reply to it! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;kiddnapped as child <br> &gt;raped to the point where she stops moaning <br> &gt;not child rape <br>where does it prove that he is a racist-rape-machime?<br><br> real? <br> I mean seriously do you even read the crap you write? &gt;&gt;&gt;/gaia/ <br>Kill yourself strawman<br><br> justify puppy kicking!  <br>You sound like a faggot, you shy homosexual<br><br> It's bait! I'm going to reply to it! <br>You really don't know how to use greentext newfag. That's why 80% of your text is green, kid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone sure sound frustrated!<br> gangstafag has worse reading comprehension than troll <br> not even trying to refute points anymore <br> resorting to name calling and degrading in order to save face <br>  vol 6 pg 130 <br><br>sure is summer. Maybe your mysterious past is why you're so retarded today!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm actually looking forward to watching it. Started reading when there was only three chapters out. <br> Alex best girl. </br>   gangstafags already a shit tier fanbase <br> anime has not aired yet <br><br>Welp, the kekkaifag replacement has arrived</br></br></br>  <br>So the manga is bad because you're an over-sensitive pussy? Did I get that right?</br>  <br> greentexting everything <br>literally first day on /a/ and you were proven wrong already. You can't even post a page and you literally write it instead, summerfag. <br><br><br> pretending to be someone else <br>0/10</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>fucking summer.</br></br>  <br> like douman's style <br>literally nothing alike, you could've just said it was clean and didn't clutter the skin or single colored areas with line and definition</br></br>  <br>Anime is being done by Manglobe, aka 10 sales and 1 thread a week. This must be your first week if you've never seen shitposting before, lurk before posting kid</br>  <br>look at all this pointless rape and gore, its a mature manga for mature readers. It certainly isn't sloppily written shit made just to rile up the readers so that they can get angry at my antagonists.<br><br><br> The villians in Gangsta are human, who act like human: unpredictable. <br>What the fuck is this even supposed to mean? One moment you're saying they're they're human which implies that their mannerisms follow a set sort of rules and are based off of other experiences. In fact, you even say that their mysteriousness is an unknown and thus will act as a justification for their actions. Next thing you say is that they're unpredictable, which means that their actions are completely unjustified and random. So which one is it going to be?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yep akame ga kill wasnt also edgy amrite</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Did you ever interact with humans? Every Human in this world acts from to time unpredictable. Just because you are a nice guy, it does not mean that you will never kill a man. And the "mysterious" guys don't justify there means by being mysterious retard. It only means that their reasoning will be revealed afterwards and not yet. Are you a legit autist or something?<br><br> pointless rape and gore <br>yeah their shouldn't be any violence at all, becaus eit's matur stuff for mature reader, amirite?<br><br><br>kill yourself, those two series are nowhere near each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bating this hard </br>  <br>Wow I just wanted some clarification, but it sure seems like you gangsta fans sure are overprotective. Also your explanation didn't explain anything. The antagonists are performing some very violent actions from time to time for no legit reason. You say that's justifiable because it's unpredictable. You also say it's justifiable because they have a reasoning that is not yet to be revealed. So which reason is it?<br><br>Also when did I ever push for the removal of all violence? In gangsta, is there any need to kill someone in a gruesome manner when you can simply shoot them in the head or slit their throat? Is there any need to go about giggling and laughing when informing others of the misdeeds your have done to their loved ones who were out of the conflict? <br><br>Man I kinda regret reading this manga now</br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SDZ<wbr>iio6lom0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Are you hyped yet?</br></br>    <br> Ahego <br>Dostedt?</br></br>  <br> remind me about lol Rin Hijack <br><br>allow me to quote https://archive.moe/a/thread/122156<wbr>592/#q122158857<br><br> In the Third Anniversary nostalgia produce event, you could chat it up with a handful of idols.
