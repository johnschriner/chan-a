[ In this thread we wish Sasha a happy birthday. Once again she's lived to see another one. Good job and keep up the good work. <br><br>As far as discussion goes what do you think Annie was planning to do after she failed to capture Eren? He was clearly going to the capital to be executed. Was she going to try her luck again and escape with him? In that case Erwin probably avoided a lot of unnecessary deaths of civilians. <br><br>Another thing, when BRY left they were saying that really soon it's going to be hell inside of the walls. What does that mean? All I can think of is that the wall titans are going to wake up and let all of the outside titans in, killing everyone. The reason they wanted Historia was because she (has the potential to) knows the secret of the walls. Is there a way to stop them from waking up? Keeping them in the dark seems to be working.</br></br></br></br>  Sasha is best girl. If Sasha dies its just grimdark at that point.  <br>Friendly reminder that Sasha being a food addict is not accurate, and the potato meme overshadows other traits, like the fact she is a small village girl with a peculiar accent with a bad behavior towards authority.</br>  Who LH here?    <br>THE RESULTS ARE TRANSMISOGYNISTIC YOU PIG <br><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEE</wbr></br></br></br>  Posting some favorites:<br>http://exhentai.org/g/760365/3ef483<wbr>b5b2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/642014/859084<wbr>1e16/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/702520/48a12b<wbr>5a31/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/743968/e30bf1<wbr>df2d/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/475615/df38a9<wbr>4e0a/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>Not seeing any bad updates on that gallery.</br>  <br>To be fair, King App is fucking great.<br>I can't believe how many times I fapped to it.<br><br>Even the loli parts were great.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Chen posting <br><br>First you post on /v/.<br>Now this?<br>Stop being such a shitposter, Joe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Joe posts in filename threads <br>I'm actually disgusted.<br>https://archive.moe/v/search/tripco<wbr>de/%21JrVCpvv176/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ok, done. I tried to do that before but didn't post anything in empty space and it was canceled.<br><br>Is there some reason why you can't delete your own galleries?</br></br></br></br>  Why does she wear the shorts?  <br> &gt;sisters' <br>I' Have better legs.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>It's cute.<br><br><br><br> Worst <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128618459#p128643409">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anyone who wants Worst to get with Touma is an NTRfag.</br>  <br><br>Well that's really how it would end. Accelerator cannot become erect. No boner = no Worst boning.</br></br>  <br> being a shit-person with a shit-life and shit-taste </br>  What's the first anime you downloaded on high speed internet?

I wonder if I would've been called out for saying best girl is pic.</br>    <br>Hey fuck you man, it's magic. There probably nothing to understand other than "here, it's my memories, keep them for me until I need them." Besides, the plan was simple as fuck "Try to reason Homura and break her free from the incubator. Give Madoka her memories back once it's done." A 10 year old magical girl can do this.</br>  Over the past couple of days I watched the Monogatari series and really enjoyed it. Am I a pleb with shit taste?<br><br>And why is Hachikuji best girl?<br><br> Also, I now have a toothbrushing fetish </br></br></br></br>  <br>Her personality is the best when she has stripes. It's one of her worse hair styles though. She looks best with long, unbraided hair.</br>  <br><br>Kaiki isn't a psychopath.<br><br>Shinobu actually would be a psychopath in Kiss-shot form.<br><br><br><br><br>She isn't even letting Koyomi write 4 pages about her upskirts. How is she good now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Evidence he isn't one based on his earlier behavior?</br>   &gt;Watch only for the plot   <br><br>Psychopaths are unstable, violent, and aggressive.<br><br>Please tell me about the point where Kaiki broke down, hit someone, or attacked people actively for no justifiable reason.</br></br></br></br>  ITT: anime/manga characters that would be great mothers &amp; wives      <br>Probably to beta to handle a woman</br>    an obvious one tbh  I have notice some lack of this threads in /a/  <br>Most overrated thing in OPTs.<br><br><br>MC was awful, but Karin was pure happiness, and that was enough to carry the manga until the rejection, when it went to shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's talking about it hypothetically, you dunce.</br>  <br>Maybe not god-tier, but definately worth a read. Cheating aside, of course, if that's not your schtick</br>  <br><br>Think about it. I'd equate it with letting your kids drink at home because it's a safe place.</br></br>  <br>Except if the reason you're doing it is that she's dependent on sex for affection, that's like letting your alcoholic kids drink at home.</br>  Read the guide before asking questions<br>buyfag.moe</br>  <br>That doesn't look bad at all.</br>  <br> Giving a shit </br>  <br>I didn't really expect much more. Thanks.</br>  <br> Responding to a post hours later. </br>  <br>I'm a big Miyazaki fan. That's my main reason for wanting it. Same goes for Conan. They're both great series.</br>  Well who would win?  Silver age Supes is almost a gag character in itself.  <br>Saitama</br>  <br>No.</br>  Superman.    Is there anymore news on the new chapter?  I FUCKING KNEW IT<br>She's all talk and no substance.<br>All bark and no bite.<br>Anyone with half a brain would know Anna was the real pervert.</br></br></br>  <br>From opening i think he learns to be more open about his love for dirty stuff, like going around in a extreme outfit along with Ayame, so he probably accepts that side of him later on.</br>  <br>P U R E<br><br>U<br><br>R<br><br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boku no Pico.</br>  <br>O-parts: Oman</br>  <br><br><br>Why the ED is so good?</br></br></br>  New chapter is out. It's shit  <br>How many of these kind of letters do you think Miura received?</br>  <br>There is not much info, flora said that beyond the abyss, hell and heaven might exist so the abyss might not be just hell but a sink pilling souls to go whenever they have to go. She also mentioned karma, meaning your actions have some consequence at least. Maybe Casca would have been spared but Guts pretty much enjoyed murdering people.</br>  <br>Like a tornado!</br>  <br>The first one is from band of the hawks wich is said to be bad because they overuse fbombs<br> faggot ass monster <br><br>I don't know wich scans are the later but some of the pages are in the wrong order and are also in the wrong oder on mangatraders<br><br><br>there are no seeders</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These chapters, especially after Rickert's exchange with Griffith, are fundamentally more entertaining and actually important to the plot than any single chapter of the Sea God arc, which was boring and derivative as fuck.<br><br>Fucking Rickert is actually getting some development after all these years, he's about to meet Silat and planting the seeds of the group of people in Falconia that aren't Griffith supporters and you just want more boat shit?<br><br>Fuck the boat and everything in between.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT, try to pitch your idea for an anime through a collage of pictures rather than through text.<br><br>rate each other's ideas obv</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate this meme.</br>  Grigori is the Protagonist.  <br> Not wanting Arisen w/ pawns SOL anime </br>    <br>Twin Peaks + traditional japanese monsters?</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>A lot of people rate part 5 as being really high because of the fights and 6 as being really low, I wonder why that is. <br><br>So lets get a consensus on part 5 vs. part 6 only. No 1-4 or SBR universe. Just Golden Wind Vs.
