[ Is this a boy or a girl? I can't tell.  Go fuck yourself, OP  ITT: ideal housewives  It's funny because I just fapped to the 4th VQ OVA a few hours ago.<br><br> too busy to make a webm of ass punishment <br><br>I really wish that Queen's Blade weren't past its prime...</br></br></br></br>  <br>That girl from the show with a loli dancing in front of tv</br>  What happened to the BD subs for Symphogear G? I'm trying to finish the series but there are no subs to be found.  <br>Ask commie.</br>  <br>It's not like Commie has to be the only group that does it. I mean the raws are up on Nyaa so anyone can have access to them.</br>  <br>There is a bluray rip that slapped commies old subs onto it.</br>  <br>This, but you need to install all of the fonts.</br>  <br>Just get what Commie has out and then download the rest of the eps from the JustCuz torrent (fonts aren't in the files so you'll have to mux them in yourself or install the fonts. they're in the torrent comments.)<br><br> Fuckin captcha kept giving hard pictures </br></br></br>  <br>It was garbage, so no one bothered.</br>  <br><br>Not a fan? Sorry to hear that!<br><br>Go watch a show you like better Anon!</br></br></br></br>  I was annoyed by my inability to find a good batch of season 2 as well.  <br><br>Mine randomly hangs up during attack cards.<br><br>Not fun when you're  sharing geah with friends </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>This is such bullshit. I don't want ot figure out some font nonsense. I just want to watch Symphogear G.<br><br>Thus, this:<br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=5<wbr>38814 or<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=5<wbr>42999<br><br>For either make sure you download the fonts linked in the first's comments. I can't speak to the quality of JustCuz's but the chi+eng one is fine.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  Just download the TV releases you lazy cunts.<br>There are still seeders.</br>  <br>I grabbed Vol. 1 &amp; 2 from Commie and got the rest from JustCuz. They were fine.<br><br><br>Doesn't the BD fix a lot of shit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But BD with subs have been done. Like, look at the post just above yours.</br>  <br> tfw blu-ray batch with karaoke in my native language </br>  <br>What about ReinForce? I know it's bloated but it's still BD.</br>  <br>see <br>The first link is the one I used and it's fine (RF + commie subs).</br></br>  <br> Doesn't the BD fix a lot of shit? <br>I want you to suffer as we did.</br></br>  <br> 1080p <br>Are there any 720p releases of these batches? I can't find them and don't want to download 2GB per episode for a resolution higher than my computer's</br></br>  <br>You mean suffer as we will over the course of the next few months?</br>  <br>Nope.<br><br><br>There are more seeds on AB's by the way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You'd be better off with the TV releases then.<br>The QUALITY only affects two or three episodes.</br></br>  Is OP gone?<br>Can we hype about GX now without spoilering him?<br><br>Okay?<br><br><br> PRESCREEN TODAY, FAGGOTS, EXPECT A FLOOD OF EXCITED JAPANESE TWITTERS ABOUT SYMPHOGRAR TODAY <br> tfw you aren't one of the chosen 500 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   yfw LOVE IS NOT OVER   <br> without spoilering him? <br> Shirabe is Fine </br></br>  Help me Symphobros<br>I can't stop listening to Exterminate<br>And the more I listen to it the more I like it<br>What do?</br></br></br>  <br>EXTERMINAAAAATE<br><br>Nana is too hotblooded, I swear. One of these days she's gonna fall from the ceiling of a concert hall and she won't have Ame no Habakiri to save her ass.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still here. I watched up to the point where  Chris shoots Tsubasa in the back  with /a/ and stopped watching it afterwards for some reason. I just want some closure before S3.</br>  Read the guide before asking any questions. <br><br>www.buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>Her face looks like shit.</br>  <br>I like it, and dat everything</br>  <br>Lala truly is best girl</br>  Mahobutt just came in the mail.<br>The mouth could be better, but she looks great overall.<br><br>I won't insult you with my shitty photography, so have this instead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I find torabaru to be the most boring inane shit, but those tits are calling out to something deep inside me. <br><br>I'll just watch the Darkness OVAs or something as an excuse to get her.</br></br></br></br>  Pleasantly surprised at how good this looks.  <br>I must truly be a gay if tits like those aren't doing anything for me. I like cowtits, but those aren't really cow.</br>  <br>Momo and Yui are my favorites but holy fuck is Lala hot</br>  <br>This<br><br>I'm familiar with Yami and Nemesis through doujs but those tits make me ponder life</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think she features much in the OVAs, or Darkness in general.</br>  Who approved these proportions? He looks disgusting.  <br>The term is gravitits</br>  <br>Oh. I'd better do my research then.</br>  <br>Wrong link in OP. <br>Right link: http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>She's perfect anon, go for it</br>  <br>Just saying if you want an actual excuse for Lala you're better off watching TLR/Motto, or reading the manga.</br>  Dat mons pubis<br><br>Out of this world</br></br>  <br><br>Those jean shorts are kind of a turn-off though.<br>All I can think of is how uncomfortable she is.</br></br></br>  <br>Kind of agree, I wish there were a little longer. Not figure-breaking for me though.</br>  <br>Why would anyone support that shitshow, or want figures of its completely unlikeable cast?</br>  <br>I think their silliness is what makes them so hot for me, they are barely wider than the belt loops, and damn too tight. Cameltoe splitting levels of tight</br>  <br><br>Damn. Lala is hot. Sexy hot. Actually, aren't her tits bigger than that?</br></br>  Figure when?  <br>Even if they're not 100% accurate, I think they look perfect.<br><br>You could say they're being squished by her top though.</br></br></br>  <br>figure when?</br>  <br>I want to see a Pochaco that has an appropriately fat and disgusting face.</br>  <br><br>Damn Lala has the body of a top model</br></br>  <br>I expect to see lots of hotglued Lalas in the future.</br>  <br>There's still a surprising amount of Slainefags and people who support the show even though it was awful. I could maybe understand buying it if it looked half decent but damn, it's a monstrosity.</br>  SOON<br><br>Hopefully in time for episode one.</br></br>  <br>Models don't have bodies like that, that's the physique of a prime porn star. With that breast size, height, and her curves she would never be a model.</br>  <br>What's wrong with her breast size, height or curves?</br>  WHEN  <br>Have you seen top models? They are tall skeletons with almost no tits. <br><br><br>Lala is short and too voluptuous</br></br></br></br>  <br>would go great together with pic related</br>  What figures are you guys waiting for? I lost my list.    <br>Is she from that wrestling shit?</br>  <br>This I can understand, the other one not so much.</br>  <br>Chun-li</br>  <br>we can't tell from your image</br>  <br>Phoenix down only works on beings that weighs less than a hundred tons</br>  <br>God damn, Lala's body is pure sex</br>  <br>That's not the appeal of the character, even fat fetishist don't like women with fat faces</br>  <br>someone has to cosplay the other character</br>  <br>Breast too big<br>She's too short<br>Body too curvy<br><br>The bare minimum is a certain height and even plus size models are held to that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw tsuji santa succumbs to the sjw of /a/ and makes pochaco a skinny anorexic dfc </br>  <br> spamming multiple threads with your shit <br>fuck off</br></br>  <br>SWEATY UNWASHED TITS</br>  <br> She's too short <br>How tall is she?</br></br>  <br>Why is that creation so boner inducing</br>  <br>COLOURED SWEATY UNWASHED TITS</br>  <br>5'6"</br>  So, is there anything y'all are hoping to see at the next WonFest?<br><br> Don't let me down Ques Q  </br></br>  <br> Pochaco dies. </br>  <br>Some jap fucker will hotglue that Uogokoru until it's overflowing.</br>  <br>165cm</br>  <br>Actually make that 5'5" or 165cm</br>  <br>needs bigger drills</br>  <br>*Uogokoro<br><br><br>Tama.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. She's from that Starless SHIT. Quite literally.</br>  <br>I want this because I need more casual clothes for my nendos.</br>  <br><br><br> Just slightly below my height <br>Excellent</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yo shouldn't mix your nendos.<br>It's impure.</br></br>  <br>Yes you should I'd mix mine but I'm not very creative</br>  <br>I'd like to see the FREEing bunny yoko, might be my first 1/4 ever<br><br>That Rui GK anounced as PVC<br><br>More abyssal girls from kancolle</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is tell your world miku binning?  <br>I won't let you stop my fun.</br>  <br>Manlet</br>  <br>I'm hoping to see this colored. Update has been too slow to arrive but I suppose they have been dealing with many other figures.</br>  <br>Great ass, and pantsu. Otherwise forgettable. Not particularly bad either just boring.</br>   payment request <br>SOON</br>  <br>Where is she on order from?</br>  tfw Telegenic got delayed  <br> manlet trying to lord over beautiful women because he's two inches taller <br>Leave Lala alone</br></br>  <br>By French Doll and Flare. I'm confident it'll be great.</br>  <br>Nowhere yet. She's an amiami exclusive though</br>  What are some good Lumchan figures? Watching Urusei Yatsura and she is best girl.   still no payment request <br>JUST</br>    <br>Now I have to sweet talk one of you bastards into being my proxy for amiami.</br>  <br> More abyssal girls <br>I second this.</br></br>  Absolutely disgusting  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127366566   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127366566 <br> That one blue haired chick <br>Holy fuck, someone's packing heat</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Those poor clothes, they are trying so hard to contain Lala's deliciousness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you need a proxy for? AmiAmi ships almost everywhere.<br><br>Heres the mfc link http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>286484</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>They banned me after I gave thousands to you fuckers.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Fucking preorders when?</br></br></br></br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127366566 <br> all those dicks <br>FutaxFemale is great but not sure I wanna see two dickgirls at one time</br></br>  <br> oppai loli <br> disgusting <br><br>you are a disgrace</br></br></br></br>  <br>I literally ask this when it comes to Madoka every hour.</br>  <br> every hour <br>If you're that obsessed, I'd say that you're in denial.</br></br>  <br><br>Feels weird to know that this is actually Sonico.</br></br>  <br>Ouch. Cancelled too many orders? Some dude on the other thread managed more than 8 cancellations and is still alive on ami.</br>  <br>Damn it, wrong pic.</br>  <br>Nah they had an alternate email and I never checked it since it wasn't my main. Lost out on about 40 preorders. What I don't get is I spent 30k usd with them and they still cancelled my account. Fuckers be ruthless.</br>  <br>I have like 10+ cancellations and 3 of those were were 3 months in a row of canceling entire orders. <br><br>Still able to order from them,</br></br></br>  <br>we rule the world man, get over it normie</br>   Trying to collect all the BRS figmas <br> Impossible to find anything but Str and Char, which I already own, anywhere but Amazon of all places <br><br>Kill me it hurts to live</br></br></br>  <br>Except it isn't.</br>  <br>The Sonico GK is a little different. But it is the same artist.</br>  <br>Except it is.</br>  <br>They are both hot and I would fuck them with the force of a 1000 dying stars.</br>  <br>I would want this but it's so plain, also GK</br>  <br>Not really, unless you are blind or retarded</br>  <br>I just want to point out that the guide url doesn't work with "www" in front of it. In the future, just use http://buyfag.moe</br>  <br>Yes really, unless YOU are blind or retarded. The sculptor and sculpt fundamentals are literally , which reinforces my original post.</br>  <br>Already been pointed out in the thread and in the duplicate thread that was just deleted.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>And? It's still not Sonico, as similar as it may be.</br>  <br>I can't wait to smell her PVC.</br>  <br>OK buddy. Let's just pretend that you're right and I'm wrong.</br>  We more healthy grill figures.  <br> healthy <br>Diabetes isn't healthy, anon.</br></br>  <br>Yes the pose is the same so? Proportions are different, the details are completely different as well, so is the expression, face and accesorios. Oh and most of all, it's not Sonico at all. <br><br>So yes, you are damn retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Her face is already an appropriate level of fatness for the rest of her body. She's fat but not that fat. People in these threads act like she's morbidly obese or something.</br>    <br>How are those panties even comfortable, look how far they dig into her fat hips.</br>  <br>The sculpt is literally designed for Sonico, by the same sculptor, and uses literally the same sculpt with slight alterations. Now it has a different head. Sorry buddy, looks like you're the only retarded one here.</br>  <br>her tits are too hight</br>  <br>Different head, navel, thighs, arms and even the feet, tits as well and oh the head is different. <br><br>Again how is she Sonico? <br><br>Yes you are blind and retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  She came 4 days early, thank you mr. postman<br>Anybody else get her?</br>  <br>Why is /rk9/ infecting /a/? Good god the cancer is strong.</br>  <br>Not the same sculpt at all, they just share the pose. The proportions are different. From head to toes.</br>  <br>It is definitely the same sculpt or at least uses the original sculpt as a basis for this one.</br>  There's a figure on amiami I want to get but the description is so weird for google translate. Any help?<br><br>開封使用　背中色移り小/箱破れ・イタミ大<br><br>Box is damaged like usual but what the heck is the rest?</br></br></br></br>   alternate panties <br><br>why isnt this a thing yet? who cares about extra faces, give me panties</br></br>  I'm thinking of buying this http://www.crunchyroll.com/store/p/<wbr>166385/Knights-of-Sidonia-Series-18<wbr>-Garde-Figma <br><br><br>or this http://www.crunchyroll.com/store/p/<wbr>165199/Knights-of-Sidonia-Tsugumori<wbr>-Figma<br><br>but i heard it comes disassembled and you have to build it piece by piece and that it isn't painted and you have to do it yourself<br><br>Can anyone confirm this? how the fuck are we supposed to paint this...</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>Getting this and removing the head and tail, so I can put a Sonico head on it because this is never coming out</br>  <br> The sculpt is literally designed for Sonico, by the same sculptor, and uses literally the same sculpt with slight alterations <br>Not much more needs to be said. You can pretend like the figure isn't originally Sonico, if you like. Whatever consoles you.</br></br>  <br>See the gif above, is not the same sculpt, and even if the sculptor based lala on that Sonico that certainly doesn't make her Sonico. <br><br>Your argument is plain silly.</br></br></br>  <br>Your gif does a good job of proving his point.</br>  <br>If you are blind and don't see the actual proportions</br>  <br>If you mean the word 'normie' specifically then yes, but calling out normalfags for their shit isn't anything new here.</br>  <br> Crunchyroll <br><br>Anon please just kill your self or stop buyfagging.</br></br></br>  <br>The two figures are obviously different but you have to admit that the Sonico figure is clearly the inspiration for the Lala figure, just with slight alterations.<br><br>Get over it.</br></br></br>  <br> figma are model kits <br> CR <br>Is this bait?</br></br></br>    <br>I've been following the sculptor's twitter for ages and there's nothing to suggest it's ever happening though.</br>  <br><br>I never said I'd buy it from CR, if it makes you feel better here http://www.amazon.ca/Knights-Ichina<wbr>nashiki-Shiratsuki-Tsugumori-Animat<wbr>ion/dp/B00L4R2EES/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UT<wbr>F8&amp;qid=1435630131&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=<wbr>knights+of+sidonia</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Not the first time I've seen that<br><br>Kotobukiya did that with their Shining series figures.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And I never said it wasn't inspired nor based on Sonico, I said that lala is not Sonico, which was the/your original point.</br>  <br>Okay, it's definitely bait.</br>  <br>Not sealed, some discoloring on the back/box damaged - lots of damage.<br><br>I think. Looks like it's just the box.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay I haven't checked amiami for this but holy shit they have it for cheaper <br><br>http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=TOY-RBT-3918&amp;page=top%2F<wbr>search%2Flist%3Fs_keywords%3Dknight<wbr>s+of+sidonia%24pagemax%3D40%24getcn<wbr>t%3D0%24pagecnt%3D1<br><br>has anyone ordered from this place? how is it?</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the guy you were arguing with. Just curious about the whole thing. It's awfully close.<br><br><br>Thank you so much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one uses amiami. It isn't reputable.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks for the laugh, bait-kun.</br></br></br>  <br>okay everyone move along, nothing to see here</br>  <br>Are you seriously asking if anyone has bought from AmiAmi? How fucking new are you?</br>  <br>Literally nobody has ordered from there.<br>It's listed in the guide as an unreliable chinese con. You of course know that already, since you read the guide.</br></br>  <br><br>My only concern with this is if it's going to be available in the international site. The Bikini Warriors Sorceres is also exclusive of a bunch of stores including Amico but only in the JP site.</br></br>  Sakura is fucking cute and Snake is fun, but god damn GSC's quality control is getting worse and worse. I had to take a knife to Sakura's wings to get the pegs to fit inside, the square holes were almost circular. Mario's pile of accessories is pretty neat though.  <br>Lala? For one it's definitely an AmiAmi exclusve so most likely won't see it elsewhere.</br>  <br>I can't wait to get Sakura, but <br> waiting on SAL. </br></br>  <br><br>I just got here. link in the op doesn't work</br></br>  <br>you got a link for that lala fig I can't seem to find it?</br>  <br> GSC's quality control <br>Max factory makes most of the figma series. GSC has done some of them but Sakura for sure is max factory.<br><br>http://www.goodsmile.info/ja/produc<wbr>t/4716/figma+%E6%9C%A8%E4%B9%8B%E6%<wbr>9C%AC%E6%A1%9C.html<br><br> メーカー <br> マックスファクトリー </br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, Lala. I know she's Amico exclusive, that's why I say I just hope it's not Amico JP only too.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't worry though, the issue with the bikini warriors line is with hobby Japan, see the 7 sins line as well which was removed from Amiami's international site. <br><br>And obviously bikini warriors is also owned by hobby japan</br></br></br>  <br>It's not up on AmiAmi yet. Here's an mfc link if it helps any later.<br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>286484<br><br><br>Ooh. Gotcha. My bad.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>How much does she go for?<br>I really, really want that.</br></br>  <br>The guide.</br>  <br>About tree fiddy</br>  <br>The problem extends beyond figma. Sure, my AhuHomu's wings were unreasonably bent at the peg and Mako's chair doesn't fit in her base, but nendo Yukari's gap being made of cheap rubbery material so it can't be sustained with the base and nendo Kyouko's back hole being too large for her stand entirely fit the bill as well.<br><br>They've been giving me a lot of problems with their goods' accessories lately, which is doubly frustrating with the price hike.</br></br></br>   In stock <br><br>Finally, now, amicoplz invoice me</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it can be frustrating. I had to file down Phat's Iori in order to get her to go on her stand.</br>  <br>Is she sad because she was raped?</br>  <br>No, rape is nothing to be sad about.</br>  <br>Other NGNL figures never.</br>  <br/>  <br>Holy fuck she's cast off?</br>  <br>Yeah, shiro is fine and all, but there's a lot of really good characters in that show if you like moe crap. Which I do.</br>  <br>No she isn't. Pretty sure someone did this themselves.</br>  <br>I am glad I was born with the raging, volatile hormones to appreciate the body on this figure.<br><br>Truly, it is the entirety of my existence.<br><br> Until it is scaled up to 1/1 like Momo. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING HELL<br><br>HOW CAN SOMEONE FIND THIS SHIT ATTRACTIVE? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?! I MEAN LIKE SERIOUSLY, SURE HER BODY IS NICE AND PLUMP BUT HER BABYFACE RUINS IT!<br><br>WHAT A FUCKING WASTE<br>THAT ISN'T CUTE, IT ONLY MAKES ME CRINGE AND THE ONLY WORD TO DESCRIBE IT IS THE WORD "CREEPY".

It's never happened to any of my Nendos before, but for some reason this Popura is a very low quality build. None of the pieces want to stay in their pegs besides the head joint which wasn't even attached to the headplate when I opened it. Maybe I'm being retarded, but I don't want to break this trying to get it out.  <br>How much does something like that cost? What do you do with it, frame it?</br>  <br>Depends entirely on the artist<br><br>I've seen pictures go for as low as 900 yen all the way to 30k or more. You could frame a particularly excellent piece or stash them like doujinshi on a bookshelf or in a drawer. <br><br>Sainasu eibe</br></br></br></br></br>  Well, shit.

I want one.</br></br></br>  How is Vertex?  <br> Marvel <br> Tales of Vesperia <br>fail to see how either of these are /a/ related but hope you enjoy them none the less<br><br><br> those yryrs <br>They look good. Manda is great from my few limited experiences. Japs are really anal about box condition so "TOTALLY FUCKING DESTROYED" could mean a corner is bashed in and the outer display plastic has a tear. I've bought "damaged box" nendos and the only damage I could see is a crease or normal shelf wear.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Good.<br><br>But I would hold on into getting that, is too expensive and most people don't like how her back is broken. So it will most likely bin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I saw her on manda for 7k and said why not. I've been wanting her and the rest of the Vesperia crew for a long long time so I had to buy her. I'll work my way up to Yuri</br>  <br>Yeah pretty much every purchase from mandarake said they had damaged boxes and I think most of them looked perfect, there was one that literally looked brand new.<br>I feel like for cases like that one, its just them covering their ass if the box gets damaged during shipping.<br>Or maybe they're just really autistic about the small dent you make when you cut the tape and open a box.</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly she doesn't have her black pantyhose. If she did I wouldn't hesitate, but I'll see how she does post-release.</br>  <br>Das it mane.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much the same here. I just can't justify the 20k she is with things like pic and the missing pantyhose.</br></br>  <br>What a slutty console</br>  <br>Great minds think alike</br>  Shiny   Holy shit they released the first Nendo in the new Love Live line really dam fa- <br> Only 2 faces and one crepe  <br><br>Well, no fucking wonder they made her so fast. She doesn't have shit.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127366566 <br>The blonde midget probably sprays like a fire hose with that kind of baggage</br>  <br>I've actually completely stopped caring about these GSC exclusives. They have absolutely no value on the aftermarket, because everyone hates them so much. I have seen GSC exclusives for sale on YJA for 500 yen, no buyer. <br><br>MF is just digging their own grave, with this constant barrage of exclusives. It makes their regular release feel cheaper, incomplete, and not worth the price.<br><br>I have to miss the AX GSC panel. It's on a thursday because some genius thought that would be a good idea. Could someone ask them about how their exclusives are going, and someone should record the whole thing too. <br><br>Last year someone recorded the GSC panel and uploaded it to youtube and it was great because it was a very easy way to end arguments, and pretty much the only internet evidence for a lot of facts we all knew. A repeat would be awesome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2 faces and one accessory <br>Not even a Love Live fan  havent seen it  but that pisses me off too. Are they charging the usual full price?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm glad im not into nendos.</br></br>  <br>3.5k.</br>  <br>Is that a dust bunny in her hair?</br>  <br>She's not supposed to.</br>  I have 13 bucks that I need to spend by the end of next month and have no idea what to buy, thus I'm making a list of anything I could buy for that amount of money for the purpose of drawing a random entry out of a hat. Other than the given single volume of any given anime or manga, what are some items I could buy for $13? Limited to US domestic or places that accept PayPal.  <br>Wow, she looks worse than Yamato. Such a shame that Bandai is doing all my favorites</br>  <br><br><br>How come she's not in the GSC shop? <br>Been waiting for something else to come out that I want to order it together with the Kongo Bust.</br></br></br></br>   go to ikea site to buy detolf <br> $100 dollar shipping <br><br>Thanks you Swede pieces of shit.</br></br></br>  Amazon JP now goes full jew on their DHL shipping costs.  <br>Most of her figures don't have black pantyhose. It's a shame.</br>  <br>Well kudos on the score then. I should probably start camping mandarake as well, I'd like to collect the crew at some point.</br>  <br>Yeah, you have to go in, it's a load of crap. If one's not in your town but your town is of a decent size, there's a good chance some will pop up on craigslist for less. Used furniture isn't so bad as long as they haven't scratched or smashed it.</br>  <br>If I weren't such a lazy piece of shit, I'd run over to the Mall of America after work and pick one up in person instead of paying out the ass for shipping that might come damaged.<br><br>If.</br></br></br>  <br>Where are you from? It actually went from 1200Y to 900Y in the US. <br>Thanks for letting me know.</br></br>  <br><br>What did you fucking expect? <br><br>ordering any kind of furniture cost a shit ton thanks to how big and how much it weights.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Details? I paid $8 earlier today for the bakemonogatari key animation note set, which weighs 4 kg. People were talking about "rape" but no one ever responded if they were talking about financial rape or rape in the sense of box damage (which is apparently an issue?)</br>  <br>Didn't everyone complain about body and head having different shade?<br>Also, her head look like it's about to pop out from the neck.</br></br>  <br>Yeah no shit, I'm gonna have to drive an hour or two to an actual location to snag one.<br><br>'Course now I'm worried that it'll be marked up to the point that shipping would be a viable alternative.</br></br></br>  <br>Weren't people saying this turned out bad? It looks pretty good outside of the hair seam.</br>  <br> marked up <br>Why the fuck would it be?</br></br>  <br>I think it looks bad, the face is all kinds of fuck, and for once I can say her waist is way too narrowness those Sugus.</br>  <br>Yes yes, Mandarake. Thanks for the translation. I'm gonna skip on it. Don't know why I didn't even bother posting the link. It was this:<br>https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order<wbr>/detailPage/item?itemCode=101473369<wbr>3</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Ah right, pic</br>  <br>Do call ahead to make sure they have it. I tagged along with my friend to the Ikea an hour away only to find they were sold out of them and wouldn't be getting any more for "months" (I find that a little hard to believe, but that's what he said). He also immediately asked if I was going to be using it to display figures, which was a little weird.</br>  <br>I'm about 10 minutes away by car to the nearest ikea. I wish their shipping wasn't so retarded, then again a detolf is rather heavy.</br>  <br>That's shitty. Usually they'd at least provide a picture of the back to show the damage, but I guess they got lazy with this one.</br>    <br>Who is that? She is perfect.</br>  <br>I live in Commiefornia. Every single thing here is more expensive than it has any reason to be.<br><br>Aside from burritos, of course. They're giving those little diarrhea machines away.<br><br><br>Yeah, for sure. If I'm gonna be spending $4 a gallon, I'm damn sure gonna call ahead first.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean, she does have giant tits and a tiny frame in the series. And I think her face looks fine. /opinions</br></br>  <br>The glossy finish on the swimsuit looks tacky as fuck and clashes badly with the swimsuit's creases in my opinion.<br>The actual sculpt of the waist also looks a bit off in my opinion.</br></br>  <br>You seem to be missing the assymetric facial features and the different skin tones.</br>  <br>She was well endowed but not that skinny, more like the bq in this pic. Proportions like those would have been fine in my book, of course with better quality on the face.</br>  <br>I live in California too and I got a DETOLF for $65.</br>  <br>So do I. They aren't marked up.<br>Now please stop blogshitting.</br></br>  <br>Her proportions are so disgusting.</br>  <br><br>I want an unpainted prototype</br></br>  Why would you have furniture shipped to you? Of course it's gonna be very expensive. Sometimes I feel like most of don't have any common sense  <br>No that would be anything by Raita.</br>  <br> most <br>It's just one retard.</br></br>  <br>Most of these fags don't even have a drivers license to go out and get it.</br>  <br>Even rata girls have better curves than that Sugu, at least they look stylized.</br>  <br>Looks pretty delicious to me. Actually it's been a while since I got hard just from looking at a figure.<br><br><br>Raita's stuff is pretty weird, but who cares when it's that hot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure what you mean. Are you saying you don't want stuff shipped to your house for some reason? I don't think it's unreasonable to think it would at least be possible, I've bought whole mattresses through amazon and it worked out great. <br><br>With Ikea I think it's mostly a size and fragility issue - detolfs come in a really long package and even with padding you don't want to bang it around panes of glass if you can help it.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop posting.</br>  <br>Furniture weighs a lot and is large so it's ridiculously expensive to ship.</br>  <br>glass detolfs are awful anyway, buy some nice shelves instead</br>  <br> incredibly top heavy <br> delicious </br></br>  <br> stylized  <br>No, they look like shit. There will never be a good Selvaria because of that untalented faggot.</br></br>  <br>That's why you bring the furniture on the bus.</br>  <br>Your loss, Volks, alter and vertex selvarias are wonderful</br>  <br>I'm sure that very successful artist will lose sleep at night knowing some dickweevil on an imageboard thinks he's untalented.</br>  <br>Oh, well that's some good news then. Thanks.</br>  <br>great fetish choice, but not fond of that hairstyle.</br>  <br>She looks like a Hatsuni Meekoo wannabe.</br>  <br> success has anything to do with talent  <br>Rob Liefeld is pretty damn successful too.</br></br>  <br><br>Are you genuinely retarded or just pretending?</br></br>  <br> Last year someone recorded the GSC panel and uploaded it to youtube and it was great because it was a very easy way to end arguments, and pretty much the only internet evidence for a lot of facts we all knew. A repeat would be awesome. <br>I agree, I hope that someone could do this</br></br>  <br>Nothing with those retarded proportions is wonderful. Although at least Alter's is passable.</br>  <br>This is borderline Raita shit.</br>  <br>Utsutsu would look perfect if her spine wasn't so strange.</br>  <br>How?</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with her spine.</br>  Poor anatomy =/= Exaggerated anatomy, people.<br>The latter may not be everyone's cuppa but they're not the same.</br>  How's Pulchra?  <br><br>Awful.</br></br>  <br>ultra shit</br>    <br>Sure.</br>  <br>Don't even consider tier.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hell.</br></br>  <br>As bad as Griffon and Embrace Japan.</br>  Looks good.  <br> mfw Ikea is 5 minutes from my house </br>  <br>Well it's a kit</br>  <br>Fucking faggot</br>  <br>Lucky faggot.</br>  <br>That she does.</br>   38 days later <br>She's cute, though I wish her skirt was a tad longer so her panties aren't pretty much always showing.</br>   bank is freaking out over some bullshit <br> my amiko order is cancelled because of that <br> mfw </br></br>  GSC pls reveal painted at won fes  <br>now it's time to use paypal, no bullshit with it</br>   FREEing   <br>There's one 30-40 minutes away by freeway but I hate Detolfs so I have no reason to go.</br>  <br>No bullshit except for their conversion rates.

Amazon US will take it down too, if you can prove it.<br><br>Reminded me of this ANN column which talked about it recently.<br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ans<wbr>werman/2015-06-26/.89649</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  I bought an Anko on Tippy. I love this CharaRide line.  <br>They haven't even painted the Banpai Akira Remi yet because I guess they're content to sell it as a GK. Maybe it's because a pre-painted one would be upwards of 20K and nobody would buy it.<br><br>Anyway that Patche looks tiny.</br></br></br>  <br><br>remove the www.</br></br>  <br>If you're trying OP's link, it ain't gonna work.

They may as well just do figures from this.</br>  <br> Criticizes people for not using the guide before asking questions. <br> Criticises people for utilizing the guide. <br>Fucking retard.<br>If you must know, I remembered seeing some links about places to buy risers and other 'accessories' and rather than asking, I tried looking at the guide.<br><br><br><br>Duh. It's late and I'm an idiot. Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if you took the instagram filters and bloom off I'd be able to see what the fucking picture is.</br>  <br>I wonder if this would be 10k - 11k</br>  <br>I'll get mine in a week or two, how is she?</br>  <br>Don't call others retarded when your problem would have been solved if you had bothered reading the  thread  before posting, you loser.</br>  <br><br>I'm going to AX this year, and I plan to go to the GSC panel.

I definitely gonna read it soon, though it was quite a pain in the ass to get the music running.</br></br>  <br> still no air intakes <br>The loss of the granny skirt is sad, but the loss of air intakes was the one that killed me.</br></br>  <br>This is a remake, no anime in the works. As for the music all you need to do is rip it or download one of the alternatives.</br>  Nani nani? New characters? That's awesome news. Tsukihime had a serious lack of characters in comparison to FSN.  So how many years will it take to translate this one? Another 10 years?  <br> Noel, a female teacher <br> Noel  <br>Totally normal japanese name, not suspicious at all</br></br></br>  <br>Are there any images of Shiki, or any of the other male characters?</br>  <br>I heard there is Arihiko.</br>  FUCK YOU NASU FINISH MY STORY FIRST  Nothing special about grand order?

Think before you post.</br></br>  I wonder how sexier they will make Shiki.  <br>I don't like how Saber-fied her face is. Yes, the feautures are slightly different, but if you look at the original "ugly" sprites, faces had more identity - Arc had narrow eyes placed above her nose(not right next to it like Takeuchi draws now) so she seemed like an adult woman, Ciel had huge round light-blue eyes, Sacchin's small and dark, Akiha's were less pointy and she also appeared to be older.<br>Everyone has fucking tsurime and same face structure now.<br>Fuck Takeuchi.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This. Both.</br></br>  <br>Nearly everyone since MBAC ( I think?), has had tsurime. And MBAACC designs were the epitome of Takeuchi.</br>   Its not going to have sex scenes <br><br>Sort of disappoint.

Original fans have long since read, theorycrafted, enjoyed, hated, and shitpost about Tsukihime. We know that the remake is to rebuild hype for Tsukihime 2. Also mahoyo aint getting a sequel for 20 years at the least kids.  <br>1 / 7 /2015</br>  <br> Tsukihime 2 <br>Pffft.

Takeuchi just needs to widen the air intakes.</br>  <br>Please don't get my hopes up.</br>  <br><br> Oh god please!!! </br></br>  <br> Rebirth: Tsukihime <br><br>Although it's a remake so the name makes sense, consider that the original themes of the work are life, death, and eternity. There may very well be a reason for why it's called "Rebirth" beyond it being a catchy remake title.<br><br>Who is the character that experiences rebirth most obviously? Roa does.<br><br>Considering how many parallels Roa shares with Shiki and how he (through SHIKI) is the unifying factor for most of the characters, it's an interesting name that could mean a lot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want Sacchin's route, if they don't want to make it... At least show her use Depletion Garden.<br><br>Shit has been bugging me for years.</br></br>  <br>If only the change is good</br>  <br> everyone's collective of 666 reaction faces when Roa gets rewritten as an HF Kotomine-tier villain </br>  <br>Hoping she'll have the miniskirt during the day and her old outfit during night, or the miniskirt is what she wears on the deito</br>  <br>Is this the only noteworthy info in the whole magazine?</br>  <br>I want my Nero Chaos</br>  <br>Could also have references to Under Night In-Birth throwing a bone to French Bread for working on Melty Blood, or maybe including a Sion or Riesbyfe cameo to get the Back Alley Alliance back together for the Satsuki route.</br>  <br>It's not actually the title. It's just that they're calling it rebirth instead of remake now.</br>  <br> Rebirth <br> Obligatory Roa reincarnation <br> Shiki waking up from his coma with the MEoDP and rehabilitation by Aoko <br> Arcueid's reawakening whenever Roa incarnates, as well as Shiki introducing her to a new life <br> Ciel possession by Roa, her regeneration from certain death, her taking on a new purpose within the Church <br> Akiha... i dunno lol. Kurenai Sekishu? <br> Hisui's sealing her emotions for Kohaku's sake, as well as Shiki's reawakening of them <br> Kohaku killing her selfhood and becoming a doll, only to reawaken with the sole drive of enacting vengeance <br> Sacchin's being turned into a vampire and trying to survive her new life <br> Len is the "reborn" psychic remains of a young girl's apparition in the corpse of a cat <br> Nrvnqsr trying to achieve "rebirth" as the Chaos <br><br>This might actually be a really cool idea, Nasu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Roa have his own share of villain-ey on another route. How about SHIKI itself? He conquer and devour Roa then became HF Kotomine-tier villain.</br>  <br>only secondaries hate shirou please</br>  <br>the guy that translated the bullet points on BL already said that he made a mistake, they're just rebranding it as a "rebirth" not a "remake" but the title is still just Tsukihime</br>  <br><br>Roa was always a remarkably well-written villain if you just looked at his backstory and motives. His presence in the visual novel just isn't as menacing as it should be. In the manga it's different and he's really brought to the forefront as a threat.</br></br>  <br>Rebirth isn't the title, it's a mistranslation. It's saying that the remake is a "rebirth" of Tsukihime.<br><br>It really seems like they're taking the framework and completely reinvisioning it from the ground up.</br></br></br>  <br>You keep telling yourself that</br>  <br>That'd be nice if they'd actually finish it</br>  <br>They need to finish it so we can get MB HD the following year.<br>And who knows, maybe it'll take off so hard they'll start milking tsukihime instead of fate.</br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Shirou as a character? Sure he's flawed, sure he's a bit of a cutout character at the start of the story, but he gets his development and becomes a much rounder character by the end of UBW and HF. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that Shirou is a stellar character, but he's far from the worst in F/SN.</br>  <br> they'll start milking tsukihime instead of fate. <br>As much as I want more Tsuki, I don't want them to ruin it by milking</br></br>  <br>Personally he was just annoying and obnoxious.<br>It doesn't matter how much development he gets, he was still annoying and ruined the first two routes for me.<br>In HF he was okay though.</br></br></br>  <br> new artwork with new Ciel and Arc designes <br>Fucking finally.<br> new location for Misaki for some reason <br>Fucking why? How are they gonna explain having a mansion in the middle of the fucking city?<br> new female teacher named Noel <br>Association or Church member, that name is too suspicious.<br> Various changes will be made to characters that don't show up directly <br>DAA designs? Fucking finally, I've been waiting years for this.<br><br>Finally a TM Ace that's worth my time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I-I'd honestly give my firstborn for that.<br> Tsukihime manga gets adapted to ufo animation <br><br>Then I can die happy and return to the root in utter peace.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Prisma Illya spoilers when?</br>  <br>Next month, it's on break.</br>  <br> DAA designs? Fucking finally, I've been waiting years for this. <br><br>Give him the fucking coat, Takeuchi.<br><br>Sasaki knew what she was fucking doing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's hot.</br>  <br>Aww fuck, I was anticipating Miyu's backstory</br>  <br><br> Hating UBW Shirou <br><br>Shit taste confirmed</br></br></br></br>  I don't even care that much about the remake. I just wish they would hurry up so Melty Blood HD can be made.  <br>Anyone planning to get the issue themselves?<br> I want to, but I don't know where to order. </br></br>  <br>Ya UBW Shirou is probably my favorite Shirou, not just cause he gets to bang Rin either.</br>  <br>Shouldn't you be able to get it off JP Amazon?</br>  Reminder  <br><br>Roa throwing away his swag coat in the manga tripped a loser flag.</br></br>  <br> I'm retarded and can't use amazon jp <br>http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%B3%E<wbr>3%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%<wbr>E3%83%BC%E3%82%AF-2015%E5%B9%B48%E6<wbr>%9C%88%E5%8F%B7-%E5%A2%97%E5%88%8A-<wbr>TYPE%E2%80%90MOON%E3%82%A8%E3%83%BC<wbr>%E3%82%B9VOL-10/dp/B00YWYL8F6/</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>he tries</br></br>  <br>It's depressing.</br>  <br>Last time I checked for JP Amazon you needed a JP address for your orders, and finding a proxy delivery service is too much. Unless that's not how it works, then I freely lower myself to Shirou/Shiki level retardation, whichever one you consider dumbest.</br>   Noel-sensei <br>Why does this seem like it's b8?</br>  <br> Dead Saber </br>  <br> he doesn't know how to buy stuff from JP Amazon outside of Nippon </br>  <br>Can't be helped. That the price you pay for being more faithful to Takeuchi's designs.</br>  <br> Last time I checked for JP Amazon you needed a JP address for your orders <br>So, last time you checked was 5 years ago?</br></br>  <br> Fucking why? How are they gonna explain having a mansion in the middle of the fucking city? <br>It's probably due to Melty Blood. In Melty Blood, Misaki becomes steadily more and more modernized and metropolitan with each new game. The very first story stage of the first Melty Blood was a new modern "artsy" building.<br><br>So this isn't really a surprising decision. Misaki's been transforming into this state for years now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Last time I was trying to get the CP BD set along with MBAACC, soo... Not too far off, actually.<br><br><br> Find out there's a Global option now <br>T-thanks, m8.</br></br></br></br></br>   complaining about everyone looking like Saber <br><br>Don't be daft. Takeuchi sameface has been a thing for over a decade. It's just that the design of that sameface has shifted over the years. Current Saber looks nothing like old Saber. Current Rin looks nothing like old Rin.<br><br>Hell, even if you only compare the pre-remake designs, compare Arcueid from Actress Again to her very first appearance in Tsukihime. Aside from the broad details, their faces look nothing alike. <br><br>It's not that everyone looks like Saber. It's that Takeuchi has a new sameface and he just happens to draw Saber the most, hence the parallels. But that has less to do with his obsession with Saber and more to do with the absolute lack of variety in his style.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also mahoyo aint getting a sequel for 20 years at the least kids. <br>Unless it's a silly sequel with a mindfuck of a flowchart, but we would have gotten that already.</br></br>    <br>How do you figure?<br><br>Nasu stated that he was gonna work on the remake after Mahoyo 2. This means that Mahoyo 2 was never gonna be made until after the Tsukihime remake was released.<br><br>It's not like he can work on two things simultaneously.</br></br></br></br></br>  Will we finally see Enhance's character design?  <br>SHIKI was so cool in the manga compared to the LN.</br>  <br>Assuming Enhance even still exists.<br><br>Nasu did say that not all of the old DAAs would make the cut.</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu won't throw away his Dante clone just like that.<br>Also<br> Tsukihime 2 </br></br></br>  <br><br>No point waiting, it's never gonna happen. What do YOU imagine him looking like? Pic related.</br></br>  I hope we get long skirt Arc back. <br><br><br> get the CP BD set along with MBAACC, soo... Not too far off, actually. <br>Man fucking French Bread and TM.<br><br> Releasing one of the best fighting games in such a retarded manner </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well Enhance does feed Ciel info about the Black Barrel and is mentioned in the story. It'd be kind of silly to scrap him.</br>    <br>I like the improvement.</br>  <br> Nasu won't throw away his Dante clone just like that. <br>And how do you figure? It's not like he's ever done much with him. You don't even actually know if he really liked Enhance that much.<br><br> Tsukihime 2 <br>It's nonsense.<br><br> Well Enhance does feed Ciel info about the Black Barrel and is mentioned in the story. It'd be kind of silly to scrap him. <br>It's a remake, and he's clearly changing a lot of things around. There's no reason he has to keep that particular story element considering how utterly minor it is.<br><br>Out of the Twenty-Seven, most of them have either made direct appearances or were at least mentioned in an official work. There's no reason to believe that any of them are safe just because they were referenced in Tsukihime.<br><br>I ain't holding my breath.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this, but apparently saying everything looks like seiba is a funny may may now. At least Takeuchi got better at anatomy and scaling, but yeah he really needs some variety in his faces besides regular, loli, and man.</br>  <br><br>Sasaki Shounen is a Roa/SHIKI fangirl, apparently. Pic semi-related. She also did that epic spread of 18th Roa, SHIKI, Elesia, and the original Roa, though I can't seem to find it.</br></br>  <br>No matter what Nasu makes, there's some guy out there to go "Fuck that shit".<br><br> Writing Fate related story <br> "Fuck that shit" <br> Doing more Tsukihime <br> "Fuck that shit" <br> Doing something new <br> "Fuck that shit" <br> Not doing anything <br> "Fuck that shit" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's nonsense. <br>Exactly, it's nonsense despite it's contents being a major plot point in the Nasuverse even being mentioned in recent works. The Aylesbury Ritual is a big thing we'll never see happen, I don't see much of a reason to scrap some of the characters tied to it. Out of the 27 there are some guaranteed keeps (Roa, Zelretch, ORT, Altrouge, Nero Chaos, everyone related to Altrouge in some way, Crimson Moon Brunestud) at most we'll get several axes and at least we'll get some re-orderings.</br></br>  As far as my estimate goes, the DAAs who are in the most danger of being cut are:<br> Rizo-Waal Strout <br> Forest of Einnashe <br> Fina-blood Svelten <br> Enhance <br> Louvre <br> Trhvmn Ortenrosse <br><br>Any DAA who's made an appearances or was mentioned in the Nasu-written Fate series are probably safe. This includes Primate Murder, Zelretch, ORT and Van-Fem. DAAs who were mentioned in the most recent Melty Blood Actress Again are also probably safe, since that implies that Nasu's attached enough to them to keep them. This includes Sumire and Stanrobe. Nrvnqsr and Wallachia are also most likely safe. And considering how tremendously important Crimson Moon Brunestud is to the entire world's lore, I'd say he's almost definitely safe too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot twenty of them in there</br>  <br>That's not even saber at this point.</br>  <br>Roa's not a member of the Twenty-Seven.<br><br>I think Nasu probably will expand on the Aylesbury Ritual someday, but I doubt it'll be in the form we're expecting. To begin with, he's recycled characters he created while messing around with the concept of Tsukihime 2. Both Bazett and Karen were among those recycled characters.<br><br>The way I figure, neither Talk nor Prelude are ever gonna be canon. There's a fairly strong chance Nasu will recycle elements from both, but it won't be for Tsukihime 2.<br><br>Nasu and Takeuchi have even admitted that "Tsukihime 2" is kind of a misnomer since the concepts they've brainstormed really have nothing to do with Tsukihime for the most part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Altrouge's Knights <br> in danger of being cut <br>More than anything they'll get a reordered because their placing made no sense considering the scale they number DAAs by.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Majin Saber<br><br>A fusion of Okita and Nonobunga, and it's entirely Saber.<br><br>That's even the joke they're making on that page, "Taaaakeuchi, why couldn't you wait until Grand Order before making another one!!!". Something like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They might just get replaced, or even altered into entirely different characters.<br><br>Nasu came up with these characters a decade ago. There's no way he still likes all of them as they are.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Those are pretty astute observations.<br><br>The three prominent DAAs in Meltan have really solid fanbases since they're fully realized characters, so it's really doubtful they'll get cut.<br><br> Altrouge's knights <br><br>Yeah, they're not really well defined at all, although they certainly fulfill a purpose of filling out Altrouge's faction.<br><br> Forest of Einnashe <br><br>On the one hand, it's not really important. On the other hand, it's flavorful and doesn't have much impact, so it might make it just because it's so easy to integrated. That in mind, since Nasu might prefer to portray the DAAs as exceedingly powerful and important, he may throw out examples of them which don't carry a lot of narrative weight to begin with.<br><br> Louvre <br> Trhvmn Ortenrosse <br><br>Both are boring as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Roa's not a member of the Twenty-Seven. <br><br>He's not a member of Twenty-Seven, but he IS a DAA, after all.</br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>The only sequels Nasu has done for anything have been silly, convoluted ones (KT, F/HA) that were released soon after the originals. Serious business sequels (Tsukihime 2) get talked about for years but never happen.</br>  <br>I think the concept of Altrouge's Knights will stay, but I doubt they'll be identical to how they were previously defined. The fact that Nasu has done jack shit with these character, not even mentioning them off-hand, seems to show that they're in shaky territory.<br><br>The Forest of Einnashe, from what I can tell, exists entirely to create a "seemingly impossible to kill thing" for Shiki to kill. No matter how strong you are, it's kinda hard to fight a forest.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsukihime 2 was the least-serious sequel of all. Literally every time it's brought up by either Nasu or Takeuchi, it was entirely in jest. Every single reference to it is as an in-joke. It's never NOT been an object of absolute ridicule. People just took it way more seriously than Nasu expected.</br>  <br> I think the concept of Altrouge's Knights will stay, but I doubt they'll be identical to how they were previously defined. <br><br>Yeah, I think that's likely as well.</br></br></br>  <br> Roa's not a member of the Twenty-Seven. <br>Roa is still a DAA, he's listed as an extra.<br><br> but I doubt it'll be in the form we're expecting <br>Well judging about every joke and bullshit they've made for it at most it'll be in LN form written by some different Author considering Nasu is willing to work with them looking at all the Fate spinoffs but that's a best case senario. At the end of the day it's just an event that may not ever see the light of day however Nasu did say at one point that TM wouldn't do a clocktower sequel, we kinda did get that somehow with the UBW adaptation so it might happen.  But seriously though, if there is another Fate which somehow happens around the Aylesbury Ritual then fuck Nasu. </br></br></br></br></br>   Two routes where you date maids <br>Fucking stupid. Isn't this supposed to be about vampires and dark shit?</br>  <br>Well originally, only Hisui had a route, but the playtesters were all "B-But where's the Kohaku route?". This apparently threw Nasu into high gear and he wrote the entire Kohaku route in like a week.</br>  <br>It's not really a secret that Mahoyo was planned as a trilogy from the start.</br>  <br>Why not read it and find out? Maids can be a part of dark shit sometimes.</br>  <br>Ironically, the maid routes are probably the darkest.</br>  <br>And it was fuckin awesome.</br>  <br>You better not be talking shit about Hisui</br>  <br>I dunno about that. The Twenty-Seven seem kinda different from the likes of Waver. They seem to be special to Nasu, even compared to other characters. <br><br>Vampires in general seem to be a little more complicated than Servants and Magi. I don't think Nasu would be willing to let other people make shit up about them the way they do with Servants.</br></br></br>  <br>Given Nasu's usual writing pace and how little there actually is to Kohaku's route that isn't just repeating Hisui's, a week seems about right.</br>  <br>Hisui True route motherfucker<br><br>Because FUCK YOU</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, I kind of would agree with that criticism on a base level. Hisui is my favorite route, but when I read the description of the story, I didn't exactly expect 2/5ths of the game to focus around maids.</br>  <br> Vampires in general seem to be a little more complicated than Servants and Magi. <br><br>In the sense that all of the DAAs do fucking bizarre shit.<br><br>The DAAs in Meltan are some of the most super-weirdos we've seen in the entire Nasuverse. Arguably THE most.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That route made me depressed as hell.<br>Almost all of the routes were depressing, but Hisui's was just brutal.</br></br>  <br> Roa, Nrvnqsr, Wallachia <br> living governance systems <br> threw away their personhood <br> don't even give a fuck <br> weirdos <br><br>well yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, Nasu allowed Narita to mess around with a DA trying to wish for the grail to inject ORT with some supercharged coffee to wake it up. DAAs don't exactly see much in the way of daylight or moonlight to keep in tune since they are mostly vampires with some freaks of Gaia and an Alien, if they were special to Nasu we'd see more of them instead of an exceptionally rare bone.</br>  <br> Disliking the maids </br>  <br>I would say Akiha's endings were still slightly worse outside of the people who just outright disliked her.</br>  <br><br>But anon, Archer is a counter guardian. <br>Now we've had Bayo and Dante like designs in type moon, I'm expecting a Vergil.</br></br></br>  <br>i still think it will be hilarious if and when ORT inevitably wakes up in that clusterfuck and its up to Gil, Enkidu and Richard the lionhearted to put it down.</br>  <br>They don't call it the dark side of the moon for nothing, eh?</br>  <br>I'd be beyond butthurt if Gil and Enkidu takes down ORT.</br>  <br>Yeah. Unlike with the Holy Grail and the Magus Association, it's a little hard to really imagine what the DAAs are like in Nasu's mind. You can make shit up about Servants and Magi, and the system of thaumaturgy in Nasu's world is fleshed out enough to kinda do your own thing with, but DAAs are far too varied, far too weird and just really difficult to figure out without having Nasu outline everything for you directly. And it's not like you can just make up your own DAA. There are Twenty-Seven, end of story, and they were all made by Nasu.<br><br>Vampires in general are far more restrictive a subject to use than anything in Fate.<br><br>The Church is also difficult due to how mysterious its inner workings are. We have a bunch of names and a few vague concepts, but even though there are no less than four major characters associated with the Church across Tsukihime, Fate and Melty, we still don't entirely know everything about it.<br><br>Hell, despite how fleshed out the Magus Association is in comparison to those things, there are still certain subjects that no one other than Nasu is willing to touch, such as True Magic. It's interesting how, despite how many stories deal with Magi, none of them ever touch the Queen of the Clock Tower, Barthomeloi Lorelei herself. Writers also refuse to touch things like Atlas or the Sea of Astray.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>as would I, but the thing is i could see it because narita tends to not give a singular fuck in his stories, especially the more supernatural it gets.<br>for example in Vamp! there are exactly zero fucks to be given anywhere.</br></br>  <br>That's still pretty safe, though. Narita is probably never gonna bring ORT into the story directly, and the Dead Apostle is still just a Dead Apostle. <br><br>The restrictive thing about vampires is that due to the rules set by Nasu, no vampire is allowed to be as powerful or unique as any member of the Twenty Seven. The Twenty Seven are at the top, no ifs, ands or buts. There's Roa, of course, but he's a well-noted exception. When it comes to vampires, most writers would have their hands tied.</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully Nasu won't let that happen, it would utterly fuck up DAAs image even further.</br>  <br> even further. <br>How's it been fucked up? No one's really touched the DAAs in years.</br></br>  So, no HF news this time?  <br>This guy.</br>  <br>I doubt we'll get a word until UBW's BD sales are secured.</br>  <br>What? I don't see any mention of it on the cover.</br>  <br>Not this time, this issue is mostly for F/GO, UBW and Tsukihime Remake apparently. Wait until after UBW BDs for any news or if anything you'll get news with HF Manga chapters.</br>  <br>I just want Altrouge.</br>  <br>No, you don't</br>  <br><br>Well, shit. Hope the wait isn't too long.</br></br>   Takeuchi wants to make a Twenty-Seven Saber Apostle Ancestors   <br>Considering people have been waiting for shit in TM Ace for much longer your wait is nothing much.</br>  Maybe Remake!Ciel won't be the victim of all that porn in pixiv.  <br>Shouldn't be hard. He can just pull 27 Sabers out of Unlimited Saber Works. <br><br>Arturia is DAA #1 obviously and Saber Lily is #27.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean all that ryona and guro? ayy. I don't know what makes Ciel attract those kind of artists.</br>  <br>Who are you kidding?</br>  <br>She can't die. No matter what you do to her, she'll live through it.<br><br>I suppose that has a certain appeal to those types.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ciel is my Type-Moon of choice, and I'm die-hard vanilla.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's the whole immortality thing.</br>   Tsukihime remake finally out <br> they replace EVERY voice actor but Yuzu-nee <br><br>Well?</br></br></br>  <br> no Jouji Nakata </br>    Homo route unlocked  <br><br>I really hope that the remake deals more implications of her immortality, her formerly being Roa, and her connections to both Roa and Arcueid. There's a lot to work with there that was never touched, and now she's just the gag character who loves curry and fights with Arc.</br></br>  <br>Dicknipples?</br>  <br>He's working to surpass the manga, so shit that was in the manga will probably get in the game.</br>  <br> He's working to surpass the manga <br>It's one hell of a manga, making that the best news I've ever heard out of T-M.</br></br>  Gaywayn thinking Holy Swords belong in the bath<br><br>Hakuno misusing game-play mechanics.</br></br>  <br>Among many other things. I think I saw her being fucked by ghoul/zombie too, hadn't seen that one before.</br>  <br>They won't stop talking about it<br><br> Nasu: As the creator, I'm extremely happy to see the love of my fans manifest itself in these type of spin-offs. I gain a lot from it. However, I'm a bit old-fashioned, and believed that the best situation for any creator is to be able to give birth to their own original creation. I thought there was nothing greater than to be able to think up your own world and your own characters, and then create a story revolving around them. So, I'm happy to see lots of TYPE-MOON spin-offs, but at the same time, I felt sad that people are spending so much of their valuable time building off my work. However, I was able to read the comment that Sasaki Shounen wrote when the final chapter of the manga Tsukihime (*3) was published: "If possible, I wish I could go on drawing this manga forever." That's when I realized. He was doing this because to him, it was more enjoyable than anything else. I was stupid to think he was wasting his time. <br><br> Uro: No matter what the "original" concept may be, I think any sort of manifestation is fine as long as the author is enjoying it. The "Authors need their own castle" mindset is a bit outdated, I think. <br><br> Nasu: I think we can see that in Hiroyama Hiroshi, who's clearly pouring all of his talent into Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya (*4). AND he's enjoying it. (Laughs) <br><br> Takeuchi: It's true, whenever I read Prisma Illya, I keep thinking "No, that's a good idea, save it for when you do your own original work!" That's how good it is. <br><br> Uro: I think that's the strength of TYPE-MOON, that it's supported by so many passionate creators. Like Marvel Comics (*6), who gave birth to X-Men (*5), I think it's a great idea to encourage even more spin-offs by talented creators. There aren't many other works that have so many spin-offs and anthology works, including Fate/Zero. I would even say that TYPE-MOON works are the closest thing Japan has to a Marvel Comics. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hisui has the face of Saber. Never in my life have I seen Takeuchi go against Saber.</br>    <br>Couple more from UBW Box set<br><br> &gt;The CG of the main characters have already been released, are they the same ones from the original work? <br><br>Takeuchi: The reason we released the CG for Tsukihime is to let the fans once again experience the feeling of Tsukihime. The actual game CG will be completely redrawn; there may even be characters with modified designs.<br><br> &gt;In the film version of Kara no Kyoukai, Touko's design was also changed drastically, will it be the same for Tsukihime? <br><br>Takeuchi: There shouldn't be any change of that magnitude. The manga version of Melty Blood and Tsukihime are still being serialized, and they are all related. Also, many like the current design, so I can't make any more design decisions by myself like with Touko. If there is going to be change, it will be on the level of clothe and hairstyle. It would be great if we can achieve the level of upgrade as Rebuild of Evangelion (laughs).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Tsukihime has been adapted into many other media such as anime and manga, those who will play it are probably fans of TYPE-MOON. This should be wonderful news for this group of people? <br><br>Takeuchi: The original doujin game is something that is very hard to come by nowadays, so we feel bad for not releasing a remake for those who have always wanted to try out this game. If one wants to know the content of the story, one can go read the manga Shingetsutan Tsukihime. The manga version is a pictorial representation of Nasu's work. The excellence of the Tsukihime manga has also become a great challenge that we need to surpass for the Tsukihime remake (laughs). We hope to create a game that can be enjoyed differently than the manga version.<br><br> &gt;Aoko appeared in both Tsukihime and Melty Blood, does this mean those games take place in the same world? <br><br>Takeuchi: Of course they share the same worldview, but it's better to view them as different stories. For example, the Kohaku from Tsukihime and the Kohaku from Melty Blood feel like totally different people (laughs). The Aoko-sensei everyone is familiar with will also be a totally different person. Tsukihime's Aoko-sensei is an accomplished magus, in Mahoutsukai no Yoru she is still an inexperienced mage still growing up. Fans who knew her from other works will be surprised: "So this is how the old Aoko-sensei is like!"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hopefully Shiki will be more than a bland self-insert for once. If this actually does every come out.<br><br>Then, no matter how good it may or may not be when released, everyone will then use it to flame Fate as hard as possible and insist the Tsukihime remake is better, regardless of its actual quality.</br></br>  <br>Not-entirely-apt Saber comparison aside, Hisui was Takeuchi's purpose in life until he came up with Saber and went full-blown Unlimited King of Knights.</br>  <br>I love Takeuchi - he actually answers the questions sometimes.</br>  <br>But Tsukihime is already better than Fate.</br>  <br>When I look at Mahoyo it's hard not to think the Tsukihime remake will be better. The original is already better than Fate &amp; UBW.</br>  <br>J-J-JAM IT IN</br>  <br> not pretending your an omnipotent observer watching over mortals as they struggle <br><br>Plebeians.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't remind me. This fact is depressing.<br><br><br>The manga did great as far as I'm concerned. If the remake achieves even a fraction of th--<br><br>...<br><br>Well fuck. I don't want to hope, b-but...<br><br>Also<br> captcha: find the bread <br>H-how fitting</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The original Tsukihime was pretty meh. See: completely bland MC, quite possibly genuinely retarded main heroine, routes that don't build off each other, and the Near and Far side separation totally cuts the story apart. Half of the cast is suddenly meaningless depending on which moon side route you're on. And it's pretty unanimous that Mahoyo is average.</br>  <br>Nasu always seems to know what he's talking more. He also wrote all the new scenes in the new anime, including the epilogue. <br><br>  &gt;The 「UBW」 anime was created with a pretty tight arrangement alongside ufotable. How exactly did that come about? Also, as there were various original scenes in the anime, who was the one who came up with the ideas? &lt;Rio&gt; <br><br> Nasu: Explaining even only the details regarding that arrangement would take up this entire interview, so I can't discuss it here. The original scenes were scenes proposed by the director. He would let us know where he wanted a new scene, and I would make it. <br><br> Takeuchi: The additional episode in the 2nd season was brutal... they wanted a 5 minute scene added, and this guy writes and submits a scene big enough to fill a whole episode! <br><br> Nasu: Blame the people who gave it to me. <br><br> What is the role of the eyeball that appears in Blood Fort Andromeda? Is it the Backbeard's? &lt;Aisaka Riku&gt; <br><br>Nasu: Everyone forgets this, but that is Medusa's eyeball. It seals other people within oneself, hence why it's called Blood Fort Andromeda [Outer-Seal, Blood Temple]. The entire school building has been pulled into the eyeball of a monster.<br><br>Takeuchi: Like a Conceptual Barrier? If it goes too far, won't it turn into the Shapeless Island?<br><br>Nasu : Oui, Monsieur. The devil's den that Perseus escaped is invoked by Shinji, it is meant to be ironic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The VN sucked. The manga, on the other hand, was great.</br>  <br> See: completely bland MC <br>That's your opinion<br> quite possibly genuinely retarded main heroine <br>Hating on Arc? I'll fucking cut you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> quite possibly genuinely retarded main heroine <br>But that's wrong. Arc just doesn't really know about the modern world.</br></br>  <br> The VN sucked <br>Die.</br></br>  <br>Are they married?</br>  <br> The manga version of Melty Blood and Tsukihime are still being serialized <br>wait what? where?</br></br>  <br>Little bit<br><br>  Q: What does the minus sign mean on stat sheets? I've been wondering about this for years, and it's starting to cause my head to go bald so an answer would be greatly appreciated. <br><br>  Nasu: Oh dear. The minus sign is basically for when something qualified for a B in terms of rank, but is not quite a B-rank in terms of power, closer to C-rank, even. Think of it as a number that isn't quite reliably stable. And do take care of your hair. <br><br>  Takeuchi: So it's kind of like how your pace of writing output starts getting shaky when video game you're hyping is around the corner. <br><br>  Nasu: Thank you for the all too illuminating example. Do  <br>take care of your mushroom.<br><br>Q: Why do you like drawing Saber-faces so much?<br> Nasu: I'd like to know that too. <br> Takeuchi: Huh, what's with this atmosphere? You're making me seem like I'm a weirdo, like I'm a perverse dude or something. <br> Nasu: You've been doing this for over 10 years; you're plenty perverse. "Doing what you set out to do" is a handy expression, isn't it. <br> Takeuchi: Oh man, I just got told by the guy who's still adding stuff to the Fate canon even as he keeps saying he "doesn't wanna"... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Awesome news about Tsukihime remake, now if only they announced a Fate route readaptation  <br> Look, he's hardcore and edgy, he's not bland! </br>  <br>Man I love their dynamic. I wish they would actually work on things sometimes though</br>  <br>It did. It really did.<br><br>Then the manga came by, took everything interesting about the story and characters, and made something pretty damn good. Tsukihime's content itself is interesting. The VN just executed it terribly compared to the manga.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Does the manga ever acknowledge why Ciel 'hates' Arc?</br></br>  <br>Bland implies he is run-of-the-mill.<br>Tohno Shiki is, but Nanaya Shiki is entertaining as fuck and one of the reasons why I love the VN, outside of the developed heroines.</br></br>  <br> look shirou can cook and wants to save EVERYTHING, he's not bland! </br>  <br>I don't think Shiki's handful of forced insanity scenes gives his character any depth or personality. He's either<br>A) Being batshit<br>B) Being a bland self-insert<br><br>Having a villain that makes Shiki occasionally go crazy or something other than totally bland doesn't help his character.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not even going to justify that because you know it's bullshit and you're just throwing out crap.<br><br>Really? You faggots laugh at characters like Sasuke, but Nanaya is cool? He's an edgy faggot, the type /a/ loves to hate. What makes him any different than the other edgy characters that don't have anything personnel against you, kid?</br></br></br>  <br> Nasu rags on Takeuchi for his Saber obsession <br> Takeuchi rags on Nasu from always coming back to Fate instead of working on new stuff <br>It's genuinely reassuring to know they acknowledge their faults and how they effect the fans.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you need to stop making such wild generalizations</br>  <br>So, the normal version of the character is bland/run-of-the-mill, but the 3edgy5me version of him is super interesting.</br>  <br> Really? You faggots laugh at characters like Sasuke, but Nanaya is cool? <br>Nanaya is hot stuff, m8. Sasuke was all about the keikakus, Nanaya is simple and just does whatever the hell he wants.</br></br>  <br>How am I wrong? /a/ always shits on the edgy types, that's a fact. How is Nanaya any better, he's got more DARKNESS than Sasuke. Are you just saying you like the dark hardcore edgy characters?<br><br>Because then I've got something completely different to laugh at you about.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder Takeuchi is the best bro and the reason TYPE MOON is what it is today  <br>She doesn't, if you paid attention to their routes you'd know it as well. Ciel herself early on has a discussion about how vampires aren't evil, but since their existence is contrary to humans in a way that puts them in danger, it's a fight for survival between species sort of thing. It's not good or evil or black and white, it's the whole innocent monster theme you see in every Nasu story. One species can only bring harm to another by existing, they must fight for this reason.<br><br>Her ideals put her a bit contary to normal Church ideals in some ways perhaps, but she's made her own peace with it.<br><br>Ciel is all business, she even says flat out that only recently is the first time she's even talked to Arc, not before this so much. She knows why she has to kill vampires, why she can't let them live, she can't go easy on any of them. When she's on the clock she has to be a hardass, she's basically Rin.<br><br>There's only been one DA or DAA she's spared before because he taught her to love curry or whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> possibly genuinely retarded main heroine </br>  <br>Can you self insert any harder?</br>  <br> How am I wrong? /a/ always shits on the edgy types, that's a fact. How is Nanaya any better, he's got more DARKNESS than Sasuke. <br><br>I don't even know whats going on but Sasuke is the edge lord.</br></br></br>  You fucking faggots arguing about self-insert or not ruin these threads all the time, please kill yourselves.  <br>You're entirely forgetting that Ciel used to be Roa</br>  <br> He's working to surpass the manga <br> So he's going to use stuff in the manga <br><br>Do you not see the flaw in this conclusion? If he wants to SURPASS the manga, why the hell would he use details FROM the manga? You can't surpass something by copying it. Not to mention, most of the best parts of the manga were literally copied from Nasu's other works anyway. Shiki's CQC was taken directly from Melty Blood, most of the extra story elements were taken from Character Material and the like.<br><br>Either way, it's actually surprisingly rare for Nasu to use stuff written by other authors. He happily lets others use his stuff however they want, but the reverse almost never happens. Even Jeanne and Karna were originally Servants HE created.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't implying I was self-inserting.<br>I was implying that you can have all the development you want and still have a boring character. If I wanted interesting characters, I can just go outside.<br>I'll take my "nothin personnel, kid" and have a blast instead.</br></br></br>  <br>LONDON<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br>I think Sasuke's losing the contest</br></br></br>  <br>Listen anon, it's all about presentation. Sasuke? Yeah, he was presented as "cool" but he all he did was whine and job.<br><br>But Nanaya? Nanaya is a pure killing machine, whose sole existence is killing, He was no emotions aside from the euphoria that he feels when he kills something. How's that not cool?</br></br></br>  It's all awesome.<br><br>Shirou is Naruto<br>Shiki is Sasuke without the emofaggotry</br></br></br>  <br>Will there ever be an updated version of this with every member of Shiki's harem?</br>  <br>The manga surpassed the original VN by using stuff from the VN. Do you not see the flaw in your conclusion?</br>  <br>That's not really a big reason why she's not keen on vamps, despite it giving her something of a personal angle. She has a whole conversation in the tea room how she can't really consider them evil, but she knows why its necessary that she kill them if humans should live.</br>  <br> You can't surpass something by copying it. <br>Are you serious, Gilgamesh King of Jobbers?</br></br>  <br> But Nanaya? Nanaya is a pure killing machine, whose sole existence is killing, He was no emotions aside from the euphoria that he feels when he kills something. How's that not cool? <br>Oh god, you've got to be baiting or joking now. You sound like such a fucking faggot.<br><br> Look at him, he commits mass murder and gets a hard-on from it, hardcore, he's cool! </br></br></br></br>  So this mean we will no longer suppress Roa in Ciel's ass?   Calling Shirou Naruto when he's voiced by Sasuke and they're both Archers     <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br> the euphoria that he feels when he kills something. How's that not cool? </br>  <br> not thinking its cool <br>Look at this loser.</br></br>  Why are fatefags always trying to start shit?  <br> Half of the cast is suddenly meaningless depending on which moon side route you're on <br>Welcome to visual novels and non-linear branching stories.</br></br>  <br> You can't surpass something by copying it. Not to mention, most of the best parts of the manga were literally copied from Nasu's other works anyway. Shiki's CQC was taken directly from Melty Blood, most of the extra story elements were taken from Character Material and the like. <br><br>Nasu created Gilgamesh, Urobuchi improved Gilgamesh making him more fleshed out, Nasu grabbed the new characterization for him from Zero and double fleshed it out while improving it further for CCC. Thus he improved it by copying, and creating upon it more.<br><br>You can surpass things by copying</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that a Gil's and Saber's love child?</br>  Is this remake gonna have H CG?  <br>I hope not. It's better if he creates new things. Plus, I feel it's kinda shameless to copy a work that's derivative of your own work. <br><br>If Nasu has any pride, that's the last thing he'd do.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like Touhou, you let the fans create a bit, and then you use that as a basis to do it better.</br>  <br>Yes. Lots.</br>  <br><br>Can't wait to see more maid raping.</br></br>  <br>Of course not. TM wants to purge any notion of H from their works or history itself. That's why they offer free RN Fate shit instead of original.</br>  <br> You can surpass things by copying </br>  <br>But ZUN doesn't really do that. More often than not, he does his own thing and completely destroys the built up fanon. Remember how Letty and Cirno were best friends? <br><br>ZUN doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Fate/Strange Caster can do it<br><br>Shirou's just not good enough</br></br></br>  <br>That won't be possible since I'm sure they won't repeat the stupid mistake of having it voiceless like Mahoyo</br>  <br> Nasu knowing shame <br><br>This is the guy that has no qualms with saying that Prisma Illya is the canon Illya route. Shame is probably the last thing he feels.<br><br>Also, remaking one of your older novels when you can count the number of original works he's penned with your hand is a pretty lame.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He was no emotions aside from the euphoria that he feels when he kills something. How's that not cool? </br>  <br>You know it.</br>  <br> Urobuchi improved Gilgamesh making him more fleshed out <br>You mean Zero? Did we read the same thing?</br></br>  <br>Its not that hard to improve Gil from Fate/Stay Night though, where he basically just shows up with a half assed reason to be evil and be defeated.</br>  <br>The rating is R-18, what do you think?</br>  Nasu always finds inspiration from things<br><br> The terms "Tradition Protection" and "Anti-Purge Defense" come up all the time, what are these! &lt;TG09&gt; <br><br> Nasu: For tradition protection, if an attack does not follow specific rules it will not connect. This is possessed by Alice Kuonji's Ploy Kickshaw, for example. Basically, it's not an actual defense, per se, but something with restrictive conditions. Anti-purge defense is something we'll be talking about in more detail soon, so please wait just a bit longer on that one. For now, I can simply say that it is an ultimate defense against a level of attack that could even end the world. <br><br> Takeuchi: That term came about around the same time as the Panzer World Galient OVA ...did you really like the term that much? <br><br> Nasu: Enough to make it the most ultimate defense ever. <br><br> This is about Kuzuki-sensei who is physically stronger than regular people. Aside from his fists being strengthened by Caster, are the rest his own strength, or did Caster strengthened other parts of his body as well? &lt;Soujuurou of the Hill&gt; <br><br> Nasu: In the anime version his entire body is strengthened. When the excessively worrying Caster buffed him to ten times that of a normal human, since Kuzuki's base strength is higher than a normal human, he became even more ridiculous, and did the unthinkable during his fight with Saber. Caster was surprised herself: "What the? Isn't my Master a little too strong?!" <br><br> Takeuchi: On a side note, it was also thanks to Caster's help that Kuzuki was able to move inside to Rider barrier. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We'll be seeing Anti Purge in Grand/Order most likely<br><br>Its noted Excalibur gains a special bonus when the world is in danger.</br></br></br>  <br>His whole motivation for destroying humanity is fleshed out in CCC. You might like Urobuchi, but what he did in Zero didn't help Gil's characterization at all. He looked more Chaotic Evil that Chaotic Good there.</br>  <br> TYPE-MOON works are the closest thing Japan has to a Marvel Comics <br><br>Please give us an Avengers equivalent, Nasu. Please.<br><br>I'd sell my left nut to see older Shirou, Rin, older Shiki, Luvia, Arcueid, and Ciel fight against DAAs and prevent Dark Six's resurrection. It'd be dumb if Saber were around, no matter how much I love her.<br><br>Seriously, that end-of-the-world ritual is perfect fuel for a TM Avengers series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really can't say I see the point of Nasu copying the manga. I could understand if it were an animated work, because then you'd be able to see a cool scene in motion. But copying the manga into a light novel seems pointless. You already have the manga. It's a visual medium. The cool stuff's already there.<br><br>What's the point of taking the cool stuff from the manga and then transferring it into a visual novel? Does no one else find this kinda dumb? I don't need Tsukihime the Manga in VN format. That just feels redundant.<br><br>Nasu doesn't need to copy the manga to make a neat product.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I was strictly speaking of FSN Gil and not Urobuchi/Nasu as a writer. While FZ Gil wasn't all that amazing either, he at least had more character and just wasn't the end boss.<br>I'm glad he was more fleshed out in CCC though.</br></br>  <br>Those two are eternally married.</br>  <br> His whole motivation for destroying humanity is fleshed out in CCC <br>Care to elaborate? I'm curious, and CCC translations never. All we really got was Gilgamesh thought humanity had grown too much and too many of us were now worthless, etc.<br><br>Pretty true.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds, limited animation (see some of the stuff in Mahoyo). VNs in a way can sort of be a step between a manga and a show.</br>  <br>You could probably make some cool looking CGs using the manga as a reference.</br>  <br>I doubt he's going to copy it, just use some ideas from it, like the extra bit at the end where Shiki reunites with Arc. He obviously can't outright copy it since it's not 5 split routes.</br>  <br>Source?</br>    <br>https://tsukinoura.wordpress.com/20<wbr>13/12/15/entry-111-someone-elses-dr<wbr>eam/<br><br>https://tsukinoura.wordpress.com/20<wbr>14/08/30/entry-130-who-needs-immort<wbr>ality-anyway/<br><br>Here's some important moments in the game for Gilgamesh's character and motivation. Whatever he's talking about is probably in there somewhere.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Artist and writer are total bros and have finished many well-regarded works together <br><br>I am so fucking jealous.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But Avengers was a terrible movie</br></br>  <br> finished many...works <br>About that...</br></br>  <br><br>I don't really think that's enough justification.<br><br>I don't really particularly have any interest in seeing the manga transferred into VN form. If it were an animated adaptation, then I'd totally be all for it, but if it's a VN, I'd rather just see something completely new.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he means this conversation between Enkidu and Gil?<br><br> There was a monster called Humbaba. We combined our powers to defeat it. I asked him, why did you decide to defeat Humbaba? It wasn’t an order from the gods. And I don’t think it was for the sake of the people of Uruk either. <br><br> “It was to protect Uruk though? If we don’t defeat all evil on the Earth, our people will starve to death.” <br><br> So why, I asked again. He made the people of Uruk suffer by his tyranny, so why was he worried for them now? <br><br> “It’s not so strange. I was born to be a protector of humanity, after all. Building the future of this planet is the king’s duty.” As he said that, his gaze was so far away. So far not even I, who was made in the same way, could see what he was seeing. “There are different kinds of protection. Just guarding things from danger is not protection. There are times when even the north wind is necessary.” <br><br> This time, I understood him perfectly. “I see. So you preferred the path you saw here.” <br><br> He laughed as if embarrassed. It was a laugh like a cool breeze, one he sometimes laughed as a child. <br><br> …I understood why he preferred isolation. It was because the path he had chosen was one he had to walk alone. He said he was protecting a distant future he could see. That was why he had to be alone, hating gods and men. The more he loved the future of humanity, the less he could be involved with anyone. Arbitrator and reaper. The king obtains only the results. There was no way he, who was more than human, could intervene in the glorious process from which such results are born. <br><br> “Well, results may be an uninteresting fabric, but I’ve decided to look after them until it’s finished, so I will.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Other anon already beat me to it but yeah, she... really doesn't. Do you even remember Ciel giving Shiki lip for trying to reach Arc after she JUST saved his neck and brought him back to Akiha for emergency care? She ends up bringing Shiki to Arc anyway, despite the fact that he could barely stand, and explain to him how Roa and Arc's relationships are, going so far as to show both empathy and understanding of Roa's situation. And in the epilogue, Ciel is blatantly shown as the one to guide Shiki to Arc's castle to reunite them.<br><br>This isn't all for Shiki, she acknowledge and respects Arc too.  Senpai best wing-girl. <br><br>And that's not even counting MBAACC. Translations never, but Archetype Earth's mid-boss and pre-final boss are BOTH Ciel. Even ARCHETYPE EARTH appreciates Ciel, going on about destroying the world but willing to preserve Ciel and Shiki because the former loves her most and the latter understands her (as normal Arc) the most, since Ciel HAS been spending the whole route trying to slap Arc back to normal.<br><br>Then there's "Talk", where she and Merem both let Shiki go to deliver the fruit of Einnashe to Arc, knowing it'll hold her bloodlust back longer.<br><br>As  put it, she's pure business. And excels at it too, she's just also good at looking at the big picture and making excuses.  Rin is a babby amateur next to the stuff Ciel pulls, though. Senpai's ruthlessness is more on par with Archer's level. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Waver as the Director Fury character, guiding all the younger mages/agents.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>Regardless of whatever your opinion is, KnK, Tsukihime, and FSN are all very well regarded.</br>  <br>It won't be a direct copy, of course. Just little things that Nasu probably liked that he will put into the game.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127372595 <br> only 5 <br>You do realize that's a lot, right? Especially considering how big most of them are.</br></br>  <br>The 'well-regarded' was specifically the part I wasn't calling bullshit on. Your reading comprehension is deplorable.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127372595 <br>A number of those works have more words than some of the longest novels in recorded history.</br>  <br>Hnng my heart</br>  <br>Why is she so perfect?</br>  <br>All the stuff in the manga were just adapted from what Nasu himself had already written, though. So if there's really anything to adapt from the manga, it's the structure in which the parts were laid out. <br><br>Anyway, I'm honestly wondering just how much of the original doujin source will be left once the remake's done. What if it ends up being something almost completely unrecognizable?</br></br></br>  <br>Then what are you trying to call bullshit on? The "many" part? Because just FSN and Tsukihime together is already an insane amount of content.</br>  <br>It's in one of the Grand Order Articles on 4gamer.net which is entirely in Japanese.<br> 4gamer: There's just one thing I've been wondering... Will Tsukihime be all-ages? <br> Takeuchi: Hmmm, it might be 18+ for its depiction of violence. It wouldn't be Tsukihime if we couldn't show blood being shed or bodies being cut apart. We want it to have a certain degree of venom. </br></br></br>  So is the issue out now? As in I can order it from the local japanese book store and get it?  <br>Is written violence really worth an 18+ rating? I don't think Takeuchi's skilled enough to draw detailed gore.</br>  <br>Considering Takeuchi originally wanted to draw CGs for every one of Shiki's killing sprees in the alleyways he might be getting some help. There are also some VNs who get R-18 because of violence alone. At this point it's unclear if it will have H-scenes or not but we know it's gonna be 18+.</br>  <br> tfw put in a comission asking someone to color Arc's final 2-page spread with Shiki, pic related <br> not even into Shiki/Arc but that glorious image has been my home PC desktop wallpaper for the past 2 years <br>muh feels</br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't a Shiki/Arc person myself but the manga made them look so perfect together.</br>  <br><br><br>Some of the erotic content of the original was somewhat important to the story as well.

One of the most noticeable ones is that Roa rapes face now.</br></br>  <br> cooks Arc instant ramen with garlic in it <br> no fucks <br>Why is Shiki so based?</br></br></br>  <br> implying I'm an Arcfag <br> Not even close.

Its an entire concept in the game.<br><br>If they wanted to write another Anti Hero that fits into that mold they could. The class was created as the closest representation to fit Angya Manyu, however others could apply as long as the mold exists.<br><br>It's like how there's the Saver class for Messiahs, you can't say "But that's just a class for Buddha" after all. It was the closest class created that could contain Buddha, but others could fit in it since the mold now exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That is exactly it.</br></br>  <br>The translations a bit wonky, but here's the interview<br><br>http://pastebin.com/QkN6UUwM</br></br></br>  <br>Proof that I've earned my masters degree in pointless autism. No one else can even compete anymore.</br>  <br><br>daaayyyuumm roa<br><br>i should read this</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the point.<br><br>It doesn't matter whether he OK'd it or not. What matters is that the remake is distinct from the manga. We don't need a VN adaptation of the manga. That's just circular and redundant. I mean, really, an adaptation of an adaptation? Is that seriously what you people want?<br><br>You love the manga. I get it. I love it too. But what I DON'T want to see is Nasu rehash the manga for the remake. Nasu's the one who CREATED Tsukihime. Not only that, but he also created Kara no Kyoukai, Kagetsu Tohya, Melty Blood, Fate/stay night and Fate/EXTRA. He wrote all these things. He wrote Talk and Prelude. <br><br>The idea that the only way for Nasu to create a work that surpasses the manga is by copying it is entirely absurd. If Nasu wants to create a superior product, then he should be able to create one on his own terms, and not by copying Sasaki's ideas.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You've been bitching about this for hours now.</br>  <br>Nah, your translation is spot on<br>source: I have a degree in pointless bullshit</br></br>  <br>Looks fine to me, but Arcueid always looks good to me.</br>  <br>What are you gonna do about it? Call me a faggot over the internet?</br>  <br> Tsukihime was released on floppy disks. <br><br>Seriously?</br></br></br>  <br>Yup, came out in 2000 IIRC</br>  <br> has the entire collection on paper in French since fuck the english publishers, I'm fluent anyway <br> also has clean raws of the whole manga on my PC   and I'd be translating the post-epilogue bonus special from French to English if I wasn't a lazy fuck <br>feels good to have it all at my fingertips<br><br><br>You should. It is the undisputed consensus by all primaries that the Tsukihime manga is among one of the best things to ever grace TYPE-MOON.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Roa Elesia<br><br>Dark Elesia<br><br>Darelesia<br><br>Daelesia<br><br>Delesia<br><br>Delicious</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally no one wants him to copy the manga wholesale.<br><br>Everybody wants him to take inspiration from the manga because the manga is really good, probably better overall than the original Arc route.<br><br>What's the problem?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 4gamer.net <br><br>this ? http://www.4gamer.net/games/266/G02<wbr>6651/20150626148/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Because I'd rather he do his own thing, than take "inspiration from the manga". The manga is the manga, the remake is the remake. I mean, really, if you really think the manga's so much better than anything Nasu's written, why even look forward to the remake at all?</br>  <br>Because the manga has no Ciel, Akiha, or Hisui routes</br>  <br> if you really think the manga's so much better than anything Nasu's written <br><br>Are you saying this as though you believe I think the Tsukihime manga surpasses everything Nasu has ever written? I don't believe that, although I certainly don't think Nasu is a flawless writer. For example, I'm a person who believes F/Z is a superior work to F/SN overall.<br><br>That said, I think the Tsukihime manga is better than the originally written Arc route in most ways at telling the same story. This does not necessarily reflect badly on the original Arc route - all the emotion and drama that went into it from the beginning is something I quite enjoy. But as a work of the Nasuverse? The manga is presently the better portrayal. If the Tsukihime remake took it and adapted it wholesale in place of the original Arc route except adding in text where the manga cut lines of dialogue from the original, then I sincerely believe it'd be an improvement.<br><br>They could do this and I might be satisfied, but it's not necessarily what I WANT Nasu to do. Not at all. Furthermore, the manga would in no way adequately cover the stories of the other heroines, which would have to be remade individually anyway.<br><br>That said, I do not want an action for action, scene for scene remake of the manga. But to take inspiration from it? When it's the best example released thus far? That's a very good thing.<br><br>If I'm being perfectly honest, what I'm REALLY looking out for is improvements to the DAAs (Nrvnqsr getting more screentime, likely would have been rectified by Sacchin route in the original VN anyway; Roa being the scary motherfucker he was by the end of the manga) and Nasu maintaining Kohaku as a rape victim. If he censors Kohaku's original past here, I will never forgive him. But that's just me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nasu's also improved a lot since then. If I'm being perfectly honest, I think some of his more recent stuff easily surpasses the Tsukihime manga. I think he's more than capable of creating something better than the manga without taking anything from it.</br>  <br><br>Which more recent stuff do you like?<br><br>Personally I'm a little fed up with the works made by authors who aren't him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate/EXTRA CCC.</br>        So guys should I read Tsukihime or wait for the remake.    <br><br>Ah.<br><br>Well, to each his own!<br><br>It's not entirely just another example of Type-Moon getting less and less possible to take seriously in any dramatic sense. Some of the cosmological stuff was okay, I suppose!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What is with this awful use of fonts and sizes?<br><br>fucking cancer</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Read Tsukihime, then wait for the remake.</br></br>  Soon.    <br>Finally, we get to see what Nasu's Jeanne is like. Hopefully she's not a faggot slut like Apocrypha Jeanne.</br>  <br>Let me put it this way- Type-Moon announced in 2008 that they were working on the remake, the remake designs were released in 2010(?), and otherwise this is the first we've actually heard about it. It'll be another 15 years before the game is actually released.</br>  <br><br>I wonder if Roa is like this whenever he's incarnated as a woman.</br></br>  They've got a point<br><br>Just who is that red guy?</br></br>  <br>Isn't that Ajax?</br>  <br>That's only a fan theory so far, and nothing else.</br>  <br>And then who knows how long for it to be translated.<br><br>But it's okay. I should be able to read Japanese in 25 years.</br></br></br>  I mean if Red Guy was Ajax, then why does he seem to know Saber?<br><br>Was King Arthur in the Trojan War?</br></br>  Also Red Guy seems to know that Blue Fellow in the first few episodes who uses a spear.<br><br>Are we supposed to believe Blue Guy is Hector?</br></br>  <br> Archer is there <br><br>Oh c'mon anon. It's pretty obvious.</br></br></br>          <br>the remake will never come out, and then add 5 years for it to get translated to english</br>  <br>why basketball ?</br>  <br>We've seen Rho Aias before, it's some seven ringed flower, not a giant cross.<br><br>If this was the real Rho Aias then why hasn't Archer been tracing that thing all this time?<br><br>It's not even a retcon, its just not congruent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 18+ <br> for VIOLENCE <br>Where's the HCG?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so.<br><br>I mean, that shield looks nothing like Rho Aius.</br></br></br>  <br>These tend to have a hell of a lot of nudity.</br>  <br>Poor Okita.</br>  <br> Only 5 years <br>Dohohoho</br></br>  <br>It is an ero game after all<br><br>Gotta be 18+ to see this sexy action.</br></br></br>  <br>Cause Archer's origin is sword not shields. We are not given a direct explanation, but I don't remember if Archer ever said it was a perfect copy, so he could have modified it for easier <br>projecting. <br><br>Of course, that's still just fan theory. But really, Archer only appears in how many of these character reveal comics? It seems a little funny <br>that he just so happens to appear in one introducing an Ajax like figure</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Rho Aias a conceptual weapon? It's based on the tomb and the flower.<br><br>That might be the real deal.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a stress reliever.<br><br>Don't you feel like playing basketball when an important deadline is coming up, anon-kin?</br></br></br>  <br>no anon-senpai, If I have stress I just go to fap.</br>  <br>Maybe some stupid reference lost in translation/edition.<br><br>I mean, they put "reaitsu". Weeaboo enough.</br></br></br>  <br> Archer only appears in how many of these character reveal comics? <br><br>Four or five probably, characters seem to come and go at random with this comic. He was there during the Majin Saber character reveal as well to get beaten.<br><br>Akiha and Kohaku appear a lot as well, and sometimes Nero. Even occasionally Kintoki.</br></br></br></br></br>  ORT also appears strangely a lot  Not so much particularly the character reveal ones      <br>These guda comics are full of references and stuff only japs will get.<br><br>I don't understand why people even bother translating that when there's so much important shit out there asking for love.</br></br></br>  where could I buy TM Ace online?    <br> I don't understand why people even bother translating that  <br><br>because is short and quickly ?</br></br></br>  <br>Well any time someone translates something, someone doesn't understand why they didn't just do this other thing instead since the thing they did wasn't good.

Something something cunt something alpha something captain  Such an overrated series  <br>Give me more sad/somber pieces like this from S1 and S2 /a/.<br><br>I need to get in the mood to write my shitty novels.</br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/scllcaqpom.mp3<wbr></wbr>  <br>Its pretty much entirely sad piano tracks.<br><br>Not a bad thing really.</br></br></br>  Now that's alpha.

Goes well with Iroha considering she brings back the rom-com amidst all the seriousness.<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/doijqtqnbt.mp3<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>You could call it genuine, or you could call it 不合理な感情</br>  Did 8man's monologues get worse in S2? I felt like S1's monologues were more memorable.  <br>8man got worse overall as a character in s2, and I didn't even like his antisocial loner act in s1.</br>  <br>S1 was much slower and actually had time for him to monolouge. S2 was rushed</br>  <br>They're more memorable because he was a twat back then (if you're talking abour Youth is a Lie and Bear speeches)<br><br>As he grows as a character, we dont get those monologues anymore to reflect his growth</br></br></br>  <br>He gets a whole lot less full of himself in S2, and ditches his "being a loner is better anyway" bullshit. <br><br>I suppose the monologues were in tandem with that.</br></br></br>  <br>the batman memes were real in S1. S2 was just melodramatic as hell with no relief.

Meaning he's probably not really.</br>  <br>You are the type that values hard workers who can effeciently manage resources and adapt to difficult situations on the fly.<br><br>Except that's not Iroha.

The problem wasn't her skills as president, but her confidence in the role since she was only a freshmen giving orders to people who were older than her.<br><br>This was a pretty obvious fact that was, once again, repeated multiple times by various character (8man, Sensei, Yukino). So I don't know how you managed to miss that.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the difference between the two manga adaptations?</br>  <br>What the hell man, why does Tobe look so good?</br>  <br>Translate?</br>  <br>My big takeaway from this: holy shit manga Tobe is gorgeous. If I were to switch teams I might actually take him over Totsuka.</br>  This series is just an angsty boku wa tomodachi<br><br>Reminds me of the inner problems that characters felt in Eva. Except in EVA they were well done and resolved. they were subtle at first, then clear. This is just roundabout pretentious bullshit. Every character in this story is just like those guys who kept stalling the Christmas planning.<br><br>Is it just a shit adaptation? Are the LN any good?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>   Prologue 2: The nonsensical ramblings of someone’s memorandum. <br> &gt;There’s something I want. <br> &gt;No matter how much I rack my head over it, I could arrive at only one, permissible answer. But mysteriously enough, it’s accompanied by an echo of ambiguity. <br> &gt;That’s why, I actually don’t have a tangible understanding of what it really is. <br> &gt;However, every time the words leave my lips, I break into a smile, overcome with the desire to hold my head from embarrassment. <br> The day Yukino confess to 8man loudly in public is the day my heart gave out </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just realized that there's no LN illustration of Rumi's front. Ponkan8 and Watari, please.</br>  <br>I suppose it's not a matter of missing it, but forgetting it entirely. Nevertheless if she proves to be a capable president then the argument I made previously would no longer be applicable.</br>  <br><br>What's going on between Yui and 8man here?</br></br>  <br>Holy shit Tobe</br>  <br> Every character in this story is just like those guys who kept stalling the Christmas planning <br><br>Oh gee I wonder why put the Christmas planning in the story</br></br></br>    <br>Pretty neat.</br>  <br> Yukino, Yui, and 8man only ones always pictured <br><br>Iroha is totally going to win guys.</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that's the art from every volume right?</br>  <br>Yes, why?</br>  <br><br><br>Okay so I'm not gay for thinking it too.</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 5 and 6 was when Ponkan8 evolved.</br>  <br><br><br>Fucking gays</br></br></br>  <br>yes you are, but this place is full of them</br>  So, I'm a big fan of anime about terrorism. Was into Ghost in the Shell and then Psycho Pass, then I went to Zankyou no Terror. I really love it when a series goes into sociopolitical matters and I really appreciate seeing how police forces work against terrorism.<br><br>I'd like to know if /a/ knows any good anime about terrorism or sociopolitical problems.</br></br>    K-ON! s2  http://lmgtfy.com/?q=anime+about+te<wbr>rrorism<br>If that was too hard for you then you obviously don't even understand the shit you watched.</br></wbr>  <br>Modern terrorism or past attempts/offenses?

I know that 'terrorism' has existed forever, but only now with information so widely available can it have a huge effect on society on the scale that it does today.</br>  <br>Ehh, it wasn't as good as GitS</br>  People like Zankyou no Terror?

I'm starting to believe I'm being lied to.  <br>Nope.<br><br>Nipples are also just stickers they can stick on, that's why they sometimes have them in anime and sometimes don't.</br></br></br>  Of course not, everyone knows vaginae are gross and girls aren't gross.<br><br>It's simple logic. <br><br>All vaginae are gross<br>No girls are gross<br>Therefore, no girls have vaginae</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then where do babies come from?</br>  Nope  <br>The stork, didn't your parents teach you anything?</br>  Where do the tentacles go in if there are no vaginas?  <br>They poop them out, obviously.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It's Santa, you idiots.<br><br>Do you think he just works on Christmas?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>when you get married, you tell the priest how many babies you want. then the priest goes to the stork and the stork brings them to the local hospital.</br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br><br>You're waifu.</br></br>  <br>No, that's saliva</br>  <br>screw you too anon.

They want you to believe, that every girl has a vagina and you should stick your dick in it to feel good.<br>But the truth is jews take some girls, brainwash them, surgically give them vaginas, teach them how to be sluts are unleash them upon goys. They act nice, wear sexy clothes and tease you, but don't be fooled. When you put your dick in vagiana, it rips off your foreskin. Seriously.

It's amazing.  <br><br><br><br>I'm still disappointed we didn't see the fairies switch into each other's costumes. I want to see Earth wearing Air's outfit and have the top sagging against her chest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A &gt; C &gt; B</br>  <br><br> Not her fault.

Her head seems normal.</br>  <br>Why does Sento look like a girl with a crush?</br>  <br><br><br>This might be the most accurate depiction of koalas ever.</br></br></br>  What do you call this kind of comedy again? I really miss this kind of comedy like this, fumoffu, and old delinquent manga. Too many lolsorandumb and pun jokes nowadays.  <br>cute</br>  <br>Becays she is a girl with a crush</br>  <br>Sexually? Be specific please.</br>  Sento Claus is coming to my house....   tonight   <br>Really? Sento likes him that way? News to me.</br>  <br> pointy ears <br><br>I thought those were only muses, or are they for all fairies? Must know moar.</br></br></br>  <br>for you</br>  <br> cowtits  <br> perfect anything  <br>Seek help.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I love you bro.</br></br>  <br>She started liking him in that way after he shared his secret with her about the heights. Then she really started liking him when she stalked him on his day off and heard about his shitty past. Did you miss the episode where Macron slipped her a truth bean?</br>  <br>Remember kids, always SHAFT responsibly</br>  <br>Sento, baby, hurry down the chimney to me</br>  <br>What's wrong with her fingers?</br>  <br>Welp, thread ruined.</br>  <br>Isn't Salama much flatter than Muse?</br>  <br>Fortunately Muse wears an adjustable corsette-bikini</br>    <br>She only needed a day. You've never slept wrong and fucked up your neck before? It can happen, Why this one time, a couple of years ago, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to try and sleep upside down like a bat by going to sleep with my legs up against the wall ended up nearly suffocating due to the position I was un pushing my boobs up against my nose.</br>  I prefer LATIFA SAMA  <br>Is this an accurate portray of two betas trying to flirt?</br>  I just watched it. Season 2 soon I hope, I don't bother with light novels.  Episode 6 and 7 of the mini theater when?  <br>Episode 6 is already out</br>  <br><br>Holy fucking shit dude. Why couldn't you keep your fucking mouth shut.<br><br>God fucking damn it, that honestly looks painful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She shlicks so hard to Kanye every night her fingers have deformed</br>  <br>The fuck is wrong with her right hand (our left)?</br>  <br>Maybe her butt hurts.</br>  After long term inner debate about all of the girls in Amagi Brilliant Park, I've come to the conclusion that Earth would respond the most positively to being dicked.<br><br>One, she's already reading dirty, dirty fujoshi material. We all know that yaoi is only a gateway for these types of girls. This is only a cover for them, giving them the power to lie to themselves as they quickly move on to secretly indulge in their deepest, darkest hetero fantasies and break into new fetishes and levels of kink.<br><br>Why it wouldn't surprise me if this fairy has amassed all kinds of fetish doujinshi, raiding the Amagi Brilliant Park world's own version of Sadpanda, gathering a collection measured in gigabytes and furiously rubbing herself every night with her eyes closed, imagining Kanie finding her stash and ravishing her body in the various ways pictured within. For a lewd girl like her this won't cut it for long, and she'll have to experience the real thing for herself.<br><br>It will start innocently enough, perhaps asking him to help her in her room. Using the wiles learned from her choice reading material however, she'll soon lure his hands to her firm and supple body. Of course, his hands will only do so much for the curious girl. Before long she'd be completely nude and on her back, Kanie kneeling between her legs, his furiously raging erection gripped hard in his hand as he lines himself up at her soaking entrance. As he pushes into her with one long stroke, she'll involuntarily arch her back and push back against him, taking him as deeply as possible, unsatisfied until every bit of that hard dick is inside her. Her hand will quickly cover her mouth, stopping a deep feminine moan at being taken from emanating and alerting the other girls to their actions.<br><br>Then, the intense mating session will begin in full. There will be no condoms for this lewd fairy, and no rest until every drop contained in his balls is deeply inside her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Silphy so  fucking stupid?   <br>You could say she's  an airhead </br>  <br> not childish </br>  Air is an airhead<br>Earth is dirty<br>Fire is NOT a hothead<br>Water is ???</br></br></br>  <br> Wind <br> Stupid <br> Recognizes the superiority of the katana <br> Knows she'll be be targeted first by any invaders of the park as they fear and respect her killing potential <br><br>Sure, sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Water is  life </br>  <br>I'd like to make some new life right here.</br>  <br>I'm calling the cops.</br>  <br>high test</br>  <br>Water is love.</br>    <br>I wanna roll my tongue all over that</br>  <br>Just because Earth is the kind of girl who would peep on changing shotas and make them rub their cocks together while watching is no reason to call the police.</br>  <br><br>Shame they'll never get together, even in the books.</br></br>  <br>Silphy is so randum xD the character. Absolute shit.</br>  <br>We are still waiting.</br>  <br>The 'translator' admitted to not knowing Japanese and guessing the dialogue in an earlier thread. We're still waiting for real subs.</br>  <br> All that HEALTHY <br> Chooses to fap over the flat chested under age princess instead <br><br>You're disgusting.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nothing will happy. <br><br>Please be excited.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? Why would you waste your own time like that? It's not like he put some memes or jokes in there too.</br>  <br><br> not fapping to both <br>It's like you want to be plebs or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Sylphy has shown proficiency in both Chinese and Hindi in addition to her native Japanese. I don't think she's stupid per se, she's just... not on speaking terms with reality.</br>  <br> [...] Earth is the kind of girl who would peep on changing shotas and make them rub their cocks together while watching. <br>That is my fetish.</br></br>  <br>She's also the most talented out of all the fairies</br>  Is it canon that (size-wise) Sento &gt; air &gt; water &gt; fire &gt; earth &gt; princess ?  <br>When did she speak Chinese or Hindi?</br>  <br>not sure about earth and fire in that order but yeah everything else seems in order</br>  <br>Don't make me upset m8. I'm already in depression!</br>  <br>http://amaburi.wikia.com/wiki/Sylph<wbr>y<br><br>In the episode where the pirate-seals invade, there's a part where she speaks Chinese while using her hand puppets, much to the confusion of the children she's supposed to entertain. She was also the only fairy with no real weakness in episode 9.<br><br>The above makes me think she's smarter than she lets on.<br><br><br>Sounds about right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br> Salama is the only one that has sparkles around her when she's wearing Water's outfit <br><br>Just friends right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>gal pals</br>  <br> big but not absurdly large tits <br> wide hips <br> big thighs <br> slightly toned stomach <br>This is too much. Too fucking much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is she that gay for Muse in the novels too?</br>  <br> The above makes me think she's smarter than she lets on. <br><br>She's also the most powerful of the 4 fairies and can take all 3 of them in a fight where they ganged up on her.</br></br></br>  <br>U FOOKIN' WOT M8?</br>  <br> can take all 3 of them in a fight <br>I'm sure that's easier than it sounds.</br></br>  The only reason I watch this show is because of the visuals. The story is really wtf. I don't know if I'd be able to read the story and not be bored.<br><br>Did anyone here read the LN? Is it better than what I imagine?</br></br>  <br>How did anyone except Sylphy even get their roles?</br>  <br>Park is desperate, Musu may be the leader of the group but Slyphy is the most popular one at the park, she's even got a podcast.</br>  <br>inheritance</br>  <br>Pillow fairies.</br>  <br>Slyphy is a literal meme character. She uses it to her advantage in episode 12</br>  <br> The story is really wtf <br>get out</br></br>  <br>Did they know each other before getting the job?</br>  It may not have been as pretty, but this one episode was more entertaining to me than the entire season of (Fake)Yuri Band Geeks  <br>No, they come from different magical lands</br>  Speaking of the LN, the translation for Volume 2 Chapter 1 is complete<br>https://amaburithetranslation.wordp<wbr>ress.com/</wbr></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br>Do we get any pans of AV chan?</br></br>   mfw listening to the full Amaburi OP over and over and over <br><br>How are the rest of you dealing with the fact that it will never be Magic Hour again?</br></br>  <br>My boss just saw this. Now I'm fired, thanks a lot.</br>  <br>Sweet mother of christ that body is criminal</br>  <br>You deserved it for not being doing your job.</br>  <br>Are they married?</br>  <br>Extra Magic Hour is great, but I think +ユニバース is actually even better.</br>  <br>no she is just one of kanye's mistresses</br>  <br>It's always Magic Hour where I live, stop whining and start believing in magic instead</br>  How do you guys fap to this?  <br>Sento's character song is pretty good. I was disappointed with the duet one with Kanie.</br>   you'll never like Sento's navel <br> there will never be another season of magic hour <br><br>No point anymore</br></br></br>  <br>Amaburi is not for fap though</br>  <br>That's a pretty bold implication</br>  <br>Why does Chuujou deserve a song? Is it just because her seiyuu can sing well?</br>  <br>So they become sexual offenders and get arrested?<br> daily prison life of high school boys </br></br>  <br>That's a fan-edit. With that approach more or less everything is for fap.<br>I'm not saying that AmaBuri isn't full of sexual fanservice, but that's a bad example.</br></br>  <br> amaburi by Xebec </br>  <br>Please, I just fapped.</br>  <br>Then what's the point?</br>  <br>It's  fun </br>  <br> comfy fun </br>  <br>Because in the novels she has a talent for singing. I suppose they ran out of time to show case group ABC some more but they wanted to have her sign anyway. <br><br><br>Eago and Tanoshii, LIke No game no life, Problem Children and D-Frag!</br></br></br></br>  <br>does sento have a fucking dick here</br>  <br>What is Eago?

Anyways if you have even a basic understanding of japanese, it's clear the TL has no idea what the characters are actually saying. It's simply not questionable word choice or editing that's the issue, but plain out getting lines completely wrong. Take the text message Muse sent Sento for example, you could easily guess the contents but what he wrote doesn't make any sense considering the text is clearly written there with no room mistake.</br>  <br><br>now you're just making shit up</br></br>  <br>it's her rifle</br>  <br/>  <br>Enjoy your ignorance. If you like subs where someone made up the dialgoue (i.e. guessed it from context) rather than actually translating it that's your prerogative.</br>  <br>dude the guy couldn't even translate kindergarten or 'kill them' correctly...</br>  <br>So is this slut a savant, or is she obfuscating stupidity?</br>  <br>if she was faking why would she pretend to be a slut</br>  When does the OVA take place chronologically?  <br> not paying attention to the shot of the calendar </br>  <br> 10th of August <br>So it's a true sequel then.

It had a crap load of random characters from other shows shopped into various parts of the OP.  <br>the rest are too much trouble for me to edit into sfw stuffs. just go check out his pixiv www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=3983012<wbr> and twitrpix twitrpix.com/user/bubuduke1919 yourself. he's kinda a flavor of the month sort of fanartist. and he's moved onto hibiki girls now. dunno what he'll be obsess over next season yet. <br><br>he's the artist who drew a buncha one shot bargain bin monster musume eroges, btw.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>At least he's aware of it</br>    <br><br>deepest lore</br></br>  <br><br> a cross between roller coaster tycoon and a visual novel <br>I'll take five.</br></br></br>  <br>Fan-service done right</br>  Kyo-Ani did everyone right with this OVA  If an AmaBri S2 ever gets greenlit the author better write a character for Lil B    <br>i wanna lick salama's poop hole, must taste like chili pepper.</br>  <br>Only if we get some Street Fighter in there.</br>  <br>actually it tastes like hot tamales</br>    So once mori subs the final special it's all done then?  <br>Yup.

It's really stupid and most characters annoy me but I enjoyed it anyway.  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  <br>OP here, I watched it differently than normal. I'd watch a few episodes on my phone while working out. I think that had I bingewatched it like normal I'd be really dissatisfied with it, having spent so much time watching it when there are better series to watch. I liked some of the fights though.</br>  Ichigo has no personality beyond "Imma protect everyone", also Kubo keeps drawing his nakama (Chad and the rest) without letting them do anything significant.  <br>It's like DBZ, but with better art.</br>  Even fucking Naruto has better writing and character development than bleach.
