How can one be surrounded by all these bitches and not even try to bone a single one?</br>    Where the fuck is Railgun 78?  <br>He likes Itsuwa and Othinus.</br>  <br>Purple is my way of life.</br>  <br> implying there is one decent female in this series worth fucking <br>pls anon, the only one worth fucking is Nephyst.<br><br><br>Maybe Othinus but need more interactions to see if Touma truly likes her. She is just the current main girl. Index will come back one day.<br>Itsuwa is in the category of girl who he rescued and meant nothing to him. Touma dont like her</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying there is one decent female in this series worth fuckin <br>Itsuwa.</br></br>  <br> Maybe Othinus but need more interactions to see if Touma truly likes her. <br>Do you really need more than NT10 to confirm that?</br></br>  <br>to be fair both othinus and touma have put up with each others shit for over a billion years at this point.<br>i'd say just off the sheer timetable alone othinus is the one with the best chance.</br></br>  <br> Itsuwa  <br> throwaway trash <br><br><br>NT10 only showed Othinus loves Touma</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is purple always amazing if not best grill</br>  <br>to be fair, touma literally fought the entire damn planet for othinus, i can't think of anyone else he has done that for.</br>  <br> NT10 only showed Othinus loves Touma <br>Did you forget every scene in which Touma actively shows interest in her, emotions for her, even admitting his lust for her to the Russians?</br></br>  <br>There is a huge gap of development between Touma and Othinus and all other raildex characters is why she seems like the most likely choice. Wait till kamachi develops his other female characters. <br><br><br>Just another damsel in distress if another raildex girl was in that position Touma would save her too.<br><br><br>Touma lusts after every girl or blushes around them. Always some interest in each the difference Othinus has impact on Toumas character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Touma lusts after every girl or blushes around them. <br>Not really.</br></br>  <br> kamachi <br> developing characters beyond the waifu of the week and the MC's. </br></br>  On that faithful day Touma had a raging Hydra boner under the bend covers.  <br>How many more years it will take so I can see Itsuwa again......</br>  <br> kanzaki <br> Itsuwa  <br> Misaki <br> Misaka 10032 <br> Orsola  <br> Oriana <br><br><br> Othinus <br> NT12 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Touma merely got a boner for Kanzaki and Oriana. Other minor incidents include Index, Orsola and the Sisters. That's it. He has never been with anyone else like he was around Othinus. Cranking up sex jokes, smiling like he has never in his whole life, admiring her beauty, teasing her to get a reaction out of her and enjoy the physical contact, swine mode, lust declaration, hugs, etc.<br><br>The others just can't compare</br></br></br>  <br>Only because NT is all about Othinus and what happened to Index in OT after volume 13, become irrelevant. Same will happen for Othinus.</br>  <br> vol 13 <br>You mean vol 1.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't really matter if Othinus becomes irrelevant. She already set the bar too high for anyone else to surpass her.</br>  When will othinus die a horrible death like the whore she is?  <br>When your mom dies like the horrible whore she is for giving you birth.</br>  <br>Tons of schools will require you to attend a minimum amount of classes regardless of your grades</br>  <br>Touma wouldn't be poor if she was a whore.</br>  <br>Come round the corner and say that again.</br>  <br>After volume 13 she was only a plot device<br><br><br>Indexfags probably thought the same</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit character from a shit series with a really fucking shitty ending.</br>  <br>What do Indexfags have to do here? It isn't even remotely the same case.</br>  <br> Index <br> huge impact on Touma's character <br> loved Touma <br> stayed relevant unitl memory lost was settled <br> plot device <br><br> Othinus <br> huge impact on Touma's character <br> loves Touma <br> will stay relevant as long as NT9 affects him <br> plot device </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The difference is that you can't even begin to compare volume 1 to NT9 and NT10. I doubt Kamachi will make her another Index.</br>  <br> As long as NT9 affects him <br>Because I'm sure Touma will just get over his ptsd any day now</br></br>  <br>dosent give a fuck about his memory lost anymore so why not.<br><br><br>Just because the scale of the battle was different dosent mean the end results were.</br></br></br></br>  <br>top kek</br>  <br>Still a better character than Touma will ever be.</br>  <br>Trying to seriously compare losing your memory to being stuck in a hell for milennia is beyond hilarious</br>  <br>The end results were different though. Volume 1 served to establish the new Touma as character, while the Othinus arc takes him to another whole level. It's something that will never be topped in the series again by Touma himself or other characters.</br>  <br>You know whats hilarious the raildex community thinks Touma is just some victim in NT9. He infilicted just as much damage on Othinus as she did to him. After omega world is when Touma truly started to fight and come out the victor. Mind fucked her and made her become dependent on him. Though works the other way around too.<br><br><br> After OT 1 new Touma fighting against memory lost <br> After NT10 new Touma fighting against NT9  <br>How is that different? All I see is the scale of the is different nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who's the character that will help against magic gods?  <br>Fiamma.</br>  <br>He's the victim because it was basically self defense at that point. I think once someone has literally killed you you're allowed to fight back. Yes they both affected each other quite a bit, hell I think Othinus even mentions in NT12 that he's rubbed off on her when she was talking him down after the Hamazura fight.</br>  <br>Othinus seems the obvious choice<br><br>But I'd like this as well</br></br></br>  <br>Mainly the scale, but that's enough to make it different. The memory loss thing was something he brought himself, while NT9 traumatized him badly.</br>  <br>Side point, I can't remember any real points where Touma displayed much worry over having lost his memories besides trying to work out if he knew certain people or his time with his parents. I feel like a lot of his drama with the memory loss was "Can't let Index find out!" more than "shit this is affecting me pretty bad".<br><br>The events of NT9 on the other hand we have been shown first hand affected him a lot, both in the novel and then later on recalling it, that's something I don't recall happening much with the memory loss. Feel free to correct me if I recalled wrong however</br></br></br>  <br>Please let it be Birdway. I want to see her and Othinus team up.</br>  <br>The shitposting will be monumental if Othinus appears.<br><br>We'll know this in just some hours. I can't wait.</br></br></br>  <br>Like I said before only scale is diferrent not end result.<br>see this <br> The memory loss thing was something he brought himself, <br>It might not be fair but just having IB caused the clash between thus brought it on himself though i feel as if im grasping for staws here.<br><br><br>Since when does logic applies to raildex.<br><br> I think Othinus even mentions in NT12 that he's rubbed off on her when she was talking him down after the Hamazura fight <br><br>This is true, it was worring about others which is very much not like her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Othinusfags are even more delusional than Misakifags. And I bet they'll be shipping him with next new girl to come.</br></br></br>  <br>Stiyl and his three witches. The magic gods will be BTFO magnificently, and Stiyl will proceed to pleasure himself with notMarisa whilst trampling their ashes underfoot.</br>  <br>Please tell me how I am delusional.</br>  <br>i can literally feel the shitposting in my bones if that actually happens</br>  <br>I mean, on the one hand yes Othinusfags are delusional at times, but on the other none of the posts you've linked are particularly delusional. If it's just claiming that Touma likes her which makes them delusional, then you didn't really read NT10</br>  <br> sityl somehow through some weirdfuck miracle manages to beat a pack of assmad magic gods <br> it gets to his head and he pisses touma off <br> touma punches his shit in again <br>this is the only way this could unfold.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The shitposting would be even worse if it somehow turned out to be Mikoto being useful in her own volume</br>  <br> mikoto goes full lv 6 because magic bullshit <br>oh god /a/ would straight up burn down.</br></br>   Still no updates <br>O-Okay. I guess I'll wait.</br>  <br> muh smell <br> Touma's smile protected! <br>They have pretty weak bases but that's how shipping goes.<br> next new girl <br>Whoever it is, I'll bet my ballsack that she "saves" Touma from a rampaging Mikoto again. That's Kamachi's favorite trick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger the volume isn't out yet.</br>  <br>It's really hard to predict. For example, in NT6 her scene was agreed upon to be one of the best parts of the novel and there was little shitposting. Maybe Mikotofags fanwanking her a bit, but nothing major.<br><br>It just depends on how well Kamachi writes her and the amount of screentime shared with Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>nah we may have hit the cycle of mikoto attempting to do something and failing horribly again this volume.</br>  <br><br>How about if Aogami somehow had a hand in helping them?</br></br>  <br>Literally no one has mentioned the smell thing. If you actually bothered to read the thread, or better yet, NT10, the basis is much bigger than that.</br>  <br>NT6 came out during Railgun S, at the height of her popularity and some time after pig fucker anon fucked off.</br>  <br> shitty <br>Your opinion I don't agree with. Mikoto is cute and just fun.<br> tsundere <br>This is wrong. She isn't really tsun anymore. People who association short-temper triggers for tsun when there is no denial of feelings anymore needs to get slapped.</br></br></br></br>  I'm here to complain about that kamachi never delivers interactions between characters i would like to see interacting.<br>Only instances so far where Mugino with Accelerator and Accelerator with Mikoto. And GUTS in manga.<br>Where is my Touma and Mugino interaction? Where is my Accelerator and GUTS encounter?</br></br>  <br>all that would do is confirm him lv 5 and everyone would think it goes as expected.<br>i think personally it would be hilarious as hell if he still acts as he does the entire time too.</br></br>  <br>Muh smell is about Touma being a scentfag, since it's mentioned so often in all the novels more than just being attributed to Othinus. It only really came up when that one gag in NT12 was translated</br>  <br>I don't know if you'd call that shitposting as much as rejoicing</br>  <br> Implying I didn't read NT10 <br>I read NT12. Raising some flgs is in no way an indication that Touma loves her, plenty of girls raised flags, it's a harem. Shipperfags exaggerate things and think everything is like in their head canon, next time a new girl will appear, it'll be the same. This is annoying.</br></br>  <br>Touma doesn't need to interact with Mugino, she's just generic edgy towards non Hamazuras.</br>  <br>Even outside of that, if you compare the NT6 reactions to, let's say NT3, the actual praise from novelfags for her only applies to NT6.</br>  <br>That's because he didn't interact with her anon. Kamachi knows very well that if they do interact Touma will steal Hamazura's harem, this guy is actually one of the few who has a GF so it'd be better for him.</br>  <br>Where is my Stiyl and Index reconciliation?</br>  <br> Raising some flgs is in no way an indication that Touma loves her, <br>Who said Touma loves her? Stop putting words in people's mouth to your convenience. Also, no one has said false things in here.</br></br>  <br>The posts he quoted said that, this is where the whole delusional point came up</br>  <br>Like != Love</br>  <br>That's a cop out and you know it, if we're talking non romantic Touma likes just about every person he's met, that's obviously not the point being contested</br>  Where the fuck is Railgun 78?  <br>No raws, you'll have to wait until Accel's raw provider scans it.</br>  <br>You're delusional if you think Touma likes everyone with the same intensity or emotion. Othinus and Index are far ahead of everyone else in this regard.</br>  <br>No early scans? Index is popular enough to have diehard fans who would try to get their hands on it from behind the scene and shit, surely.</br>  <br>The only thing we ever get early is illustrations thanks to the nips.</br>  <br>Yes anon, and if you "like like" someone, this is often referred to as love</br>  <br>How can there be scans if the book isn't out for sale yet?<br><br>The only thing we have got is early spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br> kek <br>Delusional Othinusfags are delusional.</br></br>  <br>No, the Prologue and the small part of Chapter 1 that's translated is from a preview on Dengeki's site. You won't see any more translations for at least another week.</br>  <br>Ded</br>  <br>Too bad that's just your interpretation. Nowhere I implied Touma likes Othinus romantically.<br><br><br>Nice shitpost.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And you prove my point.</br>  so guys I finally finished all of the current NT. Im all caught up with the railgun manga n' shit. Someone told me there was a railgun LN that covered different things and some stuff not shown in the main LN or the manga, but it sounded like I was getting my chain pulled. Is there more to cover guys?  <br>What point?</br>  <br> Othinus isn't more important to Touma than 90% of the cast </br>  <br> Love is always romantic <br>This is where the imouto fixation came from isn't it</br></br>  <br>Railgun SS covers Liberal Arts City arc.</br>  <br>Railgun LNs that were released for the limited edition Toaru Majutsu no Index Blu-rays, so there's two of them.</br>  So going by the prologue and chapter translated<br>Anyone saw all the events on nt10 in live TV and also seen all the beating and hugging and shit? No wonder misaka has to rack her brains</br>  <br>There's two Railgun SS stories Liberal Arts City wasn't bad but personally I didn't really like any part of SS2, I'm still trying to finish it 10 pages at a time</br>  <br>I bet the world thought Katze was promoting some telenovela.</br>  <br>Toaru Kagaku no Railgun SS and Toaru Kagaku no Railgun SS2. Both are alright.<br><br> Mikoto x Lessar <br>I'm still waiting, Kamachi. Still waiting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>President Rider was giving his speech to their fight yes</br>  Can I just add my two cents? I think we can all agree that Touman isn't the type to commit to a relationship. Not yet anyway. Even if he liked her (and like  said he likes just about everyone, though it's also true some are more important than others), a one-time date would be the best they can hope for. So I reckon these waifu wars and "X is the best" arguments is about as useful as a candy wrapper.  <br>She's so kind.</br>  <br>Fuck you candy wrappers are really fucking useful unlike these shipping wars.</br>  <br>Railgun SS2 was terrible.</br>  <br>Touma's most likely end is being dead and/or open ended hospital visit so yes the arguments are moot but I'm pretty sure everyone and their grandmother knows waifu wars have never once served an actual purpose.</br>  <br>Guess what<br><br> Yes anon, imply things I didn't post <br>I am baffled at how you can tell all of this as if you could see a like-o-meter on Touma or something</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was okay for me. Just okay. I love Lessar and the antics following her and Mikoto. That's probably the highlight for me.</br>  <br>Not all the events and beatings, just the last fight and hug with Othinus.<br><br> Vatican publicly accuses AC of summoning angels <br> British Halloween <br> Fiamma's golden hands and telesma statues <br> magic crossbow on global television <br>How the heck is magic still a secret?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not really hard to gauge the importance of each character to Touma unless you're retarded.<br><br>Just judge his reactions to when Index and Othinus are in danger to everyone else. Even the damn narrative is explicit about this. Let's take a look at some events concerning Index.<br><br>Volume 17:<br> “…You piece of shit. I’m going to keep beating you until you pass out.” <br><br> Kamijou’s violent words were not like his usual self. <br><br> ... <br><br> “No complaints, right?” <br><br> The sound of repeated blows could be heard. <br><br> On this occasion, Kamijou Touma did not feel that one punch was enough.  <br><br>Volume 22:<br><br> He had not wanted to hurt Index. He had wanted to be the Kamijou Touma that she had trusted. But hadn’t that truly just been Kamijou himself not wanting to see Index’s shocked face? Hadn’t he just been afraid that she would leave him? <br><br>NT9, the most blatant of all:<br><br> Kamijou Touma heard a certain girl’s voice. <br><br> A small figure ran toward him. <br><br> She was a nun in a white habit that had golden embroidery as if on a teacup. <br><br> He knew this girl by the name of Index. <br><br> “Stiyl, Kaori! It’s wrong to only let me choose three things in this food paradise!! I’m already starving!!” <br><br> Kamijou raised his head of his own free will. <br><br> He wanted to burn the scene before him into his mind. <br><br> As the silver-haired girl ran out of the crowd, she held a calico cat in her arms. She had already spotted who she was looking for, so there was no hesitation in her actions. <br><br> And… <br><br> Without slowing for an instant, she ran right by Kamijou. <br><br> She had not been looking at him. <br><br> He heard voices behind him. <br><br> But the boy did not look back. <br><br> He had made up his mind now. <br><br> He felt as if he had seen what he truly needed to protect. <br><br>It would take me three posts more to post the major Othinus scenes. How can you even compare other characters to this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People know magic exist, they just think it's another dumb esper program like AC that people refer as magic.</br>  <br>Not him but the Volume 17 and NT9 scenes could easily have taken place with another regularly appearing girl (Mikoto, Bridway, etc). Of course it was Index because she was the beginning of it all and the one who always welcomes him home. I don't think it would be stretching it to say the NT9 alternate world vision was a turning point for Touman in general.</br>  <br>Forgive me if thinking spending entire lifetimes longer with Othinus than anyone else, their stated mutual understanding of each other's core being, the huge amount of back and forth they had in NT10 that few other characters have replicated (not the quantity mind you but the easy atmosphere they have with each other), his intense fixation on giving her a possibility of a happy end and the dependence he later shows with her made me assume that whether or not it was romantic she was more important to him than most. I apparently jumped to conclusions, you're right, Fukiyose and Itsuwa are just as important</br>  <br>This is called moving the goalposts. Please stop, for your own sake.</br>  <br>Touma sees people in danger all the time and he rushes in to protect them and fight, but Index in danger undeniable triggers a vicious and more violent Touma. It's the same with Othinus. Saying he would have acted and reacted the same way with any other girl is like saying any other girl could have been Othinus if they were magic gods.</br>  ITT: Shipping fags  <br> The NT9 scene could have been Mikoto <br>Didn't he only just before that see Mikoto acting happy in that perfect world? At the *very* least Index couldn't have been replaced with her because you straight up saw how that went</br></br>  Ain't read this shit yet but is accel back or nah?  <br>He dies and Last Order kills herself.</br>  <br>He died and LO committed suicide soon after.</br>  <br>Depends on what you mean by haven't read. The whole series? Obviously yes he's in it. The recent volume with a single chapter out? No not yet</br>  <br>No, that's called me being flexible. After all, the other poster strawmanned romantic love. If you stretch things a bit, it's true that Touma likes everyone, though it's more accurate to say he just gets along with everyone. Actively enjoying the company of another girl is more akin to liking her as a person.</br>  <br>It's not really shipping at this point. Touma and Othinus sharing a strong bond built on understanding and emotional dependence is something the author goes out of his way to state in his afterwords and reinforce with narration in the next novels.</br>  <br><br> The soon to be strongest in the series dying  <br><br>Keep wishing faggots.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Accel <br> strongest <br>Even with white wings he still wouldn't be able to beat Aiwass.</br></br></br>  <br> The soon to be strongest <br>Yeah sure. Just like Mikoto will become Nuit, Touma remembers Misaki again and marries Index happily ever after, Frenda returns from the dead, and Himegami becomes relevant again.</br></br>  Reminder that accel used to be blind before becoming a cripple, and Saten is and always will be blind, probably.  <br>It's more likely than you think, Accel will probably die stopping whatever keikaku Aleister has trying to protect LO, Touma, The World, etc</br>  <br>You knwo very well that Touma would never abandon a person in danger, never. And it doesn't mean that he likes her more than most, Touma is an easy going person, if you are chill he will be chill too, he can speak more casually with Itsuwa than with many girls too, does it mean he likes her more? No, unlike Index/Mikoto they don't bite/try to fry him everytime when they are pissed. Just as Misaki said in the shitty NT11, he just becomes the hero of every characters he encounters, you can't stop this and she knows it very well, it was Othinus turn, next it will be XXX turn. You are a delusional shipperfag, I bet you shipped him hard with another girl before that volume.</br>  <br> Even with white wings he still wouldn't be able to beat Aiwass <br>You don't know that.</br></br>  <br>Yes I do.</br>  <br>Sure you do.</br>  <br> unlike Mikoto/Index they don't bite/fry him when they are pissed <br>But Othinus does lock him in choke holds and the like when he makes comments on her state of dress or the like, he just does it anyways unlike with Mikoto.<br><br>Sure I'll give you that he saves everyone he meets but that only really applies to like one of the things I said. And no I didn't ship him with anyone before hand, I had guesses for who he might end up with (I'm still pretty sure it will be Mikoto or Index if he doesn't die) but I didn't particularly care for any of them as romantic interests</br></br></br></br>  <br>The narrative even stated that Touma would never abandon Othinus while she was given punishment in jail, after she was free of danger. That he would visit her every day and wait for her until she goes out so they can smile together again. That he would be committed to her.<br><br>And yes, that means she is more important for him than most. I don't know why you are in denial about this though. I thought one of the reasons people hated Othinus was because she blew their favorite girls away in terms of development and flags with Touma in just a single volume.</br></br></br>  <br> Visiting Alcatraz every day of the year <br>Rip Touma's attendance records</br></br>  <br> Touma would never abandon Othinus while she was given punishment in jail, after she was free of danger. That he would visit her every day and wait for her until she goes out so they can smile together again. That he would be committed to her. <br>I loved that part but didn't that have more to do with her being so alone before and him going the extra step to save her from such a monumentally terrible existence<br>I still say he would have done the same for anyone in the same predicament, but that's the thing, Othinus is incomparable because her plight as Magic God was far greater and it needed something more than just On the Spot Saving<br><br> mfw she turns into a fucking fairy </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, Himegami was all alone because of the way she killed half the people she came in contact with, but the moment she enrolled in school Touma figured she'd be fine on her own and he never made tall promises like that for her either, so it's still past the point where he'd go and do it for anyone at all</br>  <br>To be fair, he caught that guy strangling Index to death. He doesn't usually catch people that close. I'd expect him to be more pissed than normal if he had found Accel ripping chunks out of 10032, or Hamazura bashing Misuzu's head in with a pipe.</br>  <br>That part was also his emotional dependence on her starting to show. They're extremely attached to each other. It baffles me how some people believe their relationship is remotely comparable to the rest.</br>  <br>I forget at what point exactly he caught Accelerator, but he was busy beating Misaka Imouto up and he knew full well he'd killed literally thousands of clones already, you'd think that would qualify for a serious reaction on the same level</br>  <br>I don't hate Othinus, I hate shipperfags exaggerating things like you.<br><br> Unlike with Mikoto <br>Mikoto doesn't really ask anything when she tries to fry him, she does so because she's pissed. Touma is a nice guy, Index bites him all the time and he still does his best to help her, it is in no way an indication that he likes anyone more than the others. If they ask for his help he will accept, simple as that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he was still a bit loopy from tanking Biribiri's lightning minutes earlier<br><br>Honestly though I think comparing reactions like this has no merit, anger is anger<br>Also he hadn't known the clones very long at that point</br></br></br></br>  <br> I hate shipperfags exaggerating things like you. <br><br>Where's the exaggeration? Everything said is backed up by the text.<br><br>You're literally grasping at straws and deflecting the arguments made.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He's emotionally dependent on her now. <br>Anon pls.</br></br>  <br>Did you read NT12?</br>  <br> Also he hadn't known the clones very long at that point <br><br>Do you realize that this is the very point of the argument? He will barely have any personal attachment towards people he barely knows. Even Kamachi says this<br><br> Kamijou Touma’s tension lessens the closer his relationship with the person is and that showed its true value here. …I j <br><br>Referring to Index. Of course that tension increases when she's in danger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Where's the exaggeration? Everything said is backed up by the text. <br>It's not, you are trying to impose your headcanon because you are a Othinusfags who liked their interactions, in the end you are just one of these shipperfags who thinks X is better with Touma that Y because reasons. Touma will help anyone in danger and will go to great lengths for this, it will not change, he understood her more so what? It means he likes her more than the others? This is the logical conclusion after all these loops. Touma understands her more and can deal wit her better due to this.</br></br>  <br>Mikoto was just an example, and I didn't say that he wouldn't help her if he was asked for help, but fuck is that a low bar. Who wouldn't Touma help if they asked him? I guess maybe Ollerus though that was more because he didn't know the situation at hand. That wasn't really the point though.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>What headcanon? Are you really incapable of addressing the points you want to debunk? Do you think calling me a delusional shipperfag will prove you right?<br><br> Touma will help anyone in danger and will go to great lengths for this <br>You seem stuck in a loop. Go back to </br></br></br></br>  <br>Saying that Othinus was a sure set to win the Toumabowl and they're going to hook up would be exaggerating, simply pointing out that they've got a deeper connection than Touma does with say Komoe or Himegami isn't exaggerating. Just the opposite, insisting that Touma would put in efforts like visiting them everyday across the globe for any random Joe he saves is what sounds like exaggerating to me.</br>  <br>Surely you know about this scene then.<br><br> He reached a hand toward Othinus and rubbed her small head with his fingertips. <br> “You are being too friendly, human.” <br> “Sorry. But make sure to remind me.” <br> Kamijou spoke without shame. <br> “Remind me that I too have something he can’t defeat and something I can’t back down on.” <br> “Hmph.” <br> Othinus gave a snort but let him do as he pleased. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mikoto, Othinus, and Birdway are my most favorite girls.  Just saying.   is there any way to download the light novels or read them online?  <br>Back to Yahari threads with you.</br>  <br> It would take me three posts more to post the major Othinus scenes.  <br><br>Just do it faggot</br></br></br>  <br> being this new </br>  DURR HURR MUH OTHI-TAN WILL WIN DA TOUMANBOWL<br><br>NO NO SHES SHIT MUH GIRL WILL WIN<br><br>All shipperfags will lose in the end. And I can't wait to drink delicious tears</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought that meme originated in Yahari threads.</br>  <br>It didn't.</br>  <br> tfw your favorite girl is from a magic side spin off <br>I'm never going to see Alfar again except maybe as a throwaway line in the last volume</br></br>  Anyone got the NT 12 pdf ?  <br>I was this close to just sending you to /raildexstuff, how long has that been dead?</br>  <br>Where then?</br>  <br>Couple months, I think.</br>  <br>Deeper connection I agree but in no way does it means that he likes her more than the other girls, deeper connection=/=appreciation. Other characters have not been in a situation where they'd be put into jail because of world class crimes, this is not the same scale.<br><br>And that's emotional dependence? It shows that Touma has weaknesses, nothing more, Mikoto pretty much did something similar in NT10, Index acted like this at times too.</br></br></br>  <br> she's the surprising ally <br> loses her jeans <br> Touma has to keep his hand on her bare thighs   while Mikoto watches </br></br></br>  <br>Listen, while the truth of blindness must be spread, if you can't see the truth of the crusade, it's probably because you're also blind, anon.</br>    <br>Since when does having a deeper connection not mean you like them more than other people? Sure the sense of scale was bigger that's why he had to fight more people and go through more beatings to save her, but I didn't bring those up because those are things he'd do for anyone. Touma has more or less stopped contacting most people he saves, and if someone like say Orsola said "Yeah I'll be in prison for translating the book of Law, visit me every day for years until I'm out?" You know he would have said he'd visit often but not every fucking day and he probably wouldn't (read: hasn't) offered anything like that to anyone else.</br>  <br>Fund it</br>  <br> in no way does it means that he likes her more than the other girls <br><br>He does. See <br><br>Also what a shitty argument is <br> Other characters have not been in a situation where they'd be put into jail because of world class crimes, this is not the same scale. <br>It's like saying Mikoto or [insert character here] would have been the protagonist of Index had she had Imagine Breaker since the start.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Accel has more death flags than any other character in this series.  <br><br>Kanzaki forcing Touma to "fake date" as "punishment game" when?</br></br>  <br> And that's emotional dependence? It shows that Touma has weaknesses, nothing more <br>Touma has never asked anyone else for support like that though. Othinus is basically what keeps his sanity in check.</br></br>  <br>I'd say the Sisters are more likely to get exterminated.</br>  <br>I mean toums breaking down in the floor crying in nt12 was pretty much confirm that</br>  <br> Since when does having a deeper connection not mean you like them more than other people? <br>Understanding someone better does not mean you like that person better than the others, it's like that IRL.<br> Touma has more or less stopped contacting most people he saves, and if someone like say Orsola said "Yeah I'll be in prison for translating the book of Law, visit me every day for years until I'm out?" You know he would have said he'd visit often but not every fucking day and he probably wouldn't (read: hasn't) offered anything like that to anyone else. <br>Probably you say, that's just another point wich makes that argument irrelevant. It's not at the same scale, all these loops were necessary for Touma to understand Othinus and it was possible thanks to his determination, he would have even failed and gave without the intervention of the Mikoto Network, he lived hell and could understand her pain and sadness more than anyone else. Your "stopped contacting" is irrelevant and exaggerating, he interacts with them just fine and would not need to visit them every day or stuff because their situation is unlike Othinus, different case different manner to solve the problem. In the end, she was not put into jail and he interacts with her just fine, she is not lonely anymore, case closed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd say Touma and/or Othinus are likely to die just the same</br>  <br>This. I can see him dying but I don't see how he has the most death flags.</br>  <br>That's not what the word connection means<br> Touma isn't actually close to Othinus, he just acts that way to save her <br>You do realize this is what you are arguing right? Also brushing aside the connection between them by saying "yeah but it only happened because of x circumstance" is a cop out. Guess what Mikoto wouldn't be as close to Touma as she is if the Sisters event hadn't happened, wow shocker, that's not an argument against it existing.<br> She's not lonely anymore case closed <br>Since when is "case closed" the same as "Now you're going to live in my house and help me not to lose my way" no one else has gotten even close to that kind of a case closed. It's also not really exaggerating to say he doesn't contact the other people he's saved, he has not once mentioned getting in contact with Orsola, the one chick from Baggage City, Google-chan or the like, and when he sees them pop up in places he acts accordingly like he hasn't seen them or heard from them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not even him, but holy shit, you're still in such denial.<br><br> Understanding someone better does not mean you like that person better than the others, it's like that IRL <br>Sure, if understanding was the only basis of the relationship. It's hilarious how you keep ignoring how flirtatious, happy, active, cool and comfortable Touma was around Othinus the whole time. You can say he has also enjoyed his time with other girls too, but that's just the usual and easygoing Touma who gets along with everyone. They can't compare to the old-married-couple atmosphere Othinus had with him.<br><br> It's not at the same scale, all these loops were necessary for Touma to understand Othinus <br>Which makes their relationship unique, incomparable to the rest.<br><br> he would have even failed and gave without the intervention of the Mikoto Network, <br>MISAKA network. And that's irrelevant to the argument.<br><br> Your "stopped contacting" is irrelevant and exaggerating he interacts with them just fine and would not need to visit them every day <br>Because they carry on with their own lives. They have no connection with Touma. They interact with him when they happen to meet him casually or for another circumstance, but he isn't going to go out of his way to contact them unless the plot requires it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, he gets into lots of shit and he's probably going to die but I suppose he doesn't actively set the flags off like Accel and Othinus do. I don't recall any flags for her either, but if Accel survives LO is probably going to die I'd wager</br>  <br>I wish we get more of her, so more fan art will pop up.</br>  <br>I was talking about Accelerator. I imagine he will either die or be saved at the last possible second while losing Last Order. But I don't see how Accelerator has the most death flags.</br>  Spoiler<br><br> Mikoto dies </br></br>  <br>NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOO</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Well, he's reportedly the number one most important part of Aleister's plan besides maybe Touma himself (based on how the level 5's get numbered), he has his whole atonement fixation which he probably won't feel he's completed until (or heck past the point where) he dies, he's a huge thorn in about a million people's sides, he's well liked but edgy so he's a prime target for a "shocker" death, add on to that that he has his dream of being the strongest and is the most powerful of the MCs so that's another target for showing how serious the final boss is, his character development has basically already been completed, he just needs a flashback at an inopportune time to fufill that "about to die" quota most characters have. Just stuff like that adds up to the point where you're reasonably sure he's going to bite it</br>  <br> inb4 this is an actual spoiler and not a shitpost </br>  <br>On that note, could Mikoto restart her own heart or would having it stopped mess up her concentration too much to try?</br>  <br>No.<br> Mikoto finally realizes she has no chance in the Touma bowl. </br></br>  <br> aleister pisses off a horde of magic gods <br> loses an LV 5 for it <br>i could completely see it.<br>god mikotofags would probably try to publically lynch kamachi on the streets if this happens.</br></br></br></br>  It's time.  <br>HOLY SHIT SPOILER TIME!</br>  <br> You do realize this is what you are arguing right? <br>Not at all.He is close to her, it doesn't mean that he likes her more like you are saying. These incidents made them all closer to Touma, but the Sister incident is on a different scale compared to Othinus case, it is insignificant and it required him to understand her, it was necessary, all these loops helped.<br> Since when is "case closed" the same as "Now you're going to live in my house and help me not to lose my way" <br>He didn't let her be with him because he wanted her to "help him lose his way", he did so because he understood her loneliness, which is the reason why he would have went to visit her.</br></br></br></br>  There seems to be a lot of THK here.<br><br><br><br> Mikoto goes Nuit just before she dies. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wish too, bro. She is pretty cute when she is around with Touma</br></br>  <br>Pfffahahaha did Touma really ask Mikoto if she could be a phone charger for him? That's priceless</br>  <br>You're just going to completely ignore that saying "muh circumstances" doesn't change the fact it's there? I guess we're done then</br>  <br>Touma looks like a psycho on the left image.</br>  <br> be basically the queen of electromagnetic bullshit <br> reduced to literally charging toumas phone <br>holy shit my sides.</br></br></br>  <br>Beat me to it I hope that's the case</br>  <br>Dropped.</br>  <br>So it begins, the great shitstorm of our time.</br>  <br>Basically I am saying that, Touma needed to understand her to save her, and thus he is closer to her than anyone. But it doesn't mean that he likes her more than the others, this is where I disagree with shipperfags.</br>  <br> But it doesn't mean that he likes her more than the others, this is where I disagree with shipperfags. <br>You just disagree and turn a blind eye to the evidence, but that doesn't make you right.</br></br>  <br> Mikoto as a charger <br><br>Still more useful that a certain fairy sidekick.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, with her mouth no less.</br>  <br> You just disagree and turn a blind eye to the evidence <br>Yeah, sure.

Now the discussion with arguments over . That's why you re posting something like "ignoring blahblabla". Touma being closer to Othinus than the other girls is true, Touma liking her more than the others is shipperfags wishful thinking.</br>  <br>No you. Index is cute</br>  <br>To paraphrase an earlier post<br> liking is always romantic <br>Pretty sure most in this thread have been saying that it being romantic is debatable and aren't focused on that</br></br></br>  <br> No you. Index is cute <br>Fuck you. Index is shit.</br></br>  Now I want to see Mikoto tied up and used as a public phone charger, just taking cables in her mouth from every old man, teenage girl, and child on the street.  Except Kuroko, because her fancy bendy phone only recharges wirelessly.   What a shitty thread.  <br> I am not focused on romance <br>I am not talking about romantic love either, he doesn't love her that much is certain, Touma loves romantically no one in this series, it's ridiculous to thinks he does. He being closer to her than the others doesn't mean that he likes her more, that's all I am saying.</br></br>  <br>You still haven't proved how Touma likes Othinus and the others the same. No, you just ignored the posts precisely pointing the reasons Touma likes Othinus in special.</br>  <br> He being closer to her than the others doesn't mean that he likes her more, that's all I am saying. <br>People never used their closeness as basis for claiming he likes her more to begin with. It's their dialogue, banter, flirting and so on.</br></br>  <br>So Fiamma saves the day?</br>  <br> This is certain <br>Another old post, I think by you<br> I am baffled at how you can tell all of this as if you could see a like-o-meter on Touma or something <br>You don't know this, I'm not arguing that it is true, or even that it's likely but it's certainly at least possible</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nuit or bro route. Make it happen, Kamachi.</br>  <br>GeT_HypE</br>  <br>I am not saying that Touma likes everyone equally either. Nothing you can say show that he likes her more than the other girls, he's closer to her.<br><br>Where were you earlier? Liking their interactions more than the others mean that you like the pairing, and that you want to ship them if you are a shipperfags, it doesn't mean that he likes her more, that's exactly the problem of Othinusfags. In the end, it's just another group of shipperfags, Indexfags have their reason, Mikotofags have their reasons, Itsuwafags have their reason, Misakifags have their reason and they tend to exaggerate things as Othinusfags do. But in the end, nothing really changes between them.</br></br></br>  <br> 白井 <br><br>Kuroko being relevant for once?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she's the surprise help. When was the last time she helped "the troglodyte" after OT8?</br>  <br>Kuroko was darkness all along.</br>  <br> Nothing you can say show that he likes her more than the other girls <br>Read  or the first sentence in </br></br>  <br>That IS new content, you dingus. The fact that that image exists means that someone already has the book and is taking pictures of it. The rest will soon follow.</br>  <br> Liking their interactions more than the others mean that you like the pairing, and that you want to ship them if you are a shipperfags, it doesn't mean that he likes her more, that's exactly the problem of Othinusfags <br><br>It's not helping your case when even shippers of other girls have repeatedly admitted that Othinus has the best chemistry/interactions with Touma. Some even hated her for that reason. You're just in denial about it.</br></br></br>  <br>She's not, it's Fiamma.</br>  <br>Possible tat he likes her more? Yes. But saying that he likes her more as if it was a fact it exaggerating, this is shipperfag wishful thinking.<br><br>I answered to the second one and said everything I think about it, we will repeat the same thing again and again if we continue, let's agree to disagree now.</br></br></br>  <br> Nefute~yusu is going to be a sponger of Kamijo house <br><br>Oh dear.</br></br></br>  <br> · Bishop is the place to come and rush to Earth aboard the meteorite, brainstem is defeated <br> • As a scene of everyday, it is turn of the beach surface and Furemea, worst and black night <br>These names always crack me up.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't fucking care about the other shipperfags and they still exist, the series is not over and development still happens, NT10 was a Othinus chapter, NT11 was a Misaki chapter, now there's a Mikoto chapter, who will be more relevant and interact with Touma in NT14, NT15? We don't know. Best interactions=/=love interest or whatever.</br>  <br>More than being forced as a fact, it's how people perceive their relationship. You can't have the type of interaction Othinus and Touma have without some solid level of mutual enjoyment and liking.</br>  <br>画像のアップは、これ以上はやめておく<br><br>・上里の挿絵はある　平凡な高校生と本人がいってる　学園都市の高校生かは<wbr>わからない<br>・神浄の討魔という言葉を僧正が再三使っていた<br>・スターの娘が死んだのは、僧正が原因らしい　僧正が最後の死ぬ瞬間に謝っ<wbr>ている<br>・白カチュのことに触れる場面があったけど、何かの伏線だと思わせるただの<wbr>ネタっぽい<br>・僧正は御坂の力によりマスドライバーで宇宙に飛ばされたんだけど、<br>アローヘッド彗星に乗って地球に帰ってくるところをロケットブースターをつ<wbr>けた脳幹に殺された</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>It's legit. from the Index BBS spoiler thread:<br>http://jbbs.shitaraba.net/bbs/read.<wbr>cgi/movie/6947/1425896122/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  <br>Of course they like each other and Othinus even loves him.

I am saying that all the shipperfags are acting the same, with exaggeration and stuff, some of them saying that "Othinus interactions with Touma are the best" is irrelevant to me. <br><br>Touma likes, Index, he likes Itsuwa, he likes Othinus. But it doesn't mean he likes her more because you want your ship to be true, if you read well you will see that I quoted this as well. Shipperfags ship a pairing depending on what happens in canon and they usually tend to exaggerate things, mainly Misakifags and Othinusfags lately, soon Mikotofags will prolly act like this as well.</br></br></br>  <br>I never said it was not fake. I asked if it was being passed off as an actual spoiler and not just one anon shitposting</br>  Touma is going to feel like shit when he gets his memory back and remembers all the people he has been ignoring so far.  <br>Misaka is hardly bitchy to Touma and is always cute. Her past abrasive was only just that until she realized her feelings. The person she's truly bitchy to is Misaki and she is cute for doing so since Misaki and MIsaka being bitchy to each other is cute.</br>  <br> he likes Itsuwa <br>Touman don't like criminals.</br></br>  <br>He can't create energy.</br>  <br> I am saying that all the shipperfags are acting the same <br>And I'm saying that they don't act the same when it comes to Othinus. <br> some of them saying that "Othinus interactions with Touma are the best" is irrelevant to me. <br>Is relevant to your argument in which you say only Othinus shipperfags think Touma likes Othinus.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Accel has enough power to tip over buildings for half an hour <br> Doesn't have enough to spare some to hasten the charge process <br><br>He could reform the oxidised/reduced material, couldn't he? Or draw on power externally. If he's got Worst or LO with him, that should make it easier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So, what I got from GoogleTL:<br> all Magic Gods except Nepthys died <br> this is the end of the Magic God arc <br> new character and final boss candidate Kamisato Takeru appears <br><br> helper was Fiamma, he uses the fairy spell on High Priest (?) <br> Noukan defeats High Priest <br> Niang-Niang is killed by Kamisato Takeru <br> Mikoto has lots of scenes with Touma. She is feeling a sense of distance from him. <br> Noukan's actions may have unlocked the true power of Touma's right hand <br> Aleister thanks Noukan but is unaware of Kamisato Takeru's involvement <br> Laura knows of Kamisato Takeru and calls Aleister a human <br> Nepthys becomes another one of Touma's freeloaders <br> Kamisato Takeru may be targeting Othinus next <br><br> Index, Othinus and Accelerator don't show up <br> Himegami doesn't show up <br> there are SoL scenes of Hamazura, Fremea and Kuroyoru <br> there's a short story about a nameless side character <br> Yomikawa, Kuroko and Uiharu make an appearance in the anti-crime demonstration <br> High Priest is the "darkness" in the synopsis <br> he's not sure if what Aleister implanted in the Magic Gods was explained <br> there is an emphasis on Mikoto's suffering (?) <br><br> High Priest is blown to space using a mass driver powered by MISAKAs, but he comes back riding a comet but is killed by Noukan (what?) <br><br>Anything I missed or got wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heavy Object has essentially this kind of shit with Quenser and Heivia, every single volume.<br><br>Right up until JC Staff fucks us.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never have a misaka clone powered rocket to launch magic gods off of. </br>  <br> making a completely new character the final boss <br> I smell bullshit.</br></br>  <br> Aleister thanks Noukan but is unaware of Kamisato Takeru's involvement <br> Doesn't he have cameras all over AC?<br> Also, I don't know if these are the spoilers who made sense but end up being fake like in NT12 or if this are legit spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>He recharged his battery in NT6 from a power cable but I forget if he used his powers or just SCIENCEd up a charger out of scrap metal.</br>  <br>What were those parts about daughters dying?</br>  <br>Mostly about self servicing it, but oh well. It's not happening anyway because &gt;muh drama preserving handicap</br>  <br>GoogleTL here, I didn't see that anywhere. The only thing that comes close is:<br> Niang-Niang's magic was supposed to kill Mikoto but she was saved by IB </br></br>  <br> But it doesn't mean he likes her more because you want your ship to be true <br><br>Again with the argument based on assumptions. Shipping her or wanting her ship come to fruition has nothing to do with the main point of my arguments, nor is it the reason I'm arguing. Oh well, let's just agree to disagree then. Just acknowledge the fact Touma gives Othinus special treatment and likes her very much and that most fans think he likes her more than most. There is no exaggeration in that.</br></br></br>  <br>Fiamma was first mentioned in OT13, I believe. I don't buy the spoilers, but this would be the right time to start setting up for the final arc if it's going to be around 20 volumes long.</br>  Hi anyone need runes?<br><br><br>What this anon said</br></br></br>  <br> it's <br>To clarify, I'm referring to NT rather than the final arc</br></br>    <br> Mikoto has lots of scenes with Touma. She is feeling a sense of distance from him. <br> there is an emphasis on Mikoto's suffering (?) <br><br>Finally time to sink the shitty Kamikoto ship.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But Fiamma wasn't the final boss.<br> I'm fine with this Takeru-whatever being the main antagonist of the next arc but the only one worthy of being final boss is Aleister.<br> If Kamachi decides to introduce some random fuck who outsmarts him and takes his place as final boss, I'll get mad.</br></br></br>  <br>Daughter's = Niang-Niang</br>  <br>Hi.</br>  <br>Almost no scenes of Kamijou fighting<br>lots of acro bike driving<br>Nyan Nyan almost kills Misaka with her magic but the right hand prevents it<br>High Priest makes fun of Misaka but Kamijou objects vehemently<br>no pics of Noukan<br><br><br>kek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Believing fake spoil. </br>  <br> Kamikoto volume <br> Kamisato is introduced <br> What does it mean?</br></br></br>  <br>Fiamma was the final boss of OT, if there's another series coming after NT he could be the final boss of NT.</br>  <br>A new girl named Misato will win the Touma bowl.</br>  <br> Kamachi wouldn't be such a hack to make ANOTHER continuation after NT,  r-right? </br>  <br>That might just be spoilerfag's opinion. If spoielrs are real, I think this Takeru guy will end up being the one to setup the final Laura vs Aleister arc.</br>  One page thread activate!<br><br>Give me your best (translation; no shonenshit)</br></br>                        <br>"Don't post shonenshit"<br> Posts shonenshit <br><br>Huehuehuehue</br></br></br></br>    bumpin        <br>The artsyle reminds me of Bakuon, is it the same artist?</br>    <br> he wanted to be a faggot cross dresser all along </br>    <br>like poetry</br>  <br>It is</br>  <br>I wonder why he got impatient towards the end and didn't let his friend do the drilling for him.

Like, for most of them it's just fucking words like "Little Feet" how is that fucking trademarked? Like I understand unique names Like Metallica and shit but most of the names are just words they shouldn't have to change them to avoid copyright, it's bullshit imo.  <br>The name changes were retarded. The insertion of memes and Commie tier joke subs for everything else just made it one of the worst game localizations I'd see in years. I don't recall it selling much in the US so maybe I won't have to see that trash with EOH.</br>  <br>So you're saying it's not related at all that a DIO from a world where Jonathan Joestar never became his body still has The World, and not Hermit Purple.</br>  <br> I don't recall it selling much in the US so maybe I won't have to see that trash with EOH. <br>This isn't how copyrights work.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's saying hopefully it won't get localized.</br>  <br><br>Did anyone expect a series that JUST gained popularity in the west, not huge, but small to sell?</br></br>  <br>Bandai-Namco did apparently.</br>  <br>The said that?</br>  <br>Why else would they bother localizing it? For charity work?</br>  <br> Lets release a game in the west that's a celebration of all 8 parts while westerners have only seen the first 3 <br>Bamco never made intelligent localisation decisions.</br></br>  Is amazon the best place to buy Jojonium?  <br>So what? Doesn't change the fact that there is a Diego with The World.</br>  <br>So it has no bearing on the argument about DIO or Jonathan having the World. Diego is a separate character from DIO, AU Diego is even further separated.</br>  Doesn't TPP fuck over all band stands?  <br>The Phantom Pain?</br>  <br>He's an alternate version of Dio, and btw it is written in Jojo a gogo that the world is Dio's stand and hermit 2 is the stand of Jonathan, so stop with this bullshit please</br>  <br>The pirate party?<br>Trans Pacific Partnership?</br></br>  <br>Except for the fact that, every universe but the Prime one isn't canon.</br>  <br>No, he's not. He's an alternate version of Diego. Who is not Dio.</br>  <br> every universe but the Prime one isn't canon <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Diego is an alternate version of Diego, and still, the World isn't Dio's stand, you ignored my second sentence to protect your silly headcanon</br>  <br>What does that have to do with The Pink Panther?</br>  <br>Are you even asking? He said that Diego isn't an alternate version of Dio. In fact Diego got a total different back story, attitude, stand and name.</br>  <br>Consistency</br>  <br>I felt like it wasn't even worth addressing. JoJo a GoGo is secondary material which has dubious usage since Araki changes his mind. Plus it still doesn't contradict the idea that The World is Jonathan's stand which might also have all the Joestar stand powers.</br>  After 100 years, there would have been two things in that coffin, the Joestar's greatest enemy, and the remains of their forefather. So, the question remains: What did Dio do with Jonathan's skull?  <br>Things that would make Pucci and Vanilla Ice jealous.</br>  <br> I didn't address it because it's secondary material <br>Nigga you're literally just making all this shit up without any proof at all and you dismiss secondary sources?</br></br>  <br> secondary material <br>What. He was written after part 5, why the fuck should he needed to change his mind 2 parts after sdc? Are you even trying or just shooting random bullshit?</br></br>  <br> The words from the creator himself don't count <br>You have to be baiting</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I haven't gone outside of the manga itself to find anything. Araki contradicts himself and changes his mind frequently, you should know that. How many dropped subplots do you need to get that? For that very reason anything outside of the manga itself doesn't have much use. He makes up whatever he feels like at the time.<br><br>Do you also want to say that Pucci never beat Jotaro, because Araki said in an interview that only Jotaro's kid with that idol would be able to beat him?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Muh headcanon counts more than an official book written by the mangaka </br>  <br>If Araki wishes for something to be true then it's fucking true you dumbass, he is the god of his fucking work he can do whatever he wants.<br><br>Also source on that idol thing because if it's before the end of Stone Ocean then your point is invalid there</br></br></br>  <br>OK, now show us the proof that Araki changes his mind 2 parts after sdc only because one morning he said "ehy, I now decided that the world is Jonathan's stand, I will never put this on the plot, I will even make another version of Dio Brando with the same stand so fans won't know that I made this new decision, I'm such a genius!"</br>  Is the Part 7 translation Vento Aureo-ish or am i just stupid? I just read the first few chapters of D4C (Right now i'm at the part where Gyro finds Johnny after being shot) and i really did not understand most of what was going on (With the multiple Diegos and Wekapipos, and the reason why the later died).<br><br>Does Valentine's ability get explained in better detail later or should i just re-read those chapters?</br></br>  <br>Stands protect their users, why the fuck should The World protect the one who killed his user?</br>  This is a really unimportant question that no-one should give a shit about, but what color should Gyro's teeth be in the possible Part 7 anime adaptation?<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4871484</br></br>  <br>There can't be two same people in the same universe, so they just fuse and die</br>  <br>I don't like the goldish color, I would rather prefer silver</br>  <br>Nah, it's just bizarre</br>  <br>Imagine that it's like matter and anti-matter, but exclusive to people. When a person goes to an alternate world and comes into contact with his alternate self, they both fuse and die. It's exclusive only to each specific person, contact with anything else when visiting an alternate world has no repercussions, only contact with your alternate self. You could potentially live your own life normally in this alternate world, so long as your alternate self is avoided, whether he is dead or alive does not matter.</br>  <br>So Basically. "I'm going to keep adding bait to this meme so I can bust a nut off of all the spergs getting upset by it."<br> I like you.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but I remember in the same interview they showed Wekapipo. It's on youtube somewhere.</br>  <br>That depends what you're talking about. Actual Jojoniums or the Viz English release is isn't called Jojonium but uses the assets? For the viz release you'd be better off buying from Book Depository, cheaper and free shipping. As for the actual Jojoniums, Amazon.jp or CDJapan.</br>  <br>Wait, is he seriously talking about the Shoko interview? Now I know he is fucking baiting, Araki was obviously fucking joking when he said that to her. Araki isn't joking in his artbooks.</br>  I can kind of understand how King Crimson works but how does Gold Experience work? It brings things to life so how does it turn a broach into a ladybug which is actually a tracking device which is actually the stand using turtle?  Just a reminder that blondes are dumb, untrustworthy whores.  Also the cutest and most beautiful.  <br> Just a reminder that bones still cant find a slot for their one hour original ending <br><br>KEKai</br></br></br>  <br> gril </br>   start episode <br> see this <br><br>DROPPED<br>R<br>O<br>P<br>P<br>E<br>D<br><br>Less than a minute in, a new record.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It has some of the shittiest CGI I have ever seen. And the rest of the episode wasn't good enough to justify this.</br>  <br>Whew lad. Glad I didn't waste any space DLing this.</br>  <br>Yeah it's complete shit. Not even going to watch it for Kussun.</br>  <br>What a coincidence, i did the exact same thing at the exact same time, i usually like shorts and have a hard time dropping shows but the moment those CGI dolls show up i gave up, what were they thinking puting this on the 1st minute of the 1st episode.</br>  <br><br>It literally looks like an HD remake of a PS2 game and the animation is stiff in a way that looks like a game from that era too.</br></br>  <br> those arms <br> those soulless CGI faces <br><br>CGI is killing anime</br></br></br></br>  The otaku is the only reason I'll be watching again.  Does anyone have WEBMs of it? It really needs to be seen to be believed.  <br>The problem starts when it's 8 minutes altogether.<br>Of course they don't have budget for decent CGI.</br></br>  <br>I also wanted to watch it for Kussun but it looks so shit I bet I'd cry blood.</br>  <br>I can live with CGI. For example, I enjoyed Aikatsu even with the CGI dances and they even grew on me. I get that some studios have to save budget. <br><br>That said, it was really awful CGI for the first minutes of a new show, where they are supposed to sell it. Like, what the hell were they even thinking.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet she's doing the exact same thing. It's sad really.</br>  The funny thing is that the creepy as fuck CGI OP was the only thing that actually moved during those 4 minutes.<br><br>I don't know what I was thinking when I was expecting that this could be a serious contender to challenge popular idol anime, the quality is worse than WUG was at its worst. Next time I'll do better research.</br></br>  <br>We'll see what Venus Project has to offer.</br>  Even Hime Chen had better 3DCG dances  <br>I can spoil it for you: shit.</br>  <br>I'd like to watch it but I can't find any raws.</br>  <br>It hasn't aired yet, amateur director and overall staff tells me enough.</br>    <br>I thought it did.

This will likely be the standard for the rest of the series, so better get used to it.</br>  <br> Post battle is always my favorite part of an arc.

As much as it's shit on it's extremely easy to setup and watch all the relevant shows, not to mention Hulu has a pretty decent catalog of series.</br>  It's pretty much dead apart from Vivid/FFF/Commie/Underwater.  now there's official sources like Crunchyroll or Funimation where watching stuff there helps the industry  <br>It's funny how they're the least useful now, a season where Funimation decides to pick of 20 shows and of the 8 that should be out they've only managed 4, 1 of those being delayed. Just call them FFFunimation.</br>  <br>That's not entirely true.<br>There's a few groups who still do their own translations and most of the time they end up sounding more natural than the CR ones.</br></br>  I still prefer fansub groups most of the time. I couldn't care less whether they do an original translation or just edit CR/Funi, if their overall quality is better then that's what I'll watch.  Diaz.  <br>lol<br><br>if you want to support the industry buy the blurays/dvds and pirate it when it airs</br></br></br>  <br>This. I have no idea people won't wait a few more hours for a vastly better experience.</br>  <br>It's only the first week though right, I won't have to deal with garbo funi releases for half the season right.  right </br>  Fansubbing has served it's purpose. The goal was to create awareness for shows people would have otherwise never seen. Now they have.  <br> Hulu has a pretty decent catalog of series. </br>  <br>It's looking bad, anon. Commie dropped Dandelion because there's too much to typeset, and most other shows aren't even being looked at because fixing Funi's mess is so much work.</br>  <br>People do webrips of Funimation so I agree.</br>  Every season I prioritise picking up fansub releases to avoid funi shitsubs and CRs awful banding and every season I pretty much only watch CR/funi anyway because groups fall so far behind.

Funi is terrible but I'm sure they will improve eventually so whatever. I really couldn't give a fuck about fansubbers.  i haven't watched fansubs in years, so what happens to the shows that don't get picked up by cr/funi, and about how many shows do they pick up a season?<br><br>are there charts or lists of unsubbed series?</br></br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br>the old groups retire. and kids have no reason to pick up the mantle. it's a dying profession.<br><br>Daiz won.</br></br></br>  <br>I would rather watch Spanish dubs than commie or fff memetitles.</br>  <br>http://fansubdb.com/<br>If it's not being subbed, it'll just show what channel it's airing on</br></br>  <br>I want another one like how Irrational Typesetting Wizardry did Noucome. There's no fucking point in doing a standard translation when CR is out there.</br>  <br> few more hours <br><br>It's often days, if not weeks. If you're okay with only watching this season's shows next season just wait for the BDs.</br></br></br>  How does Kiss do it? No ads, 1080p, day-of releases.  <br>Right now I don't even care about CR if only Funi could die.</br>  <br>ITW returning would be great.</br>  <br>Go and be retarded somewhere else.</br>  <br>By streaming crunchy vids.</br>  What is with Commie doing BD releases and dropping them midway through?  Learn japanese, faggot  gg was the pillar of life keeping fansubbing afloat. When they died it was inevitable everyone else would soon follow.  At this point I'd be happy if CR just licensed everything and funi died.  As long as commie keep going I'm happy those guys actually put something hard ass work into it and it comes out looking better than any streaming service you can pay for. Episodes are chaptered and the OP and ED are translated too. Money can't beat that level of dedication. Fan subbing may die one day but there are still a lot of good guys who keep delivering for us.  <br>not to mention those dank ass memes man I lol everytime</br>  <br>I would watch their releases if only they weren't inserting their fucking retarded ebin mememes.</br>  <br>Commie dev pls go.</br>  <br><br>So I'm assuming you don't watch CR or Funi rips either. Because they're full of memes too.</br></br>  <br> there are still a lot of good guys who keep delivering for us. <br><br>Yeah, too bad that's not Commie.</br></br></br>  Why sub shows that don't have subs when you can sub really popular shows that DO have subs?  <br>As a matter of fact I don't unless there's absolutely no alternative. Then again, I don't remember CR/Funi using memes as obnoxiously as commieshits.</br>  Mate if you want dank ass memes get the seven seas translations of monster musume. Generally commie do a pretty accurate translation. They do have a habit of changing stuff so lesser being can understand but you should understand a reasonable amount of Japanese by now for it not to bother you.  <br>Who gives a shit Anime Is For Jerks anyway.</br>  There is no escape from the memes now anyway. Ever since the day that kid asked me where "hashtag F" was on the piano I have accepted shit is going downhill and won't be stopping. Memes are a small price to pay in exchange for subs that aren't altered google translate.   subs <br>you should know japanese by now you fucking lazy fuck</br>  <br><br>That's why you watch Commie.</br></br>  <br> comparing the amount of memes in Commie to ANYTHING, must less vanilla ass plastered CR/Funi <br><br>Every time, EVERY TIME I watch commie, there will inevitably come a moment when there is a line which is completely, utterly fucking retarded, the actual sensible translation for which in my mind's eye I can picture with perfect clarity.</br></br></br>  <br>I never understood the concept of fansubbing. Why would anybody volunteer to translate something, when there's no pay, social acknowledgement or wathever?</br>  <br> watching Kaiji on Crunchyroll   so I can show it to my parents <br> no curse words in script <br> Kaiji screams "DARN" and "DANGIT" in even the most desperate of situations <br>Kuyashi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not lazy, just stupid.</br>  <br> the actual sensible translation for which in my mind's eye I can picture with perfect clarity <br>If you can tell good and bad translations apart, why are you using subs?</br></br>  <br>Does this mean they can finally shift their focus onto older shows?</br>  amazeballs  <br>Not stupid, just lazy.

However much some of us like to believe in ideals like "community" and "for the fans", most of us are just parasites.<br><br>Only a relatively small handful of people have ever had the combination of skills and diligence to run a successful and long-lasting fansubbing operation -- the kind that churns out series after series instead of breaking up out of apathy and/or drama after a few tardy episodes. <br><br>Copyright claims and lawyers haven't been able to stop them hard working exemplars, but what has finally done the trick is Crunchyroll showing some of those key people that they can sub for money instead of sub for free. As for the rest, it's got to be discouraging to see the "other guy" making money while you are getting a pittance in donations (while getting bitched at by leeches for not be fast or perfect enough).<br><br>Sure, there are now operations that function to rip CR subs and slap them up on a torrent. But once the community goes down that route, it loses that fig-leaf of fansubbing as some kind of noble enterprise -- now you're just a naked pirate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad they all suck</br>  <br>I don't watch shows as they are airing so if somebody fansubs that I usually watch that version, but if they don't, it doesn't really bother me either way.</br>  <br>Most are shit, anyway.</br>  <br>They're all terrible but I look forward to the day you download a BD and it's just CR translations with a different font that doesn't have karaoke or any fancy typesetting with shitty encoding.</br>  <br>hi, Daiz</br>  <br> I've no doubt it'll get better. <br>They haven't improved a lick since they started simulcasting. What makes you think they'll start now?</br></br>  <br>This. <br><br>Fan subs are dying. Best to learn jap</br></br></br>  <br>It's more that all the people that have been subbing for years finally have real jobs to do, and you faggots on /a/ are too lazy to do any real work and just talk about how shit funimation is instead of actually sub.<br><br>How are those weekly jp threads going, anon.</br></br></br>  The dude from senketsu-subs will save us :)  I can't believe I want CR to sub more shows. Fansubbers gave up so now they're the only thing standing between us and absolute shit.  <br> Probably the biggest change to fansubbing is the coming of Crunchyroll and the popularization of simulcasting. The result of these two things is that anime fans can now watch their newest favorite Japanese cartoons almost immediately after they air in the land of the rising sun. That in itself is incredible. What does this mean for fansubbers? It means that there is no longer a reason to speedsub anything that is simulcasted - since the simulcast will almost invariably always come out faster and with a higher degree of translation quality than any speedsubbing group. Maceart and I both think that is really amazing, since it basically means that we’re now at a time where one of the main goals of fansubbing have been effectively achieved - zero turnaround time to watch the newest stuff coming out in Japan. <br><br> What does this mean for fansubbing in the future? Well, fansubbing is effectively close to extinction. The only shows that can even be fansubbed are children’s shows and the few shows that are not simulcasted. This means that the amount of groups will diminish drastically. Fansubbing won’t die, however. That can only happen if Japan suddenly decides to stop the creation of all anime, and that won’t happen anytime soon. <br><br> Many groups nowadays don’t really do any “fansubbing.” What I mean by that is that these groups don’t really translate anything. They take scripts from Crunchyroll/Hulu/ANN/Funimation/Nic<wbr>onico, spruce them up a bit and then release them. In our eyes, these groups are basically rippers like the old DVD ripping groups back in 2005 with OGMS and OGG. On a certain Japanese themed image board, there are certain someones who proclaim such ripping groups are fansubbing groups, but I think that is a stretch and does a great disservice to groups who actually translate.</wbr> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> have to <br>I haven't progressed past episode four.</br></br>  <br> pretending doremi has been relevant for the past decade </br>  <br> Doremi </br>  <br>Don't be a pussy.</br>  <br> now you're just a naked pirate. <br><br>Oh no, anything but that moralfag-kun.</br></br></br>  <br> fansubbing groups <br> relevant to anything <br><br>This is the problem.</br></br></br></br>  <br> However much some of us like to believe in ideals like "community" and "for the fans", most of us are just parasites. <br><br>Welcome to every community, ever.</br></br></br>  <br> but I think that is a stretch and does a great disservice to groups who actually translate. <br><br>Memeing takes a great degree of skill. For example, you need a degree in memetics to even consider joining commie.</br></br></br>  <br>How does my hatred of Funi's sub styling make me a pussy?</br>  <br>A real man is not afraid to put himself through suffering.</br>  <br>ETA to Precure getting licensed so that Doremi can die</br>  <br>I honestly don't see how this is wrong or disappointing. CR's translations for the most part aren't any worse than a fansubbing group, especially when you factor in the speed of release. Fan groups later come behind and cleans/typesets. If you want your shitty karaoke, you get your shitty karaoke. What's the problem?</br>  <br>But why bother if it's arriving on the internet in such a convenient manner so quickly. <br>It's far easier to simply moan at Funi and hope they improve, in fact that's more likely, than it is to set up a new group to translate stuff that most people will simply ignore.</br></br>  Would CR and Funi going down actually give us some better fansubs? Do fansubs even translate anymore don't they just edit CR subs?  <br>I don't know if your a troll or not but I was honestly memeing about the guy who couldn't be bothered to scroll to the bottom of the post to read the important part.<br><br>Doremi is a good group, as is any fansubbing group that isn't 5 inches up their own asshole.</br></br></br>  <br>They're so proud of their translations for a children's show  which apparently aren't even as good as Commie's  that they look down on those who don't translate from scratch.</br>  <br>It makes you part of a  mostly  silent majority. And styling aside, it seems that lot of the Funi teams for certain shows aren't even bothering to \an8 signs recently...</br>  <br>People would do it again, maybe it would take some time but if there is demand they do it, the problem is that now with CR and Funi almost nobody cares about fansubs and it's mostly about epenis or providing something for the fans which would not be possible without them.</br>  <br> \an8 <br>What?</br></br>   still something like 20-30 years of unsubbed classic shows <br> nobody will pick them up because EW ROBOTS, GROSS </br>  <br>yes, because translation reviews aren't the most autistic thing ever. Keep telling me how one group has a higher quality than another and thus the lesser group does not deserve your download.</br>  <br> Do fansubs even translate anymore <br>obviously</br></br>  <br> classic shows <br>All good ones have been translated already. Only pre-90s shit remains.</br></br>  <br> Doremi is a good group <br>Go away Maceart</br></br>  <br>You don't fucking know that.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that the would have more unsubbed shows than we do now.</br>  <br>I'm a pathetic person, but the silly animated subs Commie has been pulling with the past two seasons of Nisekoi has been a highlight for the given season.<br><br> Disclaimer: Am retired fagsubber, so knowing how much work can go into something silly for the viewers like that warms my shriveled heart. </br></br></br>  <br>why don't you sub them then</br>  <br>I know it for a certain. If you want to disprove the well-established facts, feel free to name some ``good'' shows that haven't been translated already.</br>  <br> I enjoy eating shit </br>  <br>I'm not him but if I had to choose between Deadfish and UTW for example, why the fuck would I choose Deadfish? Of course the worse alternative isn't the one to be picked.</br>  <br> I enjoying eating all the shit and deciding which one is the least shit and writing about it on the internet instead of actually watching free anime subtitles </br>  <br> Disclaimer: Am retired fagsubber, so knowing how much work can go into something silly for the viewers like that warms my shriveled heart. <br>You must have been the worst fagsubber to ever exist if you think shit like that takes a lot of time and/or effort.</br></br>  <br>For a worthy cause, perhaps.

Like Netflix, studios initially saw them as a sort of minor fringe-thing, and it was better to get a pittance than nothing. After all, fansubs were widely available for free, while the physical disc market in the U.S. was in free-fall.<br><br>However, as Crunchyroll has gained steam, studios have now woken up to the prospect of facing a monopsony -- a market cornered by a single buyer. They're not nearly there yet, but given their rate of growth it could potentially happen in the future. As the saying goes, "It's not the end of the world, but you can see it from here".<br><br>When the studios woke up to Netflix as a potentially dominant future media buyer, the studios responded by jacking up their prices, withholding key licenses, and forming alternative distributing contributors (like Hulu). <br><br>This temporarily caused Netflix's media costs to spike upwards and cut into profits, but over time Netflix responded by increasing prices, padding out their content with older titles, B-list movies, indy content, and documentaries -- which viewers didn't seem to mind, as their subscription base has stayed pretty healthy. And now original content as well, as their ambitions grow.<br><br>Will CR follow the same path?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you retard, it was a made up scenario to compare a great subbing group to a shit one.<br><br>Okay here is an easier one for you since you seem dumb.

Why would you ever choose bad quality? Of course if bad quality is the only option then it's alright.</br>  <br> a made up scenario to compare a great subbing group to a shit one. <br>UTW isn't a great group at all</br></br>  <br>Just like how complaining about those funi dvds, and then the funi bds, the funi dubs, made them get better.<br><br>Right?</br></br></br>  <br>That's like having a choice between clean water and piss, then drinking the piss because they're both liquids.</br>  <br>Good one, anon.</br>  <br>cause it came out the month the show did, and the other one came with the BD torrent.<br><br>You just want to watch the show. If you just see two groups that both come up at the same time and you're not already sure, obviously you didn't check 4chan first.</br></br></br>  <br>Deadfish isn't a subgroup at all, it's a group that re-encodes the best available subs into mp4 format. In your scenario it wouldn't matter whether you chose UTW or Deadfish, since you'd end up with the same subs anyway.</br>  <br>Just learn spanish.</br>  <br> I haven't been on here for about a year or two. <br>Hence the ``lurk more'', cock goblin. You are not some special snowflake which can't just circumvent the proper channels.</br></br>  I've noticed that most of the fansub groups is composed of people who work full-time jobs or are in STEM programs, engineering, computer science, etc. The founder of UTW was in fucking med school. No wonder releases are delayed or people quit subbing if they are working full-time.<br><br>Why not make fansub groups composed entirely of NEETs?<br><br>NEETs have:<br> infinite free time <br> available at any time of day <br> no work, no school, no social life to distract them <br> no other responsibilities to interfere with subbing <br><br>Somebody get on it please.<br>Somebody make a fansub group that only recruits NEETs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>everything goes to shit over time, so yeah, it'll get more expensive and they'll be somewhat more fractured and more expensive. Also, they'll be more good anime to watch, and less shit.</br>  <br>So an /a/ subgroup?</br>  <br> NEETs <br> productivity </br></br>  <br>Because NEETs are lazy fucks that want to be spoon fed.</br>  <br>They're a shittier version of HS, not the same as UTW at all.</br>  <br> Somebody get on it please. <br> Somebody make a fansub group that only recruits NEETs. <br><br>And nobody does anything. <br><br>Wonder if there's a pattern with NEETs not subbing anything while the engineers, scientists, and doctors are churning out subs. Nah, couldn't be a relationship there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no work ethic = epic fail</br>  <br>Because NEETs would give up after 1 week.</br>  <br> Why not make fansub groups composed entirely of NEETs? <br>Because not every NEET is herkz</br></br>  <br>NEETs are usually lazy assholes, so the releases would be delayed anyway, if they got anything done at all.</br>  it's laziness, the same reason why some people take 3 months to translate one chapter of a manga.  <br>That's false.<br>NEETs are busy as fuck, doing absolutely nothing.<br>No time to actually contribute to the society.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank God there's only one of this faggot.</br>  <br>If they were, fansubbing would be in its prime.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127801836 <br>Just fuck off, you're embarrassing yourself.</br>  <br>No, it means you lazy faggots might start to learn Japanese instead of being perpetually self entitled man children.</br>  <br>http://deadfish-encod.es/news/fate_<wbr>stay_night_unlimited_blade_works_20<wbr>14/2015-04-17-9741<br> Subs from [UTW] <br><br>You're a fucking retard.

These are the people who get pissed off at others for not releasing content for them when all they do it sit behind a computer and click a button to download a torrent. Most of these /a/nons are basically the mirror image of the self entitled whinny cunt on tumblr expecting the world to do everything for them, as though they are owed it. <br><br>An /a/ fansub group would consist no one doing anything and everyone blaming everyone else for nothing happening.</br></br></br>  <br>People fansub to help anime fans, not because they are on a mission to translate the entire canon of Japanese animation. Why put in all the work to translate and sub an ultra-niche show when an incredibly small number of people will even know or care about your work?<br><br>You can say they only care about e-penis, but would you work for hours and hours just for the sake of a couple of anons on /a/ and /m/?</br></br></br>  <br>I stand corrected then. Apparently there's no longer need for people to write their own scripts to convert motion track data to usable subs then.</br>  <br>Yeah lets totally spend our free time spending tons of hours subbing things that the official companies do already and release it day(s) later to a small group because most people already watched it on the official subs!<br><br>Lets not forget we get no respect and just get angry people who yell Where's fucking subs? Shit sucks. I sure love all that.</br></br></br>  <br>All those people you're talking about were NEETs when they started, but being NEET sucks and they decided to do something productive for their future.</br>  <br>Crunchyroll succeeded in killing fansubs.</br>  Why the fuck isn't anyone doing anything about this?<br><br>I can't fucking handle hardsubs for all these shows. Someone please save us</br></br>   Always thought CR and Funi were equally as terrible. <br> Holy fuck all these Funi shows this year <br><br>Jesus Christ how the fuck is Funi so much worse than CR of all things?</br></br></br>  <br> I was a NEET, now I have a full time job though. It's true what you're saying about procrastinating about things they enjoy. <br>What about 100 NEETS? How would that end? Could they accomplish subbing even 5 minutes of an episode?</br></br>  <br>Why aren't you doing something about it?</br>  <br>they're  perfect </br>  Fansubs used to be necessary.<br><br>Then they became less necessary, and fansubbers panicked and struggled to make themselves relevant, and in the process forgot what the point of fansubbing was.<br><br>They got locked into a speedsubbing race, lost, then tried staying relevant by releasing "better encodes just a little later" and found out nobody really cared because first release = best release for 90% of the plebs. <br><br>So now they have to admit that they aren't necessary anymore, that nobody cares how shiny you make your TV rips because a few months down the line the BDs will be out and some BD group is going to release a batch that all the come-late people will use. Or hell, maybe the Japs will just release the BDs with English subs already on them, cutting out even those guys. <br><br>At this point the only shows that need subs are the obscure ones with few fans, but without demand from their social circles fansubbers are unlikely to bother.<br><br>So dies the fansubber.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>only a few hours, look at some manga they get finished the day the raws get out others take months. it's literally just people being lazy.</br>  <br> Why the fuck isn't anyone doing anything about this? <br> I can't fucking handle hardsubs for all these shows. Someone please save us <br><br>The accumulated filth of all their shitposts and memes will foam up about their waists and all the NEETs and leeches will look up and shout "Save us!"<br><br>...and I'll whisper "no."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how is it FANsubbing then if you don't sub things unless you think it'll make you popular on the forum?</br>  <br>Be your own hero</br>  <br/>  <br> struggled to make themselves relevant, and in the process forgot what the point of fansubbing was. <br>this doesn't sound right at all</br></br>  <br>Scanlators get lazy as fuck if they have no competition. Amazingly, they seem to overcome whatever problems were holding them up if somebody starts releasing new chapters ahead of them.</br>  daiz and jewcob are the only ones to blame.  <br> muh typesetting <br> muh encode quality <br> muh subtitle tracks <br>All vain attempts to remain relevant when in the end speedy releases &gt; all. And they forgot that the point of fansubbing was to make something available that wouldn't be otherwise. Hence why you had 4 or 5 groups subbing the same popular show and other shows would fall through the cracks, forever unsubbed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just like real life businesses.</br>  <br> ANIME IS FOR JERKS </br>  <br>Funi and CR not buying SHIT each season is to blame. Atleast we'd have HS in that case, since fansubbing is dead our entertainment is in their hands.</br>  <br>What do you think of Coalgirls?</br>    <br>See: every /a/ project ever attempted. The Keit-Ai project, for example.</br>  <br>Shit as in "shit shows" or as in "shit"</br>  <br>I've read some Vinland Saga translations by /a/, it was only a few manga chapters but still something.</br>  is this what it feels like to have a monopoly?  <br>Coalgirls isn't even in the same game as the rest. The fansubbers as we know them were trying to sub currently airing shows, and ended up in a speedsub war. Coalgirls aren't speedsubbers, they never were. They're BD/DVD rippers. Their game is providing entire series in high quality for people looking to collect or marathon a show.<br><br>They translate sometimes, others they just use existing subs, maybe edit them a little. Groups like Coalgirls are going to far outlive fansubbers because what they provide will be relevant even if HD streams are eventually perfected and completely supplant fansubs. And of course, other groups can compete with Coalgirls by making batches that won't use up 70% of your HDD space.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh boy, here we go!</br></br>  Shit like AnimeRG continue to have a thick and loyal userbase. <br><br>Fansubs have always been dead.</br></br>  <br> 100 neets <br> actually working together and getting beyond a hello and an arguement of which outfit is better bikini or panties/bra <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br> Kristen <br>duhuhue</br></br>  <br>At least half of the comic has been scanlated by Anon(s).<br><br><br>Jaka &lt;3</br></br></br></br>  <br> They translate sometimes. <br>Yeah like</br></br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br>If there's an anonymous person in the internet I hate, that is you, piece of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember they did some original work on Railgun S, which is the reason why I didn't download their batch for it.

So once again, thank Daiz for for maintaining HS's monopoly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But why bother replacing them? Is it just out of spite? What has poor Jaka ever done to you?</br>  <br>there are also multiple load-balanced ripping services and proxies for ripping region-blocked shows</br>  <br>I care. I got into subbing because one sub community, RyuuRogue, pretty much abandoned a series right before the end of the show, leaving the last few episodes undone.<br><br>I would sub more things but the biggest issue is I don't understand japanese so I have to work off of a text based script or transcribe subs from another language into english. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing with these animus, but I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>servers*</br>  <br> NEETs know moon <br><br> being NEET sucks <br>Only if you're a normie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Name a single NEET over 30<br>You can't</br></br>  <br>You're great.</br>  <br> anecdotes mean anything </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127804281 <br>she misses you too, dad</br>  <br>Have you seen the catastrophe that is CR's Charlotte?

Instead of that fucking cool typesetting we got MENACING. Say what you will about them but their Jojo subs were great.  <br>I don't know what stuff you've subbed, but i appreciate what you do.</br>  Does Dattebayo still sub Naruto?   tfw still waiting for Commie's Tsukimonogatari   When did retards start thinking crunchyroll releases are good?  <br>How are they not good? My only gripe is that they omit the honorifics but most people prefer that anyway.</br>  <br> tfw still waiting for Commie's Tamako Love Story </br>  <br> tfw still waiting for Commie's Haikyuu </br>  <br>They're all over the place in quality on release day. The only way you could legitimately think they're good is if you're watching shows directly from them long after they aired when they took time to fix their shit</br>  <br>Most likely when they actually became good since CR improved unlike funishit.</br>  Bad English subs are the best because you can imagine that a qt Jap girl tried to translate it for you.  <br>Maybe two years ago but not now. They actually rarely edit their scripts after release nowadays, and it's usually for some very crude errors which are pretty obvious and easy to spot anyway. Example: first episode of FSN when they mistranslated Archer's ``color''.</br>  Is Cthuko based?  <br>Anime about cute girls fansubbing when?</br>  <br>Because compared to Funi their quality is indeed amazing.</br>  <br>I've always been pleased by their stuff. They can be slow as hell though.</br>  <br>I know what you mean, anon. Although i haven't kept up with recent anime because my internet is so slow my patience to keep up thinned out, fansubs were norm. /a/ has changed.</br>  <br>Because they have good memes.</br>  <br> waiting for Commie Tsukimonogatari when Coalgirls's version is out </br>  <br>What are you watching from them? I only use HS when it's the only thing that will be out before the BDs and every episode of Fafner Exodus had sets of ridiculously obvious mistakes.</br>  <br>They've improved, but they're still not as good as some subgroups.</br>  <br>Dunno, ask Timecop.</br>  <br> Coalgirls </br>  What happened to caffeine actually? Not only they are slow as fuck but they also dropped half of their shows.  <br>This season alone? DRRR, Gatchaman, Charlotte, Rokka no Yusha, and Ushio to Tora.</br>  <br>They're just being incompetent. They'll probably disband pretty soon but who gives a shit.</br>  <br>Lack of management, according to Kaylith's old leader. They're basically dead.</br>  Why should I give a fuck about egotistic fucks who do shit translations and take longer than professionals to get out an anime? I'm glad they're all dead. Every one of them.  Except Mazui because they brought me memories I can never repay.   <br> egotistic fucks <br>T R I P F A G<br>R<br>I<br>P<br>F<br>A<br>G<br><br>:^)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tripfag calling other people egoistic fucks </br>  <br> egotistic fucks <br> tripfag </br></br>  This happens every goddamn season, people will pick up shows because Funi's poorly encoded hardsubbed video is the worst. It'll be harder now that they picked up half the season but CR still has the majority  at least that I'm willing to watch  and groups just need to decide what they want to pick up. First and second eps are always the most frightening but by ep 4 this shit will be long forgotten.  This is the first season I'm actually worried. fansubs is dedder than ever and funimation has half the shows this season. I've never been more motivated to learn nip than I am right now. It's either that or give up on airing shows.  <br>Even then, raw encodes are usually crappier than proper fansub encodes from an experienced encoder. I really mourn the (effective) death of groups like UTW, Mazui,  gg , Eclipse. I think Vivid is the only group that is doing a consistent and timely job on the shows they pick up now. (Though Underwater has been doing more self-translations lately, which is good.)</br>  <br> complaining about a free service </br>  <br>Where do you think you are?</br>  I fansubbed two episodes when I was NEET a year ago. It was pretty fun but harder than I'd anticipated.<br><br>VN translation is the new frontier of Japanese fan translations.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather not wait years for fansubs<br> Still waiting on UTW to finish SYD* </br></br>  <br>   Still waiting on UTW to finish SYD* <br>They officially dropped it a while ago. Also they're dead now.</br></br>  <br> not waiting for Nise </br>  <br>Sorry, anon, the jews won.</br>   2015 <br> not having funi ane cr subs <br>ishgyddt</br></br>  Is this not what the fansubbers of the old wanted?<br>Originally people fansubbed because people wanted to bring shows, OVA's and movies that they loved to the English speaking world during a time where the typical anime would likely never get an official English release.<br><br><br>We now live in a time where almost every show this season has an official English release. Isn't this what the fansubber of old wanted? Now fansubbers don't have to fight the clock and do speedy releases just for the sake of being fast. Now they can sub whatever they want and even do manga which probably needs more people if anything.<br><br>So why exactly is there a problem?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Times have changed, man.</br>  Still waiting for Eclipse to finish Maid-sama and Triad to finish Kaiji.  <br>We grew complacent.</br>  <br>People are paying for a shitty product. I wouldn't even torrent a funimation show, much less pay for it. Crunchyroll is at least acceptable now, they've improved in recent years and I hope to see them continue that trend. I hope funi dies, this is one of the few situations I rather have a monopoly.</br>  <br>Simulcast websites don't do OVAs (not sure about movies), and since the fansubs died out there's nobody left to translate those anymore.</br>  <br> That's not entirely true. <br> There's a few groups who still do their own translations and most of the time they end up sounding more natural than the CR ones. <br><br>So deluded<br><br>I</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that the fansubbers fault though? Or do companies like Funi send C&amp;D for OVA's too?</br>  <br>Fansubbers having higher standards on visual quality than said official products, for one thing.</br>  <br>can't beat them drone's man, i told you bro can't beat them drones!</br>  At this point I wouldn't mind if Commie did every show.<br><br>I'll take the memes, just don't make me watch Funi please god.</br></br>  <br>The main(lazy) part of them only does crunchy edits</br>  <br>The only problem I had with funi in a long while is the overlord episode at 15 fps. <br><br>Aside from that what's the problem?People complain about the color but since I have my own settings It always looks fine.<br>Also I won't wait 3 weeks for my fucking hobby, i'm not autistic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> if you won't eat shit you have autism </br>  in the course of commies 2yr backlog you shouldve learned enough nip to no longer need shitty fansubs  <br>Sorry but not everyone here is a loser NEET who can waste hundreds of hours learning a pointless dead language just to enjoy some cartoons. Get a life, dude.</br>  <br>Then tell me why it's shit. I gave my arguments and all you said is "it's shit". <br><br>Tell me 1 reason I should wait 3 weeks for commie instead of just watching my damn anime the day it comes out?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I agree, bitching about subs on /a/ is much more important when it comes to time usage.</br>  <br>I have troubles getting out of my house lately or seeing too much people. I used to party all the time but now I just feel bad out of here. <br> And learning online is a big no because it's shit and a waste of time.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Crunchyroll is also not the same old crunchyroll. After CR was purchased by a media company holding corporation, the translation quality, speed, and visual quality improved by a great margin. Some japanese fans point out that a good number of CR's 1080p streamed videos are better than what they get in japan from network TV. Thus, the old argument that streamed quality was less than broadcast quality doesn't hold true anymore for CR anime. <br><br>What is needed now is for the USA to join TPP or some other copyright and patent "free trade treaty" in the future. That will allow the companies to have more freedom to take risks in putting out anime without the feeling that the costs will not be recovered. Most anime, if only video sales were used as the source of income, would lose money. After all, the retailer takes a huge cut of the sales price, the distributor takes another cut, and the production committee takes its cut, leaving the studio with a small fraction from which it has to pay taxes, benefits, pensions, salaries, investors, etc. That's why Japanese anime companies need something like TPP to be joined by the USA, Canada, and eventually the other countries. TPP will be unhappily invasive, but it should be able to put a stop to scofflaws since media counterfeiting will finally be criminalized. So instead of a civil suit, even the local police can show up to arrest someone and search their home just like in an assault or murder case.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What is needed now is for the USA to join TPP </br>  <br>Sounds great. Can we get this TPP thingy in the UK too? I am sick of people illegally stealing their media, although with anime it's a bit different.</br>  <br><br>In two years, the surviving mass-audience fansubbing groups will have ceased to exist, and /a/ will consume nothing but streams from Funimation and Crunchyroll, and whatever other platforms rise to prominence  inb4 that's all /a/ consumes already.  The only remaining fansub groups will be specialty operations that distribute inaccessible older shows.<br><br>The long arm of capitalism has reached out and grabbed anime, and it won't be letting go.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What is needed now is for the USA to join TPP <br>Enjoy your dead doujins.</br></br>  I give fucks. I didn't sleep last night in order to finish putting way too much effort into something a bunch of leechers won't give two shits about. And I'm probably going to keep doing that every week.  <br> &gt;complaining about a free service <br><br>Because self-entitlement is an important part of being selfish people who have little appreciation for others. In the case of anime fandom, it is sad to see because many people remember when things weren't that way and thus we're all watching the wreckage appear in slow motion.</br></br></br>  <br> The long arm of capitalism has reached out and grabbed anime, and it won't be letting go. <br><br>Free enterprise is good man. It's the communist wanna-bes that continue to steal anime instead of paying for it. There's also plenty of good-sounding justifications for shoplifting, murder, assault, and media theft, but that doesn't make any of them right. Sure, being against murder makes you a moralfag. But the world works because people follow morals even if in many cases laws enforce that behavior with punishments for the immoral.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not implying it's IRC's new trolling plan, but it is IRC's new trolling plan.<br><br>Working on a single show isn't efficient enough, you need to attack the core.</br></br></br>  <br>People finally realized that anime is shit.<br><br>Adaptations are always worse than their source material, and original series are trash.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Caffeine Kaylith without a leader?</br>  Good riddance. <br><br>If only fansubs actually do real translations and not memetranslation and over localized garbage people would actually care about them dying. <br><br>HS is all we need.</br></br></br></br>  <br> hurr durr, don't complain about tap water tasting funny, it's free </br>  <br>But the best animes are all originals... :/</br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  <br><br>To be clear, I didn't mean to suggest that it's a bad thing.

It's a minority. I hope you don't think that counts as a trend or anything like that.</br></br>  I dread the beginning of every season because not only do I have to choose all the shows I want to watch, I have to try to pick the best sub group for each one.

They've already dipped their toes in with Knights of Sidonia.</br></br></br>  Meanwhile in France, people are getting crazy with the whole "need to help the industry go use official services otherwise you're a filthy pirate".<br><br>There's literally 3 distributors, two of them work with monthly subscription (CR, ADN) and the third one (Wakanim) is pay-to-stream or pay-to-download.<br><br>CR's 720p/1080p cost 5€/month, ADN's 720p cost 7€/month and their 1080p cost 10€/month.<br>Wakanim pay-to-stream (30 days only) cost 0.79€ and pay-to-download cost 1.58€. Note that those prices are for a single episode.<br>If I'd pay ADN/CR/Wakanim for watching their shows, it'd cost me ~40€ a month.<br>There's just no way I can afford me that.<br><br>Not to mention that french groups are absolutely disgusting with their hardsubbed CR rip and their translation from english (they don't even translate typesetting, they just remove it because "it's too much work").</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think the big problem right now is, believe it or not, Funimation is actually a comparatively small business run by a group of people in an office in the middle of Texas. I would suppose they're doing better enough lately that they can finance all these dubbing projects and afford all these show simulcasts. I'm sure, with time, they can afford to outsource to better translators for subs. Why would they spend all this money on shit dubs and not improve sub quality first? That I don't know, but I'm guessing that's what the market wants at the moment.<br><br>Anyways, once they're able to up the quality of their content they'll pose a greater threat to Crunchy, their main rival, and both will be forced to improve even further.</br></br>  <br> CR 720p is $5 a month in France <br>Lucky bastard.

Or is that what the Premium+ is?</br>  <br><br> CR's 720p/1080p cost 5€/month <br>You've got a fantastic deal there now thanks to &gt;denbts<br><br>And that's accounting for it being Premium rather than Premium+.<br><br>If you want to provide some support, just purchase a CR subscription. Surely you can afford 60€/year. And is that before the annual billing discount?<br><br><br><br>Regardless of how /a/ feels about their subtitle quality, it's certainly not a deterrent for their target demographic--that being casual audiences, who provide volume and subscription dollars.

I think I still have my account info.<br><br>That's where I watched Dot Hack Sign.<br><br>I really want to keep softsubs of some kind. Streaming from Crunchyroll is okay for a quick fix of anime to stay in the loop, but It's no good for watching magnificent fullscreen stuff.<br><br>I actually don't get ads on Crunchyroll when I watch. I just get momentary pauses where the screen turns black for a second. Adblock for the win, I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What is needed now is for the USA to join TPP <br>Had me going there for a sec</br></br>  <br>Casual as a label is increasingly meaningless on /a/ anyway. For the most part, it just means 'people who know less about anime than me'.</br>  <br> Hulu has a pretty decent catalog of series <br>Nice try, but this is a cleverly disguised troll post</br></br>  <br>Ever notice that everyone who watches less anime than you is a filthy casual that needs to fuck off to reddit, and everyone who watches more is a hopeless nerd that needs to get a life.</br>  <br>I seriously don't know what "casual" is anymore.<br>Now I'm starting to doubt whether I ever did know what it was.</br></br>  <br> Do you get the anime+manga option in France too? <br>Yes, we get it in the Premium offer.<br><br> what the Premium+ is? <br>The Premium+ offer contains some bullshit for conventions and website beta-test.<br><br><br> If you want to provide some support <br>I'm already buying a lot of manga and I'm only buying them because I love the feeling of the paper.<br>I'm not intending to purchase a CR subscription as I can download HS, rip CR FR subs and I'm ready to go, moreover I hate streaming.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that what the actual meaning is before /v/ corrupted the word?</br>  <br><br>This is how we kill buzzwords.<br><br><br><br>Fair enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't really make sense for anime like it did for vidya. You can define a casual vidya as one that's easy to learn/master pretty easily, but one cartoon isn't anymore difficult to watch than another</br>  <br>I'm just reading this and shaking my head. This is what /a/ has become</br>  <br>why do things for free, when you can have all the shows just for yourself</br>  <br>thanks for subs, yours were the first one i ever got.<br>you fag</br></br>  <br><br>to be fair ,polish streams have actually pretty good quality and no watermarks</br></br>  Most fansubs only got better encodes going for them. I don't want to wait weeks and months for karaoke and marginally better scripts.<br>Everyone should learn moon anyway.</br>  <br>Didn't stop people from filing certain series under the label of being "entry-level" and treating this status as a bad thing.</br>  <br>Crunchyroll killed them by breaking their promise and converting to Judaism.<br><br>Fakku and Subdesu-H did the same and their only free opponent is ExHen and Erobeat respectively.</br></br></br>  <br>YuruYuri is probably easier watch than LoGH or Zeta</br>  <br>Depends on what you like. If you don't like cute girl highschool moeshit but love boring space shit and toy commercials then LoGH and Zeta would be easier to watch than YuruYuri.</br>  <br>The concept of entry level can work when everyone gets into anime from the same place. Stuff that aired on Toonami was "entry-level" because people who weren't actively into anime would watch. There was a difference in popularity between "stuff everyone has watched" and "stuff only people who actively seek out anime will have watched". <br>It doesn't really work these days though when most people get into anime through the internet and everyone will have something totally different as their "entry level".</br></br>  <br><br>The same comparison could be made of vidja genres. Few games are &gt;objectively difficult above and beyond the norm.</br></br>  <br>But there are different levels of complexity and a more complex game takes more effort to learn than a simple one.<br>Difficulty doesn't really factor into that as plenty of games with lots of rules and systems are piss easy once you've learnt them.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, if you like more complex shows it's easier to watch them. Simple shows remain simple no matter what.</br>  <br><br> tmw you don't say Wakanim is 30 days free per episode before you need to pay, for a decent quality. I think CR is the same as in murica though, sub for episode asap if you pay, or a week after if you don't. The only retarded one imo is ADN, because you have to wait 2 weeks for most of the series, and PAY for them (some are free to watch for 2 weeks before getting paid-only but that's very few, actually). </br></br>  Does anyone have the official simulcasting rights to DB Super yet? I assume Funi will do it, but I haven't heard anything.  I don't know you guys but I preffer Crunchyroll™ with they vast catalog of animes like Sword Art Online,Naruto,Attack on Titan™,etc<br>And you actually support the studios!<br>Just for 9.99™ a month! sounds like a good deal to me.<br>Thanks Crunchyroll ™</br></br></br>  How many fansub groups are actually alive and decent? Commie and FFF are a shell of their former selves right now. UTW is confirmed ded. DDY can range from Hadena tier to ok, the same as Chihiro and A-Koi. All the EveTaku splinter groups seem to kill themselves fairly quickly, too. Underwater has given up on all those BD releases and shows they promised. We don't even have decent groups comitting to traditionally "big" titles, like Im@s or Prisma Ilya.<br><br>Funimation and CR are worse than ever this season, but nobody is there to save us from it. Vivid is about the only group doing consistenly timely and good releases these days, along with Commie (although Commie is just herkz really).<br><br>How can the situation improve? Sure, there are lots of anon subbers coming in that do shit jobs, that could be taught to do well. But there aren't even enough people left in the fansubbing industry to do that. <br><br>I know we have a backlog of decades of stuff that needs subs, but in this day and age it's ridiculous to have virtually unwatchable subs as the only option for an airing show.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  There'll be a good group working on the Eva bd box set, right?  <br>Every active group and some that don't exist yet will be doing the Eva BDs</br>  Still no real subs for the last three episodes of Yatterman.   still no good LWA release   <br>The BD isn't out yet.</br>  <br>That's because there's no raw available yet, you idiot. We only got the release that we got because it was sent to backers' emails.</br>  <br> mfw no one bother doing BD releases for some series </br>   relying on translations   <br> How many fansub groups are actually alive and decent? <br>6</br></br>   extant fansubbing groups could be heros and sub DVD-only OVAs, but instead they all choose to be snobs, and refuse to sub anything that is sub BD quality because it would tarnish their good name.   <br><br>Except Commie doesn't fucking FINISH THE SUBS. <br><br>Doremi isn't my favorite sub group, their translations often have a lot of problems. But without them I would not have PreCure, because no one else does PreCure properly. They can do weekly releases, year after year, while other sub groups usually just drop the ball after 3 or 4 weeks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why don't you sub them</br>   those years when fansubs were prolific <br> SS <br> Eclipse <br> Lunar <br> Triad <br> those times are gone and will never come back <br><br>Time to die</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   watching Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru <br> can't tell if Commie's subs are ok or they're too busy inserting their epic memes and calling people retards </br>  <br> Except Commie doesn't fucking FINISH THE SUBS. <br>What? They finished Dokidoki in time for the end of it. Heartcatch didn't have any delays, and the 11 day delay for GoPri now is not out of the norm for Doremi either.<br><br>I just with Doremi would be on time and consistent with their Doremi # releases. They've been really slow.</br></br></br></br>  But scanlations are alive and better than ever! <br><br>Fuck your moving cartoons guys, time to go old school, read manga.</br></br>  <br> Triad </br>  <br>Those were all shit groups though, looking back on it. Peak fansubbing was around 2012, in terms of quality.</br>  <br>But none of those groups were good</br>  Because we don't need it anymore. There might come a time when CR and Funi become worse enough that they're unbearable for everyone, and when there's such a demand I expect fansubbing will become common once again. At the moment most people are satisfied with what we have.  Fansubbing is dead because there's very little demand for it anymore, unlike a decade ago when it was all we really had. There's nothing any of you can do, aside from you actually getting into fansubbing in the first place.<br><br>In any case, I don't give a fuck. The golden age of fansubbing was pretty horrible with very sloppy translations, memesubbing, and needing to wait 3-4 days for subs to come out for most shows, not to mention groups all competing over a few popular shows leaving many seasonal shows unsubbed.</br></br>  <br> not to mention groups all competing over a few popular shows leaving many seasonal shows unsubbed. <br>Before we got good translations for many shows, with some left unsubbed. Now we get okay-bad translations for many shows, and seasonal shows are still unsubbed. The situation now is much worse than it was a few years ago.</br></br>  <br>Why do so many manga groups come out of SEA?</br>  <br>There are way way more shows subbed now and at much faster speed. The market shows that people are satisfied with the translations too (I think they're satisfactory for most seasonal shit).</br>  <br>Have you seen the TL for any of funi's shows this season, Charlotte, etc? Terrible. It's not like people will stop watching subs that are bad, beacuse the common streamer is conditioned to think that it is the norm. Market forces don't really come into play here.</br>  Because anime get worst by season, and nobody want to sub shit show.  <br>Sure, keep pining for that rosy nostalgia-tinted past. I sure as hell am glad that I don't have to watch a series that suddenly stops getting subbed due by some fansub group due to some irl problem and doesn't get fully subbed until the next season's shows have started airing.</br>  <br>To become a niche is to kill the whole thing. I don't wanna to start to buy DVD's to watch muh nipponese sequential drawings.</br>  <br>But that still happens frequently.</br>  Can't say I mind. All the worthwhile shows either get picked up by CR or Funimation and contrary to what newfags looking to fit in think, their subs are some of the best I've seen. The only thing you can really knock either company for is trivial shit like honorifics and that comes down to personal preference.  I still really appreciate the effort put in by fabsubbers. Watching anime on CR/funi is a rollercoaster of subtitle quality.<br>For some shows the translations are excellent while others are borderline unwatchable. You just never know what you're gonna get.</br>  <br>If people wanted good translations enough, it'd be subbed. People obviously don't care enough since the translations are passable. /a/ just likes to autistically nitpick sometimes.</br>  <br> their subs are some of the best I've seen <br>you don't see with your eyes, now do you</br></br>  <br>Charlotte isn't a Funimation show.<br><br>Please stop talking out of your ass. You can just say you don't like them because reasons. No one cares about your personal opinion.</br></br></br>  What's an example of a badly subbed show from this season? I ask because I usually don't pay that much attention to subs.  <br>Go into detail or fuck off. It's too easy to reply "NUH-UH!" to make yourself seem like you're on higher footing when you've given nothing to rebuttal with.</br>  <br>He didn't say it was. The official subs aren't good, though.</br>  <br>What exactly?

Even the smallest Japanese baths are deep enough to completely submerge yourself in. Pic related. That bath went below the level of the floor and I was able to get my head under the water with it filled to the brim.  <br>Western baths are normal. its the Japanese ones who are strangely luxurious.<br><br>If I ever happen to get in one I doubt I could leave.</br></br></br>  I fucking love taking a bath but there's only a shower in my current apartment. From time to time I'm just lying down in it, curled in fetal position. To live is to suffer, and then you die.  A bath is nice and all but I like taking a nap in the shower, the water hitting me like that is really soothing.

I will take the notes to heart.</br>  <br>I'd say 3 volumes, since chapter 09 reveals  Alfou's past . So 6/7 more chapters , unless Okada wants to write more about it.</br>     I wish it was real.   /a/, what is the most disturbing thing you've ever read/seen in a hentai?  <br>Nah, youre already on the ride. Finish up</br>  <br>More like cynical based in reality. It probably happens all the time but we just don't hear of it because its not news worthy nor does anyone really care about it.<br><br> Truthfully no amount of pain or blood from them could ever be enough to account for her 44 days of hell. Makes you want to be more cautious around others and to keep closer watch on your loved ones so this does not ever happen to them. If you have a sister go tell her that you love her because this could happen to her and there would be nothing you could do to stop it </br></br></br>  <br>I think Uziga Waita blew it for this one. He had a chance to attempt to capture the fetish, sexuality, and psychology of the whole incident, so that there's something interesting speculation going on in it. Instead, he made a usual cartoonish porn guro, with cartoonish yakuzas and edgy dialogues. Even reading crime reports are more interesting than that.</br>  There was this one Manga of a family who were different Zoo animals, with their faces still being human. Then they fucked each other or something. My memory is quite hazy. It wasn't very graphic but I still find it the most disturbing. <br><br>Does anyone know what I'm talking of?</br></br>  <br>you are a special kind of retard. Its been explained to you so many times and you still dont understand. just leave.</br>  Anyone watching this show?  <br>I found educational part of the show to be the more interesting one so the more of the working process they show the better.</br>  <br>可愛イ～ィ！(ノ*゜▽゜*)</br>  best ending song is best  ZANKOKU NA TENSHI NO TEEZE  <br> Katakana with Kanji <br>Why?</br></br></blockquote>]
