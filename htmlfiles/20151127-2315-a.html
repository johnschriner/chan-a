If it's the films, yes, Casca enjoyed it and Guts got kek'd thoroughly. If it was the manga, she did not enjoy having to pass the resulting demonspawn from her now barren womb.<br><br>I fapped to both, and so should you.

Past its popularity? Yes, Gantz is, too, that's why I'd say Berserk is probably the most entry-level "dark" seinen.</br>  <br>No, i mean most casual viewers didn't bother reading Gantz and i nobody even recommends it cause it goes to shit after the vampires.<br><br>It doesn't feel like Berserk is popular, lots of people are offput by the number of chapters. That and there's still good discussions going, meaning there isn't that much of a influx of new readers.</br></br></br>  This is now a meta thread.<br><br>Okay /a/nons, how would you rate 2015 /a/?<br>Early 2015 was unexpectedly decent for me.</br></br></br>  Spoiler any minute now  <br> Etofags <br>I'm a fucking Toukafag and I'm annoyed with this faggot.

Europeans constantly developed new weapons and blades because they had to. Japan kept the same design for 700 years because they were on an island and didn't have the need to really develop it, and it wasn't even used that much in battle anyway.

Who found Reiners hiding spot? Who found out the identity of the Titans? It was Armin. Who got half the SL killed running into a forest? Who makes the shittiest strategies and constantly relies on gambles and luck to win? Who led them into their most recent problem and the current commanders death? Commander Erqin shit.</br></br></br>  What the fuck? An anon told me MC would go back in time again and set everything right. Does the story really end with chapter 21? What a bad end.  <br>I think you're thinking of that other manga where the mc has sexy hijinks happening.</br>  <br><br>wow, people shitpost on the internet<br>who would have thought</br></br></br>  So I watched Zeta Gundam and why is everyone in this series so violent?<br><br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KLU5m<wbr>FoJtKM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>A few punches and slaps wouldn't hurt but they're costantly beating the shit out of each other for no reason</br></br></br></br>  Mobile Slap Gundam  Thats what makes it the best gundam<br><br>Also it breaks up the monotony of the muh cyber newtype plot which recurs about 50 times throughout the anime</br></br>  <br> Kamille punches Char <br> He has a monologue while flying  <br><br>I can't stop laughing</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>*the franchise</br></br>  <br>That's not Char.</br>  So I'm guessing they won't ever release Episode 1 and 3 in its "uncensored" format ever again?  I like when artists draw Kara crying while topping  <br><br>Shittiest girl.</br></br>  <br>In fandom, he usually'd cream himself over the prospect of cash.<br><br>In terms of other exaggerations, he's apparently horny for Choro/Ichi/Kara and generally seems to be indifferent towards anything that goes on in the house. When incest happens, he's usually the one to go "Oh, this again" and lies down on his side until it all blows over.</br></br></br>  Totoko is a bitch, but it's like she doesn't realize it.<br>Like that time she defended Chibita from Iyami because she truly worried about him. But she ended up becoming the ballerina instead of Chibita, which made him super fucking sad and she didn't care.<br>She's good yet bad.</br></br>  <br>Why? She's just as petty and selfish as they are.</br>  Whats the worst anime you've ever watched?  <br>See, the problem with answering this question is that I'm only going to finish watching an anime if I like it to some extent.<br><br>The worst anime that I've watched won't be something horrible. It'll be something mildly enjoyable but not really remarkable.</br></br></br>  <br>I was going to answer Chaos;head as well but then this post reminded me I actually watched Glasslip. Fuck you for reminding me.</br>  The Tekken movie<br>Pupa</br>  I was desperate for yuri.
