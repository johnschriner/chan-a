[ Goddammit, I was not prepared for that.<br>And now I'm sitting here trying to hold back my tears.<br><br>Fate thread.</br></br></br>  <br>http://tmdict.com/</br>  <br> Gate of Babylon &gt; Army of Soldiers <br>If Gil use only GoBspam Iskander actually have some chances. His limit is 5-6 mid-tier servants as I remember.</br></br>  <br>Just skip what you watched for the good scenes, bad ends and tiger dojo.<br><br>Also, the kiss and sex scene.</br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>You can always try getting Good End.<br><br>I mean the scenes for it are almost 100% inferior to the ones that lead you to True End, but they'd be new to you because the anime completely chose not to do them.</br></br></br>  You've forgotten chidori's notes, what do you do?  What's your favourite episode of Fumoffu?<br><br>The rugby episode for me</br></br>  <br>I wanted to see that fight m8. Though, i must admit, it was well made with that artsy shit.</br>  <br>It's up there. I guess the "forgotten the homework" episode. Although iirc, it was only the first half.</br>  <br>What was the dream about?</br>  <br>Was that the hot spring episode?</br>  Who is the most overrated Anime studio?  Studios I don't like  They made that Manabi Straight show, didn't they?<br><br>That was a cute series.</br></br>  KyoAni  Actually Sunrise.  KyoAni  ITT: common misconceptions you had about anime characters before you watched the anime<br><br>I'll start: I thought Holo was a catgirl</br></br>  <br>unlimited crab works<br> still way better than anything fate-related </br></br>  <br>I haven't watched Kekkai Sensen, but I actually thought the same just based off seeing a couple of pictures of Leo while browsing a booru and then seeing Klaus as the wiki page's pic when I only briefly looked it up without really reading anything.</br>  <br>Careful, you'll trigger the autists.</br>  <br>pic for reference</br>  <br>Beware of the consequences of your words. They smell shitposting from all over the net</br>  How can we save best boy in Dragon Ball?  <br> Freeza being brought back and learning about what happened since he died <br>Even Freeza flashback in hell was goofy.</br></br>  <br>He is. <br><br>It's like One Punch Man. The story shows everyone else struggling before the overpowered hero wins easily. Based Satan.</br></br></br>  <br>there were two girls but i dont remember if they went ssj equivalent, they both died before they could transform</br>  <br><br>MOOOOOOOOOODS<br><br>Gohanfags are shitposting again</br></br></br></br>  <br> two girls <br>wtf, its like i didnt even watched it, i cant remember shit</br></br>  Jack is love<br><br>Also did anybody else think his voice actor sounds somewhat different? It sounded like Jack but just slightly deeper than I remember</br></br>  <br>To Yuri? Where the loser ends up being nommed? I don't think so.</br>  <br>Yuya will be saved at the last second be a rescued Yuzu who warps Yuri away.</br>  <br>That didn't save Yuto.</br>  <br>Yuya already ate him before Yuzu showed up. Yuya is just greedy like that. Wants Yuto and Yuzu all to himself, damn the world otherwise.</br>  <br> Seeing Gozaburo vs Kaiba mirroring Yugi vs Kaiba with Exodia, but this time we got a Black one <br><br>I remember watching that shit on Kids WB back in the day. They were having one of their regular contests and you had to identify Gozaburo's voice without seeing him and then go online and enter his name in the box on the YGO Kids WB website. I did it just because but I ended up winning a copy of the Dawn of Destiny XBOX game with the only version of Ra at the time. Shit was fucking GOAT. I actually remember that arc the most because I won the contest.</br></br></br>  http://g-tekketsu.com/<br><br>https://twitter.com/g_tekketsu?orig<wbr>inal_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fg-tekkets<wbr>u.com%2F&amp;profile_id=3187510706&amp;tw_i<wbr>=621160709523533825&amp;tw_p=embeddedti<wbr>meline&amp;tw_w=619169895243120640<br>機動戦士ガンダム　鉄血のオルフェンズ」が10.4 on air</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>holy shit im glad someone else noticed<br><br>why are their legs so small</br></br></br>  <br>That's almost like any Gundam that isn't Build Fighters</br>  <br>This.

No matter how powerful the demon <br> king may be, he would never have to fear him. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Index</br>  <br> Seria keeps trying to have Touma come onto to her, and even goes for lucky pervert events and fucks them up <br>Manga ruins lucky pervert events.

So there will be more girls who can fight, but they will be weaker and much more vulnerable. Also something about Yuuna is suspicious, she might not be human anymore. </br></br></br>   Liltotto is heavily injured, Gigi is unconscious <br> Grimmjow is still chasing Askin <br> A weird guy appears in front of Kenpachi and Mayuri. <br>(Don't have any spoiler pics, have some Aizen instead)</br></br></br>  Just like to note, Hisagi probably ain't dead. He was wounded to attract attention of the medic who will be killed. Think more that he is bait for Hanatarou/Isane/other healers.  <br>hisagi vs nigger round 2</br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  Why do I get the feeling that this match-up : Kenpachi &amp; Mayuri vs Pernida is important? That the revelation of Pernida's identity will be shocking to the two of them?<br>Is there somebody who could be connected to both Kenpachi and Mayuri that is now Pernida?</br>  <br>The only ones that would be shocking to Kenpachi would be Unohana or Yachiru, and I don't think Mayuri would care much about them. I doubt it would be somebody we know.</br>  Potential for some good OC here<br><br> Take screenshot from anime <br> Run it through filter at https://dreamscopeapp.com/ <br> Post results here <br> Other /a/nons try to guess the anime <br><br>You can use other filters but inceptionist and botanical work best for obscuring the screenshot beneath<br><br>Starting off with some easy ones</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN</br>    I've created a monster.  spoiler 794<br><br>chapter about sabo<br>http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>261</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>If he could plan far into the future we wouldn't have had Sabo rely on an amnesia cop-out.</br>  <br><br>Why?
