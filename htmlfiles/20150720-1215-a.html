[ I don't understand this anime at all. First it claims to have an internal logic. The anime clearly establishes that servants are much more powerful than any human. Why does Shirou then defeat Archer, who clearly is the most op servant? He never had any significant training. Back in middle ages they trained knights from small children. Compared to even normal knights Shirou is a fucking nobody. And what is this this bullshit about his body being made swords? So is he a human born out of a woman or is he some just some sort of deus machina? This anime is like first explaining the rules of chess and then Shirou just flips over the chess board and says he won.  Which Archer?  <br> confirmed to be busy sucking dick while watching this <br>they outright say when he fights archer he gets stronger each time they clash swords since some magic bs + Avalon, and he broke archers spirit</br></br>  <br><br> they outright say when he fights archer he gets stronger each time <br><br>That's not a reason why he gets stronger. You can't just establish some new rule in the world of anime in the last episodes where the weakest faggot just gets stronger the more he loses</br></br></br></br>   archer <br><br>Oh yeah sorry meant Gilgamesh. But oh well the same logic applies to archer to since he still would lose 100-0 vs a normal middle age knight. Because he has no training</br></br>  <br>ok. heres the deal<br>he got magic circuits, some inactive since he haven't learned to open/use them yet.<br> time paradox <br>his magic circuits gets opened up when he fights "himself" learning to use them since he can copy and paste shit.</br></br></br></br>  lowqualitybait.jpg<br><br>Report and hide.</br></br>  <br>Against Emiya Archer he wins because Archer was really weak and it was more a battle of ideals.<br><br>Against Gilgamesh he wins because rock paper scissors.</br></br></br>  <br> muh powerlevels <br>When will people get it through their thick skulls that powerlevels are meaningless, what matters is which combatant has more conviction? You'd think they'd eventually figure it out, literally every anime does this.</br></br>  <br> Gil <br>then its a different story.<br>Gil was to full of himself. as you could see shriou went full offencive, giving gil little time to do anything big. and when he tried to use EA it was to late.<br>Think of it seeing a knife fight, only gil brought out the gun when it was too late</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> it was more a battle of ideals. <br><br>Clickbait.jpg<br><br>No such a thing exists. There hasn't been a single MMA or boxing fight fight that was "battle of ideals"<br><br>Who the fuck feeds you this shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But gil should have just raped the little child before anything could happen. Just summon 10 million swords and turn around as Shirou dies. It's like I would have to fight a 2-year old</br></br>  <br>Gil doesn't have 10 million swords.<br>And I'm pretty sure there is a limit to how much he can expand his GOB.<br><br>He shot as many as he could at Shirou, and Shirou got through it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Power levels matter much more in this anime. In naruto everyone is a just ninja. Theoretically anyone can beat anyone. But fate clearly establishes that humans are like a little children vs The mountain from game of thrones</br></br>  <br>he did that, nuked him with sword around him.<br>but shirou used that shield and came falling down on him, <br>Gil saw that using swordspam was useless since he either countered them or now had a sheild against them, last resort was EA+ it was the first to have a fair fight against him. As you seen earlier he just goofed around.<br>Remember thatn UBW allowed Shrou to swordspam faster then gil</br></br></br></br>  <br>tl;dr : it's shit.<br><br>Nasu is a hack, his whole plot is a twist, and he covers his unlimited plotholes with more twists, i cringed so hard in UBW that i fractured my skull. that said, Fate/Zero is a decent anime<br><br>This thread will get infested by fatefags</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a fucking story, not a real fight.</br>  <br><br>Why was he able to conjure a shield powerful enough to defend vs a servants attacks?</br></br>  <br><br>This is where I'm getting at. Just seems like Nasu is a hack. <br><br><br><br>Makes no difference. The better fighter wins. Which is gil by a landslide. It's not an argument on who has the better ideal but a fight where the stronger one wins. I'm pretty sure Mike tyson would beat Einsteins ass</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The anime clearly establishes that servants are much more powerful than any human. Why does Shirou then defeat Archer, who clearly is the most op servant? He never had any significant training. <br>They LITERALLY had a human earlier in the show (the teacher) who was matching Servants in strength. It's not the show's fault you can't pay the slightest bit of attention.<br><br>Anyway, there are a number of reasons Shirou got stronger. He had his magic circuits opened, he had Rin's mana pool to feed off of, his exchanges with Archer seemed to be to "teaching" him how to fight through time hijinks, and avalon gave him superhuman healing powers</br></br></br></br>  <br>He got that from his future self, Archer used it against Lancer before.<br>And as I said he unlocked some powerups fighting his future self. But anime left out how the fuck he learned to use that shield IÂ´ll give you that.</br></br>  <br>It's like you didn't even watch the show.</br>    <br><br> They LITERALLY had a human earlier in the show (the teacher) who was matching Servants in strength. <br><br>Oh you mean the woman that was a mage? Yeah no one gives a fuck about that one.<br><br>  and avalon gave him superhuman healing powers <br><br>When did this happen?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou can learn the experiences of the weapons he projects.<br>When he fights Archer he gets stronger every move because he's reading archer and completing himself. He's not supposed to have that power but fighting his future self activates his circuits.<br>Also<br> The anime clearly establishes that servants are much more powerful than any human. <br>No, the anime establishes than servants are more powerful than most humans. Servants were human once, broke as fuck humans. <br>Broke as fuck humans could in theory fight servants.<br><br>  And what is this this bullshit about his body being made swords <br>Literally what they say. He has avalon inside him<br><br>I know this is bait but I wanted to clear it up, sort off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Makes no difference. <br>Yes it does. Stories have different rules than MMA or boxing matches.</br></br>  <br><br>It's just a real world example so your autistic ass can understand something.</br></br>  <br>Better fighter is Shirou though.<br><br>Gil just cheats hardcore by having fancy weapons.<br>Most which are countered by UBW, and the other one being to awesome to use against a goober like Shirou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil vs shirou wasn't a battle of ideals.<br>Archer vs shirou WAS a battle of ideals, archer could've killed shirou multiple times throughout the story if that was his goal but what he wanted was to crush shirou's ideal and in turn his own ideal to prove that he was 'right' in feeling betrayed by his ideal, if he didn't crush shirou's spirit then it wouldn't matter. He hoped that by crushing his own ideal and then killing shirou he would possibly be able to create a time paradox and delete himself from existance.<br><br>Gil vs shirou is because gil didn't use his most powerful weapons because he wouldn't ever use enkidu on shirou (not to mention it wouldn't matter much since shirou isn't divine at all) and he doesn't even consider shirou worthy enough to look at Ea, let alone fight against it.<br>And inside of UBW shirou has the advantage, the anime did a shitty job of showcasing why shirou won though.<br>In the VN he wins because he an swordspam much faster than gil forcing them into a 1v1 fight where gil's gate of babylon is negated entirely making him fairly mediocre as a fighter whilst shirou can copy the skills of the weapons he uses giving him an advantage, when gil finally tries to pull out Ea because he's losing shirou has a shot and cuts off gil's arm.<br>If gil had used Ea right away there wouldn't ever have been a fight, everytime Gil loses a fight in FSN it's because he was arrogant or underestimated his opponent.<br><br>Is it good writing? I don't think so, but it doesn't really break any of the internal rules the world works in.<br>Gil is far stronger than shirou, it's not even close, but gil doesn't want to use his true strength against shirou which gives shirou a chance he shouldn't have had to begin with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your example doesn't work when it doesn't operate under the same rules as the thing in question.</br>  <br> Makes no difference. The better fighter wins. <br><br>And that is Shirou. Gil is stronger, not better at fighting.<br>Shirou has great technique and swordsmanship(Archer's), Gilgamesh swings his swords like a fucking retard and depens on muh swordspam<br><br><br> Oh you mean the woman that was a mage? Yeah no one gives a fuck about that one. <br>I think he meant Kuzuki kicking Saber's ass with Medea power up.<br><br> When did this happen? <br>When he fucking healed himself and we saw avalon you mouthbreather</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>archer could've killed shirou in the exact moment he met shirou<br><br>shitty writting</br></br></br>    <br>Archer was out of mana AND not seriously fighting. He didn't want to straight up kill Shirou. He wanted to kill his spirit and ideals so that the future of becomint a counter-guardian wouldn't happen. Hence why he didn't stab him at the end of the fight.</br>  <br> When did this happen? <br>They outright tell you about this in the archer vs shirou fight + it's information that's revealed in the previous route. They even gave away the previous route for free in japan because they expect you to have read it.</br></br>   trying to find sense in generic shounen powerlevel porn game writing <br><br>My sides</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>this is what you get OP, why do you think the fate fanbase has the most ammount of bait edits?, their fanbase is the most cancerous thing in anime</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, he could have, but JUST killing shirou was never his goal, hell that becomes abundantly clear in HF where he again has multiple chances to kill shirou but knows he doesn't have any chances to break his spirit and ideal so he rather helps shirou and saves shirou's life.</br>  <br><br> Better fighter is Shirou though. <br><br>Well that's kinda true in brute strength. Btw why the fuck didn't Gil just lock Shirou in place with the chain thing like he did to Rider? Clearly Rider weighs more than dyel-Shirou?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Samefagging this hard <br><br>You're the cancerous fuck, shitposting and getting your ass kicked by arguments</br></br></br>  <br> HF <br> Arm transplant <br> Serious writting </br></br></br>  <br>I didn't call it serious or good writing, but it's not really inconsistent either.<br>I also think archer showing up to save shirou and rin was retarded and awful writing, but i do not consider it an asspull since spirit cores and battle continuation were pre-established before it happened.</br></br>  <br> Well that's kinda true in brute strength <br><br>You mean the opposite right? Gil has pure strenght. Shirou has skill. <br><br> why the fuck didn't Gil just lock Shirou in place with the chain thing like he did to Rider? <br>First of all him using Enkidu is only for people he thinks are worthy of it.<br>And if he actually used it Shirou has no divinity so the chains are normalfag chains, he would just break them with little to no effort. <br><br>Also your Zerofag is showing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate fanbase!</br>  <br>Chain only works on characters with Divinity.<br><br>If used against Shirou he would just sword spam the chain to pieces.</br></br></br>  <br>Enkidu is gil's most beloved treasure, he doesn't consider shirou worthy and enkidu is only strong against targets with high divinity.</br>  <br>He would just break them, Shirou has super strengh, supersanic speed and shit like that strenght when projecting</br>  <br><br> And if he actually used it Shirou has no divinity so the chains are normalfag chains, <br><br>Huh okay they never explained this.<br><br> Also your Zerofag is showing <br><br>Well obviously as ubw was 5/10 at best and zero 9/10<br><br>This was just childish shonen with the good guy winning. Plus awful soundtrack. wtf was up with that? Heck they could have just used the exact same ost from zero and this would instantly been at least 6/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Reddit pasta <br><br>go away.<br>away you go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yuki kajiura was busy getting cucked by her husband</br>  <br> Huh okay they never explained this. <br>So you simply don't pay attention at all?</br></br>    <br>  is litterally showed to become one of those servants later <br>  weakest shit </br></br>  So who was the red man?  <br>The series can't follow it's own internal logic. They want you to believe he's super strong, but can't stop making him job to characters.</br>  <br> he would just break them with little to no effort.  <br><br> "Guh, damnâ¦!" <br> I try to get the chain off of me, but it doesn't even budge. <br> This chain even restrained Berserker. It's not something I can pry offâ¦! </br></br></br></br></br>   Gil doesn't even consider berseker worthy of using Ea <br> People wonder why he doesn't use it against shirou </br>  <br><br>They either didn't explain it. Or they explained so badly that I don't remember it. Clearly there's some reason I don't remember this happening</br></br>  <br>Holy shit even the anime explained all this. How can people still be this dumb?</br>  Haha nice thread Gilfags!<br><br>But can Gil kill Madara Uchiha?<br><br>And Iâm referring to Rinne Tensei Madara Uchiha with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikidou paths ability) equipped with his Gunbai and control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, a complete Susanoâo, with Hashirama Senjuâs DNA implanted in his chest so he can perform Mokuton kekkei genkai and yin-yang release ninjutsu as well as being extremely skilled in taijutsu and bukijutsu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So you're too dumb to even follow an anime as simply as FSN? I feel sorry for you.<br>They talk about how effective enkidu is against berserker because of his divinity.</br></br>  lolu  <br>That was when he was completely out of mana.<br><br>They only restrained Berserker because he was a god.</br></br></br>  <br> No capitals aside from OP, bad punctuation, overall crap grammar <br> thinks he has the right to call things cancerous </br></br>  <br>Let's not forget the asspull that is NLBW.</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah. That episodes was probably uhmmm 6 months ago at least? Yeah I think that might be the reason I don't remember one exact sentence. Holy fuck you're retarded if you think people can quote 6 months old episodes</br></br>  <br> Let's not forget the asspull that is NLBW. <br><br>What asspull?</br></br></br>  <br> you're retarded if you think people can quote 6 months old episodes <br>I can quote VNs that are older than a year.</br></br>  <br><br>That's not me though</br></br>  <br>i can quote evangelion in it's entirety<br><br>back to reddit kiddo</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm autistic! Look at me!<br><br>Yeah that's not a thing to be proud of</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou used an ability from a weapon that never experienced it. That's an asspull.</br>  <br> So you're too dumb to even follow an anime as simply as FSN? <br>I know right? F/SN has some of the most blatant exposition (not necessarily a bad thing) of just about any series that I have read or watched. You literally have to be retarded not to understand 90% of the mechanics of this series.</br></br>  <br> Yeah that's not a thing to be proud of <br>I think having halfway decent memory &amp; attention span is better than nothing though. In other words, it's better than what you've demonstrated.</br></br>  <br>Not this guy. Everyone keeps repeating this but that's bullshit to me. The chains are still a fucking NP. Gil said they're even more effective against divinity, not that they're shit without any. To begin with, pretty sure we never saw any non divinity that got restrained by enkidu and destroyed it. It has been already explained why he didn't get to use it against UBW.</br>  <br> pretty sure we never saw any non divinity that got restrained by enkidu and destroyed it <br>Gil doesn't frequently use Enkidu on non-divines. It's nothing more than a strong chain against people with no divinity.</br></br>  <br>Why he didn't use it against lancelot then?<br><br> It has been already explained why he didn't get to use it against UBW. <br><br>Mind to explain?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  That episodes was probably uhmmm 6 months ago at least <br>God damn, I thought I was just going to come here for one discussion. Why didn't someone warn me?</br></br>  <br> The anime clearly establishes that servants are much more powerful than any human. <br><br>Unless they're our beloved MC, who can for some reason see Rider's nail coming and block it, then fight a little with her, blocking more of her attacks, even though she's supposed to be 30 times faster than a human... <br><br>And then she backs off when Rin arrives? Oh they can kill individual magi but two at the same time?! Oh no run for the hills!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still a NP. It has never been confirmed if servants without divinity could break it. Without using their own NP that is.</br>  <br>It's a "tough chain" to those without divinity. That implies a good whack with a NP should take care of it. Still enough that a human probably won't be able to escape.</br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Just being a NP doesn't mean the weapon is some unbreakable awesome thing.<br><br>Most NP's are just weapons, they just have neat powers, but there not that much better then a regular ass sword.<br><br>Enkidu is just a regular ass chain, but it has anti divine properties.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rider is established to be shit if she doesn't have her horse or a proper master.</br>  <br>That's not how it works. He gains the experience of the user who wielded the weapon.</br>  reminder that due to nanaya blood shiki is as fast as arcueid (4x faster than the fastest servant)<br><br>reminder that shiki can kill servants<br><br>reminder that shiki cannot be restrained with gil's chain because he's a human<br><br>reminder that shiki is the cutest type moon boy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The servants that lost against masters were running low on their mana either because their master was so shit or they did not have a master at all. Servants require their masters as a source of magical power to use prana bursts.</br>  <br>Enkidu is his second most important treasure behind EA retard, of course he's not gonna use it on anyone, just like the latter.<br><br>Same for Shirou, he didn't have the time nor the will to use it in UBW, and he decided EA would be much more adapted to stop him at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>  Damn, no more argument, guess I'll tell him to fuck off </br>  <br>It's more like Gil forgot half the fighting skill he showed in Fate and somehow forgot that he have armor.<br><br> In the VN he wins because he an swordspam much faster than gil forcing them into a 1v1 <br><br>Though i don't remember them swordspamming in the VN, this doesn't make sense why don't Shirou just swordspam him to death if he can negate his GoB? why risk going into melee?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No he doesn't it has always been the experience the weapon has accumulated. Him tracing the ability from Hercules himself is a complete asspull.</br>  <br>FUCK OFF YOU AUTISTIC PIECE OF SHIT</br>   gilfags getting completely btfo <br><br>i'm crying</br></br>  <br>Please stay in your Tsukihime threads. This discussions used to be fun but now they are just cancerous.</br>  Why are all the characters so boring? Why do people gush over them so much?  <br>No. A NP sword or lance excels in its point, attacking. A chain is to restrain, so it would be totally fair for it as a NP to be really, really resistant. What was its rank alreadu ? We could theorize it works the same way Heracles's NP does, it can be broken by a NP with a higher rank.</br>  <br>fap material</br>  <br> No he doesn't it has always been the experience the weapon has accumulated <br>Shirou gains the abilities of the person who wielded the weapon, not what the weapon has personally experienced. This is explained multiple times in the story, hence him being able to copy berserker's strength at all.</br></br>  <br> theorize it </br>  <br>Because they aren't? Tell me a characters that are more interesting than them.</br>  <br>He lost his shit and didn't think rationnally, seems fair enough and this kind of situation never hapened, even more when the guy he's fighting is a little shit, compared to servants like Saber.</br>  <br>It's already laid out.<br>God = you ain't getting out of this<br>High tier Demi-god = You ain't getting out of this (unless you're Heracles)<br>Non-divine = You're bound by a tough chain.<br>Human = Probably ain't getting out of it unless you have a broken ability.<br><br>I don't see a Caster breaking through it with muscle, but a well placed spell should do it. Anyone with sufficient muscle should be able to break it or cut it with ease.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tsukihime characters had love poured into them- that's what made even shit tier girls like ciel interesting<br><br>fate threads in post 2011 neo-/a/ are just secondaries baiting each other</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou gains the abilities of the person who wielded the weapon <br>No, that was never the case it was always the experience the weapon accumulated throughout the years. He says it in the novel, the steps to create a weapon.</br></br>  <br>There's a tsukihime thread already up you can go there.</br>  <br>And in those steps, he literally explains how he copies berserkers strength hence him being able to use NLBW. Re-read the scene if this is too hard for you to understand.</br>  <br> give orders to read something instead of showing the screencap where he says this </br>  <br> fate threads in post 2011 neo-/a/ are just secondaries baiting each other <br> mfw I've known of F/SN for years now but only got into it just now through the VN <br>I feel like I missed out on something cool.</br></br></br>  <br>Directly from the novel.<br> Judging the concept of creation, <br> hypothesizing the basic structure, <br> duplicating the composition material, <br> imitating the skill of its making, <br> sympathizing with the experience of its growth, <br> reproducing the accumulated years, <br> excelling every manufacturing process <br><br> reproducing the accumulated years <br><br>Him copying Berserker's strength and using one of Berserker's abilties is an asspull that's my point. Shirou traces swords, he doesn't copy abilities. He only did that there which makes it an asspull, all that has happened before is the weapon moving on its own not him tracing the strength managing it like it happened there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He did the same thing in the Fate route with Sabers other sword.</br>  <br>Have something that's directly from the novel yourself.<br> But-my left arm will definitely reproduce the strength of my enemy. <br> http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-nigh<wbr>t/Update%20362/</wbr> <br><br> Shirou traces swords, he doesn't copy abilities. He only did that there which makes it an asspull, all that has happened before is the weapon moving on its own not him tracing the strength managing it like it happened there. <br>He copies the abilities of the person whose weapons he wields multiple times in the story, such as when he fought Berserker and Gil in Fate, Archer in UBW, Saber Alter in HF when he uses Crane wing, etc. It wasn't something new that came out of nowhere. Shirou's magic has always worked by him reproducing the abilities of the person who used the weapon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I already mentioned that. The sword in Fate moves by itself it is not him doing it nor is he copying abilities or anything.</br>  <br> It has never been confirmed if servants without divinity could break it <br>It's heavily implied. Servants are very super-humanly strong even without NPs. A simple chain won't do much aside from a one second distraction. Enkidu won't do very much against Servants unless they have Divinity like Iskander &amp; Herakles. Even Herakles was able to break free despite that. Enkidu isn't some miracle restraining device.</br></br>  <br>You really didn't. It was basically just like any of the threads that start with "Rin a cute," or a pic of Rider showing her ass, or anything with Sakura, or just about any of the inane waifu shit threads that are still being posted frequently nowadays, but with marginally less Frodo.</br>  <br> The sword in Fate moves by itself it is not him doing it nor is he copying abilities or anything. <br>And that is accomplished by him copying the abilities of the person who wielded the sword and the sword taking control for that reason. Berserker only can't use NLBW because he's berserker. If he were sane, he'd be able to do so, hence why Shirou can use it when he copies his strength.</br></br>  <br> such as when he fought Berserker and Gil in Fate <br>That was the weapon moving by itself as stated there which coincide with one of the manufacturing processes. <br> Archer in UBW <br>The VN literally says that he is absorbing Archer's abilities because they are the same person. It's not him tracing it. <br> Alter in HF when he uses Crane wing <br>That was Archer's? He can use the abilities of weapons yes but he can't copy the abilities of the wielders. <br><br>Remember that the Axe-sword itself never experienced Nine lives so him using it makes no sense.<br><br><br> But-my left arm will definitely reproduce the strength of my enemy. <br> http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-nigh<wbr>t/Update%20362/</wbr> <br>You are linking me the scene that I am calling an asspull because it doesn't fit anything he has done before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's nice to know at least. I'm still kicking myself in terms of buyfagging though. Some of that stuff is still expensive secondhand. And fuck the scalpers for the stuff that I missed by a month.</br>  <br> him copying the abilities of the person who wielded the sword <br>That's never stated in the manufacturing process though. He is copying the experience the WEAPON has accumulated which is different from tracing it from the wielder itself.</br></br>  <br><br>Not at all, the threads now are total shit.<br><br>This thread is a good example, asshurt secondary gilfag doesn't understand how shirou's abilities work even though they are clearly outlined in the VN</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not "even Heracles", as it was a miracle done by THE Heracles that should never have happened.<br><br>And what I'm saying is that it's still a NP chain, and to counter a NP you usually use a NP, that's how it works. Is there any confirmation that the "binding space" shit that locks any command spell or magecraft doesn't works when not used against Divinity ?</br></br></br>   All this people taking seriously some random eroge    this thread   <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br>If you haven't already realized the writing is shit. but fate babies will jump to defend it because, "muh first VN."</br>  <br> fate shitters were mad enough to create these epic le bait images <br><br>Mein sides</br></br></br>    <br>Nasu makes it pretty clear in FSM. Berserker = more dangerous than Excalibur. Non-divine = normal chain.</br>     Fatefags butthurt about their porn picturebook   <br> to counter a NP you usually use a NP, that's how it works <br> that's how it works <br>[citation needed]</br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget that Saber existed? And when he tried Rin immediately used her command seal to force Archer not to hurt Shirou.</br>  <br> That was the weapon moving by itself as stated there which coincide with one of the manufacturing processes.  <br>Which is exactly what happens in HF because he copies the abilities of the wielder of the sword as he does every single time he uses a weapon.<br><br> The VN literally says that he is absorbing Archer's abilities because they are the same person. It's not him tracing it. <br>So what you're saying is that he's copying Archer's abilities.<br><br> but he can't copy the abilities of the wielders <br>He's only able to use crane wing because he copied the abilities of it's wielder. It being Archer's technique shows it isn't a technique Shirou knows, he has to copy it from him. <br><br> You are linking me the scene that I am calling an asspull because it doesn't fit anything he has done before. <br>In other words you've been proven wrong and have no counter argument hence you crying asspull yet again. That whole scene literally re-explains how Shirou's magic works and why he's able to use NLBW using a similar process as he's done through out the whole story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   One shitposter samefagging <br>The IPs haven't even gone up.</br>    <br> that's how it works <br> my assumptions trump the source materials <br>just stop, read the fucking VN</br></br></br>   All of these bait images <br>I wish the anime was never made.</br>  <br>Copying swords=/= Copying abilities<br>When he creates a sword he reproduces the experience and from there the sword moves by itself.<br><br>How many times must I state this before your dumb head can understand?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did you even fucking read the VN ? MOst of the times, a NP was used to counter another NP, because those are dangerous trump cards.</br></br>  <br> anime <br>It would have made no difference. These very pictures are based off scenes, postures &amp; abilities from the VN.</br></br>    <br>Lets not forgot that archer mentions that if he took a step back and didn't fight him fairly he said he would be defeated in another aspect. If that doesn't indicate a battle of ideals then what the fuck does</br>  <br>Normal chain doesn't mean a chain made of paper. It should be able to restrain most of the individuals, and bear a good amount of damage.</br>  <br>and what noble phantasm did saber use to survive gae bolg?</br>  <br>What don't you understand in "most of the times" ?</br>  <br> MOst of the times, a NP was used to counter another NP <br> because those are dangerous trump cards <br>Then clearly a minor inconvenience such as Enkidu to people without Divinity wouldn't even warrant another NP. Not all NPs are strong against everyone.</br></br></br>  <br><br>or kirei survive delusional heartbeat</br></br>  <br>Thread is over<br><br>Fate fanbase show their autism this time<br><br>Everyone go home.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It should be able to restrain most of the individuals, and bear a good amount of damage <br>This is assuming those individuals aren't Servant level or close. Even someone below that level like Shirou wouldn't be heavily inconvenienced.</br></br>  <br> most of the time <br> to counter a NP you usually use a NP, that's how it works <br>moving goalposts. So clearly it being a noble phantasm doesn't make it impossible to counter for someone without divinity</br></br></br>  <br>C'mon anon, they're all fun to read and since there's a lot you can keep on posting them.</br>  <br>In the last fight scene when shirou begins his incantation just before unlimited blade works is cast gil spams swords at shriou in an attempt to stop him but the shield magically appears in front of him allowing him to copy it. Archer who was camping in the treeline was the one who casted it so shriou could get his ubw off.</br>  <br> kirei survive delusional heartbeat <br><br>what?</br></br></br>  <br> Copying swords=/= Copying abilities <br> When he creates a sword he reproduces the experience and from there the sword moves by itself. <br>And you're again completely 100% wrong, as has already been proven multiple times with examples from the story and direct quotes. When Shirou traces a weapon, he reproduces the experience and abilities of its wielder as NLBW yet again reiterates, hence him even being able to stand up to servants at all and not just project some really powerful weapon.<br><br>Hell, Nasu's even talked about how Shirou used NLBW in the complete material. How he projected Berserker's abilities and strength when he used NLBW.<br><br> "The Shooting Hundred Heads". <br>Heroic Spirit Heracles' most trusted Noble Phantasm.<br>It was the bow used to slay the Lernaean Hydra, whose nine heads would always regenerate no matter how many times they were cut off. Afterward, Heracles perfected a method of attacking that emulated the abilities of the bow, that could even be used with great swords. If Heracles' class was Saber, that glorious, exquisite swordplay would have definitely made its return.<br> â¦By the way, what cut down the blackened Berserker in the Sakura route was this secret sword technique, projected from Berserker together with the axe sword.  <br> projected from Berserker </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Normal chain = normal chain.<br>I don't know how much clearer that could be. It's a big problem for Berserker, but a trifle for anyone without divinity. If it's a sliding scale NP, it's probably E~A++.</br></br>  <br>read the fucking VN</br>  Why can Illya summon Heracles? He's a god.<br>Gods are a no-no</br>  <br> He's a god. <br>Not during his lifetime. Herakles ascended when he died. More or less, Herakles was summoned as the same as his time alive + Divinity boost.</br></br>  <br>Not impossible but still hard. Even more when the whole thing is used and twist your members in impossible angles like with Berserker. That should easily work against someone like Saber who is pretty weak by herself. She would clearly need to release the wind that hides her sword like she did against Assassin.</br>  <br>How the fuck am I wrong? It's 100% an asspull because his powers didn't work like that until that moment.<br>When he reproduces the experience of the weapon is based on what the weapon experienced not the wielder. Him being able to copy abilities from the owner itself is fucking bullshit because the Axe sword never experienced NL. It's an asspull and all you are bringing to back your claims is the scene itself which isn't the fucking point or quotes from Nasu after the fact.</br></br>  <br> Even more when the whole thing is used and twist your members in impossible angles like with Berserker. That should easily work against someone like Saber who is pretty weak by herself. She would clearly need to release the wind that hides her sword like she did against Assassin. <br>prana burst could probably break it</br></br>  <br> Saber who is pretty weak by herself <br> Saber <br>At minimum, Saber's Strength is B-Ranked.</br></br></br>  <br>Heracles only became a god after he was cremated after death. His mortality burned away then and was rewarded for his deeds in life to become a god proper, but during life he was a Demigod.</br>  <br>It's not going to move anything anywhere. It's just a normal chain. And Saber is always using prana burst at all times unless she specifically turns it off.</br>  <br>Explain the fucking shit you autist</br>  <br> King arthur summoned in japan is stronger than Dracula summoned in romania by a veteran master </br>  <br>Stats don't really mean shit.<br><br>I mean they do but in the end it's just like DBZ powerlevels</br></br></br>  <br>Rider was only shit because her master was Shinji, who if I remember didn't even have proper magic circuits.</br>  <br>Bottom part of http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-night<wbr>/Update%20361/</wbr></br>  <br>Are these bait images the most notable OC to come out of UBW? I mean, the UBW threads didn't have even close to the output of the Zero threads, and what little OC was made was just so people could call each other out in new ways for posting bait.</br>  <br> How the fuck am I wrong? <br>You've been given the explanation multiple times, from the scene itself, other parts of the story even before that scene, and even now from what the author himself has stated in regards to the ability and how Shirou used NLBW. At this point, you saying things like "because his powers didn't work like that until that moment" is just you putting your fingers in your ears to ignore all the counter evidence presented before you, hence why all you can do is cry asspull in the face of all this evidence.</br></br>  <br>It's only due to Rin &amp; Sakura's abilities as Masters. In NPs &amp; abilities, Dracula in Romania is easily one of the strongest in Apocrypha.</br>  <br> Shinji, who if I remember didn't even have magic circuits. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br>Vlad in Romania is roughly equal with Karna.

Something cool like that. <br>I think most of all I'd want to hold hands with her though, it sounds pretty gay, but I think she'd be too aware of how cold she is being dead and all, it'd just be nice to hold her hand to show that I don't really care how cold she is.</br></br>  <br><br> I think most of all I'd want to hold hands with her </br></br>  <br>I'd be with Zombina too, but I'd necromancer and have her do the thriller dance with a bunch of my thralls.</br>  <br>Pretty sure most spiders dont do that.</br>  <br>Maybe he's a grower?</br>  <br>A long walk with Cerea, in a park or country side. Some weapons training for most of the morning , midday pick nick with salad carrot sandwiches, and some sugar cubes or ice cream for a sweet treat for my lovely lady.

I ask as I clean some dust off of my suit. I look at myself in the mirror, a black suit. Simple, fancy enough, she always let me know she loved that sort of costume, I couldn't disappoint her on this special day of all days. <br><br>I lift my head upon hearing her footsteps echo as she made her towards the living room. My heart begins pulsating faster and faster as a drop of sweat trickles down my back. Suddenly, the sound stops, and I close my eyes, turning towards the door.<br><br>"How do I look?" She asks me, her voice soft, with the slightest tremble of anxiousness. I open my eyes, and my heart misses a beat. Lala is standing before me, in the most incredible dress, long, tight on her body, shaped over her unbelievably seductive form, with a slit on the side, allowing her unimaginably sexy leg to be revealed. The obsidian color of the dress, similar to that found in her stunning eyes. A shiver courses through me as I look into her eyes, sensual, beautiful, black coupled with a mild dash of purple make up and a slight pinkish tone of embarrassment underneath on her cheeks. Around her neck was a silken silvery scarf, matching the color of her lengthy, ghastly hair.<br><br>"I take it, your silence is a positive response?" She asks me smiling kindly. I nod with my mouth half open in response. Lala then turns around, prompting me to follow her. I gulp and brace myself for the unforgettable night that will befall me. </br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br><br> Excuse my writefaggotry, I just felt like letting it out. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus, man.</br>  <br> Lala <br><br>Too normal</br></br></br>  <br>So many mistakes.

What the fuck.</br>  <br>OH GOD STOP</br>  <br>I think she's pretty cute and serves as a good little sister role for Kurusu. <br>She doesn't appear in that many scenes later on anyway, mostly in the background.</br></br>  <br>Just type in Monster musume doujin, you'll find it on pretty much any site from there.</br>  <br>I know that's not Miia but I want her face covered with my cum</br>  <br>Why you gotta bully mang ?</br>  <br>what's that black thing</br>  <br>Ice cream.</br>  <br>Duck</br>  <br><br>Why would you crop out the best part of that page, with the arms flailing wildly around only to wind up with the phone upside down?</br></br>  <br>That's Officer Louis Mash-<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br>  <br> She doesn't appear in that many scenes later on anyway, mostly in the background. <br>Wait, seriously?</br></br>  <br><br>The thong connects to two straps, each of which goes under/around each pedipalp.</br></br>  <br>Well she does pop up every now and then for a few frames in the manga, and has one or two chapters dedicated to her after, but mostly she's in the background doing other shit, like interacting with kids or chickens on the farm chapter. <br>I am probably wrong anyway considering I don't pay that much attention to her compared to the other girls.</br></br>  <br>speaking of , when is the next one of those dooujin conventions?</br>  <br>If you're right, then it's a shame. She's really great</br>  <br>I doubt it, so don't worry.</br>  Can we all agree that Cerea has the most wifey personality?  Their First Session - Pt. 1<br>http://pastebin.com/788H2fJ5<br><br>Their First Session - Pt. 2 Preview<br>http://pastebin.com/urfzhPjw</br></br></br></br>  <br>And the most motherly. She would be an amazing mom.</br>  <br>Now that I think about it, I can't really see how any of the girls are that wifey like.<br>Cerea has the right mindset though, even if it's in her own way because of her culture.<br>Rachnee is the most mature of them all but I don't think she's mother material.<br>If only Suu could make food then she'd be a pretty good wife.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes the sexiest.</br>  <br> If only Suu could make food then she'd be a pretty good wife <br><br>She's literally a potato brain</br></br></br>  <br><br>I assumed a heavily-shadowed Lala just before dropping her head.</br></br>  <br>isn't this more suited for /jp/ though?</br>  <br>I assumed this at first, but look the eyes.</br>  <br>Kids spills water on themselves<br>CPS intensifies</br></br>  Someone post unedited swimsuit rachnee  <br>Hence why I said if only. She did get smarter when absorbing mineral water though. <br><br>Yeah that would be complicated.</br></br></br>  What is the new season even about?<br><br>Why are those girls from season two suddenly in prison but in the next episode, free?<br><br>what the fuck is going on</br></br></br></br>  who cares, its the same edgy as fuck villains that wanna destroy the planet for no reason every season im tired of this shit.  <br> What is the new season even about? <br>Idols vs Vocaloids</br></br>  <br> Why are those girls from season two suddenly in prison but in the next episode, free? <br>Three months passed.</br></br>  Everything is explained in the first two episodes.<br>Did you even pay attention?</br>  <br> Watching Symphogear for the overarching plot <br>You're doing it wrong.</br></br>  I still can't bring myself to watch the second episode.<br><br>It can't possibly be as good as the opening scene, so I think I'd rather not watch it and instead live with a platonic idea of what could've been instead.</br></br>  <br>Them chrises.</br>  <br>How about you watch the show?<br><br><br>You have serious issues.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love thoses Zembus.</br>  <br><br>The new season is about beef stroganoff.</br></br>  <br>But you'll be missing out on Chris and Tsubasa transformations and songs.</br>    I think I forgot to take my pills.<br>Or was it because I took pills?<br>Either way I'm not sure what just happened to my brain.<br>Something, something, pills stroganoff.</br></br></br>  Chris is so petite, why are her breasts so dis-proportionally huge?  <br>Shortstack, maybe.</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, you'll also miss </br></br>  <br> oppai loli </br>  <br>At least Ver was an actual villain. The new bitch just wants to kill everything because she has daddy issues and will be redeemed at the end of the season regardless of how many atrocities she committed.</br>  <br><br>All the girls are really short.<br>Even Maria, who's the tallest is only 170cm.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but.</br>  How many more concubines will Hibiki acquire for her harem this season?  <br>New villain just looks like she has daddy issues that will be resolved when Hibiki hugs her or whatever. Although I suspect the dolls will overthrow Carol.</br>  <br>Watch it nigga. Second episode is just as good and the third one has a wondrously surreal song about beeg stroganoff.</br>  <br>Gaijin genes</br>  <br>Hibiki:<br> We're all humans and we all want to protect ourselves from the Noise, instead of fighting each other we should talk things out because we can understand each other. <br>Tsubasa:<br> I'm a sword who shouldn't feel emotions and my only value is how well I can kill the enemy. <br>Chris:<br> In order to end war you should stomp the will to fight out of anybody who wants to fight.  <br>Maria:<br> The ends justify the means <br>Kirika:<br> I don't want to disappear forever, and if I have to then I want to leave behind a world that remembers who I am. <br>Shirabe:<br> Wanting to help people for selfless reasons is hypocritical. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So far the villains this season really piss me off. At least FIS did not kill dozens of people in the first two episodes.</br>  <br>FIS confirmed superior hero squad.</br>  <br>I want SoL of the FIS girls and Maria being a loving onee-chan.</br>  <br> Maria: <br> The ends justify the means <br>She clearly didn't think that way else she wouldn't have been so hesitant at everyhing she did in G.</br></br></br>  <br> Then that's bad writing. She's a person with thoughts and feelings, not a drooling retarded who doesn't have a semblance of common sense, empathy or ability to learn. That's just a shit character. <br>Well, when a person does stupid things and it never has negative consequences they tend to think they are doing things right. Which is what Hibiki is going through right now.</br></br>  <br>Seems generally pretty accurate. No complaints here. <br><br>However Kirika's isn't a bad thing, and Maria's isn't either, the ends to justify the means sometimes when the 'end' is literally the fate of the world. It just so happens that she was in a bad position and didn't have much luck in her draws.<br><br>In fact, all of these ideals have weaknesses and strengths so I wouldn't say that any of them got 'proved' wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsubasa: <br> &gt;I'm a sword who shouldn't feel emotions and my only value is how well I can kill the enemy. <br><br>No wonder I can't stand her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In S1 her pacifism is treated as a personality trait and nothing more, it never becomes a point of conflict for her. Chris words never made Hibiki falter like Shirabe's did. She never questioned her own pacifist ideals, even if at the time she was less radical about them and would still be willing to fist a girl or two.<br><br>S1 was all about Hibiki finding a reason why she fights. S2 has Hibiki finding a conflict in her ideals. S3 will be Hibiki being forced to deal with this conflict.</br></br></br>  Genjuro should just take Gungnir away from Hibiki. Carrying it around without being able to use it endangers her and everyone around her.  <br> OP starts thread with best girl <br>Sweet.</br></br>  <br>That's the ideal that she tried to adopt, and it didn't go well.<br><br>It was the way that they went about it that was retarded, Kirika was willing to stick with a homicidal maniac to the bitter end and so was Maria. It turns out that when you openly associate yourself with terrorists then people are gonna not want to listen to what you have to say.</br></br></br>  Pls stop. Just accept the fact that G skipped important parts of Bikkie's character and delivered asspulled manly girl without any developement. GX is here to fix this shit and deal with her problems.  <br> &gt;It was the way that they went about it that was retarded, Kirika was willing to stick with a homicidal maniac to the bitter end and so was Maria. It turns out that when you openly associate yourself with terrorists then people are gonna not want to listen to what you have to say. <br>Yes, but honestly in their positions they didn't see any other alternative, and they did learn and improve their stances later on. Biki is probably the most inflexible.</br></br>  <br> Maria makes smart and level headed decisions while saving people without her gear <br> Tries talking sense into Hibiki <br> Kirika saves Chris at the cost of hurting herself <br> DMJii team fights and escapes in the smartest and most efficient way possible  <br> Hibiki has an existential crisis because she nicked her finger on a knife <br>Someone punch her in the stomach. Please.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> S1 was all about Hibiki finding a reason why she fights. S2 has Hibiki finding a conflict in her ideals. S3 will be Hibiki being forced to deal with this conflict. <br>Why S2 feels so incomplete?<br>In this last discussions it always appear to be the one that fuck everything.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the point I'm making, Hibiki is the only who who has never had to seriously reconsider her ideals and improve them. Now it's finally her turn.</br>  <br> when a person does stupid things and it never has negative consequences <br>You mean outside of the hundreds of civilians who have died in the process?</br></br>  <br>I think everybody agrees G was a mess in terms of writing. I don't think it fucked everything though. I still found it extremely enjoyable and the plot in GX seems promising despite the setbacks in G.</br>  <br> &gt;That's the point I'm making, Hibiki is the only who who has never had to seriously reconsider her ideals and improve them. Now it's finally her turn. <br>Oh, you said something like 'she was the only one that wasn't proved wrong'<br>which to me implies that everyone else's ideal Was wrong and hibiki's was right - or at least not debunked as of yet.</br></br></br>  <br>see<br>128308818<br>There's already a way.</br></br></br>   Maria watching Tsubasa intently to make sure she doesn't try to yuusha herself off the plane   <br><br>The problem is that she just waltzed on through everything without any real consequences up until now because her friends picked up the slack or the finales were a string of super asspulls. She's had no consequences because of a contrived series of events and now in the final season the main character is just now starting to be treated like a real person and not a cardboard cutout that spouts one liners about wanting to help people.</br></br>  <br> Maria wants to flirt in their private jet but Tsubasa is too preoccupied with SAKIMORI to notice </br>  <br>The way they were going about their ideals was wrong though; Tsubasa had turned herself into an emotionless machine, Chris was trying to stop war using Noise which only made people angrier, and FIS associated themselves with a lunatic who shockingly turned out to not have the world's best interests at heart.<br><br>After getting their development they found a way to modify their ideals for the better. Hibiki never had to do that. Nobody is arguing that what Hibiki is doing is smart, but the same is obviously going to happen for Hibiki, but you can't make a beef stroganoff without breaking a few Symphobird eggs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Should have actually quoted that properly.</br></br>  <br> You mean outside of the hundreds of civilians who have died in the process? <br>Did Hibiki ever realized she could have stopped it early on?<br>No, she just turn a blind eye to everything happening as something she could nothing about.<br>Now everything is happening in her face for she to realize how stupid she has been, let's wait and see if it has an actual importance or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Tsubasa had turned herself into an emotionless machine <br>Tsubasa was cold but certainly not merciless, especially when Hibiki was acting the way she was.<br><br>But yeah hopefully biki finally owns up to her shit otherwise i'm just going to pretend she doesn't exist and focus on all the other infinitely superior characters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But do those ideals still hold right now?<br>Tsubasa softened up a lot, Chris as well, Maria saw that this doesn't work and probably has changed it, Shirabe might have changed her view as well.</br></br></br>  <br>You can't say nothing bad happened and then follow up with "Except the things that she ignored."<br><br>That's bad writing. Someone obsessed with saving people should have enough empathy that it doesn't take someone being murdered in front of them to elicit a response or drive to do something.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>*Emotionless not merciless</br></br></br>  <br>This. Biki should fist first and ask questions later.</br>  <br>S1 has Hibiki being more interesting as a character. The fault lies mostly in G which started out suggesting Hibiki would have to come to grips with her hypocrisy and ended with the person who questioned her in the first place saying 'you might be a hypocrite but I think you're still doing the right thing' leaving Hibiki exactly where she was when everything began. <br><br>Personally, I don't think it's that bad though. G just works sort of like a bridge between S1 Hibiki and GX Hibiki. G got Hibiki's lack of self confidence going and it only reached its apex in GX.</br></br></br>   Our beloved character whose heart is filled with many worries: of course it's none other than Tachibana Hibiki! Once again this season has our hero trying to save everyone, and because of her disdain for fighting she continues to suffer. Before she can overcome that fear, she clashes with a new problem. This problem is tied to Hibiki's essence; what makes Hibiki Hibiki. Her problem will contrast this season's enemy Carol, so please be sure to pay attention. <br><br> yfw we're going to have muh ideals and muh daddy issues at the same time </br></br>  <br>I think that Tsubasa sees herself as a human wielding a sword rather than a sword itself, and that although she's been given power it's okay to think of herself sometimes.<br><br>Chris also realized that she can use her power to help others and to stomp out threats, rather than stomp out people.<br><br>We aren't completely sure what Maria and Shirabe have learned but they've definitely learned something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She better just accept that her dad is a piece of trash.</br>  Is everyone else enjoying hibiki's alternate universe character?  <br>More like she already has a dad who's a million times better than her biological dad will ever be.</br>  <br>Please no.</br>  I think Tsubasa's character arc this time might be about choosing whether she wants to fully dedicate herself to being a Sakimori or a singer. And whichever side she chooses, we lose.  <br>Yes. Greatly so.</br>  <br> That's bad writing. Someone obsessed with saving people should have enough empathy that it doesn't take someone being murdered in front of them to elicit a response or drive to do something. <br>Says who? You?<br>Human beings are all different.<br>The most stubborn ones tend to ignore everything that makes them think they are wrong.<br>See /a/ as an example, you don't think you are wrong no matter what kind of evidence is provided, and who knows if I'm not the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think there's much of a conflict here. She should try to balance both.</br>  <br>Not him but I don't see how his argument is wrong. Someone who cares about others shouldn't need to think so long and hard about helping others when they have the power to do so.</br>  <br>I can't wait</br>  <br>Someone should really destroy the moon.</br>  <br>Fine pls<br>Noone cares that God is your oneitis</br></br>  <br>And what I said is that she is stubborn enough to ignore the facts that say she is wrong.</br>  <br>Treating one third of the story like a bridge and not a proper segment of the work as a whole is pretty bad.<br><br><br> Read the magazine article <br> Be depressed <br>I'd forgotten about that until this week. Fuck you for reminding me.<br><br><br>This bothers me.<br> I have daddy issues <br> My dad didn't leave me anything  <br>Meanwhile, Genjuro adopts her, trains her, entrusts her with protecting humanity and adopts any girl she chooses to befriend. Honestly the way she treats Genjuro and Miku after all they do for her bothers me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When does Hibiki refuse to use her power to save people then? Even in episode 3 she still tried to save Miku and her classmates.</br>  MadokaxSymphogear crossover when?  <br>What if you want help others so badly you want to help your enemy too?</br>  <br> I don't think there's much of a conflict here <br>That talk with the English producer kind of suggests otherwise though.</br></br>  <br>The fight with fine and the her confrontation with carol. Carol obviously needed to be apprehended, she's too dangerous to leave at large.</br>    <br> Says who? You? <br>Common sense and logic? Did you even read the post or were you just in a hurry to disagree with it to defend the writing? This isn't even a case "you want them to be too logical", it's a case of the characters being defined by X trait except when X trait would actually necessitate some change or introspection. It's incredibly weak writing.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is fucking dense, news at 11.<br>She probably doesn't understand yet that a person doesn't have to be related to you by blood to be your dad.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki never did that though. And no, trying to talk before trying to fight doesn't count as not using her powers. She was just trying to see if she could solve the problem without fighting first.</br>  <br>If she wanted to help Carol she'd fucking transform.</br>  <br> &gt;Hibiki never did that though. And no, trying to talk before trying to fight doesn't count as not using her powers. She was just trying to see if she could solve the problem without fighting first. <br>She didn't even put on her gear. She was asking to die. That counts to me as not using her power when she should.</br></br>  <br>Why are anime girls always so white? All have yogurt skin</br>  <br>Don't make me flip your hat Carol</br>  <br>Chris is 5 feet tall with a B90/W57/H85 body. She's short stack as fuck.</br>  <br> Hibiki is fucking dense <br>There has to be a limit. She runs around preaching that everyone should talk and try to understand each other to solve their problems, then when Miku begs and cries for her to open up and actually lean on her, Hibiki just brushes it off and then bottles it up and collapses later on. It's like they took every ideal and value she had then used them all to contradict one another while slowly mixing in daddy and self worth issues until she barely resembles a person anymore. At this point she does nothing but spout ideals then break down and cry when someone even comes close to opposing her ideas. Hell, a fucking knife almost broke her down in school.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure why I'm arguing with you. I agree that the writing in Symphogear is sub par. I just don't think it hurts the show too much to have this simplistic writing where things happen according to the convenience of the writer. I can't take anybody seriously when they tell me they watch Symphogear for the plot, so I have no place trying to defend that plot.</br>  <br> Man I wish I could crash this plane right now  with no survivors  and make a cool entrance.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138   <br>I didn't even realize we were arguing. And I have no problem with a simplistic or straightforward plot. My issue here is that it bites off a little more and tries to touch on some more complicated themes present in Kaneko's other works (what it means to be a hero, cooperation, opening up to people) and then manages to pull them off well for every character then completely drop the ball when it tries to develop the main character.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br> not the side character of manga and anime <br>LONDON</br></br>  <br> no survivors <br>Ogawa could easily land on the water, carrying both of them on his shoulders.</br></br>  <br>There is just something I love so much about oversized witch hats.</br>  <br>You are saying it is bad because she doesn't act the way you want.<br>She is a stupid and stubborn person that will never acknowledged she is doing something wrong unless you make her see it against her will.</br></br>  <br>you forgot to add Mai-HiME in there too</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON</br>  <br>She tried to put on her gear and it didn't work. That counts to me as not having any power to use at all.</br>  <br> That counts to me as not using her power when she should. <br>That's you personal interpretation then.<br>Remember Carol criticized Hibiki's behavior of saving the world first. If Carol really wanted Hibiki to fight her she should shut her mouth and not cry in the first place. Her plan all went wrong from the very start.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Remember Carol criticized Hibiki's behavior of saving the world first. If Carol really wanted Hibiki to fight her she should shut her mouth and not cry in the first place. Her plan all went wrong from the very start. <br>You don't even know what her plan is yet, how can you say whether or not it is wrong? Also, she had the chance to do whatever she wanted to do with hibiki, she simply chose to leave her be. She could have done anything.</br></br>  <br>I don't think she was exactly planning on being seen crying. She also expected that anyone with half a brain would try and defend themselves when they come under attack. Her only mistake is assuming that Hibiki wouldn't be fucking suicidal.</br>  <br> Get to the point where you can't even pretend to make a real point or form a constructive thought <br> "Well you're just mad because everyone isn't behaving as you want them to." <br>You can fuck right off. You're not even pretending to address what's going on in the show anymore, you're just throwing a bitchfit because you got called an idiot and don't know how else to respond.</br></br></br>    <br><br>So they picked up the idea as well.</br></br>  <br>KANADE AND VER ARE BACK</br>  <br>You don't read past the fist line of a post or what?<br>You haven't respond with arguments, and, just for you to know,telling someone to fuck off isn't an argument.</br></br>  Episode 3 was lower-quality animation-wise and filled with flashbacks because they had to pay Nana a ton of money to put her drawing on the screen.  <br>I think at least her plan of fighting Hibiki had already been ruined by her own hands since episode 1. <br><br><br>Then her another mistake is she knows nothing about Hibiki's personality.<br>Even Garie knew how to handle Hibiki.</br></br></br></br></br>  I don't think Hibiki's situation is bad writting. She's supposed to be insane.  <br> Implying Nana isn't already funding this show. </br>  <br>She probably told Garie to do it. <br> Go drain some people and also antagonize that idiot girl into fighting. </br></br>  <br>This feels good on my penis.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>PLEASE BE IN LONDON</br>  <br>Given that you can't put a sentence together and don't know how commas work I can tell English isn't your forte, but I presented a completely logical and sound argument. How about you go back and read it again then try addressing what I said instead of throwing a tantrum?</br>  <br>It was worth the price.</br>  <br>She did. How to handle it depends on Garie though.</br>  <br>So Hibiki will get her shit together just to find out that her using a Symphogear was part of Carol's plan? I kinda like this idea.</br>  <br><br><br><br>More importantly, the moth noise is there, too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These threads are so fucking bad where did all these retards that can't follow basic plot progression come from.</br></br>  <br>It's literally one post, stop trying to stir up shit</br>  <br>That is a formidable counterargument, I'll admit. A great rebuttal, if you will.</br>  <br>She probably wants to break all of their relics and force them into enough of a corner that they're willing to use Dainsleif. There's no way she didn't intend for Elfnein to give it to them.</br>  <br> her using a Symphogear was part of Carol's plan? <br>Isn't it very obviously after episode 3? Even Genjuro thought it's strange.</br></br>    <br>Maybe she saw Hibiki fix Durandal and figures she can do the same with Dainsleif.</br>  <br>God she's so fucking hot I want her to dom me</br>  I really just want to see Carol turning Bikkie into her dark beast mode servant to fulfill her evil overlord schemes.  <br>Bikkie didn't fixed shit. She activated it. You can't activate fragment without making it into gear or space cancer.</br>  <br>What exactly is this?</br>  <br>I really just want to stick my dick in Carol</br>  <br>Fanart  I hope </br>  <br>I want to rub my dick into her hair and armpits and loli thighs and cum inside her braid. She's a villain, so it's okay to do bad, morally reprehensible things to her right?</br>  Why is the opening not the song that played in episode 1?  TODOROKE  G-BEAT  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>RON<br>DON<br>IF ANIME DIES WE RIOT</br></br></br>  <br>Why was the G opening not the song that played in its first episode?</br>  <br>As do I. Bringing Kanade back as an antagonist just to kill her off again would be a gigantic middle finger from the writers, and somehow 'purifying' her or making her good again and having her rejoin the team would be utter bullshit and horrible writing  even if she is my favorite Gear .</br>  <br>What do you think she's so angry about?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>L O N D O N !<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N<br>!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> even if she is my favorite Gear. <br>Is this a meme now or is it just one guy who feels the need to say this in spoilers several times a thread? It's getting very annoying already.</br></br>  <br>Now I think of it, they only broke Tsubasa and Chris' pendants/converters. The relics in converters are still fine.</br>  <br>They're being played like fiddles by Carol.</br>  Who else loves upgrades. No matter how old I get I still get excited when the good guys upgrade their gear.  <br>Maybe they'll realize it, or at least figure out that they shouldn't just immediately accept help from Elfnein.</br>  <br>Elfnein hasn't really offered them any help, just a fragment of a relic they have no idea how to use.</br>  <br>She was building a weapon for Carol, she's probably got some kind of relevant knowledge installed in her. She'd have to if Carol sent her to them on purpose.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>this I can get behind<br>LONDON!<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe her mission is to NTR Hibiki</br>  <br>Me too.<br>But I think they will just fix the converters. The gear design won't be changed until they use X drive mode.</br></br>  Okay, seriously, where are the lossless rips of Biki's songs? It's been four days. For fuck's sake, the lossless rips for Exterminate are out and that single isn't even supposed to be out for three more days.  <br> not Chris </br>  <br>Because onee san doesn't want to play with her and her dolls, she told her that they could hold a mature and philosophical talk instead.</br>  <br>Her goal was to destroy everything Hibiki holds dear. Her relationship is obviously one of the most important things to her. Just killing Miku wouldn't be enough for Carol.<br> I'm sorry Hibiki, but I've found someone else <br>Would be much more damaging.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're already pretty suspicious of Elfnein with the brainwashing tests they did and all, I don't think they'll just blindly use the Dainsleif like that. They'll probably be put into a corner and forced to fight with the Dainsleif at some point  like episode 7 .</br>  <br>It's on  BUY THE CD </br>  <br>They'll get some upgrade that allows them to fight the new noise and the dolls. They're not even being subtle about it.</br>  <br> episode 7 <br>Nana pretty likes her name, doesn't she?</br></br>  What if Hibiki's dad has found a new wife and is now living happily with his new family?  <br><br><br> braids <br> small body <br> bare legs <br> arm stockings whatever the fuck those are called <br> those shoes </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Hibiki to get dragged down so low that she thinks the only way she can be useful is to jam the shard of Dainsleif into her chest.</br>  <br> arm stockings <br>Gloves you faggot</br></br>  <br>Really? I figured they'd have a special name like everything regarding clothing.</br>  Alright, I've been avoiding Symphogear and its threads for 3 episodes. For the people that loved the first season but hated the second one, how is it so far? Does it live up to its hype, or should I just don't bother and save myself from another season of disappointment?  <br> They'll probably be put into a corner and forced to fight with the Dainsleif at some point   like episode 7 .<br> Genjuro wields it because Hibiki is too scared to do anything <br> Trades his life force to be able to fight with a relic <br> Die taking out 90% of the enemy forces and revealing their weakness <br>It might go down like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's been better than G so far, the villains are better and every girl is better except for Hibiki.<br><br>The threads have been cancerous as fuck though.</br></br></br>  <br>Action sequences are super hype, people are shitposting now because Hibiki's finally getting meaningful development.</br>  <br>Hibiki went full retarded even worse than Ver and it's not even fun.<br>First and second episodes were great though..</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON</br>  <br>Long story short, it's much better.</br>  <br>Well, I really don't care about the threads, but for it to be better than G isn't that hard. Excluding the fight scenes, how would you rate it so far? How's the character development and plot?</br>  <br>Except Hibiki's final character development argument, everything is well done currently.</br>  <br>FIS is much better.<br>Chris-chan cute<br>Tsubasa is dere again<br>Hibiki's going through a rough spot and is currently useless but she's definitely going to get over it soon.<br>New villains are 10/10, everyone wants to bully Carol-chan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>G was looking great for the first three episodes too. Things only went bananas later.</br>  <br>I want Carol to bully Hibiki</br>  <br> everyone wants to bully Carol-chan <br> You guys really like to bully cute loli.</br></br>  <br> Discussing the show is shitposting <br> People are at the fact that she's getting development, not how it's handled <br>You're a fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br>All, the character development that was sidelined in G is now on the frontstage. Hence the name, GX.</br>  <br>Carol please, I'm sure your father would get really heated if he learned you were browsing 18+ imageboards.</br>  <br>I want to bully Carol  with my dick  for making Hibiki so depressed.</br>  <br>I want to bully her with my cock</br>  A lot of conflicting posts so far. Guess I'll wait for episode 4 and see what's everyone's reaction is before I commit then. I'm not sure if I can handle another season of G again.  <br>Nobody can talk about character development 3 episodes in, but the build up has been pretty good.<br>Hibiki issues will finally be addressed, Maria seems a lot more serious and likable than in G and DMJii is going to develop nicely if they continue how they are.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you buddy</br>  <br> A lot of conflicting posts so far. <br>What? No they're not. <br> Opening was hype as fuck <br> New villains are looking good <br> All the girls got better <br> Hibiki currently has her head in her ass, how long it's stuck up her ass will determine how the season goes <br>How hard is that to understand?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only real conflict is about Hibiki, people are massively disagreeing over how her development is being handled.<br><br>Everybody else is universally agreed to be better and Episode 1 somehow managed to top G's Episode 1.</br></br></br>  <br>What if Carol is 400 years old now?</br>  <br>ZUN pls</br>  When is the opening single being released?  <br>It takes one hour to watch the three episodes. It's not going to hurt you or anything, no matter how bad it turns out to be.</br>  <br> Episode 1 somehow managed to top <br>They were surfing on missiles that Chris shot and Hibiki suplexed a rocket. After that, Tsubasa and Maria became barefoot jesus idols in London. There's no mystery as to how it managed to top G.</br></br>  <br>It's already leaked.</br>  <br>Let me put it this way, they managed to take the FIS Trio, who sucked all the fun out of G and turn them into likable characters.<br><br>That alone should convince you that GX is worth picking up.</br></br></br>  <br>It's already out.</br>  <br>I don't remember the date but you can find it on the official GX site. It doesn't matter though cause .</br>  <br>I mean people had no idea how they could possibly top G's first episode and were worried that it couldn't live up to the hype.<br><br>I don't think anybody would've predicted suplexing rockets and blowing up K2</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget the slicing of forest and the second biggest mountain being reduced to the third place.</br>  <br>Just watch the first 7 minutes of episode 1 then judge it by yourself.</br>  <br><br>And yet there's still no FLAC for G-Beat and Little Miracle.</br></br>  <br>I meant conflicting for Hibiki's development, which was great in season 1 but crap in season 2. Hibiki was the main reason why I loved Symphogear.<br><br><br>Making FIS likable wasn't hard. Outside of their respective 'subplots' and the needless drama, they had all the makings of a good character.<br><br><br><br>I did that for season 2. It still hurts, anon. I stuck with the rest of the season hoping it redeems itself. It never did and had retroactively ruined the franchise for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So guys, what are your favorite attacks/attack cards?  <br> FLAC <br>For what fucking purpose?</br></br>  The duet was so fucking disappointing compared the the one last season.  <br> Hibiki was the main reason why I loved Symphogear. <br>Really? I love her when she's fighting and being hot blooded because Aoi Yuuki is a Goddess and pile bunker martial arts make my dick hard, but as far as actual personalities go she's easily my least favorite of the main three.</br></br>  <br> Hibiki was the main reason why I loved Symphogear. <br>Watch the first 7 minutes of episode 1 right now.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, you have shit taste.</br>  <br>Pic related and Megadeth Symphony<br>Also all of Kanade's cards were cool, she had the best card art</br></br>  <br>Heaven's wrath.</br>  <br>Some of us have nice headphones.<br><br><br>I feel bad for Seiten Galaxy Cross. It's not a bad song at all, in fact it's very good, but Fushichou no Flamme was just phenomenal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was worse, but it's not like it's bad, still a great song.</br>  <br> headphones <br>You're killing me.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, people are not in accordance as to what they think of the way they're setting up Hibiki's character in GX. You'll have to see for yourself if you want to make your own mind. I can at least tell you that they're indicating that they're going to go somewhere with her and not just sort of ignore her issues and pretend everything was fine and dandy in the end like G, I just can't guarantee you you'll like it.</br>  <br> Some of us have nice headphones <br><br>Did you miss the part where FLAC is only really worth it for archival purposes. If you can afford such nice headphones to actually be able to spot the difference between FLAC and the mp3 rips I'm sure you can drop the $20 to import the CD yourself</br></br></br>  <br>Just said it doesn't top Fushidori then.</br>  Hey, I have an idea, what if it was Gungnir that gave Hibiki her over the top fighting spirit, and since now it's gone, the psychological effects wore off?  <br>Not him but Hibiki is a miracle of the universe and has always been the greatest thing about Symphogear in general for me. Personality wise and hot-blooded hero wise.</br>    <br>Despite looking awesome, Furinkazan has failed to actually beat anything she hit with it.</br>  Does anyone have that synchrogazer track that has that awesome build up to it, it's played in this scene.  <br> Fushidori </br>  <br> Personality wise <br>I feel the opposite. The way she runs around yelping about her ideals, breaking down when someone tells her "let's hold hands and be friends" isn't the answer to everything, and then doesn't practice what she preaches by ignoring Genuro as a father figure and never really opening up to Miku who wants to help her makes me dislike her "civilian" personality.</br></br>  Fushichou might have arguably been the better song but Galaxy Cross defintely had the best concert scene.  <br>Level 2 version</br>  <br>She the only one of the main 3 with any conflict so , no big surprise they're focusing on her personal issues.</br>  <br>To each their own, I guess. All of the three heroines got great development in season 1. Some had highest peaks than her, but on average, her personality was very likable and coherently development throughout the episodes. Unlike season 2.<br><br><br>I'll hold off until episode 4. I got suckered in by episode 1 from season 2, so I'm going to be a bit more cautious this time around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only attacks that ever actually work in the end are these.<br><br>Also, post your faces when we get the EXTERMINATE attack card</br></br></br>  <br> She the only one of the main 3 with any conflict </br>  <br>Tsubasa had the coolest attacks in Super Heroine Chronicle.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rPX<wbr>OUPNxhXE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Ask and thou shall receive. And in FLAC no less.<br><br>http://a.uguu.se/szibec_Synchrogaze<wbr>rAufwachenForm.flac</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You realize that when I look at her personality as a whole I'm taking into account all of seasons 1 and 2 and what I've seen of season 3, right?</br>  Is it weird if I say that my favorite song right now is  the beef stroganoff song ?  <br>Someone should make a compilation image of all the attack cards, kind of like that thing with biki butts, but more manageable.</br>  <br>No, it just means you have good  taste. </br>  <br>It would be weird if it wasn't.</br>  <br> G-Beat exists <br> Little Miracle Exists <br> Seigi wo Shinjite exists <br><br>Yep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's cute but it's not G Beat.</br>  <br>G- Beef </br>  <br>Fair enough. But I generally discount her 'development' from Season 2, or at least until Season 3 goes and does something with it. If people are still saying her personality is still crap after episode 4, then I'm just going to abandon all hope.</br>  <br> Attack connects right at EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE </br>  <br>I could afford it, yes, but at the same time just because I can doesn't mean I want to. That, and only having a complete set of charasong CDs for G and GX would trigger my autism. I can't seem to find Kanade or Miku's S1 charasongs below ultra-scalped prices anywhere.</br>  <br>What's the name of that phoenix attack she does?</br>    Beyond the blade &gt; G-Beat &gt; Trust Heart   <br>There is one somewhere, although it's incomplete.<br>I thought I had it saved somewhere but I cant' find it right now.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki only looks up to Genuro and doesn't see him as a father figure, and not telling Miku anything is because she doesn't want to burden Miku with her problems. Also, her whole "let's hold hands and be friends" thing work twice with Fine and FIS some no big surprise that she thinks it will work again.</br>  <br>Just watch it for everyone else. Chris, Tsubasa and Genjuro are all still amazing and they even made the FIIS girls awesome this time around.</br>  <br>I was not going to contest anything you said because liking a character is really a matter of preference, but <br><br> and then doesn't practice what she preaches by ignoring Genuro as a father figure <br>What does ignoring Genjuro as a father figure have to do with what Hibiki tries to preach? <br><br>Also, you expect Hibiki to simply forget about her biological father who actually raised until 3 years ago before running away when he couldn't take the pressure simply because Genjuro is a cool and kind master?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soaring Phoenix according to Commie</br>  <br>I will never get tired of this track.</br>  I miss season 1.  <br> and not telling Miku anything is because she doesn't want to burden Miku with her problems <br><br>THIS<br>DOESN'T<br>WORK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki only looks up to Genuro and doesn't see him as a father figure <br> Adopts all the girls <br> Teaches them <br> Protects them <br> Showers them with guidance and unconditional love <br>What do you think a father is?<br><br> and not telling Miku anything is because she doesn't want to burden Miku with her problems <br>She makes a point of telling everyone to get along and solve their problems by talking so they can understand each other, but she refuses to talk to the person that cares about her most. That rubs me the wrong way. I'm not a fan of being a hypocritical idiot who hurts their friends under the guise of selflessness. <br><br> Also, her whole "let's hold hands and be friends" thing work twice with Fine and FIS some no big surprise that she thinks it will work again. <br>And during the process of it working hundreds, if not thousands of innocent people died so Hibiki could act out her hero complex and pat herself on the back for saving someone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh? If you really you should at least watch episode 1. She is still our badass heroine at that moment. Also I think you should judge a show by your own opinion. Even Hibiki began to question herself beliefs by her own self now.</br>  Good ol genjuro.  <br>I wonder how many people here were even watching season 1 when it was airing.</br>  <br>The same thing happened in episode 1 of G, anon. All of them seemed great in the beginning. I've already waited 3 episodes, I can wait 1 more. If nothing else happens or they introduce more drama, I can safely walk away and never look back.</br>  <br>This is actually the only reason keeping me from buying them all as well.</br>  <br> What does ignoring Genjuro as a father figure have to do with what Hibiki tries to preach? <br>That bit was more directed at how she treats Miku. The problem with Genjuro is her going on and on about her dad problems and now complains about her dad not entrusting her with anything when her surrogate father is helping her become a hero to humanity.<br><br> Genjuro is a cool and kind master? <br>Yes, because that's the extent of what he's done for the girls.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are we going to have to wait for the ost for a full version of this?  <br>Because I don't just watch one episode of something. I commit all the way to the end. I did it for G, so if I start GX, I'll probably watch until the final episode, good or bad.</br>  What's Kirika's GX song called?  <br>ã§ããã¹ï¼¤ï¼¥ï¼³ï¼µ</br>  <br>Her flaws are mostly due to her not valuing herself. That has always been Hibiki's thing and it's directly tied to abandonment issues cause by her father and how she was socially ostracized. She just thinks she's worthless and her life would be better used for others and not for herself. Sadly, she inadvertently causes trouble for others doing this even though she has good intentions. <br><br>You find this annoying, I see this and feel like I want to protect her and make her love herself. You hate her personality, I think she's a miracle of the universe. I guess you don't think broken things are moe or perhaps you can't conciliate the ideas of a resolute hero and a broken, fragile little girl in a single character.</br></br></br>  <br> What do you think a father is? <br>You know you use your own perspective to see Genjuro right?<br><br> but she refuses to talk to the person that cares about her most. That rubs me the wrong way.  <br>Give her time ok?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What do you think a father is? <br>Thats not what he is to Hibiki he only guides her and teaches her how to fight that more of a master student relationship.<br><br> she refuses to talk to the person that cares about her most <br>Shocker its easy to fix others problems but your own. Not everyone can talk to those close to them about problems why do you think therapist are useful because its easy to talk to a stranger then to talk to those close to you.<br><br>  thousands of innocent people died so Hibiki could act out her hero complex  <br>What thousand of people? In S1 that was on everyone heads not Hibki's alone and S2 was the same thing but the plot had to go on so everyone look stupid when in most cases they would have stop them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't be so rude, all the girls in this show are broken to some extent, I doubt he'd watch Symphogear if that was his opinion.<br><br>He probably just finds Hibikis specific brand of brokenness to be annoying and frankly he's not alone in thinking that.</br></br></br>  <br> desu death desu <br>th-thanks</br></br>  <br>ãªã¼ãã¼ã­ã«ãµã¤ãºã»ãã«</br>  <br> ãªã¼ãã¼ã­ã«ãµã¤ãºã»ãã« <br> Overkill size hell <br>Sounds like Kirika alright</br></br></br>  So seeing as how the OP song title is always the name of the final attack. What sort of attack will EXTERMINATE be?  <br>You're expecting way too much of her. People are not usually so strong or rational about dealing with their own emotions as you're expecting Bikki to be. Bikki is clearly scared to death of touching the wound in her heart that was left by the events that took place after the Zwei Wing show.</br>  <br>Nana said EXTERMINATE is the song that will destroy the world.<br><br>So probably them cutting the world in half.</br></br></br>  <br>Just rewatched this episode today. Literally still best episode of all Symphogear series. 11, 12 and 13 of S1 are all beyond epic.</br>  <br>I think broken things stop being moe when they start endangering the lives of people around them.</br>  TL pls.  <br> size <br>I think it's meant to be scythe.</br></br>  <br>Talking with the ennemy so they're bored to death.</br>  <br> I guess you don't think broken things are moe or perhaps you can't conciliate the ideas of a resolute hero and a broken, fragile little girl in a single character. <br>Chris is my waifu, so you're way off base. I just don't like martyr complexes and the inherent selfishness that stems from them. Life is something to be valued, and if you can't see how not valuing your own life hurts people who care about you, you need to pull your head out of your ass. This isn't something new or some novel challenge for her. She's been surrounded by people who care, who tell her they care and she even went out of her way to tell Chris to let everyone into her life when she put walls up between herself and everyone. Chris's apprehensiveness was brought about from having done something truly horrible as a result of a misguided effort to save people that resulted in her killing countless people. By comparison, Hibiki is really just being a bitch about everything.<br><br><br> You know you use your own perspective to see Genjuro right? <br>What did I say about him that wasn't shown directly in the show?<br><br> Give her time ok? <br>This has been a problem for her since like episode 3 of season 1. She's had time.<br><br><br> Thats not what he is to Hibiki he only guides her and teaches her how to fight that more of a master student relationship. <br>That doesn't answer my question at all.<br><br> Shocker its easy to fix others problems but your own. <br>And that makes her a giant hypocrite in the worst way.<br><br> What thousand of people? <br>Did you watch the fucking show? How many innocent people died because Hibiki refused to take action and stop the villains? How many people died between episodes 2 and 3 because she didn't try to stop Carol and Garie?<br><br><br> You're expecting way too much of her. <br>I'm expecting her to act like a human to the people around her after 3 seasons of them being there and unconditionally loving and supporting her. "Bad things happened" isn't an excuse for every action ever</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Exterminate is the final attack <br> implying it's not Glorious Break </br></br>  Do you guys still rememeber this?  <br><br>Individual opinions.<br><br>Really, someone should destroy the moon right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, scythe is what it should be.</br></br>  <br>Of course we remember Maria doing the right thing and fighting to protect people.</br>  <br>I'm not going to type out all the words, but Miku asks Biki what happened when they got dispatched the other day because Shiraba and Kirika were hospitalized for an exam. Miku starts asking what kind of 3 person play went down and asking shit like "was it G-Beat play, was it Heart no Zenbu play?" then when Biki tells her to relax she starts singing the Shou Jin Rei summon chant.</br>  <br>That was good. She should have wiped out the team of operators that tried to attack FIS in their hangar too.</br>  <br> What did I say about him that wasn't shown directly in the show? <br>The point is how Bikki thinks about Genjuro, not you.<br><br> This has been a problem for her since like episode 3 of season 1. She's had time. <br>No, she met a new problem now and needs to think it a while by herself. It's not like she won't tell Miku her problem.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That shit was out of nowhere.</br>  <br><br>Maria is the only geah user that has killed other humans with her own hands</br></br>  Why is Hibiki such a cunt to Miku  <br>I was. Symphogear will always be in my top 5 series.<br><br>The show has just enough wackiness in it for me to enjoy it a lot, with many interesting characters. Everyone can find a character they like.<br><br> Kirika a best. Especially her new transformation. Deth deth deth deth. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why she's the best.</br>  <br>They were shooting civilians. Hibiki would have let them die.</br>  <br> The point is how Bikki thinks about Genjuro, not you. <br>Ok. What does Hibiki think a father is?<br><br> No, she met a new problem now and needs to think it a while by herself. It's not like she won't tell Miku her problem. <br>What? She never actually confided in Miku and used her for support like Miku wants her to. She's in the same exact spot she was in at the start of season 1.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw one cm shorter than Maria </br>  <br>White Gugnir saves people, dark Gugnir kills them</br>  <br>Will she ever get her gungnir back?<br><br>Also, how the hell did she transform here again? I thought bikki took maria's gungnir?</br></br></br>  <br>Let's not pretend on a technicality that Chris hasn't killed a lot of people. If I throw a hungry lion into a room with a man, I'm still very much the person that killed him.</br>  <br>That's part of why I like her so much. She's not afraid to dirty her hands to protect others, unlike a certain crybaby hypocrite who has currently lost her singing voice.</br>  <br>That isn't Gungnir, that's Airgetlam. Why do you think she used a sword and not a spear?</br>  <br>They were evil Americans so it's okay.</br>  <br>You can't be serious do you not even look at the screen when you watch things?</br>    <br>She's going to take it back from Hibiki and be awesome with it</br>  <br>The white Geah is Airgetlam, the relic formerly used by Serena. X-Drive seemed to override the fact that it was broken through raw Phonic Gain. If you've been watching GX you'd have seen Maria in a similar white Geah with some sort of chain-whip sword in the OP - this is, again, Airgetlam. Maria will most likely never use Gungnir again, though some fans have theorized she might make an entrance and... forcefully borrow Hibiki's Gungnir fragment to save the day in Episode 4.</br>  <br> They were shooting civilians. Hibiki would have let them die. <br>I don't want to admit it, but you're right.</br></br>  <br> Mariafags are actually this delusional </br>  <br> That doesn't answer my question at all. <br>I did give you a answer you choose to ignore it and that's not what he is to her stop thinking every man in a girls life needs to replace her father. <br><br> And that makes her a giant hypocrite in the worst way. <br>And you miss the whole point of what I said most people are like.<br><br> Did you watch the fucking show? <br>Yea, I watch it a better question is did you with your funny interpretation of Hibiki and Genjuro relationship. All those deaths in 2 and 3 where already done before she got there not her fault and even if she did fight we all now she'll end up like her friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Give me a break, it was like a year ago.<br><br><br>So she was holding her relic this entire time? Didn't she comment that her relic had been shattered similar to what happened to tsubasa/chris's gears this episode?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haven't you heard anon? Maria is the cool and useful one now. She even got SAKIMORI to fall for her.</br>  <br> Ok. What does Hibiki think a father is? <br>How should I know? Unless she tells us her thoughts in the show.<br><br> What? She never actually confided in Miku and used her for support like Miku wants her to. She's in the same exact spot she was in at the start of season 1. <br>This is nonsense. Just because Hibiki hasn't told Miku her problem in episode 3 doesn't mean she won't tell her in later episodes. I really wonder if we watched the same show.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not deluding myself into saying it will happen, I just think it would be really cool if it did.</br>  <br>There's no indication that Airgetlahm was unusable at that point. Maria probably never tried to activate it because she had Gungnir.</br>  <br> shattered similar to what happened to tsubasa/chris's </br>  Maria will be the new Kanade. She'll have to bust biki's ass and take the hit for her.  <br>Well Gungnir probably has to get broken somehow for Carol's plans to move forward, and Hibiki obviously can't even do that so it's up to Maria to job with it in her place. Poor Maria.</br>  <br>Hibki would probably block the bullets</br>  <br>I still can't believe the huge hate-boner they had for US and the NSA for this season. I was wondering how they were going to top each new atrocity the US were committing after each episode and they didn't disappoint.</br>  <br>Maria knows not to underestimate them like Tsubasa and Chris did.</br>  <br>Yes. Cracked might be a better way to phrase it but you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Bullshit. She'd probably try and "talk it out" with the trained killers.</br>  <br> I did give you a answer you choose to ignore it and that's not what he is to her stop thinking every man in a girls life needs to replace her father. <br>No you didn't. I asked you what you think a father is and you said something tangentially related. That's not a fucking answer to the question.<br><br> And you miss the whole point of what I said most people are like. <br>And? What does that have to do with how I view Hibiki? Other people being stupid doesn't make it ok to be stupid.<br><br> before she got there not her fault and even if she did fight we all now she'll end up like her friends. <br>What the fuck are you talking about? Learn English before you start posting here. The people she refused to fight and stop went on to kill loads of civilians. Her not stopping the villains so she could befriend them allowed innocent people to die. Hibiki willingly lets innocent people die to fulfill her ideals about saving people because she's too shortsighted to think about anything that isn't directly in front of her.<br><br><br> How should I know? Unless she tells us her thoughts in the show. <br>Then I'm going by what people generally view as fatherly, and that's what Genjuro does for them.<br><br> This is nonsense <br>Are you joking? Name one time Hibiki has actually talked to her or confided in her. Her not opening up to Miku has been a point of contention from the very beginning that was literally never addressed. <br><br> I really wonder if we watched the same show. <br>Clearly not, because you're assuming things that never actually happened are part of the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could have sworn at one point in G they showed Airgetlam's pendant and it was all but broken in half.</br>  <br>That was at the end after they overloaded it with the XDrive.<br><br>So it being intact now is a retcon.</br></br></br>  <br> Mariafags are this delusional </br>  <br>I thought relics still work when broken in several pieces? That's how Hibiki's original Gungnir was</br>  <br> Then I'm going by what people generally view as fatherly, and that's what Genjuro does for them. <br>Then that's your opinion, not Hibiki's.<br><br> Are you joking? Name one time Hibiki has actually talked to her or confided in her. Her not opening up to Miku has been a point of contention from the very beginning that was literally never addressed.  <br>I guess you need to rewatch S1E8 and S2E10.<br><br> Clearly not, because you're assuming things that never actually happened are part of the story. <br>And you are judging Hibiki's behavior by episode 3 while there are still 10 episodes to go. Yeah, we are watching a different show by different opinions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pendant and relic are different objects.</br>  Hey Gears,<br><br>My name is Carol, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are useless, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day trying to make miracles. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever built your own weapons? I mean, I guess itâs fun trying to save people because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than watching my dad burning to death.<br><br>Donât be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. Iâm pretty much perfect. I was captain of the alchemy team, and starter on my quidditch team. What sports do you play, other than ârunning naked in the streetsâ? <br><br>I also get straight Aâs, and have some banging hot dolls (They just made out; Shit was SO cash). You are all faggots who should just kill yourselves. Thanks for listening.<br><br>Pic Related: Itâs me and my dolls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd pretty good at killing people, when they're her own friends that is.</br>  <br>And look where that got her.</br>  I'm getting pretty tired of all this discussion that goes nowhere. When can we go back to talking about charm points and zenbus?  <br>Kissu hype</br>  <br> No you didn't. <br>Yes I, did stop ignore what I said you ask what a father was I said that isn't what Genjuro is just because you didn't like the answer doesn't mean I didn't answer it.<br><br> And? What does that have to do with how I view Hibiki?  <br>That quote has nothing to do with how you view her it was about talking to Miku how about you learn to read fool.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then that's your opinion, not Hibiki's. <br>Really? How do you know what Hibiki thinks a dad is? How do you know she's not just too narrow-minded and obstinate to realize Genjuro has taken on that role in her life?<br><br> I guess you need to rewatch S1E8 and S2E10. <br>And neither of those actually solved her problem because she still does it. Did you miss episodes 1 and 3 of GX?<br><br> And you are judging Hibiki's behavior by episode 3  <br>Am I judging her behavior almost 30 episodes into the series and looking at her over time instead of just thinking about the endgame where everything will be peachy? Yes, I'm not an idiot like you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Somehow this shitpost is the least worst post in this thread.</br>  <br>Where? She's in a pretty good spot right now.</br>  <br>She's better off than Hibiki right now.</br>  <br>Carol-chan so kawaii</br>  <br>Used good  is fine too. </br>  <br>I'm tire of muh backwards fag's whining.<br>He should just confess that he doesn't like Bikki in the very start.</br></br>  <br> What is a father? <br> A father is not what Genjuro is. <br>That's not a fucking answer you retard.<br><br> it was about talking to Miku how about you learn to read fool. <br>How about you learn to write a coherent sentence in English before you tell people to learn to read? I can't tell if you're 12, an ESLfag or actually just retarded but you're sure as hell not making any sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The way they talked about it in the latest episode of GX implied there's a small shard of the relic contained within the pendant. I believe the phrasing was something along the lines of "Even though the pendant is broken, the relic fragment core is still undamaged," then they said only Ryoko could fix the pendants.<br><br>That said,  raises an excellent point. It's Symphogear. Phonic Gain or some shit.</br></br></br>  So how exactly did she kissed so many peoples so quickly for them to die so close to each others?  <br>I'm tired of idiots willing to swallow any character flaws because she's cute. I wish they'd just say they don't actually care what a character does once they've decided they think they're cute from the start.</br>  Is this how it's going to be for the next 10 weeks?  <br>She kissed all of them at same time.</br>  <br>/a/ threads devolved this far, we're due for a rebound at some point.<br> Episode 7 help us </br></br>  <br>She's pretty. Maybe they just all wanted a smooch.</br>  <br>That depends. How long before Biki gets someone killed then is forced to stop being an idiot?</br>  <br>I'm amazed that he's so dedicated to prove why he's justified in not liking Hibiki's character development, but yeah he's mostly shitting up the thread at this point, even if he can forever hind behind the shield of "but I'm discussing the show". This is one of those cases where I just want to tell him it's just a fucking cartoon made to sell CDs, stop taking it so seriously.</br>  <br>Maybe 2 more weeks. Miku is going to save us.</br>  <br>A healthy dose of RIP AND TEAR will save it all.</br>  Would you feed your memories to Micha?  <br>As a result of her being willing to dirty her hands?

In reality, she's actually batshit crazy, probably more afraid of human connection than the fucking NGEs, and only seems casual because she's made a conscious effort to divorce herself from normal concerns in order to not allow herself to be overwhelmed by petty bullshit. Because of this, she doesn't know how to deal with anything except by ignoring it, and if she can no longer ignore it, she can't cope at all and flies off the deep end.

Goes from smart promising kid to edgy in 1 episode  <br> implying there are more anime without perverted tropes then anime with said trope <br>youmustbenewhere.jpg</br></br>  <br>He kinda has two personalities, nicest guy you will ever meet, and twisted fucking psychopath</br>  <br>Yeah, pretty forgettable guy, there is like one of that guy in every mech anime.</br>  <br>King Crimson.</br>  <br>Light</br>  <br><br>No, here's a little bit more.<br><br>Her history of sexual assault weighs heavily on her mind and contributes to her emotional instability.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Light Yagami.<br><br><br>Johan Liebert</br></br></br></br>  She's a total slob who lacks of social skills. She's uncommonly good at one thing that she loves, however she want to try something new. She wants to change herself to make the one she loves happy. To be a bit useful to him.

Not afraid to abuse connections but works hard regardless. Seems pretty wimpy but is surprisingly good at dealing with stressful or traumatic shit. Falls in love with autism.  <br>The chivalrous harem MC is everywhere, anon.</br>  <br>Yozora.</br>  <br>caska ;^)</br>  Kinda autistic, silent, eyes only on one person, kuudere-ish, heiress of a large companyI think?, distant from almost everyone,  deadly ,  She seems like a bitch, but she's a bro at heart.

Often gets violent with a certain friend. Very embarrassed by her past and sperges out whenever someone brings it up.  <br>  She's uncommonly good at one thing that she loves, however she want to try something new. <br>  She loves what she's good at and people hates her for being talented. <br><br>Sorry but no.</br></br></br></br>  She's noble and the type of person you'd want to confide in.  <br>That hairclip girl from Chuunibullshit.</br>  His catchphrase is the bomb.  <br>Yep.</br>  She has a name and is crazy.  <br>You mean loco.</br>  <br>Let's go for something mildly difficult, I guess.<br>I'd jut go with who I like most, but Hibiki from Symphogear is a bit too easy, and Misha isn't quite from an anime.<br><br>He's a bit of a pervert, but at least he's out in the open about it, unlike some people. Like every guy, he says. He's pretty happy to talk about his interest in say, panties.<br><br>Despite this he does claim interest in one, specific girl, and this other girl that keeps practically climbing all over him, he makes it a pretty big point to tell her to go away. It doesn't work but it's the intentions that count here right?<br><br>He was recently put into less than mundane circumstances, along with a lot of other people but he's taken it in stride, and actually said he prefers whatever state he's in compared to where he was before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Man nigga.</br>  <br><br>Liar, manipulator, kind, intelligent, charismatic, persuasive, physically weak.

On the surface, she seems indifferent to everything, but once you get closer to her you'll see that she is actually very caring and passionate.

I can't really read moon yet but there was no mention of a studio whatsoever.</br>  <br>this</br>  Rolling Girls is cuter though  ITT: people will actually defend the making of another show they've seen 100 times, with the same 3 girls doing slightly different things from last time.<br><br><br>because warping through space and parallel universes is shitty compared to your Kyoanus recycled shows<br><br> only watched ova <br> try and comment on the show <br>Also putting motorbikes in your show just makes the advertising worse.<br><br> implying another fucking kyoani show is going to be any better or worse than the last <br> implying gainex didn't outdo all of their old works with Pleiades. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what a sad fuck you are.</br>  <br>I watched 3 episodes, and it was random cute Magical Girl, it didn't really have anything special. To compare it with Madoka or even TTGL is an insult to those two.<br><br>Now go back to your shit taste lair.</br></br></br>  <br>This show is months from airing and you're already jealous and crying about how you think it'll be more well liked and popular than your show is.<br><br>Insecure much?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they killed the girls off in fourth episode. Would easily top madoka.</br>  <br>I think Pleiades is better understood as part of a campaign to get girls into STEM than as a car commercial.<br><br>All the magic is physics. The show could have been a segment in the reboot of Cosmos with Neil DeGrasse Tyson.<br><br>I'm not saying Subaru wouldn't mind selling some cars.

TTGL was clearly different from the start and all.

It just proves again that /a/ has shit taste.</br></br>  <br><br>Well maybe it wasn't for you then, I thought the space stuff was amazing. Seeing them go further and further every episode was great and the final with the last fragment in a black hole was great.</br></br>  <br>Everybody has shit taste but me.</br>  Who Rin here?  <br> äº¬ã¢ããä½ãã° <br> äº¬ã¢ãå¾ã£ã¦ãã <br> äº¬ã¢ãã ã¨ä¿¡ãã¦ãã <br>Thanks anon but I hadn't read the comments, and I can at least understand that much without the need for translation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So just changing the place where a series takes place is enough for it to be original? So if K-On was to be remade in outer space while maintaining the same plot you would appreciate it? What a shitty opinion anon.</br>  Also, the main reason nobody gives a shit about pleiades is because it's het.  <br> The Bakuon storyboards are fake <br> Kyoani is going to make the VEG anime <br>What I'm supposed to believe?</br></br></br>  How many chapter are translated?<br>I couldn't found up to 16.</br>  Protip: kyoanus ain't going to animate bakuon, the manga actually has some action.  <br>most will go for sex hair</br>  <br><br>You really should relax anon. I liked HnP, but trying to force it on people who probably won't like it, on top of shitting on a show that isn't even out yet is completely retarded. <br>HnP is just a straight magical girls show and it's good at what it does, but not everyone like that genre.</br></br></br>   One person posts b8 <br> Entire thread is thrown off track <br> No one talking about cute girls or motorcycles <br>As expected of a Kyoani thread. Also, the article doesn't even confirm that they're making this, people in the comments are just speculating that they'll be behind the adaptation.<br><br><br>Sex hair is best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying KyoAni can't animate whatever they want. <br>And honestly if you think Baku-On had hard action scenes outside of the racing chapter then you're a shitposter who hasn't read the manga.</br></br>  <br><br>Onsa is fine too.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>The comparison with Madoka is apt inasmuch as Pleiades is a show which uses a mahou shoujo settai to tell a story which is unfamiliar to the genre. Madoka is about young girl's grief. Pleiades is about a young girl's casual encounters with science.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sex hair <br> :&gt; <br>  some /ss/ action <br>Best girl confirmed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>TTGL wasn't different at the start, it had nothing that made me want to keep going past episode 2. And I'll never watch it knowing how stupidly over the top it goes without a good enough explanation. At least Pleiades will explain the laws of physics, before they breaks those laws with magic.<br><br>It just bothers me that people shit on Pleaides for being a 'car commercial' without trying it, but will love any Kyoani show, no matter how recycled it is.</br></br></br>  Will this be like a good version of Rolling Girls?  <br>I'd prefer an anime about the Top Gear crew roadtripping Japan, meeting all kinds of strange anime shit along the way.</br>  <br>But people shit on HnP because it is uninspiring. It's a rehash of an old formula that /a/ doesn't really like outside of few notable exceptions. On the other hand /a/ loves SoLs and guess what KyoAni is great at? Many people really wanted a Gainax revival with HnP but they are still dead and they should be for their uninspiring rehashes.</br>  <br> It just bothers me that people shit on Pleaides for being a 'car commercial' without trying it, but will love any Kyoani show, no matter how recycled it is. <br><br>And you're doing the same thing with a show that isn't even out and might not even be done by Kyoani.<br><br>Just fuck off, nobody likes a hypocrite</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>was riding motorcycles actually relevant in Rolling Girls?</br>  <br>We've already established that this is the standard mode of discourse. Maybe you're the one who should bow out.</br>  <br>I have watched plenty of Kyoani shows to know what he makes is generally shit. I already stated that I was specifically not talking about this show, but Kyoani in general.</br>  <br>It's still shit</br>  <br>Sexhair is sex, but Rin is the cutest.</br>  <br>I heard that the Kyoani storyboard image for this was fake, but where was that confirmed?</br>  <br>Please don't shitpost using HnP.</br>  <br>Funnily enough, that was what HnP inspired me: boredom. It was the moeblob girls doing magical things while not defending against a big bad guys who somehow outsmarts them everytime. <br>I won't tell you TTGL is a super great anime, because it clearly went off tracks after the stupid as fuck timeskip, but it was a very fun ride from episode 1 to Genome's defeat. And they did some explanation in TTGL too. Just a little late tho.<br><br><br>Madoka is about young girls trapped by the cruelty of a world that is beyond them, and their desperate struggle against fate itself. It used magic in a very unique way: the "once you go black, you can never go back" way. Every element of PMMM served to maintain a carefully thought-out vicious circle with no laws whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This thread isn't even about KyoAni shitposter-kun. KyoAni aren't going to animate this. Chances are it's either Satelight or Dogakobo.<br>And on the topic of KyoAni they didn't do a single bad show and they have sold more BD copies than your favorite studio ever will (Unless you're a Sunrise and Gainax fag at the same and then you're just pure cancer).</br></br>  When will get an anime about cute girls starting a kart racing team and working their way to F1 like Capeta but all girls?  <br> K-on on motorcycles <br>Rolling girls S2?</br></br>  <br>well they used them to get from A to B</br>  <br> KyoAni aren't going to animate this. <br>What makes you think that?<br>There have been rumors going on for a while now that Kyoani is going to anime this, before the anime adaptation was even announced.<br><br>Aren't they the most likely studio to anime this based on the information we have?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> My problem is with /a/ who hops on the kyoanus bus <br><br>God, kill yourself faggot. <br>You're talking as if you have the right to tell other people what they have to like or talk about.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   inb4 a bunch of weebs crash and die on their ninja 300s <br><br>Educate yourself on motorcycle safety before making the decision to buy a bike. MSF courses are fun and cheap!<br><br>-love /o/</br></br></br></br>  <br>The 'rumors' were largely jokes because of the tank covers resembling K-on's.</br>  Have some delicious fake storyboards.<br> Reminder that the key to kyoani magic is scheduling and not budget. </br>  <br>Because something like Bakuon doesn't require a full staff to not do anything but work on it for more than 5 months in a row. And their next anime required that from the guys and gals in AnimeDo. So yeah I'm ruling KyoAni out of it because they really can't do multiple projects at the same time.</br>  KyoAni found a way yet again  <br>Kyoani can't animate something this lewd.</br>  <br>Obviously the stakes in PMMM are higher than they are in HnP. Once you get past that, they are really very similar shows. They each have a similarly unified design and thorough execution.</br>  Last shitpost, sorry for the derail.<br><br>Pleaides was an extremely fun ride from the start, but I supposed you have to be into the genre first to be able to really get into it. Mecha has never been my thing and any 'explanation' of various parts in Gurran Laggan just sound ridiculous and make me not want to watch it.<br><br>OP started with Kyoani, I'll shitpost about Kyoani if I want, but I did assume they would make it.  I hope Godakobo doesn't pick this up. <br>And are you implying that sales means everything? The popularity just means that it's target audience is big and that it hits it's target audience. Kyoani doesn't take chances and instead just remakes the same show with cute girls doing _blank_ things because they know it will sell time and time again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've already animated the lewdest thing ever.<br>They can do that for sure.</br></br>  <br>God I hope you actually rot in hell for using a cite show like HnP for shitposting.<br><br>What's full nudity in Amagi Brilliant Park?</br></br></br>  If the first season covers the first 3 volumes then we won't get to see Azusa 2.0  <br> There will be people who will complain about K-On sameface when Bakuon airs if it is done by KyoAni. </br>  Lewdest show since Amagi tbh  <br><br>Jesus Christ, look at that Faggot.</br></br>    <br>Blame kyoani for using key looking faces since then.</br>    <br>What the fuck disgusting.</br>  <br>They really don't use Key eyes and faces though. The face started with K-On and spread to Haruhi and then the rest of their shows until Hyouka/Hibike.</br>  <br> moeshit <br/></br>  <br>sex hair thinks its her own drool, suzuki's fanboyism infects her, hence </br>  Favorite girl?  <br>epic</br>  <br> The face started with K-On and spread to Haruhi and then the rest of their shows until Hyouka/Hibike. <br>This just shows how much of a newfag you are.<br>K-On aired years after Haruhi.<br>I'm a kyoani fag myself, so I'm not trying to shit on them, but they did start with "moe" faces with Key adaptations. They have been making them less retarded as the years go by though, and thankfully, since the old style didn't age well in my opinion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it started with Kannagi.</br>  <br>cager detected</br>  <br>The slutty one.</br>  <br>Jeremy Clarkson</br>  <br>The fucking K-On face started with K-On. Their Key adaptations were a 1:1 clones of the VNs. And I'm talking about the late Haruhi not the 06 Haruhi.</br>  <br> Azusa 2.0 <br>Holy shit.</br></br>  <br> Azusa returns <br><br>Thank you Based KyoAni</br></br></br>  Oh fuck, my  wife  is a suzuki fangirl. Pretty much grins like a fucking loon every time she sees a Jimny.<br><br>She's going to go fucking mental for this series, isn't she?</br></br>  <br>Number of people who care about it:</br>  So this is just a K-On parody about motorcycles right?  <br>I want to buy a Suzuki just for Rin!</br>  <br><br>She's pretty much Azusa except she's not very skilled with driving and is afraid of motorcycles but she wants to get better. She's also a bit more awkward.</br></br>  <br>It's like a mixture of K-on and Top Gear with bikes.</br>  DAMN  Does anyone know if it will have my bikefu, the Kawasaki EX250?  <br>So she's not Azusa?</br>  <br>She's still Azusa in the sense that she's an annoying little tryhard.</br>  <br>Female Stig rides a Kawasaki.</br>  <br> except she's not very skilled <br><br>Faker.</br></br></br>    Is Azusa 2.0 bicurious?   Motocycle fun for Fall <br> Hibike S2 for Spring 2016? <br>One can only hope<br><br>Still, lewd motorcycles by Koyani is going to be fun</br></br></br></br>  <br>And the fact that there is yuri baiting between her and Yui2.0</br>  I hope they hire someone to work on animating Ritsu 2.0's sex hair specifically, like they did with Free's water.  <br> Hibike S2 <br>HAHAHAHA no</br></br>    <br>Isn't this series too lewd for Kyoani?</br>  <br>KyoAni wants to. Lantis want to it too. They only need Yamaha to give them the confirmation and the project is a go.</br>  <br> a show that's not out yet is overpraised garbage <br>Nice time travel.</br></br>  <br> &gt;cg bikes <br>Just like they used cg instruments for Hibike, right?</br></br>    are they really confirmed? if so fuck everything no more good threads (ever since the rumor threads have been shit anyway and will get even worse with more kyoanifags and animeonlyfags)  this will probably be the last episode of the first season  <br>But there are no Bakuon threads since Christmas. And the scalnation staled since that time. So yeah shit threads are better than no threads and no scalnation at all.</br>    <br>look at this thread, is already a kyoani thread</br>   there are really people in this thread comparing k-on to bakuon  <br>jesus fucking christ why cant we ever have nice things</br>  <br> there are really people in this thread comparing k-on to bakuon <br>There's a reason for that you retard.</br></br>  <br> People comparing a manga to its parody <br>How dare they. Fucking cunts the bunch of em.</br></br>  There is no mention of KyoAni. I don't see why they would be jumping on this either. They're clearly trying to work with their model. <br><br>KyoAni isn't desperate for money either. The only reason why people are linking them with this is because Bakuon is apparently similar to K-On. That has nothing to do with KyoAni and I don't think they're interested.</br></br>  <br> But there are no Bakuon threads since Christmas. And the scalnation staled since that time. <br><br>not sure if serious</br></br></br>  <br> The only reason why people are linking them with this is because Bakuon is apparently similar to K-On.  <br><br>Its the same stupidity that makes anons say Soranowoto was similar to K-On.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm really serious. I didn't see any Bakuon thread since the Christmas gift that anons gave us. And the scalnations are stalled for a while now on Vol 2 and isn't even localized in France. So yeah any anime traction this gets is a chance for the scalnations to move forward.</br>  <br>I want to believe.<br><br> Reunite the roller girls </br></br></br>  Please no. KyoAni don't animate this shit.  <br> KyoAni <br> loli anime <br>Confirmed for never already.</br></br></br>  <br> KyoAni wants to <br>Bullshit. They want to do something with male staff already, and that's why they're saving their marketing and enthusiasm with these low profile projects.<br>Brace yourself for Free's shota prequel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why haven't we gotten a girls' rhythmic gymnastic TV series recently?<br><br>It's like easy fanservice just like Free!</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, this is a stupid series about a horrible topic, with generic shit girls.<br>I hope they won't get better than DEEN or A-1 for it.</br></br>  <br>Their AniDo project is nearly done though. And no it's not the Free movie either because that one is alredy over. So yeah the main company is doing nothing until next year.</br>  <br>There is L I T E R A L L Y N O T H I N G in this article that confirms it being made by KyoAni. Fuck off.</br>  <br>you too</br>  <br> Not wanting to watch glorious Yamahas and Suzukis in anime <br>Confirmed for a faggot.</br></br>  <br>The stig.</br>  <br>Have fun polluting earth needlessly and causing many accidents, retard.</br>  <br>You wot.<br>Yeah we've been slow recently due to reasons, but we released the rest of volume 2 after the hitches in January and February.<br>We're gonna get 2 chapters out soon-ish, before the third week of August for sure since the TS is moving, after that I don't know. To be frank, I don't have all that much interest or motivation left for this shit, I haven't translated anything related to it since the first few months of 2015 and all I've been doing is cleaning/redrawing/typesetting which are things I 100% do not enjoy. I'll keep going, sure, but I'm still hoping for it to get an official translation so I can move on to other things. Or if someone else wants to pick it up I will gladly throw staff and scans at you, hell maybe some hosting too while we're at it.</br></br></br>  I'm still excited for it, regardless of who's making it. However I'll feel like a traitor unless I at least pretend Honda-chan is best girl.  <br>I love the magical girl genre and I don't think HnP is that good.</br>  <br><br>HnP turned to shit because the shota fetishization crap episode.</br></br>  <br><br>At a glance I thought this was Futachuat first.</br></br>  <br>LEWD</br>  OP YOU LYING FUCK  <br>You mean this http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/374<wbr>23 and this http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/857<wbr>285 ?<br>Latter is better</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>a post this shit actually got over 10 replies</br>  <br>this girl is quite clearly the best</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I might actually have to pick up a kyoani show for once.</br>  NO FUCK YOU KYOANI FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT ITS BEEN 5 YEARS AND THE FUCKING SPIN OFF BY SATELIGHT WAS MORE BORING THAN HYOUKA YOU FUCKING FUCK UPS GOONS  <br>Don't they have a short girl or something?</br>  <br>What does Satelight's latest series have to do with KyoAni at all?<br>KyoAni never made a call.</br></br>  <br> SATELIGHT WAS MORE BORING THAN HYOUKA <br><br>How is this relevant?</br></br></br>  <br>Please, leave Pleiades out of your shitposting.</br>  <br> VEG anime <br>I wish</br></br>  <br>too bad she's horrible at riding a motorcycle</br>  <br>but that's every one of them</br>  <br>Hopefully this will be better and more memorable than The Rolling Girls.</br>  <br> KyoAni <br><br>I died with Amagi and now this?<br>R.I.P</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shouldn't be hard</br>  <br>She's probably staring at the suzuki logo on her ass</br>  <br> The next stop on our road trip is the historic city of Tokyo <br> But isn't that the place we just left? <br> No, that Tokyo had a bunch of ghouls in it. This is a different Tokyo. <br> Well what's so different about this place? <br> I'm not sure, but apparently there are a number of Extra Special Power users there. <br> ... <br> Skip? <br> Skip. <br> Maybe we can get the producers to include a Tokyo with Ravens sometime. <br> Ravens and miniskirts <br><br> But I liked Tokyo ESP... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nothing points to KyoAni <br> not even mentioned <br> just a rumor based on the fact that it's similar to K-On <br> can't even read the thread <br><br>KyoAni isn't dead you stupid faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   you never get a K-ON on motorcycles where they fight villains with their instruments <br><br>KyoAni, if you're out there listening, please make this happen.</br></br>  <br>Died because the anime was great.<br><br>Back to you, retard.</br></br></br>  <br>What are you even saying?

"Cute".</br>  What's wrong with her thighs, though?  <br>My guess is that they are part of a bigger group where they are on the lowest rank (bed warmer), so they are giving the Gakkous to the leaders as a meal ticket to ensure their survival.</br>  Alright /a/, which  Guracho  would you  take out to mexican food and tequila?     <br><br>Miki a slut anon</br></br>  <br><br>Bromance not Yuri, ok.<br><br>This is what I agree with.</br></br></br></br>  Through the power of Christ and a plowshares turned into swords, Megu-nee will protect all the waifus from the zombies even if they bully her.  <br><br>Megu-nee is the real hero<br>Honoraburu sacrifisu</br></br></br>  so cute and pure.

White is more attractive.  Because Japs look ugly as shit.  <br>Did you watch Aku no Hana?</br>  Is it that time again?  They also give anime characters blue/green/purple hair which is not caucasoid or even human for that matter. Perhaps the anime style is a strange amalgamation of aesthetically pleasant traits and it would be foolish to pinpoint some of them to a particular ethnic group while ignoring the others.  <br>this</br>  Japs don't need to stereotype themselves to get the audience to understand that a character is Japanese.  Japs are ugly, whites are not  BUY MY BOOK  <br>There a ton of good looking white and Asian people as much as there are ugly ones.</br>  That is just your point of view.

This happened because unlike every other non-white nation they didn't have the "hurr kill da whytei da whyty bad" mentality, but instead used the approach of learning, and taking inspiration from the european race. This is proof that they are the second best race (Yamato) to whites.<br><br>Therefore they aren't insecure or need to validate themselves aesthetically on anime. They, instead, accept that europeans are more aesthetically and metaphysically pleasing as a race, and find our little characteristics such as red, blond, brown hair and blue, grey, green eyes etc. interesting, and our past artistic background aswell, such in baroque, victorian etc. inspired anime/manga.<br><br>TL;DR: Don't hate and envy those superior to you in whatever area, learn from them, admire them and you will get close to their greatness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>whites don't have eyes that large and noses that small anon, in fact no race or ethnic group does.</br>  <br>why does she look like a shota in a dress?</br>  <br>Are you trying to prove his point?</br>  <br> they aren't insecure or need to validate themselves <br> anime industry is a good representation of Japanese culture </br></br>  <br><br>This. <br><br>'Anime characters are white' is just a perception based on how you view the default person.

Skin colour ranges among Caucasians and Asians are pretty much the same. Asians having smaller eyes is false too. Large eyes are an ideal feature no matter your nationality, same with hair colour that stands out. Blonde and red hair is typically more sought after than black. Although obviously Japanese would be more interested in this because they mostly always have black hair and dying hair is not allowed if you wear a uniform.</br>  <br><br>They look white because they copied disney, and white features are more appealing.

Heres a picture of a typical "moe" style character who's only difference is skin color (and eye color) in return.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;japanese people don't have hair, only white people do! <br><br>Sure that's what I was saying<br><br>Mediocre bait.<br><br> posts fictional anthropoid character that isn't mean as a depiction of a human <br><br>2/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>why did you expect a lower lifeforms to form a logical coherent argument?</br></br>  <br>Thats what youre implying, seeing as how the only way your retarded assumption makes any sense is if hair is such a foreign object to Japan that they can only imagine different colored hair with the help of gaijin.</br>  This is the problem with these kids who grew up in murrica watching TV crap full of negro quotas for actors. <br><br>Can't get over the fact that anime is racially homogeneous.</br></br>  <br> I could have said human instead of humanoid <br><br>way to completely prove my point you fucking idiot. the thing you posted is not human, it's a humanoid. characters that are completely human are not drawn with unnatural skin colors, because it's not a standard of beauty.<br><br>you're all ignoring the main point, which is that larger eyes with folds, narrow upturned noses and lighter colors are far more white than they are asian. the intuitive standard of beauty that japs apply to their anime art much more closely resembles white people than asians, or any other race for that matter.</br></br></br></br></br>  western women don't have the round jaw and face that anime girls have, they're definitely more asian than western  <br>I never lose hope, If they can count to ten, there must be a way to get through their goy brainwash, right?<br><br><br>Read again my post and you'll find your answer, I don't feel like repeating myself.<br><br>Meanwhile enjoy this multiracial, multicultural, nigerian inspired, somalian drama, anime picture.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anime girls <br> round jaw and face <br><br>what the fuck anime are you watching</br></br></br></br>    <br>Watchout, he may post a chibi picture to 420 rek u!</br>  <br>They don't look "white", most white girls have pretty bad manface cases. If anything they look slav-ish or white-asian mixed.</br>  <br>Sharp features = sexy.<br>Round features = cute.<br><br>All moe-driven shows belong to the latter.</br></br></br></br>  <br> most white girls have pretty bad manface cases <br><br>Source: your ass</br></br></br>  <br>not him but I see young women with manface everyday outside<br>maybe you should leave your house more</br></br>  <br>I know you can't generalize White people since they're a very big group, but Nordic and German girls tend to be manfaced.</br>  <br><br>this isn't especially rounded, she has a shape chin and distinct jawline. it's only rounder in the moeblob caricature scenes.</br></br>  <br>Well, maybe YOU should leave your trailer park more...<br><br><br> but Nordic and German girls tend to be manfaced. <br><br>Let me guess, now you'll proceed to tell us your anecdotical evidence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her face isn't triangular though. Only the chin is a bit pointy.</br>  <br>Fuck I was looking for this pic<br>Thanks anon</br></br>  ITT: enraged shitskins trying too hard to escape reality and facts. And I'm not even white, I'm portuguese.  Goddamn my /pol/ folder is mostly about niggers and mudslimes, I should stock up on Japs too.  <br><br>nobody's face is triangular.</br></br>  <br> /pol/ <br>really should have been deleted<br>at least /mlp/ keeps their shit to themselves</br></br></br>  <br>Despite two of the characters in that picture canonically being white, none of them look white. The only thing that makes either of the 2 britbongs look white is the yellow hair, which is like a cheap way of hanging a "look this characters a gaijin" sign on them. You see it all the time, the american always has blond hair blue eyes just to distinguish them. Anime characters don't look like any race on earth. Its just that you keep projecting your self image into the characters, just like you project your pitiful creative capability onto the rest of the world.<br><br><br> 110 degree angle is a white person's nose <br>Not seeing it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad you disgusting subhuman.<br>If you were here for more than a couple months you would know pony niggers are the last to keep their shit to themselves, and since you brought up pony niggers out of nothing and putting them in a good light, I assume you are a pony nigger yourself or you at least sympathize with them, which is almost as bad.</br></br>  anime faces faces simple as fuck, they don't have any real distinctive features unless theres heavy stylization. the reason they have multi-colored hair and eyes is because differentiating between simple faces with a line for a mouth and huge eyes would be hard if they all had brown and black hair.  <br> 110 degree angle is a white person's nose <br><br>you're not even trying now</br></br></br>  Jap teeth are fucking ugly British tier  <br>but they do keep shit to themselves, ever since they got their containment board, and what does /pol/ contain? nothing really , theres no point of keeping it around.</br>  <br>I shall not waste my time on you since your argument now is akin to<br><br> These are just colored lines on a piece of paper, how can that be white people? <br><br> How can an arrangement of molecules and atoms be white people? <br><br><br> every aspect of reality I dislike must be a troll or /pol/ or whatever boogeyman flavor of the month. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /mlp/ <br> keep their shit to themselves <br>Nice try, pony-fag</br></br></br>  <br><br>their features are distinct enough to tell that they look far more white than japanese (specifically the features that distinguish whites from asians, i.e. eyes, nose, hair, sharpness)</br></br>  <br><br>they do, more than pol does anyways</br></br>  White people really are the most conceited.    Alice a cute!<br><br>A CUTE!</br></br>  <br>Good lord. Poor girl.<br><br>Also, why is her nose so red?</br></br></br>   all this buttmad against the master race   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128314964 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128314770 <br> deleted <br>Why though?</br></br></br>  <br> look mam, I can cherrypick <br>For every one character that has a detailed nose, I could post 100 with simple undetailed noses. Ichigo's appearance is not even remotely close to representing the average anime character. Its one of the chief complaints that normies have about anime style actually, other than the huge eyes. Anime noses tend to be ridiculously nondescript.<br><br><br>I guess /pol/ is just a hugbox afterall, despite them talking endlessly about how "red-pilled" they are. You're not even willing entertain the notion that you might be wrong. Whatever, stay stuck in your "redpill" while the rest of the world laughs at you like the bluepilled delusional faggots you are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. <br><br>I used to think Musashi from Vagabond looked White, but then I remembered there were a lot of dudes in Akira Kurosawa movies that looked just like him.</br></br></br>  <br>See? You see the light once you stop being ignorant.</br>  <br>I've always wanted to know how Kirino would look lIke in real life.</br>  <br> orange hair <br>She would look awful. The brown hair would probably look decent.</br></br>  <br> &gt;look mam, I can cherrypick <br><br>it doesn't matter, even when they have simple noses they're never wide and are always pointy, unless the character is supposed to look ugly or old. and they are usually upturned, or at least never downturned. they are clearly more white than they are asian.</br></br></br>  Anime girls are not meant to be white. They have light skin because Japanese people like lighter skin. That is why they often buy skin products that will lighten their skin. This is not Japanese exclusive but also common in Korea and China, though Koreans are known to be a bit more extreme with skin-lightening.<br>Anime girls and boys (especially in moe-blob) usually have very large eyes. However, that is true for most styles of animation, drawing, etc. that appeals to ages under 25. It is stylistic and often considered cute, which makes it more popular and earns more money. There is eye enlargement surgery in japan which has recently become more popular, and circle lenses are often used. These are inspired by anime, and in turn inspire anime.<br>It should be noted that large eyes + small nose occur in most animes and western cartoons. it's not just an anime thing trying to be white, it's just a very popular style. Animations that feature smaller eyes usually have dot eyes or something else that appears "cutesy".<br><br>td;lr: Anime people aren't white, nor are they inspired to be white. It's a stylistic preference that comes from wanting to attain something you don't already have which is common to all humans.</br></br></br></br>  <br> uses slippery slope fallacy <br> gets called on it <br> starts spouting pill memes and calling me /pol/ because it's a boogeyman that'll give him peace of mind <br><br>Here's your reply, I've taken the bait again.</br></br></br></br></br>  How do you know when a character is white? Don't worry, they'll tell you. After all, white people crave attention.  <br> td;lr: Anime people aren't white, nor are they inspired to be white. It's a stylistic preference that comes from white people who already have these features because they like the white aesthetic. <br><br>Fixed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>you don't, because they all look white.</br></br>  <br> slippery slope <br> a fallacy <br> despite proving itself right 100% of the time <br><br>okay</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There is eye enlargement surgery in japan which has recently become more popular, and circle lenses are often used. These are inspired by anime, and in turn inspire anime. <br><br>Or maybe they just realize slanty fucking eyes are ugly as shit?<br>No, they don't go to the surgeon thinking "I want to look like anime so I will get a surgery to make my eyes look like a western's"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice, keep samefagging the thread. Maybe that will give you validation for being a shitskin!</br>  <br>I would be terrified if white people actually looked like nichijou characters. Those features would be nightmare fuel in the 3D world.</br>  <br>In logic and critical thinking, a slippery slope is a logical device, but it is usually known under its fallacious form, in which a person asserts that some event must inevitably follow from another without any rational argument or demonstrable mechanism for the inevitability of the event in question<br><br>âWikipedia</br></br></br>  <br><br>they don't look like elmer fudd either. they're cartoons. but their features look far more white than they do asian, despite the fact they're supposed to be asian characters.</br></br>  <br>No matter how many times you say it, they'll reply.<br><br>They can't accept it, they need to validate themselves being shitskins.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh no, anime actually is a huge inspiration for many teens who are interested in fashion. Circle lenses are easy to get a hold of, and actually don't always look nice because it has to be balanced with the face shape. Giant eyes don't always look good on people. And not everyone has "slanty fucking eyes". I'm beginning to think none of you people have ever visited Japan, or even any of the Southeastern countries.<br><br><br>Not everything has to equal white, you do realize that right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know what it means you twat. I am saying through slight hyperbole that people dismissing it as "fallacious" despite it being very valid just because "lol fallacy" is moronic.</br>  <br> leaves out Walt Disney and Douglas MacArthur's influences </br>  <br> These are inspired by anime, and in turn inspire anime. <br>Do you think everyone in Japan is some fucking otaku cartoon lover, where they get eye surgery to slightly look more like their cartoon character?<br>You are the typical fag asking that one jap student if he watches k-on and kiniro mosaic, to have it end with the jap guy saying he doesn't really follow cartoons but still trying to awkwardly hold the conversation.</br></br></br>  <br>Have I offended you, great whiteman?</br>  <br> Not everything has to equal white, you do realize that right? <br><br> It quacks <br> Its yellow <br> Has yellow feathers <br> Has the shape of a duck <br> Has the feet of a duck <br><br> It's not a duck <br><br>Nice logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   "japanese character" <br> blonde hair <br> japanese name and heritage from hundreds of years <br>Yeah, sure Japan.</br></br></br>  <br>If anime characters really looked white, then they'd be fatter, and the girls would have square jaws. Also, they'd have weird daddy issues.</br>  <br> has a dick <br> is not a man <br>I see the connection now.</br></br></br>  <br> a fallacy is very valid <br><br>Yep, maybe on american TV.</br></br></br>  <br> It's not a duck <br>because its not</br></br>  <br>Most people in Japan watch anime or read manga. It's a very big product that sells worldwide and brings tourism. Of course it's big in Japan. It's like saying people in America don't know NYC if they don't live in it- of course they know an economic powerhouse of the US that is also one of the largest tourist destinations.<br>They don't get eye surgery just to look more like their cartoon character. It does however pitch a style out there that, in a very popular medium, has gained speed amonsgt the people in the country. Please do not exaggerate my words and pick and pull at them while not bringing up any counterarguments yourself.</br></br>  <br>Yeah let's just ignore how it happens to prove itself true over time consistently in all variety of fields. <br><br>Also<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argum<wbr>ent_from_fallacy<br><br>:^)</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where have you been in Japan?</br>  <br>Because Asian-looking characters in anime are supposed to be irredeemably evil villains.</br>  <br>No, you amuse me, keep posting these pictures of fine 2D white females with great scandinavian blonde hair.<br><br><br>I think I might be arguing with people with legitimate authism, these feet are not a duck's.<br><br><br>It's a logical fallacy since Aristoteles had a fucking beard, no matter what you say your reasoning was fallacious and therefore not valid as a rebuttal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anime:<br> "Asians don't have blonde hair or blue eyes! This is unrealistic!" <br> but they're okay with the giant robots and girls who save the world with the power of friendship <br><br>Western animation:<br> "Oh man, Skeeter is so funny-looking with his blue skin! Honk-honk!" <br> "I love the Simpsons! You know it's on TV when you see the yellow skin!" </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least you have good tastes.</br>  <br> lol i has a beerd ure argument is invalid <br><br>wow epic memes bro</br></br></br>   western people are one person with one opinion <br> but Japs aren't all disgusting, slant eyed, war-crime committing perverted yellow rapist fucks! </br>  This also happens on videogames.
