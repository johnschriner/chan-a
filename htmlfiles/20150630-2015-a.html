[ why gilgamesh so unlikable in UBW but had class and honor in zero?  so that turd shirou could look better  <br>Because of angry manjew.</br>  Different writer. You can tell Zero!Gil rubbed on UBW(anime)!Gil because he's like a cartoon villain in the VN.  <br>the grail made him crazy</br>  <br> The anime retconned servants losing their memories of being summoned <br> Gill will remember getting wrecked by Shirou <br> FOREVER </br></br></br>  Gen is a better writer than Nasu.  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br>Gen just kind of wanked him. He served his purpose in the original VN to be an antagonist, but he wasn't really anything major.<br><br>In UBW for instance, from a narrative standpoint, he existed to test Shirou on the answer he got from Archer.</br></br></br>  They at least slightly altered him in the anime to be less retarded like he was in the VN.<br><br>Living among the modern day humans for 10 years pissed him off.</br></br>  Grail Mud.<br>inb4 one half of Nasu's contradictory statement of the moment about how grail mud didn't do anything to them. Doesn't matter, Butcher wrote him accordingly.</br>  <br> Living among the modern day humans for 10 years pissed him off. <br><br>That was in the original novel.</br></br></br>  <br>Gil only showed class in Zero when it involved Rider.</br>  His UBW persona sorta fits the black-and-white justicelord theme. I'm glad that they borrowed some of his characterization from FZ, at least.  <br>Because he's out of character there.</br>  CCC Gil &gt; Everyone else  <br>I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, he was always an arrogant little shit who didn't do anything to earn or deserve the immense power he as given, but he respected Iskander and so went all out against him</br>  <br>Why do people even bother asking when the answer is so obvious?</br>  <br>Because Zero was written by a professional, excellent writer while ubw was written by chuuni teenager in highschool.</br>  <br> edgebutcher <br> professional writer <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that that "professional writer" reveres the shit out of that story done by a chuuni teenager.</br>  <br> class and honor <br><br>Is he the Gilgamesh of our times, /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>I read in a thread that Kotomine and Kirei used to eat Mapo Tofu together and I can only imagine how hilarious the conversations must have been.<br>I wonder if he mentioned anything about the orphan farm keeping girugamesh around. I wonder if Kotomine would drink wine with Girugamesh and talk about mongrels after Kotomine spent an evening poisoning Rin's mind and making her a man hater.<br>We need a OVA or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh was canonically fucking all the women in his entire kingdom and one of the reason why his townspeople called upon the gods to create a clone of him to wreck his shit.</br>  <br> wants Saber badly <br> can't get Saber <br><br>that was in the past m8, It's clear time has warped Gil into some sort of impotent jobber</br></br></br></br>  <br>Grail Mud didn't do shit, turning him into a human made him twisted to match the modern day humans</br>    <br> Kotomine and Kirei <br>Who? Kirei and his dad?</br></br>  <br> Gen is a better writer than Nasu </br>  <br>Well he got the evil goo on him at the end if that war which made him a dick i guess? But in reality its the difference in writing.</br>  <br>Saber is different. She's 'muh country'. I think its amazing she even fucked Shirou/Rin depending on route.<br><br>he went human? what did you read?<br>All servants are grail mud from the start. And its stated that his personality was warped by the muddening.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> professional writer </br></br>  <br>I meant Kiri my bad</br>  <br>Well duh.</br>  <br>I love kinken pics.</br>  <br>It didn't retcon that, Gil has just been there since F/0</br>  <br>The holy grail spilled its spunk all over him and corrupted his soul.</br>  Compared to Zero all of UBW looks like fanfiction.  Compared to UBW all of Zero is actual fanfiction.  Compared to Zero all of UBW looks like fanfiction.  Zero literally is fanfiction.  <br>Episodes 24 and 25 surgically removed any reference to Archer losing his memories and his answer.<br><br>Best fucking retcon the anime could have done.</br></br></br>  Second half of UBW ruined all of Fate for me. Such a badly written piece of shit. Archer is a total shit character now.<br><br>At least Lancer is still based.</br></br>  <br>We still doing the meme where people say the second half of UBW was bad?</br>  <br>People actually believe that anything beyond the premise in Fate is any good?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Well, maybe Heaven's Feel will be good. UBW and Fate were complete shit. Maybe the new meme that Shirou is a good MC will be justified.</br>  <br>If you don't like it, you don't like it. Shirou's a pretty solid character though, don't know what you're moaning on about.</br>  <br>Reveres the shit out of the story, not the shit writing.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit.</br></br>   there is actually one guy preferring UBW over Zero in this thread and defending it   <br>Isn't this also the reason why Shinji exists?</br>  <br>You mean discount Gilgamesh?</br>  <br>Stay mad.</br>  <br> one </br>  <br>Shirou is literally everything wrong about UBW.<br><br>If he died episode one the story would turn out 10 times better.</br></br></br>  Based Gil losing to a Jap ginger was suck BS.  <br>Sorry you can't handle how based he is, anon.</br>  <br>Just reinforcing meme character status right here.</br>  <br>Well you're not really saying why you didn't like him.<br><br>Shit, did you see that bitchin' cardigan he was wearing in the epilogue? You'd have to be some kind of fag to hate the dude.</br></br></br>  <br>But I said why I didn't like him.<br> If he died episode one the story would turn out 10 times better <br>It's adapted from a Visual Novel where the whole story happens from the main characters perspective. It's bound to sacrifice a shitton of quality just for the sake of the protagonist.<br>Also VN protagonists are 99% build for self-insert shit.<br><br>Of course being a VN adaption isn't an excuse. They could have done it better. They just didn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well for 1, FSN, and UBW in particular, is formed around Shirou's character and his development. I mean he's so important in the story he is literally the protagonist, and main antagonist.<br><br>Shirou also is not a self insert. You can't play the game in a way that lets you self insert. When you make choices, they aren't based around what you want to do, but rather are on what Shirou would do in that situation. If you don't understand his character, you get punished.</br></br></br>  Reminder not to be deceived by sunk cost VNfag primaries.<br><br>They made the decision long ago to gorge themselves on an inferior medium, knowing full well that a superior, high budget, high quality better medium version was in the works.<br><br>They traded quality for early access to content. And misery loves company, they will stop at nothing to trick newfriends into making the same mistake they did.<br><br>You should do the following, at the bare minimum<br><br>1. Watch Fate/Zero<br>2. Watch UBW (UFOTABLE)<br>3. Decide to wait out for the end of UBW, or if you really must and cannot contain your autism to win nerdbattles on /a/, you can play the VN<br>4. Ditto for the last, worst, wormroutes like HF.<br><br>There is zero reason to choose an objectively inferior, decade old eroge VN over a far superior, better artstyle, animated, version of it.<br><br>Additionally the other fate releases spoil Fate/Zero -- the best standalone release of the entire fate series. It is idioitic to complain about how it ruins a subpar route like HF, when reading HF/FSN spoils Fate/Zero.<br><br>Fate/Zero is one of the greatest selling anime of all time for good reason. And /a/ will never stop being butthurt over it.<br><br>Additionally, people really overestimate how bad "spoilers" are. It's not like "It's his sled" level spoiler, it's just "ugh, ok that's what they decided to do"<br><br>You're supposed to enjoy the journey, not the destination, in Fate. And the (ufotable) anime is a luxurious limo ride on the main road. The VN is a model T that can travel on the side roads as well.<br><br>Take the nice trip and then circle back onto the dirt path if you really want to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he only shows class and honor to those who he thinks deserve it.</br>  <br>I really don't understand this shit about Shirou being a bad character<br>He's not self-insertable at all, they didn't really sacrifice anything for his character and made it easy to understand why he is the way he is and why he wants to do what he wants to do.<br>Your horrible opinion of the show being better if he wasn't in it is fucking stupid because you can take any protag from any series and put them in his place and it'd be shitty because the story is built around him and his growth throughout the three routes.<br> They could have done it better <br>Unless you give me some examples of what was wrong, then you're just acting like a kid because everything in the adaptation was fucking spot on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they didn't really sacrifice anything for his character <br>Except everything. He is literally bending the whole story just for being the protagonist.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck does that even mean?</br>  <br>How does he "bend" something that's is already about him?</br>  <br> class <br>fedora.jpg</br></br>  <br>You're a fucking idiot.</br>  <br>Fate is badly written so it's kinda the fault of the series being shit in the first place. Shirou beating Gil for example or making Archer look like a whiny cunt. <br><br>Well, you guys are just fucking retarded and will believe the piece of shit show has any quality to it without ever giving a legit reason anyway.</br></br></br>   All these assblasted Gilfags itt   <br>mud</br>  <br>All Servants actually remember this stuff. It's not like "yeah, I've been summoned there two hours ago", but more of them reading a book about themselves doing that. They know it happened, but have no memories of it. Archer's summoning just gave him an insight into his younger self and he managed to get his answer. Either that, or Guardian bullshit.</br>  <br>Fucking awesome dude. They laid out exactly why Shirou could be Gil, and Archer was mad because he was having a post-life crisis. He got better by the end.</br>  <br>UBW Gil is trash like anything in UBW so nothing of value was lost.</br>  <br>Because Iskandr was a fellow king. Even then, he barely had any respect for him, and simply indulged him for fun.</br>  <br>effect from mud bath</br>  Be honest /a/, who is the ONE DxD that is universally liked?<br><br>We know Rias, Akeno, Asia and Koneko all have their fair share of haters so they're ruled out, but what about the rest?<br><br>No one hates Xenovia or Serafall, right?</br></br></br></br>  Who in their right mind could hate Rias?  <br>Akenobros and Riasfriends are kind of like a "one or the other" group</br>  <br>way to start a dxd thread with another image of akeno so shocking<br>better call up her baby daddies they waitin for her in prison</br></br>  <br>Settle down it was the first image in my DxD folder</br>  <br> universally liked? <br>No such thing. Everyone has their own preferences. A lot of people don't voice their dislike of certain preferences. For me, I like a handful of DxD girls. There are many I don't like, but I'm not one who would be vocal about not liking them.</br></br>  Kuroka. She is the best.  <br> Harley Kuroka </br>  <br/>  <br>Ddraig</br>  <br> Anon you have to impregnate me right now or Loki will win! <br> There's no time hurry up and fuck me! </br></br>  <br>No one hates Bennia...right?</br>  <br>No one can hate this best girl combo.</br>  <br>most people don't even know who that is because DxD is primarily anime only posters  and there's nothing wrong with that </br>  <br>Yes there is.</br>  <br>There definitely is.</br>  <br>the only thing wrong with these threads is that mexican isseifag who needs to go choke on one of his red dildos</br>  <br>I don't think so at all. They're best bros, and so are the fans. There's just a lot of trolls trying to stir shit up.</br>   Koneko sitting on Issei's lap in color   <br><br><br>Nah, I keep up with the LN and the anime. Some people prefer different methods of DxD and that's okay.<br><br>Elitist LN fags ruin these threads. It's better to educate the anime only fags rather than be a fucking prick to them.<br><br>Akenofag shit posting doesn't ruin threads. All shit posting ruins threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Not sure enough folks know quite what to make of Mil tan to hate...shim?  <br>The idiots that reply to the shitposting help ruin threads.</br>  <br>People hate Rias, Akeno, and and Koneko? I'm pretty sure the only people who do are shitposters.</br>  <br>I'd eat out Xenovia's ass clean.</br>  Universally liked? Well I have never seen anyone post a bad word about Kiryu.<br><br>Side question: Her 1st name is Aika but Issei doesn't call her that. Is that normal? (To be fair she still calls Issei as "Hyoudo".</br></br>  <br><br>Sera is best Satan</br></br>  <br>First name is used if you are good friends usually. They are acquaintances.</br>  <br>Thank you kind anon.</br>  <br>You wouldn't rape a Serafall, would you?</br>  <br>Serafall raped you if you impregnated Sona.</br>  <br>She can shiver my timbers whenever she wants.</br>  <br>That's Ophis, right?</br>  <br>Sorry no anon. Bennia is another character from the later LNs.</br>      <br> Rias <br> fair share of haters <br><br>I stopped hanging out in DxD threads after season 1, has it become this bad? I remember everyone went in for Rias.</br></br></br></br>  <br>While that is true, sometimes people call people of the opposite sex with their family names even if they're good friends out of attraction.</br>  <br>I like the one who is not a slut.</br>  <br>Rias really isn't hated that I've seen. Most of the hate I've seen is directed at either Akeno or Asia.</br>      Who 100 yen here?  Posting Best Doujin  Not enough Shirone.  <br>Will she accept if I cum in her for 100 yen?</br>  <br>Only if she's drunk.</br>  <br>I'm talking about Rose not this drunkard. We don't know if Rose will approve of drunken frolicking.</br>  <br>I don't think Rose is capable of coming to a logical decision about that when she's drunk.</br>  <br>Vol 9 anon.</br>     daily reminder Issei didn't dress break nor booblingual Rias in last ep   <br>Vol 9 didn't have someone cumming in her which I was asking about, even if she was drunk.</br>  <br>Pretty sure Issei loves big ones though. Or at the very least lusts after them more.</br>  <br>why does that nigga look like kyon</br>  <br>He likes them the best. It says so in his theme song.</br>  <br>Fuck! You're right! God damn it!</br>  <br>There's a troll or two. Just like there's one dipshit that constantly shitposts about akeno. Nobody actually hates either of them.  Actual hate is reserved for Asia, in her role as cockblocking editor </br>   hating Akeno <br><br>Fucking faggots. Kill yourselves.</br></br>  <br>Point of order. Asia herself was cockblocked this season</br>      <br> stopped hanging out in DxD threads <br> since season 1 <br><br>and here you are</br></br></br></br>    <br>I am a Akenofag and think Rias is a little shit.</br>    <br>If it has two or more dicks on the same page its gay</br>  <br> that ass </br>  <br>It is Kyon, the hand and hair is Photoshopped, but the text is real.</br>  I hate Rias purely because of her seiyuu.<br><br>All Yoko Hisaka does is voice B-grade ero anime sluts</br></br>  nobody hates elsha              <br>That's not how fabric works.</br>  <br>I could have sworn she was flat.</br>  she's black  <br>She was never flat. Her size is between Asia and Xenovia.<br><br>Miyama-Zero made a mistake on drawing her in the first illustrations that she had which was on the short story "Unresurrected Phoenix". She drew her flat-chested.<br><br>His mistake was carried over by the anime team in Season 1.<br><br>Miyama-Zero apologized for that mistake. The anime team also corrected Ravel's size in Season 3.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Koneko has to compete against that. I feel sorry for her</br>  <br>boosto</br>  <br>Koneko&gt;Ravel</br>  <br>He is best girl</br>  <br>Xenovia.</br>  <br>Dat ass tho</br>  <br>Is that a ferrari 458 Italia</br>  <br>what if issei banged grayfia that time she got drunk</br>  <br>Gasper</br>  <br>this</br>  <br> No one actually hates Akeno <br>You are mad delusional anon.</br></br>  <br>Everybody loves this school slut.</br>  <br>I have a hard time believing she's that sexy.</br>  <br>What happened with that foot?</br>  <br> kiryuu always longed to be a popular girl <br> no one pays attention to a nerd <br> she works out and looks at porn to study it <br> in order to feel attractive <br> since popular girls look and talk sex all the time <br> gets her wish when she's somewhat part of the in-crowd in their class <br> slowly saw issei as someone desirable but couldn't out of obligation to asia <br>   truly gets her hopes dashed when she summons xenovia and hears the truth <br><br>Was her childhood friend Matsuda or Motohama?

Look at all Oboe-chan scenes.</br>  <br>probably just to promote novels, maybe I'm wrong<br> I hope I'm wrong. </br></br>  one last time<br><br>post your rare Kumiko</br></br>  <br>It's not ending fast enough.</br>      <br>Kumiko wants you to get back to work.</br>  <br>Wait a minute…</br>  <br>I want to protect that smile.</br>    I want to see Asuka lose it.    <br><br>She doesn't look nearly as good with Novel volume 1-2 eyes</br></br>    <br> short haired kumiko <br>what could have been</br></br>  <br>you just have to hang on in quiet desperation, it's the anon way</br>  Reina sux HIV<br>futa</br>  <br><br><br><br> what could have been <br>Poor man's Kaori?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah she looks kind of plain<br><br>Purple eyes is better</br></br></br>    <br>This reminds me of when Aoi stared at her sax when she was getting ready to say she's quitting the band.</br>  Reminder that season 2 never because there's no benefit for Yamaha to sponsor it  <br>We'll see.</br>  <br>If they sold instrument keychains like the ones from the show I bet lots of people would buy them. I know I would but as an ex band geek, of course</br>    <br>Shieeet, I have a tiny trombone keychain already and I would fucking kill for a Trom-bro.</br>  Pray that Mizore doesn't break her last reed during her solo  <br>I just had this great idea for a Kumiko oppai mousepad. But instead of oppai, you use her fluffy.</br>  <br>People who aren't familiar with the novels and her character would easily miss those scenes.<br><br>So they're either made to appease people who have read the novels already by hinting at that future development, or as subtle build up for season two.</br></br></br>  I feel like a dad seeing these kids work hard and aim high. I wish I'll have a daughter like Haruka. I want to be proud. I hope my kids will like band..  anyone notice in the PV where Reina is behind Fagott girl and the other girl in Mizore's section. Do you think they are seeing her practice.  <br><br>So dreamy.</br></br>  Which senpai would you pick as your mentor.  <br>No.</br>  <br><br>Kumiko pls</br></br>  <br>Buchou, she's become a leader these past few eps<br>Kaori and Asuka don't seem like the teaching type</br></br>  <br><br>all 3 are useless in their own special way</br></br>  <br>I wish Reina was a relative of mine so I could mercilessly bully and tease her.</br>  <br>Not Asuka that's for sure.</br>  <br>Probably Kaori. I like Haruka a lot, but she seems like a better friend than a leader. <br>Not that I'm saying she's a bad leader.<br><br>Asuka is out of the question.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>and then rape her until her mind breaks right?</br></br>  I find it funny how Haruka and Asuka has switched places in terms of likability  <br>She sure has backups? Many of them. Created in many lonely nights. Very lonely.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127377775 <br> you will never brush and comb reinas hair </br>  <br>No, I can't take Reina seriously as a sexual being.<br>Her personality is too childish.<br><br>I'd ruffle her hair whenever we meet, though.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127377775 <br/>   "Kaori-senpai a shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit."   So in the end, that faggot girl (you know which one) still the best girl right?  <br>You mistake Asuka for the type that can actually relate to other people<br><br>In a way, Asuka is a lot like /a/, if /a/ was actually good at something. She's autistically focused on one thing, with near zero empathy for others, lack of patience to shitters and plebs, and fully capable of hiding her true self, her power level if you were.</br></br></br>  No matter what happens Reina x Kumiko will always be the superior ship.  I'll cherish the fond memories of all the blogging, shitposting, shipperfags, and ample amounts of creative edits. Never have I witnessed a thread so eager to make me hate anons, never before had I found a thread so intent on flinging cancer into this sea of uncontrollable autism. But I will miss it. I anticipated each and every Tuesday to see the same shit unfold. And now it's come to an end. Thanks for making my life even more miserable you tasteless fagotts. Goodbye, and good riddance.  <br>added Kumiko to it</br>  <br>I want to impregnate that smile.</br>  <br> posting the wrong file </br>  Reina is gay!  neetball is still good right?<br><br>didn't livewatch for a month.</br></br>  17,626 Kekkai Sense<br>11,148 Yahari<br>*8,598 Show by Rock!</br></br>  <br><br>nah he's kil</br></br>  How does it feel to know that after the last episode, nobody will care about Hibike!

Is that true?   <br> believing /m/'s lies </br>  <br>What, we didn't have more WA games long before Symphogear was a thing.<br>But yeah, Kaneko wants to work on a new game once he is done with Symphogear.<br> Implying that will ever happen. </br></br></br>  <br> I know this is just some yuribait show, so I'm curious if I should add another reason not to like it. <br><br><br>Guess that means I should try performing dark rituals to kill this series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you here if you actively hate the series and are dumb enough to say it openly?<br> yuribait <br>That's not why people like Symphogear</br></br></br>  <br>This basically Wild Arms with singing.</br>  <br> I know this is just some yuribait show <br>It really, really isn't. It does have some yuri, yes, but it would be just as amazing without it.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear has the same writer as WA and is full of references to it. You should try actually watching the shows you have an opinion of.</br>  What does it mean?  <br>Wait until TGS.</br>  <br>It has sitting on my HD for about a year now and just can't mustered the desire to watch it. I like magical girl shows but I can't stand yuribait.

Yugi needs that fucking structure deck more.</br>  Reminder that we'll never get a hair-down post-shower scene with Sora.  <br>Him and Kaiba will get one after the new movie next year. Besides didn't they get one not too long ago?</br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br>You were too slow, Ruri.</br>  insert VA joke<br> Both are worst girls </br>  <br>Holy shit wow<br><br>Do you have the Junk Warrior Symphogear comparison?</br></br></br>  <br>What episode is this from??</br>    <br>Yugi new structure deck needs this card</br>    <br>First episode of Gon duel.</br>  <br>Should I watch this if I'm looking for good battle anime? Does it have male characters to please my bisexual nature?</br>  <br>Yes and no.</br>  Wait what?<br><br>Konami is releasing Highspeed Riders and Jack's manga cards in the West first? Before Nipland?</br></br>  Final duel with the Professor when??  <br>At this speed: Episode 150</br>  <br>Nah, they just released the box art, which spoiled Belial and the third theme (definitely not Goyo).</br>  <br>Yuya needs to learn the rule of bros before hos. Instead of solving all his problems with the power of friendship, the first thing he thinks about is dropping everything because Yuzu MIGHT be in trouble.</br>  I have overlayed the Ruris and Fruits to form their real citrus colors.  <br> Serena is Samus <br> Strong girl that is slowly turning into a pouty princess with a lot of fanart, sexy or not <br><br>Well I'll be damned...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Murica!</br>  <br>You can't simply resist the power of a ruri<br>I don't blame him</br></br>  <br>Ruris are magical beings. Once you get one, you can never live without her.</br>  Why is it that the weakness of Judai's, Yusei's and Yuma's extra deck focused decks always that they run out of hand so damn quickly? Yuya's Performapal deck doesn't have that problem, they've got enough search cards to constantly recycle and replenish any losses and if they set the scale their pretty much set and Yugi's is such a fucking clusterfuck every hand is a dead draw.  Yuzu will never figure out which of us is which now, I'll keep my Rin forever.  <br>It should be the banana part that's green</br>  <br>Riiiiin~<br><br> Yugo is not very smart, and neither am I </br></br></br>  <br>What happens when the Yuyas get their hair color inverted?</br>  <br>Nothing, they don't match up, at least not perfectly.</br>  <br>But if the bananas are green, then it shows he's not a man yet who can please his Rin.</br>  <br>You can call them green peppers instead</br>  <br> Yugo  <br> Spiciest of the Fruits <br> Green Pepper <br><br>That doesn't add up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yugi and Kaiba got TCG only starter decks, but not structure decks.</br>  I wonder if there's a decent deck out there that runs ritual,fusion, synchro,xyz and pendulum all together in harmony  <br>Zebras.</br>  <br>That sounds like chaos more than harmony.</br>  <br>I'm sure there's a deck out there that can do it or at least there will be someday. Maybe the protagonist of the next series can do it, As it seems like Konami is scared to increase the extra deck even more by giving it another summoning method.</br>  <br>Ah I tried, sort of.</br>  <br>Aside from rituals, that's DDD in a nutshell</br>  <br>Zebras, or D/D/D to a lesser extent. <br><br>Also<br><br> Rituals that aren't Nekroz <br><br>Ha</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Since Sophia is basically an honorary Zefra, that's almost literally Zefras.</br></br>  I've had a very painful past three days. Only Ruris can bring back the skin on the bottom of my feet. Therefore, post Ruris.   Actually manage to summon Hope Zexal first turn for the first time <br> The game is literally me just ejaculating Raid Raptors onto the field for 4 turns until I decide to OTK <br>Holy shit this is the stupidest card ever I love it</br></br>  <br>You trying to trick me Anon?</br>  <br>I would take a photo but this is a Christian board.</br>        <br>Is it now?</br>   there will be a scene of Yuzu falling asleep on top of Yuya out of exhaustion from evading Academia <br> there will be a scene of Yuzu crying as she kills Yuya to save the multiverse <br> both will be animated by Ebina </br></br>  <br> there will be more cute scenes of Yuzu and Serena <br> animated by Ebina too </br></br>  <br>He can join me in the great Fruit Orchard in the sky.<br><br>Can't wait.</br></br></br>  <br> there will be an episode where Ruri appears <br> it will be animated by the Koreans </br></br>  <br>it's so frustrating to fight, I ran into igknight hope zexal and that was some shit. <br><br> MFW I'm playing DDDs and the best play is set lilith and pray I draw a trap <br> mfw I see none. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I once managed to get out both Hope Zexal and Infinity out at the same time.<br><br>I can only imagine what was going through my opponents mind when he saw that.</br></br></br>  <br> IgKnight <br> Hope Zexal <br><br>This sounds amazing, especially since I've been wanting to try out IgKnights so I can yell Ignaito Chuuni Chants at people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What RUMs were he using?<br>Astral Force and The Seventh One?</br></br>  I never understood exactly how Overlay Units/Xyz Material works in the actual card game? Do you just have them for how many monsters were used in the summoning? So two level 4s would equal to two units, and once those are up they're removed from behind the xyz card? It's been a long time since I've actually played and that's the one thing Arc-V doesn't explain.  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Yes, you put the xyz materials under the xyz monster, and when you detach them you put them to the graveyard (they aren't counted as being on the field, so things like Superheavy Samurai Soulpiercer's effect won't activate if they are detached as xyx material, but effects that just say "if this card is sent to the graveyard" will proc)</br>  <br><br>Cool thanks for the help, it was always confusing to me.</br></br>  <br> rule of bros before hos <br>Is Yuya the first YGO MC to not follow this rule on account of being so straight?</br></br>  <br>what is that ritual?<br>its the only thing i dont recognize</br></br>  <br> i love you jou <br> i will let myself drown so you can live even though you aren't part of the Egyptian prophecy and the whole world will end </br></br>  <br>Yusei tried to warn us<br>Women are nothing but trouble, only motorcycles and kizunas are worth it</br></br>  <br>Champion of Chaos Supreme Black Luster Soldier, Unmaker of Reality</br>  <br>BLS retrain</br>  <br>i googled that and got a naruto fanfiction page<br>i am still cringing at the list of ships</br></br>  <br>Yuya has some deep citrus-related issues if he's even willing to abandon his so-called best friend for her.</br>  <br>argent chaos force, you send it with chain then you can add it to hand when you make rank 6 utopia</br>  <br>Sorry.<br><br>Supreme Warrior Black Luster Soldier<br>You can Ritual Summon this card with "Supreme Warrior Ritual".
