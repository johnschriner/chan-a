[ Why did everyone in London speak Japanese?  <br>Because the show was made by elevens</br>  Because mages are generally smart assholes that can easily be versed in several languages  It's magic I don't have to explain shit  yes. japan is in western europe. and everyone in western europe speaks japanese, but with a funny accent.  <br>This entire episode was full of cringe.</br>  <br>The epilogue was a 10/10.</br>  <br>Because anime</br>  <br>Japanese is England's 3rd language, unlike burgerland that can only speak American.</br>  <br>freedumbland is spanish m8</br>  <br> Japanese is England's 3rd language <br>I'm pretty sure you meant Arabic.</br></br>  <br>That's obviously the second.</br>  <br>Second is Urdu.</br>  <br><br><br>Wouldn't it be some native Celtic or French/German?</br></br></br>  At the end of "Crash", why did the Korean couple keep speaking English to each other even when they were the only ones in the room?<br><br>Same thing at the beginning of Shanghai Knights: Chinese family speaking Chinese to each other, then the white guy shows up so they switch to English, then he goes away and the family continues to speak to each other in English. Why?</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  They're at least speaking Japanese with British accents, right?  Yusari~n made my heart go doki doki and hit a home run.  <br>Did we really need a new one?</br>  So, what's next episode name?   Ayumi = another Fuko <br> Yusa = another Misuzu/Nayuki <br> Tomori = another Haruhi </br></br>  <br>Haruhi is more tolerable then Tomori</br>  But who was brother?  <br>Yes, it's a fairly popular show and it's the day the episode aired.</br>   speedbro died <br> imouto died <br>This was pretty dark episode.</br></br>  <br>Tomori= Nagase Iore<br><br>shitposting Nao, you should just ignore them.<br>They are mere fanatics, they create useless topics.<br>spoil all the topics in which they participate.<br>always use the same arguments and always post the same images.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else have a slight panic thinking that the student council assisting with the baseball club somehow affected how Hinata ended up in the afterlife?<br><br>Didn't they say all the key series share a universe?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128582490 <br>QUICK<br><br>CUE THE DRAMA</br></br></br>  What if Tomori was testing how many seconds Yuu's ability lasted, in order to see if he is improving it in time.  <br>Didn't she say she wasn't sure?</br>  <br>My goddess Yusarin.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128582490 <br> sales circlejerk <br>Fuck off. You have a thread to shitpost.</br></br>  I want to cum inside Nao-chan.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128582490 <br>just kill the loli you fucking stupid jun</br>  <br>What do you call this? A sidetail?</br>  <br>Well, who's stopping you?</br>  This was the worst baseball episode ever. They don't have enough gimmicky characters in this series to make it work.  How do idols attend school in japan if their presence causes this much disruption? And what about them missing time because of work?  I'm pretty disappointed with the backgrounds so far considering it's a P.A. Works show. <br>The city shots in OP and ED are nice, and so was the scenery near the hospital with Nao's brother, but I never really seen anything that would make me pause the episode and take a screenshot like some other shows do. Most background look really simple or artificial.<br>Even Glasslip was much better in this respect.</br></br>  <br>They attend all-girl schools.</br>  <br>Speedslut and Lelouch.</br>  <br>agree, not even close to AB</br>  <br>But there are still girls that freak out over them.</br>  <br>They go to school like normal, there are idols that are able to pass law school entrance exams while doing idol things.</br>  <br>Charlotte best girl</br>  <br>Once again the show gets ruined by it's 13 episode length. With AB they introduced more characters then they could develop and spread out too thin, here they focus on a smaller cast, but can't do as much with them as they would want to.</br>  <br>Well, at least there isn't rape.<br><br>At least in the same quantity.</br></br></br>  <br>When will we get an anime about cute prosecutors?</br>  <br>The speedbro bit was gold, though.</br>  <br>Real life isn't anime.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I want to cum Inside Momo-chan</br>  I don't get why they brought Yusa into their group, her abilities don't seem useful for what they do, and having an idol around only brings attention to them which I imagine they would want to avoid.   guy uses telepathic knuckleball to cheat <br>   loses on a wild pitch <br><br>That's great. As someone who's watched a ballclub with a knuckleballer for 18 years (21 if you count the prospect spot starter) I didn't know if to celebrate or laugh my ass off.</br></br></br>  <br>She was testing if he could use his powers on power users, which was confirmed as not. This also confirms how she's with the scientists or something.</br>  <br>because a group of 3 would be boring<br><br>also her sister is pretty useful</br></br></br>  <br>I believe that's actually one of the reasons they brought her into the team. Her idol charms. Besides, as Misa, she gives the entire team a very defensive stand in case they need to 'fight' something.</br>  <br>Yeah he the only good part of the episode. <br><br>Even Misa who would be the home run batter in this series got gimped by Yusa's body.</br></br></br>   Next episode is gonna be a cliche baseball filler episode, don't expect anything too special <br> "OMG I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE!" <br> Generic baseball episode comes out <br> "What a shitty episode! Nothing happened! Angel Beasts was so much better!" <br>/a/ never fails to show it's autism</br></br></br></br>  Why the hell is this show so goddamn unsettling? Even with the shit we know about the scientists everything seems way too saccharine. For some reason i'm tense as fuck whenever they do things like the imouto's pizza antics or the yusarin magic. Is it because I know Maeda's going to start his wild ride sooner or later?  <br>I mean the pyrokinesis as the ability that's pretty useless. What could they use it for other than torture or threatening somebody? And they seem to be doing fine when it comes to threatening anyway.</br>  <br> Not wanting hot idol and hot idol's hotter ghost sister </br>  <br>He already used his power on Archer-kun before.</br>  <br>3 People is boring and Yusa is pretty much 2 extra characters.</br>  <br> threatening somebody? <br><br>that's pretty much what they do most of the time so it's pretty useful</br></br></br>  <br>An extra dimension.</br>  <br>I get why they are in the show, I just think that the plot reason for it is pretty weak.</br>  They should have focused on the actual Occult Research Club.  I want this guy back.  <br>this, I miss self-inserting in him</br>  <br> Literary has the power to defy physics and create enough kinetic energy to start a fire without having to have direct physical contact <br> Not wanting that person in the league of friendship  <br>Even if the power isn't used all the time, that doesn't mean it's not useful to have it. Is the USA just gonna get rid of it's army because it has nukes?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck the older sister and she reverts back to the younger one when we both cum.</br>  Did anybody else get suspicious that the pitcher didn't actually have any powers and it was his catcherbro that was actually the telekinetic?    <br>Were that the case he would have caught the last ball.</br>   Key show <br> Baseball episode <br>Waa, how fun.</br></br>  <br><br> I like stronger men who have everything planned out better because they represent who I could be if I actually tried in life <br>That is the most unbelievable character. Even the dense virgin character is more believeable. No one in this world has "everything planned" like the Lulu character arch type.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she was in that mode all the time, but I guess we need her younger sister mode for some quality gap moe.</br>  <br>But he didn't have everything planned, are you stupid? <br>He just thought he did, and the episode was presented from his perspective, so as a viewer you might have gotten the same impression.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully this show is on Fatalpulse's radar.</br>  <br>Umaru-chan is.</br>  <br>She could actually make Yusarin's next mixtape even more fire.</br>  <br>Please be true.</br>  <br>And his character changed to more humble after his "precise calculations" failed, just like any person would. Thinking someone would keep on trying to be a strategist at life after being beaten at his own game is stupid.</br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br><br> they go after the wrong guy in a future episode and fail to save the guy that actually has powers </br></br>  <br>Ebina, to be exact.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the vagina would tighten and trap your dick from the shock of suddenly finding out she's in an alien situation and has someone inside her. Good luck with limp dick.</br>  <br> Yusa working on rough song ideas <br> Misa possesses her and keeps inserting parts about fire and burning things down </br></br>  <br>God damnit. Why is she so overrated?</br>  <br>poor Ebina</br>  <br> No one in this world has "everything planned" like the Lulu character arch type. <br><br>Anon, you watched the first episode right? You do know that MC is essentially being forced by Tomori to do her bidding since then. <br><br>Anyway, I miss first ep MC, but mostly because of his shenanigans. Now, he can't come up with any crazy shit anymore. But who knows? Maybe once the show gets going around the 6th/7th episode, we'll see him again (or maybe not, since the show's only 13 episodes).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be like carrying around an AK-47 with you at all times since it might come in useful in some situation.<br><br>Even the telekinesis guy would seem more useful and I'm sure they have lots of other people with useful powers at the school.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she's the best.</br>  <br> implying that wouldn't make me cum harder. </br>  <br>Fucking hell, I want to see Umaru suffer, Ebina is not deserving of the Fatalpulse treatment.<br><br>My body is ready.</br></br></br>  <br>Remember when people could make their own threads when they wanted to discuss something?</br>  <br>No, you don't understand. A male's penis getting pinched like that while erected would cause the tissues to tear, literary breaking your penis. This would cause sever issues to your sexual life.</br>  <br>And I never said anything about "precise calculations". I don't know why do assume that.<br>I liked the fact that for once we got a selfish asshole willing to ruin other's people's lives for his own personal gain as an MC.<br><br><br>And I want to discuss this show. Where is the problem?</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128582490 <br>Get the fuck out back to your shithole</br>  <br>I am diamonds.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128582490 <br><br> Thinking these charts mean shit within the first 4 episodes </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128584345 <br>I'm pretty sure if you didn't exist, this show would improve significantly.</br>  <br>There is whole containment thread for retards who actually believe that</br>  Speedbro has given so much for the team. I hope he gets the idol ending.  So, can anyone explain to me  the rules of baseball?   <br>Not the same anon, but I can see why some people have a problem with Nao. I really like her as a character, but sometimes she can be very overbearing, and given how it's rare to have an MC that was originally presented as selfish, I somewhat understand where people are coming from when they are complaining about Tomori.<br><br>Then again, I'm more worried about how they're gonna present Nao's supposedly "cute" side, when the show's supposed to take a more serious and dark tone after the 6th or 7th episode.</br></br></br>  Meanwhile the whole experiment thing is still weird. Serious plot element with no romantic meaning, no serious plot element and just romantic meaning, or serious plot element AND romantic meaning?  <br>Based from an interview that was posted last week or two weeks ago, the anime's supposed to be romantic AND serious. How they pull it off when they're about a quarter through is beyond me.</br>  do you think we will see   truck-kun   or   key aids   until the end of the show?   no cute idols on television tonight <br>It makes me sad</br>  <br>Key aids for sure. My bets are on the imouto.</br>  <br>I mean, angel beats did it and most of it was a compilation of comedy skits.</br>  <br> Not best girl </br>  Episodes <br><br> #5 - The Sound I Will Hear Someday<br> Itsuka Kiita Oto (いつか聴いた音)<br><br> #6 - Unnoticed Happiness<br> Kizukanakatta Shiawase (気づかなかった幸せ)<br><br> #7 - To the End of the Flight<br> Touhikou no Hate ni (逃避行の果てに)<br><br> #8 - Chance Meeting<br> Kaikou (邂逅)<br><br> #9 - The World Not Present<br> Koko ni Nai Sekai (ここにない世界)<br><br> #10 - Plunder<br> Ryakudatsu (略奪)<br><br> #11 - Charlotte<br> Charlotte (シャーロット)<br><br> #12 - Promise<br> Yakusoku (約束)<br><br> #13 - Records of the Future<br> Korekara no Kiroku (これからの記録)<br><br><br>The MC retains information of the people he possessed.<br>Nao wants use the power of the MC in your brother, to get information about what happened.<br><br> #5 - The Sound I Will Hear Someday<br>Itsuka Kiita Oto (いつか聴いた音)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> #6 - Unnoticed Happiness <br>Goody by creature</br></br>  <br>Her ED has her eating something in two slides. What a glutton.</br>  <br>That's true. Then again, I don't remember if Angel Beats took this long to set up what was about to happen to the characters or if it was this hard to predict what was gonna happen.</br>  <br>You always need to need your Nao or she'll go hungry</br>  Is it my imagination, or do japanese lyrics and titles tend to be a lot harder to extract their true meaning than English ones? Or maybe it's just bad translations.  I'm not really a huge fan of baseball, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Here's hoping that Ayu would be able to meet Yusa at some point just to see her reaction.  <br> Ayu will possess Yusa <br>How would you react?</br></br>  Who is this guy?  <br>me irl</br>  <br>It's the other way around. MAL is stealing that shit from here. By the way, why were you on that site anyway?</br>  <br> This long <br>Nigga, it's only been 4 episodes. Angel beats was saving the drama like a jew with money.</br></br>  <br>What if Ayu meets Yuusa before she   dies by the hands of the scientists, because MC decided to save Nao instead of his imouto?  </br>  <br><br>Charlotte</br></br>  <br>MC's brother. He has that sharingan ability that traps people in deadly dreams.</br>  <br>Can't blame him for trying not to get diabeetus.</br>  <br>Like I said, I don't remember much about Angel Beats.<br><br>I just really hope they'll be able to pull off the romance and the dark tones in a satisfying way. I just want this show to be successful, because I want my Nao figure.</br></br></br>  <br><br>They won't since its only one cour, if it was two then the pacing would be fine. I thought Maeda said he learned from his mistakes from Angel Beats but I guess not. This will be another show with wasted potential by rushing the ending.</br></br>  <br><br>Whoops accidentally quoted myself.</br></br>  Imouto must get her sauce from Papa John's. That stuff is NASTY. <br><br>Well shit and my captcha had to be of pizza too.</br></br>  <br> This will be another show with wasted potential by rushing the ending. <br><br>Angel Beats was actually okay. Then it dragged on the drama for far too long and did some pretty forced stuff just to get an emotional reaction from the audience. <br><br>I just really want a Tomori figure ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really puzzles me, you would think that after the success that AB was it wouldn't be hard to get the funding for a two cour show.</br>  Misa is clearly the superior sister.<br><br><br>It's the best of both worlds, Yusa cooking something with pizza sauce would be hilarious.</br></br></br>  Oh snap, the MC uses his power up to no good. Almost getting hit by a truck driver, you awaken your imperfect hidden power. Can your power save you in that short time before you got hit by a truck?<br><br>http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/<wbr>Special:Random</wbr></br></br>  How did Misa hit that ball?

I know you want to join in the fun too.</br>  <br>To be fair, it was still related to the show. Like the possibility of the girl or a bystander awaken because of MC.<br><br>It would make an interesting different turns, right? I'm still talking related about, the show, and do a little bump for the thread not to drown.<br><br>And unlike those guys on other thread, I'm not samefagging.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Throught google image search</br>  <br>It's disgusting how much a non-entity he became after the 1st episode.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128586068 <br>The power of Hitomi from Hinamatsuri.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128586068 <br>but can you handle it?</br>  <br>I want to protect this smile</br>  When and where do episode previews go up?  Disappointment of the season.<br>Not enough MC smug that we were promised in the first episode.</br>  <br>That's not samefagging, the mod deleted the original post and every faggot who replied to it.</br>  <br>The day MC finally snaps and calls the pizza sauce shit means the day that the imouto is doomed.</br>  I'm disappointed in this series. I wanted more of the MC coming up with cool/smart way of using his power, like in ep 1.   people who still want to believe Imouto's gonna be ok <br>Check the beginning and the end of the opening sequence</br>  Will they ever run out of pizza sauce?  <br>Imouto death/kidnapping episode.</br>  <br>That was a mass deletion, not a samefag.<br>I was one of those deleted posts.</br></br>  <br>Shiro</br>  <br> wanting death to imouto. <br>Excuse me?</br></br>  <br> babby's first Key show <br><br>She will magically resurrects in the final episode, faglord.</br></br></br>  The most surprising thing about this show's threads are the people who thought Angel Beats could've been good.<br><br>Anyway, are people only watching to see who eventually dies?</br></br>  So what was the experiment Nao did at the end for?  <br> Angel Beats could've been good <br>It could be at least decent if it was 2 cour.</br></br>  <br>She needed an excuse to hold MC.</br>  <br>Still no clue. We had this whole speculation on the last thread, but nothing's certain.<br><br>Also MC got a faceful of boobs. Heh.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128586242 <br> http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki<wbr>/Fallen_Angel_Physiology</wbr> <br>You can turn into a spoon that Nao is using. Sounds like a fun time.</br></br>  <br> #9 - The World Not Present <br> Koko ni Nai Sekai (ここにない世界) <br>Fuck, here's hoping for a 'world where nothing happened' tier OST.</br></br></br>  <br>shitposting Nao, you should just ignore them.<br>They are mere fanatics, they create useless topics.<br>spoil all the topics in which they participate.<br>always use the same arguments and always post the same images.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno if I wanna be slobbered whole.</br>  <br>  Speedbro has given so much for the team. I hope he gets the idol ending. <br><br>Yes it will receive the final Sunohara.</br></br></br>  <br>Are those femdom doujins with speedbro I smell in the distance?</br>  I need a webm of fastbro touching first base. Has it been made yet?  <br>I COUNTER IT WITH MY OWN<br><br>http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/<wbr>Remote_Possession</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Living Wing Manifestation <br>Maybe...</br></br>  <br>Maybe she was checking what happens to the MC's body when he possesses someone else? Like, if it still properly functions and he goes into a coma-like state, or whether he just stops?</br>  Pray for speedbro.  <br>Speedbro needs to go to church and be cleansed of his sins.<br><br>Seems like he went into a coma-like state here. But that wasn't a problem last time so what...</br></br></br>  <br>can't you not posses people that have powers? that's why Nao asked him to try possessing the pitcher. I was pretty sure the catcher was the one with the power.</br>  <br>I think he possessed someone else with powers with no ill effects beforehand, though.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128582490 <br>no problem, accellerator next week</br>    <br>He uses his ability to stop people with powers from running away, so yes, he can possess them.</br>   baseball <br> same voice actor as Hinata <br>PA Works on auto pilot.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes he managed to posses the photoguy no problem, then all of a sudden it seems like he wasn't able to posses this guy here. I wonder why there is a contradiction, or why Nao would even ask to test that given that she had already witnessed him possessing the photo guy.</br></br>  <br><br><br>oh well I guess I just really wanted the catcher to be the one with powers and get abducted by the scientists so the Student Council could experience failure</br></br></br>  <br>Golden Time was set in a law school, it's about as close as we'll get.</br>  <br>At some point there's going to be a big fuck up and then we'll end up at a darkest hour point.<br><br>Meanwhile, still no luck with the whole possession mess.</br></br></br>  <br>that guy puncking Nao last week was the best thing in this show. Does anyone have a wbm?</br>  Why are they even called student council if they never do anything a student council would? Why not just have them be a separate entity dedicated to doing what they are doing?  <br>one of the main 3 will get abducted and they will all blame themselves and be sad for a bit</br>  Reminder MC wants the Charlotte but she doesn't give a shit about him  <br>she didn't have to catch him in her arms. he seemed to have gotten the pass out into kneeling stance just fine.</br>  <br>Episode 6<br>The difficult decision of the MC, is to choose between saving Tomori or your sister.</br></br>  <br> Charlotte </br>  <br>WHAT IS THE CHARLOTTE, WHO IS CHARLOTTE, WHAT DOES CHARLOTTE MEAN?<br><br><br>MAEEEEEEEEEDA.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Charlotte <br>I smell summer</br></br>  <br>That's the only thing I miss. I don't have a problem with Tomori, unlike a ton of people, but I feel as though she's stifling MC's wacky shenanigans.</br>  <br> Retards still think Nao is Charlotte <br><br>Mein sides</br></br></br>  The whole school is supposed to have a lot of kids with special powers, but we never see them using those powers at school or talking to each other about them. Wasted potential.  <br>IT'S NAO.<br><br>That said, maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>Only potential to have powers.<br>Very few actually have them at the school.</br></br>  Charlotte is my waifu.  <br>I wish MC and Nao fought more. It'd be amusing.</br>  <br>It's so fucking obvious, which makes me wonder how they're gonna do it to keep things interesting.<br><br>I mean:<br>  mysterious benefactor provided Nao's brother a chance to stay in likely one of the best health centres in Japan <br>  we can assume that s/he's the one also providing for Nao's needs <br>  mysterious benefactor may be a member of the group of scientists that experimented on Tomori's brother, or maybe even the head of the group <br>  benefactor is the only person Tomori trusts <br>  Nao unknowingly helping him out with his plans by convincing/forcing people like MC to go to the school for people with powers <br>  Maeda stated that Tomori learns to trust MC as the story progresses. Maybe she feels guilty because she indirectly caused imouto to be kidnapped/get killed. <br><br>There's still a shit ton of stuff that we don't know, like what the Japanese anons at 2ch discovered (i.e. "time travel"), but at the moment, Maeda and co. aren't really doing anything unpredictable, which fucking sucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wet TK has arrived  <br>To me it seems like "what happens if he possesses someone with powers", since IIRC he hadn't done that yet.</br>  <br>Only people that are close with each other fight often so Nao and MC will never fight</br>  <br> the Japanese anons at 2ch discovered (i.e. "time travel") <br>We've been nearly certain of time travel since the very beginning.</br></br>  <br>He possessed Shirou in the second episode.</br>  <br>If they are rare then they would be even more likely to become the target of gossip, possibly envy or fear from other students.</br>  <br>Goddamn it.</br>  <br>Yeah, which sucks. And when they do fight, Tomori's winning all the time.<br><br>I'm just waiting for Tomori's mindbreak, because it's bound to come soon. Given all that we know, we can easily infer that she eventually has to stop trusting her provider/caretaker/benefactor, and has to start trusting MC more.<br><br>I really like Tomori, but I really hope that MC destroys her once they realize that the school is actually a farm for researching their powers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Were we? I thought that it was only sometime around episode 2 that someone on 2ch discovered the words "time travel" in the opening theme?</br>  <br><br>Probably because the MC can absorb the knowledge of the people he possessions.<br>Just look at what happened during batting.</br></br></br>  <br> camera was set aside and still running, coincidentally positioned to capture MC as he faints <br> Misa picks up the camera wondering if her nice hit was caught on tape <br> checks the latest video, it's of MV fainting in Nao's arms <br> Nao hugs him for a split second then goes to the position they were in when he woke up </br></br></br></br>  This episode is more evidence that they only make dangerous people transfer schools.<br><br>Sonic's power is destructive as fuck, MC nearly killed people, and Misa has a dangerous personality.</br></br>  <br>Really? How relevant is the OP to the actual show? Will most things come true that's hinted there?<br><br>Some kind of on the run plot coming up?</br></br></br>  <br>There is no time travel involved, the "2ch" anons are simple eating up the red herrings in the OP like the people new to anime usually do. Also nothing bad will happen to imouto.</br>  <br>They don't have to get them to join the school though.</br>  Is pizza sauce on everything really that bad? Maybe it isn't!  <br>Only of those with powers though? Because he'd be a literal genius by nao since he possessed all the smart people in school.</br>  <br>I love it.</br>  Who is this?  <br> by nao </br>  I want to know what kind of weird shit happens if MC possesses Yusa.  <br>Looks like a blind nigga and some delinquents.</br>  <br>Usually it does hint at things to come. Like Steins;Gate or Psycho-Pass 1 (can't comment on 2, 'cause I haven't finished it yet).<br><br>And Maeda has said in an interview that there's gonna be a shift in tone (to a darker/serious one) around the 6th/7th episode. Given that we don't know much about Tomori's benefactor, it's safe to assume that s/he's probably one of the antagonists of the show. Plus, there's a promotional poster that shows two characters (looks like MC and imouto) in what looks like a hospital. I can't find it right now, but it's in the archives.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that waterguy, second from the left?</br>  <br>Good point. Maybe I'm just wary of the school setting, since we're talking about Mr. Angel Beats here.<br><br><br>Maybe it is a red herring, maybe it isn't.

These symptoms are not accounted for by substance abuse, seizures, other medical conditions, nor by imaginative play in children.[2] Diagnosis is often difficult as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders. Malingering should be considered if there is possible financial or forensic gain, as well as factitious disorder if help-seeking behavior is prominent.</br>  <br>I want to see a love triangle where sanic falls for Misa.</br>  <br>MC clearly sees Nao as a woman since he was all flustered with their skinship</br>  <br>I want sanic to have his own harem.</br>  <br>Mary Sue will break, she feels guilty because she indirectly caused imouto to be kidnapped/get killed.<br>She will turn a deredere puppy.<br>I hope the MC just ignore it and stick with Yusa</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize how fucking dumb this argument is? When you are instituted at a psychiatric hospital, they diagnose you with as many problems as possible because mental illnesses are similar to normal behavior (but differ in certain ways). They aren't as easy to diagnose as "let me google that!" and this process helps to try and find the actual illness that's affecting a person. As doctors evaluate you, they start taking away the illness labels (or add more) depending on if you actually have the illnesses or were mislabeled. Further, humans don't act the same in every situation and are affected by many factors in how they act, this is a psychological fact that anyone who took basic psychology in high school would know. This is known as Role Theory. Googling 1 psychological illness and putting up symptoms doesn't prove shit. Everyone shows symptoms of every god damn psychological problem, but the acceptation with you is that you actually have all the psychological illnesses.</br>  <br><br><br>you will see a love triangle between Megane-Sunohara-kun, Benefactor-kun and Shirou-kun.<br>Perfect end to Megane-Sunohara-kun</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yusa <br> Not best girl <br>are you even trying?</br></br></br>  <br>Just look at that smug face. I wonder if she would still have it after getting face fucked.</br>  <br>It's easy to delude yourself into thinking Nao is best girl since she's shoved down our throats but it takes a man of good taste to realize Yusa is best girl. My guess is that in 4 years people will start realizing that Yusa was actually best girl.</br>  <br>Yusa has breasts.<br>Tomori has no chest</br></br>  <br>That is a valid argument, however it does go down to individual preferences. I prefer girls that aren't just for show and are more independent, able to think for themselves. Although one of the con is that they are more bossy than others, as in Nao, but I find that cute and  sometimes  easy to get around.</br>  <br>What the fuck with that awful color?</br>  <br>Breasts are for babies. Thighs and ass are for men. It's more enjoyable during  cuddling </br>  <br>tumblr</br>  i always find myself rooting against the main cast and for the random people with special powers  So, this is shit.  <br>is fat and cellulite.<br>Tomori is a glutton who loves meat.<br>It is only a matter of time before she turn an obese.<br>probably when to stop growing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>she also willingly distances herself from everyone<br><br>most likely for attention too since she's an attention craving bitch</br></br></br>    Why do nips like baseball? It's so fucking gay.  <br>I might agree with you if you said Misa but Yusa doesn't really do shit except be even more token moe than the sister</br>  <br>Why are we still doing these shitty Kokoro Connect parallels<br><br>Don't ruin either series for me, I'm begging you</br></br></br>  <br>There is no parallel.<br>2ch.net and read about the contents of the radio program.<br>When asked which character Tomori asemelha more, Ayane said Nagase Iore.</br></br></br>  Did 2ch confirm an already obvious route between Nao and Yuu?  <br>Blame the US, they introduced baseball to them and like it.</br>  <br>This is from the archives:<br><br> Nao sees Yu initially as just a pervert. She herself is also cold and rude. Their personalities are completely incompatible at the start. As the story goes along, Yu's cool side, as well as Nao's cute side will be shown. When it comes to it, if their dissimilarities are not shown in the beginning, their feelings for each other will seem weak later on in the story. <br><br>Now, I'm not sure what they mean by MC's "cool" side, because he was already pretty cool in the first episode but is essentially in Nao's servitude, but we'll see what happens.</br></br></br></br></br>  Felt like this episode was trying to be One Outs and failed horribly.  <br>Didn't the 4koma series hint that already?</br>  <br><br>I like Papa John's, or at least I did back when I used to eat pizza.<br><br>Digiorno's &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all pizza places though</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She reminds me of my aunt, who is single, never had a successful relationship, and has a bunch of cats.</br></br>  <br>my boner didn't knew he wanted this</br>  <br>Seem weak huh? Better than nothing. Thanks.</br>  Imouto don't have Key AIDS, she just eat too much pizza sauce.  <br><br>Nao is manipulative, kinda childish, and generally doesn't give a fuck what people think. She's been the same since her introduction.</br></br>  <br>Ouch. I wanna to throw her a bone for showing us her vegetable brother but...</br>  <br>I want Misa to fall hard for Sanic only for the two to realize the relationship could never work out. Though I'd welcome some asspull where she comes back from the dead</br>  <br>No. Let her stay dead.<br><br>I do kinda want a weird love triangle between Misa, Yusa, and Sanic though.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I don't really get the "weak" part either. It's pretty much non-existent if you ask me. Not that they don't interact or anything (as evidenced by this latest episode) but I'm just not sure how they'll pull it off.<br> <br>A ton of us subscribe to the belief that the MC is eventually gonna have to choose between Tomori and imouto. However, at the moment, I just don't see why MC would pick Nao over his sister, because they're not even close. If he does pick his sister, then how the hell is he gonna develop that relationship with Tomori? If he picks Nao, then it's either A) he thinks his sister's life is meaningless because he picked someone who is essentially a stranger or B) he thinks he can find a way to save imouto.<br><br>Maybe I'm just being cynical here, but given that the shift in tone is around the 6th or 7th episode, and that it would most likely involve either MC, imouto or Tomori (or maybe all three), the fact that there's little to no chemistry between the two at the moment terrifies me, but not because of the possibility of imouto being harmed. Rather, I'm kinda anxious of the fact that they'll probably just find a hamfisted way of creating chemistry between the two, because there's not a ton of time left before the change in tone and pacing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well I just realized their powers leave eventually so him falling for Misa would be short lived. If he ends up with Yusa it would work out since Misa possessing her will stop within a few years. It just has to be one or the other, for me. It'll feel wrong for him to be in love with Misa while Yusa is the one assuming control of the body most of the time. <br><br>I feel what would be best would be him falling for Yusa, Yusa falling for him, Misa vehemently disapproving of the situation. The final thing will be Misa finally giving her blessing to the two right before her final possession of Yusa.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I see a lot of anons going on about how Nao ruined the MC, but he was pretty much a lesser version of her. Her relationship to him is one of superiority. Until she's out of the picture, asshole/villain Yuu isn't coming back. He is Nao's pawn. That is his life now.</br></br>  <br> powers leave eventually <br><br>Not the same anon, but are we really sure about this? These anons have presented a very interesting idea:<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You really have no idea what you're talking about. The only character in the show that could be categorized under DID is Yusa and even then it's not the same.</br></br>  <br>And if Nao is gone, what happens since he's been dragged and told he'll be safe there, only to suddenly have this asshole protector gone?</br>  <br> He is Nao's pawn. <br><br>I really like Nao, but holy fuck that is sad. I don't know how MC, or anyone really, puts up with her. Then again, that's why nobody eats with her during lunch, so she does have a sadder life. Still doesn't give her the right to be a bitch though.</br></br></br>  <br>Powers may be able to stay but I bet sacrifices must be made in order to keep them. I thought the powers had something to do with puberty, like they show up during puberty. Maybe if a way was found to increase the duration of puberty you'd have powers forever.<br><br>As for having "complete" powers, I always liked the thought that there was a person out there with the second half of your power. You're both incomplete but when together you can use your powers "complete"ly</br></br></br>  <br> He is Nao's pawn. That is his life now <br>That's why nobody love her and want to be her friend.<br>The saddest is that she probably that she's aware of that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm still not buying all that "safe from the evil scientists" bullshit. She seems to have her own agenda, especially after the recent episode.</br></br>  <br>Nao sees Yu as a non perverted cheater.<br>He is referring to the true personality the MC, before having his memory tampered with.<br>Remember the MC sometimes acts out of your character.<br>Example in episode 2 on the bus and in episode 4 he was happy when they won the game.<br>episode two he said: This is not like me.<br>episode four he said: why is it that I stayed happy with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Left to right:<br> no fucking clue <br> water dude <br> this guy <br> nao's brother <br> misa </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought him being happy was akin to the Grinch growing a heart</br>  <br>But... what does she want from him?</br>  <br><br>If you're going to put it that way, nobody has the right to be a bitch. Some people just are.</br></br>  <br>That's not a bad comparison.<br><br>Indeed. Just because you're sad doesn't mean you should be a little shit.</br></br></br>  <br>It could be Yuu fails to save his sister and in that pain, turns to Nao for comfort. After his angst period is over he becomes a badass who is also a lot more sensitive now.<br><br>Or something like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Could be both</br>  <br> Maybe if a way was found to increase the duration of puberty you'd have powers forever. <br><br>Interesting. I don't really know how they're gonna explain things, but extending puberty to extend one's powers is a definite possibility.<br><br>There's also something about Tomori's favourite band playing an important role. Maybe they're the ones in the OP?<br><br>Anyway, here's the thread translating the important parts from the magazine:<br>128213838<br><br><br> The saddest is that she probably that she's aware of that. <br>I really hope she does. I like her, but beyond her intellect and her cuteness, she doesn't really have a ton of other redeeming qualities.<br><br>Sometimes people need a dose of reality to realize that they're fucking assholes. MC already had his when he met a bigger asshole than he is. Plus he has imouto, so he does have someone that can bring him back to his senses.<br><br><br> He is referring to the true personality the MC, before having his memory tampered with. <br><br>That's another thing that they have to address.<br><br>Maybe MC is really just an asshole, but some repressed memories trigger his out-of-character moments, or maybe it's the other way around (he's genuinely nice but he acts guarded and assholish all the time because of those repressed memories).<br><br><br>Don't get me wrong. People have a right to bitch and complain, but only under the right circumstances. <br><br>Again, I really like Nao, but having a sad life since middle school doesn't and shouldn't give her the right to be a manipulative bitch who lashes out at anyone who isn't willing to put up with her whims.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop creating fanwank, already mentioned in one interview that Yusa will fall in love with MC.<br>Accept the facts, the your Megane-kun loved is only the character idiot and stupid for comic relief</br></br>  <br>yea she'll fall for him first but then realize the error in her ways</br>  <br> Getting 2 more girl to my harem <br>Love you too, babe.</br></br>  <br>Most people have made this conclusion by now, but it bears repeating: the fact that we still don't know who Nao's benefactor is gives off a wrong vibe. If we've been introduced to him/her already, then there would be less suspicion as to what s/he does, but again, we don't know who s/he is.<br><br>I won't be surprised if the benefactor is part of the group of the "bad" scientists.<br><br>If that conjecture is correct, that wouldn't it be right to assume that MC is gonna lash out at Nao because she indirectly caused harm to MC and imouto? I mean, she was the one who forced MC to transfer schools and join the student council. I wouldn't be surprised if the scientists and the benefactor are remotely observing them and watching their powers grow so that they can eventually harvest these abilities or some shit like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm surprised that no one has called her out on her attitude. I think anyone would eventually lose their patience and just lash out at her. But nope. Nothing yet.</br>  <br>I was thinking more:<br>Speedbro loves Yusa but Misa loves speedbro. Meh.<br><br><br>Ok so we're going to have expect a strained relationship. What'll heal the wounds?</br></br></br></br></br>  This show feels so early-mid 00s for some reason. Maybe the style of comedy.  <br>MC will probably call her on her shit when some really bad fuck up happens.</br>  <br>only have two heroines, how you think will be the routes of visual novel.<br>AB had a bunch of girls, it would not matter, more charlotte has only 2 girls.</br></br>  <br>Jun Maeda. Same with his works, especially LB!</br>  This anime is so fucking bad. But that was to be expected after the masterpiece that Shirobako was. <br><br>PA Works always has to alternate between masterpieces and total garbage</br></br>  I thought the split personality bitch was supposed to lose her other side but she still has the split personality thing going on. What gives.   Little sister dies or gets kidnapped <br> Flashbacks to all the moments they eat together <br> MC drinks the pizza sauce while crying <br><br>Calling it now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>tick tock cycle</br>  <br>sooner or later it would disappear.</br>  <br>It's not the end of puberty yet bwaka</br>  otp  <br>Speaking of harems, I'm surprised no one has approached MC yet. I want smug MC back just to see how he'll pick his girls this time around.<br><br><br>I don't think you should expect anything. It's pretty much just conjecture (albeit some very valid possibilities, considering the promotional materials, the various interviews, the OP having clues and some possible red herrings too).<br><br> What'll heal the wounds? <br><br>Dunno.

I think I only know two exceptions, once in baki and another time in Tough otherwise you just never see them.<br><br>Then you have all these 'what if' stories about going back in time/changing history/altering the course of the war that just reeks of an oudated, pathetic clinging onto of nationalistic sentiment. <br><br>You never see the Germans glorifying the nazis/hitler but that shit seems to fly just fine with the japs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate this so much.<br>In western media, works that have the mafia or criminal gangs as main characters will never portray the mafia as good things for society. They'll show that the gang members are people that care about their families and sometimes show that they had no choice but to turn to crime, but at the end of the day, all they do is hurt others and do evil things. Just watch the Godfather trilogy, Breaking Bad or the Sopranos.<br>In the west we enjoy works about criminals, but we never think of them as anything but criminals.<br>Why does a society that is so much more conformist to the rules like Japan glorify criminals that commit murder, drug dealing and human trafficking so much?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What redeeming qualities of a yandere are you talking about? There are none, 2d or 3d</br>    <br> You never see the Germans glorifying the nazis/hitler but that shit seems to fly just fine with the japs. <br>Again, it's less Japan glorifying the era and more Japan refusing to accept any responsibility for the era, never talking about it</br></br>  <br>America sees crime as a part of life. It happens all the time. When you see stuff on the news about riots and violence, you begin to recognize it. Plus, America went through a recession and has way more ethnicities, which leads to some resorting to crime in order to live.<br>Japan's cleanliness and conformity makes crime less prominent in society's view, so people glorify it more.</br></br>  <br>It also helps that the Yakuza still hold a lot of sway in Japan's entertainment industry and other sectors.<br>American gangsters are nowhere near as influential, Big Business is in charge and doesn't need gunmen to get what it wants</br></br>  <br>Plus, in order to be part of the mafia, you need to be part Italian, which isn't as prominent after multiple generations. Yakuza members want Japanese people, which there are a pretty large supply of in Japan.</br>  <br><br>This is why I hate Nisekoi. They treat the criminal gangs as goofy lovable characters instead of the corrupt evil criminals they truly are, and Raku feels no guilt about profiting from other people's misery whatsoever yet is a "nice guy"</br></br>  <br>You mean that I could be petting them and then they suddenly fucking bite me for no reason and run off?</br>  Peeping on girls, stealing their underwear and groping them is acceptable "boys will be boys" behaviour and women who get angry about it and yell BAKA HENTAI are just overreacting  <br>I'm sure it has been okay to assault perverts in anime since the early 80s.</br>  <br>But the perverts are portrayed as just being boys doing boy things because they're in their springtime of youth or whatever. It's portrayed as just being a harmlessdumb thing like drinking alcohol or something, not like a crime</br>  <br> Again, it's less Japan glorifying the era and more Japan refusing to accept any responsibility for the era, never talking about it <br>They can't glorify it openly for obvious reasons, but they do in a subtle way, that's not actually so subtle. But I do agree that they refuse responsibility for their actions during and prior to WW2.</br></br>  <br>Considering that those types of characters are usually met with some kind of comeuppance and their male peers rarely ever act the same way, I never got the impression that it was perfectly normal.</br>    <br>But that's not a lie. You really can buy a lot of porn on DVD.</br>  <br> i dont think we would ever see master roshi again if he found the internet </br>  <br>Honestly, I doubt he could get a connection on his island.</br>  <br> They can't glorify it openly for obvious reasons, but they do in a subtle way, that's not actually so subtle <br>Such as?</br></br>  <br> Such as? <br>Literally almost any /a/ related media that focuses around that particular era (early-mid 20th century), especially if the military is involved.</br></br>  <br>Even Miyazaki. He made a movie set in WWII that glossed over all that horrible stuff to focus on airplane engineer</br>  <br> He made a movie set in WWII that glossed over all that horrible stuff to focus on airplane engineer <br>Well, in the air rises he actually does point out MC being 'critical' of the war - but that's usually as far as the 'criticism' will go. <br><br>Usually if it's not just full out nationalistic, we're better than everyone else, nippon 2 stronk, then it usually involves a gary stu-ish character making japan look good while they complain about the war, but do nothing to actively resist it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. If they can compress matter into capsules, the moon turns saiyans into giant apes, and they can change their hair color from black to spiked blonde at will, then I wouldn't be surprised if they found a way to get him a connection.</br>  <br><br>In other words yeah they oversimplify a lot of the horrors that occurred during that period while making themselves look as good as possible, while trying to save some moral face by having the awesome MC state how he's against the war (yet does nothing productive to detract from it).<br><br>It really makes me wonder if they even bother to teach the Japanese youth about what really happened during those times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember this one movie a gary-stuish MC who had a Girlfriend who played some instrument before he left that became a Kamikaze pilot using a plane called the Rose or something that was portrayed as heroic and decisive in the war against the americans. The MC was the only handsome one, all the other Japanese soldiers wer goofy looking but portrayed symapthetically.<br>God I hated it, but I can't remember what it was called</br></br>  <br> atomic radiations give birth to monsters in anime <br> atomic radiations make people superheroes in capeshit <br>See a pattern here?</br></br></br>  <br>The kamikaze caused a lot of unecessary death on both sides of the conflict and because of the stubborn attitude of the Japanese towards surrender they had to suffer through the atomic bombings. There's heroism, and then there's stupidity.<br><br>To be fair though, the masses were probably very well brainwashed and conditioned by the imperial government, though that does not in any way detract from their sins.</br></br></br>  <br>It's kind of weird given the old man's opinion that the Japanese haven't apologized nearly enough.</br>  <br>Not to mention, many commanders killed themselves whenever they lost a battle even when they were in no danger of being captured, meaning that veteran leaders died and people with far less experience were put in charge.<br>Another problem is that units kept lying to their superiors about their battles, making themselves look better and claiing they killed loads of Americans, leading to misinformation which actually benefited the Allies</br></br>  <br>That's why I find it weird that somebody would make an anime movie years later glorifying the kamikazes</br>  <br> Germans glorifying the nazis/hitler <br>That's because, last I checked, it was pretty illegal for a german citizen to produce a work even involving Nazis. Isn't the entire Wolfenstein series banned in Germany? I know the finnish Iron Sky crew had to sign multiple permits just to get the Nazi costumes into the country so they could shoot film on-site</br></br>  <br>I know a lot of germans and they all seem to be of the same opinion that noone except maybe a few crazy people want to glorify the nazis/hitler, but yes it is illegal in the country. I've heard stories of people denouncing their german citizenship and moving to other countries after the war to get as far away from the memory as you can. A few other college educated gentleanons told me things of the nature 'you just can't legitimize or glorify the nazi regime no matter which way you look at it.' <br><br>Funny thing is I started asking around for german opinion on the matter because I was curious if they viewed the war in a similar light to how the japanese seem to (glorified, guilty-free, nippon stronk, etc.)<br><br><br><br><br>Yeah.<br><br>The only other trope in /a/ related media that I can't stand is extremist moralfag views <br> hurrrrr killing is bad </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was probably an episode of The Cockpit OVA.</br>  <br>High school girls are cute.</br>  <br>  it is illegal in the country <br>Makes me wonder how Iron Sky managed to loophole their way into having the film debut in Berlin itself, or hell, how they managed to film Der Untergang</br></br>  <br>Probably got permission, or we're not understanding the law correctly.</br>  The heart goes where the heart wills  <br>It really depends. Portraying kamikaze pilots as otherwise normal people isn't really glorifying the act. In fact, it just makes it worse.</br>  <br>Yakuza aren't even illegal, and the word literally means "loser".<br>I'm sure some series overdo it but Yakuza are not the same as American criminals. And as for protecting their hometowns, even American criminals do that. My local gang keeps my town safe as fuck and even protects refugees from other towns.</br></br>  <br> implying peeping on girls isn't harmless </br>  <br>Really the people that watch it are the more extreme of otakus, NEETs etc. which is like 80% of this site, so comments like that will be met with anger</br>  <br> It really makes me wonder if they even bother to teach the Japanese youth about what really happened during those times. <br>They don't.</br></br>  <br>Isn't "yakuza" pretty much a word only used by non-Japanese anyway?</br>  <br> They don't. <br>That's really disappointing to me because it downplays and outright neglects the impact that war had on the entire world, not only on Japan. Yes we should move on from the past, but we should not forsake the lessons we garnered from it lest we repeat our own mistakes. Germany on the other hand seems very sincere and remorseful and I can empathize with their country for that.</br></br>  Highschool SOL scenarios to pander to the otaku's who had a mediocre or worse school life.

Yes.<br> In Denmark <br> in the news, there are wolves that came up from Germany and are eating sheep <br> "why don't the farmers just shoot them?" <br> people think this is ridiculous and assure me that the farmers are compensated by the government anyway <br>I'll keep and enjoy the freedom to not subsidize immigrant animals with my tax dollars, thank you very much.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dostedt </br>  When compared to dating your sibling, dating your cousin is pretty much not incest  <br>Art gets some special treatment.<br>Movies are usually ok, so are books.<br>Comics and video games are, however, not art, as far as the fossils who decide are concerned, therefore they get the banhammer (kinda, you can still get uncensored comics normally if you buy them in english, like the Hellsing manga, I orfered it from german amazon in english - and possession is completely ok).<br>Sometimes it happens that stuff is removed for littl reasons, however, usually in TV-shows, as they are less seen as art as movies.<br>It's fucking bullshit, I very much support the ban on public display in serious context, but censoring Hellsing, banning Wolfenstein and removing a scene from a Simpsons episode helps fucking no one. A blind idiot can see that that's no Nazi propaganda.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cousin x cousin bears little risk, as long as it's not the norm for generations.</br>  <br>But anon,  I have a penis. </br>  <br>The Yakuza are pretty much a pest, their constant poking in markets and similar things regularly causes the japanese economy huge problems.</br>  <br>I wonder what Japan will try and do about the Yakuza once the Olympics start coming closer and closer.</br>  <br>Marrying your cousin is legal in almost the entire world.</br>  <br> then there's stupidity <br>The whole japanese campaign in WWII was a disaster and massive display of incompetence, from beginning to end. They were about as good as the fucking Italians, just less surrendery.<br>The only reason they even had successes is that they fought a massively inferior nation and several colonies whose motherlands were busy fighting the Nazis. And China strained their forces way too much. <br>They had technology, but pretty much nothing else.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never thought I would ever be glad about our wasps. But I found out about those things.</br>  <br>They give the enemy troops really bad haircuts?</br>  <br>Japan being super special and important internationally, for no fucking reason, and everything happens in Japan or concerns Japan.<br>Yes, Americlaps do it, and it can be quite annyoing at times. But since the USA is pretty much the number one Hegemon it's also justified.<br>Maybe all countries do it, but as far as I've seen the Brits don't inflate their importance like that. I don't think Germans do (gee, why?), no idea about France.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly that sounds like hyperbole. Anime is considered to be for kids and teenagers even in Japan, so it's a give that there would be tons of anime with a highschool setting, they're targeting their main demographic.</br></br>    <br>Nobody ever chooses to be the salaryman, it's just the safety net every japanese man has once his initial ambitions and plans(if he even had any in the first place) die.<br><br>Being a salaryman is the mark of the average, of the mediocre, of the broken man. That's why they all look dead inside.</br></br></br>  <br>Japanese subways are packed full of guys in suits. I look at the young ones and think "you're already dead"</br>  <br> subsidize immigrant animals with my tax dollars <br>That sentence would have taken a whole different meaning if you had been talking about Sweden</br></br>  <br>Yes, it would seem that way</br>  <br>No wonder their suicide rate is high as fuck.</br>  <br>That's not intimacy, that's just dumbasses being dumb in public. <br><br>I mean like in the post-dicking cuddling when she's feeling like a million bucks because she had an orgasm and the man she loves came inside her. That sort of intimacy</br></br></br>   Shy girls are very lewd.   <br>But that's true</br>  It's perfectly normal and common for a half-Japanese person to have blonde/red hair and blue/green eyes.  <br>Nation-wide inferiority complex</br>  <br>Human are the monsters<br>BRAVO UROBUCHI</br></br>  bump  <br>That's true, though.</br>  <br>Anime is basically those 50s PSAs when it comes to drugs</br>   little boys have huge penis   <br>That it's "slice of life", implying that real life could ever be as perfect as some of the series portray.</br>  <br>That some people have superior skills because of their cool ancestors. <br>That monarchy/aristocracy will be the future of humanity.</br></br>  <br>Do you seriously think these are wrong?<br>You gotta be kidding me. <br>We all know that aristocracy is master race.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I could post that LoGH screencap, but I don't have it right now. Have some Oberstein.</br>  <br> a convenient assassin service <br>If yanderes could follow specific orders, that'd be their greatest appeal. Instead they just have very wild interpretations of what you mean and end up fucking things up even worse.</br></br>  <br>You're just salty because nobody would allow you to browse the internet all day long anymore.</br>  <br>That all applies to all forms of visual media</br>  <br>I just don't let like to see some people dressed in Victorian dresses in the fucking future, while being loyal to fucking monarch.</br>  That your dick can still be as hard as diamonds after coming even without the use of Viagra and you cum buckets in seconds.  <br> Aristocracy is equal to wearing Victorian dresses <br><br>You sure did your homework. <br>And it isn't being loyal to some monarch either.<br>Get your facts straight before making claims.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember reading some stuff about gangsters back then having connections to Hollywood.</br>  That you can molest girls in the subway and they are too shy to rattle you out.  <br>I don't give a shit about cousins because that's genetically inconsequential and people generally only see cousins a couple times a year so there's no real family bond anyway. Just stay away from immediate family members god dammit.</br>  <br>It's weird because in America, a lot of people see high school as a shitty time and college/uni as one of the best times of their lives.</br>  <br>I think for the most part /a/nons are self aware enough not to make a fuss over their obvious lackluster station in society.</br>  <br>Fucking love the American redneck stereotype of inbreds.</br>  <br>Next, they'll say you can OD on marijuana.</br>  <br>It's fine. Male tsundere is better anyway.</br>  <br>They're trying to imply that they don't exist in anime, which is entirely false.</br>  <br>In that particular case it's more like Nasu being Nasu. Also that movie's overrated as fuck, one of the week KnK movies for sure.</br>  <br>Gay Priest is here now</br>  <br><br>Pretty much<br><br><br>Dunno why they always jump in front of trains though. It just fucks up everyone else. It's so common on my line it's referred to as "chuocide"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure they're actively trying to prevent him from discovering it.</br>  <br> I'm assuming, gloss over the whole "small pox blankets" things too <br>I can confirm that it doesn't really get mentioned. In the first grade, they teach you how Columbus came over, met the locals and then they held hands and started singing Kumbayah. Then they don't get a single mention until the point where they get sick of the white man's shit.</br></br>  <br> girls aren't repulsed by non-alpha males <br>Don't be /r9k/<br><br>They aren't repulsed by non-alphas, they are repulsed by desperation. They can smell it in the air the same way a shark can smell blood in the water</br></br></br></br>  <br>Abe go home</br>  <br>Tasogare Otome x Amnesia isn't any less childish than your average series.</br>  <br>Japs never deny their imperialism though. They're refusing to apologize fully knowing that, which makes it all the more glorious when Chinese and Koreans get butthurt about it.<br><br>The only thing pertaining to war crimes that Japs deny is the number of victims in Nanking, not even the act itself.</br></br></br>  <br>I imagine it's not that easy to gain access to the roof of a tall building in Japan</br>  <br>Good point but that doesn't stop ODing, cutting, a noose, a trip to aokigahara, a cliff or good ol' hara kiri</br>  <br>Fuck off.

She wants to fuck Souma's dad, but doesn't know he's Souma's dad, so she'll probably want to fuck Souma too once she's realizes. Only Ameritits and Moeblob have shown any romantic interest in Souma so far, and Moeblob only just recently.  I wonder what "Have you worshiped Erina-sama today yet" anon thinks about this.  <br>Moeblob is more like, admiration. Ameritits is head over heels about Souma tho.</br>  Shit scans never.  Wait, is Erina actually the official love interest of the MC?<br><br>I thought it would be Tadokoro, because she's cliched enough to make it work. And you know how the Japanese love their cliches.</br></br>  <br>That one looks great. It makes me want to get one and I'm not even a Erinafag.</br>  <br>Do you have like, zero sense for storybuilding?</br>  <br>I'm wondering if they quit now.<br><br><br>5th Erina figure?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>why would anyone want this bitch to win? <br><br>why not root for the girl that actually likes him and hasn't been a bitch since the beginning?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Erina a shit. Megumi is the only actual perfect candidate for Souma, and Meat is 10/10 breeding stock. Why waste your time with a subpar bitch who wants to fuck your dad?</br>  Why care about Erina if Tadokoro is so much better?  <br>There is no official love interest. All girls in this series can be considered a love interest. The most popular girl will win.</br>  <br>  Liking Meat </br>  Right now Erina respects his skill butt hates his style and methods and goes full spaghetti when talking to him. But unlike in the election she is in full "you are never allowed to fail ever" mode because he wormed his way into minor cooking fame.  <br> All girls in this series can be considered a love interest <br> All girls <br>Really anon?</br></br></br>  <br>She's actually developing at a really nice rate. In the latest arc she manages to have a conversation with Soma without being a bitch, she was even somewhat helpful. It helps that Hisako (due to plot reasons) goes wingman mode for Soma. I think the turn is being made very believable.</br>  <br>A Fumio-san ending is coming. I can feel it.</br>  <br> All girls <br>No.</br></br>  <br>I like Megumi better than Erina but the chemistry and interactions Erina has with Souma is more entertaining for me.</br>  <br>This. It will take many moons.</br>  <br> All girls </br>  anyone actually want to discuss the manga instead of devolving into the usual best girl/ takumi takumi shitposting?    <br><br>It's a Jump manga. Just by being the poster girl she has a 99 percent of winning. Although at the current pace, It'll be a while for anything romantic to happen.</br></br>  <br> All girls in this series can be considered a love interest <br>We read the same manga?</br></br>  <br> Ryoko wants the Smokebowl. <br> Yuuki doesn't care. <br> Alice will probably get Ryou   or Hayama <br> Hisako, Houjou and Nao are bro tier. <br> all girls. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Nisekoi is Jump's, too <br> Tadokoro = Onodera <br> Erina = Chitoge <br><br>I see.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   muh MEHgumi getting friendzoned   <br> Nisekoi: Cooking Edition <br><br>Excepting the fact that Chitoge is a huge bitch <br>And that Tadokoro admires Souma but doesn't love him deeply or anything   Yet  </br></br></br></br>  No one will win, you fools. Have you learned nothing?  <br>*Isn't<br>Fuck me</br></br>  <br>The author said someone will win.</br>  Doesn't seem like anything definitively romantic will happen ever. It'll probably end with some generic timeskip ending where the girls welcome Souma back from some world training thing.<br><br><br>She definitely loves him. She's had a few of those "why did Souma-kun just flash through my mind and why is my heart going doki doki" moments already.</br></br></br>    <br>only two girls have romantic interest in him at the moment, and Meat was a bitch at the beginning. So you are rooting for Kurase. Interesting choice.</br>  <br>My feelings are so hurt that I guess I'll stop posting forever.</br>  <br>  She definitely loves him <br>The author says otherwise</br></br>  <br>Gonna need a link to something dude.</br>  I need proofs that display souma's skills as a lolimancer.  <br> She definitely loves him. She's had a few of those "why did Souma-kun just flash through my mind and why is my heart going doki doki" moments already. <br>No (word of god)</br></br>  <br> jun　　　  will turn soumasexual soon enough</br>  <br> Oh, and during that talk they also mentioned Erina is not actually Souma's true route but just the first candidate for it (and that Ikumi has two older brothers, but I guess that's kinda trivial) <br> When they were talking about that topic they only made it clear that the girl who Souma will end up with isn't set on stone yet <br> What they did mention about Megumi is that she's not actually in love with Souma yet, that so far she just admires him <br><br>Source: Eru13, Casanova's translator.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask casanova translator</br>  <br>Around which chapter was this? Because this shit seems plain as day.</br>  <br>Post Autumn Election's</br>  True route is  Takumi's boypussy   <br> When they were talking about that topic they only made it clear that the girl who Souma will end up with isn't set on stone yet <br>So...aka I'll choose the ship when I need to end the series. I hope my fans enjoy the wars and keep reading my shit until then.</br></br>  <br>Souma lost his chance  now that's gigganigga's </br>  <br>And you'll still read it every week. Those dicks!</br>  <br>More like, Erina is the default, but I can change my mind whenever I want to and pick candidate #2 or #3 or whichever.</br>  Erina a shit.<br><br>Worse than Emi and Kirino.</br></br>  Where are shit scans at? Even black clover gets translated quicker than SnS why?  <br>this<br><br>why are people assuming that Megumi has a romantic interest on Souma?</br></br></br>  <br>We're always the last one to get translations. At least we don't need to wait until Monday for Viz  sometimes. </br>  <br>To be fair, it's basically a given that both she and Erina will eventually.<br><br>Unlike what some people think though, I don't believe Tsukuda will stack more girls in though. The series has a bunch of other good looking, talented guys. Unlike harem series which tend to have a passable MC and ugly, useless, or super perverted side guys to try to make sense of all the girls liking one guy instead of having different tastes in guys.</br></br></br>  I "root" for Megumi to elevate the levels butthurt when their delusions are outright denied.  <br>It literally says chapter 61 on the scan</br>  <br>I know his phrasing is odd, but he's asking when jump festa was, which another anon already answered.</br>  We'll never get scans of this, right?  <br> during that talk <br>Was this an interview? Can I read/watch it somewhere?</br></br>  <br>Is it new? Because maybe. We've been getting more scans lately.</br>  <br>Yes, it was at Jump Festa. <br>https://mangahelpers.com/forum/show<wbr>thread.php/2999410-Shokugeki-no-Som<wbr>a-103-Discussion-104-Predictions/pa<wbr>ge12<br>Read Eru13's posts.</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>It will be out at Comiket 88.</br>  <br> The most popular girl will win. <br><br>So Erina then?<br><br>She basically disappeared for like 60 chapters (or however long the Fall arc was) and still beat every other girl by a good margin.</br></br></br></br></br>  So while we are still stuck waiting for a translation, in this arc, we still need to learn what Kuga's deal with Tsukasa is, what Eizan and Rindou are up to, and who the mysterious figure Souma gave a key to is, right?  <br> they also mentioned Erina is not actually Souma's true route but just the first candidate for it <br> they only made it clear that the girl who Souma will end up with isn't set on stone yet <br>Literally what else can they say? "Oh yeah, Erina is going to win the Soumab owl, she was going to win from the very beginning." They would have killed the manga if they said it outright because as we all know, WSJ mangafags are filthy shippers who throw autistic shitstorms when their waifu loses. Noncommittal answers are the norm in these sorts of interviews. Shit, Shokugeki is only in its second year.<br><br><br> that argument <br>Holy shit, this is why I avoid forums.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a Jump manga. Just by being the poster girl she has a 99 percent of winning. <br>Yup, just like in Ichigo 100%... oh wait.<br><br>Seriously, I don't really know why you think that's a trend.</br></br></br></br>  <br> One vote. </br>  <br>Hand was mysterious girl from chapter 117. <br>Or maybe Houjou.</br></br>  <br>is she the best prodigy in the school / or we can expect an uberchef even more amazing than her?</br>  <br>Not him but it is a trend, for what it's worth (half the manga in WSJ have asexual protags who don't even end up with a girl in the end anyway). Ichigo 100 was the exception.<br><br>Even Nurarihyon no Mago (which was set up to have the human childhood friend win) changed track and decisively went with Tsurara end, which was what everyone wanted.<br><br><br>Read the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best of the school is an autist </br>  <br>Read the manga.<br> She's only 10th seat at Elite Ten.  </br></br>  <br>I could believe Houjou since she's a big girl, but those hands were pretty big for a girl otherwise.</br>  <br>yeah but she's just in first year, she probably get first seat by the end of the year</br>  <br>There are 9 upperclassmen ranked above her. As for being best prodigy in the school, yeah, probably. The school has apparently never had a first year as strong as her.</br>  <br>Next year Isshiki or maybe Yugi will get First seat, not Erina.</br>  <br> only 10th seat <br>Reminder that she's probably better than Kuga and Eizan but got 10th because seniority.<br><br>And that white hair looks terrible on Tsukasa, they should've made it silvery like Alice's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that looks beautiful from this angle</br>  <br> Isshiki <br>almost certainly<br><br> Yugi <br>don't fuck with me, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br> Yugi <br> will probably be raped by Souma within the year, if not in this festival <br>Right.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Isshiki or Yugi next year. I don't want Yugi to be First Seat but who knows.</br>  <br><br> implying it won't be based Aizen </br></br>  <br>wrong manga m8.</br>  <br>I'm glad you realized that Orihime will win in Bleach.<br><br>Not many people know.<br><br><br>I wonder how much this costs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn that's amazing.</br>  <br>I wonder who is stronger, Aizen or Isshiki.</br>   you can finally make her taste your cum   <br>ALL ME.</br>  <br>Glad she won she was best girl and his childhood friend was shit.</br>  https://mega.nz/#F!6oBxSK6R!WE_h49q<wbr>ll-J-NjqTuJ1kaw<br><br>Recipe pages.<br><br>Was to lazy to do a proper crop and edit, if anyone want to do all that hard work, there you have it.<br>Still missing some pages, had some trouble scanning them.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>Orihime is cute.<br><br>It looks even better up close</br></br></br>  <br>Drop it. Also please consider getting some taste when watching anime.</br>  <br> dat cute smug face <br> dem thighs </br></br>  <br>She wasn't entirely dissappeared though. She was there for the most chapter on the election but mostly just a few panels and that's it. She always appeared when soma is on the stage, and when she was asked by soma to taste his stew. But yeah, she wasn't as much of an important character that time</br>  <br>I asked earlier but this is her 5th figure isn't it? Also, I see they put up a space on the official site for Meat's figure but they have no image up yet. I remember seeing the prototype for hers and Megumi's though.</br>  <br>Read the manga faggot<br><br>She doesn't want to fuck Souma's dad you illiterate, she was amazed by his cooking and wanted to taste it as a child</br></br></br>  <br> implying <br><br>We laugh at Aizen because he hadn't backed up his threats from the Autumn Election, but keep in mind Mimasaka was only one of many goons he has. And we know he's great with business. Souma must not underestimate him.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm here and I think this is amazing.<br><br>Have you worshipped Erina today, anon?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, based anon. Will you scan the missing pages later?</br>  <br> doesn't want to fuck <br> blushes every time she sees / hears about him <br> sleeps with a photo of him <br><br>Okay, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erina will get 4th - 5th seat by her second year.</br>  <br>Yep, gonna post them tomorrow.</br>  <br> Hotgluing figures <br>Fuck no that damages them.</br></br>  <br>I'm usually not a buyfag, but I may just have to get this.</br>  <br>Thanks. Now we just need to translate this and the novels  translations soon. </br>  <br>He's also up to something during the festival it seems.<br><br><br>Honestly won't be surprised if she hits 3rd. With 5 people graduating, 5th would appear to be a given though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This was said last thread or thread before last, but not every emotion a woman feels for a man has to be lust, you depraved degenerate.<br><br>He's her favorite cook and she wants to taste his food, it's called admiration.</br></br></br>  <br> anime only <br>It's taken about 130 chapters but she's finally defrosting from maximum tsun to casual tsun. <br>She'll be full dere in about 500 episodes, just you wait.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to taste her D.</br>  <br>I don't think you understand human emotion. She's shown all the signs of wanting to fuck him, all that is left is for her to meet him again.</br>  <br>Erina has no such thing</br>  Honestly I want Hisako to win because out every female character in this series she has the best chemistry with Soma. Better than Megumi's and definitely Erina. You cannot say other otherwise. I mean when both Hisako and worked together they actually looked like real couple keeping a restaurant together.<br><br>But seeing this is a Shonen manga best girl will not win and worst girl will win fucking Erina. In the millionth chance Hisako wins the Somabowl I would shit my pants.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but since it was directly addressed in the manga, she does not. Alice even asked her if she had any interest in dating this mysterious man, and Erina was confused about why on earth she would want to do that.</br>  <br>Hisako won't even fall for him.</br>  <br>Do you think she might try to rise up on her first year?</br>  <br>Eh, more like he stirred up Giga and just let him do his thing. Eizan's been pretty passive since his big threat and his personal showdown with Soma probably won't happen for a long time.<br>Especially since Kuga is probably going to wipe the floor with Soma in an actual shokugeki after Soma wins the right to d-d-d-duel him with his festival shenanigans.</br></br>  <br>No. She's a rival to be impressed, nothing more.</br>  <br>Alright c'mon, you can't be serious, fucking Hisami is more relevent than Hisako, why would she even be in the soumabowl to begin with, she was a hater of souma, she was there to represent the hatred of the student body for Souma, he showed her he wasn't just talk and helped her out without thinking about her as a obstacle or a rival, you can be delusional as a meat-fag, but Hisako, c'mon Anon.</br>  <br>Are you actually retarded?<br><br>Erina is only now being gradually introduced to the concepts of love and relationships, but you want to imply she wants to fuck Saiba?<br><br>She even asked Alice why she would ever date him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soma has chemistry with all the grills, but Hisako a best because she's the perfect interim between Dereless and Goomy.</br>  <br> chemistry <br><br>You're delusional. Contempt is not chemistry.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is Hisami?</br>  <br> false flagging <br> muh chemistry <br>You're probably one of those bandwagonfags who didn't give a shit about her before she was named. This manga hasn't even hit 150 chapters and they're all in their first year, developments happen slowly.<br><br>Christ, I hate faggots like you who proclaim the "literally perfection" girl as best and MC's fated waifu when they've no reason nor room to improve. Girls like Hisako are wonderful in their own way but it won't make for a satisfying story in the long run. Also, she would probably want Erina to win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I took a random generic Japanese name to emphasize my point</br>  <br>To be fair she was completely clueless about love at that point.</br>  <br>Dish anon, this a christian board.</br>  <br>I don't know if she has interest in the shokugeki for a seat method. She's definitely been doing the increasing her resources, influence, and standing part though. We'll have to wait and see.</br>  <br>Hisako would be the ultimate Serina shipper</br>  <br><br>Are you serious, I thought you meant Isami.</br></br>  <br>I-I knew that anon</br>  <br> Soma has chemistry with all the grills <br>This</br></br>  <br> probably thinks Erina is best girl <br><br>Even with improvements she's still going to be shit. Pretty much every girl is better than her.</br></br></br>  I imagine we'll have to wait until monday for confirmation on Sugita voicing Eizan.<br><br>He should be in the next ep on the phone with that woman, right?</br></br>  <br>Oh, I might have done that subconsciously</br>  <br>The Erina haters have arrived</br>  <br>I knew it was you when this was posted <br><br> Even with improvements she's still going to be shit <br>What does this even mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot the very 1st</br>  Am I hallucinating but where the fuck did all these Erinafags come from?  <br>It's the same deluded fuckstick, no one sane likes Erina or wishes her well.</br>  <br>Glad I waited, almost bought the bikini one.</br>  <br><br> being stuck in 2013 </br></br>  <br>will souma get the first seat?</br>  <br>You must be new here</br>  <br>He is a stupid anon that can only look at Erina for what she was in the first chapter and will ignore all development. It kinda sucks but it seems like the wrong people finally picked the anime up from their backlog and are now starting shitty waifuwars. There goes the decent threads this had.</br>  <br>Too bad for you, Erina is going to win the Soumabowl, there were more hint for this dropped troughout the whole manga than foodgasm, I'm a Yoshinofag ( that fucking exist ) but you have to be autistic to not see it</br>  <br>We've always had the largest fanbase<br><br>It's just there's tons of false flaggers and othergirlfags are more aggressive towards Erina.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe his third year. Second year he'll be seat 3 and be raging that he's not sitting in at least his dad's chair already.</br>  <br>No until 3rd year</br>  <br>  hurr durr they don't like what I like they must be insane <br>Sure anon</br></br>  What's the problem of not getting the Soumabowl?<br><br> All the boys are best boys </br></br>  <br>MMMMM yes imagine the fat loads she going to received.</br>  Would you stick your dick in crazy?  Whatever I stick my dick in becomes crazy anyway.  No  Yes  <br>It's not crazy if it's for love.</br>  <br>This anon gets it</br>  And make the daughter of a moral guardian a teen mom?<br><br>Sign me up.</br></br>  There is already a thread. Fuck off with your generals.  <br>My dick needs to be in crazy, normal just don't cut it.</br>  Depends on what you mean by crazy.  <br>But crazies cut it off, anon.</br>   This episode <br>Oh my fuck</br>  People like me can't be choosy anyway.  <br>theres two threads up already anon</br>  All these dumbasses ITT who don't know that you don't stick your dick in crazy.  <br>Sure because she is only crazy about dick</br>  <br>Only if you fuck it up. You need go pavlovian on their asses with affection, training them to not hurt you.</br>   Implying you wouldn't want a horny freak that rides you until your balls turn dry   Why would I ever stick my dick in something other than crazy?  <br>Would crazy give me a choice?</br>  <br>Practice</br>  <br>Would you say no even if it did?</br>  <br><br>If that happens, it has to be on my terms.</br></br>  <br>mebbe.<br>I'm not one for one nighters. Is crazy ready to commit? or just be committed?</br></br>  Well, it's not like you have any say in the matter.  <br><br>They can't say whether I have any say. I won't let them have their way.</br></br>  <br>If there's two threads, and you want to combine them into one (general), why are you telling your suggestion to fuck off?</br>  <br>I think we can assume by context that this particular crazy wants to be with you for some time, likely forever.</br>  <br>Be stil my beating heart!</br>  <br>shh no dreams now<br>only rape</br></br>  <br><br>I'm too rebellious for it.
