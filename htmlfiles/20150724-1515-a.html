Just in case, I was ready to post the universal-reset_Pucci.png to start over.</br>   Puccifag <br> Now there are all these shitty memes <br> It's going to be insufferable if/when 6 is animated <br>I hate all of you.</br></br></br>  <br>go for it, we killed the build up<br><br>I like fun, but its far from the funnest thing in JoJo</br></br></br>  <br>Faggot Baby is eating Gay Priest.</br>  <br>in all of jojo you're right, but for part 3 yeah.</br>  <br> when 6 is animated </br>  Would you  h ug fem-Joseph?  <br>Its not the funnest thing in Part 3,</br>  <br> go for it, we killed the build up <br>Naw, him being here is all that matters.</br></br>  <br>like what?</br>  <br>truly, gay priest is the greatest</br>  <br>I fucking hope it isn't at this rate.</br>  Gay Priest is here now.  <br>Joseph, his Engrish + his shenanigans</br>  <br>Tbh you're right. The moment 6 is animated and Pucci is first shown the Jojo threads will be nothing but Pucci_png. memes.</br>  <br>Gay Priest was already here<br/></br>  <br>I don't hug sluts</br>  <br>Do you mug them?</br>  <br>Ain't that right, brother.</br>  Reading part 4, holy shit this is great, better than part 3 by a mile, there's GREAT banter<br><br>I'm reading the part with  Cinderella  how much longer have I got? And I remember someone telling me that part 5 only has shitty translations, is that still true?</br></br>  <br>Mariah</br>  <br>Rude, she might not be the purest but it's still rude.</br>  <br>that was lewd.</br>  <br>You've got quite a bit before you end so you should enjoy it while you can. Part 5 has a good translation for a few story arcs but the rest is bad. Everything else has a good translation, though.</br>  <br>Don't remind me. I just want to cancer to get away from my favorite character. But it should be a few years, hopefully everyone has grown up by then.</br>  <br> hopefully everyone has grown up by then. <br>You're here on /a/. People come here to not grow up and shitpost. Pucci memes are still only half a year old but if it lasts till next year they're not going away.</br></br>  We all thought this was a girl<br>  for good reason too  </br>  <br> but if it lasts till next year they're not going away. <br>I give it until part 4 is animated, then the thread will be filled with shitty hair and Kira memes.</br></br>  <br>You are on a site, where the opening of a batman movie has been a meme for 4 years now.<br><br>You think Pucciposting is gonna die that easily?</br></br></br>  <br>KABUTOMUSHI is long gone so I'm quite happy about that.</br>  <br>Just maybe. The Heavenposting meme was killed by Pucciposting, so a bigger meme could overshadow it.</br>  Didn't see anyone else post the scanlation by shonengfamez yet.  <br>Has Jojo contributed to baneposting? You guys are slacking off.</br>  <br>Was in last thread</br>  <br><br>what do you guys think of Stardust in jojolion art style?</br></br>  <br>Araki did enough, Joseph wore a mask and crashed 3 planes</br>  <br><br>What made Pucci such an attractive meme over other villians though?  DIO has been a meme for years so he doesn't really count in this. </br></br>    <br><br><br>Oh you're right.</br></br></br>  <br> that Avdol <br>never<br><br>Perfect</br></br></br></br>  <br>Saying thanks again for new wallpaper doc</br>  <br>I'd fuck that Abdul tbh</br>  <br>Not according to Fujos.<br><br><br>Better be fuckloads of DBZ references if we ever get a Part 4 anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's pretty cute. Just imagine him with that look but the same voice as the anime though.</br>  Jesus Fucking Christ  <br> Not according to Fujos. <br>I still don't get what attracts them to him. Polneraf is better fujo fuel than him.</br></br>  <br>Yes. Dio is tried and true meme himself.</br>  <br>mobsters man</br>  <br>I know right, dude looks like a lady</br>  <br>I didn't realize till now that imgur made the images I uploaded in PNG have actually turned into Jpegs. This one should have a bit more quality.</br>  <br>Please respond</br>  <br>Turns out to be Diavolo's biggest mistake because if he didn't do that, he wouldn't have angered the Assassination Squad to the point of them wanting to take over and he wouldn't have to kill two birds with one stone by pitting them against Bruno's gang and Trish would have been dead much sooner.</br>  <br>No you faggot, fuck off with your waifu bullshit.</br>  <br> watermarked </br>  <br>thank you for making it even better</br>  <br>The world would've been ruled by vampires if Zeppeli didn't sacrifice his life to save Jojo.</br>  <br>Fuck that cancerous facebook page that steals content and puts watermarks on it. DELETE THIS</br>  <br> Joseph's face looks like funny banana <br> Caeser has his hand on Joseph's crotch while having his hand just on the back of f-Joseph <br><br>Comedy gold</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have the link of the imgur with all the wallpapers? Sharing some of mine, btw.</br>  <br>Doc's imgur has the link to the wallpapers now.</br>  <br>I dont even have a facebook, took it from an older thread</br>   WAIT I RECOGNIZE THAT GAY BLOWJOB     <br>I don't have the link to his imgur though.</br>  <br>http://docg95ehh5tlv3.imgur.com/</br>  <br>Nice.</br>    <br>I almost forgot about that, burst out laughing</br>  What made Dio the most popular character of JoJo to this day and why is he still popular?  <br>his wrryyyy</br>  <br>Because he's fucking Dio</br>  <br>What the fuck is Joseph wearing on his head?</br>  <br>He is a walking meme</br>  <br>A fucking old meme for that matter.</br>  <br>a life-sized meme?</br>  <br>100 years old?</br>  <br>Almost as old as this website.</br>  <br>older then /b/</br>  I'm reading part 5.<br><br>Mista sure gets shot a lot. I mean everytime this guy uses his damn gun they always hit him back. Why is he so useless at not getting hit by his own bullets.</br></br>  <br>Mista is the only member who survives besides Giorno</br>  <br> Fugo </br>  <br> Traitor <br> Member of the group </br></br>  <br>Oh okay then<br> Trish </br></br>  <br> Trish <br> Trash <br>Pick both.</br></br></br>  <br>She was never a member though</br>  Fuck off with your generals.  <br>That's just because she experienced Mista's dick</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>I don't know, maybe because she is not a gangster? I would she want to join them?</br>  Is Diavolo in a pocket universe? Would he still be dying after MiH reset the universe?  <br>maximum ROCKKK~<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/018bYt5YhCI?t=15s  [ ]</br></br></br>  What do you guys think the animeonly memes are gonna be for part 4 and onward when they get animated?<br><br>I'm predicting rock puns after the Aqua Necklace fight ie<br> This episode rocked <br> Angelo rocks <br> Josuke's a stone-cold killer </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shit hair will become an animeonly meme <br> no one will be allowed to have Josuke as their favorite JoJo <br>you guys blow</br></br></br>  <br> does nothing but fuckups <br> best anything </br></br>  Posting best part  <br>is someone doing math on it?<br>for what reason</br></br>  favorite part 5 stand?  <br>Gold Experience is such a good stand, even without requiem</br>  <br>It has a bunch of powers that are vaguely related to life but that reflecting power doesn't make sense in that aspect.</br>  <br>as mundane as this is, Sticky Fingers is probably my favorite from Part 5, that or Grateful Dead</br>  <br><br>I love sticky fingers but my favorite is metallica</br></br>  <br>Who turned on DK mode?</br>  <br> Fatty's back <br>I shouldn't be surprised.<br>Think we'll be getting an more Part 4s that weren't in ASB?</br></br></br>  <br>Triple-hat. Because one just isn't enough, I guess.</br>  <br>Mista and Hol horse just can't NOT shoot themselves.</br>  <br>I think the non-humanoid stands were cool, Beach Boy was my favorite.</br>  <br>Jesus was the original stand user.<br><br> To see how many breads Christ ate in his lifetime  </br></br></br>  <br>I gotta say. I've got a soft spot for King Crimson once I figured out how it works.<br><br>I honestly understand how King Crimson works more than Spice girl.</br></br></br>  The usual range of a revolver or pistol is 50 meters. Since Emperor has a range of B, which usually means up to 50 meters, it probably works just like a real gun in regards to range.<br><br><br>He ate two breads with two fishes, which he then multiplied by a thousand.</br></br></br>  <br> multiplying food <br><br>SUTANDO POWAH</br></br></br>  <br>Not only that, but Joshua bar Jospeh was the first recorded JoJo.</br>  <br> Jesus in EoH when? </br>  <br>Explain how it cut off that fortune teller hand and why couldn't it do the same with bruno or giorno</br>  <br>We better get Mikitaka and his alien nonsense. Keicho Nijimura would be fun too since Bad Company is best Part 4 stand.</br>  <br>That Jonathan makes me wish Araki stayed with Part 4 art even more.</br>  <br><br>A hat from one of the title pages from BT.</br></br>  <br>Bad company is basically a more offensive Harvest. The fact that Fatty's in makes me doubt he'll make it in.</br>  <br>Yuuya, Mikitaka, Keicho or a Part 4 Jotaro clone have the best chances, methinks.</br>  H O T P A N T S<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hazamada gets in <br> He's literally Kirby </br></br>  <br>Fatty's probably just in cause he was in ASB, plus I think Araki mentioned that his favorite character from part 4 was him.<br><br>Bad Company could still be done differently enough since it has three different types of soldier (SEAL, Helicopter, Tank), while Harvest only has the one.<br><br><br>How would they go about having Part 4 or Part 6 versions of Jotaro? Other than flicking bullets at people and forgetting about Star Finger would he do anything different?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the true nature of Jesus' stand?</br>  <br>More timestop.<br>Part 6 Jotaro dies to a stiff breeze.</br></br>  <br>Jesus's stand is Ticket to Ride, assuming the corpse is his which is honestly the most likely scenario seeing as he fucking appears to Johnny to tell him to get his shit together.<br><br>It might have more uses than what Valentine used it for with D4C Love Train, but its main ability seems to be redirecting misfortune. Which could explain the healing miracles, at the very least.<br><br>I think it would be kinda funny if all the other miracles were actually battles he had with other stand users. Like, the whole walking on water thing being just him fighting a guy who could make water solid, for example.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone should write this.<br>Redirecting misfortune could be a fun stand to work with, if written correctly. <br>Dont make it god mode, but something more akin to time stop. Exhausting and must be used sparingly.<br><br> Story ends with one final stand battle against Pontius Pilate.  <br> He successfully pins the first jojo to a cross with his stand [NINE INCH NAILS] <br> jesus dies. <br> Ticket To Ride kicks in and redirects his death to Judas three days later.  <br> JoJosus returns to kick ass and save souls. <br> Ticket to Ride becomes god mode at this point and is so strong that he loses his physical form and ascends to [HEAVEN] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yukako yamagishi would be cool</br>  <br>Well then, good news anon.</br>  <br> Dont make it god mode <br><br>You know where you fucked up right?</br></br></br>    <br>just as keikaku</br>  how long until the final bds for stardust crusaders are out<br><br>only then can we have our diamond is unbreakable preview</br></br>  <br>Well what i meant was that it shouldnt be god mode right at the start of the story, otherwise the story is pointless and boring.<br>At the end it could go full Gold Experience Requiem.<br><br>Ticket To Ride<br> Can redirect misfortune, such as moving an injury to another person, moving an illness or death to another person, or creating objects by depriving them of somewhere else. (create hundreds of bread and fish for people, but starve out another village on the other side of the world) <br> The ability is extremely exhausting and must be used sparingly. <br><br>This way in a fight, Jesus couldnt just say "lol im invincible."<br>The fights would go more like "I must hold out a little longer and then take that spear right in the gut. It will hurt like hell but i could send the injury to him afterword. I only have one shot!"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm assuming we'll have to wait until Jump Festa or something for a Part IV reveal. If not like a year or 2 from now.</br>    <br> no torso </br>  <br>What if he doesn't yet get the misfortune part but just the tear blades and massive luck boost?<br>Like if Jesus had Joseph replace the tip of the spear with a stand arrow  which doesn't exist in SBR but roll with it </br></br>  <br>What happened exactly?</br>  <br>he thought he killed Jotaro and said "Part 3 is over!"</br>  <br>Maybe she turned her entire upper body to string and she's just a walking pair of legs with string coming out.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure if she turns her heart and lungs into string she dies</br>  I'LL BE THE ROUNDABOUT  <br>dat bassline</br>  <br>Get used to that</br>  <br>Sticky Fingers</br>  Has anyone found any good art of Josefumi yet?  <br>Nothing that isn't traced from his manga appearance yet.</br>  <br>Grateful Dead and Kraft Work.<br><br><br>Gold Experience's powers are too vague and limitless, it makes him feel super cheap. Especially after Crazy Diamond, who adhered to very strict rules.</br></br></br></br>  Kenshiro in Araki style  <br>how can they fight with pants so loose?!</br>  <br>I dont know, but it sure is bizarre</br>  <br>Ask the ghetto motherfuckers that do.</br>  <br>Ok, I'll head right down to them and ask<br>I'm   white as a kite  </br></br>  <br>say you're repping Gay Priest, they'll know whats up</br>  <br>Unless he did that in Dr.Slump and some other previous shit then I doubt it, because there are plenty of other manga that did the same around that same age.</br>  <br>They don't take kindly to homosexual Catholics but they do take kindly to fabulous Protestant pastors.</br>  so i just finished part 7, i've been reading on a mostly relaxed pace for a month and a half to get to this point and it was a fucking ride.<br>diego having the world was bullshit but golden rectangles and infinite spins weren't any less, it was hype as fuck so who cares in the end.<br><br>i've been trying to order the parts from best to worst but shit's hard, i liked part 4 a lot more than what i expected and part 7 lived up to my expectations, while part 6 was mostly terrible until the very last third. part 5 was irrelevant but had some good fights/characters and tons of bullshit going on, part 3 was probably the worse out of the stand parts and part 2 the best of the hamon ones.<br><br>gyro is by far one of the best characters in the whole series, johnny manages to pull his shit even if he ultimately lost at everything ever and valentine's ideal was a lot more reasonable and coherent than pucci's.<br><br>it was good. #blog</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll be just like this</br>  <br> yfw jesus original name is joshua </br>  <br> #blog <br>Why do people do this? Is it too hard to post "nobody cares"?</br></br>  <br> johnny manages to pull his shit even if he ultimately lost at everything ever <br><br>Oh boy, wait until you read Part 8, you're in for a treat.</br></br></br>  <br>i might have accidentally spoiled myself but yeah, johnny lived a hard life.</br>   Tfw he freezes time   <br> not latter day saints <br><br>One job</br></br></br>   Tonio will never cook for you   <br>I'm pretty ok with that, I really don't want to have my intestines ripped out and replaced. Maybe if I was unconscious during the ordeal and if it was painless.</br>  <br>why live</br>  <br>it fixes medical conditions and everything its got a slightly worse healing ability then Crazy Diamond, but tastes significantly better then a punch from Crazy Diamond</br>  <br>There should be a Tonio edit for this comic</br>    <br>I'd love it</br>   The ending theme to Ep 1 of Battle Tendency wasn't an Englishman in New York <br>David and it's missed opportunities. I know the chances are 0% but I want My Sharona to be the ending theme for the Yukako arc.</br>  <br> Enemy Stands could be [Sinner Man], [Carpenter Brut], and [40 THIEVS] </br>  <br> #4 <br>Somehow fit in Mista into this?</br></br>  What will I miss out on by reading the translation for Vento Aureo in the pastebin instead of waiting 5 years for JojoProject to re translate    <br>if you never read part 5 then you'll miss out on the most op stand + some really cool fights and a really neat gang.<br><br>New translation wise, you'll get a better view on everyone's personality, especially Giorno.</br></br></br>    <br>I feel like y'all are vastly overrating the apparent injustice done to Giorno by the subpar translation of Part 5 we have available. <br><br>Comics are a visual medium as well, a lot of characterization is in the images besides just the text. I mean, is Giorno actually constantly cracking jokes in dialogue or something and us english-speakers are left out of the loop? Is he constantly cussing everyone out and rude and everyone hates him but keeps him around for some reason? <br><br>I just struggle to picture a situation in which just changing the text changes Giorno's character as much as you guys keep insisting. <br><br>And don't get me wrong, I like Giorno! I just feel like there's some overselling going on, is all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i love this shit</br>  <br>Doc has a whole album, the ones that are being posted here are probably coming from there hence the filenames.</br>  <br>Doc has a gallery of it<br>http://imgur.com/a/b2Ntd</br></br>  <br>I'm the one that posted those two, and yes they are from Doc's album</br>  Is this shit worth the investment of time? Because I feel as if the main character is the only redeeming factor of the show.  Not at all.  Not at all.

She was renamed to Italia after the fall of the fascist Government. Also she references the Fritz X attack which occured after the signing of the armistice with the allies.</br>  I wouldn't be surprised if we got German ships so soon because they had finally bagged Fumikane for Taihou and wanted to keep the momentum with him.  <br>Fair enough. We can both agree that hitting ship girls is bad though</br>  <br>once a fascist always a fascist, italia is italian</br>  <br>Whale penis</br>  DESS!  I got a Kaga drop on 2-3 the other day where is the best place to level her? I'm only on 3-1.

I can already tell it's going to be degenerate siscon bait. I'm not disappointed.  New Novels where?  <br>Mahouka is actually a lot of fun, but you have to turn off your common sense.</br>  <br>Oh yes. I think I'll enjoy this very much.</br>  What happened after it faded to black?  <br><br>Yes, considering how in one of the later novels  she confesses her love/lust for him to his face. </br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>nothing happen Tatsuya was sane enough not to fuck her</br>  <br>You have to be insane to not fuck her.</br>  <br> One of the later novels revealed that she was genetically modified to be a superior match for Onii-sama. Their children if they had any would have 0% chance of birth defects. <br>so its like, reverse incest</br></br>  Incoming lewd  The fuck is going on here? Is she trying to mark her territory or something?  <br>It's still blood related. They just made Miyuki perfect so her kids will never have defects if Tatsyua gets her pregnant.</br>  <br><br>Yea, that's not creepy AT ALL.<br><br>(Sarcasm)</br></br></br></br>  <br>As the sister she has the priv to enjoy skinship with Tatsuya.<br><br>It isn't weird to see her rub herself all over him and gets clingy.</br></br></br>  <br>Now I'm imaging her rubbing herself all over his possessions. His pillow, his sheets, his laundry, his onahole. For months, she'd take anything her beloved onii-sama associates with arousal or comfort and she'd slather it with her vaginal mucus. Slowly, he'd become accustomed to, and eventually dependent upon, her scent. Before he realizes what's happened, he's incapable of relaxing unless his sister is nearby. His only erections come from inhaling her crotch musk.</br>  <br>Onisamma is in other level anon</br>  <br>Checked and https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pus<wbr>ZXECS0mM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>MOAR!</br>  Why aren't there more brother sister anime<br>I NEED MORE</br>  This fucking show. I'm really enjoying myself here, /a/. It's going on my list of essential brother-sister love.  <br>Best imoutos right here</br>  <br>Tatsuya smooth talks like that to every girl.<br><br>It's just that he's semi-serious when he does it with Miyuki since he can only feel love to her sister and no one else.</br></br></br>  <br>She really blatantly wants his dick</br>  <br>There's only one sided basis in the series. Miyuki wants her brother's dick while he only sees her as a sister. He ships with the rival if anything.</br>  There's actually a manga about their sibling love.<br><br>MAHOUKA KOUKOU NO RETTOUSEI - TSUIOKU HEN MANGA<br><br>Just search that in google and you'll find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean where it shows how she used to treat him like a shitty servant until he saved her life? Then she went full saviour mode obsessive over onii-sama?</br>  We need more best girl.    <br>Miyuki is a real creeper. Their forced sibling love is the crappiest part of the story, the magic universe is alright. Volume 16 was cringe-worthy soap opera family drama and a cop-out on the incest.</br>  <br>Present. Ayako is fine taste too anon.</br>  <br>cut inside man, pls go</br>  <br>I'm just waiting for the shitstorm when pic related actually happens. Mahouka up until the last volume had Oreimo's editor, as of Volume 17 Dengeki has assigned a new editor. In terms of sales, Volume 16 had less in its 2 week debut than Volume 15. What this all means, your guess is as good as mine but nips on 2ch are now seriously thinking that incest end may not happen after all. Having Mayumi on the cover of Volume 17 is also fishy. <br><br> inb4 you accuse me of being any other girl xfag, I'm not. Just here to enjoy a good shitstorm. Which is a guarantee with this show no matter what.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Miyuki is a real creeper <br>An imouto can never be creepy.</br></br></br>  <br>No, Miyuki is actually creepy. And batshit insane.</br>  <br>It's difficult for imoutos to admit their love for their onii-chan.</br>  <br>Nice try, Satan. I'm only on episode 3 and we've already hit the bust measurement setup. They're definitely going to fuck.</br>  <br> Post worst girl with shit fan base. </br>  <br>Yeah, just keep watching. Tatsuya actually tells her to dance with the red haired. He's not fucking her anon. Just call me your guardian angel instead, I don't want you to cry when your expectations don't turn out.</br>  <br> barring extreme interpretations of OreImo's ending. <br>Wait, are there people that think OreImo didn't have an incest end?</br></br>  <br>Nekofags and anime only retards.</br>  <br>But that's Miyuki. Mayumifags have been tolerably tame lately.</br>  <br>Miyuki does so by freezing him out of jealousy to the point where his auto-restore triggers. What a shitty imouto.</br>    <br>He's not going to fuck every girl at least once; doing it for Nippon because muh strategic genes</br>  <br>Sometimes an imouto's love and admiration for her onii-chan is so great that she instinctively believes that her onii-chan is an invincible superhero. Miyuki is obviously under that impression sometimes  and she isn't wrong at all to think that he's invincible. </br>  <br>Tatsuya can't even get it up. Lab babies incoming.</br>  <br>But he's not a superhero. He's Jesus.</br>  Best girl coming through  <br>That fact that people like you exist and spew this kind of degenerate nonsense is disturbing. I feel bad for your sister and pray you don't actually have one.</br>  Just Finished HxH absolutely loved it   finished   Subscribed.   HxH <br> finished </br>  <br> Finished </br>  <br><br><br><br> implying it's ongoing </br></br></br></br>  Episode 38 faggot here.<br><br>I'm hoping for some new characters already.</br></br>  Was 349 really the last chapter released? What the fuck man  <br>Well, at least they're not on a boat...oh wait</br>  <br> implying it isnt </br>   finishing HxH <br><br>Impossible anon, HxH will never end</br></br>  <br>Enjoy your hiatus</br>  <br>Sounds like some shitty secondary blogging on /a/</br>   this fight <br>Goddamn that was so disappointing. The King not getting hurt goes against everything that makes HxH good, the fight is just the King getting swatted until he takes a few limbs and then they turn Netero in the bad guy because some half-assed theme. Also the enemies dying because of the bomb/poison felt really anticlimactic.</br>  <br>The whole arc went against everything that made HxH good. Too much fighting.</br>  <br> The King not getting hurt <br>But he does get hurt<br> and then they turn Netero in the bad guy <br>What the fuck are you talking about<br> Also the enemies dying because of the bomb/poison felt really anticlimactic. <br>No way</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't know what's funnier. Morons who still like the objectively shitty series that's called Hunter x Hunter or the morons who misread the shitpost that was made by the moron who made this objectively shitty thread.  <br>what is the objective of this post</br>  <br>Posting Pitou before turning into an ant.</br>  <br>Objectively shitty post.</br>  <br>Objectively shitty post.</br>  <br> Also the enemies dying because of the bomb/poison felt really anticlimactic <br> No way <br>Togashi ended almost if not all arcs in some anticlimatic way.</br></br></br>  <br>This is now a Pitou thread.</br>  <br>I know anon, it was intentional. Only Greed Island didn't have an anticlimax.</br>  <br>You spelled Killua wrong.</br>  <br>Why would anyone want a Killua thread?</br>  rewatching it as we speak and i had a small panic attack and had to take a couple breaks during the two episodes leading up to the Kite/Pitou encounter. this even though i've read the manga 3 times and watched the anime once before <br><br>i know 4chan is only shitposts and nothing serious gets posted here, but hxh is without a doubt the most emotionally taxing work of fiction, on any medium, i've ever had the pleasure to experience</br></br>  <br>8/10</br>  <br>lol</br>  <br>your watching a shonen not a live action adaptation of Salo. Get over yourself faggot.</br>  <br><br>i would never dare to post this or say this anywhere else than 4chan, and i would only dare to say it here because it would get interpreted as a shitpost anyways</br></br>  Well since this thread is going to shit anyway, is anyone going to post the Goreinu doujin?  <br>You're such a gigantic faggot. For multiple reasons.</br>  <br><br><br>It's okay anon. It's not the same thing but I get a boner every time I see Gon-san destroy Pitou even though I've read and watched the series three times. I totally understand how you feel.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Kurapika is better than these guys</br></br></br>    <br> getting an erection from Gon killing a human and losing some part of his humanity </br>  <br>are you gay?</br>  <br>I opened the thread to post exactly this.<br><br>Well, also to shitpost about liking the 2011 version, but now I'm not in the mood for that anymore.</br></br></br>  <br><br>best girls</br></br>  <br>10/10 vry sed</br>  <br>All Hunter x Hunter threads are objectively shitty because all of the people who like the objectively shitty series that's called Hunter x Hunter are morons who always make objectively shitty shitposts.</br>  <br> fate <br>not helping your case, shit taste-kun</br></br>  Killua is cute!  i fucking love how togashi ended the manga right after the CA arc too, with gon losing his nen and meeting his father. it's the absolute perfect ending, successfully avoiding the 3-5 year shounen moneygrab period and cementing it's position as japans premier cultural piece throughout history  Best man and best woman coming through.  <br> Genderbending Leorio <br><br>But why? LeorioxKurapika is fine as it is</br></br></br>  <br>What an objectively shitty thing to say, anon.</br>  <br>I want to anally assault Killua with my phallus so hard that his colon is punctured and he has to spend 6 months face down in a hospital bed while it heals!</br>  <br>you're cute</br>   finished   <br>leorio is the perfect woman</br>  YOU CAN SMILE AGAIN!  What is your opinion on bugs?  Somebody plays to this game ? because i don't know how unlock skills .  <br>The only likeable ones are Palm, Kite, Welfin, and Colt.</br>  <br>They're called abilities, you unlock them by feeding a copy of a character to themself. So if you had a 5* healer Machine, you'd have to feed her other healer Machis of the same type for a chance to gain the ability. Using a character of the same star rank or higher as food is a guaranteed ability, you could gain an ability by using a lower star rank character as food as well but chances decrease as the difference between the star ranks of the character you're feeding and the character you're using as food increases.<br><br>Feeding a 5* to a 5* = guaranteed ability<br>Feeding a 5* to a 2* = guaranteed ability<br>Feeding a 2* to a 5* = low chance of gaining an ability</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but he does get hurt <br>A few scratches isn't what I'd call "getting hurt"<br> What the fuck are you talking about <br>Pic related. He turned into the bad guy to show that humanity can be cruel too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks anon , you helped me a lot , do you have any trick to have more gemmes ? , because i have just 1/2 gemme per day , it's reallly difficult to drop a copy of a character .</br>  <br> A few scratches isn't what I'd call "getting hurt" <br>Being mostly vaporized by a nuke is not what I'd call "a few scratches".<br> Pic related. He turned into the bad guy to show that humanity can be cruel too. <br>How does that make him "a bad guy"? He was meant to strike fear into the King to show humanity's capacity for destruction far exceeds his ant-like power. Netero and the King are not "good guys" or "bad guys", they are the meant to showcase their races combined potential.</br></br></br></br>  <br> A few scratches isn't what I'd call "getting hurt" <br>He felt pain and was damaged, by definition he got hurt.<br> He turned into the bad guy to show that humanity can be cruel too. <br>Because he made a scary face? He never was a bad guy just like he never was a good guy. He sacrificed himself for his species, but still said he was grateful for all the people who died because it gave him the opportunity to fight Meruem. All he did was what you said, show humanity could be scary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's just the face of determination onto one of the most powerful human prepared to die<br>he's in no way a bad guy<br>just like  Meruem wasn't a bad guy </br></br></br>  <br>Netero and Meruem disgust me. Probably the only designs in the manga that I consider ugly.</br>  Chimera Kite is sexy! Sexy!  <br>There has to be some ugly to off set the wiggles.</br>  <br> this shitty forced meme again <br>I really thought you guys left</br></br>  <br>He was still kind of the good guy. Even though the king was changed he was still planning to rule the world. <br><br>Radiation poisoning is what killed him, not "poison". The bomb was a small nuclear bomb.</br></br></br>    <br>What wiggles?</br>  <br>dumb meme 2-3 killuafags have been trying to push for months</br>  <br>the wiggles have been around for over two years, your new is showing</br>  <br>it started in 2015, your lie is showing</br>  <br>Confirmed for shit taste, faggot.<br><br><br> enemies dying because of the bomb/poison felt really anticlimactic. <br><br>You are retarded. You must be some 12 yo faggot, who lack creativity.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that's what you want to believe.</br>  1999 is best  <br> Confirmed for shit taste, faggot. <br>Yes, your taste has been confirmed as shit.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't go as far as to call him disgusting, but Meruem has a pretty weird body.<br>I'm curious, what are your favorite designs?</br></br>  Who Torpor here?<br><br>Waiting until hiatus drops.</br></br>  <br> mfw his death <br><br> No one should ever die alone. </br></br></br>  <br>He said he wasn't alone though</br>  <br>legit sorrowed on that part as well.</br>  <br>Why was his hair floating during that power up?<br><br>Rogue Nen gravitons?<br><br> Inb4 nen, ain't gotta explain tits </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks like a face that is laughing at death itself, sure Netero was never afraid of death, but that badass MoFo literally laughed at death before his demise as he was atomized.<br><br>It takes enormous amounts of fucking balls to laugh at death without insanity.</br></br></br>  <br>Was that Kite's ulterior motive all along?<br><br>Also, did his Nen abilities change as well?</br></br></br>  <br>If you're starting out, I can tell you that the chances of obtaining character doubles are slim. The pool of characters available in the premium gacha increases every week so you might not see doubles until you've built up a varied collection.<br>Or your next few pulls might all be 6* Kite, it's a matter of RNG at the end of the day.<br><br>There's no real trick to gems other than completing maps and events. Finish story mode if you haven't (blue map screen), try your hand at the events (red map).<br>You could always buy gems, 30 for the low low price of 2000¥!<br>But just try to login in every day, at the very least.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It started much earlier on tumblr, but you Killuafags just started trying to force it here on 4chan in 2015.<br><br>Then you wonder why no one likes you.</br></br></br>  <br>Congratulations, you were full of shit before, but now you proved to me you're full of shit. I'm the one that started it, and I started it in 2013, and I've never once been to tumblr, so it wasn't there that I started it.<br><br>Keep on being new.</br></br></br>  <br> being this proud on creating a tumblr tier meme <br>And yet you're the only who keeps posting it, you created it in 2013 and it still hasn't caught on means that your meme is forced.</br></br>  Snu Snu time mother fuckers!  I don't know why but Silva Zoldyck slightly reminds me of Bowie, msut be the badass hair.  <br>Problem with your point is that I usually only lurk in HxH threads unless some actual discussion happens, which sadly usually only happens when Green is around, and I still see it posted in every single HxH thread. So basically you're just outright wrong.</br>  <br>P-Pls! <br><br><br>Rude.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then you must have been around every thread, because it just started being posted by 1-2 Killuafags after people started reporting <br>post. And that's only when the Killuafags are out.</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about?  only started getting reported recently (see: last two months) and I made this image (  ) in March.<br>Not even that guy, but why does this matter to you so much?</br></br>  <br>What's the point in lying about this?</br>  <br>It doesn't, someone asked why the meme was forced and I answered. It doesn't get posted in every thread and recently Killualust tends to get reported, and even before then it wasn't posted in every thread.</br>  <br>Okay, and I was just clearing up that the wiggle shit wasn't supposed to replace the Killua is cute! shit. I don't care for the wiggle meme, I just make stuff for it. So that wasn't the intention.</br>  <br>ok , thanks a lot</br>  Machi best girl.  <br>Sorry to say the meme took off on tumblr, and tends to invite Killualust which kills discussion. It's kind of why the "KIllua is cute!" meme overstayed its welcome.</br>  I want Togashi to write some anime original movies. His Kuruta backstory was promising, it's a shame Badhouse butchered it and turned it into the KilluGon hour.  <br>Togashi's creative and competent enough to be able to write and direct his own movies.<br><br>But I don't think he's interested.</br></br></br>  <br>At the moment Shuiesha currently has a contract with BadHouse to produce the anime. They have to wait for the contract to expire before they can get another studio to to adapt the work. So either way Togashi won't be writing the script for any movies anytime soon.</br>  <br><br><br> reading the manga <br>Why would I pick up something on permanent hiatus.<br>I could just read Berserk if I hated myself that much.<br>Also Togaki's art a shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br> hiatus <br> permanent <br><br>A permanent hiatus is a canceled manga. Also 0/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you watch something on permanent hiatus? It's the same fucking series, just ignore the chapters from after the anime.<br><br>Or don't, and stay a filthy secondary. The art is shit for a period of time but the rest is pretty good with nice paneling and composition, and morons who refuse to read the source material don't know that.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wait, ignore my serious response. I just realized you haven't even read Berserk, jesus christ.</br>  <br>The only time the art was ever shit was in that KiteKoala chapter he never redrew.</br>  <br>Majority of readers only purchased the Jump issues so most of his audience haven't even witnessed his revised napkin drawings. The man really had no excuse but utter lack of respect for his fans. Though I guess chronic laziness makes you apathetic to peoples feelings.</br>  <br> makes you apathetic to peoples feelings. <br>Ironic, considering you're completely ignoring his feelings. He has health issues.</br></br>  <br>where are some assistants to aid him through it then?</br>  <br>Hard to say, but the guy has never worked with them even when in health.</br>  <br>Isn't it because he just wants to do it all himself?</br>  <br>did he have assistance for the last 9 chapters or do it all himself?<br><br>he's probably working on more</br></br></br>  <br>Actually in the case of HxH it's popular because of it's volume releases.</br>  <br>As you should OP, as you should.</br>  <br>Shit man, he's as bad as Gon when it comes to his pride.</br>  I see no difference  <br>It's pretty stupide , if he changes nothing , his manga will never finish , it makes no sense .</br>  <br>Remember the shitstorm when Kubo put a random reference to YYH in Bleach?</br>  Reminder that Hisoka is just as good as a ninja without nen  If have a few questions regarding Leol's Rental Pod if anyone can provide answers<br>1) If Leol borrows Chrollo's Bandit's Secret, Would he have access to all of the stolen nen abilities that Chrollo took?<br>2) If Leol borrows Chrollo's Bandit's Secret and steals a nen ability himself, would Chrollo have access to that nen ability that Leol took provided he gets the book back?</br></br>  <br>Does Leol's ability keep the person he "borrowed" from from using their nen while he's using it? I mean does he actually steal the power like Chrollo or just copy it temporarily? If so, I'd say yes and yes. If not, no and no.</br>  <br><br>Isn't there a new artist for DC arc? The art looks nothing like his previous chapters.</br></br>  <br>He copies it temporarily. Once used the ability goes back to the original nen user I believe.</br>  <br> Isn't there a new artist for DC arc? <br>How stupid and new do you have to be to think this?</br></br>  <br>"Killua is cute!" did not start on tumblr either though.<br><br>I don't get why killualust gets reported.</br></br></br>  <br>No the wiggle one did though, but they do still gush about "Killua is cute". Both memes didn't take off over here but rather on tumblr, then you have people trying to force it.<br><br>Because there's a thread for that, and a lot of the time they tended to do it while people were in middle of a discussion which would then result in the discussion dying, when they all spammed the thread. Anon was just fine with it, but then it got really old when they would spam the same pictures and phrases over and over again, so anon got tired of it and asked them to stop. The Killuafags wouldn't stop, so anon started reporting it.<br><br>Long story short, Killualust gets reported because of Killuafags.</br></br></br></br></br>  Do we know for a fact Gyro was turned into a Chimera Ant? Or is there a chance that he escaped?  <br>Yes, the wiki states it.<br>"His tenacity and pride as a former king allowed him to keep all of his human memories and break free of the Chimera Ant Queen's control, vacating her domain.[1] His malevolence and determination are second to none and now, having been reborn as a different species, is completely disconnected from the human race."</br></br>  <br>read the damn manga</br>  <br>Hisoka is really overated , people thinks he's strong like Kuroro or Silva because he wants to challenge them , but Hisoka wants to challenge literally everybody , if he would meet the king , he would want to fight him .<br>Hisoka is strong like Phinks or Razor , but he's not TopTier.</br></br>  <br>I find weird that as the king he is supposed to mate with females of other species yet he seems to lack sexual organs. Or is it his sting?</br>  <br>His tail is the D. When he hit Pitou with it he basically cock slapped her.</br>  <br> her </br>  <br>I think it was stated that Hisoka only challenges people he knows he can beat.</br>  <br> her </br>  <br>No , he wants to challenge Netero .</br>  <br>FUCK YOU</br>  <br>I kind of felt the same away about the bomb, but in retrospect, I just chalk that up to being in 'DBZ mode' from years of cookie-cutter shonens whenever I see a hype battle, I came to appreciate and love the way the fight ended. It really drove home the powerful reality that no other creature will be able to destroy. and sequentially, conquer like humans. The boot was always above these creatures that spent a whole arc fucking shit up and selling us as unstoppable.</br>  <br>he died. who cares?</br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br> her <br>more like b*tch</br></br>  The best part of the bomb was that it was so anticlimactic. Here is the most powerful being in the world, a truly unique existence and he gets destroyed by a cheap, mass produced nuclear bomb. It's romantic as fuck.  <br>Kill drew the gap that short because he didn't want to leave the country in order the finish drawing Gon's line.</br>  <br> He knows he can beat Netero </br>  <br>As a nen user Hisoka could wreck him with his aura alone.</br>  <br>It's good to question the laws of nen</br>  <br>You should take into account that Kil didn't even know about Nen at the time. So he's only guaging physical abilities.</br>  How would you beat this guy without sound?<br>He can literally bounce off any attack. How would Meruem win?</br>  <br>He wouldn't.</br>  Best Chimera Ant<br> Seriously, what the fuck was he? </br>  <br>pulverized.</br>  <br>That's funny anon but  he's from the dark continent </br>  <br>That looks like the sort of creature I would expect to see in some Monster Sex hentai video.</br>  <br><br>Well he DID get fisted.</br></br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>what'd you know about the dark continent?</br>  <br><br>Easy. His defence was purely against enhancers. <br><br>Meruem would see his hair has tiny gaps between it and throw a stone at hyper sonic speeds. <br><br>Or just punch so hard the guy dies from the shock wave. He wasn't exactly durable and only showed his skills against a guy who was literally the most retardedly physical enhancer ever.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I heard it from a friend.</br>  <br> Easy. His defence was purely against enhancers.  <br>But that's wrong.</br></br>  <br>tell your friend to hurry tf up and tell you more</br>  <br>Let me just finish this dragon quest game real quick</br>  <br>need a back massage?</br>  <br>It really was, and it's annoying to see shounenbabbies complain because they wanted a big battle instead.</br>  <br>Yeah, I don't know much about how Jump runs except for what Bakuman taught me, but doesn't HxH do badly in rankings? It's logical to think that fans would wait for the tanks instead of always checking for chapters in Jump on the off chance something was actually published.</br>  <br>Illumi is on par with Hisoka.<br><br>There's no way Illumi could beat his grandfather, Zeno.<br><br>Zeno is on par with Chrollo.<br><br>Zeno states that there is no way he can beat Netero.<br><br>Hisoka is full of shit.<br>He'd try to fight the king and get killed by Pitou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Illumi is on par with Hisoka. <br>and how do you know this? At least you backed up your other statements</br></br>  <br><br>Oh that's right, you don't.</br></br>  <br> Zeno is on par with Kuroro <br>please rewatch HxH.</br></br>  <br>HunterxHunter is one of the highest regarded manga in Japan, that and its volume sales makes whatever ranking it gets from the magazine just not matter. So no one ever pays attention to it.</br>  <br>He was an In-juu, wasn't he?</br>  <br> In-juu <br>Yes. But don't be a weeb.</br></br>  <br>Why is Worm a worm?<br>Why is Beans a bean?<br>Why is Muherr an elf?<br>Why is Kurapika a demon?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Hunter x Hunter was one of the few shows that did powerlevel shit properly, and they threw it all away in a single, slow as fuck arc.<br>They weren't even content with that, though, so they went ahead and shat out not one, but two deus ex machina fights (SSJ gon and netero's bomb). Even without all that shit, the arc would have been unoriginal, boring, and painfully awkward. As it is, it's actually godawful.</br></br>  <br> shows </br>  <br>Yes, it's both a manga and an anime<br> dumbass summerfag nitpicking </br></br>  <br>Who are you quoting, newfag?</br>  <br> without insanity <br> Implying he wasn't totally off his rocker after those years of training/solitude </br></br>  <br>Who are you quoting, newfag?</br>  <br>Who are you calling a newfag, newfag?</br>  <br>Whom*</br>  <br>Whom*</br>  <br>ebig :DDDDDD</br>  <br>Ellen.</br>  <br><br>and you faggots that are noobs</br></br>  Let's get this thread back on track.  <br>Okay. The hiatus never ends</br>    <br>Leorio, Knuckle and Hanzo kind of reminds me of eachother. Mainly because they're emitters.<br>Leorio is like the funny-angry type<br>Knuckle would be the funny-stubborn type<br>Hanzo would just be the funny-funny type</br></br></br></br>  <br>knuckle a shit</br>  <br>not too mention they all have soft sides, Leorio obviously cares about his friends. Hanzo felt bad for breaking Gon's arm thus making it stronger and Knuckle cries alot</br>  <br>Hanzo doesn't seem very funny. He threatened to cut off a shota's legs, and then broke his arm deliberately while he couldn't defend himself</br>    <br>Gay</br>  <br>That's mainly because he was fighting so he took it serious. Outside of that, he's mainly been fuzzy and enthusiastic.</br>  <br> yusuke, kurama, kuwabara  <br>this is some rehash shit tbh</br></br>  <br> hanzo <br> not funny <br>Animefag detected</br></br></br>  <br>what game is this ?</br>  I WANT TO EAT KILLUA'S SHIT  <br>Is there any HxH boy who isn't moe?</br>  <br>I would drag my flaccid dick through a mile of broken glass just to hear Killua fart over the telephone.</br>  <br>Based Hanzo. I wish we can see more of him<br> Fuck you, Togashi. </br></br>  <br>Why is Pika such a manlet? It's cute though</br>  <br>Well he is pretty young. Once he reaches Leorio's age he will probably be around the same height<br><br>Reminder that Meruem is a manlet too</br></br></br>  <br>Tserriednich<br>Saccho<br>Deigo<br>Killua<br>Silva<br>Tonpa</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> manlet <br>You mean Antlet?</br></br>  <br>I would suck a fart straight from his asshole.</br>    <br>He obviously fused with Polnareff<br><br><br> Nuclear technology is deus ex machina <br>They have cell phones and computers, it's safe to assume that they more or less followed a similar timeline in actual tehcnological history.</br></br></br></br></br>  Would HxH be finished by now if Togashi wasn't such a lazy piece of shit?  <br>Without hiatuses it would be over 700 chapters so yes, most likely.</br>  <br>stop shitposting</br>   HxH thread <br> Best girl is barely posted </br>  <br>No, all of HxH to date is only a prologue, and it's only 1/10th of the way through. It's actually just a historical account of the events leading up to LoTGH</br>  <br>Worst boy</br>  <br> two deus ex machina fights (SSJ gon and netero's bomb) </br>  <br>These threads always need more Pitou.</br>  Asta<br>Amana<br>Manheim<br>Nick Cue<br>Souheil<br>Kazsule<br><br>...Check your binder.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best Pitou.</br>  <br>It's best to just ignore the wrong opinions of people who can't appreciate some of the best writing in the series.</br>  <br>No one said anything about Feitan, anon</br>  <br>That's not very nice anon.</br>  <br>It got what it deserved for being a corpse mangler and a shit character.</br>  <br>You left out that it tried to kill the shotas. Wanting to kill shotas is wrong, and actually succeeding is unforgivable.</br>  Does anyone know the whole thing about "X"? Why is it part of the show title? I know the hunter organization has XX on it's building, but why? Did I miss something?  <br>Yes but at the same time he couldn't bring himself to hurt said shota more.<br>Hanzo's a pretty cool guy.</br></br>  <br>it's more like × and it's just stylization</br>  <br>Yeah, they even had about nukes earlier in the manga.</br>  <br>Why have hunter twice?<br>Why is it pronounced "hunter hunter"?</br></br>  <br>Episode 38?<br>Oh, you'll get some great ones in a few more episodes.</br></br>  <br>I thought it was because Gon, a hunter, was hunting Ging, another hunter<br>Or maybe Togashi just wanted to give it a title that sounded cool</br></br>  <br> who can't appreciate some of the best writing in the series. <br> desperate deus ex nonsense <br>yeah sure thing. And then he brings back Gon's ability with deus ex powers, fucking kek.<br>You're really so used to simple minded shit that you think the cheapest tricks are "the best writing" my sides<br><br><br>So they use it only once, out of nowhere? Sounds great, not to mention all the other criticisms your desperate ass was too stupid to even touch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd say that because Hisoka rated him a 95.<br><br>A 100 would mean that the enemy is almost equal or slightly stronger than him. <br><br><br>While Chrollo wasn't trying to kill them, I'd say Zeno could do serious damage to him on an open area because he could use dragon dive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Woah there nigger, calm down. I'm not desperate, it's just rational thought. Plus, if what this guy  said is true, they've used it before. What are you expecting? Using something out of nowhere is not the same thing as Deus ex machina.</br>  <br> desperate deus ex nonsense <br>Both the covenants and nukes were established to exist, i do agree with you about Alluka though. At least Gon still hasn't recovered his nen.</br></br>  Why did he have to kill of the guy with Jew-Fu?  <br>So if we assume Netero is a 100, is he only 5 points above Illumi? His ranking system is pretty weird</br>  <br>What if 100 is Hisoka himself, then Netero might be 200 or something</br>  <br> Woah there nigger, calm down. I'm not desperate <br>I apologize for my rudeness my friend<br> , they've used it before <br>This is exactly why I think it's deus ex machina. He pulled it straight from that common bag of writer's hail mary cliches. He mentioned it a bit earlier just in case it would come in handy. Be honest, do you really think it was wise to end it so stupidly after such a painfully long process as the Chimera Ant Arc? Even if you think mureum's death was decently done, do you really buy the way he used the fallout from the bomb and Gon's magical power up to wrap things up so nicely? It just reeks of asspull</br></br></br></br>  <br>hisoka has a pretty strong ability, none of the nen users that know about it want to fight him,h and there's the fact we've never seen hisoka fight all out. For all we know he could have more abilities he's hiding</br>  <br>D.E.M: an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation, especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel.<br><br>Everyone was already driven into a corner, how else were they supposed to get out of it? Extend the arc even longer to wait for the Zodiac and other OP hunters to arrive and possibly save the day?</br></br></br>  <br> do you really think it was wise to end it so stupidly after such a painfully long process as the Chimera Ant Arc? <br>Yes, I really loved what Togashi did there.</br></br>  <br> do you really think it was wise to end it so stupidly after such a painfully long process as the Chimera Ant Arc?  <br>Did you not notice all the other intentional anticlimaxes?<br> fallout from the bomb <br>How is that an asspull? It makes perfect sense, it's just completely unexpected.<br> Gon's magical power up <br>Please don't tell me you believe that's an asspull. It's almost entirely explained during the beatdown.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Everyone was already driven into a corner, how else were they supposed to get out of it? <br>That's the writer's fault for making mureum so ridiculously overpowered to begin with.</br></br>  <br> A 100 would mean that the enemy is almost equal or slightly stronger than him.  <br>Are you just pulling shit out of your ass now? We have no idea how he ranks people, other than them being fun to fight</br></br>  <br>there was no "deus ex machina" with gons "magical powerup" as you refer it.<br><br>It was a Nen contract, how can you get that far in the series and no understand nen?<br><br>Right when they showed nen they showed how strong it could be with kurapika</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True it is due to the writer. But would you want a weak villain? I was just so surprised when the fallout killed him, because I honestly didn't see it coming, and I love being surprised. What makes it even better is that it actually made sense, it's not like Gon when SSJ2 and killed Meruem, because I honestly thought that's where it was going; I couldn't think of a way to kill him.</br>  So, what are the odds that the reason they're separated from the dark continent is to keep nen locked away?<br>Things from the dark continent seem to go haywire when in contact with nen. The ants, Nanika.<br>I don't see why the watchers let anyone out at all, but I suppose they might just want to limit it a bit.</br></br>  <br>Anything anyone says about it is pulling it out of their asses since it's never explained. Honestly, ranking himself at 100 makes sense to me. It could be wrong, whatever.<br><br><br>yeah I'd say it's borderline deus ex machina, except that Gon has (for now anyway) lost his Nen abilities.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alluka is a deus ex machina and so is Gon being healed.<br><br>Gon san is not because it followed the nen rules regarding vows and limitations established in Yorkshin. The nuke is not because it's just a cheap fucking nuke and we know bombs exist in the HxH universe. Resolutions that surprise you =/= deus ex machina. <br><br>They are some of the best writing in the series for how they resolved Gon's character arc and the arc's themes respectively.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is what I think as well, couldn't be said better.</br>  <br>nice buzzwords there kid<br><br>the summerfags really are here in full force</br></br></br>  <br> it's borderline deus ex machina <br>How is along established rule of nen in way a deus ex machina?</br></br>  <br> It was a Nen contract, how can you get that far in the series and no understand nen? <br>You're under the assumption that, once something is established, the extent to which it works is unlimited, which is completely stupid. It felt forced and out of place, even in a shonen, and that's because he's pushing the rules of the world he has written, and that's a sign of execrable laziness in a world as fantastical as this.<br><br><br> It's almost entirely explained during the beatdown. <br>His dismal explanations and factual close ups don't serve to make the situation any less probable. He's basically taking an idiotic series of events and slowing it down to fake a sort of conformity to the rules of the hxh universe. <br> Did you not notice all the other intentional anticlimaxes? <br>It was really a clumsy mix of climaxes and anti climaxes the tone of that entire arc was tedious and abysmal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realise that was the entire reason the bomb was an effective way to kill him, right? The point of it would be completely lost if he was just mid tier. It would be a weak way to kill, say, Hisoka or the troupe, but using something so mundane, cruel and normal without any magic to kill the strongest being on the planet, who was born to rule over everything? Yeah, there's actual intent and meaning behind that.<br><br>Togashi could've just had Netero win the fight and it would've been fine. He was hyped enough that nobody would question it. But he used the bomb for thematic purposes.</br></br></br>  <br>Your taste is beyond shit, and your argument don't even makes sense.</br>  <br><br>I'm still conflicted on whether or not Alluka is an asspull. Alluka was shown a few times long before the CA arc even started, though it never showed her face, and the dark continent was hinted at with Ging having possibly been there, both of those set up for Alluka being from the DC, though the hints of that didn't come until after the fact, so it's hard to say. Two things in favor of it not being an asspull, with a third that happened afterward to explain it, so the way I see it, it was set up, but the nail in the coffin didn't come until after, so it could still be an asspull.</br></br>  <br>It wasn't really unlimited though. He just aged up to where he would be strong enough to beat Pitou, wasting all his potential. Alluka being able to heal him is the retarded part.<br><br>I don't think there is a good way to have killed the king, while still claiming he is the perfect being. The nukes ex machina was the only real solution. I mean you could argue that he wrote himself into a corner, and that it's a bad thing, but eh. I think it's all set up to show that nen combined with the dark continent creates a sort of divinity.</br></br></br>  <br>Alluka is not an asspull. Nanika is.</br>  <br> You're under the assumption that, once something is established, the extent to which it works is unlimited <br><br>what the fuck are you talking about? Nen power is directly tied to the rules around it, the stricter the rules the more powerful the ability <br><br><br>There's no "rule pushing" he completely following the rules</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tomayto tomoto potaytoe potaughto</br>  <br>Eh. Alluka was an asspull. Or rather, Killua being able to order her to do things for free was bullshit.<br>Alluka in herself wasn't bad, getting a being from the dark continent to abuse your nen to give you a great nen power, or enhance a nen power he might already have had.

Is this Sailor Moon? Where's Atem killing people and Kaiba driving people to bankruptcy?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But card games on motorcycles was arguably more mature than DM</br>  We heard anything from Mono yet?  <br>Play MtG.

Trust me I'm Konami.</br>    why is melissa claire so cute?  <br><br>It didn't necessarily turn to shit, it just changed drastically. I guess a lot of people think that the new way is shit.

Don't confuse Judai with Yuma</br></br>  <br>What? Jaden stated from the beginning that he wanted to be the next King of Games.<br><br>I've never even watched ZEXAL</br></br></br>  <br>He should have won against Yugi anyways, can't have Yugi lose though. <br><br>Granted it was in the past and the title wouldn't have officially passed on, it's still quite clear that Judai is KoG material and he manages to do the most in BBT too.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You win this round /dng/.<br> Solemn judgement unban when? </br></br></br></br>  <br>After Season 3 he just wanted to have fun with dueling again, which he accomplished with his duel against Yugi, so he lost on purpose and went traveling around the world.

That awkward silence they had followed by that laugh. It was just two dudes having fun playing a game. Not sending off a friend like the original and Zexal was and not another Yusei wankfest like 5D's was. I hope Arc-V ends on a similar note.  <br>Cyber Jar is never coming back either. Hell the OCG gets by with having neither of them banned. <br><br>Hell the OCG banlist is basically Dragon Rulers and a couple things from Shaddoll, Qli, and Nekroz.

I HATE YOU <br><br>Go ahead. What's the worst that could happen?</br></br></br>  <br>Well then where's the cap saying Judai wants to be the new king of games?

The reason this last list didn't sell is because they still need to move MegaTin 2015, so they can't afford to hit anything that would potentially help sell the tins.</br>  <br>And I said I rewatched it recently and that is never mentioned, just because I don't blog it on /a/ doesn't mean I didn't rewatch it.

No amount of dub titles will prove you right.</br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br> dub <br>No.</br></br>  <br>W-When was the last time?</br>  Oh wow, Ruri is getting fansites and she hasn't even appeared yet. The hype is real.  <br>Reminder not having a Ruri in your life makes you an Evil Genius.</br>  <br>It's gonna suck when we find out her and Rin are evil now and only Serena and Yuzu can save them in a Fusion Bowl.</br>  I FOUND RURI  <br>This is going to be Rio all over again, right? At least she isn't in a hospital dying, she is only kidnapped.</br>  <br>I love how the general consensus of Ruri is high brown boots, long hair, and short shorts. We're all gonna be so disappointed aren't we?</br>  why are they floating?  <br>It's funny that both series have the same director. Ruris using a symphogear when?</br>  <br>Why is Yuri so perfect?</br>  <br>Because QUALITY</br>  <br>Literally Yuya's polar opposite in every way and have the same VA as him.</br>  <br> Big eyebrows <br> Pink hair <br> Fusion user <br> Pure <br>You tell me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think Yuya will be impressed by Yuri's egao?</br>  <br>Nah Yuya will pull a Touma and say you're not smiling correctly.</br>  <br>Imagine a Yuya vs Yuri duel, damn</br>  Oh Canada<br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/23/yu-gi-oh-arc-v-to-air<wbr>-in-canada-this-weekend</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Yuya's moralfag powers are not strong enough to be TouMAN</br>  <br>I can't wait to see how Kensho Ono will do it.</br>  <br>It must be weird to be yelling at yourself.</br>  Judging how unpredictable this shows usually ends up, is it wrong to hope for a Yugo vs Yuri duel?  <br>Serena vs Yuzu when?</br>  <br>It's probably gonna be Yuya vs Yugo duel when fusion scum crash the tourney with no survivors, Yugo will sacrifice himself Yuto style but will end up absorbed by Yuri.<br>Meanwhile Bennis will go for the Ruris</br></br>  <br>No. If Yuri is going to absorb Yugo, he needs to duel him first.</br>  <br> This is going to be Rio all over again, right? <br><br>I hope so.</br></br></br>  <br>The way Yuzu confronted Selena worked out well.</br>  <br>When Bennis was first shown he looked like a mere filler character. Never thought that he'd be a spy/fusion scum/Yuri's fuck toy.</br>  <br>Can't even tell who is who<br><br>Is Serena wearing Yuzu's outfit or did they just change personality?</br></br></br>  <br> We're all gonna be so disappointed aren't we? <br><br>No matter what she ends up looking like, I know she'll be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>Check "Yuzu's" bracelet.</br>  <br>I used to dislike him but he really grew on me.<br>Based master ruseman</br></br>  <br>I remember when people seriously thought he was Yuri in general until he was revealed to be his henchmen.</br>  <br>GON SEKI NO HERO</br>  <br>Idiots.</br>  <br>There have been dumber theories.</br>    Excuse me, I was told there are Ruris here.<br><br>Where can I find them?</br></br>  <br> Yuto is EMIYA Yuya from a dimension where his Yuzu died/was tortured after everything went FUBAR due to Pendulum shit. <br>One of my favorite debunked theories. It's not even that far off.</br></br>  <br>There was another retarded theory saying that Trapeze Magician was Yuri, but I think that was only a thing among the japan fanbase.</br>  <br>Apparently they were all meant to have the same VA, but it was too much work for Ono Kensho, so they gave Yuto and Yugo different VAs.</br>  <br>This is too soon, I'm not prepared.</br>  Defend this shit.  Butt?  Hormones?  <br>I can´t.</br>  Here dere side skyrockets all the way up to 2%, resulting in a 98/2 tsun-dere ratio. Which is apparently the ideal for people who like her.<br><br>Meanwhile, the opposite.</br></br>  Eriri a shit<br>A SHIT</br>  <br>she's a shit</br>   Erifags   <br>he wouldn't say that</br>  <br><br>It's impossible. She's made too many bitch moves.</br></br>  <br>No one but that blind and delusional Eririfag can defend that skank. Wait for him to appear.</br>  <br>wow, are they that bad?</br>  <br><br>They are. They can never admit when their character has done wrong when it is obvious that she has done wrong.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather conquer it.</br>      <br>I can't. Saikano is literally and figuratively shit.</br>  <br> Saikano <br><br>Wrong show.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Black tights are the best things. i literally come to /a/ just to join in the pantyhose threads.</br></br>    <br>I also picked up this anime purely because i saw this figure</br>  <br> Saikano </br>  <br><br><br>how do you feel regarding she being useless now</br></br></br>  <br>I'm on episode 4 so i don't even know/care about the characters, i'm literally in this show just for the legwear.</br>  <br> he missed all the shitposting with /a/ </br>  <br> not watching the show for Megumi </br>  <br>can't argue with those digits</br>  <br>she's cute, but she doesn't wear tights and therefore doesn't pander to my fetishes. But she's my second favorite.</br>  <br><br>Anything is fine as long as Eriri is last.</br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Eriri? She's flawed, but is cute and fairly complex. I mean, she's a tsundere that doesn't put wanting the D as top priority and that is something.</br>    <br><br>She's done too many things wrong.</br></br>    <br>Why did he stopped doing VN art? His drawing is glorious.</br>  Megumi a shit  <br>She left the MC twice only though. The first time was forgiven since they made up. The second time had well-intentions, but arguably poor course of actions. In the latter, Utaha did "wrong" too, so Eriri wasn't in making that course of action alone. She's flaw, but that is what makes her interesting. She moves forward with a goal and fumbles along the way, but does try her best. She has a lot of pride and that contributes to her inability to admit or yield, but she's not a bad person. Even Utaha can see that and that is partly why she is protective of her.</br>  <br> What's wrong with Eriri? </br>  <br> Megumifags' thoughtless shitposting and circlejerkng: the thread <br>Capped and archive for future use.</br></br>  <br><br>Gee I wonder who made this post.</br></br>   have to choose between slut, bitch or bland <br><br>Why do people watch this shit again?</br></br>  <br>Your taste is just bad.</br>  Why do anime characters wear additional panties under their pantyhose?  <br>just pick best girl then</br>   Ruined his school life to defend her popularity status. <br>I just can't OP.</br>  <br> not even best girl in her own band </br>  <br> bland <br><br>So you didn't watch the show at all.</br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't what happened, Lelouch. I get that you're brainless for tits and a shitposter, but keep to facts would you?</br>  <br>she was the girl of the season anon</br>  <br><br>He knows where the money is.</br></br>  <br>If Eriri is shit, then all the other girls are worse than shit. I'll pick her over the others any day. At least Eriri is cute and fun.</br>  <br><br>Utaha didn't do wrong because she told Tomoya personally that she was leaving. Eriri is a coward that hid behind Utaha's back during the train scene because she couldn't face Tomoya personally. Considering she still hasn't apologized to Megumi yet, she didn't really develop that much in volume 6.</br></br>  <br><br>Eriri is the only worse than shit girl.</br></br>  <br>Why? She's indeed shit</br>  <br> Not liking sluts </br>  What's wrong with the coloring on her back/butt?  Original character do not steal.  <br> At least Eriri is cute and fun <br><br>She would also stab you in the back the minute she sees that it would be beneficial for her.</br></br></br>    <br> Utaha didn't do wrong <br>She betrayed the MC. She said so herself.<br><br>I don't see why Eriri'ss method for telling the MC is something wrong. She told in a way that best suits her personality. That wasn't even the problem as we saw in volume 8. The issue was that Eriri left that caused tension between the two again, which is the only thing "wrong". <br><br>The awkwardness between Megumi and Eriri is still a work in progress. We know it's going to happen eventually, it just takes time for Eriri to sort it all out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Best girls.</br></br>  <br>Have you even seen a woman in real life?</br>  <br> She betrayed the MC. She said so herself. <br><br>And Tomoya said that it wasn't wrong in the train scene. There's a reason things are tense between Tomoya and Eriri and not Utaha. <br><br> it just takes time for Eriri to sort it all out. <br><br>She should have apologized in the scene where she made Megumi cry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit taste.</br>  <br>What? If you're going to stick with that then you can't accuse Eriri for leaving the Tomoya as wrong too. He realized both of them were right. But he still hold a grudge over it as seen in the tension between Eriri and Tomoya in the latest volume. <br><br> should <br>You're projecting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She had one (1) cute scene.</br>  <br>fuck off tripshit</br>  <br> But he still hold a grudge over it as seen in the tension between Eriri and Tomoya in the latest volume.  <br><br>That probably has more to do with the way she left. Utaha did it upfront and personal, it's the reason they can do things like hold hands. <br><br> You're projecting. <br><br>If she really developed in volume 6 as much as people say she did, she would have.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think that is it. This is a matter of friend and not creator. Tomoya holds Eriri as someone more special as a girl. The implications there hints that his grudge has to do with being sour at Eriri whom he held different expectations. Since it isn't a problem as creators, it is a problem between childhood friends and that leads back to the fact Eriri still left him and that hurts him.<br><br> she would have. <br>It isn't the same situation. She apologized and recognized her mistakes as a Creator when she troubled the group. And making up with Tomoya was something between them as childhood friends. With Megumi, it's something between girlfriends. Eriri is aware of Megumi and the issue at hand. That's why she tip-toes and ask Tomoya about it. She isn't being insensitive and ignoring the issue. The point is it is complicated and takes time. Eriri and Megumi both think that they the other person might not view them as friends anymore, and that is a misunderstanding.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eriri is moe and has a weak but determined and admirablly pure heart that is worth protecting. So screw you.</br>  <br>she is shit</br>  <br>Easy. I ask that you do the world a favor and kill yourself.<br><br>That show is trash anyway, but Eriri is the best psrt of it, clichéd as she is.</br></br></br>  <br> The point is it is complicated and takes time. Eriri and Megumi both think that they the other person might not view them as friends anymore, and that is a misunderstanding. <br><br>Where do you get this part?

Eriri and Megumi's thoughts in regards to one another. On Eriri's side, it's clear that she would like to remain as friends with Megumi, but she doesn't know if Megumi have the same feeling, so she's kinda pessimistic about rift/drama that's there between them.</br>  <br> can't even type properly due to rage <br> Pathetic, <br>Rage more, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You are right, all Saenai girls are bellow this goddess.</br></br>  <br> bitchy Utaha <br> boring Megumi <br><br>As expected of Erirfags.

But thanks for supporting my statement there, Megumifag.</br></br>  <br> Nice deflection and slander. <br><br>More like the truth. Face it, Eririfag. Megumi is literally perfection. There is nothing to criticize. You guys can only play defense with Eriri, you can't actually attack.</br></br></br>  <br> Eririfag says stupid shit <br> gets called out on it <br><br>What's the problem again? At least he wasn't like certain Eririfags who get triggered by such posts and derail a thread in a fit of rage.</br></br></br></br>  I was always defending this show when it was airing, however, all of that changed when we got to eriri's route. I have never seen a shittier route than hers, and that's saying something.  <br>You're embarrassing yourself. I'd stop posting if I were you.</br>  <br><br>Don't worry, her route gets blown to pieces in the later novels.</br></br>  <br>Just Megu and Utaha now?</br>  <br>The Megumifag that is raging ITT is the worst poster.

There is nothing to criticize. <br>Holy shit. Megumifags are seriously delusional and bad.<br><br><br>Calling Eriri shit isn't the same as arguing against his point. Try again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People are just laughing at your autism at this point.</br>  <br> Holy shit. Megumifags are seriously delusional and bad. <br> can only call other people delusional without any support </br></br>  Megumifags are samefagging and can't argue give proper arguments. Why am I not surprised?  <br>I see only one stupid erishitfag samefagging and crying along the thread.</br>  <br>There is only one post calling Eriri a shit. Where's the spam you're talking about?</br>  <br> waaaaaaah megumifags shitposters stop attacking me </br>  <br> Eririfags are samefagging and can't argue give proper arguments. <br><br>Fixed your post.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because the shitposter in question is samefagging.

This thread now <br>Megumifags are the worst.</br>  <br> this new to the board </br>  inb4 that "one" Eririfag complaining about Megumifags being mean, mean bullies.  <br>There is one, maybe two people who argued properly with an Eririfag. They are the ONLY non-shitposters ITT. The rest of you are all spamming a shit and throwing shit at each other.</br>  <br><br>One girl dominates the rest while there a couple persistent fans who defend the worst girl. It's not even a war, more like a slaughter.</br></br>  <br> bawwww i didn't get away with my shitposting </br>  <br>Sorry, I haven't followed threads related to this before but I guess that's wrong :^)<br><br><br>Seems like it</br></br></br></br>  <br> megumi <br> flat </br></br>  <br>I can't defend this girl, she is not only tsundere but also retarded. She's everything wrong.</br>  <br>Megumifags are FAR worst though. It's objective fact that anyone can see from observing this thread from the start. Nothing but shit this and that without valid arguments and samefag when they get called out for being worst shitposters.</br>  <br><br>Flat refers to the tone of her voice. Her body is supposed to be perfect.</br></br>  Wait, There are people that likes shitty tsundere and Slut senpai?  <br>Your pathetic attempts at twisting the events of the thread are laughable.</br>  <br> eriri </br>  <br> valid arguments <br><br>They always make well-written posts when they argue while Eririfags can only post "Megumi a shit" without any justification.</br></br></br>  <br> shitty tsundere <br>You are retarded, Eriri is just perfect.</br></br>  <br>Eriri is always overshadowed by the two superior girls.</br>  <br>This thread was bad from the start. Megumifags starting shit and acting like they have the high ground is obnoxious.</br>  <br>This. Erishitters are beyond salvation.</br>  <br><br> See first 15 posts <br> Zero valid arguments <br>Nice denial, Megumifags. Rest of the thread is exactly like that save for the argument about Eriri being wrong or not between, which really is the only civil and non-shitposts in here.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This guy is about to explode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Two are mine, you know.</br>  <br> i'll just conveniently call every detracting poster a Megumifag to win the argument, tehee! </br>  <br><br>Calling her a generic tsundere is a valid argument because it is true. Eririfags have literally nothing to fling at Megumi.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This Megumifag is about to explode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus, embarrassing.</br>  <br> posts with less than one minute in-between <br> Eririfag can't even keep up with the speed of the thread and people calling him out <br> samefag <br><br>You're just retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this <br><br>Unfortunately for you, there's more than one Megumifag.</br></br></br>  <br> Megumifag pretending to be retarded <br> Still deflecting <br><br><br>That's no more valid than calling Megumi boring.

Now fuck off and stop derailing this thread with your terminal autism.</br></br></br>  <br> That's no more valid than calling Megumi boring <br><br>It is because it's true.When people call Megumi boring they promptly get BTFO while Eririfags can't even deny that she's a generic tsundere.</br></br></br>  <br> posts with less than one minute in-between <br>Not for that mad Megumifag.<br><br>Keep defending the samefag.<br><br><br>Apply yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> quotes all the posts he can that are calling that cancerous Eririfag out and says it's the same poster <br> no dude, you're retarded, there's more than one person doing that <br> b-but it is still a mad Megumifag! ignore my backpedalling please! <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Doesn't apply the same "retarded" logic back at Megumifags who calls any post hating Megumi Eririfags <br>Why don't you fuck off and stop derailing?<br><br><br> it's true <br> Only my opinions are facts! <br>Megumifags are the worst alright. <br> can't even deny that she's a generic tsundere. <br>No, it's called opinion, so they can argue that she feels different. Get over it, shitposter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why don't you fuck off and stop derailing? <br><br>Because, too bad for you, in this case our little shitposter-kun - if you are not him you're still a faggot for defending him - is a self-proclaimed Eririfag that started all this shit.</br></br></br>  <br> this samage control <br> "d-don't bully me!" </br></br>  <br> I'm going to pretend the obvious and mad as fuck Megumifag spamming "erishitters" isn't same person <br> Even though said Megumifag is consistent and displays the same retarded and rage attitude <br><br>There's no backpedal.

Some can be different. Your argument sucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The Eririfag arguing now has a valid point no matter how much Megumifags want to deny it and slander him. If Megumifags think they're the better fans, then why not be civil and less trying to invalidate him by spamming at him with retorts that doesn't prove him wrong?  <br> Ok, with those two being rekt like that, Megu's only left.  But... Tomo's not actually 3d girl enthusiast. How...?</br>  <br>Do you even know what backpedalling means? I'm not surprised though.

Though frankly, this does not shock me. <br><br><br>Point it out please.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megumi is so perfect that makes him forget the difference between 2D and 3D.</br>  <br> How is she wrong for doing just that? <br><br>She joined the normalfags and ignored him when he needed help most. <br><br> Eriri doesn't have a clue how Tomoya felt. And Tomoya wasn't destroyed. He made his otaku kingdom, for fuck's sake. <br><br>But he got beat up by bullies, and that hurt. All Eriri had to do was play the normalfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a Megufag, but prove that shit.</br>  <br><br>Megumi was the one who inspired him to create the ideal heroine. She was described as the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.</br></br>  <br> She kept on being my ideal heroine. <br> “As long as Katou…” <br> Today, Katou really was just like a jack-in-the box. She was flat, fun to hang out with, someone who didn’t even feel like the opposite gender. She had a sharp tongue, a dark side, yet she was also someone dear and sweet. &gt;She was delicate, sly, troublesome… <br> “…as long as Megumi is here, I feel like we’ll make it through, somehow.” <br> …and to top it all off, someone I could always rely on. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they can't. Stalling, deflecting, and slandering is all they can do at this point.<br><br><br>I do, but go ahead and enlightened me on how I did so, shitposter. You're the one who made the claim first and all. <br><br><br> Two-faced in a refreshing way, meta knowledge about tsundere that makes her play it straight by trying not to be one, childhood otaku, rather chase after her dream than to be with the person she loves most <br><br><br><br> More s-s-samefag! <br>Can Megumifags get any worse?<br><br><br>Delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, bingo.</br>  <br> replying to your own post again in a successive manner while replying to everyone else as well <br><br>So obvious again.</br></br></br>  <br> when he needed help most.  <br>For what? Tomoya did a decent job at making his otaku kingdom.<br><br> But he got beat up by bullies, and that hurt. <br>That's not Eriri's fault and not something she has control over. Blaming her for that is utterly retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I can't argue, so I'll just keep calling him samefag! <br>Pathetic Megumifag.</br></br>  <br> do, but go ahead and enlightened me on how I did so <br>You can't even spell correctly. You quoted a bunch of posts and claimed samefag, and then backpedalled when you got called out on your stupidity. Fuck off already</br></br>  <br> For what? <br><br>From getting beat up. A good friend doesn't let her friend get beat up on her watch. <br><br> That's not Eriri's fault and not something she has control over. Blaming her for that is utterly retarded. <br><br>She didn't do anything to stop it. There were probably times when she watched him get beat up and didn't do anything to help.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I can't argue, so I'll keep shitposting! <br><br>Literally Eririfags. Don't be so mad because anyone who isn't retarded can see through your pathetic samefagging.</br></br></br>  This erishitter sure is desperate. How long will he keep embarrassing himself?  <br> meta knowledge about tsundere that makes her play it straight by trying not to be one <br> childhood friend <br> otaku <br>So original and refreshing alright. She's a cookiecutter tsundere from head to shoes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She didn't do anything to stop it. There were probably times when she watched him get beat up and didn't do anything to help. <br><br>How can such a demon exist?<br><br> there are erishitters autists who will defend this </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> meta knowledge about tsundere that makes her play it straight by trying not to be one <br><br>That just makes it worse. <br><br> rather chase after her dream than to be with the person she loves most <br><br>Probably the only valid point in your post. Being a childhood otaku doesn't mean anything in terms of personality, and "two-faced in a refreshing way" is super vague.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Eriri: shittiest tsundere that I have had the misfortune of watching<br><br>Utaha: sadistic slut<br><br>Megumi: boring autistic girl<br><br>Cousin: shitty slut<br><br>There is no way you can defend this shit of a show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> replying to yourself </br>  <br> Megumi: boring autistic girl <br><br>So you didn't watch the show.</br></br></br>  <br> Grammar ad hominem <br><br> bunch of posts <br>Which are all from the same person. It's so fucking obvious since he keeps making the same shitposts and underage insult with unbelievable mad.<br><br> backpedalled  <br>Too bad I didn't. You're not even explaining how I did. Great job, retard.<br><br><br>You Megumifags have proven you can't argue ITT. You can't prove me wrong at all.<br><br>Yeah sure. Don't get mad just because there is more than one person who hates Megumi and can see the shit you are doing by samefaging and deflecting from the point that you keep proving me right. <br><br><br>Cool opinion. I'm sure you can make me other tsunderes just like her, right?<br><br><br> worse <br>Because?<br> childhood otaku doesn't mean anything in terms of personality <br>Except it does. How a childhood friend acts to another childhood friend is transparent. They have a special connection that is different from just friends. They can act natural and without reservation around each other, which they do when they drop their guard.<br> super vague. <br>Daggers. Just daggers in contrast to her angelic facade.<br><br><br>You already replied. Stop samefagging.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boring? Maybe, but she has a ridiculously sharp tongue for a person with a quiet demeanor. That's the charm.<br><br>Autistic? What are you even smoking?</br></br></br>  <br> Which are all from the same person. <br>They aren't you fucking retard. That's the point of saying that some posts have less than one minute of difference. <br><br> You're not even explaining how I did <br>Except I did, twice. Good job being an illiterate retard who can't understand anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Man, you guys are so touchy. Is everyone who opposes you samefag in your head? I called it as I saw it and you guys still haven't replied back to me to at least debunk my point.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit, only Eririfags are autsitic enough to deliver such autistic posts.</br>  <br>Low powerlevel detected? You have Houki, Sera, maybe Kirino who are far worse.</br>  <br>Anon. I say this as someone who hates Megumi and like Eriri: it's time to stop. Half the fags replying to you are baiting and the others don't care. You fall for their trap if you keep going.</br>  <br> You can't prove me wrong at all. <br><br>Except you've been proven wrong over and over again. It must be chill living in your own autistic bubble, but everyone can see that Eririfags are trying too hard.<br><br><br>It's just a pattern that I see every fucking time an Eririfag is "arguing". You don't even bother to change your writing style and the way you cheer for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of those girl had there moments to shine, eriri's time to "shine" was her worst showing. She is the worst, deal with it.</br>  <br> moments to shine <br>Houki has none. I can say that for certain.<br><br>Unless you hate tsundere or something, Eriri does have good moments too before, during, and after her arc. The highlight of her arc is a hit and miss, so that's arguable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a pleb that don't even know what backpedaling is (which you have done all along all the thread). Please cease your existence.</br>  <br> I'm sure you can make me other tsunderes just like her, right? <br><br>What the fuck are you even trying to say? Even Eriri's design screams generic all over the place. She couldn't be any more uninspired as character. She adds nothing new to the tsundere archetype.</br></br></br>  <br> this <br> entire <br> post </br></br></br>  <br> Houki has none. </br>  <br> proven wrong over and over again <br>Then it should be an easy job for you to point out the posts that does that. After all this time, you haven't done that when repeated asked. <br> Eririfags <br>Oh so it's fags now? I'm sure this totally isn't a backpedal or anything when you just change your argument for your own convenience to look less of a shitposter.<br><br> pattern <br> writing style <br>I wasn't and still aren't him. But funny, I can say the same shit about you whenever the shit that gets fling veers towards Megumi and her fans. Then all of a sudden an influx of posts conveniently attempts to claim they're right and oh so perfect as Megumifags who cant' do wrong, and circlejerk about it while slandering any Eririfags who dares point out how bad they are being.<br><br><br> Can't do it <br>As expected. Oh yes, such a good argument. Typical Megumiag.<br><br><br>So you can't. Good to know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why should I spot how retarded you are while everyone can see it you filthy erishitter</br>  <br> Then it should be an easy job for you to point out the posts that does that <br><br>See this thread and the posts opposing you. <br><br>And by Eririfags I mean Eririfags in general in this whole thread, not just your pathetic samefag showing.<br><br> I can say the same shit <br><br>That isn't even the point. You don't see Megumifags congratulating or pretending to be different people while talking with themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't what? First I would have to understand what you were trying to say with your badly written sentences.</br>   this thread <br> Eririfags <br><br>Holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I hate to break it you, but you are doing one hell of a job proving the Eririfag you're arguing with right. It must be inconceivable for your mind to accept someone else is opposing you. From now on, I think I have good reasons to speak badly about how Megumifags behave.</br></br>  Fact: Megumi is literally perfect. Eririfags cannot deny this.  <br> doing that again <br><br>Interesting.</br></br></br>  <br> Megumi <br> autistic <br><br>She's literally the opposite of autistic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And now it is time to say that Megumifags are terribad. But maybe you're a reverse troll? Nah. Not at this point.</br>  <br>Her fans, cancerous as they are, are marginally less terrible than Megumifags. That's the best I can do.</br>  <br>Keep crying.</br>  <br><br>Megumifags have done literally nothing wrong.</br></br>  <br>I couldn't agree more.</br>  <br> eririfag falseflagging <br><br>Tsk. Tsk.</br></br></br>  <br>Pathetic.</br>  <br> Proof: this thread <br>It's true.</br></br>  <br> The pointed out mad samefagging Megumifag who can't argue is replying to me as if he has any credibility now <br><br><br>Oh wow. You still can't do it. You just can't and you know it. My point has never been overturned. You and other tryhard Megumifags can only insult and deflect the main issue, and that is Megumifags are the WORST shitposters ITT. And the hypocrisy that this thread shows is undeniable. Always groundlessly claim no valid criticism for Megumi, but ignore how you guys aren't any different when it comes to Eriri.<br><br> don't see Megumifags congratulating or pretending to be different people while talking with themselves. <br>Absolute denial. Of course you'd do that. Since it comes down to this, I can say the same thing and you can only chew it right back. It's funny now, you're the one who keep embarrassing yourself over this matter.<br><br><br> This is how I run away <br>So typical of Megumifags.<br><br><br><br>They are. After all this, I don't think anyone sane enough aside from delusional Megumifags can deny it. Megumifags thinks they and their girl are so perfect and free from doing wrong, it might as well be trolling, but no they're just retarded. The last thing they can do now is to deny and deny my main point. Deflecting and straying from that point while you try to badmouth and worthless arguments that doesn't disprove it. That's all they mostly have done since this shit started (which they ironically started).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I haven't watched the show so I wouldn't be able to defend any of the girls if my life depended on it. What I do know is the autism in these threads (and others) are represented best by the most popular girl's fans. Though that's not saying much because the tsunderefags for once are very few. You can probably count them on one hand.<br><br> Tsk <br>inb4 "literally Reddit" post</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Eriri &gt; Megumi <br>Superior opinion. <br> Eririfags &gt; Megumifags <br>Fact, not opinion.</br></br></br></br>  <br> all this autistic tirade about the mean Megumifags bullies that don't let you shitpost and run away <br><br>You give your fellow Eririfags a bad name.</br></br></br>  <br> Megumifags thinks they and their girl are so perfect and free from doing wrong, it might as well be trolling, but no they're just retarded.  <br><br>Name a way in which Megumi is a bad or boring character.</br></br></br>  <br>Pot calling kettle black.</br>  <br>Funny thing, I haven't seen this show at all. I was making comments based on the reactions and shitpostings from this thread. Yes, I can Eririfags and your bad posts in here too, but Megumifags seemingly are worse by a large margin.</br>  <br> and that is Megumifags are the WORST shitposters ITT. <br><br>No. Those are the Eririfags. Megumifags since the start were calling them out and pointing out their shitposting. <br><br> I can say the same thing and you can only chew it right back <br>I dare you to find a Megumifag post in the same vein as the typical Eririfag trying to sound neutral yet completely supporting "another" Eririfag in their arguments. You can't.<br><br> It's funny now, you're the one who keep embarrassing yourself over this matter. <br>Could you be any more ironic? You're pretty much alone against everyone in the thread. Okay, fine, let's pretend the other poster is actually a different person. So, you're still being ridiculed by everyone else in the thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Superior opinion.  <br> worse personality <br> worse looks <br><br>How about no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I haven't seen this show <br> bothering with a thread of a show you haven't even seen <br> bothering with a fanbase you know nothing of <br> yet you somehow already know the names of the characters and the main fanbases <br> suspiciously trying to make Eririfags look better no matter what without actually looking at the thread <br> doing this much of a bad and half-assed work  <br><br>You're not fooling anyone, Eririfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megumi &gt; Eriri<br><br>Megumifags &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Eririfags</br></br></br>  <br>You're acting a lot like those Megumifags you're raging about, you know. Megumifags, Eririfags, you're all the same shits. There's just a lot more of the former and they win by drowning the latter out.<br><br>I don't think I've seen this big of an imbalance in a waifu war since forever. Usually the smaller (and usually the loserfags') crowd gives up and disappears, but with faggots like you around no wonder these threads are still alive.<br><br><br>Not him but I haven't watched the show, I just fap to the girls.  I fapped to you're waifu. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ever heard of google? Yeah, it's useful.<br><br>The amount of autism and sperg posts attracted me. I sided with the side that I saw less cancerous. It is that simple.</br></br></br>  <br>You have zero business here. Get out.</br>  <br> I sided with the side that I saw less cancerous <br>Come over to the Cousinfags' club, we have cake and ice cream.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit your mental retardation is beyond help.</br>  <br>Wait. I checked spoilers and summaries. Where does it say that Eriri knew that Tomoya was getting physically beaten up? She knows that the bullies were still making fun of Tomoya, which is normal since that was something that happened even before Eriri befriended Tomoya. But getting beaten up? I don't think she knew. But even if she did knew, that is beyond her control.<br><br>Aren't you being unreasonable? If she wanted to save herself, why get dragged into the mess of getting bullied again by trying to stop the bullying? Self-preservation in that light isn't a bad as you try to make it sound.</br></br></br>  <br>Girls have every right to masturbate too</br>  <br>You are an ape.</br>  <br><br>What is this? Getting mad because someone who hasn't seen the show can still call out a fanbase for being cancerous?<br><br><br> Cousin <br> incest <br>How isn't she the best girl?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> do nothing to stop MC getting bullied <br> try to intervene, get bullied and raped and failing to stop MC getting bullied <br>She made the right choice, because doujins have taught us 2D girls are secretly sexually frustrated sluts who become cumdumps when they mouth off to bullies.<br> tfw no Eriri rape doujins <br>;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The light novels described it as physical bullying. I don't think there are any summaries on that. The point is that her social status in the classroom was more important than her friendship with Tomoya. I don't think she even bothered properly telling him what she was doing.</br></br>  why are megumifags such cancer?<br>Is it because they know their girl is shit and they can't do anything about it other than shitpost?</br>  <br>You are autistic, that's why. No one gives a shit about you though.</br>  <br> Megumi <br> autistic </br></br>  <br>Fuck off Eririfag.</br>  <br>she was best girl of the season since ep 0</br>  <br> Houki has none <br>Get a load of this fagtron</br></br>  <br>Cool shitpost again, Eririfag.</br>  <br><br>You Eririfags can't give a single valid reason on why Megumi is shit.</br></br>  <br> How isn't she the best girl? <br>She is</br></br>  +300 posts of pure shitpost  <br><br> replying to b8 every time <br>It's like I'm in a Raildex thread</br></br></br>  <br>This thread reminds me a lot of when the show was airing.</br>  <br>Nice shitposting erishit shitposter</br>  <br><br>It's just to drive in the point that Eririfags can't give a single good argument on why Megumi is a bad character.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but that shit was more intense back then.</br>  <br>Don't misunderstand, anon.</br>  <br> soon we will be able to relive that intensity <br><br>I'm glad.</br></br></br>  <br> Raildex thread <br> Eririfags also remind me of the same shit Mikotofags do in those threads. Coincidence? </br></br>  <br>They can't, that's why they're so mad and resort to baits.<br><br> tfw I'm an Eririfag who lurks and scrounges pics of her while the girl and fellow fans are pariah ITTs and making themselves look worse every time  It's not a very good feeling.<br><br><br>I'm not ready for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all this autistic tirade about the mean Eririfags bullies that don't let you shitpost and run away <br>Pot calling the kettle black.<br><br><br> boring  <br> autistic <br>Valid opinion from someone who hates all girls. No better than anything else Megumifags give in here. So deal with that .<br><br><br>Irony.<br><br><br>You can't twist history of this thread when it's right in front of us, Megumifags shitpost first and literally kept throwing shit. Eririfags gave opinions back that generally did the same. But Megumifags were the ones who got super mad, as seen in their constant replies to Eririfags, which makes them worse. One Megumifag in particular was raging and samefagging and he got pointed out, which In the end, you couldn't and still can't deny . <br><br> same vein as the typical Eririfag trying to sound neutral yet completely supporting "another" Eririfag in their arguments <br>I like how you have to nitpick at the former to ignore the latter for pretending to be someone else. There's at least one very obvious Megumi samefag. The aforementioned samefag from above does well to show that. Given your determined stance, you can't say otherwise since I can say the same thing.<br><br> everyone <br> there are only Megumifags like me in this whole thread! <br>Keep embarrassing yourself. 4-5 autistic Megumifags isn't even quarter of the posters itt. Nice backpedal when you decided to acknowledge other Eririfags, by the way.<br><br><br>I could care less.<br><br>And too bad for them how I act is still going to be shitty than them. My point still stands and that's what matters in this argument. They can try to win by pathetically trying to drown, but if they can't even prove me wrong then that only makes them worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pot calling the kettle black. <br>Except Eririfags shitpost first and then play the victim when they get shit back like the little bitches they are.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>   Megumifags being a shit <br>Every Saenai thread ever.</br>  <br> boring <br> autistic <br><br>All wrong. When you use vague criticisms like that you should use support from the show itself.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Eririfags being a shit and getting their asses handed to them <br><br>No surprise here.</br></br></br>  <br>A reasonable and civil Eririfag still exists? Good for you.</br>  <br> Eririfags shitpost first  <br> First few replies are nothing but shitposts <br> Most of the thread is of the same kind of shitposts that barely make valid reasons why she's shit <br>Megumifags playing victim when they and their girl get shitpost back and dare to say they're innocent and not worse? Hilarious denial.<br><br><br>It's good enough for Eriri for Megumifags, so why isn't it good enough for Megumi herself? Hypocrites, of course.<br><br><br>Worst fans for worst girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We have 5 months after all</br></br>  <br> One Megumifag in particular was raging and samefagging <br>In response to an even worse Eririfag. In fact, shit would have probably ended there but this Eririfag post  ignited the flames again. This is why you're the worst shitposters ITT. This whole thread has been a shitfest, but Eririfags throw the stone and hide the hand. So fucking typical.<br><br> Nice backpedal when you decided to acknowledge other Eririfags <br>I never made a claim that there was only one Eririfags in this thread, so no backpedal. Your points are all taken down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's good enough for Eriri for Megumifags, so why isn't it good enough for Megumi herself? Hypocrites, of course. <br><br>Nope, Megumifags will often use scenes from the show to support their argument. Meanwhile, I don't think you can give any solid evidence that Megumi is boring or autistic.</br></br></br>  <br>People were calling Eririfags out personally to begin with, based on their shitposts. Who started complaining about a fanbase in general? Yeah, you .</br>  <br>I might as well not exist, given the poison in this thread <br><br>I'm just sad that such a cute and (in my view) dynamic character gets this much hate because of awful fans, you see girls doing far worse in other shows and being accepted on /a/ all the time because fuck you. I've given up though.<br><br><br>Who knows, maybe we'll be surprised like with Shokugeki no Souma. People were saying how the threads will be atrocious before that aired but look at it now, probably the only high-profile show this season with halfway decent threads. I can dream, can't I?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I could care less. <br>So you acknowledge that you're cancer and a hypocrite as well. How you act does nothing but bring the threads down. But if fighting against everyone and trying to be a martyr is a favorite pastime of yours, then go ahead.</br></br>  <br>Anybody have that punch to the face in png format?</br>  <br>Just curious, are you also ?</br>  <br>Yes. Why?</br>  <br>No because I like Megumi too, just not as much as Eriri. <br><br>All the girls in this show are honestly great, I'd waifu any of them in a heartbeat, and the fact that the ongoing shitfest in this thread is more about fans than characters says something.</br></br></br>   megumifags: why is megumi a shit? Please state a reason <br><br>Is that supposed to be a rethorical question?<br>Because if not, then I don't know what to tell you.<br><br>It's like asking: why does shit smell bad?<br><br>Well, it's because it's shit; there is no point to come up with a reason as to why that is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're cool anon.<br><br> and the fact that the ongoing shitfest in this thread is more about fans than characters says something. <br>It's not a suprise anymore for us. More or less 60% of the shitfests in Saekano threads are about the fanbases.</br></br></br></br>  anyone else watch this show?<br><br>Shinsekai Yori<br><br><br>Just finished it and one of my all time fav now</br></br></br></br></br>  anyone else watch this show?<br><br>Neon Genesis Evangelion<br><br><br>Just finished it and one of my all time fav now</br></br></br></br></br>  anyone else watch this show?<br><br>Attack on Titan<br><br><br>Just finished it and one of my all time fav now</br></br></br></br></br>  anyone else watch this show?<br><br>Mobile suit gundam<br><br>Just finished it and one of my all time fav now</br></br></br></br>  Anyone else watch this show? <br><br>Chopper no Flopper <br><br><br>Just finished it and one of my all time fav now</br></br></br></br></br>  anyone else watch this show?<br><br>Doctor Chichibuyama<br><br>I haven't.
