[ Saekano volume 8 is out. I'll be posting summaries and dumping pics. This is my first time doing a summary, so I wasn't really sure what was fine to omit and wasn't, so if you have any questions or anything to add, please do so.  I look forward to the return of our goddess.  First for best girl! The post before me doesn't count!      Eririfags desperate as always.   Just post everything you want to summary   So, Ak-kun   ...yeah   It's research, Aki-kun.    Research, huh. I guess we can't do much about it.    Yeah, we can't.   ...Don't let go.   As long as Aki-kun grips on tight, we'll be fine.           Forgot pic.      can't do much about it.   *it can't be helped     Thanks for doing a summary. I look forward to seeing what this volume is about.       Prologue   The novel starts with Tomoya, Michiru, and Izumi gathered in his room to celebrate the creation of their new circle. Michiru questions Tomoya on the state of the circle now that Eriri and Utaha have left. Tomoya doesn’t take being reminded of the two leaving very well, but Izumi reassures Tomoya by saying that she won’t let the circle die. The conversation takes a darker turn when Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her. Tomoya panics and tells her to stop making her character develop like that. Michiru comments that nothing could have been done about the two leaving. When Tomoya asks why, she responds by saying that the two had lost the fight for survival within the circle. At that moment, Megumi enters with the drinks, right when Michiru explains that Megumi had kicked the two out of the circle, using an analogy of someone’s wife delivering punishment. Megumi is displeased and tells them to stop making her seem like someone so mean, but everyone is visibly scared of her. They move on with the party. Megumi encourages Tomoya to do the toast. The prologue ends with everyone shouting kanpai.     Chapter 1   Tomoya is talking with his classmate Yoshihiko in the classroom. When he asks why Tomoya hasn’t updated his blog in a while, Tomoya says that he’s busy. Eriri comes over, greets them, and sits down. Yoshihiko tries to ask Tomoya if there is really nothing between him and Eriri, but he dodges the questions. Tomoya reminisces about how rumors had started after he and Eriri started regularly going to school together after winter comiket. He also comments how more rumors started when they seemed more distant to each other after spring break. Tomoya’s phone rings, and it turns out that Eriri had just messaged him about how his new game is coming along. He responds that things are going well, but Eriri doesn’t like his tone. She questions if he’s still holding a grudge. The conversation gets heated to the point where Eriri stops texting and just asks him out loud what was up with what happened between him and Utaha at the train station. There’s a bit of an awkward silence. After class, Eriri apologizes to Tomoya. Izumi shows up in the classroom with two of her classmates who want to join the circle. Eriri is against them joining, saying that amateurs and non-otaku shouldn’t join. Izumi counters by saying that Tomoya was an amateur at first too, and the two classmates reveal that they watch anime too. Eriri can’t think of anything else to say, so she storms out of the classroom while Tomoya takes the two classmates away to explain the circle. She meets Megumi as she exits. They have an awkward greeting and soon go their separate ways.        Yoshihiko   I miss that guy      Chapter 2   Tomoya meets Utaha as he leaves the school. She has him accompany her to a café. They talk about college, which Utaha says that she hasn’t gone to since it’s just orientation, and about the two classmates, who Utaha guesses didn’t join because Tomoya was overenthusiastic and scared them away. She turns out to be right on that one, and Tomoya. Utaha asks how Megumi is doing and says that Tomoya should keep an eye on her since, despite her appearance, she is actually quite dark inside. Tomoya asks her not to joke about that because he’s been worrying about that too. Utaha then asks Tomoya if he’s told Megumi that Utaha was his first and wonders how Megumi would react. She considers calling her on the phone right there, but Tomoya stops her exclaiming that it’s rude to call people in the middle of conversation. Next, Tomoya asks how Utaha’s work is coming along with Field’s Chronicle. She responds, “How should I answer? If I said that now was the most fulfilling part of my life in the passionate way you always speak, what would you do?” Tomoya says that he would wait in line in excitement for the game, which Utaha compares to NTR. They leave the café and talk as they walk while holding hands. Utaha encourages him to work hard for his circle, to which Tomoya replies that he’ll do his best and that one day they should gather together to discuss how their work is coming along.   (There were a lot of dirty jokes this chapter, and Tomoya notices that Utaha has been making more than usual, but some have been omitted because it would be way too long otherwise)     Were you somehow inspired by Spyro?    Chapter 3    Tomoya and Megumi are planning the schedule for the circle. Megumi is worried that the schedule might be too hard, but Tomoya reassures her that they have last year’s experience. She replies with how they had scheduling troubles even with Utaha and that artist by their side. Tomoya asks her why she properly referred to Utaha by name but not Eriri. Megumi is silent for a while before replying that it was just a mistake. Tomoya replies that there’s no way that’s the case because when she’s quiet like that for more than five seconds she’s scary. She explains that she never understood why Eriri quit the circle. Tomoya answers that doing so is probably just in a creator’s nature, though even he admits to not understanding what exactly that is. Their conversation is interrupted by Michiru, who turns out to have been there for a while and was just ignored. Megumi decides to go on a break while Michiru talks to Tomoya about how she wants him to set up more concerts and help make a CD. She pushes him down on the bed and begs him to help, but Megumi walks in on them. The scene shifts to them discussing who does what in the circle. Tomoya has too many roles and needs to quit some of them. Midway through discussing, Megumi falls asleep from exhaustion. When she wakes up, Michiru and Tomoya are playing a visual novel, with Michiru begging him to stop. The game turned out to be really awful. Michiru falls asleep on the bed while Megumi takes her turn at the game. Tomoya thanks her for working so hard but reminds her that, in the end, it’s just a game.     Chapter 4   Tomoya goes over to Izumi’s house. He has her look at the plans for the game and asks for her opinion. Instead of answering, Izumi asks him to leave her room. He goes to the living room where he has Iori look over the plans. Iori comments that it puts a lot of pressure on the artist since she has to match up to Eriri but also remarks that that’s probably not the reason Izumi had Tomoya leave. Izumi calls Tomoya back to her room to show her sketches of Meguri that she had drawn based off the plans. There were three sketches, one in Eriri’s style, one in her own style, and one that looked like Megumi. Tomoya also notices that scattered all around the room are other sketches of Meguri, with varying hairstyles and expressions, and thinks that these are all a hundred percent Meguri. Tomoya asks her if she’ll do the drawings, but she’s confused since she thought the whole point of the meeting was to fix the character design. Later, as Iori accompanies Tomoya to the station, he advises Tomoya to finish the sub-heroines first since he’d lose all motivation to write after finishing the main heroine.     Chapter 5   Eriri calls Tomoya on Skype asking if Megumi is in the room. He answers no and asks if she still hasn’t made up with Megumi yet. Seeing that she hasn’t, he recommends that she do it soon. Eriri asks him for help, but he refuses, saying that Megumi is scary when she’s angry. He tells her to face Megumi and talk to her seriously by herself. Their Skype conversation moves to Eriri venting about her coworkers and how hard her work is to Tomoya. When the conversation shifts to Tomoya talking about how good Izumi’s character design was, Eriri isn’t very enthusiastic. Tomoya asks if she’s still scared of Izumi, she says that you don’t suddenly grow just because you become a pro. Tomoya reassures her by saying that she’s grown a lot the past few months. That cheers Eriri up, and she asks him if he thinks her drawings are better than Izumi’s. As the circle representative, Tomoya refuses to comment. The conversation ends with Tomoya leaving since he has to get back to work.      Utaha asks how Megumi is doing and says that Tomoya should keep an eye on her since, despite her appearance, she is actually quite dark inside.   Oh man, her dark vindictive side is still there.      For a moment there I read Saikano. Then I remmebered Saikano. Then I got depressed.      Chapter 6   Tomoya and Megumi meet Iori at the café and have him look at the revised plan for the game since Tomoya wants him to be the manager of the circle. After looking at the plan, Iori refuses, saying that it won’t sell. When Tomoya asks him what he should do to fix that, Iori responds by saying that he has no idea. Megumi interrupts the conversation and says that what Iori is doing isn’t fair because he hasn’t given a reason why it won’t sell. Tomoya says that it’s fine and that they’ll go back and fix the plan. After setting up what day to meet with him again, Tomoya leaves, but Iori comments that Megumi is heavy. It turns out that she had fallen asleep.     Chapter 7   Tomoya and Megumi are having dinner at his house. Megumi has some doubts about whether they can trust Iori on this one, but Tomoya reassures her that when it comes to knowing whether or not something will sell, he is no match for him. They move on to fixing the plan. Several hours pass. Megumi asks the event where the heroine sees the MC off with a smile when he ditches her on a date for another girl but then gets angry once he’s gone is original or based on an experience. Tomoya claims no recollection for something like that. They keep working until two at night, but they still haven’t found anything wrong. They decide to go to sleep for the day. After waking up and eating breakfast, they continue to work but still have no idea. Megumi comments that all the heroines are done so well that it’s impossible to even tell who the main one is anymore which causes Tomoya to realize what’s wrong with the plan.     Chapter 8   Tomoya and Megumi are at the café with Iori. He congratulates them on realizing what was wrong and agrees to be the manager. Once everything is over, both pass out from exhaustion in the café. Later, Tomoya tells Megumi that they should go on a date to gather data for the Meguri route. Megumi suggests going to an amusement park, but Tomoya says no, the reason being that he had already been there for research for the previous game (in his mind, he adds that he went with Eriri). Eventually they settle for Rokutenba Mall. Like the previous time, they plan out what shops they are going to go to first. After shopping a bit, they get to the part with the escalator and the crowd. Just like last time, they hold hands to get through it. They reach the glasses shop, and Megumi suggests buying a new item to commemorate their date since the last one got taken by Eriri. Tomoya is against it because it’s too much like a yandere overwriting memories. She offers buying chains, a leather jacket, and nose piercings for an image change instead, to which Tomoya responds, “What kind of boyfriend are you trying to raise, main heroine!?” The scene switches to them at the food court. Megumi tells Tomoya about the time she met Eriri at the mall and how it sparked their friendship. Her face turns sad as she remembers how their friendship was broken. Seeing that, Tomoya asks if he should set the two up so that they could rebuild their friendship. Megumi responds by saying that it would be wrong to request that of Tomoya, but if Eriri is okay with it, then she’ll do it. Two hours pass, and they’re walking back home. Megumi decides to play the main heroine again and asks him to turn on the recorder.   (I’ll just translate the rest of the chapter and put it along the picture)     Rest of chapter 8   “I guess I’ll play the main heroine one last time.”   “Katou…?”   Just as were about to reach the top of the hill…   “Just for now, can you turn off the recorder?”   “Huh, why?”   After giving that strange request, she ran past me with a light dash and gazed back at me with a warm look, although, in truth, the evening sun made it so that I couldn’t really tell what expression she had.    “Hey, Aki-kun…no, Tomoya-kun.”   Even so, that voice and those words were enough to put that image in my mind.    “Do you remember? It’s been exactly a year since then.”   “Katou…”   Of course I remember. That was when I was fruitlessly racking my brain for ideas on the plot.    “Am I closer to the heroine of your story than I was a year ago?”   Back then, Katou was supposed to be at Hokkaido, but, unable to just stand by and watch me struggle, she prioritized me over her family and came back.    “Am I someone dependable?”   You were already someone dependable.    “And do you remember what happened about a month ago?”   “Hey, wait…”   Well…even if I wanted to forget, I couldn’t. After all, I was sobbing my eyes out right in front of Katou.    “Right now, I don’t have Eriri or Kasumigaoka-senpai with me anymore…”   Katou continued to talk to me in a tender, unchanging voice.    “Even so, am I still able to cheer you up?”   I wasn’t sure if I could get any more embarrassed.    “Am I someone needed by you and the circle?”   She kept on being my ideal heroine.                            everyone is scared of Megumi   I like the smell of drama in the making.     “As long as Katou…”   Today, Katou really was just like a jack-in-the box. She was flat, fun to hang out with, someone who didn’t even feel like the opposite gender. She had a sharp tongue, a dark side, yet she was also someone dear and sweet. She was delicate, sly, troublesome…   “…as long as Megumi is here, I feel like we’ll make it through, somehow.”   …and to top it all off, someone I could always rely on.    “So let’s make sure to have a great time. Let’s cough up blood together.”   It was a good thing the recorder was stopped. I don’t think I could hear such embarrassing lines again.    “Let’s give our best together, Tomoya-kun.”   “Uhh…”   “Together, with everyone else, we’ll make the best game ever, right?”   “Uhh…!”   Why did I stop the recorder? I’m an idiot.             I love you OP.   Iori actually asked if Megumi was depressed and hearing that, Megumi's eyes turned lifeless.    Epilogue   #1 Eriri and Tomoya are on skype. She is shocked that Iori joined the circle. After a few exchanges on how surprising that is, the conversation moves to Eriri being overworked. She complains how they pile one character after another. A bit later, Tomoya tells Eriri that she’ll have her meet Megumi sometime next week. As the conversation ends, he remarks to himself that he has to do something about his habit of calling Megumi by her first name since he nearly let it slip several times talking to Eriri.   #2 Tomoya and Utaha are on the phone. He tells her that the circle will be watching the livestream of the game she and Eriri are working on. Hearing that, Utaha tells him that the Eriri now is not the one he knew before and that he should try not to make enemies with her. She also says that she wants him, Izumi, and Megumi to accept Eriri as she is now.  #3 The circle watches the livestream. After flashing the characters of the game, it turns out that all the pictures shown in the preview come together to form one giant picture. Everyone in the circle is shocked to see such a great picture from Eriri. Izumi is visibly scared to compete with someone like that, and Megumi slips back to calling Tomoya “Aki-kun.” Tomoya notes that Megumi’s voice had the sadness and pain of being left behind by a best friend along with the frustration of not being understood by that friend.      not a single illustration of Utaha, not even in the cover or inlays  LELOUCH BTFO    Lelouch isn't even aware this is based on a LN.   OP you are da real MVP    Okay, thanks. I thought he was literally calling her heavy.      What are you smoking?     Megumi best girl. Tomoya agrees, don't bother him about it.     Caring about Lelouch   Unable to read  I can't tell which one makes you more retarded.     Will Tomoya be able to reverse this yandere in the making before it's too late?   Afterword:   Nothing really important beyond Maruto himself being surprised at how much screentime Megumi had this volume and dispelling rumors that Saekano was a split cour from the start (it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations).    That's all. Thanks everyone for reading my shitty prose and summaries that have probably left out one too many things.      Really really thank you, OP.     I know that he's the Yahariguy, but I don't visit the threads enough to see him.      Every volume needs tons of Megumi screen time.    What are we going to do after next week? Is there any hope for more UFO Girl and Friends?   cri   I have hope for  s2   Did you see Reina today!!? did you see how  HETERO she is?   Why do we need constant back to back general threads?  Relevant: http://www.animemaru.com/hibike-eup<wbr>honium-episode-12-preview-shows-kum<wbr>iko-and-reina-scissoring/</wbr></wbr>     back to back threads = general threads  Why?     That's how popular anime works.   next episode is finale?  You may only chose one.   No, a dozen threads sprinkled across /a/ with the same dozen people flinging shit in all of them is much more fun.    Reina   Onee-chan or imouto?   Why not be the middle child and have both?    Onee-san.    Imouto because Onee-chans are already tainted temptresses.    Twin sister you fag    Neither because I'm not an incestuous faggot   imouto with oneesan personality  The answer is you should be open to both possibilities.  It would be mean to discriminate your sister, just because she was a bit older than you, or just because she's younger than you.  I would like to fuck Mikan senseless though.         Onee-san that looks like a imouto   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127070591  Please kill yourself.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127070591   The Irregular at Magic Middle School.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127070591  Boku no Cockblock    I suspected it was a bad idea to ask before i posted, thank you for confirming my suspicions. Somedat, my knowledge of /a/'s culture will eventually reach a level where I, too, can tell offenders to kill themselves     The safest thing to do is to Image Search. (And yeah, you get the answer for this one). The second is to bait people into answering for you.     You don't even have to do that, show's name is in the metadata.    not picking Onee-chan   Unless the onee-san is at least 3-5 years older then it might as well be an imouto.   how can i say not imouto after the qt3.14 you posted anon?    anime Mikan sucks   Who would stick their fingers in a marshmallow?   it sucks when you are the middle and all you have are brothers. fuck that shit.    That's old manga, Mikan looks more ugly there.  Anime is better.      Mein bruder   Oneesan, unless the imouto is Mikan, in that case Mikan   Anime is shit   Oneesan   Overprotective neesan   IMOUTO FOR LIFE    there will never be an anime or a manga about a delinquent oneesan protecting her otouto     Holy fuuuuuuck    Has Ishikei made anything new lately?    Onee-san   a significantly older Onee-chan that just hasn't moved out of the house and is drunk every night.    This man speaks truth.    Nee-sans of the triangle variety.   Unlucky Malcom     NBR  DROPPED    Onee-san   You don't deserve a nee-san.   Remove nee-san.   This, but only if you came out first so she still has to call you onii-chan.   <br/>   Onee-chan always.    I hate my one-chan so imoutos are best        Onee-san, how is this even a question?    Yes I would!  Especially because she's my sister.      Prove it    Wrong, I'd do anything for her, so if she wants to fuck I will    Why not both?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127083444  hownew.ru    The two toothbrush are touching.  Is his penis finally kissing his sister's womb?     Onee-chans are double edged blades. On one hand, they can be more voluptuous and therefore more attractive. On the other, they can become used goods quicker. I'm going to have to go with imoutos on this one.    Well since I would usually say "neither" I'm going to create a situation where I am forced to choose.  If my mind were warped so that I would have to have a fetish for one of those two then I would choose Onee-chan.  You see I wouldn't trust myself influencing lesser minds than my own, that is known as corruption and unlike Kyousuke or Haru I am not comfortable with reaping the rewards of manipulation.  Onee-chans are older and more experienced. They're far more likely to be aware of what they're doing and able to bear the responsibility of their actions. So naturally the only acceptable answer would be Onee-chans.  They also tend to be tall, have long dark hair, and be on the busty side. So naturally they're more womanly as well which is far more desirable than undeveloped and tiny.            She's so damn sexy     they can be more voluptuous and therefore more attractive  What about voluptuous imoutos?     christmas cake imouto    Has Mikan's belly been impregnated?    Anon please, she's just a child      I hope you mean pic unrelated because that's definitely a 12 y/o at best    It's the pineapple sex hair    Old enough to bleed, old enough to breed.    So you want some one who can fend for themselves? I can agree with that.    Eleven, actually    best friend that you call onee chan, when she is actually only a few days older than you.    This is loli... This doesn't feel right    Why contain it?    Onee-chan on face Imouto on dick     Is there actually anything like this?    More?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127083444  You dont deserve those trips.    I love that him fingering his little sister's asshole was animated.  Thank you Japan.     Considering picking up this series just because of OP webm?  Good or bad idea?      look up source   find it   look it up in my list   dropped at ep1   Is it worth it guys?         Read the manga, faggot.     The show can't hold a candle to our based god Yabuki     yes, S1 is not that good tho, 2 and 3 are breddy gud    It's sixty odd episodes of ecchi romcom that consists mostly of Rito falling and landing exclusively in someone's breasts, ass, or thighs or wacky hijinks caused by Lala's inventions. Watch it if you have the time and feel you can put up with it.  Alternatively: Read the fucking manga, faggot.      Love this artist.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127085241   start watching halfway through the series   HURRRRR, who are all these characters?!      I don't think I've seen it explicitly mentioned, but some sibling doujins have siblings in their twenties.    Isn't she NBR to him? I only have a vague knowledge of this series.    yes, he is adopted.    Ah, so NBR then.     This is one of my favorite manga, but I couldn't get past episode 4 of season 1 and I tried watching it several times Try Season 2, it's more true to the manga.<br/>     imoutos   As a person who has older sisters I choose Imoutos.    She has the hips and thighs of a big teen already  I want to impregnate her so badly      As someone who has neither I choose both.    How is she so perfect?    at least the op was top tier    As someone who has both i choose neither       As someone who has both I choose imouto.  Nee-sans a shit, imoutos are love.         You a shit   Your sister can't help it if she's a bit older or younger than you.  You're just an asshole if you reject her based on that. Please fuck off if that's the case.     Nee-sans a shit.     ...and I came     I like to believe that you are a sister to someone and have a complex about being older or younger than them. Not fitting your brothers preferred.    As someone who as an imouto, I choose imouto.    As someone who is an imouto I choose oneesan    Is onee-chan closer to onii-chan or imouto?    I kinda want that frog backpack     What is faster than a kiss      your imouto will never look at you like that     degenerate    Oh I'd love to start some blogshit right now.    Don't judge me.    Imouto.    this    NBR       I just don't care for onee-san's in general. My general preference is for a submissive girl, regardless of age, but for some reason, even if the onee san is submissive, I just can't get into it.     It's a crime against humanity that she isn't in one of our beds right now.    Do you like tsundere imoutos who are only secretly submissive to their baka anikis?    hold on anonkun, when VR hits full force we can all mean up in the m/a/nsion online arm in arm with our waifus.      Mine specifically    Oneesan, only imoutos I like are Mikan and the one from amagami ss    Oh my....     middle child and all i have are sisters  they treat me like shit      lwhy there's always an asshole that thinks /a/ is his blog?     This, only imoutos O like is Mikan but that's because she acts like an oneesan half the time  Nice blog asshole       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090180  on /a/ it is    Because the world is full of retards, and sometimes they get in /a/     It's always funny to see the newest people acting like they're some sort of gatekeeper      disgusting otaku     Blogging is allowed when it's about incest. And 3DPD is encouraged if it's about your sister.    Stop it anon, you shouldn't be sexualizing your daughteru!   It's always funny to see the new people act like they're not new    Liza a hot.    New mods and janitors seem to say otherwise, a pity really.    She's not my daughteru and I'll sexualize her all I want     Blogging is allowed when it's about incest.  It's not, that two assholes like it doesn't mean it's okay  And 3DPD is encouraged if it's about your sister.  Again, its not       I've been warned because of incest blogshit multiple times already. You know like, she wore my shirt after a shower or, she grabbed me from behind to show me some move and I've felt het boobs on my back.      new   implying it was ever okay in the first palace      Try telling me what to do fag.    Stop being so bitter that you don't have any sister. Or stop being a monster without heart that can't enjoy the purest form of love.     You're the one that seems new to me. Do you want every Imouto thread to just be some image dump of Imoutos? You have to have some OC otherwise it is just a fucking circlejerk with pictures.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090791   Incest   /b/   Please, incest is a pretty big thing in my chinese cartoon and weeb industry. Next time you will tell me that lolis are bad, right?       tfw I have an onee-san but she's a lesbian   Fucking /u/ ruining everything.    Incest is gross, otakus are gross, that's why they like it   Dick her straight.     Normalfags not welcome.     Why do you think it is gross?   Confirmed Mikan best imouto. And i thought nobody liked her, my dick is diamonds when i see her   He's probably american        I'm american and I want to fuck my sister.  I'm from the rural south though so I'm just a stereotype.     are you dumb? brothers are better in every way   Why are all imoutos silly in 3D?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090791  /b/ incest threads are for shitty captioned pictures of 3D and fake greentext stories.    Not all of them   I want to make love with pineapple-tan   do it faget    Nope, the only people that like Mikan are onee-san fags and that's because Mikan is just a loli nee-san. Nee-sans a shit.    What the fuck does that even mean    She acts like a nee-san, not an imouto ergo she is just a loli nee-san, and nee-sans a shit should be self explanatory.    You're fucking retarded, you know that?   Always  <br/>    complying you have a sister     And you think /a/ ones are true? Fucking idiot     neesans   shit  What an idiot      That's my waifu, you piece of shit!    OHB wouldnt lie to us. A good end like he had is the only thing that keeps this godforgotten world from being consumed by darkness.    oh, look sisters thread   blogshit, people fighting over blogshit and newfags that don't even know TLR     I know TLR I just have no interest in harem shit.    Of course not, but /a/'s fake incest stories tend to be more than just &gt;slutty sister &gt;be me &gt;had sex.     I know TLR  You clearly not if you had to ask if it was good     Still not a n excuse to blogshit     not having read the manga     Isn't the manga still harem shit just more lewd?    お姉ちゃん    Just go and read it or shit the fuck up       I haven't read the manga     you seem to be confusing "occasionally tolerated/flying under the radar" with "allowed"    I suppose that's a more appropriate analogy.      What's the artist name?     I like it when they're as close in age as possible, twins preferably, but really I don't care. I can't get enough.  Truly the purest form of love     reverse-search, faggot.    That's the problem, I do reverse search and I get nothing    not google    I liked that one for some reason even if I'm not a fan of femdom.     implying iqdb ever gives you someth-  Son of a bitch it worked     you need to learn which service is appropriate for which kind of content   Listen up motherfuckers.  Imoutos are the best. That is all.     If you were going to pick up a series just because of that, then TLR is literally the series for you. Happy fapping, anon.    S1 is really slow and honestly just bad. S2 gets better, and darkness gets even better. You can honestly speedwatch a few episodes of S1 to get the characters down, then jump straight to S2.    Manga is good, anime is shit    Is that a shop, the have the exact same eyes.     No one has translated this yet     Unless all imoutos are Mikan, you're wrong    Except they don't.    No its not a shop, the anime implies that she's Shirou's imouto, who died in the fire. Also that would explain why Illya always mistakes him for Shirou in the mornings       Put you and your sister's name into the penis/vagina affinity analyzer and show your sister the results.      That outfit is far too sexy    I don't know if Kyousuke would let her outside in that.    Strictly for at home with him.    Worst. Girl.      Is this a Cirno thread now?    got any sadpanda links to them?    Same. Reality has proven to me that older sisters are shit so that may stem my bias and makes me wish I had a real imouto.      https://archive.moe/a/thread/126750<wbr>974/#126802854 Not sure if betacuck or gay </wbr>        You failed as a little brother, you failed hard.     Sora alone makes all imoutos best.      Sora   good  Pick one       Seeing as how Sora = good I pick Sora, always.     Sora doesn't even make up for Kirino. The record shows imoutos are still shit.     Now you're just shitposting anon, though this is expected since you are a nee-san fag, which are below even negroes in terms of intelligence.     Don't assume I'm 'pick one' anon. Sora wasn't very appealing in the anime, and as a whole doesn't counter the number of shitty imoutos throughout animu and mango.    Nah you're shitpoting. Only a shitposter would say this trash.    Sora a shit.    Only shitposters pretend that imoutos aren't vastly inferior to nee-sans.     Neat.    The correct word is "superior" anon, not inferior.         Most onee-sanfags don't even see the difference between NBR and Blood related which is utterly disgraceful.   Oneechan forever.   NBR, not a nee-san.    Nee-sans don't show up a lot in animu or mango, I take what I can get.    They're not sisters anon, you are simply deluding yourself.    Then they're not a true big sister, anon. They're just an older caretaker type female.    You're in desperate need of standards, anon.     Its nowhere near the same if its NBR. Not even close.      Christmas cakes are great too.    I don't go outside much.   I can see why a blood relation for imoutos tends to be necessary but is it the same for nee-sans? NBR imoutos tend to be tsunderes while NBR nee-sans tend to be childhood friends or keiki. I don't think blood relation is quite as essential for nee-sans but I would entertain some differing opinions on this matter.            She's plainly average an pesonality is unappealing, but the main problem is really the Sorafags. They always hijack imouto threads to blow up how important they are, but in reality, they're so few they YnS threads either die out of suffer from constant samefagging.    Then they aren't fucking onee-sans if they're not blood related. They're just extermely close people.     Blood relation isn't important for nee-sans but it's important for imoutos  It's either one or the other fuckface, you can't have separate standards for both. Fucking hell this is why nee-san fags are scum.      I didn't realize that Sora wasn't allowed in imouto threads. To think, she's not an imouto even though she's constantly referred to as such.      blood relation is essential to the whole thing. I'm not sure you're actually have the same interests, maybe you just like older childhood friends, like you said.     Twin sister who walks the line. Her fierce loyalty is her best feature and if she works on her faults she would be perfect.     Her entire arc is about her working on her faults and overcoming the most egregious ones. Unfortunately the anime glossed over this.     So the biological relation is what makes the archtype? Here I thought character traits were far more important.    I DO have seperate standards for both what are you gonna do about it? And look at you taking the highground, you wouldn't resort to namecalling would you.   I'm honestly an ara ara kind of guy, thanks for not calling me a fuckface.          Character traits don't make someone a sister, it is blood.    NBR nee-sans are trash. You are giving all nee-san fags a bad name.    Nee-san fags already gave themselves a bad name since 90% of the nee-sans they post are NBR. This is why we should stop including them in our threads.    You realize that imouto and onee-san refer to sisters, right? Not just girls that are younger/older than you.     4,5,11   M-Muh duck!     I find 12 to be the hottest.    But character traits make the archtype.   I just venture into these threads because of the nee-san/christmas cake overlap. They represent traits I like.   They also refer to a set of character traits portrayed in most anime and manga.          But that's not what we're talking about here. Learn to context.        <br/>        I agree. It just looks so affectionate and lovely.   Either. ;_;   Kirino please go and don't bother the pthwr imoutos. Kyousuke is waiting for you in bed.     other  Fuck me, that came out wrong.       Fuck off, you contrarian faggot.   Wrong, you idiot. We talk about Sora because no one posts any other fucking imoutos until hours later and we're keeping an incest thread alive.        4chan must be why my sister doesn't want my dick   scapegoat yuri like a faggot when your life isn't even fucking anime and manga     becuz i sed so         I noticed the thread turned into shit right about two hours ago, the moment they start posting.     Yea it's my fault, not the people shitposting.      implying kirino doesn't shitpost while laying in Kyousuke's bed with her bare ass hanging out the bottom of his old shirt        God damn that is a lewd ass figure.     The root of the problem is probably the degree of how obnoxious the fanbase is in general. A lot of people are turned off the moment you enter, because we don't want to associate with you. We figured out how obnoxious you are to other characters in yns, and we see how obnoxious you are to other sisters, especially older sisters, so it's kind of natural to connect the dots.       am i cool yet?   No, you're a tryhard hipster faggot.        Oh sure, all shitposting is me and totally no one else.  I'm not going to pretend I am 100% innocent but you really don't have any actual proof that any of what you are saying was done by me.        obnoxious to other characters in YnS    obnoxious to other sisters, especially nee-sans   Not even a whiteknight. You're full of fucking shit.       You've either never been into an yns thread to see how much they shit on nao, or you're in denial, refusing to see how much they've shat up this thread.     blame the anon getting shitposted, not the shitposters      They can be secretly, but it has to come out at some point.     It's not easy to make out.  Even shitposts against could in reality be mere retaliation to how much you shitposted in the past and maybe even well deserved. I'm not one to judge that. All I know is there's history between the two factors.        While I will be the first one to say that Nao is 3rd best girl, you aren't exactly doing her any favors by whining about some people hating her.     People, not including me, hate Nao for raping Haru and having the most boring route.  As soon as that anon posted about Sora alone being an example of how good imoutos are contrarian faggots got obnoxious and you're not going to attack them instead? Bullshit.      Did you even read the idiot post I replied to?  Are you simply denying that post exist and that my post came up from thin air?     Onee-sama all day every day   best girl    Because karma What comes around goes around.  People react to you negatively because you've behaved negatively.        I completely agree with the guy you were responding to though, you are full of shit. For some reason you have a problem with me or one of the other 4 Sora posters (probably me since I post the most) and now you are trying to construe the silly contrarian shitposting that has been happening since day one on 4chan, long before I ever started posting Sora mind you, as some kind of "karma" because I...post Sora which in your mind is some kind of unforgivable crime.      how much you shitposted in the past   First of all, faggot, I'm not either of those handful of Sora loving anons. In every thread I've seen them in I have never seen them doing anything but either post a little carelessly or properly defend her while posting plenty of images and occasionally amusing comments.     <br/>   Well, once you are ready to accept reality, you can come back to my post that explains where you went wrong.  The first step involves you to start behaving and stop throwing shit against other characters.      I should have realized eventually people were going to start more commonly being contrarian faggots even about a harmless girl and imouto like Sora with a civil enough fanbase.  I hope /v/ isn't leaking.       stop throwing shit against other characters   How about stop pulling shit out your ass and post some archive links if you feel so sure?      Your fanbase isn't civil Anon. Back when you had yns thread, it was full of shit slinging even back then.     I officially think this guy is a master baiter  heh   fucking hell I'm 27 and that can make me giggle  and he has effectively strung us along.  I shall stop responding or just go "K" to him like I do everyone else that's baiting, I suggest you do the same but hell that's up to you maybe you find his delusions fun.       You are anonymous. You don't have to defend your personal reputation because you don't have one. By trying to do so you are only shitting up the thread even more.    not even 300 posts   Merely a diversion.      Yea I've already come to that conclusion in      be onii-san   imouto is over 10 years younger   never see her as anything but a little kid       defending themselves is shitting up the thread   not the faggots making baseless claims     is Sion the best type moon girl?   She's designed by the people who did the fighting game. Arcueid is the best type-moon girl.    Is this a horse?  I WANT TO KILL THIS FUCKING CUNT. SRSLY :(  I want to kill this fucking cunt.    tfw you don't know if your ship has sunk for good or is looking great, because translators have different takes on that spoon scene.  Also, one more day until the BTB threads days are numbered.  Shitposting OP, stop it.               No, that's a shit and worst girl. Yuckyno A SHIT.    why the fuck do you post this in every thread?    Fuck you man     So, Yui is the hero the Service Club deserves.    Brothers?   Spyro finally started, yay!     1/3   All this proves is that Yui is a selfish cunt.    2/3     All this proves is that you are a complete idiot.     Now that's alpha.    Fuck of falseflagger    Yukino loves 8man   Yui loves 8man   Yui and Yukino are best friends   8man is romantically stunted  This sounds like a huge plot point going forward. This will impact their relationship a lot.       3/3     you will never have your own coma cheese       Try to hog too many things at once and they all fall off from your grasp.     Yui   character who's chronically unable to assert her own wants over those of the group   finally decides to stand up for herself   selfish cunt   We've been through this dance already with Yukino between the election and genuine speech, so how about you get          She is the hero they need.    Komachi is scary, too scary. Yui and Yukino look more concerned than taken aback.       Yeah, that fish is big   - If there would be no refuge, it wouldn't find its own place... Always hiding, going with the flow, sticking with something... And hitting an invisible wall   - Which fish?   - It's about myself   I like this bit a lot. Seems like Yukino is finally coming to terms with what she wants to do; she was a lost fish but now that she has Hachiman and Yui, it seems like she finally found a home of some sort and will stop going with the flow   Makes me think Yukino is going away for a period of time; if so, then it means that she is not going to follow anybody's footsteps.             MAX 300 coffee  I would drink the shit out of that DDR used to be my fucking game.       Yukino is going away for a period of time   Literally White album 2 Watari is a hack      No Iroha allowed below this line   -----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------</wbr>      So will Yui get cucked?    That's not nice.   Good Irohasu, everyone!  How do I stop this underclassman from being so sly?     kinda surprising she admitted it. I figured that was going to be a big source of conflict later on.       Responsibility  [ ] Take [ ] Leave      Not if Watari doesn't want his best friend to sue him for plagiarism.    Do you want a boring thread? Because that's how you get one.   Now that we know that Yukino/Yui are going to go for the 8 how would they respond to another girl going for him?     cockblock.   We dont care about losing/winning.  She has enough points. She will just NTR 8man, when he meet his kouhai again, after the time skip     You're not alone brother.    I wouldn't do anything that I'd have to take responsibility for. Not when I've got to hurry home to my gorgeous bun-headed ray of sunshine and cook dinner for her.    Best girl is best    What kind of life do you live that leads you to fantasize about living a normal life?   All girls other than Komachi are complete shit.   This is a well known fact within both the scientific and literary communities.   You cannot debate me on this. It is indisputable.       He's just come home after banged his kouhai    Irohabro shop owner says no.   Irohasu~   Thanks, brethren.    80% of pixiv is Yui     Is she softer than Yukino?  I want to use cocytus on Iroha   Spoilers for borderline blogshit  One where I wasted most of a decade of my life dicking around, so now what's most appealing to me is peace, stability, and the love of a kind and beautiful wife.     Fuck Iroha, Yukinon 4 life.  Why are Hiratsuka and Sensei the only ones that look like actual brides.   Probably more bouncy. Soft is hard to say.   Yui deserves to win and should, iroha is pretty fun, saki is great, Yumiko a best and yukino is a bitch. Have a nice thread guys   use that on your Onisama. Dont touch our goddess or she will NTR you     get home and cook dinner for her.   anon what is wrong with you, is it happy marrying a  vase ?       Hiratsuka and Sensei   You need to sleep, m8.     Alpha &amp; Beta    Made for titty-fucking     Iroha is the second biggest 8+Y shipper after Komachi though, no way she'd ruin all her hard work baiting one of them into finally taking the 8bowl.   Who would be a great trophy wife?   I wish she had heels on during the series instead of boots. Heels look a lot better on her anyways.     two right feet  Jesus Christ.     Give us your definition of "trophy wife" first.    Haruno. She certainly wouldn't be a good wife in any other respect.     yumiko has 2 left feet  Why, just why.    Irohasu!  8man should 8 both the girls against their will and see which one he likes better.   that's why Hayama won't fuck her    I'm gonna miss you captain. IROHA OR DEATH    What sort of position is 8?     I never noticed that, wow. Artist fuck up I guess      You have eccentric taste.      can't fucking unsee  Th-thanks anons.          I want the Irohafags to leave, you got your romantic moment translated already so please leave us alone to discuss the drama.   They wear a strap-on and fuck him in the ass.    In Japan? Yumiko. She's blonde. And very, very cute.    Sticking his 8 in them, typically via behing or missionary.    Eccentric how?    I fucking love cooking, Alton Brown is one of my idols. Yui's meme-flaw is a flat out win for me, since I don't mind the extra work and I'd get to play teacher in her efforts to not be a failure in the kitchen.    I'm trying to imagine a blonde Japanese woman being sexier than simple black hair. I just can't see it.  The only reason Yumiko looks cute with blonde hair is because she looks white.     At this point I'm okay with anyone but the spoiled rich brat bitch winning.   And the kind of girl who will be nothing outside of highschool. Her days are numbered, soon she'll just be some random pretty girl.     what the hell does a vase have to do with marrying Yui?     You underestimate how far in life being pretty will get you   間接キス!     I can't help it, she's on my mind.    Go watch Japanes Propaganda : The anime You'd like it.  Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken       At least you've clearly got your priorities straight.     I don't know actually; it's more of a vague feeling.  Yui &gt; Orimoto &gt; Miura &gt; * &gt; Yukino = Iroha = Haruno here.      Yui wont suffer r-right?   Nice quads, male sibling.   1/8  EITHER GIRL EXCEPT IROHA OR DEATH  Who do you think schlicks to 8man? Yui and sensei only?   Not remotely, memeposter sir.    I just fantasized about sitting in a room reading a book while Yukino does the same thing.   This makes no sense. There's literally no interaction, why is it so appealing?      2/8    saki    If you switched orimoto and iroha id be a pretty big fan of your taste, other than yumiko not being best    IROHA    3/8     quiet   peaceful   no awkward silence (at least if you're 8man)   reading is awesome   she probably smells nice        Where are the fake spoilers?   remember cake belongs in the top of the food group.    4/8    That's my nigga       don't need this heartboner right now man.      SAY YES      tfw when you'll never get to teach Yui MD and TD     At least we have a genuine understanding.         Heh, I didn't realise it. Great.  Thanks for telling me. Have a Saki.      There are couples who read books together you know. Whatever works best.    good    5/8    AH FUCK HIS PHONE WILL BE CONFISCATED  CONTRABAND  WEEKEND PASSES REVOKED         meme-flaw     6/8     Self-insert doujin  That's why Yuifag not GENUINE     7/8     Anon's right though.   KONICHIWA I'M BUSTY OPPAI-CHAN ALL FRIENDLY AND SWEET, B-BUT I CAN'T COOK!  It's a common form in Bengali cartoons.        Wait, how is Valentine's Day not over? Isn't every volume supposed to be a month apart?  The thought of Iroha somehow getting 8man alone and giving him some kind of Valentine gift is pretty exciting.      8/8    You've read my mind.     8man carrying iroha's bags even in yui's doujins   it's over my negroes      That's just an assumption, we don't know when the volume ended. V-day is probably over, though.     Goddamn meme trash. Typical of Vietnamese mobile paintings.    as expected of non-yuifags not understanding genuine.    Here, fixed for you  Iroha= Haruno &gt;Orimoto&gt;Yui&gt;Miura&gt;Yukino      More translated fanart here!    http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B       WHO IN THE FUCK KEEPS THEIR HAIR IN A BUN WHILE WASHING IT    Retarded people, that's who.

Why the does it always seem like only Yui shit gets TL'd?         Jesus, I don't know where to begin with you.     switch Miura and Yui and I'll take it     only Yui shit gets TL'd  Yui shit as in only her bad doujins or as in only Yui's doujins?      because she's the best girl    What's going to happen in the next episode?

If the boat has to sink, I'll be guiding it to the depths of sea myself.     openly flirting with 8man over an indirect kiss   sinking  You what.      Why is Yui such a slut? Look at that cock hungry expression.    I reiterate my previous statement.    Except it's mostly Iroha that gets the translations and typesets done.

Close      This is Nepgear.    being best of shit   OK.      Correct. Would you like a cookie?    Do you have a best girl instead? I'd rather have something more meaningful than a cookie.    Who then, is best girl, anon? There are many girls that are not bad, but only one can be best.     Vert       Apron Noire is fine too      Iris is best.

And her thighs.     whatsherface is joining Blancs game.    There were no pantyshots in the anime, right. I was hoping for some of Ge-Ge's pink-white shimapan.    and 1/2 Under+1/2 Sideboob-chan is joining Nep VII, wish the game would come to steam already.    We will never see the new goddess in an official manga.  Wouldn't now be a good time to fire up an anime sequel, though?      Which Nep has the best one?   She is a pure girl, she doesn't wear such things.    Nope, the only thing close to it was the beach episode when she got fooled of not wearing any swimsuit.   Shh... Ram and Rom are sleeping  Who Purubutt here?   MAGES has the sluttiest navel.    But she has no friends?     god eater   no freedom wars neps      i fucking with we got another season, but im not sure there enough material seeing as how they slapped 3 games in 12 episodes.     I'd do some raunchy, demeaning shit to Noire  and I wouldn't call her the next day.    That's not very nice.     That a prefect butt for spank     It's part of my plan. By the third day, she'll come crawling back for more. After that, she's mine.    I'd rather just lick her. Much more satisfying for both parties.   I want to confess to Blanc.   I'm going to lick her for a whole night to seal the deal. Either that or just rub her for a few hours.

Too over powered. The girls would need some plot armor since she would be a major threat to all the goddess.     [soiler] That girl is such a bitch, fuck Noire [/spoiler]        3DS port when? Vert imoutos when? X-BOX handheld when?     I bet she has smooth thighs. I want to bury my face in them.   Nepgear is the  purest      You can have your purity. I want a lustful NepNep.    Please don't sexualize the Neps    they sexualize themselves.    If I don't sexualize her in some way, how are we supposed to have kids?        As with PC-Tan, how can you really have one single face to represent all of PCdom? Moreover, Gameindustri is isolated like how Japan is to the whole world around it. God forbid Nepnep go abroad instead of being just a mere slider.  A CPU that may represent PCs would be at a level beyond the existing Neps, and dominate over a whole empire outside of gameindustri. She'd be like some conceptual god with several platform that operate on the hardware along with a huge number of makers. She'd be like the Roman empire who is fighting all the barbaric consoles and the heathen mobile platforms.  Gameindustri would just be this one front out of the whole console war, and that's not factoring in all the alt dimensions outside of hyperdimension at that.           If you treat console in the sense of platform, then Steam-chan would be there, along with Origin, Uplay, GOG and studio-specific platforms such as Battle.net. PC is Balkanized and it's about as Roman as the (un)holy Roman empire.   Come to think of it, platform cohesion of iOS and Android far exceeds the segmented PC through more draconian default web store enforcement (at least those two can somewhat trace to UNIX and are distant relative of the inconsequential non-gaming platform o' Linux)       And when Linux-tan gets drunk she tries to play games, but sometimes weird shit happens to her somehow.   Being Vert is suffering   Kinect is not a younger sister. It's just accessory.  Although Vert would have a rather distant cousin in Surface line tablets that aren't marketed as gaming consoles.    New Chapter soon  Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87      god tier design   god tier stand design   good backstory and was literally the start of the SBR   outran fucking horses on foot   had a ton of mystery and intrigue about him   ended up being a stand of the week pawn of Diego's with just a downgraded Echos act 2   What the fuck Araki, this had so much potential.           still mad, i thought he was going to win   Quick! Make up a stand that can beat King Crimson!   Diizu Naatsu     hint that Norisuke is the stand user   hey the Japanese guy uses the Japanese sound effects, that's really clever   NO IT'S THE FUCKING NATIVE AMERICAN   Easily the worst part of part 7.       Hey guys you ready for the new episode on frida- oh....  Well at least we got that part 4 teas- oh....     the world    My soul will not rest until something gives me hope for a Part 4 adaptation.    We can still be hyped for the new chapter and the new EoH demo    There's no PC version, who cares.   Is he called "Gappy" because of the gap in his teeth?    PC version     People who own a console :^)    Yes     soon   implying we'll even get it this month      No, he's called Gappy because he once tripped in the gap between a train and the station platform.    I hope Josuke's seiyuu writes the feem toon and sings the feem toon for part 4, I only watched Hamatora because he sang the ED.     downgraded Echos act 2  IASW was far superior to act. It could make multiple sounds at the same time and the things it made were alive even without diego meddling. Really I don't know what you guys expected him to do if he didn't get involved there he would just be off screen the entire like poco.    I have a question.  In stardust crusaders when polnareff confronts dio and he keeps getting reset back to the start of the stairs, am I really supposed to believe that dio is stopping time, walking over to polnareff, picking him up, carrying him a few steps and then placing him back down gently?       anime is over    we are finally discussing Jojolion   Wow I thought the anime posters would never leave         Just because they don't have scans immediately doesn't mean they won't get it at all   Fridays will finally be 500x less autistic       Yes, that's exactly what's happening.     New Chapter soon  HOW FUCKING SOON I want to see the AU Shit Hair so much.           Fridays will finally be 500x less autistic    no more speedwagon posting   no more hype train posting        I've already read the chapter so it's not that I'm being that impatient, it's just that it has happened before.   Where can i read Jorge Joestar?  Pocoloco's design is so good, he's barely affected by Araki's changing art style.   He's sexy.    Reading the older chapters I really hate how ugly the new crosshatching look. It looks really lazy and sketchy in comparison.    Speaking of Araki's changing artstyle, what part is everyone's favourite style?    Not finished translated yet and the translator is not releasing it bit by bit. It'll be all in 1 go.    Might have been a new/shitty assistant for a while. The crosshatching in Part 7 looked perfect.    I like how late part 1 to part 3 looks but I don't really have a favorite.   Superior jojos thread  never?   ever     It's just UJ printing quality messing up the more delicate shading. All the other parts have tank scans.     Late Part 3 to mid Part 4, along with most of part 2, looks great in that classic style that JoJo has.  Mid Part 7 is probably my favourite look. Really evocative and memorable. Part 8 is drifting away from that a bit too much.      post jojo characters irl   The 10th volume of Jojolion that comes out next month could have a flyer about it    who's this girl?      I honestly think a chapter or two with just sandman and pocoloco would have made SBR the best part uncontested, hell they could have fought sloop john b, who got second place in the race but no design for the character     I want to see the AU Shit Hair so much.  it's been on the chinese blogs for a week now     Part 2. I like my burly fabulous men more than scrawny fabulous boys.      I feel you, anon    kek oh my    RiffRaff's Codeine Conquest    Mid-7. Current 8 is great too, Karera is one of the most consistently good-looking Araki girls ever.  Part 4 had a nice sweet spot somewhere in the middle, but it was on the brief side and I wasn't a big fan of the early or late styles.     IT'S HERE  Just finished part 4 Why is the pose famous if he never does it?    True suffering    did you miss this page    Mid part 4, the time where Araki started going easy on the muscles and body size, and haven't went crazy with lips and noses.    link pls    The guy who works on the scanlations tweeted out that they don't have the raws yet so i'm not suspecting the chapter until at least Friday, assuming they get the scans today or tomorrow.   Nice try      Oh hey, I remember the page but not that panel, can't believe I missed that.  Suppose I expected it to make a bigger impact on me, and be a big panel or something, that's no excuse though     I'm almost here, but not yet.   Stand User: Riff Raff Stand name: Aquaberry Dolphin  Ability: User can generate money up to 20k a day, however they must spend whatever money they generate that day       The shittness ratio of Jo3ke's hair has been greatly reduced.  Why isn't half of Jo2ke's eyes bright like this Jo3ke?       you will never tag team a racially ambiguous priest witha bunch of your bros     Dude. His sides are shaved clean.    Yes, please.     Obligatory.       Just saw Gaucho die in that woods SBR   wanna start reading JoJolion so I can be caught up with these threads   How far am I        Your not so subtle /r/equest won't ever work.    hes sicilian. how is that so hard to understand. Sicilian Italians are dark as fuck.    Near the True Man's World.    he looks like michael jackson in this pic     Jo3ke  Let's not do that. His name is Josefumi.   That color must've gone to the other body. The corpse's eyes were bright too.        That feeling when you look at Magic Boy BT and then the latest JoJoLion chapter, you'd think that the two were made by completely different artists.  Some years ago people were posting gifs explain Stands and other abilities from JoJo, many were edits from this gif.  Any idea of were I can find them?     is this what Joshuu would look like with a pomp?     NO. THE WORLD HAS A BODY. IT CAN MOVE THINGS YOU AUTISTS.       downgraded Echoes Act 2   No he wasn't. Echoes could modify the properties of objects by drawing sound effects on them, but he couldn't create effects in mid air that he could use for whatever purpose he wanted.       Nah man, He's Josefumi Kujo the other half of Gappy     someone on the internet made a joke and i don't like it!     speaking of Jobin, did he really not know who Jo2uke was?    Joshuu might not even be able to make a pompadour since all his hair seems to come from the top of his head.    Even Dio is shocked.    He knew Kira and the Rockman Duo    I like the Dio theory better,  Dio picking up Polnareff gently and speaking to his frozen body join me again while placing him down gently and running back to his spot and starting time again and rinse and repeat.     How do I become hard on hoes like Josuke?   No, he's really confused once he figures out he was tricked and now he suspects his own dad of being up to something.    He knew Kira  Did he? I don't remember that ever coming up.        He will never be a bro jo will he?    Get adopted by a rich family    Find one girl you truly love that loves you back and disregard all others    I know it's Josefumi but I like Jo3ke, it's cute.    Such a cool looking stand shouldn't have the ability of another one. Diego The world gets a pass     Why didn't he just say 'oh Karera, My memory got fucked up by a stand during the earthquake.' She would've been on his dick like white on rice, spilling info all over the place.  That's all he had to say.     My mistake he knew about Kira.  Cuz his papa knows about him too.      I don't know, the Internet?   I like french fries I like french fries I like french fries  But not fried chicken       Man, Double J is one hard motherfucker.   i wonder if will we be calling Gappy, Josefumi after the new chapter?     Karera says she's all about living in the moment and doesn't care about the past. I wonder how she'll react when she finds out Secchan isn't Secchan after all.    I am pretty sure Josefumi was nick named Jojo and Josuke is another way of saying Jojo. So he'd go by Strictly Jojo to avoid confusion     If he knew Kira then he would've known why Josuke tricked him as he looks just like Kira. Jobin had no idea who Josuke was at all and didn't even think it was about the fruit shit.  Now unless Jobin is retarded I can only assume he was secretly teamed up with the rockmen for a cure and Norisuke secretly teamed up with Kira and his con artist friends for a cure but they didn't inform each other of that.  Josefumi was likely going to try to steal the healing aspect of the fruit the rockmen had so their secret plans ended up intertwined without them knowing.       She'll be like noooo!!!!! My nightmare came true Secchan and Kira did fuse!!!!    When did we see the other corpse? In the first chapter? I don't seem to remember.    The guy himself is still Josuke. Araki is being rather blatant with his themes so he's definitely his own new person and not just either of his halves.   Some /a/non posted a cleaned up version of this, anyone happen to have it?   this is the same man that previously was walking down a corridor while stopping time every few steps to light some candles on either side, all for effect. You're goddamn right he's carrying him down those stairs.    They found it near the wall eyes after the Fun Fun Fun fight. It was identified as Kira, but it was actually a second fusion made of the parts of him and Josefumi that aren't in Josuke.    His stand is picking him up.    True because they don't know that their maid is Kira's sister    Shit Hair 2.0   For some reason I'm glad to see Kira still loves beating the shit out of schoolboys, even in death.  Could DIO smash this pumpkin?    tfw no Dead Man's Answers     Hwas crying cause he saw the beating his girl took and he wasn't around to defend her    He didn't acknowledge her injuries or ask her about the shit she had gone through. shit bf     Got more of these?     Gappy  Christ, I wish this fucking nickname would die already. His name is "Johsuke" as written in English on the tank covers.      NO WAY,ARE YOU SURE?    johsuekeh is my favorite johjoh   r/ the image of joseph smiling next to the "one life partner"  any one got a link to the script   Explain further.    I bet you call Jotaro's mom "Holly".    Mid Part 3 to early Part 5. But I do like the Current Style(Mid SBR to Present).   Will Josuke have the most amount of pussy of any JoJo by the end of this part?   In the manga they said that Joestars only have one partner. Joseph is smiling because loljosuke     Part 4 had Josuke, Jotaro and Joseph in it   Part 8 has Josuke, Josuke (Norisuke) and Josefumi  All them Jojos in Morioh, man.     Kars   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090749  What?      plus those half jojos, Jobin and Joshuu   When did this, become more beautiful than THIS?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090749  Sexualized cartoon depictions of little boys. But I don't see what this has to do with anything    The art started gitting gud at mid part 4.    Thanks    the early and mid part 7 pictures show a really ugly johnny    Don't let the other anons lie to you. The stairs were actually made of some kind of solid cold fire and Dio was using his firebreathing powers to make new Stairs and confuse Polnareff    Maybe a couple.    He only wants one and I don't imagine any of them other than maybe Karera would be alright with sharing.    the giant bara deer look did give funnier poses and was generally more homoerotic but really it was sort of silly. I unno which I prefer more the CUHRAZY poses or the more realistic anatomy.    You sure about that?    Technically always since part 7 onwards Araki based his designs and anatomy directly off of Greek/roman artwork.   What will I do on friday nights now that JoJo Part 4 has been confirmed for never coming out?   Are they friends now? Didn't Tsurugi try to kill him and kidnapped/molested his gf in a dungeon?     part 3 wasn't that good in anime form  part 4 would probably be better as an anime but who knows      rewatch the part 4 commericials and cry    tsurugi was being manipulated       now that JoJo Part 4 has been confirmed for never coming out?   Are you retarded      He's only nine so of course Josuke would be a bit friendlier towards him to make up for telling him to turn on his dad. There's no point in staying angry when both have a common goal and their own issues to work though.    JOnathan   JOseph   JOtaro   JOsuke   Giorno   This triggers my autism.         I don't think 9 year olds are able to molest people.    but kuJO and Higashikata don't?   so will part 4 anime be 4 cour?    Kujo,Jotaro  Jotaro is easily the joeist jojo     If it happens it'll probably be 2 1/2 or 3.    The two Josukes are so Jojo they don't even need surnames to be Jojos.    Probably three. It's one of the longest parts too. I really hope David Pro confirms they're doing it soon.    That's because part 5 is fanfiction and shouls be treated as noncanon and skipped.     JOnothan JOestar   JOseph JOestar   KuJO JOtaro   JOJOsuke Higashikata   GIOrno GIOvanna (pronounced J-orno)   KuJO JOlyne   JOhnny JOestar   JOJOsuke Higashikata   KuJO JOsefumi   You're acting like an Americlap              It should be four because it is only slightly longer than part 3. I hope it's shorter though, as I disliked the pacing of part 3.    July 10th.I guarantee it.    I can definitely see Part 4 being slimmed down similarly to Part 1.    Thanks Men's Warehouse.     now that JoJo Part 4 has been confirmed for never coming out?  Source: My ass.      slimming down slice of life  might as well skip it.      JOJOsuke  wot  I mean, I know the "-suke" can be read a "-jo", but your method of explanation misses that.        GEOrge JOestar   GEOrge JOestar II   Holly JOestar-KuJO        JOJOsuke Higashikata  You are probably actually really literally retarded.     Part 1 and 2 had relatively little cut out though. I can't imagine they'd start condenscing now with the fourth part. Especially after they're rolling in cash from SDC.   So is Gappy a new entity born of Josefumi and Kira or is he just Josefumi with Kira's bits stuck in him and memory loss?   Not a lot, but some swaths could be tidy single episodes in themselves.     rolling in cash  SDC anime was a huge flop in nippon    Guys, How to draw a JOJO face.   Insane cheekbones.    ctrl+c, ctrl+v    Big fucking nigger lips    Yeah, and you're a mouthbreather. The "suke" in Josuke can be also read as Jo.     Most people call him "Jorge Joestar"     It always bothers me how bloodshot his eyes seem to be in this.     not that guy but here's a better way to show it  仗(JO)助(suke, can also be read as JO) Higashikata   定(JO)助(suke, can also be read as JO) Higashikata  Does norisuke IV's birthname use the same kanji as part 4 josuke?        We don't know, dipshit. New chapter isn't even translated    The strain of someone looking at his internet history is too great that his eyes are shot.    It's George II everywhere but that book.    Relax buttmunch, it was just a question. And plenty of people on here read moon as it is.    We've known it for a long time, he's a new person. Kyo said it too, their minds have been fused. That's why the stand is a combination of both.   Reading Part 5 now.   Is there any villain who doesn't keep pulling stuff out of their ass to pad out their fight?   Ghiaccio can go die in a fire       Kyo conjectured it, but since Gappy is so keen on finding out who he is, I'm assuming he thinks he's this other person.    It wasn't though.     We're all aware of that, but saying JOJOsuke is fucking stupid.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127092505   I knew before I even read.   And I'm fine with that. Mista's all I need anyway.      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq<wbr>J3iGBdOo</wbr>  [ ] Might as well have been Jojos part 9     Yeah, he still wants to believe he has a past that goes back further than when he first saw Yasuho, but that really is where his life began. It's surprising how many people don't realize this, it's not like Araki is being subtle at all about it.    Honestly, I'd rather that be what it was since that means Gappy is his own character, not someone like Weather Report, who changed completely after he regained his memories.   jojo scanlators are slow   I agree. I didn't mean that as a bad thing at all.    It made sense, with weather report, he had his memories stolen, and maliciously at that, he should be pissed.     Pucci takes sex pistols from Mista and later causes his death,     Yeah but Weather Report became almost completely uncaring of his allies post memory retrieval.    Speaking of Pucci, has anyone ever seen what happens in All-Star Battle when he uses his Whitesnake powers on a non-Stand User, like Jonathan or Kars?    Probably nothing different happens.    If you're the same anon from before, I'm surprised you didn't toss in a  Mista dies  joke somewhere in there.    Yeah, nothing different happens. Another lost opportunity for CC2.     Does norisuke IV's birthname use the same kanji as part 4 josuke?  No, it uses the same one as Jobin and Joshuu.     If they announce it on July 10th iI will fucking cum so hard bcuz it's my birthday   What was the text in the speech bubble? Preferably the english text.   I, DIO, will now buttfuck you     I don't think 9 year olds are able to molest people.  He groped Yasuho's tits and licked her ear     Dis is muh wurl, jutarou    It was something like "Time to die, Polnareff"   Who's the most handsome Jojo?  And why it's Johnny?     That's not KuJO JOsefumi.   Fucking fagget won't scanlate this shit fuck    Not choosing foxy grandpa     no it wasn't.    Then you will die here, Polnareff!    If it happens it'll be 48 episodes as well. Part 4 is like 20 chapters longer than Part 3, and remember Part 3 needed filler to fill 48 episodes.   How much longer is Jojolion going to go? I want to be able to marathon the entire thing but at the same time don't want to keep waiting.   Some 4 or 5 years.        this is most pleasing   Weird how Jojolion is quite mediocre if you follow it monthly. I'm following it since it came out and felt pretty underwhelmed about it overall, but I recently re-read everything back from the beginning and it's been quite a hide actually.   mysteries are like that     that jaw  more like funny valentine kek     http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=trBx<wbr>PFLq__g</wbr>  [ ]    the average sized jojo parts (parts 3-6) ranged from 16-18 voumes and lasted over 3 years each. Steel ball run was 24 volumes (volume lengths being a more accurate point of reference when comparing SBR to other parts because while chapter length increased greatly when the ultra jump move occurred volume page count didn't) and lasted slight over 7 years.  Jojolion has been around for 4 years and will have it's 10th volume out soon: The latest we're in in the story is likely in the middle       Josuke is another way of saying Jojo  Not this time, the kanji is different.    you OK reatard? I am wood  stupid     We duwang now      I wish everything had a duwang translation   We differentiate Jonathan and Johnny, right? We don't say things like "Jonathan comes back in Part 7". So why are we trying to look for an old character in Josuke?  Can someone explain what happened during Johnny get shot while Gyro vs D.i.s.c.o? Why the witness saw three different shooter?   Don't forget  GEorge Joestar  and  Jotaro KUJO   No one is perfectly related even in real life so shut the fuck up.         Part 7   Can someone put up the Chris Evans pose photo please, its my favorite pic   Only Josefumi uses the 仗    How does that make sense if Part 3 was 5 cour? Part 4 is the longest pre-SBR part.    Remember that in Japan, the last name is said first. So Jotaro would be called KuJO JOtaro    Don't forget  JOshua bar JOseph (Jesus)      Really far, but enjoy the ride SBR is. It's amazing.     THIS   We should, not, NEED a team of people to properly dub part 4 in Duwang when its announced. Anyone fluent in Jap and or got time on their hands willing?       sup bro     you ok retard?    Josuke. And Josefumi since he's practically identical.    I thought the blood was from Yotsuyu until I saw blood on Gappy's knuckles.    Joseph obviously   Josuke would be pretty handsome if he didn't have a piece of cow shit stuck on his head.       What a weak stand. All the JoJos are turning in their grave   wow so kira and kira died fighitng each other...i guess that is a spin on part 4  Which characters are most likely to have tried fucking their stands?   Anyone????????????????      Yeah nobody knows what happened during that arc. That's a bigger mystery than the second coffin in my book.     So: Part 4 josuke and josefume: 仗 Part 8 josuke:定 the part 8 higashikatas (joshu, jobin, norisuke iv's birth name [josuke], and presumably the birth names of norisuke ii and iii): 常          dub  You mean sub, right? Duwang subs would make more sense     yes, typo my bad. But we need a team fucking dedicated to that shit. I would literally pay if the BD had duwang subs.      three separate johnnies in separate locations    If I knew how to do that sort of thing, I would.   Explain Jojo and all its related concepts in one sentence to someone who has never read a manga before   It's the generational story of the Joestar family as they fight bizarre enemies.    I think it would better fit if it was  "It's the generational story of the Joestar family as they fight bizarre enemies using a variety of bizzare powers."       dat yo     Weird motherfuckers fighting weirder motherfuckers    Read the title of the manga    Bizarre people with ghosts fight other bizarre people with ghosts  Also everyone is fabulous     Why didn't diego turn funny into a dinosaur? Couldn't he do it with just a scratch when scary monsters first appeared?   guardian angels formed by psychic power called stands which each have unique supernatural cababilities are used by characters in a multi part story each with their own MC's related to a joestar bloodline fight evildoers fabulously    It truly is a bizarre adventure.    Yeah, this anon gets it.    Are there fan arts of Kadera or yet?    have 4 balls or two pairs     Really nobody? I thought /a/ has the most hardcore jojo fans here.    He is one of the most ugliest characters Araki ever made, but I still like this guy.

I'm gonna be honest with you anon, almost ever character in JoJo can beat that fat bastard. Why? Because he isn't the smartest member of the gi niu patrol. Even the big rip off dumbass asshole who almost killed Vegeta was smarter than him.    He is like kid Anassui.    Tsurugi gonna start murdering people too?   So is number 3 done yet?   Only if he sees his girlfriend cheating on him.   So when will the final BD for Part 3 come out?   I kind of like these descriptions.    can I do three?       Sure.     3 is not done yet but some anon said he'd do it, but that was about a week ago.    Acho was such a great character. And double wu was such a great stand.   I got a message saying /a/ wanted to do an /a/ sings for the Jojo finale. Is that still on?  when jojo's colored adventures gets to this I hope keep the mudas going out of the text boxes   God Kira was so fucking cool    Is this it anon?   Part 3 was weak in general but the crew was pretty enjoyable I guess.  I doubt David will drop the rest of the parts. If anything, animating Part 7 and 8 in the future will be up for debate    Why do people talk about Jorge Joestar so much? What makes it so special in the Jojo-verse?    36 Kars on mars.     Dude, I can't maintain a meaningful relationship because that's how I am.  You don't want any part of that shit.      There's a part where a Kira uses the spin to power a rope to blow Lisa Lisa in half, and then he dances with her upper body.    I can't tell which parts are true and which parts are made up by /a/nons while they're drunk, on weed and LSD, and sleep-deprived at the same time.       Fuck please respond.  I know its long but its some crappy edit that links the ending of episode 47 and the beggining of episode 48 with Roundabout playing as the ED.         It's Flashpoint wacky JoJo edition.    It's all true.    I do not speak nip, so I wouldn't know. It COULD be all true for all I care.       you're out with a qt who loves you when you see this  what do     He already has with NotWhammu.    The illustrations from the book are online. Here's PB Dio with his stand, The Passion.    notice that there's a weird "hand" like quality to the way araki draws feet     still thinking irene and steel ball run are in the same universe     We all know he can't draw feet.     We still don't even know what the plot is.    OH MY GOD, JAHHHHHH! is my favorite Anthology song.  What's yours?     KillerQueen already can.    well, I'm ashamed     Since the anime is over, how would you rate the adaptation of David?  I give it a 8/10, it was good, some parts looked like ass, and as an adaptation, they didn't have to be 100% loyal to the manga, but it was nice to see the manga animated.    Chapter 44 when?   this is what I came up with     Looks good, keep going.     umm ok    I'm confident they'll animate the first six, but like you said anything after that is a guess. DiU and SO are long, but doable. Steel Ball Run is a different beast altogether due to it's length and arc structure. As long as the do the rest of the per-reset parts, I'm happy. I really want to see Morioh fully animated    Those aren't the illustrations. The in-book illustrations are done by Araki. The ones on the website are just sketches related to the book that the author himself did. Could be the entire plot, could just be random shit.    Araki only drew the cover, nothing inside.    All the books in the VS JoJo series had interior illustrations by Araki though.    Except for Jorge Joestar.    This made me really sad, Anon. Sad that they didn't use Roundabout and sad that the journey is over.   if they actually make more parts in the anime 4,5 etc. will they use the VAs from All star game? I really like Namikawa voices Giorno   Really? Because guys here really hate how he does his Stand cries.    Not that anon but I thought he nailed it    I hope not. Josuke's VA doesn't suit him at all.    The main JoJos, probably. But from what I could tell with ASB, CC2 didn't consult with David Pro about casting judging by the voice changes in Part 3. Though from what I can tell, the anime cast now do the characters in the next game.  If they keep Josuke, Okuyasu, Kira, Rohan, and maybe Koichi, I'm happy. Really the first three are the most important. Oku and Kira are perfectly cast.      You bastard   ;_; why couldn't it have ended like this.  no sono chi no sadame   no get back          Who else could they cast as Koichi?    I just love Romi Park so they better keep her.    keep coloring, anon-kun?    I think he needs more intensity in his mudas but otherwise he was perfect much better than romi was.   no raw yet?  Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane That I want to lose in you, Baby can you stand the pain Hey, lover, sugar don't you see? There's so many things that you do to me Oh baby! (hey, lover) All I want to see is the love in your eyes And all I want to hear is your sweet love sighs (hey, lover) All I want to feel is burning flames Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same Tell me that you feel the same way I do Tell me that you love me girl We'd be so lost, in our mouths, the best, I feel it everyday (every way) You feel so wrong, be alone, if you just follow somebody someday Soft and wet Soft and wet                  That's the real reason why she was introduced at all.   Why isn't he dressed up as a girl, /a/?  Part 4 &gt; Part 2 &gt; Part 7 &gt; Part 6 &gt; Part 5 &gt; Part 1 &gt; Part 3  Agree or agree?     aren't feet just weird hands, anon?     Get rid of that grey. All of it.     ok    It's gender-neutral clothing. The weather is cold and crossdressing doesn't work anyway.     part 5 better than part 3  Absolutely disgusting.      I guess i wont be a cunt. One of D4C's lesser used powers is space blending. D4C has the ability to made two different locations in space exist at the same time in the same place. He used it to place both wekapipo and diego in the same location relatively to shoot tusk. At that moment both Diego and Wekapipo existed in the same place at the same time, totally unaware of each other. Outside onlookers would see only one or the other depending on their perspective.  He used this power again when he attains Love Train. That is how he 'projected' himself in that flying space window and pursued johnny from the train.         Space manipulation powers are way more complicated than time manipulation powers.    i fucking love his voice as giorno he sounds like a teenager and it's so good     I couldn't do anything about Jobin, but I colored as much as I could   So i just finished part 2 of the anime an im on to part 3, and one of the things im definitely going to miss about part 2 is Stronheim and "muh german engineering". Is there anything like this later on in the series?  So what's the deal with this picture? Is this Kira and Josefumi hanging out like buddies, or is it Jo2uke and Josefumi hanging out?  I hear Josefumi is supposed to be Jo2uke before the merge apparently, but they look nothing alike so i have no idea why Karera would mix them up.     Joseph's hand is some pretty solid german engineering. Granted, it gets broken all the fucking time to demonstrate stand power without actually injuring anyone, so it seems like a piece of trash.    Every time i see the family crest the illuminati pops into my head.     Berry nice.     thanks anon-kun    kira and josefumi, and jotaro was suppose to look enough like joseph that tomoko thought he was him. araki isn't good at making people look like other people on purpose.    It's Kira and Josefumi. It's a photo Karera has on her phone.   Karera herself says she barely recognized Secchan too. It could've been his voice or mannerisms that convinced her. Early in the part Norisuke said he must be a yankee because he picked the teddy bear over the robot and took his sneakers off inside the car.         If we fused Jo2uke and Jo3uke, We could make him into Josuke?     go away joel   Is Part 4 animu confirmed yet?   wouldn't that just make jo5uke?    He'd be Jo6uke.    well it seems like we're at an impasse    2jo4uke5me    We can agree that they would make a larger Josuke to the nth power rather than cancel out.    Would they continue getting closer and closer to Josuke (Original), or would they just become Jo∞uke?    I'm pretty sure that the joXuke who's hair consumes the entire universe will come long before jo∞uke   Jo(X^Y)suke is best jo   I feel bad for native Americans. But it still feels good to be black.   So what the fuck happened to the invisible baby from part 4?    She marry Josuke Higashikata and continue the Joestar family line.     Naked Silver, but the whole CD is amazing     implying White Album Gently Weeps wasn't one of the hypest moments in all of part 5    This fatass is groping your precious Nico. What do?   Sit back and watch Roman taking Niko out bowling.    Nico isn't precious to me though. She is the worst.      fatass   I SWEAR IF I FUCKIN SEE THAT WORD ONE MORE TIME      Dimitri please.    Do nothing.    But Nozomi is indeed a fatass.   And I love her for it.      Best girls   Do you feel triggered?   Niko  the love lives were made to be cummed inside  Why is Rin so best?    You only got that half right.    Why do real girls like Love Live? I don't get it.  Let her have her...She's a used up slut now.   I let it happen.    Because you're a faggot.    Fluffy story with no boys, so they at least can pretend it isn't otaku wish fulfillment.    ask her if she wants to grope me too.    It's colorful and has happy music.  If you want a better answer, a shit ton of lesbians like Love Live.      The city of Uruk    That bloodstain on his cheek looks like a dinosaur sitting upright while trying to eat something   ...okay?   It looks like an elephant who got it's trunk cut off.    Why did he say that if he hadn't any snarky comeback?    It's clear symbolism that Gil himself is just a dinosaur, and that he needs to make way for people like Shirou.    It's an /sp/ meme  the city of you      Kek    Does anyone have this without the Ilya attached?    Nah, I just made this because I'm an Ilyafag who really hates Gil.    I wasn't expecting that, and was pleasently surprised. Please let this be a thing.     It's yours, my friend.     Thanks Lori.     Do the students there go to Uruk High?    It looks like the UK to me.      Gil admitting Shirou is strong   Why the fuck would he even do that? He only shows respect to people worthy of respect, and he makes it quite clearly Shirou is not one of those people.   The line just felt so out of place.           He likely starts to change his mind when he has to pull Ea out. Either way the line's in the novel too.    Because he lost. In the VN he did as well, difference was he turned tail and ran before being put down like a bitch with the grail trying to killsteal him from Shirou.      Even if it was in the vn, it was still a pretty poor line. Gil was already going to lose to Shirou, no need to suck his dick even more by having him actually admit Shirou is stronger.      Gil was showing a modicum of respect for Shirou by the end. He even admitted he lost right to the guy's face.  Gil is the type of person who actually kind of starts to fly right when he has someone who can keep him in check. Look at Enkidu.      It's just him admitting defeat. He's still honorable enough to give credit where credit is due, and he still thought he had a chance to survive. He's an arrogant dick but he had no choice but to be humbled when getting so utterly dominated.    Think of it more as Gil trying to find solace in the fact that he lost. He's only saying he's strong to make his lose look better.         what goes around comes around.mp4     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-nc<wbr>rDHH3z7g</wbr>  [ ]     Go up on the wall of Uruk and walk around, examine its foundation, inspect its brickwork thoroughly. Is not (even the core of) the brick structure made of kiln-fired brick, and did not the Seven Sages themselves lay out its plans?   One league city, one league palm gardens, one league lowlands, the open area of the Ishtar Temple  Nope, no mention of a high school.     Why is /sp/ shitposting still a thing?   Gilgamesh and Enkidu at Uruk         mfw Liz dies     They can shake hands.    Nice.    You. See you in hell.     that slight hesitation before he pulled out ea  it's the little things man      I need something like this but with Gil's hand moving to rip Illya's heart from the movie between Illya's part and the UBW anime one.    At least he acknowledged shirou strength at the last second.       &gt;/sp/     Didn't shirou supposed to use excalibur here for the finishing move? Or was it only on DEEN's UBW?    In the DEEN movie, the only weapons he projects are Caliburn, and Kanshou &amp; Bakuya. Using Caliburn was movie original material.     An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.     there were animeonlies that thought "running out of mana is a pathetic ending" was referring to Gil being out of mana instead of Shirou   they thought Gil was going to kill himself with that last GOB because it was a more honorable death    Why the fuck wasn't Gilgamesh wearing his armour. Would have had a lot better a chance had he been wearing his golden plate armour   He didn't think Shirou deserved it, just like how he didn't think he deserved to face Ea.    Uruk isn't in Japan you fucking faggot    Gilgamesh   born before Christ   founder of Sumer   flourished the civilization in Mesopotamia   ruler of the Sumer City-states   implying this has anything to do with Japan    Learn history, you fucking retard.               can someone make an edit of this having him get his arm cut off by shirou just before he goes in for the surgery?    looks like England    It's like poetry     Gil will never get his heart ripped out      At this moment, you are are powerful   not because of any phony copies   but because you are enlightened by your own autism         Saved.   why are people so butthurt about Gil anyway, I always thought he was a pretty fun character   its perfect, thanks    Can yo make it so that it starts with Illya dancing from the OP, then goes to Doctor Gil, and finally to Gil losing his arm?   Shota Gil &gt; Bitch Gil &gt; Gil &gt; Loli Gil &gt; Douche Gil   *tips fedora*    zerobabbies    why would zerobabbies be butthurt about Gil killing Ilya though? I thought they'd be more angry about him losing or something   Never was really interested in the franchize. Is it even known what UBW Shirou will do later in his life when he's actually able to use UBW with his own mana?   Save people.   Why is he so perfect?   Ten years after UBW, Rin, Shirou and Waver basically fight off the Mage's Association by themselves in the process of permanently destroying the Greater Grail. That's the extent of the details we know, but it is mentioned that the Mage's Association considers being able to create a Reality Marble grounds for an immediate Sealing Designation (read: killing you and studying your body for magic science).     I will never understand the uncalled for hate retards give him.    You know, it really hurts to have your hymen torn   I wasn't here when the episode aired. What did people think of this episode? I personally think it deserves a 20/20 but I guess I'm biased.    Initial reaction was people freaking out, with a few people getting autistic about Shirou being able to jump so high.   Why was Archer still alive?    "Yup. There's a limit to what I can do here, so I'm thinking of studying there for about five years.  I hear that my dad did the same thing. And it's natural to go to the highest institute of education if you want to be a proper magus, right?"  We know in the very least the next five years or so will be spent at the Clock Tower.       Why would he be dead?    Meant to green text the second line.    9.5/10 They didn't explain how Archer could still be there  and unless I got bad subs Shirou didn't do the chant  Still, that's only taking .5 off from fantastic         It's the Kamiyan    How long into the first term before Luvia falls for Shirou?     Okay thank you     He did the chant, but it was the Japanese version (he does the same in the VN). It technically was bad subs since they didn't use the official Engrish version.     A series of events that started with her delivering a important essay that she wrote led to she and Rin falling from the London Tower. They survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Shirou Emiya, and in the aftermath received the nickname of Mary of July (Luvia) and Poppins of July   Fairly early, I assume.     How did Shirou get so strong? Rather, why was the manga version of UBW so "unique" when it came to the character designs?   Is this for real?     How did Shirou get so strong?   Power leveling with Archer.  Also holy fuck I forgot how bad that manga looked.         that fat man face saber     so wide    Thanks, I'd forgotten there even was a Japanese version    so much gain, /fit/ would be proud    He also gets a part time job as Luvia butler.    Who in Association can even face an older Shirou? He's shit against servants but a common magus will have to get lucky to survive a rain of a fucking noble phantasms and opponent who holds anti-magic swords in hands while moving as a fucking Sanic.     Wait, I meant the Fate version of the manga. I forgot how the original manga changed routes from UBW back to Fate halfway through. The designs used still make me wonder why it went that route.    Shriou gained a lot of muscle in this adaption.       I love it. Shirou should be buff as fuck.    Older Shirou is a toss up. We know he'll likely make plenty of strides later on.  Off the top of my head though, Bazett would take him down in his current state.      Bazett? Probably anyone that didn't come in a howling charge? There's so much fuckery we don't know about, it would probably be easy       Wait, I meant the Fate version of the manga. I forgot how the original manga changed routes from UBW back to Fate halfway through.   Seriously? Glad I never read that. Bait and switch like that would piss me right the fuck off.      Are they gonna go with the Manga Shinji and have him make up with Sakura? That would be so nice.    It pissed me off when I first learned of it a few years back. I thought that UBW would finally have it's own adaption until it suddenly shifted back into Fate.    From what i understand unless he faces a dedicated battle mage as an adult, or ain't backstabbed by some mind magic, it's not even going to be a battle.  For example, what could Tokiomi or fast wheels even do against Shirou who has enough mana to UBW? Launch fireballs when he moves at servant-tier speeds and can deflect them with his swords? Trying to turtle in mercury blob when he can rain it down with noble phantasms?  He's not the absolute top tier, but his special ability for sure makes him a pretty scary opponent, especially if he gains more combat experience.        Well, good things come to those who wait, I suppose.  Funnily enough UBW does have a manga now, though.      It makes sense I guess. I'm happy that all of the other routes for Fate are being adapted. I was getting a bit tired of always getting adaptions of the Fate route every single time.    That happened in the VN too, right? I remember Rin saying she saw Sakura visiting Shinji in the hospital and he was acting different( better)     Damn scans when?     using Caliburn   in UBW  Wow, good fucking job.      You learn your mythology Gilgamesh isn't the founder of anything. He's the 6th or 7th king of Uruk      A lot of people liked it.    First thing I read was Fate. I still hate the shit out of Gil for being such an obnoxious cockmongler.     He built walls and shits mang.       It technically was bad subs since they didn't use the official Engrish version.  The English chant is not a translation of the Japanese chant. It's a completely different poem. One of the same purpose, but a different story nonetheless.  They aren't the same. If anything the big mistake was how Crunchyroll subtitled the chant using Archer's English chant when Rin was going through the chant in her dream. Crunchyroll completely messed up and subtitled the wrong chant.  At the very least they didn't mess up in this episode.       Shirou comments on how Shinji acts now like when they first met which was 2 years before the abuse started    He probably doesn't want to be a magus anymore.    Because he lost to a nobody and he had to justify it somehow to not get his sense of self broken. Are you guys retar... this pathetic place gets worse by day    Do you have a template of this?    Not that guy but here.     I know this is comedy and all, but isn't that their goal since day 1? They both want Angry Manjew to be born but for different reasons, that never changed. Kirei wanted his answer and Gil wanted to kill humanity.         Oh god what the fuck is going on.      Saber lived as a man, and now she looks like one.     That would be great if we didn't already know that he was a spoiled brat as a kid, who wasn't exactly quiet about saying he hated Sakura since she was adopted, but "liked" her because it made him feel superior, and because he didn't know she was the heir yet. He treated her like a second class citizen and got buttmad when it turned out he wasn't the heir. For however much that is worth in that house.  Shirou tends to put Shinji with odd rose colored glasses even when he knew of some abuse. It's why when it gets completely shattered in HF he berates himself over how naive he was.  Then you get into Hollow and his and Shirou's friendship gets more one-sided. He refused to ever step into Shirou's house for no reason whatsoever, when Shirou walked across town to visit him, that scene in Hollow was the first time he ever entered Shirou's place. Plus, most of the character repeatedly say Shirou is Shinji's only friend (not just male friend, his only friend). It seems more like a friendship convenient for Shinji.  Even Nasu saying Shinji socially assassinated people who tried to take advantage of Shirou raises eyebrows if you look at it objectively. Wouldn't a real friend try to help you value yourself more, rather than just slandering other people to help you, then taking advantage of your kindness himself?            those gain.   I am dying.      Gil contributed the least out of the kings of uruk.  All Gil ever did in the end was built a wall around one of the temples in Uruk.  He isn't a founder of anything and he did not flourish the civilization of Mesopotamia.  Are Gilfags treating their fanfiction like facts?            This is honestly one of the funniest things I've seen in a while.      So are the other 5 Kings before him stronger?   The only thing that came to my mind at that moment.   The person who invented written language to unite people, the person who invented the concept of architecture, etc     no need to suck his dick even more by having him actually admit Shirou is stronger.  Gil was a coward. When he gets sucked into the black hole he's all like "Come on Shirou, help a nigga out!"     What about them?     tumblr  Leave now.     They act like actual kings    Do you mean they were the previous kings of Uruk?    Thinking about it, since the ancient language can control modern people in the Nasuverse, why doesn't Gil use that to fuck around?    Because Servants are under the Babelfish effect.    Can't you see the link between Enkidu and Shirou you dumbfuck.    Dependa on your definition of "strong" Gilgamesh is "surpassing of all kings" partly because he got raised as co-ruler of the underworld after his death    Since the Epic of Gilgamesh is just the first written story, would the hero in the first spoken story told by cavemen be stronger than him?   Actual power during life is a big fucking deal, Anon. Even without any boosts from age or whatnot, Gilgamesh (and Enkidu for that matter) was still retardedly powerful during life.    What about dinosaurs? Everybody loves dinosaurs, there's T-Rexes everywhere even today.    Same voice actor, actually. Probably not an accident.     mage goes full Night At The Museum during the holy grail war  I want it     This.     The person who invented written language to unite people,      GIRUGAMESH    Daily reminder that secondaries mad tears will continue to fall during this year, when Illya fucks him apart in prisma.   In fact, it makes no sense that Gil is defeated so easily, but Shirou is the hero, and the hero has to overcome in some way the villan (and let's face it, is a good battle).  In each cas, I like that Gil admits defeat, although he is a jerk, it's still a heroic spirit. In video games he is quite fun to have him as servant. He's a character who needs a friend who supports and guides him, in which case he can becomes a hero.  left alone is too eccentric and lazy and end up doing shit.        And in Heaven's Feel, when Sakura eats him.    I'm a newfag about Fate. What role has Gil in Heaven?    He warns Sakura and gets eaten later.    Pretty much the same as in other routes -bothering Sakura- only this time certain someone snaps and offs him a lot sooner.    Pulling out Ea is an acknowledgement of strength in itself.     So why in Fate route did Kirei and Gil just kidnap Illya and use her as the Grail (her intended purpose after all) but in Unlimited Blade Works they came up with this hairbrained scheme to rip out her heart and stick it in some other magus?     Gil for some reason completely changes his objectives between the Fate and UBW route. In Fate he doesn't give a crap about humanity being filled with mongrels so he goes with Kotomine's plan. In UBW he doesn't give a shit about Seiba and just wants to raise hell on earth.    He pulled out Ea AND admitted that Shirou was stronger than him, I don't know what you don't understand about Gil learning he was wrong in his initial assessment of Shirou.    For some it is difficult to accept that Gilg, despite everything, has an honorable side.    The bait is strong in this one.     Using the Grail means giving birth to AM, it was the same in every route, but the reader saw the full picture only in HF. Fate isn't even difficult, you just need to pay attention.      We know Gil has an honorable side.  In F/Z, he let Waver live because Waver chose to live on as Broskander's servant, rather than fight him and die as a Master.      He never got to pull out Ea. In the anime, he never even says Shirou is stronger, but he does concede that he's won because pushing Gil as far as he did means defeat in itself.    Yeah, like in Heaven's Feel when he went to kill Sakura because she was killing too many people.    Gil loves humanity a lot, sadly, we are garbage compared to the humanity he protected.    She didn't deserve it. I'm glad she's happy in Prisma.    Part of which is his own fault.    Gilgamesh is old as balls, and when you're old as balls everything seems worse than when you were young.     "Back in my day..."    So if Shirou actually rested a bit in F/SN and didn't get the shit beaten out of him every single day and let his circuits recharge, would he have had enough mana to cast UBW on his own? Will he ever be able to cast it on his own?    So if Shirou actually rested a bit in F/SN and didn't get the shit beaten out of him every single day and let his circuits recharge, would he have had enough mana to cast UBW on his own?   Yes, I believe so. Fucking Rin was just like him taking a stop off at the Pokemon Center to get a recharge.  It's stated that Fate Shirou, the Shirou who didn't learn to summon UBW, would be able to get the basics in 10 years, and master it in another 10. UBW Shirou already has the basics, so he'll probably be a complete master by his mid 20s.        If by that you mean "lived in fear of all their neighbours" then yes. If anyone from the indus valley wandered over they would have fallen over pretty fucking quickly.  The civilisations all around them were much more capable, as were the roaming nomads that would fuck them up at random, and during the period before Hammurabi, the gods were what mattered, the kings were just "shepards" Hammurabi was the one that proclaimed himself both father and shepard, that was only you know, 1000 years after gilgamesh.      Your doing God's work Anon.   Gil a shit.   Archer trained for years his Magic Circuit and his abilites. We see in Fate that Shirou hardly projected one weapon and that fucked his shit up everytime. In UBW, he did what he did thanks to all that knowledge he stole from his future self. And in HF, he skipped everything and ended killed himself.     only 36 NPs  Lancelot is trash      The entire theme of UBW is imitations being able to beat originals   So what does it say when Shirou imitates and beats himself?     Gilgamesh is such an awful king, the more I think about him being the "King of humanity" the more it pisses me off.   Masturbation    Not Lancelot's fault his master is a shit, and not using him correctly.     flipped england how  deep       Just sit safe in the knowledge it was literally never true, and Nasu just didn't do any research at all.      King of heroes not king of humanity.    Gil being defeated so easily is more of a result of ufotable's adaption implying Shirou overpowers Gil in both skill and power.  In the VN, Shirou only won under very specific conditions and even then it was pretty dicey.      Heroes implies he does heroic acts that benefit humanity. Gilgamesh from the Fate universe is a piece of shit. Also he should he more manly/masculine and not a pretty-boy.    Considering that his entire "epic" is just a tale of city against country, not much heroism.      Despite what everyone else says, I fucking love the original manga. The beginning art style is shit, but by later volumes it makes Shirou look as /fit/ as he should and quite honestly looks all right.      I never understood why people disliked the anime. In my opinion, it was a much better DEEN anime that tried to merge the routes together.  Also, they drew LE, which is even better.       disliked the anime  I mean the manga.     Shirou, while being fit, is described as looking small and somewhat boyish. He even has a bit of a complex over it. The manga got it way wrong.     is described as looking small and somewhat boyish.  Yeah, but the art says otherwise. Shirou isn't small or boyish at all, even if he isn't as buff as the manga makes him out to be.      I cleaned Last Episode up a while ago, but I never had the opportunity to dump them. Should I?     Do it    But the temple of Ishtar is full of whores. Sounds like a high school to me.     On it.  Shit, I'll have to resize since all of these are over 4 mbs. I'll start from the beginning again.      Shirou's back looks heroic as fuck in this.    Art of cloak Shirou when?      The anime made Shirou look worse against Gil, not better.      Merlin defied everyone's expectations.    Shirou has his PTSD face here.   Looks like a faggot.         He'll take your dick and put it on a little girl.    And that's the end of that. I always feel happy whenever I see this last page.    But anon, I already do that myself.    Shirou overpowers Gil even in the film, but in that circumstance, Shirou fights with a copy of Excalibur and Gil forgets to harness his power, insisting on wanting to do a sword duel.   Apart from the cutting arm, what happens in the novel?      Wut? In the tv anime, Shirou goes full Ninja, with showing off a power equal to Gil as control and speed of his swords.     Implying Gil protected anything.   Uruk society was so perfect even before Gil was born, that the concept of professional soldiers had not existed yet and instead of sending an angry mob of villagers against Enkidu, Uruk just sent a prostitute.  The only protection Uruk ever needed was against the rapist manchild that was Gil.         Heroes implies he does heroic acts that benefit humanity.   No it doesn't you faglord. A hero in the classical sense is just someone who does amazing shit. It had nothing to do with being morally good. Gil's rebellion against the Gods was the first act of heroism in that sense.  Also, Gil did benefit humanity in his time. That's why he's designated as Chaotic Good. He was an asshole who did whatever he wanted to his people but they were safe and secure and had everything. Unlike "so good and saintly" Saber who ran her piece of shit country into the ground.           Since the Epic of Gilgamesh is just the first written story   It's not the first written story.  Also, the king under the mountain that Gil met was Prototype Noah and of course, he is stronger than Gil.  Prototype Noah can refuse to go to sleep for a week while Gil is unable to pull off a week of no sleeping in the Epic.           It's not the first written story.   Yes it is. Any literature older than the Epic is not a story.      Gilgamesh killed a few divine beasts here and there to protect humanity with but he also ran his country into the ground like Arturia and fucked up by ending the AoG. Andersen calls him out on all this in CCC.    He goes "full ninja" because he's being pushed back by GoB at certain points. You can clearly see him landing farther away from where he started. When he falls toward Gil, he's unprotected after Rho Aias fades and could've been picked off by any sword that zoomed past him if Gil conveniently didn't miss every single shot (that he also never countered), and they stress his momentary hesitation as another reason for how Shirou even got to slice off his arm in the first place. He wasn't pressuring Gilgamesh throughout the entire fight like in the VN.    Are you pretending to be retarded?     Gilgamesh killed a few divine beasts here and there   But those were his problems and some of the beasts didn't bother anybody and just stayed in their spot and it was Gil that came to kill them while they haven't killed anyone, themselves. because they were just meant to be guards not wild beasts that attacked anybody that they felt like or destroyed property on purpose.  It was Gil that risked the safety of Uruk with his ego.       Enkidu was a Faker too, why did Gil like him?   This. In the VN Shirou closes in very quickly and there is no weapon that GoB shot that Shirou's UBW didn't counter.  And the grail swallowed Gil while Shirou was about to finish him off.     One thing I liked about the anime's version of the fight was how they turned Shirou's narrative into dialogue, like saying how Gil is just an "owner" not a "warrior" to his face, was excellent    Using the Grail means giving birth to AM  Kind of.      that pose  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=std<wbr>Y7NMWhLc</wbr>  [ ]    Who would win an insult fencing grailwar?   Probably the dog.    Shirou's hair is basically like Guts' when he does UBW. It makes me so happy.    Underrated post.   Because Enkidu didn't borrow someone else's ideals nor was he really a "faker" considering he was "all things within creation" to begin with. Enkidu's purity also probably has something to do with it.    I meant to respond to this post.     Servants only? Archer, Lancer and Fake Assassin (though some might be immune to his sarcasm) would probably make it into finals, not sure who would win though. Certainly not Gil, his entire vocabulary consists of mongrels and mad dogs.     Thinking that argument is valid  Iskander survived 80 when it was said it was the same for all the other Servants, hence quote proved wrong.     Gilgamesh was keeping count and was annoyed about having to use them. Against more threats like Cu and Shirou, he was raining down hundreds and thousands. Lancelot a SHIT    Do you think Gil would be angry that his vault is full of retarded looking monsters?     They blew it up in S2   Gilgamesh confirmed for S3 Villain       purity   I'm sure Gil experienced many pleasures from Enkidu's shape shifting abilities.     The max known output is 80, Gilfag. He was serious against Iskandar.  Gil thought 16 would do the job but we know how that ended up for the King of Jobbers.       you will never have a qt trap loyal only to you     The max known output is "thousands" against Cu.    Fun and games     Implying the total he used for 12 hours correlates to the total used at one given time   Gilfags are plebs as always.      actually read the book "The lion of Uruk" a few years ago. Was pretty intresting although I don't remember much.   Can we have an RIP moment for Shirou's baller black and white jacket that finally met it's end in episode 24?   I hope it makes a return for Heaven's Feel so we don't have to deal with his ugly shirt.    be demigod king of the world   invent the concept of heroism   spent years collecting the finest treasures of the world   some japanese teenager surpasses and kills you by copypasting all your shit   Emiya Shirou: Destroyer of all meaning         It is there, look at his waist.  Even Manga-Shirou in the new HF manga has it.       It's because he's japanese.      Hating the baseball shirt   Anon, that shirt is comfy as fuck.        A thousand swords appear.   The golden knight grins.   That's why he was able to block Lancer's surprise attack.   Lancer wasn't the only one trying to launch a surprise attack on his ally.  He used a thousand right off the bat, not throughout the entire 12 hour fight. Nice to see Iskandarfags overrating his ability as usual.   http://lparchive.org/Fatestay-night<wbr>/Update%20105/</wbr>          Rest in peace jacket. You protected us from that terrible shirt far longer than we deserved. o7     At least until Thug Life Saber NTRs you.     implying 2 different authors will have continuity in what they consider a large number.   implying hyperbole isn't a literary technique       Implying showing the swords means throwing them all   Gilfags, everyone. He has shown hundreds to others but in the end he has never deployed more than 80 in a barrage, pleb.      It doesn't matter what 2 different authors considers alot when we do get an actual amount. There's a pretty fucking big difference between using 80 and using a thousand right at the start of a fight that then proceeds to go on for 12 more hours. Stop trying to pretend Iskandar or Lancelot was ever close to any actual threat, they were more like slight annoyances whereas Cu can actually pose a challenge.    This, 16 was even called countless during Zero.     Cu is confirmed weaker than Diarmuid   Diarmuid was scared of Lancelot skill   Keep telling yourself that, Gilfag.        that goofy looking ahoge in saber's manface  My sides have lift off.      It doesn't matter what 2 different authors considers alot when we do get an actual amount   Actually that is infact, the only thing that matters. If Nasu doesn't think 80 is a cool enough number to use and instead exaggerates it then that doesn't mean that's the amount he actually uses. The text is not final, what's final are artists statement and interpretations.       just because he says a thousand doesn't mean it is a thousand  Straight-up denial. The fact that it was never changed and is in the actual release means that it's final.    <br/>    Denial   read  and   You are implying Shirou can instantly count the exact number of one thousand. This is clearly and hyperbole as calling 16 "countless". Furthermore you are implying someone weaker than Diarmuid can hold off a thousand NPs while being held back by a Command Spell.            Cu    weaker than Diarmuid  lmao      If it was anything other than swords you'd have an actual argument, but Shirou being able to count and instantly identify a thousand swords is more than within the realm of belief. Cu is fucking ridiculously strong, one of the strongest Lancers that can even be summoned by the grail to begin with.    Comptiq 2007-06 issue - Fate Dojo Q &amp; A: Q: Cu Chulainn and Diarmuid are both Lancers, but who will win in an honourble battle?  Diarmuid received more backup from his Master (prana supply), thus in terms of pure firepower, Diarmuid was stronger.    RIP Gilfag.         Implying it meant literally swords   Gae Bolg prototype is clearly there  Even more proof that it was just hyperbole.      Literally only because of his master.     this somehow means he's stronger than Cu  Fucking stupid. . Cu was able to go toe-to-toe with Gilgamesh for 12 hours despite having Kotomine as a Master. "Firepower" doesn't equal strength at all.      in terms of firepower  Diarmud still had shit NP and was a huge pussy      proof  Sure are using that word loosely as hell. They specifically mention a thousand swords, and Gilgamesh showing off Gae Bolg wouldn't be odd in any sense of the word considering he identified who Cu is.     kek. I meant purity as in purity of the heart but...Enkidu has a true neutral alignment so who knows if that still stands. You'd think out of the two that Gil would be the true neutral one but alas.   I hope Rick is good at running then.       That means that a weaker Kotomine that is also giving less mana to lancer than he should makes a weaker Cu than a Kayneth using Sola Ui mana to power Diarmuid. In equal mana terms Cu is probably stronger. i don't give a shit about Gil      He was still stronger than FSN Cu.   I guess Diarmuid can handle Gil for 13 hours then.   Doesn't change the fact that he is still stronger than Cu.          Shirou and Kiritsugu's Arturia is weaker than Rin's Arturia. She's still strong though     Equal mana yes, probably, but we are talking about FSN Cu.    Again, having more firepower =/= stronger. If you're seriously claiming Deermud has a fucking chance against Gilgamesh then you're severely overestimating the shitty Zero Servants.    now i fear how strong was Cu having Bazett as Master   And now the VN is deprecated.     ran his country into the ground like Arturia   Anon, Arturia raised her country out of the fucknothing it was when she took the throne into one of the greatest kingdoms of all time. It was the betrayal of Lancelot that destroyed Camelot.       He does have better stats than Kotomine's Cu, but he's not better as a Servant.    But England doesn't make up all of Great Britain, just a bottom portion.     Diarmuid was stronger.  Learn to read.  Google firepower, this is the meaning  1: the amount or strength of military weapons that can be used against an enemy  2: effective power or force  Too bad, Gilfag.             Pedophiles really hate gil     Is there any info about her skills as a magus? From what I've seen she is competent for a muscle wizard, but mostly relies on having shit engraved with runes and on fragarach. Hard to say if she'd make a good "master". She'd still probably roll over everyone.     Since when was Gae Bolg a sword?   Gilgamesh is quite capable of launching more than 80 noble phantasms at once from GoB, doing so is his ultimate super move in CCC unlocked when his origin is unleashed.   If you just mean physically stronger then possibly, if you mean actual capability in fights then no.     It's a blade on a stick, which Shirou counts as a sword for the purposes of UBW (you can see it in Archer's swordspam in the VN when he kills Caster)     I'm referring to him bringing out a thousand swords and Gae Bolg, not Gae Bolg being one of them. Gilgamesh has always liked taunting his opponent, so it's not something he'd be unlikely to do. It's specifically written there so any claims you make about it being an "inaccurate amount" is just false assumptions rather than the actual text.    It said sword, not blade. Nice try Gilfag.   Shirou said a thousand swords appeared, not a thousand swords and Gae Bolg. At least you tried. Regardless of how many he showed he was never said to throw all those. He showed hundreds to a fucking Shirou Saber.       Her family is old as fuck and is from a high class lineage, she must be a very good master    It was more Morgan's scheming, but honestly the fall of Camelot was just a little bit of everyone's fault. Or destiny, if what little translation of GoA is to be interpreted correctly.    Well Gil did want to make sure he beat Saber into submission.    At what point are you going to realise that the words are not final, they are not the end all and be all.  It's like I'm arguing with someone from the 1400s.      Lancelot was said to stall Numeral boosted Gawain for hours who is clearly far beyond anything Cu could even hope to be, yet you see Gilfags saying Lancelot would die from 32.    [x]Save Illya    He went into a 12 hour fight with Cu and brough out a thousand right away. It wasn't just a display of intimidation but to actually kill him. The instances you're talking about are when he just shows them his power and then fucks off.    Exactly, which is why the "thousands" there isn't final either and is an hyperbole. The whole sentence was an hyperbole.    No wonder he's so mad at humanity.    He'll hate it even more if ISIS ever gets to it.    Oh... you weren't arguing for literal thousands... okay then.    Showing off =/= throwing them.  Fate/Zero:Act 16 Part 9  As soon as their owner gave the order, countless primeval Noble Phantasms would shoot in unison toward Saber. She had literally become the target of a thousand arrows.   Yet he never threw all of them. Also, the word countless is there, guess what else was called countless.  Fate/Zero:Act 4 Part 2  A countless number of Noble Phantasms rained down on the road of the warehouse town, which already looked like it had received carpet bombing.  This was talking about 16.             Let's not forget Lancelot's master is pretty occupied suffering from the worms that are eating him alive.    I hope Rick gets to trashtalk Gil.    Forgot one last part about Act 16  As her left leg had been previously pierced through, she could not even dodge.  So, if her leg wasn't pierced, she could dodge "a thousand" arrows.      I do seem to follow.    How is that not showing off? Comparing him whipping out a "countless" amount to an actual quantifiable number doesn't mean that just because countless didn't actually mean infinite somehow makes 1000 not mean a thousand.    Wait, the jacket was just a collar'd version of his shirt. What makes the jacket not terrible compared to the shirt?     Gawain, even boosted, can't possibly match the firepower of 32 noble phantasms fired from GoB. As Nasu explains, Gilgamesh has the power of an army, which individual heroic spirits cannot hope to directly match.     It's his fault for abandoning his mage duties he would've handle the worm treatment a lot more better, and Sakura paid the price for it.     Equivalent to EX in almost all stats   Can't handle 32   Gilfags being as retarded as always. Even worse, Gawain Galatine is fucking Anti Army.       How strong would blondie be if he actually got up his lazy fucking ass and learned how to dodge?      Illya route confirmed      He showed them off just like against Cu, but he was never said to use all of them in any case. Worse, the word "thousand" is clearly an hyperbole as somehow it would mean that Saber can dodge a thousand arrows yet she is barely able to dodge Lancelot bullets.  The fact is, Gil has never been shown to use more than 80.       Shirou projects a way to save Ilya from dying on a multiroute level      an actual amount is clearly a hyperbole  Sure it is anon, you can keep living in your dreamland where Lancelot and Iskandar were considered actual threats rather than a minor annoyance and someone who he respected a person respectively.      Thousand swords   Gae Bolg is now a sword.  Keep living in your dreamland where Gilgamesh can throw more than a barrage of 80, Gilfag.       Protip: any stat multiplied by three is ++, not EX.   Also, congrats for completely missing the point. No matter how powerful a noble phantasm that a heroic spirit has, it's still just the one individual Servant. Excalibur is vastly superior to Galatine in every way, but even Saber can't beat Gilgamesh, because he doesn't just fight like a single Servant, he launches multiple attacks from all directions. That's what Nasu is referring to when he says Gilgamesh is like an army, and that's why Lancelot could not have handled the next wave of noble phantasms.        being this retarded  Gawain has high stats in every category and they get tripled under the sun. Excalibur Galatine is comparable to normal Excalibur on its own.      What if Gil fought seriously?  Serious Gil is like a unicorn. You've heard of it, you can probably sort of picture it in your head, but you've never seen it and you never will, because unicorns don't exist. It's like discussing a fight between two boxers and suddenly suggesting that the fight would turn out differently if one of the boxers was the Incredible Hulk.      2015   still believing in ancient JIDF propaganda       Lancelot could not have handled the next wave of noble phantasms  It's true that he could not match it, but he could get out line of fire of those attacks thanks to that A+ agility and fine an opening since you know it's Gilgamesh who always under estimates his opponents till it's to late. The real question if Kariya is able to maintain Lancelot in battle before dying like with the Saber fight were Lancelot almost won.       Protip: any stat multiplied by three is ++, not EX.  240 goes above the Grail scale, meaning EX.   multiple attacks from all directions  Love how Gilfags like to say this shit when he has only shown the ability to do this in non canon scenarios like the UBW anime or Illya.   Lancelot could not have handled the next wave of noble phantasms.  Yet Iskander handled 80.            Literally everyone is bullying Gil during FSF, I'm certain Rick will get a shot at the Gilgamesh roast.     he has only shown the ability to do this in non canon scenarios like the UBW anime or Illya.  It should be obvious he can, and since when UBW isn't canon but for some reason Zero is.   Yet Iskander handled 80.  He couldn't. Even then, that fight was the opposite of Gil fights with Shirou or Lancelot, he actually respected the oponent and went all out just because he wanted not because he needed.        It's really great, Gil is shit when things are going his way.     It should be obvious he can  It should be obvious Hassan can beat serious Gil. See? I can do it too.   since when UBW isn't canon but for some reason Zero is.  Anime = not canon   He couldn't.  He did, no Battle Continuation, still alive after being showered by 80.            Anime = not canon  multiverse lol     Then F/Z LN isn't canon either only FSN and HA VN are since they are actually written by Nasu     It should be obvious Hassan can beat serious Gil.  It is different, in this case you are talking bullshit; in the other, we were already shown that he clearly can. The thing is that for some reason you see the anime as non-canon when Nasu already said that it is 100% canon.     If you with the bullshit mutiverse argument it's even worse for you case, since Julian pretty much said Lancelot &gt; Gilgamesh and EMIYA.   Being written by Nasu has nothing to do with it. If Nasu considers it canon, it is. If the anime is canon then. The 32 comment is invalid since it wasn't mentioned. Invisible Air B STR Saber can somehow cut Heracles. Heracles is confirmed to be able to defeat Gilgamesh if he let Illya die. Gilgamesh accepts defeat against Shirou.  Seriosly, I can keep going but it's only going to make Gil look worse. That would also mean the DEEN anime is also canon.              If you with the bullshit mutiverse argument it's even worse for you case, since Julian pretty much said Lancelot &gt; Gilgamesh and EMIYA.  Okay then I agree. I'm not that anon by the way.     You're right, he's a terrible person. Who wouldn't want worms inside his body voluntarily?    But the F/Z LN isn't canon to the F/SN VN and F/HA isn't canon to the F/SN VN nor F/Z.     that Saber   No wonder they called her KING Arthur       in this case you are talking bullshit  Just as you are.   we were already shown that he clearly can  In non canon scenarios.   The thing is that for some reason you see the anime as non-canon when Nasu already said that it is 100% canon.  He never said that, but ok, let's play your game. Now the 32 comment isn't even made, and somehow Saber can cut Heracles without Excalibur. Good to know that bullshit is now canon.            Heracles is confirmed to be able to defeat Gilgamesh if he let Illya die.   Gilgamesh accepts defeat against Shirou.  This are in the VN as well.   Invisible Air B STR Saber can somehow cut Heracles.  It wasn't Invisible Air B, it was Prana Burst A.        Wait a second Nasu said Prisma is Ilya's route so that means. Lancelot &gt; Gilgamesh and EMIYA. confirmed.    So what's happened to Gil?  Has his existence been obliterated by way of the grail hole?  Or has he returned to the heroes realm or whatever?        This are in the VN as well.  Heracles comment is never made. Gilgamesh only says Shirou is stronger than he is inside UBW, but never says "you won" as he did in the anime.   It wasn't Invisible Air B, it was Prana Burst A.  Watch the anime again, I'm not talking about the kill, I'm talking about the cuts. Heracles had cuts all over his body and was bleeding far before the Prana Burst.         Search for the UBW BD interviews, there Nasu explicit says that the anime is a different continuity than the route, but still canon. This isn't even something to be discussed, everyone knows that everything is canon except Prisma which is like another multiverse.      Nyah Shirou wasn't trying to go superhero on Sakuralot at that point. Gil Miyu was too emotional and didn't spammed enough swords from GOB before she almost got hijacked by Gil.       Search for the UBW BD interviews, there Nasu explicit says that the anime is a different continuity than the route, but still canon.  He only says things happened differently in the anime, never said it was canon.   This isn't even something to be discussed, everyone knows that everything is canon except Prisma which is like another multiverse.  Nasu said that was considered the Illya route, stop trying to save face, Gilfag. Go with the multiverse argument, and Gilgamesh instantly looks far worse than he already does. I'm trying to help you here.        Julian comment, it didn't matter how serious those 2 were, Sakuralot was still going to fuck them up. Shirou didn't even realize what was going on before he got wrecked. Sakuralot was so fast he couldn't react to his weapon getting stolen or him being cut.    AND MANGA.    So only F/SN VN is canon?   fine to me   I'm not a Gilfag I don't give a shit        I understand with Shirou since he's running on nothing.  If Miyu was completely jacked by Gil, well Sakuralot would have been blown away.       Nasu said that was considered the Illya route  So now, Prisma is canon? What do you even consider canon apart from the VN and, apparently, Prisma?  Also, I am not a Gilfag, if anything I prefer Illyas and Shirou a lot more.        Not that anon but I don't think you know what canon actually means.     If Miyu was completely jacked by Gil, well Sakuralot would have been blown away.  That's not what Julian said. Julian was daring them to throw more NPs as it wouldn't even make a difference.  So, stop making up bullshit, Gilfag.        Not that anon but I don't think you know what canon actually means.  Knowing Nasu with lazy habit he made Prisma Illya's route you gotta accept it.      So now, Prisma is canon?  He said something about it, but it was more of a joke, unless you support the multiverse argument, of course.   What do you even consider canon apart from the VN and, apparently, Prisma?  Zero LN and Hollow Ataraxia.         Zero LN and Hollow Ataraxia.  Fair enough, I will argue that Extra and CCC are also canon, but I guess it's up to you if you see them as canon or not.     It looks like an obese king sneezing.   http://gigazine.net/news/20150621-f<wbr>ate-sn-ubw-event/  Just want to remind people that episode 24 had cut content.  </wbr>   Just look what happened last time he was humiliated by everything from random grunts, vampire dragons, and computer programs.  As long as he's in the position of a challenger, he isn't likely to lose.      Returned to the Throne    That shit is only a bit stronger than Excalibur in terms of pure power though.    It's a bit stronger than True Excalibur, which we haven't seen to date since it can only show its real power like that when the Earth is in danger.  You don't seem to get it while saying "Lame, Excalibur is the best", Ea was buffed recently, therefore Excalibur was buffed in GoA to stay consistent, but it's not comparing normal Excalibur to full power Ea..  The Excalibur that is a bit weaker than this hasn't been seen entirely.        FUCK I CAN'T UNSEE IT    How was it buffed recently? It seems like you are just making up bullshit.    all this lancelot is strong  He is fucking weak, but he is stronger than he actually is since he is in berserker class. Actually he is one of few servant that become better in berserker class.  Iskandar is strong  He is a shit servant and a shit Rider. Who the fuck thought his weak ass bull is a better ride than his horse? The actual legend says his horse is as strong as a pegasus, if only it can fly.  Diarmud vs Lancer  They have same speed, but diarmud has 2x multiplayer (+). In term of fire power, diarmud is better as it said. But Cu beast-like fighting could be a problem since he also have runes and better spear. Also remember diarmud fight like most lancer but only Cu fight focusing on thrusting, that how skilled he is. I don't care who will win despite their stat but I don't think diarmud can survive Cu's Gae Bolg. Do you think just because you're faster than someone you can win? Think about you fighting a boss in a game.         No, that's Ea's full power. The swings Gil used to counter Excalibur in Fate were only slightly more powerful, but even then Ea was not fully charged. At full power, Ea's damage exceeds all common sense and destroys Gaia's Supreme Reality Marble, subjecting the target to absolute annihilation.     Nice fanfiction.  Ea is a citybuster at best.       Play CCC or F/HA, I don't have time to waste dealing with your ignorance.      what nasu said is fanfiction  Nice headcanon.      Keep crying Gilfag.  Maybe you should be the one who needs to play F/HA.        Who the fuck thought his weak ass bull is a better ride than his horse?   It was Zeus Bull  It's much better than you seem to think.  Fighting with two weapons comes with a lot of weaknesses as it does comes with a few plus marks. It's like in Tales of Symphonia when Kratos thought Lloyd was retarded when he said "Well one sword is good, and two swords means its like x2 as strong with x2 chances to move, right?"  You lose focus, can't put as much power or defense in, etc. Even if you're a master its a fighting style with some good and some bad.            Isn't that just a doujin though?    It's published by Type Moon.     Gilgamesh accepts defeat against Shirou in the VN too, they just changed "I cannot defeat him here!" into "In this moment you are strong!"     It's an official enough manga, but not really a big one.  It's more like different authors do something each chapter I think, or its a comedy?  It launched to promote or cash in on UBW anime.             Aren't all of these the exact same person?      &gt;what nasu said  is that Ea's destructive output isn't really much greater than Excalibur.  Ea can rip the fabric of reality, hence the Anti-World attribute, but its actual destructive range isn't anywhere near capable of destroying the world.      All of the Extra manga are probably ranked higher on the scale, as a way to say this isn't very high up, but it is official.  Zero percent heroine points  Rito, no    That delicious Tiger   http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/<wbr>4041028833/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie<wbr>=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=AN1VRQENFRJN5  This is it, right?  </wbr></wbr>            Art looks delicious  character look better than in the actual show           What he needs is a good punch in the face, followed by being disemboweled with a chainsword        Can someone please tell me where Lady-Lancelot is from? This looks really interesting     Don't expect anyone to get that, people born in the 00's are posting here.     It's Sakura using the Lancelot card in Prisma.  This Sakura is fucking batshit insane.       I need to know what's going on here         Rick  What'd I miss?       It looks like Shirou and Rin were working on dispelling the boundary field around the school, they were about to kiss, Archer got pissed, but then suddenly Shinji appeared and got in the way of fire.     Its Sakura   Not really confirmed      Police don't know shit    She calls him sempai and looks like her.     I love this hentai artist.     No, I mean F/SF wise. I don't want to tread into Beast's Lair to attempt to find out that way, so all I know is I've seen him with some connection to Ayaka, who has somehow become a character in the redone version of F/sf.    He's Richard the Lionheart.    Looks like checking for that image in the archive helped, though. Neat.  Henry VIII Servant when?    Why didn't he just use the chains   All conjecture just because she said Sempai, doesn't mean a thing.  Now it's a lower class student from Shirou, that much we might know. That much alone can open up some possibilities. Maybe its Ayako's brother who ended up taking on some responsibilities in the Archery club. Fate genderbends yet another fucking historical figure, GJ Nasu, you shit. Clearly Ayako's brother looked up to Shirou the upperclassman Sempai, but before they could be in the same club, Shirou dropped out of school and became a delinquent.  or it could be that Track Team girl who is also a Kouhai.        Really? Are you serious?    You're fucking retarded. He does it in the Fate route, too. But you'll find some obnoxious excuse to handwave the events of FSN, I'm sure.    Henry VIII as a servant would be hilarious.    His NP involves a convoluted process of marrying the target in order to cut off their head.      They scale with divinity, meaning they're just strong chains against shirou, who is spamming a million NPs at this point. They'd just get blasted apart or deflected while inside UBW.    It's especially effective against Catholic servants.      vs Jeanne  I imagine she'd pull out La Pucelle as soon as he tried to do anything.     He fights seriously  on a whim  in F/HA.     Serious Gil is like a unicorn. You've heard of it, you can probably sort of picture it in your head, but you've never seen it and you never will,   CCC  People can't give that excuse anymore, we've seen Serious Gilgamesh before.   Gil: "This woman is a worthy oponent. My chains and sword, let me use them as I please, Master!"   In fact CCC Gilgamesh had to become stronger than 100 percent Gilgamesh before the end, to even stand a chance.            Where exactly? There are different meanings of "all directions". If you mean some shit like what he did during the dogfight, yeah, he can do that. But some Gilfags seem to believe Gil can do 360 GoB like in the anime. He has never done that shit in canon.     People can't give that excuse anymore, we've seen Serious Gilgamesh before.  And it's still like finding a million dollars on the ground. It can happen, but the chances of it happening are so slim it might as well be called impossible.     No one cares though, since it will never be translated.    Also Fate/Strange    Not canon.    And he's getting his ass kicked there so far too.     Teen Taiga best Taiga.      Refuses to go serious against True Archer  Point still stands.     Against Enkidu    The collar ofc.    That's because it was Enkidu. Refusing to go serious on True Archer pretty much proves that it is indeed extremely rare for it to happen, and the circumstances required for it to happen are rare too.  Seriously, he goes serious on Iskander but not True Archer, is he for real?      Fate/Strange fake is canon as is extra and Apocrypha. Just because they aren't direct sequels to Fate/Stay Night doesn’t render them "fanfiction".   If Shirou (and by extension, Archer), decided to let Goldie live, would they be best bros?   Not set on the same universe, don't follow the same rules. So basically, not canon.    I always viewed the Iskander fight as being respectful rather than serious. If Gil was truly serious he would have just kept up Ea until Iskander was reduced to nothing.     &gt;Seriously, he goes serious on Iskander but not True Archer, is he for real?   Being serious for him is a matter of respect; he'll do it in recognition of his master in CCC, he'll do it for Alexander since he respects him, he'll do it for Enkidu since it's Enkidu, or for Saber even.  Against True Archer, this guy only pisses him right the hell off, and doesn't deserve his respect.  An arrogant cur that speaks down to Gilgamesh and says only if he uses his greatest sword will they maybe be equal, Gilgamesh will not use his real shit in that situation. This guy starts off by attacking Gil's master, continues to do it for the next twenty minutes, Gilgamesh doesn't want to get serious since that's like saying he wins, that's like Gilgamesh admitting everything about him, that he really is that strong and might be better than him.  Against this kind of prick Gil just doesn't want to give into that sort of thing.            By that logic you can say that KnK is not a canon work because it doesn't take place in the same universe.    Not canon to Fate, yeah.    With that logic you could say Fate is not canon to Fate, since the game involves over forty alternate universes, which is an entire plot point of the third route.  UBW is not canon because Fate exists, and Fate is not canon because UBW exists.      A timeline is not a universe.    Okay but that's exactly what I'm trying to point out, the other Fate series aren't canon to Fate/Stay Night but they're still canon on their own in that they're Type-Moon published works supervised by Nasu (Save for fragments I believe).    She even says he hasnt been coming to see me lately. Sakura is really the only one who he sees on a regular basis out of those.    Well, again, same rules don't apply. You are trying to compare Superman to Superboy Prime, basically.    nothing is true everything is permitted       Man, I love every route of FSN and it's respective pairings since each one kind of represents something different and none of them devalues the others. But holy shit how can Shirou and Rin be so fucking cute together is beyond me.       A best.    holy shit it's wrapped around his waist ART OF THIS WHEN      That'll never happen. Archer will  clean up after  us.       Serious Gil is like a unicorn  kek    God Eater 1st ep screening has been cancelled due to production problem. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LQs<wbr>2Y4puHPA</wbr>  [ ]  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/649<wbr>30</wbr>      Ufotable a shit QUALITY CG confirmed     screening  No fucks given, we never see those anwyay     That looks fucking horrendous, holy shit   Haha, oh lawd.   episode 1   production problems       That looks godawful, holy fuck.   Off to a great start.  Get to it, Genius.   I would, but my relatives are nuts and will act like an alarm clock.   I have to actually look for a job tomorrow, so  maybe I'll stay up.   I somehow accidentally slept for 16 hours last night and didn't get out of bed until 4pm, so I'll be here all night tonight. #neetproblems   I can't stay up!  I became an un-NEET a few three days ago, and have been working nine hour shifts!     3 midterms in the next 2 days  Of course I'll stay with you    Is Assassination Classroom any good?   If you're 16 years old then go right ahead, you'll most likely enjoy it. Otherwise you're better off finding something to watch that's actually good, and not just edgy shonen shit that panders to losers who got bullied in highschool.    like every other japanese anime about trained assassins nobody ever kills anyone   If you aren't an uppity little bitch who thinks that every anime that isn't NGE isn't good, then yeah, it's alright, it's a comedy and a little juvenile but meh, so are a lot of other "good" anime. I'd recommend watching it if you don't have anything else qeues up that you've been putting off.   No. It barely has anything to do with assassination at times. Shit filler manga with shit a shit shounen protagonist.   I feel like the series would've had better results if it was in the Seinen category.     It was pretty damn fun. Even though it felt childish at times I still really enjoyed it. People who took it too seriously are dumb and probably didn't enjoy it.   My dick   Not at all        What does /a/ think of the season 2?  Everything was so dull, and they tried so hard to be edgy. I liked the original but had a hard time finishing this crap.  Will the movie be as bad?       Both seasons were shit    says you    Psycho pass in a typical dystopia anime trying too hard to be dark. The first season was okay at least, the second was just bad    There is no second season.    You can keep telling yourself that   Will you remember the Etotamas when they're gone?   Maybe she has acne?     Will you remember the Etotamas when they're gone?  I'll probably archieve it for now, it might merit a potential rewatch.     What happened to the rest of the chapters? Or the guy translating die?    I shared the mega link to my scans a few weeks ago. An anon who kept posting with Usa-tan reaction images said he would TL them at his free time, but there hasn't been any news from him ever since.  So either the guy really died (if so, sincerely RIP), or  footfags   best anything          Slut   Best girl.   </blockquote>]
