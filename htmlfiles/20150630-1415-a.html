Not figure-breaking for me though.</br>  <br>Why would anyone support that shitshow, or want figures of its completely unlikeable cast?</br>  <br>I think their silliness is what makes them so hot for me, they are barely wider than the belt loops, and damn too tight. Cameltoe splitting levels of tight</br>  <br><br>Damn. Lala is hot. Sexy hot.

Cancelled too many orders? Some dude on the other thread managed more than 8 cancellations and is still alive on ami.</br>  <br>Damn it, wrong pic.</br>  <br>Nah they had an alternate email and I never checked it since it wasn't my main. Lost out on about 40 preorders. What I don't get is I spent 30k usd with them and they still cancelled my account. Fuckers be ruthless.</br>  <br>I have like 10+ cancellations and 3 of those were were 3 months in a row of canceling entire orders. <br><br>Still able to order from them,</br></br></br>  <br>we rule the world man, get over it normie</br>   Trying to collect all the BRS figmas <br> Impossible to find anything but Str and Char, which I already own, anywhere but Amazon of all places <br><br>Kill me it hurts to live</br></br></br>  <br>Except it isn't.</br>  <br>The Sonico GK is a little different. But it is the same artist.</br>  <br>Except it is.</br>  <br>They are both hot and I would fuck them with the force of a 1000 dying stars.</br>  <br>I would want this but it's so plain, also GK</br>  <br>Not really, unless you are blind or retarded</br>  <br>I just want to point out that the guide url doesn't work with "www" in front of it. In the future, just use http://buyfag.moe</br>  <br>Yes really, unless YOU are blind or retarded. The sculptor and sculpt fundamentals are literally , which reinforces my original post.</br>  <br>Already been pointed out in the thread and in the duplicate thread that was just deleted.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>And? It's still not Sonico, as similar as it may be.</br>  <br>I can't wait to smell her PVC.</br>  <br>OK buddy. Let's just pretend that you're right and I'm wrong.</br>  We more healthy grill figures.  <br> healthy <br>Diabetes isn't healthy, anon.</br></br>  <br>Yes the pose is the same so? Proportions are different, the details are completely different as well, so is the expression, face and accesorios. Oh and most of all, it's not Sonico at all. <br><br>So yes, you are damn retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Her face is already an appropriate level of fatness for the rest of her body. She's fat but not that fat. People in these threads act like she's morbidly obese or something.</br>    <br>How are those panties even comfortable, look how far they dig into her fat hips.</br>  <br>The sculpt is literally designed for Sonico, by the same sculptor, and uses literally the same sculpt with slight alterations. Now it has a different head. Sorry buddy, looks like you're the only retarded one here.</br>  <br>her tits are too hight</br>  <br>Different head, navel, thighs, arms and even the feet, tits as well and oh the head is different. <br><br>Again how is she Sonico? <br><br>Yes you are blind and retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  She came 4 days early, thank you mr. postman<br>Anybody else get her?</br>  <br>Why is /rk9/ infecting /a/? Good god the cancer is strong.</br>  <br>Not the same sculpt at all, they just share the pose. The proportions are different. From head to toes.</br>  <br>It is definitely the same sculpt or at least uses the original sculpt as a basis for this one.</br>  There's a figure on amiami I want to get but the description is so weird for google translate. Any help?<br><br>開封使用　背中色移り小/箱破れ・イタミ大<br><br>Box is damaged like usual but what the heck is the rest?</br></br></br></br>   alternate panties <br><br>why isnt this a thing yet? who cares about extra faces, give me panties</br></br>  I'm thinking of buying this http://www.crunchyroll.com/store/p/<wbr>166385/Knights-of-Sidonia-Series-18<wbr>-Garde-Figma <br><br><br>or this http://www.crunchyroll.com/store/p/<wbr>165199/Knights-of-Sidonia-Tsugumori<wbr>-Figma<br><br>but i heard it comes disassembled and you have to build it piece by piece and that it isn't painted and you have to do it yourself<br><br>Can anyone confirm this? how the fuck are we supposed to paint this...</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>Getting this and removing the head and tail, so I can put a Sonico head on it because this is never coming out</br>  <br> The sculpt is literally designed for Sonico, by the same sculptor, and uses literally the same sculpt with slight alterations <br>Not much more needs to be said. You can pretend like the figure isn't originally Sonico, if you like. Whatever consoles you.</br></br>  <br>See the gif above, is not the same sculpt, and even if the sculptor based lala on that Sonico that certainly doesn't make her Sonico. <br><br>Your argument is plain silly.</br></br></br>  <br>Your gif does a good job of proving his point.</br>  <br>If you are blind and don't see the actual proportions</br>  <br>If you mean the word 'normie' specifically then yes, but calling out normalfags for their shit isn't anything new here.</br>  <br> Crunchyroll <br><br>Anon please just kill your self or stop buyfagging.</br></br></br>  <br>The two figures are obviously different but you have to admit that the Sonico figure is clearly the inspiration for the Lala figure, just with slight alterations.<br><br>Get over it.</br></br></br>  <br> figma are model kits <br> CR <br>Is this bait?</br></br></br>    <br>I've been following the sculptor's twitter for ages and there's nothing to suggest it's ever happening though.</br>  <br><br>I never said I'd buy it from CR, if it makes you feel better here http://www.amazon.ca/Knights-Ichina<wbr>nashiki-Shiratsuki-Tsugumori-Animat<wbr>ion/dp/B00L4R2EES/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UT<wbr>F8&amp;qid=1435630131&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=<wbr>knights+of+sidonia</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Not the first time I've seen that<br><br>Kotobukiya did that with their Shining series figures.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And I never said it wasn't inspired nor based on Sonico, I said that lala is not Sonico, which was the/your original point.</br>  <br>Okay, it's definitely bait.</br>  <br>Not sealed, some discoloring on the back/box damaged - lots of damage.<br><br>I think. Looks like it's just the box.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay I haven't checked amiami for this but holy shit they have it for cheaper <br><br>http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=TOY-RBT-3918&amp;page=top%2F<wbr>search%2Flist%3Fs_keywords%3Dknight<wbr>s+of+sidonia%24pagemax%3D40%24getcn<wbr>t%3D0%24pagecnt%3D1<br><br>has anyone ordered from this place? how is it?</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the guy you were arguing with. Just curious about the whole thing. It's awfully close.<br><br><br>Thank you so much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one uses amiami. It isn't reputable.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks for the laugh, bait-kun.</br></br></br>  <br>okay everyone move along, nothing to see here</br>  What did /a/ think about this manga? I probably missed some discussions but how did it end?  I understand the raws for the manga are out but my moon is lacking and I'm very curious as to how the manga ends and a discussion would be nice  <br>is this shoujo manga?</br>  <br>It's more of a shounen but I really don't know how to identify it</br>  <br> Looks like MC go back to his city and confesses to the girl he loved, she refuses and MC moves on. </br>  Young Adult Rin is too cute.<br><br> So is her HF epilogue appearance </br></br>  Honestly I would rather watch a 25 episode series about Rin and Shirou in the Clock Tower doing mage shit with Waver<br><br>Why couldn't they make that series happen?</br></br>  <br>Sequel of this when?</br>  <br>Never but that is kind of the purpose.<br><br>Last episode stated this.<br>Their lives will go on to who knows what. We were only around to witness a portion of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah what last episode stated was that UBW continues on its own. They can always give more info on the dismantling of the grail 8 years after this episode.</br>  <br>Enough with your rhino queen, now it's time for her imouto to shine.</br>  <br>I was referring to Last Episode.<br><br><br>Pass-o</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura doesn't really shine in HF though.</br>  <br>Sakura never shines. People like HF for Kotomine and Illya. Sakura is barely a character, she's more like a walking plot point.</br>  <br>What if it had been Matou Rin and Tohsaka Sakura?</br>  <br> Sakura never shines. <br>Well, duh. Black Holes don't let light escape.</br></br>  <br>Well, we already got a  Rin clone and Waver doing mage shit FOR the Clock Tower </br>  <br> Shirou dies as he isn't saved, the end. <br>There that's pretty much all there is to it.</br></br>  <br>After HF<br><br>Do you really think it's over after the success of the first two?<br><br>This is Fate we're talking about here. Unlimited Milk Works</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou, if you become a bad boy, I will scold you.</br>  <br>Rin steals Shirou's virginity after falling for him and then kills herself to take down Zouken before the war. Sakura Tohsaka won't search for a fight in school or even try in the war so Shirou doesn't need a heart fix. Since Shirou never gets his servant, Illya kills him. <br><br>BAD END.</br></br></br>  <br>Young adult Rin is a miracle of the universe</br>  <br><br> Sakura <br>The talented master of the Thosaka family. Kinder and less cunning than OG Rin, but her decisions tend to backfire less too. Doesn't put up the perfect girl facade, but she's nice to everyone and well loved among her classmates.<br><br> Rin  <br>The real master of the Matous and school's queen bee. Cold hearted and with an iron will, has managed to build a symmetrical relationship with Zouken. She can't get rid of him but her powers allow her to keep him from making her comply, it's a perpetual chess game between those two. Abuses Shinji and pretty much everyone around her, and doesn't take part in the war just to mess up with Zouken's plans. Until she takes an interest in Shirou, that is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's what I've been telling you fags all along.<br><br> Hair down is best hair style. </br></br></br></br>  <br>This ending was too much, fuck UFO and their cocktease.</br>  <br>Blonde+green eyes please, like Saber.</br>  <br>I can't believe we actually got London shenanigans, it's like Ufo read our threads.</br>  <br>You have Extra Rin for that.</br>  <br><br> Tohsaka Sakura <br> passive <br>She'd be Luvia-tier in smug arrogance.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The sad fact of Rin as a Mage is that she simply doesn't have the mentality to achieve the goal of all Magi - she's far, far too human. Her dad was similar, although he at least knew he needed to detach himself from the human experience to stand a chance, however shit he was at it. Rin will probably die having recreated a perfect copy of one of Zelretch's relics or something, an achievement in its own right, but she won't be able to properly communicate what went into its making, let alone use it to reach the Maelstrom of Origins. She'll leave her work, the mounted progress of the Tohsaka lineage, to an heir who is not guaranteed to be a prodigy like her, and with the steady decline of Magecraft, may even be of inferior overall talent.<br><br>The only way to reach Akasha in this day and age is to throw away your useless humanity and surpass mortal perception. Only monsters willing to embody an ideal - throwing away everything in pursuit of a single transcendent theory - like Araya, Kurogiri, Roa, and Nrvnqsr have what it takes.<br><br>So the rest of Rin's life probably isn't all that interesting.<br><br><br><br>There is this, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The real master of the Matous and school's queen bee. Cold hearted and with an iron will <br><br>That's fucking stupid.<br><br>Penis worms would break Rin just the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder who had the bright idea. Not only did they read the threads they went beyond, the most I could envision for the ending was a 10 second airport scene implying they were going to London.</br>  <br> She'd be Luvia-tier in smug arrogance. <br>Eh no, Sakura does have some of those traits but to the minimum. Her true personality is the one you see already.</br></br>  <br>Her true personality was fucked up by worms.</br>  <br>Sakura's personality in FSN is not all based on the fucking dick worms. You are stupid.</br>  <br>She really is.<br>I forgot how much I missed her before.</br></br>  <br>No it wasn't, nice fan fiction though.</br>    <br><br>Stay mad and wrong.</br></br>  <br>Nasu did.</br>  <br> The only way to reach Akasha in this day and age is to throw away your useless humanity and surpass mortal perception <br>That's a nice headcanon you have there.</br></br>  <br>Rin really does not care that much about going that far with her magic. Yes she is dedicated as fuck but it is hard imagine her going to the point where she would sacrifice her life and leave Shirou alone just to push the lineage even further. Like you said Rin is too emotional/human to be a all or nothing mage.</br>  <br>I am not wrong, the only time she had her personality fucked up by worms was before she met Shirou were she was a dead fish.</br>  <br>Adult Ilya &gt; Adult Rin</br>  <br>What if it had been Tohsaka Sakura AND Tohsaka Rin?<br>I'm sure Rin would've been fine with sharing her crest with her imouto.</br></br>  <br><br>There's literally a bad end where Rin gets subjected to penisworms in Sakura's enclosed shadow space. It fucks her up.<br><br>It doesn't matter how strong her will is, she's still a loli when it'd begin. It'd still traumatize her. It'd traumatize anyone.<br><br>The best she could do is act rebellious like Kariya, but it's not like that sort of temperament has any meaning in the long run, not until the Fifth Holy Grail starts and she gets the slightest opportunity to take control like Sakura did.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Better than Rin.    <br>Pretty sure Illya is considered to 17/18 in the novels...</br>  <br> So the rest of Rin's life probably isn't all that interesting. <br>Maybe for HF Rin but UBW Rin will follow her husbando and she still has a grail to dismantle.</br></br>  <br>You know the biggest difference would be that Zouken doesn't need to change Rin's alignment via wormrape because with Average One she already includes Water.<br><br>Also their personalities were already distinct when the seperation happened</br></br></br>  <br>It fucks everyone up, that doesn't mean it changes your fucking personality you retard.</br>  <br><br>Okay, that's not QUITE true. You can also be like the Aozakis, but even then there's weird shit going on.<br><br>The only EXPEDIENT way is to throw away your humanity, I mean. And not any of this half-assed "hurr I sacrifice street urchins for magic crystals" idiocy. All of the closest fucks to Akasha who aren't True Magic users are out of their fucking minds. Actually, probably them too, considering how True Magic seems to eat at one's identity, as mentioned with Aoko and Zelretch, and the Einzberns aren't even human anymore, just an experiment desperately trying to come to its conclusion)</br></br></br></br>  <br>And she stopped growing at like 8</br>  <br> Years of continuous trauma and isolation can't affect your personality </br>  <br>Illya's whole appeal is that she doesn't stop being a loli.</br>  <br><br>But it certainly doesn't mean Rin would turn out remotely dominant in the Matou household. You are seriously overestimating Rin's capacity to rebel against Zouken here. That's what I take issue with.</br></br>  <br>You know through all of TM it shows that people who throw their humanity away fail at reaching the root.</br>  <br>Not for Sakura, that's the whole point of her character.</br>  <br>I always thought her appeal was being completely and totally perfect<br> Though being a loli is part of that </br></br>  <br>But he'd still do it, because what he needs is a doll , a doll who becomes the grail.</br>  <br>That's what Sakura has to make her special. Rin would just break and be Zouken's pawn since she has none of that.</br>  <br>I wasn't this anon<br>In the first place, if you have issues with that quote him. My only argument is that the worms aren't completely what shape Sakura's personality, and thinking She becomes a Luvia clone is even more retarded.</br></br>  <br>someone's gonna get bullied. This is Isshei's worst nightmare</br>  <br>you are retarded.<br>Creating a grail was never his plan.</br></br>  <br>I am not Nasu so I don't fucking know. Rin hasn't shown to be weak either and thinking she will break is as much fan fiction as the guy thinking Sakura is Luvia but raped.</br>  <br>So basically Rin wouldn't even get the purple hair.</br>  <br>Who the fuck knows.<br>It's magic</br></br>  <br>Well obviously she has to try if she wants to MAKE MONEY</br>  <br>She'll be a Saber soon enough.<br>All life will eventually be Saber.</br></br>  <br> Rin hasn't shown to be weak either and thinking she will break is as much fan fiction </br>  <br>That's all Luvia has over Rin. Luvia can't even get a sword husbando.</br>  <br>Most romantic scene in the entire anime</br>  <br>Same shit happened with Sakura at the start for 3 days straight, your point?</br>  <br>Should I remind you of the scene in Zero?</br>  Tsundere's tsun sublimates into simply becoming even hotter when they go through college, and begin losing the tsun.  I want to marry Rin. She would be a perfect wife.  <br>Did anyone get a Shoujo MC vibe from grown Shirou?</br>  <br>Rin may be crude and strong but she does not have Sakura's ridiculous ability to endure horrific conditions. She'd break after Kariya the failure chunnibyou dies in front of her. In fact, I get the feeling she wouldn't last the ten years Sakura did.</br>  <br>It's beautiful.</br>  <br>Rin's tsun is nothing special though, most of the time she was friendly.</br>  <br> She'd be Luvia-tier in smug arrogance. <br>Yeah, because one or two gag scenes in the fandisc defines her personality better than everything we've seen in the original VN.</br></br>  <br><br>Ilya rute when?</br></br>  <br>That's prisma.</br>  <br> does not have Sakura's ridiculous ability to endure horrific conditions. <br>kek.</br></br>  I wonder if Sakura could of pulled the infamous "Tohsoka smile" if she were raised with her  <br>Probably, or she might just have a different variation of her evil gloom.</br>  <br>Sakura's body had to be fucked up a lot for her to adapt to the Matou magic's "water" alignment. <br>Rin already has that atribute because she's an Average One, so she doesn't need the Matou treatment in the first place.<br>All it's left for her is to learn how to use that magic to control the worms.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin is old and busted. Luvia is the new hotness.</br>  <br>Oh God, is she dead/dying there?<br>Is this form HF?</br></br>  <br>That's a stubbed toe next to what Sakura went through every day.</br>  <br>The worms are supposed to control the host. Even Zouken says that the older sister would have been better. Sakura is just too much trouble.</br>  <br> Luvia is the new hotness. <br>More like the new fatness.</br></br>  <br>She's gonna be alright,right? Because it looks like her torso exploded. Then again, Sakura gets torn shreds by Gilgamesh and comes out of it fine and I think Shirou was scoping up his intestines at one point, The novel is pretty gory about injuries now that I think about it.</br>  We knew Rin and Luvia were hostile to each other in the original VN endings that mentioned the rival Rin had at the Clock Tower.<br><br>Either they made the rivalry fun, or they made them actually hate each other's guts like Blue and Dirty Red.</br></br>  <br> The worms are supposed to control the host. <br>No they aren't.<br>The worms work as a "crest" of sort to teach magecraft</br></br></br>  <br>That's Fate.<br><br>Yeah sure, because you know what worm rape feels like right?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and Zouken just wants someone he can control, to eventually do whatever he wants to do with the body.<br>Breaking her spirit was part of the training.</br></br>  <br>Yeah she uses her magic to repair herself somehow unlike those two who had bullshit auto repair because of circumstances.</br>    <br><br>The purpose is to train the body not the mind. The mind is a nuisance. Zouken doesn't want something that can resist him.</br></br>  <br> The worms are supposed to control the host. <br>The worms are supposed to be controlled. <br>The crest worm is the only worm that can somewhat influence the user, and that's Zouken's own addition to Sakura's body.</br></br></br>  <br>The crest worm only made Sakura horny in HF, she wasn't a mindless vessel for Zouken or anything close to that. <br>The mind control thing is part of your own headcanon.</br></br>  Rin would kill herself and Zouken if she was a Matou is plain an simple. It's how her character works, she doesn't mind dying if she takes down her enemy.  <br> The purpose is to train the body not the mind. <br>That's the whole Makiri magecraft was set up to begin with even before Zouken.<br> The mind is a nuisance. Zouken doesn't want something that can resist him. <br>Zouken's entire goal outside of HF is having Sakura have talented children that are more compatible with Matou-magecraft to win him the grail.<br> Also he's a completly nice granpa outside of the magic lessons </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She'll be a Saber soon enough. <br> All life will eventually be Saber. <br>You say that as if it were a bad thing?<br><br> Redesign <br>Seems like an original character. Or is that supposed to be currybutt?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That ahoge seems out of place.</br>  <br>Currybutt loses her original design and her hair partitions. Now Rin is even more unique, while everyone is a Saber clone. Sasuga Takeuchi.</br>  <br> That ahoge seems out of place. <br>Never paid attention to Saber designs?</br></br>  <br>But Rin is an Akiha clone</br>  <br>I was talking about the hair partition and hair design.</br>  <br>Akiha is a Saber clone now. They even have the same bust size.</br>  <br>Is Saber's ahoge an erogenous zone?</br>  <br>What? why did they upgrade her boobs?</br>  <br> That Hassan Saber </br>  <br>Nah Rin is a fusion of Akiha, Ciel and Kohaku.<br> tomboy, ojou, sensei,tsundere wearing a "mask" while having Kohaku's attitude </br></br>  <br> wearing a "mask" while having Kohaku's attitude <br>This is dumb. you're dumb.</br></br>  <br>Prisma isn't Ilya route, it's her "game". She's the MC there.</br>  <br> Prisma isn't Ilya route, it's her "game". She's the MC there. <br>Actually, given that it's implied that  Kuro is FSN-Ilya  it's not even her game but her  twin's/clone's </br></br>  <br>   Kuro is FSN-Ilya <br>Far from it. None of the Illyas in prisma are actual FSN Illya.</br></br>  F/GO release when?  <br>Two years post-UBW Rin looks like a beautiful girl her age.<br>Two years post-HF Rin looks like a grandma.<br><br>Is that the power of Emiya Shirou's dick?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Before Tsukihime remake, that's for sure :^).</br></br>  <br> Two years post-HF Rin looks like a grandma. <br>What? <br>Did you miss the gazillion times Sakura said "It's spring again"?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, without him the stress probably gets to her.</br>  <br>But the Tsuki remake is coming in 2020.</br>  <br><br>She looks fine to me.</br></br>  <br> tfw I won't read the translated remake of Tsukihime until I'm 30+ <br><br>I should just kill myself</br></br></br>  <br>Sakurafag here. <br>This makes me doubt my loyalty to mai waifu, luckily Rin will never look that good in canon.</br></br>  <br><br> not being 100% loyal to Sakura <br><br>Nigga, we've yet to see Sakura's HF design by UFO, she looked really good in the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Caring husbando that cooks <br> Spoils her <br> Watches her back against Mages <br> Makes her feel safe at night <br> Jackhammering <br> Gives her a goal besides Mage shit <br> Has something over Luvia because Shero is hers <br><br>VS<br><br> Lonely repetitive mage life tormented by OHOHOHOs <br><br>The answer is obvious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that you would consider abandoning your waifu even if she is Sakura is disgusting, but that is what Rin looks like in canon as she ages. You've seen her at the end of HF right? She's simply younger than .png you're looking at.</br>  <br>Jesus christ, they would eat Shirou alive.<br>Would it be worth the crazy sex?</br></br>  <br>Rin wouldn't need the dickworms nearly as much, since she already has the required Water element.</br>  <br> Understated, minimalist design <br> Gives off an air of power like Touko or Aoko <br> Manages to look both young and wise <br>   Jackhammers like a tiger when you get her out of that coat <br><br>I like it, definitely preferable to some generic kawaii magic girl design.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's also the fact that she'd break way quicker.</br>  <br> Lonely repetitive mage life tormented by OHOHOHOs <br><br>not<br><br> getting to be the best possible you alongside your well endowed rival/  friend<br/> <br> recreating the Gem Sword and the Second Magic  <br> getting a place among the top 100 magi in history <br> knowing your imouto is safe and sound and not being raped or filled by old worms anymore <br> occasional mana transfer with Rider <br> endless hatesex sessions with Luvia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura cried for 3 days. Also getting raped is not something to be joyous about.</br>  <br>Sakura broke on the first hours too, read Zero, filthy wormfag.</br>  <br>The top one is still better.<br><br> knowing your imouto is safe and sound and not being raped or filled by old worms anymore <br>Doesn't apply as this is only known in HF.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought you were comparing Rin's end in UBW vs. HF</br>  <br>I think his point was that Tohsaka doesn't know about worms in UBW.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about UBW</br>  <br>I was being more broad also <br> recreating the Gem Sword and the Second Magic  <br> getting a place among the top 100 magi in history <br>I don't think she gives much of a fuck about this.<br> endless hatesex sessions with Luvia <br>Already happens.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally trash tier.</br></br>  <br>As a VS it doesn't work because UBW Rin doesn't know of it so it's not like its hunting her.</br>  Daily reminder that ilyashit is a no route cancer shit.  <br>What?</br>  She's going to be in the HF epilogue.  Taiga will be married and there will be baby.    the HF epilogue will show Rin's bald, fat, wealthy husband she was forced to marry because the line must go on <br> Shirou won't care <br> mfw waifufags' response by then </br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that taboo origin is suffering.</br>  <br>With all the time constrains she might make a 3 second appearance.</br>  <br>I'll could see everything but, Taiga getting married. She's a wandering cloud.</br>  <br>No it won't, stay mad.</br>  <br> MTSP doujins confirmed canon </br>  <br> trying to pit Sakura and Rin fags against each other <br>Come out, Sabershit.</br></br>  <br>Come on, it would be fun.</br>  <br> Sakurafags </br>  <br>  &gt;there will be baby  <br> this is enough for me</br></br>  <br>It's True end not Normal.</br>  <br> Taiga will never take a trip to London and reunite with her childhood husbando. </br>  <br><br>Sister alliance stronk, a shame everybody forgot about shortly after the UBW/HF revelation.</br></br>  <br>I don't think you understand the definition of childhood.</br>  <br> childhood <br>She's well past that age</br></br>  <br>You mean everyone went full shitposting after that.</br>  That beach doujin by Shiwasu has Taiga look alike. I don't particularly like Taiga, but I had a good fap.  Do people actually like sakura, or is it just a meme to piss off rinfags/saberfags? <br><br>I can understand not liking rin/saber, but i cannot for the fucking life of me understand why anyone would like sakura. She's just so fucking uninteresting.</br></br>  <br>Below the age of 18? Although:<br><br><br>Apparently I'm wrong on that. She's in a HS uniform so I figured she was still a teenager during the 4th War.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A wall has more character than Saber.</br>  <br><br> uninteresting. <br><br>For you.<br><br>If anything, I find Saber the most boring one. Skipped a lot of her scenes in F/HA.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger she can do magic and she's with a living armory who's made it his mission in life to become a superhero. They play off each other well and there's still a lot of dangerous shit out there they need to deal with. I don't know how much better of a premise you need.</br>  <br>The fact that Sakura still has her purple hair and eyes while the worms didn't change Rin's apperace at all triggers my autism.</br>  <br>It's obvious some truly like her.</br>  <br>This is lewd.</br>  <br>Your autism triggers mine.</br>  <br> adult Ilya  <br> implying her body won't fall apart in a year at most </br></br>  <br>Purple Rin</br>  <br>So does Shirou still have PTSD?</br>  <br> i cannot for the fucking life of me understand why anyone would like sakura. <br>There's this thing called taste, and Sakura does not suit your taste. Now, imagine someone who likes the things about Sakura that disinterest you. Perspective is a wonderful thing.<br><br>After the UBW finale I'm really excited to see HF.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think you're looking at it wrong, Sakura is the one with black hair. Remember she uses her hair in two ponytails when she's a kid too.</br></br>  <br>He has survivor's guilt.</br>  <br>Except it's explicitly stated that he doesn't.</br>  <br>Was this line in the original VN? Because I'm pretty sure Shirou has smiled before in his character sprite.</br>  <br>That's denial it's common.</br>  <br>And in other instances it does</br>  <br> Falseflagging Saberfags, the nicest fanbase in Fate <br><br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just how he rationalizes it. <br>The diagnosis still stands despite what he has to say on the matter.</br></br>  What would happen if Shirou met pic related?  <br>Overrated shit.</br>  <br><br>You guys are retards, that guy was an Illyashitter.</br></br>  <br>He kind of was that for all of F/SN.<br>If the viewpoint was from Rin's eyes the whole time, Shirou would be this mysterious, dark-past Shoujo crush who slowly grows to love her over time.</br></br>  <br>Thanks Takeuchi!</br>  <br>Fate route. Kotomine shows up and beats the ever loving shit out of Rin for Shirou and Saber to find when they come home.</br>  <br> streaming </br>  <br>Not only does he kill Tokiomi but he also kills RIn in Fate? fuck Kirei and his chuuni bullshit.</br>  <br>He wasn't wrong.</br>  <br>She doesn't die. In fact, Rin passes on the Azoth Dagger to Shirou.<br>Shirou then confronts Kotomine and stabs it into his chest.<br>What comes around, goes around.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, only route Rin dies.<br><br>This is bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br> Rin <br> Dying </br></br>  <br>Maybe he wasn't any of the above and just a shitposter.</br>  <br>Sure is.</br>  <br>Well design wise he wasn't until the timeskip. So you don't really think he is one until the timeskip happens and it hits you.</br>    <br> luckily Rin will never look that good in canon. <br><br>That's from the Heaven's Feel epilogue</br></br></br>  <br> hating the best fate </br>  <br>No that's concept art.</br>  <br>He is only good in Zero and in the last parts of HF.</br>  <br>Bless UFO for they have made her better.</br>  <br>It's a slight stylistic change produced by an amateur. Are you saying that that sprite and the pic above are drastically different?</br>  <br>I always found it silly how Kotomine got killed by Shirou in this scene when he's a master at Bajiquan or whatever and destroyed servant Shirou in HF.</br>  <br>Her clothes are completly different<br><br>Yeah Ufo!Rin looks more her age.<br>The concept art is more late 20s early 30s</br></br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't expecting the sword, he probably just expected Shirou to try and punch him.<br>As I recall, his last look was one of incredible surprise.</br></br>  <br>Fujoshit pls</br>  <br>Same here it felt really off when you read HF and Kotomine can take on assassin but not a high school boy. People like to complain that is Fate being wrong but it's the opposite as HF came later.</br>  <br>I think this might be the best Rin we've ever seen.</br>  <br>Man her eyes still just look off to me.</br>  <br><br>This could've been if it wasn't for shitty parents and fire.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't really matter what Shirou or Archer says, because they both have all the symptoms of survivor's guilt:<br><br> Perception that they did something 'wrong' by simply surviving a traumatic event where others did not <br> Inability to move on from the event that caused the PTSD <br> Fixation on the deaths of those around them, in particular other children their age <br> Repeated nightmares and mental images of the horrors witnessed <br> Low self-worth and and a desire to place others before them <br> A compulsion with 'making up' for being the sole survivor by giving back to others with little concern for the self <br> etc. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love you, anon.</br>  <br>He didn't exactly take on Assassin</br>  <br>This. He probably just wasn't expecting Shirou to be able to do anything to him and let him have a free hit.</br>   hating on Kirei <br>God I hate summer.</br>  <br>He fought defensively against him, it's still pretty huge for a guy who can't beat a high school kid.</br>  <br>Shit, how accurate is all that? <br>I think you just diagnosed me with survivors guilt</br></br>  <br>Kriei has always been a mixed bag on /a/. His fans are overbearing and obnoxious at times. He has never been universally liked.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm okay with Kotomine, but I just can't stand his fans.</br>  <br>Not asking you to blog, but what traumatic event did you survive at the expense of others?</br>  <br>She looks like an AraAra Oneesan, just perfect.</br>  <br> His fans are overbearing and obnoxious at times. <br>Prime example<br>No one can question their husbando.</br></br></br>  <br>I think she was talking about a real smile rather than just bending your mouth into the shape of a smile.</br>  That was the most boring episode, go to watch some harry potter    <br> Hatsuyuki <br>For what purpose?</br></br>  <br> this is totally a good comparison  <br><br>Are you shitting me?</br></br></br>  <br> Yer a magus, Shirou! </br>  <br>It's a decent one.</br>  <br>I grew to like her over time.</br>   harry potter fucked rin while she was at the clock tower   <br>Her eyes still look awful</br>  <br> the character Shirou recognized was Harry <br>It all makes sense now</br></br>  <br><br> Implying Saberfags want anything to do with waifuwars. <br>FUCK OFF</br></br></br>  <br> HF movie gets canned for this 25 episode series <br><br>How do you feel anons?</br></br></br>  <br>Ufotable staying true to Tohsayylamo till the bitter end</br>  <br>This. There's no need to engage in petty contests.</br>  <br>Shirou is the swole man</br>  <br>It would be  good </br>  <br>Better than HF.</br>  <br>That pic has inspired me. Maybe if I looked like him, I could get my own rin.</br>  <br>So reverse digimon tri situation?<br>I would probably be happy for the new content, even in the presume drop of quality.</br></br>  <br> Rin existing in the 3rd dimension <br>Surely you jest</br></br>  <br><br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't exist.</br>  <br> wanting 25 episodes of shitty fan fiction <br>I'll be fine without that.</br></br>  <br>Only if it has a shitload of Luvia.</br>  <br>You know this is an anime right?</br>  <br><br><br> autists </br></br></br>  <br> liking their waifu drawn like an alien </br>  <br>Not him but I honestly can't see anything wrong with her eyes. That stupid ayy meme should stay on whatever board it spawned from regardless.</br>  <br>I'm not seeing whatever you're seeing.</br>  <br>Anime characters in general look like aliens dude.</br>  <br><br>Why would Touko be in the HF epilogue?</br></br>  <br>Because of Shirou's body even though they never actually meet her.</br>  <br> UBW 2: Electric Boogaloo <br> Featuring Shirou/Rin/Luvia/Waver and his mercury blob  <br> Dismantling the grail and saving Sakura in the meantime <br> Huge magical battles because of Magic Association fucks wanting to keep the grail running + Zouken <br> Probably featuring Caren as a church overseer too <br><br>That shit makes such an easy movie the only thing holding it back is likely Nasu writing jack shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I really wish Prisma was the "what-if Illya wished the world remade so she could be with her onii-chan" world.<br><br>It isn't, because it quickly turns into yuri-shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can also add in Flats and Gray and damn that would be interesting.</br>  <br>My problem with prisma is how different Illya is there, like what's the point?</br>    <br><br>Rin Toe-sucka indeed.</br></br>  Reminder that Saber a best. <br> Gawain that is. </br>  <br>You sure? I am pretty sure that it is actually a live action documentary.</br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>   bump   <br>UBWfags got everything with this adaptation.<br><br>Fuck this, I thought Nasu was all about being fair. All I will get is some shitty HF movie that will based on RN.<br><br>Fuck it I am mad.</br></br></br></br></br>  Rin best! Everyone buttmad now!  <br>Nasu likes to allude to "normal mages" and "mage lifestyle", but he doesn't really like to write about them. All of his stories are about unusual or extraordinary occurrences that stand out even compared to his world of magic and shit. He leaves all the "normal" stuff to other writers.</br>  <br> ! <br>Rinfags everyone</br></br>  <br>HF will be better as a movie than a TV adaptation. You should be happy.</br>  <br>At least you aren't a Fatefag like me. All I have is DEEN.</br>  <br> Implying that flat waif is an Adult Illya </br>  <br>I dunno. Judging by the VN version of HF, its gonna be an hour forty of cooking, ten of actual good stuff and then the outtro.</br>  <br> 90-120 minute butchered adaptation <br> better <br>no</br></br></br>  <br> implying Ilya can even survive to be an adult </br>  <br>Better than a butchered piece of shit.</br>  <br>As a Saberfag, DEEN's adaption was pretty good since they hit most of the points of the route  except they fucked up the basement scene lel .</br>  <br>Magic means that miracles are possible. Not easy, or likely, but possible. There's no fate that's absolute.</br>  <br>Even when aiming for cheap shots at the stomach and head, Rin still loses to Luvia.<br><br>Why is Luvia so Based?</br></br></br>  <br>The entire point of making it a movie is that they can remove all the filler in the beginning and middle of the route.<br><br><br>That's all the time you need to cover the parts of HF that people care about. It should be good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They can't remove the filler since most of the filler is exposition/info dumps and developing Shirou and Sakura's (limited) relationship. It's going to be another UBW with cool fights and that's it.</br>  <br> Wanting extra fat <br>I love Rin she is perfectly trimmed to the level I prefer especially with those thighs.</br></br>  If everyone was given at birth a cup to catch all of the good thing that will happen to them in life, Sakura's cup would have had the bottom forcibly cut out and then someone else's cup placed over so she'd have to hope that whatever little bit spills over in to her cup doesn't fall through the bottom.  <br>I find that very hard to swallow. You need to flesh out Sakura, if you don't she will come out worse than before. Imagine the secondary hate on her, I won't be able to handle it.</br>  <br><br>what the fuck am I reading</br></br>  <br>Then Rin comes to take the one drop that clings to the side of her glass. Then smashes te cup afterwards.</br>  <br><br>It's just going to be Saber's Feel guest starring Sakura</br></br>  <br><br> Saber's Feel </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Maybe you're not getting me because you just outright disagree with what I'm saying but all anyone ever cares or talks about in HF are the brief twists at the beginning of the route and the battles towards the end of the route. Those can be adapted just fine with a movie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Rin such a fucking cunt? Sakura is suffering while her sister fucks the only man she wanted.</br>  <br> That's all the time you need <br>That's all the time you need if you want to make a terrible rushed film.</br></br>  <br>Why don't they just share the cup?</br>   yfw HF is just two hours of Kotomine eating mabo tofu   <br>So you just want pretty animation and colors not the story?</br>  <br>A story of a misfortunate girl with a broken cup.</br>  <br><br>He wants UBW 2.0</br></br>  <br>That would be better than watching it get butchered.</br>  <br>What I mentioned is the story.</br>  <br>All of that can't be adapted unless it's rushed.</br>  <br>Rin's cup would actually e a 30 gallon drum, and Shirou's would've melted in the fire.</br>  Waver and Taiga are both virgins right?  <br>Are you implying Rin had an easy life?</br>  <br>Waver fucks all of his students including Rin.</br>  Rin is inferior to Luvia and even she knows it.  <br>Well, there is always the chance they'll do multiple movies. They can cut back on the cooking and Sakura's bed time or more in the fact that they need to. I think it will be fine in the end. Better then the UBW movie at least. Not saying much I know.</br>  <br>So you want another DEEN UBW.</br>  <br>At least comparatively to the other heroines.</br>  <br>Are you implying she didn't?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>More like she doesn't want some slut to get all friendly with her husbando.</br>  <br>That's clearly a look of disgust though, not anger.</br>  <br>Young adult Rin  PLEASES EVEN OLDER MEN FOR MONEY </br>  <br><br>She didn't have an easy life. She knows how to handle it and doesn't cry about it.</br></br>  <br>Well she is being all clingy to a guy that is taken.</br>  <br><br>Will those two ever hate fuck each other?</br></br>  Is there any type moon anime adaptions I should completely avoid? I plan to watch everything that has been adapted so far.  <br><br>DEEN's anime and movie.</br></br>  So I've watched F/0, where do I go from here, assuming I only want to watch the anime.  <br>Have you read everything already?</br>  <br> He leaves all the "normal" stuff to other writers. <br><br>Who have no examples to go by and thus just write their own super special unusual or extraordinary Magi. And, I mean, of course they do, because "hurr special" tends to be more exciting and fun to write than "typical."<br><br>The only person who ever did this justice was Urobuchi, really, who goes out of his way with Waver. By the time Nasu picks him back up, he's not a "normal" Mage at all, he's kind of a big deal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DEEN Fate and UBW Movie.</br>  <br>UBW TV. Afterwards you can watch Fate DEEN and laugh.</br>  <br>Only the Fate VN, I will get round to the others though.<br><br><br><br>Already watched DEEN but was smart enough to avoid the film, thank you both.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The UBW movie is good for a laugh though. It's only an hour and a half long. Not exactly a major investment.</br>  <br>Well yeah after he watches everything else first.</br>  <br>Which one is DEEN? I need the viewing order explained to me like I'm an idiot. I just watched F/0 not knowing there was so much more in the setting</br>  <br>DEEN Fate is worth watching if you really want to see more of Fate/Stay Night animated.</br>  <br> Which one is DEEN? <br>The 2006 adaptation.</br></br>  <br> Shirou runs to Kotomine and he doesn't defend <br>What in the fucks?</br></br>  <br>After only rereading UBW/HF and watching F/Z. This Kotomine doesn't make any sense.</br>  <br>So Fate/SN is the 2006 adaptation by DEEN<br>UBW is a later adaptation by Ufotable that follows a different route.<br>And F/0 is a prequel to both of them before they diverged?<br><br>Where does the UBW movie fit in?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He was just surprised that Shirou perfectly projected Avalon and activated it after bathing in Grail Mud. Also,  DEEN Saber vs Berserker was better than ufotables </br></br>  <br>In 2010 and it's also made by DEEN.</br>  <br>It fits neatly into the trash</br>  <br>I wouldn't say it was better. Equal maybe. The first 15 or so minutes of the movie are genuinely solid.</br>  <br>I'd forgotten DEEN could make stuff that looks that good. It's mildly hilarious that the F/SN adaptation we've derided forever was often better looking than anything they've put out in years.</br>  <br>I don't think it was better but it wasn't bad and it was still a movie so I'll subtract from them on that. Even if Kotomine was surprised his response was beyond slow.</br>  What a wonderful time to be alive  <br>To be fair, that is from the movie, and they basically blew their load on a total of two scenes: the Berserker fight, and the Archer fight.</br>  <br>We are in the Era of Rin.</br>  <br>Look at all those raining dolphins.</br>  <br>You said it.</br>  <br>Indeed</br>  <br>I thought Rhinos were an endangered species.</br>  <br>This looked better when I watched it back then.</br>  <br>Berserkerstep &gt; the music they used for that scene</br>  <br>Someone post the Lancer&amp;Archer fight, and Shirou&amp;Gil fight.</br>  <br>The era is over. It's Sakura's reign now.</br>  <br>Lancer vs Archer<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ba8<wbr>M7nyhVJQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Sakura's too busy with fish to have an era.</br>    <br>So were the apples suppose to be worms or bunnies?</br>    <br>They are such a perfect couple.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I am envious.</br>  <br>Why? Rin and Shirou are happy and that's all that matters. Don't let pesky things like reality get in the way of your thoughts!</br>  <br><br> That mecha <br><br>Queen of Braves GaoSeiBah?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It won't have as good an epilogue</br>  <br>The more I like a character the less I can self insert.

It's teaching tricks for quicker mental math.<br><br>But I don't know what they were thinking when they wrote the 17 - 4 step as "17 = 4 + 13" instead of "17 - 4 = 13". It's so much less intuitive that way. The whole thing is just poorly written.</br></br></br>  <br>That looks nothing like this .

I just went for the most straightforward, "easy" answer but its hard to really know what she wants. But Yukino is the type to reach her hand out an ideal <br><br>Yuki is rationalizing the irrational and she never really has been in touch with her emotions until genuine speech I think. Even with Yui there was always a wall between them; I think Vol 12 Yuki is going to fully open up and she will act on her feelings and desires on her own accord which is the start of her necessary growth.<br><br>I think people tend to over exaggerate her problems and think we need volumes of material that her going into therapy and then doing something to redeem Hachiman and Yui for helping her. She just needs to act based on her own heart and desires more than anything. <br><br>As an aside, Yukino has 3 main animal affinities/symbolism in the novels: cats, bears, and believe it or not, fish. Cats eats fish, bears (Hachiman wants to be a bear rmbr) eat fish, and guess which character has fish eyes<br><br>The motto of the club based on ep 1/vol 1 was Teach someone how to Fish. The club was going to aid others with their problems but in a way so that they can do it themselves (be independent). The funny thing that happened is that in the end, its Yukino who needs the service club the most in finding her own path in life. She alludes to this greatly when talking to 8man about that fish during the aquarium date</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br> buy smartphone <br> doesn't work <br> passtime is shopping with random men <br>Rich slut</br></br></br></br>  <br>A shame Feel didn't animate Yukino hugging Yui's cushions and laughing at what Hachiman said about pasta at Yui's place. Feel really did dramatize Yukino's problems too much, though now that I've read up to chapter 8.</br>  <br>Translate for us?</br>  The whole scene with Yui at the end is gut wrenching.

I want to see how Hachiman reacts to that.  On a scale of Taishi to Komachi, how close is Iroha to Hachiman?  What would 8man have to say to seduce either Yukino or Yui?  <br> Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball, wondering if senpai would like her scent and the color <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br> Wakes up at 4 to prepare herself for the date <br> She stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue <br> She is late to the date because she didn't get the train and preferred to save the money for the stylish cafe </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He can literally do anything to them and they would let him</br>  Actually establishing that Iroha is poor would make her more interesting to me. Probably not enough to move her past Yukino and Yui, but it give her more depth than "girl who constantly lies in order to get closer to Hachiman".<br><br>Doesn't the school have a tuition?

He gets all flustered every time she closes the gap and starts rubbing all over him.</br></br>  <br>How do you just namedrop designers like that?</br>  <br>There are far more indicators that she comes from a poor family.

Her parents probably both work overtime all the time just to be able to keep her in school, just like 8man's parents do. They'd probably get along pretty well.<br><br>On the topic, Ghamama seems to be a housewife so Gahadad must have a very good job.<br><br>And we all know the Yukinoshitas are made of money.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never knew the club had a motto/slogan?

And while at the start she was struggling, after the Christmas event she became more of a leader to the rest of the stuco. 8man comments on this in the LNs and it was all with his help.</br>  <br>She WANTS IT BAD</br>  <br>She wants the threesome end?</br>  <br>I think she wouldn't. He is like the only friend she has.</br>  <br><br>FUCK, EVEN EBINA WANTS THE YAHALLOS.</br></br>  <br>Does Yui think that Yukino wouldn't be her friend anymore if Yui got 8man or vice versa?</br>  <br>Now that's beauty.</br>  <br> memorandum <br>What's the memorandum thing? the mini chapters about No Longer Human?</br></br>  <br><br>Her diary is hard to parse. What she says reads more like she's clinging to a specific interpretation of 'genuine', more so than the concept itself.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes, but of all endings, a Yui end seems the most likely for her to share 8man with Yukino.<br><br>Because Yui is a freak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What does it say?</br>  <br>How much work does ahe do herself? From what I've seen, she mostly bosses others around to do everything for her, except when it comes to flirting with boys.</br>  <br>Why do you think? Come on, you can do it.</br>  <br>I think Yukino could share, it isn't as if she has a nasty jealous streak.<br><br><br>What do you think her interpretation of genuine is? Blunt honesty? Maybe it is the same as 8man's.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm a cocktease troll, also don't forget to buy the LN, VN and BDs! </br>  <br>her character has grown on me from worst to best. <br><br>The main reason is that she's not as over dramatic as all the other people and she seems to be the most entertaining to be around. <br><br>With all the moping the other girls do (except little sister and older lady), I can't even see them enjoying a date without the baggage causing a scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The funny part is that she doesn't even go to the soccer club anymore (because "it's winter and it's cold"). She spends all her free time at the Service Club.</br>  <br> I think Yukino could share, it isn't as if she has a nasty jealous streak. <br><br>If it's Ice-queen Yukino no, if it's rehabilitated Moe-blob Yukino maybe.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think Yui believes Hachiman likes Yukino. The infirmary scene seems to have solidified that in her mind. We know that the truth is a lot more muddled, but she doesn't.<br><br>A lot of her behavior has to be understood in the context of that. She doesn't think she's going to get Hachiman's affections. Her willing to attempt to sink her own ship may be driven by that conviction.<br><br>If she thought 8man liked her more, she might be less focused on getting Yukino to confess her own feelings and more on trying to get Yukino to accommodate losing somehow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's Yui's definition of genuine? Does it ever specify what it is exactly?  <br>During the christmas event she wasnt even able to boss them around and they didn't really trust her, being younger and all. She's come a long way.</br>  <br> Even so, these are just a token of my gratitude <br><br>What is his reaction when Yui said that in the LN?<br>He looked unhappy in the anime when she said it was just to thank him.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> "C-Could you stop looking around my room so much...?" <br> "Huh? Oh, no, it's just there was some kind of fried spaghetti thing, see?" <br> "That's a room freshener..." <br> Hoh, so it's something like perfume for the room... Basically, it sucks some kind of perfume product and fans it out, not that I'd know. Heh, so girls have all kinds of stuff in their room, huh? I sat there impressed and I noticed the shaking of someone's shoulders at the corner of my eyes. <br> "Fried spaghetti..." <br> Upon looking, Yukinoshita was trembling with her face buried in her cushion. Come on, is that really something to laugh about...? As usual, she finds humor in the strangest things... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how 8man not sinking her ship makes her really feel. There will be more ambiguity to her feelings, which might hurt more since she might hope. <br><br><br>From what I understand the cookies really touched him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, but she still doesn't do anything or very little herself. Even getting the others of the StuCo committee to listen to her/take her seriously, was something Hachiman (and to a lesser extent Yukino and Yui) had to do for her.</br>  <br><br>  What do you think her interpretation of genuine is? <br><br>I don't really know. She doesn't clarify and it's hard to guess at it.<br><br>Another way of looking at is that Spyro was clunky in translating those last few lines. Thus<br>  Even so, there is something like an answer for us, so I decided to vaguely think of it as the right one. <br>  I don’t mean that half-heartedly, because I’m thinking of it as a prerequisite for the answer that should coincide with all our interests. <br>  I want to believe that is genuine. <br><br>The "I want to believe that is genuine" may be indicating that "genuine" is the answer she was talking about a few sentences before. In that case it would have been more clear if Spyro had written it as:<br>  I want to believe that answer is "genuine". <br><br>In other words, is the answer literally 'genuine' or is she hoping that the answer to her long train of rambling that all seems to be about defining 'genuine' is the right one?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cute, thanks anon</br>  <br>She did the whole magazine thing herself except for the actual writing which was done by 8man.<br><br>And it's not like the YY girls don't leave everything in 8man's hands as well.</br></br></br>  <br>What is it with snow girls and laughing at random shit</br>  <br>Talking Yukino into 3P is simple. Just frame it as a competition.</br>  <br>Not really, they respected 8man because he did all the shit. But after genuine and confession, she grew stronger and got their respect. When she asked to the vice about rejecting Tamanawa's brainstorming and he replied about not doong so, the old Iroha would have answered yes to his senior, but the new Iroha listened to him and decided on her own to reject jazz hands ideas and make a parallel event</br>  <br>That guy has been evading her date for months,<br>of course she won't believe that 8man may have any feeling for her.<br><br>Poor Yui will never learn that 8man get jealous too when guys are hitting on her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does Yukino know? Because most of his jealousy momnets are internal monologues. Like all his nauseated thoughts when thinking about Yuki and Hayama</br>  <br>Snow girls have no character otherwise so they gain a shoehorned trait that is otherwise uncharacteristic of them.</br>  <br>Stop.<br>Fuck, she needs to win.</br></br>  <br>True but I feel like outside the end of volume 9 we never got to see much more of that. Since then it's just been 24/7 sly kouhai.</br>  <br>Yuru Yui also comes to mind.</br>  <br>Yukino probably hopes 8man cares about her enough to be jealous of Hayama but she doesn't actually know</br>  <br> Does Yukino know </br>  <br> He looked unhappy in the anime when she said it was just to thank him. <br><br>Maybe he hoped the cookies meant more than just "thank you"</br></br></br>  <br>Divine beauty in fact.</br>  <br><br>That's a good question about what Yukino thinks of Hachiman's affections.<br><br>My gut feeling is that she's either totally oblivious or she thinks he likes her too because she reads their key moments together as being as significant to him as they are to her.<br><br>She also seemed unaware of Yui's affections for a long time. She seems to know by vol 11 though. I wonder if she knew it before vol 11 or if at some point during vol 11 she learns it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably knew that Yui wasn't telling the complete truth there and it triggered his genuine sensor</br>  <br><br>It's an endearing trait.</br></br>  <br>They only talked about the date in Disneyland, it's only been some weeks since then</br>  <br>He promised to take her out for sharing her honey toast during the festival, that's gotta be months at least.</br>  <br><br>He definitely saw through what she was doing. He knows about her romantic feelings and exactly why those cookies were given to him.<br><br>He got pissed when he spotted her attempting to put the batsuit on. That's doesn't necessarily mean he shares her affections, or maybe it does. We'll have to find out later.<br><br>What bothered him most though was her deceit. Her being dishonest about herself. That's what he's communicating to her in his speech. He wants her to be genuine, even if you have to agonize and struggle in doing so. The possibility of heartbreak for her is implicitly left open, but not confirmed either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  And then he went on a date with another girl, who happens to be the best girl.  I want to  playfully tease  moeblob Yukino  <br>Yukino found out during the sleepover most likely. <br> right before the sleep over <br>She tries to get Yui to stay so she can give her treats to 8man<br> the day after it <br>She tries to leave once she knows it is a date with 8man out of consideration, leaves Yui with 8man and the penguins, gets sad when she reads the penguin sign, and shakes her head when she wants to give him treats again while Yui was giving him cookies.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They were taking before about how if she returns the gratitude with a present hell have to return that one in turn and it would never end. She didn't mind, but he probably thinks it would hurt his wallet.</br>  <br>She's the second most rotten person in the world. She's 8man fem-version, damn it.<br><br>And more, she's drama free because she's not in the love triangle, so she can be (almost) full honest with 8man, so there's that too.<br><br>Kinda sad that 8man holds little to no special feelings for her whatsoever, except for big brother feelings.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Poor Yui will never learn that 8man get jealous too when guys are hitting on her. <br>I wonder how Yui would feel if she found out 8man gets jealous of other guys being around her or doesn't want her in any strange social situations.<br><br>I wonder if Yukino would be happy if she found out her got jelly over her too.</br></br></br></br>  Remove Haruno<br> Remove Haruno </br>  <br> She's 8man fem-version <br>In what way?</br></br>  <br>We literally just got to see a great deal of her ability in 10.5 and 11.<br><br>Yukino even compliments her by saying she's surprisingly capable, even calling the other school into the chocolate-making event to reduce costs.<br><br>Iroha's actually undergone an enormous amount of growth since her introduction, whereas Yukino and Yui have arguably regressed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to  kill  moeblob Yukino</br>  <br>Yukino probably didn't actually have the cookies in her bag, and just clutched at it reflexively from being reminded of them. Shaking her head was probably still a sort of "no I won't try to do that too, not right now" response though.</br>  <br>Heh thats how honey toast date started in the first place<br><br>Probably ~4/5 months</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well she had the cookies in her bag that day at school, then went straight to Yui's without going home.<br><br>Unless she left the cookies at school they're probably still in her bag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Having to actually face tough shit and being afraid isn't "character regression"</br>  <br><br>  She's 8man fem-version <br><br>I think that's Haruno.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean Qualidea's main girl?</br>  <br>Being completely dependent on 8man for literally everything is regression.<br><br>It's not just Yukino who has a dependency issue, Yui has it too. That's why she needed to goad a genuine speech out of 8man instead of just giving one herself.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to marry yukiblob</br>  <br> mfw Haruno is as interested about genuine as everyone else and is searching internally and externally for it because it matters to her </br>  I came into this thread just to have you guys' opinions on this, my friend suggested it to me the other day and I hadn't seen it discussed before:<br><br>What do you guys think the odds are of the source of Hayama and Yukinon's interactions is that they're being forced/coerced into a relationship/possibly marriage by their families?<br><br>The more I thought about it the more it seemed to line up. We don't know why the rumor started that Yukino and Hayama were dating beyond the fact that they were seen together. We don't know what they did and Yukino never elaborates (I will admit that this may be in reference to when Hayama was with Yukino's family for dinner).<br><br>Hayama and Yukino's families have known each other since they were both very young and they grew up together, Since Yukino's family is so rich it's safe to assume Hayama's is as well. Yukimom is always seen in a yukata and their being rich means they have enough leisure time to still actively pursue traditional Japanese things and probably still have a very conservative sense of how young people should marry/be in relationships. That much seemed to be confirmed when Yukimom confronts Yukino outside her apartment.<br><br>So what are the odds here? Is this a total shot in the dark? Have you guys discussed it before? It was just something I hadn't thought of and it's been spinning in my head ever since</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you were 8man would you extend the situation as long as you can so you can hang out with all those cute girls or would you bite and get together with one and leave the others alone?  <br>Samefag here. This would also explain why Yukimom says she's afraid Yukino will "choose the wrong path". Haruno knows about Yukino's feelings for 8man and likely told Yukimom. This is why Yukino is so hesitant to confess her feelings. She wants to avoid the conflict of going against her family's plans.</br>  <br>And she did all of that....<br><br>Just for the Club's photo.</br></br></br>  <br> Yukino even compliments her by saying she's surprisingly capable, even calling the other school into the chocolate-making event to reduce costs. <br>So once again, letting others do shit for her and also to ensure that she doesn't have to pay from her own pocket. How admirable.</br></br>  So was this really the end? Watari ended it here? No epilogue or nothing? He really blueballed us didn't he  <br>She does talk about how the guys her age are superficial and never question her while 8man can look behind her good girl façade</br>  <br><br>If I were 8man<br><br>Considering Yui and Yukino, I'd probably just keep with the situation, occasionally tearing up and muttering about genuine to keep the ship rolling and their panties melting.<br><br>Once I settle on a girl I'll pick her and then when it looks like the other girl is drifting away I'll just cry about genuine one last time to bring her back in the fold.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's been a theory for a while now, and it's mentioned in more detail in Vol. 10 of the novel (covered by episodes 10 and 11 from S2, albeit in rushed fashion). Basically Yukino explains to 8man that yes, her family wishes to maintain a close relationship with Hayama's family, but it doesn't necessarily have to be through marriage. One alternative is through a career, and that's why Yukimom is all up in her business about her class choices.</br>   2 knock outs like him <br> one is a 11/10 gorgeous long haired beauty <br> the other is a 9/10 cutie but with a 11/10 body <br>What is the problem? Why do people think he is suffering?</br></br></br>  <br> what is a still ongoing LN series </br>  <br> who the hell does she think she is, using her leadership position to lead people like that? </br>   Yukino end get <br><br>Now the wait for S3 in 2 years.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>I knew there was no way it wasn't a theory by now, it seemed way too obvious after I thought about it. I'm interested to see how it plays out.</br>  <br>Because he's a raging retard who won't accept either</br>  <br>I don't think it's something like an arranged marriage, but Yukimom would probably be very pleased if they do get together and probably voices it all the time.<br><br>Hayama's dad is a lawyer and Hayama saying he's not allowed to choose meas he's set to become a lawyer too, which would work perfectly to succeed Yukidad as a politician.</br></br></br>  <br> but not doing a single thing herself, Sagami2.0 </br>  <br><br>She might still think Hachiman is in love with Yukino exclusively.<br><br>He acted the way she expected to prevent Yui from pressuring Yukino to give up. From her point of view he might have done what he did because he prefers Yukino and doesn't want to lose the chance with her. In her thought processes her expectation of him intervening may have been tied to that conviction of him liking Yukino.<br><br>If she failed to pick up on him seeing completely through her plan, that is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Delegation is considered high level work.<br>Why do you think manager get paid more compare to grunt work?</br></br>  <br> sagami <br> leading </br></br>  <br>Because both of them are crazy and they are best friends, ensuring there is no way out of this without at least one broken heart.</br>  <br><br>Do I need to cry about genuine to you too? I'll do it you know. I'll cry as many times as I need to.</br></br>  <br>Well, so are the other two.</br>  <br>Actually, i'll admit that regression isn't wrong, but your use if it was. They have moved backwards as people, but only temporarily and as part of a longer forward advancement they've been going through for at least 5 volumes now. Using it to imply they're worse characters simply because your waifu has only ever moved forward is completely disingenuous.</br>  is 8man suppose to be the nips holden caulfield?   mfw I like all girls    specially Iroha   <br>I don't really mind who wins in the end as long as it's well written. Yukino has more chances to win right now.</br>  <br>Had Hachiman held her hand throughout the process as much as he did for Iroha and considering all Iroha does is boss others around, yes, Sagami would have been effective, however since Sagami is a ginormous cunt an not a sly manipulative girl like Iroha, people wouldn't put up with her shit for long.</br>  <br>Why are they both crying?</br>  <br>There's a difference between leading others to do stuff and doing nothing and letting them decide what to do.</br>  <br>Truck-kun came to reap Yui.</br>  <br>I would probably end the situation as soon as possible and not pick either. I would quit the club ASAP and tell them I found genuine so there is no reason to show up anymore. I would focus on my studies and taking it easy for the rest of my time.</br>  <br>Sorry, I sounded badly.<br><br>This anon is more right <br>, but I meant that they were both kinda the same type of person (when they first met), they even had lots o things in common (exemple householding).</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not asian</br>  <br>Goddammit, why did it have to be the fat old men?</br>  <br>Tell my why not?</br>  <br>That artist in particular loves drawing faceless old men. His girls are cute though.</br>  So many words. So much ambiguity. I don't understand what the fuck is going on.<br><br>Can someone explain in layman's terms what the fuck happened during that final scene with the cookies.</br></br>  <br>It's not worth figuring out. Even when you get it, you would be like "THAT'S what the fuss was about? So fucking stupid"</br>  <br>The one who was fem 8man at the beginning was Yukino, until they both realize exactly just how different they truly are.<br>Don't know what you mean by householding though.</br></br>  <br>At least they came to pay their respects.</br>  <br>How can you tell?</br>  <br><br>8man and Yukino were (and still are) alike in their circumstances in the beginning. I mean both are loners and 'monsters of logic'.<br><br>But even from the beginning they were different in their ideals and their way of going about dealing with things.<br><br>That being said, comparing Iroha to 8man is silly. Iroha has some insight into the Hachi-mind, but she was never and is nothing like him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait for when it's Goro.</br>  <br>Which is a crying goddamned shame.<br><br> Dem fangs need to fuckin' go though </br></br></br>  <br>Yui tells Yukino in the vaguest most roundabout way possible that if she doesn't confess right here right now then it'll come down to whoever wins the "who can help the most people" contest the whole club was started on. Hachiman knows that'll never work because Yukino doesn't want someone making decisions for her like that blah blah blah it's retarded. If I ever met someone who was that vague and insincere about everything I would avoid them at all cost</br>  <br>I'm not being disingenuous because I specifically used the word "growth" to indicate beneficial change, not "development" to indicate general character progression.<br><br>Whether Yukino and Yui's regression is only temporary is nothing but your personal conjecture. Currently the only fact we have is that in their current state they're arguably less functional as people than they were at the beginning of the LN.<br><br>Granted  was arguably talking about general progression, but frankly he's a moron anyway for thinking that Iroha's student council duties haven't been relevant since 9.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man tried to hold Sagami's hand, all it did was make her cry.</br>  <br>Iroha is Komachi, and because she's Komachi she gets a very good insight into 8man's mind even if she's not 8man.</br>  So, will the series continue after the cliffhanger?  <br>Depends on how many more volumes of the LN come out. Author is starting a new series soon though so I imagine not.</br>  <br>Watari's contract will end, and so the light novel will end with nobody understanding anything</br>  <br><br>The LN will. We've got at least one more volume coming. Perhaps more. The more volumes we get the greater the chance of a S3. Most don't seem to expect more than two more volumes at the most.</br></br>  <br>Here, m8.</br>  <br>When does she see 8man's thought process or solutions?<br>All I remember is her getting mad at him and Yukino for ranting in the middle of the Christmas event.</br></br>    <br>It's because patriarchal societies like Japan love to see old men revel in their authority.</br>  <br>The point is you still tried to use the girls' current state to depict them badly and make Iroha seem better by comparison<br><br>And if you're really going to try and start an argument that somehow Yukino and Yui's current state ISN'T temporary, we're done here. I don't feel like wasting my time on someone deluded enough to argue that Watari will turn this narrative on its head. I'll even give you as much that there's a non-zero chance of it happening, but to actually bet on that is crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>That's because you don't like girls.</br>  <br> threesome with Yukino, You, Iroha <br> 8mans watches them walk off together laughing </br></br>  <br>The only thing I don't agree with is the "She's already given up in the 8man bowl" line. She clearly wants a fair fight and wanted Yukino to finally step up to the plate.</br>  <br>She's so poor she couldn't even afford to get a role in the first season with the real girls.<br><br>She's that poor.</br></br></br>  <br>Some specific instances off the top of my head is how she gets him on a date by making it a part of work, picking up on him being into younger girls/siscon, and her pretty spot-on imitation of him during vol 11. (Cut by FEEL, of course.)</br>  I can't stop staring at her tiny mouth.  <br> You </br>  <br>POVERTY-CHAN OR DEATH</br>  <br>Arranged marriages are not genuine if the party members dont have feelings for the other</br>  <br>Reminds me of Chihaya's fit of laughter in im@s</br>  shaa~  <br> Biased towards Yukino <br>Otherwise, it's okay. Needs a tl;dr version.</br></br>  <br> It's not looking good for my girl <br> hurr durr bias </br></br>  I need this Iroha card.  <br>Who said anything about trying to start an argument? I merely explained my reasoning after you accused me of being disingenuous.<br><br>You shoud stop getting angry at people for saying things you disagree with on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>Feelings can come after the marriage tho</br>  <br>And just who do you suppose 'my girl' is? Because I can assure you it's neither of the two female leads.</br>  <br>The fact you think it looks good for either one of them says you're biased.</br>  <br>http://a.uguu.se/aqmguq_shaaa.webm</br>  How would you describe their respective types of cuteness?  <br>True but I dont think Yukinoshita would want it for obvious reasons. Even moreso if it involved Hayama</br>  <br> http://a.uguu.se/aqmguq_shaaa.webm<wbr></wbr> <br> ehh <br> The file you were looking for is not here... <br> It probably expired or never existed, check your URL. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck it died</br>  <br>genuine<br><br>fake</br></br></br>  <br>shaa~ denied</br>  <br><br>I can still see it through 4chanx embed.</br></br>  <br> can <br><br>What if it doesn't?</br></br></br>  <br> Yumiko <br> Yankee/Delinquent looking boss girl <br> Fiery personality <br> Actually motherly and kind </br></br></br></br>  Is that why Iroha really wanted 8man to become a publisher? Because he'd be bringing in the dough so Iroha can live a non poor life once they marry?  <br>They're both gap moe.<br><br> Yumiko seems moody but is actually really caring <br> Iroha seems fake but she's actually genuine </br></br></br></br>  <br>A Sugawa with worse taste?</br>  <br>Your reasoning was completely ridiculous, as is your assumption that I'm angry because I used the phrase "start an argument"</br>  <br> Yankee/Delinquent looking boss girl <br>delinquents with drill hair is the new meta</br></br>  <br> publisher <br> bringing in the dough <br>She wanted to keep her job of pleasing old men for money so she's deliberately pointing 8man towards a shitty job</br></br></br>  <br>go back to /d2g/</br>  <br> Publisher <br> Dough <br><br>Are you 12?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or at least a Chuuni.</br>  <br>That's the average age for an Irohafag</br>  <br>Closest thing to orcs you can get.</br>  <br><br>I just don't think this guy has it right. It would take an equally long amount of text to address everything he wrote. But especially at the end he gets it wrong.<br><br>When Yukino says "Don't you tell me how I feel" she is talking to Yui. Specifically she is rejecting what Yui was trying to do earlier by trying to force Yukino to back down (of course that was just her surface effort, she was obviously relying on Hachiman to step in). Not acting like she doesn't have feelings or being disingenuous about her feelings for Hachiman. You could say she was being disingenuous in acting like she wasn't about to succumb to Yui's pressure. She still hasn't confessed them, but she is not denying them in that moment.<br><br><br><br>How is it biased towards Yukino? That guy obviously is not a Yukinofag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Publishing Editor* I meant...<br><br>They're talking about jobs and the publishing Editor position comes up. Iroha says she plans to marry one then suggests that 8man become one</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually I made that judgement because you thought it was worthwhile to make an entire post of pointless insults and accusations.<br><br>Why are you even posting at this point? You clearly have nothing to say about Oregairu anymore.</br></br></br>  Everyday until I'm bored.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/tplqqbrcmf.mp4<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>I wish they would release OVAs or something.</br>  <br>のだけれど</br>  The only way to resolve this is for Hayato to man up and get with Yukino already.  <br><br>Do you think he will? That actually sounds pretty interesting, I wouldn't be against the idea of him coming in and sweeping up Yukino. It's definitely not outside the realm of possibility, at least.</br></br>  <br>Then it's revealed 8man's true goal was Yumiko all along.</br>  <br> constantly lies in order to get closer to Hachiman <br><br>Read the fucking LNs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No sir, apparently it's you who needs to read them.<br><br>Everything she does to get closer to Hachiman is hiding behind this "I love Hayato" lie. It's just lie after lie after lie from her. There's nothing sincere about her behavior towards Hachiman.</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like he settles for Yukino since Haruno is out of reach</br>  <br>money bitches.</br>  <br><br>I would bet everything on if Hayama ever actually switches his affections from Haruno to Yukino for whatever reason, he will get rejected by this point.<br><br>It would be amusing to see though. Hayama rejected old doll-Yukino years before then falls for new-and-improved Yukino but Hachiman has already got her.</br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand FEEL's marketing.<br><br>Why would they toned down all the Yui/Iroha scene? <br>Just compare their scene in vol 11 with the LN and the atmosphere feels entirely different.<br><br>If they are trying to appeal to the Yukinofags then why are all the goods they sell are Yui related?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He said he love Y <br> mfw when Y is Yukimom </br></br>  <br><br> They know who is going to win from Wataru </br></br>  <br> why are all the goods they sell are Yui related? <br>Are you positive about that?</br></br>  <br>Yui has more merch because bigger tits and her birthday, despite this Yukino and Hachiman seem to have sold better.<br><br>Also WW was helping with the anime with some creative directing since Vol11 wasn't even released.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying there are any author is spoiling his own story before he wrote it themself. </br>  <br> Everything she does to get closer to Hachiman is hiding behind this "I love Hayato" lie. <br><br> What's volume 10.5? <br> What's the club magazine? <br><br> there's nothing sincere about her behavior <br> tells him she only asked out Hayama because of Hachiman's genuine speech <br> told him she wanted to find genuine with HIM <br><br>Read the LNs, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui has more pixiv art too.<br><br>Dunno man.</br></br></br>   /a/ on 6/18 <br>Hahah Yuifags should an hero. Her ship is burning<br><br> /a/ on 6/28 <br>Looks like she has a shot now. She may not win but her ship is still sailing<br><br>What happened? You are all hypocrites.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> every anon is the same <br><br>Do you remember when people thought the spoon scene was a rejection from Hachiman? Blame denialfags who believe anything 2ch says.</br></br></br>  Ok brothers. Seeing as Iroha doesn't have a real chance at the 8man, do we form an allegiance with Yui or Yukinon?  <br>The manga (Vol7) has a full body shot of that and I love it.</br>  <br>I'm a Yukinofag and I thought the final scene looked pretty damn good for Yui.</br>  <br>I didn't though</br>  <br>Possible Watari has already said how it ended.</br>  <br>He should have been sitting in on the script writing conferences so I doubt they'd be able to get away with such massive Yukino flags without Watari's consent.</br>  <br><br>What's this about vol 10.5? You mean when she got Hachiman to go on a date with her by pretending it was some sort of practice date for Hayama?<br><br>And the magazine? Where she acts like she's fixated on getting photos of Hayama?<br><br>She doesn't tell him she wants to find genuine with him. She just vaguely says "I’m starting to want something genuine too."<br><br>Still you cite a tiny handful examples against almost every other Iroha moment in the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Even if this is the case,<br>this still doesn't make sense.<br><br>If I were them I would make it as vague as possible so that all the shipperfags will buy the BD.<br><br><br><br>Look up the BD pre-order special illustrations,<br>all of them has Yui in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I am starting to suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.</br></br>  <br> some sort of practice date for Hayama? <br><br>READ<br><br>THE<br><br>LNs<br><br>I'm convinced you just parrot what you just selectively repeated what you heard in these threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow, you're right, and for the whole box set too. <br>Maybe Feel decided to dedicate season 2 to Yui as a consolation prize for losing the 8bowl.</br></br>  <br><br>What the hell, you may just be right.<br><br>I mean if you look at all the patterns and connections, it starts to seem like that might be true.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If I were them I would make it as vague as possible so that all the shipperfags will buy the BD. <br> Being even more vague <br>No one would know what the fuck is going on in anything if they were even more vaguer.</br></br></br>  <br> losing the 8bowl. </br>  <br>Care to make another prediction for volume 12?</br>  <br>Not really. The triangle got dissolved at the end of EP 13 so all ships and shippers are dead, save for Iroha.</br>  <br>Who has the all the panels of this</br>  <br> You mean when she got Hachiman to go on a date with her by pretending it was some sort of practice date for Hayama? <br>Ah, no it wasn't a practice date for Hayama, it was specifically "research" for dating spots that match 8man's preferences. <br><br>She barely even used the Hayama excuse, only mentioning him when saying she'd prefer to go places where Hayama normally wouldn't, or to spell it out to a retard (i.e you), she wanted to go to places where 8man wanted to go.<br><br> And the magazine? Where she acts like she's fixated on getting photos of Hayama? <br>Ignoring the fact that it was made an obvious parrael to 8man's obsession with Totsuka? Nice reading skills there faggot, I bet repeating fifth grade so many times must have been a trying time fort you.<br><br> She doesn't tell him she wants to find genuine with him. She just vaguely says "I’m starting to want something genuine too." <br>Ignores the fact that everything about that conversation was revolving around 8man, and how he personally effected her. Subtext, try using a dictionary for once in your life. If that isn't beyond your reading skills of course.<br><br> Still you cite a tiny handful examples against almost every other Iroha moment in the series. <br>Mirrors, they are a thing. You know you can stop pretending like you read the series (or can even read at all) at this point. Every poorly thought out word is just making you seem more and more retarded. Quite funny in my honest opinion.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127360519#p127368692">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Except that entire scene symbolized that he chooses Yukino over Yui.

Whenever you get a show like this that is about "changing the laws of the universe" they can just make whatever insane claims they want because there are literally no rules left for them to abide by. How the fuck does the god of their universe get trapped in a witches labyrinth if she doesn't really even exist as a being. All of this is fiction so they just make up whatever they want.</br></br>  <br>there's something wrong with these legs</br>  <br> homu did nothing wrong <br>Throwing away candy that Kyouko gave her<br>Strangling Bebe/Nagisa<br>Ruining Mami's tea time<br>Lobotomizing/kidnapping Madoka<br>Throwing away the apple that Kyouko gave to the Clara Dolls<br>Wiping Sayaka's memory<br><br>Remove akuma</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pls help, there was an MS paint thread a few weeks ago and some anon actually animated the transformation sequences from rebellion using shitty MS paint drawings. I was too busy laughing my ass off to save it. Anyone have it?  <br>Posting madohomu<br><br>Pretty much. The series last episode had good closure so they had to come up with some crazy asspull to continue it.</br></br></br>  <br>This image isn't correct.<br>Homu wouldn't be able to handle a Madoka harem so calmly.</br></br>  <br>This. I felt the first ending was more understanding and had way less asspulls. Rebellion was just a cash grab as far as I can tell.</br>  <br>This?</br>  <br><br>Neat</br></br>  <br>Giving everyone their happy ending.<br>Your argument is invalid.</br></br>  <br>  i can agree on the first one <br>  she though bebe was a witch. <br>  fair enough but if she didnt we wouldn't have gotten mami v homu  <br>  madoka still has free will and is now safe from qb forever thanks to her forceful intervention. it may have not been what mado wanted but it was what needed to be done <br>  maybe she doesent like apples <br> sayaka a shit </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> but it all seemed pointless and like it was trying too hard to be deep <br>Yeah except it wasn't. Pic related if you want me to spoil it. It had depth, but it was appropriate depth for the story. It's all actually superficial, but you have to be looking for the right thing. <br><br> I think bebe was retarded also <br>Bebe was supposed to be a red herring, you're supposed to question what the fuck her purpose is. Her purpose is to confuse you. Within the first 2 minutes of the movie you see Madoka (who's a god), Sayaka (who's dead), and Bebe (who's a witch) fighting what YOU think is a witch. Obviously you should be concerned about the first two, but you're distracted by the fact that the fucking sweet's witch is working with Mami. <br><br> Whenever you get a show like this that is about "changing the laws of the universe" they can just make whatever insane claims they want because there are literally no rules left for them to abide by. <br>There were no rules in the series either, it's fucking magic. I don't know what you want. Even the most logical being in the universe was mind (and regularly) fucked by the ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Faggots.</br>  <br>best fluff is with madohomu</br>  <br>Haha oh wow, that's not it but I'm happy this exists too. Somewhere out there, there's a shitty MS paint version of https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-F2<wbr>KhA1Y1Dk</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br>Wrong one I think. My folders are very unorganized</br></br>  <br>Fuck but I actually like arguing about rebellion against people like  and . Not that I want to be antagonistic, I just really love discussing this movie. Though I do think they're wrong. <br><br>BUT, I have to go because work at 6 AM. Maybe next thread.</br></br></br>  <br>YESSSS thank you :D this is perfect</br>  <br>Okay, I laughed.</br>  needs moar madohomu  <br>is for keeping your room well illuminated at a reasonable cost...</br>  <br>Yeah this did nothing for me.So Homura finds out from madoka that she really didn't want to become god or whatever, so homura decides to rip her out of it. That's were I really lose it. First of all, even in that picture it shows the scene where she is said to no longer exist in the universe. So the fact that a girl managed to rip god out of thin air is retarded. The fact that Madoka was even personified as a god in that scene is retarded. She is stated to no longer exist yet walks down from space to collect homura.</br>  <br>toasting best girls</br>      <br>Looks like we have a retard in the thread.</br>  <br>lewd imagine incoming may get banned for this</br>  <br> He's pointing out the asspulls in my favorite magical girl show!! <br> better shitpost. </br></br>  Is MadoHomu  comfiest  couple?  <br>the are very   cozy  </br>    <br>Diapering Homura</br>  Name one reason why you hate it without using the words Mary and Sue.  But I don't hate it.  <br>Not funny, hurts my eyes.</br>  <br>shit.</br>  <br>Literally Reddit the anime</br>  <br>Not enough focus on Jibril</br>  <br> not being acclimated to positive-aligned planes </br>    <br>Gary and stu.</br>  <br>Shit art.</br>  <br><br>I´m not into stories where mains win just because the plot focuses around them.</br></br>  <br>You must not like a lot of anime then.</br>   No nipples.   <br>The story feels pointless.<br>I don't hate it though, it's fun.</br></br>  <br>I want a Jibril war stories spin-off. With her just going around wrecking shit and getting really aroused</br>  <br>It made sense if you watched that episode. They basically got magically removed.</br>  <br>I don't hate it, but I dropped the manga because I got bored of it, and I'm so incredibly fucking stupid I didn't understand the rock paper scissors tie. <br><br>Friends laughed at me and explained it, and I just didn't like it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a series about game logic for games with bullshit rules. It's basically Kaiji but for children, made up of all the things children love like bright colors, in your face fanservice, and related nerdy main characters who also happen to be the smartest people in the entire world. <br><br>I had fun watching the show but in no way would I ever hold it in high regard. The only half way smart thing the show ever did was the rock paper scissors game at the beginning and that was only because of the way the game's rules were worded.</br></br></br>  <br>It was fun and deserves a second season.</br>  I only like SERIOUS anime for SERIOUS people  <br>Not enough loli fluffy tail voiced by Sawashiro Miyuki.</br>  <br> every thread </br>  I want more.  I dont like the bloom they use<br>Shit hurts my eyes, feels like someone smeared vaseline on my eyes</br>  It's basically SAO in that the premise sets up inherent rules but the actual characters go fuck the rules and they do whatever they want<br><br>There's no real conflict when the writing directly makes it so they win or lose at any point for almost no reason</br></br>  <br>This. The game with Jibril was the best in the entire anime.<br><br>Maybe if they do a S2  ;_;  we'll get to see the other Flugel and their Sora &amp; Shirou fanclub.</br></br></br>  <br>It was my favorite anime that season</br>  But I liked it. Not enough Tet though. He was pretty hot  <br>No nipples.</br>  <br>Aaand /thread</br>  <br>But I like it, it's simple, light and fun.<br>It's the type of anime you can watch with friends and not think too much</br></br>  <br>Reddit: the anime, the experience.</br>  <br>It wasn't good, but I liked it. Guilty Pleasure.</br>  <br> Implying I hate it <br>Why would you do that?<br><br>Shiro is best girl.</br></br></br></br>  I'll just leave these.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Okv<wbr>xvHNhClQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UWe<wbr>ULiYQbak</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=69n<wbr>yEcQ112o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  I want to cum on Ritsu's forehead.  <br>I'd imagine the line for that is rather long by now.</br>  <br>dude, i get that you want to cum on foreheads, but do you really need to do so twice a day?<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127354<wbr>042</wbr></br></br></br>  I'll take your Ritsu and upgrade it to Mugi's master race  I want to cum in their tea.  <br>Can't you see that she's hot?

I apologize, I only got two hours of sleep today.</br>  Depends. Only the cutest girls can pull off short hair. So if you hate it when you're waifu cuts her hair it means she was a shit all along.
