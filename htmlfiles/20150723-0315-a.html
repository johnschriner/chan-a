I'm still really enjoying the way events are rearranged and some elements are introduced earlier or in a different context, it feels very fresh to me, and the pace and flow of events is still great comedic-wise and storytelling-wise. They captured the essence of Mikan's character very nicely, and though it didn't feel as rewarding, if that's the right word, as it did originally, they still left a lot of room for development on her side, and she's still hilarious, so nothing's really lost. It’s even better because even mangaonlyfag can enjoy this because everything is changed in a good way and they make it new.<br>The truth is that there's the slight feeling that I really wanted to see some of the manga scenes accurately adapted, but I'm not coming from a place that thinks that the changes are bad, since I honestly don't, it's just that some of the scenes from the manga were so great. Now it's the adaptation's time to shine though, up until now I've thoroughly enjoyed each episode, I'm also loving adapted Shiragami more and more with every passing week, and I'm looking forward for what's to come because In the end,</br>  <br>The only harem that was ever AOTS was Bakemonogatari.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> Hare+Guu <br> good </br></br>  <br> not posting the official, objective version <br> instead posting the pretentious version </br></br>  <br>evidence of /a/'s shit taste at the time</br>  <br> Bakemonogatari <br> AOTY </br></br>  <br> thinking well written shows that took actual talent to make being AOTY is pretentious  <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br> check chart <br> are there any Yuasa anime <br> yes <br>It's pretentious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>where? reddit?</br>  <br> talks about pretentiousness <br> posts a chart that has Paranoia Agent on it </br></br>  It'll probably be One Punch Man but seeing as how that hasn't yet aired I will withhold my opinion.  <br> Kekkai <br>Will it be actually finished before 2015 is over?</br></br>  <br> well written shows that took actual talent <br> Madoka <br> Hyouka <br> Shirobako <br><br>Those shows fit the bill perfectly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best AOTY list I ever saw on /a/</br>  <br>I'll defend Ping Pong as AOTY 2014<br><br>or die trying</br></br></br>  <br>How is Yuasa pretentious?

In fact I'd say it has the most realistic art style of any anime in the past 2 years. You don't see anime like Ping Pong everyday. If you had any sense you would know it was a creative choice to keep Ping Pong's art style like that to make the characters look real and believable but add a sense of artistry to it.</br></br></br>  <br> Art &gt; Animation &gt; Characters &gt; Plot <br>So I guess you liked Shitgatsu too?</br></br>  <br> runner up 2015 <br> hibike </br></br>  <br> Ping Pong has top tier art direction <br>I could draw better by sticking a pen up my ass and writing with my ass.</br></br>  <br>Winter and Summer been shit, still have hope for Fall, but so far the only posible candidates are Etotama or Kekkai Sensen.</br>  <br>You should put more effort in your shitpost.</br>  <br>I disagree. An anime with superb art and animation will still be shit if the characters and plot are badly written, whereas a well-written anime with good characters can captivate me enough to overlook subpar art/animation.</br>  Am I the only one who feels like the general quality of AOTY contenders have dropped since 2010 or 2011?  <br><br>It's true. Hibike is super boring, it's like Glasslip but with an extra layer of polish.</br></br>  <br> . Ping Pong is a walking sportsshonen/battleshonen cliche. <br><br>Nope, it's the most accurate depiction of sports competition with respect to the game and more importantly its players and the struggles they go through as athletes, friends, rivals, and humans. I'd say it's the best sports anime since Slam Dunk. Inoue is the Yuasa of manga.</br></br></br>  <br> quality <br>Feels more like quantity. There's less and less anime that I would consider even good.</br></br>  Nice, another shitpost thread.  <br>Care to give an example? I'm interested in what you consider subpar art vs good art.</br>  <br> idiots who don't realize Ping Pong's art style was done on purpose </br>  <br>If the characters are shit no amount of good animation will save it from being shit<br>See SAO</br></br>  <br>I will agree with this, but only due to the fact that this year has been pretty shit overall and there hasn't been anything I liked more.

This is the biggest problem with the industry and at the rate it's going Anime will collapse sooner than later. We need to stop all the pandering, cheap shilling of industry names, and reduce all the adaptations especially the fucking LN ones since LNs are just a horrible medium meant to target a particular audience and make a quick buck. We need to have more original anime.</br>  <br>I haven't seen it, but it doesn't look particularly interesting to me.</br>   2014 had Ping Pong, Barakamon and Shirobako <br> 2015 has fucking nothing <br>Why is this year so bad?</br></br>  <br><br>If KyoAni did Glasslip you guys would be all over it saying it's the best anime ever.</br></br>  <br> anime is dying <br><br>I love this meme.</br></br></br>  <br> Anime will collapse sooner than later <br>Good.

Financially it's fine for the time being, but you can't argue that the quality is going down. Anime is less of an art form nowadays and more of a poorly adapted commercial meant to promote something else which is used to make money which leads to more merchandise and creates a franchise. Anime is dying in a figurative sense and somewhere down the line, maybe 15-20 years from now the pandering might not work anymore and people will stop buying late night anime. Who knows?</br>  YOU LIE IN APRIL is AOTY  <br>The industry is just preparing their big guns for 2016, right?</br>  <br><br>Literally nothing wrong with Gate.</br></br>  <br> Actually responding to an obvious bait. <br>How long have you been here?

You got me.</br>  <br> Two episodes in and a few spoilers <br>Let me guess it's when the internet told you Japan beat US, Russia, and China together right? Stop going to that website it's not true.</br></br>  <br>That too yeah, but even the new Mushishi felt lacking, which had all the prospects of being just as good as the first. I admit I've only seen 9 episodes, but it seems to me like it has a much lower budget than the first season. The scenery porn scenes have been very few and far between, and the amount of character closeups with a simple gradient colored background is frankly ridiculous. <br>Even the music, which is still composed by Masuda Toshio and sounds just like Mushishi, hasn't really grabbed me. I know it's just one example, but this example disheartens me particularly because Mushishi was just so fucking good, and we had to wait almost 10 years for another season.</br></br>  <br> Shimoneta <br>American Pile of anime<br>Garbage show</br></br></br>  <br>Charlotte and NNB are good, the other ones are shit adaptions and LN trash.

From the profound debates about eating cake, to the highly philosophical discussions about procrastination, to the marvellous musicianship exhibited by the Light Music Club, K-ON has established itself as the greatest intellectual anime. You cannot disagree unless you are a terrible person. Seriously. It's an infallible law of the universe. K-ON is a masterpiece.

There was just nothing close.</br>  <br>Not the same guy, but feel free to elaborate about what it is.</br>  <br> Shirobako for 2014 <br>Funny how no one even talks about Shirobako anymore, yet Ping Pong is an anime that will be talked about 10 years from now. No one bothers spamming Shirobako, because no one even fucking watched it.</br></br>  <br>But it wasn't a vocal minority, the general consensus is that it was AOTY.</br>  <br>Proxy polls are not a consensus.</br>  <br>YuYuYu was even more stupid, clichéd mahou shoujo garbage with a cop-out ending. 3/4ths of the show was just Madoka copy-pasted with shittier voice acting and visuals.</br>  <br>Shirobako is above average and will be remembered (and forgotten) as such.</br>  <br> hipstershit watched by less than 1/4 of the board <br> general consensus <br><br>This is what hipsters actually believe</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing wong with moving, it's not the death of a studio. I know you will like it to be exactly that but the truth is that they've grown a lot. It's obvious that you'll have to expand at one point. I'm literally not bothered or worried about this at all.</br>  <br>Not above anon but the manga actually managed to grab me and to get me to care for those girls where zombie survival usually fails. GG's charm lies in Yuki's delusions and how it creates a situation where you fear for the girls because it could lead them to their death, while allowing to give each or them a definite personality and how each is essential to the survival of the group. It isn't just a matter of "Moe / thrash" contrast.</br>  <br> Pleiades <br> Yuuki Yuuna <br> good <br><br> Ping Pong <br> stupid shit <br><br>Something tells me you haven't been watching anime for more than a year, summerfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Non Non Biyori Repeat.</br>  <br>Hi /mu/. Saw that band live a few months back, shit was insane.</br>  The Mushishi movie.  <br>Ok. So you don't have an actual argument.</br>  <br>Did i say its bothering me?<br><br>I just said they won't do any new shows during the next seasons because of it.</br></br></br>  Kiniro Mosaic  <br>How cute.

I wonder which one of these shows are "hipstershit"</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you have to be hipster to like Ping Pong</br>  <br> No-one talks about Shirobako anymore <br>Jesus Christ, we've had talks about the anime fairly recently. Besides, how much a show is talked about has nothing to do with quality. See the endless "Railgun" threads.<br><br><br>It was nothing like Madoka, reveals aside.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> calls Ping Pong stupid shit without even watching it <br> defends two generic madoka rip-offs <br>Adorable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>YuYuYu still gets generals even now. Ping Pong threads are just shitposting.</br></br>  <br> dropped by more than 3/4 of the board after the first 2 eps aired <br>I wish. They all picked it up again once they realized that there were plot twists and edgy shit to circlejerk about. All of them bitching about the happy ending was beyond insufferable.</br></br>  <br> no one even talks about Shirobako anymore <br> Implying this is a sign of a good/bad show </br></br>  <br>Yeah it's definitely not because of the retards who call it "pretentious" and "hipster shit"</br>  <br>I dont like yucky tuna, shitobako or gaynax latest shitfest, no idea why you mentioned them or thought were related to the post you quoted. shit ping is still CRAP.</br>  <br> It was nothing like Madoka <br>Let's see<br> exact same colour scheme <br> grimdark suffering <br> characters fight enemies in a separate dimension away from civilians <br> cop-out happy ending   Rebellion aside <br>Keep eating shit, faggot.<br><br><br> YuYuYu still gets generals <br>Haha<br> generals <br> a sign of a quality show <br>Fuck off, newfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mahou shoujos are now madoka rip-offs </br>  <br>Pleiades isn't in any way similar to Madoka aside from the fact that it's mahou shoujo. You don't even know anything about the shows you're criticizing. Who's the newfag here again? Go watch some anime you stupid niwaka and stop championing your shitty tastes.</br>  <br>Please drop your Ping Pong goggles right now, you're not being objective. YuYuYu and Shirobako are still getting usual threads and where fall's most successful and marking shows. You literally can't deny that, with both selling over the 10k bar. You're just delusional.</br>  <br>Most Ping Pong discussion these days is about how ugly and pretentious it is.</br>  <br> Madoka <br> happy ending </br></br>  <br>So far Non Non Biyori Repeat.<br><br>It would have been JoJo part 3 if they didn't fuck up the ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Homu's happy</br>  <br> yucky tuna <br> shitobako <br> gaynax latest shitfest <br> shit ping <br><br>A tell tale sign of a shitposting MALfag is combining a show they haven't even seen's name with a swear word, thinking they're being clever or funny.<br>It's neither.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> homu happy <br> when madoka's gone <br>In rebellion, she is happy, though, so you're not completely wrong.</br></br></br>  <br> YuYuYu and Shirobako are still getting usual threads <br>Show me in the archive</br></br>  <br>The colour scheme is on par with every MS show, you dipshit. And there is no yellow or green Mahou Shoujo in Madoka.<br>The suffering is also a recurrent theme. Madoka just went all the way in.<br>cop-out happy ending is only for YuYuYu.

How else are we supposed to keep the normies out?</br>  <br>It seems to me a fairly safe assumption that it was attempting to impress by affecting greater importance and quality than its choice of visual style actually possessed, as it seems to me a fairly safe assumption that it attempted to be something better than dogshit mixed with elephant semen, which is what it actually ended up looking like.</br>  <br>hope this means they're not doing Baku-On.</br>  <br>Took 11 meandering, lazy episodes to tell a story that could have been done in 90 minutes.<br><br>Looked like complete shit for no reason other then wow so unique.</br></br></br>  <br><br>NNB, obviously.</br></br>  Why do people shit on Ping Pong but no one shits on Tatami Galaxy?  <br>It was actually creative and had something interesting to say about its characters besides "HERO MAN U CAN BE HERO"</br>  <br>Tatami Galaxy is shat on for being pretentious, repetitive, poorly-paced drivel fairly often here, actually.</br>  <br>Your assumption is shit though. <br>It just respects the original art as do many other studios.</br></br>  <br>I would guess that the primary reason is that Tatami Galaxy does not look like a fat southern American woman's vomit after spending a few hours at Old Country Buffet.</br>  <br><br>Meanwhile, your precious Pong is missing from both current boards and the archive. There are no YuYuYu threads right now because most sufferingfags like me jumped on the Gurashi bandwagon. <br>And there are 3 Shirobako threads in the archive.</br></br></br>  <br>I've seen three threads in the past day saying just that about both.<br>I don't understand the criticisms but they've been receiving them lately in droves.</br></br>  <br> Your assumption is shit though.  <br>No, it's correct. I said it's safe to assume that it attempted to be something better than dogshit mixed with elephant semen. "An adaptation that is respectful of the original art" is better than dogshit mixed with elephant semen. The show attempted to send the message, "I am being respectful of the original art," but the message that was actually sent was, "this looks like dogshit mixed with elephant semen."<br>Do you understand now? This is very simple.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes they do. I don't remember the last time I saw Tatami Galaxy being mentioned in a positive light.</br>  <br>Complaining about art style is the shallowest possible criticism.</br>  <br><br>The only people who dislike Ping Pong or Tatami either are trying hard to be nonconformists or are too stupid to appreciate them. <br><br>Anyone who think's the dialogues in Tatami are too fast probably does not read much literature. <br><br>Also using the word pretentious without knowing what the word even means is too common on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I stayed for the osts in the end songs and etc.<br><br>The manga aint bad so far.</br></br></br>  Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works.<br>Then again, it was better than every anime post-Eva so it isn't really fair.</br>  <br>It is, but that's a fact: a show with a weird artstyle is more likely to get bad criticism than a good-looking one. /a/utists are just that shallow but hey, don't forget that this is the place where nothing is good, anime are shit and people just pretend to watch them while dressing up as little girls.</br>  <br>Anyone who literally believes certain things are immune to criticism definitely doesn't read literature and is an obvious manchild pseud.</br>  <br>That was not the point though.<br>The initial claim that you made it that Ping Pong is pretentious since it wanted to be "superio" to the medium by "affecting greater importance and quality than its choice of visual style actually possessed" . This is wrong since the original manga is very close to the art style.<br>Now you say that the art looks like shit. That is subjective but in no way does it make the show pretentious.<br>Do you understand now? This is very simple.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not when you're talking about a primarily visual medium. That's like calling it shallow for complaining that someone with great lyrics sings out of key with the vocal tone of my grandmother's farts.</br>  <br>It'll be NNB again.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> Aria three times <br> Non Non Biyori two times <br> Sora no Woto <br> Hyouka <br><br>What is this abomination? And where is the old version?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only message you're sending is that you're a shallow faggot who thinks that art style is the end all be all and any show that happens to have unique art is shit, despite the fact that said show actually has excellent writing and was a standout of its year.<br><br>Hell at first I was reluctant to watch the show exactly because the art was off-putting, but by the end of it I was so immersed in the show that I wasn't even affected by the art and actually even came to enjoy it. You just stop caring about that shit when the writing and characters are good.</br></br></br>   Cinderella Girls.   <br>see<br><br>They're exactly the same thing. An anime with a great story (Ping Pong's is shit, btw) that looks like dogshit is exactly like a song with great lyrics sung by William Hung.</br></br></br>  <br> generalizing  <br>You can do this with any anime.</br></br>  AOTY will be owarimonogatari  <br>Depends entirely on what you're looking for. I found a show in Ping Pong which had an art style I liked, excellent direction, and realistic characters. That's why I think it was the AOTY.</br>  <br>I still need to watch half of this list but it looks correct for those that I know. NNB AOTY might be pushing it, tho.</br>  So is anything that isn't a shounen for 14 year olds or a moe SoL or a mahou shojo, "hipstershit" and "pretentious"?  <br>No, not every show has such awful pacing. The characters fucked around and repeated themselves for the entire show until they needed a resolution at the end. It got the message across but each person had maybe 2-3 moments that actually furthered their development and it could have been done in movie format.</br>  <br>edgy seinen, forced drama</br>  <br>was yatterman night this year or last, i dont remember<br><br>i enjoyed it a lot. also the OP was amazing</br></br></br>  <br>I would say "welcome to /a/" but no, you should just fuck off.</br>  <br> yatterman night <br>Literally poor man's zvezda</br></br>  <br>that show was such crap</br>  <br>zvezda was the shit. i hope we get more of it</br>  <br>Not exactly comparable. Music evokes emotions more through instruments and singing itself than lyrics; lyrics regularly play second fiddle. Most classic albums are classic because of what they did aurally, not because of their lyrics. Meanwhile, most classic anime are classic because of their stories and characters, not because they had groundbreaking art. Instruments and singing are the backbone of music, story and characters are the backbone of a storytelling medium.</br>  <br>It was winter 2015.

Doesn't it tire you to watch the same thing over and over again about teenagers coming of age? Or are you just manchildren who didn't grow up yourselves so you vicariously live through who do?</br></br></br></br>   people didn't like Aku no Hana   <br>Are you saying Bakemonogatari is for people who want to experience mental and physical masturbation at the same time but can't?

And it was executed very well.</br></br></br>  <br>That's my first post in this thread anon.<br><br>I'm looking for answers. Everything has to pander to something because the end result is that the anime has to sell. Just like ecchi harems pander to otaku pervs, coming-of-age anime pander to manchildren?</br></br></br>  <br><br> Doesn't it tire you to watch the same thing over and over again about teenagers coming of age? <br><br>It does. There really should be more anime/manga about something other than HS.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked Ping Pong because it had solid character development, good pacing and excellent directing, so I guess it pandered to my desire to watch quality media.</br>  <br> solid character development <br>Ripped directly out of a textbook of sportsshonen/battleshonen cliches.</br></br>  <br>Pander? You really think they made Ping Pong to pander to a group of consumers? Why not just make an ecchi harem or a moe SoL then? Take off those cynicism goggles anon.</br>  <br>Texhnolyze was a real let-down to Serial Experiments Lain and Haibane Renmei, though.</br>  <br>Did you even fucking watch it, holy shit. Not to mention everything is a fucking clone of something, what matters is the execution, pacing and direction. Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Useless post.</br>  <br>because unfortunately most of /a/ is divided into two sects: moeshit SoL or Shonenshit. Those are two most talked about genres on this shithole and comprise the largest percentage of /a/. The people who like anything besides those two genres are smaller in comparison and when they try to discuss those anime they get shat on by autistic faggots from one of those two groups.</br>  <br>Ping Pong still sold decently, a lot more than most anime this year. I think it was like 4.5k or something like that.</br>  <br>It's really fucking annoying too. Not saying teenagers in HS are annoying by itself, but the coming-of-age stories that all demographics of anime slobber over are annoying.<br> supernatural teens <br> teens in mechs <br> teens in military <br> teens in post-apocalyptic world <br> teens thrust into a war <br> teens experiencing the first pangs of love <br> teens stranded and finding a way back <br>It's usually one or more of these settings mixed together, put in a coming-of-age introspective story in it, and people will lick the asshole of whoever directed it. It's the same goddamn progression over and over again yet these same people will look down on haremshit or shounenshit for the exact same thing.<br><br>Elitists must go, fuck your show.<br><br><br>I'm not being cynical. I'm disgusted at people who think their coming-of-age shows are so far superior than shows that deal with more mundane things like nudity and action.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it was a show about ping pong players who each had to find their own reason for playing sports and matured through the challenges they faced. It follows the basic template of character development for every show ever, and why wouldn't it? That's how fiction works. Hell, that's how life works. But it was well-written and believable, and the pacing and strong directing made it a joy to watch. It's all in the execution, as always.</br>  <br> Doesn't it tire you to watch the same thing over and over again about teenagers coming of age? <br><br>For most anime nowadays, yes. But that's because they're all generic, contrived trash reusing the same tropes over and over again, and changing some slight things to differentiate themselves from the other pieces of trash. But Ping Pong is much, much different in every way. This was teenage coming of age that was realistic and enjoyable.</br></br></br>  <br> solid character development <br>Hunter x Hunter<br> good pacing and excellent directing <br>which I can also find in Hunter x Hunter<br>with better fuckin' anime art and animation I might add<br>While HxH is also longer, has more content, is not just a one-off jackoff but a continual climax, yet you retards still say your taste is quality<br><br>How do you nerds live like that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> believable <br> Peco <br>Find me a sports nerd who had to visualize wings out of his back just to play his stupid ball game.<br><br>NONE.

I'm not really sure what you're complaining about anymore (did you barely realize that most anime is shit, and most things are in fact copies of each other?), so I'll just chalk this up to another nothing post. Anime is shit, we all pretty much knew that. <br><br>What's you're favorite anime though?</br></br></br>  <br>Kuusen Madoushi</br>  <br> This was teenage coming of age that was realistic and enjoyable. <br>How much will you bet you'll be saying that shit with the next coming of age anime you'll come across?<br> because they're all generic, contrived trash reusing the same tropes over and over again </br></br></br>  <br> Find me a sports nerd who had to visualize wings out of his back just to play his stupid ball game. <br>fucking kek <br><br>Why can't you just accept that a lot of us liked Ping Pong for what it was?

That's like saying you don't want to watch any other movie because you saw one movie you really liked.</br>  <br>It was a pretentiously directed anime.</br>  <br>There's several coming of age anime every season and 90% of them are shit, anon.</br>  <br> I'm not really sure what you're complaining about anymore <br>What made elitists decide coming-of-age anime was the best genre of anime when it's plagued with the same kind of repetitive cliches the same elitists accuse other genres for?<br> What's you're favorite anime though? <br>Penguindrum</br></br></br></br>  <br>Penguindrum is a coming of age anime.</br>  <br>I don't see any coming of age anime this season unless you count Gakkou Gurashi or Classroom Crisis.

I mean even 2chan agreed to that as well.</br>  <br>So you like Penguindrum because it's a coming-of-age anime but hate Ping Pong because it's a coming-of-age anime, even though they're both well-written shows and completely different in almost every way?</br>  <br> Find me a sports nerd <br><br>It's called a pre-game ritual and it's totally common among athletes. <br><br>For Peco, it's visualizing wings out of his back<br><br>For Jason Terry it's sleeping in his opponents' shorts<br><br>For Brian Urlacher, it's eating 2 girl scouts cookies <br><br>For John Henderson, it's getting other people to slap him<br><br>For Les Miles, it's eating grass off the football field<br><br>For goalie Sergio Goycochea it's pissing on the ground surrounding the soccer goal before a penalty kick<br><br>For Jason Giambi he likes wearing golden thongs whenever he was feeling down before a game<br><br>Even real people do weird shit before they play, and some of these are weirder than imagining you can fly which seems pretty normal</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are MAL cancer, leave /a/</br>  <br>You see them everywhere. It's why Bakemonogatari is so highly regarded when it's just drivel with so many words just to express that he wants to fuck this girl in front of him. It's why Planetes (great show don't get me wrong) is so highly regarded when it's just a whirlwind romance and her husband left him. It's why fucking Madoka sells so fucking much when it's just the director experimenting on whether magical girls dying would print some motherfucking money.<br><br>People fall for it every single time yet have the gall to point out the repetitiveness of ecchi, harem, and shounen.

Time to grow out of the medium, anon. <br><br> Or stop acting like a retard </br></br></br>  <br>Nyanpasu.</br>  <br>Congratulations, you just discovered the basic tropes of all fictional works.</br>  <br> including continued winter shows in spring AOTS </br>  <br><br>You've never played sports if you think pregame rituals needed shit as complicated as that. It's just ordinary things done in a strange way. Hallucinating before a match isn't ordinary it's fucking drug use.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking dumb? You're complaining that Peco is unrealistic in what he does before a match but I give you a list of several real athletes who do weird things before their matches, and some of them are even weirder than fucking imagining you can fly. Peco is fucking realistic in that aspect because there are people in real life who do the same fucking thing.</br>  <br>Congratulations, now you can't put down SoL moe shows for not being AOTS since coming of age shows literally follow a more rigid progression than sols.</br>  <br>Did anyone ever it sub it to the end? I can't even remember the name of the group that was two months or more behind for every release</br>  <br>While Euphonium has some of the most interesting visuals I've seen in a while, the first half of Shokugeki no Souma was more enjoyable than that. But my spring AOTS is Pleiades, the most enjoyable threads I had in this year.</br>  <br>CSB time. I'm a USC alumni. I was there with a roommate who knew someone who was on the baseball team with Barry Zito when he was at USC. One day Barry was too nervous to pitch, so he ran back to the showers to rub one off. Ended up throwing a shutout. Ever since then, dude rubs one off before every start. Never shake the hand of Barry Zito or Moises Alou, who peed on his hands for grip on the bat.</br>  <br>Characters growing up and maturing is a basic storytelling technique, dude. I'm not sure why you even bother consuming media at all when the idea of character development is pissing you off.</br>  <br>but they don't</br>  <br> Yahari </br>  <br>Too bad your so called AOTS Hibiki couldn't even break 10K while Kekkai broke 20K.<br><br>Western fans don't mean shit, what matters is sales in Japan. Fuck the OST for Kekkai sold more than the OST of Hibiki which is an actual musical anime.</br></br></br>  <br>good to know thanks</br>  <br>How is it rigid? Each show has different writing and each character matures differently. You're literally looking down on the entire concept of fiction, what the fuck are you even doing here?</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br> Western fans don't mean shit, what matters is sales in Japan. <br>The only opinions that matter here are the ones posted here. You know, the ones that crowned Hibike AOTS. KyoAni finds a way.</br></br>  <br>You know what also sold well? SAO. Now that's an AOTY for the ages, right?</br>  <br>Euphonium was great, but Kekkai Sensen is still better even without a final episode.</br>  <br> posting </br>  Well, this was one of the worst threads I've had the displeasure of reading this year.<br><br> show is good <br> nah uh <br> yah huh <br> muh 1 gorillion threads this week <br> is moeshit <br> is pretentious <br><br>Good job faggots</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Take a few minutes to even try and think what would be my favorite of 2015 so far <br> Nothing has been that good, check out thread anyway <br> All this Ping Pong hate <br> Pretentious <br><br>Listen faggots, you can hate and argue about Ping Pong all you want, but don't make shit arguments. You are just doing your own side a disservice when you call something pretentious because it means you don't have an argument or have such a shit vocabulary that you actually cannot articulate the thoughts in your own head.<br><br>Pretentious:<br> attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed. <br> Than is actually possessed <br><br>Who is the judge of that exactly? No one, you're just alluding to this authority that doesn't exist because you're too much of a pussy to do the work and argue.<br><br> Hipster <br>Same shit different word.<br><br>For fuck sakes /a/. At least make sense when you don't like things. You can just say you don't like the way it looks, period, AND NO ONE CAN REBUTTAL YOU<br><br>  Ping Ping obvi AOTY 2015  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do you think you are.</br>  <br> Good job faggots <br>Stopped reading there</br></br>  <br>By the looks of this thread, /v/.</br>  <br> stopped reading after the last sentence <br>Omedetou</br></br>  <br>I've been waiting for someone to say this.</br>  <br>ping pong was 2015?</br>  <br>  No I was trying to be funny. I failed [/spoiler[ </br>  <br><br>Did you guys not watch Ore MOnogatari or Shokugeki?<br><br><br>But<br> Yahari doing that well <br>I take it back, /a/ does like bad, pretentious anime at times.<br><br><br><br>Ping Pong was 2014</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is how all AOTS/AOTY threads are.<br>Usually the shows they pick shows what kind of people actually visit these threads.</br></br>  <br> This is how all threads that mention ping pong are <br>There, that's better. That show attracts some of the absolute worst shitposters, I have no idea what it is.</br></br>  <br> But <br> &gt;Yahari doing that well <br> I take it back, /a/ does like bad, pretentious anime at times. <br>For once I agree with you!</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've seen basically all the relevant spring shows and you can't be serious. Ore Monogatari is fucking repetitive as shit and should have been 1 cour. All it's about is how stronk Takeo is and how lewd Yamato is. It's not even enjoyable anymore, it's boring and a chore to watch but i've already invested too much time to quit now. <br><br>Shokugeki is alright, but I wouldn't call it the best show by any means. <br><br>Only shows i'd really consider for AOTS are Hibike and Kekkai although Kekkai delaying the last episode and having a general lack of a good overarching story makes me believe Hibike is really the only choice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it either, all the criticism sounds like shitposting nonsense from people who didn't even watch the show.</br>  <br><br> replying to tripfags with shitty taste <br>http://myanimelist.net/animelist/mr<wbr>runningbear</wbr></br></br></br>   Pongfags e-patting themselves on the back   <br> all the criticism sounds like shitposting nonsense from people who didn't even watch the show. <br>imagine that.</br></br>  <br>Goddammit Bear I swear to god Tokyo Magnitude is one of the shittiest shows out there. How have you not changed that already?</br>  <br>Clearly it's Non Non Biyori</br>  Etotama is the Ping Pong of 2015.  <br><br>It's because it isn't moe<br><br>That is the entire reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice false dichotomy faggot. Paint the whole world white and black why don't you, you little shitposter. This mindset of hurr durr TTGL is disliked because it's not LUCKY STAR, it's all LUCKY STARS fault! Fuck this thread. Fuck you</br>  <br>Dude are you serious?</br>  <br> acting like chobits wasn't great </br>  Posting in a shitpost thread   tfw I can't tell the people who generally think Non Non Biyori is AOTY from the people saying it just to troll.   <br> Hyouka <br>This is bait.</br></br>  <br><br>nnb</br></br>  <br>Non Non Biyori is one of the most well-executed SOLs of the past few years. <br><br> tfw not having to listen to constant internal monologues that explain every little bit of action <br>Like a pearl in a sea of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> SHOCK </br>  <br>Thank you for putting the names this time</br>  <br> any amount of discussion about things I dislike is shitposting  <br>whatever you say dude.</br></br>  <br>R u new? I'm curious</br>  <br>The first 2 or 3 episodes were so fucking terrible for Yuri Kuma I can't even consider it anything remotely close to AOTY.</br>  <br>worst ikuhara production</br>  <br> Subete ga F ni Naru <br>Fucking what?</br></br>  <br>Chobits was good, but there really wasn't anything else that year that stood out for me.<br><br><br>But it's such an emotional and great show. The only other shows I would consider for 2009 would be Ippo, Cross Game or Spic Wolf</br></br></br></br>  Teekyuu  <br>I'm sure Charlotte will be remembered because it's the sob story of the season, like anohana, AB! and maeda's other stuff.</br>  <br>Overlord and Gakkou Garashi come to mind; the former is just plain gud and the latter is a slow burn.</br>  <br>Why is there never a 2014 AOTY in these bait pictures?<br><br>It's pic related by the way</br></br></br>  <br>I like Code Geass but how the fuck did the 3rd spinoff OVA get that many votes?</br>  <br>Non Non Biyori repeat</br>  <br>Hmm let's see<br><br> top anime is moe yurishit, waifu pandering to the nth degree, KyoAni which is already sure to get votes <br> 2nd is Genuine Understanding RomCom which has a protagonist most people who watch anime can relate to and waifu pandering that reaches unprecedented levels that most of the threads on this show are trash because they're all waifu wars <br> 3rd and 4th are both shonenshit but the cooking one is shittier and has waifu pandering, either way both are entry level shit that appeal to kids <br> 5th is RPG shit with Gary Stu voiced by the King of Stus himself and full of waifu pandering including an oppai loli to get the lolicons too <br><br>Man all that shit taste<br><br>Thankfully 6th place breaks that cycle of trash with a heartfelt, romantic/coming-of-age SoL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Muh nigga<br>Best canon yuri show of the decade so far</br></br>  <br> hurr durr I have literally no idea what I'm talking about </br>  <br>Houkago no Pleiades<br>too bad like 15 people on /a/ watched it</br></br>  <br>Pleiades.</br>  Why don't just make Shirobako as double AOTY if you can't find AOTY of 2015 yet  <br>Tell that to Garden of Words</br>  <br>because it wasnt very good</br>  <br>It was AOTY 2014 but NNB Repeat is better.</br>  <br> no game no life <br>atrocious.</br></br>  <br> Implying people were here for the TTGL funposting <br> Implying people still remember Lucky Star and not blame everything on K-On now. <br>Get along with the times grandpa.</br></br></br>  <br>Improved =/= made worthwhile</br>  <br>No, Ping Pong was AOTY, followed by NNB.</br>  <br> mahou shoujo <br> madoka rip-off <br>i see pong ping fags retard as usual</br></br></br>  <br>ITT : pretentious shit that sell like shit</br>  <br>Yeah, it's not just very good, it's a phenomenon.</br>  <br>/a/ hipsters still pretend shitrobako was a big hit? Mein sides.</br>  <br>It is big hit, and once again Mizushima Tsutomu saved a studio after GuP.<br><br>Besides, the hipsters show of fall 2014 was Bahamut, a show that average sales was about 20% of Shirobako sales.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry it ain't a phenomenon. Just a dark horse title that gained traction near the middle of its run and appealed to Otaku enough for them to buy it. It's a solid hit but by this time next year most people won't even be talking about it. Love Live pretty much stole all the attention from everything in 2014.</br>  <br> exact same colour scheme <br>Next thing you will say is that Garo ripped the color scheme of power rangers<br><br> grimdark suffering <br> Madoka invented grimdark situations with suffering  <br><br> cop-out happy ending <br>Madoka's existence literally disappears, fuck of.<br><br><br> YuYuYu still gets generals even now. <br>You seriously need to check the definition of generals. Also the same thing that anon said to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do know Shirobako become a thing and stole all winter 2015 shows attention right? what's this have to do with Love Live which was a 2014 spring 1 cour show?<br><br> It's a solid hit but by this time next year most people won't even be talking about it. <br>Go dream about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> filename <br> gif <br> not even arguing <br>sasuga</br></br></br></br>  <br> become a thing and stole all winter 2015 shows attention right? <br><br>Nah that was Kancolle and IdolMaster</br></br></br>   there are actually people that consider generic sleep inducing trash like NNB to be the anime of the year   <br> Go dream about that. <br><br>You can keep being delusional about it if you want. Unless they make a season 2 or something which I guess isn't likely since Mizushima said he's booked for quite a while you'll only have people say "oh yeah, that show, it was pretty good" and it will fade away in obscurity but remembered as being good. Shirobako already hit its peak and it doesn't look like PA Works is looking to capitalize on it.</br></br></br>  <br> IdolMaster <br>Can't even beat Shirobako in their home site(niconico)<br><br> Kancolle  <br>Yeah, by worst show of the season, it's indeed no.1</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here have a reply for making such an effort of writing all those buzzwords.</br>  <br>If a show never get a sequel means people will forget about it, PA Works should already become most forgettable studio because they never make any sequel(OVA/Movie is best case already).<br><br>So your point is complete false unless no one make a PA Works thread anymore.</br></br></br>  <br> For fuck sakes /a/ <br>Pretty sure those are crossboarders who came thanks to OP being a faggot.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128414761 <br> lol <br><br><br>It was AOTS for me.</br></br></br></br>  There isn't a single great anime this season. Everything ranges from mediocre to bad.  <br>I'm not comparing quality of the show though, I'm talking about popularity and both shows generated more traffic than Shirobako. They both had more views per episode compared to Shirobako even though Shirobako had the higher ratings overall. Not to mention both sold more BDs too.</br>  <br>Well it's not really fair to say that since PA Works is a whole studio and they've made many anime, not just Shirobako. I never said people won't stop talking about it, but it's just not going to a huge hyped thing as it was while it was airing. It'll come up from time to time, and as you said in PA Works threads people will mention it since it was a good anime but I'm pretty sure there won't be many people constantly talking about it a year or even two years from now. It's not some huge phenomenon like Fate or Eva or something that people still talk about it 10+ years later. It was a nice little hit that showed Nips had good taste and as  said, if no one is going to make a s2 or movie or OVA or some kind of animated material it won't stay fresh in people's minds and they'll just move on but still remember it from time to time. The best thing that could happen was that it got a good reception and even sold 10k+ which is a great sendoff if that's the last time you ever see Shirobako again.</br>  Oh, I made one of these too. Looking back, 2015 has been a pretty shitty year all considering.  <br> no NANA <br> no Chihayafuru <br> WA 2 <br> YuYuYu <br><br>Pls.<br><br> Good to see Casshern Sins there, tho </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a close call between NNB and this pic related</br></br>  <br><br>Best original anime of the year (2015) that's for sure</br></br>  <br>the funny thing is, is that this is correct.</br>  <br>haven't watched any yet</br>  nobody thought gurren lagann was aoty?  thanks for the anime recs you guys :)  <br>There you go, bud. :^)</br>  <br>No Mars of Destruction?

Middle doesn't get enough love. <br><br><br>In a few days, apparently.</br></br></br>  <br>Calm the fuck down you little bitch. <br>It's a monthly, just be patient.</br></br>  <br>New chapter on the 24</br>  <br>So we'll have a new chapter and a new episode around the same time? That should be fun.</br>  <br>It's not like we'll get the Japanese raw, though.

The I and N keys aren't next to each other and you just have to tap I twice, no need to move your finger. Maybe if you wrote Rio or something...that's how my typos work.</br>  <br>Pretty sure that's just for effect in that one scene</br>  <br>She was real and she did help them out a lot.</br>  <br>He misspelled it for the same reason I always almost type Miku-nee instead of Megu-nee. Rin is just a more common anime name than Rii so sometimes you just reflexively type what you're used to.</br>  <br>Some people are bad at remembering names, especially for shit tier characters like Rii.<br><br>Keyword is "was"</br></br></br>  Why is Yuuri so shit? she ruined the whole episode.  <br> Miku-nee <br> Rin <br>Vocaloidfags gtfo</br></br></br>  <br><br>Right, fair enough.</br></br>  <br>It's ok, she gets better</br>  <br> I always almost type Miku-nee instead of Megu-nee <br>I can understand typing Miku instead of Miki, but Miku instead of Megu? That's just rude to Megu-nee.</br></br>  <br> These three are cannibals <br> Left is on the menu before the GGs realize what's going on </br></br>   -nee <br><br>Fucking honorific faggots.</br></br>  <br>There hardly a single instance of her being called Sakura sensei in the manga, especially after  she dies  everyone refers to her as Megu-nee. For all intents and purposes, the nee is just part of her name at this point.</br>  <br>What should we call her then? Megu? Megumi? It just doesn't sound right without the -nee.</br>  What would you do if the gakkous sought refuge in your hideout?<br> But one of them is bitten and you don't know who </br>  <br> It's shovel </br>  <br><br> Seeing first episode <br><br>  most generic moeblob shit in years  <br><br> Last 2 minutes of the episode <br><br>Wait what fuck!!!?? The fuck!!!????<br><br>WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK!!!!!!!?????? <br><br>Okay, I'm sold.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get out of this thread and don't come back until you've caught up with the manga. Spoilers everywhere.</br>  <br><br>Shit, Ok i'm out. Thanks for warning anon.</br></br>  <br>But she's cured  ...right? </br>  <br>Once you're bitten, its too late.</br>  <br>People are still doing this?<br>I mean, I hadn't ever read the manga or participated in many threads before the anime started airing, who just downloads crap randomly, even a little bit of research into the series will give you enough to know there is a twist.</br></br>  <br>I ask them who is bitten. I don't see why they would have any reason to hide it.

And we can't even blame the animefags for this one, we've gone full Kancolle.</br>  <br>You should expect it, since we've already discussed all there is to discuss. There's nothing left to do but waifupost until next episode / chapter.</br>  <br>The next chapter comes a day after the next episode, so there'll be a lot of good discussion then.</br>  <br>MII-KUN BEST GIRL</br>  <br>in what magazine Gakkou Gurashi is sterilized?</br>  <br>I started reading the manga after the first episode, realizing the art and direction isn't very good in the adaption.<br>Looking forward to the next chapter, but what I don't get is how rushed the story is, its my 1 criticism of this series, they just jump between events instead of looking into them more deeply.<br>I just think it would be good if they took the development a bit slower.</br></br></br>  <br> sterilized </br>  <br>They're doing that in the anime already.</br>  <br>Manga Time Kirara Forward.</br>  <br/>  <br>YOU HAVE IMPECCABLE TASTE BROTHER</br>  <br>oh.</br>  <br> sterilized <br>I legit loled.

This shit is pretty damn dark.<br><br>I also agree with OP, Megu-nee is best girl.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Best girl wouldn't bite one of her students.</br>  <br>Well, she  was </br>  <br><br>Best girl wouldn't have kept the bunker secret.</br></br>  Who will survive to the end?  <br>She was waiting for it to be safe to go down there.

Can't stand shit happening to fingernails.</br></br>  <br>Ah! That's true!<br><br><br>THANK YOU!<br><br>I was trying to figure out if the kid was real, but I was positive the kid wasn't, but I couldn't understand why they were treating it as physically being there despite not treating Megu-nee the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They acknowledged Megu-nee plenty of times.</br>  <br>in case you want proof</br>  <br>I don't see any short haired Megu-nee?<br>could you provide a pic?</br></br>  Are any males still alive in Gakkou Gurashi?  <br>Because she is the most realistically portrayed.  Like any 2D character, she isn't real. </br>  <br>They're all crazed rapists now.</br>  <br>Yes, crossbow-kun and the biker bros. Pilot-kun was alive for a bit</br>  <br>I don't remember when, but it was at the start where it appears Kurumi is angry when asked to wait for Megu-nee. That basically spelled it out for me.<br><br><br>I thought the screaming scene was the one that gave it away. I didn't realize those things were ears, I thought it was a weird shadow or she was clutching a corpse or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Replying to a tripfag. </br>  <br>What actually killed Pilot-kun? He just kind of randomly got infected.</br>  <br>Please go away. You are fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Did someone request the return of Los Gurachos?</br>  <br>I wanna save Yuuri and adopt a loli and live the rest of my life away in a cabin far away with my new family.</br>  <br>He was already infected and relapsed. It's implied that the serum isn't a permanent fix and needs to be re-applied. Kurumi's next.<br>Also </br></br>    <br>Also what happened to Radio-chan. That's why she turned despite there not being any footprints on the roof, meaning she hasn't gone outside in a while.</br>  Soon  <br>Well, Pilot-kun's friends are still alive so there's them as well.</br>  <br>Well I got that it's implied that the serum isn't a permanent fix as per the recent, but did not get that he had been infected already.<br><br><br>There's no question about him being infected. I was just wondering how he got infected. This scene was the foreshadowing of what we later start to discover with Kurumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So anyone?<br>What is your excuse?</br></br>  <br> There's no question about him being infected. I was just wondering how he got infected. This scene was the foreshadowing of what we later start to discover with Kurumi. <br>Fucker got bit. Same for Radio-chan.<br><br><br> zombie in a blue uniform ever <br>Yuki confirmed for sole survivor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soon</br>  <br>Wait, what, where is chapter, share pls.</br>  <br><br> sweat on his helmet <br><br>This triggers my autism.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Seeing first episode <br> &gt; most generic moeblob shit in years  <br> &gt;Last 2 minutes of the episode <br> Wait what fuck!!!?? The fuck!!!???? <br> WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK!!!!!!!??????  <br> Okay, I'm sold <br>Same here anon, same here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuki confirmed for sole survivor. <br>Either that or she dies to save everyone else.</br></br>  Being Miki is suffering  <br>You type like a fag and your shit's all retarded.</br>   Is it implied that Yuki stopped hallucinating after the plane hit and she had that moment where she was panicking? I'm under the assumption that she stopped and is just pretending, which is why everybody thinks she's more mature.    <br>Do you really need that spelled out for you?</br>  <br> nah the delusion completely broke when Yuki killed a zombie </br>  <br>He thinks a helicopter is a plane, so he's probably retarded</br>  <br>It also disappeared when she finally said good-bye to Megu-nee.</br>  <br>How stupid can people be? This entire scene was the closing to Yuki's delusional arc. Notice how she's repeating the same monologue from Chapter 1, but this time she's seeing the rooms how they really are.<br><br>She's no longer delusional and is faking Megu-nee. He delusions started cracking around chapter 16 or so and she may have been faking Megu-nee as early as chapter 20.</br></br></br>  <br>A HEART OF BROKEN GLASS, DEFILED</br>    <br>Poor Yuki.<br><br>Though I honestly want to know how shit got so ruined so quickly.

On multiple occasions when referring to the barricades it's clear that only the third floor is blocked off. I guess in chapter 5 the zombros just got through the barricade somehow. That must be why Kurumi goes on patrol so often, because the barricades aren't perfect.</br>  <br>I hope not, it seems slightly weak.</br>  <br>i taught that they at last pushed them to second floor</br>  <br>That's not a SUFFERING face.<br>That's an oh crap face.<br>Hardly comparable.</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully there'll be enough meds at the university to keep her going until they "graduate" again and head out to "work" (i.e. to the Randall Corporation) where they'll find a full cure.<br><br>...Right?</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br> Shovel dies first at the Uni, then Rii on the way to Randall then Miki at the end. </br></br>  <br> no body parts falling off while intercourse <br>My boner is dead.</br></br>  Reminder that the manga will be TWD shit for the next 8+ chapters until they leave the university and maybe even after that.  <br> TWD invented people being mean in a zombie apocalypse </br>  <br>There is one at the bottom of the stairs to the second floor, but as far as I can tell none of the second floor proper was reclaimed.</br>  <br> 28 Days Later <br> Not any of the Romero films </br></br>  <br>That isn't a SUFFERING face.<br><br>THIS is a SUFFERING face.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually I used 28 Days since the beginning of TWD is a straight rip off of it.</br>  <br>That's an orgasm face not suffering</br>  <br>Shit.<br>That garbage was the reason I dropped The Walking Dead after the stupid farm at the beginning of the prison arc.<br>The first season was great though. First episode was even more amazing.<br><br>I heard it got better later with the Governor or something, but I never really bothered.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the face of acknowledging reality at long last.</br>  <br>I'll one up you</br>  <br>It never got better. Don't bother.</br>  <br>I want Yuki.</br>  <br>The adventure game was fairly alright.</br>  <br> Then there's the Kurumi meeting Megu-nee scene. <br>Huh?</br></br>  So, what modern zombie films (or, less likely, tv shows) would you recommend? GG has given me a major zombie itch lately. 28 Days and [Rec] are my favourite modern ones.  <br>Boku no Pico has some amazing zombies.</br>  <br> I heard it got better later with the Governor or something, but I never really bothered. <br><br>I dropped TWD after they butchered the prison arc from the comics, it was like watching a DEEN adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>Dead Set</br>    <br>That's stupid and goes against the essence of this manga.</br>  <br>You have to know zombie flicks are a niche genre that often doesn't prioritize the writing or setting for good old fashion thrills. GG is an odd duck in regards to other zombie-related media.<br>That said, Shaun of the Dead, but everyone's seen that.</br></br>  <br> it's actually the 28 days later type of infection and you're the first to die like an idiot going out </br>  <br>(underground, in the bunker)</br>  <br>Do they play cricket in Japan? I want to see Miki with a cricket bat.</br>  <br>I so want her to turn to the viewer and become </br>   watching episode one <br> suddenly shovel dog reference <br>What the fuck?<br>That's not kawaii at all.</br></br></br>    <br>Ooooh this is interesting, thanks anon.</br>  <br>Wow Miki looks mature here.</br>  <br>REMOVE DOG</br>  <br>Only now noticed shovel-chan's fang. Best girl</br>  <br>Don't worry, she's gonna have to kill Toroumaru in a few episodes anyway</br>  <br>They'll leave that task to Megu-nee...</br>  So why aren't they keeping that liability with the ugly hat tied up?  <br>Yuki's going to kill the dog?</br>  <br>Isn't toroumaru a vision of Yukis like megu-nee? And Megu-nee is already dead, so who is going to kill him?</br>  <br>She's another body for manual labor. She's also not that much of a liability, her subconcious in the form of Megu-nee keeps her in line. It's not like they're in constant danger anyway, their relatively safe on the third floor.<br><br>I don't blame you for not understanding. You clearly don't have any friends so there's no way you could empathize with their situation.</br></br></br>  I want to relieve Rii-san's stress by gently makin love to her.  <br>Go rewatch the first episode. The dog is very clearly not a hallucination unless they're all hallucinating him. And like I said, shovel will do the job.</br>  <br>It's going to be Miki.<br>They don't get along, so it's the most likely.</br></br>  <br>There was a ton of situations in the "test of courage" that could've gone wrong because of her if there had been more than just that one zombie around.</br>  <br>I agree with , they are hinting it will be Miki. I wonder if we'll get to see her kill Megu-nee zombie as well</br>  <br>Why don't they all have weapons? Anything would be better than being barehanded. Even a loose plank of wood.</br>  <br>Why would they all need weapons? The zombies are really passive in GG unless you make noise or go to the toilet at night</br>  <br>Need to keep those sanity points up.</br>  <br>They're all barehanded. The shovel is just in Kurumi's head.</br>  <br>Why haven't annexed the shop and walled it off too so every venture there wouldn't have to be such a dangerous chore?</br>  <br><br>What if Dog gets bitten instead of Shovel?</br></br>  <br> The Megu-nee flash back with the   fingernails <br>What was this? i don't remember.</br></br>  <br> shovel_dog.gif </br>    <br><br>God please no</br></br>  <br>Still better than Hibike.</br>  <br>Oh right. Yeah they're probably gonna fuck it up.</br>  <br>I'm hungry, but<br>I'M HUNGRY, BUT</br></br>  <br> those nails <br>This page gives me the creeps no matter how often I see it.</br></br>  <br> In the Faculty Office <br> Such a precious dog. It seems as though it used to be someone's pet. It's fur is so clean and pretty. <br> But--- <br> Return--- <br><br> I feel like I understand what this diary has become. <br><br><br> This is likely my last will. <br> I committed a sin. <br> I wish for whoever reads this to know that. <br> About that girl. <br> It's my fault that Takeda Yuki's time stopped. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So why is Megu-nee responsible for Yuki's delusions?</br>  <br>It's mentioned in the rest of her diary that it was either Rii or Kurumi who asked her to teach them lessons, but Megu-nee didn't realize that Yuki started to lose it and enter her delusions. Or maybe she feels she ignored the signs. In any case, before Megu-nee could do anything Yuki had closed her eyes to reality.</br>  <br>This manga doesn't really pull any punches does it? <br>Thanks for explaining</br></br>    <br>It's because Megu-nee fed the delusion and was the one responsible for Yuki becoming delusional in the first place, by proposing to make the school live club.</br>  <br>lewd edit when?</br>  <br>Here, slap this on.</br>  <br> What's it say? </br>  <br> &gt;they had a lot of sex after this </br>  <br><br> Ok then </br></br>  If Shovel is infected/half-dead, why isn't her arm all veiny and scary anymore?<br><br>CHECKMATE ZOMBIES</br></br>  <br>Stop reminding me that Muse used to be good</br>  <br>They'll all die anyway</br>  <br>Because the veins are all dried up Jim, there's no blood running through em.</br>  <br>TWD invented zombie fiction going full SoL which no one asked about.</br>  <br> implying Yuki won't convert them and have them join the group <br> implying all of them won't "graduate" together and go "work" at Randal Corp. <br>Called it first.</br></br></br>  Miki=Yuki&gt;Radio-chan&gt;&gt;UniGirls&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;H<wbr>elmetGuys&gt;&gt;&gt;Shovel&gt;Dog&gt;&gt;&gt;Senpai&gt;&gt;&gt;M<wbr>egu-nee&gt;&gt;&gt;Bear&gt;Rii</wbr></wbr>  <br>The zombies have plenty of visible veins and whatever. Why should Shovel be different if she's becoming one of them?</br>  <br>Yuki is plenty lewd.</br>  <br>But how can zombies move if they have no blood?</br>  <br>Damn son<br>That's some mighty shit taste</br></br>  <br>Muse is actually getting better and making music similar to their old hits</br>  <br>Shit. It's shit.<br><br><br>Because she got the "cure". Plus I don't think those are veins there.  Also I don't want her to die goddammit. <br><br><br>I didn't say no blood, more like it isn't "flowing" anymore that's why they're so slow. Also see above.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> unigirls are all zombies <br> they eventually run out of serum <br> Shovel goes full zombie with them <br> everyone dies except Yuki, Rii, and Mii-kun <br> and also Crossbow, who replaces Shovel </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not how you do cute SoL with PTSD and zombies.</br>  <br>They got a bit better. At least Drones is not as bad as The 2nd Law</br>  Why is Miki such a bitch?  <br>Is that why zombies move around when there's no people around? To manually circulate the blood?<br><br>Now I'm imagining a zombie apocalypse wherein the zombies roll instead of shuffle</br></br></br>  <br>Because his senpai has autism.</br>  The comfiest manga  As the only fighting member among the gurashis, Kurumi won't die, I'm even happy about her new power of immunity to zombie attraction.<br><br>If the Uni girls turned out to be conspiring with evil corp and experimenting on any survival they encountered, then I'm hoping to see Shovel captured and injected with zombie virus while the rest of the Gurashis are forced to watch her turn (for suffering factor), only for Shovel to collapse, stand up, and give the Unigirls an uppercut while saying "I'm already used to that, bitches"</br></br>  <br>Because she's a hating ass nigga, hating on niggas living well</br>  <br>It's not like I'm suggesting that happen in a couple of chapters. <br><br>There would be 20-30 chapters of world-expansion, character development, flashbacks, etc. before the shit truly hits the fan and they have to graduate again.</br></br></br>  <br>It's more like moving around increases the chance of them encountering a non-infectee. Plus they're going to rot either way so why not move around.</br>  <br>If you go off TWD zombie behaviour it's just primal instinct to search for food.</br>  <br>So you want Kurumi to be that bitch from the Resident Evil movies?<br><br> As long as she survives I don't care </br></br></br>  <br>It's been implied on multiple occasions that the normal zombie shambling is due to memories of their past lives. Of course they do go after food, but it doesn't seem like they're always searching for it. They just go apeshit when they stumble upon food.</br>  <br>Miki needs to pick up a weapon already. Yuki can at least handle glowsticks now.<br>Rii is dead weight.</br></br>  <br>They sent off three of those things right? Wonder where the other two wound up.</br>  <br><br>Miki can shovel just fine.<br>And she doesn't even have any hesitation about it unlike Kurumi.</br></br></br>  <br>Miki doesn't have a shovel though, it was Kurumi's. Currently only one can fight at a time.</br>  Anyone have a better version of this?  <br> Rii is dead weight <br>She did save shovel and she's also the only so far the only one that tried to kill one of there that were infected</br></br>  <br>Point is, Kurumi isn't the only battle capable gurashi out there and that means she can get dropped anytime.</br>  <br>Glasses is the cutest thing in the manga so far</br>  <br> Glasses is the evilest thing in the manga so far <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>The two aren't mutually exclusive</br>  will Miki vs zombie Kurumi be like Snake vs Liquid?  Koreans are evolving at a frightening pace.  <br>Well, it surely is frightening</br>  <br>Manwhas have upped their game.<br><br>Looking for Father<br>Gamer<br>And a few others have good stories.</br></br></br></br></br>  Soon they'll be able to steal as good as the Chinese  <br>Scared already?</br>  <br>Are you implying that The Gamer is anything but shit?</br>  I just want DalDal to win  <br>Yes?</br>  Call me when they make something as popular as Akira  This manhwa is my guilty pleasure  Is that supposed to be a good example?  <br>Thank god, since lolis are dying in Japan, we might have a substitute soon?<br>I sure hope so.</br></br>  <br>It used to be much, much worse.</br>  <br>Lolis will never take off in SK<br>Their laws are too strict for that shit<br>The most you can hope for is that their art improves</br></br></br>  <br> Their laws are too strict for that shit <br>So is Japan's, that's why lolis are dead  please confirm it LRD I know you'r ehere in anime.</br></br>  <br>Thats not anime/manga related.</br>  <br>What, do you think I should show this to /co/?</br>  <br>Korean and Chinese comics have been pretty good for a while. Plus they're often in color.</br>  <br>Lolis are eternal. They will never die.</br>  Reminder that in the next 50 years Japanese anime will die and Korean anime will take its place<br><br>Reminder that Korea does most of the animation work for both Japanese and western animation</br></br>  They had always been OK.<br>Good authors have been publishing in Japan under Japanese names for ages; Korean never paying to feed their manga artists.<br>Personally I find their works too violent and my racist side irritates too much to read them though.</br></br>  <br><br> popular  <br><br>So qw should call you when they make something popular like narutu?</br></br></br></br>  <br>All they do is the mind-numbing inbetween work. They basically have no creative talent.</br>  <br> evolving <br>Okay then.</br></br>  Koreans are incapable of coming up with an original idea. Everything is a ripoff of something from japan.  Switching reading direction feels strange.  <br>Thats not anime/manga related.<br><br>Please fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>That I disagree, they can do violent shit quite well and people don't care about creativity as much as you seem to believe.<br>As a racist I believe Korean artists who can do sweet vanilla and creative shit are dying to get out of the country though.</br></br>  I heard there's a novel version. Anyone care to inform what's been omitted?  <br>Fuck off back to reddit you dumb nigger.</br>  <br><br>Mods actually confirmed Manhua/Manhwa to be /a/ related.</br></br>  <br>The yuri fandom in  tumblr  goes absolutely nuts over that yuri webcomic</br>  <br>And mods allowed Naruto on /a/. <br><br>Its dumb and you should go to /co/ or some other website.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a pretty good comic, genre aside. It's one of the things I look forward the most in general.</br>  i cant stand to read MC name kim jon un , hwang bee , be ol  <br>At least we have North Korea for lolis.</br>  <br><br> I am starting to feel bad for the guy. Honestly, does it get better for him, or is he the butt monkey 24/7?</br></br>  <br> tumblr <br><br>This is why we shouldn't allow this korean shit on /a/. You people are retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw most anime is made in korea </br>  <br>Was she a dog the whole time or something?</br>  <br>Me too anon.</br>  <br><br> That was made by a korean, yes, but in Japan. It is technically a manga.<br><br><br><br> A demon of some sort. On that manga some creatures with strange powers were able to show themselves and others in shapes not their own.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  koreans and chink stuff is getting quite solid, who is next to join the weeb alliance.  <br><br> Yes, we, should do what you want and not what we, the users, want nor what the current owners of the site, the creator of the site, or the people that run it rule is proper.<br> Forbid the thought that we ever offend your superior taste, based on groundless suppositions and fallacious generalizations. <br> God speed anon, keep on watching great anime like Evangelion and DeathNote while mocking those kids that watch Naruto.</br></br></br></br>  "The Gamer" is a reasonable high power mary sue story. It doesn't go overboard with revenge or selfish acquisitions.<br><br><br> Koreans are evolving at a frightening pace. <br><br>No, more like the audience's tastes are evolving as it becomes desensitized to power level inflation in the stories that come out year after year. While there have always been stories with absurdly high power levels, they hadn't been mainstream popular. However, the audiences in china, japan, and korea seem to be gradually more accepting year after year of higher and higher power levels and situations where the main character is even more obviously a "mary sue" than before. <br><br>So it is not that korean authors are evolving. It is more like the mainstream audience tastes are evolving to become more accepting of obvious mary sue characters and absurdly high power levels and stats.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shhhh, don't break their delusions that all animes are made in japan nowadays</br>  <br>You are pretty fucking dumb, aren't you? Is this a copy pasta I forgot about?</br>  <br> animes </br>  <br>At least is not as bad as the chinks and their Xin Xan, Yin Yan, Xun Xen, it's like they selected a dozen of syllables and just make combinations for every name.</br>  <br>Hardly an endorsement.</br>  <br>ITT: koreaboos</br>  <br><br> Great answer, as expected of you. Did you go to college to learn how to make fallacious arguments and dodge subjects? You majored on politics?</br></br>  I don't mind korean shit, but reading left to right is almost as weird as the names for me.<br> How fucking hard are those names to remember </br>  <br> Looking for Father </br>  <br>I'd say authors have learned how to handle high-power characters without completely destroying the storytelling.</br>  <br><br> The problem  and/or advantage, depending on how you look at it  of Korean stuff is that it is mostly from Webcomics. Some great stuff can brew there, but the crappy editorship and easy to overcome selection processes mean that more material with copy-pasted plots and crappy concept on the long run get done. On the other hand great authors that might otherwise be ignored get a chance to shine, much like how ONE became famous thanks to him working online, although that's from Japan, of course, the example still works.</br></br>  <br>That fucking hand is wider than the girl.</br>  <br>They are onto something.</br>  <br>As hard/easy as remembering japanese names</br>  <br> mary sue use that many times, never well. <br><br>That term lost all its meaning so long ago, I don't know why people bother using it anymore.<br><br> Also, if you feel like arguing that you are using it right, please go ahead and define it. <br> I am not asking you to provide example of why the MC is or not a MS, just define Mary Sue.</br> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hardly. Something like Kukuri is way easier than something liek Han-Jee-Han-Bo-Ching-a-Ding-Long</br>  <br><br> Honestly? For me it is easier than Jap names, more often than not. They are just like, two words of three letters each or something. You can just remember the first three anyway and that's enough.</br></br>  Fuck, I welcome it. More competition will make the nips produce better work. <br><br>We need 'merica to get on it.</br></br>  <br>Just Kukuri is equivalent to just Han-Jee, not really that hard.</br>  <br>The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor is pretty good too.<br>I hate the korean names though, irritating as fuck.</br></br>  <br>So it really is copy pasta?</br>  <br><br>The Gamer isn't even the best naver webcomic in terms of art anon</br></br>  <br><br> le epic surprise box <br><br>It really made your posts funnier. Upvoted !</br></br></br></br>  <br>but they're rarely coloured decent/well</br>  <br>Wait, where is the up vote button?</br>  <br>Oh, have we reached this point at last? I'm glad people are finally rebelling against this faggotry from /co/.</br>  <br>They will NEVER EVER get good at Dota.</br>  <br>I don't think so, but he seems to be having a fun time.</br>  <br>shes probably going to evolve next chapter and will no longer be a loli.<br><br>koreans have some good things, pic related.<br>too bad she was mostly ignored during the 2nd part.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All loli grow up at some point.</br>  <br>Don't remind me anon, the Breaker broke me. It was one of the best manhwas out there and then it just stopped on a hiatus for god knows how long.<br><br>Why must all good series go on a hiatus.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like their names are the same three words, but put in different orders. Soo Jon Moon. Moon Jon Soo. Jon Soo Moon. Hate their shitty names.Can't remember them for shit.</br>  <br><br> I use it as () for some reason, it became all the more normal since just pressing a command writes the code instantly. If it bother you all that much I can try not doing it anon, It kinds of seems like a total overreaction over an extremely unimportant detail.</br></br>  <br>The pacing is horrible. Its like he just explaining RPG mechanics every chapter not to mention terrible fighting scene.</br>  <br><br> Yeah, I am not interested. Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br>Looks interesting to me. Guess I'll read it. It it ongoing, or already finished?</br>  <br>Unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of life, our existence must entirely fail of its aim. It is absurd to look upon the enormous amount of pain that abounds everywhere in the world, and originates in needs and necessities inseparable from life itself, as serving no purpose at all and the result of mere chance. Each separate misfortune, as it comes, seems, no doubt, to be something exceptional; but misfortune in general is the rule.</br>  <br><br> I kind of have a hard time getting my head around the fact that you think you are getting somewhere with those answers. Like, do you really think saying "that's copypasta" is a justification for crappy logic and retarded exigences, or are you just going to go on pretending you were baiting now that you feel silly about what you wrote? <br> If you were to answer, the question I mean, that would be wonder, really.</br></br></br>  <br> tomboy <br> yuri <br>ehh...., tomboys are wasted on yuri. Its like having a trap in a het relationship.</br></br></br>  <br>It's ongoing.</br>  <br>No, I really can't tell whether that was copy pasta or not.</br>  <br><br> You must be really stupid then.</br></br>  Talking about Korean's works, how about pic related?<br> The art is webcomic tier, like most, but the gags can be pretty clever at times. EGS is filled with bitches that seem to think that the manhwa is popular due to their translation, so they have no intention of dropping of letting other people work on it, even though they are slow as all fucks.</br>  <br>No, you just post like a fucking newfag. Please lurk more.</br>  <br>And you're saying like Tezuka was original. Fuck off kindly.</br>  <br>She ends up cutting her hair too if some of the random art is anything to go by. The couple just looks like a guy and a girl.</br>  <br>Cheese in the Trap has a pretty good story with characters with some actual depth to them. The art is simple but good.</br>  <br>he did 800+ series. its hard to be perfectly original with that much.</br>  <br><br> I honestly laughed out loud. <br>Way to meme anon, you sure showed me what a true oldfag is like. Don't bother with me it's too late, go on and be a true oldfag showing people what being a true adult that knows his stuff is like and the other shit you do, I wouldn't know, of course, I am a newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, are you going to pay for the medical expenses replacing my sides?</br>  <br>Nah, it's really not that kind of dumb yuri-lite. Tomgirl gets plenty of boob exposure and such, they're both obviously women.</br>  <br>Yeah, this thing is quite funny.</br>  <br><br> you will never impregnate the girl who demanded you become her adoptive father </br></br>  There are plenty of good Manwha out there you just need to find them. The friendly winter is great if you're tired of the same old character types.  <br>Most of his stories were borrowed, re-written, or inspired by/from. Even Black Jack wasn't exactly original, as he had many of his assistance help him pool the ideas together during his Tezuka Pro days. But I hold him with far more higher respect versus Miyazaki because Miyazaki has very blurred theme and I sometimes can't understand what he's trying to tell behind a story. Not to mention lot of Miyakazi plots aren't originals, either.<br><br>And of course, most of the Japanese plots aren't original, either, nowadays.<br><br><br>Thank you for reminding me about this series. Time to get back on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I honestly laughed out loud. <br><br>Am I being trolled?</br></br></br>  <br><br>That wasn't gut-punching funny, but I was highly amused.</br></br>  <br>This breaks my heart.</br>  <br>I felt like the series almost had too happy of an ending.</br>  <br>I remember when I was helping out with Ares the Vagrant Mercenary. One of the few series' that actually had decent plot and made me go "damn, eventually, maybe Gooks really can do it"<br><br>Nowadays they're importing back in the plot from Korea into Japan, such as With God, and we have artists that are known to be Korean that's breaking entry into manga audiences  and some are shitting it up, unfortunately </br></br></br>  <br>So when do we get Aniwha?</br>  <br><br> No, but I am having a blast with you. You remind me of a 15 years old that point at 13 years old kids and call them juvenile. No need for logic, no need for a real argument or common sense, thought put behind, or anything really, but always permeate this hilarious sense of superiority from your post as if you knew better for your time, what? 2-3 years tops?, at /a/. It's a fairly common thing, though, but most have the decency to notice when they are making a fool out of themselves. <br> Go on, amuse me, faggot.</br></br></br>  Noblesse has a stupid story but some parts are just hilarious. <br><br>Kubera is just depressing and complicated. <br><br>Orange Marmalade is cute and full of good drama and some crappy characters </br></br></br></br>  <br>isn't this made by the same person who made that guy who's gay for his childhood friend?</br>  Some Korean Manhwa and Chinese Manhua have really good art. My problem with them though is I cannot, for the love of myself, bring to like the characters because of the names. I mean, maybe I just got used to Japanese names but I just can't wrap my head around names such as Luk Lee or Hwang Jae shiz or what have you.  <br>This is some nice copy pasta.</br>  <br><br> And here I thought you would finally give up. Now I get it, copypasta is a term you picked but have no idea what it means.<br> This is as good as when you fell back on fake sense of security by relying on fake prestige from the entity of /a/. Just so you know I will keep on reading your pathetic shit, but I might take some time to answer, if the thread is still up even, due to the fact that I am actually starting to get tired of you.</br></br></br>  <br>Its okay man. I already realized I'm being trolled. You are really good at this.</br>  Who the fuck let this faggoty deviantart shit in /a/. Fuck off to /mu/ you filthy koreaboo  <br>If you mean Korean animes, just go watch your favorite anime, there's about 70% chance that it's animated by Koreans, give or take a few scenes.<br><br>I like to say I'm trolling, but it's a sad fact of the industry. Look it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently it started as a novel, so who knows what got cut.</br>  <br> animated <br>They're literally slaves, what the fuck this koreaboo talking about? What an idiot</br></br>   <br>Ahh, you again. You used that same tactic to defend Kirito as not being a mary sue / gary stu character back when.</br>  <br>Please fuck off to leddit</br>  <br> animes </br>  <br> shit art <br> shit panelling <br> shot design <br> shit story <br> shit character <br> white space <br> no back ground <br>Yeah truly frightening</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You guyz really think it would be a good idea to move Gensokyo closer to Glorious Leaders in Panmanjoun and Beijing just to see what happens when the youkai hits da fan?</br>  <br>The fuck is this crap? This is not anime or manga. Fuck off to /mu/ with your deviantart manga wannabe trash, gookboo</br>  <br>The Gamer, it's a manhwa</br>  <br>Japanese syllables are just easier for speakers of European languages to sound out and remember, because of their very basic pattern of consonant-vowel pairs.<br>Chinese and Korean syllables are much more difficult and weird for us.</br></br>  <br> /a/ anime &amp; manga <br>I don't see any mention about your shitty gook trash here, fuck off cunt</br></br>  <br> that shitty art <br> dat shitty colored <br>What's rgis? Some 13 years old mangaka wannabe?</br></br></br>  <br>Manhwa and Manga are the same for all intents and purposes, the only difference is their origin</br>  <br> pulling shit outta my ass <br><br>nice try</br></br></br>  gooks and chinks stuff look nice sometimes if only their language didn't sound like garbage.  <br>it's say anime &amp; manga board, Can you read? Retard inbred gook</br>  <br>newfag pls go and stay go</br>  <br><br>at least try to be a bit more creative in your shitposting.</br></br>  <br><br> Koreans are evolving at a frightening pace. <br><br>The stories are becoming more "commercialized" rather than remaining as rough "fanfiction" type stories. That's because more and more korean webcomic authors put more effort into their webcomic stories in hopes of landing a profitable animated TV contract. It helps that some korean-sourced stories were adapted into anime in Japan.<br><br>Some webcomics are also sheparded by IP management firms that supply additional editing services. That's because the IP management firm is handling the promotion of the webcomic. If the author gets contract offers, that IP management firm will manage those contracts and thus get bigger profits. So everyone from the author to the IP management firm wins when the webcomic is improved before its publication on one of the korean websites such as Naver.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Just like american comics and manga are the same right?</br>  <br>if you break it down enough then yes</br>  <br>Not anime nor manga.<br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Why are we not discuss comic and cartoon here? Idiot</br>  <br> inbetweens outsourcing <br> animes <br>Yes, you are trolling.</br></br></br>  <br>Meant to quote </br>  <br><br><br>everyone's getting so mad doe</br></br></br>  <br> doe <br><br>Nigga, kill yourself.

He gets a broken ability, truth, but he isn't the only one nor the best one either.<br> People are always saying that MC's are deepshits that are made as losers with no talent on purpose to self insert better, but how come a character with a decent mind above his shoulders, or basically somebody who doesn't do retarded stuff, is automatically a MS? <br>Also, the male term is GS.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  all popular korean manga now are webtoon that make my eye turn white because all white background and 3 or 4 little panel.  <br>So... is he retarded or not?</br>  <br>same man same</br>  <br>God fucking damn I managed to brain dump this shit, fuck easygoing scans.<br>Also<br> Ctrl-F Red Storm <br> 0 results <br>Are you faggots even trying?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We are moving down the list, it's really long but rest assure Red Storm is in it.</br>  The fuck is this disgusting shit, fuck off gookboo.

They're tired of The Breaker and the authors themselves claimed they were disappointed with their writing. A few of us were too. I thought the pacing in Season 2 was terrible. Let them take their time and do what interests them. If you can't respect the artist, you're free to discard them and read something else.</br>  <br>Witch Hunters pretty decent and its not on Hiatus</br>  Fuck off to gook hole with your deviantart gook shit disgusting zipperhead<br>This is a fucking whole new level of shit</br>  <br>Try tower of god one of the manhwa/mangas that has my favourite storyline/setting</br>  <br>ok, ok.

Is this some leddit koreaboo raid or what?</br></br>  Hard to understand why people being so negative about Koreans drawing Manhwa or whatever...and here I thought I'm a racist.<br><br>By the way, how Korean artist getting money these days? Still off the JP market or got something else? <br>No money no future Korean friends.</br></br></br>  <br> steal <br>Hardly. They do the bulk of animation for the Japanese anyway.</br></br>  Are you people really upset about Koreans drawing comics? Or is it the name manwha that makes you flip your shit? It’s just their pronunciation of the Chinese characters holy fuck  Why does /a/ only talk about Japanese entertainment?  <br>because gooks can't into story</br>  <br> suffering  <br>Every single one of those points in that image referring to scans and scanlations aren't real reasons. They are issues for EOP and in being so aren't real issues. Learn Japanese already and spend the ten bucks on a volume of manga you want to read instead of waiting years for someone to upload scans of the raws, you pathetic fucks.</br></br>   when being a weeaboo isn't cool and hipster enough   <br>I really wish the mods would autoban anyone using EOP already. Your unwarrant.d arrogance is best suited for /jp/.God knows we already have a metric fuckton of elitists in here.</br>  <br>Not /a/ related, fuck off cunt</br>  <br>TOG became shit after the timeskip and even shittier after Batoto bent over, took down the scans and let the shitty manhwa company put out sub-par scans in broken english.</br>  <br>Because this is /a/ not /b/</br>  <br>I don't care about it being related or not I am just amazed you fucktards are still as retarded about anything Chinese or Korean as you were years ago, I thought this was contained to /jp/ by now.<br>"stealing" because they're drawing comics, fucking hell</br></br>  So this is the new trend of hipster? Reading non mainstream horrible deviantart fanfiction manga wannabe and pretend it deep?  <br>Because braindead cucks need the board to be<br> /a/ - Anime and Manga and Manhwa and Manhua <br><br>to start discussing Comics from East Asia.</br></br></br></br>  <br> same art style <br> same cliche <br> even the same design, story <br>Original donut steal, bravo gooks and chinks. Also, i remember this board is about anime &amp; manga not anime &amp; manga &amp; gook dog trash</br></br></br></br>  <br> to start discussing Comics from East Asia. <br>There are a comics and cartoons board already, gook. Fuck off to /co/</br></br>  <br> /a/ - Anime and Manga and Manhwa and Manhua <br>As someone who is multilingual, this really triggered me. It's as retarded as Anime and Manga and Manga and Manga, because those 3 are the same word, just in different languages.</br></br>  <br>I guess we should discuss ben 10 and avatar on /a/ too</br>  <br><br>But she has tits, you can't hope for her. It's an impure archetype.</br></br>  This shit koreaboo thread still not dead yet? Fuck off cockroach. You kind are not welcome here  <br>Yeah, I don't really get the hate for Korean and Chinese Comics here. Some are good, some are bad just like Japanese Anime and Manga but for some reason when it's Korean or Chinese you get weebs triggered.</br>  <br>Goes to show that there are actual weeaboos on /a/ who hate korea because Japan also hates korea.</br>  I just want Veritas back <br> other than that, the breaker is pretty good. </br>  <br> male third wheel of a gay female couple <br>I hope he rapes them both</br></br>  Wow other people actually read these shitty comics? God they're awful but atleast they aren't worse than anime.<br><br>Tower of God thread when?</br></br>  <br>I like Manhwa and Manhua but jesus christ Tower of God is the worst of them.</br>  <br><br>So many triggered weeaboos. Lol, go back to your shitty loli threads.</br></br>  <br> Koreans are evolving at a frightening pace. <br>Life... finds a way.</br></br>  /a/ only wants their comics and cartoons folded 1000 times in japan  <br>Personally I thought Noblesse was worse. I like Tower of God's art style and setting which is pretty much the only thing that makes it worthwhile for me.<br><br>Catharsis looks like it could get good though</br></br></br>  <br>Hating Korean won't make you japanese.</br>  <br> because gooks can't into story <br><br>More like emulate what a U.S. would do in emulating the Japanese</br></br></br>  So because no one care about gook shit, koreaboo must make thread like this to triggered /a/ huh? this is pathetic  Put this in the plus side<br><br>The Koreans would NEVER be able to make the same number of anime shows as the Japanese<br><br>Do they even have an Akihabara counterpart?</br></br></br></br>  <br> lol <br>Back the fuck off to /b/, cockroach</br></br>  <br> Fuck off to /b/ <br> Going on /b/ <br><br>Faggot.</br></br></br></br>  Am i being trolled? because all this gook web comic look like absolutely trash.

They need to be rescanned in better quality.</br>  Just got to chapter 79 but had to take a break, this shit right here blew my mind. did this shit blow your mind as much as mine? like this level of backward ntr just hit me on a emotional/moral level more than any typical ntr hurting me on a instinctual level. just so fucked up man  <br>Of Hana's pee?</br>  <br>More like.<br>  realize VP is underage. </br></br>  <br>Nah, man<br>VP and P are atleast 18 or otherwise, showing their nips would be illegal in jap</br></br>  <br><br><br>Pretty sure I remember reading that all the characters in the manga are 18+ actors and actresses that are simply playing underaged teenagers in the story.<br><br>Don't remember which chapter I read that though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>straight from her.... medusa? </br>  <br>Back in the Lazy Scans Days, they were notorious for littering the pages with annotations and comments as if they were research paper drafts.</br>  <br>Thats not from a chapter what the fuck? You read that off the marumaru korean page</br>  <br>In just over 30 chapters you're going to lose touch with reality.</br>  <br>Hana is 2 or 1 years younger</br>  <br>They also included pin-ups that came with the magazine, translated Hiramoto Akira's comments on manga pages, and included alternate translations, if a passage can be read in two ways.<br><br>I kind of miss knowing what Hiramoto actually thought as he drew the pages.</br></br></br>  He really needs to get right in the medusa and drink all its glorious golden contents.   everyone forgets Chiyo's birthday <br> Chairman doesn't even know why he is rushing but deep down knows he is forgetting something important <br>I hope Chiyo turns evil or some shit.</br></br>  <br> ...d-did you just <br>Chairman is rushing to get back to prepare his Daughter's Birthday</br></br>  <br>If the conclusion was that Snow White was actually Mari, and not Chiyo, then Chiyo must be the witch.<br><br>Oh boy, this might get messy.</br></br></br>  Where is the butthole? Buttholes should be okay to draw since you can argue it's not a genital or sexual in nature.  <br>It's a shame that TL Notes are vilified by the Crunchyroll crowd nowadays.</br>  <br>if chiyo turns evil it means kiyoshi can drop her and gets freed up for more interesting/deserving characters. I am ok with this.</br>  <br>Isn't Chiyo's birthday still a few days away though? <br><br> Will Mari drag Kiyoshi into preparing for it? </br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Kiyoshi would help out even if Mari didn't ask him to.<br>Then,  for petty vengeance birthday gift, Kate would give Chiyo the Ouroboros and Hana pics </br></br>  <br>Except that he doesn't know about her birthday at all.</br>  so, OU PBR Mk II, who hype here?  <br>Didn't Chiyo tell Kiyoshi that her birthday happens on Tanabata during their sumo date? I have a faint recollection of that, but I might be wrong</br>  <br>Nope. The sumo date went from talking about yokozuna to plain musubi to  Disgusting </br>  <br>None of the boys know of her birthday.</br>  <br> I have a faint recollection of that <br>What the hell? Tanabata wasnt even mentioned till 130 something chapters when gakuto said something and then again when kiyoshi was having his journey under the futon.</br></br>  What could have been  <br>It will be, just wait for the blu-rays</br>  <br>Pretty much a preview of the BDs, which will be released when?</br>  <br>I think its says 9/30 right there <br><br>right?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a smart person, thanks</br>  Next chapter is going to be pretty good.<br><br>These next few chapters will resolve many questions around the series. How exciting.</br></br>  <br> resolve many questions around the series <br>There are only 3 questions that will be answered.<br><br> Who is Andre's real mistress? <br> What is Kate's trump card? <br> Does Mari like Kiyoshi? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm predicting a Meiko vs Andre battle once Kate let's him go berserk on Mari</br>  <br>kates trump card was using andre</br>  <br>Using Andre was also Mari's trump card.<br>Andre is a giant walking card with a small face.</br></br>  will we ever find out why an all girls school would hold a wet t-shirt contest? am I just thinking too hard about this?  <br>You forget<br><br> Does Chiyo actually know about Hana and Kiyoshi? <br> Does Kiyoshi know that Hana actually likes him? <br> What is Hana's backstory? <br><br>These are most of the big questions in this manga and they will be answered within the next ten chapters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the USC was lying to them.</br>  <br>For the yuri loving students, of course</br>  <br> Your school didn't? I'm sooo sooorry anon. <br><br>My school held a camping trip and one of the games consisted of hosing the opposition. I hope that counts.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are not going to be answered in 10 chapters. Kiyoshi still doesn't realize it; this will be the main conflict going forward for the next 5 years.<br><br><br>Because it's  the Boys Wet T-Shirt Contest. They'll be like targets in a Capture The Flag-style battle royale where the girls try to soak them for points, and then auctioned off for the night to the highest bidder like the last scene of Groundhog Day. </br></br></br></br>  <br>but then what if, theyre getting chased. and they run and hide behind bushes. and the student council orders a charge to finally get them and just as everyone surrounds them, they bust out of the bushes inside a giant 5 man plastic bottle rocket ship tank with water gun turrets and just rule the battlefield, and then later on they take it to the river and hand out the reservation tickets and they finally get all their summer hopes and dreams.</br>  <br>No, they'll be split up into 5 different teams and dragged around the battlefield.</br>  <br><br><br>The time dilation is just going to increase. Soon each chapter will only be a few seconds of their time. The summer won't come in our lifetimes</br></br></br>  <br>flash news: women like boobs too</br>  <br><br>That's Kate.</br></br>  <br>MAybe he'll start adding completely random monologues and images into the normal story events, like what he did when Hana finally  pissed on Kiyoshi. </br>  <br>I was getting into the adventure of Principle Butt. It will turn into a collection of manga with prison school being a side note.</br>   Kiyoshi considers himself boob man <br> chases after flats like Chiyo and Hana  <br> only boy to never show interest in Meiko  <br>Plothole much?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you forgot how happy he was when he joined Mari and Meiko in school prison?</br>  <br>Chiyo isnt flat?</br>  <br><br> My Theories so far <br><br> Who is Andre's real mistress? <br>Risa, He's more dedicated to her than VP<br> What is Kate's trump card? <br>She didn't use Hana and Kiyoshi's photos yet so it might be one of her trump card. Hana's blackmail photos becomes Kate's Trump card for blackmailing her. They need to go deeper<br> Does Mari like Kiyoshi? <br>as?, i can see Mari respecting Kiyoshi but liking him?..nahh<br> Does Chiyo actually know about Hana and Kiyoshi? <br>She's Speculating<br> Does Kiyoshi know that Hana actually likes him? <br>Kiyoshi wouldn't even think about that<br> What is Hana's backstory? <br>isn't obvious? Karate dad and Tea something Mother (or Role Reversal) blah blah blah decency blah blah wear pants</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boobman in the Outside, Assman in the Inside</br>  Preview for EP 3<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XDh<wbr>bM0cClHE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah, and he realized that after he saw Mari's ass. He's assman in the closet.</br>  hitchhiker is Kates mother. calling it now.  <br>Time to see Gakuto's ultimate sacrifice animated.</br>  <br> Gakuto's ultimate sacrifice <br>what?</br></br>  <br>where he ruins a perfectly good set of headphones</br>  <br>what a shithead</br>  <br>....<br>The Figurine, Boy. Have you forgotten...ALREADY?</br></br>  <br>that's not for a while though</br>  So, is Hana going to win or what?  <br>No, Mari will win.</br>  <br>No, Chiyo will win</br>  <br>No, Kate will win.</br>  <br>No, shinai fugly will win.</br>  <br>No, Gakuto will win.</br>  <br> No, Chairman will win. </br>  <br>I personally can't wait for the episode where Gakuto shits himself in the middle of class.</br>  <br>No, Andre will win.</br>  <br><br>No, Meiko will win.</br></br>  <br>No, Anzu will win</br>  I feel kind of bad for Kate, the way Mari abused her feelings. <br><br>Also just like in School Rumble  dumbass main guy x blonde tsundere best pairing </br></br>  <br><br>Kate's just as much a bitch as Mari, hard to feel sorry for her.</br></br>  <br>At least she got half an hour in heaven.</br>  <br><br>Is Mari's Cunt really heaven?</br></br>  <br>He has already won.<br><br><br>The bully deserved it.<br>Every part of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, having sex for the first time, with the person you've made your goddess and obsessed about for years must be a fantastic experience.</br>  I wish to call something to attention, something that everyone has seem to forgotten. It wouldn't be right for us to just move on from anything unless we have been sure to have dealt with them in the fullest sense of the word. That we who consider what has happened until now will also have to remember that we hold the highest responsibility of remembering that the USC was, and still is an enemy of the boys. That they may have begun to help each other doesn't make up for the fact that Mari, Meiko and Hana are no less deserving of punishment than the normal student council. I see that people are starting to empathize, but this is just a case of "The enemy of mine enemy is my friend". After this is solved we still have to remember the immense bullying done from the USC and that they still have within their agenda the expulsion of the boys.  <br><br>That's what the next arc's going to be about.</br></br>  <br> implying the end is not near </br>  <br>First there is that food thing those 3 will do<br><br>Imo in the new arc Mar/Kiyoshi will have more situation like Hana/Kiyoshi, with Chiyo always a cuck, like she deserve.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, is 185 already out? Anyone got a link?</br>  <br> backward ntr <br>You ntrfags sure are obsessed</br></br>  <br>No, Cake-san will win</br>  <br>Why bullying Chiyo? She may be the worst girl for Kiyoshi, but aside from being boring character, she's nice and deserves happiness with some sumo star.</br>  Piss fetish<br><br>Never thought I would see an anime character with one.</br></br>  Prison School needs more lewd content. There's no Mari doujinshi, just only one of Hana.<br>I want to impregnate Mari, where's my hentai.<br><br>Cake&gt;Anzu&gt;Chio</br></br></br>   prison school threads are now pissfag circlejerks <br>Hana ruined everything.</br>  <br> Crying <br> Piss fetish <br>The Fuck!?</br></br></br>  <br><br>look at this fucking square lol</br></br>  <br>Why create lewd content when manga will always look way better? There is that one shitty Kiyoshi/Hana doujin, if that's the alternative, I'll stick to manga.</br>  <br><br>I just want to see Mari and Kate's scene explicitly.</br></br>  <br>Her name's Diamond-san.</br>  <br>Doujin can go further than manga<br>Like  in full details.</br></br>  What is this about  <br> Father is an overdramatic porn addict and assman <br> Sister is a huge misandrist with daddy issues <br><br> Somehow people think that in this family is someone normal. <br> Somehow people think that in this story is someone normal. <br><br>I'm just waiting for Chiyo's mask to shatter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> backward ntr <br>What does this term even mean?</br></br>  <br>are you impying they have never been?</br>  Gentlemen, there is an issued we urgently need to discuss, one which was pending for far too long.<br><br>The issue of the kind of pubic hair each girl has.<br><br>My views on the matter are as follows:<br><br>Mari: properly trimmed into a simple, pleasing shape<br><br>Meiko: fully waxed at all times<br><br>Hana: almost no hair to begin with, just a hint of something growing there<br><br>Chiyo: similar to Mari, albeit more plain than pleasing<br><br>Kate: makes it look like what she presumes Mari has, however it ends up being more base and porn-star like<br><br>Rube Goldberg-chan: full bush<br><br>Risa: full wax<br><br>Cake-chan: similar to Hana, but a bit more pronounced because of darker hair<br><br>Anzu: simple, practical shave<br><br>Complaints and criticism are always welcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a school with two repressive student councils and an auschwitz facilities nearby and you question the contest of all things.</br>  <br>He doesn't chase Hana, it's the other way around.<br><br>Chiyo is "the cutest in his class".<br><br>He doesn't show interest in Meiko because he got infatuated with Chiyo.

Consider the following:<br><br>If the pussy, including the mons pubis, looks good, then you see more of it without pubic hair.<br><br>If the pussy is aesthetically pleasing, then covering it with pubic hair will make you see less of it.<br><br>Contrariwise, if the pubic hair looks good, then why shave it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that Hana's pussy is ultra hairy.</br>  <br> Mari: properly trimmed into a simple, pleasing shape <br>this is exactly what I imagined. A nice little triangle.</br></br>  <br><br>Ah, but you are forgetting one thing. The hair and the pussy can complement each other, thus increasing the overall aesthetic experience.<br><br>Just as a woman wearing erotic clothing can look much sexier than if she were completely naked, so can the right combination of hair and flesh.<br><br>Fully shaved vaginas, just like completely naked women, leave nothing to the imagination, which is why both are predominant in porn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Contrariwise, if the pubic hair looks good, then why shave it? <br>reading comprehension on /a/</br></br>  <br> backward ntr <br>wouldn't that be a nice guy with a tiny dick turning a slut into a pure loving woman by having a ton of awful sex with her?</br></br>  <br> Hana <br> not ultra hairy <br>Her pussy called medusa for a reason.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, the reason being it turns Kiyoshi's mushroom into stone.</br></br>  <br>No, that's <br> double backward reversed drift NTR </br></br>  <br>No, in friday ususally realease</br>  <br> Didnt understand the metaphor <br><br>Jesus christ.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To be fair, he might get turned on by excessive bush.

Also, they use jap. raws which coming out every monday.</br>  So, apparently, the first volume of the manga has been officially released in English yesterday.<br><br>For those of you who want to support him, get on that shit.<br><br>Also,<br> horror manga </br></br></br></br></br>    Getting real fucking tired of these eyes.

The guy that they want people to self insert into cant be more alpha than the audience ...then why give him eyes?</br>  It's there to show his constant state of bewilderment with how his life's turned out.  It's funny they kept Miia's face from that small panel  <br>Mr hands pls</br>  He's the worst part of the show and sadly, he takes all the screen time  how can you guys enjoy this without nipples    That series is garbage and people who like are fucking disgusting.  <br>The fanbase is full of crossboarders so it's baby first harem for them.</br>  <br>So, what are you doing here, faggot?</br>  <br>They probably compile shedding and director chapters in one episode.</br>  <br>You mean the shedding happens and then the next day/half of episode is the director stuff?</br>  <br>Yes, and next episode is Ranchee's appearing and jealous Centorea chapters.</br>  Secondaries, secondaries everywhere.  <br>Nice meme!</br>  <br>Why would you care about secondaries in a harem adaptation<br> implying there's plot or any notable character development </br></br>  <br> not liking anti spiral darling <br><br>Get a load of this new faggot</br></br></br>  <br><br>First, you discard any dignity you still have.</br></br>  <br> x, x everywhere <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Posts like this <br>Are why secondaries are the cancer of any franchise.</br></br>  <br> Not liking anti spiral eyes <br>Get the fuck out of here animeonlyfag</br></br>  <br>You fags screaming secondaries left and right are just as bad</br>  <br><br>Easily.<br><br>Sheer willpower would allow me to, solely because it was with Miia,</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't that post imply he read the manga? Darling's eyes are open.</br>  <br>How does reading the manga change the opinion about his faggot eyes?</br>  <br>Are you crazy? Next episode will be the shedding chapter and Suu arriving.</br>  The horse girl is the best because she is cute  <br>You mean Suu surviving. Look at the preview</br>  <br>MCs being clueless to a specific scene(s) in general isn't limited to haremshit.</br>  Papi &gt; Smith = Miia &gt; Cerea<br><br>Debate me</br></br>  <br> Not including more girls </br>  <br>Which is why it's such a shame that she's attached to a big ugly horse body.</br>  <br>Well, sweet slime rape will begin.

Yes.<br><br>Cuter than Miia? Nope.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> birdbrain or normal human <br> superior to Lamia </br></br></br>  <br>I find it encouraging that the show is popular enough for so many people to come on and insult it. Its a compliment really, unpopular things tend to get ignored.</br>  <br>The trouble is the "character development" people seem to want tends to be things that would end a major element of its comedy (i.e. more of the girls figuring out how to not hurt Kimihito), or end the series itself (him picking one or all the girls). On the latter, as much as I would like to see Kimihito's married life, it seems unlikely the series would be as popular if it focused on that.<br><br>Also, given how the series has covered only a pretty short span of time (a couple months at most), its had a reasonable amount of character development. Course much of that has been revealing just who the characters already are in more detail.</br></br></br>  <br>Ive watched the scene like 5 times already where she introduces her, its just too adorable</br>   Yfw they skip the MON chapter so there's more Mero early   <br> &gt;Wanting to fuck horse pussy <br>No, I want Cerea not a horse.</br></br>  <br> only 5 times <br>I've watched that first half at least 2 dozen times by now, I get a heart attack every time</br></br>  <br><br> hurting MC <br> comedy <br><br>do people actually think this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> horses are disgustingunless Z-ton draws them <br>Horitomo centaurs are cute too.</br></br>  <br>I think they're supposed to laugh when he gets hurt sometimes. I self insert instead</br>  <br>Horitomo can go fuck himself after the last doujin he made</br>  <br>I don't like NTR too. But the story of the donkey centaur, the tsundere lizard and others doujins are nice and heartwarming.</br>  <br>supposedly a handsome guy makes her hot and then another centaur fucks her like horses do</br>  <br>But Cerea has a big fat stinky horse cunt, you can't get around it anon.</br>  <br>I do as well<br><br>I really want Miia to rape me and hug me so tight and close that she breaks a rib when we both cum at the same time and I impregnate her</br></br></br>  BEST<br>E<br>S<br>T<br><br>GIRL<br>I<br>R<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I just unlocked the 1500 point second letter for Miia<br><br>Can someone translate?</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna go home and re watch it and then EP 3 since I forgot it released yesterday</br>  <br>Or you know, kick the centaur on the head and fuck her yourself</br>  <br>This. Please shut up.</br>  <br>What if a centaur woman was a shotacon?</br>   two weeks until worst girl   <br>Shes a big girl</br>  <br>But two weeks for MON.</br>  <br>2 years until monstergirls invade the real world</br>  <br>this was the 1100 pic for Miia? haven't seen it until now</br>  Well the MC could be worse I guess. He could be Kampher 2.0  <br>do centaurs sport more pair of tits on their horse parts<br><br>and why is she covering her horse part chest? Her genitals is way behind her.</br></br></br>  <br>Cerea is incredibly moe.</br>  <br>Ya, I unlocked it awhile ago<br>I also have those 3 face response app things that I can post when I get home<br>And I posted her second letter a bit earlier in the thread</br></br></br>  <br>The more clothing they put on Miia, the more she looks like a worm.</br>  <br>Sasuga Chiyo Sakura</br>  <br>Imagine Monmusu with Muromi instead of Mero. Or even better, Levia-san. I mean, just any fish who's actually interesting.</br>  I like Miia, she's cute.  What if mero's dad is a serial killer  <br>Its allowed to be considered funny in part because he recovers so fast. And given he tends to get hurt unintentionally I find it a lot more tolerable than the mean-spirited "how dare you accidentally touch me" injuries harem MCs suffer in other series.<br><br>It also makes Rachnera look better so that's a plus. ^_^ I do have to suspend some disbelief though that the other girls still haven't learned better how to control themselves (perhaps if, like Rachnera, they ever inflicted an injury that lasted more than a few panels they would take things more seriously).</br></br></br>  <br> Levia instead of Mero <br><br>Best show.</br></br></br>  <br> ^_^ <br>Fuck off back to plebbit, you shitfuck</br></br>  <br> ^_^ <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  Kind of a weird thing to notice but I did too. I think they took it a bit too far in the last episode.  Not going to lie: the jokes aren't really landing for me the second time around. Watching the anime is just reminding me of all the things I didn't like about the manga like the non-entity of an MC  <br>I'm only watching it for scenes with my waifu</br>  <br>It's not just ass and tits man. Legs also work well with a good ass and tits.</br>  <br>It's a good thing I don't take things here seriously, I guess that face has negative connotations here. Consider me naïve.</br>  <br>Consider what we know of the other parents, unlikely. He's probably a human prince or something that gave up his royalty to be with Mero's mom.</br>  <br> Miia <br>They are all cuter than her.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't make sense if mero mom is royalty Then why would he give up royalty</br>  <br>Aside from parodying morons from other sites, emoticons haven't been considered acceptable on 4chan for at least 5 years.</br>  <br>Indeed.</br>  MON SQUAD WHEN?<br>LALA WHEN?</br>  <br>smith a shit.<br>that pig voice.</br></br>  <br> talking shit about Yu Kobayashi <br><br>This is some poor bait.

I don't think I'd like the manga. it feels like this show needs animation, color, fun voice acting to work for me</br></br>  <br>I feel same for SoL/comedies but most adaptations look so bad after reading source material that I'm thinking about giving up on anime and just reading manga.</br>  Front page!  <br>When I tried reading the manga, I hated himouto hamster bitch. I think the anime was needed to give her more life</br>  <br>But I've only watched the anime and I also hate her.</br>  <br>ha typical animefags mindset</br>  *sigh* As a Kanto person, I have to wait till Sunday.  <br><br>This is literally the first anime I've seen in years, I think the last one I watched was Nichijou</br></br>  <br>Nice floor.<br><br>Is it comfy?</br></br></br>  UMR HAI UMR HAI UMA JANAIYO UMARU  <br> implying <br>Bomber is literally the best.</br></br>  <br>What kind of creature is that?</br>  Am I only one who dont hate her?  <br>She's exactly like me and I hate myself.</br>  <br>I think she's super cute in both forms</br>  <br><br>ID on the doujins?</br></br>  <br> implying you're attractive, smart, popular, a great athlete and talented musician </br>  <br>How can anime characters be this retarded to drop the icre cream all the fucking time?</br>  <br>She's a brat but she's a loveable brat. I'd play games with her.</br>  <br>I wish this was a little longer webm and had the tsun moment after.</br>  That fucking OP is stuck in my head.  <br>Only on the most surface level.<br><br>It's like when you pull some tasty looking food out of the fridge only to find that it's gone all rotten and mouldy.<br><br>The only course of action is to put it in the trash.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, the staff behind Himouto is real good</br>  The first member of Umaru's yuri harem has almost arrived.  I'm guessing the people who don't hate her have never had to deal with a cuntish younger sibling.<br><br>In fact they probably are the cuntish younger sibling.</br></br>  <br> Nichijou <br>no wonder you're such a faggot</br></br>  <br>le edgy contrarian face</br>  <br>Only child desperately projecting in an attempt to connect with others detected.</br>  <br>If i had to project my sibling relationship to Himouto, than i am Bomber and she is Kirie. Compared to having Kirie as an imoto, adoring someone else cute imouto (its only Oniisan suffering from her bratish acts anyway) is healing for the soul.</br>  <br>IT'S NOT MY FAULT MY MOM DIED WHILE HAVING ME, AND NOW I'M A PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER ANIME PROTAGONIST</br>  <br> still no OP single yet <br><br>When will my suffering end?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm the cuntish younger sibling yes.</br>  <br>I'd read that LN.</br>  <br>And also my mother's soul has reincarnated in the body of my cute next door neighbour who is also in love with me?</br>  <br>BRISTOL<br>R<br>I<br>S<br>T<br>O<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking horrible.

Post them on youtube, post them on nico, fuck, post them on she show's website. I can't handle this jewry, yes I mad.</br>  Worse than Kirino.  <br> watching imouto crap <br>for what purpose?</br></br>  There better be more HImouto in this episode  Is this an accurate depiction of Umaru-chan?  <br>And no, it's definitely not because I need to hear Ebina-chan whining like a dog on a loop.</br>  <br>Well just rip it from youtube, it's not that hard.</br>  <br><br>I heard Commie was hiring why don't you apply ?</br></br>  <br>No, not at all.</br>  <br>I can't rip something from youtube that isn't on youtube anymore, retard.</br>  <br>No, I like her too.</br>  <br>What?

Looks like a production sketch.</br></br>  <br>Thankfully we get prisma lolis soon</br>  <br>It's a layout frame, probably from some bonus material</br>  <br>Just like in Nanoha and Candy boy?</br>  I'll keep the question simple, Overlord or GATE?  <br>Ainz vs Nito, neither using equips, who wins?</br>  <br>GATE is basically /pol/ + Stargate as written by a JDF jarhead. Read the novels, pleb.<br><br><br>Overlord is Log Horizon tier. Nisekoi will end before Overlord has any decent happenings.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Elf have a way to shutdown their system when being raped.</br>  <br>Fuck you. Overlord isn't Log Horizon tier. It's below it. It's just above SAO but still below .hack.</br>  <br>He still has it, but if it goes to a certain point it auto cancels like the test of his emotions. He doesn't get it back so far but he's not really concerned with that kind of stuff anyway.<br><br>But after he makes "Aniz dollars" to pay his guardians and offers them various prizes, Mare and Albedo get into a bidding war to see who gets to sleep with him.</br></br></br>  Any opinions on best BD release of Sora no Woto? I'll go through them from (what I suppose to be) worst to best but I would appreciate some opinions.<br><br>I hate pwq's sub styling and am too lazy to fix it myself so I probably won't bother with that. Bloatgirls uses Yuurisan-m.3.3.w. subs which are probably okay, but Kristen has used some questionable subs for CG's releases in the past so I wonder whether there may be better subs available.<br><br>Then comes Zurako, which has my favorite sub styling but uses CR subs. CR subs might be okay today but I'm wary about circa 2010 CR subs, maybe they're okay but is that worth the risk? Chihiro's is a definite no-go, not because Chihiro is a dealbreaker but because Femme's release has a better encode and uses Chihiro's subs as a primary track. So this is a definite option.<br><br>Then last is Elysium, which is what I'm leaning towards. They appear to be good subs on a good encode with pretty good sub styling, with few downsides, and will probably be what I go with if I get no replies, but I'd appreciate to hear some thoughts on all the releases if anyone has watched the SnW BDs from any of these sub groups.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  For the longest time I've been trying to figure out what site that is, could someone please spoonfeed me?  <br>AnimeBytes.</br>  <br>It's a sekrit club of nyaa called wan.</br>  <br>I'd go for pwq or Coalgirls probably. Elysium used YuS-m.3.3.w's subs just like Coalgirls.<br>http://diff.pics/gjTiJJciTApL/2</br></br>  <br><br>Thank you for the screenshot comparison, it helps a lot. Elysium's really does look worse in that; when viewed on its own it isn't so noticeable but with that you can see all the lineart is screwed up due to sharpening. And I didn't know about the subs, I thought they were original, but if they aren't it doesn't matter at all.<br><br>The main reason I'm put off of pwq is the subtitle styling, pic related. It's not bad but it just seems really boring for a show like this. So Coalgirls feels like my main pick right now - m.3.3.w. has never really been bad for me, but 2010 CR makes me wary and I've avoided Chihiro since they did hardsubbed karaoke this decade.</br></br></br></br>  ITT: Best Girl of their respective series.        <br><br>best girl</br></br>    H-hold me /a/ ;_;  <br>What are you talking about? Are you sure you're not the retard here?</br>  <br>I appreciate the low res because my connection can actually handle it.</br>  I thought I'd ask here, since we're on the topic:<br><br>Does anyone remember the name of a oneshot where a guy finds a busted up female robot in the garbage who lost all her memories (and who is still active) and works on repairing her? Then she's reunited with the family which originally disposed of her, until finally returning to the guy?</br></br>  Was the MC her first master or did they test her on various masters beforehand?  What are some other eromanga that have such a good ending?</blockquote>]
