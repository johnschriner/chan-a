[ This is a Light Novel thread. So, /a/, what are you reading and why isn't it My imouto thinks he's otouto.  This isn't an LN board. I don't get why LNs are any popular in the west to begin with, if you want Japanese prose just read classic stories like New Rashomon or Futaro Yamada's stuff  <br>I have never heard of MITHO.<br><br>Is it about a masculine little sister?</br></br></br>  <br>That's not its actual name. And she isn't that masculine, just thinks she's a boy.<br>Kind of like Yukimura from Haganai.</br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone reads Light novels looking for good literature.</br>  <br> I don't get why LNs are any popular in the west to begin with <br>More LNs are getting adapted to anime, that naturally raises interest. Then there's webnovel, who are free on the internet and makes it easier for "translators" to edit whatever the fuck google translate spits out. Needless to say, there are also some legitimate translations from people who most likely enjoy and want other people to enjoy reading LNs, so basically:<br><br>Increased interest plus easy access are making more people read them and some like it enough to make threads on /a/.</br></br></br></br>  Reading cute mahou shoujo spider, Kumo desu ga, nani ka?  <br>Damn, second volume already?</br>  <br> This shit again. <br>I don't care about prose nor god tier stuff, that's why I watch anime and read manga you fucking faggot.</br></br>   Reading poorly translated LN's   There's not much to read as of late, at least for me.<br><br>I've gone through my backlog and started binge reading wuxia a lot to make up for the hole of light novels and web novels. <br><br>Nothing to do. Kill me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tried Kumo Desu Ga, Tensei Shitara Slime or Kuro no Maou? All three of those are getting daily updates.</br>  <br>This _is_ an LN board. We want to leisurely read about OP protags and cute girls. It's not difficult to understand.</br>  <br> I don't care about prose nor god tier stuff <br>Then you should definitely take his advice and read Futaro Yamada.</br></br>  <br>Catching up with the Korean Zombie translation. For someone who lets himself get pushed around by the girls so easily, Ayumu sure got his priorities straight.</br>  <br> This _is_ an LN board. <br>It's not, fuckface.</br></br>  <br>Ayumu ended up with a pretty happy harem so he ended up better than a lot of LN protagonists.</br>  <br>Futaro Yamada's pretty cool. His novels are the stuff that birthed a lot of things that are characteristically "shonen" today and he pretty much invented ninja fiction, but reading it feels much more like reading wuxia, most definitely a good thing because wuxia's balls-to-the-walls insane and doesn't let up.<br><br>This is an anime and manga board, in fact. /jp/'s the LN board so go bother them, though the userbase is identical nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>So harem end? I don't see any other way to make them all happy.</br>  <br> Reading poorly translated manga <br> Watching poorly translated anime </br></br>  <br> though the userbase is identical nowadays. <br>Not quite. I'd never go to /jp/ talk about anything.</br></br>  <br> reading <br>Nerds</br></br>  <br> I post all my Japan/General stuff on /a/ because "/jp/ is too weird". <br>Hilarious. Even mods support this idea nowadays.<br><br>Quoting your fucktarded inner thoughts by the way, in case you were wondering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Manga and anime get by with visuals which don't need translation, whereas LNs can very easily be ruined by poor translation. If you ever, ever see a sentence like "even if you say that" just close the document immediately, you won't regret it.<br><br>Compare the shittiest threads on both boards (monsterfaggots on /jp/ and on /a/ those roleplay threads where the OP writes 3 incredibly thick paragraphs into which he inserts whichever anime babe he feels like and addresses the entire board like we're all playing a VN) and you literally won't see a difference. All of /jp/'s old guard has left to IRC and spinoff boards and what's left spouts unfunny warosu memes, and the same situation's pretty much played out here as well.</br></br></br>  <br>The anime make him more of a passive personnage than he really is. He didn't stole his reputation as a pervert in the LN, always tell dirty joke to sella, try to take by surprise Haruna when she's changing and so on. <br><br><br>Not an official one but that's pretty much it.</br></br></br></br>  This was a nice surprise, I thought I would get some localized bullshit like most fansubbers did.<br>And Izuna isn't bad as well.</br>  I can't believe no one has read this one.<br><br><br> I Can't Believe I Feel in Love with the Alternate World Version of My Crush After I Got Her Number in a Deus ex Machina Way While Never Minding the Strange Area Code!? </br></br></br>  <br>Do you have to shit up LN threads? They've been allowed on /a/ for ages so why not just get over it? <br><br>Finally got around to catching up to Altina translations. Volume 3 was pretty good but it seems like Volume 4 is going to be about Altina's brother and his love interest instead of Regis and Altina. They seem like they'll be an interesting act to follow but I really want to know what's going on with Regis and Altina too.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that MG threads were literally picked up off of /a/ and moved to /jp/</br>  Last things I finished up were Shimoneta volume 1, ARIEL volume 1, and Altina volume 8.<br><br>Going to take a break from reading for a little bit so I can focus more on work though. Plus Altina is the only currently running series that I actually care for and I've only got one volume left before I'm caught up, so it'll be nice to let it pad out for a minute.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't that just some plot someone made up in the previous discussion thread?</br>  <br>Every. Fucking. Time.</br>  <br>Yes, they and "weaponized /a/" basically killed the board, but even before that the board was slowly dying and turning into a dedicated space for people dumping kancolle and touhou images they found by sorting by score on danbooru. <br><br>Plus, what does that say about a general if it's so bad that no board would accept it and it literally got forcefully inserted into a dying board with a small userbase?</br></br></br>  Has anyone read CÂ³? Do they actually explain properly what the fuck was going on in that mess of anime?  <br>Stop making Keit-ai into a thing. It's never going to be a thing.</br>  <br>It speaks more about /a/ than anything</br>  I kind of want to read the LN version of Tensei Slime after seeing the LN images. Looks like Milim's visit got basically stretched out for an entire volume or something.  <br><br>I run through them daily and then I go through everything else I know of and I have quite a bit of sites bookmarked.<br><br>Kuro no Maou is slow as fuck too and simply put it's too fucking slow. <br><br>It doesn't have to be one with a godmode MC that moves the plot fast as hell, but not a fucking snail's pace like Kuro no Maou.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Does Altina ever grow enough balls to take her bookworm husbando or is she still just acting like a jealous girl when another girl flirts with MC?</br></br>  <br>Yeah Kuro no Maou is really slow paced but I guess it's to be expected with how small all the chapters are, plus how the author loves to jump to other characters for different view points.</br>  <br>At least as of translated chapters, I think Altina is still too innocent to realize she likes Regis.</br>  <br><br>It's just mindbogglingly grating reading Kuro no Maou, in the beginning things were going at a fantastic pace but once Kurono met his Fairy wife it just hit a fucking wall.</br></br>  <br><br>If we're talking about the translated chapters then yeah, she definitely obvious to her own feelings but anon said he read Vol.8 so I hoped Altina made some progress.</br></br>  <br>I don't think the beginning was all that fast paced. It was just Kurono getting mentally and physically fucked up by the experiments. About 6 or 7 chapters of that and then a few chapters of him escaping. I mean it could have taken a whole lot longer if Sariel had actually felt inclined to chase him but she didn't.</br>  I'm reading "I don't Like My Oniichan at All!" It's pretty great so far.  <br>tensei slime is enjoyable so far. the translations are still very lacking at times, but not as bad as before.<br><br><br>i honestly would rather read the LN version as well. can anyone make comparisons?<br>the art doesn't fit that well though, at least in terms of the fantasy aspect.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the author wants to try to develop as many characters as possible for the readers to care about what happens to the side characters and to hate the crusaders even more. I think he takes it a little too far though.</br>  <br><br>I mean as in development, MC gets summoned and slave collared, he learns magic and fights in experiments, and then runs the fuck out due to the accident.<br><br>Things were happening, but once he reaches the village, MC just settles in and does nothing much in regards to plot. Just SoL for 20 fucking chapters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well isn't that understandable though? I mean his entire reasoning for smuggling himself off the continent to another continent was because he wanted to get as far away from the crusaders as possible and hopefully live a peaceful life. <br><br>It's just that wasn't to be.</br></br></br>  <br>I think for Tensei Slime the overall story is the same, just that stuff got more fleshed out like usual for LN versions.</br>  <br><br>I just can't handle it man, Wordmaster has these short and sweet tidbits of SoL between the plot instead of the SoL taking the limelight.</br></br>  <br><br>it already got an anime adaptation...</br></br>  <br>As of volume 8 there's still no real romantic development. I actually think it's kind of cute; it's not like she's full on generic tsundere, and she is still practically a kid (though I think around volume 6 or so she turns 15 which is their age of majority).<br><br>I'm not so much mad at her for not getting it, just that the author is clearly jerking the readers around. Regis gets called away from their army for a while and the night before he leaves she:<br> Has a conversation with Regis where he mentions a political marriage between her and her half brother, and forces him to admit that he actually has a purely personal interest in that not happening <br> Hugs him <br> Tells him to stay with her until the morning and that he can sleep in her bed if he wants to <br><br>At this point, unless the author is a total dick, the writing on the wall is clear enough that even Altina has to realize how she feels eventually. At which point it will obviously just be Regis being a fucking putz that shuts it down instead.<br><br>It's hard for me to be mad about it because despite the fact that Regis is a pussy magnet the series itself stays away from the generic harem stuff most of the time, and if it didn't I'm sure I'd just fucking complain about it turning into generic harem crap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The SoL there was part of the plot though. Kurono was trying to settle down in a peaceful place.</br>  Found out it ended so started reading Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria  <br><br>I wish there was a better translator, or at least more of them. I have to end up reading the translations from BakaTsuki and some of it is grammatically wrong, And it's not finished. I wish could read Chinese. (It was only in Chinese at the website I was trying to buy it at)</br></br>  What happens when Japan runs out "good" LNs to adapt into anime?  <br>Enjoy your endless magic highschool harems</br>  <br>They might finally hop over to adapt the more popular manga and visual novels.</br>  <br>But they're not even adapting the good ones</br>  <br>That will likely never happen.</br>  <br>When that happens, they will go back to adapting the popular stuff.</br>  <br>Sequels.<br>Sequels everywhere</br></br>  <br> Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria <br>i couldn't really get into it for some reason. didn't even finish the first volume though.</br></br>  <br>That design gave me a boner. Please tell me the translations are updated regularly.</br>  Reading Log Horizon 1 from a convention bargain bin. Got it used for 3 dollars despite it being released earlier this year.  <br>It's baby first edgy LN, you didn't miss that much.</br>  <br>They'd have to start adapting them first.</br>  I'm currently reading Kono Subarashi Sekai e Shukufuku wo and Shomin Sample. I've tried reading Yahari, but it is way to Japanesey to understand what the nerd is saying.  <br>It's over on Sky's site so decently frequently? Translation is going through volume 3 now.</br>  I never knew reading something I already saw in the anime would be so enjoyable  <br>My first thought was that it's about a sister that's a trans, but after remember it's a LN, this probably isn't the case, is it?</br>  <br>Someone already explained it like two posts in.</br>  I never thought it would actually happen, but the entire series is almost done.  Currently reading hikkikomori-tachi ni ore no sheishun ga etc.<br> All that references <br>Also for an LN with lewd dialogues, illustrations itself aren't lewd at all.</br></br>  Fuck off back to /jp/, fucking LN shitters nobody wants you.  <br> It's over on Sky's site so decently frequently? <br>Didn't he drop it?</br></br>  <br>Translation of volume 3 started so I would assume not?</br>  <br>mad</br>  <br> Not localized Shiritori <br>Seems like not all hope is lost for professional translations.</br></br>  <br><br>Synopsis for this reminded me of Fire Emblem</br></br>  Rakudai is getting an anime next season, right?<br><br>How much is it covering?</br></br>  <br>Hopefully enough for me to see this semen demon getting a good dicking</br>  <br>It will probably just be the standard 2-4 volumes in one cour.</br>  I'm really enjoying "Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?"<br><br>Anyone else reading that?</br></br>  <br>Can't remember all the details, but here's some.<br><br> Milim follows Rimuru around and does mischief, not sure if Charybdis was awakened in the WN version but it causes a lot of problem for the people of Tempest. Took all of them a shitload of time to reduce Charybdis' hp by 30%.  But Milim oneshotted it for them. </br></br></br>  Any moon reading friends wanna tell me how the Ookami San LNs end?  <br>Sounds fun, as expected of one of the oldest Demon Lords.</br>  <br>I really like the series' artwork. Doesn't feel anything like a typical LN</br>  <br>A lot of people. I'll probably pick it up too, I'm running out of things to read.</br>  <br>Seems like the LN version added more "SoL" moments. Looking forward to it even though I'm already done reading the WN.</br>  Anyone else reading this? Pretty nice fantasy series.  <br>I'm enjoying it. I really, really want Kumoko's story chapters to connect up to the Side Story chapters but that still ages away.</br>  <br>I'm fine with it since it looks like it gave us a bunch more adorable Milim.</br>  <br> Threadly reminder that you should stop posting that because it's a thing. <br><br> https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3206<wbr>139/1/</wbr> </br></br></br>  Kino no Tabi.<br>It's okay, I guess.</br>  <br><br>What exactly happened at the end in the WN version? I'm not sure I understand. Did he just go back?</br></br>    <br><br>Same poster huh?</br></br>  <br> He did since one of those sliders from the Empire stayed behind in Tempest and discovered how to travel between worlds, so Rimuru split himself into 2, sending one part back to modern day Japan with a certain devil accompanying him. Seem like Rimuru could switch consciousness between his 2 selves. </br>  After reading chapter 62 it seems odd that the kids don't react at all to the comment about Rimuru being friends with a Demon Lord but maybe they were still more in shock about his one shot of the golem.  Should I stick to the LN translations of Regarding Reincarnated to Slime or should I read ahead the WN version?  <br>There's people translating the LN version?</br>  <br>I'm reading both, but the WN translation is much further ahead and much faster.</br>  <br>The same group translating the manga is doing the LN too but they're only at when Rimuru met the goblins.</br>  Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is some good shit. Just finished Volume 4  <br>Fug, I remembered wrongly and now I can't delete this post. Here's the correction.<br><br> He did since one of those sliders from the Empire stayed behind in Tempest and discovered how to travel between worlds. Rimuru traveled back to modern day Japan and heals his old self with potion and sent a certain devil as his bodyguard. Seem like Rimuru could switch consciousness between his 2 selves and he tells his colleague about 'regarding reincarnated to slime'. </br></br></br>  <br>Is this translated by chance?</br>  So, /a/, why haven't you written your own shitty self-insert fantasy novel yet? Do you really think you're worse than the shit getting published right now?  <br>I've started and scratched a lot of worlds in a lot of settings myself, but never went past worldbuilding. Not a single paragraph.</br>  <br>Gotta write shitty self-insert fanfiction first, then step up to the next level.</br>  <br>But I already am. <br><br>It's just that I'm a hack, so despite having the middle and end already thought up of, I can't write filler/the beginning. <br>Stuck at creating the mid-bosses and plot for the begin; already have the setting, world building, technology and cast. <br><br>Not planning to do things half-heartedly or leave plot-holes, so I've been mainly editing for now. <br><br> /blog </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not politely saging for blogshit </br>  I know I am reading shitty LNs. Mahouka and Rokka no Yuusha. I finished reading Gifting a month ago and honestly found it enjoyable.  Can someone help me with finding out the reference of the cover images of Kono Subarashii Sekai? <br><br>I know the 1st one, but after that it's a blur. The 6th one seems really familiar but I can't put my finger on what it is.</br></br>  <br> s-sorry, forgot </br>  Question for moonreaders, how do I get good enough to read LN?  <br>I hope Volume 17 doesn't disappoint.</br>  <br>You  visit the daily threads and  _____________git gud  </br>  <br><br>I'd like to know too.</br></br>  <br>Reading Rokujyouma, damn Kyoutarou is pretty good harem MC. And all girl is best girl. I hope translation can catch up with the nip source.</br>  <br>what's it about?</br>  <br>Why hasn't /a/ made its own LN?</br>  <br>Because there's no viable market for Light Novels in the US. It came and went with Haruhi.</br>  <br>They already have. It's just that no one gives a shit about Original English Language anime or light novels.</br>  <br>What previous discussion thread?</br>  <br>Move to Japan. It worked with No Game No Life.</br>  <br>Have you tried to write self-insert trash?<br><br>Requires a certain mindset. I can't do it, feels awkward as shit.</br></br></br>  <br>This happened. The sight is still up if your curious.</br>  <br>nigga I read LNs for fantasy wish fulfillment series about a fantasy series in which an MC (hopefully female) learns magic, obtains OP powers, gets a harem, and fight demons.</br>  <br>Female MC? With a harem? That sounds like an otome game instead.</br>  <br>it's kinda funny how most of the series worth reading seems to have the least generic artwork <br><br> Slime Dan <br> Overlord <br> MT <br><br>It's like the illustrators puts in as much of an effort as the author.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not automatically assuming it's a female harem </br>  <br>Tensei Slime's artist has a neat style.</br>    <br>Lately it makes me wonder.</br>  I downloaded Kikou Shoujo wa Kizutsukanai. Is this good?  <br>some /a/non did make chapters of Keit-ai<br><br>don't know how the series is or if it's still updating.</br></br></br>  <br>Really if there was any series I am certain will get an anime it's this one<br><br> Giant Robots <br> fantasy setting with sci-fi elements <br> OPMC <br> trap MC <br> anime friendly illustrations (looks very smooth and polished) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A real LN, not a memefic.<br><br>Also, if you want to talk about good Fictionpress stories, read Mother of Learning.<br><br>https://www.fictionpress.com/u/8045<wbr>92/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Errata. Move to Japan and get a Japanese translator for your fanfic.</br>  I really shouldn't enjoy Hachinan as much as I do but I'm really enjoying what's been translated of it so far.    <br>you (or he) said "LN made by /a/" <br><br>which equals memefic</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, based Keit-ani!</br>  <br>Bullshit. It's already been done. Manga form. In Japan.</br>  Where can I download translated LN apart from Baka-Tsuki?  <br>It started with a really simple OC idea of every terrible cliche smashed together, with the addition of Dante, and spiraled from there.</br>  <br>Wait, it was actually published?</br>  <br>No, there's just a website.</br>  <br>How about shitty webmanga?</br>  <br>Why "Keit-ani"?</br>  <br> 11/9 </br>  <br>Main character looks exactly like the legendary hero swordsman who saved the world 300 years ago, but is actually weak and gets nicknamed fake hero because of it. <br><br>He meets up with the angel, dragon, and demon princesses who were in the hero's party that saved the world, and they go looking for his journal.<br><br>It's a nice change of pace, with the main character being the weakest in the party, and actually having to put in effort to train and make himself useful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Keit-ai confirmed for melting steel beams?</br></br>  Reading<br> Uchinara<br>Magicraft Meister<br>Hachinan<br>Magis Grandason<br>Hello Work!<br>Altina<br>Man picked up by Gods<br>Majin Tensuki</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   LN discussion reduced to make your own LN discussion <br><br>Sasuga /a/.</br></br>  <br>Guy Jean was actually funny at times.</br>    <br><br>Altina is pretty good so far<br>still on vol 3 yet i am immerse on it<br><br>Regis is pretty good despite being a weak little shit who have his brain as his weapon, pretty impressed when he stop that fucker with a gun just by making a deal with words and actually has a bit balls to say "deals off"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uchinara seems like it will be comfy and heartwarming.</br>  <br>It's a funny webmanga as long as it doesn't go full /pol/ on you.</br>  <br>Thank you, based Keit-ani!</br>  The only LN I'm following is Oregairu.  <br>manga &gt; anime &gt; shit &gt; LN</br>  How is Tokyo Ravens going?  <br>I'm sorry, but the King of Games has spoken.</br>  <br> pointing out the obvious </br>  <br>You're rude, but not incorrect.</br>  Uchinara<br><br>finally something about an Adventurer and his daughteru</br></br>  Is there any new hot LN that hasn't been adapted into anime yet but has also been translated?  <br>Too bad no one here will read it because it's not "shut in MC reincarnated in a game world with OP powers"-schlock.</br>  "This thread was a mistake."<br><br>- OP.</br></br>  <br><br>Lots, but depends on what you mean by hot or new. Also "translated". <br><br>If you mean fully translated, almost none. Partially translated and being updated you can find a good few.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't even bring myself to run a Quest on /tg/ and you think I can get a novel published?</br>  Just finished Volume 22. Felli best girl.  <br>what series is this?</br>  reading the adventurea of rabbit hunter  <br>Nope, but it getting localized here.</br>  <br>Chrome Shelled Regios<br><br>Avoid it like the plague or else your butthurt will reach the moon, like the rest of us.<br><br>No srlsy. That blonde bimbo is like the second coming of jesus, so great oh yeah you wanted more mc ? too bad you get blonde bimbo turn your butt around *insert strapon*</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chrome Shelled Regios.<br>Took literally 5 seconds to find it with google.</br></br>  <br>Anon, what are you even talking about?<br> No srlsy <br>Reddit, pls.</br></br></br>  <br>before i continue reading this<br><br>does Felli win the bowl? or do i have to suffer another case of Wow its fucking nothing</br></br></br>  <br> does Felli win the bowl? <br>What do you think?  Also best confession. </br></br>  <br><br>Here's something extra.<br> Yes, this was included in the final story volume. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay i can die now</br></br>  <br> &gt;best confession <br> Do tell, I mean I drop the series when they where hopping around places and blond jesus was getting her new power and shit  </br></br>  <br>ah, I read that one. The translations on Baka-tsuki are pretty slow. how many chapters are translated?</br>  <br>is MG's translation still stuck on the 12 or 13th chapter?</br>  <br>14th came out 11 days ago and they said they'd be trying to get to one chapter a week but yeah.</br>  <br>it'd be nice if they do release it weekly. Also, seems japtem's website doesn't show the updates on their mainpage.</br>  <br>You have to refresh usually to make sure the site is actually updated.</br>  <br>ah you're right. it updated. MG is pretty fun to read so far.</br>  Not sure why some people reading Kumo Desu Ga think the side stories and main story are happening concurrently. It's so obvious there's a time difference between them since there's no way Kumoko spent years fighting bees after all.  <br>Basically, she told  Layfon and Leerin that if the world were to end, she would want to die by his side. <br><br>Even Layfon's density couldn't counter that.</br></br></br>  <br>HOLD THE FUCK UP<br>SHE WON?<br><br>I DROPPED Chrome regios WHEN NINA WAS BEING JESUS</br></br></br></br>  New manga chapter of tensei slime just dropped.  <br>Who else could've won? Meishen got rejected, Leerin rejected Layfon, Claribel is too much of a combat nut to prioritize love and Nina is twice as dense as Layfon.</br>  <br> Milim <br>I always thought she had yellow hair</br></br>  <br>It is now fucktard</br>  <br> worst girl won <br>fucking dropped</br></br>  <br> Felli <br> worst girl <br>Shit taste.</br></br></br>  Reading Dawnbringer as enjoy the whole galactic warfare and mc being frozen after 120 years as an admiral and losing his hero status shit. Since nobody cares anymore even though he was the one who got the crushing victory against the aliens.  I want to start reading Kuro no Maou but im kinda doubtfull, does at any point become a revenge story or does the MC do anything ''great'' or once he escapes it becomes a permanent Vinlandsaga's Farm Arc? If it has action does the MC just get dragged into it or does he take the initiative? I'll read it at some point anyways, but these days i have been in the mood for a revenge story with an assertive MC that grows through the story, something like the first part of Vinlandsaga  <br>It becomes pointless suffering, dont bother. Author tries way too hard to get the symphaty of the readers and whats worsw that it became a harem shit that its so fucking out of place trying to fit all that harem stuff beside the sufferig.</br>  <br> tfw you will never abuse your rank in space <br><br>Damn you 21st century</br></br></br>  <br>so he never get's any kind of revenge or something to make himself respectable?<br>Thank you a lot, i'll avoid it then</br></br>  <br>I don't know how the translations(?) are like but I've loved the WN for quite a while so basically... it's suffering and the author is slow as fuck in pacing but things do gradually turn brighter. Especially once you get past the initial period the story is pretty fun.<br><br>Now if you want to be spoiled...<br><br>This is the general flow of events:<br> <br>Part 1: The protagonist suffers from human experimentation, eventually escapes and finds peace with his fairy waifu but the peace didn't last.<br><br>Part 2: The village he peacefully lived in was attacked by the crusaders and everyone he knew was brutally slaughtered. The protagonist raged and slaughtered the soldiers. It's revealed that the fairy waifu is not a cute mascot, it's a yandere in disguise.<br><br>Part 3: Under advice of fairy waifu, protagonist gathers some people to try and escape the influence of Crusader and go over to the neighboring kingdom. At this point, witch waifu joins the party, at the latter parts, shota waifu also joins.<br><br>Part 4: Witch waifu has extreme talent in magic but is unable to control the power causing her to easily end up toasting the enemy and allies. She was recruited by fairy waifu precisely for her talent of mass destruction. Shota waifu invented guns by himself but was looked down upon as creating useless weapons. The protagonist recognized the value of his inventions. Fairy waifu gets jealous of the shota waifu.<br><br>Part 5: They and dozens of brave adventurers barricade themselves to buy time for villagers to escape. With machine gunnery, they make the crusaders take heavy losses. Eventually they were forced to retreat.<br><br>Part 6: They successfully escaped, however what awaited them was despair. All of the evacuees were massacred by an apostle waiting ahead of the road. As the protagonist, fairy and witch fight against the apostle, all of the adventurers were massacred by a second apostle. The protagonist also lost the battle and lost an eye in it but had his life spared.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People are born without brains.</br>  <br>I tried to read it yesterday and didn't even manage to get through the fucking prologue.<br>Then I skimmed through the first 10 chapters and barely anything happened.<br>Skipped up to fucking 97 just too see what would happen, and what did happen?<br>MC, at chapter 97, is barely able to shoot a ball of magic.<br>There's a limit of how slow you can take it.<br><br>And reading your spoilers, only sounds like that the author is trying very, very hard not to fall into the overpowered MC category and is his series is suffering because he can't write it properly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br>Part 7: The protagonist and his companions successfully escape to the neighboring kingdom. The protagonist is depressed, understandably. However he received the divine protection of the self proclaimed previous demon king of the continent (cute loli/shota, gender unknown) who also restored his missing eye.<br><br>Part 8: Adventurer life begins, this is where the story turns a new leaf and the protagonist begins to rise from the bottom of the barrel.<br><br>Part 9: The witch waifu officially joins his harem. She was revealed to be a yandere as well, as a result of the reveal, fairy waifu and witch waifu start plotting on how to kill each other when it comes down to it. The protagonist is oblivious. <br><br>Part 10: The protagonist gains more and more powers. He has gained a liking of using cursed weapons and armor because his ability allows him to control them, making them plainly strong weapons. He begins the attendance of school to learn some common sense of the world generating school antics and also fairy waifu and witch waifu turn out to be rich as fuck so they bought two horses and some high quality armor for him. In the setting, buying a horse is the equivalent of buying a car.<br><br>Part 11: Yandere tendencies escalate. Fairy waifu is now performing human experimentation, witch waifu is now performing human sacrifices.<br><br>Part 12: While fairy waifu and witch waifu are out on a journey to kill people away from protagonist's eyes, a pure and innocent princess gets near the protagonist and grows close to him.<br><br>Part 13: The pure and innocent princess was converted into a yandere that threatens to execute people for getting in the way of the relationship of her and the protagonist. An incident happens, the protagonist sets out to save the day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128682785#p128706590">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br>  <br> Is on 4chan /a/ <br> Says people should only enjoy good media <br> Goes back to watching anime <br><br>Yeah right you have it all figured out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like a whole lot of shit. Guess I'm dropping it.</br>  <br> <br>Part 15: The protagonist saves the day. However his horse died, from the effect of a cursed weapon the horse revived as a nightmare. Combined with his black and edgy robe and edgy cursed weapons, he unpleasantly received the reputation of being a black berserker. Protagonist insists that he's a mage. In the process, the protagonist's first kiss was given to the shota waifu in the name of life saving.<br><br>Part 16: The princess was NTR'd hard and became a shut in. She was bought back out thanks to a beautiful misunderstanding of what the protagonist told her. Protagonist is still oblivious of his surroundings.<br><br>Part 17: More SoL and adventuring antics. It was cut short as the crusaders finished preparations and war between the two sides is soon to start.<br><br>Part 18: Before war begins, fairy and witch collaborate to shut down other love candidates. The princess in particular was blown out with the reveal that she was masturbating using things like the spoons that the protagonist used. By the way, she herself treasures the eye that the protagonist previously lost and the witch often smells the protagonists old clothes so... no comment. The war begins, the princess is sent back home, depressed, irritated, generally makes you want to ask where her pure and innocent self went.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  TPP, destroying what we love.<br>http://mainichi.jp/select/news/2015<wbr>0728k0000m020060000c.html<br><br>The doujin market can and probably will be threatened by this.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>The problem is not only the doujin market.

The rest (of the series that are actually Japanese) probably don't have a chance due to Japans shit taste. Drifter anime would be fucking brilliant though (Assuming it gets proper budget and a decent studio, unlike Overlord and Gate from this season).</br>  <br>please this</br>  <br>Drifter.<br><br>Considering Gate and Kancolle is pretty popular, the bosses should start realizing playing the nationalist card is a sure fire way to be popular.</br></br></br>  <br>I've read a bit of the manga, It's basically not!Toradora right?

You sure make this hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Quite the opposite, triumphing over a bitch takes an alpha male. It's like breaking in a wild stallion or wrestling a crocodile.<br><br><br> Orange <br> chill and cool <br>You serious? She's a spaz.

Those types are usually fun and Pink being second best to Orange can be said to be a testament to that. Pink even supports Orange, so you which team is the team to side with.</br>  <br> Netherlands <br> best girl <br>Bullshit. They start off well and fall apart after a few screw ups, even degenerating into infighting. They're a good team no doubt but far from the true best,  Germany .</br></br></br>  <br> Enemy of my enemy is my friend. <br>But then again i don't like white either, fuck that bitch. I heard pink got better in last volume and try to find a way to stop MC's anti-love thing.</br></br>  <br> white </br>  <br><br>Oh fuck i mean silver.</br></br>  <br>you know*<br><br><br>More Silver than White.<br><br>Thing is though, Pink and Orange gets along well so they are not enemies.<br><br>Last volume that had spoilers I remember reading was volume 8. That was Pink's volume and in that was her first time being a serious heroine. She realized her position and in the end went to support Orange to be together with the MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If team Orange doesn't win, I'll riot.</br>  <br>Here, have a Molotov cocktail and some bike chains. It's going to be a harem end because Eita is JUST that chuuni. /a/ is going to shrug and say "it was always shit" but everyone will be smoldering inside.</br>  <br>Those with good taste.</br>  <br><br>Left, right is okay too though, I like silver hair.</br></br>  I want to cum all over Masuzu's delicious tummy.  <br>Was it ever satisfactorily explained in canon why she doesn't wear pantsu? It's been so long I forget.<br><br> inb4 she's a slut, whore, etc </br></br></br>  <br>She just likes FREEDOM.</br>  <br> going commando <br>I get it.</br></br>  <br><br>these<br><br>why is she so perfect</br></br></br></br>    <br>right</br>    Silver = Pink &gt; Black &gt; shit &gt; Orange  anyone who likes orange should be euthanized    <br>Orange is such a fucking shitty bitch. Worst girl.</br>  <br>This /a/non knows.</br>    That boy who has a crush on MC    Avoid the crazy.  <br>Always left.</br>    Silver is made for good hard breeding<br><br>Orange is too dainty, she'd BWEAK</br></br>  <br>Chiwa. She is one of the few childhood friends who deserves to win over the bitch heroine.</br>    <br> that fucking scene </br>  <br>I concur.</br>    <br><br>I hate to break it to you...but all dem bitches be krazy!</br></br>  <br> boy </br>      <br>Why the fuck can't we just have regular traps lusting for MC cock instead of reverse traps. Makes me sick.</br>    <br>Can you make a webm of this scene? </br>    <br>Left, because she's not a blackmailing cunt</br>  I like Silver and Orange individually. I wish only one existed and not the other. Orange deserves to have her wish fulfilled by being with her childhood love and watching Silver defrost is magical. <br><br>Fuck the author for making me choose one or the other.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't have that video in my com right now. Also it might take sometime to re-download so don't expect anything.</br></br>    <br>Ok.</br>  <br><br>Or...<br><br>Send me a download link (Preferably Mega , Mediafire) and I'll make whatever webm you want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because that's gay.</br>  <br>This is what I found<br>https://mega.co.nz/#!kgdw1B7B!vR0n-<wbr>oBBV-3Q4sZqs3VxtXDGtYlhxTblZsTB_DRy<wbr>acE</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Pink, please</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon. Will see what I can do.</br></br>  I'm still baffled as to how Silver can have fans.  <br>She bullies worst girl. That's enough reason to like her.</br>  Who /bestFriend/ here?<br>Nobody?<br>eh, it's not like I'm gay, but if dating pink would make my bro happy, I'd marry pink.</br></br>    <br>I think most of her "fans" like her unironically.</br>  <br><br><br>Alright, I'm not sure if you want the whole thing or not but here you go.</br></br></br>  <br>That's perfect. Cheers.</br>  I'd take silver and orange.<br>The other two can join in.<br>I guess I'll have them all.</br></br>  Here, have the fixed version  <br>This. I think many would agree except the filthy orangefags.</br>  <br>neither, as i am not a lolicon or a masochist</br>  <br>I would rather have Pink win than Shitwa.</br>  <br>Ai-chan kawaii!</br>  <br> ever picking retardation <br>Right until the end of times.</br></br>  <br>Osananajimifags have the smallest comfort zone.</br>  <br>fool you smash both</br>        the people who would pick left are the same people who would pick Eriri<br><br>prove me wrong</br></br>   picking left ever   <br>I bet you think Hinagiku is a joke character too.<br>Look at this guy. Look at him and laugh.</br></br>  <br>Jojo is garbage.</br>  <br><br>That's true. Both Eririfags and Orangefags are a minority.</br></br>  <br> Pretentious and cancerous Jojofag <br>The worst type. It's not enough she's a huge cunt on top of that.</br></br>      <br> Nyaruko </br>  Left is literally a kid, mentally and physically  <br>PINK<br>I<br>N<br>K</br></br></br></br>  <br> This is why NTR exists </br>  <br>I haven't seen this show. I don't even know what show it is.<br><br>Right is the CLEARLY superior choice.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see the connection other than that they have twintails. Both are best girls anyways.</br>  <br> both are childhood friends <br> both are losers <br> both are worst girl </br></br></br>  <br>Left. If I had a childhood friend like Orange growing up, things would be a lot different around here.</br>  <br> Liking a cockblocker bitch <br>How can orangefags like her?</br></br>  <br>You forgot<br> Both are bitches </br></br>  <br>What a fucking bitch</br>  Pink. The Aunt's game literally proves she has 100% compatibility with the MC.  <br>Cockblocker tier:<br><br>1) Silver<br>2) Pink<br>3) Orange<br>4) Black</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> losers <br> He doesn't know that Orange is more likely to win than Silver <br>Animefag pls. Nice shit taste by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to believe.</br>  <br><br>Cool lie.</br></br>  <br>Nice delusion</br>  <br>F unny, that is one of my thoughts exactly when I wonder why Silverfags exists. Getting in Orange's way when she wasn't interested in the MC and was only using him for selfish reasons via blackmail. Silver is seriously 3DPD. At least with Orange she is mostly a kid mentally. Silver has ill-will and is vindictive when she abuses, schemes, and bullish.</br>  <br><br><br> Cockblocker tier: <br> 1) Silver <br>Even if it's a lie, she is supposed to be MC's girlfriend <br><br> He doesn't know that Orange is more likely to win than Silver <br>[citation needed]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This show was a waste of a good OP  <br><br>Such a cute little butt.<br><br>Too bad that ram it too hard and she will be paralyzed from waist down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So? It's a fake relationship and she wasn't interested in the MC then. If she wasn't such a sadistic bitch, she should had told Orange that it was a fake relationship in the first place. But no, she enjoyed messing with Orange despite the fact she can tell that Orange likes the MC.</br>  <br>The strong always wins</br>  <br>Nice excuse that has nothing to do with the point at hand.</br>  <br>Your point? She has the right to stop the horny childhood friend who tries to seduce her boyfriend everytime because to the eyes of an outsider, they are going out.<br><br>However, orange has no right to stop the MC from flirting with anybody else and by doing so, she is just showing how hipocrite is she</br></br></br>  <br>That's why Ranka lost to Sheryl.</br>  <br> Orange is more likely to win than Silver </br>  <br>Why do you blame Silver?<br>It's MC's fault the he didn't tell the Orange his relationship was fake</br></br>  <br>Anyone playing the waiting game has no excuse.</br>  <br>They both occupy a distant third position in popularity lagging far behind the gold and silver medals.</br>  <br> Your point? <br> It's a fake relationship and she wasn't interested in the MC then. If she wasn't such a sadistic bitch, she should had told Orange that it was a fake relationship in the first place. <br>It's right there, you god damn retard. Silver is most selfish, she enjoys having it her way and causing others to suffer. It it's not even about keeping up with the bullshit relationship, but she got a kick out of fucking with Orange. <br><br>If you are going to cite rights, then by all rights Orange has the most right to be jealous and try one-up the other girls for knowing the MC the longest and for having better reasons to feel the way she feels than anyone else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ISSE NO~</br>  <br> she got a kick out of fucking with Orange <br>To be fair Orange made it REALLY easy for her. She's so gullible in the earliest episodes that it's painful to watch. You'd think she would realize that Silver is playing with her and tell her to fuck off, but no.</br></br>  <br>GAARISHU LAVA</br>  <br>Are you new to harem? Girls have their own rules and shit amongst themselves. Silver is a girl and she knows about Orange's feelings. So she is the one who purposely cockblock that hardest and most maliciously so. MC is your usual dense harem MC. He's not in the right to not tell, but the (poor) excuse for him exists in that he was getting blackmailed and stuck to go along with it for now.<br><br><br>Well, she is an innocent and naive girl. That's part of her character. But she grows a bit more later and starts to become highly competitive to the point she can have some weight in her banters against Silver.</br></br></br></br>  <br> SJW strike again </br>  <br> But she grows a bit more later  <br>And that's all thanks to Silver, if it wasn't for her Orange would continue to be dumb and naive kid</br></br>  <br> taking haremshit seriously in the first place <br>Your sanity isn't coming back anytime soon.</br></br>  <br> an innocent and naive girl <br>There's being naive, and then there's "dumb enough to think swinging a guitar around while screeching like an ape is the first step towards becoming a proper lady". It was like a crueler Kill Me Baby, but I wasn't laughing.</br></br>  <br>This might be bullshit, but I'll believe it. I won't riot when Orange wins.</br>  <br> It was like a crueler Kill Me Baby <br>Why is Yasuna so based while Orange is so shit?</br></br>  <br> If you are going to cite rights, then by all rights Orange has the most right to be jealous and try one-up the other girls for knowing the MC the longest and for having better reasons to feel the way she feels than anyone else. <br><br> I'm his osananajimi, so you need to ask for my permission if you want to date him <br><br>No wonder there are people who like orange, they are mentally challenged like her</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Orange <br> winning <br>Just like people believing Eriri can win.</br></br></br>  <br>No relationship squabbles in KMB.</br>  <br>Hint : anyone using the word "deserve" should be completely ignored</br>  <br>Both</br>  <br> but the (poor) excuse for him exists in that he was getting blackmailed and stuck to go along with it for now <br>Silver doesn't monitor him 24/7, he could have just told Orange it's a fake relationship so she wouldn't feel depressed about it<br>There's no excuse</br></br></br>  <br> Implying I would know what the fuck that is <br><br><br>If Silver wasn't around, Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem. She'll mature as she grow older, it's only natural. The one thing Silver did was made Orange developed into an astringent character, that's all.<br><br><br>You realize her being a baka coincides with her innocent and naive, right? She's like Aika from Shomin Sample, but a less of a baka. <br><br><br> Straw man <br> Implying it is about permission <br>You sound mentally challenged when you can't understand rules between girls and not fucking each other over like bitches and sluts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem. <br>And why's that?</br></br>  <br>MC's future is driven and motivated for Orange's sake. Per LN writing, you know how that will go.</br>  <br> You sound mentally challenged when you can't understand rules between girls and not fucking each other over like bitches and sluts. <br><br>Are you really an orangefag? Because she's the one not respecting those "rules" you just said by trying to fuck someone who has a girlfriend (and she didn't know the girlfriend is fake)<br><br>Also<br> gets called mentally challenged <br> NO, YOU  <br><br>Refrain from accessing this board if you are underaged</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rules between girls and not fucking each other over like bitches and sluts <br>You ever hear the phrase, "All's fair in love and war?" There are no rules in love.

He wants to become a doctor and stay by her side to treat her. <br><br><br>Shit happens in the future, dude. In the LN, she doesn't see her as a little sister anymore after Orange's advancements towards him. So, yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She made advancements because of sSilver. If it weren't for her, she would had mantained the status quo</br>  <br><br>Orange's faction in Japan have strong reasons behind their Orange end prediction. Unless the author does an asspul like Haganai's author, the ending should follow a general LN path so Orange end is most likely.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Anyone who has been following the story closely should be able to see it. Silver's arc isn't about needing the MC. Overcoming her family issues and deal with no-love will be the resolution for her character. By the end, Silver will likely do what Pink: step down and give Orange a pat on the back to support Eita and Orange hooking up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Silver isn't a bitch because I like her <br>Silverfag in denial.</br></br>   Orangefags still post <br>EL OH EL</br>  <br>The one voiced by Yukari Tamura.</br>  <br> Any ending where my favourite girl doesn't win is an asspull </br>  <br> deal with no-love will be the resolution for her character <br> By the end, Silver will likely do what Pink: step down and give Orange a pat on the back to support Eita and Orange hooking up <br>I didn't think it was possible to be this overoptimistic.</br></br></br>  <br> Orange's faction in Japan <br>Stopped reading here</br></br>  Where can I read the LNs? Are they on Nyaa? I don't need translations.  <br>Even the MC called her a bitch.</br>  <br> It is though. He wants to become a doctor and stay by her side to treat her. <br>Just because he wants in it now doesn't mean he won't change in the future. The fact he lets Silver do all that shit proves he isn't that determined to devote his life to Orange</br></br>  <br> like Haganai's author <br>Reading comprehension.<br><br><br>Just wait and see, bro.<br><br><br> Implying they don't know more than you </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think harem MC opinion holds any worth.</br>  Holy shit. Silverfags defense force stepping out of the woods.  <br>You must be new here</br>  <br>Silver always had more fans than orange though</br>  <br>Why would you think she would do the same later in the future when she feels the time is proper?<br><br><br>Explain. Even now in the latest volume he is still determined to treat Orange. So why wouldn't be stay the course if Silver was never around?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying I would know what the fuck that is <br>I bet you don't know what JoJo is either.<br> If Silver wasn't around, Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem <br> thinking like that orange dumbass <br>Black and Pink would happen and occupy a niche Silver didn't take.<br> She'll mature as she grow older <br>She didn't mature one bit after all these years, if anything it's very unnatural. She won't grow if left just with MC.<br> her being a baka coincides with her innocent and naive <br>She's a retard. Black is innoceny and naive yet very sharp to what's going on around. Orange is a fucktard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only in at nipland. Silver cunt is most hated here. Silverfags are just overly vocal and combative, just like their gil.</br>  <br>I blame Euro kids.</br>  <br> By the end, Silver will likely do what Pink: step down and give Orange a pat on the back to support Eita and Orange hooking up <br>Already went there and author said no.</br></br>  <br>On /a/? Not while the show was airing, at least. Thankfully people are starting to see sense.<br><br><br>So where can I read these? I just searched Nyaa but they weren't there. I'm a little tired of relying on the LNfags' word and want to read the novels to see for myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Citation needed.</br>  <br>Popularity rolls this way :<br><br>definite #1 - Silver / Megumi<br>solid #2 - Pink / Utaha<br>faraway #3 - Orange/Eriri<br>barely exist - the rest</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Explain.</br>  <br>There were always more Silverfags and Pinkfags than Orangefags.<br><br>The Blackfags were nearly nonexistent.</br></br></br>  <br>Silver tried to support Eita and Orange hooking up. Eita went fuck this shit.</br>  <br> Why would you think she would do the same later in the future when she feels the time is proper? <br>The problem doesn't lie on her but on the MC. He's an anti-love and he only considers Chiwa as a little sister (family). She didn't manage to change the MC during all these years, what makes you think she would have been able to do so in a couple years later?<br><br> Trusting on what a fanbase says as facts <br>There's also a Masuzu faction in Japan and they are convinced she is the one who will win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is wrong. Japan : Silver &gt; Orange &gt;&gt; Pink &gt;&gt;&gt; Black<br>/a/: Orange =&gt; Silver &gt; Pink &gt;&gt;&gt; Black</br></br>  <br>Said no one ever.</br>  <br> /a/: Orange =&gt; Silver &gt; Pink &gt;&gt;&gt; Black <br>No. You're just wrong.<br><br>Silver = Pink &gt; Black &gt; shit &gt; Orange</br></br></br></br>   yfw the Orangefag who keeps saying "wait and see" is only pretending to have read the novels and pulling things out of his ass about post-anime developments <br>It has happened before after all, see Onani Master Kurosawa's novelization. Squirrelfags' lies were exposed and it was glorious.</br>  <br> pink is 3rd <br>Orangefags go full retard</br></br>  <br><br> This is what Silverfags wants people to believe <br>Orange and Pink have always been more liked and popular.

Far as I know, the only girl that supported Orange was Pink. And Silver came around again in volume 9 to open her the girlfriend route again. Eita decided he can't pick either one so he went into no-love/harem end route. Now the girls have to try and do something about that.</br>  <br> So why wouldn't he stay the course if Silver was never around? <br>Because literally anything could happen<br>He could have met the other girl, change his views as he grows loder etc. My point is that saying "if silver wasn't around MC would hook up with the orange" is just completely wrong</br></br></br>  <br> Proxypoll <br>Nah.<br><br><br> those two threads asking /a/ </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> replying to a cancerous tripshit <br>Report and hide.</br></br>  <br>Go check the archives or  animesuki<br/> </br>  <br> Proxy pull <br>You fucked up.</br></br>  <br>Whether they like it or not, this is closest to the truth.
