It's not that bad, and even bleach is getting scans but not Samon?   Kagamigami and Ultra Battle satellite get axed <br> Black Clover still alive and well <br><br>This is not fair.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that was Oda too, many years back, and he still had way better backgrounds than Bleach when he only had one assistant (see Skypiea). He rarely took breaks then either. It was only after the nigga got hospitalized, he started taking breaks. Dont know why you're trying to make excuses for Kubo with shit like this, since almost all mangaka do the same. Oda earned his way up there and now they're giving him some benefits for making them so much money. Seems like a reasonable pay off to me.</br>  <br>Black Clover will become a billion dollar franchise.<br>And there's nothing anyone can do about it.</br></br>  <br>Bleach is constantly among the last 3 ayyy lmao</br>  <br>nice conspiracy theory fag</br>  BnHA is literally Reddit: The manga.  <br> Jump SQ is better than Jump <br> Ao no Exorcist <br>NOPE</br></br></br>  <br> 'manga i don't like' is manga I don't like <br>Wow, great observence you did there.</br></br>  <br>World trigger ranking doesn't matter, this was said months ago by JUMP.</br>  <br><br>One Piece background are fucking garbage, there's too much going on.</br></br>  <br><br>Why are you people so annoying with backgrounds? Kubo said like 10 years ago why he doesn't like backgrounds. It's true, Bleach is a manga that focuses on the characters and how they look, no backgrounds fit much better than backgrounds. <br><br>Are you retarded or something?</br></br></br></br>  The only thing that matters about TOC is knowing who is getting cut. <br>Outside of that it means nothing and you can't even argue against this point because<br> nisekoi </br></br>  <br>The anon I replied was the one saying that the assistants draw everything in One Piece so I was assuming he was talking about backgrounds since Oda still draws everything that moves. Nigga was the one that brought it up, not me.</br>  <br>for you</br>  <br>i love it</br>  <br><br>kubo still sells tomes, his wsj rankings doesn't matter since like 7 years ago.</br></br>  <br><br>How do you read this?</br></br>     sesuji wo pin at number 7 <br>slowly but surely!!</br>  <br>Actually it was also Oda who said that ranks/order is decided ultimately by chief editor, not votes.</br>  <br> and he still had way better backgrounds than Bleach when he only had one assistant <br>one assistant? sauce, pls?</br></br>  <br> Bleach is a manga that focuses on the characters and how they look, no backgrounds fit much better than backgrounds.  <br>You sound really defensive about Bleach. I can understand maybe saying that backgrounds aren't that important for it, but saying backgrounds would actually make it worse is just retarded.</br></br>  Oda already said that his assistants do all the background and he only draws the moving parts like the water, why are you comparing artists for things that they don't do?  Why are they still eating up Shit Clover  Are there any animation studios who could do Sesuji wo Pin justice? When was the last decent dance scene in an anime anyway.   B-B-B-B-B-B-BUH ONLY THE VOLUME SALES MATTER <br><br> -Bleachfag</br></br>  Nigger Clover must be put down.  <br>It's a gag manga with a couple serious arcs here and there, there isn't much to discuss. It has always been like this.</br>  <br>Pretty sure World Trigger stays at that spot because of the author always taking 1 week breaks here and there.</br>  <br>Not a bleachfag, but that is a valid point. I mean, why cut of something that still prints money? Sure, it doesn't sell like it did in its prime, but at least it sells for a profit, despite its horrific rankings. Economics 101, bro. <br><br>To be fair, though, Hinomaru Zumou ranks decently, but sales like horseshit, but I think they're waiting for enough content to make a long-running anime to see if that will raise sales. I don't know. Jump is weird sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>Because this nigga did  <br><br>Kubo doesn't even have any backgrounds so there's no point in trying to make him seem like he's doing so much more work than another mangaka that basically draws everything that moves. It's the same shit. Except Kubo has 3 people helping him touch up a manga that barely has any backgrounds, while other series have a lot of background for the assistants to work on. And even when Oda didn't have all his nifty assistants he was still able to produce chapters (including backgrounds) the same way Kubo does now without any breaks. It's a stupid comparison.</br></br></br>  <br> I think they're waiting for enough content to make a long-running anime to see if that will raise sales <br>I wouldn't count with that, look at Psi-nan.</br></br>  I'm surprised BnHA is that popular, considering it has some of the worst villains I've ever seen.<br><br>They haven't had one villain that wasn't just a generic edgy evil dude yet.</br></br>  <br><br>Is the anime or manga better?</br></br>  <br>It was popular before introducing villains, it's all about school life anon, Japs love this shit.<br>Look at Jump's recent hits<br> Nisekoi <br> Haikyuu <br> AssClass <br> Shokugeki no Soma <br> My Hero Academia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I quite enjoy the villains, and one of them is currently going through some major development. Stain was necessary for the story, and was also pretty awesome, so I can't really be mad that he exists. His motives aren't the most original, but he was well executed.<br><br>We also barely know jack shit about the likely final villain. BnHA is still in it's first stages, but it's still really enjoyable and well made. Especially the art, which is phenomenal.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime is better episode 25+ if you don't read the manga first and spoil the plot. This is speaking objectively having done both.</br>  <br>Well fuck, how am I gonna find the time for all that shit</br>  Why does Japanese media do this? Why even bring the topic up if you're invariable going to skirt around it or immediately follow up with a plot contrivance that stops them from doing the deed?
