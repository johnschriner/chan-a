[ Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #4<br><br>Remember to please take it easy and relax.<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  Hey, hope your weekend has been alright so far. Requesting my Asuka punching a vending machine after her soda gets stuck temporarily. Depending on what angle you're drawing from and if you plan on getting detailed, you can make the soda a Dr. Pepper or an RC-Cola. Maybe a Pibb Xtra. Coke is also a solid choice. <br><br>However, anything cute and decent is fine. Thank you for considering my request and I hope the deliveries this weekend are swift and great.</br></br>  Requesting Eureka in a Karate Gi, or any martial arts clothing of choice, doing a pose or something similar.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Additional Refs: http://imgur.com/a/jK9yw<br><br>Karate Gi: http://i.imgur.com/TqYZVE6.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I would like to request a drawing of Mai Natsume. Anything would be appreciated, though I'd be interested in a drawing of Mai carrying a box with her chest resting on it. Something similar to this for example:<br>https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/19<wbr>55852</wbr></br>  Request Ibuki Mioda playing outside, or doing anything outside in general. Thanks and lets all have an amazing weekend!  Requesting Oora trying to cool off for the summer, of course anything is fine~   had to change some things then realized i didnt like the changes <br>anyways,<br><br>i hope you dont mind a little sketch!<br> if you squint you can see the sports bra straps <br> also i dont know how to draw scales yet <br>regardless, hope you like it!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'd like to request Etna in some kind of fantasy armor.<br>The armor design is completely open to interpretation.<br>Otherwise, anything cute is always very appreciated!</br></br>  Requesting my lovely bassist, Akiyama Mio, for the 14 Juillet, Fete Nationale in France.<br><br>I'd like to see her either in a cute/lewd situation, hiding her body/wearing a french flag<br><br>Or as a revolution soldier storming the Bastille (with muskets and everything)<br><br>Anything cute would be good too.<br><br>And please, no joks or surrender or white flag, thanks.<br><br>Thank you if you consider, and have a nice week-end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting my beautiful Ai Nanasaki in a white gown singing, like in this video: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WNI<wbr>Pqafd4As&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m40s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Anything is appreciated though!</br></br>  Requesting Crona  wearing a Speedo  and looking embarrassed. <br><br>As always, anything else would be fine too. Thanks, and have a good weekend!</br></br>  Requesting Nio wearing a University of Washington Huskies jersey with the number 10 and either one of the school’s two logos on the collar, please. <br>Jersey and logo reference: http://i.imgur.com/cyBLqny.jpg<br>And here's a reference for her tattoos, in case you'd like to incorporate them (It would be greatly appreciated): http://i.imgur.com/HjGQwHQ.jpg<br>Otherwise, anything cute, funny, or cool would be really nice. <br><br>Thank you to anyone who may be interested.</br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Inori lying on a bed, sleeping, and hugging her pillow.  Requesting Risty dressed like this http://imgur.com/a/ALIjW  <br>Thanks again for drawing this, anon.<br>I appreciate it very much.</br></br>  Requesting Asui Tsuyu doing some shenanigans with her tongue, or heck whatever your heart desires. It can go up to 20 meters so you can be creative with it. For example she could do housework with it, maybe do pull-ups next to someone doing them traditionally, or even asked to write an answer on the board but merely using her tongue to do so. Or if you want to go more romantic have her use her tongue to grab an arm and force it atop her head, giving her a head-pat. And finally she can eject her stomach fun fact.  <br>When did the manga say she can eject her stomach?</br>    <br>It's like, by extension of her tongue. The picture in my reference is proooobably a bit of an over-exaggeration but when she stretches her tongue her stomach gets pulled a bit along with it. I swear she mentioned it too, and that it's laced with poison.</br>  Requesting Kuroneko eating a chocolate pancake, thanks in advance  Requesting my adorable Rikka in a swim suit and holding a pool floaty please, will be very grateful.  Requesting Inori in her casual clothes (green) or http://i.imgur.com/vkdCrVR.jpg, lying on a couch or floor, playing video games on a console/handheld.<br><br>Anything else is fine too.</br></br>  Can someone please draw my dearest Kotomi in a bear onesie/kigurumi?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127917542 <br>First of all! Why are you not drawing Ric Flair, what are you some kinda poor person? WOOOO!</br>  When are the rest of the final fantasy job waifus?  Requesting anything cute of Honoka.<br><br>For specifics, requesting Honoka in a miko outfit.<br><br>Have a great weekend.</br></br></br></br>  any drawfags here do commissions? i need an album cover...  <br> again <br>sorry i scrolled to the bottom of the last thread and didnt see your reply<br>no problem, glad you like it!<br> ep 1 was pretty good </br></br></br></br>  Requesting my lovely Nepgear wearing one of the Pilot Suits* from Universal Century Gundam without a helmet, preferably holding it in one hand, waving with the other, or any cute pose. Or maybe wearing something such as this* lazing around. Otherwise, anything cute in general.<br><br>Pilot Suits - http://i.imgur.com/3Dd88xs.jpg<br>Left to right, 0079, Zeta, ZZ, CCA, Victory and Unicorn<br><br>Other* http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2449495</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>I thought it was alright, too.<br> I'm still watching it where no one can find me, though. </br></br></br>  <br>   I'm still watching it where no one can find me, though. <br>you have a secret lair or something anon?</br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, I don't know if I can finish the rest of this. I'm too sleepy now. Hope this is ok!</br>  Alright, so since this has come up SEVERAL times now, let's get this ironed out to avoid more shitposting: are we saying from now on that only one person can have a particular waifu, and anyone else who sees her as waifu needs to fuck off and not request?<br><br>Between the Rikkafags, the Orohimefags, the Riasfags, and a bunch of others, there's been shitflinging everywhere about this, so we should probably hammer down a rule of some kind or let the whole thing go and request whatever, so long as it ain't NTR bullshit or something.</br></br>  <br>Something to that effect, yes.</br>  <br>I say we should just drop it and everyone can request whatever, as long as it's not somebody requesting after getting a quality delivery already.</br>  <br>Ah yes here we go.</br>  <br>I always think it's stupid when anons try to accuse other anons of samefagging, or double-dipping, or any sort of call out really.<br><br>There's no point unless it's super obnoxious. We don't need backseat Drawthread policing.</br></br></br>  <br>I say let them request the same waifu. I don't mind as long as it's not the same person.</br>  <br>No more than 2 i think.</br>   One month without deliveries <br> She most probably won't be drawn this week too <br><br>Suffering.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't want other people request my waifu. A delivery like that is simply just not the same.</br>  <br> claim your waifu!!! <br>hell no<br>there can definitely be more than one requester for waifu/husbando</br></br></br>  Requesting Futayo Honda wearing a simple wedding dress.<br><br>I'm fine with anything as usual, thanks!</br></br>  <br>No offense but as the resident waifufag for my character, I'd be pretty annoyed if I saw 2-3 other retards spamming her in the thread.</br>  File size is too big, so here's a reference link. http://i.imgur.com/YJnFNEJh.jpg<br>Here's some kimono references, too.<br><br>Hey drawfriends, hope your day is going splendidly. Requesting Isma wearing a kimono or yukata with a big smile on her face. Preferably one with a watery/liquidy pattern, as she is a merrow. Also her wearing a traditional fox mask thingy on the side of her head would be cool, but that's optional. <br><br>I'm going to sleep, now. If an anon would do this for me I would be more than happy! Thank you in advance!</br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Kneesocks, anything goes.<br>Her making different expressions would be nice, something happy, angry, in laughter or confused. Stuff like that.</br>  <br> fuckin sweet man </br>  <br>How was it that Kneesocks and Stocking were objectively better than their respective sisters?</br>  <br>Yeah you're right, sorry bout that.</br>  <br><br>This, I'm "the" person who requests my waifu. I'd be fucking annoyed if some dunkfaggot or somebody came along to the thread requesting shit. Those kinds of people should be ignored, especially if there's already a person here who requests her. Luckily, everyone does ignore it when someone else does, but the point still stands.</br></br>  <br>http://objection.mrdictionary.net/g<wbr>o.php?n=7984651</wbr></br>  Requesting Yukino, everything is fine.<br>Thanks in advance!</br>  <br>It's all good man, I'd be skeptical too if someone told me their waifu could throw up their own stomach!</br>  Requesting Pyrrha Alexandra in a Guildie uniform!<br><br>for a different reference you can use:<br>http://exhentai.org/g/484135/0d5f83<wbr>c941/<br><br>lets all hope for a wonderful draw day today!</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>fell free to re-request</br></br>  <br> these awesome Tenryuu deliveries  <br>He's been on a roll for a while now, I'm jealous</br></br>  <br>Damn that's a good delivery.</br>    <br>That's the power of nice legs.<br>Didn't hurt that Panty is objectively shit.</br></br>  <br>Pretty nice at first glance, but her legs and torso are all kinds of fucked up.</br>    <br>Fantastic delivery, OR will definitely be happy.</br>  Requesting waifu's with their hair cut for the summer.  <br>No, her hair is beautiful. I won't allow.</br>  Requesting Makoto eating a parfait.<br>Wearing her casual clothes, or a sundress, either way is fine with me.<br>http://i.imgur.com/SeCoHJA.png<br>http://i.imgur.com/iwfGt.jpg<br><br>Please and thank you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My waifu has short hair, though.</br>  Despair is rapidly increasing.  <br>who is she?</br>  <br><br>It's ok, she'll be drawn anon.</br></br>  <br>Ibukifag is that you?</br>  <br>Who is it?</br>  Requesting her with an unbuttoned T-shirt and boxers in this pose<br>http://imgur.com/LQQOYUP</br>  <br>More Tenryuu.</br>  <br> more cute as fuck Tenryuu deliveries  <br>I-i'm not jealous!</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>It's been 3 weeks, but I know she won't be drawn this week too, that's why I said "one month"<br>And I won't give her name, I want deliveries because they wanted to draw her, not pity deliveries.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Lila from Yozakura Quartet!  Requesting Sensei, anything cute is fine! Please and thank you!  <br>As long as it's less than 4 people requesting the same waifu it's not too jarring. <br><br>But if you enter the thread and see somebody requested your waifu:<br> Do they have a good reference pic or is it just one cropped image/screencap? <br> Are they requesting something I like and would be fine with it? <br><br>If somebody already posted a request you'd enjoy there's no need to request again. Some requesters are more memorable than others with their behavior but that's it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So we are up from 3 to 4 now?</br>  <br> number slowly climbing <br>Let's just say everyone can request ten times with different images.</br></br>  <br>If there's already a resident guy with that character, then fuck off somewhere else.<br><br>A second guy will bother the original guy, and drawfags because they won't know if it's another guy, or a rerequest.</br></br></br>  <br>More than 2 people is already jarring.</br>  <br><br>Well I was going with &lt;4, not &lt;=4 if you mean that, but hard to pinpoint, at 4 it gets annoying. 3 I can barely look over, but there's no reason for 3 times unless the others are trolling you.</br></br>  <br>I agree, 15 is a good number.</br>  <br><br>20 requesters per waifu? Sounds good.</br></br>  <br>Hell, why don't we all have the same waifu while we're at it?</br>  <br>I initially requested for three years until she got drawn at all. Be patient.</br>  Requesting Mizuha!<br>Optional: Wearing a basketball jersey, or tending to some flowers.</br>  <br> everyone has the same waifu <br> nobody is left out <br>Perfect!</br></br></br>  <br>Waifu-tan is pretty cute.</br>  <br><br><br>Wait how do we combine our individual tastes into one perfect waifu for all?</br></br></br>    <br>That's what Waifu-tan is, bro.</br>  Since this month is the 10 years anniversary of Akari and I, I would like to requests something related to it, if you don't mind!<br>Maybe something like a POV of Akari in a beautiful evening dress and in front of a table with champagne cups in front of her and her with a beautiful smile?<br><br>Though to be honest, I'd be okay with anything as long as Akari is happy but please nothing too lewd!<br><br>In any cases, thank you very much if you pick this up!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We straw poll our ideas. Ones with most votes get requested. You can't vote for your own.</br>    <br>That's pretty nice, thank you!</br>  <br>Hell yeah thanks drawfriend!<br>Now that's a cool looking axe and the color scheme is very fitting and pleasant to look at.<br>Love the uniform and the battle stance you picked, really great job.<br>Thanks again and hope you have a great weekend! You deserve it.</br></br></br></br>   drawfriend posted a wip last weekend and said he continue later <br> haven't heard anything since <br>Do I panic or keep being patient? I'd like to keep being patient.</br></br>  <br>Previous thread died quickly after I posted so I just wanted to thank you again for drawing her.</br>  <br>Here you go. Have a nice weekend</br>  <br>Good things come to those who wait.</br>  <br>Now you're just encouraging him.</br>  <br> Drawing for someone who don't even know the name of the character <br><br>why</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127919233 <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Why does that even matter? As long as a drawing of a person is given and you like it, that's all that matters. Sure, someone acting like an ass puts a shit name on you and your waifu but the only thing that should be prevented, as far as I see, are people posting numerous request by people with the same waifu.<br><br> we should probably hammer down a rule <br>With what authority?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's nothing new. People draw for obvious trolls, too.</br>  <br>My apologies. Unfortunately, I cannot yet delete my post, since it's too early, and I was AFK while I waited for the image to upload. <br><br><br>She's very cute. I love the little detail of her twirling her hair. Wonder what she's reading though. Have a good weekend, anon. And thanks for giving me a chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I won't be able to color this, my hand was getting pretty shaky towards the end of doing this lineart. Not quite good enough to power through 8 hours of drawing  yet <br><br>Have a good weekend!</br></br></br>  <br>What's her name? I want to tag your delivery for you.</br>  <br>Whoa. Nice paint work, Boa.<br>It's cool to see you using alternate methods.</br></br>  <br>Read the filename</br>  requesting, anything is fine  <br>That's not her name!<br><br>Fuck off to the general already, geez.</br></br></br>  <br>You sound angry, anon. Calm down.</br>  <br>What's your problem?</br>  <br>Relax man`</br>  <br>Why so salty?</br>  <br>Someone else requests my waifu every weekend, I don't see the issue with it, and even if I don't like their ideas, I still get more cute pics of my waifu regardless. I don't see any reason to request more than once per waifu, it just seems like clutter and an easy way to cheat the re-request system we have down.<br> Though not being greedy, and having the ability to draw her myself, probably helps my decision immensely. </br></br>  <br>On it.</br>  If someone else started requesting my waifu I'd fight them to the death.  <br>Good luck doing that over the internet.</br>  <br>You know I was thinking of a collage idea where it'd be a gladiator rink, with two anons fighting and a whole bunch of waifus in the stadium, cheering and such.</br>  <br>That's my man. I like you.<br><br>Good thing no one else has my girl as their waifu.</br></br></br>  Requesting Mao on a motorcycle!  <br>This guy right here knows what's up.</br>  <br>I recognize that dick</br>  <br>Cock and balls included?</br>  <br>reminder, shes not going to be drawn, because you act like this</br>  <br>She canonically does not have balls. The only downside of Boshi's work.</br>  <br> futa with balls <br>Don't be stupid. Everyone knows semem comes from the soul with futas, no need for balls</br></br>  <br>I know, but hey, maybe you're into that sort of thing. I'm not judging.</br>  <br>Don't make this gay.</br>  <br>Good thing you can't draw so you have no say in that.</br>  <br> downside <br><br>You're a faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, a little girl like you shouldn't be lusting over such big dicks, especially not girls with dicks.</br>      <br>Come on Boshi, grow a pair.<br>Draw some nuts.</br></br>  Requesting Minatsu wearing a nontraditional miko outfit. Visible midriff and making her ribbons match the outit is a plus.<br>Anything else is fine too, thanks!</br>  <br>That's adorable,  but you forgot her facepaint. </br>  <br>Yeah, that's what I said here <br> and the only valid answer.</br></br>  Requesting Pamela wearing a cute and frilly yet sexy and form-fitting qipao with an exposed chest and leg slit please! Thanks in advance!  Requesting Ikachan wearing a tank top and shorty shorts with the bottom's ripped like the images to the right. If you can't replicate it then use the reference to the bottom left  <br>What is this reference</br>  Requesting stupid sexy Snufkin  Just came by to thank Pokemon anon again for drawing her. Words can not accurately describe how cute she is here, just thanking you once isn't enough.  Requesting Shion eating a slice of pizza<br>Anything cute of her is fine<br>Thanks in advance</br></br>  Can't believe I missed a whole thread<br><br>Thank you very much for this yokura! I was expecting just something simple, but these thighhighs you did are very cute, love the little ribbon. I just wish I could have watched you stream to suggest her hair to look more puffy<br>Anyway, thank you again and have a nice weekend!</br></br></br>  Humbly requesting mon amour. <br><br>If possible, I'd like to request her either swimming or her lounging by the pool while a maid (Kikuno preferred) brings her a drink. <br><br>I'd be most appreciative if she were drawn, thank you!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now you're just attentionwhoring.</br>  <br>Nah, you said they should bugger off, the correct thing to do is to acknowledge their good taste, then engage them in honorable combat, as there can be only one.</br>  Requesting Sakuya as animal girl preferably dog. Anything cute is fine as well.  <br> actually having a waifu  <br> telling someone requesting her they have "good taste" <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks great and the legs look nice and healthy.</br>  127920088<br>Are you saying your waifu is crap? I can acknowledge that someone could love her due to her perfection, but they can't be allowed to live</br>  <br> I can acknowledge that someone could love her <br>That's your problem. Even acknowledging that anyone could care about her 1% of how much you do is for fucking faggots.<br><br>Don't fucking imply I'd ever say that about my waifu.</br></br></br></br>  Morning /a/! Got a couple of ideas this week.<br><br>Requesting my waifu dressed as Saber Alter! Preferably in an action pose like, swinging her sword. Bonus points for a stern or empty expression!<br><br>Something cool with her dressed as Link using any of his equipment! Master Sword, boomerang, bombs, spinner, Rod of Seasons, Ball and Chain... anything you can think of!<br>Or something funny with her getting frustrated at the Hakuou Three Amiga as annoying fairies.<br><br>Something cute and simple with Hinagiku wearing a sweater would be nice. Maybe even a keyhole sweater.<br>Or something that fits summer better, like having her hair tied up, wearing only an oversized t-shirt  cute or lewd-ish are both okay! <br><br>Cooling off poolside in a bikini, kicking at the water! Perhaps a Canada day theme for the swimsuit?<br><br>Please and thanks as always!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Attention whoring.</br>  <br> as there can be only one. <br><br>You know it's just your delusions, right? There is no way that you would be the only person having certain character as wifu.</br></br></br>  <br>It's shitposting. Anyone that would say having a huge drawn out argument in a thread where you go to get drawings is shitposting.<br>If you want that, go to the neo waifu threads where it's all about how much they ""love"" their ""waifu"".</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself, retard. Only one man could possibly love her this much, and I'm him.<br><br> Neo <br/></br></br></br>  <br>Now I know you're trolling.</br>  <br>And I know you're a shitposting /v/ermin. We're even.<br><br>I'm not the original guy, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br> go to the neo waifu threads where it's all about how much they ""love"" their ""waifu"". <br>You know I see two different dynamics to those threads. One just like you say, kinda just showcasing like "look look I loooove my waifu look!" But at the same time it feels nice to let it all out. I posted there once with my waifu, answered all the questions honestly and it made me felt good, made the love I have for her even more solid than it already is. Honestly, who wouldn't want to proudly proclaim love to their waifu?</br></br>  <br>How much of the answers to those questions did you pull out of your ass?<br>The answer should be less than one.</br></br>  <br> who wouldn't want to proudly proclaim love to their waifu? <br>The majority of the people in these threads who think waifu = favorite character to masturbate to, and they get really defensive and aggressive whenever someone starts talking about actual waifu stuff because it makes them feel left out.</br></br>  <br> How much of the answers to those questions did you pull out of your ass? <br>What? I just answered the questions asked in the thread, except for ones that I actually couldn't due to her not being THAT fleshed out of a character.</br></br>  <br>Sure is /v/ in here</br>  <br>Good for you, you were probably the only person in that thread to not push their headcanon onto the character they posted.</br>  <br>His next post will be crying about how everyone in the "neo threads" are just "headcanon faggots" because they like thinking about their waifu instead of just sucking dicks weekly for shitty sketches of the girl they're jerking off to this month.</br>  <br> Only one man could possibly love her this much, and I'm him. <br><br>So you actually think that there is no another guy who feels in the same way as you do? You either are trolling or autistic as fuck.<br><br><br>I'm pretty certain that it's just ryuocuck's shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> push their headcanon onto the character they posted. <br><br> "headcanon faggots" <br> 2 seconds <br>It's like magic</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This so much. I love talking about my waifu because I love her, and whenever a question gets asked that doesn't follow her personality I say so.</br>  Requesting WIPs and kisses  <br><br>Pffft. Yeah, like I said. These bitches will scream and cry at anyone DARING to think deeply about their waifu, and how she'd react to different situations because he's a MUH FAVORITE CHARACTER tard from /v/ who thinks "real waifufags" are autistic or something. <br><br>There's literally nothing wrong with trying to think deeply about your waifu, and her personality.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Akame as an Anubis Monstergirl.  <br>Pretty much this for me as well.</br>  <br> ESL <br> Jojoshit <br> retards who don't have waifus crying that anyone who likes posting about her is a headcanon sperg <br>I've had enough /v/ for one weekend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know who the first guy I replied to was, but he was shitposting so I stopped.<br>The second one I was having a conversation with.</br></br>  <br>Always the same shit. My waifu is never shown brushing her teeth. Is it headcanon to assume she does? Fucking /v/ermin dipshit.</br>  <br/>  <br>I think her right arm is a little fucked, but the rest of her body composition is nice.</br>  Ririchan  <br>What about her?</br>  If two people have the same waifu and one of them gets a delivery is it still okay for the other to request? It doesn't feel right calling someone elses delivery yours.  <br>You don't have to call it your delivery, or even thank the drawfag, but you should appreciate that she got drawn.<br>That and in most cases there's no actual way to know you're not just pretending to be somebody else.</br></br>  <br>It's courtesy not to, but I can't blame you if you do.</br>  <br>Shouldn't a different reference be enough? I don't the fact that someone else comes here recently and requests her when I've been here for like a year</br>  My waifu's a very popular character, so I'm very pleased that I'm her only requester in these threads. Seems there was one long before I started posting, though. Wonder what happened to him?  <br>People might think you're double dipping, but if it's clear it's another person, then no one should complain.</br>  <br>Makes me happy you felt like drawing her again, I think your style is pretty cool drawfriend, it kind of reminds me of a Japanese ink painting, there's alot going on but it feels like it all flows together. She looks really cool. Good stuff, I'm very grateful drawfriend, thank you.<br><br><br>Wow, a second delivery, and you drew her with long hair, I really like how she looks with it, maybe I should request her with he hair down some other time. I really like how she looks in that outfit too, she looks tough and cute at the same time, really good work Kusugu, I'm also really grateful for drawing my lovely waifu.<br><br>I just woke up to see this so I hope you both get to see it, sincere gratitude to the both of you, I hope you both have a splendid rest of the weekend and the same for the coming week.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tough luck, try again next week.</br>  <br>Who is your waifu?</br>  <br>All a different reference proves for sure is that it's a different reference.<br>I could slide to one of my old refs I have lying around and pretend to be a new guy, or make a completely new one.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much this for me too.</br>  <br>I feel a bit bad because my waifu could be considered a 'seasonal' one. I hope that'll pass in like a year, maybe her manga will get an anime adaptation. I'd like to think so</br>  <br><br>It was a different Mei. He wasn't a waifufag though, opening admitted to thinking she was ugly.</br></br>  <br>There was a guy who was requesting my not so popular waifu for a long time, but his requests were so boring that I'm glad that he got bored of her.</br>  Something cool with Kochou Yoshida please!

I've been trying draw scenes instead of generic poses but always end up drawing a generic pose anyway  <br>I don't know, I've been trying to draw some scenes too, but always end up scrapping the background 'cause I'm way too lazy to finish them.</br>  <br><br>You need to start seeing the background as the other half of your piece and enjoy doing it, rather than something to be quickly bullshitted to improve the part you care about.<br><br>Try doing the background first.

It's my dear Hanako's birthday so I would like to request something birthday related.<br>Perhaps her in a graceful dress saying "T-thank you." with a soft smile while holding a giftwrapped present she received under the starry moonlight sky (Maybe with the stars spelling out "Happy Birthday Hanako"), but anything else would be lovely as well.<br>Thank you and Happy Birthday Hanako.</br></br>  Requesting Sayaka as an Idol or Magical girl.    /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.

It was a fabrication. You can't trust anything he says, and as the arc was narrated by him, it's easy to conclude that he just made that part up. The real question isn't whether he's dead or not, it's why he said he was dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw your native language let's you easily pronounce English and Japanese words. <br><br> English is my second language though. </br></br></br>  <br>the Kaiki Shuffle, anon</br>  <br> TFW no Hebrew, Russian and English and there's not a single sound I can't pronounce </br>  <br> Trusting the word of a conman. <br><br>Uh no, liars would lie again. logic says he is dead. You can't trust anything he says, hence why he is dead and in hell,hence why any sane person would not believe him when he said he would mix fact and fiction. Instead he just pure lied and was killed in a simular manner long before s2.</br></br></br>  Bah kay mow know gah tar ray  <br> Hates logic and cant understand it <br> defends other people, in this case a guy who has makeup and looks like a tranny. <br> defends trannies <br><br><br>FUCKING CHRIS CHAN?<br>I thought Chris chan was in prison for spraying a gamestop staff member with pepperspray for not allowing him to change sonics arm from blue to white.<br>Chris I know change is hard, but thats just something you have to accept.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Efl<wbr>HHVROiSs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>curious where you from kind anon ?</br>  Baked-Mono-Guitar Hero  <br>Oh yeah?<br>I want you you say Hanukkah on vocaroo with a proper khet</br></br>  <br>That's a huge stretch.<br>At that point you may as well assume he's lying about being a rusemaster and in fact is telling the truth when he says you shouldn't trust his word.<br><br>He lies. In order to discern what's true or not, you need to look from other perspectives. And other perspectives say he was lying about being dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its a huge stretch to trust him. He is a liar and conman who should not be trusted.<br><br><br>Instead you use reason from what people have seen him behave, and that is that he was a liar, theif and a clownish conman.<br><br><br>Hence there is established fact what he did before he lied as a narrator. Thus he lied about everything and didnt simple mix facts and fiction.<br>Instead based on his previous behavior, he was killed earlier by someone he tricked, considering the police in the monogatari universe is extremely incompetent, that would be no suprise.<br>Especially araragis mother. but thats beside the point.<br><br><br>Hence a conman is a conman and liar, he is burning in hell and rightfully so. people detest him for a reason both for his amoral and immoral behavior and for being a bad character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Talks like internet royalty  <br><br>people find this attractive</br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember that scene, she msde a cute sound</br>  <br>lets*<br>fuck my typo<br><br><br>FAILippines</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These 3 are correct:<br>Ba-ke-mo-bo-ga-ta-ri<br>bakemono-gatari<br>bake-monogatari</br></br></br></br>  <br>Italy here, same thing</br>  Senjougahara Hitagi is the best girl.

Thus why he told her in Tiger it was okay to be human when she asked, because he literally told her it wasn't okay in Kuro.<br><br>However your point about him not caring about what happened after he died for her needs an addition, when she was going to fully turn into a cat as a result of being cut by Kokorowatari, he begged the cat to let her go, and in Tsubasa Cat, the thought of Senjougahara going after Hanekawa stopped him. Meaning he does care about Hanekawa, but in an extremely ego-centric selfish way. Same with everyone else, including Senjougahara, where in Koi, he didn't care if he left her broken by being killed by Nadeko. And she couldn't bring herself to reprimand him for that for fear of losing him, as Kaiki points out.<br><br>Araragi is retarded is what we should clue into, and a depressed, suicidal person. Monogatari is full of messed up people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is surprisingly agile, remember when he jumped into Nadeko's room? Also, in the destroyed world arc according to Meme's letter Kaiki accompanied them to fight against Kiss-Shot. Not scam her or anything, but to actually battle. I wouldn't be surprised if he was on par with Yozuru.</br>  <br>No peecee right now<br>If thread still up in a few hrs, sure</br></br>  <br><br>The people who don't think Hanekawa is fun haven't seen the commentaries or read the novels. Lots of her more humorous stuff with Araragi was cut out.<br><br>She was intentionally straight laced, but it doesn't mean she wasn't fun.<br><br>Hell, she and Mayoi talked about how she doesn't go full drill sergeant on Araragi because she knows he gets off on it, and knows he watches her breasts jiggle when she gets actually mad.<br><br>The scary part of Hanekawa is that she holds the dom back, and has a really cold, wild part.

Just watch the Charlotte niconama or the new Charlotte radio show.  <br>Ayaneru is such a loose girl, why do otaku even like her?</br>  <br>Link?<br><br>They were also together in Hotarubi no Mori e (movie), and Nisekoi: &amp; Show By Rock!!</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>52247<br>The pairing seems to have a lot of fans already.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Fuck. I want to die now.</br>  <br>She's Cute</br>  <br><br>She's probably the most aggressively pushed that I've ever seen really at least in modern times. Not that I think she's bad but you can tell Sony has been pushing her rather blatantly as their leading lady for the future and cross promoting the crap out of her. She's the lead in every anime they can make her in. By comparison people like Saori Hayami, Kouki Uchiyama or Kana Hanazawa have gradually assumed that role by proving herself over time.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, Listening Uchiyama Kouki at Charlotte radio with Ayaneru and Uchiyama Kouki with Taoyama Nao at Nisekoi radio. It feel so different.</br>  Shikaco photobook by Nanjo scans when?  I find there's more sameness in seiyuu casting than ever these days, especially for the I'm Enterprise people. It's like almost every show I go to watch has Ayane Sakura, Kaito Ishikawa, Saori Hayami, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Sora Amamiya, Risa Taneda and Maaya Uchida in it. <br><br>Like same essential principle cast in a lot of shows, it's not even that there just in the shows but always main characters. I'm wondering if producers get like package deals or something where they get a few seiyuu together in a deal for cheaper rates or something.</br></br>  <br>read this for you<br>https://seiyuuplus.wordpress.com/20<wbr>15/07/04/71-seiyuu-castings-earning<wbr>s-everything-in-between/</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>I don't think she's act like that only with Kouki. In Shigatsu, She's also act like that to Ohsaka Ryota and Hanae Natsuki. <br>I think it's just that she's genki type and can act friendly even if with male seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>Obviously if a producer or whatever have good connection with some agency, their seiyuu will get more role. Work is like that, Nepotism everywhere.</br>  <br> Kaito Ishikawa <br>What role he get this season? I only know Rinne, and it's from last season.</br></br>  <br>It is even more noticeable now when she only does main character roles and especially Aniplex every season.</br>  <br>He is in Gangsta and Gate both are just side characters</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Sawashiro and Miyano are the greatest examples of fan service acting.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OLk<wbr>FyNHKDIA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> side character <br>Welp. I hope he get more main role this season. At least he already get it at Heavy Object.</br></br>  <br>next season I mean</br>  HURRY POST CUTE SEIYUUS NOW  <br>Happy Birthday Yuuka.<br>Listening to TLRD and Sympogear radio this season. I wonder staff will celebrate it in both show considering it's same Hibiki Radio.</br></br>  <br>Kaito mains in Haikyuu, OPM and the new Bones anime next season too.</br>  Is it safe to like Aya Hirano again?<br>She's the only thing watchable in that dreadful TAAHKEE anime.</br>  <br>That's a fucking guy. I refuse to believe it's not and old man in drag. Fuck. Holy fucking shit, at least put the make up, man.  Fuck it already did  Even the make up is hopeless. <br><br>Man, imagine getting a head from that.</br></br></br>  <br>do you listen the weekly comchat?</br>  <br>Next season has Seraph too he voiced a main there too, he does a lot of main roles next season</br>  <br>Man, what's wrong with this bitch's hair</br>  <br>Good taste. Ayaneru is my seiyuufu.</br>  obligatory cutest seiyuu post  <br>Nope, It's on my list but haven't listened to it.</br>  I love Imai! I think shes cute! CUTE!  <br>That's not Yui Ogura</br>  Can't wait for my Kanagatari Kanabakari book to arrive  <br> Taneda Risa <br>I can't wait until the Rori orgasm scenes</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed watching them together. I was watching it live and despite me staring at a screen with the same picture for over 30 minutes, I found it oddly entertaining. Ayaneru was typing messages out to everyone saying stuff like "Uchiyama Kouki is sleeping. How should I wake him up?" and "I have to use the toilet, but I'll hold it in." <br><br>Really looking forward to an actual ニコ生 this week.<br><br><br>Why do you want to die?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is following seiyuu such a slippery slope?  <br>Man, I really couldn't notice that shiba-san in wakaba girls was voiced by her until the credits roll. she's quite amazing.</br>  <br>I can't bear those イチャイチャ</br>    <br>What have you gotten recently? I finally finished my collection of Ayane*LDK DJCDs and am going for her NakaImo DVD next. It's too bad Ayaneru doesn't have a photobook or I'd be all over that.<br><br><br>Really? Just self insert yourself as Uchiyama or something. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PLe<wbr>Tvzag-es</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>    <br>It's because of this that I refuse to believe that whole "bocchi star" shit she keeps pushing on choroi. There's no way in hell she has a problem finding a guy to date. I have no problem with seiyuu dating but when they fake a persona like this, especially when it's that obvious it really gets on my nerve.</br>  <br>  Why do Otaku even like her? <br>I can't answer for all Otaku, but I like her because she had such a fun personality on radio shows, ニコ生, and Choroi. While I definitely think she's cute now and love other stuff about her, it's how she acts that really got me into her in the first place.</br></br>  <br><br>Most of this shit I already suspected just by being able to connect the dots like the SME one (King is also super obvious with Nana Mizuki etc) but it's nice to see some confirmation. It's not exactly a secret to those with open eyes that this is what's been happening. I don't mind it so much when it's up to the director who will be working directly with people though. For example Shinbo clearly has a fixation on Chiwa Saito (though he gets to exercise that far less now that he's Aniplex's bitch), Matsumoto clearly likes Rie Kugimiya, and Kazuki Akane and someone at Bones clearly likes Maaya Sakamoto.</br></br>  <br><br>Uchiyama sure is a hungry skeleton.</br></br>  <br> Risa Taneda having an orgasm </br>  <br><br>She's pretty much already gone through her peak years already and mainly shows up in daytime Jump type tuff and legacy adaptation type stuff. In a lot of ways it's better for her as she always seemed to hate dealing with the whole smile and nod for otaku thing</br></br>  <br>That happens. Look at Aoi Yuuki and Level-5.<br> Layton <br> Inazuma Eleven <br> Youkai Watch </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This Aketagawa guy sounds like a name to remember and no surprise to see Taneda linked to him. If Sakura and Uchida are linked to him too it'd make a lot of sense.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kh2<wbr>VFhPmKNo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I love it when seiyuu flirt like this.</br></br>  <br><br>So how long before SME drops Sora Amamiya like a rock? I can see they're slowing down a bit with Tomatsu since she peaked around 2013 but Amamiya should have a good 5 years left at least.<br><br>In any case I hate almost everything Aniplex has done towards streamlining, homogenizing and contorting the anime industry to favor them and kind of agree with Ootuska that it's working right now but just feels unsustainable in the long run. Eventually more and more people will catch on to it and turn against that model if not all at once over time as a result of fatigue with just seeing the same formulas worked over and over at all levels of anime production. <br><br>Personally I'm not convinced it's not already just and i mean just starting to happen as they get more aggressive with it and more and more veteran people are writing opinion pieces about it if not all aimed directly at Sony Music/Aniplex and co. For my case I really started noticing it big time around last summer (as in before stuff like Shirobako got popular and jump started people asking questions) even though clearly it's been going on a lot longer and there's probably tons of industry horror stories that go unreported.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sauce?</br></br>  <br><br>Fool, Aniplex is saving anime.</br></br>  <br><br>By making anime originals for noitaminA with fuck tons of problems including but not limited to significant pacing and thematic issues? I'm all for TV anime originals, but it would help if lately any of them were any good at all outside of Shirobako.</br></br>  <br>They need to fuck.</br>  <br><br>Those were all perfectly good anime originals, Samurai Flamenco especially.</br></br>  <br>It's interesting how Ayaneru has been losing weight over time while Mayayan has been gaining weight.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vTC<wbr>4PbNekrA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Looks like Ayaneru is pretty capable in the kitchen too. She's going to be such a good wife.</br></br>  <br> going to be </br>  <br><br>Samurai Flamenco and Punch Line were good. The other one was crap.</br></br>  <br><br>I think it's the other way around kind of, Flamenco and Punch Line were essentially pure grade crap (especially the former which was only good for the Guillotine Gorilla jumping the shark meme) while Terror was almost serviceable though had it's own share of problems.</br></br>  Watching Ozanari in last few days. This two is so cute together. I hope Maria is getting more role. Inside Rokujyouma member, She's the only one who haven't got another role. She's obviously can voice a loli just like Ogura Yui.  Domo.  <br>Nice</br>    I love Aoi.  I love Ayaneru  It seems that they are pushing Inori Minase a lot recently, good for her. <br><br>  Is she a pillow seiyuu though?  </br></br>  <br>I would say she is fairly talented.<br> Is she a pillow seiyuu  <br>Doubt it, she doesn't seem particularly attractive.</br></br></br>  <br>that wouldn't really stop you from being a pillow seiyuu, as long as you can fuck</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BjL<wbr>Jokh1BGM</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>I, for one, look forward to crazy Chino.</br></br>  <br>/a/xperts, How many of these girls sucked their way to the top?</br>  <br>[menopause intensifies]</br>  <br><br>Why does Teh Rie look like a man in that pic?</br></br>  <br>Aging done very wrong.<br>This is aging done very right.<br> Though seriously, its like this monster ages in reverse. </br></br></br>  <br>Light makeups.</br>  <br>She had a bad day, that's all.

Chanko is a genius.</br>  do you think she fucks good?  <br>We should take a guess on which seiyuu would be a demon in bed.<br>No counting Christmas Cakes or experienced women.</br></br>  <br>all seiyuu fuck good since they should suck director's cock to get roles.</br>  <br>Even the males ones?<br>Even Sugita?</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  My semen demons can't be this cute.  <br>I have a really bad obsession of following her twitter now that I know she loves to speak in english. I already loved her voice but now I like her as a person.</br>  <br>I plan to watch all of Choroi, Radio Cross and Ayane*LDK eventually. Sucks that I really only got into seiyuu radio shows like 2 months ago.</br>  <br>You will never play Resident Evil with Yuu. ;_;</br>  <br><br>I wanna give her a foot massage with my mouth.</br></br>  <br>She is also a personality of radio of nonnon and sidonia. Check those too if you watch those anime.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm already listening to the current Non Non Biyori radio and loving her and Rieshon together. I'm tempted to listen to the Sidonia radio, but I don't watch the series. I've heard snippets of it and they sound pretty fun.</br>  <br>How the fuck does she appear in everywhere.<br>I just realize she is that dead assistance girl in Sidonia.<br>And from what I know this season, nnb, charlotte, aqualion and god know what other roles in show that I haven't bother watching.</br></br></br>  <br>More like not enough. I wish she were in more shows so I could hear her even more often.</br>  <br>Her acting is just mediocre but she is a good talker and many of her coworkers are close with her. I suppose those merits are important to seiyuu.</br>  <br>Because she's the rightful heiress for Hanakana's throne.</br>  <br>as expected pillow seiyuu</br>  <br> tfw Hanazawa got 7 roles this season </br>  I love Saorin  <br>she want to be like kanahana-senpai</br>  <br>Too bad that most of her roles this season are supporting characters.</br>  <br>She has all the right arsenals to be like her beloved senpai<br> easily recognizable voice, but can alter it if needed <br> cute, girl next door looks like Hanazawa and Kayano <br> great personality on event and radio </br></br></br></br>  <br>I loved how in the newest Choroi, Paisen wrote a wish for Ayaneru saying that she wished she was more popular than HanaKana. Ayaneru's reaction to that was priceless.</br>  <br>Yeah, she's in Gakkou Gurashi, Wakaba girl, Classroom Crisis, and Monster Musume. Last season she's in Mikagura and Etotama</br>  <br>I think she is pretty good, especially her one man show for boatsluts.<br>Funny how she started out as a xmas cake buttidol Mari but ended up being more known for kid like Shimakaze.</br></br>  <br>is that why she always short-haired like kanahana?</br>  <br>so like she's totally lesbian for her sempai?</br>  I'd a slut  <br>She looked really old with long hair.<br>Look at her photo when she first appeared in Yumekui Merry.<br>I was really surprised when I found out that she's only 17 at that time.<br>She suddenly looked like her age when she cut her hair.</br></br></br></br>  <br>mareitaso is cute, CUTE!</br>  <br>Her otouto is cuter.</br>  <br>There's no way she's not a pillow seiyuu</br>  <br>I don't think so</br>    So Taneda Risa is a pillow seiyuu?<br>That Jin dude is pretty badass then. I find it weird how 1guy can wield so much power in the industry.</br>   tfwMUwnbygf   <br>She was in Singapore for a whole week?</br>  <br>Looks like an obaa san here.</br>  <br>I think she looks lot more average high school girl with those longer hair.</br>    SPOT THE PILLOW SEIYUU  <br>Only the right one</br>  <br>Which one's the porn star and which ones the seiyuu?<br><br> My guess is left does JAV </br></br></br>  <br>Cannot unsee</br>  <br>Fuck you, Aisaka-kun is pure.</br>  <br>She can't be pure since she always listening to the eroge musics.</br>  <br>It's just a rumor. Whether it's true or not, we don't know until there's a proof</br>  <br> new PV <br>N I C E<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2KS<wbr>SdL7E3GY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>She's just interested in the music only, not the H scenes!</br>  <br>Wrong.</br>  <br>I don't see she gets pushed a lot she doesn't even get that many roles eventhough she is still rather new it is more because she always voices popular loli characters so she is likely top choice to voice loli characters, not to mention she is under Sony but she doesn't even doing many shows with Aniplex</br>  <br> Both ?</br>  <br>I like Kuno Misaki's loli voice more.<br>Her voice is more fun for bullying and suffering.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if it was Taiwan/Singapore or back in Japan but Nana said they were filming her nonstop before in a radio show.</br>  <br>No, the right does JAV. Left is Yuu Asakawa.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think so too. That being said, my favourite Ayaneru hair length is when it's a bit past her shoulder. The cutest imo.</br>  Miku Itou is a real qt3.14  Why are the Love Live girls so lewd?  <br> you'll never have your dick between Yurika's oppai </br>  <br>Is that a birth mark?</br>  <br> that body <br>Not bad, 9/10</br></br>  <br>Is the ribbon for best in show?</br>  <br>I know, i just wanted to use the pic</br>  Rippi is pretty dang lewd, too!  <br><br>Literally pillow seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>Why is she such a cute?</br>  <br>She's the one that voices the boy in LL?</br>  <br>Shikaco too.<br><br> Anyone have pics of that photobook she shot in Thailand? </br></br></br>  <br>Makeup and angles.</br>  God damn Mai Nakahara made the second episode of Laplace bearable. That scream at the end split my sides.  <br>and magic</br>  <br>Wow, I can actually read that.<br><br>I think I've been in this website too long.</br></br></br>  <br>Gunshot wound</br>  <br> why is it so hard to find seiyuu feet? <br>Ayana Taketatsu, adorable little size 4.5s.</br></br>    <br>Spread toes are incredibly unpleasant. Doesn't matter who they belong to.</br>  <br>That's just like, your opinion, man.</br>  <br>truth</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>stop</br>  Post cute seiyuu foot  foot?  <br>Kou-chan is literally her only friend outside of the seiyuu industry, or so she claims. And then there's that time on Oregairu radio when she claimed that all throughout middle school and high school she's only ever talked to boys 3 times. I find that very hard to believe after seeing her chemistry with Kouki.</br>  <br>And you believe it?</br>  <br>Welp, we both can't see the truth after all, <br>so I guess I'll just go through with my optimism.</br></br>  <br>Fine.</br>  <br>She probably grew up not to be that awkward with boys. Just like Matsuoka who kind of not awkward anymore with girls.</br>  <br>so awkward</br>  <br>Well she said she's known Uchiyama Kouki for quite a while now so that is a factor.</br>  Nice body.  <br>What's the sauce of this image</br>  <br>More feet.<br><br><br>She was celebrating her 20th birthday with Mikakoshi and Mikakoshi posted some pictures on twitter. <br><br>https://twitter.com/mikakokomatsu/s<wbr>tatus/428184121899503616</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That's pretty hot. Dress her like some yakuza lady and I might pop a boner.</br>  <br>Oh my, in what occassion did they get together? Are they buddies or something?</br>  <br>Where was that taken? Malaysia?</br>    <br>Thailand</br>  Please post more Amamiya Sora. Thank you.  <br>When did she go there? I don't recall her going there, only AFA Singapore.<br><br> If she ever went to Flipland I'd probably faint from happiness. </br></br></br>  <br>She's a less sexier Tomatsu with better singing but worse voice acting.<br><br><br>Her new PB was shot in Thailand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean that book with her in black underwear which was regularly being posted in seiyuu threads?<br><br> mfw the only place I went to in Thailand was Suvarnabhumi for stopovers <br> mfw I have yet to visit the glorious Siam Paragon mall and the glorious Royal Paragon Hall <br> mfw the only SEA country I've genuinely been to other than my own is Singapore </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can we confirm Tomato is used goods now?</br>  Which seiyuu use stage names? I know Nana, Marina Inoue, Satsuki Yukino, Yui Horie, Suzuko Mimori, Y.Aoi, and a few others whose names are escaping me at the moment.  <br>Stage names as in fake names, cause I know that Aoi Shouta's real name is Noburu Yanagaki? Or stage names as in aliases? I know Yuu Asakawa has some aliases for when she does some eroge.</br>  <br>Fake names.<br><br>Examples:<br><br>Nana Mizuki = Nana Kondou<br>Satsuki Yukino = Yuki Inoue<br>Aoi Yuuki = Aoi Yabusaki<br>Yui Horie = Yoshiko Horie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well... she was/is dating Miyu Irino.</br>  Her feet don't reach the ground.  OTP Seiyuu  <br> dat ClariS poster in the background </br>  <br>That's tragic, but cute.</br>  Kitaeri has seen my penis. You guys jelly?  <br>You do realize that you played a part in forcing her to abandon her Twitter account, right? Don't you regret it at all?</br>  <br>No wonder Aoba is her best role.</br>  <br>How tragic?</br>  <br>Can you imagine Aoi Yuuki trying to reach the top shelf? That's harsh, man.</br>  <br>Madoka levels tragic</br>  <br>Everyone knows that Y.Aoi won't be the same if she wasn't petite. There's a reason why her unit is called Petit Milady.</br>  You will never drink yourself senseless with Sumire.  <br>Thankfully.</br>  <br>On a serious note, I doubt that Aoi dislikes being short.<br>Most I heard from her is mentioning that she wears huge platform shows so she can keep up with other people when walking.</br></br>  <br>In the recent Shokugeki recap episode, he was literally staring at the ceiling most of the time while making awkward faces.</br>  No one is going to sub any more Toky Encounter, right?    <br>He always awkward in front of camera. But many Seiyuu said he's fine at recording. I don't know how much that 'fine' though.</br>  <br>Didn't she drop down a well in Ringu?</br>  Do you guys ever send mail to radio show?  <br>What is a radio show?</br>  <br>Any anime radio or seiyuu radio</br>  Are they in love?  Yes  Yes  Maybe.  Yes  Yes  <br><br><br>With each other?</br></br></br>  Afirmative  No, just a bromance  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  <br> Gon's hairline <br>Who the fuck made this</br></br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  Yes but they're currently having a lovers quarrel  The only thing that could be possibly gayer than these two is Boku no Pico.  <br>Boku no Pico is less gay because the shotas act like little girls instead of little boys</br>  <br>Yes. One of the best pairings I ever had the chance to see. They are soulmates.<br><br><br>Healing arc when?</br></br></br></br>  <br>One of them definitely is. I don't know if the other even understands romance.</br>  <br>I'm sure Gon will tell Killua about romance and Killua will tell Gon about hardcore.</br>  <br> Dat 2nd movie <br><br>I can feel the faggotry all over</br></br></br>  No.<br><br>Only because they both know two ukes in a relationship won't work out</br></br>    there are different types of "love". The one one Killua and Gon share between them is xenia, philia and arguably agape.  <br>Never because Killua can't into affection.</br>  <br>But he can, he just doesn't like Gon as much as he tried to convince himself.</br>  <br>You wish. Healing arc will come. We only need Togashi to get his shit together and write his story.<br><br>  Which will be never, but I can hope <br><br><br>And you say this because?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fujoshits ruin everything.  <br>The only way that will happen would be if Killua realizes that maybe just maybe he should try to give Gon support, comfort, affection and not turn Gon away every time he tries. In other words Killua needs to kill all of his tsun<br><br>Until he does that there will be no healing.</br></br></br>  <br>That would actually explain a lot.</br>  <br>Honestly, I prefer their shipping over their lusting.</br>  <br>At least when they're shipping they're not posting the same two pictures over and over again ad naseum.</br>  <br>Yes but one-sided. Poor Killua.</br>  <br>Poor Killua?<br>He's the one who constantly rejects Gon.</br></br>  <br> if Killua realizes that maybe just maybe he should try to give Gon support, comfort, affection <br>I think Killua has done enough to show support, comfort and affection to Gon in his own way. While not the best, he still tries. Don't expect from a 14 years old to be emotionally mature, especially is his childhood was messed with almost no good memories and experiences.<br><br>I'm not sure about the tsun part since its how he reacts to what Gon says, it's not like he hasn't been honest with his feelings most of the time. It's another thing if he doesn't voice them.<br><br>And the same could be said for Gon. Both imo, are messed up emotionally (Chimera Ant arc made us see how bad). They need to work with themselves first and that's why, while their separation hurts me, is needed for both of them to grow up as people. <br><br>Healing for me will come when both realize their flaws, accept them and try to change them not to the point of becoming different people, but to the point they will be able to grow up and see other options. So, when they will meet both will be better people and be able to be with each other once again.<br><br><br>Like?<br><br>I'm not trying to argue with someone here, but I definately want to see how others see and understand their relationship. So any opinions are very welcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Poor Killua. </br>  <br>Except Killua has never comforted Gon nor has he ever shown him any affection or support when he really needed it. Don't mistake headcanons and doujins for the actual series.<br><br>Gon has shown Killua support, comfort and affection, despite the fact that Killua always turns him down.</br></br></br>  <br> It's another thing if he doesn't voice them. <br>He doesn't.<br> Healing for me will come when both realize their flaws <br>Gon has realized his and immediately wanted to make things right with Killua, Ging, and Kite. Killua blamed Gon for his flaws.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He never shows Gon any affection but expects to recieve them. It's especially maddening if you CA arc if you ever read the manga, Killua's reasons for being mad at Gon were really because he felt that Gon wasn't paying him enough attention, while Gon is traumatized mind you. A quest that started out to save Gon turned into just an afterthought, then at the end of everything Killua doesn't even want to know that he saved his life. Then doesn't even stick around to see him wake up.<br><br>So yeah if they revealed that Killua actually didn't care about Gon, I wouldn't be surprised.</br></br></br>  <br> Except Killua has never comforted Gon nor has he ever shown him any affection or support when he really needed it. <br>My memory is not the best, but I'm sure he has shown affection and support in his own way. I can't remember for comfort though.<br><br> Don't mistake headcanons and doujins for the actual series. <br>I have read the manga and I'm watching the anime now. I'm pretty confident in my ability to separate canon and headcanon.<br><br> Gon has shown Killua support, comfort and affection, despite the fact that Killua always turns him down. <br>I think both of them have shown affection their own ways. <br>Mind telling me a scene he turned him down?<br><br><br> He doesn't. <br>I didn't say anything different.<br> Gon has realized his and immediately wanted to make things right with Killua, Ging, and Kite. Killua blamed Gon for his flaws. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127917330#p127923304">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> My memory is not the best, but I'm sure he has shown affection and support in his own way.

Short form Kuroneko knew Kirino loved Kyousuke but still went for him, teased her with that knowing it really hurts her, her plan was to get an ending where Kyousuke only loves her (she also knew his feelings for Kirino) and Kirino is somehow ok with that and still her friend. Even after failing she still pursued him which only made it harder for everybody involved. She is at least as selfish as everyone else exluding Manami.</br>  <br>Winry is the worst FMA character. fuck off</br>    <br> Kosaki <br> Regret </br></br>  <br><br> Kosakifags </br></br>  <br>What is Boku no pico?</br>  <br>This manga is so cringe worthy.<br><br>Thanks for reminding me.</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, she's great.</br>  <br>Kosaki getting btfo was always an inevitability in face of destined and otp end that is Chitoge.</br>    <br>Easy</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>It baffles me that people are actually surprised by the fact that the main heroine will win.<br>I don't like it, because Marika is my girl, but it's always been pretty telegraphed.</br></br>  Come at me Twirlfags  <br>She didn't really have much competition.<br>Shit characters in a shit cartoon.</br></br>  <br>Not really.

And she lost the last one to both Marika and Chitoge chapters.</br>  <br>There's far more to it like the anime stuff being Kuronekofags who changed a lot to make her look better and Kirino worse, her being kinda slutty in volume 5 and calling him nii-san to get some of his siscon affection, her jealousy of Kirino and so on.</br>  What is Misato Katsuragi.

Tsumugi a cute.

There was actually a group on there called the Gensokyo Whorehouse and they would do hilariously awful erps  for TF2 hats, weapon and metal .</br>  Mio&gt;everyone else  <br>It didn't happen because of the Steam group, it happened separately but caused a lot of people to join the group because it was pretty much impossible to have any kind of discussion in the thread</br>  All girls are best girl.  <br>It started a little while back by a transsexual britbong with cuck and piss fetishes.<br>despite claiming to have mugi as his waifu, he constantly slanders her and and consistently avatarfags with poorly drawn fanart of mugi as if to put her down further.<br>the mods sometimes delete his threads, but sadly they never banned him.</br></br></br>  <br>It was an Australian at first actually, there's more than one of them</br>  <br>It's mainly done by the bong.</br>  Guys can we just settle who the best girl is once and for all? Everyone knows that  all the k-on girls are top tier, and it's futile and petty to argue who's better. They're all fantastic.    <br>Bought an electric gitah a long time ago and finally started playing it thanks to k-on, which I watched for the first time two weeks ago. Also bought an electric drum kit a few days ago thanks to Ritsu.</br>  <br>Guitar and keyboard.</br>  what kind of books do the keions read?<br> assuming yui and ritsu can read </br>  <br>Azusa - Guitar books/non-fiction<br>Mio- Love stories<br>Mugi - Classic novels<br>Ritsu - Manga  and love stories secretly <br>Yui - Manga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fifty shades of kei...on.</br>  <br>Exactly, the anything sexual about the keions in the steam group is a bannable offense.</br>    <br>I want to remove kebab with the keions</br>  <br>Ritsu belongs to Mio though.</br>  <br>how about removing cops with the keions?</br>  <br> How did you do that </br>  <br>It's a mod I made. do you want it?</br>  <br> Yes </br>    <br>here you go:<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/1<wbr>tft5xyarbgcso2/aimpoint_template.zi<wbr>p<br>the folder has aimpoints for each keion, but you can only use one at a time. for example if you want to use yui, put the "yui aimpoint" folder into \PAYDAY 2\assets\mod_overrides<br>It only works for the military red dot sight.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>How are people still playing this?<br><br>I played for 60 hours after it was released and never touched it again. It's the same boring bottleneck with cops thing.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no mod_overrides folder, do I just make one or am I missing something</br>  <br>I am glad Yui likes manga, I cant wait to read Evangelion with her.</br>  <br>I'd imagine she reads more cute SoL type things</br>  <br>you have to make the folder.<br><br>I don't know. I've sunk almost 300 hours into this game, and I still can't stop playing.</br></br></br>  <br>That's fine then , I have some of those too. I wonder what her favorite manga is.</br>  <br> that's it </br>  <br>I mean series not type.</br>  <br>Lucky Star.</br>  <br>Nice! it works. That's pretty amazing, makes me want to start playing again</br>  <br>I can see that, I can see her being a Miyuki fan as well.</br>  <br>What's the best build, you wanker?</br>  <br>Yui seems like the sort of girl who'd laugh at things she can relate to, so she'd probably like Lucky Star.<br><br>As for Ritsu I can imagine her reading a lot of shounen.  Maybe even Berserk but just for the fights and not really understanding the themes and stuff. </br></br></br>  <br>I prefer a tech-forcer build, but dodge isn't bad either.<br>just make sure you don't play like this guy</br></br>  <br>I can Mugi reading Akira, and probably gangsta as well.</br>  Is it true that Mugi is mostly liked by mostly Blacks?<br><br>C/D?</br></br>  <br>She canonically has a black boyfriend</br>    <br>keions are sexy</br>  <br>Yes but they are also pure, nice, kind, modest,respectable people.<br>They are perfection  Azusa especially </br></br>  Which keion will get a boyfriend first and which one will get married first?  <br>Mio I reckon</br>  <br>I want to say Mugi</br>  <br>I thought gay marriage was illegal under the japanese constitution.</br>  <br>they'll move to canada then</br>  <br>Mio will be the first to get a boyfriend but Mugi will be the first to marry, an arranged marriage by her parents.</br>  <br>which keion will be the first to  do drugs? </br>   Mio getting a boyfriend <br><br>She won't</br></br>  <br>Ritsu by choice, Yui maybe if she's tricked into it.</br>  <br>Ritsu<br>Then Yui will do them by accident cause she's dumb</br></br>  <br>yui would probably do it if she saw ritsu do it.<br>azusa and mio would need a lot of convincing, though</br></br>  <br>correct</br>  <br>You really think Mio would need convincing? <br><br>You think Ritsu would do drugs in the first place?</br></br></br>  <br>You know Ritsu isn't gay, right?</br>  <br>I sure hope not, then I wouldn't be able to marry her</br>  <br>Everyone is gay for Mio</br>  <br>I was never much of a fan of the Yui/Azusa dynamic so my feelings for the movie are only lukewarm. I know Yamada loves them, however.<br><br>The best parts were when they were in Japan.</br></br></br>  <br> I was never much of a fan of the Yui/Azusa dynamic <br>why not? those were some of my favorite parts. especially when yui thought azusa was missing, that was tight</br></br>  <br>The entire movie is anime original, so it's not like it matters at all.</br>  <br> so it's not like it matters at all. <br>It's OBJECTIVELY the best part of the entire series</br></br>  <br>Quit using words you don't understand. It brings down the credibility of the entire KyoAni fanbase.</br>  I came here to say Azunyan is best.  what would season 3 be about?  <br> why not? those were some of my favorite parts. <br>Well, I didn't hate it, but I wasn't in love with it either. It's just that the movie focused on them so heavily that I realized I like them the most in moderation. <br><br>It's a little difficult to pinpoint on the reason why. It's been so long.  I think there's a possibility I just don't like Azusa that much.  </br></br></br></br>  <br> OBJECTIVELY </br>  <br> that whole arc <br>Also anime original. Maybe there's a pattern here?</br></br>  <br> I think there's a possibility I just don't like Azusa that much. <br>why?</br></br>  <br>Outstanding post my friend</br>  <br><br>tricked</br></br>  <br> Also anime original. <br>I know both are anime original. Everyone should. That's why I referenced Yamada liking them. And probably a few more people on the staff.</br></br>  <br> I think there's a possibility I just don't like Azusa that much. <br>Opinion discarded due to shittaste</br></br>  <br>I was referencing the pattern that you don't like the anime original parts as much as you do the ones adapted directly from the manga.</br>  <br>The inevitable breakup of the band<br>they all go their separate ways in college<br>yui becomes a NEET</br></br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>You are that same lad that appears in threads to tell them they haven't read the manga even if they have and that the anime is shit aren't you</br>  <br> you don't like the anime original parts as much as you do the ones adapted directly from the manga. <br>I can understand how you would make that guess, but it's not correct. I enjoyed the second season much more than I did the first, and thought KyoAni made the right decision in doing their own thing in several places in the story.<br>Also, I wasn't particularly saying that I didn't really like that arc in the anime.<br><br><br>It's not that I don't like her at all. Maybe I just don't like her as much as the others.<br>Although speaking of the first season, I remember her introductory arc did make her seem pretty shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You couldn't prove it if I was, so what does it matter? It's already established that you dislike KyoAni's additions to the K-ON! franchise. What are you going to do about it? Recant your previous statements?</br>  <br>Not the guy you were quoting m80 pot80</br>  <br> Also, I wasn't particularly saying that I didn't really like that arc in the anime. <br>Be honest, you're backtracking because you found out you agreed with an antagonist.</br></br>  <br>I'd lick that hairband</br>  <br>Swap Ritsu and Yui and you're good to go.</br>  Fuck you, Adhamm.  <br>If you don't like yui, then you're missing something. maybe part of your brain perhaps</br>  <br> yui becomes a NEET <br>would watch</br></br>  <br>Honestly, I'd say the last 6 episodes were the best.<br>The movie came close, but it was too bad that they already used their A material in the series.<br>That scene on the roof didn't really mean much to me as the end of episode 20</br></br></br>  How come the keions never talk about boys?  <br> as the end of episode 20 <br>Are you an idiot?</br></br>  <br>I don't know how can anyone hate any of the K-Ons. They are absolute perfection. Each and every one of them is perfect in her own way. <br>Maybe Yui is the perfectest.</br></br>  <br>why do you think?</br>  <br>don't agree with me, tripfag! people will think i'm wrong</br>  <br> Be honest, you're backtracking <br>No, I really just posted that image because it was relevant and came up in my folder. I really meant to post this one, but my K-ON folder is too poorly organized.<br><br>Honestly, I don't remember if I like that episode or not since I haven't watched it since it aired. Maybe I should watch it again. I did like the song that came out of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>THERE HE GOES AGAIN THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN LOOK AT HIM GO WAHEYYY</br>  <br>I absolutely love moeblobs without personalities 8)</br>  <br>A-are you okay, anon?</br>  <br>I'm fine thanks for asking, just making sure everyone is able to witness the argumentative mastery this man is performing</br>  <br>  8) <br>fuck off back to your containment board</br></br>  <br> Talking about moeblobs <br> K-On thread. <br>Does not compute.</br></br></br>  <br>Have to agree with him that some of the keions have more depth to their characters than others though, I'd say Ritsu and Azusa are the most complex while Yui and Mugi are the least</br>  Mugi  <br>Same sequence without the homosexual romantic implications?<br>Also you like the YuiAzu version of Fudepen Ballpen? To me it felt hollow, like it was clearly lacking Mio and Ritsu's input, like it was being played by half of a band.</br></br>  Why is Mio so sexual?  <br> character depth <br> K-On <br>You may only pick one, now and forever.</br></br></br>  <br> homosexual romantic implications <br>Remove yuri goggles<br><br> YuiAzu version of Fudepen Ballpen <br> hollow, lacking </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some have more than others, I'm comparing them with each other not with other anime</br>  <br>First panel of what he posted. How can that be taken any way other than yuri bait? KyoAni likes doing this kind of thing, this is an established fact.</br>  jesus christ, sameface has gotten bad.  <br>There's no more "yuribait" in that scene in the anime than in the manga</br>  <br>You know you are allowed to admit I'm right.</br>  <br>Do you have autism? Trouble understanding human emotions?<br>Is homosexuality really all you get from this scene</br></br>  <br> Do you have autism? Trouble understanding human emotions? <br>No, he just thinks and reasons with his dick</br></br>  <br>You know you are allowed to admit I'm right. <br><br>You go somewhere else.</br></br></br>  <br>And there we go he's done it again as predicted</br>  <br>So are you or are you not going to admit I'm right?

I guess because I didn't want the series to 'end'.<br><br>It's been so long, I'm wondering if it's finally time to watch it.<br><br>What's the best way to watch the film for the first time? I'm thinking simply comfy duvet mode with some tea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how Ritsu totally sits like a dude while everyone else is mindful of their skirts all the time.<br>I'd say rewatch the episode where they sing tenshi ni fureta yo to Azusa then watch the movie if you have the time. The movie is essentially the prequel to that episode.<br>I watched it while drinking and it was pretty fun and  emotional. </br></br></br>  I miss Yotsuba C  <br>Same.</br>  <br>Ritsu is like a bro</br>  <br>She almost saved the band from being bad when they were choosing a name and song themes, but failed.</br>  I am literally going to marry Azusa.  <br>Get in line.</br>  <br>Ritsu is my favorite Keion.<br>She likes Keith Moon too so she's extra best girl.</br></br>  <br>There is no line only me and Azusa in a happy marriage and forming a husband/wife jazz duo, living in a small comfy apartment with one room converted into a studio and eventually having one child who we will teach guitar from a young age creating another little Azusa who will continue the cycle of guitar prodigy in our family.<br> picture related its an artist's rendition of what our child may look like </br></br>  Does this ever actually happen in the show. I don't remember it being in it but I've seen a few images like this.  <br>Why don't you watch it and find out fam<br> Azusa knows DFC is best C </br></br>  <br>I watched it.</br>  <br>I can't think of any context in which that scene might occur</br>  <br>I guess niggas just like putting melon pan on flat girls.</br>  no, somebody was just having fun with meronpan and azunyan pretending to have breasts  <br>Niggas need to get some taste</br>  <br>I guess it's okay to be gay anon.</br>  <br>Everyone is jealous of Mio's Mios.<br>Disgusting Flat Chest get out.<br>Delicious Cow Tits forever.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>I want to live in Mio's boobies.</br>  I will defend cow tits till my dying breath.<br>Mio is not the best example but for keions she will have to do.<br>Breasts are filled with the hopes and dreams of men. Therefore flat girls are not worth pursuing.</br></br>  <br>Amen.</br>  Are k-on bros watching the best new CGDCT, gakkou gurashi?  <br> I judge a girl solely on their ability to give a good titjob <br>Typical cowtitfags</br></br>  I like Azusa the best shes the cutest and i like her guitar and her twin tails i wanna play with them and bounce them around and make cruiser noises with my mouth    <br><br>Brother.<br>I bet when Mio hits college she would have the most bangin' bod on the block.<br>I feel bad for the other girls, knowing that they will never be as popular or as sexy as the shy bassist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It was a joke </br>  <br>I want to hug her and wrap her twintails around us both</br>  <br><br>i wanna hung her legs and rub my face against her socked feet</br></br>  <br>Good titjobs are excellent, but that's not all.<br>I admire their shape, their touch, their smell.<br>How my hands cannot grasp it all, yet they'll be damned if they don't try.<br>The way they bounce, sway, and jiggle.<br>How they look in clothes and without.<br>Cow tits are what make a girl. A best girl at least.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to snuggle up next to her on the sofa and rest my head on top of hers</br>  I'm only on episode8 of season 2 but I want to know they plan on continuing it past season 2? Anyone willing to share that information with me?  <br>There are some OVAs and the film.<br>Season 3 was going to be made to fit the slot that Tamako Market eventually took so there's still hope  r-right? </br></br>  <br>K-ON is dead mate. It'll never get a third season</br>  <br><br>I'm a Azusa fag, but I'll admit Mio does have some nice oppai</br></br>  <br>This thread, the publicity the keions' birthdays still get, the 5th anniversary merch selling and the recent event at Toyosato show it's not</br>  <br>The whole point of merch is to jew out after they don't want to produce any more anime, of course it's selling. The anime is dead</br>  <br>Whether the anime is or not, K-ON certainly isn't dead and likely won't be for some time<br> I'll be there to celebrate the 10th anniversary </br></br>  <br>I'd take Mugi to see Radiohead.

Hand in hand, we're going to get our degrees and travel the world and pursue passions and comfort each other in times of pain and settle down in a cozy villa and make love even when our bodies are frail and die without ever dying in each other's hearts and i'll be damned if some fucking goofy cunt from 4chan disguised as a seraph attempts to steal my Annabelle Lee from her Kingdom by the Sea. She's mine, and she loves me.<br><br>Now, i'll ask one more time: Would Mugi like Radiohead? It's really important.</br></br></br>  <br>The K-On franchise is like, 2/3 anime original anyway.<br><br>Only S1 stayed close to the 4koma.<br>They did whatever they wanted in the S2, and even invented a movie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get away from my waifu and kill yourself autist</br>  <br>If only death would bring me closer to her. Unfortunately, a world of darkness is a world without Mugi No, I will never get away from MY waifu, and I will never kill myself so long as she lives. Go ride the shortbus back to speech therapy class so you can learn to talk to girls more in your league- the ones with dicks, perhaps?</br>  <br>As much as I like fapping to futa and traps, get away from my waifu and kill yourself autist</br>  Why are Mugifags so autistic  There are people in this thread right now, that literally dislike Mugi.  <br>You do not deserve more replies from me, pederast. Do not mistake this for me going out quietly. Mugi and I will be long gone by the time you read this, being free and being one, the croons of Thom Yorke and the coos of my love filling the air of the night with music and sweetness. A man in love does not need to ward off the suitors of his mistress, for he knows that she would not leave him as your arm would not leave your torso. As the dust collects in the wake of our leave, you'll still be left alone, a ball and chain around your ankle, an empty heart writhing rhythmically, and a disloyal dick that pricks for faces and bodies not belonging to the one you claim to love. She will love Radiohead because she loves me. You will still be shitposting because she does not love you.</br>  <br>Get away from my waifu and kill yourself autist</br>  <br>And I thought KyoAni were bad at drawing hands</br>  I forget, the movie falls chronologically after episode 22 right? Or was it 23?  <br>It's like in between and at the same time as 22-24, you couldn't actually watch it chronologically without splitting the film into parts and watching some parts of it at the same time as parts of episodes</br>  <br>Ah okay, thanks. The first time I watched K-On I watched the movie after finishing the series, so I wanted to do try going chronologically this time.</br>  <br>Just watch it at the end, there's not really any way to fit it in</br>  <br> not using the style that's as dark as your soul </br>  Mio a best, followed closely by Azusa, followed not so closely by Mugi, followed WAY behind by the other two  <br>Your opinion is incorrect</br>    https://twitter.com/PG_saito/status<wbr>/619377368101093377<br><br>The director of Metal Gear Rising wants to make a Kill la Kill and Berserk game.<br><br>Would you play them?</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br> Grapplers <br> OP <br><br>That's a laugh.
