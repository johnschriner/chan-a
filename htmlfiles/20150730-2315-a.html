[ So is kidd and his goonie posse gonna fight kaidou or get on their knees and suck his bbc?  I don't know what is happening in this chapter. so confusing.  <br>Sanji and co run from the big mom pirates.<br><br>Kaidou tries to kill himself by jumping off a cloud 10,000 meters in the air, but lives and lands in front of kidd and co</br></br></br>  <br>just wait for a better translation</br>  DOES NOBODY REACT ON THE FACT THAT UROUGE IS A SO FUCKING HIGH PRIEST THAT KAIDOU DIDNT EVEN TRY TO ATTACK HIM  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>the pirates had kaidou's logo not big mom's</br>  <br>share no urouge <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>lost to this</br>  <br>Yeah. That's why they're after Momo and not Caesar</br>  <br> Foreshadowed as this invincible beast of a person <br> Turns out he's just a lucky dickhead <br><br>I'm surprised, but not disappointed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's so physically strong and mighty that he can't die; I don't think it's luck.</br>  <br>If that's the case, then why doesn't he just drown himself?</br>  <br>He doesn't truly want to die. He just does this shit as a hobby. He'd probably survive anyways.</br>  <br>Gills. He has the features of every beast is my guess.</br>  I really hope Kaidou and Big Mamu turn out to secretly be decent human beings like Whitebeard did.<br><br>It never actually crossed my mind until this chapter that Kaidou could actually have some kind of tragic twist to his character and so far all of the Yonkou we have met that aren't Blackbeard are pretty cool guys.</br></br>  <br>i like the new character</br>  <br>a tsunami will send him to the shore safely.</br>   Kaido is an emo emperor   Moria probably didn't even taste 10% of Kaido's power if he thought he had a chance to take on him with zombie Oars.  <br> Chopper gets a furry girlfriend </br>    <br><br>I don't think he intended to take him on with Oars alone.<br><br>The plan was implied to use Oars to gain shadows of New World Pirates and amass a fleet - he stated it during TB ('stronger allies').</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he try to jump to the ocean? Is he dumb?</br>  <br><br>We need to see more of Kaidou's past and personality, he does come off as an edgy emo in this chapter but it could also be something like just him being very confident of his strength and testing his limits in extreme ways, maybe he's just a brute and not really a tragic character.</br></br>  <br>I don't think kaidou has any interest in kid alliances. He will just leave unless kid is stupid enough to attack him.</br>  Mangastream translation is out.  <br>Put One Piece in the OP, you dumb fuck.</br>  <br> no One Piece in the topic <br>chapter release day cancer everyone</br></br>  <br><br> MS: Are you ready to become the princess? <br><br>Yeah Panda fucked up as usual.</br></br></br></br>  Niggerstream is out, time to actually know what the fuck was going on.  <br>Finally.</br>  <br>it is a minkwoman</br>  Kaido: I wan to live!  Why doesn't Kaido just provoke the admirals enough to make all 3 come at him at once? Or make one of his henchmen captured to pull a WB 2.0? Or even just walk into the Marine's HQ?  <br>Fuck it, I'm just going to link to the superior thread, even if no one is going to use it anyway:<br/></br>  MANGASTREAM IS OUT  <br>how many years has it been since he was mentioned holy shit im so happy we're finally getting somewhere</br>  <br><br>But that's pretty much what he's planning to do anon. The biggest war of the century which will probably include the marines and pirates going at him.</br></br>  Sounds like something else has happened after they had escaped from big mom ship.  So did issho intend to not go after the strawhats or what  <br>I'd say Blackbeard may have something more to him as well. Just look at him as a kid.</br>  <br> IF THEY DIE BECAUSE OF YOU I'LL STICK MY FOOT SO FAR UP MY... <br><br>Niggastream does it again.</br></br></br>  <br> people always said <br>nigger i thought whitebeard was the strongest</br></br>  <br>Kaidou has a huge scar on his chest. If he can't be hurt, who did that? Probably Shanks or WB. It says a lot of Shanks who managed to fight him and still make it to Mariejois</br>  <br>he cant be killed not hurt</br>  <br> implying Kaido didn't just spare him because something something honorable warrior something </br>  <br> was expecting Enel <br> Got kaido instead </br></br>  <br>Who knows, I thought he had incredible luck and some fucking endurance at that. Maybe someone like Luffy who has just as much luck.</br>  I thought WB was the strongest.  <br>Urouge was bandaged to fuck, so he likely fought him.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for his revel for like 12 years.</br>  <br><br>And he's dead.</br></br>  I don't have the slightest clue what happens in this chapter. If I didn't know better I'd say they skipped a chapter.  So does Kaidou actually fight things, or is he really just trying to die?  <br>Strongest creature.</br>  <br>Strongest man.<br>Kaido is probably not a man anymore, he may have a DNA fruit or whatever.</br></br>   the try to skewer him and the spears broke <br>Roger BTFO</br>  <br>Well sanji situation was offpanel.</br>  So Shanks made quik work of Kaidou while Kaidou could do nothing but just sit there, unharmed.<br><br>Yonkou rankings<br><br>BB &gt; Shanks &gt; Kaidou &gt; Big Mom</br></br></br></br>   Kaidou is a beast <br> Luffy has been fighting beasts for 2 years </br>  <br><br>Roger used spears?</br></br>  <br>I'm holding out hope we get Treasure Island end and he is this series' Long John Silvers.</br>  If Kaido has a fruit why doesn't he just drown himself<br>On a second thought,even if he hasn't a fruit.</br>  <br>They messed up on the 2nd to the last page's last panel, switching up the dialogue in a speech bubble with a text box. Geez.</br>  <br>His executioners did.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but Roger was still a 'man' I guess.</br></br>    Have we seen these "Mammoth prison ships" ?  What's up with this shit chapter?<br>Did I miss the chapter before?</br>  Devil fruits still work when in the water, right? You just can't control it. Is it the same for seastone?  <br>You're more likely to die hitting solid ground than the ocean. Plus its probably hard to tell if its sea/land below you from 10kms high.</br>  <br>fish would probably throw him back on land or something<br>dont want none of that</br></br>  <br>Glad I am not the only one who noticed that.</br>  what the fuck is this nigger stream  <br>KAIDO OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>NOWHERE</br></br></br></br></br>   Finally thing are happening:the chapter   <br>He would drown,unless he has magic lungs he shouldn't survive</br>  what happened with the sanji and the rest? I was too distracted by kaido to comprehend  <br>im liking choppers new attitude<br>maybe something happened on big MAMS ship</br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1552<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1551 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting Sylphy lifting Salama’s dress so its bottom is at her ribs, lustfully licking her navel as saliva dribbles down Salama’s cheek in ecstasy.<br> The cycle must be completed. </br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.

But I hope he doesn't get too edgy.</br>  <br>This is a chuuni show.

I don't even like imouto suffering, it's just hilarious how otaku pull out hairs over it.</br>  So at this point, we can confirm that the MC got his memories modified in some way.<br>He had a reaction when he heard Tomori's headphones. The episode is titled"The sound I once heard."<br>Maeda did say that the two pictures released a while back may not necessarily be chronologically left to right.</br></br>  <br> I dunno if he even finds her attractive, though <br>He found her cute in the 4-Koma.<br><br><br>You will never Charlotte's Charlottes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>she'll get kidnapped and he'll look right into that pizza sauce and start crying. calling it.</br></br>  <br>Imouto's not going to die so early.

I wonder if they baited Nao's bro to come out into the open and get himself fucked over like so.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we can confirm that the MC got his memories modified in some way. <br>How can you even confirmed something based on speculation?</br></br>  <br>We know what's probably coming, yet we're still watching it. Of course we're going to defend it.</br>  <br>There´s a 4koma? I didn´t know that.</br>  <br> I wonder if they baited Nao's bro to come out into the open <br>That makes no sense considering that many power users may not even listen to music at all.</br></br>  <br>There was a shitty scanlation for it.

I'd think if they were going for Caligula they'd say Caligula, though. But then maybe they're pulling a ruse or something. Seems like a Nasu sort of thing to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you stupid or do you just not understand the interview in question?<br><br>Heroic spirits can have guns, we already have two that have guns, we've had them for ages. He made a point of making one with guns already to show "See, it can happen, that's not the issue" for people like you that act like that's the issue.<br><br>The issue is that the gun has a hard time being the NP since anyone with training can sue it, and the NP needs a soul.<br><br>Essentially you can be a HS with guns, but you aren't going to become a HS due to feats you preformed with guns, like sharpshooting.<br><br>Billy the Kidd is listed as a heroic spirit in passing in Extra, because he did more than just shoot people, he was famous for more than just that.<br><br>You cannot get in just for shooting a lot of people, you need an actual legend, a legend that isn't derived by just gun feats. Fucking hell we've had heroic spirits that have had guns already and people still act like that's the issue. I could explain what this interview meant to people all day and they would still come back moments later "So guns are impossible then? Man Nasu's a fucking hack, I want my Russian Sniper servant". <br><br>No it doesn't say guns are impossible, but there are certain rules that make it a lot harder. Yet instead of people ever understanding this they just get people to agree with them "Yeah Nasu's a stupid hack" and just spend time doing that.<br><br>We have two servants that use guns already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>please dont tell me you pronounce caesar as "sea-sar"</br>  <br>It's Zhuge Liang(El-Melloi II), not sure what it means</br>  <br>I'm not sure, there are so many sabers in this game.<br><br>I think it's the left one.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ anon it's not like I called your mother a whore or anything.</br>  <br>Simo Häyhä should be a Servant. I'll keep calling Nasu a hack until he makes him one.</br>  <br>So can anyone connect to the game yet</br>  <br><br>atilla</br></br>    <br>To clarify it for the hundreth time<br><br>Reasons why its hard for a gun to be an NP, or a servant who uses a gun to be a servant. Not to say that its impossible, because that's not the case.<br><br>1) Its something anyone can learn with training, and the entire point of a hero is sort of "The one and only". The gun is the one credited for the importance anyway, since anyone can make it to that level with training<br>2) People don't think guns are super magical forged by faeries, they think they're just technology. Its harder to have legends about them<br>3)They're mass produced technology, a gun would have to be "The one and only" to even qualify in some ways.<br>4) You can't become a heroic spirit for gun related feats, since its still something anyone could do with enough training. You need to have been famous for other things.<br>5) An NP needs to have a soul, it must have a spirit in a sense, be alive. Not in the most literal sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  StrangeFake Saber will be in this game or not because it will be a spoiler for LN?  <br>Type Moon threads are serious business</br>  Fuck swords let's use guns instead. Lancelot did it before it was cool.  <br>This should be Nero's real appearance. Unlike that fatty, Caesar WAS a fucking general who battled.</br>  <br>What are they saying?</br>  <br>Is Sakura Saber in FGO?</br>  <br> 1) Its something anyone can learn with training, and the entire point of a hero is sort of "The one and only". The gun is the one credited for the importance anyway, since anyone can make it to that level with training <br>Same with spears, swords and bows.<br> 2) People don't think guns are super magical forged by faeries, they think they're just technology. Its harder to have legends about them  <br>People don't generally do this for melee weapons either.<br> 3)They're mass produced technology, a gun would have to be "The one and only" to even qualify in some ways. <br>Melee weapons also get mass produce. Unique guns exist just like unique melee weapons exist.<br> 4) You can't become a heroic spirit for gun related feats, since its still something anyone could do with enough training. You need to have been famous for other things. <br>Same thing also goes for melee weapons.<br> 5) An NP needs to have a soul, it must have a spirit in a sense, be alive. Not in the most literal sense. <br>So have a gun with a soul. Easy.<br><br>Once again, Nasu is a hack.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please, buy all this servants.</br>  <br>Nope, maybe they'll add her later.<br>The only other variation of Saber is Lily, but she's a pre-registration reward.</br></br>  <br>Nope.<br><br>Well those two are going to be in game in "some" form.</br></br></br>  <br>Full face helmet character is always the best.</br>  <br>They said in the comic they would put her in if registration hit 500000, and it did<br><br>She might be DLC</br></br></br>  <br><br>Might be too soon to say who's not in it<br><br>Even the most devoted player probably isn't quite that far yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that an edit or did they change her outfit?</br>  <br>Considering the game isn't even out of maintenance yet, no shit.</br>  <br>Kaizar.</br>  <br>Every servant has two forms, costume change. <br><br>No this isn't the same as having two classes.</br></br></br>  <br> DLC <br>weird way to spell gacha cards</br></br>   cute little sparkles when you tap <br>I love this shit.</br>  <br>All they did was cover her tummy. Lame.</br>  <br>He's Darius right?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>    <br>It's xarxes</br>  <br><br><br>Wouldn't he have no connection to Iskander if he was Xerxes?</br></br></br>  <br>Please. I need thug life saber in this.</br>  <br>I think that guy is the Indian dude who managed to push Alex's army back seeing he has an elephant. Plus he was a fighter compared to Darius who run away in battle.</br>  The majority if my favorite characters are from Apocrypha and Strange fake so I guess I'm going to be waiting a very long time to see any of them, huh. <br>I'm excited to see what the outcome of Arjuna vs Karna will be like.</br>  <br>Sieg and Janne already in the game.</br>  <br>I'm aware Jeanne is in there considering she's the poster girl and all but I didn't think Sieg would be in it? Is there a picture or servant card of him somewhere?</br>  <br>Considering GO is a reboot of the original Apocrypha game project, we'll probably see a lot of the Apocrypha Servants, especially when most of the ones that were cut when it was made into a novel series are in GO, plus Siegfried and Jeanne are already in, and so is Vlad, but as a Berserker. I'm expecting Mordred and Karna very quickly, at least.</br>  <br>Karma is 100% happening since the new archer is his rival from legends</br>  this look like a poor version of chain chronicles  <br>He was in the trailer.</br>  So, is it on another maintenance or it's region locked.  <br>it says server maintenance when you open the app</br>  <br>I'm still getting the maintenance message, so it's that. I've never seen a region locked mobage anyway, although some probably exist. Usually only the app stores are region locked, not the apps themselves.</br>  I don't know moon but I'll give this a try just for Red Saber.  <br>Wasn't shirohime quest region locked ?<br>The game have additional "quest" and "objective" based on your real life location, so you really must be in japan.</br></br>  google play store region lock is easy to bypass from the browser console, takes like 20 secs<br><br>probably shouldn't spread this info though since google may fix it</br></br>  <br>Or you could just use qooapp. Really it's simple to download and install</br>  <br> using shady chinese services <br><br>No thank you</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I guess that's a form of region locking, but as far as I can tell it's still totally possible to play the game in other countries. You just can't do those quests. The game itself doesn't lock foreign players out automatically or anything.</br>  <br>I'd never trust chinkshit. At least with Google, they already know everything about you.<br><br>And 20 seconds is not a long time.</br></br></br>  I just want Jean but I know I won't get one ;_;  <br>If other mobage are any indication, prepare to reroll A LOT for the change at any of the 5*, let alone a specific one.</br>  <br>Well I did create three accounts for the free Saber, so If I don't get anything good in the three of them I might reroll.</br>    <br>only way I know how to do it is use a vpn, and I'm not paying for a vpn just to play this game</br>  <br/>  I saw this apk on a Type-Moon forum. I installed it and seems legit, although the game is in maintenance. <br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#!VQBlCKZZ!9nm7H<wbr>iAt0gtokVcC2M5OwxruAKF5RQ3PQxBLQXHQ<wbr>oI0</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> paying for a vpn <br><br>Just use OpenVPN on your computer to open the google play page and add the game to your account.</br></br></br>  How's the game like?<br><br>And do they plan on translating it or will the fans have to do all the work as usual?</br></br>  <br>If you install the game like this be aware that it will not update, and I can assure you there will be updates that are required to play the game. Possibly as soon as whenever it finally comes out of this maintenance.</br>  <br>Uh really? Ugh, I guess vpn it is</br>  <br>Is there a lock on which device can run the game? Can't install on my nexus 7</br>  <br>Yeah, just downloaded my own version from the play store using a vpn from vpngate.net</br>  <br> free VPN <br>If their service was even passably good they'd charge money for it.</br></br>  <br>2012 n7? this game requires 2gb ram</br>  <br>Can't install from play store or cannot install from apk you've downloaded?</br>  <br>OpenVPN is a protocol, not a service.</br>  <br>1. it doesn't need to be good, I imagine you only need to have to click 2 buttons with it on<br>2.  free vpns are usually botnets, in the serious sense of the word, not the /g/ meme </br></br>  <br>I have a nexus 7 and it downloaded perfectly fine from qooapp</br>  <br><br>Guns came into a time where science starts winning over superstition and myths is all. People's reactions and how their mind interprets such legendary feats change. What is amazing becomes more quantifiable. People find more logical explanations. They can see and test the limits of what's possible through science.<br><br>When something is a symbol of an era that is anti-thesis to myths and magic, it's that much harder for it to become myth itself. It has to be just that much more blatantly magical compared to the time period as time goes on.<br><br>Either way, the user matters a bit more if they have legends beyond their use of the gun.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128791120 <br>Story mode?</br>  <br><br><br><br>2013.

I haven't gotten my email yet.  <br>Mathew was a tax collector why the hell does 'she' done an armor? <br><br>I don't give a shit about the genderbending, but could they at least choose someone who would make sense as a fucking 'Shielder'?

If they are going to do this shit after they were drilling how Arturia needed to keep her gender disguised, then they should be consistent. They can still wear fanservice outfits in game.</br></br></br>  <br>Is TM publishing directly? That's probably the key factor.</br>    <br>Aniplex.<br><br>Hope is dead.</br></br></br>  Is the soundtrack any good?  I'm going to uninstall this game so fast if Shielder really does end up being Matthew. It doesn't help that nips don't know how to write Catholic characters either so we're probably going to get the weirdest fucking lore out of shielder if she IS Matthew.  <br>X curry barrrrr<br><br>Merllirion asser</br></br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint<wbr>_Barbara<br> According to the hagiographies, Barbara, the daughter of a rich pagan named Dioscorus, was carefully guarded by her father who kept her locked up in a tower in order to preserve her from the outside world. Having secretly become a Christian, she rejected an offer of marriage that she received through him. <br><br> Before going on a journey, he commanded that a private bath-house be erected for her use near her dwelling, and during his absence, Barbara had three windows put in it, as a symbol of the Holy Trinity, instead of the two originally intended. When her father returned, she acknowledged herself to be a Christian; upon this he drew his sword to kill her, but her prayers created an opening in the tower wall and she was miraculously transported to a mountain gorge, where two shepherds watched their flocks. Dioscorus, in pursuit of his daughter, was rebuffed by the first shepherd, but the second betrayed her and was turned to stone and his flock changed to locusts. <br><br> Dragged before the prefect of the province, Martinianus, who had her cruelly tortured, Barbara held true to her faith. During the night, the dark prison was bathed in light and new miracles occurred. Every morning her wounds were healed. Torches that were to be used to burn her went out as soon as they came near her. Finally she was condemned to death by beheading. Her father himself carried out the death-sentence. However, as punishment for this, he was struck by lightning on the way home and his body was consumed by flame. Barbara was buried by a Christian, Valentinus, and her tomb became the site of miracles. <br><br>She'll make a good Servant with some tweaks (one of her symbols is a cannon).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>How about that CCC?</br>  <br>Actually aren't Aniplex bros? They've done a lot to promote UBW outside of Japan.</br>  <br>She's the patron saint of artillerymen, so she can be an Archer and a Caster I suppose. She's also a virgin for waifufags.</br>  <br>CCC came out in Japan 2 years after the Vita came out</br>  <br>Why wouldn't they, those asshole price gouge the shit out of their products. Gonna be spending triple digits on a single season of UBW, if Zero is any indication. They won't touch Grand Order stateside unless they can charge for it up front, or do some super heinous cash shop nonsense. It's all about the money for Aniplex, nothing else matters.</br>  When did this come out?  <br>She would be best girl so quickly but you know they would strip her of any potential elegance she could possibly have and make her design cum dump tier.</br>  <br>Point being though is they actually do put the products out there.

Volume 68 is also the worst selling volume in nearly a decade. <br>If there isn't an anime announcement in the coming months it is very likely that there will never be one. Jump waited too long, they squandered the opportunity to bring Bleach back to its former glory by putting all their efforts into finding a replacement 3B. Bleach is among the 100 best selling anime of all time (ranked 72 per 2013) and has some of the best ratings on TV Tokyo according to Ben Dalton who works as a producer there. There would've been no issue in bringing it back. This is the fault of Jump. Fans have sent countless mails, asked in events, pestered Kubo on twitter all asking when Bleach would return and the best reply was "it will return when the final arc nears the end". It is now nearing the end and with no anime in sight. Jump has abandoned us.</br></br>   morons still listen to music in YouTube   <br> it is now nearing the end <br><br>How could they possibly know this?<br><br>And the material we have so far is only enough for like 40 episodes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just the japs being retarded and reading right to left. Bleach is actually the 3rd place and has been steadily ranking higher the past few years.</br>  <br>It's quite obvious, anon. The SS are the last line of defense before Ichigo has to fight Yhwach, although the royal guard might join. Also Studio Pierrot are well known for stretching out episodes and adding filler. If the anime restarts that will undoubtedly rekindle lost interest in Bleach and sales will return.</br>  If Nnoitra hated the fact that Nel, a woman, was stronger than him, why didn't he ever bother fighting Harribel?  <br>Harribel is stronger than Nnoitra and would've beaten him easily. She also have a trio of fierce warriors who are willing to fight for Harribel, and can conjure up a Ayon.</br>  <br>Are you a fellow member?</br>  Why is Kubo such a Spanish-weeabo in the Arancar arc and a Nazi/German-weeabo in all this Quincy shit?  <br>I was, but lost my membership when the onemanga reader site closed down and reopened as onemangaforums. Haven't bothered to make a new account, I just go there for spoilers and stuff.</br>  <br><br>I think it's got something to do with Aizen.<br>Back when Nnoitra was harrassing Nelliel this was the old Espada, before Aizen took control.<br>All the Espada are fearful of Aizen's power and obey his command, Aizen is pretty chill but wouldn't allow infighting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would rather they just finish off the manga instead of starting the anime without it finished. All those filler arcs and episodes were annoying as fuck.</br>  <br>I think Nntoitra didn't mind Nel being a woman, but because she was merciful and thus weak in Nnoitra's mind. He couldn't accept losing to someone  he loved </br>  <br>What if Jump decide to put all their effort in bringing back Toriko's popularity instead?</br>  <br>Not gonna happen, Toriko flopped almost instantly. The anime was never even close to pulling its weight and manga sales took a huge nosedive in the months before the anime ended. They'll try to promote some other new serial over Toriko. Toriko had its run, now all that's left is to wait until sales are no longer acceptable and Jump cans it.</br>  <br> They'll try to promote some other new serial over Toriko <br>Black Clover.<br>It's even worse.</br></br></br>   bleach wont end with a bang, but with a whimper   <br>He was Tsundere for Nel.</br>  <br>mmmmmmmmmmmm rukia</br>  <br>Your anime is bad and you should feel bad.</br>   That Dfc <br> Those big eyebrows <br> That hairstyle  <br><br>HHHHHHNNNNNNNNGGGG<br>H</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> -makes our violently-</br>  <br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>Turns out the 3 characters he designed are playable. Togashi liked them.</br>  <br>He was in love with Nel, it was goddamn obvious. Dude is insane tho. <br><br><br>And Nel beated him easily too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope after Bleach finishes he starts doing artwork for videogames.</br>  <br>I hope he starts designing faggot clothes. I'd buy them to be honest since i'm getting /fit/ and moving to Japan next year to study</br>  <br>He should get a deal with Uniqlo, they've been expanding into Europe and North America</br>  <br>Top tier waifu</br>  <br> Orihime with red skin </br>  <br>I like the weapon designs. Even considering getting DQX and I hate MMORPGs</br>   Ulquiorra was 169cm <br><br>Jesus what a fucking manlet no wonder he was always depressed</br></br>  <br>Orihime is already top tier. Now she's a monstergirl. <br><br>Fuck off rukiafag, stay jelly</br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't depressed. He was nihilistic and hell he didn't even have a wicked sense of humor</br>  <br>Damn Chad should sue</br>  <br>In Segunda Etapa, he easily towered over everyone though, so it balances out.</br>  <br>What</br>  <br>Ulquiorra in his second form is slightly taller than most of the characters.</br>  <br>Kubo cant perspective</br>  spoilers when  <br><br>That's not the case, Ulquiorra is just lanky as fuck.<br>It's part of the evil bat demon aesthetic he has going.</br></br></br>  Needs to be in more things.

Don't bother with it, it will bleed you for money (albeit not as bad as other mobage)</br></br></br>  <br> it will bleed you for money <br><br>So it's shit, thanks for atleast telling me</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's fucking awesome. Gachas just cost money.</br>  <br>it's nowhere near as bad as most mobile games. but it did just launch so they are giving a lot of the premium currency <br>it also helps that it has actual gameplay</br></br>  <br>I want to play it but it's in japanese and not available here in playstore</br>  <br>It's all according to keikaku.</br>  <br>I've never read Toriko, but I'm absolutely certain that Black Clover is worse.</br>  <br> It is now nearing the end <br>I'll believe it when we Deicide 24 drops.</br></br>  wanpiss is out  I honestly just want Bleach to end already. I don't much care how, just give us an ending so that the fan fics can finally be set after the end of the series without having to make up a backstory each time.<br><br>Yes, I prefer fan fics over canon Bleach and have for a long time. That's just how shitty it's gotten.</br></br>  <br> I prefer fan fics over canon Bleach <br><br>How dare you.<br><br> Have you read Swinging Pendulum? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> actually reading fan fics <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>No, but I think I'll check it out.<br><br><br>There are a few really good ones in there if you know how to sift through the shitty ones.</br></br></br></br>  Spoilers are out. Pernida has the left hand of the soul king.  Do we have any idea what happened to Yachiru?  <br>For what purpose?<br><br><br>Current theory is she was sword the whole time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>kubooooooo etc<br><br>Kenpachi's sword. She vanished on the spot when he released his sword.</br></br></br>  <br>Stripped naked and then kidnapped</br>  <br><br> Current theory is she was sword the whole time <br><br>To have a sword and release commands, youd have to have a soul to imprint upon your sword. Im pretty sure Gremmy just killed her</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I dunno. Is this going to be a theme now? Lets gather up all the dismembered parts of the soul king? There's a good chance that the real final boss will be the soul king himself now.</br></br>  <br>nice try troll-kun</br>  <br>Yachiru's sword was stated to be unusual by Isane because of it being a guardian entity.<br><br>It also bears visual themes with Kenpachi himself and his sword. Also vanished when he achieved his sword's proper release.</br></br></br>  <br>Check bleachasylum.</br>  <br>That explains some things, but raises so many more questions.</br>  <br> Lets gather up all the dismembered parts of the soul king? <br><br>Perhaps it will involve a cross country race across America.</br></br></br>  <br>So fucking dumb.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I forgot how god tier this OST was. What do you think the current arc's soundtrack will sound like?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Pernida is the dismembered hand of the king himself it's possible that the legs are sentient too and if you gather them all up in one body the SK will return.<br>We're about to see why Yama was so afraid of him.</br></br>  <br>This is one of those situations where it's just too absurd to be a lie.</br>  <br> the fucking hand has the almighty <br>They're so fucked now.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck?<br><br>Chapter is out:<br><br>http://www.mangapanda.com/bleach/63<wbr>7</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>read the thread it is not looking good for the anime to return</br>  ITS OUT  <br><br>It's out surprisingly early.</br></br>  It appears that Yhwach said is true, when the arm was severed from the SK it also became severed from the will of the SK. This arm is convinced that he's Pernida.  <br>what about the soul king's poop? Is that why he was in a Crystal cause if he was allowed to poop that would mean a army of poop would cause the end of the world</br>  <br>At the very least this sinks the "Yhwach has the Soul King's left arm" theory. Well he does, but his powers are his own. He's without a doubt the son of the Soul King. The hand is using blut for crying out loud.</br>  <br>What about the poop LoN?</br>  <br>New theory: Yhwach has the Soul King's dick. I'm basing this on absolutely nothing.</br>  <br> implying that god poops </br>  <br><br><br>Kubo is gonna kubo</br></br></br>    <br>Orhime, Kenpachi, Ichigo</br>   mfw Askin Levaar is the Dick   Well that sure is bizarre. So pernida true from is the left hand of the soul king?  <br>if anything it's matsumoto.</br>  is pernida the masturbatory hand?<br><br>looks beefier than mimihagi</br></br>  All of a sudden this is a lot less cute<br><br>I like to think that even Yama wasn't such an asshole that he cut the man's junk off.</br></br>  <br>What is going on in the last page? Left arm name is wrong? Is that pernida speaking?</br>  <br>that's because mimihagi was keeping ukitake alive.<br><br>Also... now that both arms have been introduced... what about the soul king legs/feet?</br></br></br>  <br>I feel sorry for people like this</br>  Literrally EXODIA.<br><br>Any idea what Soul King's removal limbs based of any relgions or any of inspiration?</br></br>  <br>Actually if you look closely Pernida was quite atrophied too, it wasn't until after he broke the chains restraining him that he started growing. His "wrist" was practically just bone. But damn, this does raise a lot of questions. How big was the SK originally for one? No wonder his descendants are so goddamm tall.</br>  I thought Kenpachi was war potential or something or someone strong, why is he Chad-level fodder now? He barely won against that reality-warper kid but then was literally moments away from going to be killed by the babbi harpies and now he got absolutely floored by this hand thing. Why's Kenpachi suddenly a fodder after getting the title of "the strongest" from Unohana?  <br>He's not Chad-level, he literally got his shit wrecked by the soul king using high level blut techs. That's nothing to be ashamed about.</br>  <br>He hasn't even taken off his eye patch yet, though he can't really use two hands right now.<br><br>Kenny has always been the dumbest brick in the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Kubo wrote himself into a corner by making him a walking atom bomb</br>  <br>He applies brute-strength to fights where brute strength will get you shitstomped. And given how he could move his eyes after being paralyzed, he likely will overcome it through sheer will.<br><br> War Potentials are likely labeled as such because the Almighty power cannot see them. Probably. </br></br></br>  SK is Exodia  <br>Because he only knows how to attack and slash.<br><br>He's not made for thinking and he tends to fight chumps that try to face him head on instead of using their moves in interesting ways.<br><br>Pernida being a hand and not a person is not stupid enough to brute force against Kenpachi.<br><br>Now since he has some form of The Almighty I feel he's just baiting our favorite mad scientist into a trap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can only think of Osiris.<br><br> While she(Isis) raised Horus, Set was hunting one night and came across the body of Osiris. <br> Enraged, he tore the body into fourteen pieces and scattered them throughout the land. Isis gathered up all the parts of the body, except the penis (which had been eaten by a fish, the medjed) and bandaged them together for a proper burial. The gods were impressed by the devotion of Isis and resurrected Osiris as the god of the underworld. </br></br></br></br>  <br>We can make hilarious shoops out of this.</br>    <br> I feel he's just baiting our favorite mad scientist into a trap <br><br>but mayuri is making him angry by calling him the wrong name....<br><br> names have powers <br><br>of fuck you kubo all over again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do your thing. Long time no see LoN, labomen is still active? How are bleach threads disposed on the weekdays these times?</br>  <br>Perfect. Now for the penis.<br><br>I don't know what lab is up to. Bleach threads are more or less dead these days, I don't see much of him either.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>what... what if labmember got a job?</br></br></br>   pernida <br> it's an arm <br><br><br>He'll find a way home anon, just like I did. Maybe under other name, probably under no name. Don't ever think we brothers will be dispersed forever.</br></br></br></br>  So are we assuming that the SK's first appearance in which he has limbs was just an art error?  <br>I sure hope so.<br><br>Because this chapter DEFINETLY deserves a chart update.</br></br></br>  <br>he did?<br><br>I think he had part of the arms, but he was ever handless and feetless.</br></br></br>  <br>The second time he appeared he didn't even had those limbs, and it was not clear enough if he had feets and hands IIRC.<br><br>RETCON for sure, I'm almost sure we've even looked into the Tankobon version to make sure it wasn't corrected after the jump release, maybe it's time to check again?</br></br></br>  <br>Can be chalked up to shading. We never did see the limbs after all.</br>    <br>looks more like ishida</br>  THIS "WRONG CAPTCHA" KEEPS KILLING ME INSIDE.  <br>Then don't get it wrong.<br>Retard.</br></br>  <br>This is getting stupid.</br>  <br>Just buy a pass, goy. :^)</br>  <br>Well excuse me for being dumb. I am just frustrated that I am having problems accessing /a/ today in my country.</br>  This sure is a shitty fight. The twist isn't even anything special. Kubo really need to stop using the same old characters over and over again.  <br>Kubo make kenpachi looks bad in order to make mayuri looks good.</br>  <br>Do you really want Kubo to bake another batch of special snowflakes that nobody cares about?</br>  <br> The twist isn't even anything special <br><br>this is because nobody gives a fuck about the quincies, but I haven'0t seen anyone guess pernida was the left hand of the SK, which IS an important reveal, but as said, the impact of the reveal seems like nothing at allb ecause nobody cares about these quincies.</br></br></br>  <br>I am more interested in urahara and shunsui and some others in action.</br>  <br>He was his mustache</br>  Ywach's power is his Stache, shave him and he loses all his power  Why is kubo giving mayuri so much screen time in this arc?  <br>You make it sound like winning against the reality warper is easy</br>  <br>He's killed thousands of quincies. He knows his shit</br>  <br>Well, he did dissecate and studied quincies.</br>  JUST  WHO WAS LEGS  <br><br>What's odd is the right arm had limbs, the left arm does not.</br></br>  <br>The left arm grew, the right arm did too but not in the same way.</br>  <br>Yoruichi and her brother, I'm pretty sure.</br>  <br><br>I posted somethign like this during the mexico arc after chad's battle:<br><br> chan next powerup <br> "la pierna derecha de maradona" <br><br>Now... now I can see this happening with all this fucking soul king libs thing going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*limbs</br>  <br>Mah nigga!</br>  <br>We're probably not getting another anime at this rate, but it'd be a lot of shit of this kind of flavor<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jtV<wbr>d6RFWGgE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Only 2 pupils instead of 3 or 4.</br>  <br>I don't think it's important, just having the fact that it has almighty is a plus. Now they can fight back against Yhwach.</br>  The Right hand of god is power, the Left is knowledge.<br><br>The Shinigami were more powerful but it seemed that most don't know the truth of the world.<br><br>The Quincy while weaker now the true story or at least Ywach does.</br></br></br></br>  The only thing I want to know is if the quincy alternate dimension is Hueco Mundo or not.  The pacing of this fucking chapter. Pernida's appearance was teased as a cliffhanger 2 chapters ago and now two chapters later he see his face and who he is and literally nothing else.  <br>When will Bleach stop being boring? This is goddamn torture.</br>  <br><br><br><br>An akateko (????, lit. "red handed child") is a yokai, or Japanese monster, from the folklore of Aomori prefecture, specifically in the city of Hachinohe.[1][2] It appeared as an infant's hand hanging down from a tree.<br><br><br>A red hand? Mimihagi<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurao<wbr>kami<br><br><br>It talks about deities who lost life/limbs which then became gods in their own right. sounds like mimihagi.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When it finishes. I can't see any light nor end of the tunnel yet though.</br>  <br>Why bother with the continuation of the Bleach anime when they could easily make an (probably) much more succesful BHA anime adaption?</br>  Calling it now, Don Kanonji is the SK's right leg.  <br>Chadbro is the chosen one to replace the king in the end.</br>  <br><br><br> Bleachs resident mad scientist is about to fight part of the soul king <br><br><br>hurrr its le boring xD lets go post le cuck on /b/ xD lellelelel lel kek shrek xD<br> Kill yourselves </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only anime adaption of a jump manga that can match and surpass the Bleach anime is Gintama. Jump anime adaptions are promotion for the source material, it is exceedingly rare that they produce successful anime.</br>    <br><br>Yea let's talk about this. What's going on here?</br></br>  <br>at least give me a  hand  Pernida.</br>  <br>new chapter is up on manga reader<br><br> weird cloth figure is the soul kings left hand </br></br></br>  <br>You're doing this on purpose. Stop.</br>  <br> at least give me a hand </br>  <br>KUBO MAH NIGGA</br>  <br>fyra, what are you doing here?</br>  <br>OH MY GOSH</br>  we exodia now?  I wonder why Ywach turned the left arm into a sternritter, rather than just absorb it like he did the Right  <br>Prepare for flashbacks</br>  <br>because he coudl cotnrol it... to... do things for him?</br>  <br>He had no intention of becoming the Soul King at first. When he did decide to become the new god he grabbed the first hand that was available, which happened to be Mimihagi. Besides with a second hand with the almighty at least now there is a chance that someone on the side of SS will gain its powers. Mayuri probably doesn't want it though.</br>  <br>those long, loinely nights, he needed a  hand  to fight boredom.</br>  Chapter of the year tbh  BUT WHO IS THE HAND?  <br>WHO IS LEGS</br>  <br>WHO IS PENIS</br>  <br>9001 hours in ems baind</br>  What happens the Hand if all of the chains get removed?  <br>It has already removed all chains. The fun starts now.</br>  <br>yawach cums black all over the place</br>  What a dissapointing chapter, again. Kubo get your shit together.  <br>I wonder if pernida considered bitchslapping gerard for that comment.</br>    <br>Ohshit. He is named after a deity of lust.</br>  <br>The dick creates life. who do we know who creates life?</br>  <br>Shutara?</br>  Ukitake is confirmed alive?  <br><br><br>It wasn't shutara, it was Hikufune the one to create the artificial souls.</br></br></br>  <br>Aizen created Wondertard, who looks like young Haschwalth, and weilds a zweihandler</br>  <br>He's unconscious, bleeding and probably drowning ont he accumulated water on the lab floor, and all alone with Aizen.</br>  <br>Will Aizen give him a hand?</br>  How is this guy supposed to be beaten?  <br>she creates clothes</br>  <br>Getsuga tensho and nakama power  also known as the heart. </br>  <br>kirio has huge tits. creates food and life. the food she creates makes her lose weight upon making it. shes a mother.</br>  <br>Could he kill demonbane?</br>  <br>Asspull</br>  <br>I don't know, but Aizen will take the chance to do something, I'm pretty sure of that.<br><br>Will aizen use the hougyoku on uktiake and hollowfy him?<br><br>That would be rad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have we already had a <br> I'll just have to fight so crazily not even I know what's coming next <br> I-impossible!!! His movements are so erratic- there's no future prediction until they've already connected! <br>style of asspull?</br></br></br></br>  <br>With the same power, only a Quincy like him with the almighty can hope to beat him at this point. It is possible to overpower him, but with stock of all souls in the universe at his disposal, that's easier said than done.<br>You'll need a second soul king.</br></br>  <br>i thought aizen merged with the hogyoku before it rejected him...where the fuck is the hogyoku now?</br>  <br>WHO IS THE HEART</br>  <br>Kubo pulls an Araki and gives Ichigo something like pic related.</br>  <br>He can't predict the soul king. It's speculated that the 5 special war potentials also fuck with his ability to see.<br> Ichigo is everything so he's too murky to see <br> Ishida survived the aushwalen and Bach doesn't know how <br> Aizen can hypnotize him, therefore anything he sees might be kyouka no suigetsu <br> Kenpachi doesn't have any trick so even tho he can see Kenpachi, there's not much he can do against raw strength. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's weird to me is that it seems like Urahara despite being a master of keikaku was completely blindsided by this development.</br>  <br>still in his chest, I'd assume.</br>  <br>Kubo get out</br>  <br>You are /a/non ;_;<br><br>We talk about Bleach fordays every week. A heart has grown between us &lt;3</br></br></br>   it's the left hand <br>Get ready for the legs my niggas</br>  <br>The Hogyouko rejected him but he already fused with it. So it can't just leave Aizen. It also probably can't take back what it gave, hence Aizen's immortality.</br>  <br>Oh for christs sake<br><br>Urahara is only good at one thing. And thats make plans for things he knows is going to happen<br><br>Beyond that hes pretty much just the average genius</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> fuck you <br><br> I love you all guys </br></br></br>  <br>Yourichi gonna be confirmed for a leg. Who could the other be?</br>  <br>How will they pull it out concidering Ichigo is the only one able to touch him, whithout him being disintegrated? Will Ichigo be able to touch his heart?</br>  <br>Fucking footfags</br>  <br> bring Bleach back to its former glory </br>  <br>Nah, yoruichi si the ass of the Soul King.</br>  <br> it's soifon out of nowhere <br>pls no<br> hurr durr you were attracted to each other because you're one and the same </br></br></br>  <br> this is why they spread their legs so much </br>  <br>That tattoo tho</br>  <br>Ichigo</br>  Dangai is Soul King right leg, I shit you not.  <br>Ichigo being shrouded in darkness is possibly due to him being the one special quincy born every 200 years. Yhwach is not very certain when it comes to Ichigo, one moment he says he's going to recruit him, the next Yhwach wants to kill him and tells him it's his fate to die. Now it's unclear what he wants to do with Ichigo.<br>Aizen was fucking with Yhwach's senses while he was still sealed, it's not known if it'll work on him now.</br></br>  <br><br><br>WHAT<br><br>WHAT IF<br><br>WHAT IF THE HEART IS<br><br> The bond between kubo and the readers through years and years of trolling.<br/> <br> IT FALLS UPON US TO DEFEAT YAWACH. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dangai is the Dick. </br>  <br>We didn't see that tattoo during Deicide, though</br>  Someone post the behind you compilation.  <br> big male is fist weapons <br> small male is sword n board <br> girl is greatsword <br>based kubo</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kenpachi, Facebook, and Orihime go to Comic-Con </br>  <br> He can see the future <br> Facebook changes the past <br>Please Kubo.</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking Facebook.</br>  <br>fusion of all war potentials and SK limbs</br>  <br>I wonder if his fullbring power will be incorporated into his shinigami powers.</br>  <br> shinigami powers. <br>since when? i'm confused</br></br>  <br>Humans who die and retain their spiritual power in Soul Society have the potential to become Shinigami. This is like.. chapter 1 stuff anon.</br>  <br>What ARE the fucking Fullbringers and Ganju's magnificence up to?</br>  <br>oops this should be replied to </br>  <br>What does that to do with what I said?</br>  <br>This never made sense to me. Does this works for hollows/arrancars as well? Purified, go to soul society, becomes a shinigami.<br><br>Why the fuck do they never purify the arrancars? Do they count as various souls and thus when purified they'll split?</br></br></br>  <br>Ganju is with Ichigo in the Royal Realm. The Fullbringers are probably with Kuukaku and they're probably gonna crash the party with one of her canons. I still don't know how Aizen is gonna join the party, why did they even leave him?</br>  <br>The more important questions is how some souls are able to give birth to other souls. The Noble families</br>  <br> Do they count as various souls and thus when purified they'll split? <br>It has to be this, or it'd upset the balance of souls pretty fucking hard.</br></br>  <br>"we need you"<br>"okay"<br>"so, let's go"<br>"what about aizen?"<br>"errr, I did not think that far ahead, just leave him here with the chair".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he and ukitake will join Kuukaku , and will be sent together with the FB to the RR, with her cannon</br>  <br>I'd enjoy FB and Aizen having a conversation. Their powers would be pretty fucking broken together.</br>  <br>he can change the memories someone/thing of the past, not the past itself.</br>  <br>Ukitake and Ginjo will have a talk and finally show his backstory.</br>  <br>Aizen will bring down the royal palace.</br>  <br>Not really, the balance of souls only pertains to the amount of souls on each realm: Arrancar for instance have gained dominance over the lower souls and are therefore counted as one collective. It's hard to tell where they go after they're purified, since Szayel and Aaroneiro got sent to hell, but Ulquiorra and Stark were nowhere to be seen.</br>  <br>He literally changed the past of the floor so it would have a trap.</br>  <br>We have gone through this countless times, he does actually introduce himself into the past of anything he cuts. He did it to set a trap, then cut Byakuya and learned all of his weaknesses and techniques, and also made himself as fast by introducing himself as his mentor.</br>  <br>in an artificial dimension which was designed to his advantage</br>  Well played, Kubo, I surely did not expect THIS.  <br> ukitake <br> talk <br><br>how?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's just unconscious.</br>  <br>Rooted phone, game does not start ;_;</br>  <br>I am in stable employment for 9 months, if you need to know.<br><br><br>Next part of Exodia + Mayuri's science boner?<br> And JUST? <br><br><br>I'm dying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see <br><br>And he lost the thing that kept him alive for over 1k years.<br><br>Unless Aizen or someone else heals/saves him somehow, I don't think he'll be able to talk again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>A wild lab appears!<br><br> Do you need a  hand  with the chart update? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know where Ganju is. I want to know what he's up to.</br>  <br>Heh, yes. As always suggestions are appreciated. Less revisions that way.</br>  <br><br><br>To elaborate further on what I mean, I'm saying that he set something in motion. He DID something that we can't see the effects of yet. That's what I mean when I say "what is Ganju up to?"</br></br></br>  <br>Bravo Kubo, I know you're out there, just Bravo.</br>  <br> <br><br>exodia + mayuri boner sound good to me, but also kenpachi's defeat I guess...<br><br>Maybe include a panel with the 4koma guys yawning or some shit and add a "15 weeks of boredoom" or "nothign happens" to indicate the long overdue update.</br></br></br></br></br>   No backstabbing this chapter <br><br>Please Kubo, I need to do my work.</br></br>  <br>This</br>    <br> Arm is SFX </br>  <br>Chart upate incoming! chart update incoming!<br><br>This makes me happy!<br><br> Welcome back buddy. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe include a panel with the 4koma guys yawning or some shit and add a "15 weeks of boredoom" <br>This.

Think again  I can't wait to see the people being tenderly hugged.  Someone make an Ainz "FREE HUGS" pic.  I admit, Madara Uchiha is strong. But can they beat Touch Me? And I'm not talking about World Champion Class Touch Me with his Guild-Weapon tier armor equipped. I'm definitely not talking about World Champion Class Touch Me as leader of Ainz Ooal Gown, a top ten guild, equipped with full divine gear, Guild-Weapon tier armor, and capable of the special forest-destroying skill World Break. I'm talking about World Class Champion Touch Me with 100 levels in Justice Warrior, physical stats and all resistances exceeding the limits through a cheap build and P2W, with Guild Weapon tier armor, all of the World Class weapons owned by Ainz Ooal Gown, riding the strongest raid boss world-eating dragon because he's a fucking dragonoid, with help from 9 level 100 NPCs and 40 other level 100 characters.  <br> Clementine <br> highest point <br> A certain Chair has a few words for you.</br></br></br>  You are now in charge of designing a new Floor Guardian for Nazarik, and that includes it's floor.<br><br>Who would your creation be?</br></br>  <br> Includes it's floor. <br><br>OH NOOOO!  Forgot the word guardian in there? </br></br></br>  <br>the devil gundam</br>  <br><br>Speaking of Touch Me, if Pandora's Actor ever gets into any combat scenes I hope Touch Me is the one he mimics. 80% power is more than enough to curbstomp anything in that world, though it would be neat to see Pandora's Actor fight as itself too.</br></br>  <br>Tentacle rape monster.</br>  <br>Come on man, how could you forget the 11 World Class items of AOG?</br>  <br>There were 12, they used one.</br>  <br>An Undead, mechanical, skeleton, self-repairing, troll, Dr.Doom expy who has a habit of adding living creatures to his collection because he is a hoarder. <br><br>Best guardian ever, fact.</br></br></br>  Is Ainz firmly in villain territory after volume 9? Killing  Gazef  has to be pretty high on the evil deeds list, right?  <br> Cthulhu-like gigant monster that can freely summon his tentacles in any part of the floor.<br> The floor woulf be a hugeass labyrinth.</br></br>  <br>He can just resurect him with one of his rods.</br>  <br>Ainz has firmly been a villain since the climax of volume 2. He's just piling on extra villainous deeds to bite him in the ass eventually at this point.</br>  <br><br>What if that labyrinth was a underwater cave that leads to Gargantua's pool.</br></br>  <br>He very clearly said he didn't want to come back and Ainz respects him too much to go against his wishes like that.</br>  <br>I don't need a floor. Just this guy</br>  I'm so hyped for this.  <br>People keep saying this. How is it going to come back and bite him in the ass. It's not like the NW is some oasis of justice. What's he doing that the inhabitants of the world aren't doing on a smaller scale?</br>  <br><br>A Soul Eater, ever play Soul Reaver? Something that eats souls. Make it a little anime girl too, only make her completely uninterested in Ainz to stand out amongst the crowd. The longer she goes without sucking a soul out of something the more hideous and monstrous she looks. <br><br>Give her a big dungeon full of people she stocks to suck the souls out of, so they have a reason to protect villages and raise/protect them like livestock that they harvest now and then.<br><br>Dunno about class or racial stuff. Probably a magic user of some sort. Control effect magic centric or whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember the movie Cube? That's the floor.<br>The Guardian?

The best bet for justice will be some legendary heroes who were immortal or long lived, PD, players who get pulled into the world in future, or turning Ainz into a human so he has a mental breakdown from all that murder and torture.<br><br>As for how evil their actions are viewed to be, Ainz has already nearly committed genocide against non-humans and killed thousands of humans effortlessly. How long are their neighbors going to feel safe near them?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I like it.</br></br>   Papa Bones panicking about teaching sex-ed to his younger kids <br><br>fucking<br><br>adorable</br></br></br></br>  <br>basara nekki pls go.</br>  Cocytus is the best guardian<br>that is all</br>  <br>At the start Nazarick probably couldn't. But all of paranoid Papa Bones' and his children's' preparations behind the scenes just looking for information built up their power base in the world, enough that they can go out openly without being afraid of being overwhelmed.</br>  Serious question: who's cooler, Ainz or Barragan?

Papa Bones even gives her a great big cuddly hug!</br>  Worry not peasants! Justice is here to save the day!  <br>All I can see in this image is Momonga, Touch Me, Uldett, Tabula and Simmering Teapot. <br>So who are the other two in the back?</br></br>  <br><br>A Giant ethereal tarantula, with no bullshit human form; She's just a big ass spider who is voiced by Satomi Arai. Shelltear loses the third floor, which now is a giant gave system of really narrow passages filled to the brim with spider web.<br><br>The Guardian can't attack you in the physical world. but the catch is that the web deals 5% of HP and MP damage each second you keep touching it. The web can't be destroyed by neither physical or magical attacks. The only way to pass through without taking damage is going ethereal.<br><br>If you go Ethereal she's able to attack you using all sorts of poisons and debuffs. The two spells she likes to use the most are: one that forces everyone in an area out of Ethereal form for 1 minute and another that forces everyone in an area to move, if they stop they get silenced for 2 minutes.<br><br>Her abilities and spells include being able to walk through walls, spawning giant, non-ethereal, spiders from corpses and being immune to fire, poison and water.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>What useful advantages for war did they really gain though? Their intel is limited to only two countries and it isn't all that impressive so far and they don't know much if anything of value about the Theocracy. That's not even touching on the demihumans who are more powerful than the humans who they know nothing about.<br><br>The only advantages they've given themselves so far are: 2 pitiful sources of income, ties to a not so impressive goblin army, a country of even weaker lizardmen, corpses for some decent undead, maybe an alliance with the kingdom and empire, and access to a guy who can use any item. The might of Nazarick even from the onset dwarfs all this stuff to the point where it wouldn't really make any difference.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I forgot to mention she's the  smugest  being in Nazarik.</br></br>  <br><br>Does anyone know where I can find the previous stuff from this guy? Mainly volume 9 chapter 2 and 3 spoilers. I've searched Overlord and Vol 9 in the archives and came up with nothing.</br></br>  <br>Would you love her, knowing what she really looks like?</br>  <br>I wonder if she'll ever enter the limelight by vol 9.</br>  <br>By gaining alliance to this two country, they can gain their intelligence network. Demiurge and Albedo said this in LN because they lack manpower in intelligence gathering.</br>  <br>I would. Try me</br>  <br> cube <br>fuck that's terrifying to think of a thousand people trying to get through the floor with numerous traps and endless possibilities to the next cube.<br><br> read up on every mainstream phobia <br> fill every cube with traps that would induce people's greatest fears. <br> never ending, cramped, fear factory </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, Barragan lost to the writer. If not for that he could have basically soloed all of Bleach.</br>  So is this worth picking up and if so why?    <br>Is this her true form, because that's not really all that bad.</br>  <br>You're a true husbando Anon. I hope she doesn't eat your face off if you ever meet.</br>  <br><br>But she'd make such a great yandere hatefuck.</br></br>  <br>which one? he's currently got Shalltear and Evileye</br>  <br>Nah, she's still wearing her mask. I don't have it, but her face doesn't look any different that an ant.</br>  <br>Anon, her face is a separate bug...</br>  <br>if you de-bone her after you hate-fuck her. i don't care.</br>  <br>She's a Gunner. She uses weapons completely unheard of in the New World. Which makes her stand out, given that most of Nazarick's operations until Vol. 8 were covert. <br><br>She'll pop up more often now that Nazarick is out in the open; hopefully to teach humans how to use the great equalizers.</br></br></br>  “Come to think of it, Mare, why do you dress like a girl?”<br>Hearing Demiurge, Mare pulled on his skirt in an attempt to cover his legs. “This is because of Simmering Teapot-sama. She said this is called ‘a trap’, I am very sure of it.”<br>“Ah… So it Simmering Teapot-sama’s idea. Well with your body it should be no problem… But do youngsters usually dress like this?”<br>“Th-, that I’m not too sure.”<br>“… Then we should talk to Momonga-sama about this. Perhaps we can make all the youngster dress like this... "</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reverse Shounen, Evil Skellington gathers up his palls and goes on a quest to take over the world while killing a lot of people in the process.</br></br>  Are the battle meidos flesh / living?<br><br>What are those shrine-maiden looking chicks with the third eye?</br></br>  <br>birth of the chair.</br>  <br>Most of the meidos are either blobs of some kind or monsters.</br>  <br>Look at it this way: one's an acidic slime, another's a doppelganger, another's a dullahan, there's the insect meido and the robo-meido and the wolfie meido.</br>  <br>You mean ALL the maids are monsters. Even lastborn is an immortal human. Meaning NOT human.</br>  <br><br>Different guy, but I found a pic. Ugh.<br>Maybe I shouldn't pick this up after all.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuri is a Dullahan which is undead and CZ is a battle cyborg.<br><br>The third eye chicks are Shalltear's vampire brides.</br></br></br>  <br>Three phase guardian battle.<br><br>1. phase is a throne of god which constantly spins and reigns fire and holy attacks down on the players below. It is slow but teleports whenever it recieves more than 1% of damage to its entire life pool. <br><br>2.Once you drop its health below a certain point it transforms into a cherubim of four faces wreathed in wings. Each head takes a turn attacking from afar using different patterns (One summons dominions, the other calls down holy light, the other buffs adds, and the the last one casts debuffs). It does not engage directly, but instead quickly zips through air to avoid being targeted.<br><br>3. In the final phase the cherubim is consumed by wings, emerges as a seraphim and ditches ranged attacks in favor of a massive lance which it uses to swoop down and impale players before dropping them from great heights and turning around to strike again. Attacking from any point but melee range causes it to repel and reflect attacks using the swirling wings<br><br>The entire floor would be a massive cathedral with grand orchestral music playing constantly and monster priests and paladins constantly spawning from the stained glass mosaics. The former buff the main floor guardians and the paladins while the latter rush the enemy screaming "DEUS VULT!" As the fight progress the priests are replaced by angels and the paladins are replaced with nephilim warriors armed with giant spears.<br><br>In the first phase the orchestral music is calm and serene as are the movements of the ophanim and the priests. The second phase starts with a booming choir singing O Fortuna. Final phase turns to a rushed and sort of broken up mix between choir and music.<br><br>When the guardian dies the church turns silent as the main dome slowly collapses and turns into a circular stairway leading upwards into a scenery of clouds and gentle singing voices before the following floor.<br><br>That would be my ideal guardian floor. Imagine pic related as the first phase.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Ainz would spam Muda just once I would poop a 1lb diamond.  <br>Post it please? As far as I know, an illustration of her real face has not been made.</br>  <br>You're the reason why the residents of Nazarick look down on humans so much.</br>  <br>Left to right:<br>Dullahan<br>Werewolf<br>Girl made of bugs<br>Automaton<br>Doppelganger<br>Slime/Cthulhu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Looks like something straight out of DMC4.</br></br>  <br> her face is a separate bug </br>  <br> DMC4 <br>abbreviations are against the rules</br></br>  <br>Nothing special</br>  <br>I couldn't stop thinking of credo while writing it to be honest.<br><br>I fucking love his design, and the angels too.</br></br></br>  Hello.  <br>So where is the original then of the Doppelganger?</br>  Guys.<br><br>People will definitely vector Ainz guild emblem and use it in their mmo guild logo soon or later. You guys should do it first instead.</br></br>  Do any fleshbags try to enter Nazairick?  <br>That's the human form her creator gave to her. She can assume either form freely.</br>  <br><br>You're the worst.</br></br>  <br>Literal premise of volume 7<br><br><br>That's fanmade, but she's even more beautiful than I thought she would be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Left to Right :<br>Bully, Turn to chair, Fuck, Marry, Love Tenderly, Kill.</br></br>  I cannot wait for how she reacts when she can't vent her "urges"  <br>You wouldn't survive the night.</br>  <br><br><br> See her "hair"? That's just pincers/legs coiled up </br></br></br>  BTW, wouldn't the other Guardians go berzerk on any traitors?

Image related is also fan made and you can compare with the real thing.</br>  next episode is narberal and  potion girl.   <br>Oh shit, I didn't see the annotation. Didn't look complex enough to be So-bin's.</br>  <br><br><br>i was thinking of something non-chibi<br><br>but i guess i'll have to settle for this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thinking you could bully Yuri Alpha. <br>How foolish.<br><br>Also why kill the slime, I thought she was one of the more popular maids?</br></br></br></br>  Are humans able to mate with monsters, because if I marry one of the monster meidos and have a kid that should I mean I can technically join Aias guild?  Do we have these guys in Nazarick?  <br> that narberal in the corner. </br>  <br>Stern girl are the best bullying target, imagine her blushing face.<br>As for solution, I just don't like how she easily shows her naked human form to mere bandit.</br></br>  <br>Eh. If they're compatible somehow. There's the people with dragon blood in their bloodline, after all, plus Black Scripture who are descended from some players.</br>  <br>The circled one on the left and the other behind Demi are his level 80+ demon lieutenants<br><br>The other circled one is one of Aura's 90+ monsters.</br></br></br>  <br>If  Sebas gets to invite his girlfriend to the guild  then I'm sure Ainz would let the maids do it too.</br>  <br>Left red hair : no idea<br>Middle black beast : one of aura favourite's beast<br>Far Right : Shaltlear's vampire brides.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Red-haired guy is a demon who serves Demiurge, he shows up in the second episode when Ainz tries to sneak out.<br><br>Middle one is one of Aura's pets.<br><br>Girl on the right is one of Shelltear's vampire brides.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so do they fight against eachother for fun or what happens?</br>  <br> space whale <br><br>sunrider hype</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz hugs her to death.</br>  <br> .............read the novels........... </br>  <br>Those vampires look like fucking elfs, fucking disgusting.</br>  <br>Don't bully me, but I was thinking sort of a disease ridden hovel, with the floor resembling some form of ancient ghost town filled with plaguebearing monstrosities hiding in every corner. The Guardian would be a cleric/blackguard specializing in spreading disease, pestilence, and plagues through both direct casting and weapon strikes.<br>I really like using disease for some reason.</br></br>  <br>way to spoil the secondaires shitlord</br>  <br> Vampire brides <br>I want to see some vampire bride bullying.<br><br>Also, why'd the author change Arche from sex slave to food/decoration?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>eat a dick</br>  <br> Not wanting to see Narberal bullying instead <br>Also, the author killed her off because the novel readers were given the chance to vote on it.</br></br>  <br>how many side stuff or spin off material does Overlord have so far? RIght now I'm just reading the LN volume 4.</br>  <br>Technically, she doesn't get invited to the guild. She gets invited into Nazarick. Only other players can join the guild proper, and only with majority vote.</br>  <br>It has two drama CDs (the first volume of which is fully translated), a manga and a 4koma or chibi version or whatever about the Meidos will pop up soon.</br>  Wait the vampire loli becomes a traitor? Was she was cute too.  <br>neat, are these drama CD bundled with the LN or something? When in the story did it take place? I'm at the lizardmen right now.</br>  <br>It's ok, you still have another vampire loli</br>  <br>She gets mind controlled by a World Class Item by someone in the Black Scriptures of the Slane Theocracy. Ainz 1v1 and kills her then revives her to remove the mind control.</br>  Okay so <br><br>Players did exist other than Ainz?</br></br>  <br>They are bundled with some of the LN but I don't know which one they correspond to. The first one takes place after volume 3 but before volume 4. I don't know where the rest take place, but I assume it will be a similar timeframe.</br>  so if a guild member happened to not  be killed through complete disintegration, could they still be revived via resurrection wand?   It's a pain in the ass to do the Lupusregina chibi.  <br>Drama CD takes place in between Volumes 3 and 4. Dunno about the second.</br>  <br>Do her and Shalltear ever meet? Because I want to see that.</br>  <br>A giant wrestling ring. The floor guardian is an orc luchador who can only be fought hand-to-hand. Using weapons, magic (including support magic), or items causes the luchador to become enraged at the dishonorable attack, knocking other players out of the ring as he charges the offender and instant-kills them with a suplex with no saving throw. Players knocked out of the ring can only reenter once either the luchador or the remaining players are defeated.</br>  <br> it's hinted most of the heroes of legend and other powerful beings were players from yggdrasil </br>  <br>does Nazarik go against the Theocracy in the future?</br>  <br>I wonder how Ainz would fair against Space Marines anyways.</br>  <br>Naw, but she's pretty weak so I doubt Shalltear would be interested in her (by pretty weak, I mean she is a several hundred years old monster who destroyed a kingdom by herself).</br>  <br>Yeah, but hundreds of years ago.

It would be funny to see him bully other legendary beings.</br>  <br>There's an updated one with like 80 and considering the number of OP in this thread, I think that's quite fair.</br>  <br>context?<br>any spoilers?</br></br>  <br>just  Evileye running into Demiurge and going "welp im fucked" </br>  <br>Silence</br>  <br>She doesn't die and I swear to Ainz if the author kills her off....</br>  <br>He asked who helped Ainz pick up his sword.<br><br>In the LN it mentioned several maids and his conversation with the maid(s) about leaving never refereed to them in name. <br><br>In the anime they're just replaced with Narberal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz isn't even the strongest caster in AOG.</br>  <br>Ainz was an above average player with a shit build and that was it.<br><br>He wasn't the strongest in his own guild and wasn't even the strongest caster.</br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't the strongest in the game, but with how his powers work in this world he could be much stronger than most players who built their characters to work off the game mechanics.</br>  <br> She doesn't die and I swear to Ainz if the author kills her off.... <br>Then you best check the polls and vote early and often. Them Japs like their meat dead.</br></br>  <br>I'm tired of this meme. His build isn't shit, it's just not combat spec'ed. He was an above average level 100 caster and with his gear he was mid-top tier. Ulbert was a stronger caster, but Ainz was still pretty strong. His spells are also very useful in this world compared to the last.</br>  <br>Of the players that came before, Ainz is in the best position to influence the future, particularly of the human race. <br><br> Other players came with others, so they often argued and inhibited any real development; others came in isolated and their reforms were limited in scale. The current status of humanity in the New World is on the brink, they've only survived so far because of the biases of the players. <br><br>Now we have Nazarick, absolutely ruled by Ainz, with his power base in the human nations. He doesn't need to negotiate or argue with anyone; and he has the unquestioning loyalty of powerful minions ready to do anything he desires, with or without the cooperation of the New World inhabitants.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw I accidentally open a spoiler containing why shallchair wear this armor in one of the first thread for the 1st episode <br>I felt so bad that I decided to read the LN.</br></br>  Draw-fag pls  <br>Sub Basement: Several Trap doors in the Tomb lead to it.<br> Filled with waist deep water <br> The guardian is a Deep One looking monster <br> Kills via drowning <br> Bad at talking to people and carries around a spray bottle when above water to keep moist. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not to mention that after volume 9 he became one of humanity's representatives as Momon and the biggest source of hope against the unkown danger of Ainz Oaal Gown.</br>  <br>No. But he does have incredible equipment that only money can buy.<br><br>I think we can all say from experience that no matter how shitty your build is, money can always make up for it.</br></br></br>  <br>My floor would just be Mr. Bone's Wild Ride. No need for a floor boss, the ride is enough.</br>  <br>His build was shit. It was negated by very common endgame gear/abilities/Gatcha shit which made him relegated to support.<br><br>It's not "shit" in the sense that it's an unplayable mess but it really is "shit" in the sense that he could have gave up the RP build for something that would have been better offensively or better as a pure support role.</br></br></br>  <br>Puzzles<br>Lots and lots of disgustingly convoluted stupid puzzles.</br></br>  <br>Good point.<br><br>It will also be hilarious when someone (aside from that village warboss girl) finds out that Momon and Ainz are the same person.<br><br>It'll probably be Narberal's fault again, too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His build was shit. Having good gear has nothing to do with the fact his actual skill and job setup are mostly just status effect things since the instant death mechanics are negated.</br>  <br>Demiurge does it for me in this one.</br>  <br>The guardian is just a voice mocking the people solving the riddles.</br>  <br><br>OK, can he be called strongest necromancer?</br></br>  <br>Wheel Skeleton floor<br>Enemies: Wheel Skeletons<br>Guardian: Giant Wheel Skeleton who revives all the other Wheel Skeletons on the floor when aggroed.</br></br></br>  <br> common endgame gear <br>Except the average level 100 players didn't even have a single piece of divine equipment, whereas Ainz has a complete set.<br> abilities <br>He has above the cap of magic power and a shit ton of spells to go with it (a lot of which shown fit with Ainz Ooal Gown's PK nature), so I think thats not just incidental. His special super magic may be, but not that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Definitely, especially considering his RPing got him a secret class.</br>  <br><br>Make sure to include one of those overdone puzzles where you have to hit a switch using a statue that mirrors your movement.<br>There's no way a raid will ever keep its shit together long enough to clear it.<br><br><br>Probably.<br>I think the only confirmed thing is that Ainz has no peer in terms of number of spells or MP pool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you<br> Yearn </br></br>  <br> &gt;reading novels. <br>fag</br></br>  <br>a guardian for a floor like that is overkill.<br>imagine if the mimic ability is to teleport you right to the start once you found the floor exit</br></br>  <br>don't forget the chess battles where the raid has to become the peices</br>  <br>His build is literally shit. He literally outright says that if his gear wasn't so OP, he'd be low tier, bottom of mid-tier at absolute best.</br>  <br> no using a Sphinx monstergirl as guardian  <br>0/10</br></br>  <br>Oh god, an ever-shifting maze dungeon with nothing but Wallmaster-type bullshit return to start enemies.</br>  <br> floor next to Papa <br> im fine with being as his pet </br></br>  <br> low-mid build that relied on being more geared than others AND working together with top tier players never striking out alone  <br> meme </br></br>  <br>Fucking edgelevens, stay away from Narbe-chan.</br>  <br>Why not have a floor be a maze with no exit? No way for invaders to progress and the members of Nazarick could bypass it with the teleport rings.</br>  Kirito &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any shit on overlord.  <br>Don't worry about it anon, she's gonna start getting some secondary interest in the next 4 episodes.</br>  <br>But then people will have something to hit out of frustration.<br>Unless you make it supertanky and have insane damage reflection.</br></br>  <br>But Ainz-sama already has a pet.</br>    <br>Come back when you have real pauldrons, kid.</br>  <br> Extremely complicated labyrinth full of jumpscares, because even if you character is a level 100 full Divine equipment badass, the one controlling it is still a little pussy.<br> Floor Guardian is a scary as fuck demonic-zombie-thingy that is weak as fuck but keeps teleporting away and suddenly appearing in front of you and scaring the shit out of you.<br> By the point they clear the floor everyone in the raid would be crying or asking for a rest so that they can change their pants.</br></br></br>  <br> no making it if they kill her she cast mass teleport in the floor <br>0/10 apply yourself</br></br>  <br>Where are these polls?</br>  Has anyone shopped Ainz on Mr. Bones Wild Ride?  <br> And people get randomly teleported to different points of the floor, so they have to deal with the scary shit all by themselves.</br>  <br>Anyone else noticed the large influx of skeleton pictures in other threads since OverLord started? <br><br>Has /a/ transitioned into the bright new age of papa bones?</br></br></br>   Purple hair on a purple background <br>Fucking great</br>  <br> her <br>Excuse me but non-humans are to be referred by the pronoun of "it" not "she, he, her, etc. "</br></br>  <br> purple background <br>What fucking background are you using?</br></br>  <br>That's racist, yo</br>  <br>Sup, fa/tg/uy here.<br><br>We like skellies over there.

Yet. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> find people from the party you came with <br> &gt;it's a mimic </br></br>  <br>This purple (or black, I don't know) background</br>  <br> you have a few minutes to realize what they are and kill them before they scare you <br> people start killing each other out of pure paranoia <br> Genius.</br></br></br>  <br>Monstergirl floor.<br><br>First the entire floor is covered in a thin film of slime from which slime girls spawn in waves and try to take off your armor/rape you into submission.<br><br>Giant trees all about that entangle adventurers and spawn dryads to suck their semen and forcibly marry them despite not wanting to.<br><br>If you avoid that then the floor turns into an open plain where centaurs will challenge you to a duel with your virginity as the prize.<br><br>Even after defeating them the plain is full of holes from where lamias will greedily snatch you and pull you into their homes to act as their darlings.<br><br>The floor guardian is a dragon girl with the ability to spawn weaker dragon girls (from her eggs). She doesn't kill, but instead detains and mind controls any adventurers who make it that far so that they think they actually do want to marry a monstergirl.<br><br>Dare you enter my magical realm?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  i'm so fucking hyped for this series, it makes my week.  <br>The Floor Guardian will be the final boss from Drakengard 3 (pic related) with the floor setting being the same.<br>To mix things up there will also be 4 pedestals which can only be used by one person at a time for which the enemies of Nazarick to use.<br>Each pedestal will have their own individual color as well as an emergency stone button in the shaped of a flower. <br>Firstly: The pedestal will allow the enemies to send out waves of magic which are the same color as the pedestal which can counter and nullify the Floor Guardian's wave of magic, but only if the waves are of the same color. <br>If the enemy sends out a wave which does not match the color of the wave the Floor Guardian sends out, the pedestals are deactivated for 2 seconds and the enemies will feel an intense pain.<br>If the Floor Guardian's wave of magic hits the enemy, the will be insta-killed, this wave will also travel across the whole floor so every other enemy who is waiting behind will also be killed.<br>As the song progresses, the rhythm will change and the speed and variation in the colors used will increase.<br>Secondly: The emergency button can be used by the enemy at any time throughout the rhythm battle. This will activate a shield which will protect only them from the waves throughout the battle. Once activated, their pedestal will be disabled and the other emergency buttons for the other 3 pedestals will also be disabled. <br>As a sign of hope the remaining enemies will be able to continue their rhythm battle until the Floor Guardian sends out a wave with the color of the disabled pedestal in which case, with no way to counter and nullify it, the rest will die.<br>The Floor Guardian is non-sentient and the color of wave produced is random so they may still live.<br>In order to add more stress, the pedestals are at different distances from the Floor Guardian, so the enemies further back will have to send out waves quicker in order to protect the others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   He was not only considered special, he was known as one of the best ability users on the server. <br>Ainz can't be completely shit then, right?</br>  <br>As a player of course not. He's part of a tiny ass 41 man guild that managed to make it to rank 9 at it's peak and has the game's most untouchable guild base.<br><br>But that doesn't mean his build itself is shit. Remember most of those bonus 300+ spells of his are just random shits and giggles at lower tier. He probably has a lot of utility but when it comes to real PvP you kinda ignore all that crap.<br><br>Even his vol 9 super magic is considered gimp compared to other super magic, cause in Yggdrasil you won't have 70k scrubs to feed off of.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>his build itself isn't shit*</br>   Ainz Ooal Gown was a PVP guild <br><br>were they as dickish as Serenity Now? because I can't think of another guild that can even get close to topping them. <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/IHJVolaC8pw  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br>they weren't just a pvp guild. They did other things.</br>  <br>Ulbert might have been quite a dick but that's mostly due to his chuuni flaring up so he's acting in character rather than straight up being a faggot.<br><br>And well since they use majority votes on matters, I doubt a bunch of guys with jobs would bother with deliberately pissing people off when they are more busy building up their waifu palace.<br><br>Also they PvPed hardcore mode with surgical strikes and shit since the game made death and stuff matter instead of just rezzing and acting like nothing happened. They didn't just zerg rush, well not that they could with a mere 41 players.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where the fuck did Hamsuke and Deathorb-chan go after volume 3?</br>  <br>I don't think it really matters that there were 41 players considering they can use NPCs to make up for the numbers. The vast majority of the guild alliance that raided Nazarick was made up of NPC soldiers, after all.</br>  <br> the first one to get killed was the PC of the dead girl <br> My sides.</br></br>  <br>Relegated to the Drama CD</br>   Black Finger dude says blonde loli can defeat Shalltear unless she has weapons. <br> Shalltear's weapon is the only reason she doesn't get stomped by the rest of Nazerik <br><br>The irony is great.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the only reason?</br>  <br> Eight finger <br><br>Doesnt recall that converstation</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck! I have never had my autism triggered so hard by you retards!<br>I literally just spent half an hour staring at all of the post script illustrations trying to figure out how any of you faggots could confuse So-MOTHERFUCKIN-Bin's sketches with something fan made.<br>Goddammit, I feel like I'm going to pop of friggin' blood vessel here!<br><br>On the plus side the first anon realized his mistake and it's nice to see /a/ starting to recognize the glory bug meido.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because Anon-kun somehow fused Black Scripture and Eight Fingers together.</br>  <br>So is that face just a mask?</br>  <br> It's Black Scripture and he didn't say that.<br> Loli said she could beat Shalltear if she used all the OP items the Six Gods left behind, but she was talking about regular Shalltear, not the one with the armor and the Divine class lance.<br> They never mentioned the possibility of Shalltear using weapons or how it would change the battle.</br></br></br>  <br>not Prinny Baal?</br>  <br>Good point, though based on the novels I was under the impression they played it really safe and ganked the fuck out of their enemies and never bothered to just overwhelm them with raw numbers or power. <br><br>After all sinking in tons of cash for npcs and what not would only dry up your money in game and in real life leaving you ill prepared to defend against others. All 9 worlds were connected to each other so basically it's one super server with little to no phasing. At least not like MMOs today where you can hide in safe zones from others.<br><br>I mean fuck I don't even think there's a god damn bank in Yggdrasil. If there was they wouldn't need to store WC items in the guild base. It's a wonder how a culture like Japan where PvP games aren't even welcomed much would manage to sustain 12 years of norse fantasy EVE. <br><br>But then again Yggdrasil didn't have selfies and twitter integration so maybe the future isn't as cancerous with carebears.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br><br>There are a bunch of secret societies in the books. Eight Fingers, which are the slave trading, drug dealing, dick ass thiefs. <br><br>Six scriptures are an elite group from some country but they're holy and religious in theme. Holy this and that etc. I think they are from Slieane Theocracy or what ever, I dunno. <br><br>Then there are the platinum adventurers which are formed of small cells called teams. Team red, Team Green, Team Brown etc. One cell that is made up of all human girls is called Blue Rose. They have Evileye, a long lived mage girl, and some other bitches who's name aren't important, cause they aren't brought up in the book that I read a lot. Momonga (Ainz) and Narbel make up the team called Bl4Ck, cause they're edgy as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The cutest mask<br>Based Genjiro had good taste</br></br></br>  <br> Then there are the platinum adventurers which are formed of small cells called teams. Team red, Team Green, Team Brown etc. One cell that is made up of all human girls is called Blue Rose. <br> platinum <br><br>You guys are just doing this on purpose.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You guys are just doing this on purpose. <br><br>I read 4 novels in two days, none of the names and such stuck well, mostly because the books only make passing references to those societies and characters. <br><br>If you could jot out a chart of whom is what and what they belong to, I would very much like that.

I heard they had to apologize for it, but I mean I heard it wasn't really against the rules because it was fair PVP zone.</br>  <br> I'm surprised no one told the ones doing the funeral about the raid coming to fuck shit up.

I don't know shit about tabletop games.</br>  <br>Yeah, i also thought that Pathfinder/D&amp;D 3.5 is the right system, only you need to incorporate some kind of Race Level System and adapting it with a Class System that supports 100 Levels. Also rewriting most of the prerequisites for objects and advanced classes. It's an unholy amount of work.</br>  Is this going to be single cour or two-cour? working my way through the the LN and it seems fun so far.  <br>Single. Madhouse basically got hired by Kadokawa to do a slightly more expensive advertisement for the light novel. Same deal as No Game no Life.</br>  <br> slightly more expensive advertisement <br><br>But the quality is cheaper than Vanadis. The only superior aspect of it's production is So-Bin drawing the ED.</br></br></br>  <br> I think he meant that for once they gave a fuck about pacing and getting shit right, instead of rushing through it and making a shitty adaptation like most LNs get.</br>  <br> tfw I actually listened to the 10 hours opening while reading through Vol 4 </br>  When is Nazarick going to be curbstomped  <br>Never. Even if there was some super Smite Evil-specialized paladin that was even remotely close in level to one of the floor bosses, Sebas would still stomp him.</br>  <br>Oh well that makes a lot more sense. But I don't think that's something that requires more money, all it requires is the publisher saying "Animate these volumes in 13 episodes". <br><br>I highly doubt it costs more money to slow the pace down when animating light novels. If anything it's cheaper since you don't have to change the scenes so much.<br><br>Which is why it always bothered me. Why rush? It's more faithful and it's cheaper.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muda  <br><br>when he can be spamming mudomudomudo deathspells everywhere</br></br></br>  <br> Because you want the people watching it to see all the cool shit the LN has so that you give a boost to its sales, but usually those kind of LNs don't get really interesting till later volumes.<br> Also, sometimes there isn't a good point to end the season in the first volumes, so you end up animating a whole arc, like with Vanadis.</br></br>  <br>Which makes it lucky for us that Overlord can have a decent ending in 13 episodes since Volume 3 is just great that way.</br>  <br>That's true I guess, but by that logic they should just give more episodes. Not everything is like Overlord with neat segments of 3 volumes per arc. <br><br>Well either way, I still don't think pacing is something that should be attributed to cost. It's a decision based on the designs of the novel itself and doesn't really play into how much the studio can change since I do believe the publishers have the final say.<br><br>I wouldn't even go so far as to say the publisher for Overlord is not retarded, since if they gave it a few more episodes they could have at least kept all the context important dialogue/monologues that were cut, like oh I don't know the foreshadowing for Clementine and the Black Scripture that shows up within these 13 episodes? Wouldn't even need another cour just like 3 extra episodes, maybe even 2. Kinda like how Saki Achiga A did it ya know?</br></br></br></br></br>  Kadokawa could actually care less about how the anime is handled as long as it results in increased book sales. Everything else on top of that is bonus for them. This is why we will never get No Game No Life S2 because the novel sales went up by millions.    <br>Fuck you Anon this boss took me 4 hours</br>  <br>Wouldn't making a S2 increase the sales up even more? Or did SAO S2 not do the trick? I know Raildex was popular enough that the BDs themselves made profit.</br>  Who's the creepiest overlord?  <br>They could always show it in the next episode</br>  How strong is Ainz in comparison to the people of this world and in comparison to the mmo?  <br> In the MMO he was in the upper-middle ranking because his build wasn't minmaxed.<br> In the New World he is a fucking living God because so far the strongest dudes who have showed up didn't even reach level 50, and Ainz is level 100.</br></br>  <br>We don't exactly get hard numbers.<br><br>Ainz would probably be in the top % of YGGDRASIL players but he built for RP, went for a sub-optimal build so he would get curb stomped by any serious PvPer. lvl 100 as we know<br><br>New world strongest human characters are level 30(still get 1 shot by a noob level 100, the thing Ainz summons in ep 3 is a level 35 mob, mid-tier skill for Ainz) - some stronger characters but overall nothing that rivals any of the stronger nazerik characters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The floor is a network of organic, earthen tunnels. Small enough that you have to go through them in single-file. Sometimes you even have to crawl through them.<br><br>The roots of above-ground trees penetrate through the tunnel walls, always hanging into your face. They are wet, and move slightly on their own. A few large roots have tentacle-like tendencies, grasping at passers-by. They're not really dangerous, you can easily escape them. Unless you cut them off, then all the roots in the environment will start getting agitated and emit a foul smell.<br><br>The inhabitants of the floor are a swarm of light-eating, burrowing insects.<br><br>Cast magic? They eat it. Illuminate the room? They grow stronger. And if you exhausted all your sources of heat and light, they will come for your body heat, burying into your skin, into your organs.<br><br><br>The floor guardian is a phoenix, encased in shell of those insects, reducing its own strength but feeding the insects in turn, allowing them to multiply endlessly.<br><br>So if you find a way to fight the insects, hard but possible, then you have to cleave through the shell of insects protecting the phoenix.<br><br>Attack the phoenix and its blazing flame will grow stronger because you remove insects from its shell. To the point where it becomes so hot that the dungeon wells start to melt into rivers of glass.<br>Cease attacking and the insects start multiplying again.<br>Defeat the phoenix and after a short time it will auto-revive in a random place in the floor, starting to feed the insects again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he sacrificed 70K of the KINGDOM'S troops to summon horrible monsters to fight the kingdom.</br>  <br>To expand on this the death knight Ainz summons in episode 3 is level 30 and he can summon several of them as well as higher level ones. That's how big the difference in him and the New World is and he's not even the best in YGGDRASIL though probably has the best items.</br>   In order to gain the strength to accomplish his goal, he needed a weapon. He was willing to throw away everything else for the weapon of his desires. <br><br> Magic weapons were expensive, but the one he truly wanted wasn’t any ordinary magic weapon. <br><br> Further south, past the Kingdom—was a city in the middle of a desert.  <br> Amongst the goods that occasionally flowed out from that city was a weapon that, even unenchanted, far surpassed the cutting ability of ordinary magic weapons.  <br> It had a price to match, so much so that people’s eyes would pop out of their sockets upon seeing it. That was the weapon he wanted. <br><br> And then, he had finally managed to obtain a 「Katana」. <br><br>This is what Japan really believes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What level were those angels?</br>  <br>It's a game, thus it's true in the game world.</br>  <br>Folded over 10,000 times.</br>  <br>That just proves that at least one of the Eight Greed Kings was pic related, except he actually had a stash of Lv.100 katanas to back it up.</br>  <br>No they can't, because all that information was done when Nigan was preparing to kill Gazef and later on when Nigan compares Ainz's ability to the Black Scripture. How the flying fuck could they show it the next episode? Is Nigan gonna have a flash back while being stuck in Neuronist's dungeon getting raped by a dildo?<br><br>Do you realize how much MORE time you actually spend if you do that rather than just include that shit right then and there?</br></br></br>  <br> No change in Ainz. <br>Moemonga is best grill.</br></br>  <br>You haven't even seen Cocytus' swords which were made by his chuuni samurai creator calling himself a Japanese thunder god.<br><br>Yggdrasil was literally EVE Online + Second Life + DnD as an MMO. If you question mere katanas when there's a fucking robot maid with a machine gun equipped with a CD player you need to reflect on your priorities.</br></br></br>  <br>Brain's katanah gets invalidated like 2 pages after that.</br>  Best guardians.  <br>This "twins have different coloured eyes on oppsite sides" shit is more overused than "video game becomes real".</br>  <br>Considering how Gazef oneshot the angels, probably around level 10-15.</br>  <br>These two are arguably the least likely to cause trouble for Ainz, out of all the floor guardians. Mainly cause they act like children making it very hard for them to fuck things up for Ainz who treats the NPCs like children.</br>  <br>Tell that to the Shoggoth that made them.</br>  Animeonlyfag here.<br><br>Will we ever get a battle against two characters sort of equally strong? Or will it keep being papa bones being OP, cool and one shitting everyone?</br></br>  <br>I don't think level is given, but the big one summoned from the crystal can cast up to 7th tier magic, and 7th tier is stuff of legends in the New World. Again we don't get exact numbers and stuff but 7th tier spells would be high but nowhere near strongest spells in YGGDRASIL<br><br>Magic goes tier 1-10, then over-rank which is basically unique OP skills.</br></br></br>  <br>This is literally played for laughs you faggot.</br>  <br> traverse through the mind numbingly horrific cube <br> meet the Mimic <br>   he swallows you whole <br>   inside him is another Cube dungeon </br></br></br></br>  <br>In book 3, yes. It'll be episodes 8-12, probably.</br>  <br>We get a scene where our MC tries his hand at swordsmanship and gets shat on by a more experienced person.<br><br>If you want a legitimate 1v1 fight, you'll have to wait until the last few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-HM<wbr>xtBR2740</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This, but the entire floor is the guardian and it's conscious, magic doesnt work on him (or inside him) and there is a strong gravity magic that increases the more strenght/agility you have.<br><br>If you cheat you are teleported back and you have to do the whole thing again. The monsters there aren't strong but if you cheat they get respawned. Oh and the music gets weirder and creepier every time you fail, the level gets harder and the gravity stronger (for everyone) if you fail/are teleported everyone in the level is notified and a familiar skeleton laugh can be heard.<br><br>Instead of eggman there is a giant ghost skull that is fast as fuck, doesnt do damage but has a lot of hp and loves to fuck around with people</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd create the floor similar to the hall from the mines of Moria, a generic wide space with less pillars. The guardian would be a generic hulking man who uses melee based lightning attacks. The fight begins as a simple and seemingly easy tank and spank until he dies. Everytime he dies he gains more hp, more base damage and adds an extra phase this would go on for at least 6 stages. It would like this: <br>1.Tank and Spank <br>2. Gains flight, summons massive pools of lightning on ground from air. Impossible to hit while in the air.<br>3.Gains an aura of lightning causing constant aoe damage<br>4.Gains a healing ability. Heals himself for %10 hp at %75, %50 and %15.<br>5.Final stage. Gains an enrage mode at 15% hp before the heal. Turns into DPS race.<br>Seems a bit OP I'd probably test it and tweak it a bit before releasing it.<br><br>The guardian himself would be the boastful warrior type who often indulges in hedoistic activities. He laughs loud and has no filter due to the fact that he doesn't care. He's not afraid to speak up to the masters but knows his place and is ultimately loyal and willing to give up his multiple lives for the cause.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hedonistic*</br>    <br> not 7 guardians </br>  Several hours to the invasion of earth by Stardust, no YuYuYu thread, let me correct it  <br>those pairings i mention can be reversed in role because it's only my speculation</br>  <br>Pray with me, brother.<br>The time will surely come.</br></br>  <br>It's obvious that one of them will die first and leave the other to either be with some random guy or forever alone.
