[ ITT: Shit anime you don't understand how people can like so much    <br> pic unrelated </br>  <br>That was originally going to be the show I opened the thread with until I remembered the piece of shit that is KC</br>  Haruhi  <br>My nigga.</br>  <br><br>Two of my favourite shows. Kill yourselves bunch of faggots.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you. Only bad thing about this was  Producer being a cunt  and  Iori being a bitch </br>  <br><br>Really, Bear? Really?</br></br>  <br> Inaba <br> Body swap was okay <br> Reverse aging was okay   especially for loli Inaba <br>It was okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes people hype up Yahari so fucking much and it's so bland, especially the second season.</br>  <br>You didn't have a problem with every single arc after the first being shit? You must have pretty low standards</br>  Inaba is literal perfection.<br>And she even won.<br><br>How is that hard to understand?</br></br></br>  <br>Inaba is overrated as shit. It's the only good point people make about that show and I didn't like her that much.</br>  <br>Just when I thought you were mah nigga, you fucked up.</br>  <br>I'm sorry /a/non. Perhaps in a different lifetime we could have been great friends.</br>  <br>First arc was the best thing out of it, and should have been the entire season.<br><br><br>I'm afraid the problem here is You.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You just have shit taste.</br>    <br> Inaba <br> overrated <br>confirmed an homo</br></br></br>  <br>I like it for the trap</br>  <br>this</br>  <br><br>plebs pls</br></br>  Birdy Decode. Especially compared to the original Birdy OVAs  Inaba is a bitch and Taichi should have actually tried to help I or I overcome her identity crisis.  <br>The anime started out good but just turned into repetitive, white knight, wish fulfillment.</br>  <br> he doesnt like muh favourite show <br> must be pleb </br></br>  <br>Jojo</br>  <br>Inaba was nice til she went full dere. All /a/nons care about is their favorite girl "winning" when the prize is shit.</br>  <br>There's someone who's willingly self insert as Taichi?</br>  <br>I agree. It was very mediocre after the first arc.</br>  <br>Pic related<br>I even made a video about it just for shits and giggles<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=38w<wbr>JfqT8KZE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> pitiful humans your souls are wieghted down by earth's gravitational pull kill yourselves now to be free! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but I was thinking about how to solve their problems in the least selfless, beta way.</br>  Pretty much the majority of shit I see on /a/, but I do love Arc-V.  <br> tripfag scum <br>opinion discarded</br></br>  Pic related.  <br>I love  Kumiko reaction, special snowflake wannabe, and obligatory KyoAni filters. </br>  <br> asuna is cute </br>  <br>Can someone tell me the appeal on this one?<br>Cause I see threads being spammed but I don't see any reason to pick it up</br></br>  <br>Show may be shit but Inaba is best.</br>  <br>/8maninhighschool/ or something like that.</br>  <br>those people hate the show now because 8man grows up beyond an edgy high schooler</br>  <br>I know. He's turned into something far worse.</br>  <br>but dereban is the best inaban anon</br>  <br>You misspelled 'loli Inaban'.</br>  it isn't shit but rose of versailles is probably the most overrated thing ever, even more overrated than legend of galactic heroes  This  <br>I like your taste.  But stay away from my beloved daughter, looking is alright but no touching allowed. </br>  <br>I loved Baccano but I felt like I needed to watch it twice to really enjoy it</br>  Not even bait. I seriously don't get this show. The art style is bland and all the characters are just tired stereotypes. Also the animation is like a PowerPoint.  <br>You see anon, the problem is just that you have bad taste.</br>  <br>This, dereban was like eating so much caramel chocolate that it becomes disgusting.<br><br> I also ended up liking Iori more, because I like broken girls </br></br></br>  Somebody explain to me what makes Toradora so good because I don't see it.  <br>Iori a  cute .</br>  <br> Responding to obvious bait <br>ISHYGDDT</br></br>  <br>Only normalfags like SAO because it's "cool" and "epic" enough to blind them to its numerous crippling flaws. I'll never understand how they don't get warded off by all the attempted rape and incest, though.</br>  <br>Prison School</br>    Anyone know any similar shows where people deal with paranormal in an enjoyable and thought provoking manner?    <br>/a/'s most discussed anime of the season.</br>  <br>Is actually been a fairly controversial show on whether its good or not. At the very least its not uncommon to find some people calling it bad. So I dont think its bait.</br>  <br>Your taste is just plain horrible</br>  <br>Kill me baby. It's not even that popular, but I cannot comprehend how anyone could like it at all.</br>  Fate/anything<br>Raildex anything<br>Jojo</br></br>  <br>The first watchthrough is breathtaking.<br><br>Then you go back at it and realize that only the first arc, besides a few other moments, is worth something and it actually feels rushed.</br></br></br>  I wouldn't call it shit but it's barely above average. Not only does /a/ like it, it's right up there on mal and is apparently loved on reddit (according to /a/).  <br><br>Answer: you are just kinda dumb and dont understand it like some people cant understand math or writing or history. You are just bad at it.</br></br>  any yurishit<br><br>and ZZ gundam</br></br>  <br>The series itself was actually pretty decent - nothing breathtaking, but decent. After they started milking it for what it was worth it started going downhill fast.</br>  <br>Good premise but the characters were too boring.</br>  <br>fair enough</br>  <br>I'd say the first season of JoJo was a decent, fun series, but when SDC started it went downhill pretty quickly. A year of Monster of the Week bullshit and all we get is an okay-tier fight with Dio. And a shitton of QUALITY.</br>  <br>The bit where she starts shouting about Luigi.</br>  <br>you should do an episode about log horizion<br>its like sao if sao was good</br></br>  Miia.  <br>On the front page</br>  MIIA  Smaller Mia.

Or something like that.</br>  <br>It has much more than a school setting since they have on the job training as engineers as well as a corporate plot line</br>  Please don't mock sensei today. He's trying his best.  <br>isn't that tomorrow?</br>  <br>I want to marry Sensei.</br>  <br>Is it though? Is it anything?</br>  <br>No, you're confusing it with A/Z again. It's today.</br>  <br>Supposedly it will be clear by ep4.</br>   Motivated by his own speech.   <br><br>Great, he's turned into the jaded veteran who drinks instead of doing something useful. I hope he gets over it off screen.</br></br>  <br>Sensei a shit.</br>  who /Engineer/ here?  Half an hour to go.  Who /purple Inaho/ here?  <br>She's the reason I'm watching this.</br>  Who /yuriOTP/ here?  <br>Engineers best A-TECs</br>  <br>Girl Inaho/Orange Girl best couple. The guys can fuck each other, everyone's happy.</br>  STARTING  Sensei got rekt<br>Also dat Kobayashi Yuu</br>  <br><br><br>Me</br></br></br>  What was that about a spin-off about Iris and Mizuki?  Well done sensei, now they're all unemployed  <br>I can't into moon. What happened?</br>   that part where Iris tried to console Mizuki   Is Nagisa homosexual?  <br>how was it I missed it</br>  I want Nagisa to look down on me.  Suddenly Nagisa ass.  <br>  grill?  </br>  Too much dialogue, I didn't understand shit.  This seems to be shaping up what I wanted Plastic Memories to be, company stuff + a group actually working together instead romcom drama. Also Christmas cake flirting with underage man. Lot of good faces thanks to Igarashi.  <br>Dat ass though.</br>  <br> Dead fanbase. <br>There was no fanbase in first place, retard. To die something must exist.</br></br>  <br> bullies Sensei while encouraging him to try and drag him down <br> ignores hot woman in a towel <br>You tell me, anon.</br></br></br>   no capper on futakuro <br><br>Completely RIP.</br></br>  <br>I can't figure out my opinion of this show is. It's kinda shit, but I'm still intrigued.<br><br>Pilot best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Same. I'm still watching for GirlNaho, Mizuki and maybe Sensei. Also they said episode 4 was going to be important.</br>  I watch it for OreImo art style  <br>Sera was made for bullying</br>  I just want a show about mechanics ding mechanics things. . . <br><br><br>Pretty sure this is as close as I'm going to get.</br></br></br>  <br>Same.</br>  The only consistently good thing about this is Iris giving zero fucks about absolutely everything (except of course Mizuki).  <br>Iris is the only reason I watch this crap.<br><br>Her blowing off the Edgelord Buisiness guy is great</br></br></br>  <br> Igarashi storyboarding this episode <br>Can't wait</br></br>  Sensei was moe today.  <br>To be fair, there isn't any caps of Shokugeki no Souma episode today on futakuro as well.</br>  <br>TBS must be fucking up something then.</br>  Episode was 95% talking and money drama, the rest was Sensei drinking, Nagisa shower scene and 1 second of Iris/Mizuki. Still going to watch the next one.  <br><br>That only means that no one cared to be capper in there</br></br>        Who's this bitch    <br><br><br><br>Reminder that Nagisa finds this less interesting than working on the computer and angsting in the shower.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how successful men are made. You can't get to the top if you're weak to flesh.</br>    <br>Dat ass.</br>  Why do people link Purple with Inaho? I thought she looked more like Yuki.  The cutest.<br><br><br>Which Inaho are we speaking?</br></br></br>  <br>What other Inaho do you know?</br>  <br>She acts exactly like Inaho. So she's either Female Inaho or Inaho and Hime's lovechild (because she has Hime's VA)</br>  <br><br>I guess you mean A.Z Inaho then? I didn't watch A.Z S2 and wasn't sure if I'm remembering the name right.<br><br>I see the similarity but the fact that she's not MC and is openly recognized as a super-talented person who's been fished out from all over the nation as opposed to just being coincidentally there makes the whole thing much more believable and less obnoxious.</br></br></br></br>  Sensei will save A-TEC next week. I believe in him.  <br> complaining about mecha MC coincidentally being there </br>  <br>Because they are retarded newfags<br><br>Except Inaho was planning everything and was backed by the eye, Iris is completely reckless</br></br></br>  <br><br>I watched almost no mecha shows in my life but going by the only other one I remember, Buddy Complex, holy shit you're right.<br><br>Didn't know this was a thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Inaho was completely reckless whether he planned things or not.</br>  HS is up now    <br>Yes! I can finally understand boring business crap and Nagisa angst.</br>  <br>Inaho confirmed for beta<br><br>Iris confirmed for alpha.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get why you bother watching it if you find the business stuff boring.</br>  <br>Is she also female L-Elf/Yuuki Kazami as well?</br>  <br>It has potential. I'm waiting for A-TEC to start fighting back not just them getting BTFO because their fucking around isn't profitable.</br>  How long until Iris will fall for Nagisa for real?  <br>fuck off, this is maruto's first attempt at yuri</br>  <br>They're both gay, so never.</br>  <br>Iris and Nagisa are brother and sister from the same mother, you mongoloid.</br>  <br> Oreimo character design <br> MC is a 20-something old dude <br> Male ass shoot <br> ED takes place in Yuri Land <br><br>Just who is this show aimed at?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both reckless but stoic types who do everything for a girl. They're whatever that means.</br>  <br> yuri <br>Stop it<br>She obviously was disgusted by gay antics of her friend in this scene<br>Yes, even autist like her showed real human emotion</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>    <br>Everyone other than shounen, haremshit and straight romcom fans.</br>  <br><br>Take off those anti-yuri goggles.</br></br>  <br>Maybe there's some medication that could help with your autism, anon.</br>  <br>And if you think that's not enough, read the lyrics of the very same OP.<br><br>It couldn't be any more blatant really. Absolutely no holding back on this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Iris seems pretty into Mizuki, but it doesn't seem to be the same way in reverse</br>  <br>Lyrics about her and Nagisa, retard</br>  <br> ED takes place in Yuri Land <br>Like Hyouka's first ED?</br></br>  <br>Anon, you're cute.<br><br><br>The ED has Mizuki being all over Iris, and the show showed us Iris being all over Mizuki.<br><br><br>Not really.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking retarded<br><br> takes away all the tools <br> use your creativity <br> told to top-end R&amp;D </br></br></br></br>  <br>He is going to get orange as a rebound.</br>  <br>Iris and Nagisa are sibling, retard<br><br> Nagisa knows her name <br> ED shows Iris being all sad and shit, hinting sad past <br> Nagisa is a bastard child <br><br>HURR HURR</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is dumb.  Not enough female Inaho.  No I don't want the cute nerd boy to leave  I still don't get the point of this garbage anime  <br><br>Maruto wanted to try something different from haremshit. Unfortunately, it backfired.</br></br>  <br>Seriously? It was pointed out the most simple way possible in this episode. Just drop it if you can't follow it even that much.</br>  <br>It's a clusterfuck</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/notcycaiyt.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Don't worry, it'll catch fire eventually, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br>  Podracing when?  <br>How exactly, or are you just spouting out words? So far it's very simple story of two plotlines, Nagisa VS his brother and Sera trying to save A-TEC. And both of them are getting connected together.</br>  <br><br>Your face is a clusterfuck.<br><br>How fucking ADHD do you have to be not to get what's going on in this show?<br><br>Well, some parts are complicated. Nagisa's exact intentions aren't clear yet, but that's all.<br><br>One of the better shows of the season so far if you ask me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Salarymen are right - the anime</br>  <br>now rei clones are called "female inaho"</br>  <br>It's just for the Mars setting retard.</br>   she sees your budget management   <br>Monstershit and haremshit prison are right next door.</br>  <br>That makes even less sense though given the amount of mecha newfags on this board its no wonder they think A/Z invented everything</br>  <br>Is Yuu Kobayashi typecast nowadays?</br>  <br>Yeah, A/Z is now also the only mecha anime that did the generic Mars/Spacenoids VS Terrans setting. Now I get why everyone on this board compare anything to that forgettable show, it's the only war themed anime they've seen.</br>   there are people that honestly haven't realized that edgy oreimo-man and girl inaho are going to end together   This ending reminds me of the Hanamonogatari ED.  <br> I am this blind </br>  <br>Without a doubt. It's sad considering the range she can do.</br>  <br> there are people who are honestly going to force this meme in every thread from now on <br><br>We need context-sensitive mods so we can successfully report shit like this.</br></br></br>  I really enjoy Nagisa and the accountants side of things compared to the A-TEC team. To see Sensei get absolutely laid into both Nagisa and Accountant in the beginning felt so satisfying to watch.<br><br><br>The engine the class was working on in the very beginning looked like Anakin's podracer engine.<br><br>When it gets up and running, someone better shout "IT'S Working, IT'S WORKING!" or else I'll be very disappointed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's the only war themed anime they've seen <br><br>While that might be true, A.Z is still fresh in the board's memory, hell there have been comparisons a lot of comparisons with Valvrave too. There's no need to get all butthurt only because you watched some other entry level mecha like Gundam.</br></br></br>  <br>If you've seen lot of robot war anime then it's just another forgettable one among many others. It did nothing special and it doesn't really deserve the attention it gets, whether it's positive or negative attention. Comparing CC to AZ because both have Mars setting in them(when you can barely even notice they live on Mars here) is just ignorant. I'm surprised people still even bother remembering it.</br>  <br><br>I hate it.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter if it deserves the attention it gets or not, people still keep talking about VVV or Cross Ange despite both being absolutely horrible too, they just happen to be quite recent or left some impact in the board, for one reason or another, when they were airing. That's all there's to it.</br>  <br>It's even worse when A/Z never actually explored the Mars setting at all so the comparison makes even less sense. I would have went with Rei-clone, female Chirico or hell even a female Setsuna since at least they're more popular.</br>  <br>Do you actually think this will be a thing? /u/ bait very rarely becomes anything more than bait.<br>There probably won't be any romance at all.</br></br>  <br>You've never had a job with a shit boss?</br>  They have no creative spirit. Terrible engineers, all of them.<br>This anime hits me in the right spots though. I'm enjoying it.</br>    <br><br>Yup, she's also Smith from Monmusu lol<br><br>Well, Iris is Miia, and Mizuki is Papi as well...</br></br></br></br>   tfw your teacher fucked up with his naive dreams and you now have no education or experience for any real job <br>Becoming a boipussy is the only choice.</br>  <br>10/10 hank hill ass.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>I have yet to watch the episode... they fired shortpants?</br>  <br> boipussy <br><br>Wait isn't that a girl?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure you understand how art works.</br>  <br><br><br>Why are you so autistic about this? At this point you're just bringing more attention to A.Z. Let it die in peace.</br></br></br>  <br>Does Subaru sound like a girl's name to you?</br>  <br><br> Get OreNoImouto character design <br> Do a speculator ass-shot with it <br><br>Sure, why not?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He left on his own, he's the rocket tester and can't do shit in those conditions.<br>Though I'm hopeful they all come back and can do podracing again.<br><br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was a girl called Subaru last season.</br>  <br>Fuck these kids and fuck the teacher. Bunch of spoiled self-entitled cunts.</br>  <br>He quit.</br>  <br>Well, yes.<br> Also most Japanese names are gender-neutral, newfriend. </br></br>  <br>I hope we will see them cry like bitches the moment they realize they did the wrong choice.</br>   nii-san   So Nagisa's broher is hogging the money to his own pocket and uses A-TEC as excuse?  <br> Does Subaru sound like a girl's name to you? </br>  <br>MC saved A-TEC. Had he left them in their state they would have disbanded in less than 3 months.</br>  I want to fuck girl Inaho and watch her stare blankly into my eyes.  I'm really enjoying this. It's Maruto and all, but I hope this continues to ignore romance for the business and regular drama.  Is MC a faggot?  I skim through the episode now after the first ep.<br>It's so fucking boring.</br>  The Glasslip of the season.  <br>He has no time for needy Christmas cakes</br>  <br>Fuck off, retard</br>  <br>He's alpha. Wanting to fuck constantly and doing it when presented the opportunity at the drop of a hat, is a sign of a virgin.</br>  <br><br>Next episode looks like it's gonna be hijinks...<br><br>He said to watch out for ep 4, but it's probably another bait and switch episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you people understood that wrong. He said that by episode 4 you have the whole idea what kind of show this is, as it's more slow-paced and we still aren't entirely clear what Nagisa is about to do.</br>  <br><br>Yes, end-game pairing are Iris x Mizuki and Sensei x Nagisa</br></br>  The best transfer student  <br><br>Guess that's when Nagisa lays out his goals then</br></br>  <br> his goals then <br>Become CEO<br>Destroy brother<br>Get some student pussy</br></br></br></br>  DISREGARD BITCHES<br><br>ACQUIRE INFLUENCE AND POWER</br></br>  At the same time I think it's good if the cast size is being cut half but then again I don't want some characters to leave. How can the smug boy leave his nerd bro behind, at least keep him.  <br>Whit dat ass nobody notized the scars on his back.</br>  <br>But anon, I too would prefer to work on a functioning spaceship than wasting my time with a girl like that.<br>It's much more thrilling and satisfactory.</br></br>  Not you too.  So, is the CEO secretly embezzling funds for some shadow project? <br><br>I hope it's not going to be that the Kirishina company is somehow trying to create weapons or new types of military craft because that is more profitable, or even fund a private army of mercenaries to take over stuff. That would be too cliché.</br></br>  <br>Asumin leaving, THAT really broke my heart. Though now that they have Angelina I guess she's become actually superfluous. If only they had listened to her all along, they could've prevented this.</br>  <br>I think the brother is incompetent and the company is going down the drain.</br>  <br> posting Korrashit <br><br>Now you have me convinced you yurifags are just trying to stirr shit up. That is, if you even are the real thing and not just some bunch of falseflagging shitposters who are still riding high after your success of killing countless Hibikek threads.</br></br></br>  STOP BULLYING  <br> yurifags <br>You realize that's an anti-yuri poster?<br><br>The yuri in this show is overt. Go watch it.<br><br>Also I don't remember a single time I've seen "yurifags" ruining a thread, but I've seen countless times people were complaining about "yurifags" supposedly shitting up threads, and actually shitting up the thread in the progress.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But they're selling laser-guided vehicles and are some sort of huge insurance company now. <br><br>By having made the A-TEC R/D department irrelevant, surely the company wouldn't have any financial problems anymore. <br><br>Unless the big brother CEO did some really terrible investments.</br></br></br></br></br>  You guys seriously have nothing better to discuss than the potential yuri or lack of thereof between a background character and the MC's sister? Really?  <br> The yuri in this show is overt. <br> This is what yurishitters actually believe <br><br>Here we go again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first time witnessing shitposting on /a/? Forcing straigh vs yuri wars has become the method du jour for that.</br>  <br>Thank you based Christ. I got about three minutes into this episode before realising I needed to start 120Sing it.<br>Returned for dat ass, though.</br></br>  Just finished ep 3. First episode was ok, second was meh but this one was actually good, just need a little more of this and we are good to go.  <br>Shame it's starting out so slow and takes some sweet time for getting into gear. That's a risky road to take for an anime original show, since a substantial portion of the brain dead general audience suffering from ADHD will have dropped it by the second episode. Just look at our very own threads.</br>  For what purpose?  <br>Yes I have, what is Subaru going to do from now on, will he ever come back, will he ever be smug again.</br>  <br>yuri doesn't sell, it's conventional wisdom<br>gotta bait those fujo bux if you want to turn a profit<br><br>kiryuu is a true business hero, saving a-tec and disc sales at the same time</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I'm saying. Despite the company he's still managing to fuck it up, and due to the brother complex, he don't want to be seen as inferior to his little brother. So he's thrown him at all the toughest problems and given him impossible jobs, but he's still managed to save every company he worked for and give them V shaped results. <br>Now the older brother is getting even more angry and has thrown him at the A-TEC department, hoping he won't be able to save it.</br></br>  <br>There's lot of man ass this season. Kobayashi's little boy butt in Chinpo Kitan, shower scene in Prison School and now this.</br>  What's wrong with alpha-females?  <br>Only faggots let themselves be pushed around by women.</br>  <br> Angist in the shower <br> Sensei red face shows up <br><br>I thought he was going to fap to sensei.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuri people are wearing their goggles tighter each season, anon.<br><br>Soon they'll claim that BL-shows are yuri.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I mean, why did she got mad when she was called alpha?</br>  I love the faces, it was especially good with Igarashi's SB this episode. Also that Iris.  So did DDY drop this show or what?<br>they had the only good release of the first episode.</br>  <br> yuri doesn't sell, it's conventional wisdom <br> episode 8 Euphonium skyrocketed preorders </br></br>  <br>I think they're aware the material might be a bit boring for some, so they add in some fanservice to keep people interested until something exciting happens.</br>  <br>nobody watches this shit</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be easier for the big brother CEO to simply promote his little brother into a position where he'd have absolutely no influence? Also, there would still be that problem with the funds for A-TEC that aren't being reported to the rest of finance and administration. They do say that the money has to go somewhere. Would the big brother CEO really use it to pay some huge debts that were caused by his own incompetence?</br>  <br>Igarashi and his sunsets</br>  <br>And since when that stop they keep making yuri?<br>Probably is a sucess but you are ignoring other things</br></br>  <br> episode 8 Euphonium skyrocketed preorders <br> and yet the show as a whole barely sold somewhat decently <br><br>your revered hibikek was no smash hit, anon</br></br></br></br>    <br>you are cancer<br>kill yourself</br></br>  This show is really bad. I think it's only going to get worse. The only shows this season less deserving of threads are like:<br><br>- Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan<br>- Dandelion<br>- Shimoneta</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's professional baiting.</br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>i am the quimioterapy</br>  <br>Japan likes their women to be subservient Yamato Nadeshikos. Therefore instead of calling her "alpha woman" she might as well have called her an unlovable hairy bull dyke.</br>  <br> Kuusen <br><br>The only one you got right.</br></br></br>  <br>Engineer Flamenco just wanted to dream</br>  <br>You're probably just some random shitposter who's into roleplaying. In a way, it's even worse than tripfagging. So yes, you should definitely kill yourself.</br>  What is this show even trying to do?<br><br>They marketed it with the two girls, but they don't do anything and Kaito and Nagasa are for all intents and purposes the protagonists. Then they yuribait in the ED while having the actual show focus only on Kaito and Nagisa, complete with gratuitous man-ass of Nagisa. Commit to one thing and stop trying to pander to everyone, holy shit.</br></br>  <br>Either you're retarded, or you're commenting despite not having watched the show yet, which I guess also makes you retarded.</br>  This show needs more of the shota.  <br>But he left  ;_; </br>  <br>He and the IT guy are the best characters.</br>  <br><br>That's why</br></br>    <br>This director's last work ignored the cutest smug shota most of the time after episode 1, I don't trust him anymore.</br>  <br>FFF is doing it, though I have no idea how their release is.</br>  I'm not picking this up until the ending is confirmed to not be edgy drama relationship garbage like WA2.  <br>At the very least they're better than Crunchyroll</br>   Claris ED <br><br><br>I thought they had split up?</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't much better than CR, which they were likely editing from. They did typesetting and fixed some of the more blatant errors, but name orders were still getting switched around.</br>  <br><br>WA2 was an exception, the last anime he worked on was very fun to watch.</br></br>  <br>One of them left the group, remaining one brought in another friend.</br>  D-did they fuck?  <br>Saekano was also edgy relationship garbage with that bully tsundere.</br>  <br>Apparently not. She did intend to, he on the other hand just baited her by allowing her to use the bath.</br>  <br><br>I see. Still sounds more or less like before to me. Not that I mind.</br></br>  <br><br>That was only one scene in episode 9 and it ended with the tsundere getting BTFO</br></br>  <br>He's gay.</br>  <br> shower scene immediately cutting to this face <br>No wonder</br></br>  <br>Please, even if he was gay he wouldn't have such low standards.</br>  <br> hot teacher <br> low standards <br>pl--<br>oh, you mean teacher about Nagisa. Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Nagisa is rich, ambitious, powerful and good-looking.</br>  <br>He's scarred to hell and back, probably ass raped used goods.</br>  <br>Ahhhh, corporate politics and embezzling fraud. I love this so much it hurts.</br>  <br>But Sensei is hardworking, cute and kind<br>Please don't bully</br></br>  I wanted to drop this show, but god damn that cast. It even has Chiyo-chan. I can't do it.  <br>I like him, that's why I bully him</br>  <br> Yuu Kobayashi <br>Thought that was her voicing Angelina<br><br><br>Didn't he call her Hattori-kun before going to the shower?</br></br></br></br></br>  I watch this for her.<br><br> Yes, my autism is at such level. </br></br>  2cute4me  <br><br>Only reason to watch this show. I want to see more of her racing.</br></br>  Nagato a cute   Subaru quit <br> PR qt quit <br>Will they come back, /a/?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Of course. Theres going to be that generic scene where the characters that didn't leave are all working towards some goal which has time constraints and then all the characters who left start showing up one by one saying stuff like "Heh looks like you can use a hand." and all that.</br></br></br>  This is bullying.  <br>Nothing wrong with that. Those sensei and those kids were running things like lockheed martin.</br>  <br>Literally the only reason I'm still watching  but to be honest I'm still kind of interested in all the business drama. </br>  <br> probably ass raped used goods. <br>This, you don't go from illegitimate child from rich soon-to-be-CEO without pleasing few old-men for money.</br></br>  He wants A-TEC to succeed ultimately?  <br>Seriously, she was the best.</br>  <br>Probably. Even if it's just to spite his older brother. Of course, officially, he will comply with his orders and do whatever is necessary to downsize A-TEC, but in a way so that it actually still retains enough efficiency and really forces the staff to be extremely creative, searching for new ways to be cost-effective, environment-friendly, cheap, and yet good.</br>  Who Subaru here?  I really like the ED song. Full version when?  Nagisa wants to fuck Kaito right?  <br>They actually the spoiled kids, they really should known that money is serious problem.</br>  <br>Yes. Chief said Nagisa needs him sexually.</br>  another show that could have been great with maybe half the characters. I feel like the other half is just there because they had some anime cliche quota to fill.  <br>Ehh. R and D should be the last place you cut money if you're a megacorp. Google pisses away billions on its new hires, and they do so because one good innovation can literally change or even create an entire industry.</br>  <br>Well you're in luck because half the cast just left forever this episode</br>  <br>Yeah, he's the tough love boss.<br><br>...AKA totally fucking boring, give more screentime to Iris</br></br></br>  <br>Is it really R&amp;D if it's a group of sixteen-year-olds pissing away their money with nothing but a busted rocket to show for it?</br>  <br>Yup. Have you seen the first few Space X launches? The early days of Nasa? Shit's on fire, yo.</br>  <br>Was Space X created by sixteen-year-olds?</br>  <br> Chinpo Kitan <br><br>How have I not heard that before? Also, what the fuck is up with all these shitters watching this show and complaining about it not being haremshit?</br></br></br>  <br>What about F-35-chan?<br>What's the excuse?</br></br>  So will sensei plow the delicious Christmas cake?  All auditors as scary as Angelina?  <br>This show is about business. Like all this shit is about business. Next thing you know, they're going to be doing six sigma or some shit as well as have someone do the quality and process management.</br>  So, do they expect us to be on the side of A-TEC? So far, I'm feeling Nagisa has the better side.  The A-TEC students and Kaito are spoiled as fuck. That much money wasted on a rocket that ultimately got destroyed, and they request even more? Angelina was 100% correct with everything she said to them. All that money with no innovation. Terrible. And they wonder why they're downsizing.  <br>That seems to be why most of them left after the huge budget/facility cut.<br>Being used to being pampered with all that nice shit and to fool around in because of how special they are.</br></br>  <br> MC </br>  is this the worst thing maruto has written?  <br><br>Yes. How did he go from writing masterpieces to writing this?</br></br>   generic fanservice harem romcom <br> /a/ hates it, demands that studios drop the cheesy romance in favor of plot and subtle characterization <br><br> office drama with heavy dialogue and no apparent romantic arc <br> /a/ hates it, wonders why nobody is having sex </br></br></br></br>  Who exactly is this show pandering to? There aren't really moeblobs, not a lot of action, and I wouldn't say any of the characters are self-insert worthy.  <br> Engineers </br>  <br> Who exactly is this show pandering to? <br><br>Me.</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>As engineer I feel cringeworthy having some fucking office rat take away all their tools and equipment.<br>What are they expecting them to make? Hammers?</br></br></br></br>  <br>As an engineer, I cringe at the vague way they talk about the technology.</br>  <br>Because its a fucking anime. They can't talk about technology in detail, because authors themselves have no fucking idea.</br>  <br> because authors themselves have no fucking idea. <br><br>and even when they do it's not like the audience does so they'd have to dumb it down anyways</br></br></br>  <br>Tough love boss &gt; rei clones</br>  <br>I enjoy it, guess that means it's for me.</br>  <br>You and me brother.</br>  <br>Well at least it didn't panders to those harem or romcom. So it's okay in my book.</br>  <br>Will take in your ass.<br>Does not begin to soil the anime like you did in Hibike.<br>If you're going to start with yuribait of shit, go Bostar their delusions and hallucinations in / u /.<br>your trash miserable</br></br></br></br>  Who is this shit mc anime?<br>I still do not know who is the MC?<br>anime rotten</br></br>  <br><br>Go back to animesuki you stupid fuck</br></br>  <br>it's going to be<br><br>sensei x angelina<br>sensei imouto x nagisa<br><br>rei clone will be nagisa's half sister.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they will end up being siblings to match up with Kaito and Mizuki.</br>  <br><br>2016 Hibiki Love Story</br></br>  <br>Shit's kinda dry. I wouldn't mind so much if there was some sort of greater intrigue going on in the background.</br>  Nagisa and Angelina make a hell of a team. Oh wow. I very much look forward to seeing how A-TEC gets through this.  <br>It was quite clear the previous episode.</br>  <br><br>Will take in the ass.<br>There is no yuri this show is so delusions and hallucinations yurifag.<br>You have mints diseases, Hibike wires were all aruinados for you guys desgraçaos yurifags.<br>Forcing your tastes disgusting other users.<br>Va post your shit on / u /<br>I read the wire Hibike, you disgusting yurifag destroyed the anime<br>Do not destroy this anime as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I very much look forward to seeing how A-TEC gets through this. <br>They don't.<br>The focus on A-TEC is just a ruse. The real focus is on Nagisa vs. his brother. A-TEC people are just side characters.</br></br></br>  <br> actually shitting up the thread in the progress. <br>It's both. Them and the stupid yurifags.<br><br><br>On a separate note, I can never take Angelina's seiyuu seriously when she's trying to be serious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nagisa wants to help them though.</br>  Is it improving? Should I pick it back up?  <br>Yes, that is quite obvious.</br>  <br>nah, it sucks, and goodbye</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128242547 <br> 10k sales <br> failure </br></br>   R&amp;D guy gone <br>I'm not an engineer, but isn't this a huge blow?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128242547 <br> fem/a/nons <br>You poor, desperate fools.</br></br>  <br>Yeah.<br>I'm expecting some stupid asspull to make A-TEC relevant.</br></br>  Nagisa did nothing wrong.  <br>And his brother is up to something quite wrong for sure.<br>I await to see how based Nagisa busts him and ruins him.</br></br>  <br>He didn't fuck Angelina</br>  What is this anime actually about? The first three episodes all seem like they should be from different shows; their tone and direction all seem wildly opposed to eachother.  <br>Giving thirsty hoes what they want when they demand it is how you stay beta, pleb.</br>  <br>Serious question: are you retarded?</br>  <br>You gonna answer the question?</br>  <br>Are you intoxicated?<br>High as the int'l space station?</br></br>  <br>I'll take that as a yes.</br>  <br>Don't do drugs anymore, son.</br>  <br>He's underage and she's an old lady.</br>  <br>and?</br>  <br>Well his brother already tried to get him killed</br>  <br>I don't get why you people like her, I find everything except her interesting about this show. Boring quiet girls suck, bring back Subaru or PR girl in her place.</br>  <br>I mean, whatever he's cutting budgets for.</br>  <br> if a girl doesn't have super exaggerated emotions she's boring </br>  <br> her </br>  If they're bleeding so much money, then why don't they get involved in projects than can bring them so much money in the first place?  <br>because of traditions faggotry</br>  <br><br>They don't want to do stuff they don't like.</br></br>  <br> They don't want to do stuff they don't like. <br><br>this is the problem with the "Artistic freedom" mindset. Everyone has to do shit they don't like, you're not exempt</br></br></br>   Combustion Tester <br> Designer <br> Accounting/Administration <br> Materials Engineer <br> PR/Promotion <br><br>All a bunch of faggots who left. At least best girl is still here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Won't the others have to take up the slack?</br>  Isn't Hattori a boy's name? Did Angelina have some surgery?  I remember being very disappointed with episode 1 of this show, thinking that it was going to be the same old highschool kids and their wacky hijinks. I am actually really liking the direction episode 3 took, and I hope it will stay along that route.  <br>Wasn't Maruto saying something about episode 4 is where things start really picking up?</br>  <br>Well, that would make sense because of all the shit that happened in this episode. It all depends on how good their comeback from now on is.</br>  I was hoping this will be a show about space travel and life in a Martian colony<br><br>But this is just an anime about Japanese corporate culture</br></br>  <br>Salarymen who hate their bosses</br>  <br>Along those lines. Episode 4 is when you should have a clear idea of what the show is about and where it's going.<br><br>Somewhere earlier in the thread, someone clarified it.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea. I never check source material or previews etc.<br><br>I used to but I'd rather just let myself be surprised nowadays</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, considering how the japs force some high school stuff into pretty much everything, I can perfectly understand why some people are fed up with it.<br>Especially whne it has absolutely no place in a show (not really the case here).</br></br>  <br>Yes, literally.</br>  <br>Well, if somethings BL, it certainly makes yuri-sides (perceived or confirmed) somewhat less unlikely if there are female side characters. But this show is neither, there is just Fuji and /u/ bait.</br>  <br>I think it panders to people that work and know the value of money. I don't hate my boss but it did irk me when the characters would just go on about 'we need this and that' and simply demanded it as if they were entitled. <br><br>It's a good thing that the show is about them coming down from cloud 9, having been born and growing up there, and working their way back up.</br></br></br>  Why does barely anyone ever consider gravity on Mars?<br>Those guys should be either over 2 meter or walk very long low-gravity steps or both.<br>Honestly, that it's on Mars is so secondary, the setting might as well be a Bishop Ring or some other gigantic habitat.</br></br>  <br>Maybe they wear gravity shoes</br>  <br>Most science fiction is basically "normal stuff, but in space!" anyway. However, most also pay attention to some special technological/social situations. This show, so far, doesn't (which isn't bad per se, Cowboy Bepob and LotGH are the same here, but they would lose a lot of charme without the space setting).</br>  <br> fuji  <br>Fujo<br><br>Sounds impractical.</br></br></br></br>  My fucking god. Angelina and Nagisa are making it real hard for me not to drop this.<br><br>I'm going to severely disappointed once the inevitable 'happy end they don't get decommissioned' but holy shit it feels fucking glorious to see the cast get their shit pushed in hard.</br></br>  <br>Probably helps with lifting but they don't show it? Artificial gravity adding to Mars' gravity to create a comfortable 1G environment?<br>Or at worst, it's a forgotten detail.<br><br><br> going to severely disappointed <br> Yes, my autism is triggered. <br> I think I should go to sleep already, I'm tired. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it feels fucking glorious to see the cast get their shit pushed in hard <br><br>THIS</br></br></br>  <br>I like the idea of "Normal stuff, but with sci-fi tropes!", but this barely feels like it.<br><br>This might as well be taking place on Earth. The enviornment looks just like earth (which can be explained to be on purpose, but we still need to hear the explanation). Gravity is the same, length of days are the same. Had I not seen the start of the first episode, I would assume this just takes place in futuristic Akihabara or whatever.<br><br>Even the other interesting concept, of privatized cities owned by companies, is hardly explored</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's her family name, dumdum.</br>  <br>Mars days are 24 hours and 39 minutes.</br>  <br>That would probably still require a special time system, but fair enough, we can ignore it.<br><br>Still doesn't answer everything else.</br></br></br>  Am I fucking supposed to feel bad for them?<br>Because all I'm feeling now is absolute bliss knowing that those spoiled little fucks have finally gotten a well-deserved taste of their misgivings. <br><br>Almost eight god damn years in a shit office job having to deal with red tape, bureaucratic bullshit, and a more than corrupt executive management is making me appreciate every other character aside from the class and teacher far more than I should be.</br></br></br>   Non engineers say BE CREATIVE THAT'S ALL IT TAKES! <br><br>Yeah no fuck you guys. You can't shove people in a corner and tell them to think their way out of it when you don't know an engine from your dick.</br></br>  <br> I had to put up with shit so fictional characters in a far more complex field than I could even imagine have to as well </br>  <br>Are you saying you can't simply unlock the power of friendship to help you after strengthening your bonds with coworkers?</br>  I came in for the girls but now the guys have my attention. What the fuck?  <br>So this is "Idea Guys" vs Engineers, the anime?</br>  <br>Well Nagisa is carrying the plot</br>  All I can say for now is it is going to be a business-wars type  <br><br>he's doing nothing more than making snide remarks and foreshadowing, he may have a plan but he's a right cunt</br></br>  How would you feel about a boss like this?  <br>Indifferent. If we do our job properly and don't make stupid decisions then he won't lash out.</br>  <br><br><br>well We're also assuming he's not out to get us like he is A-tec</br></br></br>  <br>what you say is true, but in ep3 where the teacher asks for parts with the cost and nagisa exploding on him telling him that that isn't sufficient paperwork to warrant him to accept his request, shows the level of competence these people are at.<br><br>I understand that the executives of companies and accountants etc don't understand fully the complexity of engineering but then it goes both ways too. The students+teacher had to understand that money doesn't just simply grow in a garden and you have to earn it. It's a compromise or take a hike situation, and growing from this is the direction that I hope this anime will kind of go to. Undoubtedly there's the drama between the two brothers that will take precedence though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd be wholly satisfied by a boss with a work ethic like his. Of course, barring whatever power struggle he's doing in the sidelines.</br></br>  <br><br>well for whatever reason the higher ups are suddenly out to get A-tech. We don't know the reason yet but this extremely sudden shift is a bit much,<br><br>You can't pull the rug out from under your employees like this and say "HUR DUR USE YOUR HEAD" you have to give them something instead of setting them up to fail harder <br><br>right now they're just throwing shit at them till they quit on their own, which happened with a number of students and that's a right dick move</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they've already thrown science out the window with this one. I mean fuck, all the spaceships fly like airplanes. And in the first episode they just accelerate straight into a space station and crash land like a plane! They don't even do a counter burn. Couldn't they have at least played KSP for like 5 minutes before making this shit?<br><br>I mean fuck, if they want to pander to engineers they need to get their science together<br><br><br> &gt;Artificial gravity adding to Mars' gravity to create a comfortable 1G environment? <br>if you can manipulate gravity, then you don't need whatever engine they're supposed to be developing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty good, I had similar one and there was no problem with pay, vacations, breaks or anything. <br>Then he changed the place and was replaced with more irresponsible boss who didn't have enough authority to keep the shit together, which lead to the slackers not doing their job properly. That only leads to bad atmosphere and you're surrounded by Tarous who can make your job a lot harder because the boss doesn't care.</br></br>  <br>Feels pretty good.</br>  <br>Capitalist master race</br>  <br>Because he went for a drink and a whine once he is now a useless alcoholic?</br>  <br>True, and which was hinted that its the older brother embezzling the funds for unknown reasons.<br><br>It's a fact A-tech's budget has been cut, and nobody can do anything about it. Although it is also a fact that Nagisa and Angelina are giving the class tough love but both of them don't want A-tech to fail. So yeah, the higher ups are dicks for sure, but I suppose I find the plot convenience of - the class left to their own tools and make the best of it due unbeknownst to them that corruption from the top, on the facade of budget cuts and how someone is out to expose the truth while at the same time covertly helping the class 'grow' as a team - interesting. Hey shit this might not even be the plot at all, but in my head its something like that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's interesting, the heroes need adversity to overcome of course. I just don't see how people can take the "business" side when previously spoiled or not they're being dicked with pretty hard. It's not like they really flaunted or where assholes either. Hell the one thing we see them do is risk their own necks to save someone who ended up being a cock</br></br>  <br>...best of it unbeknownst to them that its*<br><br>I should stop posting now.</br></br></br>  <br>There's also the mystery of where the money goes, it clearly has something to do with Nagisa's brother.</br>  <br>Then fuck them. We'll see who's the real "master race" when every last capitalist is hanging from a bridge.</br>  <br>I personally find it hard to like with the so-called 'heroes' though. In fact, I absolutely loathe Sensei's character.</br>  <br><br>safe money is one secret weapons project.<br><br>I don't want to say Metal Gear buuuuuuuuuut</br></br></br></br>  <br> I absolutely loathe Sensei's character. <br><br>Why? Because he's excited about his job and wants to build his dream? Wow, What a bastard. How dare he give a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is that? I think Sensei has a lot of good points in his passion and drive as well as a lot of room for growth and to get himself together</br>  <br><br>Like I said, it's a personal reason. I'm not in a shitposty enough mood to blog and rant about it right now so just write it off as a disgruntled anon's shitty opinion.</br></br>  <br>Seconded.<br><br>I think the same can be said for the students that decided to stay. While I may not fully be able to grasp the situation the class is in I find it hard to believe that their situation was 'over'. Dire, but it ain't over surely. I like to think it was some convenient screening process from Nagisa and Angelina that, on top of fulfilling the quota of budget cuts, also weeded out the weak willed so that the ones who stay really deserve to be there.</br></br></br>  <br><br>see if you're not gonna bother to explain than Im just gonna assume you a cunt because from what we've seen you're hating on pretty decent people for no reason beyond having a bug up your but</br></br>  <br><br>you don't find out who's worthy by antagonizing your help. That's asinine. You don't find the best people that you that's how you find who can put up with the most garbage. The fact that they're even in that school is already proof of their talent, the kids who left will have new jobs by the end of the day.</br></br>  <br> the kids who left will have new jobs by the end of the day <br>Not even that long, even as they walked out they said they already had other job offers they were walking in to.</br></br>  <br>Except combustion tester who was constantly worried where he can go now</br>  <br><br>yeah but I figured a few of them may stop for lunch first, probably take the rest of the day off. you don't want to go into a job interview pissed</br></br>  <br>I did mention tough love, I don't think that's the same as antagonizing but ymmv.<br><br>Also, pretty sure their class is special even by the academy's standard.<br><br>As for the kids that will have new jobs, I can loosely connect it to my statement of people that deserve to be there, may also want to be there. Theoretically speaking if another company offered better accommodations than A-tech without budget cuts would they have left anyway? This part though is just my own subjective perception though</br></br></br></br></br>  B is incest, C is yshit.<br><br>Pattern A is the answer. You know it's true.</br></br>  <br>Do really people care about shipping in this show<br>If there was some romance to come I'd like it to be between Kaito and Angelina because they're same age and Angelina can whip him to proper shape.</br></br>  <br> mfw sensei and nagisa have the same haircut </br>  <br>Nagisa has no choice over the matter that A-tech's budget has been reduced to 1/3. I don't think he's antagonizing them on purpose.</br>  <br> Theoretically speaking if another company offered better accommodations than A-tech without budget cuts would they have left anyway? <br><br>You don't test loyality by treating your employees like shit. You can rationalize it all you want but if a company isn't going to be loyal to the employees why should the employees stay loyal.<br><br>Of course they're gonna leave you rube. They went from the top to literally kicked out of the building in a day. That's not tough love that's outright disloyalty</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>C is the only one with any good chemistry and contact record so far. So by Occam's Razor, C is likelier until we see more chemistry between the males and females.</br>  <br>This show won't have any romance, you ape. Maruto personally apologized on the official twitter that romance is out the window, because for once in his miserable work life of pleasing the otaku crowd, he wanted to do something different than all the fapgames he's done before. This is gonna be pure corporate drama, so shippershits should of all stripes should fuck right off.</br>  You will never eat Anime-chan's stroganoff.

He does some crazy shit in zero and heaven's feel, what happened to that?  <br>He got "surprised" in the Fate route.<br><br>Chalk it down to either bad writing in Fate, or bad writing in HF that he suddenly became a ninja.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou: I want to save everybody!<br>Archer: That is a logical contradiction and a denial of the self. Besides, you can't do it. <br>*people dies*<br>Shirou: FUCK<br>Archer: Understand what I mean now kid? You are powerless and you cannot save your ideal. The only Emiya Shirou can do now is to coldly eliminate the source in order to lessen the damage. <br>Shirou: NO!! I won't do that, I won't sacrifice one to save to save others, that is not something I can do. <br>Archer: The fuck?? This is not me, not sure if you are worth killing anymore. <br><br>Shirou: WAAAAHHH!! BAAAWW!! I don't know what to do!! I can't sacrifice people. And I love Sakura, I just never thought love had a place in my life, perhaps it does. BAAAWW. <br>Shit! I am not sure if I can love so can I really love her? I am I allowed to? I can't save anyone! I cannot sacrifice someone! Can I save her? Am I allowed to? I cannot sacrifice anyone! <br>Iliya: Why are you crying Shirou? I will be your ally no matter what, It's natural to protect those you love. You cannot give up on those you love Shirou! <br>Shirou: Waahh, this was never a question to begin with! I cannot sacrifice anyone! I... cannot save everyone! But I must save her! <br>Iliya: I am your ally because this is the kind of person you are. <br><br>Shirou: Shut up Kotomine, I am not my father! Rin you can be quiet I won't let anyone die! <br>Rin: But she has to die (the situation as it is now must end) <br>Shirou: No one shall die! <br><br>*Sakura escapes*<br>Shirou: I found you! I won't let you down, never gonna give you up, or hurt you. No one shall die! <br>Sakura: Are you allowed to love me? Am I allowed to love you?<br>Shirou: It's natural to protect those you love. You cannot give up on those you love Sakura.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you shitting me? Because it sounds like you're shitting me.<br><br>Lancer isn't developed at all. Gilgamesh gets the fucking jobbing of his life. We trade the FUCKING AWESOME Assassin for this True Assassin bullshit that gets tossed around by Rider. Archer gets no real attention at all either. SABER GOT SHAFTED.<br><br>Sakura has a personality, sure: Fucking jealous slut. Not moe at all, and I never once felt an ounce of pity for that pot of meat and worms.<br><br>Shirou seems human? What the hell are you talking about, he seems like a goddamn chicken. The moment that weighed his whole goddamn life and his promise to the man who saved his life and he gives it all up for that writhing mass of jealousy, hate, and smuttiness. Not to mention he lacks the manly drive and conviction that brought me to goddamn tears, I fucking cried man, in the other routes. Holy shit, he went from hall of fucking heroes to goddamn fail for nothing of value.<br><br>Rin? You must be crazy. You must be fucking insane to think that some sisterly affection is somehow more awesome than her portrayal in UBW. You must be high out of your mind. Rin is good character, always, but I wish I could just inject pure UBW Rin into my goddamn eyes because she was so much better in that route. Tsundere? Fucking check. Allowing Shirou to be a fuckwin hero? Double Fucking Check. Beating the fucking hell out of Caster!? HOT DAMN.<br><br>In short, Heaven's Feel failed on multiple levels to keep up with the sheer fucking awesome of the previous two routes.<br><br>Also Sakura is the worst heroine by far, and HF Shirou is the biggest idiot I have ever seen in my life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just got done with the Heaven's Feel route, and I have to say, the whole VN is terrible. The h-scenes were out of place and weren't needed, it just felt like the writer added them in because he was bored fuckless. The same shit is repeated over and over, you just keep holding down the skip button until something interesting comes up. Why does Shinou constantly get wounded? The majority of the dialogue in the game is him moaning in pain and describing how much it hurts. Seriously, what the fuck.<br><br>You know what? I'm not even going to bother criticizing it. I don't even want to think about that crap anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Why was Rin more concerned about Sakura's HIV infections rather than losing her Servant, the key to her surviving the horrific war?</br>  <br>There's a level of bullshit there no matter what. In Fate, the best he does is throw grail vomit at Shirou. Like, Fate Shirou, the weakest Shirou, is able to take him down. Then UBW happens and he gets fucked up like a chump.<br><br>HF though actually has you learning about his character, and he becomes fleshed out. The thing is, in doing that, you learn he's actually strong as fuck, so that brings into question why he wasn't like this at any point in the other stories. I guess in UBW it's kind of okay because he didn't really fight anything in the first place.</br></br></br>  I love you to Saber.<br><br>Desktop dedicated to you.</br></br>  <br>I can't believe people can be this retarded.<br><br>Lancer, Saber, Gil, Archer are all developed in Fate and UBW. All routes in F/SN complement each other. That's why it's necessary to read Fate and UBW before HF.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because only Caster, Kojiro and Lancer died immediately, and the same argument is made over and over again falsely. Rider, Gil, Archer, Saber, Hassan, and Berserker lasted quite awhile. That is three out of 8.<br><br>Even with the battle with Lancer, it set up plot elements for later, like Kirei knowing Lancer would die and scouting out the secret of Zabiniya, which he used against Hassan later on. Caster dies pitifully in every route unfortunately, but hey, everyone gets the job effect in each route too.<br><br>The Shadow was the foregone conclusion of the cluster fuck the 5th war actually was. Sakura being an magic experiment run wild uncovered how the war was really a sham in the first place, and the battles a farce to begin with. How people could say it was out of left field means they didn't particularly pay attention to the story, and viewed it as a magical battle royale, when it's said over, and over, and over that it's a ritual. The Servants never meant much from the beginning except as soul energy. That was the point of the ritual. You can dislike it, but this was known for quite awhile by the time you read that route.<br><br>I said you didn't read it because thetr are many people I see who didn't, who tend to use those arguments as bait.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  windows </br>  <br>Kotomine is a useless fraud of a priest with no real purpose in any of the routes. Until you witness the off the scale AWESOME that is Heaven's Feel. Other than the rest of the great stuff in the greatest route, you'll finally get some character development with Kotomine, understand his thought process and motives, and also get to see him simply being GAR. I mean like SAVE THE LOLI GAR and fucking purging the unclean and shit. And then the final epic battle at the end of Heaven's Feel. Kotomine, a character who I thought was worthless and annoying in Fate and UBW, suddenly became great when I finally got to Heaven's Feel. Hell, everything was better in Heaven's Feel.</br>  <br>Eh, I like UBW more.</br>  <br>Holy shit! <br><br><br>No one ever told me that Heaven's Feel had awesome guro incest!</br></br></br></br>  <br>UBW does have incest. Shinji wins the Sakurabowl in it.</br>  <br>Stop being a neckbeard. I shouldn't have to repeat this. Seriously you aren't going to convince me of your opinion.</br>  <br>I swear if this is like that time when Mirror Moon delayed Heaven's Feel just so they could release it on Halloween.</br>  <br>UBW is for ten year old chuunis. Everything progresses from 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if...' with no regard as to what's plausible. Case in point: Servants vastly outclass humans. It shouldn't matter how fast Shirou can make swords, because he can't move his arms fast enough to block.<br><br>In Heaven's Feel, we have actual character development. Also, Mind of Steel ending.</br></br></br>    All of the faggots saying worm slut <br>You idiots realize Kotomine got rid of the fucking worms right?</br>  <br> Servants vastly outclass humans <br><br>Never was a huge problem in FSN. Rin kills Berserker once in Fate. Shirou takes on Berserker in HF. There's nothing wrong with Shirou going up against servants when there's a stated reason for him getting stronger. Also see pic related. Shirou's augmented by the weapons he creates.<br><br>And really, do you want to get into character development? Shirou gets a fine answer in UBW. You don't need to completely change who you are for development.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You idiots realize Kotomine finger banged the worm, right? <br><br>Grosss.</br></br></br>  <br>An erotical black hole, from which no plot or character can escape.</br>  <br>If you took out Kotomine and Shirou being awesome, the entire route would immediately die.<br><br>UBW is the better route.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So you ignored the parts about Sakura that weren't about jealousy, where she risked sanction and death to help Shirou? Because it seems like you did.<br><br>Like another anon said, Lancer barely gets any development in the VN period, and only a couple scenes at the end of UBW. People complain about Rider's development, but realtalk, Lancer is about as clichéd until Hollow as she seems to be. <br><br>What about Sakura and Rin's sibling relationship? Or Shirou and Ilya's? Or finding out the truth that you never find out in the other routes? HF is lore central. Unless the only thing you cared about was "ooh, pretty battles" than the route was a good for story development.<br><br>Also, Gil got melted to slag by the mud in the Fourth War and was only saved because he rolled a charisma check, getting a new body made from that same mud which is a key point for HF. He got sucked into the void at the end of UBW. <br><br>He lost in HF because it's the goddamn grail being cursed to shit and he fought the wrong thing, as well as his body being made by the same thing he was fighting, which is hooked into a girl with anti-spirit powers. Nothing in this universe is without its counter. It's like a zombie lord fighting a strong priest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Believing every single girl in your anime are virgins <br>Fucking beta-kun when are you going to get into your mind that Archer unlimited boned worked Rin and Saber probably got gangbanged by all of her knights.</br></br>  <br>im sorry saber but you lost me.</br>  <br>I don't know about you, but I don't like the idea of a high priest finger banging worms into her vaginal opening and womb</br>  <br><br>If I took out the main character and his development and don't compensate for that, the story suffers.<br><br>Well no shit Sherlock</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga, secondary.</br>  <br>  Can not even read Japanese and calls other secondaries <br><br>Well meme'd my friend, are you fitting in yet?</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck? Where did this shit come from? Don't post your opinion and not expect to get opinions back you fucking retard.</br>  <br> King of England <br> a tiny girl </br></br>  <br><br>You implied that Shirou and Kotomine carried the route, which is retarded. So I responded in kind to your equally dismissive manner of speaking.<br><br>If you are going to make a point like that, at least provide some sort of reasoning beyond your obvious bias, or get the fuck out. Christ.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i learned a bit of japanese, so now i'm qualified to be a part of their community.</br>  <br>Alright, and then I followed up by explaining. What the hell's your problem nigger?</br>  <br>Please don't use the R word we must call it mentally disabled.</br>  <br>Excuse me good sir, but in what language did you read the manga? English right? Also in what language did you play the VN, English again right?<br><br>So kindly fuck off and stop thinking you aren't a filthy secondary. Also define "a bit".</br></br></br>   The 700th debate over HF   <br> secondary <br>Opinion discarded.</br></br>   not thinking Heaven's Feel is the best route <br><br>It was the best by far. In Fate and UBW all Shirou did was fap to the thought of becoming like Kiritsugu. Heaven's Feel said FUCK THAT NOISE<br><br>Not to mention the rent was due for him with Sakura like 4 times :^)</br></br></br></br>  <br>I figure everyone is really tense because of the wait for the movies. <br>There are going to be alooot more "debates". Most of them ususally end in a imagedumb so i dont mind</br></br>  <br> Shirou did was fap to the thought of becoming like Kiritsugu <br>secondary detected</br></br>  <br>If you like fateshit, you're nothing more than a disgusting weeaboo cuck.</br>  <br><br> finger banged <br><br>Where did this idea that the worms are in her vagina when we know they are in between the muscles in her body? And running through her bloodstream? <br><br>I mean, even as a joke, it's not really that funny when you know the truth. I mean, I could understand the allure of black comedy from some people, but a girl being used as an experiment and thrown into pits of rotting flesh is kind of in bad taste to joke about.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> weeaboo cuck. <br/></br>  <br>Why did Gilgamesh turn into a retard in UBW and HF?</br>  <br>Shirou wanted to follow Kerry's ideal, not become Kerry himself.<br><br>ironically there is an ending in HF where he legitimately becomes a living personification of Kerry.</br></br></br>  Only a bunch of weeks until the KanColle event and the release of the Vita game.

Which imouto is best imouto?  <br>Ebola-chan</br>  <br>no deb8</br>  So i discovered this gem last week and i binged all chapters i could find.<br>Apparently, ch 135 raw's are out.<br>Anyone got an idea of when (how often) these are translated/set up?</br></br>  <br>Dang....you're right...<br><br>But until the main story lines surpasses Black Label we can at least get more Tachi...<br>Still though...shit man...I didn't think about that. Fuck, now does that mean the next 30 chapters are going to be simple "non plot developing lewdness fests with the tomboy cockblock"?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jitsu is behind but the translations started lates and have slowed a bit recently, still around 1 new chapter per week.</br>  Alright well thanks anons. I got a shit ton more manga to catch up, but I'm calling it a night.<br> man i wish i could read moonrunes </br>  <br><br><br>Random place for a Jitsu question.<br><br>We're behind because of a few reasons. For one thing, trying to release more than a chapter a week burns people out. Another reason is if we ever do catch up with the raws, we'd have to use magazine raws instead of tank raws. That makes the job of cleaning and redrawing that much harder.<br><br>We're going to keep being behind, sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's ok anon, as long as I get more Dumpire.</br></blockquote>]
