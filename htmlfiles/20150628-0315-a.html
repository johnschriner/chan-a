[ What does /a/ think of Black Lagoon.  /a/ hates everything.  Pretentious garbage for idiot normie faggots  It's a fun girls and guns anime with a decent MC and it brought us best maido.  Shit is on point, but fuck Tex-Mex.  Being black lagoon fan is suffering.  I think the sub is better.  Pretty good.<br><br>I want Balalaika to call me names and hit me while I fuck her.</br></br>  <br>Should of been a hentai OVA</br>  2edgy4u shit  New chapter never.  <br>It's great. Stick to the dub, tho.</br>  Would watch if it was about the trap.   muh westernized chinese cartoons   I liked it. It was silly, and had some fun, over the top characters. Balalaika best.<br><br><br> I also really liked Roberta's Blood Trail, but mostly because Rock went full evil genius </br></br></br>  Shits cool and it has the cutest girls.  <br>I think Hiroe should stop drawing porn.</br>  <br>Pls Hiroe, at least finish the current arc.</br>  introduced me to anime  <br>This. It's what I use to introduce folks. Very easy to get into.</br>  <br>New scans fucking when ? Hiroe said he had come back</br>  <br>Go away newfag.</br>  <br> that filename <br> implying other options <br>post it.</br></br></br>  Funny thing is that most anime I like is surreal, weird, artsy stuff and cyberpunk/sci-fi anime. I also never liked 80/90s action movies, even as a kid. But when I watched this I loved it, basically it made me realize that I have a think for girls that can kick ass.  <br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=list&amp;tags=sawyer_the_cleaner<wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I swear. There's so many anime that won't commit to having a girl kick ass and have her start jobbing at the last minute. I like that Black Lagoon is better at keeping the character's badassness consistant.</br>  <br>Good for its time.<br><br>Now it's just edgey.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>While Black Lagoon does have plenty of girls that kickass, Revy is my least favorite.<br><br>While all of them are super unrealistic, at least Sawyer/Shenhua/Roberta/Balalaika seem to have style or grace to what they're doing. Revy just walks up to solders armed with assault rifles with her two pistols and shoots them before they can get a shot off. <br><br>In this clip she literally doesn't move anything except her trigger finger.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/L3Lb_ElIeSI?t=1m37<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Also her constant bickering with Rock is unwatchable. Fuck him or leave him alone. Christ.<br><br>Still, her design is hot as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not as edgy as ur mums cunt ,m8</br>    dem legs  I still find myself very attracted to Jane even if she's probably one of the shittier people of Lagoon.      Worth a watch. but it could have been better character-wise.  <br>Those are some big guns.</br>  <br> 4u </br>  <br>Not really.<br>I mean, I guess the 92 is on the bigger side for a 9mm, and hers does have extended slides and barrels, but there are plenty of bigger guns.</br></br>  <br>The characters were the best part.<br>It could greatly have used a couple of OVA episodes where you see a bit of an ordinary day for some character, as well as a bit of their past.<br><br>The series is full of great interesting characters and I'm dying to know more about all of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jane reminding me why she's my favorite.</br>  <br>If you can hit your target, pretty much any gun will do the trick.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Revy is best girl <br> a mess is not attractive  <br> getting her to open up to you before passionately fucking her brains out is not the best <br> if it was revy you wouldn't tease her after so she roughly dominates you for round 2 <br><br>She has no mercy for her enemies<br>If the tables were turned they would probably rape and sell her off<br> no mercy in this dojo </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best magical girl ever</br>  <br>You got that right</br>  <br> Muh stopping power </br>  <br>One of the best action series out there.</br>  <br> 9mm </br>  <br>Ask /k/ about their take on the matter.</br>  <br>To a point.<br>Shot placement is king, but a bullet that can penetrate helps a lot.<br><br>You could kill people pretty good with a .22LR, but they aren't known for their reliability or penetration (well, priming is better in modern brands, but back in the day you were guaranteed a bunch of duds in each brick). If you want a small gun in a small caliber for the purpose of defense or killing, .32ACP is about the smallest I'd personally be comfortable with, unlike .25ACP or .22LR, it has penetration to speak of, and the low recoil helps with followup shots.<br><br><br><br>Reminder that 9x19mm Luger, .45ACP, .40S&amp;W, all perform about in the same ballpark in terms of effective terminal ballistics. Pick what you feel fits you.<br><br>Hell, a .380 with one of those modern Lehigh brand solid copper bullets with the X shaped tip can probably penetrate deeper than an FMJ .45</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im from /k/ It's all about shot placement to a certain extend of course</br>  <br>It sucks</br>  <br>i still haev to watch the last 2 episodes, but i feel like i can't force myself anymore, it's so stupid it hurts</br>  <br>Don't call your mother 'it'</br>    That's nice, nothing more.  <br>An adolescent's idea of a cool action show</br>  <br>The thing is, Revy is the most interesting by a long shot. She's proven to be hypocritical, doubts herself, having Rock in her world and having him confront her with his words made her have doubts about herself. Beside that she's also fun, I can never laugh when I see Roberta or Balalaika, they're just their to be serious and menacing. Revy is interesting, fun to wach and listen to and on top of that just as badass and hot as the rest. Most of the other girls are just gallery figures, she's an actual character.<br><br>Also, obviously the creators won't pay as much detail in each fight she's in as they will with the side characters who will fight ten times less than her and will usually take part in the more important parts.</br></br></br>   BEHOLD LOTTON THE WIZARD   It's a hell of a ride.  <br>He's so precious.</br>  <br>10/10 character.</br>    Revy best girl<br>Manga best version<br>Hiroe laziest mangaka</br></br>  <br>/a/ only hates whatever you like<br><br><br><br>Still come to /a/ in an attempt to get honest opinions?  It's good, really good, but the outcome of all the shoot outs are predictable, but hey, revy is best girl, next to scarface woman </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Benny you lucky motherfucker</br>     66 post <br> Retards doesn't put this image here <br><br>/a/ you sucks sometimes.</br></br></br>    <br>elaborate</br>   Black Lagoon <br> Hiatus forever <br><br>Black Lagoon gonna suffer the HxH syndrome</br></br></br>  <br>I just wanna see what happens in the plot.<br><br>And more of my waifu of course!</br></br></br>  <br>I just wanna know if Revvy and Rock are fucking or not.</br>  Shit when it tries to be serious and dramatic. Great when it's mostly lighthearted mercenary action comedy with a little bit of drama. The arc which introduced Shenhua and her cokehead driver was by far the best, in my opinion.  <br>I just wanna see Rock and Revy fug<br><br>They aren't.</br></br></br>  <br>Shenhua is by far one of my very favorites in the show (after my waifu of course), and Leigarch was a riot.<br><br>I don't mind when it tries to be serious, but it can definitely be heavy handed alright.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, the guy's an asshole. <br> you wann more brack ragoon? TOO BAD, HERE GAY PORN, FUK U </br></br></br></br>  <br>That arc was serious as well, it had some Rock-Levy tension if I don't misrecall, it had Rock being confronted by the Japanese terrorist/rebel about his motives and future, it had the sandnigger and the Jap arguing and ending with murder despite being bros. Plus great action and hilarious comedy.</br>  <br> -Levy <br>Come on, anon.<br><br>It's 2015.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Revy and Rock take the boat out to sea <br> fuck like animals for hours on end <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br>I get the feeling that the arc is kind of under-appreciated.</br>  The Black Lagoon Co. itself was cool, especially Balalaika and her former team, but most of the side characters were distractingly dumb.  <br>I have no excuse, other than that I've never made that mistake before.</br>  <br>He did a gay one?</br>  <br>I hope you're not talking about my plastic american fuck toy.</br>  <br>It's a bit short and doesn't really come to any conclusions, I guess. Pure fun all the way through though in my opinion, which is all I want from Black Lagoon.</br>  <br>liquid terminator arc made me shit myself with joy!</br>  /a/ thinks you should lurk more.  <br>The Danganronpa one got pretty gay. Really could have done without some of the pages in that one.</br>  <br>There is so much Terminator influence in Black Lagoon and I love it. IIRC, Revy is a mashup of Sarah Connor and George Clooney's character in From Dusk Till Dawn. <br><br>Hell, Dutch even wears the shades Sarah Connor wears in T2.</br></br></br>  <br>Hiroe swings all sorts of ways.<br><br><br>The Glock is Austrian, not American, also I would think twice about using a gun as a fucktoy, seems risky.<br>Also bodily fluids generally isn't healthy for metals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, i didnt even catch on the reference from Dutchy. Great Spot Anon!</br>  <br>agreed. this one was waaaay too rushed and i dont think there was a thing they could do about it.</br>  <br> Hell, a .380 with one of those modern Lehigh brand solid copper bullets with the X shaped tip can probably penetrate deeper than an FMJ .45 </br>  <br> trigger discipline <br><br>saved</br></br></br>  <br> it had Rock being confronted by the Japanese terrorist/rebel about his motives and future <br><br>That was one of the most important parts of Rock's character development. The terrorist realized that Rock is no idealist; that he's got very personal motives for his apparent do-gooding. <br><br>It's exactly what Fabiola comes to realize, and she calls Revy out for putting Rock on a pedestal because she thinks he's some sort of Good Guy, when he's a sonofabitch quite willing to roll the dice with other's lives to get his way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not deeper, but probably close.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Lcz<wbr>feWK9lHw</wbr>  [ ]<br>Seriously, this shit penetrates fantastically in tissue, to the point that when you load it in a .357 it penetrates too much to use against a human (though probably fantastic for bears).<br><br>I'd love to see them make this for .32ACP, .357SIG, 10x25mm, stuff like that.<br>Or fuck, imagine loading the .357 caliber bullet in a .357 Maximum cartridge?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will Hiroe ever get off his ass? When he writes, it's good, but he never fucking writes.  <br>Well, in a way perhaps, but it also wasn't any actual development, it was just an accurate look at Rock's character. He was like that from the beginning and remains that way still. So if anything it was more like foreshadowing future events, because it wasn't an important part of the arc's plot either. Or did it start Rock's habit of self-reflection? Been awhile since I read it, so I can't recall.</br>  <br>I would watch a show exclusively about Lotton.<br><br>He's a beautiful cinnamon roll and too pure for this earth.</br></br></br>  <br>There should be a small OVA series about these three.</br>   Maybe not deeper, but probably close. <br><br>Hardly: <br><br>http://rangehot.com/because-they-do<wbr>-not-make-a-46/#lightbox/7/<br><br> Speer FMJ: 32+  <br><br>In other words, they had 32 inches of ballistic gel and it blew clean through all of it without stopping. With that said though, that's about twice the penetration you'd actually want for dynamic social encounters; the gel tests you linked there prove that the Lehigh bullet there is fantastic for that job; 16-19 meets the 12'' minimum and then some (which is exactly what you want because you'll likely have to shoot through a barrier; even if it's the arm extending a gun at you.) <br><br>I've been eyeballing some .380s lately; I guess I know what I'll be loading in whatever I buy~</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be great.<br><br>One of my favorite parts about that arc was seeing those three living together and Lotton and Sawyer playing vidya. Warmed my heart.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm really excited that .380ACP is having such a resurgence these days, as people are figuring out the best ways to make that kind of gun and how to best load it's ammunition.<br><br>Older carry pieces are now more viable again thanks to new ammunition types, and new designs for pistols are really giving a lot of options.<br><br>For instance the Browning .380 1911, here you have a weapon that if it had been regular blowback, would have been difficult for many old and frail people to operate due to things like arthritis, but the Browning here is locked-breech and is super easy to rack, while offering the decent firepower of the .380, now couple that with these copper wonders and even a weak person has a weapon to be reckoned with.<br><br>You hear so many stories of old people having to resign themselves to .22 pistols or cheap piece of shit .38 revolvers, because they don't have the hand strength and ability to handle anything better anymore, but now there are alternatives for them that measure up!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Definitely one of the best anime I've seen</br>     that moment in Season. 2 when   the girl kills her self and Revy screams at Rock, "Don't look at her! Look at me!"  <br><br>I came for guns and hot girls but I got feels</br></br>  <br>My favorite arc of the show, personally.That moment and the part in RBT when Revy has her flashback. The sobbing and defeated "fuck you" she says to the cop are pretty rough.</br>  <br> I fuck her <br><br>You're doing it wrong.</br></br></br>  <br> There will never be a season 3 <br><br>This show is on my all time top 10. It's a shame they won't make another season. I also wish that the author would write some more fucking material as well.</br></br></br>  <br>OTP right there.</br>  <br>my sadness that this will not only never get updated, but also never get that third anime season, goes all the way to the bone. <br>As far as media goes it has a place up there with Robert Jordan dying before he could finish the Wheel of Time. Can only sigh and dream what if.<br> inb4 Brandon Sanderson, he did ok, it still wasn't the same. </br></br></br>  <br>Minimaid a best.</br>  <br>I loved Black Lagoon so much, it made me buy a fucking Beretta 92FS. That said, pretty good gun.</br>  <br>That probably is one of the most arousing and yet scary shit at the same time.</br>  <br>Id like to Black Revy's Lagoon</br>   this show still hasn't had a continuation after the last chapter <br>The fuck? Just how much money has that guy made that he's stopped making the manga?</br>  <br>jane is a slut</br>  <br>I don't think they are currently but it's implied that they did while they were in Japan.</br>  <br>I don't buy it</br>  <br>Well, you don't have to, it's never explicitly stated.</br>  <br>Your point? Getting all grossed out by a loose woman from Roanapur is silly. Everyone has a vice, and everyone is a scumbag. If Jane's vice is she wants to fuck like a jackrabbit I'm not gonna fault her.</br>  <br>where exactly is that implication?</br>  <br>She's also unrealistic because Indian women aren't hot</br>  <br>He's right, you know.<br><br>I don't care how racist this sounds, but I've never encountered any racial group as uniformly hideous and foul-smelling as Indians.<br><br>Like, it's incredible how fucking bad they smell.<br><br>How can they possibly smell that bad?<br><br>EVERY.<br><br>SINGLE.<br><br>FUCKING.<br><br>ONE.<br><br>And there are so goddamn many of them. Fuckers have never heard of birth control and they hate women. Can you imagine living in that country? How bad it would smell? It would be like living in a sauna where the only thing stronger than the heat is the smell of shit.<br><br>Fuck India.<br><br>Take a fucking bath.<br><br>Buy some fucking condoms.<br><br>Make hygeine and planned parenthood a major cultural priority. If they cared half as much about that as they do about tech support, maybe that country wouldn't be an abomination.<br><br>Oh, and the food is disgusting. Spicy, flavorful food can be great. Thai food is great. Indian food is the fucking fruitcake of world cuisine. It's like they shoved everything into the food that they possibly could including all the money that could go to education and the boxes of condoms that they never fucking utilize, soaked it all in kerosene, and called it "food."<br><br>I'd say that I wish India would get swallowed up by the ocean, but that country and its population are so fucking filthy they would probably poison all oceans around the world and kill all the fucking fish. Then we'd really be fucked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>This is legitimately one of my favorite scenes with Revy. Not just because of the sexy implications. But by the sheer degree of dominance Revvy has over Jane.<br>"Don't fuck with me. We're co-workers so I won't kill you, but I will make you feel a pleasure so intense that you'll lose your goddamn mind trying to reach that high again."</br></br>  <br>I'm...RARELY concerned with realism when I'm picking waifu's from a manga.</br>  <br>Everything he did he genuinely did to help out the kid and roberta. The maid is an idiot for thinking otherwise. Rock also went out of his way to try to help the twins, jap, and chiny girl. He is a good guy, but he has his flaws. He has to play the game in order to get the scum of the city to work in his favor. Basically your full of shit</br>  <br> i'm not racist BUT </br>  <br>You're fuck me</br>  <br>Wrong, Rock is the changer of worlds here, he manages to throw everyone, Revy especially, onto different paths and futures, the story still revolves around one jap salaryman and his influence to the city and the people</br>  <br>nope but Revy is very, let's say, territorial in nature and doesn't like intruders</br>  <br>India is a shit place, but I still want a qt dot dot waifu</br>  <br>Just wait for the 2D waifu to come to you, because she's just about as real as what you want.</br>  <br>eda best girl</br>  <br>Never said I wasn't racist. I am racist. But only with Indians.<br><br>I have no qualms with any other race.<br><br>But I can't forgive bad hygeine and bad food.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Also to be brutally frank here, they are nasty drunks, sorry to offend</br>  <br>That panel had me kekking so hard. Revy's reaction there is just glorious. Like her brain can't even process what she has just witnessed.<br><br>That Chinese chick is qt as fuck, though. I have no idea how Rock gets all these women who just want to hop on his cock without a second thought.</br></br></br>  <br>On the surface, he's the closest thing to a decent or a normal guy around the area. It's not like he's ugly and he is relatively approachable with no strings attached.<br><br>Try making a move on any other resident of that shit city and see if you live to another sunrise.</br></br></br>  <br><br>As in if it was about crack dealers? Because if so I would totally watch that.</br></br>  <br>That's true, but I feel like that would only hold true earlier on in the series. By the time the Chinese girl rolls along, the second Roberta arc has come to a close and Rock has started to develop notoriety and a reputation in Roanapur. Everyone knows there's something whack about him. Even Balalaika and Chang realize that this dude can mean serious trouble for anyone who gets near him. Not to mention the fact that Revy is continually indirectly cockblocking him since going after Rock would mean stepping on Revy's territory. Any girl with half a brain wouldn't dare get close to him.</br>  <br>For some reason I recalled him being bent over the car when I first saw that moment in a scan of one of the manga pages depicting it.</br>  <br>Best damaged goods, though.<br><br>Only made better by it also being how she's scaring her off from going after Rock.</br></br></br>  <br><br>3rd /k/ommando here, if you like 1911's scaled down to .380, the Sig P238 is a dream to shoot.</br></br>  <br>Unlike the criminal element though, Rock offers zero incentive for backstabbing and will keep to the agreement.<br><br>Also regarding Revy, while she cockblocks, she also doesn't really do any harm to the parties involved. She's a very angry chihuahua basically when it comes to women approaching him. <br><br>Basically if you are a woman and want to fuck someone in Roanapur, Rock is the safest one. Now he's bad in his own ways, but at least it's not via a surprising action.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lotton the Wizard seems pretty safe too. I can't really see him pulling a lot of shit.</br>  <br>He's a LARPer though.<br><br>Do you want to be lightning bolted by a LARPer?</br></br></br>  <br>I can definitely agree that Rock is far and away the least likely person in Roanapur to fuck you over with the possible exceptions of Dutch and Benny, but then I also have to wonder if Rock himself ever gets any to begin with. Like, he easily could if he wanted to, but he seems to get real flustered by sexual advances like with Eda and the Chinese girl. That, and he never comes across as particularly interested in the first place. And then I also have to wonder if any feelings he has for Revy would get in the way. <br><br>Come to think of it, I'm kind of surprised that he was as calm and collected as he was around a near-naked Revy in the second Roberta arc. Like, it didn't seem like a big deal for either of them. Revy had no problem with him seeing her like that, and he didn't seem particularly fazed by it, either.<br><br><br>Lotton is probably the most moral person in all of Roanapur. He went out of his way to save Shenhua and Sawyer when he had no reason to, and he didn't do it to prove anything to himself like Rock would have in a similar situation. He just did it out of an unselfconscious kindness of heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The dude carries two C96's. He could sacrifice children to Satan and I would still hang out with him.</br>  All this /k/ talk makes me want to get a handgun.<br><br>So.<br><br>.45 or 9 mm?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What role is it filling? Every day carry, glovebox, nightstand, target only, woods carry, help us help you.</br>  <br>Unless you want to get a suppressor, I would go with 9mm. If you live in a shit state with magazine limits, .45 would be the better choice, since 9mm's main benefit is capacity.</br>  <br><br>paper punch? Not op but I'd like to try something nice for a pistol range.</br></br>  <br>Balalaika won't fuck anyone unless it's worth her time. To her wreaking havoc and setting the place ablaze is more fun than boring fucking. You've got to prove to her she doesn't just want you, she NEEDS you. That she needs to be your woman. To do that you need to be the alpha among alphas.</br>  Literally fuck Hiroe. He's got more pressing matters on his mind like watching Nisekoi and getting hyped that fucking Zero no Tsukaima novels are going to be written again. Oh yeah, he also likes playing with his Roberta figures.  Good before is started trying to be deep and failing.  <br>For a paper puncher, fondle some steel frame, full sized, DA/SA pistols at a gun store. When you hold one and think, "ah yeah, daddy likes that" go with that one. Caliber is pretty irrelevant, as long as you can find cheapo bulk ammo. Whatever feels good in your hand.</br>  <br>9mm<br><br>I like .45 but if this is your first handgun go with 9mm</br></br></br>  <br>For real do. What else does he do BESIDES write Black Lagoon? Does he have a lot of other shit to keep him busy? I swear it takes AGES? Or...does he not have a team to help him?</br>  <br>He draws doujins</br>  <br>fabi is a miracle of the universe</br>  <br>How does what I wrote imply otherwise?</br>  <br>basically, he draws hentai/porn</br>  <br> all these women <br>You mean two women? Including one with which it was pretty gradual? Unless you mean Eda, but I'm pretty sure she hit on him just to mess with Revy.</br></br>  <br>Like probably most of the characters. They're over mostly almost or over 30, what would you expect?</br>  Anyhow if you should come across anyone resembling Revy, my advice is  <br><br>I...<br>I can't even be mad at him for that.</br></br></br>  <br>But, unfortunately the prick neglects his "Magnum Opus" , his greatest work for side dishes</br>  <br> watch Nisekoi <br> Likes ZnT and reads the LN <br><br>What the fuck is going on? Why does Hiroe subject himself to such cancer?</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> waifus <br> plural <br>For shame, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck Madhouse actually animated those mini comics at the end of the tankobon? Did they animate MILF Balalaika?</br>  <br>He's like all artists, lazy bastards until inspiration hits them like a solid rock and then you can't stop them, but during those periods we turn into a shitty excuse, easily distracted and taken with this or that, I don't blame the bastard, but geeze finish the fucking story or at least hand it on to someone who can (which I never would) contradictory, I know but that's a true fucked up Artist</br>  <br> dub <br>LOL</br></br>  <br> why does this shitty otaku who is as infamous as miura and hirano for being a shitty otaku, read and watch shitty otaku media <br>Hm, bit of a mystery</br></br>  It made me realize how much I hate "gun fu"  <br>Ok, Miura is on a whole nother level. He is literally a social recluse who watches idolshit. Completely irredeemable if Berserk wasn't a fucking masterpiece.<br><br>Don't know much about Hirano, but Hellsing is already done. Is Drifters better?<br><br>But Hiroe seems like a pretty normal guy by mangaka standards. I didn't know he was a seemingly hardcore otaku. Kinda shatters my perception of him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miura has been like that for decades and a full blown otaku for decades<br>Hirano literally took characters from his porno doujins and put them in a manga<br>Hiroe is not a normal guy, he spends most of his time not doing his serialization to do TM doujins because he's a hardcore Fatefucker<br><br>The basis between all of their main works, Berserk, Hellsing and Black Lagoon, is what they think is cool. Guns, swords, demons, girls, tits, badass guys, it's all so overblown because they're all such overblown otaku</br></br></br></br></br>  The artist will sooner die than pen another fucking chapter right  <br> Hiroe seems like a pretty normal guy by mangaka standards </br>  <br>why is anything good, on hiatus these days.</br>    <br>Because we get what we deserve, which is...</br>  Which lagoon would you do lewd things with?  <br>I just watched the first episode after five years of watching anime. It's pretty good so far, hope Rock gets a bigger pair and stops throwing expensive military-grade rifles at helicopters.</br>  <br>I want Revy to ride my cock like a rodeo bull, and then flip me over and pound me with a strapon while calling me names</br>  <br>Fucking this.</br>  I would rail Eda against a wall like the dirty whore she is, get domination-fucked by Revy, and worship Balalaika from head to toe.  <br>Oh, it gets a fuck of alot better, buckle up for the ride, ya gunna have fun</br>  <br> muh shot placements! All you need is a .22 </br>  <br>There really isn't enough good Eda porn out there.</br>  <br>9mm<br><br>Don't kid yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>I can see Clint Eastwood fucking Eda like she was a cheap whore.</br>  <br> Balalaika <br> you fuck her <br> nope <br> she'll strapon your butthole till its raw <br> Best Girl </br></br></br></br></br>  so /a/ what do you expect out of the epilogue that is airing later today?  <br>Not much.<br>I hope for Clocktower cameos of Apocrypha and Strange Fake though<br>Especialy Gordes</br></br></br>   sunny days ending   <br>The only decent answer is Luvia.</br>  <br>Lots of stills, but the episode should be competent enough to wrap up the show.</br>  <br>Luvia.</br>  <br>Could care less about UBW. All I want is a HF PV and release date after the episode ends and confirmation that Miura is NOT doing HF.</br>  <br>Rin tell shirou that they have multiple universe, and as she told him the scene change to one of heaven's feel cool scene</br>  <br>I always expect nothing and wait to see if anything will happen, best not to hope for a good thing or to fear a bad, just to accept what happens, it's a Stoic type of thing</br>  <br> and confirmation that Miura is NOT doing HF <br>So you want it to be shit?</br></br>  How the fuck is there still an episode left? I thought this shit ended  I've been wondering, does Shirou get to keep Ea? I mean, it fell inside UBW when Gil's arm was cut off  <br>retard</br>  <br> implying Miura is a good director </br>  <br> Shirou <br> Ea <br><br>Hah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil has a NP that is in charge of collecting all the other NPs that he throws using GoB.<br>I'm pretty sure it would also grab Ea.</br></br>  <br>Ufo is already juggling God Eater. HF is really not likely.<br><br>And fuck you, Miura directed episode 20. He's okay in my book.</br></br></br>  <br>Won't happen.<br>I don't expect an HF trailer before the BDs are out.<br>Also the God Eater prescreening got cancelled which isn't a good sign.</br></br></br>  <br>If you watched to the end there's the mention of a Epilogue, make a note to yourself always check out the end of animu shows as they sometimes hide "easter eggs" or more info or scenes, FYI</br>  <br>The only thing good about 20 was the animation. The exchange of ideals was ok, but the lack of Shirou monologues hurt and greatly lessened the impact of Archer and Shirou's fight. It wasn't bad but it could've been so much better. Last Stardust is trash too.</br>  <br>Dude, the entire inner mind scene in the episode was genius. A perfect way to visually adapt what Shirou was thinking. I think it topped the novel in that regard.</br>  <br>Wait, when was this screenshot taken ? I can't remember it at all.</br>  LONDON<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh monologues <br><br>Fuck off retard</br></br></br>  <br>He is also responsible for the entire adaptation being awful. It was no different from DEEN's version of the Fate route.</br>  JACKHAMMERING  <br>Oh Jesus, is MAL here or something? It was a great adaptation.</br>  <br> muh shitty anime <br><br>Fuck off retard.</br></br></br>  <br>It was unwatchable.</br>  <br>17:08 right before shirou slashes gil across the chest.</br>  <br>How? Like, if you just don't like FSN, hey okay, that's your deal. People have different tastes, but it was a fucking solid adaptation of the UBW route. It covered everything with some really great animation and a few new bells and whistles.<br><br>Like if this adaptation was bad for your, I don't think you could like anything being adapted ever.</br></br></br>  <br>go home cooking priest.</br>  <br> secondary spotted </br>  <br><br>Luvia is shit.</br></br>  For all the people harping on about monologues, tell me, what important stuff hasn't been conveyed?  <br>Gil is dead, though, and Gil refused to get back the slime covered NPs he launched against Caster's tentacle creature.<br><br>They are probably still laying inside the riverbed.</br></br></br>  <br> assblasted primary <br><br>Reminder not to be deceived by sunk cost VNfag primaries.<br><br>They made the decision long ago to gorge themselves on an inferior medium, knowing full well that a superior, high budget, high quality better medium version was in the works.<br><br>They traded quality for early access to content. And misery loves company, they will stop at nothing to trick newfriends into making the same mistake they did.<br><br>You should do the following, at the bare minimum<br><br>1. Watch Fate/Zero<br>2. Watch UBW (UFOTABLE)<br>3. Decide to wait out for the end of UBW, or if you really must and cannot contain your autism to win nerdbattles on /a/, you can play the VN<br>4. Ditto for the last, worst, wormroutes like HF.<br><br>There is zero reason to choose an objectively inferior, decade old eroge VN over a far superior, better artstyle, animated, version of it.<br><br>Additionally the other fate releases spoil Fate/Zero -- the best standalone release of the entire fate series. It is idioitic to complain about how it ruins a subpar route like HF, when reading HF/FSN spoils Fate/Zero.<br><br>Fate/Zero is one of the greatest selling anime of all time for good reason. And /a/ will never stop being butthurt over it.<br><br>Additionally, people really overestimate how bad "spoilers" are. It's not like "It's his sled" level spoiler, it's just "ugh, ok that's what they decided to do"<br><br>You're supposed to enjoy the journey, not the destination, in Fate. And the (ufotable) anime is a luxurious limo ride on the main road. The VN is a model T that can travel on the side roads as well.<br><br>Take the nice trip and then circle back onto the dirt path if you really want to</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Like if this adaptation was bad for your, I don't think you could like anything being adapted ever. <br>If this is as good as an adaptation can get then nothing should ever get adapted into an anime again.<br><br><br>Fuck off back to MAL, reddit or whatever other place you came from. You Ufoshitters are too autistic to understand not everybody like shitty adaptations by your awful studio.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't an awful adaptation, but I guess my expectations were a bit too high. I thought with the huge ass budget this would blow the novel out of the water and at the beginning I sincerely thought that but everything became so average second cour. Episode 20 was good but answer was fucking horrible. So rushed which just ruined the mood, 24 was pretty decent too but it couldn't make up for the bad pacing and overall blandness of second cour.</br>  <br>How about you give us some examples instead of saying "It's shit"</br>  <br>I like how you're not even saying why you don't like it.</br>  Nothing<br>And I probably will still be dinsappointed</br>  <br> but answer was fucking horrible. So rushed which just ruined the mood <br><br>Do you actually remember how much material was left of the Archer fight after the end of episode 20? Like, not fucking much.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought with the huge ass budget <br>Whoever started this "Unlimited Budget Works" meme should be shot.</br></br>  <br>Episode 20 featured the "answer" part of Answer.</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/S8EQ69A9M9Y?t=45m  [ ]<br><br>Like, this is roughly the end of episode 20 right here.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll agree F/Z is the best, but no way in hell is UBW anime superior by any means. <br><br>I like it a lot don't get me wrong. But it just seemed to have lost its spark once part 2 started. I found myself getting excited at times, but overall I wasn't greatly anticipating every episode each week. In fact several weeks I wouldn't even bother watching the episode and just let it pile up and binge watch them. <br><br>When I played the novel everything seemed fresh and exciting. I also played the novel around 4 years ago so I pretty much forgot a lot of the intricate little details so you would think watching the anime would be a much better experience for me but that wasn't the case. Also doesn't help that the soundtrack is average for the anime too. The VN and even DEEN's soundtracks were so memorable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is that you, inexplicably, just didn't like it, and also you didn't enjoy the music.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with the second season. People harp on about it somehow being worse, but they never fucking say how.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Every single change from the VN was bad, it had almost no monologues, and they forced in anime original content. How can anyone who liked the VN think this is acceptable?</br></br>  <br>If you think the amount of monogues in a VN would be same as in an anime, you must be stupid.<br><br>That just doesn't work in that medium.</br></br></br>  <br>Replying to a ban evader who always posts his stale pasta.</br>  <br> muh monologues <br><br>Fuck off retard</br></br></br>  <br> Every single change from the VN was bad <br><br>Name things that were worse.<br><br> it had almost no monologues <br><br>Name stuff that needed to be conveyed that wasn't conveyed.<br><br> and they forced in anime original content <br><br>They added some stuff written by Nasu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh shitty anime <br><br>Fuck off retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Ufotable is not going to make any references to any of the spinoffs. And why would you want the second worst Black to show up? He's just barely better than the siscon kid.</br>  <br>http://www.animemaru.com/ufotable-a<wbr>irs-lets-play-of-original-visual-no<wbr>vel-in-place-of-fatestay-night-fina<wbr>le/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>They did do a Apocrypha reference earlier with Mordred.</br>  <br>Well I thought the whole Caster arc seemed kinda pointless and her backstory was dumb. I liked her as a character originally but I don't think she was portrayed in a very compelling manner and her reasoning for doing what she did wasn't explained well.<br><br>I did like the Gil v Berserker fight very much, but the Ilya dying and Gil ripping her heart out scene had no impact compared to DEEN. I liked how they showed Shirou getting enraged and Tohsaka trying to shut him up but there needed to be more effort put in that scene to really bring out the viewer's emotions.<br><br>UBW was great, and that was easily the best episode of the entire series so far imo, it explained the major conflict of Shirou and Archer and resolved it by the end but the only thing that bothered me was that it felt a little short. I wish they kind of dragged it out a bit instead of 1.5 episodes just make it two, or make the whole fight an hr long episode. It was really good but it felt too short. <br><br>Then it just got generic after that. Bad guy Gil wants to kill all people because they're boring, selfish mongrels blah blah, Shirou gets his power up from Rin in the form of a crest and then goes into battle. I did like the battle though. <br><br>And all that's left is an epilogue.<br><br>Part 1 had a lot of great buildup but I feel it wasn't all capitalized upon in part 2. There was some lost potential there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Name things that were worse. <br>Just to mention the most recent things: Archer vs Shirou, Saber vs Assassin, Shirou vs Gil, everyone of those fights were better handled in the VN.<br><br> Name stuff that needed to be conveyed that wasn't conveyed. <br>If you just want a short summarized version of the story go watch DEEN's version of UBW.<br><br> They added some stuff written by Nasu. <br>Nasu has become an awful writer and his ideas are worthless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would have been a lot better than what we got. If you can't do it right then don't do it at all.</br>  <br> has become <br><br>Look, the VNbabby can't bring himself to admit that the story he's obsessed with was written by a hack that has always been a hack.</br></br></br>  <br>Mordred's armor design predates Apocrypha.</br>  <br>Do you not like the story, or do you not like the adaptation?<br><br>Personally I found Caster to be an alright mid boss. She's certainly better than The Shadow, which I think was just fucking retarded from a story stand point. You got to understand her, and Ufo expanded her plot a bit, which was nice.<br><br>The one thing I think you are seriously wrong about is Ilya's death. You say DEEN had more impact, but they got it all wrong. They emphasized brute gore without any of the stuff that had substance. It was a brief shock scene, instead of a scene where you were supposed feel bad about this character who kind of got to know in the Fate route, going out so pathetically. Without the Fate route, they tried to connect this through referencing stuff with her with Zero, and I think it kind of worked. They did the best they could without the first storyline.<br><br>There really wasn't much else to add with the Archer fight, honestly. I can understand being blue balled waiting between 20 and 21, but that problem should be relieved with binge watching.<br><br>And honestly, it just sounds like you don't like Gil, and okay, he's not the greatest villain, but he serves a distinct purpose. He's there to give an application to Shirou's answer that he got from Archer. He wants to be a hero, so he's gotta do something heroic to prove himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No matter how bad he may have been it's clear that he has just become worse since writing F/SN.</br>  <br>Sounds to me like you have more of a problem with the source material than the adaptation. <br><br>I think this is the main problem most people have with the anime. UBW is a good adaptation, any flaws it has in storytelling is a direct result of its source material so you can't really blame the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Just to mention the most recent things: Archer vs Shirou, Saber vs Assassin, Shirou vs Gil, everyone of those fights were better handled in the VN. <br><br>How were they worse. You just keep going on about how they were bad without explaining yourself.<br><br> If you just want a short summarized version of the story go watch DEEN's version of UBW. <br><br>DEEN completely missed the point of the story. Ufotable told the story properly, they just didn't stop to explain to you literally every fucking thought in Shirou's head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What you say about the Ilya scene makes sense, and I guess I agree too. I guess they wanted to make sure viewers saw Zero and had some sympathy for Ilya's situation. Still I wouldn't have minded some more original content to make her more relevant in this route.</br>  <br>saber would pop out of nowhere and we got sunny days</br>  <br>This. This was a good adaptation, the problem of UBW are already problems in the VN. You can't improve much without changing a lot of things</br>  <br> How were they worse. You just keep going on about how they were bad without explaining yourself. <br>What is there to explain? They changed things and those changes were bad. Don't try to pretend that there wasn't major differences between the VN and the anime.<br><br> DEEN completely missed the point of the story. Ufotable told the story properly, they just didn't stop to explain to you literally every fucking thought in Shirou's head. <br>DEEN cut stuff out, so did Ufotable. Both are awful as adaptations for the exact same reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  Makidera and crew cameo  <br>Why don't you just admit the VN isn't that good?</br>  <br>I think a lot of the weaknesses people see are lessened once you have the full perspective of the VN. Characters you wonder who didn't do much tend to do better in another route. It all balances each other out for the most part.<br><br>I think people will understand this more once Heaven's Feel comes out. It'll round out stuff like with Ilya, Kirei, and Rider, and overall create a better picture.</br></br></br>  HAVE FUN IN LONDON. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, WORMS WILL JUST RAPE ME EVERYDAY.<br><br>Love,<br>Sakura<br><br> I actually think we'll see grown up Waver dismantle the grail and actually get a better end for Sakura from ufotable </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know this guy replying to a pasta, but i agree with him.<br>The second cour is somehow not as enjoyable as the first one.</br></br>  <br>I do think it's good though. I got what I wanted with this show, which is a solid adaptation of the Unlimited Blade Works route.</br>  I don't know guys, UBW felt like a generic shounen anime. While Fate/Zero felt like something more interesting? I remember Fate/Zero getting a lot of push in Japan, from real state offering merch of the show with the houses they rent, visa card, exhibitions with exclusive statues of the Servants and elements of the show made real scale like Caster's book or Lancer's dual spears or Gil's couch. There were even a wine collection for each Master/Servant team.<br><br>FSN merch looks like typical otakushit and fujoshit and it doesn't even get any of this special treatment by aniplex.</br></br>  <br>different anon here<br><br>of course it isn't, I just getting bored of people always bitching about the adaptation while actually it's the VN fault<br>hell, even ufo fixed some plot point in ep 24 that didn't make sense, for me at least</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it worse though?</br>  <br>The VN is great.</br>  <br> While Fate/Zero felt like something more interesting? <br><br>The vast majority of Zero was just either retreading stuff from the original VN, or twisting stuff from the original VN. Like the Iskandar fight with Gil. That whole scene was supposed to be a twist on Shirou vs Gil. Gil beats a guy with a Reality Marble instead of loses.</br></br></br>  <br> The vast majority of Zero was just either retreading stuff from the original VN <br><br>It doesn't matter, because it was better written. The multiple POV of different Master and Servant make for a better storytelling than following a single or limited POV.<br><br>That's why Aniplex gives little fucks about FSN as it gave to FZ, because FZ felt more adult not because the characters were older when they acted as manchildren, but because the storytelling was more balanced and less juvenile.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun times.<br><br> you'll never get a replica of a dickworm </br></br></br>  <br> It doesn't matter, because it was better written. The multiple POV of different Master and Servant make for a better storytelling than following a single or limited POV. <br><br>What the fuck? Having an ensemble cast isn't inherently better story telling, it's just different story telling, and comes down to your level of taste. FSN focuses a lot on the protagonist's development, while Zero goes about knee high deep on a lot of its characters.<br><br> That's why Aniplex gives little fucks about FSN as it gave to FZ <br><br>That's just plain wrong. UBW premiered in theaters internationally in four different theaters around the world. There's an art exhibition this upcoming July, and Aimer is going to be playing a live concert on the 4th of July at Anime Expo with several of the Ufotable guys there to push the localized release of UBW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.fate-sn-event.com/<br><br>Art exhibition, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br> Having an ensemble cast isn't inherently better story telling,  <br><br>It's in the Fate setting. Shirou's story isn't very interesting, he's fine but he pales when he's put in a cast with better and more charismatic characters.

That's your opinion. People readily talk about him and his character 10 years later. People get into heavy debates about his ideal, his progression, and everything about him. You seem like a bit of an Ilyafag though, because I don't really know many people that harp on about the backstory in that episode.

You were saying they were just riding off of Zero, but now you're talking about Madoka and how you just think Fate will be viewed as lesser. The facts are dude, that FSN is the origin. Zero might have sold a lot, but the countless spin off and products being pushed out aren't trying to emulate it, they're trying to emulate the original product. <br><br> That looks like CGI. <br><br>It's a mock up. You're gonna be able to sit on the couch where Archer first appeared.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How come Lancer didn't get a back story?<br>Even Assassin got one.</br>  <br>in F/HA, anon<br>same with Rider</br></br>  <br> shirou <br> dull <br><br>dude I've rarely seen people discussing about an MC, his character, morality and power 11 years after the original works is released<br><br>you just hate it because he's not an edgy adult badass character with a gun</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you 're replying to, but people still discuss everything Fate years after, not because they' re deep discussion but because of the different routes system that always raise conflict, everyone wants to debate about their "best" something. Fact that most threads are always about powerlevel or end up in powerlevel discussion that involves the same people should tell you something.</br>  I'm super late but I just noticed UBW does not stream on nico with eng sub like FZ did. How come?  <br>Discussion about Shirou, when people are really serious, aren't just a route war wanking. You can easily see people talking about the merits of his ideal, what he would do in certain situations, or just trying to just "get" his character.<br><br>Some folks say he's simple, but I've had to explain his character in UBW like, a million times.</br></br></br>  <br>Like, I've had some legit discussion about what exactly a UBW-like Shirou would do if placed in a HF-like situation.<br><br>By the end of the night you've fucking written a 2000+ word essay just talking to other people.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou is not dull, he's actually really annoying in a bland way, hard to put into words. Both him and his dad make worst protagonist. I rather have Shinji as MC honestly, at least that guy has charisma and actual personality.</br>  <br> I rather have Shinji as MC honestly, at least that guy has charisma and actual personality. <br>The "I like Shinji" meme has gone to far. I swear, some retards aren't even pretending anymore.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I agree 100%. Shinji deserves his own show. A show where he's not pushed to the side by that fucking moron Emiya and the Tohsaka bitch. It's so obvious the story's framed around making those too look good, when someone as charming, good looking, charismatic, and good looking as Shinji could easily main-line a story.<br><br>It's a complete missed opportunity of that hack writer's end, and a screw with that dumbass studio. Hopefully the BD sales show for themselves that the public wants more of that Shinji magic.</br></br></br>  <br>Fatefags are just austistic and the discussions are just between the same people with same shit repeated over and over. You guys always like to start bait alot, just so you guys could bash and wank your favorite character at the same time.</br>  <br>I'd rather have Zouken as the MC.</br>  <br>With thread IPs around now you know there are plenty of people talking about this stuff. Fuck, if it was just all the same guys I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have the same questions pop up ever other thread.</br>  The entirety of FSN would have been vastly improved if Shirou was a girl.  <br>You just want to masturbate to Shirou without feeling gay.</br>  <br>The original flashbacks were the only interesting part of the adaptation, and the gil fight. But the archer fight/reality marble stuff was so awful it ruined the show.</br>  <br>The Archer fight was solid. 20 and 24 were the highlights of the series.</br>  <br> Shinji certainly has more charisma than Shirou on screen, hell every other character has more charisma than Shirou on screen.</br>  <br>The archer fight was awful. The ubw world is not interesting at all when it should be iconic.</br>    <br>It was great dude. They got the entire point of the fight across fantastically, which DEEN certainly didn't do.<br><br>I'll admit the CG for UBW was pretty bad in episode 18, but it was cleaner in 20 and 21.</br></br></br>  Waiting on utw is suffering  <br>He's a fucking sword. Give him a break.</br>  Hopefully some Lord El-Melloi II. Generally just hoping for a lot of clock tower stuff when we probably won't get much of anything.  <br>The way I see it, is they'll do a short "where are they now" monologue dealing with the aftermath of the war, then the vast majority of the episodes deals with the school scene. Maybe the credits show some stuff with London.</br>  <br><br>That just makes me feel so sorry for Sakura.</br></br>  <br>HF preview at the end</br>  There's going to be absolutely nothing in London. It's only 30 minutes yo're going to get the scene in the classroom and Archer  <br>A chunk of Archer' answer was covered in 20 and 21, I believe.</br>  <br>I expect a scene of Shinji not being a dick and being a good guy, Shirou meeting with Ayako and seeing that she's okay, the classroom scene with Rin and Shirou, and Archer's last monologue where he reflects on the events of the war that just happened. Anything beyond that might just be some nice FHA easter eggs. I don't think we'll see Shirou and Rin going to London, though I'm kinda hoping we see them kiss or hug. Really hoping for a HF trailer of some kind at the end.</br>  What if they announce a "Fate goes to London" movie like the k-on movie?  <br>I wouldn't mind a post-UBW OVA or something.<br><br>Truthfully though I wouldn't mind anything that's post-UBW. It's got a lot of potential.</br></br></br>  <br>I could live without that</br>  <br>I want to live without that.</br>  DDD <br>D<br>D</br></br>    Well, I'll definitely say I'm gonna miss it. As much as these live threads were full of shitposting, they could definitely be fun.<br><br>Guess we'll have one last hurrah next Saturday with the Anime Expo panel, though.</br></br>  F/SN version when?  <br>There is also 1 more episode on Gunslinger Stratos today.<br><br>I'll admit I would have missed not hearing that OP and ED and skipping that shitty show</br></br></br>  <br>Never. People don't enjoy UBW nearly as much as they did Zero.</br>  <br>I enjoyed it as a show. Discussion on the other hand is a whole different beast.</br>  <br>It would be filled to the brim with shitposting, cookingpriest bitching about miura and how the anime ruined everything forever, the episode 20 ANN review, and then just a bunch of Gil getting BTFO at the end. I can't remember the last time any anime got as much shitposting as UBW did. Even something like KlK, SAO, and Titan weren't this bad.</br>  When is OST 2 coming out?  <br>Comes with the BDs.</br>  <br>When?</br>  <br>October 4th, I think?</br>  <br>07/07</br>  <br> October for Emiya and Last Stardust <br><br>FUG THIS PLANET</br></br></br>  Is today's episode a hour or not?  <br>nah last stardust is in an Aimer album that releases in July I think.</br>  <br>Last Stardust is on an upcoming Aimer album, which is coming sooner.</br>  <br>It's not, don't believe lazer's lies.</br>  <br>Regular length.</br>  I expect at least a kiss, damn it.  Is this gonna be the live thread?  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br>  <br>probably</br>  <br>FGO news and less likely HF news</br>  <br>It would just be a picture of a shit and &gt;just because you're correct dosen't mean you're right<br><br>because all /a/ did was shitpost this show</br></br></br>  I wonder how the cast feels about having done the same characters for over 10 years already.<br><br> inb4 here for the paycheck </br></br>  <br>It's a ten years old story. Aside from UFO's production choices there wasn't much to discuss.<br><br>Nakata Jouji and Sakura's VA dig it.</br></br></br>  <br>How could you not have fun voicing Kirei?</br>  30 minutes<br><br> GS recap <br><br>FUCK</br></br></br></br>  <br>They probably all enjoy their roles, some more than others. It's still not over, there's HF and a lot of them have voiced roles in FGO.</br>  <br>Shirou has been Sasuke for longer I think?</br>  Blue Guy's fighting Blue Guy again.  TRUST NOBODY   Gunshit again   Gil survived. <br>Kirei too.</br>    <br>Probably feel like a little family that gets together once and a while. If it was something like the Simpsons where that's like 70% of all they do, it might get a little stir-crazy.</br>  <br>Does it entertaint you to play with my hopes</br>  <br>It's your expectations that have failed you, not me.</br>  <br><br>Which do you think Nakata enjoyed more? Kirei or Alucard?</br></br>  <br>If I was getting 400K an episode I wouldn't complain about a single thing.</br>  <br>Yup UBW Shirou gets to keep EA and Gil's arm for future use.</br>  <br>why was fate/zero anime better? I was excited for ubw because it was my favorite route, but the f/z anime was more fun.</br>  What was that TV and web shit with Gunslinger? The web version didn't have a car?  <br>Alucard. He got to tell Integra she was giving him a hard on.</br>  <br>I personally don't really think it's better. I've been watching it again and it's basically paced and done the same was UBW. Maybe you just had higher expectations because you were really looking forward to seeing the route .</br>  <br>Can't you tell? The producer was a GENIUS.</br>  <br>Dunno, but I would probably enjoy voicing Kirei more, though I'm not a huge fan of Hellsing.</br>  <br>After working on multiple shows, movies, VNs, and other fate projects together, most probably enjoy their roles and working with each other.</br>  <br>They used the Apocrypha design, not the original one.<br><br> hating on Gordes </br></br></br>  <br>Does Sakura's VA even have other roles?<br>Rin's VA is a pretty big TMfag though</br></br>  <br>He actually cosplayed as Kirei during the Type-Moon convention thing last year, and gave an Engrish sermon. <br><br>I think it's safe to say he really digs his role as Kirei.</br></br></br>  <br>Was the voice cast for the VN the same as the anime? I know some anime VAs don't do VNs and vice versa.</br>  <br>Because people waiting F/Z anime since LN first volume. <br> Book (pure imagination) vs VN (imagination+CG+OP+Deen anime+UBW movie+PS2 version+manga <br>)<br> f/z anime was more fun <br>Well it's story about Shirou and Archer only. Not about POVs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vast majority were the same.</br>  <br>http://myanimelist.net/people/120/S<wbr>hitaya_Noriko<br>If you care to look for any shows that you've seen</br></wbr></br>  <br>HF Shirou with Archer's Arm vs UBW Shirou with Gil's Arm.</br>  <br>None whatsoever. Which is funny since shirou,saber,rin,archer,kirei,gil,r<wbr>ider and shinjis seiyuu all at least have a couple other big roles</wbr></br>  <br>F/SN didn't have voice acting when it first came out, they only added it for the all ages console version after the anime came out. So it has the same voice cast as the anime.</br>   Quality dramatic death <br>Gunshit</br>  <br>That's understating it. F/SN has some pretty famous VAs in it. For some of them, Fate isn't even close to their most famous role.</br>  <br>The only VA who is different in UBW from the VN is Kuzuki's VA since his original VA died. FSN originally didn't have voice acting in its first release and the popularity of the DEEN anime is what led to the re-release with the original VA's reprising their roles because such was going to be a highlight of RN.</br>  <br>The winner is obvious.<br>EA+GoB+UBW&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NLBW</br></br>  <br> died <br><br>source? I thought he's just sick or something</br></br></br>  Why doesn't Shirou trace Gate of Babylon?  <br><br>I wanna see UBW sequel with Shirou + Gil's arm use EA<br><br>well, he needs fuckloads of mana</br></br></br></br>  <br>so what did he do in ep 23 24...</br>  Why is it that literally every single spin-off of FSN is superior to the original VN written by Nasu?  10 MINUTES<br><br><br>bait/10<br>At least try</br></br></br></br>  Goddammit, the one episode I get to watch in Japan and its text heavy.<br><br>Also the show before has shit animation</br></br>  <br>Traced a bunch of swords that were fired from GoB.</br>  <br>They really aren't. The closest is Zero. Most of the spin offs are novelties.</br>  <br>Because Nasu is actually a terrible writer. So when a more experienced writer takes it up, of course its going to be better.</br>  <br>Because<br> you aren't right even though you're right <br>Is a dumb answer and a waste of 25 episodes.. This should've been 12 ep.</br></br></br>  Japan strong!  Today is the last day to BRAAAVEE SHIIIIINEE.  <br> I wonder how the cast feels about having done the same characters for over 10 years already. <br>https://twitter.com/uedakana/status<wbr>/612282087417053184</wbr></br></br>  Shit's getting serious in gunslinger, apparently  Final Futakuro thread<br>http://board.futakuro.com/jk2/res/1<wbr>687435.htm</wbr></br>  Well, let's see what happens.

It's will be better with proper closure but probably the action and animation takes too much budget for proper ending party or explanation about bells skill.</br>  <br>  implying kirito is not beta </br>  So, can all we agree that vanilla is best flavor?  <br>He can one shot kill goliath level 5 florr boss he is not beta.</br>  <br>I prefer my icecream to be chocolate and mocha flavored.</br>  So it's confirmed in lastest eps that bell stronger than ryuu and mostly at average level 5 adventurer.  S2 when?  But really, is Vanilla actually the best flavor?<br>Or is chocolate objectively superior?</br>  <br>Beru-kun would still get raped by Ryuu and a lot of other adventurers, but he has a nuke for when shit hits the fan.</br>  <br>Vanilla all the way, brother.</br>  <br><br>That sag...</br></br>  You know how this goes.<br><br>Anyone happen to know of any good doujins with straight traps fucked until they're gay?</br></br>   sadpanda thread <br> OP is a request for recommendation </br>   Trying to find the boipussy doujins <br> Mosaics Censors </br>  <br>Yes :^)</br>  <br>It is sadpanda you shit OP</br>  <br>yeah, there's a good one of that description that finally got translated recently<br> &gt;starting a sadpanda thread with requests </br></br>  Is this the most faggot op ever?  http://exhentai.org/g/790994/819a84<wbr>132d/<br><br>This is one of my biggest favorites of the past year.</br></br></wbr>  <br>henreader's a god<br>though not everything is in english on sadpanda yet, unfortunately</br></br>   thread's already dying <br>Thanks OP.<br>Hinemosu Notari a best.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/724912/a681be<wbr>d85f/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/519986/609416<wbr>cdde/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/129815/9dfa9b<wbr>8815/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> requesting shit with the OP <br>Everyone post their favorite two:<br>http://exhentai.org/g/767119/05f6ec<wbr>09c8/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/734534/b22a12<wbr>1751/</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/797344/39fddf<wbr>c70d/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/561433/00b234<wbr>1237/</wbr></br></wbr></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/811735/dfcbb6<wbr>ae26/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/588426/de509d<wbr>0bd9/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/643187/66d834<wbr>217b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/646103/3dc962<wbr>82d9/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/675309/a5445a<wbr>f3a2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/707614/15289d<wbr>62fe/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/721023/4a7c54<wbr>d1d2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/744543/d0f5b5<wbr>5c23/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/763962/43c36a<wbr>11d0/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/772419/aa13b1<wbr>5b96/<br><br><br>Some loli mang</br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr>  A month ago, <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125836687  requested a translation he'd been waiting on for years.<br><br>If you are still here, here you go:<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/827498/e4d2c0<wbr>935e/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll see your loli and raise you one<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/742831/edcc55<wbr>60d5/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/705394/faf4f6<wbr>b539/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/702008/3c1a0e<wbr>53a6/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/702004/eb647d<wbr>8f0b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/701168/aebb15<wbr>e756/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/700887/5e495e<wbr>83f9/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/699964/457036<wbr>b474/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/699303/a85921<wbr>cdb1/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/698043/556f8f<wbr>4ca5/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/695389/4947d8<wbr>c118/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/685247/ee5b3f<wbr>1c9b/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  I know I'll get a lot of flak, and called a "cuck" by crossboarders for this, but any other good NTR doujins where a milf or married woman gets addicted to the BBC?<br><br>I've only got<br>http://exhentai.org/g/427790/69b64f<wbr>9a13/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/431968/0a4595<wbr>4112/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/435201/68b147<wbr>3a3f/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/565149/dc93d4<wbr>c98c/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/632022/310bbd<wbr>53ed/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/753746/2b6e0b<wbr>0c82/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> H-manga <br> BBCs <br>Sissy 2D husbands only get cucked by fat old men.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127207118 <br>I'd have been fine with normal NTR, but I'm in the mood for some women being even more degenerate.

Futaba?<br>It's times like this where I wish I knew moon</br>  I want to  _be_  Yuuna      GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!<br><br>I got sick of the 2nd VN not being translated so I decided to go do a scenario myself.<br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/q<wbr>ppe7mp6adnelap/10-Inubouzaki+Fuu+ca<wbr>n%27t+deal+with+ghosts.txt<br><br>The translations are http://pastebin.com/KGYa8RaR but heavily edited as the original were crap. My Japanese is not amazing, so some things I had to assume the original was right in, but at least the English grammar is now readable. Also there are a few things lost in translation, especially さしすせそ, but if that's a problem, just go learn Japanese already.<br><br>Instructions for inserting the script into the VN can be found here: https://www.mediafire.com/folder/67<wbr>05q59djxz5n/YuYuYuS<br><br>It took a lot longer than I expected, mainly because the game crashes if there isn't a line break in the right space in every single goddamn line and English takes up so much more space than Japanese. Still, it would've been impossible without the guy who provided the mediafire files for inserting the script into the VN (see above), so kudos to him.<br><br>If someone else wants to do other ones, I'd be happy to provide editing/translating work for the other 2 crappy translations ( http://pastebin.com/3Jn10QDg and http://pastebin.com/cGYp9HEy ) but I'm not going through that line-spacing nightmare again. Have fun.<br><br>But on the bright side, enjoy Fuu and Itsuki trapped in slime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon!</br>  <br>Thanks anon!

There're still some parts that can be picked up. The story of [Yuuki Yuuna is a hero] still hasn't ended.

See you in 8 hours  <br><br><br>OK what's even supposed to be happen on these pics?</br></br></br>  Wait, so it's just a LN? No second season or whatever? Well damn.    <br><br>*happening</br></br>  S2 when?  <br><br>Scans when? Mine will take one month to arrive.</br></br>  <br>Why are they so gay, god damn.</br>  hey, remember that time Yuuna punched a thing.  Hey guys, script anon here. I've been really busy lately, but now I have some time to work on adding translation data.<br>Also some good news, while fiddling with the data files I found how to remove the text size limit, so separating lines won't be necessary anymore, I also found how to translate the color codes for names so adding the @ won't be necessary either.<br><br><br>Yeah the most annoying part is getting the line breaks right, but the crashing issue should disappear with this fix, if you can edit the other translations I'll gladly add them to the script file.<br><br>After I'm done re-editing the existing translations so they work with the new fix I'll upload them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, good times</br>  <br>There's still 3 unannounced news so I'm pretty sure a second season will be one of them. I'm not surprised they haven't released any information about a s2 yet considering it was only a short while ago s1 aired and they didn't expect it to get the popularity it did. I rather wait for them to pan out the details than rush it.</br>  <br>i l-love you anon</br>  <br>You're doing God's work anon!</br>  Got some tiny bit of information<br> The new LN chapter doesn't directly connect to the supposed S2 but to Nowayu. <br> Highlight is Wakaba's picture. <br> Chapter has an unrest atmosphere. <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cleaned this picture up a little bit.<br>Though, having a scan in 1200 dpi and original size I'd be able to make it look better.</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>It kills my kokoro that we know that something is wrong with Yuuna but we don't even know what exactly.<br>During the whole second VN Yuuna acted like she was daijobu so the others don't have to worry.<br>God damn it Yuuna you are supposed to talk to someone if you are troubled ;_; <br>Protect Yuuki Yuuna, even if she is 100% Vertex or godess or whatever now she still is perfect!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna may turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>c-come on anon,,, t-tell me it's a joke ;_;</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>Why this</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>So she's an immortal divine being with the  soul of a lion  now.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>W-which Yuuna?</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>REAL HUMAN BEAN</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  Okay, guys. Brace yourself for chapter summary, as well as a tiny snapshot of Wakaba. <br> Chapter starts with Sonoko and Karin in the bath talking about candidates for the next club head. <br> When Sonoko went home she found an old Hero Record book. <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br> However, at the last page there's a picture of a girl that looks like her. <br> The name is Nogi Wakaba, the year is 2015. <br> Sonoko shows the book to the club. <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br> She spaces out and only comes back to her sense when Fuu calls out to her. <br> Last illustration is of the entire club looking at Wakaba's picture. <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br> Chapter ends. <br><br>Inb4, the old Yuuna's soul hijacks our current Yuuna's body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br>damn not again Taisha</br></br>    <br>I'm scared, /a/. Also, <br> 2015 </br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br><br>I bet her soul is  burning as hot as the sun .</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br>I don't want to see her cry...</br></br>  <br>Guys, we got too used to the cute SoL moments in the vita and VNs. This is the true face of Takahiro. Brace yourselves.</br>  <br>E-everything will be ok.</br>  <br> Yuuna suffering continues <br>I can't go on guys, this is too much for my heart.<br>Can't she just punch things back into daijobu again? ;_;<br>God I need NoWaYu now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Y-yeha be postive guys!<br>The healing will feel even better after Yuuna dealt with the next shit happening. She is a hero she won't lose! let's just belive in her!<br>You're likely to succceed if you try!</br></br></br>  Okay, prediction time:<br>Yuuna absorbed a part of Leo's soul when she touched the core. She was in coma because of the adjustments in her soul that had to happen.<br>Leo's soul is now sleeping inside her waiting for a trigger to wake it up. I can see two different paths from there:<br>1. Yuuna becomes a combined hero-super-vertex and the final boss, Tougou calls out to her, Yuuna fights within her soul against Leo and wins.<br>2. Leo is actually an observer and messenger and its task is to see what's going on inside of the walls of the Shinju-sama and to assess if they should continue trying to destroy humanity or if the Shinju has a point.</br></br></br></br>  we evangelion now  <br>I'd like the first thing.  Actually as long as Yuuna is fine in the end I'd love any ending I guess. <br>The whole Takashima deal makes all this a bit complicated though. I think because of the <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br>we can assume that Yuuna either has <br>A. The memories of Takashima<br>B. Is Takashima<br>Just being named after her won't work now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God I need these YuYuYu Character songs now.<br>I am in need of healing.</br>  <br>Or may be Takashima   is Leo </br>  <br>Or maybe Takashima got absorbed by Leo, and now both got absorbed by Yuuna.</br>  <br><br><br>It would make a lot of sense that the humans dying within that small world reincarnate over and over again as they have nowhere else to go.<br>I like this idea a lot </br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like the Yuuna unintentionally absorbed Leo as fuel and is slowly becoming a godess theory. As time goes on she is becoming more aware of the past events and her blacking out is the recalling of past events triggered by her immediate surroundings. That play that they put on may have actually occurred word for word in the past.</br>   mfw all the people who got crazy about Yuuna's fainting after ep.12 aired were right after all   Guys, I think we're too naive to thinks that there'll be any scans in the near future. Remember that this is from a Visual Fanbook, not a magazine, not many people are willing to dissect their book to scan it.  <br><br>Makes me wonder why there are no paper-thin flexible scanners. There are paper-thin flexible displays, shouldn't be too hard to create something like that using a combination of microscopic light sources and detectors that basically create a snapshot of the surface they're put on.</br></br>  <br>T-try not to give up ;_;</br>  i need more healing already...  <br>Just gives me incentive to buy the books myself.</br>  I want to fuck Yuuna.  <br>Healing when ;_;</br>  <br>Staying true in her time of struggle, eh?</br>  <br>Alright, here's Yuuki Yuuna 24-hour coverage, edited/retranslated: http://pastebin.com/QpW8Dys6<br><br>Note that the original TLs don't distinguish between Tougou dialogue and Tougou narration - I've left it as is, but if you get confused anywhere let me know.<br><br>Actually, the original translations were a lot worse for this one, reading like a machine translation at times - my favourite parts were the copy-paste definition of 顔パス - "free admission for being well known" and the translation of 国語 as "national language" instead of Japanese. <br><br>Note everyone that this scenario contains the most information about Yuuna's post-recovery status that we get in the VN.<br><br> Tougou: There are still mysteries left, but with everyone, I'm sure... <br> Tougou: I casually raise my head to the sky. <br> Tougou: Since it is noon, the stars aren't visible. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tougou is becoming a stalker.<br><br>Also<br> Tougou: However, did they really return? <br> Tougou: Could it be that we were granted something new...? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn Takahiro! i'm not ready for this!</br>  <br>No need for that, my copy will arrive in about 4 days. If there's still no scans for 2nd translator anon, I'll take up the task myself.<br><br><br> Yuuna's soul (consciousness) fused with Leo and then got taken away as offering. <br> When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br>I can see this happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tougou: ...I let them know about being chosen as an offering. <br> Tougou: However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Tougou: Just being delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>About this part, I think it should be<br> ...My parents knew about me being chosen as offering. <br> However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Just seeing how they're so delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>As seen in Wasuyu, Taisha only hid the truth from the heroes, not their parents so it'd be weird for Tougou to be the one letting them know. Her parents knew the truth and didn't do anything about it, however, seeing how they still truly care about her, she doesn't blame them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Such a mature behaviour from a teenaged girl really strains my suspension of disbelief.<br> Just kidding. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 喜んでくれただけで, which definitely means that the parents are the one's being delighted with Tougou's recovery. I think I intended it to be "Just them being delighted with my recovery is sufficient" but accidentally a word. Sorry.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>However, the "let them know" is correct, 知らされていた definitely implies Tougou imparting the information to her parents.</br>  <br>Wait nevermind, I'm an idiot. The information was imparted to the parents but not by Tougou, you were right.</br>  <br><br>I love Karin</br></br>    <br>She looks like a mix between Sonoko and Wasshi.</br>  <br><br>That's a fucking glorious hairstyle.</br></br>  <br>Hot damn, she looks like some bad-ass Taisha hitwoman</br>  <br> Or may be Takashima is Leo <br>Or may be Takashima Yunna is   Yuuki Yuuna, when she is in coma. Mental time travel yo. So they actually foreshadow it in the spin off?? Damn. </br></br>  <br> time travel shenanigans <br><br>Now we're talking.</br></br></br>   Standing on top of Kamagura castle's inner right citadel in Kaogawa prefecture, Nogi Wakaba stared at Seto Inland sea.  <br>6 main characters:<br> Nogi Wakaba <br> Kamisato Hinata <br> Takashima Yuuna <br> Gun Chikage <br> Doi Tamako <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br><br>Tfw Wakaba's flower is the same as Tougou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to mention, for this one, Takahiro's just in charge of planning, Akashiro Aoi'll be the one writing it.</br>  <br> Gun Chikage <br><br>I hope that is also her weapon of choice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So I missed a few threads, this is going to be another LN series like WaSuYu?</br></br>  <br>Yes, it'll be about the very first group of hero back in the time before they changed the calendar.</br>  <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br>Actually, it's "Iyojima Anzu".</br></br>  <br>Elysium works fine, Bloatgirls if you desire so.<br><br> Lesbian <br> LESBIAN <br>You delusional fuck she even writes that her dream is to become a wife.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's Marugame Castle, which is the one that Sumi visited with her mother in episode 10.<br>So the setting will probably be the same as WaSuYu's, meaning that the old Yuushas won't have to see their homes turn to fire at the end of the LN.</br></br>  <br>Elysium's release is overfiltered garbage.</br>  <br>Yeah, my mistake, it's Marugame castle.<br>Their home won't turn into fire but the rest of the world might. <br><br>Got another interesting detail in the new chapter<br> Sonoko talks about the type of person she likes. <br>  &gt;It sounds exactly like she's describing Wasshi.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/651<wbr>19<br> 2018 <br> mfw 2015 nao <br>THE SUFFERING NEVER ENDS<br>WE HAVE NO FUTURE</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>I don't really know how to tell the difference man, the only thing I can measure is blurriness and even that I'm not very good at.</br>  <br>Tfw Vertices's attack is in 2015. We'll never get to read it. <br>All joking aside, they probably just fucked the release date. Officially, the Visual Fanbook's supposed to be released on 30th yet they're selling it now.</br></br>  Still no scans.  <br><br>2018.7.30 is the date when the novel events happen.<br>The novel starts being published in September's Dengeki this year.</br></br></br>  <br>The Hero Record was written starting from 2015, though.</br>  <br>Then maybe it doesn't start with the very first event?<br>I mean what the fuck else could 2018.7.30 stand for.<br>Alternative idea: maybe we're starting off with a few members and gain a big party by that date, there are 6 people to be collected after all.</br></br></br>  It can't arrive soon enough.  <br>We're counting on you, anon.</br>  Even if we get no scans this time there'll still be translation as some of us also bought the book. The problem is when Nowayu starts, there're no guarantee that each chapter'll get scanned as soon as it comes out or at all.  <br>I wasn't arround when WaSuYu got scanned but there were no problems that time as far as I know so why would it be different now?</br>  <br>WaSuYu has been out for months before the anime started and translations began.<br>We only really had to wait for the final chapter.</br></br>  <br>And the final chapter never got scanned, an anon had to the digital version released half a month later of the magazine. If Nowayu has no scans, who in here has enough money and is willing to keep buying the magazine for ~8 months straight?</br>    <br> High quality scan <br>is it happening!?</br></br>    <br> I'm feeling healed already </br>    <br>glorious school girl with Japanese sword and ponytail.</br>  <br>I want to touch their marshmallows<br><br> that underwater navel peek <br>too lewd</br></br></br></br>  <br> Katana <br>Meh.<br>Hopefully they have someone with a mace/flail/staff/anything blunt in the new old crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe we're going to get an axe again. <br>Her sword looks quite special to not be used in actual combat. Maybe they're going to fight without transforming and just got some stats boost this time. <br> No fairy <br> No magical armor <br>I wonder how many of the main 6 will pull a Gin before the final chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>or get one hit killed by scorpion in the guts.</br>  <br>Its been three hundred years, They could be related.</br>  <br>Where does this leave Gin now anyway?<br>There were six Yuusha in the past- not seven.<br>So either Gin or one of the six remaining girls in 300 cannot be a reincarnation of one of the six girls in the past.<br>Could this mean- Gin's death was an accident? She was never supposed to have been a Yuusha?<br>Or is one of the current girls not supposed to be a Yuusha? Which one would it be? Itsuki? She only became one to be with her sister. Or Karin? Who only became one because another Yuusha died?<br> They are creating way more questions with this story than they are answering.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody said they have to be a reincarnation.</br>  <br>Is it back in stock? Or did they really sell out in the first 30 minutes it was on sale?</br>  <br>so last night I posted this<br>and today I come home and find this: <br>She even carries a sword as her weapon.<br>An Ikemen mahout shoujou named Wakaba who even carries a sword! At least they changed the hair and eye color.<br>Will this Wakaba princess carry loli's as well?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hoenstly think the chance of one of the Yuushas being a loli is pretty high.  Gotta please the audience. </br>  <br>I don't care as long as there's a megane Yuusha.<br>Seriously.<br>Come on.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this? Sonoko's little sister?</br>  <br>Sonoko's ancestor.</br>  <br> 2014 <br> yuuna punches a thing <br> 2015 <br> yuuna is a thing <br>What went wrong?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This really makes it look like Sonoko is entering the Karinbowl. To win.</br></br>  <br>Don't lose hope. Sonoko After got translated based only on cellphone pictures.</br>  So will Takashima finally get an awesome red scarf of badassitude  <br>I thought Itsuki was the acting loli since she was only 12?</br>  <br> &gt;When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br><br>Who in the name of fuck is Takashima?</br></br></br>  <br> Only leaves wincest route left <br>Praise be to Sonoko.</br></br>  <br>One of the original yuushas, along with Wakaba.</br>  <br>But when asked what type of person she likes, Sonoko basically described Wasshi, or so I heard.</br>  <br> Itsuki &amp; Fuu <br> non-straight <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>I pick Itsuki  x  Fuu</br>    <br>Yes, but she has to face reality like Karin had to. Maybe that was the real reason Sonoko cried in episode 8. If the Vita game is canon she already knew Togo had lost her memories.<br>So it makes more sense that when she saw Yuuna with her that she realized that Togo had found someone else.</br></br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #3<br><br>Remember to keep relaxing and taking it easy.<br><br/></br></br></br>  Requesting Tharja holding Sharas headband with a confused look on her face please, or trying to put it on.

That's kind of a two panel idea but you definitely don't need to do that, anything cute would be nice, especially beach related. I'm in the mood for something kinda silly this weekend. Thanks! Also, this is probably the last thread I'm gonna be able to make it to until tomorrow night, so good luck guys.  <br>Wouldn't it explode? Or is that only if you throw it?</br>  <br>Not good enough to draw waifus yet, so I gave this a try instead.</br>  <br>Prinnies are kicked and knifed all the time without exploding, i think, I'm not exactly sure on the specifics, but they definitely explode on impact after they land? And if we're talking hero prinny, he has 3 chances before he explodes.<br> First one to drop the prinny goes boom? </br></br>  <br>not bad, inoribro.</br>  <br>Wish I could draw Inori every week, but you guys would get tired of my art.</br>  <br>Please don't disgrace the sharkman like that, keep it to your pixelfags circlejerk</br>  Requesting Sawyer with a teddybear or stuffed animal of some sort:<br><br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1673276<br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1842966<br><br><a href="http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.j<wbr>pg</wbr></a></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Requesting Fujibayashi Ryou dressed as a Civil War era nurse, please, perhaps changing dressings or watching over patients.

Requesting Tamamo dressed as your favorite shipgirl or abyssal girl. If you don't watch Kancolle then anything is fine.

If you would rather have her dressed in a dramatic pose instead that would be just a great. Thanks and have a wonderful weekend!<br><br>Here are some references:<br>http://i.imgur.com/8AYStZi.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/pr6YVme.png<br>http://i.imgur.com/Do749bK.jpg</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Very nice work. Colors are very nice and thats some great  hand hiding.  <br><br>The one issue that sticks out to me the most is the pose. She is facing towards the front, head turned right and looking back to the front. If you try to do the same pose in real life it feels awkward. When doing your sketch work for pose try to recreate to the pose in the mirror and see how it both looks and feels. Might help steer you in the right direction.<br><br> This doesn't pertain directly to your drawing here but this might also help with pose construction as well. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eyes and hairline need to come down, right now her eyes are where her brow should be. Where the cheek dips in is about where the eye line goes.</br>  <br>ack its sometimes hard to see some flaws on your own work, sorry about that</br>  Requesting Yutsuki.  Requesting Kuroneko cosplaying as Nya-tan https://i.imgur.com/uhBNHCd.jpg  Requesting Aichi, anything is appreciated.<br>If you want a ready idea, him drinking a can of anything at a bar while smiling at the viewer would do fine.</br>  <br>I'm not OR, and there no reason to apologize anyway. Just a couple things I noticed, keep it up</br>  <br/>  <br>Oh, so that's who that was.</br>  <br>Wow, how'd I miss this? Thank you Boa.</br>  Cyan from show by rock rocking out in this outfit.  Requesting Tsukihi mountain climbing, plus if she's dressed like Aoi https://i.imgur.com/fwePH9p.jpg  <br>Yeah that wasn't me.</br>  Requesting Pyrrha Alexandra in some sort of Clergy uniform with thigh high boots  Requesting Yuki intensive reading a manga or a LN while wearing her glasses, thank you in advance  <br>I was asleep when you posted this so I hope you see this, thank you so much drawfriend, she looks amazing, I'm really happy you all considered drawing her, I didn't expect to get as many deliveries as I did. I hope you enjoyed drawing her drawfriend.</br>  <br>Kurumi is MY waifu.<br>Back away anon.</br></br>    <br>Sorry anon but unlike you I'm not a cuck.<br>She's mine and mine alone.</br></br>  <br>An informational and illustrated guide on cuckoldry.</br>  <br>A nice little pictureif you're a stupid piece of shit that thinks waifu = favorite character.</br>  Requesting anything cute of my daughteru, Fiona Mayfield. Thanks in advance!  <br>Summer is real</br>  <br>/2cents<br>Hope I'm not being rude.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Really you guys?<br>I'm not him but even an obscure waifu is going to have dozens of real husbandos who love her in the world. At some point you have to make concessions to reality. <br><br>Trying to feed your daki is a bad idea, for instance.<br><br>So is raging at waifufriends who love her as much as you do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The idea that you love her as much as me is both laughable and insufferable. Eat shit, you sack of garbage cuck.</br>  <br>Or, you can just tell everyone who dares try to take your waifu to fuck off.<br>Simple.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, nah, fuck off, cuck. I'm not going to like you especially if you were to claim that my waifu is yours. Kill yourself.</br>  Requesting my husbando Kuranosuke Koibuchi, perhaps acting romantic and/or saying " I love you."<br><br>Have a good weekend.</br></br>  <br><br><br>This is the drawthread, not the insecurethread.</br></br></br>  <br> le insecure creep <br><br>Okay, spooky.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying a character from a series that hasn't come out yet is either of your waifus. </br>  <br>You know its a manga right?<br>Its been out for like 2 years.</br></br>  <br> y-youre just insecure <br> how dare you tell me to eat crow <br><br>Waifu means fav girl of the week so I don't even know why they're getting mad rofl lol xD</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127249943 <br>No, no i wouldn't.<br>That's fucking gross.</br></br>  Let's play a little game, /a/. For every drawing that you make, you get to watch 1 episode of anime. No drawings, no anime. Think you're up for the challenge?  <br>And I suppose she just happened to become their waifu a few weeks before the series comes out.</br>  <br>She's been my waifu for over 6 months.<br>And i only just started requesting because before the anime released visuals there has been next to non fully body visuals of her.</br></br>  <br>I have like at least 20 or 30 episodes worth of credit<br><br>I've watched 2 series this season, the booru has over 50 of my things and I started in April</br></br></br>  <br> implying I watch anime anymore <br>I just come here to see/draw cute girls and get mad.</br></br>   127249278 <br>Not requesting this weekend so I want to second this one (not linked properly so requester isn't disappointed to find this as the reply instead of a delivery)</br>  <br> as much as you do. <br>I'll concede a lot of things to reality, but that will never be one of them. The best I could do is a begrudging tolerance conditioned on the other person being well-behaved. Even then, that's only because shitting up a thread doesn't actually solve anything, and I don't want my actions to reflect poorly on her.</br></br>  <br>Do you at least read manga?</br>  <br>Yeah, nah. There are plenty of full body shots of her, you're full of shit. Not to mention the manga only has about 30 chapters that are translated.</br>  <br>If they waited any longer, they'd be dismissed as seasonalfags for months.</br>  <br><br>That just sounds like you're actively trying to make your life as difficult as possible for yourself while ignoring reality. It doesn't have to be that way, after all you're debating subjective measures that can't really be proven.</br></br>  <br> It doesn't have to be that way <br>Agreed, he can just choose the thinking man's fetish and be a cuck! Nothing wrong with sloppy seconds, am I right?</br></br>  <br> not learning the same language that your waifu speaks <br>And you claim to love her.</br></br>  <br>Lots, and I actually watch the anime I presently own, sometimes. I haven't watched any airing anime since 2010 ,or something, whenever Steins;Gate aired. Just finished catching up with Hero Academia, it's pretty good, cute and kind of serious.<br> Artstyle makes the girls super cute too. </br></br>  <br>They're worse than seasonal fags because they just saw a cute girl and started requesting. How come neither of them requested at all before the series was announced?</br>  Cuck Weekend Drawthread  I'd like to see my Noir as a redneck-y fisherman<br><br>Denim shorts, flannel shirt, suspenders and a boonie hat with ear holes<br><br>Anything is good though, have a good Saturday</br></br></br></br>  Can't you just get along like Inoribros do?  <br>Well then just do the same but replace anime episodes with manga chapters/volumes.</br>  <br>Good job at dismissing what I said, seasonalfag. I could make a ref right now with the amount of full body shots she has in the manga.</br>  <br> (I won't, because) shitting up a thread doesn't actually solve anything, and I don't want my actions to reflect poorly on her. <br><br>I think that's all anyone can ask.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even the same person, though.</br>  <br> Hero Academia <br>I like you.</br></br>  <br> liking shit taste </br>  <br>Ah, sorry bout that, anon.</br>  <br> How come neither of them requested at all before the series was announced? <br><br>I said it literally said why 13 posts up.<br>Stop pulling shit out of your ass. <br><br><br>That wasn't even me, and go ahead. Enjoy cropping out manga panels for the next 20 hours.<br><br>I dont care if you believe me or not, its what happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nobody should be surprised by this turn of events. This is the same place that defends a faggot wanting to see his waifu fucked by horse dicks after all.  Requesting Pacifica as a cute sailor girl, please!<br>http://img.ctrlv.in/img/15/06/26/55<wbr>8d58e48832c.jpg</wbr></br>  <br>Fight me, you'll never make me draw.<br> I'm already burned out drawing for other boards, please no more. <br><br><br>I'm telling you anon, if I could mimic the same style, I'd be drawing Uraraka and Frog a lot. They're just so cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> not understanding board culture <br> applying 3d logic to 2d <br> using buzzmemes like "cuck" or "summer" <br><br>I feel sorry for you guys. The world my waifu lives in was created just for me. When I see some one with the same waifu as me I congratulate him as he truly knows love in his own world with his version of her.<br><br>When you move past your petty jealousy and your childish behaviors. I'm sure you waifu will be waiting for you, maybe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   arguing like children over an imaginary girlfriend    oora is not part of the 200+ club   Requesting Snufkin with a computer and not knowing what to do with it  <br>I know that it's subjective, and I would fully expect the other person to feel the same way.</br>  <br> The world my waifu lives in was created just for me. <br><br>Must be nice to be a head canon cuck as well.</br></br></br>  <br>now*</br>  <br>Wow, man, that was really hard. No, seriously, that was so hard I could never go to such lengths for my waifu.</br>  <br> board culture <br> then complains about memes <br><br>Pick one, you head-canoning cuck. At the end of the day you're content with the idea that someone else wants to fuck your waifu and then makes you trash. If anything you're more in the wrong because jealousy is the normal and more human response, but I guess cucks shouldn't be considered as humans in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;not understanding board culture <br><br>Nigga our board culture IS to defend our waifus honour from other greasy neckbeards</br></br></br>  <br> implying numbers matter  <br><br>I love every single picture of my waifu. Numbers are only used for shitposting.</br></br></br>  Requesting my lovely Yuzuko getting a brain freeze from eating some shaved ice. I'd be fine with anything though.  <br>Quality &gt; Quantity</br>  Tamamo in flowery lingerie/a negligee<br>Thanks</br>  <br>BTFO<br>just get rid of all that empty space and is a pretty nice little ref</br></br>  <br> Ended up cropping it because the body just looked too wonky. <br>Oh I know how that feels, don't worry about it. But the rest looks very nice, you might want to try drawing with less scratching, your drawings will look even better with that. Thank you for drawing her, hope to see more of your drawings soon!</br></br>  <br>I'm not a greasy neckbeard tho, I'm attractive and fun. I can love my waifu without withdrawing to a fantasy world where she's mine alone because I'm not terrified of the concept of losing love to a better person than I.</br>  The fuck is going on around here?  <br>Call the waifu police</br>  Requesting Natsume making a smoothie with a blender thanks in advance  <br> retreat to a fantasy world where she loves you and you alone <br> but it's okay guys I'm totes attractive and fun and cool <br>Yeah okay. Head canon cuck.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm not a greasy neckbeard tho, I'm attractive and fun.  <br>Anon-kun pls</br></br>  Fuck off and stop derailing the thread with your retarded argument.  <br>That kids, is how you get someone BTFO.</br>  Requesting a drawing of Len and white len doing a fusion pose,<br>Or a drawing of len wearing frilly gothlolita like clothes.<br><br>Any drawing of len would be fine too.</br></br></br>  <br><br> BTFO <br>Not without side and back views</br></br></br>  <br>If you follow such logic that makes you cuck as well, since there is at least one person in world that dreamed about fucking you're waifu, only if she is not some kind of obscure female character from some kind of third-grade one shot manga of course. Way you apply 3dpd qualities to fictional character, constantly think about "possibility of cheating" and got yourself triggered by it, make guys like you being greatst cucks among all waifufags and of course, if you think that there is no way that "your" waifu was lusted by anyone but you, you're as much as head-canon fag as anybody else from so-called "neo-waifu threads" but they, at least, don't deny that fact. Way you behave reminds me of latent homosexuals, too afraid to "cross the border' because society will call you "weird".</br>  Why can't my hand ever do what I want it to do?  <br>In the center with all the small pictures on the right is a just fine side view. My waifu doesn't have a back view and she gets drawn consistently.</br>  <br><br>Because there is no direct biological link between your conscious perception and the neural impulses that lead to that perception. Our brains are not particularly adept at art initially.</br></br>  Can you guys stop now?  Requesting Rozalin dressed as Farangis from The Heroic Legend of Arslan, please.  <br>Nice meme pic. Where'd you get it?</br>  <br><br>Updated ref.</br></br>  <br> no it is YOU who is the cuck <br> and also a homo meanie bo beanie <br><br>Damn that's a lot of words and mental gymnastics for what amounted to a "no u"</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Yukino, anything non-lewd is fine.<br>Thanks in advance!</br>  <br>Updated the ref just for you. She's wearing a school uniform anyway so there really is no need for a back view as long as yo have the front.</br>  <br>Your body was designed to chuck spears and pick fruit. Making a pencil behave is way, way outside our design criteria.<br><br>Fortunately, our brains are plastic and can adapt to do almost literally anything, Unfortunately, it takes fucking years to bend them into shape. <br><br>Learning to draw involves setting aside large sections of your brain's real estate for 3D modeling, hand-eye coordination, and detailed diagrams of human anatomy (or whatever it is you're drawing) . Your brain is using that space right now to remember the names of your second grade classmates and how to kick a ball. It's not gonna delete all that shit and install drawfag 1.0 unless you force it to.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off. Hysterical bitchfights about who's the "real" boyfriend of a fucking cartoon character are goddamm retarded.</br>   all these filtered cuck posts <br><br>Good thread crossboarders.</br></br>  <br>Can you do me a favor and put all your ref in imgur and give them to me?<br>All these wasted white space drive me mad and I need to correct this.</br></br>  <br>Sorry senpai, I didn't mean to discriminate against your cuck fetish.</br>  Requesting Yuuko and something summer.<br>Sundress, ice cream, or whatever, as long as it's reminiscent of summer.<br>Thank you.</br></br>  Requesting my waifu Yukari.<br><br>I'm fine with anything, but seeing her dressed like something out of Mad Max or a Fallout raider or something would be cool.<br><br>Have a good weekend</br></br></br></br>  Remember to not nibble the bait  I love how this thread is always 95% of shitposting and 5% of actual requests / drawings.  <br>Whoa, this shit has gotten out of hand, guys.<br><br>I'm the OP of that request. Just call me K0 or something. <br><br>Listen, I don't care who or what all y'alls waifus are. They could be shit-tier, they could be mine, they could be whatever. But don't just go and start a flamewar on a fucking waifu thread just because someone shares the same waifu as you. They're not gonna take the waifu's love away from you, alright?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Protip: Most waifus are in love with a dude in their series, so by your reasoning you probably lose no matter how much you shitpost here.</br>  It ends, for now.  What's wrong with all these writers of fantasy LNs and manga?<br><br>It seems that they aren't capable of world building and character development that they have to resort to a virtual RPG system.<br><br>I don't need information about XP,HP, MP, status ailments and stats.</br></br></br></br>  I will fuck Red Chaika in the mouth!  I want to shave Chaika's eyebrows!  <br>It's called being a shit writer, OP.</br>  <br>hearing characters in akame ga kill use the words "level up" triggered the shit out of me</br>  <br>and then I will cum on her eyebrows!</br>  No they are not. <br><br>My guess is that they all like Rance a bit too much but ignore that it's a developed setting outside of the level stuff</br></br>  <br>I don't know about manga, but LNs are an incestuous creatively-bankrupt medium consisting entirely of teenaged kids ripping off existing fiction. So it's not surprising that they just ripoff whatever's popular and the result is generic schlock.<br><br>I hope you're not using Chaika as an example though, I thought it was a thoroughly competent fantasy story.</br></br></br>  <br>You fucking monster</br>  <br>I swear I just saw another thread like this.<br>And who cares about what you want, I like them.</br></br>  Is this the birth of an epic new meme?  <br> I hope you're not using Chaika as an example though <br><br>I'm using Chaika for Chaika's expression and Chaika a cutie.</br></br></br>  <br> What's wrong with all these writers of fantasy LNs and manga? <br>Western fantasy is all over Tolkien's dick. Eastern fantasy is all over a different dick.<br>What's the matter, don't like strange dicks?</br></br></br>  <br>Chaika is cute!<br>CUTE!</br></br>  <br>Are you kidding me? Chaika is trash aside from the girls.</br>  <br>Get fucked. Chaika was a decently fleshed out fantasy setting with some history and consistent themes.<br><br>Most importantly, it didn't fucking drown the viewers/readers in exposition every two pages. Toru and Akari don't have long conversations about what saboteurs are to inform the viewer despite the fact that both characters would know what saboteurs are. Instead, we get the details when they become contextually relevant.<br><br>That has to be the biggest pitfall in LNs: worthless exposition dumps.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaika had potential, but the author had no idea what he was doing with the world building. Or maybe the anime just did a poor job explaining it. Who knows.</br>  <br> Who knows. <br>People who read the manga might?<br>Why is it that anons keep insulting source material they have never touched?</br></br></br>   <br><br>Chaika is based on a LN. It's also shit aside from the cute girls.</br></br>  <br>Because it's an LN.<br><br><br>I disagree. The worldbuilding in Chaika was good, excellent by typical anime/manga/LN standards. I liked that it didn't explain things but kept the world as logically consistent as it could, and wasn't jacking off in my face all the time with fucking exposition dumps.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah man, I felt like the worldbuilding was great in the anime, atleast for the country itself. I dont know about the surrounding countries though.</br></br>  <br>It's a lot easier to use a standard RPG system that most of your NEET reader will understand without problems than to actually be creative.</br>  <br>Is this some new kind of bullying kids are into these days?</br>  On the flipside<br><br> setting the turns the RPG system on its back and makes the mechanics central to the story </br></br>  <br> flipside <br><br>more like the writer doesn't have any imagination</br></br></br>  <br> commenting on the author and his idea of world building <br> did not even touch the LN <br>secondary spotted</br></br></br>  I get it when both sides come in to play, but I don't get Danmachi.<br><br>Is it a game? What's with the game like levels and stats?</br></br>  <br> is it a game? <br>I think it is. Or at least from the gods' point of view.</br></br>  Chaika thread.  <br> That has to be the biggest pitfall in LNs: worthless exposition dumps. <br><br>Anime and manga as well. I cringe every time they force the dialogue just to give the viewers info.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't need what this show offers <br>so don't watch it</br></br>  <br>Technically, it is a game, if you're a God. Otherwise, it's a fantasy world with rpg elements integrated into the actual world, instead of being floating boxes</br>  <br><br>I've been thinking of starting a "Write your own WN" thread because I actually got some inspiration in another thread a while back after writing a post with a typical reincarnation isekai beginning.<br><br>The thing is, though, that I loathe this place and I have no idea why I come here except for the freedom and anonymity to call you cunts cunts, so now I'm hesitant to actually take the snippets I wrote and put it somewhere else where it might be actually tracked back to me through my seven skellington armies. I don't want people to know I come here, even if it's just to feel disgusted at you all. They might think I'm a pedo.<br><br>Long story short, I hate you all, but I might want to write a story here, wat do?<br><br> Of course the rational answer is turn 360 degrees and walk away, but 60% of you agree with everything I said above and I am a dumb fuck for thinking I might actually salvage something from here. Pic related, I might be an idiot. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tell me about it. I are interested. </br>  <br>If you bring it to /tg/ under the guise of worldbuilding, you might get some pretty good mileage.</br>  <br>Use a proxy to upload it to pastebin or a similar site.

One more animoo themed thread won't look out of place.</br>  <br>They suck, that's what's wrong with them. There isn't a single good LN, they all inevitably fail to deliver as literature and as comics. It's like someone decided genre fiction needed a medium of its own.</br>  <br>Because it doesn't need anything you mentioned.<br><br>It is 100% moe pandering.</br></br></br>  <br>Not only that, it's BAD genre fiction. Say what you will about American scifi and fantasy authors, the average quality level fucking curbstomps LNs.</br>  <br> I am a dumb fuck for thinking I might actually salvage something from here. <br>Then I must be the dumbest fuck of them all.<br> Virtual Sky Lanterns, Dualists, Sensebound Lenses, Skillweaver, and Storied Tenement are all being written as we speak. </br></br></br>  <br> Then I must be the dumbest fuck of them all. <br><br>I think we all might be. We all are the dumbest fuck of them all. The dumbest.<br><br> Carry on and don't give up. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True.</br>  <br>We've been through this a couple of times now, and the answer is always the same; some writers are hacks.</br>  <br> There isn't a single good LN, they all inevitably fail to deliver as literature and as comics. <br>Yeah, they're all complete trash.</br></br>  <br><br>the anime is really bad are you kidding me?<br><br><br><br> Ben-to <br> Chaika <br> Inou Battle </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Hi I'm a dumb EOP who pass his time reading shit translation of bad LNs, my opinion is so important and a fact </br></br>  <br> the anime is really bad are you kidding me? <br>Quite a majority of /a/ would disagree with you.</br></br>  Light Novels are by definition shit aside from 5 or 6 exceptions. Light Novel writers are hacks that just follow the same template established by their editors. They're simple yet effective entertainment for the otaku masses.  <br>Hayao Miyazaki is right.</br>  <br> Hayao Miyazaki is right. <br><br>An industry dominated by people who are sexually excited by child and incest create stuff that turns out to creatively incestuous and childish. Sounds about right.</br></br></br>  <br>They all suck pretty badly.</br>  <br> it has been 3 years since the anime.  <br>I'm getting old.<br><br>I think I'll make a fairy 3d model, when I have time</br></br></br></br>  I want to anally inseminate the Chaikas until they get pregnant.  <br>I've read stuff where girls are first penetrated anally and then the dick pushes through into the womb in a very bloody fashion, but I'm not aware of any such Chaika doujins.</br>   EOP talk shit about untranslated LN <br>topkek</br>  <br>They're just awful writers that don't know to write character progression without numbers thrown around everywhere. I can count the number of LN/manga I've read that have done this and not have it be completely immersion breaking on one hand.</br>  Best Chaika doujin  <br> the average quality level fucking curbstomps LNs <br>Completely wrong. There's just more material available in English so it's easier for you when you google "best scifi novels".</br></br>  <br>plus the fan translated LNs are google translator tier</br>  I appears that you're not on the front page anymore, Chaika.<br>Let's fix that.</br>  Slayers was a fantasy LN, and it's one of the best western fantasies period.<br><br>Of course, it has only one word as the title so modern LN writers would have a fucking heart-attack. It also has an MC who is both a girl and a native to the fantasy world instead of some japanese school-boy who slipped on some panties and fell into a wormhole.</br></br>  <br>Yet as much as Lina Inverse should appeal to me, I could never get into the series proper at all. The movie was okay in its own right though.</br>  <br>There are plenty of fantasy LN and manga that aren't based on MMOs, but apparently you'd rather complain about things you don't like than go read things you do.</br>  <br> the anime is really bad <br>So you're judging the quality of a book based on its adaptation? Why do you even expect anyone to take your opinion seriously.</br></br>  <br>Maybe you're just a pleb.</br>  <br>A shame most of the ones that get anime are Dragon Quest rip-offs/parodies.</br>  <br>The saddest thing is that the actual Dragon Quest games are better written than those novels. Not to mention the Dragon Quest manga and novelizations who are even better.</br>  <br>S2 never</br>  Who gets do decide on all those shortened names like OreImo, DanMachi, OregaIru etc.?  <br>These Jap writers have been so engulfed by video game terminology that they genuinely don't know how to express these basic human concepts like strength, health, and mental status in a non-numerical manner.</br>  <br>The Japs, of course.</br>  <br>And some of them actually have the balls to ask for money in compensation of their "work".</br>  Danmachi is a challenging story.<br>No challenge, no success.<br>By the way, are you absolutely certain this world is not an MMORPG?</br></br>  <br>What's worse is that people actually give them money.</br>  <br>Watashi is still best girl even after all these years.</br>  <br>Welcome to the internet, where dumbfucks are easily duped to give e-beggars money.</br>  <br>It would be easy to peg me as such if I were one of those types who refuses to watch anything that aired before 2010.</br>  <br><br><br>If people are willing to give money to people like Sarkeesian or Noah Antwiler, then yeah you really shouldn't be surprised.</br></br></br>  <br>We should ask the other question then. Why are there people out there eating their shit gleefully?</br>  <br> Sarkeesian <br><br>Someone should pretend to be a feminist and troll the fuck out of those translation sites. They have lots of "problematic" content after all.</br></br></br>  <br>That's like asking why people happily eat shitty fast food like McDonald's and Taco Bell despite doctors saying that crap can kill you.</br>            Seriouslyguys add something nonpopular  <br>Those lips, HNNNNNGH. Those seductive eyes.</br>  Why does the deer have a massive asscheek?      <br>Post the better version.</br>  <br><br>dat ass</br></br>  <br>This?</br>    <br> Bipolar Junction Transistor <br> Unown F <br><br>My sides.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's wearing a diaper.</br>    Which Gatchaman would you Gatcha, /a/?  <br>Hajime-ssu, every time.</br>  <br>The one that provides me with endless fap fodder</br>  Is there still no subs for Insight ep 0?  <br> Katze just grabbing Hajime's boobs </br>  <br>I choose to believe that Katze is literally inhabiting Hajime's boobs.</br>  <br>No. Unless you want some spanish one. It's not something I'd worry about though. The dialogue isn't very heavy, so it's not too difficult to pick up on the plot by watching and listening carefully.</br>  <br>New duos are:<br><br> Hajime + New girl <br> Rui + O.D <br> Sugane + Joe <br> Usutsu + Paiman <br><br>I still find it absolutely disgusting that they would separate Usutsu from her parental figure, they should have just paired Rui with Paiman. I am glad Sugane gets to partner up with his role model, since Joe was the reason he become a Gatchaman and his character development with Hajime is pretty much done.<br><br>Hajime and Rui seem to have been partners for a year between S1 and S2. They seem to be really in sync in episode 0 so I wish we could have gotten to see them fighting together more</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Rui's going to be busy with the Orange dude for maximum fujobait.<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  O.D is best bird  I forgot this was coming out, I loved the first season.  <br>Cthuko are working on it, but they usually take a really long time to release stuff, I doubt it will be released before ep 1 comes out</br>  I fear this new girl will end up with Rui because of her color scheme.  Can't wait for more threads  I just want to see Hajime's huge tits. That is the sole reason I will watch. We got almost no fanservice of her in S1. This will be the year.  <br>and that booty</br>  <br>What? That doesn't make much sense</br>  <br>what are you talking about</br>  <br>Hajime a shit. A shiiiiiiit.</br>    <br><br><br>silver = black<br>yellow = green</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course. How did I not see that.</br>  Which is the best OST and why is it Crowds?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7<wbr>HhIPe6gA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>This one first, last and forever.</br>  <br>I'll be mad as fuck if some new slut just fucks my trapfu.</br>  <br>The only person I see him possibly with is Hajime.<br><br>And even then, this show was never about romance to begin with. The new guy and the new girl have their hair and eye colors switched if you want to get technical color schemes</br></br></br>  <br>New guy has something against Crowds and Rui and he barely appears in merch. He's midboss before he gets befriended.</br>  the best.   "That’s right. Until now, Rui-kun has also lived alone, so this is probably strange for him, too. So neither of us really know what to talk about. First, we ended up talking about my katana. He asked me, “Is it okay if I hold it?” I showed him the proper way to hold it, and we ended up talking about the appeal of katanas. Rui-kun listened to me talk a while, and then said “It’s cute,” while looking at the katana." <br><br>just like my doujins.</br></br>  <br>Did you mean: before he joins Rui's harem?</br>  <br>someone has to torment and molest rui now katze is kept away in hajime.<br><br>i foresee doujins of rui getting fucked against his new car by this redhead.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does every Rui doujin consist of rape? Not that I'm complaining though, I'm just curious.</br>  <br>He was 80% of Gatchaman fanservice last season.</br>  <br>Can't wait. I hope this guy is still active.</br>  Is Katze touching Hajime's boobs?  <br/>  <br>They haven't forgotten.</br>  <br>Oh, I know, I meant that artist!</br>  I keep wondering what the deal with Katze is going to be this season. It seems like at some point he's going to get out of Hajime's boobs because art showed him alongside his suit. But is he still going to be tied to Hajime and forced to work with the other Gatchas?  The abundance of Gatcha threads lately has been great :&gt;  <br>He'll be Rui's new Gatcha partner. They fought side by side last episode, when he briefly took over Hajime had a "back to back" moment with Rui.</br>  I wonder if we'll see Hajime be affected by Katze. I didn't think we'd ever see her anything less than 100% genki, yet I recently saw the DC and she did look a bit sad when she was thinking about what she had to do to stop BK.<br><br>Also, has there always been this much Sugane/Rui stuff? Is it just a result of Sugane's note?</br></br>  <br>Rui was his love interest in the draft, probably because of that too.</br>  <br>What is this mysterious draft I always see people talking about in these threads?</br>  <br>The original idea of the show was called Crowds. There was no connections to Gatchaman, Gatchaman idea was thrown in later when they asked a Gatchaman show.<br><br>Sugane was the mc, Paiman was a mascot like character. There was no Hajime, JJ or Katze (JJ and Katze were a single character called Oskar/Oscar). Rui was a girl. Utsutsu and OD had a slight personality change too, Joe was largely the same.</br></br></br>  <br>Gatchaman connection was shoehorned into another show. Hajime was late in the game too.</br>  <br>Very interesting. I was a little late to the party and only picked up Crowds a few months ago but it's really become a personal favorite and I've been watching the older Gatchaman too. Is there a link to the original concept work and stuff that I can look at?</br>  <br>Joe, because I'm not gay</br>  <br>Don't cut yourself on that  good taste </br>  <br>I'm really glad they changed it.</br>  <br>All of them except the whore.</br>  <br>Post the right one pls</br>  <br>I would but I don't have any pictures of the Crowds version because I'm not gay.
