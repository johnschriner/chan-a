I'll start.        Did you... want what's depicted in the second image?  Isn't what you ended up getting infinitely better?       Did someone call for Captain Broken?   Shirou's projections once you realize he downloads the experience of the people who've used the weapon.   You know, Prince of Tennis is the exact same deal.    Gilgamesh was the only hero he could defeat.  ...maybe True Assassin.      Remember how the dinosaurs went extinct because of tennis?    He takes on several servants throughout the story, and that's not too shabby considering he's a high school kid.   Can somebody tell me what the fuck Emperor Eye is supposed to be?  Is it this? It's this, isn't it?      He takes on several servants throughout the story  Name them.     Archer, Gilgamesh, Berserker (Heaven's Feel), Saber (Heaven's Feel).  They all come with asterisks when facing them, but that's still pretty good considering he's still basically a kid.      OK so you know how in a video game or a sport you can predict what the opponent will do in certain situations? It's like that but with greater accuracy.    When are we getting broken anime Rugby?     implying Japan knows what rugby is     No, that's Kise's Emperor Eye and Perfect Copy.  Yes, it's as retarded as it sounds.      Are you being serious?    No, I wanted the gay. I am Makotosexual.     O-Oh...    Small Head Powers.   Reverse steroids, maybe?      Why the fuck would anyone want shitty magic basketball instead of delicious gay?  Do you think everyone is a 15 year old straight boy?       S-Sorry. ;_;     Yes. Yes, but basketball.    I can't wait for the whole shit to go world level and Nippon got curbstomped by far more powerful super techniques from the world players   The real problem with Japan in sports manga is that they fucking suck at every sport except baseball.   Volleyball is gold though, no lasers or shit    I lost interest in it after the Japanese championship. Up to that point it at least had the appearance of following a coherent story. Afterwards it was basically just superpowers upon superpowers and inflationary powerlevels to an extent that was simply tiresome.     Federer curbstomps Japanese players with his Galaxy Shuriken and Russian Nest Doll Mech   Nadal on Clay allows him to become a Million Nadals      They can be pretty good at swimming, not so much at the moment     Comparing exaggerating a spike in volleyball to fucking intergalactic lazers     Yeah, volleyball got the short end of the superpower stick.    What they hell? I remember watching this show as kid where everything had normal proportion. This is so messed up that even Titans from SNK have more realistic proportions.    You can see the super-speed spike in international competitions.    Judging the concept of creation Hypothesizing the basic structure Duplicating the composition material Imitating the skill of its making  Sympathizing with the experience of its growth   Reproducing the accumulated years  Excelling every manufacturing process          They're great at ski jumping for some reason.     watching this show  Yeah, obviously. Of course an anime would fix the bad drawing skills of the mangaka. The manga was infamous for its weird proportions. Have you never even seen that group photo?        At least Karasuno fucking actively trains all the time and you can see them improving. Seiren just becomes "lol perfect team direct drive zone" because Akashi's bullshit was getting out of hand. On the other hand, you can see Karasuno developing into a goddamn team. It's like Diamond no Ace in that regard. You actually care about the growth of the team and characters.  When Sawamura got the yips, I teared up a little bit.       There are like 12 people who ski jump. It's not especially hard to get to the top of that. I've met a top 200 jumper because I've been in a place with snow.  Japan has really good fighting game players cause of arcades. A second volume of manga about one of the top players was announced today. He doesn't have any bs superpowers besides occasional mind-reading     Instant transmission.  Bullshit power that Goku never uses to great effect because it would be "cowardly" to teleport from behind your opponent and kill them that way.     And the one manga about ski jumping I liked got cancelled.  Thanks elevens.       Not really. Goku doesn't use it for battle because it wasn't super applicable against his opponents after he learned it.     As kids they have normal head proportions. The problem is that their bodies grew but their heads didn't.  Even up until marriage.       Not really. Goku doesn't use it for battle  Expect for Cell, amirite?   because it wasn't super applicable against his opponents after he learned it.   It's always super-applicable. Just go to any power level thread and you'd have some retard saying he uses it all the time in battle to defeat any number of overpowered opponents.         That what always bothers me about sport anime/manga. If that is the level of highschool player, pro level must be something surreal.     we already got Eyeshield   Is there any better sport manga than Real?    Expect for Cell, amirite?   He uses it once against Cell and then stops because he expended so much ki on his Kamehameha that he's exhausted. He proceeds to give up afterwards and volunteer Gohan to fight. Who else would he use it against? The Androids/Cyborgs? No Ki signature to lock on to. Buu? Irrelevant, he'd just reform fucking immediately. It's not a practical battle technique against the enemies he ended up fighting.      Slam Dunk    Have you met Ricardo Martinez?     I've met a top 200 jumper  That doesn't mean shit. Laws of probability dictate that so long as you're among people sooner or later something like that is bound to happen. In fact, the top 200 of ski jumping has just as many members as the top 200 of any other sport: 200.        But Ippo isn't in high school.     I don't really mind bullshit powers in sports. At best they can make things pretty interesting, at worst it's at least entertaining as hell.  Realistic sports is good too though. Best genre all around.       Teleportation to cover distance at the speed of thought   not useful   By that logic, any claim that Goku could teleport inside Toppa Tengen Gurren Lagann to destroy Simoun inside the cockpit is utter bullshit.       Not even remotely my point.    pro level must be something surreal   That's the point I'm making. That's what I'm replying to.        Ippo was in high school when Takamura met him and he destroyed a heavybag once.    What would Buu absorb if Goku teleported him to a distant galaxy with no life in it then teleported back?  Checkmate, autists.       Again, it was not useful as a BATTLE TECHNIQUE for Goku because the opponents he fought after he learned it either   A: Had no Ki signature   or  B: Had ridiculous amount of regenerative abilities.  So the notion he didn't use it because it was cowardly is just outright not true.   By that logic, any claim that Goku could teleport inside Toppa Tengen Gurren Lagann to destroy Simoun inside the cockpit is utter bullshit.   He couldn't. There is a limit. TTGL is a mass of energy that is light years tall. Goku couldn't even use Instant Transmission to go to New Namek because it was too far.                  He'd just teleport or fly back. He doesn't need to breath. Besides, the Dragonball universe has only 4 galaxies.     There's so many dumbfucks on this website that it's safe to assume that he is.    Well, there's tennis now as well even if it's only one.     teleported him to a distant galaxy with no life in it  That's not how instant transmission works.      Again, it was not useful as a BATTLE TECHNIQUE for Goku   Bullshit. He has used it numerous times as a battle technique and even Kid Buu used it too, like the Instant Transmission Kamehameha or Teleporting Vanishing Ball.      Instant Transmission allows Goku and anyone that is in physical contact with him to instantly travel great distances (from meters to light-years, between the living world and Other World, or even travel outside time itself) just by concentrating on a particular individual's ki signature, and transmitting or feeling that being's location.  Yes, that's how Instant Transmission works and he should've used it before Buu absorbs anything dangerous, like his own sons.       on a particular individual's ki signature  In a galaxy with no life inside there is no individual to lock onto. I'm not sure what you're smoking.       He has used it numerous times as a battle technique   Like that one time he used it against Cell and... never again. Every time Goku used Instant Transmission, it was for transportation purposes. Getting Dende, locating Fat Buu, trying to escape Kid Buu, coming back to Earth, searching for Vegeta after Super Buu, etc.   and even Kid Buu used it too, like the Instant Transmission Kamehameha or Teleporting Vanishing Ball.   Literally filler and video games. Ignoring Kid Buu was used the Supreme Kai's teleport because it's better in every aspect.           Yes, that's how Instant Transmission works and he should've used it before Buu absorbs anything dangerous, like his own sons.   You mean when he was dead and could not go to earth? I don't see how Instant Transmission would have helped Gohan being a fuck-up and getting absorbed.       In a galaxy with no life inside there is no individual to lock onto.  He doesn't need to lock into a signature, he needs the ki signature of the person he needs to transfer.      Gotenks gets absorbed because Gohan   Gohan gets absorbed because Gohan   somehow IM would have stopped that       But he does. Show me a canon example of him traveling around with no living target.     He doesn't need to lock into a signature   Yes he does. This is exactly why he couldn't find New Namek, why he couldn't find the Androids, and why the Supreme Kai had to bail him out of Kid Buu blowing up earth.       I remember an hilarious thread about top american players in the basugay world that depict just that kind of surreal.      Like that one time he used it against Cell and... never again.  He used it in his fight against Kid Buu though.        Show me a canon example of him traveling around with no living target.  see   between the living world and Other World,        He didn't. Read the manga. The Kid Buu battle lasts a couple chapters of them and it consists of them jerking each other off, and Vegeta's reflection, before Vegeta interferes and Goku tries to recharge his energy. He doesn't use IM at all.     Would that even work? Helicopters create strong winds. I'm pretty sure that any arrow not coming from straight above would completely miss the target.      Nadal on Clay allows him to become a Million Nadals     His targets have always had a ki signature, dead or otherwise. But you're right, I didn't phrase that perfectly.      The Kid Buu battle lasts a couple chapters of them and it consists of them jerking each other off,  Stop reading Dragon Ball Z yaoi hentai and mistaking it for canon.      between the living world and Other World   You mean when he locks on to the Ki signature of Supreme Kai/Gohan?      So Goku instant-transmits Buu to a Alderaan.  The Jedi can take care of him.         living      Supreme Kai   Gohan   Dead   Please stop shitposting.        can cut dimensions   still loses a lot and was too weak to participate in the last arc     Link please     too weak   He was, at least, going to try before being talked out of it to instead focus on his studies.        Is this show any good The titty manager piqued my interest     He couldn't even last against Sensui, and he was a weak S-level.  Take note, he never trained afterwards either.      bullshit techniques   no Musou Tensei   I'm surrounded by millennials.       No one lasted against Sensui, really. Hell, even demon Yusuke might have lost if Raizen didn't interfere.      No one lasted against Sensui  Yusuke lasted against Sensui before his ancestor curbstomped him. Also, they all leveled up significantly since then.  Kuwabara did not.        watching sports shows for the manager  That's almost as stupid as watching it for the token female "love interest" of the male lead.    How different would anime be without beam spam?      Djokovich outdoes the both of them by becoming this.     The only conceivable reason for cartoons to not develop energy beams is for them to be outlawed. Now tell me, who would outlaw energy beams? Steven Hawkins?       Yusuke lasted against Sensui   Yusuke was still on the losing end and was beginning to run out of power.   Also, they all leveled up significantly since then.   Kuwabara did not.   Yes, they trained for the tournament. Kuwabara did not. That's what I was saying - before the tournament was announced, Kuwabara was going to join Yusuke but was talked out of it by his sister. So he WOULD have leveled up had he gone. I'm not saying he wouldn't have been strong or won, just that the reason for him not being in the last arc had nothing to do with his strength.           Actually, if beam spam weren't conceptualized from the beginning, we'd have more martial arts fights instead of beam tug of wars.     Yusuke was still on the losing end and was beginning to run out of power.  Not in the least, his Rei-Gan almost killed Sensui had it not missed and those punches he could take with his iron body.   Kuwabara was going to join Yusuke but was talked out of it by his sister.  Rather easily too. Don't blame him, he's not going to make it at all.         Not really. If Dragonball didn't do it, something else would have. Shit, Ki/Chi/Nen were popular in eastern stories for centuries.     It's a very obvious thing to do. You cannot see bullets, so you need to draw their path into the air. You can see punches, but making them produce some energy aura just makes them seem more powerful. Energy beams are a cheap and highly effective tool.        Not really. If Dragonball didn't do it, something else would have.  This is a theoretical world where beam spam doesn't exist. Don't give me your inevitability of beam spam shit. Alternate worlds don't work that way.      Even if it did hit. The armor plates of modern attack helicopters could actually hold up against several hits from 23mm cannon before failing. Normal arrows wouldn't even leave a scratch.  It's magic arrow or some bullshit like that.          Not in the least, his Rei-Gan almost killed Sensui had it not missed    Which was filler.   and those punches he could take with his iron body.   True.   Rather easily too. Don't blame him, he's not going to make it at all.   I'm not blaming anyone. Just that he was perfectly willing to go and participate, even if he was convinced otherwise. He would have lost, definitely, but his not participating isn't like he was left out deliberately out of weakness when he actually has a really good ability and the potential to grow stronger. Then again, the Three Kings saga being like a dozen chapters was basically Togashi getting fed up with Jump so who fucking knows.               You cannot see bullets, so you need to draw their path into the air.   You can see punches, but making them produce some energy aura just makes them seem more powerful.   Plenty of anime before Dragon Ball Z (or some other anime that popularized beams... maybe Gundam, maybe Yamato...) did things without beam spam, Sonny Boy.        I'm not blaming anyone. Just that he was perfectly willing to go and participate, even if he was convinced otherwise.   He was too weak, Kuwabara Defense Force. Stop shitting up the thread by being butthurt about how your favorite character sucks.      PoT is still being published?    I still don't see how Haikyuu belongs in this image.    That was an early and rough stage of anime when they were still developing their tools and finding out what they could do. In the webm you posted, they tried to use the surroundings for effect, and it looks cool, but sooner or later somebody had to come up with the idea of simple beams.     I doubt anyone of these moepigs even recognizes that series.     wut. I'm saying the reason he stayed behind is because he was convinced to. Literally nothing about his talk has anything to do with him being too weak to participate. I'm not even a fan of Kuwabara. You're just deliberately ignoring things just to cause an argument.      And you forgot to add that their bows seem to have more attack range than helicopters.      That was an early and rough stage of anime when they were still developing their tools and finding out what they could do.   I don't know what you're arguing about. All I'm saying is that it's not "impossible" to imagine anime without beam spam.       wut. I'm saying the reason he stayed behind is because he was convinced to   If you're not a fan of Kuwabara, you wouldn't be this asspained about him easily being convinced not to participate because he sucks dick so hard when fighting.      That gif is basically fist beams, made to look more fancy with stars in the JoJo part.     fist beams   You're grasping at straws at this point. Again, what are you arguing about? That it's impossible to imagine anime without beam spam?       You're grasping at straws at this point.  You are completely missing the point, which is that these kind of things naturally evolve into beams. Your gif is halfway there. Making something fast all blurry and at some point turning it into an unrecognizable beam is a rather natural development.   That it's impossible to imagine anime without beam spam?  No, I said that it would require an outside force (a law) to stop beams from happening. Please pay attention.          I said he was convinced not to participate, just that the entire reasoning his sister used had nothing to do with him being too weak. Which is true. Him being with Yusuke was never a matter of their strengths; if it were, he wouldn't have gone on literally every other adventure with him. Their relationship is not that shallow. Am I not allowed to assert a point I think is wrong without being asspained? Besides, I prefer Hiei.      which is that these kind of things naturally evolve into beams  And this has anything to do with imagining a world without beams how?    it would require an outside force (a law) to stop beams from happening   There was no law when beams didn't exist. There's no need for any retarded law.          I said he was convinced not to participate  Because he's too weak, KDF.      Him being with Yusuke was never a matter of their strengths  Actually it is. Wasn't he asspained because he kept getting beat up by Yusuke, so in turn he kept getting revenge?      Making something fast all blurry and at some point turning it into an unrecognizable beam is a rather natural development.   fast and blurry &lt;&gt; beam  They're mutually exclusive terms.           it would require an outside force (a law) to stop beams from happening   Beams already didn't exist before they were conceptualized. There's no need for outside forces to keep beams from anime.  That's just retarded.         entire debate he has with sister and father has absolutely nothing with his strength, but having a good future with Yukina   If I were a fish, I would be on shore by now.       Oh boy, somebody got mad.     His sister was afraid he'd die. Of course it was about strength, KDF.     Up until Yusuke died and they became friends.      Anybody read "Tough" by Tetsuya Saruwatari?  I actually enjoy the first part. Kōkō Tekken-den. Even if the plot is getting ridiculous sometimes it's still based on real life martial arts.   But I kind of stopped reading at part 2 when the fighters start projecting some sort of "KI" power at each others.       Took you long enough to post taht    So you concede from the start it was about strength.      Both of you need to shut the fuck up. Neither of those things happened at all.        There's no need for any retarded law.  So we're in a situation where beams simply happen because they're an obvious tool, just like speed lines are an obvious tool to create the illusion of speed. But let's say anime makers are just that stupid, that they didn't think of this, then you'd get some high-budget productions with good animations and background stuff like in  to underline the power that is being unleashed, and other anime that are simply boring to watch. By the way: you can outlaw things even after they've become a thing. Think before you post, will you?    fast and blurry &lt;&gt; beam  What are you trying to say. That something that is not something else cannot "turn" into that other thing? Or are you just trying to demonstrate that you are truly not thinking?   this has anything to do with imagining a world without beams how?  The reason for the lack of beams decides on how people deal with it. If it's just an outlawing of literal beams, then they'd find stuff that works in a similar way, but is not literally beams.                Kick some ass in Gai Tech's High School   Because we know you won't do any of that in the Demon World.       So we're in a situation where beams simply happen because they're an obvious tool,   They didn't always exist though, so it's imaginable to have a world without them.      Right, and color wasn't there from the beginning either. Let's imagine a world where anime simply forgets to upgrade to color.      The reason for the lack of beams decides on how people deal with it. If it's just an outlawing of literal beams,   beams need outlawing   Stop trying to make that a thing. It's never going to be a thing.        That was an early and rough stage of anime when they were still developing their budget-saving tools  Fix'd.      This is before anyone knew what was happening in the demon world, about the three kings, and S-class demons. Both of you are wrong.      By the way: you can outlaw things even after they've become a thing.  Why the fuck would you need to outlaw nonexistent things, you retarded piece of fuck?     Inazuma's soccer is on another league of its own though...  InaEle had dinosaurs playing soccer before PoT caused their extinction.      Bottom line, Kuwabara sucks and faded to irrelevance because he's a weakling who couldn't hang with the big boys.     implying beam spam is something that must inevitably happen in anime   Shiggy Diggy.      You really should stop it with the "outlaw beam spam" meme you're trying to force, anon.     Bottom line, everyone faded into fucking irrelevance because the manga ended 10 or so chapters later so everyone should shut the fuck up about shit they haven't read.     Tell me, do you really think anybody is fooled by your weak attempt at samefagging? I'm going to stop replying now because you don't seem to actually want to argue anymore.      anime that are simply boring to watch.   liking beam spam   Disgusting millennial.        Bottom line, everyone faded into fucking irrelevance  Not really. Yusuke is still inheritor of Raizen's kingdom and at a young age went toe to toe against a conqueror-class demon that's centuries old.  Hardly irrelevant.       Right but the odds of a given member of a group being part of the top are comparatively much higher. I know many basketball players but nobody remotely close to NBA status. I've met one ski jumper, that person was above a certain rank.    Anon, we all know you're the outlaw beam spam guy. and we can recognize your samefagging.   I'm going to stop replying now   Ha. Bitched out like the little bitch that you are.         hardly irrelevant   He went home to open a ramen stand and marry Keikou. He pretty much left that shit behind to Enki. Raizen doesn't have a kingdom anymore. It was dissolved.     Captain Tsubasa got boring when it started to take itself too seriously.    He went home to open a ramen stand and marry Keikou.  He also helped established a three-year rule among demons, and as a half-demon he'll probably live centuries longer than Keiko anyway, so he has plenty of time to go Raizen levels of overpowered.      I've met one ski jumper, that person was above a certain rank.  Let's turn that sentence around.  I've met one person above a certain rank and he happened to be a ski jumper.  Suddenly it no longer looks like there's only a handful of ski-jumpers.  Again, probability says that in your life you're probably going to run into a few top 200s.          I'm going to stop replying now  Sick of getting BTFO, beam spam anon?      That pic  Okay so an odd question, but can anybody remember an instance in anime where a character has said something along the lines of "a sword's just a sharp piece of metal with a pointy end. None of that 'it's my second soul' magic bullshit, you just make sure you stab the other guy before he stabs you"?      Yusuke isn't a half-demon, but the rest are fair points.      Yusuke isn't a half-demon   he was born a human   his demon half revived him   He's a half-demon. How is he not one?         Because genealogy doesn't work like that. He just has You-ki.    kurokos evolution is just great  oh this guy can copy moves? i guess he is just talented   100% accuracy even from halfway across the court? hmm okay i guess, its anime after all   jump very high, ok easy   aomine can do everything. at least it looks cool   purple guy is just tall   akashi can literally see the future and force everyone around him in the zone and suddenly the zone is the same for everyone with the stupid water and the 2nd door          No, he transformed into a demon. That's pretty much clear in the manga.  The human that has youki is Kurama, not Yusuke, and even Kurama can transform into a demon.     Slam Dunk is the undisputed king of sports manga    Akashi drawing out everyone's latent abilities makes sense conceptually because he's a PG. Point Guards are the playmakers of the team. Everything else, yeah.     At least there's no beam spam.      folded a thousand time     Don't forget Akashi being literally insane, Kuroko overwriting Mayuzumi, and everyone having telepathy.    If they're so overpowered, why didn't they just revive those who've died Dragonball style?  inb4 muh spiral nemesis      That's literally the reason. Simon didn't want to be selfish because people would inevitably follow his example.     Did you even watch the fucking show?      Do the impossible, break the unbreakable, row row, fight the power       For Part 1, that's applicable. Not so much for Part 2 where the moral was doing shit like that causes trouble and death for everyone that isn't you.      For Part 1, that's applicable.  What kind of broken-ass storytelling is this when the main theme it's only applicable to part of the story?    I liked the early part of Mazinger where it was piratically invincible because of its alloy.  Not much of a fight when none of your opponents can hurt you.     I'm guessing that you're not very well read? Having the central theme evolve over the course of the story is like storytelling 101.      Having the central theme evolve over the course of the story is like storytelling 101.  They were blaring out that theme even when they were facing the anti-spirals.  Then suddenly, can't revive people because reasons.       The sport is not broken, but the character is     They were blaring out that theme even when they were facing the anti-spirals.   And people kept fucking dying because of it. Including people who had absolutely nothing to do with what they were doing. Hell, if the battle didn't take outside of the universe, the spiral nemesis would have happened.       And people kept fucking dying because of it.  Except the part when Kamina was revived?  Or the part where bad writing made the girl into the vessel for the anti-spirals?        suddenly   entire theme of anti-spiral arc is that they're too out of control and just doing whatever the fuck they want   get shown out of control multiple times   get option to go out of control   choose not to go out of control   Yeah. Suddenly.           Except the part when Kamina was revived?   You mean no part? Did you forget the entire reason Simon was imprisoned was because he went off to fight the Anti-Spiral without being concerned what would happen?  And it ended up having Kamina City destroyed and innocent people dying?         entire theme of anti-spiral arc is that they're too out of control and just doing whatever the fuck they want   they prove that and defeat anti-spirals through out of control means   but then suddenly stop   Yeah, doesn't make much sense.         You mean no part?      That's not Kamina. It's called a homage. Did you even watch the movie?     You're not seriously trying to pass off STTGL as literally Kamina are you?    You seriously thought that was literally Kamina?   sup    you're out of control!   we are not!   yes you are! you're killing the universe!   oh shit we are!   die!   no we don't want to die!   okay protect the universe!   okay!   simon, want to go out of control?   nah   I just think you're dumb. Anyone with a brain could understand Simon was fine with letting nature run its course to set an example to not abuse power for selfish reasons. 2/10 bait.                you're dumb.   2/10 bait  Not him, but make up your mind.       At this point, even accidental bait is still bait.    Martial arts are a sport too, right?    I remember when this manga was about sex. What happened?     At least the volleyball one is realistic.    It's fun. It gets ridiculous at times, but it's fun.    Slapstick humor and pantyshot took the spotlight.     they're killing the universe   they then killed the only thing keeping them in check   this is somehow a good idea      Literally anything this guy does    Simon is now the thing that keeps everyone in check, which is why he's hoboing it up instead of being in a leadership position.       Look at all that backpedaling.       backpedaling on something that's factually correct   proving further you didn't watch the movie   anon pls. it's over        Kamina isn't revived   Oh look, there's Kamina   Hurr durr that's not Kamina        It's not Kamina. It's Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. There's even a subtle. Anon PLS.     Everybody in Captain Tsubasa is from the Longleg Tribe      Man, I thought you were going to bring up lotus eater machine. not STTGL. apply your bait a little better       It's not Kamina   it's a gigantic Kamina that's not Kamina I swear guise       It's not a giant Kamina. It's a giant Simon. Watch the movie.     ATATATATATATATATATATATA    Quit biting.     Can't help it.     Musou Tensei is just a copypcat technique because Kenshiro is super sad.  Not as bullshit as all the other techniques here.      Yeah that's a much better power thematically than Emperor's Eye.    Only real answer.   Why does everyone have to have a _______ Eye Ability in Kuroko no Basugay?  Whatever happened to Sakuragi and his high rebound jumps or Rukawa and his Jordan-like play?      The only people who have eye related abilities are Akashi and Kise.     You forgot the Hawk Eye ability of Takao.     No.      Sorry. I was only remembering abilities that mattered.     I accept that you conceded you made a mistake and put your foot in your mouth.    Kuroko's ability revolves around eyes too    Real is too overdramatic to match the hi-jinks of Slam Dunk though.  Plus Slam Dunk actually has more of a cultural impact in Japan.      FujOda.     I did. It literally did not click because of how minor Takao is in the grand scheme. If you really wanted to hit me, you should have mentioned Iduki.     Slam Dunk was actually making fun of shonen tropes by having Sakuragi name all his mundane moves or that Skull Dunk thing.     Kuroko's ability resolves around using his entire body for misdirection, not just his eyes.       If you really wanted to hit me, you should have mentioned Iduki.   You're so wrong, you're even correcting yourself as you passive-aggressively admit you're wrong.       I didn't passively aggressively admit I was wrong. I outright admitted I was wrong.     Give it up. The more you struggle the more you slip into the pit.    While saying that Takao didn't matter anyway or saying I should've mentioned Iduki.  You are a special kind of buttflustered.      Zone could be considered an eye ability too. So Midorima is the only Kiseki who doesn't have an eye-related ability.     Not him. I think you're the butthurt one.   ITT:    The fuck are you talking about? Kuroko has to use his entire body for misdirection. That was the entire reason he started losing his misdirection, the point of Misdirection overflow, and the trick to Vanishing Drive.     Not him, but how is he butthurt when he's just there correcting him?     Zone isn't an eye related ability, though. It's just represented in the eyes because it's easy for everyone to see.      Kuroko has to use his entire body for misdirection.  Including his eyes.     If you're going to use that logic then Emperor Eye isn't strictly speaking an eye ability because it's more of a predicting ability.    The conversation went long past correcting the other guy. When the other guy admitted defeat that should have been the end of that, but keeping it alive just to insist that the other guy lost is a sign that there is some emotional load that he can't rid himself of.      I SAID his eyes.   Kuroko's ability resolves around using his entire body for misdirection, NOT JUST HIS EYES.   Learn to read. If it revolved around his eyes, Mayuzumi wouldn't have gotten his has torn open.         see      I SAID his eyes.  So in a manner of speaking, it's an eye ability.      What? Far from. The ability of Emperor Eye comes inherently from the eyes to predict the future. Zone is using 100% of your physical abilities. It's hardly the same.    Is it just one guy using /a/-unrelated reaction images in this thread? It's kind of bothering me.    Yes but how the fuck does he make people stumble and fall over?     When the other guy admitted defeat that should have been the end of that   other guy   Dude, we all know it's you.        Plus Slam Dunk actually has more of a cultural impact in Japan.  meh  popularity =/= quality        If that's the case, every ability involving the body is an eye ability. So every ability is an eye ability.     I don't even read Basugay.    see  It's a predictive ability rather than an eye ability. The eye moniker is a misnomer.      I neither read nor watched every explanation of Akashi's ankle breaking where every player has telepathy     Not if the eyes aren't involved.  Like when the Aomine defeated the Vanishing Drive with his eyes closed.      Sure you don't, you're defending this anon like your life depended on it for no reason.     So literally every ability since every ability involves eyes in some way.      2 posts   like your life depended on it  Seriously, you've got some butthurt to work out. You are barely functioning.      Quality is subjective, though.  If people don't like melodrama, they won't like Real.      I don't think it has come up in the anime yet.    Not really, because eyes are a key component in Kuroko's misdirection.    Still pretending to not be him because you're that mad, huh?     Akashi does a cutback the moment a player shifts weight off his pivot foot. That's how you ankle break in real life. He can just do it with the Emperor Eye all the time because he can see the weight shift. Kuroko no Basket is not ground in reality but it's based off real things.     Yeah, still pretending to be me and not him.     Akashi does a cutback the moment a player shifts weight off his pivot foot. That's how you ankle break in real life.   Source?       He's not me. I'm me. I just stopped replying.     That's some damage control you're doing there, man.    Not him, just posted on this thread, but you're not fooling anyone.     https://<span>youtu.be/YU39vJnSrMA?t=248  [ ]     Yeah, there's definitely no post timer or anything. Fucking get over it.          One day you'll learn about post times.     cutback  Could you explain this in casual words? I don't sports.       Yeah, there's definitely no post timer or anything.   By that logic    Is the same guy by post timer.         What's with all these stupid petty arguments?   You do realize that normally there's 60 seconds to a minute, right? Not 53?     I mean source of this being something you do to break ankles in real life, you fucking retard.     Positional shift to an opposite direction. Say you're driving to the left side of a person, a cutback would be suddenly shifting your position and cutting to the right side. Or if you're going forward, a cutback would be going backward. Does that make any sense?      Too rude. Google it yourself.      22:48:22 8 minutes ago   22:49:15 7 minutes ago   Keep backpedaling.       It's a crossboarder from /tv/, going by the reaction images.     23:48:22   23:49:15  So you really don't know about post timers. Thanks for admitting.      In short, it doesn't exist and you're pulling bullshit out of your ass.     I literally cannot do basic math     How the fuck did Akashi induce it with his "Emperor Eye" that's not psychic bullshit though?    I'm not him but you need a source to prove that you can break someone's ankles using a cutback? Have you just never seen a single game of basketball or something?     Do you not watch basketball at fucking all?      Say you're driving to the left side of a person, a cutback would be suddenly shifting your position and cutting to the right side.   What does any of that have to do with Akashi making people stumble over?       It is psychic bullshit. This is a manga, first and foremost. He just cutbacks at the right time EVERY TIME to make people fall.      It's not called a cutback though. It's called cutting and faking, you fucking nerds.      This is a manga, first and foremost.  Slam Dunk would never do shit like this, though. That's no excuse.  If a manga is terrible then call it terrible and don't justify its psychic bullshit.        Because he cutbacks the moment you shift weight. You're trying to guard the dude, he goes right, you shift your weight right to stop his drive, he cuts left the moment you shift your weight, you go left and fall. Akashi, who can see the goddamn future, can do this as much as he wants - as long as he has the space.    Literally the same shit.          Akashi does a cutback the moment a player shifts weight off his pivot foot.   cut·back ˈkətˌbak/Submit noun an act or instance of reducing something, typically expenditures.  The Emperor Eye is pretty powerful if it could cut the expenditures his team.           Faggots that know nothing about sports, arguing about realism of a sport in manga and anime.     I'm just answering questions of how it works, I'm not trying to justify anything it does.      Literally the same shit.  http://www.macmillandictionary.com/<wbr>us/dictionary/american/cut-back http://www.coachesclipboard.net/Cut<wbr>tingAndFaking.html  This is what happens when nerds talk about sports.  </wbr> </wbr>     I think you're right, know the theories of basketball more than the official names since I was more of a football player myself.    Watch out, I'm gonna cutback you.  With my Emperor Eye.        Sorry. I thought it was a basketball term. It was a football term.       Because he cutbacks the moment you shift weight.   cutbacks      Don't shit yourself, lady.     The Emperor Eye is pretty powerful if it could cut the expenditures his team.   The ultimate attack!      This thread     The Emperor Eye is pretty powerful if it could cut the expenditures his team.   Considering Akashi can play a 5 player game solo then yeah. It can.      Can it kill the dinosaurs, though?    That guy in the prince of tennis movie whos serve killed the dinosaurs    not even a single sports anime next season  At least there are some leftovers from spring, even though one of them is a QUALITY fest.    A shame, but the season looks pretty good otherwise    There's one episode left and it was explained weeks ago    someone did Akashi's elbow pass in an actual match    It was already done way before knb got made.     Pretty much everything in KnB is based on something that happened in an actual game.     Ashita no Joe    Telepathy and psychic predictions happened in a game?    They're keeping it hush hush, because the military doesn't want the public to know.     No, unless you consider the intercom telepathy, and yes. I'm sure a fair share of talented players get good reads. Hell, look at Lebron and Curry in the finals. Shit was on another level. Of course, while I say a lot of things have happened in KnB, there's obviously the fantasy element of the manga and how things are super exaggerated.     Much semantics.  Cut back is used for American Handegg when the Receiver "cuts his route short" to "look back at the QB for the ball." It's been reduced to cut back. Source? Played the fucking sport, heard the term. Used in multiple sports as a fake-out term when a person "cuts back" to his original position, trying to elude the defender.  Quit the fucking digressing, you sports autist.         Much semantics.   Did you take so long to reply because you had to look up what semantics meant?   Cut back is used for American Handegg when the Receiver "cuts his route short"   That's like calling a basket in basketball a touchdown. Learn how words are used.          dictionary.com  See what cutback means there. Go on. Of course, at this rate, you're just doing some belated damage control.        missing the point of that image  That image is basically saying Haikyuu is different from the others because it's relatively realistic compared to the superpowered bullshit commonly found in sports manga.    Make way for best sport      not too shabby considering he's a high school kid   He's also on the powerlevel that makes the world consider him a candidate for a Counter Guardian, when the last person nominated was named Joan D'Arc. He's not on his top game, but the VN is always a story of him getting there.    I just really hate the fucking argument of HURR SERVANT KILLED BY A NORMAL HUMIE when Shirou is not normal by any stretch of the world             Kill yourself.    You first underaged cunt.    nice gibberish    Are those robots?     Is this magical soccer or something.     My sides followed them into orbit, what the fuck    Points scored: 0    When are they deployed in the military?    Why would the military be interested in football handling skills?   With these exaggerated teleporting, energy blasts and/or super speed being done by middle/high school students I can't help but wonder how professional teams/world leagues look like.   see <br/>    It's fucking absurd and I love it. I wish more shows were like this.     Don't worry, instead of the military they deploy children controlled mini 3DCG robots    They just believe in Saccah    To not talk about nuppose or the combination attack with Marimo.    get rekt    people freaking out about Midorimna's full court shot "BUT IS NOT REALZ!"   Midorima would actually need to step his game up because of Stephen Curry     ankle breaking in basketball is not about literally breaking ankles, you fucking retard  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cgp<wbr>pBPGBWBE</wbr>  [ ]      Kokou no Hito is my first, REAL is second.    Yes. It's a monthly series now.    Can Curry do this during almost the entire game like Midorima? No.    Fking Giorno... He can probably beat every character here.    Except DemonBANE and anyone higher than it.     having a higher accuracy percentage than NBA players   he can do consistently what are considered tirck shots for NBA players   while being guarded   Get the fuck out of here.         Jonathan's thighs     &gt;  Noone mentioned Demonbane in this thread or a omnipotent being, so Giorno is the most broken one in this thread.    see     This is kinda different from Kuroko though. These players are falling to the side and you can see the guy running past them, which makes sense. Akashi just makes them fall in PLACE first, then runs past them.     I don't see a referee or an opposing team. What are they even playing?    I'm guessing practice. Notice the lack of net.    They were playing a match and they were invaded by those robots.    And what the fuck that have to do with the psychic bullshit of Emperor Eye?  Stop trying to make Kuroko's Basket realistic, you're looking like a complete asswipe.     More Inazuma Eleven when?   I just figured everyone else left to play actual soccer, and took the remaining equipment with them. Audience followed.    It was a normal match until see  he invaded and ruined the match.  Here are more from the match itself      when Youkai Watch stops giving money to Level-5.      Only a few more years then.    Put Fran's Chaos Meteor webm please      I'm just talking about ankle breakers, not the psychic stuff/eye powers    Do you remember when she used it?    At the last moments of the movie.    And I'm talking about the Emperor Eye breaking ankles.    I don't think I understand Football anymore.    Pfft. This isn't football. Where are all the players pretending to be hurt when touched?    Here's the basic idea:  the arrows are magical   the anime fucked up with the visual design, because they act more like explosive beams or railgun shots in the manga   the helicopters aren't shooting because the pilots are vampires and killing the humans isn't their aim in the first place (since they want their blood)   the helicopters are just a distraction and the pilots won't be harmed by being in them when they're destroyed because vampire bullshit        It's finally happening. Vol. 11 is going to be released August 25, 2015.  RIKA A BEST  SEASON 3 ANNOUNCEMENT SOON?    Finally we'll be freed from this "yukimura wins" bullshit. I can't believe people actually think it'll be a permanent thing.  So Buriki is back?  Yozora is best girl.  Can Yozora still win?   Greatest Lovestory Ever Told 3 The Resurrection of the Revengence of the Electric Bogalo  I'm ready.     It's been more than two years.    I'll be happy as long as it's confirmed that Yozora won the Meatbowl.   Sena still have a chance, FAITO.. GANBAREE SENACHAN     I thought Yukimura won.     I can't wait for the massive shitposting that's going to happen when spoikers come in.  RIKKA A BEST!   I WANT TO FUCK MEAT    X GOT BTFO   UUUNNNNIIIIIIIIIVVVVEEEERRRSSSSSEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr>         You do realize it's either her or Rika?  Sena's out.      In the latest chapter, yes, but it came off pretty abruptly. It was building up the Rika ship before this happened.  Sena and Yozora absolutely no chance whatsoever.      Why is Sena out? Also Rika would make most sense since they spent time getting to know each other?   RIKA will BTFO all other ships.  True love!     I still can't believe what a retarded direction this has gone off to.   Didn't Kodaka confess to Sena?  I'm one or two volumes late, can anyone please sum up the story for me?     He likes her only for her body    he said he wanted to do lewd things to her    Your butthurt will be endless.     people still missing the point of the story so damn hard      Okay, thanks. So it was purely sexual? I thought he confessed in a romantic way and was just joking about the breasts.     Point of the story is making friends so everyone in that club should just become friends and only friends while Taka becomes romantically involved with some third party     tfw the author couldn't follow the point of the story herself  Also, fucking editors, and fuck her because she couldn't stomach it and make Sena won     In the latest volume he actually realizes the only one he loves romantically is Rika   Wait, this shit wasn't over? I've had to listen to faggots talking about how the reverse trap won for fucking ever.  I cannot wait until Yozora wins. Daily reminder that if you like Sena even remotely, you are a normalfag and disgusting.  YOZORA OR DEATH. BEST GIRL WILL WIN, FIRST GIRL ALWAYS WINS.       Could you go a bit more in depth. I haven't really kept up with this, why are Sena and Yozora definitely out?    Sena and Yoz will focus on their just realized friendship with one another. Those will be very cute developments.     They already won  each other.     Only a fag wouldn't choose her.   My bretheren.   Good, this shitty story can finally end. This is the last one right?   Hirasaka is a woman? So that's why the story tends to make the female character the butt of the jokes.    Can't wait for Yukimura to get cucked.  Between the hags and lolis.  Are collage aged idols no good?    they're all good anon   just some are gooder than others, depending on who you ask and how way their particular shit tastes developed       Which one was Laika again?     college aged idols  They're called gravure, OP.     College aged girls are the best because I am in college and I like more mature girls anyway    enjoy your std infested sluts    I'm pretty sure real idols don't go to College.    More like AV. Even lolis do gravure.      Dont spoil my dreams.     Now I want a little kitten Anyan Look at her tiny little paws        collage    There is at least Horikoshi in Tokyo which is basically a place where idols can get a normal education.      Poor slut, always getting cockblocked by her sister.  How relevant is Rin? I'm considering picking this up just for her.   She's Scamco and Japan's favorite girl, although she doesn't really have as huge a presence in the anime as you'd think aside from the first few episodes That being said she's complete garbage and there are a  Miria d of better girls to watch the show for      aside from the first few episodes  How kind of them to put the girl I'm most interested in in the beginning episodes. I guess I'll add it to my backlog then, if only for the first few episodes.     she is the worst girl, don't bother    There must be a reason Japan likes them so much though.     Oh Generic straight dark haired beauty-sama please step on me  Rin a shit     Don't listen to  Rin is great.     While Uzuki is better.  Suffering soon.       Uzuki is a cutie. I hope she doesn't suffer too much in the second course.    Neither   Momoka is the light of my life   Eh, I found Uzuki kind of boring. I prefer Rin and Mio.    Most of the girls are, which doesn't say much about Uzuki but should speak volumes about Rin It's okay though, I'll help you find a better group of Cools to root for    Daily reminder that Anya is perfect.    But I already have a cool to root for.     this webm needs sound so I can hear her voice.    Then you just made my job a lot easier     Canonically beautiful   Canonically talented   Canonically pure  Canonically perfect          I prefer Rin and Mio.   and Mio.       I want to go drinking with Kaede.   ;_;     Step it up hooker.

He will protect her smile.    How could he protect someones smile when he couldn't even protect his own?   All the CG idols are no good.   Except Miku   Kanako the best.   For some reason, the nips like talking about Miku. It's cat posting central over there.    http://imgur.com/XHTAIsO Kanako is a yokozuna.     I beg to differ    Why is Producer-San the most moe character    Generic rapeface-san    I want to play with Kaede.    Drinking games?  (You'll probably lose, you know.)     These lips have sucked dick.   Hmph; I won't lose to a girl.   I never got into this whole iM@s-thing and the girls I've seen in these threads have been kind of bland. Recently I've been seeing a lot of this Kaede girl on the front page and she looks really cute and hot. Is she a new addition to the franchise or has she been around for a while? This is a first time in a while that I actually have committed a folder for a girl I know absolutely nothing about.    She's been around for a while.     You have a good taste muh niggah. Here's some choco.    You mean, woman.    Her actor/singer is Saori Hayami, a wonderful singer. Definitely do try "Koi Kaze" and "Yuki no Hana".   Why is this thread back in /a/, I thought you guys got booted to /vg/.   There is no Cinderella Girls thread in /vg/            I want to get rape by Kaede.    My bad bruh "real woman" she is.      Cheers, bruv.      Is she telling me to sit down?    How can a character I know absolutely nothing about be so infatuating. I have absolutely no interest in idolfaggotry stuff but I almost feel compelled to get into it just because of her.    She's guessing you can't stand up straight.    I hope you like bad punsters. (You do now.)      whens the new pv    Too bad bruh cuz the anime lacks cakes. But Rin is ok; I guess.    My brother.   The best images keep her heterochromia subtle.

Why brother?; Im sure its gonna taste like cake.    So will the second cour make her suffer?    I bet he was a fucking loser in high school...    He was  genuine      ...     Does he even have hobbies?  Even 2011 Producer said he liked playing some vidya every now and then.      What TakeP is already 30?    Is that a thumbnail? http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=49258869</wbr>     Nah, thats just fan speculation.  He's probably AT MOST 30. But realistically, he's probably in his mid twenties. We're at least sure that he's older than AkaP.     Chibiki or horrible for cinderella?   Hanging out with his former boy idol bandmates? (He was the "little brother" / shota type.)    He was a fox at 22  I wonder when the first time he and Kaede hooked up.      Chibiki isn't even complete.    So he was Nozaki-kun in highschool?     I wonder when the first time he and Kaede hooked up.  Tone down the delusion, please.     The good, and bad, thing about HS is that CR's subs are usually just good enough. Not great, not terrible.  Having said that, I was getting weird errors with some of the subs. Don't know if it was because of them or something on my end.     All of my love for Kaede.   CR subs for CG fuck up their translations alot. They get things outright wrong quite a few times.  Their russian script gets corrupted into whatthefuckery too.        Didn't know being able to notice affection through their interactions meant delusion. Sorry for understanding more than you?    Chibiki are great but they're not complete. Just watch as much as you can from Chibiki and then watch HS.    Such a beatiful language    I bow down to you, master of human relationship that can translate a short greeting and eye contact into a long and winding love story.   Seriously, chill man. I'm just kidding. Didn't you see my image is basically TakeP x Kaede?       Chibiki has more accurate translations but the way they take liberty with a few things is annoying.  Case in point: Miku's retarded Meows and Kirari's general autist speak. Chibiki also tends to insert figures of speech (which are still contextually correct and fitting to the dialogue) that are admittedly jarring at times.  I like how they approached Anya though. Technically, there isn't really anything wrong with Anya's flow of spoken Japanese, but she does speak with weird intonations and accents.  The way Chibiki attempted to get this across was by making subs for Anya appear as broken english. I find it a cute touch.           Just saiyan, HS is Daisuki not CR.    Post underrated idols.   When, suddenly--   Going on onsen excursions with Kaede!   TakeP is a cyborg silly.  He was never a shota.        Two busty idols appeared       onsen      What the hell...?     Is Sachi tasty?    [x] offer her some dictation      I want Kaede to send me a pic of her.     Kaede will never try to eat you.  Unfair.     Did someone say "onsen"?    I remember AkaP being 20-21 so mid-20/late-20 would be right.    Why is this hag so popular?    There needs to be more Terminator spoofs, considering that a robot will die this Friday.    Takeuchi is surrounded by girls that much older than him in recording studio    sole main guy in the cast    Lucky bastard.      Does he have any new roles lined up yet?    You and me, together.     Hello, Operator? I think I've PENUS'd.     Hegochin is so cute.    I love huge tits, but those are too big for her. Modest handfuls are perfect.     17 year old   Also, here is him and Akabane at a recent im@s event with Kirari and some slut from ML   http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm26<wbr>112123</wbr>   Takeuchi imitates Kirari's "NYOWA HAPPY HAPPY" at 0:36 but Kirari doesn't like what she hears.          Let's not cast doubt on this pure maiden's chastity, if possible.     Between the hags and lolis.   Are collage aged idols no good?   They are no good plotwise for most anime because they are more mature thinkers. Most of the simplistic anime plots need immature behavior and bad decision making from the characters in order to carry the plot forward. Such behavior is acceptable from young cute middle school and even some teenagers. But when it occurs by college-aged characters or college graduates, it is unacceptable and UNcute. The audience would reject such characters.  So that is why college-aged and college-grads are ruled out of many plots. The audience simply expects better behavior from them and that would wreck or complicate the story design of most anime series. For example, you expect the thinking, maturity, treatment of issues, and performance level of chars in Legend of the Galactic Heroes to be substantially better than from chars in Highschool DxD or iDOLM@STER.         Please be my mom, Miyu!       17 years old   I still can't wrap my head around the fact that his natural voice is this fucking deep.  Also, Rei Matsuzaki's reaction to his NYOWA is priceless. You can practically hear "YOU THINK NYOWA-ING IS A MOTHERFUCKING GAME?" from her displeased face.       What is Nana's talent?   Being an adorable 17 year old.    Why wouldnt she?   Muh Niggah   Nice taste my brethren.          Reverse aging     I'm pretty sure real idols don't go to College.   You mean anime idols. Real life idols can and do go to college if they manage to save up enough money from their job opportunities. For example, one idol used her idol training and contacts to release a few songs (as Sexy Seniorita) and gravures. The money she made was just enough to pay for law school education. The discipline needed to be an idol in Japan is much tougher than being a college student. So she made it through college easy enough after being an idol. She is now a practicing lawyer in Japan. Not that being a defense lawyer has a lot of glamour there because the conviction rate is very high (over 90% conviction rate in court) which means defense lawyers fail almost all the time. The goal of lawyers (and defendants) is thus to avoid trial and do plea bargains ahead of time before any trial occurs.         Holy cow, those fucking daggers. She was not Happy Happy indeed.     What kind of instrument is that    Yuki da bess    I want to keep fighting tho     I wish Yuki was my big sister     Do you think Ohashi secretly squees over Takeuchi?  I mean, the guy is the textbook 3D ikemen. Or are Hegochin's Ikemen fetish strictly limited to 2D?       Takeuchi imitates Kirari's "NYOWA HAPPY HAPPY" at 0:36 but Kirari doesn't like what she hears.   He couldn't meet the quality level required from idols. So despite trying, it sounded more a mockery than a replication. That is what she was displeased about.       secretly   Probably not secretly at all.     Did she ever share/blogs about 3D ikemen? So far I only heard she plays this game, read this manga, etc, 2D only related things.    I'm pretty sure Mayako Nigo also attempted to strangle Kenji Akabane later after his pathetic impression of Yayoi's UHHH UHHHH around 2:33 of the same video.   literally the only good hag   Your example of Shirou is young but he is not an idol. He is the MC and thus will win in the end regardless of stupid decisions. In visual novels and light novels, you have many youngsters becoming rich and powerful not because of consistently mature good decisions, but because they are the gary stu.   There's a popular gary stu light novel story (Zhan Long) right now with a former singing idol in it. Of course, she's successful because the author also made her the brilliant heiress of a military industrial empire. The male MC is her boyfriend. Between these two flashy idol-like chars, many readers self-insert and have a good time.      Fucking Asuza is actually a college graduate. One of the MLs actively goes to college.  Japanese college isn't any harsher than Japanese high-school.      She's a junior college graduate, I believe...    Also the most sexual, interestingly enough.      24 years old   Hag   And don't give me that   T/L Note: Baba means Hag bullshit.  Pic related is a real hag. Prehistoric even.             Azusa will never get married     Somebody's gonna succumb to her eventually.     This is lewd?  This is lewd.       The money she made was just enough to pay for law school education. The discipline needed to be an idol in Japan is much tougher than being a college student.  Even a retard can be a lawyer.    Come over here and fuck me, fuccboi.   I don't want to go to jail, sorry Baba.     Fucking Asuza is actually a college graduate.   Japanese college isn't any harsher than Japanese high-school.   Being a successful idol is harder than being an average college student. That is what the post said. It also defended idols in general as trying to earn money in order to better their lives. Being an idol is a job after all. It's not like everyone has money to go right to college, so some girls have little opportunity outside of part time jobs and being an idol. Sexy Seniorita did well enough as an idol to make enough money to pay her way thru law school. After she graduated, she did a few public appearance and then stopped because she was a full time lawyer. Apparently she did those appearances probably because of various factors I don't know about. Gratitude for past oppotunities? She missed the limelight? Sociable re-payment of past favors? Regardless, after those few appearances, she totally stopped being a singing idol.   I'm happy to see that she did make use of her idol career though to earn money and get a non-media career. Since she is a lawyer, she must have been a full college graduate and then some more beyond that.          Right, smart people go into finance.     lawyer  Call me when a STEM idol exists     Kaede a perfect.     Even a retard can be a lawyer.  Not every lawyer can be a retard though.    Baba is a troublemaker   You really do look down on idols. Well, there are those who are idol "fans" because they actually need to have something to look down upon. That type of "negative fandom" exists because that's their way of feeling better abotu themselves. There's no lack of those kinds of people.      I don't give a shit about 3D sluts.   How much does Kaede drink? Cirrhosis levels?  I want to make Mika happy.   As long as there's no whiskey, I'd be in for a drink with her.   Any older character that isn't a fucking drunktard? Literally every CG that's 20 or older has at least a card in which she is getting wasted.   Japan has a pretty goddamn big drinking culture.  You're expected to go out drinking. It's actually considered rude if you refuse an offer by a friend or co-worker to go out drinking.      Truly my social ineptitude knows no borders.    I want to fuck Rika behind Mika's back.    Arisa doesn't drink.  Although that may be rooted in the fact that she also works as a Nursery Teacher. Master Trainer (Aoki Rei) is one of the oldest CGs around and she doesn't drink. She probably chugs down energy drinks like a madwoman though.     Nao should be more upfront about her affections for P-san! She should have the attitude, "It's Nao or never!"  The /vg/ thread is often stuck on their fondness for ML. CG fans would feel reluctant to post there, thinking, "N-no, it's too ML-y!"    "N-no, it's too ML-y!"  Did someone say Emily?      STOP     I saw love between them in there one episode where he gets lost        One day    Whose rape child is this   We really need a bit focus on lolis this season. I know most of you disagree, but the balance has really fallen off against them, be it in the anime, game or boards over here or nips.   Best hags. Kotori is mah waifu.   me on the right    Do I need premium member ship to add videos to my favorites list on nico now?   Why is she so pure?    Part of Dead-y Stars canon   Relevant      Hey if Ryou got adopted into Side-Homo, I don't see why ML or CG can't adopt any of the DS girls.      I'll never forgive side-M for ruining Ryou.  The faggot maid boy is a poor substitute.      I'm hoping we get a Chieri episode in S2, just so they make this scene from the even canonical  They played Taiko no Tatsuji Song: Star!! Chieri: perfect - 245, good - 95, missed - 6, max combo - 91, barrage combo - 43  TakeP: perfect - 273, good 67, missed - 6, max combo 185, barrage combo - 63            2nd Season cast   They won't change the main cast. Although they may be the primary supporting cast for the second season.  What worries me is Star!! is listed as the OP. Are they seriously reusing it? But I reckon this may just be a cold open just like how Onegai Cinderella was used in episode one.  The episode literally airs in between the first and second day of the big 10th anniversary live. They're bound to be hiding something. GOIN!! literally came out of nowhere too considering that most people expected Star!! to be performed in episode 13.  Lastly, it needs to be said  Chie becomes even more relevant   FUCK.                Horrible is horrible for shows that have a lot of songs in them, wait for quaity subs.    fuck yeah 2DChiaking!     876 cards when?     I bet at home she has a penis shaped phone.    Ryou's already a SideM     FUCK.  You'll need to marry her first before you can do that.      More idols should wear t-backs     Why is she so lewd?    I'd rather a Ranko.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127166138   Wrong board?     BAKANE A K A N E          Chie is very easily scared by people she doesn’t know, and in fact was actually terrified of Producer at first.  They're going to do something about this in the anime, I just know it. And then they'll make her the Chibiusa of this series.     Nu the cutest   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127166138  I'm not even sure you meant to post this here as if it's meant to be something about Kirari. But really, why this 3D post here?     A joke based on pic related attracting a crowd of any magnitude     I wonder if her little brother masturbates to her gravure pics.   Why is Love Laika so gay?    I thought it was pretty sexy     not gay, just very sisterly  who am I kidding @WAKEN MY M@STERS         Really? I still remember when /@/ was bitching about how ML felt soulless and boring compared to CG.    How do they sing live with no microphones?    Nope, it's almost all they talk about now, coupled with comments about the lewd things they'd do to them in short one-liners.   get captcha for street signs   hardly any of them show street signs except one   "Select more to be verified"         their necklaces are mics? i dunno, normally a singer would have a headset when they can't hold a mic   What is it about Rin that makes her look like a prostitute?   What, don't tell me you dislike hundreds of posts of  &lt;verb&gt;ing with &lt;idol&gt;      Licking anon idol's typing fingers.     look like  But she is one    What is she so scared about?   no burgs     Anzu is about to steal her Pokemon     But that would require effort on her part.     the things I want to do to that lazy ass     I like Anzu the most, but she almost never appear in these thread, how is her popularity in niplands?  And more Anzu pic please, I need to start saving now.     Post-Character Development Riina when?   Not necessarily a popularity poll, but this picture should give you a general impression.    That's not bad, guess /a/ just have shit taste as usual.  But the retard cat idol is 2nd? This is beyond me, she is just so annoying with that nya nya bullshit.       No, we just have different taste.  Remember there is Japan and then there is the rest of the world       Fuck you cat is best.    This strip makes me feel really fuzzy.  Somewhere in the back of the crowd, Natsuki is sporting this exact gesture for Riina.  I really hope they adapt this CGTheater as a basis for Riina's character arc in cour 2.        Well I think it would just switch the focus on the other girls; other than the CG project girls.     Listen to my song   It's on now Riina. Time to fucking Rock.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0Er<wbr>4i47a37s#t=1m02s</wbr>  [ ]       Does Mika have any other songs other than tokimeki?    switch the focus on the other girls   No, that would be fucking stupid.  The surface of the characters of the 14 girls are barely scratched. Shifting now would literally be suicide. They'd be making the mistake of the classic Father, Son and Horse aesop, which is attempting to please everyone and ending up pleasing nobody and essentially shooting themselves in the leg.  I'm quite wary to the way A-1 writes things but come on, they're not that stupid.          She has 1 son and is in the group song of that passion idols album.     Collab songs     That's the supporting cast list anon.  Why do you think Chihiro and Producer are there?   Unless you count cover songs, most CGs only have one solo song to their name.  Quite a few group songs though. There is actually an upcoming duet song between Miho and Mika.            Implying A-1 isnt stupid.    I know; I just think it would be better to reshuffle the unit and add the supporting chars.       Wanted to update this to include names of the rest.    Why did that hobo place so high?    Because lots of people collaborated together to make her get the most votes so she could get a voice as revenge for the unvoiced pedolection results.    Syuko gacha and generous CoolP's    Rigged, every cg vote is rigged. This particular vote is up when the game's gacha top SR is a set of Syuko, Shiki and Yumi. And since gacha/money rollers gets extra vote ticket ...   Will Mikatan stay safe /a/?

Are you fucking stupid?    I want to sexually fuck Tomoko!  Are there any other ways to fuck?   we all do.         Has she been actually bullied in the manga?   I want to non-sexually fuck Tomoko!    Fuck off, there are thousands of girls just like Tomoko but you wouldn't look twice if you saw them irl   I want to make her a defication restricted sex stow    No, The author doesn't want to put the bullying element into manga.     I want to non sexually hug Tomoko!   I want Tomoko to sexually sit on my face   BRISBANE R I S B A N E           no, Japan.. I'm the author    I want to kiss Tomoko in the forehead, while holding her    I want to kill her butthole while she cries   i want to  dissect  tomoko   I've been meaning to actually watch this.  Some of my favourite doujins are of her.  http://g.e-hentai.org/g/676340/0f45<wbr>928fe2/</wbr>        fat white girl detected    Well none of them would want to deal with me.    Jesus, I deeply love this show but seeing those doujins made me die a little inside. It's like seeing my daughter in porn or something.   Never experienced that before. Strange. Usually i'm totally up for that stuff.      mfw cute incest doujins of moko with no digustig fetishes     Usually i'm totally up for that stuff.  Seeing your daughter in porn?       I suppose could have worded that better...   speaking of, what happened to /a/ colors tomoko?  willing to bet at least 15 of these 20 unique IPs are from beanerville fuck off beaners     No one gives a fuck about landwhales tbh, consider suicide.     mfw doujins of tomoko in an actual relationship      I want to cuddle her non-sexually.   aight    It wouldn't be so bad. I mean my cousin did porn, and seeing her get fuck by all those guys gave me a tremendous sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing I'd beaten them to it.    You did not get paid for it.    She inadvertently bullies herself.    thats lewd!   I sat next to an girl with massive anxiety at the store. She squinted whenever I tried to look at her and couldn't make eye contact. She looked like she was in pain. sigh... Too bad she was ugly.      no, thankfully. It would be even more painful to read with bullies.     You just couldn't let me have that one happy thought, could you?    Oh, hey landwhale! I don't know if you are a fujo but please consider suicide.   tomoko fuckers are worse than horse fuckers.  It it some perverted form of empathy?   That sounds like you are insinuating that you've fucked your daughter.    Back the fuck off my waifu!!    canon end     But I don't want to fuck a girl like her. I want to fuck her.     Does anyone know if they're going to make new episodes?    I want to cheer her up.    It's about the manga. It's always been about the manga.    Never, because you're just a disgusting leech who never bought the BDs and manga.    I haven't got a daughter.  I wouldn't be opposed to the idea though, once she was an adult of course.     Eat a dick, nigga      Deal with it.    Fuck you Carlos you piece of shit. You think you're so damn funny don't you.   Is the /a/ draws tomoko fag here? When will we get our youtube video?    I want to sexually gangrape Tomoko with /a/   Post a scene    I don't think what would be very good for her mental and emotional wellbeing    This I drew like half a dozen of them for him and i want to see the final product or atleast draw some more if he ever makes a new thread    If it doesn't end up getting made someone else could just take the images from the imgur folder and do it instead.   ^   Oh thats right, I forgot that the imgur folder exists. That makes things easier     Its still no excuse. The op should have stuck with his idea to the end. The lazy cunt better make a comeback soon     well, heres the album if someone else wants to give it a shot     forgot link  http://imgur.com/a/vVQMg#122     Sex for the sole purpose of procreation.    I want to spray her with a hose while I yell "CLEAN YOURSELF SLUT" and laugh at her misery.    only reference that she was called names in the past but knowing tomoko, she probably deserved it by being a bitch    Best doujin  and ship    Was it ever confirmed that President was in the dog costume or was that just an anime inference    Pls be 18 in this photograph    Just thinking that. One of those ones you want to save but decide not to because it could be taken the wrong way    it's the prez    Hate to be that guy but I couldn't find sauce on this.    No Matter How You Look At It, It’s Senpai’s Fault that I Came!    Thanks    No problem anon, I intend to make the world a brighter place by spreading the love.    So what's the deal with the President why does she care so much about Tomoko?    It's called LOVE    The author was bullied and thought it was too painful. The editor thought it was too painful that she didn't have any friends and that's why they created moeslut.      I hate you summer /a/      but in all seriousness, she's probably trying to get Tomoko to come out of her shell.   Haha.   Prez was also an introvert once so she wants to help Tomoko.    But moeslut is a terrible friend.    3/4 of tomoko doujins I've seen involve scat or make her look bony to the point of seeing her ribcage   please make it stop     That's just the artist's way of showing she's messy and doesn't take good care of herself    ^this    I think the threads ended and OP is making the video. Which sucks because I finished my OC too late.   Nevar forget.   where would you take tomoko in the first date?    Behind a dumpster in an alleyway     Just like Tomoko   Fat   No      Would Tomoko do anal?  I wanna bully Tomoko  until she commits suicide      I wanna give Tomoko and make over and a haircut   [spoilerI wanna impregnante tomoko and leave her to raise my halfbreed[/spoiler]    Yeah because any authority that gives a shit about this sort of thing is going to give a shit about the supposed age.      I love 'em.     The arcade or an anime movie. Dont have to talk much and its something she would be comfortable doing    LONDON PLS O N D O N  P L S                you will never spend a pleasant, romantic afternoon with Tomoko  http://pastebin.com/mzWR1Wqe     The last line was really the only thing anybody needed.    one fucking job anon    Yes she was. I don't have the screen cap but it's an earlier chapter. She has a flash back when her friend asked her "Did you have any nicknames in middle school?" Tomoko thinks about it for a bit and you see names like, "Bitch!" and "Moron!" and other stuff like that. She was bullied in the past, but not actively in the comic.      If she was bullied then the manga would be better.    Fucking doujinshits. Watch the goddamn anime at least, then read the manga.     this picture makes me sad    I'd never even heard of it before I saw that doujin by chance. It wasn't a conscious decision to look for porn before watching the show.  But I have it now and will be reading/watching.        Yeah it's pretty poorly drawn.      But what if i have a sexual fetish for purely procreative sex?   Just imagine  being Tomoko's class mate and dragging her behind the bicycle shed before school, making her expect just a kind word or a kiss on the cheek, but instead pulling down her panties, getting your dick out, and fucking her raw against the wall.   Just imagine,  a little later in class, watching her looking at you over her shoulder, giving you a grateful smile, reaching down her skirt, then showing you her index finger, which is dripping wet with your cum.   Just imagine  watching her sticking out her tongue and giving her finger a long, slow, lustful lick.   Just imagine that.         Well, that's alright I guess. Now that you've essentially fucked her you can at least take her to dinner.  A lot of doujins fail to portray Tomoko's bitchy side, which has been especially prevalent in the recent chapters since she's had to deal with interacting with others for a prolonged period of time. Most of them only portray her spaghetti-dropper side. You might find it surprising, some people hate it, I think it makes her a more interesting character.       sticking your dick in a pile of shit     but what if   Will Togashi die before he finishes Hunter X Hunter?   No.   He's dead already. this is the biggest Jump's conspiracy.   He's only 49 years old, so no.    So him being "sick" or "injured" is just Jump stalling for time as they try to warp the series for their own sinister gain? Everything makes sense now.   So what's his deal, is he addicted to Idolmaster too?  Also who the fuck is spamming HxH threads and why?   Its called Dragon Quest dad    Even if he were 18 he would die before finishing HxH    Forget about HxH, read a better manga.    You're thinking of Miura, Togashi plays DQ.  Someone who can't use the catalog.      How do you find something better than a masterpiece?     HxH is a masterpiece  Fucking kek.     U haven't read it.    Nausicaa     tumblr     Name a better shounen.     moron still thinks that Kentaro Miura still plays The Idolmaster  He does many things. You just don't know what he does.     JoJo    Urusei Yatsura    That's the only good part of hunter x hunter    KeitAi.     gay ass japanese title  Fuck that. kill yourself you fucking nerd      Only shounen manga can be a masterpiece   wut?    Why would you use those shitty quality short tumblr gifs?   ebin    NNT, Toriko and One Piece.    It's a masterpiece in the battle shonen type manga.    Its too silly to compare but it is good tbh.   Is this the bait thread?   A masterpiece in the shittiest genre, wow!    Fairy Tail.    That's not harem.    I never said that.    At least harem can have good girls, fighter shounens are just shitty sausage shits    Lol     At least harem can have good girls  Opinion discarded.     You havent read hunter x hunter    Ok.    Well, there are lots of IM games. It takes time after all.    Can't believe these losers actually see naked female cartoon characters as a plus.    Where do you think you are.    And even if you were 18 you'd still live out your entire life without ever getting a gf. Instead of sitting on your ass all day cutting yourself over hxh how about you go do something fucking productive and try to make some good out of your useless life.    You're such a dumb boy.    They also have annoying voices.    Your faggot shounen fighter MCs have the same girl voices.    You're right. I'm an idiot. Fuck this place.    sup normie    You haven't read Toriko.    Since when is loser an insult here?     Toriko even in the same league as OP or HxH   Fucking KHR is better than Toriko     Just wait for 6 months more     Rather hear a female make a little boy voice than a female make an annoying squeaky high pitched little cartoon fanservice bitch voice.    At least post the proper chart. https://hiatus-hiatus.rhcloud.com/     Yeah, you're actually right. Nice dog by the way.     You haven't read HxH.    Who said it was?    Neither have you.   I can't decide whether the chimera ant arc was the best or worst part of the entire story.  the pacing was all over the fucking place (did anyone really care that much about knuckle's stupid ability?) but the character development was excellent.     Thanks.     a lot of people get upset about the CA arc because it went on for almost a decade in manga form, and didn't include Hisoka/Chrollo/Kurapika at all (basically leaving the phantom troupe plot unfinished for nearly 10 years)      (did anyone really care that much about knuckle's stupid ability?)   I did      Numbers fuck me up    The ant arc was a way to introduce a DC creature that spiraled way out of control and turned into shit. Most of the characters were puppets to the plot and there was no reason for it to last more than 40 chapters.     puppets to the plot   only time where the plot dictated the pacing was when Komugi almost died  People say the stupidest shit to complain about this arc       the anime should have split the pacing in half. god damn that fucking castle invasion segment was borderline naruto tier.     Pacing was pretty shit, but I loved the characterization and how it set up the counter to the invasion.     The invasion was meant to feel slow and thorough, but it's true that they dragged out some scenes to get their best animators to work on certain episodes (this is noticable between episodes 113-115). It wasn't nearly as bad in the manga, each narration segment only took one panel.      I don't think so, Miura will die first........ then, I will go "BERSERK"     CA does have some pretty great stuff  -Meruem and his cronies all get some form of development, even Pitou who I never thought would display so much fear  -We get to see what Netero can do  -Cheetu getting his head crushed by Silva  -Gon and Killua unveiling new abilities  -Lots of progression for Gon's character arc in general  -Interesting reincarnation/duality themes  The biggest flaw of the arc is that characters that should have been minor (Knuckle and Shoot in particular) have way too much time devoted to showing the audience what they're doing.                    I hate the CA arc because the qt bee girl ended up getting killed off. And she wasn't even reincarnated as a cute bee-themed girl.      Ow man, it's hard to play     All characters (even minor ones like Ikalgo and Welfin) had a thematic role.    Onepiece, Naruto, Bleach    yep, the characters were only there for togashi's narrative points  it really sucked      Bait   will kurapika stay as a 'boy'? the 'twist' that kurapika is actually a girl doing a mulan has been obvious for almost a decade now, so i doubt togashi will ever give the audience the satisfaction of a reveal.   Sorry anon, your waifu is a man.   Yea in Dragon Quest   There was absolutely no reason to ever believe that he's a girl. He's expressly been a boy since chapter 2     do you think chrollo is a girl as well?      the 'twist' that kurapika is actually a girl doing a mulan has been obvious for almost a decade now  Delusional.      genders in HxH are fucked beyond repair anyway  look at the younger zoldyck siblings or pitou (despite there being female ants and looking like a cute girl, pitou is regarded as genderless)      This is now a Pika thread.    do you think chrollo is a girl as well?  Yes, because Hisoka canonically uses texture surprise to conceal her breasts.    Why is Killua's mom Robocop      He's so cute.    Why all this tumblr.     Gender ambiguity isn't genderlessness.    Alluka's a she, Kalluto's a he, Pitou's a they. Not that hard to understand. Now, if we're going to talk about sex instead of gender...    This. Pitou is whatever makes you want to fuck it the most.    Where else would i get the gifs?      More like Togashi is living off of his wife.  A divorce would shock Togashi back to reality where he then needs to start paying his bills by making manga again.        I'm pretty sure he got enough money from YYH and Level E.    maybe if you close your eyes and ignore the lady parts    Yes Togashi is horrible and has terrible work ethic.   He finished YuYu Hakusho and that's all that matters.   Why does Jump let him get away with this?     that huge streak during 2011 - 2012   coincidently when the anime started   Wow, Togashi fucked them in the ass later on when he didn't give a fuck again.      Togashi really live in a dumpster?    the pacing was all over the fucking place   yet still better paced than every bleach arc, shit piece arc, and naruto arc.        He's not lazy, he fucking mindbroke due to overwork early on in his career. Presumably he works slowly these days so he doesn't explode his heart. I'd blame his doctor, but really I'd rather he die before finishing HxH than be killed by HxH.      ya he's horrible with a terrible work ethic yet he made the best shonen manga ever created. stop cutting yourself over a childrens manga and get some fucking professional help.     mindbroke  Stop, you're giving me weird images.     That streak was his support for the earthquake/tsunami  According to Weekly Shonen Jump vol.7, Togashi Yoshihiro has renewed his record of the consecutive publications of Hunter x Hunter. He has been published the manga for 21 consecutive issues since August 8th 2011. The previous record of 20 issues was accomplished from January 2010 to June 2010. The longest hiatus for 79 issues was made from February 2006 till October 2007. Togashi said he will keep on publishing Hunter as long as possible to encourage people in the disaster area of Tohoku Earthquake.       Holy mother of projection.  Why would little girls want to date other girls, tho?       alright, so what?    Assburger detected.     Oh how I enjoy summer.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127141367   Hi, how are you.

It's nothing like YYH though. YYH became a chore so he ended it in a rush. He has even more control over his work now so could end HxH if he wanted, but he hasn't.  As for money, he married Sailor Moon, and this hiatus he stopped one chapter short of a volume so he mustn't care about getting any money from it.  I think he really does have health issues but also work ethic issues, most people would rather have year long holidays than work and Togashi has the freedom to do so.         Are the HxH threads raided by /rk9/?   No, they're raided by shit piece fags.      Kill yourself.

I came here to bump this thread specifically for that reason.       you forgot the killua posters     I feel obligated to post this now.    The first page of hunter x hunter, Togashi says and i quote" I will work hard to crank out dozens of volumes I promise not to complain, I wont run away , I wont lose it , I think maybe..."   .... Incredible foreshadowing      Why is he so fucking unreliable? Does being a mangaka suck so much that he can't even churn out one chapter every month or so?    It's probably hugely in his head. He's feeling old and like he needs to start living for himself, not for other people, and he has enough money that he doesn't need to work, but he feels guilty about starting a series that millions around the world love, and nostalgia + guilt force him to write a new chapter every once in a while, and he's dedicated to putting his heart in it when he writes, so he only writes when he can do that because he doesn't want to put out a cheap chapter that's a waste of his followers' time.  That's what I like to believe.      I don't think he writes out of guilt, he seems to have no problem completely ignoring the expectations of fans and doesn't mind causing trouble for jump/his editors. But I do think he only wants to write when his heart's in it, for the story at least (maybe not the drawings).     finishes Hunter X Hunter  he already did     I know this is giving Togashi way too much credit, and it's almost definitely not true, but it felt like all his crappy illustrations were in the really lighthearted panels that were kid friendly, almost like those happy moments in the story were written and drawn like a child, and it was intentional.  Again though, I know that is giving him way too much credit, and it's like 99% likely that that is not true and he was just being lazy.       Again though, I know that is giving him way too much credit, and it's like 99% likely that that is not true and he was just being lazy.     These chapters were all redrawn, heavily so, in the volumes. It was just laziness.  What are you are saying is only probably true for the chapter where Gon meets up with Kaito at the end of the CA arc, but those weren't sketch's, Togashi actually used water paint for that chapter.         Definitely not, the scribbles happened during the first half of the CA arc and there was nothing childish about that.  But they weren't the worst thing in the world to me, scribbles done by a competant artist can still be tolerable to look at because they're just first drafts. I save scribbled fanart because I like the look of it.      Is it wrong that I love the idea of Gon and Killua cuddling in a platonic sense just being kids that aren't ashamed of cuddling, but I'm also ok with the idea that they might explore their sexuality too?    Of course not anon. Any sort of affection between them is a good thing.    Pitou is such a slut.    I sincerely hopeso, but only if it's in the next few years. I don't know how long this whole "four-chan" thing is going to last, but I want to be on /a/ to taste the tears and impotent rage of knowing HxH won't be touched by anyone for the next fifty years.    Her parents use gender neutral terms.   Since Togashi left so many things open, do you think Gon has an imouto somewhere in the world?  Realistically though, Togashi will probably never revisit the problem of Gon's biological mother.      sexualizing the pitou     Kill yourself.     Togashi will probably never revisit the problem of Gon's biological mother.  It's not a problem, though.     Bad word choice on my side, "question" maybe? Gon's relationship with Mito is great and I wouldn't his real mother introduced, though that wouldn't change things.     Gon already said he doesnt't care about his real mother, Mito is his mom now. Togashi doesn't have to explain shit.   Killua is cute!   That is a correct statement, thank you.    Because summerfags    Bur that's wrong.    Pitou is made for sexualizing.    Faggot pls refer to     Kill yourself.    That's rude anon.    Why would you say this? Don't say this    The fact that this actually has become a possibility makes it even more depressing.    Pitou's literally one of the least sexual people in the HxH world. Maybe you'd have a case with Leorio or Zazan.    They call her an it because they don't think she's a person.    Per volume sales sell on-par or sometimes more than Naruto.  Kishimoto wold get fucking wrecked if Togashi went all-out.       image.jpg   not killua_misses_his_target.jpg      see    your fat ass will die long before togashi does       really toriko has been constantly in what hxh would consider the dark continent     Pitou's literally one of the least sexual people in the HxH world.  Says you     I want Illumi to protect me!   www.animemaru.com/hunter-x-hunter-s<wbr>taff-going-on-hiatus-to-play-every-<wbr>dragon-quest-game/</wbr></wbr>   He's so normal.      You might as well say Meruem is sexual since he has large hips and thighs then. Go all the way, anon.    I want Illumi to discipline me!    His proportions aren't attractive     Pitou has an appealing design that people sexualize.      cute face and sexy body  speak for yourself    <br/>  Post Pitou  HxH was only good until CA arc, then it was mostly shit with a few good moments.  Best arcs are Hunter Exam and Greed Island and HxH will never be good again.         What a shit opinion you have anon. The best arcs were Yorkshin, Greed Island and CA.    You forgot to mention the Yorkshin arc.  Greed Island is the closest arc so far that delivered on some things that were promised in the first chapter, so it's probably the highest point. But the DC arc will get started eventually.  Still, one shitty arc really hurt the series because of its length and hiatuses.       Maybe. Togashi has literally no reason to work on Hunter x Hunter aside from wanting you. He's happy being a stay at home dad and playing Dragon Quest all the time.    things that were promised in the first chapter  Like what, Gon becoming a hunter and finding his dad? Those have been done in other arcs.     'Oh damn its a legit HxH thread!'   Another pedo fagets circlejerking  welp     HxH should have focused more on this type of stuff. Hunter Exam, Greed Island, DC, and whatever else Togashi could have imagined in place of Yorkshit and Chimerashit    Pitou isn't sexual no matter what Madhouse wants you to think.     Yorkshit  why?       It wasn't memorable and Kurapika ruins it at the last minute with moralfaggotry and loss of resolve.  I never liked power levels and nen in HxH       hurr this creature who doesn't behave in sexual ways is sexual because they have a female body     y-you too     realizing revenge isn't fulfilling and choosing your friend's lives over it is moralfaggotry   implying greed island isn't nen: the arc      Those were never the premise though. Just because Yorkshin and CA weren't what you were expecting from HxH doesn't mean they weren't great.   moralfaggotry  Oh okay, then he should have murdered everyone and let his friends die for his revenge and concluded the arc with "Yeah, sorry" i guess. Believe it or not, killing someone has some pretty big emotional weight.         i liked Greed Island   i don't like nen       Phantom Troupe is still out there and they won't forget about Kurapika. If he didn't have a big enough cock to follow through with his plan to destroy them he never should have started. He has to finish it eventually, they aren't just gonna roll over.   Not to mention there will be more and more victims of their cruelty who could have been saved by Kurapika.       Kurapika's stopping made sense, he is actually someone who has experienced loss so he doesn't want to lose anyone else.   I fucking hate how there are so many legit fags in HxH threads. Where did you retards come from? Maybe that's why he stopped writing this shit   yes    Amazing anon, you are really contributing to the discussion with your shitposting!     Maybe they will let bygones be bygones and just let it go? I mean let's be serious, Chrollo was likely seriously thinking about recruiting Kurapika and machi was alright with it. Nobunaga was the only one really asshurt about it and Chrollo made him calm the fuck down.     Kurapika has made a decision that you didn't like because he didn't become a murderous edgelord, how does that make Yorkshin bad exactly?     Fine then. Can we discuss what Kite's role is as a CA now? Isn't she the perfect guide to the DC? Will she die again? Can any human's potential even reach kite's as a CA?    Is the show worth watching or should I read the whole way through?    Hm read chapter 1 and then watch it. The anime is a 1:1 you lose nothing by watching it other than the kite thing at the start and it's a lot more  fun      Some episodes are definitely worth watching, but the manga is superior in pretty much every single way. However, there are some chapters where Togashi got sick/lazy and were drawn like shit, he eventually has redrawn them though. I think only bakabt has the redrawn scans.     He will become more mellow and kindhearted, and then when him and Gon are reunited all of his feelings will come back. But instead of Killua seeing himself as worthless in comparison to Gon he'll see himself as just lucky to have a  ___friend  as amazing as Gon.     murdering murderers   bad  He has every right to be edgy when it comes to the Spiders.      breeders gtfo    No     likes shit girls  even pitoufags are better than you.       mfw kurapika exterminates these spiders      He's completely normal, anon.    Joke's on you, i like Bisky too.    I want Illumi to hug me!    you should cut back your tastes a bit then, because it's starting to leak into shit.  I want Illumi to  carry  me       disliking the best arcs  What a shitty taste.  My husando Hisoka wasn't even a big part of CA and barely did anything in Yorkshin, compared to his great moments in Hunter Exam, the tower thing, and greed island, and even so I still admit Yorkshin and CA are immensely better than those...       But that was at the cost of his friends lives, and unlike Sasuke Kurapika's not an edgelord. He doesn't want revenge for the sake of it.     talking about shit taste   wanting Illumi to carry you  Speak for yourself anon.      illumi is best boy though   honestly illumifags have the worst taste    implying Gon wouldn't have moved on by then.    Killua's problem isn't just his self esteem but also his shit personality.      This is what the Spiders did to his family and friends. Kurapika would be doing a service to humanity by killing them, it's not just revenge.    there are people who unironically enjoy HxH just like there are people who unironically enjoy bleach    Almost as bad as Killuafags. Any sensible person knows that Leorio is the best boy.    D. Gray man ;_;    leorio is best man, pleb    See     Stop lying.     The anime is a 1:1 you lose nothing by watching it     I always forget this existed... And Iwatched all the episodes, if I'm not mistaken... can't even remember what it was about, the only thing I remember is the appearance of the main villain.    D.Gray-man is shit. Absolute shit.     implying Gon doesn't still love him     Gon is too pure for his own good, and doesn't realize that Killua is a shit friend.    True, but maybe Killua will get better Or maybe he does understand it somewhat and is just really forgiving     Illumi is a beauty.     maybe he does understand it somewhat  He really doesn't, he has some pretty serious self-esteem issues and believes that everything was his fault. I mean shit, he even tried to kill himself and said that he should have been the one to die.     Why is he so beautiful, anon?     you just don't know what he does.  I sure know what he doesn't do, fucking Berserk     My biggest fear is that somehow Togashi's intention actually was that Gon is at fault and Killua was totally justified when he was screaming "I'll make you apologize!"  but I hope Togashi is a better writer than that      It is because he is beautiful on the inside as well. He is the best big brother.   Alright so lets discuss how long each of us would endure without chapters before giving up on this series and moving on.  I personally am a pretty weak willed person so I would likely give up on HxH if the hiatus lasted more than 3 years with no news.  Also here's a shitty personality test chart I found       Obviously not, it's just that people mistook Killua's thoughts for actual narration.    what do you mean I'll just read the new chapters if they come     Yeah but I'd like to see some acknowledgement that Killua is wrong. The closest thing we got was Alluka getting mad at him for being hard on Gon.    As long as I can shitpost on /a/ I'll be fine.      not a catsomething discarded        How long will keep actively following HxH? How long will you keep looking for news related to it? How long will you participate in threads like these?  There has to be a point where you just go "whatever, if a new chapter comes out I might read it but I currently don't care about the series anymore".  Surely you aren't planning on clinging to a series for the rest of your life if it becomes obvious that a new chapter is not going to come?         I don't plan on the rest of my life    NNT    Well Killua wasn't around anyone who would have told him that he was a shit to Gon, if Bisky was around she would have let him have it, but she wasn't there, so there was no one who really could have called out on it.  Because of the DC arc involving Nanika Killua will probably end up having to face his fuck ups head on.      I hope so. I hate how that fagget gon looks.    Maybe Togashi plans to have Killua become self aware at some point then feel all guilty and scared of Illumi's ''you will betray your friends'' prophecy, at which point he'll either decide his brother is right and he's not worthy of friends or he'll try to make it up to Gon..    Gon is a miracle of the universe.    original meme do not steal    Is Gon asexual?     Isn't she the perfect guide to the DC?  I like this idea. Maybe she'll fight by Gon's side this time?     I doubt Gon and Kite have anything to do with the DC.    He has his mind on other things, he is supposed to be the pure and simple character. That's why he hates it so much Pitou, somebody who hurt a person he cares for, is doing a good deed by healing a human girl.Yeah though, I know he has some dark undertones especially the way he accepts Ging left him and that makes him very interesting. Maybe the pure and simple act is just a way of not thinking about such things.  Did he not hit puberty yet to be interested in people?     What?     she     What about her?    This is an interesting character design but the blonde loli version looked so cute. Well at least I assumed she was blonde.     I have no defense for myself or my shit series so hurr kill yourself  You should take your own advice anon, you are sad, your life is sad.     I don't know what grill Kite's real hair color is, but I'll pretend it's white like man Kite's hair.    That's some really nice fanart. I hope we see more of Kite in battle eventually.   anime only fag here  does the manga show the rest of kite's weapons?     Koala confirms it's red.    Not really. Was it only 2 or 3? I might not remember correctly.    No.    No. I'm still mad.  2, 3 and 4.      Damn, I'm dumb. I forgot about that   which HxH would you snuggle up and watch TV with?   Sensui       watch tv   not play joystation      Shizuku I guess.     that image  Gon was too innocent for the Hunter world.     Jump off a bridge.    we will never see the full series   we will never get blurays of the original show   Never, ever, EVER   Fuck. at least it kinda ends on the newest arc. It's not closure, but it's nowhere near as fucked as What berserk fans have to go through.  Shame about the original show though. The production values were so good. I would prefer it to the new one if they had actually finished it.         I've actually been wondering if there's an intentional parallel between these faces made by Gon and Killua. Of course it could just be Togashi using similar expressions and they might not be connected at all    Illu-nii.     The original show's style suits the yorkshin arc and chimera ant, but not the others.      Just finished the manga today.  Holy fuck it got really boring near the end.      end     Greed Island OVAs though.    I wonder, that face isn't reused anywhere else. And they both were in a similar situation.     Holy fuck it got really boring near the end.  Too much exposition?     You mean the DC exposition?    These don't exist.    To be fair both adaptations of GI were shit     In what way?     99 was shit animation and 2011 cut stuff for no reason, plus censorship     The exposition dump was a bore to me since I know the DC isn't going to come into play until maybe 2017 (if we're lucky)  Maybe it was scans I read, but the wordiness got a little extreme. I'm not saying that there were too many words, but the way they were presented didn't exactly make it an easy read. See kurapika opening his fine mouth.       forgot to post pic     I love how he developed his nen ability to specifically kill the spiders, yet it can be used as a dowsing rod..     He only designed two of them to work specifically against the spiders.    The viz scans on nyaa are less wordy, if you want to check them out.   would you give kurapika a  footrub?     Yeah, you should check out the Viz scans. The translations are better.      2017     The pacing was awful but the chimera ant arc is the only notable part of HxH and without it HxH wouldn't have been worth the time       the chimera ant arc is the only notable part of HxH and without it HxH wouldn't have been worth the time  Shit opinion, i love the CA arc but the rest of HxH is still great.     Its the truth At least CA arc tried to be different    Do you think Killua swallows  watermelon seeds?      its definitely above average, but without it hxh wouldnt be top 10 shonen battle manga    One. Only Chain Jail is restricted to the Troupe. Judgment Chain requires that his eyes turn red.     yes, i think he'd enjoy it after a long day.     I know, but he designed it to be used against the troupe. I'm pretty sure he states it when he discusses it with Gon, or just at the end of the Yorkshin arc.    lol I guess was being incredibly hopeful. My guess is we'll see beyond look out from his ship to the whirling seas then the chapter ends. then 2018 we see him say "there it is"     tried to be different   battles up the wazoo and literal explosions      Is that really all you got from it?    All of HxH tries to be different. That was almost the entire point of anticlimaxes.    illumi is intj    ENTJ should have been Pouf.    Truly the best boy.    10 years, still going strong.  You weak little cunt.       Killua   Idealistic   Loyal   Seek to understand people and help them fulfill their potential       togashi should just give his remaining script and character designs to madhouse. its obvious he just wants to retire and play dragon quest.    wanting retards to handle the material     Madhouse did a great job with Kite and those movies, i sure wish Togashi would let them butcher HxH more    It would easily stay top 5. Standards for battle shounen aren't high.    The CA arc knocked it right out of the top ten. Only DC can redeem it now.    Nice shit opinion, CA arc is great.    Nice shit opinion, CA arc is terrible.    its the best part of HxH so if its terrible, so is hxh    CA is what takes HxH from good to great, with some actual depth and notable character development.    I'm so glad that a bunch of throwaway characters received development. It really made the series special.    140 chapters is longer than most manga. You can hardly call them "throwaway", even without considering the fact that most characters that were involved in the CA arc are still relevant.    And others just got killed.   eeyore-ee   anal-qu-een   watch me pull a rabbit out of my  wait, it's not a rabbit?

Today's prediction is meteor shower. If you look up to the skies, you will remember of someone from somewhere you haven't yet meet. That person shall also look up into the starry skies, and the stars will watch over us from the cosmos."  Gainax, you sucked most of the time. But this show is a great parting present. See you again someday.      </wbr> </wbr> </wbr>   Wasn't there supposed to be a movie?   I'm probably going to cry at the last episode of this.       Wait really? I thought they canceled that movie and made pleiades a series instead.     What's wrong with Gainax?    Here's hoping that Subaru pulls a reverse Shinji on Minato.    That was a great episode, and great series too. I want to give them the AotS, but i want to know how the other shows finished before.   Just finished the episode. Shed some tears. Did the girls forget each other or did they keep their memories?     Nothing really. They made great shows, then they almost disintegrated and continued making decent shows noone cared about anymore because they weren't as great as their old stuff.    I don't want the ride to end.    They lost their memories so they could change.      did they lose their memories or just go back to their respective timelines?   What the hell, that was some EoE tier shit  Pretty good ending though  for a Gainax show      Lost their memories and went back to their respective timelines. That's why you see them sadden alone.     Lost their memories  It's not even implied what are you on about?     I thought Subaru had kept her memories because she seemed to recognize the others and told Aoi "lets watch the stars again" or something to that nature    Fuck that scene got me. I'm actually kind of glad they went that route, anything else wouldn't feel right.      But they changed by meeting each other. How i forgetting it gonna change them    How many babies will Minato and Subaru have?  Hopefully the first step towards Gainax ascendancy again.  The second step being the release of Uru In Blue.   Do I need to watch the OVAs now? I only started watching last week.   You don't need to as it's the condensed beta version, but I'd watch them anyway for the better art direction and sakuga (before all the talent left).     not even implied   I wasn't using that scene to refer to them losing their memories if that's what you mean. But yeah, it is implied through Subaru's actions when she returns to her world.    It didn't seem like to me. Rather when she saw the others, it looked like she was surprised by the help of strangers. The moment with Aoi "lets watch the stars again" was referring to when she use to do so with Aoi as a child before they became estranged from one another.     Remember, the Pleiades was suppose to grant wishes. They wished to change so they changed.            Talent left   What happened?      Exodus to Khara.    Plus Trigger.   The real question is does apate not light up at all in the ending universe?   I see where you're coming from. So if she's lost all magical memories would she still remember Minato? Outside of that hospital visit when they were kids    Not sure. She seems to have a strong connect with Minato and even kept his sweater with her when she returned to her world so maybe she would?    I'm hoping she would, but knowing Gainax I can totally see Subaru telling him to live then promptly forgetting about him with him in a vegetative state.   This was my AOTS I feel so empty now   I'm hung up on what to rate it, but it feels sort of odd having what I expected to be a silly car advert end up being my AotS.   My headcanon is now that Minato's oxygen mask has come off, he will wake up and go to school. Then him and Subaru will reunite and watch the stars together.   Well, a lot of people agree it's AOTS. But honestly, do you see it becoming AOTY?    A very welcome surprise for sure  yeah, I like that a lot better     This part made me hnnnnnnng   No gainax ending?  pick the fuck up right now     Someone post what Minato says about Subaru making him live.  I liked the OVAs, and I liked this even more It's not my AOTS, but it is seriously my hidden gem of the season.  This was good for a car advertisement made by a Gainax that's a shell of what it was because of all the people that went to Khara and Trigger      I don't understand what Aoi's friend was even trying to do here.    Don't steal my friend.     All that she wanted was to wear that cute uniform  She makes my heart go po-warm. This anime was too po-warm for me.    marking aoi as her territory    I will miss the space porn.    afwuld ending since they forced bland romance between autism kun, is so bland that even Subaru admit that she don't know anything about him, showing how   I loved it. I'd like more of ponytail Nanako though   I'm discusted by you, how can you not lick the Minato x Subaru pairing.     het   autism  this reasons       forcing /u/ in a completely het show  Bwaaka.  Even after the reset ending the Minato x Subaru is still alive, she had his jacket when she woke up.       We all agree Nanako is best and sexiest girl, yes?    He's a new shitposter don't reply to him     It was completely when Aoi feeling was pushing even in the end but ''they don't count'' logic     Buchou is a miracle of this universe and all subsequent universes.     She spent half the show translating for the alien. She just felt fresh when she stopped doing it.  I'll agree that she has the best voice and that purple hair looked good on her.      Hikaru is the sexiest       perflat   short   blonde hair   twin tails   bold   yet not a tsundere   Best car advert.             Got the line before it?   Jesus Christ that was a beautiful ending.   Hikaru is the sexiest.    This one?    Yeah, thanks.   What if every time we wake up we reset our memory of another timeline we arrived from?   Can I reset my memory to watch this show again for the first time?     If only    It's over. ;_;   And Gainax won't make anything like this ever again.      Theoretically yes. In practice I doubt there'll be a surgeon who can pull it off any time soon.    Sure they will, if they're being paid to do that.    My ex-classmate had gone missing and was found with almost total memory loss. It's possible even without space and time warps    Meant to    Why is she so lewd?   It's "that" age for her.   how well did this show sell?   At least she wasn't trying to force him onto her chest.     namefag   shit opinion  Color me surprised.       what color is that?    Well, HorribleSubs are finally out though I suppose everyone watched CReep.  HS is out.   more than C3bu at least.     I'm at a loss of words to express how good this episode, and this entire series was. Congratulations Gainax, you did it again, even though you are just a ghost of your past self. Chapeau.    Oh shit I forgot about neetball stream, it ended 15 minutes ago.    Gives me another excuse to rewatch the episode again.    What's the name of the classical piece that plays when Subaru's star globe projector is turned on and starts rotating?   Gainax is now revived?    Clair de Lune   oh god I didn't want it to end. even though this was the best ending they could go for story-wise, I feel really sad now. why did they have to forget?  Minato  ;_;     Why are the BDs so expensive?   She'll remember right? She'll go to the hospital and visit him again, right?     It may have been worse to remember. Imagine being the only one to remember your fun adventures in a world with people who are different from those you know and knowing that they will never understand the great things you and your friends went through despite being said friends.    Thanks.    Japanese Jews.     They just are.  Unfortunately, the show doesn't have a lot of merch either.       It's dead but it died in a high note.    That's a possibility. In one world though the mask comes off and he dead.   I knew someone who dated a girl that woke up in a German woodland with amnesia. They acted like it was so cool and mysterious and nobody knew her real family, but when I met the girlfriend she said she was on a camping holiday and fell down a drop running from an animal. She was reunited with her dad within the week but didn't recognise him properly for a couple months. She said the weirdest thing was knowing her front door but not the kitchen/bathroom. Like someone had swapped the interior of their house for alien rooms. Now I think about it Pleiades' door opening was kind of like that.      I can tell that a show is awesome when the only true criticism I can give it is that the animation is subpar.  UMI DAAAA!   those tiny twintails   She became even cuter.    Also love that tomboy Itsuki.    Everyone's getting character development. I love it.     Great last episode, I'll miss this series.  Hope the OST comes out soon.    All in all a wonderful episode and show, last episode made me tear up a lot.  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51080598  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50488745</wbr>  </wbr>  Update when?    Not the original anon here, I'll try something, unless that anon is already working on it.    I loved all the little details Gainax put into this. The larger looking moon was noticeably moving at a realistic pace instead of being a still shot.  Nice ending too, I'm gonna miss this show.    I love how peaceful this thread is for a show that just ended.  Why does everybody got CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT? Can't they make them have longer hair instead? Fuck you Gainax.      missing the point of the changes    I still don't understand what the last scene means. Gainax did it again?   girls commenting on how they envy each other's positive traits   everyone else gets their personality mentioned   Itsuki is only envied for her pretty hair   I can't stop laughing. The tomboy whose most notable feature is her feminine appearance.       and then she cuts it You go, girl!     Nanako is, without a doubt, best girl.   I have the most appropriate SciFi boner.  This however gave me a different kind of boner.   Which last scene? I'm usually really retarded with things like this but I'm great with physics and concepts like this.   First version. Comments?     I still want a plush of that banana cow giraffe.    Apparently I'm not good with english either. I'm not good with abstract shit in anime like non-linear characters but I'm great with physics.      I like it. Maybe add tears?     If she remembered him we would have gotten a scene of her visiting him in the hospital. They probably all have residual feelings about each other that draw them together in their separate worlds, but they don't actually remember. The ending is Subaru talking about brief meetings broken up by long periods of separation and waiting for the people they will meet in the future.  Basically, they don't remember the past, but they still retain hope for a future that will be what they wanted it to be.      I second this. Pretty sure most of us were crying this episode.    I means the scene Minato sleeping beside Minato in 4 billion BC right at the end after scene Subaru watching meteor meteor shower with new fellows after she go back to the world Minato still in coma    She didn't cut it.  That was the Itsuki from Subaru's timeline. A different person     I would suggest giving them shorter hair but that doesn't really work with them, so I got nothing.    Long twintails &gt; short twintails  She's still the sexiest, though. Those sleeveless uniforms with that little slice of chest showing at the side kill me.      This is exactly what I wanted  Good night, forever, Pleiades threads      They went back to the start of humanity, where humanity had its highest potential, since it branches out as time goes on. Since they had so much potential, the cast could be literally anything they wanted (except for Minato, who wasn't actually there) yet they chose to be themselves.     Best girl, more please   Improved version.   I didn't cry, but I did feel something hot behind my eyes.   This was a pleasant show, and I won't be forgetting it anytime soon.       I bawled.    Thank you Gainax for this awsome show. I'm a little sad its over.    Take out the extra stuff.  Also, I'm not quite sure how you'd represent it visually, but the gaijin should be in separate worlds on the last one.      Didn't cry but my eyes were a little wet.    He said talent.     I was emotionally conflicted, almost cried.     Subaru and Aoi holding hands   they both say watashi wa together when everyone else says it separately   Adorable.       I would but for some retarded reason that fucking program didn't save the xcf-file even though I was sure I did tell it to, so now the whole thing is gone. You'll have to wait until someone makes an alternative version or you make your own.     Pretty sure Subaru will meet Minato again. See every time one of Minato's selves would "die" or the timeline changed Subaru would always meet with him shortly afterwards  Still it would have been nice if they would have added a scene of them meeting at the end anyway just to come full circle     Which episode had the Arawi Keiichi endcard?   3   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127166663   yuri baiting   not friendship  pls remove your goggles      Thanks.   Aggressive girls are the best  So, after this Gainax will die for good?  Thank you Gainax. You tried and succeeded on that last one.  Not economically, but still.      MY DICK    I'll be the one to make you happy   is responsible for all of his problems        women      I thought all of his problems were caused by terminal illness  She's just been the one preventing him from "disappearing from this world', which is another way of saying she's been the hope keeping him from giving up in his battle with his illness.      that sound effect as the black hole prolapses  Weirdest boner.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vXu<wbr>wslWaIes</wbr>  [ ]   T_T7      Why would she even do that?    The universe should take the hint and let Subaru have her Minato, it's pointless to fight it.    Maybe her butt hurt     He said talent.   posts hibike  top kek       They technically still have Uru In Blue left. Though they did announce something a couple weeks back about their staffing moving on or something iirc.     From what?    Why did it have to end, I wanted more outer space magical girls, it was so fun.   She accidentally sat on him.     thinking there isn't talent working on Hibike     They wanted to keep being magical girls too, so Gainax helped us feel the same sense of loss as them.   Please tell me someone is making a stitch of this gorgeous thing    thinking Hibike is good  toppity kekktity       Guys, stop that.      someone did last thread    11/10, thank you anon.    It's one of the best shows this season along with HnP, what are you talking about?  toppity kekktity  Oh wait, it's just /v/.       muh /v/oogeyman  And that's why you watch shit shows like Hibike      Ok, forget princess carry, this is the gayest crotch straddling technique I've ever seen.     I'm guessing the largest crown there is where the dinosaurs got nuked.    I personally don't like Hibike myself. I don't like the character designs Kyoani is trying to push, I don't like the characters, and I don't like the story.  Needs more moe      Just ignore him. He just wants to shit up this thread.    Even if you don't like how Hibike is written, there's a lot it does right from a visual standpoint.  And no, I'm not talking about the filtered photos.     When she was crying about her paper star in the past Minato expelled his potential crystal and gave it to her to console her. People expel those crystals when they become something and all the other somethings they could have been cease to be. So by deciding he wanted to be someone who makes Subaru happy he essentially resigned all other versions of himself to the same fate, one where he's in a coma.  Dark Minato was one of those alternate Minatos who would no longer come to be, refused to accept that, tried to undo his fate by gathering fragments, and was cursed because he didn't want to be comatose. That's why he sympathized with the fragments he collected, he literally was a fragment this whole time, an illusion from a world that would never be real anymore. He was destined to fail from the beginning, but it just made things worse that it was Subaru getting in his way constantly and he was ultimately done in because he still wanted to protect her.  And he's the lucky one, since Kaicho took him to another universe where he might find a real existence. White Minato, the real one, didn't want to be stuck in a coma either, but Subaru forced him to live against his will. And she didn't even go visit him at the end.       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12716768   Hibike   good  Welp at lest you like Houkago no Pleiades      Shitposting about Hibike  Just go to the thread that's up for guaranteed replies     Minato got cut off  rip     It does. I mostly like how they angle some of the shots, but everything else  like the filtered photos  doesn't do anything for me.     I like the filtered photos.      deleted  It was fantastic, I'm on the fence if they should be crying or not, but it's 10/10.      This reminds me a lot of  Rewrite's tree of possibilities.      The minato sitting in the bed and the minato gathering fragments are the same guy. There were 2 minatos; the one who was healthy enough to be awake and went on magical adventures, and the one who was in a coma on life support. All of his potentials converged on the poutcome of being the terminally ill coma patient, but magical minato was the one that existed parallel to that, partially because of the alien's magic, and partially because of his own refusal to submit to it.  You can think of magical minato, in all the forms he took throughout the series, as being coma minato's hope. His refusal to give up, and is wavering between absolute despair, surrendering to his fate, and the will to reject it and hope for something better. His magical journey mirrored his fight with his illness, just as some people miraculously recover from an incurable illness because they "never gave up hope". Magical Minato was that one lingering potential that refused to disappear, because it was the hope he placed in Subaru.     What a great episode! What a beautiful little show! Bravo Gainax!  I definitely shed some tears. Will miss this show, and the studio (if they really are done for after this) very much.   Also I'll miss these threads.       Scavenged from archive.     Fine, let the populace decide which one they like more. I hope the original anon does one as well.    CUTE    I feel that a few tears are adequate.    I don't understand the ending, why give up your memories and shit when you have the perfect friendship? Why is aoi so gay? Minato still in hospital even after the whole spiel  Wat  This is why we need feminism?      So will Minato stay comatose in Subaru's timeline?   When did the guys for episode 3 get put underwater? That's a great addition.   I was completely unprepared for Nanako's ponytail. Hot damn.   This will be a great reaction image.   Last week.       Minato's artificial respiration machine was disconnected, that means he wasn't in any life threatening danger anymore  Also, tears are a sign of a comatose person's brain functions beginning to work again, which means he will probably regain consciousness soon  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/art<wbr>icle-2155860/Tears-teacher-coma-fia<wbr>ncee-phones-Bali-After-months-voice<wbr>-triggers-signs-life.html</wbr></wbr></wbr>        No.     How's this then? Just removed the two other things, but I insist on keeping the giraffe.     The real Minato, the one in the coma, literally gets out of bed and transforms when his potential crystal is returned to him. He also loses his power when Kaicho takes that crystal away from him, promising to give the other Minato a chance to exist in another universe.  There were two Minatos, one from Subaru's world and another from a world that ceased to be.       That is good. I think there are enough versions now to satisfy everyone anyways.     And then the one that appears in that scene tells Subaru "That was the real me". Magical Minato is not coma Minato.   I just find out one of writer of this show is a seiyuu, and she voiced Nanako's mother in pleiades  https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9<wbr>C%A8%E6%9D%91%E3%81%AF%E3%82%8B%E3%<wbr>81%8B</wbr></wbr>      tears are a sign of a comatose person's brain functions beginning to work again, which means he will probably regain consciousness soon   Goddamn it, anon. I love you.      Talk about multi-talented.    Real version for who ever wants it. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CvF<wbr>H_6DNRCY</wbr>  [ ]     Magical Minato is all of the Minatos up until this point together, so he technically is coma Minato.   WHERE IS THE SOUNDTRACK      Magical Minato is not coma Minato.   This. Magical Minato was the result of Minato's potential mixed with the alien's magic. Real Minato has been in bed all the time. It's likely he himself has never actually met Subaru.         It's likely he himself has never actually met Subaru.   I think they did as kids. But then he was probably moved to intensive care, which is why Subaru doesn't find him in his usual room anymore afterwards        Lets not bring too much realism into this, the body of someone who was 7 years in a coma might not be able to ever function normally again.      He's holding the paper star given to him by Subaru while he was using magic. He definitely has met Subaru and he definitely has used magic.     If he was in coma for 7 years he will have the mind of a child once he wakes up. I'd rather imagine his mind being that of magical Minato, otherwise things are going to get very ugly, see also  .     this makes me feel po-warm   We need a fucking ova    Lets not bring too much realism into this    Brings realism into this        He's holding the paper star given to him by Subaru   That's true and what   said about being moved to intensive care seems like a satisfying way to explain why they stop meeting up.     Post swimsuits, please     the body of someone who was 7 years in a coma might not be able to ever function normally again.   Magic, anon, magic.       They must have, because coma Minato still has the paper star that Subaru gave him.   At some point he went into the coma, and that's when the normal and magical Minato diverged. Magical Minato separate from coma Minato is that lingering potential that should have been lost, but wasn't. The 1% chance of getting better, that apparently might come true because he never gave up hope.  That's the little potential he entrusted to Subaru, because he placed his hopes in her.          You seem confused.    that fucking cat    Thank you, this is what I need   Subaru is one of the best Mahou Shoujo leads. I still can't believe how amazing she was during the kiss.   He wasn't actually in a coma for 7 years, though. His room got scattered with potential crystals and grew into the greenhouse, so he spent a good deal of that time doing gardening work. It wasn't until episode 6 when the potential crystals ran out of juice that he went back to being in a coma.     I don't think there's enough support for C.      I still can't believe how amazing she was during the kiss.  Minato pls go. You have a coma to be waking up from.    I like Nanako's voice.  Really surprised by this series. I spent each episode waiting for them to irrevocably fuck it up, but they didn't. They didn't even make a heavy handed ending, forcing some final meeting between Subaru and Minato, it was really nice.  Kudos to Gainax, shame that their times are done.      Why is everyone convinced Gainax is done for? If anything this show should gove us hope.     It's more like the fall would have put him into a coma because his potential is gone and must converge with the 'real' coma potential.    We'll have to see how it sells. I hope they're not done for - I seem to be among the minority that have liked their recent works.    I thought they fucked up a bit going all 2deep4u especially concerning Minato.   So why did hobbie subs take so long for this episode in the end, I was ready to download the raw.   Their translator has suddenly collapsed, HS leader had to find a new one.  Crunchy fucked up for unknown reason, and whoever rips it for HS was asleep or simply forgot.      There seem to have been some rumblings about the last of their staff going separate ways soon, though nothing completely confirmed. The implication seems to be that the studio will be calling it quits, and they haven't announce any new projects yet so even if they aren't done for good, they're certainly going to be MIA for a while.  In a way, it feels like the ending to Pleiades mirrors the ending to Gainax itself. How fitting that what very well might be their parting work finally sticks its landing after an entire history of off-the-deep-end gainax endings.       But it was tactful and rather straightfoward albeit not entirely clear.      tears are a sign of a comatose person's brain functions beginning to work again, which means he will probably regain consciousness soon   P-Powarm....       The delay seemed to be with CR, from what I gathered. If HS was the one being slow, then we would've attracted shitposting from CR shills claiming they got to watch it first.     That's a bit too specific. There's nothing that states that potentials converge if they end up in the same fate (if that did indeed happen). Remember Pres says to him that he's always been in coma. His lost his potential because he ended up in a world with no potential.    Crunchy was still 16 hours late, but it took about 8 more hours for HS to release it.      How could it take hobbie 8 hours to release, do they even do anything at all?       It was a conspiracy intended to maks us reflect on how gold this show was before we bid our farewells     Like I said, they either forgot or whoever rips it was asleep. I actually thought it's an automatic process.    This show was far too good for us, I had a great time discussing astrophysics and pondering the vastness of the universe with you guys. OST when?   They're probably saving that for the movie. It needs extra content or no one will go and see it.    When the crystals ran out, he went back to having always been in a coma.    There's more than enough. Mahou Minato does fail to capture a fragment. He lands in Subaru's world afterwards since we know that Coma Minato = Subaru's Minato and that the Minato he sees is not him (more than enough evidence to prove this).    It is an automatic process with specific set times, you god damn retards. How new are you?   That beach scene was a happier End of Eva   Sorry for not knowing the in-depth mechanics of "subgroup" that I try to avoid most of the time.     movie   I thought that wasn't happening anymore       There's nothing that states that potentials converge if they end up in the same fate  Not the same anon, but that's just kind of common sense. If you end up the same way in 2 separate worlds, then both 'you' followed the same potential, and the other potentials were discarded. If 2 worlds follow the same potentials, then they;re essentially the same world. At that point there might as well only be one, and not 2. All of Minato's alternate worlds converged, one by one, because when they followed the same potential, the ceased to be alternate entirely.  In the end, only 2 potentials were left to Minato; sickness unto death or recovery. Magical Minato was the tiny, wavering potential for the latter. His quest to 'disappear from this world' was Minato succumbing to hopelessness; the potential to recover disappearing as he surrendered to his fate of never recovering, and Minato himself disappearing from this world as he sinks into his unrecoverable coma and dies.  Subaru embraced that potential of Minato's, prevented his descent into despair and reinforced his hope in recovery.          forcing some final meeting between Subaru and Minato  They didn't need to force a meeting between them but they could have at least hinted that he would wake up. Have his eyes open or his hand move or something. Fuck.       they could have at least hinted that he would wake up.  See:       On one hand, I really want to see the girls happy and some fluff between Minato and Subaru like Tamako Market movie.  On the other hand, I get the feeling it would be empty without magic and the alien  ;_; , but bringing back magic would ruin the ending of the show since they lost their memories.       No. You can be completely the same, while your best friend is just slightly different, for example having a single body hair more during his 30th birthday. That by itself is a completely different world.     That by itself is a completely different world.  Because it followed a different potential.     Oh. Well never mind then.    But that means one thing can be exactly the same in infinite number of different universes with just something else being a little or more different than the other ones.    But how do you know that coma minato like wasn't like that prior to failing to capture the fragment? Couldn't Subaru see him as mahou Minato cause she also posses potential (hence the whole "we're being watched" scene).   Minato will be ok, right? He won't be a potato forever  right?     He was crying. He'll wake up. He had Subaru's star. Subaru had his jacket. I think they might even remember each other. I'm pretty sure coma Minato was crying happy tears because he had his memories.  That's what I'm going to believe and no one can stop me.        they're essentially the same world  That's the thing, they're not really. There are clear differences between the two Minato's so by the point that the first Minato fails to capture a fragment, he should already be on a different path than coma Minato. They shouldn't merge because they end up in the same fate (if the first Minato even ended up in a coma) unless forced to by an outside force. They're two separate worlds with similar potentials, but not the same.   Minato's alternate worlds converged one by one because one world was a part of himself and another was one that had entered his own world and couldn't escape from it.       I'm a huge yurifag but I thought that Minato/Subaru were a cute couple. I also like how it's implied that they may be able to meet again unlike the ONA's "but now I must go" bullshit.   I can't believe I nearly didn't watch this show, I only picked it up by chance as the picture from the synopsis looked nice and the space parts seemed cool. Episode 1 was in my downloads for weeks and weeks and I nearly deleted it without watching, but ended up watching it and found it really comfy, then downloaded the rest of the eps with the intention of watching slowly, but by the end of episode 2 with the lovely visuals and them flying around I could stop then 3 was even better and 4 was great and 5 with Saturns rings, it was just amazing. I can't wait for the BD's so I can watch it again, need to watch the OVA's too. Definitely the biggest surprise of the season.   Look at it this way: There can be an infinite number of different universes with an infinite number of differen potentials.  However, if, in every single one of those universe, 1 potential was followed (Minato coma), then from the perspective of an observer for whom that potential outcome and that outcome alone concerns, those universes are effectively identical. A potential that changes the way Minato's hairs are arranged is irrelevant to Subaru as an observer, so to Subaru, 2 universes where the 'coma' potential was followed, but 2 separate 'hair arrangement' potentials were followed are effectively the same universe. In this sense, the observable universes surrounding Minato converged under one potential outcome; coma.  There may be an infinite number of universes with an infinite number of Subarus, each centered around a potential outcome from a choice that she made (eg. which school did I go to). For Minato, his potentials were restricted by things beyond his control, beyond the conscious will of himself or of anyone else, so all of those infinite different Minatos converged on one outcome; coma. That convergence meant that every potential outcome which was not coma was discarded, one by one, as each different universe Minato homogenized under a single outcome. In the end, the only unused potential remaining was that slim hope of recovery, and that was the magical Minato.  His potentials converged because the outcome was one entirely beyond his or anybody else's control. It didn't matter what he did before falling into a coma, nothing he or anyone else did could prevent it. Minor variations int he form that world took created by the differing actions and experiences of different Minatos did not change the immutable fact that he would always arrive in a coma.           He likely wasn't because in this episode, the Minato who was part of magical Minato that recognized the President was Dark Minato. There's nothing to suggest that coma Minato ever failed to capture a fragment or went chasing after crystallized potential. We never saw him with crystallized potential outside of his own star that he gave to Subaru.    Let me stop you and just say no.    I'm glad you understood.    I bet after Subaru fell asleep Minato masturbated over her body to pass the time.    they see your drive shaft    That moon slowly moving to eclipse the setting sun was beautiful.   So /a/... Is the redhead that appeared with Aoi Minato (I saw that coma part, but I was wondering it was some kind of shenanigans)?    they see your 10 billion year old planet.      You mean the girl? No, she was Aoi's friend from her new school. We saw her during the first Aoi episode.     Why is he so fucked up?    I doubt it, but if that really was the Subaru from magical Aoi's timeline that went to the new school and left magical Aoi behind, now united with the non-magical Aoi that left Subaru behind, then it would've been 10/10.    No. She's the friend of Aoi that appeared in episode one before the world merging. Minato has always been in a hospital.      Itsuki the one that wanted to burst in on them and see them kissing most covers her eyes when she sees them kissing   This was super cute though, it's nice to see a main girl actually have a proper love interest that actually reaches a conclusion and not end ambiguously.         This is the first actual kissu this season, is it not? I can't think of any others.      There's a difference between another world and another potential. Not every potential comes into existence, the crystals are physical manifestations of the potentials that never came to be. Subaru and the other girls come from different worlds, the two Minatos come from different potentials within Subaru's world.  When Minato chose to be something, all of his other potential futures were lost and there was a 0% chance of him ever becoming something other than what he was. At least in that universe, in another universe that potential could blossom into something else.       It was just so nice to see her taking initiative in a modest way and not being the super binary "trembling damsel waiting for her love interest to notice her" or "turboslut flopping her tits over the MC" that is so common.  After their first kissu I was really rooting for Subaru to win the guy. She was such a good protagonist.       Please someone make a sound webm of this, currently on a toaster that doesn't let me.     Subaru will take care of him whatever happens.    Hell, i discarded it as the crappy magical girls anime of the season. I started watching only after episode 6, and only because people in WEG threads were describing it as Astrophysics: the anime. Man was i surprised. AOTS for me, no doubt.       Itsuki is so sexual.    This was the one and only thing i disliked about the ending, and you fixed it. I fucking love you anon.    Their drive shafts are touching!   This was a very successful commercial. Good work, Subaru.  ;_;   Is there a Mahou Shoujo airing next season? Excluding Illya   http://a.uguu.se/yypaef_shishi.webm<wbr> sound included. </wbr>    Yeah, looked pretty realistic too     Is uguu down, I can't view it? Just gives a connection error?       It's you    Godspeed anon.   Try downloading it.      So Subaru nendoroid when, I really need one Subaru is absoloutley adorable.  So why was Nanako's ep called Nanako 13?   It was her 13th birthday.   I feel empty now that it finished. Never expected it to be my favorite show this season but it did just that. Really glad I stuck with it.     I think uguu's SSL is fucked, works fine over http.      Looks like something from hdwallpapers.com   Raws are up http://www.mangakaka.com/World_Trig<wbr>ger/107</wbr>  Looks like Kaguera Squad was an A-Rank squad as well. Also I'm surprised to see more Akane.   I love the way that the snipers acted  I think that the top5 squads are A-ranks reserves      So Arashiyama will be his teacher? That's cool, I guess more Kitora for us    Who dis?  Is Chika finally gonna get her own rival?      Who wouldn't want more of her?  I think right now Arashiyama is teaching osamu the different ways a shooter/gunner can attack and work with it's team  Right now yuma is the driving factor of his strategies and right now what he wants to do is be able to work on the same playing field as him and not just survive but help  This is one of he reason why I love Osamu as a character because his struggle for strength is understandable and doesn't make him annoying unlike all of the times it has been done before.    Looks like it, I am guessing he is going to be a more "Shoot to kill' type person compared to Chika more softer personallity             I like that Izuho still had the cat on her head. And that it moved to Isami's head.     I think he will also get some lessons from Izumi. Karasuma acted like he wanted him to see both.   Who was the sniper that made the drawings? Narasaka? He somehow looks different.   He isn't wearing his headphones   Is this less boring now?   Yes    It is a slow boil that I got through only because I am a huge Sci-fy fag    Yes he is, they are on his neck just the scans are so shitty that it is hard to see    We still only normally see him when he has them on his ears. It is probably why he looks different.   Summary from p-kun, posted on MAL:  Not an info heavy chapter.  HQ: - Osamu is sent to see Arashiyama and Izumi. Chika has joint sniper practice. Yuuma wants to rank battle.  Arashiyama Team War Room: - The team is busy because the number of applications increase since Mikumo/Kido leaked the rescue plan. Intake is not once in 4 months, but becomes once a month now. Satori is in the joint practice. - Arashiyama questions Osamu's lust for solo points. He says that the point of shooter/gunner position is not for taking points solo. Their weapons are underpowered to begin with, especially because shields are getting better. Even during the time when shield was bad, shooters/gunners are pretty much dead meat against good attackers like Kou or Yuuma. - The advantages of shooters/gunners are distance attacks and ability to support allies. So, use it to to control situation or lure enemies to be finished by allies. Izumi is really good at the later. - Osamu has shown some level of this. Arashiyama also says that there's no point learning small tricks that may change the good habit that Osamu has built. - Osamu is upset that Karasuma's mindset was right - So Arashiyama agrees to train him (probably about teamwork and such)  Sniper training room: - Izuho is looking for a mentor - A boy (Ema Yuzuru) cleans up booths for them to use, removing Touma's belongings. - Akane comes and fawns at Izuho's cat, which jumps on Touma's pompadour - Training ends, Chika is rank 24, Izuho 47, Narasaka (Akane's mentor) ranks 1 as always. He hits dead center in every shot. Touma draws a smiley with his shots (which is why Narasaka is always no. 1 in joint practice), Yuzuru draws a star. - Narasaka says that points do not indicate sniper ranks, as there are unorthodox snipers like Yuzuru and Touma. Yuzuru is introduced as B-2 Kageura team sniper.                      The cat has great taste in husbandos   Oh that makes more sense! sorry I didn't realize that is what you meant    I wonder what Narasaka means when he says that Touma and Yuzuru are unorthodox    Fuck Osamu just keeps getting told that he is an idiot   I wonder if he might go to hyuse for some help or something?      So Arashiyama believes that gunners/shooters are better for support than actually raking up points? I'm guessing that obviously Izumi and Ninomiya have the opposite mindset.    They probably shine better on the field than in practice.     I think it means something like they have the ability to use their precision in an unusual way  So instead of hitting a target one way they are able to do something else      I'm not sure exactly what's going on here without translations, but I assume someone is going to eat their hat.   How does one acquire a headcat?      It's more that Osamu feels pressured to be more than support on the battlefield. Arashiyama wants to teach him to be a better support shooter.    It means that they are only spending time drawing on shooting practice, or that are unconvencional sniper ala Chika?   I thought something like that   Real life cats are assholes           Fuck Osamu just keeps getting told that he is an idiot  He probably gonna fuck up in the coming rank battle but not before he feels that the advice given before to him are wrong. Im gonna enjoy his delicious tears.     No, I think this is more of a case of that they are better snipers when it matters. Sort of like the scene in American Sniper where he could shoot a snake better than a target board at the same distance away.     God I love the way that osamu's character is written, he is weak yet doesn't come off as useless, his desire and struggle to become stronger is something that is relocatable     I completely agree with you  I said this before but what I think is gonna happen is that yuma/chika are gonna get a bunch of points in the beginning and then osamu is gonna try to support and fuck up hard because of that fuck up yuma and chika are gonna die so the rank battle becomes a fight for survival for osamu to wait for the timer to end and get the 2 survival points      I think Osamu can pull a victory if he doubles down on support tactics. He already has a knack for it.    That looks like some final chapter looking characters    lol osamu is such a looser    No. Shut up. Don't wanna hear it.    I hope the manga end soon its so bad.. Really who read this shiet?    O-okay?  here is some best girl fanart to show peace      Osamu's in that situation where everyone tells him he's doing fine and to keep doing like he always has, but he feels that it isn't good enough. Given that, he'll probably fuck up during the battle by overperforming, but then make a comeback after realizing everyone was right.      are you even trying?      Yes. Good tastes. Thank you.   I am curious, leaving aside how much will take them to become A rank, what will be the emblem of Tamakoma-2?   Some random ideas: Replica, Osamu glasses, =3=, chika antenna hair thing or the last three combined in diferents part of the emblen     I am guessing it is going to do something with peace    good taste    Yeah, it's definitely two different ideologies at work, and both probably have their pros and cons. It should probably be noted that p-kun's comments separate from the summary, suggest Osamu may still be going to see Izumi.   Personally I'd say Osamu needs both skill sets. He needs to be able to excel as support for Yuma and Chika. If they're taken out, or he's cut off from them, he needs to be able to excel on his own.    So, a glasses wearing Replica with Chika's antenna hair?          So, a glasses wearing Replica with Chika's antenna hair?  Beatiful     A Replica homage would be awesome    Damn, I hate spoiling myself yet I want to discuss new shit with you guys. I would be so happy if WT got translation in like 24h.     I just wait for the viz release on mondays  It makes bus rides so much faster     How will the world react to Doflamingos downfall?  Which Yonko saga will the story lead to next? Kaido or Big Mom?     Dellinger.   Horrible chapter. I mean, really, what the fuck. It's nothing major in the grand scheme of thing but is Oda actually trying to lose time? I am not angry at the celebrations, I am angry when nothing of value in the entire chapter happens.    I'm still wondering, with ALL of the Yonkos, the World Goverment, Dragon, Vegapunk, Raftel and the bigass war afterwards... How are we already at 60% again? We're quite literally at the beginning of the New World.    Probably some fast workers at the Colosseum. Take a stencil and a quick spray job and you've got shirts for whoever wins.     Rebecca   Didn't pulled out much in any fight   Only specialty: Push anyone nearby to water   If I gonna see her doing this everytime I am out        strongest servant   Nasu really fucked up with the servant shit. Should've tossed out UBW and Fate and instead wrote Ilya and Taiga routes.     &gt;&gt;UBW counters and copies NPs faster then GoB can summon them    Suddenly Shirou becomes a master at his UBW while a proper servant like Gil still sucks at his GOB.  That's why I said Shirou has a plot armor. I know that he has Tohsaka's magic and all so that there will be material to make excuses but it still a shitty way to have Gil lost.      How much agi you need to evading GoB ? B rank ?      Evade it entirely?  EX probably     What did /a/ think of the anime? Will there be an S2?   Oh you mean the actual shipgirl, sorry    What else would it be? As far as I know this is not /k/.     Why would you say people but than act as if you were talking about the real ship?     Kaga only looks down on the 5th CarDiv, and it's for their own good so they don't get cocky and sink.    Marrying Yuugumo is like marrying your own mother   Where are my spoilers?!   Are they fading too, like my powers?      From what we've seen she can make her hands really big.     not this costume  you had one job Horikoshi     That looks terrible. What color is Tetsu's hair anyway? I would guess blue or white.    She can make bodyparts grow  Specially dicks      So neito will copy her quirck and fuck her with his giant dick   Would you?   Looks like it, but I suspect he will show up in flashbacks and maybe as a Force ghost.   Yukano a cutest    and maybe as a Karate ghost  Fixed that for you.     I think it's the one they put the most effort in so far.   Has there ever been a more visually offensive design choice than these neon green outlines?</blockquote>]
