It highlights new words in blue and words you had to look up before in yelllow, so its very easy to check<br><br> It's a paid service, but if you refer yourself 20 times, (you can pick any random email, no verification needed ) you can get 2000 words you don't know before paying, which is a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't force yourself to use a J-J dictionary unless you're at the level where it actually helps you.

Only add words at the pace you actually go through them, leaving a couple days worth as a buffer.

I don't read the LNs and I don't know what happens in them but I want to see Utaha-senpai win next season.  <br>Good for Spyro, but I'm sure luck is on his side for that.</br>  Can someone tell me why Megumi goes along with his nonsense? She doesn't even know him and she does every time consuming and boring thing he asks. For what purpose?  <br><br>So do I.</br></br>  <br> meta tsundere </br>  <br>I don't disagree.</br>  <br><br>Because she loves him, silly.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember whether it's she's lonely or she likes him or both.</br>  <br>Read vol.8. She's grown too attached to the circle.</br>  <br>Utaha. Megumi is best girl overall though.</br>  <br>The one on the right, obviously.</br>  <br>I'd say this is exactly the moment in which she seals her victory. There is nothing greater than an emotional meeting that heals his broken heart.</br>    Down  <br>Up, up, and awaaaaaay!<br> Into Eriri full force, aw yeah. </br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt. <br><br> Eriri a shit. </br></br>   picking either <br> not picking literal perfection </br>    <br>There is only one answer. My goddess Eriri.</br>  <br> green panties <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br> Not living in moderation </br>  Most people are going to pick down or the plain slut<br><br>I like up but I know these threads are only for shitposting so my opinion doesn't matter<br><br>I'm out this bitch, pce</br></br></br></br>  I've masturbated to this so many times.  <br><br>You better not have fapped to Megumi. She's supposed to be pure.</br></br>   Doubting perfection   <br><br>We never did.</br></br>  <br> generic tsundere #1023039913231876 <br> perfection </br></br>  <br>I never did though.</br>  <br>I love this meme</br>  <br> meme </br>  <br><br>It's not a meme. If someone were to ask another person to describe Eriri's character, the most they could say is that she's a tsundere. That's not perfection.</br></br>  <br>See pic related<br><br><br>IF someone were to ask me to describe Eriri's character, I would say that she's the best girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a good way to discredit yourself. I like it.</br>  <br> IF someone were to ask me to describe Eriri's character, I would say that she's the best girl. <br><br>And you would be wrong. Her character development pales in comparison to the rest of the cast's.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And if I happen to be a tsundere enthusiast? Why can't I like what I like instead of having people shit all over it? If someone likes eating shit then let them eat shit.</br></br>  <br>"A formerly dependent and weak girl slowly growing into a strong-willed artist who's more at ease with herself around others" is probably what Maruto expected people to think of Eriri. It was kinda the point of GS and vol 8.<br><br><br>Eriri and Tomoya are two characters who have developed the most though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eriri is third place, first is Tomoya since the series is from his POV and second is pic related. Of course, all the character development in this series is great.</br></br>  <br>I want to know nips opinion about this development. Because if people turn to hate her even more, it will become an irony.</br>  <br><br>Eriri is still weak and selfish. <br><br> thinks Tomoya doesn't hold a grudge against her anymore <br> thinks she still has a say in who joins the circle despite leaving <br> still self-conscious about Izumi and how she might surpass her <br><br>And then there's this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Utaha <br> Generic harsh kuudere sepnai #1831823 <br> Megumi <br> Generic normal and dull boring girl #1238123 </br></br></br></br>  <br> Megumi <br> Generic normal and dull boring girl #1238123 <br><br>Nice bait. That's Onodera you're describing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She has a severe superiority complex.</br>  <br>Megumi hasn't developed that much. She's largely been the same since vol 6, pushing herself too hard to be someone she isn't.<br><br><br>They don't hate her (not like what we have here anyway), and some even think Eriri might win in the end because Maruto has reset her and Tomoya's relationship (basically they speculate there might be another vol 6 all over again).</br></br></br></br>  <br> pushing herself too hard to be someone she isn't. <br><br>How is she doing that? Her relationship with Tomoya is the most natural one in the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Out of the three principal girls, Eriri is dead last in terms of popularity.</br>  <br> Eriri might win in the end because Maruto has reset her and Tomoya's relationship (basically they speculate there might be another vol 6 all over again). <br><br>But that's not possible. If Eriri wins then her career as an artist over. If anything, she might give up on Tomoya romantically in a couple of volumes like Utaha did.</br></br></br>  <br> bait <br>It's not bait when it describes her to a tee.</br></br>  <br> Eriri is still weak and selfish <br>She is a flawed character but still the best.</br></br>  <br><br>She's only normal and dull if you're completely blind. Does this look anything like "dull?"</br></br>  <br>Speaking of Utaha, is her spinoff canon?</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>It is bait when it describes your post to a tee.</br>  <br> pales in comparison <br> Literally is one, if not is the most developed girl before volume 7 <br>Disliking tsundere doesn't mean you can make up horseshit, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a rhetorical question?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br>Then you are blind.</br></br>  Best  <br>That's shame. I thought it was perfect prequel for her and morals-kun.</br>  <br><br>Eriri's development is good, great even. But it's just not the best. She is still a bitch.</br></br>  <br>What's the problem? Eriri has always been a balance of strong and weak. That one of her main appeals. Removing either one for the other entirely isn't good for her. Eriri's resolve and goals have evolved, that's the change in her. Her strong mentality towards those objectives that makes her stubborn remains, but she isn't as full of pride as she used to be and can apologize for her mistakes as seen in volume 6.</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah, and Eriri isn't a tsundere, amirite?</br></br>  <br>She's become very controlling so the circle won't fall apart, but it's not who she really is. Iori comments on that in vol 8.<br><br><br>It's possible because Tomoya says someday he might understand creators like Eriri and become like them too. But yeah I don't see it happening before Maruto wraps everthing up unless he pulls another "5 years late".</br></br></br></br>  <br> bitch <br>Not to Tomoya. She still fights with Utaha and that is a good thing.</br></br>  <br> she isn't as full of pride as she used to be and can apologize for her mistakes as seen in volume 6. <br><br>Then why does she need Tomoya to get her to apologize to Megumi?</br></br></br>  <br>*later</br>  <br><br>Utaha is her closest ally.</br></br>  <br>Eriri is a cookie-cutter generic tsundere with nothing that makes her stand out among the large pool of existing tsunderes.</br>  <br>Eh your words are too good to her. It's Tomoya idea, so she basically stand there doing nothing.</br>  <br> She's become very controlling so the circle won't fall apart <br><br>That was mainly because of Tomoya's screw-up in volume 6. Eriri and Utaha would have left whether or not Megumi was in the circle. <br><br> Iori comments on that in vol 8. <br><br>Is that when he called her 重い?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Explain why you think Megumi is "boring."</br></br>  <br>Because neither Eriri nor Megumi is willing to do anything about it.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, and if Eriri learned her lesson in volume 6 then she'd know that she should apologize. But nope, she doesn't because she's scared. Even in volume 7 when Megumi confronts her she tries to excuse herself by saying that Megumi left too.</br></br>  <br>I assume Megumi is first and Utaha second, right?<br><br>If so, Japan has pretty damn good tastes for once.</br></br></br>  <br>He screwed up since vol 1. That's why he's trying to do things differently this time.</br>  <br>Megumi is a cookie-cutter generic normal girl with nothing that makes her stand out among the large pool of existing normal girls.<br><br><br>You first. Explain your meme.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty clear in vol 8 that Eriri is more friendly to Megumi than the other way around. Given their situation, it makes more sense for a third party like Tomoya to arrange something for them.</br>  <br><br><br>What are you guys talking about? Why would Eriri or anything between her and Megumi need apologizing for? Isn't the deal between then all just one big misunderstanding with each side thinking the other might not consider the other as friends anymore? It's not like either one dislikes each other. Eriri in particular is pessimistic and Megumi is lonely enough to miss her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Megumi is a bit snarky, she's not afraid to speak her mind. She's also passionate considering she picked up programming so that she could be useful to the circle. She's a nice girl that cares for her friends a lot, but she's also assertive and actually gets mad when she's wronged. <br><br>And that's just off the top of my head. Your average normal girl is like Onodera who I can only describe as a moeblob.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There aren't even many girls similar to Megumi, and much less as main girls of a harem series. <br><br>Eriri is literally a carboncopied character. The author didn't even have to try come up with her personality or design.</br></br></br>  Up and Down<br>And in the end it's only round and round and round<br><br>Haven't you heard it's a battle of words<br>the poster bearer cried<br><br>Listen son, said the man with the gun<br>There's room for you inside</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Megumi and Eriri don't understand each other since one is a creator and the other isn't. Even Tomoya said that Eriri should apologize to Megumi during their webchat.</br></br>  <br>Eriri was the one who abandoned the circle and didn't even have the decency of telling Megumi about it. The most she could muster up was telling her via Tomoya, but that's still pretty shitty from her.</br>  <br><br>I know right. Could a single person here name a girl like Megumi?</br></br>  <br>Tsundere can behave differently and have different personality drives. It doesn't mean they aren't "generic" by their archetype. Megumi was made with the model of your typical normal/dull/plain/boring girl. The author's twist is to spin it so she is the main girl, which is rare since those types are very rarely main girls. They usually are background or secondary heroines <br><br><br> Don't explain and support why <br> I'll just keep calling her that <br>Nice. And with that, your post is as valid as mine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Megumi was made with the model of your typical normal/dull/plain/boring girl <br><br>Except she is not plain or boring at all. That was only Tomoya's initial vision of her because he was too dense to realize her true beauty. In a way, it's meta commentary. Someone dense wouldn't realize how great of a girl she is, but someone who actually paid attention would see her true value. Look at her now, does she seem "boring?"</br></br></br>  <br>As of the current volume? She's not as interesting as she was before that's for sure.</br>  All around  <br><br>Why? We're finally seeing her darker side.</br></br>  <br>Your post isn't even valid at all. Eriri is a checklist on every popular cliche a tsundere can have<br> popular <br> talented <br> special snowflake <br> half gaijin <br> childhood friend <br> cartoonish, telegraphed tsundere act that is obvious to everyone but the MC <br><br>She's so generic it hurts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know it is bad when even the anime reuses her scenes in two different episodes.</br>  <br>That's honestly not what makes her interesting as a character though, and that's just a result of her overexerting herself. She's a nice girl through and through, which is probably why the whole "dark Megumi" is treated like a running gag.</br>  <br> that pantsu line </br>  <br>More or less, she still keeps to her archtype. Megumi barely changed, she's still generally indifferent and dull for lacking exciting attributes in spite of taking interest in making games. And jokes about her being scary means little since they are exaggerations and not her actual character. <br><br><br> Dull <br> Average <br> Doesn't stand out <br> Plain and simple but super beauty when get noticed <br> Typically the nice girl MC befriends <br> Fills quota for normal girl <br>Megumi is generic as it gets.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> which is probably why the whole "dark Megumi" is treated like a running gag. <br><br>Only about half the time. Volume 7 angry Megumi wasn't a joke.</br></br></br>  <br> indifferent <br> dull <br> lacking exciting attributes <br><br>These are all lies. She is anything but indifferent. Even in S1, it's obvious that she cares about the game just as much as Tomoya does. When Tomoya betrayed her trust in volume 6, she was genuinely angry. Someone indifferent wouldn't do that. And really, does this look like someone indifferent?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her being angry and her being an insincere (which what they joke about in vol 8) are completely different things.</br>  <br><br>Megumi wasn't insincere in volume 7. She was just angry Tomoya neglected her in the game.</br></br>   This thread <br>I see Megumifags are delusional about their oh so super unique and original girl. And of course starting shit.</br>  <br>Actually the whole "average girl that isn't really average" gimmick is pretty unique. Far less generic than a tsundere being tsundere for the sake of being tsundere.</br>  <br><br>It took you long enough to show up, Eririfag. Always starting shit up as usual.</br></br>  <br>It isn't their fault she's a much fresher character compared to the walking stereotypes surrounding her.</br>  <br> Gets called out <br> Trying to shift the blame <br>Megumifags as usual.<br><br><br> Muh excuse for shitposting </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said she was insincere in vol 7. I only said the joke they throw around about Megumi in vol 8 is about her being a deceitful person.</br>  <br><br>You're the only who got called out, Eririfag, for your awful shitposting against Megumi.</br></br>  <br> shitposting <br><br>More like you can't handle the banter. Everything must be a super serious argument for you Eririfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, but I can't remember Megumi being deceitful. She seems like an honest girl to me.</br></br>  Aren't we all friends here?  <br>The others joke that Megumi seems like a nice person on the outside but is actually the scheming type (like Michiru saying she kicked out Eriri and Utaha).</br>  <br>This is an all-out battlefield where only the strongest wins.</br>  <br>You're the one getting called out, delusional Megumifag.<br><br><br>Banter would mean it's lighthearted and not serious. It is always serious and rage worthy for you Megumifags. See this thread and all the other times you guys started shit first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So best cake Akane?</br>  <br>Threads without the Eriri defense force are very lighthearted though.</br>  <br> Saekano threads without Eriri <br><br>Why...would such threads exist...?</br></br></br>  <br>More like any threads without Megumifags shitposting is a nice thread.</br>  <br> ... <br> ... <br>Eririfags, everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>You should ask that to the fans. We've had a handful of nice threads without a single Eririfag posting.<br><br><br>But Eririfags are the biggest shitposters in the fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure what you're implying but the periods can be used in that matter.</br>  <br>No. LNfags and even Tomoya himself has noted and said that Megumi's typical persona is being indifferent. Megumi having some moments where she reacts doesn't change the fact her general disposition is indifference.<br><br><br> pretty unique <br>What is it, variants of Cinderella or ugly duckling? Not really at all. Less common still means generic.<br><br><br>Honestly, it they wouldn't as obnoxious and combative if they could just accept that Megumi is in the same boat as the others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> biggest shitposters <br>That's Megumifags, being the worst shitposters for exactly the stated reasons.</br></br>  <br> Cinderella or ugly duckling <br>See, you have to look outside even Japanese media to find a plausible comparison. The point about her being unique, refreshing and innovative for a harem series still remains. You don't have to try so hard to deny that fact and imply she is anywhere near as generic as the typical tsundere and kuudere that you can see better executed in other VN/LN/manga/anime.</br></br>  <br>Kosaki</br>  <br> this Eririfag in denial is at it again </br>  <br> No. LNfags and even Tomoya himself has noted and said that Megumi's typical persona is being indifferent. <br><br>That's only her outside appearance. Once you get to know her even a little bit, you'll see how she is anything but indifferent. Tomoya is dense, anyone he can't pigeonhole as something like a tsundere or kuudere is flat according to him.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Megumifags don't shitpost. They only call out other people, namely Eririfags, on their shit..</br></br>  <br>Kosaki is nothing like Megumi.<br><br>First of all, since the start of this series you already see Megumi doing things that Kosaki will never be able to in her whole life, like engaging in a completely casual yet bold conversation with the MC without dropping her spaghetti or flustering like a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she's not in the same fucking boat, no matter how hard you spin it. <br><br> b-b--but she's just like Kosaki <br>Which is fucking bullshit because one is a spaghetti incarnate and the other one is a calm and collected person. Okay, the calm one might be debatable, but you get the gist of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Megumifags are the worst. They are worse than Senafags who at least admit to shitposting due to heir hate for Yozora.<br><br><br>Keep proving my point, shitposter.<br><br><br> Militant posting throwing shit/worst/attacking Eriri unprovoked <br> don't shitpost.  <br>Delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you replying to yourself? It's funny how there's always two mysterious posters always agreeing with each other but in other threads there isn't even one.<br><br>Your bait won't work here.</br></br></br>  <br> discussing characters = attacking </br>  Has there ever been a Saenai thread that actually discussed the show? Not just non-stop funposting and best girl arguments.   you will never be as angry as Eririfags   <br><br>Saekano threads frequently discuss the characters, Contrast to Yahari threads which is nothing but faggotry.</br></br>  <br>How can Sena &gt; Yozora not be a fact?</br>  <br>Yeah. For example, see the recent volume 8 threads. Coincidentally, barely any Eririfags were seen and thus the threads were nice.</br>  <br>A lot, mainly ones without eririfags barging in and being so fucking angry. You can check the vol.8 spoiler thread in the archive for example.</br>  <br> Anyone who disagrees is samefag <br>Typical Megumifag. There was another two Eririfags you replied to who wasn't me. Stay mad.<br><br><br>How is any of that discussing character? <br><br><br> What is opinions <br>Worst fans alright.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> another two Eririfags <br><br>Who also happen to share your writing style and argumentation. How rare.</br></br></br>  <br> How is any of that discussing character?  <br> half the thread is discussing Eriri's character development </br></br>  <br>Just ignore him.</br>  <br>Down. So damn hard.</br>  <br>Man, I thought Yahari threads would get better after the anime ended, and oh boy how wrong I was.</br>  <br>Prove it.<br><br><br>Nice red herring ignoring shitposts that isn't discussing. You can't deny Megumifags flaming and starting shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I once tried going into one of the threads. It was pretty much nothing but reposts and the same shit over and over again. At least Saekano threads are relatively fresh.</br></br>  <br> Prove it <br><br>Your use of greentext gives you away. Also certain typos.</br></br></br>    Why is Archer somehow popular again?<br><br> I should never have become a hero. <br><br>What's there to like about a self-loathing guy like that eternally whining over his ideals?<br><br>There are plenty of other heroes who met horrible ends without any complaints.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's true, his whining is kind of pathetic.</br>  <br>This. I also want to know</br>  Congratulations anon. You're actually thinking for yourself.  Shit, do you think diarmuid is gonna go back in time to kill himself? He seems to get fucked a lot too.  <br>Archer's suffering literally never ends<br>Being a CG is not the same as being dead</br></br>  <br>Because his blood is iron and his heart is glass.</br>  Because Suwabe voice makes people think with their dicks instead of their heads.  Archer is actually a pretty cool dude in the other routes.<br><br>Like, think of it this way. In the Fate route, he's the standard "cool" guy who dies a heroic death. He's aloof, smarmy, but has a good heart.<br><br>UBW turns that on its head. He's a villain. A guy who's essentially going through a mental breakdown because he wants to kill his past self. With the full context of everything going on, you see that this once cool and collected character actually has some more to him, and that he's got some serious issues under the hood.<br><br>That's what makes him interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this <br>Everyone is gay for ACHAS voice.</br></br>  Einzbern Castle<br>Deathmatch<br>Archer vs Berserker</br></br>  <br>How did a ginger like Shirou with a whiny nasally voice develop that deep manly baritone?</br>  <br>If archer wants to stop being a counter guardian, why don't he win the war and wish the grail for stop being one?</br>  <br>Too much projection.</br>  <br>And in Heaven's Feel, he's even cooler because you know who he is and what he's gone through. And his actions and emotions in the final route speaks volumes.</br>  Did ufo ever tell us what that Archer special thing was? I think it was titled like another holy grail war or something.  Why was the Fate/stay night fanbase disappointed and bitter about the new Unlimited Blade Works adaption?  <br><br>because being a CG is equivalent of being a mod in 4chan</br></br>  <br><br>Really now?</br></br>  <br>Brilliant analogy.</br>  He realized he/Shirou is mentally retarded and there's nothing he can do about it.  <br>top kek</br>  <br> Why is Archer somehow popular again? <br>Because he's got a nice design, a nice voice, cool superpowers, and actually did achieve his goal through being chuuni as fuck. He got exactly what he wanted out of life and died happily. His life after death is what he's referring to when he "whines" and he does not whine often. Outside of Unlimited Blade Works, he hardly gripes about his life at all. In Unlimited Blade Works, he outright says he's just venting, and he feels catharsis through doing so and calms down considerably. <br><br>So what the fuck are you talking about? That small period in the story where he openly acknowledges that everyone who ever told him to stop going down his path in life was right and that he was wrong? What the fuck is wrong with that? It's called hindsight.</br></br></br></br>  Because he's cool, like an old man who is you but from the future and not in a very good mood  <br>can Archer project hotpockets?</br>  <br> That small period in the story <br>That's the problem m8, most people who ask these questions are secondaries, so for them that little part of the story was actually a large part of the anime.</br></br>  He's good but not my favorite<br>Servant rankings:<br> Seiba <br> Cu <br> Medusa <br> EMIYA <br> Goldie <br> Hassan <br> Medea <br> Kojirou <br> Heracles </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Archer is a massive faggot in UBW, Deen/Stay Night is the coolest he's ever been.  <br> Medusa <br><br>The only time Rider is a good character is in porn.</br></br></br>  <br> stick with big tits <br><br>Ehh</br></br></br>  <br> What is Hollow Ataraxia and Heaven's Feel <br><br>Most of her doujins are shit</br></br></br>  <br> What is Hollow Ataraxia and Heaven's Feel <br><br>0/10, you almost got me.</br></br></br>  <br> and Heaven's Feel <br><br>What about it? Seriously, she's hardly a character. All she does is obsess over Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br> There are plenty of other heroes who met horrible ends without any complaints. <br><br>At least they had an end. Archer never met his.</br></br></br>  Why couldn't he save her?  I think he's hot as fuck and I'd suck his dick all day everyday.  <br>Let me tell you.<br>Archer's popularity is from the FATE route. The real route. Not this UBW fanfiction okay?<br><br>In THAT route. We get little hints as to who he is, but he's mainly just an unidentified badasss. Logical. Calculating. Cunning. He has all the answers with all the swag.<br><br>Then this glorious bastard out of nowhere just decides to fuck logic, common sense and reasoning in order to fucking save everyone from the strongest immortal servant. and kills it 6 times without even using his most powerful move.<br><br>We are all GAR for Archer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was too wrapped up in his BS schemes to realize what Gil was going to do to Illya.</br>  <br> Archer's popularity is from the FATE route. The real route. <br><br>Reminder that there hasn't been a single adaptation of Fate that hasn't borrowed from UBW, while UBW's been able to stand on its own twice.</br></br></br>  <br>It's true.</br>  <br>He's always been a popular guy, get over it.<br>He has a great design, similar to Dante's who's also a total boss, his magic is interesting and unique (or was until it was copied to death by every single anime afterwards) and his story is tragic and endearing.<br><br>If you don't love Archer, that's fine by me, but Emiya Shirou/Heroic Spirit Emiya are well written.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep. DEEN tried to shove in the Caster arc, while the manga did lame version of the Archer fight.</br>  <br> He's an OP as fuck power trip that's why.

Everyone has regrets, and his regret is he lived his entire life selflessly and it destroyed him. He overcomes this and decides to continue doing what he does, dedicated to his ideal. It's a bittersweet ending for him.<br><br>You sound like you haven't had much exposure to any good media. The more you consume books/anime/TV shows in general the more you'll come to appreciate actual characters rather than Gary-Stu's. <br> There are plenty of other heroes who met horrible ends without any complaints. <br>To put it simply, that gets boring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OOOOH boy here we go</br>  <br>Highschool DxD "Sword birth" skill one of the main cast has.<br><br>Summoned swords is literally Archer's sword spam except blue (Vergil, DMC3 and DMC4)<br><br>There are a few others but I forgot because they're mediocre.

It was only afterwards that he became bitter because his suffering never fucking ended and never will.</br></br>  <br>I'm not seeing it tbh.</br>  <br>It's just something that people who don't know about the story say.<br><br>I mean if anything, Shirou's the one who ends up looking more grown up than Archer in UBW.</br></br></br>  <br>Medusa just has an edge over him due to the Pegasus. Almost no other Servant can score a clear win against him save maybe Herc since he can take everyone else down with BPs in one-on-one with neutral ground (because fuck that enchanted temple gate bullshit Sasaki has wiping his ass).</br>  <br> his regret is he lived his entire life selflessly and it destroyed him <br>Nope<br>Archer himself said he died with no regrets.<br>His regrets come from all the shit he had to do as a CG.</br></br></br></br>  <br>(because fuck that enchanted temple gate bullshit Sasaki has wiping his ass).<br>Oh come on. Don't bully the NEET ronin. He did nothing wrong.</br></br>  <br> Shirou's the one who ends up looking more grown up than Archer in UBW <br>Not really.<br>All Shirou does is scream "I'LL GO DOWN THAT PATH REGARDLESS" and that's it.<br>One thing is to talk the talk and another is to walk the walk.<br>UBW Shirou is yet to go down any of the shit Archer went through, and considering UBW Shirou isn't likely to become a CG (as per Nasu's words), then he'll never become the thing that made Archer hate himself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You forgot to take your tripcode off, friend!</br></br></br>  <br>I have nothing against Sasaki but there's something absurdly wrong with Nasu asspulling that the temple gate is a no BP zone.</br>  So many Archer cosplays I saw holy shit  <br>He's always curse it but he's fine with that, he's a bit of a masochist.</br>  <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/WYfh9lhqTfM?t=19m3<wbr>2s</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://<span>youtu.be/QAYGzaRhciM?t=1m59<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]<br>Im tired now sleeping<br>there still more faggots</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou directly witnesses his potential future when he clashes swords with Archer. He's getting memories of what could await him. Regardless though, he still thinks it's worth it.<br><br>That's one of the key things that Archer's plan hinges on: he thought actually seeing what he went through would make Shirou reconsider, but Shirou holds to his ideal, which makes Archer start to shake.</br></br></br>  <br> considering UBW Shirou isn't likely to become a CG (as per Nasu's words),  <br>He's already a CG, how would that even work?<br>UBW Shirou gets a happy afterlife and Archer stays fucked.<br> then he'll never become the thing that made Archer hate himself. <br>Considering Fate and Heaven's Feel, I'm pretty sure the thing that made Archer hate himself is... himself. Imagine having to put up with your teenage self without being able to tell them what a fucking moron they sound like. This is all on top of the fact that Shirou's obnoxious chuuni delusions aren't actually delusions because of magic powers; so in UBW Archer's just going through a crisis. He never stops being a romantic.</br></br></br></br></br>  What would Shiki Tohno think of Archer?  <br>That doesn't change the fact that Shirou is yet to walk down that path.<br>Hell, if I recall correctly, Saber was also shown what would become of her prior to pulling the sword from the stone, and despite knowing what would become of her, she chose to face that and still ended up in regret once all things actually happened.<br><br>Notice that seeing your future is one thing, but actually living an uncomfortable reality, something that shakes the foundations of the ideas you hold on to the most, and then live, and relive that again and again, tasting that bitterness over and over is a whole different matter.<br><br><br> I'm pretty sure the thing that made Archer hate himself is... himself. <br>No, you're told the exact reason why he hates himself in both the VN and the anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm pretty sure the thing that made Archer hate himself is... himself. <br><br>How can you not know this?</br></br></br>  <br> ass cape <br> nice design </br></br>  <br> we <br> We  <br> his regret is he lived his entire life selflessly and it destroyed him <br>Fuck off, retard.</br></br></br></br>  Why is Archer not considered as broken as Gilgamesh?  <br>Shit stats and loses for reasons other than plot armor.</br>  Is nyaa still down for anyone else?  <br>yup, cant go on it since yesterday</br>  Not for me.  for you.  <br>It's been up all day for me.</br>  <br>It's up for me as well.</br>  works for me  Omae wa da.

What is this face trying to convey?  <br>She's happy because Kumiko is available</br>  <br/>  I only watched one episode <br>Does it get better?</br>  <br>It's pretty much<br> teen angst... in band <br>The anime. So no.</br></br></br>  <br>The characters are cute and the music is great  there's some strong yuribaiting though . Watch until 5 and if you still don't feel it, then drop it.</br>  <br/>  JUST    Instrument AD Takahashi let out incredibly cries while he was working <br>  His gaze while he was correcting the instruments in the latter half of the show was very scary. <br>  In the 12th episode, there was about 150 cuts with instruments in there that frankly couldn't have been done in a typical TV series. <br>  A tiny bit of a confession: the small instruments were drawn by CG, but the bigger instruments were all hand-drawn. <br>  When Ishihara first heard about the show, he thought the instruments should be CG, but when considered the affinity with hand-drawn character, he wanted to have the instruments hand-drawn as well. If that couldn't happen, then he felt the characters had to be done in CG too. Thus, he decided the instruments had to be hand-drawn for this show. <br><br>Discuss</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt; A tiny bit of a confession: the small instruments were drawn by CG, but the bigger instruments were all hand-drawn. <br>These crazy motherfuckers. I can barely manage to produce a decent drawing every 2 weeks but these shitters don't give up.<br>Bless</br></br></br>  How can someone as gorgeous as Reina be so grossly in love with this fucker?  <br>That just means you have a chance with her, anon</br>  <br>If episode 12 already had 150 instrument cuts, then I shudder to think how much worse it must have been for them to animate episode 13.</br>  <br>I don't, really.</br>  <br> &gt; Instrument AD Takahashi let out incredibly cries while he was working <br> &gt; His gaze while he was correcting the instruments in the latter half of the show was very scary. <br>Poor guy</br></br></br>  <br> Takahashi-san, please take special care in the shading <br> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAH!!</wbr> </br></br>  What is left to discuss anyway? Season 2 is never happening...  <br>Kumiko and Shuuichi's romance, for example.</br>  <br> geh </br>  <br>How did Kumiko came to like him anyways? was it his good looks? his good taste in food? his big ass  trombone? </br>  Kumiko: All right class, please all sit. I'll be your music teacher for this year, Tsukamoto Kumiko. I''ll be guiding you through Kitauji's musical tradition which started decade ago.<br>Girl A: Tsukamoto-sensei is it true you were part of the first band who brought the school to Nationals.<br>Kumiko: That's right. Those were the best years of my life and Taki-sensei and he brought us gold in the Nationals in my second year. I hope you're highschool life will be filled with much fine memories.<br>Girl B:Ne, sensei is it true Taki-sensei is a hottie? I hear he has a smile to die for.<br>Kumiko: geh.. I guess, many of my bandmates found him attractive. Don't let his demeanor fool you he can be quite harsh and isn't a afraid to single you out for your mistakes.<br>Girl A: There aren't many boys in band were there any hotties during your time?<br>Kumiko: i guess there was Nakagawa-sempai and Goutou-sempai, Shui.. geh.<br>Girl A: Sensei's blushing did you have a boyfriend from the club? <br>Kumiko: Ah.. I think you shouldn't pry in to your sensei's love life.<br>I know many of you transferred here to compete in Nationals, what instruments do you play. Just a warning, if any of you play a Euph, I won't show any mercy!<br>Girl C: I played the trumpet for 5 years and played band from Seijo.<br>Kumiko: That's nice, one of my closest friends are from Seijo and I hope you show as much enthusiasm as she does!<br>Boy A: Sensei, I'm just a beginner with the flute. Will I really be of any use?<br>Kumiko: don't worry If you work hard and practice your part you can pass Taki-sensei's auditions. <br>Girl C: Kohaku loves the tuba!<br>Kumiko: I'm sure you do Kawashima-san and I hope you carry the love to the Nationals.<br>Don't be afraid to compete with your sempais either, Kitauji we pride a students skills over seniority. I hope to see all of you in Nationals!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your fanfiction sucks ass</br>  <br>adult Kumiko sensei.. I have a hard on.

Platinum Kawashima!  <br>I want to fuck Reina. Look at her, look at her body. She's so erotic.</br>  <br>In what way? She aint one to go into details when talking.<br><br>If you think Kumiko will randomly bring shit from the past up like this; "one of my closest friends are from Seijo and I hope you show as much enthusiasm as she does!" Or "many of my bandmates found him attractive. Don't let his demeanor fool you he can be quite harsh and isn't a afraid to single you out for your mistakes." Not to fucking mention this monstrosity; "Those were the best years of my life and Taki-sensei and he brought us gold in the Nationals in my second year. I hope you're highschool life will be filled with much fine memories." <br><br>Then please for all that is goddamn holy go rewatch episode 7 and pay close attention at just how shitty Kumiko is when it comes to talking with people she doesnt really know yet (Trying to cheer up Buchou)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to marry buchou</br>  <br>Reina ties her hair to look like Taki's dead wife.</br>  <br>what the hell is she supossed to tell her students "eh...geh"</br>  <br>she's a teacher in that setting.

I will be helping out all sections but bass in particular, as I play Eupho.. thanks for having me"?<br><br>Look, my example sucks but its at least more intact with her character. Im not trying to be a writer.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt they would need two music teachers.</br></br>  <br>Taki isn't a music teacher though. He's the club advisor.<br><br>Also, Kitauji would be a Band powerhouse by then.

Then the next episode they act as best friends and Reina drops a bottle when Kumiko mentions Taki.<br>Someone please explain.</br></br>  <br><br>Yuri bait.</br></br>  <br>Shes so cute, but so plain. I don't know how to feel.</br>  Hazuki &gt; Reina &gt; Yuuko &gt; Asuka &gt; Natsuki &gt; Kumiko &gt; Kaori &gt; Oboe-chan &gt; Sapphire-chan &gt; everyone else &gt; shit &gt; Riko  <br>That's too much to be considered just yuribait</br>  <br> Riko last <br>Just how and why?</br></br>  <br> no Gotou <br> no Taki </br></br>  <br>She's dating the hottest guy in Kansai region and she's too much of a little bitch to admit it and is ashamed of it.<br><br><br>Girls only, fag.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reina mentioning he wants Taki-sensei's D must have gone over your head. She's also autistic, and Kumiko attraction to her stems from her insecurities.</br></br>  <br>that's how you know its good bait</br>  how do you feel about volume 2's set up?  <br><br>Yurilicious  I doubt there's gonna be another season </br></br>  <br> hottest guy in Kansai region <br> Gotou <br>Please don't joke like that. He's just a big goofy band nerd who settled for a fat chick, nothing special. Also she's not ashamed about dating him, she's just a pure maiden who wants to avoid drama.</br></br></br>  <br>Manga Gotou is just a goofy guy.<br>Anime Gotou is literally the hottest guy in Kansai.</br></br>  <br>The fact you are doubting it means its good bait and the fact /u/ invaded /a/ and shit posted all last season doesn't help either. <br>I have even seen them trying to stick around in other shows. <br>Kumiko is slightly tsundere for Shuuichi.</br></br></br>  <br>Gotou is a fucking giant.</br>  Do we know when the other specials will be released?

Riko was the one who lucked out.</br>  Bitch I'm fabulous.  <br>You know, people think Midori is ugly and she kinda is but to expel seed within her loli-like body would be good enough for me</br>  <br> no power of friendship meant that Rikka loses in the Kansai tournament by getting silver. However, they're still participating in the National Marching Band contest. Kumiko and Azusa still talk which is nice. </br>  <br>Asuka &gt; Natsuki = Kumiko &gt; Reina = Hazuki &gt; Buchou &gt;&gt;&gt; Midori</br>  <br> Kumiko &gt; Reina </br>  <br>Specials?

Outside of those, the girls are just friends and both have male love interests, especially in the source material.</br>  <br> make confirmed straight characters act unneccessarily gay in one scene and then switch back to hetero in the next one <br> good bait <br>'No'</br></br></br>  <br>There's literally hundreds of people who would rather die than admit it was just bait.<br>You have to hand it to Kyoani, they sure know how to bait.</br></br>  <br>Reina loving Taki is all I need, so of course.</br>  I can't quite get a read on Mizore based on Novelanon's spoilers.

Just practicing. <br><br>To answer your question though, i'm drawing an avatar online handle.

No /u/, it was just a really nice scene.</br>  <br>Why?<br><br>I forgot to tell mine <br>I love It because it was important for them also showed how amazing and cool Natsuki is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why? <br>Good trumpet playing.</br></br>  <br>The Kumiko/Shuuichi fistbump scene, and you very well know why.</br>  <br>That was truly amazing indeed.</br>  <br><br>Indeed. But  was the only scene to make me tear up.<br><br>As for my favorite, does the entire final performance count? If not, then Reina's solo. Fucking gorgeous.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cause she's shit</br>  Why are yurifags so fucking disgusting and annoying?  <br>Because it's Haruka's turn to comfort Kaori and it's really cute. On the whole I really like the close friendship between these two.</br>  <br>Because normally their headcanons mix with their obnoxiousness, causing them to project their fantasies on the character in the show and in the threads, forcing yuri where there is none.<br><br>However, with Hibike! is understandable. They were baited pretty hard. I even thought it might actually end in yuri at some point, but like Hyouka, it didn't end in anything tangible.</br></br></br>  <br> 4:19 <br> 4:20 </br></br>   two weeks after the final episode <br> bestsuki is already forgotten </br>  <br>But look at the shit they write on pixiv het drawings. <br>I hope the butthurt kills them all.</br></br>  <br>That's really the hetfags fault.</br>  How many children?  <br>How is their fault?</br>  <br>Tell me how their first time will be.</br>  <br>3.

If I had them (I don't) I'd be happy that the re-releases are shit.

I'm ready.</br>  <br>Not worth 6k plus shipping.</br>  <br> 8500 <br><br>It doesn't come with a vita, right?</br></br></br>   tfw poison will be your first male figure   <br>Natsume was delayed for a little over 2 months, so it's not like it'd be a first.</br>  <br>Nice joke anon.</br>  <br><br>It was an actual question, hard a s fuck to believe you get all that for 8.5k when a Vita with nothing here where I live is $250~</br></br>  <br>Akiman said she was a girl.</br>  <br><br>As someone who got the originals when they first released, I agree that they look like shit. Shizuo more so because of his pouty face and incredibly bright hair. Izaya's hair isn't bad but there's something about his face that bugs me.</br></br>  <br>That's why it's not a legit question, why would they give you a Vita? Those extras are already generous as fuck.</br>  <br>it's not 8500$, it's 8500 yen, equivalent to 85$</br>  Anymore announced at wonfes?  <br>You'll know in two weeks.</br>  Can't wait for my next paycheck so I can buy some Hestia Figs.    <br><br>They have to.

I'm not too fond of loli or darkness edge Yami.</br>  This will get a rerelease right? RIGHT?<br>Why do I miss out on all the good things in life?</br>  <br>It actually did get a rerelease. On hobbystock though.<br><br>I was able to get one when I went to Japan in May. Feels good.</br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely not</br>  <br><br>Not to fond of her, leaving aside that I really don't like loli Yami since she's nothing like the Yami I like, the scale just looks too simple for that price, I mean, just to compare it to the other TLR scales coming out, Trance of Darkness, Sairenji and Kotegawa are only 1-2k~ more then her, and they just look way above her in detail, sculpting and quality, can't shake of the feeling she should be like 7k max.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I mean a fourth rerelease.<br><br><br>Stop hurting me anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ryoubi, Ryouna, and if this poll holds up until the 14th (updated on the 10th) Yozakura will get a daki.<br><br>I'll buy Ryouna and Yozakura if thats the case.

Hair looks kinda clumped together with her, like they just wanted to pump it out asap. Like they could cut corners with time because she's just wearing a night gown</br>  <br>Ignore the homosexual plebeians, anon. A true connoisseur would know that Hestia is one of the greatest idols of our generation. She is assuredly a gift from the gods.</br>  <br>She has too many good figs coming out (two is too many).<br><br>Sento is more appealing and doesnt have shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Not lewd enough.

Since scales need from 6 months to a year to release they need to make them from characters that are actually going to last more than just the initial 4 months hype. <br><br>I'm fairly sure once the Amakuni Hestia is released everyone is going to be like "Oh, right I ordered this.. meh"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wahh wah stop liking things that i don't like </br>  <br>How can you tell me that this isn't, beyond the shadow of a doubt, absolutely and undeniably perfect?</br>  <br>Well anon in a year I'll let you know</br>  <br>Agreed, we need some REAL figs like Miku and Saber.</br>  <br> senran <br> pochaco <br>Did nothing wrong</br></br></br>  <br>You are fucking with me right.</br>  <br><br>Heh, forgot the picture.</br></br>  <br>I sincerely believe Sento has staying power and I'm waiting for the good figs to come out for her.</br>  <br>Give us your taste then.</br>  <br>It's so much better when the fags don't even know the name of the character or where it's from when they buy them.</br>  <br>What is "good taste" for you, friend?</br>   tfw I don't know if I want this  <br><br> &gt;inb4 kek la meme </br></br>  <br>Because Sento is literal perfection.</br>  <br>Actually, I'm sure that by that time, DanMachi Season 2 will have just started premiering.

Made me feel old.</br>  <br>Yep, it was anon, it was...</br>  I've never really cared about names on an anonymous imageboard since I came here to discuss anime instead of comparing people's e-penises like on regular forums. <br><br>In 2005 the vast majority of the previous year's tripfags had been replaced by a new stock and it's been the same every year after that. The only names I've bothered to remember were cool contributors like scanlators, a very small number of dicks who occasionally derailed the entire board (all of whom are thankfully long gone), and a single unremarkable trip who for some strange reason still posts here after a decade.<br><br>But I'm glad I lived at just the right time in the history of the universe to be able to post on an anon animu board, I have wonderful memories of /a/. You're all good people, even you guys who came here a year or two ago, as long as you lurk a bit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> there were memes in my high school time capsule <br><br>Christ.</br></br></br>  <br>But Yami doesn't have a sister.</br>  <br>code gayass sundays were the best</br>  <br>Kira threads were pretty good</br>  <br>Siztra a shit. a shiiiiiiiiit!</br>  Time traveler from 2015 here.<br><br>Anime is still shit in the future.</br></br>  <br>I'm still here, anon.

Am I gay?  <br>Do you happen to have rocket lawnchairs?</br>  <br>Yes, now everyone just rips them from Crunchyroll.</br>  <br>Night time /a/ died as a natural consequence to the board growth. Even in 07/08, people argued whether or not there really was a "night time /a/," and many simply thought that if there were a higher quality on the board during those hours, it was simply due to less number of people posting.</br>  <br>I don't usually condone school shootings, but you school could have benefited from one.</br>  <br>Purikyua!</br>  A 2007er thread and no one mentions Ecstasy AKA Darks?    I dug deep. dated may 18, 2007.  Please tell me someone else remembers this day.  <br> People don't create OC anymore <br>Why would they? There's this whole thing now where no board wants to create OC, because it will eventually be taken from our community and be gawked at under a microscope by people who don't come here. Back before 4chan became a wellknown place, people would make things and they'd be shared amongst the community, people would laugh, then we'd stop using it. Once chanology happened, and "rage faces" were taken from /b/, the site as a whole became more protective and isolationist than it ever was before. There's a reason you don't see people talking about Happy Negro or fgsfds in real life, but you'll hear them say stupid shit about "rare pepes"</br></br>  <br>anyone who can tell me what was up with that C2 Cola?<br><br>What did it taste like?</br></br></br>  I have a few things myself  <br>A shame my first laptop died, this is my oldest after it died.</br>  <br>I do<br>oh jessu I have artwork from like 10 years ago on my hard drive</br></br>  All this Code Geass is reminding me.

I'm from 05 and I still feel new at times.<br>2005 WAS 10 YEARS AGO JESUS CHRIST</br></br></br>  <br>It was simply some mod having fun with /a/ by posting MD Geist as an icon of good manly anime here to purge /a/ from moeshit as embodied by K-On.</br>  <br>Wasn't there another mod and they deleted each other's threads?</br>  I've been here for fifteen months.<br>This is actually my first post.<br>Hello.</br></br>  2008 here. Too new to be cool, to old to be cool.  Oh man, the airing for the last episode of Code Geass R2. The day /a/ cried...good times.  <br>I only remember some K-On threads being ironically banned, but that may have happened as well. In any case, it was just joke modposting as usual that some took as a serious moderation stance on moe anime.</br>  Watching CG with /a/ was the most fun I've ever had on the internet. Spinzaku, Lulucopter, the ineffectual RAGE of the f/a/gs wading through the torrent of Geass to find their moeshit... Good times, good times.  <br> mfw I remember the toppling of Kamina statue filling the front page, but I didn't bother watching TTGL until years later <br>I could've partaked in it all...</br></br>    <br>That board tan shit was downfall of OC.</br>  <br> MD Geist as an icon of good manly anime <br>Wasn't it common opinion on /a/ that MD Geist fucking sucked? I've only seen people claim that they liked MD Geist after the mod spammed it.</br></br>  <br>I remember first coming to /a/ during the R2 shitstorm and kept waiting for another anime that would take over the board like Geass did. Never happened again, the closest it got was probably Madoka's finale.</br>  <br>You missed out on something truly GAR.</br>  <br>Yes, a lot of people think it's a so-bad-it's-so-good-show. My guess would be that lots of people didn't know about Geist at all and simply saw it as a chance to strike back against the moe "fad."</br>  <br><br>Kallen does Dallas.</br></br>  <br>The same happened with Code Geass.<br><br>I am such a fool.</br></br></br>  <br><br>God do I miss the days when moe was 'just a fad'.</br></br>  <br> tfw all of those "ROSSIU YOU FUCKING BASTARD" threads as soon as that happened <br>Code Geass and TTGL was literally the high point of hype for /a/.</br></br>  <br>Yes, and when anime was purely for artistic interests with no regard for money.<br><br><br>What was the name /a/ gave for that one guy who gave the fuck you gesture to Rossiu while everyone else in the crowd was cheering?</br></br></br></br>    <br>all those years did nothing to quiet my rage. fuck rossiu forever.</br>  <br>not after working there for 2 years</br>  <br>Bruce Ironstaunch,  actually he was cheering for Rossiu too. </br>  <br><br> Bruce Ironstaunch <br>I'm surprised I still have this OC.</br></br></br>  <br>times have changed anon</br>  <br>Oh right. Good times.

Not every show needs to be "fun" in the same exact manner.</br></br>  <br>Well, I do kind of like these two as well.

Never give up.</br></br></br>    <br><br>I watched the first season with /a/ but was basically homeless while R2 was airing<br><br>to this day I've never gone back and watched it. What's the point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br><br>to appreciate this fine piece of exotic green haired 700 year old ass</br></br>  <br>About as unbelievable that there was a time where people made dubs threads here. Cancer getting culled isn't surprising.</br>  <br><br>Nobody saw mine besides me. Each freshman's letter was kept in a separate sealed envelope held onto for four years by our homeroom teachers.</br></br>  <br>Same here. I'd been watching anime on my own for years before I started browsing /a/, and the most conversation I ever had about them was an occasional four or five post back-and-forth on /k/ or pre-feels /mu/. I'd always assumed /a/ was like the pathetic anime people I knew in real life and absolutely abhorred.  And it turns out you are, and so am I. </br>  <br>nani mai hunnie?</br>  <br>Clockwork, is that you?</br>  <br>I started playing WoW in 2005 and back then /b/ was still relevant and everyone treated it as the "hackers on steroids" secret club website. I didn't even know other boards existed until like 2007 when I discovered /tg/, if I recall correctly.<br><br>As a kid, in the early-mid 90s, I watched a lot of anime and "anime inspired stuff" like Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, Robotech and Voltron. So all the weeb influence on the site never put me off even if I wasn't that of a huge fan of it. Until Kill la Kill came along and was spammed on all boards and made me get back into anime.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no way Clockwork hasn't seen R2.</br>  <br><br>I don't remember when I started coming here but I can say I almost exclusively went to /t/ for a very long time. /a/ wasn't even on my radar because I just cared about watching anime/reading manga/VNs rather than, uh, discussing them.</br></br>   mfw came to 4chan cause of ponies <br> haven't seen the last two seasons. </br>  <br><br>Really, get the fuck out of here</br></br>  <br>Good b8<br><br>Been here since 2006, though only /a/ these days</br></br></br>  <br> Lanced Jack <br> Nigma <br>Just hearing the name of these 2 trips still gets me angry. I'm glad their gone and no amount of nostalgia will ever make me ever miss the godawful tripfags of 2008-2010. I'm glad tripfagging for the most part is dead.<br><br> How mad do you have to be when even thinking of Nigma replying your post with &gt;butthurt :3 throws you for a rage </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Was his name really Nigma too? I thought it was nigba, but if I'm starting to forget his name, the so fucking be it.</br>  <br>Hello. Have you spent enough time learning the culture?</br>  <br><br><br>why did you end up here and can you honestly say it's any better?</br></br></br>  <br>I just want to find an archive of the threads and read them while I rewatch the anime.<br><br>Also, who Vandread here?</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't come here because of ponies so that automatically makes me better than you.</br>  <br>I got bored of traditionals anime feeds of those times.</br>  <br>I ended up here because I could. Found it through word of mouth. Ponies are contained to one board that was made semi-recently, so i can at least tell that you haven't been here long enough.</br>  <br><br>You're so right. I'm going out now and never coming back.</br></br>  <br>Just checked /b/ for the first time in years. It's the exact same shit as last time, porn, normie problems, etc. Nowadays /b/ just seems like it doesn't exist, nobody talks about it, it doesn't do anything to remind us that it exists either. I honestly think the face of 4chan these days is /v/ or /pol/.</br>  I miss Mark.  <br><br>As if it mattered. You only have lurk for a couple of months to get the gist of the current board culture.</br></br>  Best anime ever, right?  <br>If you don't watch a lot of anime though a lot of the jokes you don't get. <br>You have to become one of us before you truly fit in here.</br></br>  <br>/b/ still does stupid shit to remind us they exist every now and then, wasn't there some celebrity nudes? And a murderer or something?</br>  <br>We can believe she will continue her career 2016<br><br>Sunrise will bring back the Mai-franchise</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it was earlier this year i think.</br>  <br><br>Why would you reply to something like that?</br></br>  <br>There was celeb nudes, I think the murderer was a shop of that faggot from Sandy hook that wasn't real.</br>  <br>She isn't going to make it past christmas</br>  Haven't done gifs in years, sorry if shit quality.  <br>You realise that people have made webm-creators for the layman, right?</br>  <br>Towards the end of R2 (episode 17+) I would get on /a/ around 2 am every Saturday for the hype threads. The episode would begin airing at 3 am and the screenshots and reactions would start to pour in. Occasionally someone would get a livestream working but we'd almost always collectively crash it, and if it did somehow work the chances of it being highjacked by disturbing porn was high. For the rest of the night /a/ was 95% Geass, with the rest being complaints or feeble attempts to talk about something, anything else. The episode would usually be available with subs by the afternoon.</br>  <br>so a couple of months ago</br>  <br>You did your best, grandpa.</br>  <br><br>I just never jumped on the bandwagon. There's something quaint about having to work around the limitations of gif. Plus they're supposed to be low quality. I'm afraid of making a shit webm and having someone post &gt;bitrate</br></br>  <br> gifs </br>   mfw /sp/ steals your GETS again <br><br>You guys are fags</br></br>  <br><br>Feels good.</br></br>  <br>Literally nobody gives a fuck about /sp/ these days, it's all about /pol/ and /tv/ now.</br>  <br>If she doesn't OD herself with anti-depressants, or go nuts with her identity crisis</br>  Guys I think I'm GAR for Archer.  I wish we got this with Kallen and C.C.. And no, the picture drama doesn't count  <br>PLease don't mention /pol/, or else the thread will be derailed by jew bashing and nigger hating and shit.</br>  <br> If she doesn't OD herself with anti-depressants <br>I tub full of water or in bed</br></br>  <br> /tv/ <br><br>Literally who?</br></br></br>  <br>Here's a clue</br>  <br><br> a.f.k._haroohee_01.avi <br> shmion  <br> underwater ray romano <br> marked for deletion (old) <br> old computer is kill along with everything /a/-related <br> tfw still here </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry to hear that, been here since late 2006</br>   School Rumble Season 3 in production <br><br>26 MORE EPISODES<br>I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHO HARIMA ENDS UP WITH<br>YAKUMO IS PERFECT<br>ERI IS A WHORE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> absolutelydisgusting.jpg <br><br>People don't "age out" of 4chan, this isn't reddit.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand. Who is this guy? What's his deal?</br>  <br>/a/ had quite a big meltdown after the PSG finale. Not quite as much as Lulu's death, but pretty close.</br>  <br>Sometimes I do. Sheldon was so easy to fuck with.<br><br>Someone started posting with the name Komeiji not too long ago. But I don't think it was our dear, beloved Sheldon.</br></br></br>  <br> Lulu's death <br>Indeed. I don't think anyone's truly recovered.</br></br>  <br>PSG was the last time I can recall /a/ being so united in rage and tears. I miss huge shows bringing so much solidarity to the masses of the board.</br>  <br>He's CIA.</br>  <br>She will make it in for Christmas Time<br><br> with her wife Mai-san </br></br></br>  <br> Pros: <br> Season 2 confirmed </br></br>  YOU CAN FLY HIGHER<br><br>LET'S GET NAKED</br></br>  Lucky star or TTGL?  <br>Free!

Just a bunch of kids trying to be funny and talk about how "epic" plot points were.</br>  <br>KLK was garbage, period.</br>  <br> I'm going to compare Code Geass to KLK <br> I'm going to keep talking about something unrelated and compare them to something I wasn't around for </br></br>  <br>It was more like people laughing at the retarded plot twists and fapping to Stumpzaku fapfics.</br>  <br> Gonzo is basically dead. <br> Even if they did go back to Vandread, it'd be moeshit like Last Exile S2. <br><br>Feel's bad man. Barnette best girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime is garbage, period.</br>  <br>It was a different time, a lot more anarchic. On the days CG aired maybe like 1/3 of the threads would be about CG, you'd have 4 or 5 threads just about which girl someone wanted to fuck (and often 1 or 2 threads about which guy someone wanted to fuck) and then individual threads about individual plot points that happened during the episode.<br><br>In some ways /a/ is a lot more polite now and will contain discussion about a series to one thread without much interference. Better cataloging and such helps of course.</br></br></br>  <br>Well meme'd.</br>   Code Geass <br>Planetes was better, I hope he directs something like that again. Everybody will forget about this trainwreck soon enough.</br>  General threads basically killed any chance of hilarious shit.<br><br>The average quality of the board is possibly better, but we will never get a single show with 50+ threads and the entire front page again.</br></br>  <br>CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS CODE GEASS</br>  <br>Who cares about tripfags? I'm glad they died out.</br>  <br> General threads <br>really has killed a lot of 4chan. I don't really understand what happened.</br></br>  <br>like dis</br>  <br><br>  Vandred <br><br>Underrated for its genre</br></br></br></br>  According to the picture drama Lelouch is still alive.  <br><br>I got bad news for you son</br></br>  <br> General threads killed hilarious shit <br>They killed more than that, they killed a lot of the site operating as a community. A lot of generalshits just stay in there "stupid faggot shit general #46546 SUCK MY ANUS EDITION" and just circlejerk about whatever stupid shit the general was. Before generals and the catalog I feel like the board had to interact with a lot more things it didn't necessarily like.</br></br>  <br> that butt blasted faggot in the spam thread </br>  <br>Not the earliest, but the earliest that's actually interesting.</br>  <br> you will never be invited to Clovis' beach party on Jupiter </br>  <br>Are you me? That was literally my exact train of thought when I browsed /fit/ and /b/ in 2006. I remeber getting pissed when someone would post anime reaction pic and everyone would call them out as weebs. Stopped pretending I was a normalfag and came to /a/ soon after.</br>  <br>meh I'll admit I'm newfag as fuck i didnt come to 4chan until the summer influx of 2009 even then i only went to the big 3 boards of shitfest /b/ /v/ and /pol/ until 2012 then branched out to a few other boards like /co/ /tv/ /n/ and /fit/ etc. and like this anon  only just came to /a/ in 2014<br>but it still enjoy it here even if i only get to enjoy the heydays of the board from screencaps</br></br>    Nice boat.  <br>go fuck yourself, eri all the way</br>  <br><br>I will never be invited to any beach party</br></br>  <br>Catalog. I thought it was such a great idea but now I miss scrolling. Now everyone just finds their general and thats it.</br>  <br>Nice blogging faggot.</br>  Has anyone seen any lions around?  <br>I still exclusively use the front page, it feels wrong otherwise.</br>  <br><br>What software did 4chan even use way back when? It was futallaby, right? I know we're still technically using it, though it's a "4chan version" now.<br><br> If I ever made an imageboard I wouldn't have a catalog or allow generals </br></br></br></br>  <br> <br>The threads were similar in that the people watching knew they were watching trash, but were just along for the ride.<br>Geass just had far less people making it their mission to shitpost in threads and tell people to stop having fun.</br></br></br>  <br> The threads were similar in that the people watching knew they were watching trash, but were just along for the ride. <br>I will agree with that, though I feel like a lot of those posters were people who actually believed the "ANIME IS SAVED" shit, like people from reddit or /v/. I hate using boogeymen but I saw more non-4chan and non-/a/ images on /a/ during KLK than I think I ever saw in my years of browsing; KLK was one of the worst points on this board I can remember recently</br></br>  <br> I wouldn't allow generals <br><br>Aren't they technically not allowed on /a/, anyways?</br></br></br>  <br>Truly one of the best things that happened to /a/. Attention whoring wasn't funny and I am glad it's gone for good and the vast majority of users don't know they ever existed. Thank god they all either turned on each or moved on to some erp skype group.</br>  <br>Technically, yes, but look at the board. DJT, Buyfag, JoJo, those are all threads that get IMMEDIATELY remade when the old one dies. They're generals that don't call themselves generals.</br>  <br>I think they only get deleted if they have edition in the OP.<br><br>You forgot Yuri Yuri.</br></br></br>  <br>Not continuous generals, no. But when a new episode or chapter of something comes out, it's generally accepted that it gets a general or two to contain everything pertaining to it.<br><br>Yeah, you're right. DJT at least help people learn something, which is great to help out the fansubbing or scanlating community. Buyfag threads really belong on /jp/ more than /a/. Jojo threads will die down soon since the anime finished.</br></br></br>  <br>moot babelfished futaba's source code and has built upon it ever since even though inside the whole thing is a decayed clusterfuck. Not that I know anything about that stuff, but I'm pretty sure he's mentioned it in every q&amp;a he's done.</br>  <br>Hence the "technically". There was far too much inaction before they started cracking down on generals. Unless it has general, edition, etc. in the OP, they usually fly under the radar.<br><br>There's actually quite a few at this point.<br><br><br>DJT is understandable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2007 is when I first started browsing, mongrel.<br><br> Fate Threads were better back then </br></br></br>  http:////www.freshverse.com/tv.php<br>Remember me?<br>I wonder where he is nowadays</br></br>  <br>There really doesn't seem to be a point to /jp/ when /a/ has stuff like djt, buyfag, LN, VN, threads. The split should've never happened.</br>  <br>/jp/ is a touhou containment board.</br>  <br>I had left by the time KLK came around, but I wouldn't describe CG as 'trash'. I mean, we called it a trainwreck for a reason, but not trash. The animators also openly catered to the fan jokes and memes a few times which brought the ridiculousness to new heights.</br>  <br> Yuru Yuri <br>Yeah, and OreGairu, which ended on the 25th, has had like 25 threads hit bump limit in july alone.<br><br><br><br>DJT threads I'm generally okay with, but a long time ago we had textboards, and /lang/ was one of them. Buyfag belongs on /jp/ or /toy/, not /a/, we have two /ak/ threads, something that doesn't belong on /a/ AT ALL (they even wrote "No PLA edition", they're not even trying hard to hide that they're a general) the drawthreads are tangentially related, but they'd do better on a board like /i/ or /ic/ where it's the actual board's topic. That being said, /a/ could be a lot worse, but we shouldn't give a sigh of relief and say "Oh, well we could be a lot worse, so it's okay that we've got some of these things on our boards."<br>A lot of those threads have people that don't even go on /a/. I know buyfag threads have a problem with redditors and /v/, and Jojo threads might as well be /v/.<br><br><br>Sounds like you don't remember TOUHOU HIJACK LOLS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>General threads are just a result of the boards being WAY bigger then they were back in the day.<br><br>There's simply too many people to all be watching the same show and talking about it. Even KLK (which I didn't even think was that big) still had entire chunks of people on /a/ not watching it wheras Geass and GL had pretty much every damn anon watching it. Even the ones bitching about the threads/<br><br><br>And of course I think Geass is just a one of a kind show anyway, regardless of R2 quality.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right. Trash is too harsh. It was very schlocky in a trashy sort of way. But it was the best sort of trashy that you'd still take home to your trailer.</br>  <br>It was shit if you didn't like Chode Goose. Like me.</br>  <br> but a long time ago we had textboards <br> a long time ago <br><br>It wasn't THAT long ago. Unless you're referring to the ones that were removed prior to the removal of all text boards.<br><br> That post was VIP quality! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Planetes was different. Code Geass did what it needed to do and that's enough. Might as well compare either of them to Maria despite it having nothing in common with them.</br>  <br><br>Touhou craze has died down a lot and isn't even as big as Kancolle now. And Kancolle was contained to a general when it was allowed here.</br></br>  <br>Note: Anime is trash. <br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>-Humanity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DADDY COOL</br>  Why do people act like it's cool to hate on Code Geass? You do realize this is an anonymous imageboard right?  <br>LOOK AT THIS NEWFAG</br>  <br> the vast majority of users don't know they ever existed. <br>Just like sage and age then. If there was only one thing I could change about /a/ I would make it 50-75% slower due to less userbase.</br></br>  <br>I would call it a poor reason, with the benefit of hindsight. Show ended better than a lot of less crazy series.</br>  <br> since 2004 <br>so you work for the FBI now I assume</br></br>  <br>FUCK YOU!</br>  <br>There, now I'm happy. This sums up the key features (loaded with tripfags, of course)</br>  <br><br>At least you aren't /co/<br><br> having your gets stolen by the /sp/s of TWO DIFFERENT CHANS <br><br>WEW</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kancolle was contained to a general when it was allowed here <br><br>There are still KanColle threads up almost all the time. Though the majority of the fanbase absolutely despises the anime and rarely discusses it, there's quite a bit of work being done towards translating 4komas and the like. Though there's also a lot of game discussion. <br><br>It's a general at this point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dudes were more chill and in-joke-y by default. I don't think they were following, or even had the ability to find about, 4chan memes.</br>  <br>I came here in 2006 when I was 12. I know that because I remember reading the blind deaf mute loli series as it was happening.<br><br>Now that I think about it, didn't he just disappear one day?</br></br></br>  <br>You know, I didn't really care for the memes for the sake of memes, not then and not now, but we did have some nice speculation at the same time. Evidently it's easier to remember the memes, yet they weren't everything going on.</br>   come to /a/ in like 2006 when I was 13 <br> only browsed for like 30 seconds before I gave up on trying to understand the layout <br> year later <br> I understood how threads and posts worked instantly, just clicked right away <br> get hooked on /b/ and become full /b/ tard <br> participate in the club penguin raids and habbo hotel pool's closed etc <br> wander over to /a/ <br> 20th episode of Code Geass R2 just aired <br> see all the hype threads <br> download them all and catch up within a week <br> watch the last 4 eps with /a/ <br> it was so fun that I stayed. <br><br>And here I am.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What happen to her head?</br>  <br><br>She's unconscious and the remaining top part of the robot is hiding it. No sense in blocking Jeremiah's pose.</br></br>  <br>It's true, back when the board was smaller there were always 1-3 shows a season that /a/ as a group basically watched and discussed, whether they were shit or not tailored the discussion. Those days had their moments, but it wasn't sustainable, once we hit more than double digit percentages of the community not watching the same show, generals had to come into place.</br>  <br>Actually, Maria shared a fair bit with Planetes.</br>  I'll still be on /a/ in another 10 years when I'm in my mid 30s. That's a comforting though.  <br>That shit was wild as fuck.<br> jumping out of your broken robot and destroy the enemy's robot with YOUR BARE HANDS </br></br>  <br>Agreed, how is that related?<br><br><br> I'm going to compare Code Geass to KLK <br>I didn't compare Code Geass to KLK. I compared the threads on /a/ based on them you illiterate fucktard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you really, really, really stretch. Planetes is all about science and at least quasi-realistic. Maria had realistic combat but was otherwise fantasy and magic and witches wearing skimpy clothes.</br></br>  <br> Not knowing he meant the threads as well <br>Why do you always get so fucking defensive when someone responds in a way you don't like? Fuck off, dude.</br></br>  <br><br>As expected of Orange-kun</br></br>  <br><br> tfw you're not that far behind </br></br>  <br>Those posts are /v/-tier. <br><br>/a/ has improved.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a wild time, true, but we had both better and worse posts. Don't generalize.</br>  <br> being able to have fun is /v/-tier <br> not being able to have fun is /a/-tier </br></br>  <br>I mean in how it was produced and even some of the stylistic choices. Same character designer, too.</br>  It warms my heart to see so many oldfags still on /a/. No matter how shitty this board may have gotten or will get, don't forget we're here forever, brothers.  <br> Not knowing he meant the threads as well <br>You're being incredibly generous with this interpretation. I suspect it's because you're a retard looking for a reason to insult me. <br><br> Why do you always <br>What? Stop responding to me if you don't like my posts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess, but I expect their audiences only partially overlap.</br>  <br>Is that supposed to be a good thing or a bad thing?</br>  <br> HAHA [INSERT 3 WORD LINE REFERENCING THE SHOW HERE] <br>I'm OK with fun, but you have to admit that you're a 12 year old if you find the above behavior fun.</br></br>  <br>Oldfags need to disappear for the sake of progress, so it's bad in the long run.</br>  <br> anyone who disagrees with me is a retard <br> d-dont respond to me <br><br>Post 2008 shitters always have to come in and ruin fun</br></br></br></br>  <br>It truly feels like the summer of 2008 lasted 7 years and is still ongoing.</br>  <br>Are you fucking with me right now? Are you literally comparing a different age of 4chan, and the internet as a whole to now?</br>  <br>You're right, and while I find the memes amusing, the reactions to the actual show content were what made it all good. Unfortunately I didn't save much of that aspect, and the magic is gone now that we all know how it ends.</br>  <br> anyone who disagrees with me is a retard <br>Nope. <br><br> don't respond to me <br>Nope. Illiterate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This was the best year of my life alonside 2008 and 09, I'd rather live it all again than spend 1 second here.<br><br><br>Why haven't you killed yourself yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>True, but it's fun to pretend.</br>  <br>No?</br>  <br>I never said a thing about their audiences, only the shows themselves.<br>Listen, the point is that we need more Planetes-like shows. It's pretty much the only one of its kind</br></br>  <br>How did it used to be? I'm too newfag to know why or how it's gone downhill</br>  <br> post 2008fag continues to shit up the thread <br> he'll even reply to this <br>Literally fuck off dude, you acted like you were an expert on something you knew nothing about and now you're getting buttdevasted over the fact that someone called you a retard</br></br></br>  <br>Okay man, let's chill. <br>Space Brothers sort of counts.</br></br>  <br> you acted like you were an expert  <br>Nope. You post stupid shit and I correct it. Simple as that. <br><br> buttdevasted  <br>Every response you make.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But that's what you're doing. You're saying the way we acted back then is for 12 year olds, and now is better. (which now isn't, only newfags think that now is better) /a/ was more willing to have fun and do funny shit, now a majority of posters are crossboarders who post in walled off threads, not interacting with the rest of the board</br>  <br>I'm still waiting for him.</br>  Hey guys anyone check out the new episode of kaiji? I hope Andou gets fucked over. The fat shit.  <br>superiority complex post 2008shitter continues posting, what will he think of next<br><br>might i suggest reddit as an alternative to this site? doesn't seem like /a/ is quite as slow as you</br></br></br>  <br> not knowing that we're all here forever <br>There is no escape.</br></br>  Remember when greentexters were told to fuck off?  <br>I was on 4chan in 06 and on /a/ in 07. I remember old tripfags like cirno and taiga.</br>  Lets be honest though, despite everything, /a/ was still the best at maintaining some aspects of board culture and it's still the best board on 4chan in my humbly shit opinion.  <br> /a/ was more willing to have fun and do funny shit <br>OK, but that wasn't demonstrated in that screenshot. <br><br>I don't think any reasonable person here finds "ALL HAIL LELOUCH" fun, or "ZEROZAKU!!!!" fun, or "FUCK THIS FAGGOT END" fun. Why would you? You'd have to be a child.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember ton berry king lanced jack taiga anonymous of germany 40 percent etc</br>  <br> when Moot gave everyone on /a/ a Taiga or that other guy trip. Dang. Who was that other guy? </br>  Are the people who always get bootyblasted over anything fun happening, are always &gt;&gt;&gt;/linkingtootherboards/, and get mad at literally everything oldfags, or are they newfags?<br><br><br>Like this guy</br></br></br>  <br> I don't think any reasonable person here finds "ALL HAIL LELOUCH" fun, or "ZEROZAKU!!!!" fun, or "FUCK THIS FAGGOT END" fun. Why would you? You'd have to be a child. <br>Yet again, you're comparing a different time of /a/ to now. I was there, and I definitely wrote that stupid shit on /a/. Just because you weren't there and didn't partake in it doesn't mean it's bad; I had a lot more fun on /a/ then than I've ever had one the "super serious no fun" brigade came in. /a/ is literally "NO FUN ALLOWED" and I suspect a majority of the people that post things like that came on 4chan after chanology and, as much as I hate using this phrase, are trying to fit in.</br></br>  <br>Which is why I still use it, and I have no viruses whatsoever.</br>  <br><br>Look at the timestamps. Those posts were made during/immediately after the final episode aired, before we had subs or even a picture of wtf was going on. The actual discussion had to wait until we'd crossed the language barrier. Until then we had fun with it.</br></br>  <br>Lanced Jack<br>I wasn't even here nigga and I know that</br></br>  P I M P<br>I<br>M <br>P</br></br></br>  <br> moot#faggot <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>No, please take off the rose colored glasses. Lack of OC is a sitewide thing and other than that, shit really isn't that bad. Jesus, do you really want to go back to the days where scum like <br>could derail an entire thread with their shitposting and blogging? That wasn't 'fun.' It was just sad and most people either flamed them or ignored them. She should be banned but she cyber'd with a lonely 1-eyed mod and got immunity. I welcome any /a/ without that level of cancer.</br></br>  <br>Oh yea... It was funny but it got old kinda fast.</br>  <br>I don't see the point in this type of response. <br><br><br> you're comparing a different time of /a/ to now <br>I don't think there's anything wrong with comparing different time periods, but isn't what I did. <br><br> doesn't mean it's bad <br>I'm not saying it's bad. I'm saying you have to be a child or dumb in order to find it entertaining. You are literally quoting parts of the show and posting it in caps. Again, what reasonable 21+ year old here would find that "fun"? <br><br> and I suspect a majority of the people that post things like that came on 4chan after chanology and, as much as I hate using this phrase, are trying to fit in. <br>That might be true, but it doesn't matter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Remember me /a/?  <br>no</br>  <br> with a tales of vesperia background <br><br>Are you me? 10/10 would waifu anon</br></br></br>    OH GOD SHANA IS HOT /a/!  <br> Lack of OC is a sitewide thing <br>No it isn't. /tv/ and [s4s] still make a shitload of original content.<br> could derail an entire thread with their shitposting and blogging? <br>Are you seriously implying that that does not happen today? All you have to do is talk about reddit or post a tumblr picture and you can completely derail an entire fucking thread. Hell, it's even easier to derail shit then it was back then because everyone takes things so fucking seriously. Posters have lost the literal fucking ability to discern between someone being serious and someone trying to start shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw I have been here since 2008, just one year off to be able to tell you to go eat a dick <br><br>7 Years is still pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to see other elements too. Realistic characters with strong personalities, romance arcs that don't just serve to select a winner from a harem, shows with goals beyond getting S2 or selling merch and so on.</br>  <br> Lack of OC is a sitewide thing <br>Not really.</br></br>  Akira pactio when?  I am the sexiest  <br>I'd actually forgotten about that sperg, fuck you for making me remember.</br>  <br>Remember when this man was the pinnacle of masculinity?</br>  <br>I did exactly this except I went on /b/ in 2005 and migrated to /a/ during 2006/7.</br>    <br>Not who you're replying to, but as I said above, those '12 year old reactions' are a bunch of english speakers reacting to a japanese show that they had just watched through lagging livestreams.</br>  <br> I'm not saying it's bad. I'm saying you have to be a child or dumb in order to find it entertaining. You are literally quoting parts of the show and posting it in caps. Again, what reasonable 21+ year old here would find that "fun"?  <br> I only like mature discussions for mature people like me <br>fucking hell. can't believe people like you post on the same site i've spent 10+ years on<br><br><br>mah bossfu</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't you mean the summer of 2007</br>  <br>I agree with your general idea, but when people starting using the NO FUN ALLOWED meme, they are usually exiled tripfags who thought their shitposting was 'hahaah so entertaining XD' when it just ruined nice things. <br><br>Some people try too hard to fit in, and that's too bad. But I feel like it was necessary or else /a/ would just become /v/. Can board culture go overboard? Yes. But I would rather have that then open the floodgates for normalfags and rec threads. Naruto being allowed is enough for me, at least you still get told to fuck off if you don't know how to post. <br><br><br>This post explained it better than I can. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I miss 2007 /a/  Welll If it's 2007.... <br><br>Any-one play this game yet?</br></br>  <br> legitimately discussing in Naruto threads <br><br>We don't change do we?</br></br></br>  <br>Who was that tripfag that used gar in his name. I miss him.</br>  <br>Why isn't /a/ fun anymore?</br>    <br>It's been half a year now and I still can't beat that shit on normal without using any continues.</br>  <br>Gar Expert? He was pretty cool. I actually found out about Punpun because he posted it on /a/ once.</br>  <br>Mods too trigger happy<br>Newfags can't prove they're fitting in unless they fight against fun</br></br>  <br>We became more serious but also less funny.</br>  <br>Wasn't he also accused of being lelouch?</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>How many GAR things has he done by now?</br>  <br>When was the last time he posted?</br>  <br><br><br>mai bossu</br></br></br>  <br>I ignored you the first time because those people weren't forced to post show quotes in all caps. You can just spend however long it takes you to think of something funny or interesting, and then post that. It's a non-explanation. <br><br><br> I only like mature discussions for mature people like me <br>"Mature" is ambiguous. <br><br> ALL HAIL LELOUCH <br>It's weird how often this kind of shit is defended as "fun" on 4chan. You can't think of how to have fun on without uninspired 3 worded posts in caps? It's absurd how people attempt to defend that behavior with "it's fun". I don't know of anyone 21+ who would find that fun. You've got to be a kid or a special kind of stupid. <br><br>Well, whatever. No point in pushing it then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>jesus christ</br>  <br>Assholes and jackassery?<br><br>Does anyone remember that one tripfag... Taiga? He/she was bad to begin with but as soon as that tripfag posted the thread went to shit because fucking EVERYONE started a shit-storm over tripfagging instead of just filtering the trip.<br><br>Too much petty shit and an influx of morons trying to "fit in" and /a/ went to shit... well even more shit.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Wed 24 Sep 2014, supposedly.</br>  <br>Taiga, please fuck off to your skype group. God your posts reek even without a watermark.</br>  <br> It's weird how often this kind of shit is defended as "fun" on 4chan. You can't think of how to have fun on without uninspired 3 worded posts in caps? <br>I can very well turn the same fucking thing around on you. You can't think of how to have fun without posting long fucking paragraphs about stupid shit nobody wants to read? /a/ was smaller before people like you who hate fun started browsing, and honestly, you're an element that is detrimental to the board as a whole. You're basically saying "Wow, I can't believe you have fun in a way I don't approve of. How can anyone who isn't a kid find that fun?"<br>No, you're not basically saying that, you're actually saying that. Fuck off, you newfag. Post somewhere that isn't /a/. If we could kick out all of the people like you, maybe /a/ would have a fighting chance again.</br></br></br>  <br>yes that was him</br>  <br>Odd enough... I'm not him/her. Does it look like I Have an Argentina IP?????<br><br>This is also the shit I was talking about.</br></br></br>  Why aren't there ronery threads anymore?<br>They were the most enjoyable things on /a/.</br>  <br>Mods hate fun, what do you expect?</br>  <br>They went to /r9k/</br>  <br>The best thing that ever happened to /a/ was those threads being nuked.<br><br>Fuck off to /r9k/ if you want to be ronery, shitposter.</br></br></br>  Holy shit guys, you won't believe how great this visual novel is. Thanks mirror moon, can't wait for UBW patch!  <br>Moot despised them and tried to move them to /jp/. This was before /r9k/ became a pit of despair.</br>  <br>Because we have a containment board for that shit now.</br>  <br> wannabe-normalfag blogging is fun </br>  <br>And you're what, 15, maybe 16? I posted that screencap for oldfag nostalgia, not so little shits like you can feel intellectually superior. You're looking at something out of context, completely unfamiliar with what it feels like to be swept up with a bunch of people that are all excited about the same thing. When multiple people who were actually there are telling you it was fun it's idiotic to argue.</br>  <br> and Jojo threads might as well be /v/ <br><br>I'm 100% sure that jojo generals are made of /v/ermins. Believe me. <br>Yahari's = /b/<br><br>Actually the only franchise with /a/ posting on it is Yuru and Kancolle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I don't think you know what /r9k/ actually is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those threads were only good on days like valentine's day. Otherwise pointless.</br>  It's sad that the only thing most of you fuckers recall are cancerous tripfaggots.  <br>turn around   Please  </br>  I should really try to find another, smaller site that is fun like /a/ used to be. It's really hard to make good posts/threads these days. I'm too lazy to do it, though.  <br>I've been here a lot longer than you, a time where I can remember where<br> haha 3DPD <br>wasn't taken literally. I even posted that the thought of human female contact disgusts me earlier, so step up.<br><br><br>And that's one of the biggest problems with generals; they bring an unwanted and inharmonious element to the boards and start attracting people who would've ordinarily never came to the boards. Those people who are now pampered by their hugbox generals disperse around the board when someone unrelated of topic comes up, and begin to shit up the board with their bullshit none of the board regulars care about.<br>Fuck, I hate generals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to make an /a/. Only problem is I don't think anyone would actually go.</br>  <br>It can't be helped, nice and comfy threads are a lot less memorable than tripfag drama.<br><br>If it satisfies you, I remember that we had frequent late night Blame! threads that I really loved.</br></br></br>  What's funny is that the true oldfags of /a/ most likely browse /jp/ now.  <br>Those people left long ago.</br>  <br>Don't even bother with it for a second. Tons of people have tried to make their own imageboards in the vein of 4chan and they all more or less fail.</br>  <br> appeal to tradition <br>Dubs shit was common place here a few years ago but that doesn't mean they're good. <br><br>Also I don't even know why you're being all 'ur le newfag compared to me muh 3D' when all I said was that you should fuck off for thinking blogshit is fun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. True /jp/sies either left 4chan, went to Gensokyo, or came back here. I browsed mainly /jp/ after /a/day and I came back once generalcancer consumed /jp/.<br><br>If only ZUN!bar was here...</br></br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1537<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1529:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn <br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1536 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting Paladin holding Fighter down and lustfully tonguing her navel, saliva dripping from her mouth and a sense of sexual pleasure on her face as Fighter squirms at her appendage probing her umbilicus.

So who's going to watch the live action movie just because but don't expect it to be good? will be interesting to see a world where everyone's Asian with European names.<br><br>I mean honestly Japan, I know you hate using no ethnic Japanese actors but could you at least use hair dye and just pretend?</br></br>  <br>Да, я согласен с этим</br>  <br>Look, Dragon ball, and most of its main characters, such as the Sayians, were based on Chinese mythology. So, yes, it's far better assuming they're Asian than believing they're white when everything points out its inspired by Asian culture. Look at Avatar or Kryptonians, no one assumes Superman is Asian or some other minority because he happens to have dark hair and tanned skin. He's white because the writers stated it to be so and the fictional culture is based on Western influences. Avatar has characters that are ambiguous, especially concerning the Air Nomads and some EKs, but no one assumes they would be played by white people when their entire inspiration/culture are based on Asian/Native influences.</br>  <br>because God is also white?</br>  i love how their porn always does a better job with the cosplay than their movies  <br>Japan is big into having the right priorities.</br>  Can we expect any character development or are we just gonna see them between MC's interactions with the three fantasy girls?
