Going by Central time.</br></br>    When are Platinum Games gonna make a Symphogear game?  <br>That would be a great game, but the influx of underage little /v/ shits would not be worth it.</br>  <br>No, fuck you I don't want to watch S3 first episode with half a brain.</br>  <br>H-how often does that happen?</br>   Fisting isn't very appealing.   Subs next week though.  <br>Give or take 3 days after airing due to zoid actually picking it up</br>  Who bunny Chris here?  <br> CRS-7 <br>What if Nana funded that shit all along to advertise GX?</br></br>  What's the best release of S1?

Doescit have boobs cause ill watch if it had boobs  <br>I miss Locodol so much</br>  <br>Combined efforts, after I had enough I let someone else work over it, them some other guy changed the background, and so on.<br><br><br>I don't quite see the problem between using a website image and an image from the PV but if you want to be so autistic I'll change it just for you.</br></br></br></br>  I've missed my Waifu. So good to see her again.  <br>son it has the best boobs</br>  <br> this faggot again <br>Still no nipples. We already told you.</br></br>  <br> I let someone else work over it, them some other guy changed the background <br>Those were both me.<br><br> And I don't approve of your Vocaloid square. </br></br></br></br>  In the middle of G right now, hop onto the hype train!<br>http://connectcast.tv/Cl0NefagCE</br>  <br>In a week.</br>  <br>I didn't ask for nipples now did i. I asked if it had boobs fucking nigger</br>  <br>We already have a good final version.<br>There's no need to keep messing it around. People will just get fed up.</br></br>  <br>Bikkibro is that you?</br>  <br>If you're looking for boobs, go watch Love-ru Darkness S2</br>  <br><br>Why not?<br>Someone pointed out that because they are dolls they could be singing like vocaloids. I liked the idea. Also it's better than the Traitor field, that's one of the worst of my old version, I don't even understand why you kept it. So I merged Fine Returns with Elfnine and made the free space Vocaloid.</br></br></br>  <br> I merged Fine Returns with Elfnine <br>Making it unnecessarily difficult.<br><br>Vocaloid is dumb.<br>They're dolls not robots.<br>We don't even know if they're singing.<br>We know they already have seiyuu.<br>Making the audience listen to shitty vocaloid speaking voices all the time would be a terrible decision.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also the traitor field is fine.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if one of them defects. It won't be the dolls, and it won't be what's-her-face.<br>Elfnine being a traitor is a good, plausible, and simple one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tama's voice through a shitty robot filter <br>Just kill my ears.</br></br>  <br>Elfnein isn't a doll.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I thought she was the playing the red one for some reason.</br>  <br>Not difficult, it just says Elfnine is Fine. She's the most likely candidate.<br><br><br>Point taken, guess I just wanted it worded differently now, like "Elfnine Defects" would be more clear.<br><br>She's really the mysterious one, whose role and actions can't really be predicted yet.<br><br>Anyway, I'll leave the bingo alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's the most likely candidate. <br>True enough.<br><br>I'm pretty worried about whether her seiyuu can pull off a serious character.<br>Her design really doesn't suit such a squeaky cute voice. Maybe she has more range than I'm aware of.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She voiced Cerebrum in Geneitaiyo, she'll be fine.</br></br>    Nana a lewd.  <br> believe in justice and hold a determination to fist </br>  Official relationship charts of S1 and G.  Is cc still alive over at the .tv? It's been months since I last streamed.  <br>I forget what she sounded like there. It was only one scene.</br>    <br><br>Depends, he was a shapeshifter, so she switched between voices, a young boy, a loli, and an adult woman are the three I'm remembering.</br></br>  <br>Oh, I know. But the loli was only for one scene, and I can't remember how she sounded.<br>The other forms were different voice actors.</br></br>  <br>If you mean cc as in the old streamer, no, neetball does it now.<br>If you mean cc as in the website, at the moment yes.</br></br>  When does it air? 1 pm?  <br><br>Oh, indeed.</br></br>  <br>1pm in every time zone.<br> Filtered. </br></br>  <br>Got it.

Doesn't have to be /u/- intensive, just something to play off the relationship they built over season 2. Something like a head pat from Tsubasa or a hug from Chris would be enough.

And Symphogear is a harder show to sub with all those songs and shit.</br>  I did not recall that Dark Oblivion played in episode 1.<br><br>It seems fantastic in comparison to Finenglish, though.</br></br>  <br>Does tumblr even care about this?</br>  <br>It did take him like 3 years to finish up the final manga volume, but I hope with a team the animu won't be too hard on him.</br>   Going to miss the stream because of training at work. <br><br>I'll have fun avoiding /a/ for the entire weekend.</br></br>  <br>Tumblr has at least a small fanbase for pretty much everything. Even the shows they hate.</br>  <br>I don't mind having no subs for the songs.</br>  <br>Posting from Australia, on the best internet available in the country and I get a few seconds continuous at best. GX 1 airs at 4am local anyway so have anyway. See you in the threads.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon I'll be hype enough for us both.</br>  <br>Spoilers have already been out. You aren't going to miss much.</br>  <br>*GX 1 airs at 4am local time anyway so have fun regardless.<br>Jesus.</br></br>  <br>It's kind of needed for Symphogear. I suppose they could come back and sub them later for a faster release.</br>  <br> Not that anon but Yucie's site seems to be 404'd. I found another one but it doesn't seem like it's for anime. </br>  <br><br><br> Tumblr isn't a hivemind and is just a network of blogs you can even choose who views shit and who doesn't. "Offending" someone there doesn't even matter when there are actually loads of offensive blogs out there anyway.  </br></br></br>  <br>Weird. I have orientation for a new job around the same time. Never the less, I am hype and have already seen the spoilers so will most certainly not stay away.</br>  <br>I never read the spoilers. I was at work when they were first posted probably.<br><br><br>It's more uptraining for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;implying the "offensive" tumblr blogs aren't remnants of 4chan raids </br>  <br> They're honestly not <br><br> It's just a blogsite with clique like communities, deal with it </br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br> Nevermind I tracked him down but it doesn't seem to be on the broadcast list. Do you happen do know the Douyu # I can't navigate this site for shit </br></br>  So how long will subs take?  <br>Sometime between next week and the heat death of the universe.</br>  Who else is live watching? are we having a live watch thread?

God damn it, why can't we just speak about how excited we are for Season 3 eh?</br>  I am sorry for your threads<br><br>Symphogear deserves better than what /a/ is offering</br></br>  <br>You're posting like a faggot because you didn't lurk nearly enough.

Every reply you giving contributes in making the thread much shittier and possibly making the thread unusable.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127523728 <br>Anon please today is a good day for all stop this madness.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127523624 <br>You're pathetic.</br>  <br>I'm not an offsiter what the fuck, /a/ was my home, commie used to be my home.

Well nevermind, found it while RDPing into my home pc.</br></br></br>  <br>What if I want the thread to die. This thread is full of garbage and getting close to bump limit anyway.</br>  <br> I only visit when Symphogear is airing <br>It shows.</br></br>  <br>I've lurked long enough back in S1 and S2 times, you're telling me one year makes such a big difference? And that I can't act the same as i did back then? Nice.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127523728 <br>Please go back to the madoka thread. You and I both know he was trying to stir you up. Stop responding.</br>   responding   <br>It would make me sad that somebody who cares for the thread actually wants to see it die so early on the day of the GX premiere, but if that's what you want, replying to him as much as you can would indeed be the best course of action.</br>  <br> commie used to be my home <br>I can't take you seriously anymore. You're clearly just baiting. Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>see</br>  <br>Anon there are ways to do light blogshit and show your merch without causing this kind of response. Save the all caps posting for a live watch thread. <br><br><br>Much better this thread dies and someone makes a standard live watch one an hour before or so.</br></br></br></br>  Would you faggots stop replying to this god damn retard already<br><br>Literally 4 hours left till it airs and you faggots are falling for the biggest bait</br></br>  <br>Yea i know. I was trying to plead with his humanity.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127524079 <br> If you can't prove you're not treating the characters like shit then you're wrong. <br>Don't worry man I asked Bikki and said she didn't mind since they are just drawings of her, she knows that whenever we're actually together I respect her love.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127524079 <br>Explain how asking you to have fun on the new seasons premier with the rest of us downboating.</br>  Those who read the spoiler, how do you think the first ep will be? More plot or action?  <br>Too many have tried before you and failed. It's a lost cause.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127524079 <br>Please anon, inform me about how treating fictional characters in 'degrading' manners is bad?</br>  <br><br>Shut up retards.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127524181 <br>Now now. Where did i say that shit posters get a free pass? I simply said to just ignore and report like a normal /a/ poster would do. Thats all you gotta do. There is no reason to flip your shit unless you are trying to ruin the thread with your crap. Just knock it off. Its obviously just causing them to post it more when you react the way you do.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127524181    <br>No I'm actually serious, I was in training at commie, iuntil some gigantic faggot banned me. they do a good job on symphogear. Apart from the whole 298 yen debacle. Now that was hilarious.</br>  Are the threads gonna be like this until we get subs? Where are the memes?  <br>The thread is near bump limit anyway, make a new one for the livewatch<br><br>Watching him put the effort into typing long shit out is fun anyway</br></br></br>  <br>Action, action, Hibiki navel, action.<br><br><br>Umakoshi's poses are worth referencing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it'll be more plot. Little action at the start. Concert. Shit hits the fan but not much action just yet. I doubt they'll conclude the fight scene in the 1st episode.<br><br> I'd be surprised if they did and   Tsubasa loses before Hibiki gets attacked so we feel that Hibiki's in danger too. </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127524287 <br> why are you not telling him to leave <br><br>Because i know that he wont. Hes just posting that to piss you off and you take the bait every fucking time. Just quit already buddy. We both know they wont go away. You are the only deciding factor on it. If you dont respond to it for a few threads, they will fuck off. Its that simple.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anti-crack anon is a bad guy at heart, he's just ridiculously stubborn and has no idea how to empathise with someone else's view.</br>  <br>No memes yet Chris wait till after the episode airs.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127524287 <br> Sarcastic answers don't prove you right either <br>I wasn't being sarcastic, Bikki is actually very accepting.</br></br>  <br>Welp hopefully the concert will deliver.</br>  <br>hopefully only as comic relief</br>  <br>He's been at it for over a year with hilariously bad "logic". He's obviously shitposting intentionally.</br>  Fuck it, im just gonna post Miku till everyone shuts up  <br>Indeed, I love going through and seeing all the references.</br>  <br>I'll help you out with that.</br>      You're not getting any more replies from me.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127523624 <br>You realize 3 of those are official art right?</br>      <br>Do you seriously not know who anti-crack-kun is or are you just pretending?</br>    <br> Is it bad that I want this? </br>  <br>We all want more Mikugeah</br>  <br>yes</br>  Those who know moon better get ready, the radio show will begin in 10 minutes.  anyone else remember that robin guy or whatever who would post akkarin every fucking 10 posts and constantly pair tsubasa and miku or some shit? He must've been infectious.    <br>Honestly, I'd be fine with less Miku.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127524678 <br>Your definition of being a shitposter is simply "posting a picture on my index of forbidden pictures". What do you have against free speech?</br>    <br> Watching him put the effort into typing long shit out is fun anyway <br>Once or twice maybe. After the 40th time it's just extremely annoying and kind of depressing.</br></br>  <br>I don't but I still want to listen, the link ends in 474 right?</br>    <br>Yes.</br>    <br>Thanks anon, enjoy this Miku.</br>  <br>It's even better when you know that it says 'gattai' on the corner.</br>  Miku is the cutest and I'm rooting for her to finally consummate her relationship with Hibiki this season  <br>Their PJs are adorable too. I wonder if they trade every now and then</br>  <br>YOU SAID 10 MINUTES<br><br>ITS BEEN 13<br><br>WHERE IS IT</br></br></br></br></br>  3,5 H TO GX  <br>Miku is the worst, and she is basically worse than Hitler at this point.</br>  <br>what are you talking about?</br>  Is it just me or is neetball's CC offline?  <br>Its not loading<br><br>Webpage not available.<br><br>Fucking kill me</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How come?

Nope.<br>In time to watch subs? Probably. Start watching.</br></br>  <br><br>Mine took awhile, try giving it a minute.</br></br>  <br> tfw hoping that adult Shirabe has Fine tits <br>Also,  Kirika as her dungeon slave </br></br>  From the /m/ thread<br><br>Zoid is translating some of the parts of Hibiki Radio on twitter right now:<br><br> "she's talking about recording sessions and how difficult they are for the actors. Especially GX was even worse than previously " <br><br> "The new enemies are really strong, she can't say specifics but it feels like the heroes are going to lose." <br><br> "She's introducing Miku right now. She says Hibiki and Miku's bonds have grown stronger since G due to the events of the series. Miku won't sing in GX it seems. So she's gonna sing on the radio show instead hahaha" <br><br>Next comes the viewer mail</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, it's working.<br> that intro <br>What's her malfunction?</br></br></br>  <br>Good, mine's working now.</br>  <br> villains have traditional mahou shoujo aesthetic (robe, witch hat, etc.) <br> heroes have mecha/tech aesthetic <br>Is this intentional?</br></br></br>  What the fuck is Iguchi doing.  <br> Miku won't sing in GX it seems <br>Mikugyeah confirmed for kill. RIP. That or pic related.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit, they cannot stop overselling the point on how grimdark a struggle the cast endures in the terror that is GX, can they? And in the end I doubt it's going to amount to any more than a few "shockers" with a body count of 0 at the end.<br><br>Nobody gives a shit about your grimderp, come on, just focus on hotblooded fighting and yuri overtones.</br></br></br>  <br> miku won't sing <br><br>FUCK EVERYTHING</br></br></br>  <br>Drawfag was the best parts of the G threads. Hope they'll be back.</br>  <br> Miku won't sing <br>SHE'S LYING<br>SHE MUST BE TRYING TO TRICK US<br>THEY CAN'T JUST TAKE AWAY MY DREAMS OF A DUET LIKE THAT</br></br></br></br>    Where is the stream? <br><br>Archive as always? I am new to this since justin tv got down.</br></br>  They've recorded 4 episodes already, and according to Iguchi the animation was already pretty well done by the time of the recording. That's great news I guess, they're pretty ahead of schedule.  <br>read the thread</br>  <br>Hopefully this means that they can maintain the quality through the later episodes.</br>  A certain stream site lists GX at 26:12. About 3.5 hours.<br><br> I want to Mikumiku. </br></br>  <br> Miku won't sing in GX it seems. <br> no duet with Hibiki </br></br>  <br>Link pls.</br>  8 character song CD's confirmed.  <br>fucking HELL</br>  <br>Like they would tell us the truth<br><br>Its symphogear afterall</br></br></br>  <br>I sure hope Miku is doing 8 again. That could be a duet with Hibiki.</br>  Is there somewhere duet version of Kirika's song or there's only single one?  <br>On the last bd soundtrack.</br>  <br>It's on the OST, not on the character song CDs. It's called Edge Works of Godess Zababa.</br>  <br>Yeah both versions and the duet are in the ost.

This tension has grown only more acute since the January 1999 launch of the euro, which now binds 19 nations into a single currency zone watched over by the European Central Bank but leaves budget and tax policy in the hands of each country, an arrangement that some economists believe was doomed from the start. </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>SHAME</br>  <br>Greeting, my brother of true taste<br><br><br>I bet your're a kind of those idiots who devote your money for 3Ds, right?</br></br></br></br>  Can we all agree that Ryuu is best girl and it's a miracle she isn't in bellbowl?  <br> we voted for Putin yes-men, because everyone else is yes-men <br><br>There is no saving for you and I hope you get out of the euro zone.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm just here to tell you that Gundam is trash and there are better mecha anime which designs of actually make sense for a fucking war machine.</br>  <br> no season 2 <br> slow LN translations <br> /pol/ niggers all over your thread <br> bell eating any other flavor of ice cream <br>There's no saving this thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no season 2 <br>Meme girl died so don't expect a season 2.<br>It also sold like shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh i don't care about your opinions silly anon, i know about gundam shitposting all too well.<br>But do you have meeting on IRC before the raids ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>You do realize that all you're doing is proving I'm right and you're shitposters, hmm?<br><br><br><br>Cooperating=/=being controlled by.

I'm glad her appearance is at least as she should be, that is, 13 years old. <br><br>Also, Rori is best Gate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's much smaller than the elf.</br></br>  <br>Are you blind? She looks like a little girl.</br>  <br>I she now? I'm not really seeing it, but whatever.<br>This is just a magazine illustration, and what we had so far was her official anime character design.<br>I will stop worrying when she will appear small in the naime.</br></br></br>  <br>No, she does not.<br><br> 13 <br>You mean 18.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> LolisRDead doing "that" again <br>Fuck off.

Where is her sexy underwear?</br></br>  <br>Clearly that dude didn't read or care about it at all.<br>He looked at the anime design and drew something for his money.</br></br>  <br>At least it isn't the ugly manga art style.</br>  <br>That elf seems in need of something.</br>  https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-07-02/crunchyroll-to-stream<wbr>-gate-anime/.90003<br><br> The stream will premiere on July 3 at 1:00 p.m. EDT. </br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>That elf single-handedly nearly destroyed this series for me.

She was basically settling down with Itami as her companion for the rest of her natural life as a mortal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>961 years old I mean.</br>  <br><br>Balls deep in dat butt.</br></br>  <br>she voice like a middle age slut<br>not a 961 years old demigod loli</br></br>  <br> she voice like a middle age slut <br>That is what I meant. Ara ara old lady.</br></br>  A better thing to worry about is Why does Lelei look like a sailor scout?<br>Why does she have blue hair too?</br>  <br>Who cares about a loli when you have that elf on the right?</br>  <br> priestess of the god of death <br> pink child panties </br></br>  <br>There had to be at least one girl with an unnatural hair color, Rory was a no-go and the elf already has elf moe going on, so Lelei really was the only candidate.</br>  <br><br>Because she always had. Her family is from a different world and they all have powerful magic.</br></br>  <br>We'll see if she fits in our charts.</br>  <br>MAGIC</br>  <br>don't worry she gets a mid season upgrade to goth loli panties ~</br>  <br> LRDTHK  <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>This triggers me.</br>  <br>It shouldn't really.<br>Anyway a loli has really just three common characteristics.<br><br> Must be born to a race that has similar height averages to humans <br> Must be below 148 cm but higher than 100 cm <br> Must have A to AA cups. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  So which subgroup is doing Gate?  <br>In the end  she didn't even kill the dragon <br><br> What a fuckup. </br></br></br>  She looked better in the key art, I hope it's just a fuck up.  <br>Not entirely true:  She used a spell that zapped the dragon and the electric current blew the explosives, killing the dragon as opriginally intended. </br>  <br> Pfz 3 <br>Aw yeah</br></br>  <br> I thought Itami hit the explosives at the last second? </br>  <br> Lelei stabbed the dragon with all the swords in the area using the screw principle<br>Tuka cast a large electric spell that used the swords as conductors<br>Itami's explosives caught fire because of the lightning</br></br> </br>  <br>She looks like a loli to me.

When they kill the dragon?</br>  <br>Probably to the end of the japan visit.</br>  <br> Next week baby <br>What? The anime is airing in a little under 13 hours...<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;24  episodes<br>YES! This means we get the Dark Elves and the Dragon hunt!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>24 episodes? No way. Past that.</br>  <br> Probably to the end of the japan visit. <br>The Japan visit was painful. The weakest part of the story. I rather they fast forward it a bit and don't spend more than two episodes.</br></br>  <br> What? The anime is airing in a little under 13 hours... <br>I thought it wasn't till the 7th. So it's tomorrow huh.</br></br>  <br>Monmusu is on the 7th</br>  <br>I would guess so.<br>There's 5 books (adapted into 10 Light Novels), and Book 2 is the dragon fight.<br>So covering up to two books should be fine.</br></br></br>  <br> 18  <br>you mean 800</br></br>  <br> leaving your mouse on the screen and not hiding it in the corner somewhere <br>Literally the worst fucking people to breathe air that could be getting breathed by someone else.</br></br>  <br> 800 <br><br>She's like 980 or some shit.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought it wasn't till the 7th. So it's tomorrow huh. <br>Only on one channel. Western streaming won't be until the latest airing in Japan.</br></br>  <br>It's probably 3 episodes per arc and ending with the dragon. We'll probably see Yao.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about western streaming? Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>Is neetball streaming Gate? I just checked and it doesn't seem like it.</br>  <br>I'll rephrase:<br>Who the fuck cares about streaming?</br></br>  <br>i do my computer is broken so until its repaired i'm going to need to stream</br>  <br>That's too bad, but here's the idea: just wait until it gets fixed and watch it in proper quality and manner.</br>  <br>but then i won't be able to shitpost in the threads</br>    <br> Not black lingerie <br><br>They have just one fucking job and they blew it.<br><br>Frankly this upsets me a litte.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> _master1200 <br>no</br></br>  <br>You will be.<br> Japanese army propaganda! 2 nukes weren't enough... <br> ELF RAPE RAPE ELF  <br> Rory is no loli, hurr anti lolicon propaganda! <br> generic harem shit <br>Or anything else you can think of.

Some scenes during that get pretty gruesome.</br>  <br>You can speak freely here</br>  <br>eh I suppose that's true. Fair point.</br>  <br>much better tbh</br>  <br> androgynous kuudere <br>to<br> generic blob with oddly colored hair #21,491 <br>This is not okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I think Rory doesn't have such a strict loli appeal that a non-lolicon can't enjoy her. <br>Now that I heard her voice, I am going to appreciate the gap moe of having an adult woman's voice coming out of the body of a young girl. Is there a fetish name for that?</br></br>  <br> Pink panties <br>And dropped.</br></br>   10h30m until it airs   Not enough appreciation of Tuka's ass up this is bitch. <br><br>Y'all faggots r GAY!</br></br>    <br>Her hair is blue, just a different shade in the anime.<br><br>All characters look much better done, or at least more modern, than in the manga. The manga art is shit, and lazily done. <br><br>Shading is bad, mouth and nose looks like snouth, and just not doing it for me. I coulg go on but again.<br><br>The girls in the manga aren't cute or anything at all. The anime at least looks good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with this.<br><br>In fact, the hair color change makes me wonder if they weren't trying to make her look like Tabitha.</br></br></br>  <br>Old<br><br>Hag</br></br></br>  <br>Oh.<br><br>still, that specific shade of blue should have been avoided. It's too jarring.</br></br></br>  that doesn't look loli at all<br> fuckin blind faggots</br>  <br>How much rape does this have?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Nah they're gonna do the entire season 1. <br><br>Episode 1-13 = From start to slaying of the dragon<br>Episode 14-19 = Prince Zorzal's rebellion<br>Episode 19-26 = Defeats of Zorzal and closing of the Gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enough to fill an Indian bus.</br>  <br>Any proof it's two cours?</br>  <br>Read the thread</br>  <br>Left, I really like rori</br>  <br>I think at one point group of bandits raped a girl, killed her, and threw her naked, decapitated used body towards her husband<br><br>I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though</br></br></br>  <br> I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though <br>The body actually flew in the manga?</br></br>  <br><br>CIA in full force. Fuck yeah.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty hardcore</br>  <br> filename </br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if they did that. It is certainly possible, especially since they want to promote the upcoming novel sequel and they NEED to finish the main story in the anime for that. Guess it wouldn't be that impossible with 2 cour.</br>  <br>Search by MD5, retard.</br>  <br>Honestly there's a lot of padding in the novel, and in an animated medium it would feel too dragged out if they stick to it. Only reason manga is tolerable at the pace is because it's still a printed medium. <br><br>I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br>I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br> I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist. <br>Seriously, 2 cour was far more than I was expecting and as such I can't really complain.</br></br></br>  Yeah, if they can condense 5 volumes of Log Horizon in 2 cours, I can see 5 volumes of GATE in 2 cours.  <br>Unlike others here I'm not really surprised with the 2 cours. <br>GATE is Alphapolis's biggest title, this is their "make or break" moment. It's natural they'll put as much effort as they can on their big break.</br></br>   24 episodes <br><br>It's been a while since I read gate<br><br>What are the chances we'll see itami  punch the prince? </br></br></br></br>  <br>i thought shortstack chick did that?</br>  Gundam Seed Destiny of our generation.  <br>Itami punched him first, then when Prince retaliated he pulled the gun out.</br>  <br>I just hope they don't rush anything.</br>  This is a relatively peaceful thread so far.  <br>Can't believe I am looking forward to this.</br>  Can anyone improve on this image? I can put the text in a pastebin  <br>The only way you can improve on it is by deleting it from the internet. Sadly it has already been posted so you fucked it up permanently.</br>  I don't feel very excited for this. What are some A1 adaptations that are actually really good?  <br>Someone's sensitive</br>  <br>Stop projecting. That image will only fuel shitposting and you should know that.</br>  <br>Someone's affected</br>  <br>Yeah, make the damn text readable against the background.</br>  someone mentioned being unable to find gates original webnovel version in one of the previous threads.<br>i managed to find it on my computer today.<br><br>www.mediafire.com/download/zriujpo8<wbr>mqtfn2n/gate.zip</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot the biggest thing; "Gate is a work of fiction, so any and all arguments regarding the current state of the real nation of Japan (it's armed forces, relationships with other countries etc) have no relevance to the fictional universe in which Gate takes place."<br>And that comparatively to the majority of American films it hardly qualifies as a 'power fantasy'.<br><br>Also yeah, green text is completely unreadable, and links on images is stupid unless you use a link shortener.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> But they are unbeatable! <br><br>Daily reminder that flips has one of the best special forces that could outperform special forces from developed countries even with shit equipment</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I'm in Japanese locale.</br>  <br>I have the same problem, but notepad seems to work.</br>  <br>Well, that solves it for me as well, thanks.</br>  <br>there are multiple japanese locales.<br>thats what i get when i set webbrowser to western locale.<br><br>$ file Gate.html<br>Gate.html: HTML document, UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines, with CRLF line terminators</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except they're like... double the size?</br>  <br>Wouldn't that be too fast?</br>  <br>Step up, senpai.</br>  <br>Haha.<br><br>But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes  like this guy's saying. This isn't your typical LN adaption.</br></br></br>  <br>But that's nearly two hours of screen time per book which is more than what they actually got and I seriously doubt the GATE novel is that long.</br>  <br>Also, it's a fucking web novel so I'm sure there's some form of dumb bullshit they could cut and nobody would give a fuck.</br>  <br>certainly bigger, but not double</br>  <br>Remember that in this, Japan:<br><br> offered a full cessation of hostilities and a return of valuable PoWs without the usual slave taking and crap, making the Empire think they will be merciful <br> in their very next sentence demanded reparations worth more than all the gold in the Empire, a sum that the Empire could never possibly pay back. <br><br> demanded and gained access to tracts of land that are rich in diamonds, signing an agreement to share the diamonds with the locals, as well as gold and silver. <br> didn't tell the local government about all the other valuable minerals that they could find there besides gold and silver, which could be worth billions back on Earth, so they could scam then out of it all without paying the locals a penny <br><br> after the negotiations and official cessation of hostilities, stumbled on some captured Japanese citizens in captivity, who they somehow they didn't already know were still unaccounted for and they never bothered to ask the Empire before then. <br> responded by bombing the Imperial Senate with JASDF fighters as a show of force with no warning, rather than going through diplomatic channels <br><br> when a prince hostile to the Japanese launched a coup, gave support to a princess who they had more leverage over and would be less of an enemy to Japan <br> even though the JSDF cannot be legally used overseas in the role of collective self defense of an ally, and the public is protesting against Abe's attempts to reinterpret the Japanese Constitution to make it legal to fight alongside the USA overseas <br><br>REMEMBER <br><br>JAPANESE PUBLIC OPINION IRL IS HEAVILY AGAINST LIBERALLY REINTERPRETING THE SDF CHARTER WHICH THEIR PM HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people thinking A-1 won't fuck up   <br>Is 2 hours per arc enough? I think that 2:30 hours is the ideal length of a movie for me.</br>  <br>Fuck up is relative. <br>I for one don't think A-1 fucked up SAO. That was shit from the source.</br></br>  <br>I know a lot of mangafags complained about Nanatsu no Taizai. It was also a complete QUALITY fest in the second half, as expected of A-1.</br>  <br>Seven sins was fine. <br>sourcefags will complain no matter what.</br></br>  This is going to be a war strategies/political anime? B-boring.  <br>Let them complain. It's nothing compared to the turd anime One Piece had become.</br>  <br>Neither was Log Horizon.</br>  <br>LH was a light novel. I meant the format in that post. <br>but basing on the anime it seems like they will adapt the light novel?</br></br>  <br> But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes <br><br>Stop and think about what you're saying here. <br><br>They adapted first 5 Harry Potter novels in to 5 movies, 157 minutes each. That's 785 minutes including the long credits. <br><br>24 episodes of anime is 600 minutes, including OP/ED.<br><br>It's not as outrageous a difference as you seem to think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>You see those 9 colorful books on the top shelf? That's Log Horizon. <br>Log Horizon is most definitely NOT small books. <br><br>Now see the shelf below it. <br>The tiny little books on the left side are the GATE light novels, two of those equal one of the GATE books the large books you see to the right of the manga adaptation on the same shelf)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oops, off by one.. I meant see </br>    <br>What you haven't ever made simple mistakes, Sigmund?</br>  <br> Oops, off by one <br>Yeah, I see that.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it's because they streamlined and cut content from the novel version. It doesn't really tell me anything. As for LH are they really that big? It seemed like Haruhi and Spice was longer than those.</br>  <br>My point is that you did not make a mistake.</br>  <br>The adaptation itself being really good? Hasn't really happened.<br>Stuff like Silver Spoon was serviceable, but simply because of the source's story,.<br>So while it won't be visually amazing, with at least the blessing of 2 cour, it'll be passable and cover new material. All we could really ask for.</br></br></br>  <br>Which episodes will be QUALITY?</br>  <br>I'll help out by marking them</br>  <br><br>But SIlver Spoon was really nicely animated throughout. A-1 vary massively. <br>My guess is that they put a lot of money into this so it should look pretty good like SAO, Shigatsu etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks but I know what's what. <br>I just didn't know those blue books were counted too.<br><br>I'm not confident enough in 5 novels for 24 eps.<br>There was a lot of material skipped for LH as well and it didn't seem long to me when I read it.<br><br>And judging by the art of the anime I think it's the light novels that will get adapted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm reading the mushoku manga, but it's hella slow. How the fuck does he manages to marry the 3 girls, the fuck? (childhood friend, royalty brat, and sensei)</br>  <br>Through years of hardships and impotence.</br>  <br>Got separated from the childhood friend by his dad to prevent crippling dependence by childhood friend<br><br>Traveled the world with ojousama and gave each other their virginities then ojousama left to go train in a cave for years (he thought she was dumping him because she's really bad at explanations and just disappeared one morning)<br><br>Decided to pursue higher education, reunited with childhood friend at college and got married. <br><br>Went on a quest to rescue his mom (leaving his pregnant wife behind) but some people died and he ended up depressed, sensei who he rescued "comforted" him and they ended up calling a shotgun wedding<br><br>Much later ojousama finally returns after having achieved maximum powerlevel just in time to rescue him from being killed by the Act 2 final boss, she marries him and basically rapes him on their wedding night</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a timeskip, or is this loli sex?</br>  <br>What the fuck, I haven't read so far but what. How the fuck are the other 2 okay of him having 3 wives.</br>  <br>Obviously a time skip retard.</br>  <br>juve period &gt;youth period&gt; young man period. Like 3 timeskips.</br>  <br>Osananajimi has her own self esteem issues (even though she's like a crack secret service agent and shit)<br><br>Sensei is just happy to share<br><br>Ojousama is confident in the security of their relationship even if he is married three times, (she also tries to get him to fuck the catgirl maid but he just throws the maid out of the room)<br><br>It's not like he just marries everyone he meets, he doesn't fuck his half imouto maid or the catgirl maid for example</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's kinda sad knowing Rudeus should be more mature than Itami since he's lived a longer life, but isn't.  <br>It could be that he settled down to his new world age and stopped thinking like an old man.</br>  <br> mfw eris gives rudeus erectile disfunction </br>  <br><br>Or you know <br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's been married, went through boot camps, commands a squad of trained soldiers, and a trained ranger <br><br>As opposed to<br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's never held a job in his life, parasytes off his parents, and never dated a girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>elf ass</br>  <br>The point was that pre incarnation Rudeus was a complete manchild who never really grew up, instead running away from reality into eroge and light novels and japanese animes. Hence why in spite of his supposed greater experience a lot of the stuff he says and thinks during Childhood and Juvenile periods exposes his immaturity. And why getting a second life grants him the opportunity to develop in a way that he did not in his previous life. <br><br>By comparison, Itami is a world weary soldier who went through a messy relationship that ended in divorce by mutual consent, animu and mangos is how he finds entertainment not how he evades engaging with society and work.</br></br></br>  <br>Were they divorced? I thought they were just separated.</br>  <br>They're legally divorced. <br>Although the manage to stay friends.</br></br>  <br> brown elf <br><br>are you telling me there's chocolate in this?</br></br></br>  <br>So Rudeus is one of us while Itami is a normalfag</br>  <br>Yes, used and slutty one at that.</br>  <br>even better<br><br>will she be present early?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how far they're gonna go. <br>If they're gonna do the entire First Season you'll see her fairly early on, like ep 10 or so.<br>If they're only gonna do up to the Fire Dragon Arc, you won't see her till well after the first cour.</br></br></br>  <br> pic? </br>  <br> One of those bitches are dead </br>      <br>holy shit fuck yes<br><br>thank you</br></br></br>   Pina doesn't wear extreme boobplate armor <br>I like it.</br>  <br>  pic <br>What is this?</br></br>  <br>Announcement that Crunchyroll picked it up for simulcast. <br>And it also revealed that this will be 2 cours.</br></br>  <br>tnx</br>  <br>Rudeus is who we are, Itami is who we wish we were.</br>  <br>Can't find this without the text. Help?</br>  <br> that pic <br>I feel bad for laughing.</br></br>  <br>That looks greatly more medieval or renaissance than roman. I am disappoint.</br>  <br>You also have to consider the format, it's not like a pocket light novel. Also, the light novel version, which is 10 volumes, is practically 400 pages each volume.</br>  <br>No it's not. It's under 270 pages. I just opened them to see. <br><br>Log horizon is about 350 pages, so Gate is significantly bigger, but not double. Like I said. <br><br>I actually own these books, dude.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's not just shadow </br>  where is chapter 47? what's those lazy fuckers doing?  <br>How do you know about it? Currently manga translation status is the end of slaying of the dragon.</br>  <br>Her wife looks like a landwhale anyway, good riddance.</br>  I kinda want to try to read through this again, but I kinda remember all the scanlations being piss poor.

Like harem or what?</br>  <br>She gets dicked by someone from Itami's squard and he got her pregnant</br>  <br>Who will end up with MC?</br>  <br><br>In the end...<br>MC's main harem are still fighting over his dick, it will never be resolved<br><br>One of the soldier from MC squad marries the blonde drill hair and get her pregnant<br><br>Another from MC's squad who has a monster girl fetish gets together with a catgirl maid<br><br>Japanese Foreign Minister marries a Nobleman's loli</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Japanese Foreign Minister marries a Nobleman's loli <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br> inb4 he got back together with his wife in Japan and discard the fantasy bitches </br>  hour and a half until it airs. <br>Getting ready.</br>  <br> fujoshit ex-wife <br><br>Why would you want that to happen?</br></br></br>  <br>That's the safest choice since he's going back to Japan when the gate is closed anyway.</br>   Stream<br><br>http://www.douyutv.com/meizhi</br></br>   <br>My body is ready<br> I will watch it from work </br></br>  <br><br>I've not been so hyped in ages.

She is unnecessary and irrelevant and should just die. <br>Why? Iroha is a side character. Complaining against her is like complaining against that Finn fujoshi or Saki.</br></br>    <br>i wish she would show expressions like that....</br>  <br>Side characters should stay out of the club room when they don't have problems. Iroha hangs around like she belongs there.</br>    <br>well mayb she did want to join but couldn't cuz she was already manager at football club and a seitou fucking kaichou!!!!</br>    <br>I think one of the reasons I like Iroha is because she inspires so much anger from faggots. It's hilarious. I think I'm German at heart.</br>  <br>Even if she wants to join, this is haremshit and she is interested in the bishounen character and not the main character. People who like Iroha are cucks, and not in the good sense like reading NTR manga/doujins.</br>      <br>It's not Iroha who inspires anger, it's Irohafags.<br><br>Most people don't mind her one bit, but the retards who constantly screech about her have driven the rest of the fanbase, including a significant portion of her own fags, up a wall.</br></br></br>      <br>You should be dumping in the other thread.

There's no way a volume can solve so many unresolved conflicts</br></br>  So I have these theories about Iroha an Yukino. <br><br>Iroha likes Hayama but she seems more interested in what 8man's preference in chocolate is than Hayama's. It is odd to base your chocolate around who you're giving obligation chocolate to instead of the one you really want it for. She also seemed to stop what she was doing when Orimoto started talking to 8man, which is a move that other girls who like 8man did.<br><br>I have a suspicion that Iroha likes 8man and it using her "crush" on Hayama as a way to get close to 8man without triggering him and to bypass Yui's/Yukinon's anti-hussy sensors. She even forced an indirect kiss on him.<br><br>I suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.<br><br>Does anyone have any theories on Yui?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ie why there won't be time to develop the romance if it does end. at best yukino and hikki's problems end up coinciding.<br><br>Hopeful for more though since vol 11 afterword suggests vol 12 is the climax, not the finale.</br></br></br>  <br> Watari won't follow Yomi's path and make Hachiman fal in love with Totsuka <br> "Ah, um, okay." <br> The end <br>Moreover, this is a light novel, even if it does conclude at twelve, expect asspulls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui is secretly a lesbian and only using 8man as a pretext to get closer to Yukino.</br>  <br>This is not a Fate thread.</br>  <br>Excuse me, Yui doesn't have any problem with a harem. Yukino will be her wife and 8man her mistress.</br>  Why are you Oregairufags still around? Your poor man's Haganai is over. <br><br>Totsuka will win, like Yukimura.</br></br>  <br>so its bisexual instead of lesbian. Sasuga Yuigahara-san.</br>  <br><br> 122,607 copies Vol.11  <br> 12k BD volume 1 <br> Ending at Vol. 12 <br><br>It's like you guys don't know how this industry works</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> 8man her mistress </br>  <br>Abnormally shit taste.</br>  <br>No, I don't think you know. At best, the 13th novel is the final volume but purportedly Watari's contract stated 12 volumes.</br>  Only way irohafags can stay relevant is spamming a thread everyday after the show ends. Pathetic.  <br>I don't know why there are so many people obsessed with their ship's more popular than others, it's a fucking taiwanese cartoon character's romance for fuck's sake; the fact that it came from Facebook isn't helping it either</br>  <br>Did they realize they are not /u/ enough to ship? Pretty sure only /a/ knows the LN spoilers right?</br>   have a 11/10 gorgeous long, black haired girl that loves you <br> have a very cute and very sweet girl who has a 10/10 body that loves you <br> they accept who you are <br> they are friends so no drama if you choose on over the other <br> people keep acting like this is a bad thing <br>8man has it made. There is no way this can go wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pretty sure only /a/ knows the LN spoilers right? <br>As if people care<br><br>/u/fags secured their foothold in /a/, even more than /v/ did.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people like Yui? I'm honestly asking. Is it that she sympathizes with 8man? Her tits?  <br>Why would you dislike Yui?<br>No autism, no pretense, only lack of spine at worst.</br></br>  <br> Her tits? <br><br>you just answer it yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>dumb and easier to put the penis in  theoretically  if you were self-inserting</br>  <br>If there's someone who can fuck it up, it's 8man.</br>  <br>It's not that I dislike her. I just don't see much appeal in her aside from her ti- character design. But I see so many people praising her as best girl. Which confuses me despite me being aware of this board's shit taste.</br>  <br><br><br>i'm normally one for dfc i just like how genki she is</br></br></br>  <br> purportedly Watari's contract stated 12 volumes. <br>You don't even know the exact terms of their agreement or the possibility of its extension. Saying that this ends at volume 12 is just dumb</br></br>  <br>That's why i asked the reason why their rank keep down though. Oh well i filtered most /u/ related thread anyway, it's amazing to see my catalog page looks so empty these days.</br>  <br><br>This is exactly how I feel except about Yukino.<br><br>She's just such a boring, derivative, generic character. It is utterly baffling to me that someone could  genuinely  prefer her to a more interesting girl like Iroha or even one of the side girls. And yet apparently she has multiple people who think she's the best girl. So fucking confusing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Liking Yui is not a shit taste<br><br>Liking Whoruno on the other hand, is.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel the same. Which is why I prefer Iroha and Sensei.</br>  <br>She is a good girl. She is more loving and accepting than most of the heroines I have seen in chinese cartoons. <br><br><br>The only way he can screw it up is by not making a decision or rejecting both in a hurtful manner.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is a side girl </br>  <br> le meme bait </br>    Well? No Yuiposting?<br>Are the YuiBros dead?</br>  <br>Don't know about the others but I became a Yuikinofag before S1 aired because of Yukino &amp; 8man's 'Hachiman points' banter in volume 4</br>  <br>Yes, I am alive. I might be the only one.</br>  <br>I have a feeling you were baiting, but I will bite.<br><br>Normally the strong, smart, independent girl like Yukino is my type of heroine (okay, the "strong" and "independent" parts are in question for now, but that was how she was in first half). Yui only has her genki character to go with - that was my impression on the first volume.<br><br>Eventually, though, seeing her continuously chase after 8man even with all the suffering she got just kind of moved me. Effort should be rewarded - that kind of feeling. Add in the revelations how she is kind to everyone, put a lot of effort into stabilizing the club, always gently &amp; lovingly support 8man and even willing to sacrifice her chance to help her friend and I jumped on her ship. How could anyone want such a sweet girl to suffer?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm still here.</br></br></br>  <br>They were killed in the last thread</br>  <br>Sure thing m8, you keep believing that.</br>  <br>Still here.<br>Not going to fall for the low quality bait.</br></br>  <br>Speak and I shall heed the call.</br>  <br> all this normie bait <br><br>well at least Iroha is good for something</br></br></br>  Irohasu~   Yuifags <br><br> mature grown-up looking for a stable and peaceful relationship <br> sympathetic <br> pacifist - hence the least amount of shit posting <br> passive <br> attracted to a character for her personality rather than looks <br> in touch with their inner feeling - hence many Yuifags use art as a medium to express themselves.

Bane memes general.  <br>What happens in the director's cut of episode 12?</br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>I'm really glad I only watched the show after the finished ending came out. The original ep. 12 is just utterly jarring and incomplete.</br>  I just watched episode 0 of of the second season. Since when was Rui a Gatchaman?  <br><br>Guess I'll go download insight and the director's cut episode. Man can't believe how times flies, it aired 2 years ago.</br></br>  <br>OD recovered Rui's NOTE and it became a GatchaNOTE instead of a KatzeNOTE in the revised last episode S1.</br>  <br>WTH, that williams syndrome girl got 2 gatcha notes?</br>  <br>I don't think the show was that incomplete or abrupt when it ended. The director's cut is weird too in its own way. The ending of episode 12 is a bit of a shocker &gt;what, now Katze is in her boobs, dafuq? But the most of what episode 13 does is show how, but the process, and events leading up to how are really weird and off the wall too. Not to mention all of that could have just been shown in some part of season 2 to resolve the cliffhanger.</br>  <br>It's Berg Katze's note.<br>It happened in the Director's Cut of episode 12 of S1</br></br>  What is it that Utsusu is saying all the time, literally? I've seen it translated so many ways  Wonder what Katze's note will do in Hajime's hand. Probably a backfiring ace or something. <br><br>Can't wait for the back to back like they did briefly in ep 0</br></br>  but will there be more rui abuse???  <br> Which will break first.

And he can create crowds, those are part of his Note too.<br><br>He's also a genius who made X and now X can autopilot his car.

Being a slut is gonna be so fun.   <br><br>Best girl? Best girl.</br></br>  <br> tfw its 8min long <br><br>Better than expected.<br><br><br> Only 4 chapters <br> Announced as a short months ago. <br><br>How slow are you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Please stop calling her a slut. The subs aren't even out yet.</br></br>  Anime/Manga wisdom thread.        <br>Does this count?</br>  Fuck off. Happy merchant is our friend.    <br>OY VEY SHUT IT DOWN</br>  If you want the context, they just both fell through the rotting floorboards in the room.    <br>What was the author of Magi thinking when he wrote that arc?</br>  <br>She's red pilled. The jews fear the samurai.</br>          <br>That a racist antagonist was being racist. Too bad tumblr shits like you too dumb to differentiate between a work featuring racism and actually being racist.</br>    <br>The same thing Araki was thinking when he made a Nazi into one of the good guys.</br>      <br> racist <br>Shitty word invented by the cancerous jew commie Trotsky. Please stop using it.</br></br>    <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br>        I'm a good goy  <br><br>That a work of fiction can feature racists without being racist in itself.</br></br>    <br> 874x698 <br> 1.05 MB <br><br>Whoever made that image should commit sudoku.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Why are you calling a perfectly realistic depiction of a jew racist?</br>          <br>Anime girls love men who are "Yasashi"<br>That's the main reason most of them fall in love with MCs.</br></br>  <br>Add the internet and Magnostadt's bottom levels would be like a NEET's paradise.</br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br>    <br><br> &gt;implying that da joos aren't the biggest racists </br></br>  <br>This is the most correct thing in this thread.</br>  <br><br>This conversation is getting nowhere is should stop</br></br>  <br>I really think this particular quote is overrated, I liked the analogy about the value of money, motivation and the basketball hoop better.</br>  <br>Hehehahahaho OK we get it you don't like Jews but pol is that way</br>  <br>that doujin was hilarious</br>    <br>She is such a fucking cunt.</br>  <br>And yet all the neckbeards think that women telling them they're nice guys is a good thing. <br><br>Don't be nice - be kind.</br></br></br>  Is he right?    <br><br>All fiction have some basis in reality, so it's correct.</br></br>  Here you go, the most wisdom-est thing you'll ever find.  <br>of course<br>can't write interesting stories if you had a boring life</br></br>  <br>no he's retarded, humans have this ability to imagine New things</br>  <br> he thinks there aren't Jews like that in real life <br><br>http://crownheights.info/jewish-new<wbr>s/29404/rabbi-ovadia-yosef-gentiles<wbr>-exist-only-to-serve-jews/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>you can't imagine new things without inspiration</br>  <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  <br>This is the basis for escapism, so I'd probably have to say that in the short term its pretty correct.<br><br>All fiction has some roots in reality, but I would have to say that if reality itself were more entertaining that fiction would have no merit. If you agree with this quote, why don't you yourself stop watching anime and go get all of your entertainment from the outside world, if it is so effective?</br></br></br>  <br>Which comes from shit that they've experienced.</br>  <br>A story doesn't necessarily have to be realistic, but if it doesn't reflect on reality in some way, it's nothing more than escapism. Fantasy for fantasy's sake is boring.</br>  <br>Somewhat, but on the other hand, since fiction is constructed, a story has the potential to be much more interesting and a much better experience than real life.<br><br>Also he completely disregards learning through the experience of others, which is one of the biggest reasons society managed to get where we are today.<br><br><br>But something can be better than what they were inspired by. Reality is a diamond in the rough, fiction is grabbing that diamond and refining it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>The word would exist because simply of the existence of the suffix unless you got rid of the word "race" too.</br>  <br>It's that you Marche?</br>  <br>You seem really interested in this topic<br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0Ji_Y<wbr>7YEbKY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Magnostadt is literally an allegory for Israel.<br><br>Al-thamen literally represented the learned elders of zion.<br><br>the Baldadd arc was literally an allegory for the jewish control of the central banking system.<br><br>Unfortunately the author abandoned this awesome political-history-themed shounen manga before he could do an epic communism arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Al-thamen literally represented the learned elders of zion. <br>Not since the reveal that it was just the crazy ex-girlfriend of Solomon.</br></br>  <br>The problem is the negative meaning it carries due to jewish brainwashing. Jewish commies are the greatest criminals ever walked the earth yet they don't get the same treatment as nazi.</br>    <br>Basketball hoop? What was that one about?</br>    <br> jewish commies <br>That doesn't make sense, /pol/-kun.</br></br>  <br>I thought it was his crazy ex-teacher he never gave the D too</br>  <br>Fuck off marsh, jesus christ</br>  <br>Jewish can be a statement of ethnicity, religion or both.</br>  <br>Jewish bolshevism started german civil war at the end of WW1. What, you didn't seriously think Hitler just randomly put two groups of people together into one super enemy?</br>  <br>I like this show. Why wouldn't it become a full-fledge animu?</br>  <br>because you like it.</br>  <br> this is what edgy normalfags really believe </br>  <br>yeah, that whole arc was a bad idea.</br>  <br>Do you know who invented communism and financed its victory in Russia, you clueless parrot?</br>  <br> good looking people are treated well <br> have a positive life experience <br> decent chance of growing up decent <br><br> ugly people are treated like shit <br> have negative life experience <br> decent chance of growing up mired in resentment </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its true, but there's only so much some can do to better their appearance. <br><br>to judge someone just by their appearance is extremely shallow.</br></br></br>  <br> caring about race <br>top cuck</br></br>    <br>Over the long term, of course<br><br>But what do you expect strangers to judge you by in passing? You don't think they'll treat the smiling pretty girl better than the dour pock-marked hamplanet?</br></br></br>  <br>oy vey</br>    <br>We can do better than that.</br>      <br>Not that anon you replied to, but I do find the statement interesting. I don't think its a straight up statement of beautiful and handsome = good and ugly = bad.<br><br>It could be along the lines of really made up looking girls with fake tits and ass being bitches? Or guys that dress up like douches, fake tan and dyed hair etc are in fact, douches?<br><br>Or perhaps I'm giving author/translator too much credit and its just an edgy statement.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>There's a difference between looking good and looking like an asshole.</br>    <br><br>Yes<br><br>Experience doesn't just mean drawing inspiration from, it's about properly representing human interaction<br><br>Imagination is great for imagery, but you can't imagine a feeling. It's why something like Black Clover is so completely awful, the author doesn't know how to do anything but throw tropes back and forth and call them humans even if the concept and art aren't really worse than typical stuff in the genre</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Araki confirmed to be an immortal vampire with a stand.</br>  <br>I guess? Looking like shit (as in the image text) could be implied as looking like an asshole/bitch and not necessarily ugly, is what I'm trying to say.<br><br>Again, I don't know maybe I'm looking too deep into this and giving too much credit to the author. I guess I just perceive it that way.</br></br></br>    <br>Sauce?</br>    <br>Is it just me, or does he look like a white Morgan Freeman?</br>  <br>Create a new color.<br>You can't because you haven't seen it.</br></br>  <br>Here, have some.</br>  <br>can someone tell me the name of this? I watched this way back in 2000s and can't for the life of me remember the name</br>  <br>spotted the ugly cunt</br>   127525509 <br>Wait, is this from the regular episodes or the DVD extras?</br>  <br>kike please</br>  The dick of your soul will pierce the hymen of her heart.    <br>Fuck you, pal, if I could RIS that, I would've.</br>  <br><br>Goddamn it.</br></br>  <br>No, fuck you for being incompetent at searching. I found it with RIS, why can't you, you cunt</br>  <br>extra</br>      <br>There were only 3 books, and we're never getting that third OVA.</br>  <br>I cant buy the fucking disc when they cost 300 Euro each.</br>    <br>Cute isn't sexy, you fag.</br>    <br>Those are words I live by</br>  <br>She doesn't want to diddle puppies and kittens though</br>  <br>Fuck you, ass, because not everyone's RIS works the same way.</br>  <br>Trying too hard, newfag.</br>  <br>Its from the first volume of Kaiji, where the yakuza is trying to convince him to get on the damn ship. Basically, he's saying that when you've got a basketball hoop at regular height (i.e. you've got a steady income stream), then anyone could take shots and get good at basketball easily. But if the goal was like 100 feet high (you have no income) then there isn't even any motivation to try and you'll always just suck at basketball and then start fucking with people's automobiles.</br>  this is truth      <br> Show proper graittude to the staff who sweat blood <br>but the money isn't goint to them, its going to the businessmen, like any other company<br>you weaboos clearly put japanese businessmen on a higher pedestral while they're one of the worst in the 1st world to work with.</br></br></br>   noone posted this yet   <br>So much this</br>  <br>Google didn't give me shit.</br>  <br> Fuck you, ass, because not everyone's RIS works the same way. <br>Wow, this is just pure comedy. Are you for real? Since you're a babby to the internet, still like to suck on mom's tits, I'll give you a hint.<br> It's a doujin. <br> And you just made my day. Thanks for the laugh though, faget. </br></br></br></br>      <br> you will never live long enough to witness mankind successfully replicating our cone cells to match those of a mantis shrimp </br>    <br>I'll give you a hint.<br><br> It isn't a doujinshi, you retard. <br><br>Are YOU new to the internet? Because google's searches are 'personalized'.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hurr I read the oatmeal I'm such a nerd xD </br>  <br> oatmeal <br>dare?</br></br>  <br>Swing and a miss.<br> I actually learned that from zefrank1 videos. </br></br>  <br> &gt;oatmeal <br> dare? <br><br>every 9fag normie is spamming about this nowadays:<br>theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp<wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> implying bullies will ever acknowledge their victims have changed when they can just keep tormenting them about the past <br> implying bullied people aren't far more independent, mature and intelligent than their delinquent piece of shit bullies who know nothing but violence and going with the flow in most cases </br></br>  one of my favourite  Every word on this image drips with hot, sticky wisdom  Finally, UBW is over. Time for this cutie to get her spotlight.  <br>Who has MEoDP?</br>  <br>Is there an interview where Nasu explains this? Why does she go from barely being in the route to having an arbitrary scene with some miracle resolution if in the very next route everything is fucked?</br>  <br>The next route's shit gets fucked because of triggers triggering at the wrong time. Like Zouken seeing Shirou and remembering that he is Sakura's weakness so he uses that to get to her while the war is on and everything goes to shit.</br>  <br>HF is a BAD END that was expanded more.</br>   Censored Heaven's Feel <br>That's absolutely retarded. The sexuality in Heaven's Feel is crucial to the tone of the story.</br>   tfw people say "main-guh"     <br> ... <br>You're just as bad</br></br>  <br> he doesn't know </br>  inb4 Obama clip  <br> ... <br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  I hope Vergo and Monet will comeback to save Doffy for the claws of evil marines.  <br>We don't know if it's a fruit</br>  <br>it becomes a problem when you derail every fucking thread to fujotalk. What's the difference between you and the rebeccafag? people keep reminding you that it's annoying because that's what they think. this is fucking 4chan, deal with it. <br><br>seriously though, what's stopping you from going to /cm/ anyway? you guys would be happy, people that dont want the threads to derail would be happy.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed.</br>  <br>maybe a fucking pigeon</br>  <br><br> fucking Galdino got a character song. TSURU as a character song. <br><br>But no dead characters got a character song<br><br>Besides it was fucking years between the 47 cruise CD event and the last big character song releases right? I think Chopper got a Christmas CD in 2008 and Law alone got a special song to accompany a DVD in 2012.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  5 hours before the anime airing in Japan.
