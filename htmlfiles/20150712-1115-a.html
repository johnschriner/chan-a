[ Who is Charlotte?  Nano desu!  I want to cum inside Nao-chan.  good subs when<br>http://pastebin.com/h11nt5ri</br>   Page 8 <br>Don't be in such a rush.</br>  <br><br>GJM-Mezashite is doing this show, though I don't know when's the ETA of Episode 2. Anyone know?</br></br>    What can the idol even do?  <br>get in line</br>  <br>The problem is, if you had her for your waifu she could troll the fuck out of you all day by making herself invisible just to you.</br>  Finally my long awaited Maeda drama, after episode 1 I was kind of afraid this is going to have just bad comedy but now I can feel safe that it's authentic Key title.  <br> Nao going invisible from her being embarrassed for the pleasure of being cummed inside </br>  X man the anime is not bad.  So is Udoh the red man?  <br>They are just member of Gaia</br>  <br>Gaia is more like green peace taken to an another level.</br>   an invisible girl that is always listening to music   and is best girl     character from Castlevania  Who are they?<br><br> you can see long hair dude among them </br></br>  <br>The Occult Research Society.</br>  <br>ZIHEND</br>  <br>Is Kanye going to turn into Magneto?</br>  Do you think the imouto is still a virgin?  <br>Her power is to regenerate her hymen.</br>  <br>The new reaction video for us</br>  Can't she be reported for breaking into a student's locker?  I really hope Sonic gets a girl. He seems like he could be a top tier bro so far, so he deserves it.  <br>You first.</br>  <br>but...</br>  <br>That's not how blackmailing works.</br>  <br> virgin = intact hymen <br>No.</br></br>  if there is such a school full of people with these special powers, how has no one not found out about it yet?  <br>She was able to get MC's medical records in the first episode. I'm pretty sure she has some kind of privileges to conduct the investigations</br>  <br>No, only handful of people have powers there. And it seems like they have some kind of protector. Don't know who yet, though.</br>  <br>I guess the scientsists can do nothing to students of that school for some reason</br>  <br>He attempted murder</br>  I was expecting the first guy with the pictures to be the one with powers and for them to realize this right after finding out that there is no Udo in 2-E class.  <br><br>Did anyone have the translated caption for this image?</br></br>  <br>He should pay for all damage he did.</br>  Kind of makes me want to play Rewrite again.  <br> You know, for someone trying to prevent people to abuse their powers, this dude abuses his powers a lot.</br>  Nips have finished the analysis and it seems like four-eyes paid enough for the sandwiches. Good for hum.  <br>Dem otaku sometimes.</br>  <br>*from abusing their powers</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Anyone else see Qualia the Purple aspects in this? Like the ebil scientists experimenting on them, the girl who is really trustworthy of their "protectors" and wants to bring others under that "protection", etc.  I want fo fuck Nao while she's invisible.  <br>Any new on the new game the three writter are creating ?<br><br><br>So a girl can suck dick and having anal and still being virgin ? But a girl who lost her hymen while doing gym is not ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to double-team Charlotte with four-eyes while she's invisible.</br>  Does everybody at their school either have powers or potentially have powers? Doesn't that make them a lot easier to identify and take in for experimentation?  <br> They are getting protection, retard.</br>  <br>Did they say they're under the protection of something or their school was hidden?</br>  <br>They're in the school for their own protection. The evil scientists cannot take students that are attending that school for some reason.</br>  <br> lost her hymen while doing gym <br>"I lost it in gym class during partner exercises you're still my first don't worry bby" ;^)</br></br>    <br>I'm really curious about this guy. He talks about how Nao doesn't have any friends because a lot of people are scared of her, but he clearly doesn't. And then Nao talks about how she doesn't trust anyone, but she clearly trusts him to help her out, as well as telling him a lot about her past.<br><br>Is this another Hinata and Yuri friendship?</br></br></br>  <br>True. Even when I slept with my gf her hymen for some reason was still intact after.</br>  <br>She likely forces other people away from herself due to her trauma. And she might just have told only the members of the council (all one of them, now two) about her past because they work together.</br>  I could do without the inevitable full on drama and watch an entire series of recruitment shenanigans.  <br>You can always stop watching in six episodes.</br>  <br><br>Not that anon, but what are you trying to say? Because it's entirely possible to break it without sexual contact.</br></br>  <br> for some reason <br><br>lol ok</br></br></br>  <br>I can't stand how the shadows on the legs are not in compliance</br>  <br>Paid too much by the looks of it.</br>  <br>Okay man, believe whatever you want.</br>  <br>Just pretend she's a nudist beach member or something and has a glowing groin.</br>  <br>So, when is the forced romance between MC and main girl going to start?</br>  <br><br>that's because they only animated a single leg and mirrored it</br></br>  <br>Ever heard of horseback riding?</br>  <br> Well, she already told him about her traumatic past and introduced him to her brother even though she has known him for like one week, and she spent most of that time stalking him and watching him being a total asshole.<br> So, two more episodes.</br></br>  <br> He's the one. <br> Also, the MC's working for the scientist side, infiltrating the school and surveying the students. He possessed himself so that he bypassed the 5 second rule and forgot about his involvement with the scientists. This also eliminates any risk if being caught by Charlotte or having his mind read. <br> I'm the script writer </br></br></br>  <br>That's a myth. The real reason is the horse cock.</br>  <br>I didn't really get this either. Is the entire school kept secret somehow, or is there some kind of arrangement going on? And if this mystery person can fund an entire school for these kids, why can't he fund some research to cure Nao's brother?</br>  doujins where "it's teleportation you know, i cant control where my dick goes" when?  who has the best subs for this show?  <br>Me.</br>  <br>I'll give it a ten out of ten if it goes full Qualia.</br>  <br>HS as always.</br>  <br> Everyone is Charlotte </br>  Will the MC get to smirk like a smug bastard again?  You guys told me they were going to fall for each other, not with each other.  Wait.... Is this anime trying to be different for the sake of being different....?   Signing your kids away or money <br>Based nips. What happened to the mom afterwards anyways?</br>  <br> He was going full smug this episode till he realized he was in the same class as those two weirdos.</br>    <br>I want him to go full Lelouch.</br>   Making a school full of potential guinea pigs <br>Is this really a good idea</br>  <br>Doesn't he have full view of her underwear like that?</br>  <br>I hope so, he was actually somewhat entertaining as a smug douche. I'd hate to see him devolve into something boring.</br>  I kind of like the op for this  <br><br>He's used to girl's underwear by now, not like he cares</br></br>  <br>There is a school like that in Evangelion too.</br>   To stop people from abusing their powers and getting caught by the government, we must abuse our powers in blatant, open ways that are easy to track.  <br> I don't want the government to hurt other people, that's why I'm blackmailing and threatening you into silence! <br><br>How the fuck hasn't the government found this school yet? Or is Nao just fucking retarded and its actually a government run school, and she's being tricked into gathering people.</br></br></br>  <br> Well, they just have to protect them till they leave puberty and the evil scientists won't give a fuck about them anymore.</br>    <br> The school might be under the control of some faction that is against the experiments, though I doubt they are protecting the kids just because they are nice.</br>   Nao's brother was the one with key AIDS all along   So far:<br>Charlotte 1 &gt; Angel Beats 1<br>Charlotte 2 &gt; Angel Beats 2<br><br>But will Charlotte 3 be able to top AB 3?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Based PA.</br>  <br> Angel Beats was boring as fuck till they went full drama, while Charlotte already gave us drama, so I expect it to be better.</br>  <br>Just because a girl immediately opens up to a guy about things doesn't mean she likes him.</br>  <br>Charlotte would need a great insert song.</br>  <br>There are two bands in Ｔｈｉｓ show, and one is lead by Uchida Maaya. I think we're good.</br>  <br> It's the first step.<br> First she shares her tragic backstory, then he shares his tragic backstory, then they try to heal each other and fall in love.<br> Anyway, my point was that her telling all of that to a complete stranger who has shown to be a complete douche is kind of weird.</br></br></br>  <br>The 'certain person' (read: Professor X) she's talking about must be incredibly powerful. Or she's being tricked, yeah.</br>  <br>Maybe the protector of the school isn't trustworthy because he's a nice guy. Maybe he's some Magneto motherfucker who cares greatly but only for his own kind.</br>  <br>She mentions it's because there's no reason for her to hide any of it. She's super blunt towards everyone, not just MC.</br>    He is making music with a pillow <br> Just give the poor fucker a guitar or a kid's piano if you are afraid that he might hurt himself.</br>  <br>She told him about her past to show him what happen to people who fuck up.<br>She obviously doesn't really care or feel the needs to hide that past, Sonic probably knows it too</br></br>  <br> OP &amp; ED inferior to AB <br> Jokes are inferior to AB <br> Main girl and Imouto are annoying <br> The sidekick is a stupidfuck <br><br>Seriously man?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's easier to hurt yourself with a guitar than with a pillow</br>  <br>He'd probably fucking bash himself in the head to death with it.</br>  I wonder if we're going to find out Sonic's complete disregard for safety and property is a result of something that happened to him in the past.  <br><br> If he wanted to bash himself to death he has a shitton of things to hurt himself with in his room, like the bed or the walls.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Why is the show called Charlotte? Spoilers?</br></br></br>  <br>Sonic should get arrested on the final episode.</br>   imouto's death flag <br><br>I don't like it.</br></br>  <br>Anon, it's KEY, don't doubt KEY.</br>  Man, the opening is so fucking great.  <br>I think the school just pays for damages.</br>  <br>that's no reason to make it easier<br>not to mention an actual musical instrument is far more likely to get a reaction. likely a violent one</br></br>  Why does this bitch have the need to mentally break everyone she wants to recruit?<br> If you know they are doing it for their imouto/parents then just tell them your organization will take care of that, you sadistic asshole.</br>  <br>Yeah, but he can't tear into those things like he can a pillow or a guitar. Plus, just showing him a musical instrument is an extremely bad idea because it'd probably make him go full PTSD and possibly even trigger his powers again.</br>  <br>you mean key AIDS flag</br>  <br>Best I could do with my shitty paint skills</br>  <br> THEY SCIENTIST! THEY WILL CAPTURE YOU! <br> MY MOM TOTALLY DONT SOLD US <br> MUH BROTHER <br><br>Fuck off bitch</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's all the same. I don't like to see that little bundle of joy suffer.</br>  <br>Dude, it's just like Clannad or Rewrite. Everyone will be daijobu at the end.</br>  <br> used to shred on a guitar <br> now he shreds pillows </br></br>  <br>He just can't remember he's not in the Angel Beats world where everyone but him is an NPC anymore.</br>  Why is Noa so sexual?  <br>Calling it now, the comet's name is Charlotte</br>  <br> Genki Noa is cute, autist Noa is boring.</br>  <br>Just look at her backstory</br>  <br>AB was ultra shit.</br>  <br><br>His dumb ass sure deserves someone smart who can explain to him that he's not teleporting. Teleportation would not make him go sonic speed like a retard. What he does is high-speed movement from a single spot.</br></br>  <br>You promise? You won't lie to me, would you anon?</br>  What does it mean?<br><br><br>It's Nao.</br></br></br>  <br> Noa </br>  Yet another solid episode. Nao's backstory helped me a lot to justify her attitude against those who abuse their superpowers, and I never thought I would be able to see her cute spot too. Such a pity that Yuu loses his smugness and superiority, though. Also, it seems as though "poverty" is the reoccurring theme of this show as Nao's and Yuu's family and the archer guy wanted to lift up their financial crisis by any means necessary, but their issues are nothing compared to Yuzuru who worked really hard to earn money for his sister with terminal illness or Yuri whose family where massacred one day. For now I'm intrigued about the identity of Nao's sponsor and inevitable Yusa's appearance. <br><br>On a side note, OP song by Lia looks great, animation and visual-wise.</br></br>  <br>It means that this show will have an alternate world. This time, that world will be on the comet or something.<br><br>I would keep an eye out for imagery of people standing in space or something.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean the dumbass who is subbing this for Aniplex needs someone to explain to them he's not teleporting.</br>  <br>I bet when the imouto's abilities awaken, she will gain some terrible skill like being able to travel to space but never come back.</br>  <br> Nao's backstory helped me a lot to justify her attitude against those who abuse their superpowers <br>No it didn't. There was no instance of anyone abusing any superpowers in her backstory.</br></br>  <br> Is this the opposite of smug? </br>  What would they do if there was somebody with a power like Momo-chan's in this universe?  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>Sorry to break it to you but he's already getting typical Key MC qualities. He basically asks himself "why I'm feeling things", he will become the nice guy who helps people and goes through various emotions because all the people around him are having such tragic fates. I seriously hope you didn't expect a smug bastard MC from Maeda.</br>  <br>Later it would be revealed that he is working with the scientists.<br>"Yes, im with the "bad guys". Ive been tricking you all along, my name isnt Jourirou HELL! my ability isnt even teleportation, its super speed!"}</br></br>  <br> implying Charlotte is good <br><br>Oh fuck, I realized Charlotte will be the first KEY show for a lot of newfags. It's going to be 2010 all over again.</br></br></br>  <br>it's called pouting.</br>  <br>Don't tell me she doesn't enjoy this. Also she is erotic and a bully.</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Then Charlotte is the ultimate shit as it seems even worse than AB.<br><br> Why do people hate on AB? I liked it when I watched it 5 years ago... </br></br></br>  <br>Already better than Angel Beats it sure is.</br>  <br>To make people want to cum on her?</br>  Wow, he even did the Lulu hands.  <br>He was never a bad guy, he just didn't have any reason to help other people.</br>  <br>They would cum on her.</br>  <br>No, not that power. Nao already has that ability.</br>  <br> Nao's backstory helped me a lot to justify her attitude  <br><br>Yes, i would completely butthurt and act like a complete asshole too if my mother sold me as a guinea pig</br></br></br>  <br>"Isn't teleportation just moving at the speed of light anyways?" Funi slave.</br>  The brother is the comet.    <br>Its premise and plot so far have managed to be even more far-fetched and harder to swallow than Angel Beats, I'll give it that.</br>  <br><br>I enjoyed it too, but I think people just expected more from it.</br></br>  <br> bundle of joy suffer. <br>What if the Scientists already got to her and conducting simple experiements?</br></br>  <br>the comet is charlotte</br>  <br>Just because it's better than shit, doesn't make it any less bad m8.<br>You could say it is better than MoMH (dub, of course) as well and it wouldn't change anything,</br></br>   has ability to create any sound he wants <br> uses it for post rock instead of pushing the boundaries of IDM and experimental electronic <br>Why is he so pleb?</br></br>  I want to see that picture.    <br><br>That's the guy making the translation, not the writing.</br></br>  <br><br>It's cum INSIDE, you charlottans.</br></br>  <br> Onii-chan never get to tap this. <br>He is pitiful as fuck ;_;</br></br>  <br>Never said Charlotte wasn't bad though.</br>  if he doesn't like the spaghetti sauce why doesn't he show his imouto some different recipes?  <br>If he can change sound why can't he just fuck up the scientists ears?</br>  <br>I really don't want to reply to you but<br>Fuck off tripfag<br>MAL is just a few clicks away. Just press "m" at your search bar and it will come up right away.</br></br></br>  <br> literally just a picture version of tracing <br><br>Maybe one day he'll use those powers to be a seigi no mikata before they disappear.</br></br></br>  <br>missed the last thread, I see</br>  <br>Why can't he just cook</br>  <br>Here you go.</br>  <br>They clearly have superpower-proof glass.</br>  <br> Oh fuck, I realized Charlotte will be the first KEY show for a lot of newfags <br><br>There are people that didn't watch Clannad?</br></br></br>  CRAWLING IN MY SKIN  <br>I wish I had that</br>  <br>Computer is completely kill and the image doesn't work on mobile. Can someone post what it's supposed to look like after expanding the thumbnail?</br>  <br>You da real MVP Annon</br>  <br>Well she resents those scientists who experimented his brother, so yeah.</br>  <br>Nao a cute! I want to bully her with lewd photos.</br>  <br>But the guy from that Syfy show Alphas slowly brought down an entire building by using the right frequency over a long ass time. Hit the resonant frequency of anything and it will explode eventually. It is literally impossible for something to be immune to that.</br>  <br>I watched 1 episode past the potato star girl back in the days</br>  <br>No, he's Joseph Joestar.</br>  <br>I watched it with /a/ as it was airing. It was the same thing as always, they see KEY, they say 'but this isn't going to be melodrama like all other KEY works!' and then the melodrama comes and they can't stop hating themselves for getting suckered in by the good everything else.</br>    <br>How is he supposed to know the resonant frequency of the glass? Why can't the glass be made of layers of different materials with different resonant frequencies?</br>  <br>That's wrong. What's with the colors on your computer?</br>  <br>Which again has no relation to "people abusing their superpowers". You have made a huge blind leap in logic from one to the other.</br>  <br>why couldn't he call an army of dogs to destroy the entire facility?</br>  <br>No wait, it must have been because jpg.</br>  <br>Her brother didn't quite abuse his powers, but he used them in plain sight to change the sound of his music and that got him caught. Anyone who abuses their power is also significantly more likely to get caught.</br>  I love Nao. I want her to be happy. ;_;  <br>Yeah shitty .jpg quality, my bad</br>  <br>Oh my god, Charlotte is actually Udoh from the future.<br>Unlimited lingerie works soon.</br></br>  <br> How is he supposed to know the resonant frequency of the glass? <br>I don't know, maybe he can sense things using sound.<br> Why can't the glass be made of layers of different materials with different resonant frequencies? <br>Because then either one layer will fail at a time, or taking out one will hit all of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll probably get the idol.</br>  <br>Never underestimate newfags.</br>  <br>I hope to see a frontal one soon.</br>  <br> Anyone who abuses their power is also significantly more likely to get caught. <br>Not necessarily. It's conceivable that there could be powers that nobody would notice no matter how blatantly they are used.</br></br>  <br>Only suffering now, anon.</br>  <br>Highly unpractical and inefficient. Not all materials are pure, so alloys and composite glasses are going to be nearly impossible for him to break.<br>Unless he spent years doing low-freq sounds no-stop, there is no way for him to break it.</br></br>  <br><br>Bless you anon</br></br>  <br> 瞬間移動 <br>Literally "instantaneous movement", though a popular dictionary says 'teleportation'. In anime I've seen, it usually means literal teleportation, as in Goku's case for example, but since the definition of an 'instant' can be a little shaky, it kind of makes sense to apply it to someone who just moves really fast and reaches his goal 'in an instant'. He even emphasizes how his ability is literally 'movement done in an instant' like the name suggests, but that also was fucked up by translating movement as teleportation again.<br><br>Those subs bothered me as hell too.</br></br></br></br>  The ED just screams 'We wasted all our budget for the OP'.  She's right you know. Stop cooking for yourselves and instead buy proper microwaveable meals you poorshits.  This reminded me of Edgeworth's office.  <br>I was basically cringing the entire scene where he's explaining how it's an imprecise burst of speed except none of it made any fucking sense because the retards subbing it kept calling it teleportation.</br>  They should've called R07 instead of Maeda.  Real life scenes from the first episode:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=k-k<wbr>RnB8A8iU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Neato.</br>  <br> LaBomba </br>  <br>I'm a sucker for piano music like this. It makes me smile for some reason.</br>    <br>R07 is even worse though</br>  <br>It would definitely be FUN.</br>  <br>A new Royal daughter in uk?</br>  <br>Blue eyes are in the OP. Yellow is probably Kanye.</br>    <br>Is there a name for files like this where the thumbnail and expanded version are two different pics?</br>  <br>MC-kun should've teamed up with Archer and taken control of her instead to made her do lewd things.</br>    <br>I knew it reminded me of something, fuck, it looks too similar.</br>  I desperately need to see Charlotte in casual clothes.  <br>This.</br>  <br> inb4 he does the jump </br>  <br>Just wait for the inevitable beach episode like everyone else</br>  What the fuck is this? CR is giving me aids.  <br>What is this feeling.</br>  OP 8/10  God damn it, Lelouch.    Weak 2nd episode but sort of expected. This show is gonna be like AB, a few lackluster episodes followed by an emotional Key ending. People who keep watching it will praise it.  <br><br>You're totally right.<br><br>This is like a complete Key ripoff and all the characters are just dyiiiing for us to cry for them. It's completely stupid. I hate this shit.<br><br>3rd episode either works or doesn't, after that I'm out. 1st was bad. 2nd was also bad. Unless the third is anything other than some guy plagiarizing Key's worst work, well, I just don't want another of these shows.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Already this show is better than Angel Beats. Smaller cast, pacing isn't totally fucked and it seems like we'll actually get to know the cast this time around before we're expected to care about their big emotional moment.</br>  <br>Cute!</br>  <br>To be fair, her speech quirks in Japanese are cancerous.</br>  <br> This show is gonna be like AB, a few lackluster episodes followed by an emotional Key ending. <br>You mean a few lackluster episodes, mixed in with a few memorable episodes followed by an emotional Key ending.</br></br>  <br> not liking the nano desu </br>  <br>Can't tell if sarcasm.</br>  <br>Nano desu is fine. It's the samurai speech that makes me want to choke her.</br>  <br>What part of Japan is this?</br>  <br>nano desu is forced moe, just like death death and shit like that</br>  <br>she annoying as fuck gozaru</br>  <br>She can't fucking pick a quirk and stick with it and it bothers me.</br>  <br><br> not liking -de gozaru <br>Die.</br></br></br>  <br> i know it'll be sad so that means the show will suck <br>ah, no.</br></br>  So, this shows is essentially Mystery Men and Angel Beats starring Fino, Hina and Kanie?  <br>dank</br>  Would you a lolimori?  <br>I would examine her body if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>I would make her dinner and  spoil her with a new ipod </br>  <br> doujins when?</br>  <br> ipod <br> You don't deserve a loli.</br></br>  So this is Haruhi?  Imouto's ability is the touch of Midas. Instead of gold, everything she touches turns into pizza sauce.  So drama unfolds, imouto gets blown to pieces and MC goes full Lelouch/Righclops.<br><br> we were wrong, our power are growing beyond the point of containing them <br> why contain it? </br></br></br>  <br> key ripoff <br> written by Jun Maeda </br></br>  <br>She's a medium whose dead sister can possess.</br>  I honestly hate dere Noa or Nao, I don't remember.<br>I liked her better when she was rekting the MC.</br>  <br>She's not dere though.</br>  If you cum inside Nao while she's invisible, would you be able to see your cum entering her womb?  <br>She hasn't been dere yet. Just innocently cute.</br>  I can't tell whether Nao is mentally broken or not.  Niggah you stupid or what?  <br>Nao is shit</br>  <br> Who is Charlotte? <br><br>The meteor shower</br></br></br>  <br>I never knew I had this fetish until you said that.</br>  <br> MC turning into a beta faggot episode 2 <br>Dropped</br></br>  So will mc turn back to edgelord? This moralfaggotry is getting annoying  <br>I was thinking that earlier. The conclusion I came to was that you can't see the food she's eaten so you wouldn't be able to see the semen either.</br>  <br>What a shame.</br>  <br> people are still calling it moralfaggotry <br><br>Guess the pain of not being able to self-insert was too much for them to handle.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This was pretty obvious from episode 1. Personally I feel the characters have some chemistry, can't wait to see how they ruin it later into the series.</br></br>  All these faglords saying "muh cerea best grill" or "Muh papi/miaa best grill" and not fixing their shit taste.<br><br>Ladies and Gentleman this is the best girl and the only one who deserves to win Darling bowl.</br></br>  You mean Lala right?   <br>That's a weird way of spelling Cerea.</br>  <br>Lala's not even in the running.</br>  <br>Can you stop making these shit OPs? Actually, stop making these threads altogether.</br>  <br>Why are her fingers so round?</br>  The last thread hasn't even hit page 10 yet, you dumbass  Reminder: There isn't a girl better than Suu.  <br>Can you leave these threads you secondary piece of shit?</br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br>Ofc he means lala who else.</br>  <br><br> Butthurt animeonlyfags trying too hard. </br></br>  <br>Fuck off and stop turning monmusu threads into a shitty generals</br>  <br> where ever I go I must rape. </br>  <br> she might not show up until episode 6-7 </br>    <br>I have finally learned to accept this fact, and I don't regret it</br>  <br>Or, you know, some common fucking sense that you don't start another thread of a topic while the other one is still alive.</br>  Is it bad that I really only have a passing curiosity in this? I love the idea of monster girls (and finally being done right without the really shitty fetishes) but I just can't watch most anime anymore.  <br>You should read the manga instead, then. Let's you go at your own pace.</br>  Take a look at your surroundings.

That is literally the only form of discussion you will ever find in ANY anime which involves one guy, and at least two girls.

Thanks /a/   A big, hairy spider skitters across the floor of your room; its eight, long, rangy legs moving almost robotically. It stops. Horrified, you picture its fangs clicking together, and its many eyes jerkily twitching to and fro. Suddenly, the spider scuttles under your bed. Though you wait five minutes for it to reappear, it does not. Will you be able to sleep tonight, knowing that a monster lurks below?    this thread  <br>Damn nature, you scary!</br>  <br>why</br>  <br>Who's Crabman? He's wrong. All of Okayado's earlier stuff has Arachnes with human pussies where they would be on their human body, right at the intersection of the two body types.  supports this with the suggestion that her pedipalps are used to hold the made in place.</br>  <br>Poverty</br>  <br><br>I always wondered that. So her horse pussy is legitimately on her horse ass?</br></br>  Not exactly a spider but close  <br> Who's Crabman?  <br>it beggins...</br></br>  <br> who is crabman  <br>This fucking guy.</br></br>  <br> who's crab man </br>  <br><br>Ignore me, for some reason I read 'Cerea' as 'Rachnee'.<br><br>I would still like to know who Crabman is. Unless that's what 'Okayado' translates to.<br><br> I'm new to these threads, even though I've been reading the manga since it started. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Spiders give us the willies for a host of reasons. Their arced fangs, orb-like eyes, and segmented bodies all feed our trepidation, but the primary reason for our seemingly primordial arachnophobia likely stems from how they move. The way spiders motion their angular, jointed legs irks us like no other, psychologists say. <br><br> So why do spiders move in this unnatural, mechanical fashion? Well, it's because they fundamentally move differently than we do. Arachnid locomotion actually makes use of the same force that powers a variety of mechanical instruments: hydraulics.  <br><br> Hydraulics is the process whereby power is generated, controlled, and transmitted through the use of pressurized liquids. A basic way to understand it is to picture two liquid-filled cylinders, each topped with a piston and connected by a pipe. If you apply pressure to one piston by pushing it down, the force is transferred through the liquid to the other piston, and this piston rises with the liquid. Dump trucks, skid loaders, and pumps are all man-made machines that operate on hydraulics. <br><br> While spiders have muscles to flex their spindly limbs inward, they use hydraulic pressure to extend them outward. Almost all other limbed animals have both flexor and extensor muscles, which produce smoother, less jarring, and much less unsettling movements.  <br><br> To extend their legs, spiders rapidly increase pressure in their cephalothorax -- the round, bulb-like midsection to which all the legs are connected. This increase in pressure sends hemolymph (blood) flowing to the extremities, causing the legs to stretch outward. When moving, spiders innately increase and decrease body pressure in fractions of a second to quickly skitter about. <br><br> Far from only powering basic locomotion, hydraulics endows certain spider species with prodigious jumping abilities. Jumping spiders can leap more than fifty times their own body length by swiftly boosting blood pressure in their third and fourth limbs. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I was really that worried, I'd just get it out with a compressed air can and then kill it.</br>    <br> Who's Crabman? </br>  <br>This is the second guy to ask who crab man is in one of these threads<br><br>Secondaries literally need to fuck off</br></br></br>  <br> Not knowing who Crabman is <br>How new are you? Okayado's avatar is a hermit crab. Crabman is a thread nickname for him.</br></br>  <br>They've shown the mating process in-manga.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Clearly I have fucked up now.

It's theorized that hydraulics may enhance genital mobility, potentially improving the lock between male and female spiders during mating. <br><br> Though hydraulics obviously has its advantages, the fact that a spider is basically a hydraulic system gives rise to a key vulnerability. If a spider's cephalothorax is punctured, movement will be severely inhibited, as the system's pressure will drop precipitously. This also explains why the legs of dead spiders curl inward. The hydraulic system has been taken completely offline, while the flexor muscles go into rigor mortis. <br><br> Rigor mortis is a state that many of us would like to see spiders in, but remember, though these eight-legged critters may peak our ingrained fears, they aren't inherently vile or vicious. They construct beautiful works of art in the form of pristine webs and prey upon the animal that is perhaps the biggest zoological threat to mankind: the pesky mosquito.  <br><br>MOSQSUITO<br><br>BLOWN THE FUCK OUT</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But I hate /v/...</br>  <br> Who's Crabman <br>I should slap you where you sit and stand.</br></br>  <br>That's why it's a punishment.<br><br>I looked a while ago and they've gotten worse.

It deserves to be limited to just 2 again.</br>  <br><br>Oh shit I forgot about that card, guess i'm taking trump witch out.</br></br>  <br>Scale 4 with scale 8 is perfectly viable for odd eyes magicians though, but for a fusion performapal, mammoth splash does its job better since you can use it to fuse vortex and beast the same turn.</br>  Why is this the only god tier thread on /a/  <br>No it doesn't.

Are you retarded? Plus rule changes only apply to older cards. <br><br>Stratos will stay banned. I think the OCG is also considering banning it too, since they keep topping and restrict any innovation to the game.</br></br></br>  <br>And that's why it is banned, more if you consider Pendulum.

I'm so happy they aren't forgotten but am outraged that Dark Magician Girls tits got bigger.</br>  LINK  <br>Lets wait then. There's aparently a Q&amp;A session, this gun be gud</br>  <br> Movie is set 6 months after the manga. <br><br> KAIBA is the main focus and made a new duel disk looks like d gazer google glass <br><br> Yugi has a new design, with less leather. <br><br> Kaiba and Yugi somehow end up Dueling in an Arena IN SPACE??? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>@demonatemu on twitter<br><br>Some highlights: <br> @demonatemu: #Yugioh - the Darkside of Dimensions japan spring 2016, other territories late 2016? <br> @demonatemu: KAIBA, Yugi, and a mysterious new person (villain?) darker story #yugiohsdcc #yugioh "The Darkside of Dimensions" <br> @demonatemu: Ryou Bakura was in the trailer #yugiohsdcc #yugioh <br> @demonatemu: Older Yugi design, movie is set 6 months after the end of the manga #yugiohsdcc #yugioh <br> @demonatemu: KAIBA is the main focus and made a new duel disk looks like d gazer google glass #yugiohsdcc <br> @demonatemu: Takahashi is executive producer for new movie #yugiohsdcc <br> @demonatemu: KAIBA will show Yugi a "new kind of duel" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>WANT WANT WANT AWNT</br></br>  <br>I wish somebody would ask him if he were interested in a GX movie after this one, I just wanna see Judai's post DA adventures.</br>  <br>They'll post the trailer online soon, right? The Japanese fans would never forgive America if they didn't</br>  <br> Older Yugi design, <br> <br>my nigga finally hit puberty, hallelujah</br></br></br>  <br>Pls no, remember that Arc-V has budget issues because of the DM movie.</br>  <br> &gt;Kaiba and Yugi somehow end up Dueling in an Arena IN SPACE??? <br>So this is where Kaiba got his obsession with shooting trading cards into space</br></br>  <br>When your corporation dominates a large part of the world, where else is there to go?</br>  <br>Once we get the trailer, somebody should make a seperate thread, since something like that deserves its own topic and it would attract discussion from the rest of /a/</br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkpo<wbr>t_Award<br><br>Kaz just got one of these.</br></br></wbr>  <br> @demonatemu: KAIBA will show Yugi a "new kind of duel" <br>TATAKAI NO DENDOU NI TSUDOISHI DUELIST TACHIKA</br></br>  <br>so this movie doesnt take place in the GX/5D's timeline from what I see?</br>  <br> im-fucking-plying <br>DUERO MODE ON, AUTOPIROTO, STANDBY</br></br>  <br>not surprised, the dude literally created a global pop culture phenomenon</br>  <br>Six months after DM, so, long before GX.</br>  <br>It should, but just earlier before any of those series. GX takes place 10 years after DM, 5Ds is even longer than that.</br>  OH SHIT  YUSEI DARKSIDE CONFIRMED  W.. What?<br><br><br> somebody should make a seperate thread <br>You dont have to worry about that not happening, the rest of /a/ actually strongly cares about DM related stuff</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh boy</br></br>  <br>That's not crab boy.</br>  <br>Looks like him though</br>  <br>I guess blue hair guy with Ankh is our villain</br>  <br>Yugi and Kaiba go to space, Turns out they see Neo space there, Movie opens with Yugi pulling a new pack with Winged Kuriboh in it, he remembers his duel with the duelist in red a long time ago. I just want some indication of Yugi himself knowing what trails await Judai.</br>  <br><br>Dude are we literally fucking getting KAIBA: THE MOVIE?</br></br>  <br><br>Why does he look like Yusei</br></br>  <br>Kaiba is the one with the most fans and DRAGONS, so hellz yeah</br>  <br> GX takes place 10 years after DM <br>More like 8 if DM takes place in 1996, since GX lasts 2004-2006</br></br>  If only Dan Green could still do Yugi's voice and Eric Steward wasn't dead.  <br> Yami in the background <br>I really hope they dont have him come back. Him returning would invalidate the end of DM so hard<br><br><br> Movie opens with Yugi pulling a new pack with Winged Kuriboh in it <br>This wouldnt really add anything to the movie itself though, it'd just be fan wanking things we already know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br/>  <br>That backdrop. You fucking know Atem is gonna show up in this movie.</br>  <br><br>BRUUUUNOOOOOO</br></br>  <br>YUZUUUUU</br>  <br>HOLY FUCKING SHIT. THAT BEAUTIFUL KAZ ART. MY THAT BASED ATEM IN THE BACKGROUND. MY DICKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK</br>  <br><br><br>My guess is that Egyptian Bruno comes from another dimension and will end up tying into Arc-V somehow, just like Paradox did</br></br></br>  <br><br>IAKFCAKSBNDWVNMDSJNDS,VKDSLVBMX,VBL<wbr>XB,MLÑ.BCVM ,<br>BASED KAIBA YESH YESH KAIBA KAIBS</br></wbr></br></br>  Let me guess : Kaiba will  lose   <br>holy shit, when did Kaiba get ripped? Fucking boss.</br>  <br>Egyptian Bruno will get gains out of nowhere, grab Kaiba's head and throw him aside while subsequently stealing the duel</br>  <br><br> Dat Duel Disk <br><br>Literally Arc-V</br></br></br></br>  <br>M.. Maybe Bruno will have some Lieutenant that Kaiba can beat before he loses?</br>  <br>No, he'll have victory within his grasp, then right as he deals the finishing blow the villain will blow up the Earth and Atem will turn back time and intervene in the Duel himself  I'm still mad about Resurrection of F </br>  Will Jonouchi get to do anything in this movie?  <br>Since this looks like Kaiba's movie, there's probably not a whole lot for Jonouchi to do.</br>  <br><br>KAIBA CONFIRMED FOR XYZ SHIT</br></br>  <br> Surprise buttsex </br>  <br><br>a friend pointed to me, that this satellite looks awefully like a duel disk<br>CARDGAMES IN SPACE??</br></br></br>  <br>Joey with you it's never a surprise.</br>  So are we expecting nothing but some better archetype support for Dark Magicians and Blue Eyes or are we hoping Yugi will actually have retrained versions of the Silent Archetype? When Kaiba says a new kind of duel are they preparing for the next summoning method in the game ? After all 2016 is the last year for Arc-V  <br><br>So is no one going to point out Kaiba's Duel Disk is just like Arc-V's, him showing Yugi a "new type of duel", and the title having to do with dimensions?</br></br>  <br> Action Duel </br>  <br>Synchro Summon?</br>  <br>I want him to meet Reiji.</br>  <br>I thought it's last year would likely be 2017?</br>  <br>Oh yeah, new method in a year.<br>And pendulums are still fresh and quite unfinished, damn.</br></br>  <br>I want more DM support. Need to make my Yugi deck better.</br>  <br>They wouldnt push a new summon method in a movie, especially one for nostalgiafags. Dont want to confuse them</br>  <br><br><br>man, it's literally CARDGAMES IN SPACE</br></br></br>  <br>It started in april of 2014. YGO series don't last past 3 years since 5d's</br>  <br>That's what I meant cuz Zexal was 2011 - 2014 so I assumed Arc-V will be 2014 - 2017.</br>  <br>ZEXAL lasted 2011-2014</br>  Better pic   Stage <br><br>ACTION DUEL CONFIRMED</br></br>  <br>SSJSS yusei ?<br><br>Purple is the new blonde</br></br></br>  each YGO series is shorter than the last.<br><br>DM- 224 episodes<br>GX- 180 episodes<br>5DS -154 episodes<br>Zexal - 146 episodes<br><br>It's safe to say Arc-V probably won't be more than 140 episodes. If we're at 63 right now, one year from now will be around 110s, and nearing the end of 2016 we'll be at 130s. Might progress a bit more after that but I don't see it going past spring 2017.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its been a trend, but it's not a rule or anything. I dont think we'll ever have anything DM length again, but it could easily exceed Zexal and 5Ds</br>  <br>it'll probably have 150 exactly</br>  We probably wont get the trailer until after tomorrow's episode  <br><br>OH DAMN MAN THAT'S MY BOY KAIBA</br></br>  <br>138 is my guess on how Arc-V will last. Man, I guess Leoman really won't be the final villain, I wonder how long the Imperial Emperors/ Arclight Family style villains will be. How many episodes do we have left for the current OP/ED?</br>  <br>Arc-V will likely be between 146 and 150 episodes. DM was the original and was tied to the manga and GX, they were still feeling out the whole spinoff thing and likely had no idea how long it'd last. With 5D's and Zexal, they've gotten themselves a niche of three years per series, 5D's went a little over, Zexal went a little under. <br><br>Season 1 of Arc-V ended on 49, so, extrapolating suggests 147.</br></br></br>  <br>It'll last three years, so anywhere from 140 to 150.</br>  <br>The Bruno/Yusei looking guy has a Monster Reborn symbol on his lock of hair and is wearing some Magician/Sorcerer outfit but I can't put my finger on which one<br><br>Reincarnated Egyptian from another dimension?</br></br></br>   TFW Arc-V and Yu-Gi-Oh Movie in 2016 <br> 2016 is the end of Yu-Gi-Oh <br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>They'll throw another basket of money at Takahashi to make him sign off on another series.</br>  <br>He stole Atem's soul with Dark Magic for being the New Duel King/Masta of multiverse with Darkness power.</br>  <br>WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THEIR DUEL DISKS?</br>  <br>DM and Zexal canon confirmed. Kaiba dies in space and becomes Barian while Yugi becomes Astralian,</br>  <br> First feature film <br>But I saw Pyramid of Light in theaters?...</br></br>  <br>That Kaz is involved with.</br>  <br>ARC-V CONFIRMED!</br>  <br>They gonna follow the rules now?<br> inb4 RULES?! </br></br>  I have been catching up like crazy for the jack episode.<br><br>Im on episode 42 rn. will i make it?</br></br>  <br>Ah, I see. I misread.</br>  <br>Post your reactions to each episode for us. It'll help us kill time while waiting for the Jakku episode to start, HURRY UP.</br>  <br><br>Yugi lives out his days dueling kangaroos in the outback?</br></br>  <br>Ok.<br><br>Those 6 or so episodes that they wasted on Yuya qualifying for the tournament? Fuck those episodes except perhaps the Gon ones</br></br></br>  <br>you have 9 and a half hours until the episode airs and 22 episodes left to watch. If you count two episodes as 1 hour you'll need 11 to be caught up, so unless you skip some you wont make it</br>  <br>Fuck me, I'll do it. For Kinguu</br>  <br>Yeah, what else would he do?</br>  <br>I thought one YGO episode lasted like 20 minutes, which makes 22 episodes like 7 hours, which mean he could make it</br>  <br> 2 episodes an hour <br>You can watch around 2 and a half, probably more if you skip op and ed.</br></br>  <br>Bathroom breaks and food</br>  <br>Episodes are really 20 minutes-ish so that's three per hour. Plenty of time.</br>  <br>Yugi grow up so much on 6 months? Did he take hormones or something?</br>  <br> Not pissing in your deck box <br>Its for Kingu</br></br>  <br>That'll equate to about 30 minutes overall</br>  <br> needing to eat while marathoning anime <br>WEAK.</br></br>  <br> @demonatemu: KAIBA is the main focus <br>Congratulations</br></br>  <br>And sometimes there's a recap that take up a couple minutes.

Those arms.</br>  <br> tfw swedens military gender equality policy forces navy to have 50% women on-board </br>  <br>If the show is only about these military guys and girls, not including a goth-loli demi-goddess, a sorceress, and an elf, I think it would be much better.<br>I just want to see modern military wrecking fantasy army, I don't really care about those fantasy girls.<br> That's why I drop this anime </br></br></br>  <br>She's gonna wear human clothes? Sweet.<br>I always loved it in Stargate when aliens wore SGC/Atlantis uniforms and shit (like Teal'c or Teyla).<br><br> And I liked Jack using Jaffa staff weapons, I hope we'll get something similar here too. </br></br></br></br>  <br> women on a ship </br>  <br>They made her generic cute. Even if you go for the "women in infantry" thing it makes her look actually out of place in the anime. She actually looked like an actual soldier in the manga.</br>  <br>Read the Manga, it's probably more up your alley. The anime tried to make the characters cuter and focus more on the girls so they'd sell more figs and BDs</br>  <br> I don't really care about those fantasy girls. <br>Me neither, anon. But this ride looks promising and I'm willing to give it a chance. I just hope for at least some character development, because they really look like a cool bunch.</br></br>  <br>Are the military dudes in the manga relevant?<br>I doubt it because of what this anon said</br></br>  <br> FTL <br>Please no time travel</br></br>  <br>Fairly relevant throughout, although no one really gets any character development.</br>  manga phases out the squaddies completely and MC continues the recon with only moeblobs  <br>They're not main characters, but the Manga in general focuses more on the military aspects that the anime tries to downplay (probably to not send the message "guns are cool" to Japanese kids or whatever)</br>  <br>She looked like a soldier in the light novel art too. I don't know if she was ever on any of the covers for a novel art comparison.</br>  <br>Considering the original design of the prince I can hardly take the novel design seriously.</br>  <br><br>Any pic of them?</br></br>  <br>Tuka looks damn fine, at least.</br>  How could my gate adaptation look so bad when the monster girl adaptation is the best looking anime this season?    <br>I imagine they'll have to if they're trimming out the rape/gore/working girls.</br>  I really liked this part, shame we won't be seeing this old baller again for a while.      <br> That's why I drop this anime <br>It always amazes me what utterly pedantic reasons people will drop a show over.</br></br>      <br>It's gonna be epic the moment they actually need to do anything.</br>  <br>I liked it too, until they had him laugh like a loon, that trope of breaking down gets on my nerves</br>  <br>I see the Japanese really want their empire back. Too bad they'd be vaporized by Chinese nukes.</br>    let's be lucky we even got this to be animated at all. If we tried to adapt Gate in its purest form...    <br>Modern expansion just doesnt work, because the most valuable land is sat on by powerful countries with literal super weapons, best anyone can do is pick on the small nations under the guise of keeping order</br>    <br>They look better than the women on board the ship I'm on.</br>    <br>It would be too awesome for the squints to handle</br>    <br>Now dumping side stories.</br>    <br>That's all I have.</br>  Be honest with me, does this turn to moe moe haremshit? Or does it go towards more politics and world exploring?  <br> Not showing the back cover of Itami's fantasy harem not very happy about Pina hogging Itami all to herself </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> none of the soldierbros appearing on the covers <br>So it was a regular harem LN with 3 magical girls?

Don't be making bold claims like that.</br>  <br>I hate it when they do it.

If so I agree he looks way off there.</br>  I hope they don't cut out the Ride of Valkyrie part.  <br><br>Mage gets jealous when other girls are too close to Itami and she's left alone (check bonfire with dark elf). <br>Elf got past her "daddy" stuff and now calls him daddy in a different way<br>Dark elf wants the dick<br>Rory wants the dick</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope they use same Warsaw Symphonic version in anime.</br>  <br>that wouldn't be a copyright issue would it?

I know both the original and the new LN went up to volume 5 where the gate closes </br></br></br>  <br>The country folk most likely don't have much in common with, or care about what the city folk and military think.

It's possible they drafted a bunch of people, but I doubt it, they usually don't draft soldiers for what they expect to be an easy battle.</br></br>  Best girl.  <br>What?<br>It was not my fault!<br>It was not me, I did not want to do it.<br>I was just little...<br>I did not understand!<br>I did not know what was good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I, for one, welcome our new Hana Overlord.  <br>And who are you?</br>  <br>I'm trying to help your Hana thread.</br>  <br>Hana sure aged well</br>  <br>It's been like 1 month</br>  <br><br>The golden showers have worked wonders for her complexion.</br></br>  <br>But I'm not OP.....</br>  <br>Oh well.</br>  <br><br>Wrong.</br></br>  But can she win the bowl?  I swear to god I will freak out if Hana won't win the Kiyoshi after all this set up.  <br><br>Nope, Chiyo has dibs.</br></br>  <br>She won't win, but they'll start living together on accident and get married on accident and his erect penis will fall into her vagina on accident and she'll give birth to his child  on purpose </br>  <br>perfect ending to the best accidental couple ever</br>  <br> She won't win, but  <br> they'll start living together on accident and <br>That could happen.<br> get married on accident  <br>That could happen.<br> and his erect penis will fall into her vagina on accident  <br>How fun.<br> and she'll give birth to his child on purpose <br>Best end.<br><br>I don't think he will get them to Mary on Accident.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anime only here<br>it seems hanakana's character will be main but what abıut this prez? <br>Wıill we get her to interact with the guys a lot?<br>I don't wanna read the manga after the anime is over because it's more enjoyable this way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mari and the rest of the USC get put in jail along with Kiyoshi but that probably won't happen in the anime.</br>  <br> I don't wanna read the manga after the anime is over because it's more enjoyable this way. <br>Then you don't deserve answers to your questions.</br></br>  <br> Hana <br> main <br>Aside from two GOAT scenes with Kyoushi she has practically no presence in manga. She didnt even get a flashback like Meiko</br></br></br>  Too bad the anime sucks  <br>there will be always someone to shitpost when you don't really need it.</br>  <br>I thought so too, but rewatching it I think the super-fast pacing works well for comedy. It's been a long time since an anime genuinely made me laugh like an idiot, and I already knew the jokes in this one. I think if they slowed the pacing it wouldn't be as funny because it would start to dwell in scenes too long.<br><br>First episode was a 9/10, 10/10 without censorship. We'll see how the rest of the series does.</br></br></br>  <br>Literally "at least she's better than shit" tier</br>  <br> I think if they slowed the pacing it wouldn't be as funny <br>Depends on how slow. Putting jokes one after the other without any pauses isn't good either.</br></br>   Did she actually enjoy getting pissed on?   <br> ______________No.____________ </br>  <br>But there were breaks. One big one was Kiyoshi talking to Chiyo in the tree, him dropping the eraser, the beginning no? Those were down times.<br><br>I really think that this is a case of too many people reading the manga. I thought it was really funny &amp; stopped at a great point. I don't agree with people dropping it or dismissing it solely, because of the fan service though. I think that's unfair.</br></br></br>   no Kate in OP or ED <br>Dropped</br>  Slut mode Chiyo is best girl  <br>I want to fuck those eyelashes.</br>  <br>They don't want to ruin the adaptation even further</br>  <br><br>With the censoring they've already done, they could never hope to animate Mari x Kate.<br><br>A shame, as I would kill to see it animated. That is the single most erotic scene in any Manga I have ever read, better then a thousand doujins.</br></br></br></br>  <br> they could never hope to animate Mari x Kate. <br> Buy the BD baka gaijin </br></br>  So I'm rereading the first couple of chapters again...and I have to say...they followed the manga's pacing pretty well. They were pretty faithful. If they slowed it down they would had to have added extra scenes (they might have done so in the beginning), but no...they kept pretty close to the original panels. <br><br>That must mean that they had a lot of respect for the story and art already and are just making it move, no? The one major fuck up is the shading though. That's about it.</br></br>  <br> That must mean that they had a lot of respect for the story and art already and are just making it move, no? <br>ofcourse<br>Prison School is a Gem, and gems must be maintained carefully<br>The anime even got quite some laughs out of me<br>If they can keep this up for another 25 episodes or so I'd call it AOTYAY</br></br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck I haven't had a good laugh in anime for a long time. Gakuto's face is fucking priceless.  Any other recommended anime like this /a/?  <br> That is the single most erotic scene in any Manga I have ever read, better then a thousand doujins. <br>This guy get's it</br></br>     Wearing each others underwear now <br>Just fuck already.</br>  <br>Kiyoshi looked hot in Hana's panties.</br>  <br><br> tfw that scene did nothing for me because I'm not gay </br></br>  <br><br>I can not wait until the anime gets to this part. The scene with the bottle is going to be amazing.</br></br>  <br>Golden Boy comes to mind</br>  <br> Hana  <br> no presence in the manga  <br><br>My kinda sir Hana is the GOAT and no female is better, yes she may have less screen/panel time then the other hoes but unlike them everytime she appears it alway mean some big is happening</br></br></br></br>  HANA IS SHIT<br><br>SHIT<br><br>KATE IS A BEST</br></br></br></br>  <br>And censoring</br>  <br>You've just named the second worst girl only being beat by the prez little sister! Leave this thread, exit off the computer, get in your car, drive to the nearest bridge and proceed to jump off</br>  <br>How do you live with such shit taste anon?<br><br>I guess that pissfag pandering Hana does really works wonders</br></br></br>  <br>It's not too bad...at the moment...</br>  So, next episode is one of the shower scenes right? Considering how many chapters are p/episode...there will definitely be one of them.  <br>Can't wait</br>  <br>I hope they don't speed through it like the others and give it enough emphasis, it's one of the best moments in the series along with Gakuto shitting himself and Andrenomics.</br>  <br><br><br> having taste this shit </br></br></br>  <br>tfw that scene did nothing for me because I'm a fag<br>fix'd that for ya bro</br></br>  <br>Episode 3 or 4 will, definitely, be the one with Shingo, but the one in episode 2 will be the first one. I think that this Gakuto x Kiyoshi upcoming subplot really helped in making Gakuto such a great character.</br>  <br> enjoying two hotties pleasuring each other is gay <br>I think you are the gay one here</br></br>  whoever this is.  <br><br>link?</br></br>  <br>boku no the fucking manga</br>  <br><br><br>fags detected</br></br></br>  <br>  dat projection <br>This is getting kinda sad anon<br>It 2015 anon, It's ok to be gay nowadays, you don't have to be so insecure</br></br></br>  Absolutely the greatest.  Kiyoshi is a pretty lucky guy, huh? Like less than a few weeks in school and he's already got a date and another girl trying to get into his pants...  <br>Chiyo pisses me off in that she blew it off as just wanting someone to go with because her friend mayumi didnt want to. She didnt think of it as an actual date.</br>  <br><br>it's okay if you're a fag, no need to be so butthurt about it</br></br>  <br>It does make me wonder if she's, actually, going to turn it around one day and realizes that she likes him? I kinda hope not though.</br>  <br>  no u <br>very nice anon</br></br>  <br>Is summer here already?</br>  Will the anime be uncenz. in few days as day say?  <br>It doesn't go up much in the summer anon</br>  <br> Kiyoshi looked hot in Hana's panties. <br>What?<br>Was a new chapter released?</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>THANK YOU</br>  <br>also check here.<br>http://yomanga.net/series/Prison-Sc<wbr>hool/chapters/183/3.php</wbr></br></br>  So, will we be revisiting Kiyoshi, the cross dresser?  <br>What does piss girl's piss taste like?</br>  <br>drinks lots of dandelion tea, so dandelions I assume.</br>  <br>Like dandelion tea, obviously.</br>  <br>Unless theres some reveal of hana/kiyoshi wearing each others underwear infront of everyone that dumbass chiyo will probably think kiyoshi is gay as fuck because she thinks the panties are gakutos. Gakuto cannot catch a break, mitsuko thinks hes a faggot too.</br>  <br>Like flowers</br>  <br>Gakuto brought it upon himself with what he did to Joe.</br>  <br>Earlier everyone thought that they were fucking each other too. Hana's not going to say anything and Kiyoshi won't say anything for Hana's sake. If he did then they'll have to get into the whole story and none of them are going to want to admit that they pissed on each other.</br>  HOW IS A MAN THAT GOT PEED ON SUPPOSED TO LIVE ON?!  GIVE ME AN ANSWER  <br>School opening ceremony scene wasn't even there</br>  <br>Well its going to come out at some point with kate knowing stuff about the two. Its probably going to be kate after losing the cavalry telling mari how she can have someone on her council that doesnt follow the illicit relationship rule.</br>  <br> scene <br><br>its 3 panels in the manga, with no lines of dialogue</br></br></br>  <br>It didn't need it. Lunchroom scene was more than enough to establish that they are the only boys at school and no one wants to talk to them.</br>  <br>I was wondering when is Hana's betrayal going to come back to her. Will it? It would be even better if Kate announced it to the entire school that someone on the USC is having an illicit relationship. Mari will think Kate is referring to them in the bath, but Hana will know that it's her.</br>  I GOT TO SAY FUCK TO A GIRL!<br><br>I'm liking the anime so far, could have been much much worse. Only real flaw is the censorship. and Gakuto's voice is off to me, and he yells too god damn much. I always read him as a calm person most of the time.</br></br>  <br> anime only <br>get the fuck out.</br></br>  <br>He yelled a lot in the beginning, once his  hair got cut   he stopped yelling as often.<br><br>Is there any info if this is going to be 2 cour or one? I think they could fit the prison escape arc nicely in 1 cour, buuuuut... It's not as bad as I expected and I think I want more. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 12 episodes. And it shows with the 5-6 chapter per epsiode pacing. It will just get quicker to rush to the ending.<br><br>Fuck I hate rushed adaptations.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There really isn't any other point in the manga that is suitable for season 1's end other than the freedom at end of volume 9. Rushed adaptation is pretty much a given.<br><br>It might not be too horrible since the manga doesn't really have a huge plot advancement/chapter ratio compared to others.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's better not to be too optimistic, nothing ever comes out from it. My hype is mostly lost, but I still hope they can surprise me.</br>  I'M TURNING INTO A FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLL<wbr>LLLLLLLLLLLL</wbr>  lol  <br> I need to see penis <br>Unless you're a woman, not liking girl on girl is extremely gay.</br></br>  <br>Wonder how well that will get animated.</br>   ch. 183 already available in burrito language <br> not in english <br>fuck is this shit</br></br>  <br> tfw yuri normally puts me to sleep but got a semi reading that scene <br>Yer a faggot Harry.</br></br>  <br>If you read the thread or use the archive you wouldnt look so retarded.</br>  <br>Hmm a pissfag or a overly obsessed bitch?

Censoring camel toes is shit, though.<br><br>Joe easily won the episode by saying "fuck."</br></br></br>  <br>You want more filler to pad it out? Most chapters are filled with hyper detailed reaction faces and a lot of panels are dedicated to single interactions.</br>  <br>I don't want filler, I want a faithfull adaptation that follows the manga storyline without fucking it up because of time constraints.<br><br>Even if it meant the pacing was slow, that's better than rushing the anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you realise the contradiction you're putting out here?</br>  I want Meiko to dominate me with her feet.  <br> faithful adaption that follows the manga storyline <br>but the first episode followed the manga literally panel for panel (except the 3 panel school assembly scene)</br></br>  <br>What contradiction? The manga doesn't have filler, the pacing never feels slow. The anime is already skipping stuff, and it feels overall really fast. There's different ways to adapt manga, and to make it in a decent way, you have to make scenes have tension and emphasis on lines or shots. The anime so far has none of that, and the direction is almost unnoticeable. <br><br>This feels like they learned how to do manga adaptations from LIDENFILMS. 1 cour anime almost never work to adapt manga unless it's a SoL or romance.<br><br><br>They skipped pages and panels, look closely. They also skipped lines. I'm not saying it was much this episode, but believe me, it will get worse. The problems with this episode were how quick everything went by. This should have ended with the sentence of prison.<br><br>And it's nothing from just one episode, next will do at least five chapters based on the PV.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aiura was a masterpiece.</br>  Can Hana just pee on my face please<br>I don't really care for the dominatrix lady and her cowtits</br>  <br>You are whining over nothing. They didn't skip over that much and what they did is not significant. What you are suggesting would mean they would have to create new content.</br>  <br>Have you ever been kissed?</br>  <br> /a/- Anime &amp; Mango <br><br>Extremely unlikely</br></br></br>  <br>No it doesn't. Ever heard of pauses,scene transition and characters not talking like they will explode if they don't speak fast enough?</br>  <br>Have you watched any other anime adaptation? There's no need to create content to have proper pacing, 5 chapters per episode is rushed no matter how you look at it. If the manga has a lot of panels, it's because it's what style and atmosphere it's trying to give, if you rush through allthe panels you are going against the idea of the manga to just tell the story. This can easily be achieved by pausing inbetween lines, having more silent moments for dramatic effect, etc. The only scene that was close to this was the one where Andre was about to lick VP's shoe, but even that was too fast. They should have left Hana's face when she got mad for more time on screen, for example. Chiyo's interactions with Kiyoshi should have been slower and calmer, they are both awkward. The examples pile up.</br>  <br>When Anime Uncensored ver. ?</br>  here the spoilers for next chapter is anyone cares  <br>Nigger, it's been translated for over a day.</br>  <br><br>What may work in manga or books may not work for tv all the time. Though the convo between him and Chiyo did happen in a short period of time but the time felt slowed down compared to other events. Overall, the anime has kinda a slapstick feel to it. <br><br>When I watched the raw I did feel that it was fast, but after having the subs I don't agree anymore. I feel that people have been whining and bitching ever since the first PV came out and I just don't agree with them. <br><br>Also, yes I have seen other adaptions or I tend to read things afterwards. If anything I do appreciate that they are not dragging things out, in particular i.e. the first episode of Classroom Crisis and Gakkou Gurashi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sauce???</br>  <br>Yeah, depends on the circumstances tho</br>  <br>Literally setting them up for another lewd scenario on the same page as hand holding intensifies ill give an arm to kiss you since the piss stuff is done.</br>  <br>Read the thread or use the archive fuckface.</br>  <br>What the cock fuck is going on there <br><br>This manga never fails to deliver shit i never expected to happen</br></br></br>  <br>im to much of a lazy fatass to do that, show the sauce</br>  <br> Too lazy to use a scroll wheel <br><br>You should probably consider suicide options.</br></br></br>  <br>im to lazy to commit sucide</br>  <br>Gakkou Gurashi worked so well because of how the episode went by. If they had rushed to the reveal, it wouldn't have been shocking at all. Maybe the dellusions could have been more entertaining, but then it's not a pacing problem.<br><br>I think that the way the manga handles everything would have fit an anime, the anime feels completely different to the manga, and that's a bad thing. I didn't even watch the raws first, and it still felt rushed, it reminds me of recap episode pacing in some scenes. There's no time to even laugh and the scene changes.<br><br>I'll still probably enjoy it, but it's going to be disappointing at best.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>When kiyoshi grabbed hanas panties to hide them from chiyo and gakuto he must have put her panties in his pants and his boxers in hers under the sheets so they're wearing each others underwear now  which is hot as fuck </br>  <br> Gakkou Gurashi worked so well because of how the episode went by. <br><br>That shit with the dog was too drawn out. I liked the reveal at the end, but the thing with the dog was really annoying. I fast forwarded it, because I couldn't take it anymore. <br><br>Also, Classroom Crisis is a great lesson about a horrible first episode. It took a really long time before we even got to actual story. It was horrible.</br></br></br></br></br>  so let's say Hana didn't win the Kiyoshibowl<br>who would be your second choice</br>  <br>Giving examples of bad padded series isn't what you should be doing. You should give examples of good rushed anime, because if you want examples, I can give you plenty.</br>  <br>All the boys go to a gay bar ending.</br>  <br>PBR sama</br>  <br> With the chairman </br>   tfw you can't get into Hana because she's low test and doesn't have thick thighs and juicy tits like Mari or Meiko <br><br>Sometimes it's a burden being a high test alpha.</br></br>  I hate this art style. For whatever reason it pisses me off like nothing else. Look at these 3 pictures<br><br><br><br>They look like the artist tried to make a realistic Japanese looking girl. <br>Then look at these<br><br><br><br>These actually LOOK like a stylized cartoon<br>What the fuck?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Fuck yes that'd be hilarious</br></br></br>  <br>What is context?<br><br>The art has changed over the years, and depending on the tone of the scene, the characters don't need to have super realistic details.</br></br></br>  <br><br> tripfag <br> autism <br> whining <br><br>should be an auto ban</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So how bad is the anime? We all knew it would be bad, but is it even worse than expected?  so since vice prez is back what will she do to Andre?  <br>Only the hatchlings.And they weren't even killed but taken captive by Kate.We saw her hoding them in a cage.</br>  <br>I expected worse to be honest, but it is a rushjob. The OP, ED and VAs are great though.</br>  Why is JC staff in charge of this?  <br>Give him the punishment hes been craving</br>  <br> she's low test and doesn't have thick thighs and juicy tits <br><br>I don't think you know how hormones work.</br></br></br>  <br>Bigger question is, what will she do to Risa if Meiko remembers how she was treated by her.</br>  <br>She isn't back.</br>  <br> being retarded </br>  <br><br> taking what I said literally <br><br>you have autism</br></br></br></br>  Where is ch183? Google wants me to watch a fatmerican series called prison break  <br>make here strip down and tie her body with ropes<br><br>read last week chapter</br></br></br>  <br>She's not completely back. They'll revive her again when the time is right.<br> I'm more interested in seeing what will happen to Andre at that point. Will he return to his former state, or will the dueling queens cause him to evolve to his ultimate state? </br></br>  <br> using words incorrectly <br> get called out <br> "d-don't be a-a-utistic" </br></br></br>  <br>I was pretty let down when I found out Gakuto was referring to the actual Guan Yu and not Ikkitousen's.<br><br> inb4 &gt;sample, the original is 7MB </br></br></br>  Will animeonly fags despair at the realization that they wont ever have Gakuto as a brother in arms?  <br>see <br><br>Read this week's chapter.<br>She's not back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read this week's chapter retard</br>  <br><br>here comes the damage control because you were too dumb and took it literally</br></br>  <br> noticing a trip without an image drawing attention to it <br>The autism is you</br></br>  <br><br><br>so she not completely back well i was hyped for nothing</br></br></br>  <br>I think you should go back and read your first post, maybe then you'll understand how retarded it was. The only one doing damage control here is you.</br>  when does it air on at-x? I want to confirm lightbeams there as well, so I can safely set this on hold till bds come out.    <br> tfw that scene did nothing to me because Mari a massive pile of shit who made my waifu cry </br>  <br>They still got her back for a brief period, and they have a sense of how to do it again. It's just that they won't do "that" until they have no choice but to use "that".</br>  I hope everyone finds out about the panties getting swapped<br>I also hope that Hana and Kiyoshi keep growing closer</br>  <br>So she did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>The trigger is mari. The boys are going to harass the fuck out of mari.</br>  <br>dont talk shit about Mari she's the perfect waifu femanazi</br>  Holy shit this show is retarded.<br><br>I thought the copy pasta about girls beating the shit out of you while spitting in your mouth and calling you worthless was a joke.<br><br>Do betas actually like this trash?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> more damage control because he's too dumb to understand the nuances of the English language <br><br>Embarrassing. What a pleb.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'll answer honestly, despite your obvious bait.<br><br>Even if you find "guys being distressed in the hands of girls" as unsightly  ,which it is,  the manga offers more. The ecchi is good and the comedy quickly moves away from girls beating boyz, by the 2nd arc that is for the most part gone.</br></br></br>  <br>Then explain to me, how was the post supposed to be interpreted figuratively or metaphorically?</br>  <br>He went through hell and back for it, like true samurai.<br><br>This manga is subtle propaganda for japanese youth.</br></br></br>  <br> generic yurishit <br> most erotic <br>Picrelated was way more lewd</br></br></br>  <br>NO FUN ALLOWED NO FUN ALLOWED NO FUN ALLOWED NO FUN ALLOWED NO FUN ALLOWED NO FUN ALLOWED<br><br>Akira Hiramoto is a good artist, but given his past work, he has reason to switch up his art style from ONE HUNDRED PERCENT REALISM</br></br></br>  is it just me or does the author have a femdom fetish?  <br>He definitely does.</br>  <br>Ignore him, he's just some faggot crossboarder bringing some of his cancerous and 'hillarious' memes here.</br>  when does it air on at-x?    <br>Try to limit meme word usage.</br>  <br>chiyo wouldn' be bad, but an open ended "let's embrace our youth and search for ecchi experiences" finale would work as well, especially if the boys became the final student council and turned all pimp</br>  <br>Are you from ANN\/ Are you gonna complain about the art being "nasty hyper realistic'?</br>  <br><br>Better than what ANN has said about it so far.</br></br>  <br>That's because two of them f'in idiots.</br>  <br> They look like the artist tried to make a realistic Japanese looking girl. <br>I prefer this to the typical extraterrestrial anime eyes.Very crisp, clean, elegant, detailed. Isn't this what QUALITYfags dream of?<br><br>Anyone know anyone else who draws like this?</br></br></br></br>  <br> hana  <br> elegant </br></br>  <br><br>I thought they all missed the point completely.</br></br>  <br><br> ANN opinions mattering at all </br></br>  <br>Prison School's point is a bit hard to see though, you have to be able to look past mountains of tits to see it. And then, you're just looking at a butt.</br>  <br>Its hard to see for people with no sense of humor and that are offended by absolutely everything that isnt their ideal moral bullshit.</br>    <br> Reading comprehension </br>  <br>It's really sad when people can't see past their ideal and understand what a work is about, without focusing on what they wanted it to be and what it isn't.<br>I mean, for me, sure, boys getting beaten up by girls isn't my ideal and I'd rather they man up and put them in their place, but I don't have to focus on that. The manga offers plenty more in terms of humor and absurdity. Same for someone who doesn't enjoy ecchi that much. There's more, if you try to appreciate it for what it is and not what it isn't.</br></br>  <br>Hiramoto gave Meiko a flashback because the character needed it, since otherwise she'd be fairly onedimensional and even more boring than she already was, her moefication drives the point even further</br>  <br>That guy climbing mountains manga.</br>  How will Meiko make Andre submit?<br>Will Andreconomics rise again like a fucking sputinik?</br>  I thought this would be aots with all the threads it had before the show aired. It's just femdom faggotry, what a disappointment.  Acceptable PS pairings<br><br>Kiyoshi x Chiyo<br>Kiyoshi x  a ridiculously more dere  Hana<br>Shingo x Anzu<br>Joe x Cake<br>Joe x Ants  seriously, where are the ants <br>Gakuto x Wizardhood<br>Gakuto x  Meiko <br>Andre x Risa<br>Andre x Risa x Meiko<br>Mari x  Suffering <br>Kate x  slightly less suffering <br><br>Principal x Brazil's Women's Volleyball team</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Principal x Brazil's Women's Volleyball team <br>He wouldn't be able to handle it.</br></br>  <br>Clearly you lack faith in the chairmans ass pounding capabilities.</br>  <br> implying it wouldn't bring out the absolute best in him. </br>  <br>I think he'll be healed when he becomes both assman and titman and able to enjoy both.</br>  <br>Im the only one that wants to see mari and gakuto turning into a gag because she likes a good mans ass and he shit himself is the perfect combo for it.</br>  <br>Pretty much, but two of them were absolute shit. <br><br><br><br>When I started reading this I did, because I was drawn to the art. Then I stayed, because I thought the story was funny and intriguing. As time went on the story got even better. Also, another thing that grabbed me was the author's ability to do suspense really well. Three great scenes are the one where Kiyoshi is changing into the uniform, Meiko riding the figurine, and Kiyoshi and Hana underneath the futons. <br><br>His ability to do comedy so well lends a great hand to Me and the Devil Blues. <br><br>So like, whatever, fuck those narrow minded assholes. Their interpretations are more of a reflection on them as people rather than the art itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Assman <br> unable to handle ass </br></br>  <br>I don't agree. When Hana shows up something pretty major or crazy happens. Especially, with these last couple of chapters she had Kiyoshi almost rethinking his entire existence.</br>  <br><br>There are at least six players in a team, he would break. Unless he managed to gattai or something.</br></br>  <br>So a serious question:<br>Why exactly do you watch this show? <br>It's big titties and man getting beaten up. Big titties are 70% of the internet. So do you watch it for the man getting beaten up part?</br></br></br>  <br>Infidel!</br>  <br>he could kinda work with meiko too, given how much she focuses on him</br>  <br>I feel like people have answered this question multiple times throughout this thread. Are you just shitposting?</br>  <br>Obviously. Shitposters don't read the entire thread.</br>  <br>Here<br><br>Less than 20 minutes ago, I just answered exactly that, you turkish prison lover.</br></br></br>  <br>He would love to try.</br>  <br>His stamina multiplies per ass, it doesn't decrease. There is no limit to ass he can smash.</br>  <br>Shocking truth.</br>  <br>1. I really don't get the time to read every post in this thread 2. especially when its as retarded as the stuff you posted 20 mins ago. Putting people into place? More? You are literally pulling shit of your ass to excuse your femdom fetishes. But what did I expect. Nvm carry on.</br>  <br>ants were in the end credits</br>  <br>That was just part of a gag, he was always the target of someone elses wrong doing. Meiko is honestly hard to pair with anyone other than mari with the ridiculous amount of devotion and obedience she has to the bitch and the fact that she really never showed any interest romantically in anyone other than mari of course.</br>  <br>You're not reading what I read.<br>I said it doesn't have putting some characters in their place, which I'd wanted it to, but it still offers great stuff, if you look into it, despite not being 100% to mine or the reviewers expectetations. try reading the posts you reply to, if you're gonna shitpost about them.</br></br>  <br>Also, I like the Hiramoto tells the story. The suspense is top notch. Even for all the manga I have read, I feel that the way he does it seems to be a bit different. Like, I can actually feel the intensity of the scene due to the paneling. Like when Chiyo was taking those futons off Hana and Kiyoshi...that fear was real. I was nervous too. Kinda like I was underneath with them. <br><br>Those kinds of moments I feel that Hiramoto excels at.</br></br></br>  <br> I am too set in my opinions to care about anybody else's opinions even though I asked for them. I just really asked to trash them in order to validate mine. </br>  <br>Mari has shown romantic interest in meiko than chiyo has to kiyoshi though.<br>If anything, in the first arc, she didn't show any interest in meiko whatsoever, she treated her like shit.</br></br>  <br>*less romantic interest in meiko</br>  <br>you are dumb as fuck, at least shut up</br>  <br>which grrl would you impreg?</br>  <br>no one outside of kehki has shown the least bit she can work as a mother</br>  <br>You missed the two best ones<br>Kiyoshi x Gakuto<br>Gakuto x Joe</br></br></br>  <br>True, I wouldn't mind gay end either.</br>  <br>I hope the anime doesnt fuck up the brokeback prison chapter, that was some funny shit.</br>  <br>Let me give you a more thorough analysis<br><br>Hana: She'd demand she pees on the baby if the baby peed on her. She might develop a diaper fetish too. Also, highly unstable and violent, keep away from minors, etc.<br>Mari: Misandrist bitch, would turn her daughter into a similar one, I don't want to think what she'd do to her son.<br>Meiko: Good choice, but she'd demand mari becomes the godmother, see problems above.<br>Kate: Too obsessive, would either smother the child or make it as obsessive as her. Or both.<br>Fujo: Would dress her son in skirts, avoid at all costs.<br>Chiyo: Good natured, but the slut arc shows possible problems. Beware of family genes too.<br>Anzu: Too carefree and delinquent-like, doesn't seem like the type to settle.<br>Risa: More or less ok, she'd be very caring and hard-working, assuming she doesn't use her shinai on the child.<br>Kehki.: Only clearly safe choice so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She would be if she wasn't ruined by her shit tier fetish.</br>  <br> Hana: She'd demand she pees on the baby if the baby peed on her. She might develop a diaper fetish too. Also, highly unstable and violent, keep away from minors, etc. <br><br>That is too ridic. It's different if it's her child, but some strange ass man is a another story.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't want to think what she'd do to her son. <br>You dont want to know the horror of being raised by a feminazi man hater.</br></br>  <br> Fujo <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>Come on, don't tell me that the image of kiyoshi as her husband trying to stiffle his laugh while she stomps her feet, blushing and demands that she gets to pee on the baby too doesn't work for you.</br>  <br>third kate-council member who shipped joe with gakuto</br>  <br>Oh, I remember now.</br>  <br>More like who in the fuck is kehki</br>  <br>cake, you mongrel</br>  Spoiler alert for Pluto's ending:<br><br>How the hell did Brau-1589 drag itself all the way to Roosevelt's room? It would have had to escape from prison, get a flight to Thracia, find where Roosevelt was, and then somehow break into what I can only assume is the most secure bunker in the world guarding the most advanced supercomputer in the world... all with a giant lance sticking out of its chest. Pluto was a magnificent manga but these last couple pages threw me off.</br></br>   spoiler alert <br> no spoiler tags <br>How new are you?<br><br>Also anime adaptation when?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Very carefully</br>  <br>I hate giant black blocks of text and the spoiler tag has been abused so much for bullshit that it's pretty much meaningless at this point.</br>  <br>Anime adaptation never because there is zero cleavage, fanservice, or moe in Pluto. And I think the realistic noses would turn off the Japanese, which is the only market that matters for anime anyway.</br>  <br>Why was this manga so depressing?</br>  <br>There's been multiple Urasawa manga adaptations already, one more isn't that unelikely.</br>  <br>Naaaaah, why would you say that?</br>  <br>The last one was like a decade ago.</br>  <br>It's been finished for six years with no word on an anime series and I doubt there is much demand for an anime like Pluto at the moment.</br>  STRIKE THE YUKINA  <br>I want to strike Yukina's blood.</br>  From here on, this is my thread.
