[ New Vinland Saga.        <br> buzzsaws and industrial drills <br><br>Wat, are we still in 11th century Europe?</br></br></br>  TYBH    This time already. Fuck yeah Hox.  <br>posting images during a chapter dump is just rude.</br>  <br>Sure, why the fuck not.</br>  <br>Too bad.<br><br>It's only one chapter, not a volume, you raging newfaggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but they're still fucking annoying on auto-expand.</br>  <br>That's your problem.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the image limit. Who the fuck wants to see whitebeard as he's scrolling through?</br>  For people who're curious, waterpowered saws, while not too far-fetched considering their use in Roman times and in the high middle ages, they would still use a regular saw. Circular buzzsaws is something exclusive to the industrial era.  <br>Is Teedus more to your taste?</br>  <br>Between that and this page then I suppose it makes sense. Not the first time there've been technical liberties taken after all.</br>    <br>Who doesn't? Get the fuck out of here.</br>  <br>I don't really mind as long as it's just a singular genius inventing things lightyears ahead and not the society as a whole anachronistically using it.<br><br>Also, surprisingly enough, ball bearing axles were also a thing in Roman times.</br></br></br>  <br>What would've been their capacity to make something circular at all? Even if it was slightly off, the rotation would make cutting pretty fucking retarded I assume, or break other things.</br>  By the way Hox, are you sure the download link for Historie v9 is working?<br><br>I can't download it on either Firefox or Chrome.</br></br>  <br> ball bearing axles were also a thing in Roman times. <br>I had never heard that before. That's pretty neat.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I figured actual ones would be a swaying straight edge type. Making a circular saw blade that actually works requires hydraulically punching a sheet of metal, I think.</br></br>  <br>While that would've posed challenges too, I think the main problem with a circular saw in pre-modern times is that it requires an extremely fast rotation speed, as opposed to a conventional saw which can cut timber more based on the weight and power of the saw, which can easily be achieved with a large enough water wheel and pulleys.</br>  <br><br>I don't mind that as an excuse, but I really hate it when authors do this.<br><br>"It took hundreds of years of building upon existing technology to come up with this? Guess I'll just have one smart character singlehandedly 'invent' it and everything else I conveniently need for this story"</br></br></br></br>    <br> 'invent' it and everything else I conveniently need for this story" <br>I don't think that's what's going on here. Seems more like it's just to establish him as a smart guy.</br></br>  <br>Hild a qt<br>I want her as my bride</br></br>  <br> him </br>  Hild a CUTE.  <br>I was typing it as Hox posted that page. My bad.</br>  <br>And I want that guy to be my father-in-law, holy crap</br>  <br>I don't want to watch Hild's family die in front of her, which is of course going to happen in the next few pages</br>  <br>Umm, it was working before but right now it seems mega is having some troubles. Can you try it again? I just got it working.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#!NwkFzKRB!WO_9o<wbr>tX5DvbPkcB6rYul5XOkml1JWfj5MyIi2glK<wbr>xR0</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>What? Are you a genius inventing 2300's technologies?</br>  <br>He's definitely a great guy, especially by medieval standards. She's obviously going to become their cash-cow, however, so the benefits of keeping her inventing also outweigh the benefits of most potential marriages.</br>  <br><br>You called it</br></br>    <br><br>Yeah, but it really sells short the amount of ingenuity and effort it took to make those advances in the first place.<br><br>Sure to us in the future where these things are commonplace we might take them for granted, but we have to look these technological advances from the perspective of the setting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>...aaand here it comes.</br>  <br>oh man DILF as fuck</br>  Goddamnit, these people are really cool.<br><br>Fucking Vikings.</br></br>  <br><br>FUCK</br></br>  <br> is a good guy <br> likes money <br> is a viking <br>What else could I possibly ask for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, ignoring the reference to Da vinci's flying machine concept in her room, the ball bearing axle and waterpowered saw isn't farfetched, considering their use in roman times. It's more lost technology, if anything. The circular saw is the only thing that's much harder to swallow, given the technical difficulties required to get it to work.</br>  Thorfinn will save them.      <br>Other way around.</br>  Thank you Hox.<br><br>Last chapter was still the forest fight, right?</br></br>  We finally see some vikings again and I can't even be happy about it.  <br><br>It ain't gonna happen.<br><br>I love this. The whole first half of this series is about how awesome vikings are, and so far the second half is deadset on portraying them as the biggest bastards in history.<br><br>It's such a stark contrast and I love it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, he will give them SALVATION.</br>  <br>Yup. Looks like Yukimura's taking us on a flashback to show us what Thorfinn said to Hild back then, which she's trying in the present to get him to remember again.</br>  We always talk about Rachnee, Miia, Cerea, Lala or Suu, even about other girls. But why everyone hates Mero? she's cute, modest and has manners also she always makes sure that others have the best relationship with Darling.<br><br>She deserves some love /a/nons. <br><br> Playlist of special (actually 16) <br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>Manga:<br>-check the archive for ch 35 posted by TF last night.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm always one for some good surf 'n turf.<br><br>I can see the fish, and I've got the steak right here.</br></br></br>  <br>Or check monmusu.prettyanonymo.us</br>  <br> But why everyone hates Mero? <br>Only people trying too hard to fit in hate her.</br></br>  <br> Cthylla Sun Screen </br>   Lilith <br><br>Huh, I don't actually remember this girl. What chapter is she from and is she friends with Rachnee?</br></br>  Her personality is meh and her physical flaws are harder to deal with than most of the other girls'. Her upper half is human but the gills and webbed hand's still mess that up, plus you have to deal with all the slime. Also, personally, her not being able to move on her own is a real bummer.  To all the anons from the other thread, this is the correct chart.  <br>It's the little devil which tries to fuck shit up,  and Rachnee ends up ''punishing'' her up in the attic </br>  <br> Wants to be ntr'd  <br> wants to be cucked <br> murder fish  <br>Come on anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> she friends <br><br>Go and read it again nigger, is after the Suu incident.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty easy to hate her. Who else intentionally dragged darling under? Remember, the intent matters.</br>  <br>Seriously fuck off faggot.</br>  <br> Mero on top  <br>You had one job, ONE JOB.</br></br>  <br> Doppel <br> Pedo tier <br><br>Come on now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Great taste.<br>Now fill in the rest with other girls.</br></br>  <br> But why everyone hates Mero? <br>Her defining characteristic is that she's ladylike but also a tragedy fetishist. If it weren't for that flaw, she'd probably get a lot more love. I do love her character design, especially compared with mermaids in other works that either focus too much on practicality (i.e. bald and scaly) or are just humans wearing a tail fin (e.g. Ariel from The Little Mermaid doesn't have gills, webbed fingers, only a tail fin, and knees for some reason).</br></br>  <br> Cerea's 10/10 mom that low.  <br>Denied</br></br>  <br> the gills and webbed hand's still mess that up <br>You mean improve.</br></br>  <br><br>Did you guys even read the manga? <br><br>Seriously, after Mero helps Miia with Darling she noticed about her own feelings and left the cuck aspect of her personality aside. She actually loves Darling and deserve some love. <br><br>From the main group everyone get some special moments from Darling except her, glad to see Crabman making that happens in this arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   all these Doppel haters <br> hating on eldritch horrors </br>  <br>Isn't she starting to notice that it feels like shit to not get loved in return? <br><br>Also where is the "murder fish" part from? Are we talking about the part where she suddenly brings him down the lake in order to mate with him since "death was inevitable"?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if Mero fall in love with someone she can change her body or evolves in some way to "adapt" her current self to the ther person, like develops legs when she's away from the water and then she can back to the mermaid tail whenever she wants.</br>  <br>Anon that's not how it works. Also the entire appeal is that they're monster girls, what's the point of being able to turn full human?</br>  <br>That's what clinched it, but it's the first of two drowning attempts. Then again, to be fair, the second time we learn that her tragedy mode is beyond her conscious control.</br>  Mero is one of the most bautiful mermaids I ever seen, Crab have some good taste.  <br>I'm not saying go full human, but at least get some improvement to move by her own like Miia.</br>  <br>Hey man, to each their own but they are both turn offs for me. I'm into stomach/tits so the gills being right there kinda ruins it for me. The hands aren't really a big deal but they are a little weird and impractical.</br>  <br>Correct one.</br>  <br> Mermaid smell <br> Covered in slime <br> Dropped</br></br></br>  <br> Fishy scent <br><br>why would anyone want that?</br></br></br>  <br>Murderfish is a worn out thread meme.</br>  <br>Putting the ideal wife material that is Yukio and the antithesis to it that is Miia the on the same level invalidates your entire list.</br>  <br>She has like the least personality of any of the girls, and she uses a weird shapeshift body that isn't nearly up to the other girl's standards. She's basically only for the transforming horror fans.</br>  <br>Cerea to S+ and it'll be nearly perfect</br>  <br>Because she`s slippery?</br>  <br><br> Faggots who never smell a fish fresh from the water <br><br>Seriously? at least go out of your rooms fegets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you,  Homura </br>  Why is Rachnee the best girl and probably not gonna mate with Darling?  <br>Objectively the best</br>  You come home and see your monster daughter duck taped to the wall. Then Monster Mommy comes home. How do you explain your dumb as fuck daughter taping herself to the wall?  <br>This is going to end on a full harem, she's going to get the D anyways.</br>  Fact is people there are only 3 girls as of now likely to win the Darlingbowl. Unless Mero pulls something or Kurusu displays legitimate interest, she may very well get a tragedy  <br> monster daughter duck <br>I don't think I remember ever seeing any duck monster girls.</br></br>  <br>Ducktaped</br>  <br>Duct tape?</br>  <br> Fact is people there are only 3 girls as of now likely to win the Darlingbowl <br>More like 6 and then Lala in the afterlife.</br></br>  <br>It's duct tape moron</br>  <br> Goth-loli clothes: She likes them </br>  <br>How? That's only possible if they're retarded.</br>  <br><br>This thread needs more pictures of best girl.</br></br>  <br>It's not duct tape, it's Duck Tape.</br>  <br><br>Duck Tape is a brand of duct tape.</br></br>  <br>Everyone point, laugh, and move on.</br>  <br>I concur.</br>  <br>Finally, someone puts Tio in S where she belongs</br>  If it ends in harem, which i doubt since everyone is always jealous or going on about how they want main man for thenselves, or someone wins it's gonna be a shitstorm anyways.<br><br>What do you hope for in the end? Do you want him to end up with anyone in particular, or are you fine with a harem end?<br><br>I think i kinda prefer Cerea so far, with Rachnera coming second.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Tio deserves S+</br>  <br> What do you hope for in the end? </br>  <br> What do you hope for in the end? <br>Darling's 5 identical siblings come home in the final chapters so each girl can have their own Darling.</br></br>  Papi a best <br><br>There I said it. Now everyone can agree and move on to better discussion.</br></br>  <br> A fucking Spartan from HALO  <br> Can rekt the shit out of you just stroking your dick  <br> Die meanwhile you have sex with her <br><br>Nah, she's pretty much rank Z.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True that</br>  <br>Nigger the only viable end is the Harem.</br>  <br>She has perfect control of her strength.</br>  <br> implying she wouldn't be as gentle as a fucking butterfly with you <br><br> She makes sure there's five first aid kits by the bed </br></br></br>  SMITH BEST GIRL  <br>Cerea win would be ideal but Suu or Miia end would also be fine.</br>  <br>This. Eternally this. Even after they all die, Darling will convince Lala to bring them all together in the Afterlife for eternal love.</br>  <br>Harem end&gt;&gt;&gt;Miia end&gt;&gt;&gt;Smith is a Succubus end&gt;Rachnee end&gt;&gt;Suu end&gt; Anything else I don't really care after that. The only endings that would legitimately upset me would be a no one or ambiguous end.</br>  <br>You do realize we're talking about the guy who comes back from the brink of death daily just to make everyone happy, right?</br>  <br> Smith <br> Human </br></br>  <br>If be fine if either Miia or Rachnera ended up as his bride. I think they can still be a (hilarious) family even if Kimihito doesn't marry them all. And it could still theoretically keep going even after marriage.</br>  <br>Preach on Harembro.</br>   MFW This thread <br><br>Mero needs more lovin' and less sumer hatin'</br></br>  <br> ambiguous end <br><br>This shit pisses me off so much, it's like the author is too much of a pussy to go with a certain ending, so in order to not piss off the rest he just goes with the "safe" end.<br><br>I seriously hope he dosn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No girl shall be left unloved.<br><br> Nice digits. </br></br></br>  <br>Also, as Papi pointed out, everyone tries to murder darling one way or another. A few drownings is par for the course in this manga.</br>  <br>My love for the girls burns like the setting Sun.</br>  <br>As long as Darling doesn't sleep with any of them before he picks one, they'd be fine. I think Miia is probably the only one who wouldn't be able to accept not being chosen, and would probably leave the house. Papi could easily be little sister/daughteru, Suu does her slime stuff and copies Papi, Mero is sad but is fine with being sad, Cerea just acts like a regular knight/bodyguard, Rachnee keeps practicing bondage on the girls and acting like a big sister, Lala continues waiting for his death. This is the main reason I think Miia is the most likely singular girl ending.</br>  <br>Seriously. I don't read manga so that I can make up my own ending because the mangaka was too scared/lazy.</br>   no matter what happens Lala still wins in the end   <br> tfw she plays the long con for 60 years only to have him meet an angel right on his death bed that he spends the afterlife with. </br>  <br>Yeah the harem end is kind of an easy way to write this. I'm willing to give the crabman more credit and have faith that whoever he picks will be plausible</br>  <br>Those pelvic fins are sooooo cute! And handy, given the manga's genre...</br>  <br> Implying he wouldn't just stay friends with her in the afterlife because even after death he still loves the ones he choose <br> Implying she won't have moved on by then if she's not the one choosen <br><br>Pls</br></br></br></br>  Even if we all agreee that the harem ending would be best, in every harem there's a favorite, who would you like to fill that role?<br><br>For me it's definitely Miia, i've had a thing for lamias and other snake ladies since i was a kid...</br></br>  <br> Horse Pussy </br>  <br>The one that could win in a battle royale.</br>  <br>The elusive harem end is just as rare, if not moreso, as a single girl victory, and I'll never understand why. "Lets just leave this completely unresolved and blueball everybody! That's the safest bet!" said no one ever. Meanwhile the only opposition to true harem end seems to come from people who just want to shit on the rest of the 'losers' to feel like they have 'superior' tastes. Never mind that the harem lets everyone win. Some people just want to watch the world burn I suppose.</br>  <br>so Suu? or Lala?</br>  <br>More or less the way I invisioned it. On one hand I like the idea of Rachnee winning, dropping her act/emotional defense mechanism, and Miia going off to do her own thing. On the other I'm fine with Miia remaining his girl even with all the interruptions. Just one big strange family</br>  <br>Honestly, the second drowning was where she started warming up to me. The way she hugged Darling from behind, plus the look of panic on her face when she realized she came close to drowning him a second time...</br>  <br>No girl in this manga has perfect control of their strength  or their erogenous zones </br>  <br>We won't know until it happens.</br>  <br>I dunno. I know it's echii, but i'd still prefer him just choosing a victor, i don't really care about shitting or glooming over my pick winning or not. <br><br>Harem endings just kinda feels like a second safe bet, or a cop out, especially with how everyone makes it seem like it's not really an option. Especially with the whole harem the lamias wanted darling to be in, and him refusing, and some others scenes showing that he's inclined to choose one.<br><br>Not that i'd have anything against it if it did happen, i mean i guess it is possible to truly love more than one person, but it's just not my preference i guess.</br></br></br></br></br>   Mero thread <br> TF who's the biggets Merofag isn't here <br><br>What the fuck just happened.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep pointing it out and you're gonna lure then in faggot. Or at least people pretending to be then.</br>  <br>All of the girls can be so sweet when the time is right  except Smith :^) </br>  <br> Best outcome tier <br>Non ambiguous Harem end.<br><br> Great tier <br>Darling gets cloned and distributed fairly end<br><br> Fine too tier <br>Girl i like wins ending<br><br> Boring tier <br>Ambiguous harem ending<br>Open ending<br>Miia ending<br><br> Bad tier <br>Girl i don't like ending<br>No one wins<br>Curve ball ending (Smith wins or something as ludicrous)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miia is the first reason I started reading, but Suu grew on me really fast. Miia seems like the most likely candidate because she came first and is the poster-girl of the franchise.</br>  Benefits of choosing a victor:<br><br>Possible (interesting, not the usual annoying) drama in the future<br><br>The wedding/preparing chapter- shenanigans surely<br><br>The honeymoon- interrupted by other girls spying/trying to make it perfect but fail<br><br>Protest against Kimihito's marriage by anti- species people</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do know that in most species of spider, the female eats the male after her eggs fertilization, right? <br>Then again, that just makes me all the more excited to see the Arachnid civilization.

You're alright in my books.<br><br>I will say that the notion of the harem being a 'second cop out' never sat well with me, though from a logical standpoint, it is technically the 'safest' bet, since there wouldn't be any 'true loser'. I feel that it's possible to love people in equal measure, but for different reasons. Cerea's strong character and her steller rack. Rachnee's carefree lewdness yet bashful side. Miia's devotion (even if its overpowering and off-putting to me most of the time) and her sexy slither. Papi's delicious ass and enthusiasm. Suu's limitless potential and pure innocence. Mero's regal air and supportive and polite outlook on the rest of the girls(just gotta get her out of that suffering fetish). Lala's adorable chuuni-ness and mysterious side, also her stellar body doesn't hurt either. These are just a few things, of course, but there's numerous things to love about every girl.</br></br></br>  <br> Bird end being not surprising <br>Like hell.

You may like everyone, but i feel like it's not gonna be exactly equaly. Not that i can actually give a real insight if what i said it's true or not, but it's just how it seems to me.<br><br>I personally belive that as long as you're not affecting or hurting anyone else, it's not really a problem what you do, so i'm ok with harem, but like i said it dosn't sit well with me.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they're naked</br>  <br> Doppel reveals true form <br> Audience all go insane </br></br>  <br>as they wrestle do their clothing rip(if not) come completely off</br>  <br>Of course. <br><br> DOPPLE-MANIA IS RUNNING WILD! <br> she showboats like Hogan <br> the crowds are all on the ground and convulsing. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please, you can't go wrong with macho man.

Like, "oh you almost murdered me. For the tenth time. It's ok tough, let me go make dinner". I mean jesus, at least impose some limits or something, just because they're girls and potential marriage candidates dosn't mean it's fine that they can break your ribs 3 times in the same day.<br><br>Otherwise i like his character, especially the moment where the girl who wanted Rachnera to come back to the other family hosters. I was thinking "i guess it's fine, since the girls seems to be pretty willing to forgive, even tough she's being overly accepting of everything", when he mentioned how she was acting as if accepting Rachnera was like an obstacle then i noticed the girl was acting in the wrong.

Got anything else in the pipeline,  apart from Cert Dead that is. </br>  <br>Raid on PQube offices to gives some execs busted kneepcaps if we don't get ChuChu when?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128453217 <br>I'm not really directly involved with the animation stuff, but it involves a lot of precise timing and such, especially if you want to incorporate changing of expressions. It definitely takes a lot of time and effort to work on the video.<br>Same with the translation, though. They very rarely release actual scripts for Drama CDs so everything has to be transcribed by ear and then translated. It often takes 3-to-5x the length of the CD itself, so an hour-long one like Alpha, Beta or Gamma can take maybe 4 hours of patience and listening for possible errors.<br><br>Overall it's a long process for all involved parties, but the result is worth it.<br><br><br>Yeah I'm gonna see about the Octet manga soon. I'm desperately hoping that Pandora hasn't been dropped in favor of Zero, I reload the page every day hoping to see chapter 11. It's still not here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So if I stayed in the world where Ruka was a girl, just how screwed would the world be?  <br>I might consider flying to Britain for that, Hamburg airport is close to where I live after all.<br>I hope we don't have to do this, Kevin-kun</br></br>  <br>Ocet would be pretty cool, one of the few things with MCs interacting right? It'd suck if pandora get's axed, the epigraph related stuff sounded a lot like the best things to come out of S;G, and I really dig the manga's art style.</br>  <br>It's a deal then.<br>We'll do it in Rimi-masks.<br><br> I'm actually going to Germany in a month, got a any recommendations for Berlin? </br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm desperately hoping that Pandora hasn't been dropped in favor of Zero <br>Give up Steiner, Pandora's probably dead.<br> You might as well try to translate the LN if that happens. </br></br></br>  <br>   got a any recommendations for Berlin? <br> Yeah, avoid it like the plague. It's immigration/refugee central. <br><br> Rimi-masks <br><br>You mean Rikishi-Seals, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You mean Rikishi-Seals, right? <br><br>That works too.<br><br>   Yeah, avoid it like the plague. It's immigration/refugee central. <br>   Well, fuck me then. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a route for that!<br> it's pretty bad </br></br>  <br>I actually translated an extract of the LN and sent it to several publishing companies. I only got one reply and it was just "Sorry we wait for Japanese publishers to come to us with books, we don't take suggestions."<br>Hell, I was even considering contacting the Japanese publisher just to find out if I could get a quote about licensing costs and see about getting something crowdfunded or something, but that fell through when I discovered that 5pb./Mages. itself is the Japanese publisher, and there's no way in hell I'd be able to contact them even if I have gotten Chiyomaru to notice me a few times.</br></br>  <br> Come to Northern Germany, experience the beautiful landscape. Cities are the same everywhere you go. <br><br><br>Why won't Senpai notice you?<br>Does he dislike you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, thanks for being so dedicated to the series. It's pretty damn impressive, and makes me wonder where the western side of the series would fair without you. How did the Ciyo noticing experiences go?</br>  <br>He thinks Steiner is a lolicon.<br><br> Jokingly though, but it's just hard to get senpai to notice you. </br></br></br>  <br>Just chatted to him a few times in his livestreams. He called me a lolicon.</br>  <br>   Come to Northern Germany, experience the beautiful landscape. Cities are the same everywhere you go. <br> We're planning on seeing some battlefields around Berlin, otherwise I might take you up on that. <br><br><br>I missed that stream, why exactly did he call you that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why are you called a lolicon?<br><br>I need some details for that.</br></br></br></br>  Otakon is just a few days away, we'll have to wait and see...<br><br> And for a certain someone in this thread, I just haven't been on Skype lately. Taking a small break from the Internet right now is all. </br></br>  <br>Why are 5pb./Mages so much harder to approach than any other Japanese company?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128454009 <br><br><br>It was a while ago so my memory's not so fresh but the gist of it was that we were just chilling out and then he started talking about perverted stuff and I typed out "HENTAI" in the chat and then he went... "Ah, ah... Distant... Distant Valhalla... ah, Reading Steiner..." then he proceeded to call me a huge perverted lolicon for no real reason.</br></br></br>  <br>But at least he remembered you, that's something.</br>  <br>He knows Mayuri is you're waifu, Mayuri has the intellectual capacity of a child, therefore you're attracted to children.<br><br>Chiyomaru really just said what we are all thinking.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't suppose you know what/where are the fonts for sciadv related things?</br></br>  <br>But Mayuri isn't a loli.</br>  <br>I'm not quite familiar with whole LN translation shenanigans, but why don't you translate it and post at the site as usual?<br>Copyright issue?</br></br>  <br>Do you propose that you know more about SciADV than Chiyomaru?</br>  <br> talks about perverted stuff <br> someone call out on your act <br> proceed to call said person a lolicon <br>The fuck Chiyo?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I could do that, but right now I simply don't have the spare time to invest in something like that as a side project. The LNs are really long and a lot of effort to do, and really I'd love to do them in an official capacity. Nothing would make me happier than seeing the side material over here and available to the broad audience so they can see it doesn't just end with the anime or whatever secondary thing they stopped at.<br><br>My real dream is all of SciADV available in English, because a thing that really bums me out is people thinking SciADV starts and ends with Steins;Gate, there's such a great universe written with all these cool interconnecting details that so many people are missing out on either out of ignorance or simple lack of interest.<br>It might sound kinda dumb but I think that'd be really cool.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri is short, but faris is even shorter.</br>  <br>Doesn't sound dumb at all. Of course you'd want your fave series to be accesible to more people.</br>  <br>The same thing bums me out as well, I really love the series and wish I could do more for it other than just buy the VN's from Japan.</br>  <br> It might sound kinda dumb but I think that'd be really cool. <br>No dream is ever dumb. Keep doing what you love.<br><br>I will buy all the Sci;Adv releases day 1. And I know a lot of people who will too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish for the same things as you.<br>Hopefully it will be reality some day.</br></br>  <br>Think you'll do a TL for the Miu drama CD similar to what you're about to do for alpha?</br>  <br>Sure but with less production values.</br>  It's already the 23rd, is it end of the month yet?<br>Where is the anime date for C;C?<br>Where is Dual?<br>Where has our blue sky gone to?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ruka was nothing but dead weight. Even Farris had more influence on the story.</br></br>  I'll ask this here. Can someone give me a working link to the Chaos Head VN? All the torrents I find are dead as fuck.  <br> Wait for PQube announcement and get it for Vita </br>  <br>Spoil me Steiner, do we get some of this in LN?</br>  <br>Yes, a bit.</br>  <br>Faris actually becomes pretty relevant since she helps resolve kurisu's daddy issues. But ruka remains irrelevant throughout the entire series.</br>  <br>You are correct. It is impossible to choose between these two.</br>  <br>When might this possibly happen? I guess I can wait if there is nothing else to be done.</br>  <br>Something will be announced at the end of July, probably at Otakon. We all here hope it's Chaos;Head NoaH.</br>  <br>It'll most prolly be announced at the end of the month.<br><br>But if you really can't wait, you can get ther glitchy-as-fuck unfinished fanpatched version for PC here:<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=2<wbr>73050</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally, I'm hoping for Dual.</br>  I love you guys, you are the only reason I come to /a/ these days.  <br> Personally, I'm hoping for Dual. <br>I think we all are</br></br>  <br>Hope is the last thing that leaves man.</br>  <br>Y-You too.</br>     tongue <br><br>L-lewd.</br></br>  What can we expect from S;G Zero ?  <br>Shitposting.<br>And answers about the Beta attractor field.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully more explanations about how Reading Steiner works</br>  <br>Pill-popping Okabe.

Shouldn't be too long.</br></br>  <br>Do you still need redrawers for the Octet manga? I've been working on Chapter 2 today, practically halfway through the chapter. Moeka's part is going to be a pain in the ass.</br>  <br>Yeah! That looks good.<br>E-mail me or add me on skype or steam or whatever if you continue with it, that'd be a great help.</br></br>  <br><br>Console only, right?</br></br>  <br>Only time will tell. <br>Just keep up with the threads.</br></br>  <br>I'll send you an email when I finish the chapter. I'm only touching the pages that actually need serious redrawing by the way.</br>  <br>Fine by me, I can likely work around the ones that aren't a serious problem.</br>  Not sure why the songs in Steiner's rip were registered as being from several different albums, but damn has it lead me to some great music.  <br>They weren't tagged at all for me.</br>    Started the game today after getting the LE a few days ago. Damn I missed S;G so damn much and goddammit this game look gorgeous on the screen.<br>Also, Moeka's VN design is incredible. Her colors are really shiny.</br>  <br>Big tats I see. Her route in the spinoff was really sweet. <br>Just like the ending theme</br></br>  <br>Her Phenogram route was the best. I wish it could've been canon.</br>  <br>I meant the Darling route, but yeah even the phenogram one was pretty tragic.<br>What wordline was at end I don't know.</br></br>  Im potentially going to be ripped to fucking shreds here, but I have an honest question. Having just finished the anime (which is fucking amazing), is it a good idea to play the VN even after watching the show? Everyone says you should do it the other way round, but the VN sounds like it has so much more depth and I was wondering if it was a good idea to get into it even after watching the anime. Thoughts?  <br>I watched the anime beforehand, and read the Novel afterwards.<br><br>You can do it, it's not as bad as people claim.<br>The only thing you should keep in mind however is, that you ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT WATCH Chaos;Head.<br><br>You have to read that one, seriously.<br><br>You can read Steins;Gate without having read Chaos;Head, but it is not recommended.<br><br>I'd say, you should wait until C;H Noah is released, read that one and then read Steins;Gate.<br><br>Doing this you might forget a few things of Steins;Gate and enjoy the Novel to its fullest.<br>Rediscovering things from the anime, noticing the differences and getting into the characters is fun.<br><br><br>DO NOT WATCH CHAOS;HEAD.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeap. The VN has more information and other girl routes as well. Well worth your time.</br>  <br>That depends on if you want to get into the whole series. Most of us would highly recommend the visual novel afterwards. In fact, just do it.<br>It adds a lot more character development and gives you insight to Okabe's thoughts.<br>Stay the FUCK away from Chaos;Head anime, though.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anons, appreciate the advice. Sounds like the VN is definately a good idea, can you emulate it? I dont mind buying it but emulating it would be easier.</br></br></br>  <br>Just get the PC version. No emulation necessary.<br>Any more than that would be spoonfeeding.<br>It's worth the work.</br></br></br>  <br>Steins;Gate is out on PC as well. You can pirate but consider supporting the series for more translations.</br>  <br><br>fuck, im being a tard, had no idea there even was a PC version. So whats so god fucking awful about Chaos;Head then?</br></br>  <br>Nothing, it's great. There is no anime though.</br>  <br>The anime.<br>The original vn has a few bugs on the translated version for pc</br></br>  <br>The anime was a sin. Apparently the VN is great, but I'm waiting for the official translation. Any day now.</br>  <br>For one, it leaves a lot of shit unexplained. It cuts out so many essential points that you have no idea what's happening. You know the end before you know the story. A pretty shitty adaptation.<br>The visual novel is pretty alright, but has a lot of shitty points about it as well, such as translations. Not bad, but wait for NoaH.<br>tl;dr Wait for C;H NoaH, then play S;G. If you're impatient, just get C;H now.</br></br></br>  <br>You and me, anon. It will be day 1 for me.<br>I really hope for a good LE.</br></br>  <br>Man, if the LE is shit/non resistant then I'll be salty as fuck</br>  <br><br><br>What if it's Robotics;Notes instead? Steiner said there's a chance it could end up not being Noah.</br></br></br>  <br>If it's Robotics;Notes I'll cry tears of joy</br>  <br>Well, for what I got Steiner was working on NoaH and in contact with PQube so it's NoaH. Also, I remember one of the PQube guys posting C;H quotes on his Twitter.<br>We will see at Otakon (I hope). That's actually from tomorrow to Sunday.</br></br>  <br>Right but Steiner posted like two days ago suggesting it could be something else depending on the company.<br>It makes sense, they aren't fans they're a company so they'd probably want to go for a safer bet which is a newer game.</br></br>  <br>If you follow the idea of popularity, then the game announced will either be:<br> S;G Darling <br> S;G 0 worldwide release </br></br></br>  <br>I would be satisfied with the second one. Darling isn't really my scene. But at the same time it would shove it in Zakobot's face, so that'd be satisfying.</br>  <br>Mah nigga.<br> Wish future SciADV VNs will have upbeat song like it for ED. </br></br>  <br><br>The majority of SciAdv fans would say you are missing out on part of the experience if you exclude the VN. The added depth is great for people who want to get their fill of S;G. Even having watched the anime first, it was still an incredibly poignant experience for me. Of course, that will depend on how invested you are in the series to begin with.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br>It's a good adaptation but fucked up certain parts majorly (looking at you chapter 9) and it falls flat compared to the VN.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br><br>An acceptable adaptation, better than the other ones, which given the competition isn't necessarily saying much. Primary complaints are chapter 9 centered.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br>Masterful in some aspects and a great series on its own, but a different and in some ways inferior experience to the VN, nothing it states should be taken as canon for sciADV overall.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br> I like the second half of the anime more than it's VN counterpart, except for chapter 9 obviously. </br>  <br><br><br><br>haven´t read S;G yet, do you mean chapter 9 of anime or VN?</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br>It was really well executed. S;G definitely benefitted from a good anime adaptation.</br>  <br>Chapter 9 of the VN, eps 20 and 21 of the anime.</br>  <br> anime <br> chapter <br>Anon please</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br>I like it even better than the VN</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497967 <br>Yeah, the anime butchered his backstory and character motivations. In the VN he's much more tragic and thus likeable even after the reveal.</br>  <br>To be fair, the PS Vita release of Chaos;Head came out less than a year ago, so it's hardly irrelevant. Also, I think Steiner is trying his hardest to keep doubt in the air. He wouldn't want to steal PQube's thunder, after all.</br>  <br>M-maybe they will reveal it on Kurisu's birthday?<br>I mean, it IS the end of July now, isn't it?</br></br>  <br> they reveal it on the day Kurisu die instead </br>  <br> fucking Kevin delays the announcement to the end of next month </br>  <br>Anon, that's another month away... I can't bare to wait that long...</br>  <br>What. July 28th is in four days.</br>  <br><br>You should reread the VN.<br><br><br>I'd be fine with this, just announce the goddamn thing already.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>...Oh shit, I had my timeline mixed up. I thought she died at the end of August... but she dies in July, then the rest of the game takes place in August. I get it now. Nevermind.</br>  I started S;G today. Which route should I play first?  <br>Whichever one you land on,  Vitagen  anon</br>  <br>They're in order, cutting the story short at different points, so it's easy to do them in sequence.</br>  <br>Suzuha -&gt; Faris -&gt; Luka -&gt; Mayuri -&gt; Kurisu -&gt; True</br>  <br>Fun things.</br>  As an anon who watched Steins;Gate, played the VN a year later and just finished it all up with the OVA where should I go from here? Movie? Are there any other VNs I should play? Really enjoyed the Steins;Gate VN, it was my first VN and I have only been thinking about it since I finished it a few days ago.  <br>VNs in general or Sciadv? If it's the former, Muv Luv is the best you're going to get. Go into it blind, don't look anything up, just download and play.</br>  <br>Whose eyes are those eyes?</br>  <br>Sciadv, but thank you for the other recommendation. I'll download that too.</br>  <br>Black and white is better than nothing, but I really would like to have a colored one.</br>  <br>Start Chaos;Head I guess? Or you can wait a few days to see if the announcement really is for a C;H Noah or Dual.</br>  <br>WMP has a setting where it will automatically try to detect the album untagged stuff comes from. That's why I have the Catherine soundtrack labeled as Legendary Weapons by Wu Tang Clan</br>  <br>Oh, that makes sense. Like I'm said, I'm glad it happened. I'd never heard of those artists before, but I'm gonna start listening to them from now on.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Vpd<wbr>JkXfekOo</wbr>  [ ]  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nFX<wbr>4Li4Zp-E</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br>Tooryanse &gt; Kagome Kagome</br></br>  Did Arc Light of the Point of Infinity ever get scanned?  <br>It didn't.</br>  Why is there no Moeka route?<br><br>I want to lock myself in and isolate myself with my autistic waifu from the rest of society.<br><br>There was even a route for the shitty maid cafe girl, why didn't best girl get one?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this, and where can I get it if I should care about it?<br><br>Because the only way to liberate Moeka from Sern is to get to the Steins;Gate, the True End.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why not make another route similar to true ending, except you end up with Moeka?</br>  <br>Because the only way to get to true is of Okabe's obsession with Kurisu.<br><br>This should be obvious, as it was even said in the Anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Then just say that he only wanted to save her, he wasn't actually in love with her. Same way he desperately wanted to save Mayuri even though he didn't love her. It is easy enough to give her a route if you really want to.</br>  <br>But Okabe does love Mayuri, as a sister.<br>He spent years with Mayuri, he fell in love with Kurisu's intellect, her wit and her weaknesses.<br><br>He hated Moeka for killing Mayuri, he can't just do a U-turn.<br>It would be too forced.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nya, soldier and fag route were forced too so this shouldn't really be an issue.</br>  <br>Suzuha was ok, but yeah, Luka was very forced.</br>  <br> What is this, and where can I get it if I should care about it? <br>Manga spin-off where Kyouma is dead, there's only Okabe Rintarou.</br></br>  <br> he fell in love with Kurisu's intellect, her wit and her weaknesses. <br><br>He actually fell in love with her dank meme skills.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure you're thinking of Pandora or Epigraph</br>  <br><br>No he's right.

I don't think the focus is different.<br><br>Replace "adaption of the" with "sequel to the" in Deja vu's description.<br><br>I think you should point out which platforms the English version of the Steins;Gate VN has come out on (PC, PS3, Vita).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Occultic;Nine spooky song:<br>暗い日曜日 - Gloomy Sunday<br>https://<span>youtu.be/55FP1LfkkVQ  [ ]</br></br> </br>  <br>If there isn't any description for an entry, you should leave it empty instead of "description required".<br> And leave out Zero from anime section, wait until we get first visual for the anime.

I've never read Duplet so I honestly have no idea.</br></br>  <br>Thats the manga adaptation of the thing where Okabe gets stuck into Daru's eroge program. I can't even remember if it was in vn or was it drama cd only.</br>  For the love of my frail heart, I beg you Kevin, publish the game that has this scene in it.  I've only gone a short ways into the Gamma CD animation. Until now I never knew those animations even existed, and I don't think my heart can take this route. I don't like where it's going.  <br>Kurisu, Faris and Suzuha get their own manga adaptation of their routes, so it can be assumed Duplet is for Mayuri.<br> Luka and Moeka didn't get any <br>My sides.<br><br><br>Oh, it's the one with Yandere Kurisu? That's from drama CD.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Friendly Reminder that this exists: http://futuregadget-lab.us/  <br>Yes but manga has original ending.<br>No power drills unfortunately.</br></br>  <br>How does it end?</br>  <br>I ideally need descriptions of 18 words or smaller. I'll take your word for what the story is in Duplet but it's unfortunate that the descriptions for the darling route adaptions seem to just be copy pastes of each other seeing as they're simple character routes.<br><br>As a small note for anyone interested, how would you prefer I name Faris in various descriptions? As 'Faris NyanNyan' or her real name 'Rumiho Akiha'?</br></br></br>  <br>Okabe ends up dating Mayuri but she notices that his heart is not in it and he leaves to find Kurisu. <br>Just when he's confessing to Kurisu, Daru butts in and he manages to end the program.</br></br>  <br> As a small note for anyone interested, how would you prefer I name Faris in various descriptions?

Wouldn't Pandora be a good lead in to the Zero VN just with some changed elements?</br></br>  <br><br>Don't look at me. It was whoever added the 'single quotes'.</br></br>  <br>God what the fuck</br>  O;N isn't part of the sciadv world is it? Still hope it get's translated, it sounded interesting.  <br>Maybe it gets anime and manga after vn is released.</br>  <br>No, it's not part of C;H, S;G, R;N and C;C.</br>  <br>Who knows, maybe it'll be included into SciADV world  for no reason at all  sooner or later, alongside with A;C.</br>  <br>Maybe the game will supersed the novels.<br>I think is a neat concept</br></br>  The best.  <br>Wrong file you got there, buddy.</br>  <br>Looks good, but why not include the English titles for all the stuff too? It's weird that you're mixing romaji and English titles in there.<br><br>Stardust Duplet is a straight adaptation of Mayuri's Darling route.<br>Motto Hiyoku Renri is an adaptation of one of the Comptiq Drama CDs where Okabe gets trapped in an eroge simulation made by Daru.</br></br></br></br>  Wonfes this weekend, they will announce Serika figure for sure.  <br>Nope.

You wouldn't separate it as Steins;Gate Two/Ni in that case, right? The Japanese use the "English" title everywhere.</br>  Someone in a previous thread said that Alpha Nakabachi and Beta Nakabachi are two very different people, since Suzuha wasn't there to influence him in alpha. Can someone explain me the difference? Because in both times he sounds like a bad father.  <br>Alpha Nakabachi was mostly a sad, distressed man who wanted to reconcile with his daughter but was too proud/didn't know how to word his feelings. Just like Kurisu he's not good at directly saying how he feels. He had a good friendship with Suzu and Yukitaka and it calmed his heart considerably.<br><br>Beta Nakabachi on the other hand had nothing and nobody to help him through the tough times when he was without his family and being laughed at by the scientific community. He slowly became warped and furious at the world, he called Kurisu to his conference specifically to gloat at her and big-up his experiences, he even got to the point of killing his own daughter in a blind rage. (Though it should be noted that he didn't know about Attractor Fields and thought he could undo her death once he made the Time Machine).</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I think I get it now. So his friendship with Suzu and Faris' dad is the one thing that helps him the most and he probably wouldn't kill his daughter in alpha.

I've never seen images enlarged so adeptly.</br>  <br>Agreed, I installed it to my home server so I can process images that I like.<br><br>This image is an example of something it has a hard time with. Most of the fine dot detail was lost.</br></br></br>  <br>I had a feeling something more complex would give the program you're using trouble.</br>  <br>That () was with the jpg filter set to low, this image (http://i.imgur.com/mIfAnln.jpg) is with the filter set to off.

Have you ever dropped a show in it's second or third season?  <br>Arslan Senki at Episode 15<br>I just can't bear it anymore it's absolute trash and I don't understand why people like it, because it's so predictable and all the episodes are 99% episodic shit with 1% new infos given to us as if it was a huge tweest and shit. Truly disgusting fujoshi shit.</br></br>  <br>a few series i have dropped</br>  dropped prisma iyla after finishing the first season<br><br>seasons two and three look like the same shit</br></br>  <br>Fairy Tail, after Edolas arc I think.</br>  <br>I dropped Fate/Zero after that cringey speech Ryuunosuke gave about how blood is pretty.<br><br>So much edge. Apparently Kiritsugu is even edgier. Fuck that, this anime is for manchildren and /v/.</br></br></br>  Fairy tail. Dropped it a few episodes into the newer one. I kind of feel like picking it back up though.  Probably Katanagatari, I was 10 episodes in. <br><br>Recently I've been doing it a lot more. I got halfway into shows like Amagi and Assassination Classroom and dropped them. Not that they're terrible shows like Katanagatari was, they just weren't that interesting.</br></br>  <br>naruto by the begining of shippuden</br>  Manga, but I dropped Gantz in the middle of the final arc.  <br> dropping a 12-episode series after watching 10 episodes. </br>  <br>That shoujo manga of that fat fujo girl that becomes pretty after starving for a week cause her favorite character got killed.<br>I dropped when the dyke appeared.</br></br>  I watched 200 something episodes of bleach.  Episode 15 of SAO  i think it just goes to show how empty anime if we can make it 100+ episodes into a show and then just drop it like it was nothing  I dropped Angel Beats halfway through the penultimate episode  I dropped the Naruto shortly after the pain arc  <br><br>Still got three episodes of VVV S2 to watch. Probably never going to.</br></br>  Bahamut episode 9<br>Yugioh 5D's episode 52<br>Naruto 400 chapters<br>Teekyuu 4 episode 8<br>Suzuka 50 chapters<br>Aldnoah S2 episode 2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I did this but with Nakaimo.</br>  <br> Have you ever dropped a show in it's second or third season? <br>Yep. Log Horizon 2, episode 21/25. Got bored of the scrub kids doing nothing important.</br></br>  Naruto shippuden after 200 episodes.<br>It took me too long to realize how dumb it was.</br>  <br>dropped gungrave on like 22/26 because it fucking sucked and I hated it at that point i couldn't do it</br>  Zetsuen no Tempest<br>i stopped at about episode 22. it was such pretentious bullshit the whole way through i was legit laughing at half of it</br>  <br>I dropped Gintama around the 200~, I love Gintama but after episodes past 170 I noticed a shitty buzzing in the background that grew insufferable and detracting and it wasn't a problem with my PC or sound either. Shitty reason but whatever.<br><br>I dropped Bleach early Hueco Mundo Arc, when rukia meets the espada that pretends to be her brother or something. Literally irredeemable shit<br><br> I dropped Hyouge Mono at episode 26, after the hype sengoku jidai stuff it turned into 'muh aesthetics,muh simplicity,muh tea bowls'.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gungrave is one of those shows that is rarely mentioned by /a/ (Except to avoid the first episode.)so I thought it was supposed to be good?</br>  <br>Same for me. After Pein died and the next round of filler was rolling I dropped it. Think I stopped around 216 or so. Don't regret it.</br>  I dropped Space Dandy a couple episodes into season two<br>Also, I only watched about six or seven episodes of Lucky Star, but for some reason it took me forever to watch those, like a month between every one</br>  <br>To be fair anime with 100+ episodes rarely tend to be good and tend to be dragged out shitfests intended to make money with rare exceptions like One Piece (The manga),Major and Gintama.</br>  I dropped God Geass on the second to last episode.<br><br>I have no regrets.</br></br>  Karneval, 9/13. It turned so fucking boring I just couldn't give a fuck what happened.<br><br><br>What in the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> I dropped Gintama around the 200~, I love Gintama but after episodes past 170 I noticed a shitty buzzing in the background that grew insufferable and detracting and it wasn't a problem with my PC or sound either. Shitty reason but whatever. <br>Shinpachi?</br></br>  <br>Dropped Aldnoah on the first episode of the second season. <br>Although honestly I marathonned the first season, so who knows if that even counts.</br></br>  'Dropped' Jojo Stardust crusaders before Jotaro vs. Dio, it's not out of dislike it's just that I forgot to watch the last few episodes and considering I know the conclusion (Timestop, ROAD ROLLER) I don't feel like watching it.  I dropped glasslip at episode 12 but then forced myself to watch episode 13<br><br>I dropped shigatsu at episode 17, I'm not going back on that shit.</br></br>  <br>good man.</br>  <br>There are plenty of live action shows and cartoons that get dragged out beyond 100+ episodes and get stale, you may as well say that about visual media in general besides.</br>  <br>Ayy, I could listen to Shinpachi speak for 1000 years if it meant making that weird audio error go away, it ruined gintama for me and was especially pronounced during the Kakubichi 4 Deva's arc , probably a dodgy file.</br>  I dropped Sasami-san at like the second to last episode but I went back and rewatched it a few years later. I wondered why I ever dropped it but then I remembered when I got to the last few episodes. I pulled through it though. Really turns into shit.  <br><br>I dropped Eureka AO on the second to last episode, with no plans to ever finish it</br></br>  <br>Oh now I remember ones I actually dropped and never plan on picking up again. I dropped SAO and Log Horizon at like episode 10 for both. I should have learned from SAO but I bought into the retarded LH hype. Danmachi did it a million times better. Not just because it makes no mention of video games but it just has better characters and flow.</br>  <br>Dog Days.<br>They brought in the shota trap fetishizing, and he got more than any loli combined.</br></br>  <br>nurarihyon no mago s2 about episode 18 where shit starts to hit the fan<br>i just kinda stopped watching for no reason<br>and never picked it up again</br></br></br>  I watched 11 out of 12 episode of Kiss x Sis.<br><br>Then I figured the last episode would be all drama instead of fap material so I never finished it.</br></br>  Kill la Kill at ep 18<br>Aldnoah.Zero at season 2 ep 7<br>Naruto Shippuuden at episode 350+, don't even know why I watched that many episodes.<br>Penguindrum at ep 15</br></br></br>  Gochiusa at episode 5.<br>Then I picked it up again and now it's favorite show. Warmly waiting for season 2.</br>  Dropped Oregairu s2 around episode 10.  Bakuman after season 1<br>Kuroko after season 1</br>  I've dropped nichijou and lucky star 6 times now.<br>I never get past episode 7 for some reason, then enough time passes and I feel like watching them again so I start again from the beginning.</br>  Really tempted to drop Ore Monogatari right now if that counts.  <br>Time to just resign yourself to your shit taste.</br>  <br>I did this with Soul Taker. Too pretentious bullshit.</br>  <br>That's some tenacity anon, I couldn't handle the GENUINEly shitty drama that was shoehorned for no reason, made me drop at like episode 5.</br>  <br>You made it through the first couple hundred episodes. Why was Shippuden that much harder to watch?</br>  I dropped Kill la Kill in it's 13 or 12 episode when they decided to rehash Ryuko is having doubts about Senketsu. I don't think I really missed out on much, since except for certain times the animation wasn't that great.  <br>8/26 here. Too boring.</br>  <br>I dropped Samurai Champloo and Steins Gate on the second to last episode</br>  <br>I dropped Ergo Proxy shortly after the stranded episode. So maybe episode 18 out of 23.<br><br>It was enjoyable at times, but I've never felt any need to finish watching it.</br></br></br>  <br>Good thinking, s2 gave me cancer.</br>  <br> Yugioh 5D's episode 52 <br>Anon, you were six episodes away from Jack vs Carly. I know you just finished a two-part Crow episode, but why would you stop there?</br></br>  <br>I dropped Kill la Kill at episode 22 and will never watch the finale. It wasn't any particular thing that episode did, I just finalized my slowly growing realization that between the dropped plot points, cardboard cutout characters, meandering story arcs, retarded character motivations, idiotic in-universe explanations, and bullshit asspulls that the writers had no idea what they were doing and didn't care, and hence neither did I.</br>  <br>The finale was really  fun , you missed out.</br>  <br>I'm surprised nobody answered with Guilty Crown.</br>  <br>I thought it was kind of predictable. I will finish it someday though (the first half at least), the characters are fun</br>  <br>I dropped it at 16, it was so boring. I don't even care about plot or characters, I just wanted to watch a fun series, hell I loved watching SAO and SAO II because it was so fun to watch but KLK was a snoozefest to me.</br>  I watched the first two seasons of Uta Pri and Symphogear despitw being absolute shit because i used to be a MAL completionist, nevwr picked up the 3rd seasona because I stoppes being a faggot and stoppwd watching shit shows.  I dropped ZnT in the start of the third season. I'd had enough of Louise's bullshit.  <br>if you're mal completionist, why even bother watching anime when you can have a bot automatically +1 episode every new show that comes out?</br>  Here's my "dropped" list.<br>Nothing too fancy.</br>  akame ga kill, 2nd to last. should have dropped it WAYYYYYY earlier  <br>http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Sy<wbr>noptic&amp;status=4&amp;order=0</wbr></br>  <br>Dropped literally at the same place<br>Arlsan was filled with Gary Stu</br></br>  <br>Dropped DanMachi at 3rd episode. Just all around bland and I'm not really into twin-tailed cowtits loli or blonde warrior autist</br>  I get sad when I drop things because then I can't add it to my list of completed anime and stroke my e-penis.  Dropped Hidamari Sketch on episode 3 of season 2. It's not even that bad, but whenever I watch it I get really sleepy.  <br>You could always lie anon. You gotta stroke that e-peen with less effort</br>   Have you ever dropped a show in it's second or third season? <br><br>Darker than Black.</br></br>  I dropped girls und panzer after 2 episodes. I just couldnt handle the moeshit.  <br>You should probably stop after the Dark Signer arc. Everything kind of flips into a different direction entirely after the/mid arc. There's also about 10-20 episodes of filler after it.</br>  <br><br>I dropped Bakuman about halfway through the third season. It wasn't intentional, but things came up and by the time I had enough free time to watch anime again I'd forgotten most of what happened. I have since read the Manga in full however.</br></br>  are you counting shows that just turned to crap? i'm a giant initial d follower but i quit watching the episode the wings appeared. that was a major shark jump for me  After 200 episodes from Bleach, One piece and Fairy tale i realized they were all shit. No idea why it took so long. They're addicting, that's for sure.  <br>Shitty space pirates.<br>At ep17. /a/ said it can grow on me over time.<br>Well, it didn't, you fucks.</br></br></br>  <br>I dropped Haruhi S2  after endless eight .</br>  Bleach at about the 75th episode.  <br>I wish I'd dropped them earlier. I've already dropped FT and I've just about had enough of Toei's shit, so I'll probably be dropping OP soon.</br>  <br>B-But then that takes away the pleasure of stroking the e-penis, it's like showing off breast implants: everyone knows they're fake. I don't post my powerlevel anyway because it's dwarfed by the dudes who've supposedly watched 100s and 1000s of anime.  ;_; </br>  <br> not skipping the Bount filler arc. </br>  <br>As bad as it got, there were still a few great moments.<br> Jack going job hunting <br> Jack vs Jack <br> Clear Mind <br> Shooting Quasar Dragon's summon <br> Jack vs Yusei finale </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You gonna read the OP manga? (Assuming you aren't already.) I dropped the OP anime years ago but I've recently found about the coloured manga which looks really tempting and fun.</br>  <br>I forced me to watch 18 episodes of Guilty Crown. It was so fucking shitty, I don't know how /a/ can even ironically like it.</br>  <br>What didn't you like about Katanagatari?</br>  I've never dropped a series.<br><br>Ever. <br><br>Even if I hated it or thought it was complete shit. I resolve myself to sit through whatever I feel I start watching.<br><br>I sat through Glasslip, Strike the Blood, Blood C and Guilty Crown, to name some of recent memory that left particularly bad tastes in my mouth.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry I'm with you on that one. Guilty Crown is weird because some people like the second half of it and others can't stand it. I'm in the later.<br><br>If they ended it on episode 12 things would've been dandy, but they did everything they could to ruin it after that point.</br></br></br>  <br> blood c <br>I salute your sacrifice. How did it end?</br></br>  <br>I liked the Crow and the Junk grandpa filler. But honestly most of the episodes before CLEAR MINDO and the final duels were hard to deal with.<br><br>Jack vs Yusei finale is probably one of my favorite duels of all time though.<br><br> Synchros &gt; All </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not going to lie. I don't even remember, and it's probably for the best. I remember some absurd out of nowhere twist shit and that's about it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'll just stick to the manga.</br>  I dropped Kekkai Sensen at the last episode.<br>I still don't know what happens in the end.</br>  I will drop Nisekoi at chapter 179 pretty soon here.  <br>Dropped Oreimo after Ayase lost. The series was dead for me after that, and the big FUCK YOU the other girls apparently got only kicked the corpse further</br>  I dropped Aldnoah right before the very last episode of the second season or cour or whatever. <br><br>It was just so universally shat on by /a/ that I lost faith completely in the series.</br></br>  <br>Zero no tsukaima at the first episode of s3.<br>I couldn't stand it anymore</br></br>  <br>Shit man, I only made it past the first season. You've have serious patience.</br>  Jewelpet Twinkle<br>45 episodes<br><br>Heartcatch Precure<br>About 40 episodes<br>Love Live!<br>11 episodes into the second season<br><br>So long as I never watch any more, they'll never end!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I almost never officially drop anime, but for <br> Kimba the White Lion <br> I've been at <br> episode 22/52 <br> for like <br> 7 years  <br>or something. Doesn't help that the last time I was going to continue it I couldn't find it either.<br>One day, maybe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your picture is giving me the urge to bring her a parasol so she can go home.</br>  Monster at 60ish.<br>Extremely overrated.</br>  Never dropped a show, but I had to take a week break when the narrator in LoGH said the next episode was "The Magician Doesn't Come Back"<br><br>I wasn't ready even with preparing for a week.</br></br>  <br>I think I saw Pokémon up until early Sinnoh, so however many fucking episodes that was.</br>  I dropped Nisekoi 10 episodes in. In retrospect I'm surprised I made it that far, I think the tomboy may have gotten me through an episode or two, but the show was still irredeemable shit.  <br>If not watching a new season counts as dropping then I did this with Zero no Tsukaima and Shakugan no shana. season 4 and 3 respectively.</br>  <br>22/23 episodes for Clannad<br><br>Holy shit I can't stand that garbage and only got that far because my friend was urging me to keep going</br></br></br>  Ergo Proxy, 6 episodes in  <br>Unless you count long-running shonen shit that I just grew out of, probably Gargantia after episode ten. I just couldn't do it anymore.</br>  <br>this 100 times</br>  I dropped Nisekoi 18 episodes in<br>Also i watched like 180 episodes of Bleach</br>  Aria The Natural, 15 episodes. i didn't care about the characters, the setting is nice and all but meh  <br>Zero no Tsukaima about halfway through the first episode of the third season.<br>Lain on 10 or 11. <br><br><br><br>Kill had some a fantastic energy for the three episodes I got through, but it definitely seemed to lack focus or point. 10/10 would drop like a hydroencephalatic baby again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wow did he just kill the entire village? <br> he resurrects everyone at the end <br><br>This was the moment my shonen heart broke</br></br></br></br>  I passively dropped Lagrange back when Daiz disappeared for a while during the second season; didn't want to switch subs and after enough time passed without finishing it I realized I just didn't give a shit what happened anymore. Even when I was still watching it never managed to get me excited for the next episode, but was never so bad that I had to drop it on the spot.  <br>I dropped Familiar of Zero halfway through the third season<br><br>Also, I watched 2.5 seasons of that shit</br></br></br>  Deathnote, soon after the blonde girl and her shinigami were introduced.<br><br>I now take people's recommendations with a grain of salt.</br></br>  I dropped K-ON!! (the second season) halfway in, because watching it was becoming a chore and I was getting extremely annoyed by Azushit.<br>Also, probably a few anime while they were airing that I lost interest in.</br>  <br>So... 5 episodes in, maybe?<br>You're a retard.</br></br>  <br>IDK, felt like 16 TBH.<br><br>Also GFY, the series sucked IMO</br></br></br>  I never drop shows so I can mark them as completed on myanimelist :D  I got 5 episodes into Hyouka before dropping it. the characters were insufferable and the "mysteries" were boring as shit. I can't imagine how anyone could have finished that series.<br>I may have even fallen asleep while watching it.</br>  <br>The series is great, most people aren't willing to admit it because it was probably something "edgy" they enjoyed in their teens and now they hate it by default.<br><br>The manga gets pretty dull after volume 10 to the finale, but thankfully the show cut out the drudgery.</br></br></br>  <br>Saw the 1st season of Magi<br><br>Not gonna see anymore of it</br></br></br>  Alright, prepare for some upset feelings.<br><br>Death note, after L died, and I realised the show was serious about two ten year olds taking down Light.<br><br>Ttgl, about two episodes after kamina died, and the show slowed to a crawl.<br><br>Yuyushiki, like four times, when I realised there would be no character progression of any kind. Thank God there was no second season.<br><br>Initial D after the first season. Just gets kind of dull, and fucks with the characters too much.<br><br>Neptunia, episode 1, made it about eight minutes in and couldn't fucking stand any of the characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 18/25 <br>What made you stop?<br>Nice trips tho</br></br></br>  <br>I hated it mainly because to me it seemed like the "rules" and quirks were regularly being added as the "game" progressed. Not even clever.</br>  <br>one piece, after episode 100+ (don't remember, it was too long ago)</br>  <br> Yuyushiki, like four times, when I realised there would be no character progression of any kind. Thank God there was no second season. <br>I have no words for you</br></br>  <br><br>I dropped OniAi on ep 7<br><br>I would have dropped it sooner, but i kept going because i wanted more Anastasia</br></br></br></br>  I watched 14/24 episodes of Lucky Star and dropped it twice.  <br>i dropped the manga after around 550 chapters<br><br>shit just dragged on too much</br></br></br>  <br>Yuru Yuri is the superior Yuri show, and its not very hard to see why.</br>  The only thing I ever dropped late in was Otaku no Musume.  <br>I almost dropped Death Note because of that too, but kept watching just to see Light suffer and die. It was worth it.</br>  The second-to last episode of IS2.  <br>Yuru yuri is good but it has an utter lack of comfy. NNB is a better match for the yuyus.</br>  <br> wanting light to die <br><br>I don't understand. He was a good person.</br></br></br>  <br>I once dropped a series after the penultimate episode. I didn't want to give the series the satisfaction of ending after so much trash. I had to doom it to a never ending cycle of never ending shit</br>  <br> Ro-Kyu-Bu! <br>I realized that I really wasn't interested in basketball.</br></br>  <br>If that means infinite stratos, I dropped that shit too.<br><br>Something about adding more girls who want nothing to do with ichika, but he still spends his time with them to pad out the length this haremshit can go on for.<br><br>Mangaka is a fucking hack and I'm glad he gets torn up on the internet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree. Yuyushiki is pretty average. There's really nothing memorable about it and the characters get boring when it's the same schtick every episode. I don't get all the buzz about it.</br>  <br>Oh, I was on the second to last episode.</br>  Bleach after the Soul Society arc.<br>Nurutu after like 1XX episodes.<br>Lucky Star at episode 14.<br>Zero no Tsukaima S3 a couple of episodes in.<br>Plastic Memories after 10 episodes.<br>Log Horizon S2 14 episodes in.<br>Valvrave S2 like 5 episodes in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dropped the Fairy Tail anime last winter</br>  <br>Explaining why yuyushiki is exceptional would take too long typing on this shitty phone.</br>  <br>I was fine with the harem business, I just hated how he tried to stuff actual plot near the end.</br>  <br> muh mysteries  <br><br>end your life, dude</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Right now i'm on ep 8 and at this point i feel like i'm forcing myself to watch it, probably won't finish it.<br><br>I just don't feel engaged with the characters nor the story.<br><br>I don't understand why it caused so much buzz when it came out</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuyushiki is one of those shows that makes for great reaction pics but is really painfully average.</br>  <br>I actually dropped Dog Days and DxD in their third seasons this year.<br><br>Literally nothing happened in either show's latest season and even the fanservice got old.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I kind of like the storyline, but its just too goddamn dark for a harem show.<br><br>Like just let ichika fuck houki and make all the other girls fuck off, and THEN give me some gritty SciFi bullshit if you must.</br></br></br>  <br>probably naruto at around the point where it had the filler shit storm. I never picked it up after that. The other one was one piece about 100 episodes in. I already read the manga so its not as bad, but damn does the show drag.</br>  <br>have fun watching your dull and mind-numbing anime.</br>  <br>Free during the second season. It wasn't that great and I just lost interest. The threads were abysmal too. I don't care about homoshit and shipping, I just wanted to watch a swimming show</br>  <br>Dog Days S3.<br><br>I mean, I wasn't expecting excellence from DD but what the fuck was season 3?</br></br></br>  <br>It's like someone said, "what if we took all the references, excitement and events out of lucky star, and made two of the characters really gay for the other one?"<br><br>Yuyushiki is like watching public broadcast television.</br></br></br>  <br> Plastic Memories after 10 episodes. <br><br>How could you after made it that far?<br><br>You missed the ending and   the tears  </br></br></br></br></br>  I dropped one piece shortly after ace died. Because suddenly these devil fruits that were supposed to be rare, seemed to be on sale in walmart and everyone had these fucking things now. They also began to overpower the shit out of everyone.  <br>I hope you weren't planning on saying something along the lines of, "It's a realistic depiction of friendship among highschool girls."</br>  Haruhi Suzumiya shortly a couple episodes after the endless eight stuff. i dunno, i sort of lost interest and don't remember anything about the series. not sure why it's so hyped up - it didn't feel special and i don't remember anything except the first episode and the endless eight - really forgettable.  dropped the monogatari series on the season where there was time travel of the snail and the snake killing everyone.  <br>Rippling muscular men in every frame, and you thought it was a swimming show?<br><br>lol</br></br></br>  <br>Excluding shit like Naruto.<br><br>Phi Brain. For some reason I kept expecting it to get good. I watched shitty episode after shitty episode for two whole 25 episode long cours. I watched the first episode of S3, and realized it was going to be the same shit all over again.<br><br>I dropped it about 10 minutes into that episode.</br></br></br></br></br>  Not an anime but I dropped Kimi no Iru like a hot turd the moment the main character went back to Eri/Emi/That cheating bitch who's veggie bit on the side died. I maintain that Childhood friend was best end and second girlfriend would have been pretty decent end too  <br>I was practically forcing myself to watch it after like episode 6 or something. When I got to 10 I just realized forcing myself to watch crap I don't like just to finish it is stupid.</br>  <br>Same</br>  <br>A little bit. Its a more genuine depiction of friendship than I see in almost any other show.<br><br>I only read the manga of lucky star. Is the anime that good?</br></br></br>  <br>Kami Nomi, third episode of last series.</br>  <br> yys is a depiction of real friendship <br>No, it is not. Yui is the only friend, the others are in it for the tuna.<br> is lucky star that good <br>It's anime Seinfeld, you have to at least watch it.</br></br></br></br>  yuru yuri like 8 episodes into s2<br><br>it was so goddamn repetitive</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing you dropped it early.</br>  <br> Anime Seinfeld title belongs to Joshiraku my friend. </br>  <br> mad yuyushiki fag </br>  <br>I dropped Log Horizon well into S2.</br>  <br>Why do people always post this about shows, like making you relaxed is a bad quality to have as a show? I watched 1 episode of hidamari sketch a night, right before I went to bed and I loved it. Felt so good going to bed.</br>  <br>The movie somewhat justifies the hype. The actual series isn't particularly great and is only really serves as a set up for the movie.</br>  <br>Because it's frustrating when I'm trying to watch an episode and I keep dozing off halfway in. Then I end up having to rewatch it because I missed some parts. Everyone keeps saying it's better to watch it while drunk but I don't want to do that.</br>  <br>I'm glad I dropped it and picked up yuyushiki</br>    I got to the 2nd season 5th episode of kuroko no basket then just stopped because it was cancer.  Shirobako after episode 23.  <br>Yeah, slice of life shows are the best to watch under the influence of drugs. Watched every episode of aria like that, which may have been the reason aria is one of the few shows I've given a 10/10 to.</br>    <br>I never dropped anything, I've just forgotten that I was watching it.</br>  <br>If you need to be under the influence of drugs to enjoy something, it's objectively shit.</br>  70-something episodes of Bleach back when I was in middle school. I watched them in 3 parts on YouTube, ah memories.  <br>That's the worst place you could have dropped Code Geass at. You lazy bum.</br>  <br>this<br><br>NNB when high was an amazing experience</br></br></br>  <br>I'm like you, I even finished ojamajo doremi and still watching pokemon since I started when I was a kid. <br><br>Glasslip..... that chicken though.</br></br></br>  I think the furthest I went was 10 minutes into the last episode of Selector Spread Wixoss and just couln't justify riding the rest of the episode out.<br><br>Runner-up would be Kekkai Sensen, if only because last episode never.</br></br>  <br>I dropped fairy tail around the 4th season way back when</br>  I thought Yuki-chan was 1 cour, so when I saw it on the summer charts I decided I couldn't take any more.<br>Turns out there was only one more episode, but I just don't care.</br>   Yugioh Arc-V <br><br>I don't even hate it, I just feel like I would enjoy it more watching it at my own pace/marathoning it after it's over. I've been starting to feel that way about weekly anime in general, lately.</br></br>  I watched season 1 of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and was thoroughly underwhelmed. Had too high expectations. So I doubt I'll be watching the rest, which I guess can be interpreted as dropping the anime.  Crystal may be over  for now , but we can always have a Sailor Moon thread.  <br> I'm watching the japanese dub <br> japanese dub </br></br>  <br><br>First season best season</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0Cu<wbr>A1ov1-Pk</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Eh6<wbr>EStbsO3Y</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Holy shit you have shit taste.

I mean masks are the symbols of ghouls.</br>  <br>Nothing.  Maybe starting operation for masked Qs by the end of the chapter. </br>  People complain about the pacing but compared to One Piece the pacing is faster and the payoff is just as good.  <br>They need to infiltrate or whatever. The only rift I see happening is if Haise puts on his old mask.</br>  <br> I'm waiting since Re started, nigga. <br>kek do you even read the Manga?<br>There are many things he alredy delivered.<br><br>Again think back to TG , what had he delivered until CH40 ?</br></br></br></br></br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #3<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>  Requesting Laharl saying something motivating or being overly happy from being called maou-sama!
