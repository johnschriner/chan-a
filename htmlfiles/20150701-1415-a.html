[ I thought that the series would have jazz music, the trailer was saying that everywhere, someone else felt cheated? <br>I was the only one who does not care the cheap yuri and just wanted jazz music?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mmG<wbr>8gve8qKc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  I wanted feet  <br>Jazz would've been nice, but I liked what we got.</br>  <br>fanarts can fix that anon, but nothing can't fix a soundtrack</br>  <br>i liked to, but the OP is right, the PV is showing something that never going to happen and that's misleading advertising<br><br>Kyoani didn't find a way</br></br></br>  <br>If Hibike! was about cute girls in a jazz band it would be a hundred times better<br>Just make Kumiko play the trombone with Shuuichi and you've got a tight-knit and lovable group of characters instead of the flood of sameface background characters</br></br>  <br><br> Just make Kumiko play the trombone with Shuuichi <br><br>Nice try hetfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only picked it because it's the closest instrument to the eupho</br>  They make-up scene didn't disappoint.  <br>I feel the same way. Almost everything could use more Jazz, but I did enjoy high school band setting. I haven't enjoyed watching a Kyoani show this much since Hyouka.</br>  <br>better to be a hetfag instead of a yurifag</br>   Euphonium in the title <br> herpderp this is going to be jazz! </br>  There will be a second season right?  <br>very unlikely</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>relax anon, the very title of the series says , why wait all series for jazz if it was obvious it was a school band?<br><br>this should make you happy, anon</br></br></br>  <br>Thx for these gif. Made me laugh so much.</br>  <br>I hope, we need an episode in a pool or on the beach, I need natsuki in swimsuit</br>  <br>not a lot of material left, author ended the series at like 5 books I think?</br>  <br>But this season didn't cover the entire source material right?</br>  Now that it's all over can we all agree Hibike Euphonium was AOTS? DanMachi was runner up.  <br>No, this season only covered Volume 1, there's still plenty of material left. I don't think there's going to be a second season because the final episode gave no indication of it being a possibility and the sales haven't exactly been stellar.</br>  <br>  Natsuki in swimsuit </br>  <br>No, that would be sidonia S2.</br>  She looks lovely.  <br> the trailer was saying that everywhere <br><br>Sounds like you're just a retard that cant tell the difference between a Jazz band and an Orchestra. It's your own fault for being such an ignorant piece of shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Saturday Night Live <br>worst meme of this show tbh</br></br>  <br>Actually, I love you.</br>  The part at 18:30 was a little bit too off-key, and Reina still kept playing like a god. Due to her god-like performance the other instruments were only shadows.<br><br>She won the competition.</br></br>  <br>I don't even understand it. Why do you make these images? Are they supposed to be funny?</br>  <br>imagine all the hibike girls in swimsuit</br>  <br>Of course there will. This episode made it very clear. Anyone who thinks there isn't is literally retarded.</br>  WHERE'S SHUIICHI  <br>W-wrong picture</br>  <br> group picture <br> owari <br> no previews or anything <br> oboe-chan didn't even get any lines <br>I'm not sure anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>idiot</br>  <br><br>Bottom left</br></br>  <br> imagine all the hibike girls in swimsuit </br>  Novel anon, didn't lie. Kumiko was expecting him.  <br>Oboe and Fagot girls get a certificate for being the best girls.<br><br>We did it /a/, we did it.</br></br></br>  I think Natsuki and Reina grew on me, with Natsuki not caring for, and Reina me disliking her.<br>Ironically, I loved Asuka, but I ended up not liking her as much due to her bs. Not hate her or anything, just not like her as much as I did before.<br><br>How has your opinions changed of characters throughout the series, /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's Knuckle, he don't chuckle</br>  Voice says "Fagotto"<br>Sub says "Bassoons"<br>Why is this allowed   for a good taste  ?</br></br>  Knuckles and entourage anime when?  <br> Hibike EUPHONIUM <br> expecting Jazz </br></br>  <br><br> Eupho is not a jazz instrument <br> herpderp I'm retarded <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PDM<wbr>R9IhAecI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Between Sensei and mini-sensei.</br>  <br>In order for it to be any more confirmed they would have had to have given Natsuki some line like "Btw guys S2 next year keep it up"<br><br>It's as good as set in stone, it was obvious.</br></br></br>  In the end, did all the yuribaiting make the show better or worse?  <br> Implying it's standard <br> Implying you couldn't do 2 seconds in google to see what kind of music it's originally about </br></br>  <br>That's strange, why does he look so happy.</br>  <br>It made the threads focus on something almost completely irrelevant to the show</br>  <br>Obviously worse. Landed a few more sheckels in KyoAni's pockets though, so there's that.</br>   Stop talking about my husbando, please. ;_;     <br>There's nothing that yuri doesn't improve</br>  <br>Because Kumiko basically gave him a blowjob just before they walked on stage?</br>  <br>It made the show worse, the relationships worse, the characters worse, the threads worse, the fanbase worse, and ultimately made it sell worse.</br>  <br>A fistbump is a blowjob?</br>  <br> first <br>Cool senpai friendship<br> second <br>reconciliation with childhood friend<br> third <br>the warmth of true love</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Threadly reminder Reina is old enough to marry  Taki   <br>Then Natsuki is fucking slut.</br>  <br> that guy on the bottom left surrounded by girls <br>Too cool to hang with the other guys eh?</br></br>  <br>I don't know about that last part but the fistbump was obviously meant to represent friendship, so yes Shuichi was friendzoned.</br>  <br>In that context, yes, just like a half chewed skewer is like beef wellington for a dog.</br>    <br><br><br> the warmth of true love </br></br></br>  That was a great ride. I had fun!  <br>Oh wow, you probably found a total of 3 youtube videos of some special snowflake playing ballads on euphonium! Good for you!<br><br>That doesn't change the fact that the last thing you should think when you see a show titled "euphonium" is jazz.</br></br></br>  <br>He's the guy from the beginning of the episode that all the girls were waiting on. He only hangs out with girls</br>  <br>It was worse from the narrative point of view, but which ensures sales of blu rays, also it was what people wanted and kyoani is an expert in this type of fanservice and unfinished romances</br>  <br>Not so sure about that, anon. Kumiko blushed for the first time when talking to him. She also went after it, rather than returning.<br><br>Seemed like a pretty straightforward hint.</br></br></br>  <br>Hi Reddit</br>    <br> the relationships worse, the characters worse <br>I don't really see how.</br></br>  Is Hibike the best Kyoani show  besides Hyouka?   <br> He loves fluffy people </br>  <br>AAAHAHAHAHAHHA HE POSTED THE WRONG PICTURE LOL WHAT A LOSER<br><br> It´s ok bro </br></br></br>  <br> better to be a yuriwinner instead of hetrash <br>fixed</br></br>  <br>But when I see a show titled "euphonium" the only thing I think of is, "what the fuck is a euphonium"</br>   Oi, wanker. Fist bump.   <br>Because the anime purposely downplayed the relationship between Kumiko and Shuuichi and replaced it with a bunch of typical yuribait.</br>  <br>I think I can actually agree with that. Disappearance is still the best thing the've ever gone though.</br>  <br>Who is this semen succubus?</br>  <br>Hibike is just a worse version of Free with girls and band instead of boys and swimming.</br>  <br>I bet she sucks dick like a pro</br>  <br>Hibike is miles better than Free.</br>  <br> Frees just a worse version of K-on with boys and swimming instead of girls and band. </br>  <br> big violin </br>  But who was best girl?  <br>I'm personally glad they went with an ensemble story. Jazz K-on would feel retreaded.<br>Yeah it was lacking in actual music but at least it wasn't totally devoid of characterization.</br></br>  <br>Asuka<br> Fagotts tie for best background girls </br></br>  Does kyoani paint or use pictures and edit them for backgrounds? How do they make so many nice looking pictures in a short amount of time?

They could've been replaced with Asuka and Natsuki in the PV and promo art.</br></br></br>  Hey guys, I have a question.<br><br>Can I watch free without an associated risk of turning homosexual? Been wanting to really bad lately.</br></br>  <br>That's anime for you. I wanted The lie in April to be about music as well.</br>  HAHAHAHA  <br>There's literally nothing gay about bros swimming together</br>  <br/>  Reina's solo made me tear up  <br>Kumiko, objectively. She was the best written character.</br>  <br>Some big bands have tuba</br>  <br>Wait, so a studio finally puts effort into their works? Woah!</br>   Taki-xedo  <br>Fucking kyoani, that joke was stupid.</br>  <br><br>Are you implying K-on was devoid of characterization?</br></br>  Which pieces were played in this show?  Why didn't they show Oboe-chan's solo?  My face when I enjoy Kumiko and Reina's friendship and budding seeds between Shuichi and her. <br><br>I believe they'll be a season two with Nozomi being shown and Mizore's frame prominence.</br></br>  Well that went exactly as expected<br><br>I was glad to see Ui finally return but the series as a whole was eh</br></br>  <br>The entire performance made me feel like an overemotional fagott. All that hard work paying off, man.

That's when we'll see the solo</br>  <br>I saw some promo art, it was as gay as Hibike!'s.<br><br>And we all know Hibike is a yuri show.</br></br></br>  <br><br>this is kowaii</br></br>  <br>This.Beautifully animated Kyoanus feet.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4791676  <br><br>You can do this with any Kyoani show honestly.</br></br>  <br>It looks 2 real.</br>  <br>Way too much foreshadowing for there to not be an S2.<br>Don't kid yourself.</br></br>  <br>I want to believe</br>  <br>what foreshadowing</br>  I need more crescent moon in my life.<br>OST when?</br>  <br>Reina is 16</br>  <br> foreshadowing <br>If there's a S2, its foreshadowing, if there's not S2, then its just some nice visual queues for novelfags.</br></br>  <br>Taki's dead wife.<br>Asuka's story.<br>Nationals.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Chuuni is just Full Metal Panic!

KnK and Tamako got movies instead.</br>  <br>Clannad?</br>  Which boy has the better harem, Tanabe or Glasses?  <br>These are all plotlines unnecessary to the story. I could see a movie but not much more.</br>  <br>Triangle Festival is objectively the best episode of the decade and only god knows when there will be another one like that since a flawless episode happens once, maybe twice a decade. I'm not a fan of yuri myself but that was really well made so better, I think.</br>  <br>No.<br>But an uninspired K-on recolor, which most of this board expected/purported, that focused more on music fanservice than an overarching story, may have been. Ideally we'd have both, but I personally would take my chances on what we got, not what the trailers led us to believe.</br></br>  <br>Glasses looks like he is that one guy who the girls all ignore</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_CT<wbr>YymbbEL4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> not playing this </br></br>  <br>You don't play jazz with big brass such as Euphonium and Tuba.</br>  <br>Just wait till he becomes a senior.</br>  Holy shit, what a cutie.  <br>Glasses is truly the King of Harem.<br><br>He's like.

He's already peaked.</br>  <br>I want to bite those thighs.</br>  <br>Well shit.<br>Guess he's just another fucking loser. It can't be helped.</br></br>  not enough feet.  <br>That's really painful, nibling is ok, licking is encouraged.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Clannad sold 20k+.</br>  Remember in the beginning when every Eupho thread had Whiplash references? Now it's died off.    <br> That's really painful, <br>It is Reina.</br></br>  <br>Probably because the plot advanced past that conflict?</br>  <br> grumpy chan is smiling  <br>Dropped.</br></br>  Do you think Reina would be courageous enough to try to kiss Taki? I think she would.  I want to see their faces when  copper.   <br>To the right of Taki.</br>  <br>Yuribait made it better.

At this point it almost looks like it's going to come down to number of weeks in theaters and whatever kind of benefits they can add to screenings. I think Madoka was in theaters for 12 weeks, K-On had 14 weeks I believe. Both had more screens than Love Live has aired on, significantly more in K-Ons case I believe. Love Live is ahead of where K-On was in it's 4th week on it's third week by 50 million yen (250 million ahead of where K-On was on it's 3rd week) and about 40 million yen back from where Madoka was on it's 30 week.<br><br>All in all Sunrise has again done really well at keeping pace with emerging hits with ones of their own.

Starts off with a guitar solo before building up and leading into the vocals<br>Blueberry Train- Sounds like something Kotori would sing about.<br>Mahoutsukai Hajimemashita- Unlimited Smiles<br>Arifureta Kanashimi- Slow melody with Yoshino's voice. Works surprisingly well.<br>No Brand Girls- Sums up µ's. They started off with barely any recognition but they kept trying hard until they became one of the most popular 2d Idol Brands.<br>baby maybe Koi no button- Nice melody also Kotori's voice.<br>Nawatobi- Soft melody by Hanayo.<br>Takaramonozu- I like the fast pace.<br>Yume naki Yume janai- A cheerful song by Honoka<br>Eien Friends- Possibly Printemps Best Song<br>Mermaid Festa Vol. 1- Sounds Spanish-ish. Still don't know what the genre is called.<br>Snow Halation- Soft ballad with Honoka solo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Which LL is the least straight?  <br>Nozomi.</br>  Honk?  <br>Best girl</br>  <br> LL <br> straight </br></br>  <br><br>Honk</br></br>  Fuck Rin.  <br>Hanayo pls</br>  I LOVE YOU UMI!

Only thing that's ranked higher for anime is the Muse stuff from the movie. That's amazing, like as far as I know they don't even have a sample for what they sound like yet and the brand is just selling itself.

Watch Aqours debut go ahead and probably sell more than whatever the latest iDOLM@STER disc is and people still claim that Love Live is going to die and everything is A-Ok with iDOLM@STER. The actually reality is that both series seem to be doing fine, Love Live is just several orders of magnitude more popular.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly I think it's because iDOLM@STER fans continue to just be super butthurt and keep insisting Love Live is dying. They're the problem because they're just so fucking salty and full of sour grapes that Love Live is the more successful Bamco idol franchise against all odds. Eventually I can see the Love Live fans getting fed up and starting to hit back.</br></br>  <br>Are they OTPs?</br>  Tell me reasons why anyone would like Nico.    <br>Nico's hips.</br>  Spoilers are out  <br>That's from like 3 weeks ago.

I would be pretty mad if she is.</br>  <br>that was legit</br>  <br>Don't think it's true.<br>And I wanted Naruto to end up with Karin.</br></br>  <br>Because you want things to be different<br><br>Everything points to Sakura being the real mother but you secretly hope that Sarada has at least Karin's DNA</br></br></br>  I'm beginning to wonder that Kishi got the entire DNA plot after browsing forums  <br> Kishi liking Karin <br>Didn't he say in an interview that he thought of hemorrhoids when writing her powers?</br></br>  <br>Inb4 she is mom of Suigetsu's kids.</br>  <br>that was written with google translate japanese. takl and other translators saw it was fake</br>  <br>Nah. <br><br>Suigetsu didn't give a fuck when the DNA test came out. <br>Dude doesn't care, he likes chopping people</br></br></br></br>  <br> Everything points to Sakura being the real mother </br>  <br>Does this mean we can finally make Yuru Yuri threads bannable? I hate those faggots.</br>  There was this baseless SS rumor going around for the Bolt movie about SS having a boy named Saizo.<br><br>It would be funny if this was true but the one having the new Uchiha kid is Karin.</br></br>  <br>Her power is causing hemorrhoids in every Sakura fan.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413917 <br> If I was ever going to end the story with romance I had been planning to let Sasuke end up with 香燐 (Karin). In the process I decided to make her a member of the うずまき一族 (Uzumaki-clan) <br><br>KISHIIIIIIIII</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ah, I see, never mind then. carry on.</br></br>   I would love to see him doing something like a 10 year time skip though, and only few of the kids still around, with Sarada and Boruto as the protagonists in a crazy, post-apocalyptic world where all the adults were slayed by some uber-powerful enemy - think of Future Trunks' in DBZ, that sorta thing. But really, I don't think Kishimoto would ever go there... unfortunately. <br><br><br>Why is mangastream filled with such shit taste</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>Kishi really needs some balls</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>That was bs you fag, even nips in 2chan were laughing at it.</br>  <br> wants to make her Sasuke's love interest <br> puts her in the same family as Naruto  <br>what the hell man</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>I can pinpoint the moment he tried the NaruKarin thing. <br><br>I hate this popularity stuff</br></br></br>  <br>I got it... Blood Transfusion</br>  <br>So, this the power of no editors</br>  Dont forget to report these threads  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>Do people still fall for bs interviews?</br>  <br>if you feel like i do, you just really want sasusaku fans to go full meltdown<br><br>also...i guess karin teaching her daughter salad how to autopsy corpses and hide lock pick sets all over her body is a nice image.</br></br></br>  <br> [pottery intensifies] <br><br><br>That could work. Somehow.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I don't keep up with these things very much. I'll just delete it so it doesn't get quoted by idiots looking for straws.</br></br>  <br>I'm surprised sakura has fans. How the hell people could like her?</br>  <br>I can't stop crying when thinking of what could have been if Kishimoto didn't have to mantain Sakura and Hinata around. Well not Hinata because she's barely relevant and 10 chapters out of the entire serialization are about her but still. <br><br>Makes me wonder if Naruto could've been a really good manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Chakra chains are the shit and you want SScucks to be salty and butthurt until the end of time.<br><br>Also because nobody wants Pink Shit 2.0 from Salad.</br></br></br>  <br>That was some random speculation from the Boruto movie site having a countdown timer for a secret to be revealed some time around July 28th and somehow the first thing that was conjured up was a kid for Sasuke and Sakura.</br>  <br>She's main girl. <br><br>People like main girl, doesn't matter how she is.

The real spoilers will be out in 24 hours, right?  <br><br> she literally is wearing Sarada's school girl outfit </br></br>  <br>Rai is the most reliable but doesn't know Japanese so he can only tell us his own interpretation of the panels.</br>  <br> I don't know if it's legit, but there was an interview with Kishimoto leaked a few months back where Kishi said if it were up to him, Sasuke would have ended up with Karin, but the problem was Karin's lack of popularity compared to Sakura. <br>Kishi probably wanted Salad to have Chakra Chains. So maybe this is his roundabout way to get it?</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, kishi is a confirmed faggot.</br>  Someone 'cracked' Evil's message.<br><br>Collect the first letter of each sentence. <br>Then you get the letters: kaarihinpitsmgonm<br><br>When you unscramble it, it reads<br>Spoiler: <br>Ha, Karin isn't mom, pig!<br><br><br>No I'm not kidding either, that's really what it reads when you unscramble it. <br><br>Bolt is best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Karin <br> loli Karin <br>It's not even up for debate in this panel.</br></br></br>  Which Gurashi would you infect?  <br>Sensei is actually a tulpa and has been dead for ages.</br>  <br>Reddit, /v/, tumblr, and facebook are all worse.</br>  <br>It's quite obviously the bear, anon.

I mean come on we're really stretching out the definition then. He hasn't been even remotely as edgy as Ishida who also isn't the edgiest character. Ishida also hasn't had a perspective in like 3 years, and the last time he did, he was no where near as edgy as when he'd first been introduced and was getting his arm thrown around.<br>Vegeta is just a joke.<br>So in the end it comes down to:<br>Hiei&gt;Sasuke&gt;Hakuryuu</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah the only edgy thing about law is his tatoos which are just kida meh</br>  <br>God damn has anyone been keeping track of how many times this faggot has posted the same image, or a slight variation of the original?

I need an additional typesetter for Neko Musume.

It's been like two weeks and this shit is still not subbed. Absolutely useless. Fuck you all.  <br>How is that? Gatchaman is still popular IP in Japan, Tatsunoko still licenses them out for games and such.</br>  <br>Because the show had literally fuck all to do with Gatchaman. <br><br>And I'm not saying it's a bad show. It's actually pretty interesting. It has enough cool concepts that it could have stood on it's own as a new IP without being reliant on brand name recognition. <br><br>...instead they called it "Gatchaman", lured all the Gatchaman fans to come look at it, and dissapointed them. The only people who like the show are people who don't know anything about Gatchaman....which makes you wonder why they decided to name it Gatchaman?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lured all the Gatchaman fans to come look at it <br>god get over yourself already<br> T-THE SHOW TRICKED ME! </br></br></br>  <br> which makes you wonder why they decided to name it Gatchaman? <br>Because the live action Gatchaman movie was also releasing around the same time.</br></br>  <br> Because the show had literally fuck all to do with Gatchaman. <br>Fair enough. We don't see it too much in anime as we do in things like movies and video games but I don't really enjoy cashing in on franchises either. That said though, Tatsunoko does it a lot, and each time they've done it they've turned a simple children's cartoon into something, if not altogether enjoyable, is never the less trying for something more than it's progenitor. And because of that I try not to look at things like Casshern Sins, Crowds, or Yoru no Yatterman as cash grabs or the raping of a franchise. I can't tell you exactly why they've been doing it, I'm not a mind reader, but I don't think it's something to see malice in or approach jaded.<br><br>Also <br> The only people who like the show are people who don't know anything about Gatchaman <br>Is just not true. it's a broad sweeping generalization with a dash of elitism thrown in for good measure.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Orchestr/a/ turns 1 year old today, and we're celebrating by releasing our very first album.<br><br>MP3 - https://mega.co.nz/#!zJNF0AyB!UXJxp<wbr>kBovjS7N0QmyytAb9TBZ-DysosVweWeflam<wbr>k2A<br>FLAC - https://mega.co.nz/#F!qVEylRZI!rr1L<wbr>md4U2KkqlKgp43Er-w<br>MF Mirror [MP3] - http://www.mediafire.com/?1t9nxjqym<wbr>sebsil<br>YouTube: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dq6<wbr>yF7Kh4DY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>A huge thanks goes out to all of the /a/nons who made this possible.</br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> PDF <br><br>Why don't boards other than /tg/ support .pdf uploads?</br></br></br>  <br>There are old teachers who will teach for cheap.<br>Heck, some of them charge *because* they wouldn't have students otherwise if they didn't.<br>If that sounds stupid, that's because it is. sasuga ningen</br></br></br>  <br>Learn to read music, you pleb.

K-ON is an excellent anime.</br>  <br><br> Fujobait <br><br>Why do people keep spouting this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean considering KyoAni has below average production values what do they have to worry about unlike Bones who actually have budget. KyoAni aren't competent they just use cheap tricks in order to make dumb faggots like you think their visuals are top notch.</br>  <br>Best anime of its season, hands down.</br>  Wasted potential. The setting and world building was by far the best part of the show but it was largely skimmed over in favor of the mediocre to annoying characters and their secret club of overpowered blood mages. On top of that I felt like the plot arcs were being machine-gunned at me, and none of them had very much impact because of it.</blockquote>]
