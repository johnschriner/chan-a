[ Last thread was defeated in a glorious battle of discussion  Speaking of Battles, I'm hoping to see another Ichigo fight.  When will Jugram stop being best girl? The answer is never.   and speaking of discussion aren't most of ichigo's 'fights' his way of arguing for information and debating?    I guess. I just want to see this New Bankai, Sword, and to see if he has Getsuga Tensho still. The Japanese voice actor for Ichigo was amazing.    He will, if he dare to kill best SR Bazz-B.    more like bazzed-b  Bazz rhymes with base, right?       rhymes  What are you doing?      inb4 quincy/ hollow dual wield     you making a prince of bel air rap? I could see that working      Would Based-B be better?     Yes. kek     tfw one day ywach shows up and fucks us around    got bored and made this using this anon's template  chekem out     Waiting on bateman    did we start the fire guys?   In the last thread someone posted Tier locked away but wasn't she freed?   Where did young yahweh get wraparound shades a thousand years before their invention?    no.   The last thread was filled with 4th level mindfucks. Can we achieve that now?   He's just too cool to care about things like that.  Not invented yet? Like I give a fuck.

No idea where she is now, but she was never freed and the tres bestias were defeated by quilge so there was no one with any particular interest in rescuing her left.     urahara   freed   free   get anything from urahara without a price  kek  inb4 he ran a black market         Will Tessai ever use his cuhrayzee wizard powers in battle proper or are we destined to be forever blueballed?

The Familiar of Zero Light Novels to Continue After Author's Passing  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-06-25/the-familiar-of-zero-l<wbr>ight-novels-to-continue-after-autho<wbr>r-passing/.89697</wbr></wbr></wbr>     bump for my first anime induced boner   Nice, that's the fucking good news of the day.  One day this will be for Berserk/Hunter x Hunter.  Which ending was most disappointing?  I dropped two of these shows at the first episode and didn't even start the third, so I wouldn't know.  Never picked up any of these because the MC alone looked generic and annoying as fuck.   A/Z  It's probably GC but I can't tell since I'm still dropping it every week     fuck that's hard....going with aldnoah because of the jimmy rustling the first season left ppl with   Finish that thing already    GC, everything about the ending hit me in the feels.  The only thing that bothered me about A/Z was no Inko end      Guilty Crown, he didn't achieve his goals and was crippled for it. Also the final fight was quite awfull looking. It hast the best ost and visuals though.       The only thing that bothered me about A/Z was no Inko end  This.    A/Z, and not only the end, but the entire second season was a pile of shit.   Obviously A/Z, since other two were so bad i didnt had any hopes or expectations from them.    A/Z    This post implies A/Z's second season wasn't irredeemable gutter trash from the start.    Disappointing? Aldnoah.  Soul-crushing? GC.  I'm glad it's over.jpg? VVV.        AZ was such a load of nothing with absolutely no one dying I can't see how the others could be worse.     Go to bed Inko.     GC's ending wasn't disappointing, it was downright jaw-dropping in its sheer force of "fuck you" towards Shu. The entire series was one enormous "fuck you" to Shu, but the ending was like the "go to hell Shu" cherry on the "fuck you Ouma" sundae. I want to know who hated him that much on Guilty Crown's creative team, because holy shit.    proably AZ, even if the other 2 are way worse as a whole, expecially GC    Yeah but even with a shitty second season a good end could have turn it around see Code Geass.     implying A.Z is not worse than both     All end worst end. If you ever find yourself watching this just get up and walk away/    It's okay anon, Shu can take it. Those people might hate him, but at least i still love him as he is.    R2 was fun at least. AZ was just a ball of whirling bad angst and drama for no reason with Count Faggot. What a waste of time.    That's what he said    Obligatory    A/Z because literally nothing happened.  It starts off with the war and builds up for the entire first and second seasons, then Hime wakes up and she's like lolnope and everyone agrees with her.  The war ends and nothing significant happens other than Slaine being thrown in prison because fuck Slaine.  At least in VVV's and GC's ending, shit actually happened.          You and I both, anon. Shoe is a good boy and I appreciate him.     Inori is my DROPPED   actually decent episode DROPPED   Every fucking time         What the fuck did you expect to happen? The whole point of the show was stopping the war because martians were being dumbasses. And Slaine being the biggest asshat. The whole 2nd season shouldn't even exist to be honest. It just stretched out the obvious conclusion.    CG. Seriously fuck that ending.  Then AZ. Then VVV.      *Should be GC. Stupid initials.    I was riding on this tiny hope that Slaine would actually win.   I wish Cabaneli won't end up nearly as bad.   I watched all three and I'm going with A/Z, because for the first half of the episodes, I actually thought it would be good.   Only AZ managed to save some expectations until the end. You knew exactly what you'll get in the other two.     I only watched it because Urobuchi's name was on it   FTFY. The show was shit from the start you just got caught in the hype.       No. I'm not one of these guys, but I watched the first episode of A/Z while having a very ambivalent opinion on Urobuchi (either he makes shit or gold it seems) and really enjoyed the series till the last episode of season 1. The announcement of a second season was the death warrant of the whole license.     I liked it     expecting the villain to win   expecting the villain to win and doom glorious earth to racist nazi rulers  I can't even process how you could arrive to such a retarded thought from what the show gives you      Neither post made a single mention of Urobuchi    VVV's ending and whole "losing memory" stuff that happened to Haruto looked like forced drama to me. Second season was all about forced drama actually, I hated it.     waifu loves you   but you don't get to stay with her  Why?      They tried so hard to convince everyone that Inaho was cool and hip "look everyone! He might have te personality of stale bread - but hey he's got a robot eye!"    He must live and atone.    But they did nothing wrong    yea it started so promising in the first cour, 2nd one was a huge disappointment ;_;  Im with VVV for most disappointing, AZ was never good so why would the ending matter.      Definitely not A/Z because by the time it ended I expected absolutely nothing out of it.  I guess Valvrave because I never stopped hoping it would go back to being a stupid fun ride even after season two was consistently disappointing.      First two boys were too good for this world  Too good  It's sad        VVV S2 was straight up different anime than S1 to me. They should've just skipped hundred or two hundred years to show how world is fucked midseason or in first episode. Since eating memories/emotions was revealed I was sure Haruto will end up like that, so it wasn't dissapointing. I didn't expect aliens and it left me laughing. GC, author wanted to shit on shoe, didn't expect it. Would have been better for him to die. Dissapointed? No, more surprised. Don't know third one.         nd really enjoyed the series till the last episode of season 1.  So shit taste     It's far more enjoyable than the shitpile that is S2.   A/Z.  (Dis-)Honorable mentions for both GC and VVV but GC was disappointing long before it got to its ending and VVV was at least more of a ride.  A/Z's ending was pretty much suggested by several charcters as not being feasible even if Asseylum came back, then required a new character to be pulled Aoki-tachi's ass 3 episodes before the end to actually work — and still dint really solve the problems that caused the war in the first place.  Bonus retard points for suggesting that Crutheo's whipping boy who only became a significant political force 2 years after the war started was had legitimate influence to try and assassinate Asseylum and people believing it.        AZ because everything from it was shit, expect some OST tracks. Atleast two shits above are fun ride    A/Z's ending was pretty much suggested by several charcters as not being feasible even if Asseylum came back  Except the whole season was building up to her waking up and blowing Slaine's plan to shambles.   and still dint really solve the problems that caused the war in the first place.  Except it did since aldnoah is becoming universal and war is over, unlike the alternative of earth getting taken over and counts not wanting to give up their shit even more.  For your last point, the retarded whipping boy shouldn't have killed the dude who did do it, then grab his shit and run for the goal whilst tripping over himself. AZ was always shit and leading up to this ending. You just got caught up in delusions from reading too many fanfics.              Despite being really, really shitty itself, A/Z was still the best of the three going into the end, which made it's awful ending seem worse.  Surprisingly, Vulvarape's ending was probably the best of the three, since it at least stayed consistent instead of being any more retarded than the rest of the season.     no one curr   Worst to Best:  GC - AZ - VVV    Vulvarape by a landslide.  most incompetent person is now the president of everything   MC sacrificed himself so retards could keep on shitting up everything   fucking ayy lmao out of nowhere    What the fuck. A/Z may have big problems with the ending, but they aren't as evident as in VVV.       If you compare early episodes to the last couple A/Z easily is the biggest drop off.    Except the whole season was building up to her waking up and blowing Slaine's plan to shambles.  He just said that it was never fucking feasible dumbfuck because they have to make up some random douchebag in order to make it work and it was still an asspull.    Except it did since aldnoah is becoming universal and war is over  Wrong. They're still haven't made it so and they're still counts on Earth, all that happened is that Hime took away her planets only valuable resource and gave it to Earth thus screwing them over.   I'm not even sure what the fuck the last point is.           A/Z was still the best of the three going into the end  Kill yourself.      but they aren't as evident as in VVV.  Uh...except VVV never went against its own tagline. There's really nothing wrong with the ending as a whole.     They were all really bad. Who honestly gives a fuck which was just a bit less terrible?     fucking ayy lmao out of nowhere  There was aliens since the first season dumbfuck    All were terrible, but I'd say A/Z wins for not only being retarded but having a dozen asspulls at the last 2 or 3 episodes and having 0 resolution.    A/Z was still the best of the three going into the end,     People think v3 was bad   Daily reminder that lesbo robo rapists turned out to be a better show than all of these somehow.  All of them were shit with shit endings as well. Although I guess I have to give A/Z some credit for not having a stupid fucking school setting. Vulvarape was ridiculous with that shit.    He just said that it was never fucking feasible dumbfuck because they have to make up some random douchebag in order to make it work and it was still an asspull.   They always planned to have a douchebag come in and do his shit. And the royal faction always existed. It would be plainly unrealistic, more than it already was, that there would be no challengers to the fuccboi.   Wrong. They're still haven't made it so and they're still counts on Earth, all that happened is that Hime took away her planets only valuable resource and gave it to Earth thus screwing them over.   No fucking shit? It wasn't even a distant future epilogue. Of course it's not ready. They didn't take it away, mars is the only one producing the drives/aldnoah. They literally stated they are receiving capital from the trade.    I'm not even sure what the fuck the last point is.  Try reading you butthurt faggot. He took over the clan, he gets the bad rap so Lemrina etc can go free. Plus it allows neither earth or vers to blame each other and raise tension if they get someone stuck in the middle.           It certainly didn't.  Star song duets are literally the only positive thing about this rubbish.       slainefags still salty that the retard who took over the war got blamed  Your never-ending tears are a redeeming part of the ending    I think WIXOSS' shitty ending was the most depressing bad ending I've ever seen.  The show was hype as fuck. It wasn't popular enough that its ending created a huge shitstorm which would have been fun. There were people who convinced themselves it wasn't so bad the day that it happened. And even though the show was an enormous hype machine it took none of its most intriguing plot elements anywhere.  It also showed early signs of being shitty. At least halfway into the season we were counting how long it would take for them to actually recover from the direction it had gone, and episode by episode we just started losing faith.   It's like if you fell in love with a cute girl and you found out halfway into your relationship that she secretly had terminal cancer, but had a chance of survival, but every doctor visit her chances of surviving got lower and lower until finally she died. And the only way you can go on each day is to convince yourself that it never happened, and try to forget about her.  That's how the finale of WIXOSS made me feel.            They always planned to have a douchebag come in and do his shit     It does my body good that the only people defending the ending is people who hate Slaine because it shows how pathetic they are. You don't have to be a Slainefag to see that the ending was bad.    here is your reply     They always planned to have a douchebag come in and do his shit  If you truly believe that then you are a fucking idiot.    Of course it's not ready.    So you're wrong. They didn't fix anything. Next    Plus it allows neither earth or vers to blame each other and raise tension if they get someone stuck in the middle.   So basically its a lie.             You don't need to defend the ending to enjoy your tears. Slaine got blamed for doing EVERYTHING wrong, and that was hilarious.    I watch all three, and i would say az since it have a lot potential than the other two.    You do realize you're proving his point right?     a/z   potential   I love this meme       Only thing it had potential for was to be Gundam SEED Destiny 2.0.  Instead it was actually worse.      If you truly believe that then you are a fucking idiot.  So you have no argument. This ending was always the plan.   So you're wrong. They didn't fix anything. Next  Except they fixed the whole war based on a lie and the uniersala ccess will help basically everything, in addition to dismantling the feudal system gradually.   So basically its a lie.  One lie for a greater good &gt; bunch of lies and for the sake of taking over a planet, which would make the situation even worse.            If you truly believe that then you are a fucking idiot.   Hime stopping the war by marrying a count was there from the Urobuchi outline.   So you're wrong. They didn't fix anything. Next  Stopped the war, started trade and research, currently getting the handful of counts left to fuck off. It's getting fixed.   So basically its a lie.  No one cares, and it's not even that much of a lie. Slaine was the guy fighting both sides.   I actually like Slaine and the ending is fine. It's fucking boring and predictable but it makes sense if you're not a moron.               They always had planned   Shows up announced with no prior build up in the third to last episode    planned    No fucking shit?  Then why are you saying they fixed anything when they didn't? Seems to me that you just blindly hate Slaine for some reason that you wanna believe the ending was good.   Blaming a minor for an assassination and war crimes he didn't commit without a trial   LET JUSTICE BE DONE indeed.             Laughing at deluded slainefags is entirely different from wasting time defending the writing of a bad show.    Stop posting the shitty /co/ tumblr gifs you fucking crossboarder.     Hime stopping the war by marrying a count was there from the Urobuchi outline.  No it wasn't. And what does that have to do with the show itself when he only appeared in the last two episodes?   Stopped the war  Put it on standby  started trade and research,  Only benefits the Earth   currently getting the handful of counts left to fuck off  Saw no progress  So nothing really got fixed and we're back to square one.              see<br/>    see<br/>     No argument   You're pathetic   Except they fixed the whole war based on a lie and the uniersala ccess will help basically everything, in addition to dismantling the feudal system gradually.   None of this is true. The only thing that;s happened is that Earth now has access to Aldnoah  So basically the show contradicted its own tagline. Since Justice wasn't done and everything is built on a lie. Great writing           All they had to do was introduce Klancain earlier into the story and build him up a little bit. Without that, him just appearing in the timing that he did for the end is just poor writing and a literal ass-pull.  no one can deny that.     Douchebag was never in the outline retard. The ending Urobuchi had was different and just as bad.   It didn't "stop the war" it just reset everything to how it was in the first episode. Counts are still on Earth and the only difference now is that Hime sold out her people by giving them Aldnoah  So wait Slaine assassinated the Princess and started the war?   At this point I think people are defending this to get a buzz out of people.           Are you literally retarded? They stated they are making capital from the trade, are rebuilding earth and stopped the war by locking up the leader. In addition to the fact that vers has a leader who does not hate terrans and will not spread anti-earth sentiments. And is all about amending the relationship between them. Shit has definitely changed. The research is for UNIVERSal access.    It'll still be an asspull regardless. The problem is he was literal a plot device, then again every character barring Slaine was pretty much one, that just popped up to rescue Hime and take her to where she needed to be.   the last one   They should have just had her marry darude.    None of that was actually stated.    If count only ending these three are tied but as a whole AZ is the worst of a bunch. This show is literally a borefest it's not even fun.  I hope Aniplex will do better next time.      Running out of any argument and resorting to petty insults. As expected.   None of this is true.  Great argument. Except the show stated the society is controlled by aldnoah, which is concentrated in the hands of the powerful. With this change, that will not be the case anymore. And vers will get paid for creating drives and aldnoah for earth. Justice was done regardless of consequences. Slaine got what he had to get.        Slaine was also a plot device. The difference is he acts stupidly for drama and bad things instead of good things like the other plot devices.    Vers has 0 resources besides Aldnoah. They're trading away their one thing to feed a starving population that just lost a war led by a princess who sold out her own people and nobles who still hoard the already scarce resources.  There is 0 chance Vers is in any better shape with this arrangement. In fact, they're much worse off because they're giving away their exclusive space alien bullshit military tech to their enemies.      Hey! backwards retard. The war is still going on it's just in a state it was in the first episode since they're still Counts everywhere.    Nope. The whole reason the war was started was because Terrans killed his son but he has dementia so it doesn't really matter.  Wrong again also they said in the epilogue that they're still researching it so no it wasn't as success.         Yes yes, Slaine hater. Slane is a plot device too if you say so.    They had the news anchors in the epilogue exposition on and on about all of that.     Running out of any argument and resorting to petty insults. As expected.    If you truly believe that then you are a fucking idiot.    Whelp.   Except the show stated the society is controlled by aldnoah, which is concentrated in the hands of the powerful. With this change, that will not be the case anymore. And vers will get paid for creating drives and aldnoah for earth.   Nice fanfic bro.   Justice was done   A character gets blamed for shit he didn't do   Okay                 AZ had the most disappointing ending. The first cour was mediocre, but S2 just got worse and worse and then you get that shitty ending. I want to forget GC ever existed. VVV was a masterpiece.      Fuck you for reminding me. What a shit ending to an otherwise fun show.     You are under the incorrect assumption that earth has aldnoah now. Nowhere in the entire show has this been stated. The only thing 24 says is that vers is the planet who produces it, and earth will be receiving it from them via trade. I literally have no idea where you got any of that argument from.    Hime marrying a Knight to stop the war was there from the beginning, go and read the interviews. They just hadn't decided who it was going to be.   It didn't "stop the war" it just reset everything to how it was in the first episode.  Did you just not watch the show? Everything is different. Saazbaum is dead, Vers has an active leader who doesn't hate Earth, there's trade, there's research into giving everyone Aldnoah rights.   So wait Slaine assassinated the Princess and started the war?   No but he supported the guy who did, made it possible for him to almost kill her again and kept the war going like he would have while still lying that the terrans did it.           It also showed early signs of being shitty. At least halfway into the season we were counting how long it would take for them to actually recover from the direction it had gone, and episode by episode we just started losing faith.  I started losing faith in the series sometimes in the last few episodes of the first season, when the writers expected me to be emotionally invested in Tama and her relationship with Ruuko despite giving me no good reason to be ("she's cute" isn't a good reason). Hitoe getting her memories back thanks to the power of friendship was also terrible. By the time S2 ended all I really cared about was seeing Ruuko, Yuzuki, Hitoe and a few of the other girls happy, and I got that, so I wasn't particularly disappointed by the finale.      Also wrong.    With this change, that will not be the case anymore  Yeah instead the federation which used the blood of the princess to power their weapons will have access control over it. That's a change I guess  And vers will get paid for creating drives and aldnoah for earth.  This was not stated. The only thing to get from this is Vers is giving their most precious resource to the enemy.           no good reason to be   I thought it was the way they portrayed her as being lonely and isolated and wishing she could be out in the real world. "Sorry Tama, you can't eat spaghetti." That part of the show was actually pretty well developed IMO.       You are under the incorrect assumption that earth has aldnoah now. Nowhere in the entire show has this been stated.  They literal stated that they've open a port to Earth from Vers to distribute it and researchers are now making ways to restrict the access of it. They have Aldnoah they just can't use it without Hime removing the restrictions which they are trying to undo.     The war is over.    Nope. The whole reason the war was started was because Terrans killed his son but he has dementia so it doesn't really matter.   His son was a warlord with a complex and had to be killed. The new eladership is all about fixing the relationship, not damaging it.    Wrong again also they said in the epilogue that they're still researching it so no it wasn't as success.  Nowhere did they say it was experiencing any difficulty. Have no fear, it will happen. It's like this is your first anime.             Vers isn't trading Aldnoah.   They're just trading Aldnoah.   What?        This was not stated. The only thing to get from this is Vers is giving their most precious resource to the enemy.  This is like talking to a brick wall, people keep posting valid arguments and you're just going NO IT WON'T WORK IT'S NOT LIKE MY FANFIC. Watch the last episode, this shit is stated right there for everyone to see.      Hime marrying a Knight to stop the war was there from the beginning,  Nope.    Everything is different   Counts are still on Earth   Military is still active   different   Right.    No but he supported the guy who did   He didn't support the assasination nor the war, he's a soldier.    made it possible for him to almost kill her again    And this is also wrong   and kept the war going like he would have while still lying that the terrans did it.   He can't stop the war neither is in in his jurisdiction to do so.  Also all these points are irrelevant since the charges he got put on against weren't the points you listed so you lose again.                            They literal stated that they've open a port to Earth from Vers to distribute it    They have Aldnoah they just can't use it without Hime removing the restrictions which they are trying to undo.  What the fuck are you saying? NONE of this was stated. Vers is who has aldoah. Not earth. Holy shit. Lett me try it in a way you can understand.  Mars = aldnoah Earth = no aldnoah Earth gets the aldnoah from mars. Mars did not "give away" shit.             people keep posting valid arguments   people  YOU have not made a single valid argument. YOU are just a demented Slaine hater defending a bad ending to piss people off but it doesn't seem to be working much at all since all you've been doing is posting bullshit and getting called out for it. You need to try harder.   War ain't over. Even stated in the epilogue that they're still Counts on Earth and the military is still active.    His son was a warlord with a complex and had to be killed   That has shit to do with anything. You are wrong, the Emperor did hated Terrans he's just mentally ill.    Nowhere did they say it was experiencing any difficulty  Wrong again. They have not lifted they restriction on it.                They're giving away the most advanced military tech to ever exist to Earth for food and water because Vers was already stated to be incapable of sustaining its own population without conquest. It's completely unfavorable trade to Vers in every single way.  Earth already knows how to activate it since they've been using Hime's blood to power the Ducalion.      You may want to re-read those posts    Another planet is colonized 30 years ago   People who live there develop intense xenophobia towards Earth and act like being from Earth is a disease   I'm supposed to accept this premise as plausible?  Clumsy worldbuilding. All they needed was to give the Martians more time away from Earth and a longer history and this wouldn't be an issue, which leads me to believe the people writing were too stupid to even think of it.  Maybe this is why Urobuchi sold the project to someone else.           Nope.   It was in Butcher's outline, which is a part they kept.   Right.   Lets see.  Martian leader is not a war monger   wants to work with earth   making aldnoah universal   there is no longer any war   clan leader behind it is gone     He didn't support the assasination nor the war, he's a soldier.    Slainefags please. He was a commander. He took over the war effort and lead it himself. He isn't any mere solider who didn't know he was being lied to.  I can't believe how fucking idiotic you are.                    What? No where in those posts did they say that Earth is producing Aldnoah. They have Aldnoah because Vers gave it to them.   Valvrave  all those hundreds of years in the future flashforwards   winds up being fucking nothing      They are not giving it away you mongoloid. I don't know how else to get through to you on this fact. I don't know what fanfic you got the idea from, but I suggest you watch the show instead.    Sold it? He was responsible for most of it and his concepts were just as retarded. The only thing you can't pin Urobuchi on were the characters.    Of course those posts didn't state it. The show stated VERS is producing aldnoah. Those posters have some delusion that they somehow "gave" aldnoah to earth.     It was in Butcher's outline  It wasn't.    making aldnoah universal   there is no longer any war   So 2 out 4.   No argument   Jesus fuck you Slaine haters are pathetic              Valvrave was the best and had the best ending. Guilty Crown ending did not matter since whole later part of the show was a mess. A/Z ending was all kinds of disappointing so this one.      nearly four years since Guilty Crown aired   over two since Valvrave started      Of course those posts didn't state it.    They literal stated that they've open a port to Earth from Vers to distribute it    open a port to Earth from Vers to distribute it   DISTRIBUTE IT         Yes they are trading it, I know how trade fucking works. But it's UNFAVORABLE because they're giving away the most powerful military tech in the universe for simple resources to the planet that fucking hates them.  Would you give a loaded gun to your sworn enemy so you could eat for a day? You think that would work out for you?     <br/>   I LIKE Slaine, you moron. But I didn't want him to "win" and kill everybody so I guess that makes me a Slaine hater to you edgelord idiots who worship your fanfic idea of Slaine. The ending is boring but decent and the best that Slaine could have gotten without a real asspull.     a bloo bloo anyone not catering to my nonsense is a slaine hater!  Kill yourself, you damn baby.   War ain't over. Even stated in the epilogue that they're still Counts on Earth and the military is still active.   Do you think the military just disappears after a war ends? Everyone gets a new job or some shit? It's clearly peace time, hence the goodwill gifts and citizenry walking about. Nowhere is it stated the counts are doing anything. They even stated the empress is negotiating, not fighting them. They clearly are not hostile.   That has shit to do with anything. You are wrong, the Emperor did hated Terrans he's just mentally ill.   Uh, yes? The previous leader ship hated terrans. The current leader does not. The fact that such a person is making moves to help the relationship between earth and mars is a huge step up.    Wrong again. They have not lifted they restriction on it.  What are you even saying?              Monster, by far     Slaine haters hate him so much that they want to rewrite the show with their fanfiction      The ending is boring but decent   decent   So pretty much just people with shit taste thought this.       You realize that    open a port to Earth from Vers to distribute it  Was never stated in the show?       Do you think the military just disappears after a war ends? Everyone gets a new job or some shit? It's clearly peace time, hence the goodwill gifts and citizenry walking about. Nowhere is it stated the counts are doing anything. They even stated the empress is negotiating, not fighting them. They clearly are not hostile.  The last time a war ended a bunch of Orbital Knights just hung around in low orbit and started the next one. You think that's gonna change?   Uh, yes? The previous leader ship hated terrans. The current leader does not. The fact that such a person is making moves to help the relationship between earth and mars is a huge step up.  The previous leader was being played by the Knights since day one to begin the war, not necessarily because he hated Earth. And they're still in power since Slaine's revolution failed.        OP ask which is the worst   Circle jerk about AZ   Truly the worst fanbase. AZfags ruin everything.       Slaine raped my mother so I hate him for life   Geez fag get it life. What do you get out of hating a fictional character    It's clearly peace time   Yeah just forget the fact that the military is on standby and the Counts are still active. Are you really this retard? War doesn't fucking end in a day.    Uh, yes?   So you admit you were wrong. Moving on  How about you actually watch the ending?   It was, you grabbing a random screenshot doesn't prove anything.                    But it's UNFAVORABLE because speculation   It's for the sake of capital and resources, which mars is in dire need of. What would be better? Conquering earth? Continuing to be sour racists and reject making amends? There is no perfect solution to this issue. And stop saying they are giving it away when it's clearly said to be trade.       circlejerk   one fag defending the ending because he hates Slaine   Everyone points out how stupid he is   circlejerk   Okay         Hey I mean they solved the conflict and it makes sense and it didn't end with aliens dropping from the sky at the last minute. It was still a simple boring ending that everyone should have seen coming.    Okay anon, let me see this shot wherein they state they made a "port" to earth and vers to distribute aldnoah.    But A/Z fanbase is obnoxious no matter what. Even worst: composed by BL faggots.     It's for the sake of capital and resources, which mars is in dire need of   Giving away their most precious resource is gonna fix their fedual system and not live their own planet to shambles   It's like. It's like everything Saaz said would happen happened.        The last time a war ended a bunch of Orbital Knights just hung around in low orbit and started the next one. You think that's gonna change?   Glad you realize that military doesn't poof into thin air. I wondered what you think Darzana should be doing in the epilogue.The orbital knights did not start the next one. One dude did, and in the end he was the only count involved. The situation is remarkably different, because the monarch is not an old fart who hates earth and will encourage them to do so as well. And the fact that the relationship between them is getting better.       one  Slainefags are this deluded     Conquest would most certainly be a better arrangement for Vers instead of trading their sole resource and military advantage to their enemies. Earth's got such a wealth of these resources. They're trading wheat, corn, grain and water for WMDs they never had access to previously that has proved to completely change the balance of power. How does that not make Earth incredibly more well-off and put Vers in a bad position?    So you're just talking out your ass then.    It's actually pretty fascinating. Some fans of slaine have this idea of the ending in their heads that they can't realize is entirely false.     Since Hime loves Earth it means all of teh Orbital Knights will follow suit   You're a fucking idiot especially after the last episode showed otherwise.       The Knights didn't start the next war.  Are you shitting me? Sauzbaum set up the assassination attempt and was conspiring with all the knights who sent in their landing castles first. How the FUCK did that not start the war?    Aldnoah was complete and utter garbage and the only show among those three that didn't entertain me in slightest   What's more fascinating is the people who defend the ending are just doing so because they hate the character when people have stood up and explain what's wrong with the ending every time.     giving away   giving away   giving away  You are a broken record. They will be receiving capital in exchange for producing alnodah for earth. The fuedal system can't go one when access to aldnoah is universal.       That would be you, who has nothing but fanfics.    No matter what fanfic you write its not gonna change the fact that they're giving them away.     The fuedal system can't go one when access to aldnoah is universal.   Hey, retard. Access to Aldnoah won't be universal, the feudal system will still exist.        Only Saazbaum, Trillram, those spies and Saazbaum's grunts knew the plan. The others thought the terrans killed the princess.     The fuedal system can't go one when access to aldnoah is universal.  The show doesn't say anything about this shit, hell they haven't even lift the fucking restriction. All we know is that they gave away their resource to Earth and that's it.     Conquest would never work, because earth would never give in to the conquerors. You'd have generations of war and guerrilla warfare. There wouldn't be peace for either side unless you genocide.    The feudal system only existed because the Emperor allowed access to Aldnoah to only a select few individuals. The nation of Vers is completely dominated by exclusivity to Aldnoah, which they are trading to their enemies. It cannot exist under such circumstances.    Nice fanfic retard.    Saaz never said that. He said aldnoah controls the society. With universal aldnoah, this will no longer be the case. Though I suspect only royals will still have the "special" access.    The only reason it wouldn't work is because of Inaho, as we've seen for two straight seasons. Earth got fucking rekt in every battle Inaho was not part of.     The nation of Vers is completely dominated by exclusivity to Aldnoah, which they are trading to their enemies. It cannot exist under such circumstances.  Are you retarded? They're giving Aldnoah to Earth doesn't change the standing on Vers dumbass.   He did dumbass.       I. DON'T. HATE. SLAINE. YOU DUMB FUCKER. I like Slaine. He did dumb things and went nuts for a while but I sympathize and want him to move on and be happy again and all that shit.  I'm still going to correct your stupid ass claims that something happened when the show tells you it didn't.       Saaz never said that.  His conversation with Slaine in the second episode of S2. He pretty much said that just conquering Earth wouldn't fix Vers problems and this distribution system they have in the epilogue won't do anything since it doesn't benefit Vers at all.    They actually held back Vers according to what was stated in S2.        Certainly not GC.  Heil Shoe!       He did dumb things and went nuts for a while  Jesus fuck you're a retard.      So, the plan you gave in mind is for martians to win and genocide the terrans? Okay. But earth did hold back quite well between seasons. Going as far as to obtain landing castles.     It's just a few retards. I'm pretty sure everyone agrees that the ending was terrible whether you are a Slainefag or not just due to the abundant amount of inconsistencies it has.    You are still on about this restriction and no one has any idea what you are talking about What we know is that they are trading something only mars can give for capital, not the bullshit you type out     You know what I mean. He did more and more things he didn't really want to do because it felt to him like he couldn't do anything else. He snapped out of it when he realized there was another option.    I think the show was terrible, but only slainefags seems to have illusions it was good before the end and expected some retarded fanfic from the ending.   Why did the vampire illuminati attack the module in valvrave?    You are still on about this restriction  Only Royalty can use Aldnoah dumbass. They said in the epilogue that researchers are looking to remove it so anyone can use it.     Except the only thing you explain are things that did not happen. Hell, I'm still waiting for this anon to get an answer  I don't even hate Slaine. His fans are intolerable.     So you didn't watch the last episode   The ending wasn't any worse than the rest of it. It sure as fuck wasn't a great show with a bad ending, more like an ok show with an ok ending. It was just nowhere near what the hype promised.    Except the only thing you explain are things that did not happen  So Vers didn't give away Aldnoah to Earth is what you're saying? Okay     Wrong on all accounts did again people who consider this ok have never watched anything bad in their lives.    Then fucking say that. And you're wrong. Anyone can use alndoah once it's granted to them. The research makes it easier.     Anyone can use alndoah once it's granted to them.  Wrong again dumbass.      So Vers didn't give away Aldnoah to Earth is what you're saying? Okay  How are you this dumb? They GIVE Aldnoah RIGHTS to everyone. They SELL Aldnoah or Aldnoah drives to Earth. Did you watch some shitty subs that no one else did?     So that means its neither universal and there's a restriction on it.     So Vers didn't give away Aldnoah to Earth is what you're saying? Okay   Indeed, the are initiating trade.      hey GIVE Aldnoah RIGHTS to everyone. They SELL Aldnoah or Aldnoah drives to Earth.  Neither of this is true. Stop psushing your stupid fanfic on others     Vers can't give away rights nor did they say they were selling them.    Holy fuck it tells you this in the fucking show. Watch the epilogue until it gets through to you.     Let me helping you understand the anon. Here is what is stated in the show.  Try watching it again to refresh your memory. They are making the rights universal. They state that mars, the planet that produces aldnoah, will trade for capital to help with rebuilding.      Who says? A/Z was a show with a terrible premise, that had a equally bad execution. They show was shit from the start, people try to claim that A/Z was alright in their first cour, are delusional. It was just as boring, nothing but predictable mecha battles and lack luster character interactions. The second cour was even worse, but had the added benefit of being absolutely pointless. There was no consequences for the heroes, and the villains are made to look incompetent just so the heroes can win.   A/Z had a bad ending for a bad show.      They tell you there's research into letting anyone use Aldnoah. Watch the show.      Nowhere in the screencap is neither of that stated    So what you were typing all along was fanfiction      *The      is still ongoing   Kept saying throughout the fucking thread that it already happend and still saying so in the fucking post   Nothing was stated in the actual screencap   You're done. Figures people who defends a bad ending are trolls.            and the villains are made to look incompetent just so the heroes can win.    You mean "the other heroes bar Eggs AND the villains are made to look incompetent just so Eggs can win". They didn't really need to have Inaho multibox all the UFE suits to prove the point but boy did it drive it home hard.         arguing about the show without watching it  I think slainefags may have circlejerked in fanficville for too long.        Aldnoah rights are universal now! Really they are!     Now you're nitpicking when it's going to be done exactly which was never the point in the first place? The point is Vers isn't giving away shit, the plan is to give rights to everyone but sell the thing they're used for, so this benefits (or will benefit if you're going to flip a shit over tenses) both sides, not just Earth.    Considering it only took 15 years for them to develop KATs, them finding out how to crack the code won't take that long, especially since they aren't starting from scratch.    Let me get this straight, you  think you're talking to the same people   making incorrect assumptions   arguing semantics  You are trying to find holes where there are none.         The point is Vers isn't giving away shit,  They are,    the plan is to give rights to everyone   On Earth   but sell the thing they're used for, so this benefits (or will benefit if you're going to flip a shit over tenses) both sides, not just Earth.   Wrong again.     DAT BACKPEDALING                   They are,  They're not giving away Aldnoah. They're selling it.   On Earth  According to what, your fanfic again?   Wrong again.  Watch. the. fucking. show.            They are,  It's for capital and resources. Mars is the only one who can produce aldnoah. Earth cannot have it without them.   On Earth  Universal. So "anyone" can use it. Nowhere did they state it was exclusive to earth.   Wrong again.  Get an argument. They aren't giving it away, so drop that pathetic line.              Makes a stupid claim   People point out your claim is stupid and not in the show   Prove yourself wrong   Trying to play the fool   This is what happens when you defend bad endings.            They're not giving away Aldnoah  They are   According to what   The fucking shit. Nowhere in the epilogue did they say anything about making it free to everyone on Vers just Earth   Watch. the. fucking. show.   No thanks. How about you admit you were wrong and stop being a baby over it.             So let me get this straight, you got triggered over tenses, but understand the fact that aldnoah rights are going to become universal. You can accept that much is actually canon. That's progress.    I know right, at least with the other shows the sources of the world's problems were solved (in GC, the virus was destroyed along with the organization subjugating Japan; in Valvrave at least the space vampires were all wiped out) but in Aldnoah.Zero, Mars is still a fascist autocracy with a massive class gap and a culture that revolves around racism and a lot of their nobles are occupying Earth territories. We didn't even find out whether the Emperor genuinely believed that Earthlings were inferior, wanted peace, or raised his people to hate earthlings in order to deflect blame from himself.   The fact that Gen Urobuchi was only wrote the show's general outline and only had a large amount of influence on the first few episodes really shows. Aldnoah.Zero had a really strong opening. The other two shows, while they had great production values, had openings riddled with cliches and overused tropes. Adlnoah.Zero at least looked like it was going to be unique.      So they're giving it away,    Universal. So "anyone" can use it.   Wrong again dumbfuck also    CR   Get better subs if you're going to make an argument.   Get an argument   Watch the show. They are giving it away, just because it doesn't support your fanfic doesn't make it any less true,                I can't even tell if you're trolling or not. If this was any other show I'd have assumed troll by now but this being A/Z there's a good chance you believe everything you're saying.     Aldnoah.Zero had a really strong opening.  I see we have people who are this delusional     This is what happens when you try to explain shit to deluded idiots like yourself, who are too buttblasted about boypussy to be even partially rational.     No arguement    Whelp     For the last fucking time. THEY DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT VERS HAVING FREE ALDNOAH RIGHTS IN THE EPLOGUE ONLY EARTH YOU DUMBASSES              Not the same anon  This is actually my first post on the topic, I don't agree with other anon in saying that the rights are universal, NOW. I'm only pointing out that that it will be in the future and because of how technologically savvy UFE is probably during Asshime's lifetime.        So they're giving it away,   Trading. Keep trying, if it keeps you sane I guess.   Wrong again dumbfuck also   Let me see your superior translation anon-sama.   Watch the show. They are giving it away, just because it doesn't support your fanfic doesn't make it any less true,   Still waiting for an argument. Ss the whole line about them trading for capital incorrect as well?   Please educate us.              Come on, the Martian castle drop was a really strong scene.    You're not really explaining anything just defending a universally panned ending because you hate a fictional character which is quite pathetic    I don't think anyone said they were universal when the show ended, the argument is that in the plan that's starting to be implemented Vers will give Earth rights but sell the actual resource.    They literally never stated anything but it being only for earth. It is you, who are assuming it for fanfic tumblr ranting, that it is.    Why do people keep posting this when its been known for the longest that people can turn this function off ?   A.Z because it was at times a good show.   Just because I'm am explaining how wrong you are, does not mean I like the ending.    This is why I don't take the whole "Earth is struggling" narrative seriously since the only Earthlings we really get to see is Deucalion and they're having caviar on the beach. Compare that to White Base in Gundam or hell even the ArchAngel in Gundam Seed. I bought the narrative about them struggling because we saw them actually struggle. I couldn't give a shit about the characters.     Trading.  Giving away. Sorry kid your fanfic will never come to fruition   Let me see your superior translation anon-sama.   So you admit you've been watching a shit translation?   Still waiting for an argument   A person who has not made an argument is waiting for one that's already been presented? Hilarious!             You haven't explained anything  Actually they did. The shit you're spouting is nothing but fanfiction       This is why I don't take the whole "Earth is struggling" narrative seriously since the only Earthlings we really get to see is Deucalion and they're having caviar on the beach   That scene is what convinced me that the show was only going to go downhill. Shouldn't earth society be on the verge of collapse? Communication dismantled, most major urban centers had been turned into crater fields, and the entire earth army only has one unit that can really make a difference in battle. And that's how they spend their time?      All things considered, Earth Side also has the Aldnoah drives from the captured castles and KATs that dropped to Earth during the second war. So it isn't a stretch to say that Earth won't need Vers for Aldnoah anymore in the future, and so won't cut them off, especially if they have enough drives.  However it is wrong to pretend that the future is now.      will cut them off    So you LITERALLY didn't watch the same show as everyone else? You should share this thing so we can all marvel at this alternate version that matches your tumblr rants.     Giving away.  The burden of proving this is on you. Here is the screenshot which states they will earn capital from trading aldnoah. Let me see what you have to counter it.   So you admit you've been watching a shit translation?  So you admit you have no point and are stalling for time to lead the argument elsewhere? Give us your so-called correct translation.   A person who has not made an argument is waiting for one that's already been presented? Hilarious!  Yes, anon. Still waiting. I'll give you a chance to stop dancing around the topic one more time.            because it was at times a good show.     Man, what the fuck was up with the staff of GC? I have yet to see a character get the short of of the stick like Shoe did aside from Shinji, fucker lost his eyesight,arm, waifu, his sanity and his childhood friend, was hated by damn nearly everyone, backstabbed by his dear friends, stalked by his psycho sister who became a elderitch horror and the guy he looked up to. It's like they were going on a checklist on how to make his as miserable as possible, what the fuck man      Here is the screenshot which states they will earn capital from trading aldnoah  The screencap says nothing of the sort  Strike one!   So you admit you have no point and are stalling for time to lead the argument elsewhere?   Still using CR   Strike two!   Still no argument   And strike three!  The only loser in this debacle is you since apparently you had to re-downlaod the last episode like a fucking jackass.                  It's quite a stretch, because it is in both of their interests to maintain peace. Earth wants to build industry and rebuild with aldnoah. They will need vers as they are the only ones who produce it.     N-n-n-n-n-n-no U!   Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-ou didn't watch the show   You sure told me!       Aldnoah tried to be Gundam but failed hard, because it didn't understand the definition of the word "struggle", it makes it worse when the MC never has to face the consequences of the shit he pulls.    It's finally gotten to the point where someone shoves fucking screencaps at you and you insist that they're not saying what they're saying.     The screencap says nothing of the sort  You really are good at jokes. What does "an effective means to earn foreign capital" mean to you?    still no argument  Why do you insist on not actual making a single point? If the translation is wrong, why don't you clear it up? Let me guess, you're full of shit.        bottom ending was good, it's what was before it to be disappointing      Here is the screenshot which states they will earn capital from trading aldnoah   Now where in the screencap does it say that?     Daily Reminder How Long We Have Waited For Hero Like Inaho   No cringe-worthy eeehehh!? reactions   No drama queen, no crying out loud like shounenshit   Calm, intelligent, reliable, highly competent pilot   Brave enough take up arms for his beloved ones   No 'I can't fight b-because muh peace' shit   He is literally the MC we've all wanted for so long. Yet so many /a/nons never spamming bullshit autism and stupid le egg meme. If you all you can understand is crybaby shounenshit MCs, fine; please go and watch Naruto and never come back.            someone literally posts a screencap   I-it's wrong!   this is the entire argument   Someone should post a damn webm at this rate to see slainefags deny it       Reminder that Slaine got a better ending than both Haruto and Shoe.   Oh, I dunno, in the fucking subtitles? The white text at the bottom. You can do this, anon. I believe in you.     Rotting in jail?      bottom ending was good  I love this meme     Not really. Inaho got a god end, though.    Fuck it, you know what, I love this meme. Thanks, anon.   VVV S1 &gt; GC &gt; A/Z S1 &gt; VVV S2 &gt; A/Z S2   Inaho is mai waifu.    God, good, same thing in this case.       Here is the screenshot which states they will earn capital from trading aldnoah   Where does it say it?         So Slaine haters are blind with rage that they can't even see subtitles?    A.Z, because you could skip from episode 1 to the last without missing a single important event, it is like what happens in between was completely irrelevant.    "an effective means to earn foreign capital"  Not they will earn capital from trading aldnoah that's for sure   Why do you insist on not actual making a single point?    I've been asking you this for a while now.        These all could've been okay to maybe good shows if they had character development worth a damn. Something about that golden Aniplex touch turns all the characters into unchanging cardboard cutouts.   Not really, trade can really only be maintained so long as both sides have something the other wants. With Earth its Aldnoah and with Vers its resources, so long as both side sides want what the other has they have trade. However, there are two things needed for Aldnoah to work, a drive and permission from the royal family of Vers. If Earth gets enough Aldnoah drives (which they'll probably buy by the truck load) then they'll all they'll need is the permission from Asshime. Once universal rights are achieved then they'll no longer need Asshime, and there might be a window of them continuing to buy drives but that's also limited, because they only need to buy it once, since they don't become obsolete. Then when they don't need that anymore then their reason to trade with Vers will end. But on Vers will still need the resources, so this might result in the price of resources going up and Vers eventually running out of money, which will result in Earth pulling the plug.  Vers side still has racists counts, even worse because of how the princess went about achieving peace, they'll think that their racism is justified. Not only that but they'll also be dependent on Earth for resources, them being as prideful their entire reason for listening to Asshime is that she can give away Aldnoah rights, but rights being universal means that the rights won't be universal anymore. Therefore letting go of any reason they have to listen to her.  On Earthside the only thing that Vers had over the UFE was Aldnoah, and if they have enough Aldnoah to power their suits. They also have a great advantage over Vers with their numbers, which will probably experience a baby boom after the war. There's also the fact that UFE still may not view Vers as a trust worthy ally, like they did after Heaven's Fall. Remember there was really only 21 years between WWI and WWII. and 15 years between their two wars.  The next war would be a war over resources.           Not they will earn capital from trading aldnoah that's for sure   Not him but what will they earn the capital from, then? Hookers?      After the shit he's been through that's like a vacation to him. And he's still alive and well unlike Shoe and Haruto.   I think I'll marathon all three.   Giving away their most valuable resource to the enemy    How about not being dead physically and mentally?     Not they will earn capital from trading aldnoah that's for sure  I didn't know mars had other resources to trade. Fascinating.   I've been asking you this for a while now.  I can't understand why. You claim the translation is inaccurate, yet do not want to correct it. You've yet to say anything but should "nuh-uh!" to anything anyone posts.        Most of the things Vers needs are one time only though. They can recycle water and just buy seeds and live animals. They can also build things other than castles and kats and sell those.     I didn't know mars had other resources to trade. Fascinating.  An effective means for Vers to earn foreign capital sure does mean the same thing has earn capital from trading aldnoah.    You claim the translation is inaccurate, yet do not want to correct it   You're using a source that frequently used ti point out bad translations and playing the fool because you don't want to download the episode again.         They can't, you need to have fertile land to make things grow, and Mars doesn't have fertile land you need to have a abundance of water to feed animals, they barely have enough ground water for themselves. Yes you can recycle water but you need to have an abundance of it to be able to do it, and they don't have that.    All wrong. Good to see the people who defend the ending are just stupid Slaine fags    Vers lives underground because atmosphere is bad and its ground is infertile as Sauce stated    They can just buy it. Since they have a monopoly, they can buy as much water or soil or whatever they fucking want for it.     Funny because Sauce himself said this wouldn't change anything. It's like the retards defending it are just buying into Hime's retarded philosophy,   You're an idiot.        You can't buy fertile land or a breathable atmosphere. Yes you can buy water, but you are limited in the amount that you can get, and you can't buy ground water.    The ending stated they will be buying aldnoah itself, in order for it to be a recurring trade, it definitely isn't simply going to be two things. Mars is the only ones who produce aldnoah powered goods which earth needs for reconstruction. It is in both of their interests to maintain the peace. They had resource wars twice and they ended horribly. Now that they are actually engaging in trade, there will be no more need for it.    They have space magic that creates gravity, maybe now that they can research stuff other than how to make kats stronger it will dawn on them that they can use Aldnoah to actually fix their shit.  Sauce only knew how things were when every resource and research effort went into the war. Gil wanted Mars to keep sucking so that they had a reason to hate Earth.       Mars is the only ones who produce aldnoah powered goods which earth needs for reconstruction  Earth doesn't need Aldnoah for reconstruction retard.      An effective means for Vers to earn foreign capital sure does mean the same thing has earn capital from trading aldnoah.   What exactly do you think they are referring to? This anon posted the previous line  It's about aldnoah. That's what the capital will be earned from.   You're using a source that frequently used ti point out bad translations and playing the fool because you don't want to download the episode again.  So you got nothing to prove the translation is wrong but "get a better one". Fuck, man. Don't do this yourself.         We've already been stated what is needed for Aldnoah to work, a drive and permission from the royal family. Drives don't become obsolete and they eventually won't need Asshime.   They tried to Terraform and it didn't work.       That's not even from the same fucking scene nor sentence. Jesus you keep failing and don't even know when to quit.   So you're just gonna play the fool and gonna pretend that the translation is accurate without proving it to be so? Kay      As we've seen in the landing castles, they very well have the means to construct things that can house plants in them. The problem is that it's all concentrated in the hands of the wealthy. They can build domes/shelters/gardens etcs for animals and vegetation.  With aldnoah rights becoming universal, the concentration of wealth will no longer be an issue.     Saazbaum isn't exactly the most impartial observer. Much like Slaine he wanted to think there was no way anything could get better and of course his only path was to kill the people he already hated. It's all optimism vs pessimism. I don't think it's that weird to think you could fix a planet when you could trade for some resources and use your ancient space magic for others.     Saazbaum isn't exactly the most impartial observer.   Everything he has said thus far has been right   The situation from Vers isn't fixed at all and their current outlet won't benefit them.   You're basically making fanfiction at this point.         With aldnoah rights becoming universal  It's the same retard guise. Just ignore him.    An ending is mostly disappointing if the anime itself was great.   The burden of proving it's inaccuracy is you, once you've made the claim. Either state your issue or fuck off already.   That's not even from the same fucking scene nor sentence.   You sure convinced me.        The burden of proving it's inaccuracy is you  No it's on you since your're the one that's fughting the claim in itself.    No U   Great argument         Of course earth does not need it. But they are trading anyway. Know why? Because they are interested in peace and speedy reconstruction. They kind of like not having war.    Didn't they also mention that that shit was fake? Also being able to house an small garden in an enclosed area is very different from being able to house a full crops, do you know the amount resources actually needed to care for animals?  Your idea doesn't effect the lower class since the only people with access to that technology is the upper crust, who have no reason to pass it out to the lower class. So yes it would still be an issue.      Did you know what a capital is?     Didn't they also mention that that shit was fake?  Yep. Not sure why people still think universal Aldnoah usage, which is never stated to be a thing on Vers, will change the issue or you're just buying into Hime's bullshit because you hate Slaine at this point.     You'd be confused as to why eggs is now big boss and how slaine got cucked by a mini-cruhton    Wasn't stated multiple times that the only thing that made the Vers side stronger was their Aldnoah powered KATS? Seems like that's a good enough reason for UFE to want to trade for now.     Because they are interested in peace and speedy reconstruction.   They are hording Aldnoah drives for military strength and used Hime's blood to power thier weapons   Why you are fucking delusional?       Since you keep running around in circles, I will direct you here  Prove what is stated here is incorrect.     Your second greentext is literally a fanfic, and you call others delusional?    Since you keep running around in circles I will direct you here  Where does it state that they will earn capital from trading Aldnoah?      literally a fanfic   It actually happened in show   Okay        &gt;They are hording Aldnoah drives for military strength and used Hime's blood to power thier weapons  No. Dorito said he had the garden made for her. If vers can have gravity defying laser mechs, they can build constructions on a far larger scale for flora and fauna. The capital they are going to make from helping earth rebuild will assist with all of that.      Because they are interested in peace and speedy reconstruction.  Nice fanfiction     I still want to see this mysterious show you keep talking about.    Literally fanfiction    Tell me at what point they turned anything on with Hime's blood, other than what Eggboy did.    It's called Aldnoah Zero. It happened in the show but you were too busy raging at Slaine to think straight.   Big O.   It's from tumblr.     Tell me at what point they turned anything on with Hime's blood  That captain literally told Inaho that's what they used it for and he got angry over it. Why the fuck do you retards think the Earth forces are free from any wrong doings?     Read the question. At what point did they activate anything with her blood? Tell me, anon. Other than Inaho, where did it work?  Where did anyone say earth did nothing wrong? Do you read what people post or just have some persecution complex?    Vers has never in its history had all of the following:  research into terraforming   enough people with Aldnoah rights to help with the above   political will to do this   a way to get any resources that they don't already have but Earth does  Maybe now that they do they can at least give it another go.         Gets proven wrong   Wasting space with arbitrary questions because he was too busy raging over Slaine to pay attention    No wonder you think the ending was good.        Nice fanfiction    Terrans really seemed mad about not being at war at the end, didn't they? If only Slaine-sama were here to ruin their lives some more.   Anyone who doesn't say A/Z needs their head checking.   Wah Slaine will be reborn into a pure nice man.   Faggot only loses his eye despite being the most OP shit ever.  What a fucking joke.      Why do you guys care what happens afterwards? Assshit will bend the way of the world / plot to her wills. No way in hell anything bad will happen to Vers and Earth.   Is it that hard to understand that some of us don't hate Slaine at all but can still read the words on the screen and know that you're whining about shit that never happened?     Gets proven wrong  Whoa, you have the tharsis? Have you seen into some alternate future where everything is the opposite of right now?      Terrans really seemed mad about not being at war at the end, didn't they?  Who would be mad when you got your enemy's most valuable resources to power more KATS and military weapons thanks to the retarded Princess.      never happened   So you're just retarded? Got it! Though that's no different from being a Slaine hater at this point.    And here comes the delusion.        GC was already bad but fucking Shu over like that was over the line.  Should have at least had him die with Inori.     When the ayylmaos return and are none too pleased about a bunch of filthy mon'keighs breaking in and fingering all their stuff it'll matter.    They were both insufferable characters who got what they deserve. I love the fact that Inori essentially drove him insane during the Shuher arc and yet we're suppose to feel sorry for them.    Or maybe they enjoy not being at war and being able to rebuild their world from the shitton of lies and propaganda that caused all the destruction and deaths.    First of all you never quoted me, second of all nice fanfic. They said that the garden was fake.   Also they already said that they tried to use the technolgoy to improve Mars and it didn't work.      Finally someone gets it. All this obsessing over minor shit is ridiculous.     and being able to rebuild their world from the shitton of lies and propaganda that caused all the destruction and deaths.  By making a shitton of lies and propaganda themselves.     They already knew what was happening the moment the empress declared peace and Slaine tried to kill himself.     because the UFE wasn't shown to be corrupt at all.   Just like there weren't any wars after WWII.       Or maybe they enjoy not being at war and being able to rebuild their world from the shitton of lies and propaganda that caused all the destruction and deaths.  And blaming an entire war on a minor.     Nice fanfiction    A/Z     They said that the garden was fake.    Here is what Dorito said. Let me see the scene wherein it was stated to all be fake.   Also they already said that they tried to use the technolgoy to improve Mars and it didn't work.  That was when they barely had enough due to the war shit. Now, they will, with opened trade for the first time ever. Mars has never received adequate resources form earth before.        I refuse to believe we won't ever be able to make fucking Mars livable. And if we had alien space magic to work with? This shit is going to get done.     Nothing about it being authentic  Whelp. Also looks like you had to download another episode from HS.     The only lie is about Slaine, who put himself in the position to clan leader and commander of the war. And also made HIMSELF some "not of vers" but "not of earth" either.      Nice fanfiction      And how is that proving your point, it doesn't say that the garden was authentic.   That was when they barely had enough due to the war shit. Now, they will, with opened trade for the first time ever. Mars has never received adequate resources form earth before.  That was before the war dumbass.    Well they've tried and they've failed,            muh slaine didn't no nothing wrong!   A minor who continued the war of lies and put himself in the center of it, knowing the entire truth of it. Holy shit you people are nuts.        The only lie is about Slaine  Nope. The federation has a history to lies and propaganda just through the timeline alone.    who put himself in the position to clan leader and commander of the war.    Wrong again.         Book said Mary wouldn't have allowed those flowers there because things from Earth are dirty or something. Sounds like the flowers were real.     racists counts find anything from one place that they're racist against is dirty.     Well he didn't start the war nor attempted to assassinate the princess which are the charges he is put under both of which are lies. Also he's not in jurisdiction to stop the war at all. I'm not sure why Slaine haters believe that war is such a simple thing to stop or that it can be carried out by a single person but once again hatred breeds stupidity.     Book said Mary wouldn't have allowed those flowers there because things from Earth are dirty or something  Book is also a fucking idiot. So I don't see how that proves anything.      The flowers on Troyard's castle are real. Do you got any other excuses?      continued the war  He can't stop the war sweetie    and put himself in the center of it   Nope they just blamed him for it because he was the only one left.          Book   Alright so they're fake. Moving on.      All that's saying is that the Mary detested all things Terran, nothing in there is proving your point.    It's very possible as mars is in a much better position for growth now that they have trade.    That was before the war dumbass.   What? I am talking about now, this is the first time mars and earth are trading resources.        Dorito also calls them terran flowers.    And again how is that proving your point?    Nice fanfic    This one.     his childhood friend  Who gives a fuck about that faggot Gay     Simply not starting it doesn't not mean he can't be held accountable WHEN HE KILLED THE DUDE THAT DID. And then continued it.     Nope they just blamed him for it because he was the only one left.  Oh yeah, Slaine definitely did not form an eathspace faction and command them to attack UEF bases. He was not the boss. Nope. "He couldn't stop it" doesn't mean shit. It's still his responsibility once he killed Saazbaum and took all his shit.         In order for Mars to grow the planet itself would need to be able to enable sustainable living. The planet itself cannot support the Versians. Terraforming it doesn't work, and any solution involving trade is only temporary.     Simply not starting it doesn't not mean he can't be held accountable WHEN HE KILLED THE DUDE THAT DID  Actually he can't. Did you fail law school or want to continue on this charade? He can't be held accountable for Saaz actions especially when there's no evidence to support it and once again HE CAN'T STOP THE FUCKING WAR SINCE THE EMPEROR WITH DEMENTIA GAVE THE CALL YEARS PRIOR.     Shit like this exists right now. There is no reason mars, as technologically advanced as it is, now with resources, cannot construct it on a larger scale.    In order to sustain that you would need an abundance of ground water is something that Mars doesn't have.     Slaine definitely did not form an eathspace faction and command them to attack UEF bases  First it was Slaine continued the war and now its this bullshit? Well you haters pick a stance and stick with it? We know Slaine rape your mother as a child which is whhy you held such a longstanding grudge but this is looking pathetic.   "He couldn't stop it" doesn't mean shit.  Means a lot actually. A war is carried about by a series of decisions by a country not a single representative since he has no jurisdiction to stop the war unless the Emperor says so, in S1 we saw Saaz actually try to convince the Emperor to stop the ceasefire which showed not even he had the power to do so.   It's still his responsibility once he killed Saazbaum and took all his shit.   Actually its not. Killing Saaz didn't just magically make Slaine the reason the war began or the one who tried to assasinate Hime, that's just absurd.             Fanfiction: The Post   Jesus Christ you Slaine haters are pathetic      I don't see how this statement proves anon incorrect. A fake flower wouldn't warrant any mention of "microorganism" or dirtiness.  If you are so convinced they are fake, where is the proof? And where did Slaine get a bunch of fake flowers from? Does he manufacture them as a side job? Seems like a waste when they are so near to earth and in a war, you know.       I don't see how this statement proves anon incorrect.  Wait so a character who knows nothing of Earth and saying something unrelated is meant to be taken seriously?   If you are so convinced they are fake, where is the proof?  Where is the proof that they're real?   Slaine   The guy who didn't know the sky is blue? That's a great source you got there.            No one is arguing about him stopping the war. No one gives a shit. He put himself at the center when he killed Saazbaum and took his place. And he had no desire to stop the war in the first place. Not once has he expressed such an interest, so why are you even bringing it up?    I think you don't understand the burden of proof. It it up to the person bringing the point to prove their point.   And where did Slaine get a bunch of fake flowers from?  The same place they get the fake grass on their decoration.       Actually he can. Slaine knew very well what would happen. As far as humanity knows, he is the guy who organized the knights into a sizable army. He was not any innocent solider who did not know the truth.    The same knights who are racist against Terrans, who Slaine had to convince just to work with him.    I don't think Book and Dorito both would fail to tell the difference between real and fake flowers. It's not like they don't know what plants are.     He put himself at the center when he killed Saazbaum and took his place  Which still doesn't change the fact that he didn't start the war or staged an assassination attempt against Hime so he should not be charged for crimes he didn't commit under a court of law that's like saying a son should be put under arrest because his father was a wanted criminal before he died.    And he had no desire to stop the war in the first place   He said so himself that he couldn't stop it if he tried. It didn't matter if he wanted to stop it or not because it was impossible at that point          First it was Slaine continued the war and now its this bullshit?   What is wrong there? He called for an attack on UEF bases. Are you going to deny THAT, too? Are you syaing he had no control over the knights? Why was he trying to win over Klancin/loyalists, then?   Means a lot actually.   This war was carried out based on a lie originating from the Saazbaum clan. Them and them alone. Everyone else is kill or gone, but the boss remains. It's obvious the guy in charge will get the bad rep. Not that it's undeserved.    Actually its not.  Killing Saazbaum made all his sins Slaine's responsibility. All the good and bad. Slaine continued lying to every single person he comes across for his goals. He was in an inescapable mess and he knew it.            It's not like they don't know what plants are.  They don't even know what birds are. What makes you so sure they knew shit about plants. Most people can't tell the difference between authentic plants and fake ones.     Except neither or them are saying that the plants are real, and have also never seen a real one.     Killing Saazbaum made all his sins Slaine's responsibility.  Wow you're a fucking idiot.     At least valverave was entertaining, aldnoah was just fucking rage inducing and a complete mess. Literally only retarded shipper fags got any enjoyment out of it    Don't they eat plants though? They should at least have an idea. Book also knew other things about Earth (something about pigs?) and Dorito spent some time on Earth where she would have seen flowers. She was also handling the flowers so she would have realized if they were fake.    And, your point is? Because he had a tough time getting together the army he wants to use to conquer earth, he can't be held accountable?    And your point is that a character should be held accountable for being unable to do something, because they don't have the influence to do it.  And you don't see a problem with it?       Are you syaing he had no control over the knights?  He doesn't considering he had to convince them that he was legit and they only went along because they were racist and hated Terrans not because he ordered them to, even in the finale when Hime came out all the knights who supported him were mocking him. He never had control over them.    This war was carried out based on a lie originating from the Saazbaum clan   Nope it was carried out by the Emperor originally and Saaz manipulated that cause for his revenge. As stated before Saaz had no power to start the war he had to play his cards for 15 years for the right moment, what makes you think Slaine can do the same thing? Jesus people the show laid it on straight that the entire war was a fucking farce and people had been fighting for the cause of a man with dementia.   Killing Saazbaum made all his sins Slaine's responsibility.  Just stop, seriously you're just letting your hatred of a character get the better of your judgement. Slaine is not held accountable for Saaz actions they just used him as a scapegoat due to lack of evidence.    Slaine continued lying to every single person he comes across for his goals.   The only person he lied to was Lemina                They don't, its stated they eat krill, not plants.   They should at least have an idea. Book also knew other things about Earth (something about pigs?  Because its in a book.   Dorito spent some time on Earth where she would have seen flowers.  Which she spent on a military base, in hiding, she had no time to see them or touch them.          He knew the "reason" for the war was fake and the emperor was being lied to and he still pushed for war and used Lem to do it. He didn't even try to stop it (get Lem to talk to the emperor, find knights like Book who weren't that into it). He made it worse.   W Whether he got a fair trial or not would not change his fate. We have no idea what system of law he'd even be judged under. He is a scapegoat, because he is the perfect person to use. He  made a faction for himself   he took over and intensified the war effort   got the orbital knights to band together   is the head of the most influential clan and the princess' legal guardian    He said so himself that he couldn't stop it if he tried.  When did he say this?           He had the influence to do it. If he can get them to bend over backwards to do his bidding, he can use the awakened princess to end the war. With aldnoah rights held over their heads, they would not have a single choice in the matter. If all do not fall into line, they will be dealt with.   I don't think anyone could even prove he wasn't part of the plot to kill Hime. At most maybe prove that Sauce was guilty but the whole thing was done by the Vers pro-war faction which Slaine ended up leading, so most people would just assume he was at least in on it.  Before anon starts, I don't hate Slaine, it sucks for him but everyone's going to think the guy profiting the most from that plot was part of the plot.      Whether he got a fair trial or not would not change his fate  They would acquit him due to lack of evidence of the charges they put him on since they can't actually prove he did any of this. He can be trialed as a war criminal but not as a conspirator    When did he say this?  When Hime put a gun to him. He said that he couldn't stop it.   Actually it was Saaz who used Lem and she had no objection to it since she wanted to be used. Also you're grasping for straws now whether he knows the reason doesn't relly change the fact that he had no power to stop it especially when the Princess at the time was in a coma and his main prerogative was keeping her alive.          A/Z because it went full fujoshit    He doesn't  Bullshit. He did the necessary work and won respect. The earthspace faction were the only ones around other than the royals. He controlled them and ordered an attack on earth bases. He would be the one coordinating the attacks. Or Harklight. Or are you saying he'd let them rape whatever they want?   Nope it was carried out by the Emperor  Don't' fucking lie. The orbital knights attacked based on Saazbaum's lie. None of them knew the truth.   Slaine is not held accountable for Saaz actions they just used him as a scapegoat due to lack of evidence.   We was held responsible because he's the leader of the clan in a feudal system. Slaine is not any innocent solider who had no idea of the lies.   The only person he lied to was Lemina  And nearly every single person he came into contact with save for Eddel and Harklight. Or did you forget that the charade he's behind is entirely a lie?               expecting a vanilla ending after cour 1 ending which was great      I don't think anyone could even prove he wasn't part of the plot to kill Hime.  Easy. The time gap between the war starting and the assassination attempt Slaine was under Cruton and there's obviously papers to prove his incitement in the military and the plan of assassination and there's also the fact that there were other clans involve to testify also people like Dorito who OBVIOUSLY know that Slaine had nothing to do with it.    At most maybe prove that Sauce was guilty but the whole thing was done by the Vers pro-war faction which Slaine ended up leading, so most people would just assume he was at least in on it.   It can't really go through with lack of evidence on both sides. He's really just a scapegoat.         You are making way too many ridiculous theories about the plants. Even if they are fake(which you have not proved) what exactly is holding back mars from investing in hydroponics? They will be able to obtain water and soil from earth.    Only the Emperor could stop the war.  Are you this retarded? That's why Shithime had to stop being useless, kill her grandpa and become Empress. Because Slaine couldn't stop it even if he agreed to play along.       They GIVE Aldnoah RIGHTS to everyone.  They didn't. It's stated that Class System remains the same.  Earth is choosing to research what Slaine's dad research was so they could distribute universal Aldnoah rights.       eggs got cucked  slaine didn't have romantic feelings for hime.      He would not be acquitted. He assisted the mastermind knowing full well of what he was doing. We have not seen him do anything whatsoever to expose him.   When Hime put a gun to him. He said that he couldn't stop it.  All he said was that if it wasn't him, someone else would do it. He did not say anything about wanting peace. He DID say that the only way war can be stopped is either assimilation of destroying your enemy completely.        He did the necessary work and won respect.  The next episode there were several knights who looked down on him after Hime spilled the beans so...no you're wrong on that account.   The orbital knights attacked based on Saazbaum's lie   Nope, in the very same show it states that Counts were attacking under order of the Emperor not under Saaz which is why there were a split in fractions.   We was held responsible because he's the leader of the clan in a feudal system  Listen dumbfuck. If there's no accountability evidence that supports his acts in the war or the assassination then he can't be held accountable. Period. There is no case in history in which the inheritor took the fall for the actions of the other. Slaine cane take the fall for the actions he did as leader of the clan but NOT for the shit Saaz pulled had the show not put those charges on him then there would be no issue.   And nearly every single person he came into contact with save for Eddel and Harklight   Wrong. He was honest with both of them in regards to everything which is why Dorito pleaded with Hime and Harklight was his righthand man, he had no reason to lie to him.                Not this shit again. The point was that Vers wasn't going to give away Aldnoah but Aldnoah rights. And obviously Earth can't research it without sending people to Vers or cooperating with Vers.     The orbital knights attacked based on Saazbaum's lie. None of them knew the truth.   Did you forget episode 5: The one who declared the war was the Emperor who wanted war, even without Ass killed, deep inside, he never forgave them for killing his wife and his son.      She did not kill her grandpa. She succeeded him. Which is exactly the same fucking thing that could be done there, with Slaine instead of Klancain. So don't say "he can't do anything ;_;" when he never tried a single thing. You've made up so many excuses, but have not even considered the fact that he had the perfect tool at his disposal to make vers do literally anything.     We was held responsible because he's the leader of the clan in a feudal system.    Cool. Why aren't Inaho and Yuki locked up? Their father CAUSED Heaven's Fall which exterminated most Earth population. Didn't you know this?  Why isn't Ass and Lemons locked up? Their father caused the first planetary war.         He would not be acquitted.  Nope he would. They are charging him with assassination and starting the war stuff he did not do and stuff they cannot prove he did so he would be acquitted due to lack of evidence under trial which he was never given.   He assisted the mastermind knowing full well of what he was doing. We have not seen him do anything whatsoever to expose him.   This shit is irrelevant in the court of law and has nothing to do with the charges. Did he assist in the assasination? No. Did he assist in the start of the war? No. Case close.   All he said was that if it wasn't him, someone else would do it.   Nope, he literally said he could not stop it if he wanted.   He did not say anything about wanting peace   Was never the argument to begin with. It's like you're not even trying to admit you just blindly hate him                  Counts were attacking under order of the Emperor   It goes like this:  Saaz gets them to attack   Emperor orders cease-fire   Saaz lies to Emperor   Emperor believes Saaz and starts war again   Lem as Hime also lies to Emperor   war continues   There would have been no war without Saazbaum lying to everyone.             She did not kill her grandpa.   Pretty sure that was implied she pulled out he life support to become Empress.    Which is exactly the same fucking thing that could be done there, with Slaine instead of Klancain. So don't say "he can't do anything ;_;"     What Ass asked to Slaine was PLEASE STOP WAR ;_; without getting her hands dirty, she wasn't going to do anything. Only after Dorito told her Slaine was the same Slaine, she decided to actually be useful rather than expect other people to do shit for her.  She expected her grandfather to do this too. That was the point of the scene, she didn't have the strength or guts to do this bullshit until after she realized Slaine was suffering in this role and how her grandfather became delusional. When she confronted Slaine, she was still a stupid childish idiot who didn't have the guts or resolve to do shit. That's why Slaine disarmed her and told her to fuck off.             The next episode there were several knights who looked down on him after Hime spilled the beans so...no you're wrong on that account.  Wow, so because one guy insulted Slaine, this means he had no one on his side? So what the fuck is"earthspace"? Him and some dudes?     Nope  Watch episode one and two. They attacked before the emperor based on Saazbaum's assassination lie about the terrans doing it.   Slaine cane take the fall for the actions he did as leader of the clan but NOT for the shit Saaz pulled had the show not put those charges on him then there would be no issue.  Guess Slaine shouldn't have killed the guy. Whether or not he started it, he's still an accomplice in his schemes.   Wrong. He was honest with both of them in regards to everything which is why Dorito pleaded with Hime and Harklight was his righthand man, he had no reason to lie to him.   Can you even read whatsoever? I said he was honest with Eddel and Harklight, for fuck's sake. He lied to everyone else because his entire cause is a lie. Hell he lied to Klancain about Asshime wanting earthspace too.               Actually you fuckers lied to me about Heaven's Fall. I read the summary on 2ch and he destroyed the hypergate because as per Gil's plan Deimos was about to be chucked through it at Earth killing everyone.   Did you miss the Emperor wanted war, regardless if Ass died or not? That's what Ass realized when he met him again.    And this proves they knew they were being lied to how?    I'm talking about the chick who died because Kouta was a gigantic retard    Not arguing otherwise but the war came about originally because of the Emperor, all Saaz did was convince him to drop the ceasefire.    Which caused Heaven's Fall.    I see you missed the part where he came to his senses.    They don't care. Cain states they wanted to attack Earth, anon. This was an excuse. That's why they still ignore her and remain on Earth after she tried to call a ceasefire.    Daddy Kaizuka didn't actually do anything wrong then. No wonder nips draw him all heroic.    Hare wasn't a childhood friend And gigantic retard was Souta/Soda     That's him talking about Aldnoah.  He doesn't care about Earth war. I think you miss that part.     There are people who like David Production's anime. There's are people who think time stop isn't stronger than King Crimson or Gold Experience Reqiem. There are still people who don't think Heaven's Door isn't the most broken stand. There are people who still skip parts or don't read in order.  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87   New JoJolion translated today/tomorrow.              We're doing /a/ sings Sono Chi no Kioku, the full version. Recordings are due July 9th.    https://<span>youtu.be/eaT6suRjcaQ  [ ] [Embed] Don't forget to go apeshit on the ORA's.  Email killahspectah@live.com.  Jebus is late edition.          Who would win in a fight, DIO or Eva-01?    Heaven's Door.      There are people who like David Production's anime.  What are you implying?      That it is sub-par and part of thread bait.       TV DIO's voice &gt;&gt;&gt; OVA DIO's voice<br/>   New season when?    David do well      Capcom Dio the best.      watching anime     Yes.      Never.   Requesting this picture but with "Yare Yare daze" instead of moonrunes!   If I were to nt do the opening vocals should i just record blank until then or actually start the recording at my vocals?    god these are so bad and unfunny   Website updated, how cute.   The OVA was directed better. It was devoid of stupid poses that don't make sense in context and had better tension building and pacing.    They're great.    That's not even what the moonrunes say.    How's this?    Whoa, David even copied the position of nearly every knife heading for Jotaro in the manga.    Fuck it!  Thanks so much, anon.      Not really, look again.    I don't feel arsed to compare every single knife but it looks so similar that I'm impressed that they tried since those knives are CGI.    In the OVA, more knives were thrown after that screencap, they were just aimed torwards Jotaro's head.     It was devoid of stupid poses  do you know what an adaption means?    I will have passionate, consensual, hand-holding, loving sexual intercourse with the first person that gets their hand on that damn Runaway Girl doujin and scans it.  I miss it already   I think he means that the OVA is just a better piece of visual entertainment ; it obviously doesn't adapt the manga well, but that doesn't it's bad.     but that doesn't it's bad.  it isn't good either, that grain scratches my eyes.     Go get someone who knows Japanese to bug the doujin writer. The book is out of print. Information is in the last thread.    So basically it's never ever    Most likely. So stop moping or do it yourself.    we could be watching the first episode of DiU right now    But DP need a break anon!    With DP's budget? Stardust Crusaders already showed that the budget was running out in the later episodes, and following that up immidiately the next week after with DiU would result in a really shitty looking first episode of Part 4.    No no no, I don't think you understand. They were SAVING the budget, for the part 4 finale of course.    I will do the same for whoever scans the Pucci and mob of faceless men doujin     OVA Dio looks better than both manga and anime one  You had one job, david     Post the doujin cover or a link and I'll see what I can do.    What up with the shitty face lines in the anime?     yfw 90% of the budget was reserved for animating Josuke's dog turd of a hair style     The same artist with a couple other people are releasing an r-18 anthology so you can always order that one if you want to.   So is Jonathan just a complete cuck?    Entirety of season 2 was bad and season 1 was mediocre. D'Arby the Gambler episodes were eye cancer especially with using storyboard frames for D'arby's defeat is an utter joke. The anime fucking sucks.     http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=<wbr>2538422</wbr>   H O T P A N T S O T P A N T S          How? He did beat the shit out of the guy who tried to kiss his gf     Are you retarded or just an OVAfag?    As much as I loathe the OVA, it did D'Arby the Gambler and DIO's World pretty godd    I'm not blind, if that's what you're asking And as for that, I actually enjoyed David's Battle Tendency adaption more than the manga     Technically Dio is the cuck since when he has sex with women it's Jonathan's body that gets the sex.    GER is stronger though you idiot       It's okay Mr. Animeonly. You'll get the joke in 2020 or whenever part 6 gets animated.      jonathan's playing the long cuck       JoJo is great with their over the top handsome characters and DIO in the OVA really looks just like a normal anime villain guy      Jesus Jonathan looks like one of those faggot fuckbois that even the nerds in high school would pick on.    He's right. Those things stopped being funny long before that one was made and it's even worse for resorting to yet another lazy "Jotaro sure likes sea" joke.   So cute      stronger than time stop   le kill Giorno face  Complexity doesn't beat power to stop time.           Nah "read the manga" jokes are funny, that one is just shite.           What part of "resets everything to zero" don't you understand? Even King Crimson's time skip bullshit got reset to nothing so why wouldn't time stop.      In what way is GER complex. Even in the god awful translations its pretty laid out. It nullifies anything. It'd just undo the time stop as soon it was activated.        You can't reset things to zero when your user has died during the time stop.  Muslim and Buddists 1 - Catholics 0          GER acts independently of Giorno.     At what point did Giorno die during KC's time skip?    Who is the next purest JoJo after Jonathan?  DiU's budget went here.     Gappy, probably.     Kill GER then if that matters. Preferbly through timestop for more safety and so you don't get looped like a retard.        stupid poses  Excuse me?     But you can't kill him because the attack would be reset to zero.     How is it it going to use its ability when it dies before it can use it?     Don't even bother responding to that dumbass. He's literally just baiting you.   Part 4 anime when    "GER can survive timestop this guy is just baiting"  - /jojo/        old fat faceless men   add for ryonaket in sidebar      When David blows all their budget on buying the rights to DiU back from Warner Bros.   Why is Josuke so moe?      Could Tusk Act 4 be beaten by GER?  I don't think it's possible to reset 「Infinity」back to 「Zero」     Never.     Null infinity.     It'd probably cancel out and just turn the nails back into normal projectiles.     The leaked emails   Still waiting for a sauce on this.       this kills the universe     Possible.  It's just those things could tear through time stops and dimensions too.  Could Tusk Act 4 Escape a GER induced hell?  Then again I suppose Giorno can kill the will of the user to do such an act before he does it, but he's not psychic.           It's just those things could tear through time stops     GER can move in stopped time, but Giorno cant, during the time skip which acts similiar to the time stop GER was active so its not beyond a reasonable doubt that GER could act freely in the time stop    he didn't have to    During the final fight with Diego from Another Universe, Tusk Act 4 moves during the time stop.   Just like Jotaro could use Star Platinum during the Time Stop, although I don't think he has a limit on movement.      I'd go with yes on tearing a hole through ger hell, but only after a few thousand deaths for maximum Araki.   Never ever.   Even 「Infinity」 can be set to 「Zero」. If GER's ability was to reduce things until they became zero it, I think it would work on TA4, but it just sets it to zero. It would be neat to see TA4 against Green, Green Grass of Home, since it would be infinitely halving infinity.     Johnny would still shoot a bullet that spun infinitely, but it would never reach Giorno. It would reset back to zero just before it hit.    I will never understand the shadows on the noses     I really don't think King Crimson ever had the ability to stop time so I'd like to see some evidence.    Then how would you know what happens if GER or Giorno are killed before they can do anything?    Oops forgot about infinite rotation but it was more directed at GER.              0 × ∞   ∞ − ∞  You'd think these would set infinity to zero but they're actually indeterminate.      Warner Bros. was part of the group that made the anime. They claim copyright on most of the video content on Youtube.  The fact that they own part 4 is a good sign that it, too, will be animated. You guys are fucking retarded.      Truly this power of 「Lesson 5」    Thank you, Gyro      I want to bully Doppio.   in the shot where GER fucks up diavolo finally, everything is stopped, during the skipped time only king crimson can move, same as how the world and dio are the only ones who can move in his stopped time, but king crimson has more abilities beyond that, part V is a mess, and we must also take into consideration that every series the power levels rise at the end beyond what the previous serious had at their end, gappy could take on most of the jojos pretty easily     Let's be honest that was him skipping time and King Crimson is definitely not as strong as The World.      during the skipped time only king crimson can move  But that's wrong.     That would not be wise.    I will send my application tomorrow. Do we have to voice everyone or we can just pick who we want to sing as (TOMMY, CODA, Jin)?    Gappy has to rely on his plundering ability though and Soft &amp; Wet nowhere near as strong as Star Platinum. He broke his arm stopping Born This Way.     Can we include Mudas?      stand user using his stand ability in a stand fight  Shocking.      gappy   pure      I'm trying to say that Soft &amp; Wet isn't as powerful as you think it is. It's just that it's ability is just Heaven's Door levels of versatile and proof that you can't just punch your way through things.     stupid poses     I just want to see Highway Star get animated.   Reminder we won't see more brown qts  So what happened in that final fight between Dio and Jotaro? All he did was punch ZA WARUDO's leg and Dio exploded  Why are his hands and arms wrapped.   series ended with him getting his arm cut off. they grafted white zetsu guys arm onto him. same for sasukes arm. maybe he doesnt like the look of it so always wraps it?   He'll unwrap it and reveal that its covered with Sharingan eyes just like Danzo did   Nasty white clone flesh prosthetic. He covers it up so as to not look too weird. Everyone covers everything in bandages in that manga anyway.     The more important question is:  Why he fuck does naruto have whiskers?      In Kishimoto's original idea he was a cub of the fox demon that was killed while wrecking the village. Naruto could turn into a human but have the whiskers as telling signs.     Influenced by the Kyuubi during gestation      Can't he shave?    So do you guys feel like Sarada's character is weakened if her mommy issues turn out be nothing?  I can see the argument on both sides, but I feel like her character is a bit stronger if she's actually Karin's. But given that there's only one chapter, I can't see how they could wrap up everything in a way that favors Karin being her birth mother.      they are birth marks, anon     Sasuke never took the new arm.      Explaining away the DNA would need more than a chapter.  Sarada being told that Sakura's barren and Karin donated an egg would take a page, maybe two with her reaction.     Given how his laser skeleton's size seems to vary and he has in the past conjured ust parts of it it's not like he can't magic up an arm for himself whenever he wants to, anyway.     Sasuke the protagonist.   Implying he won't have 10 seconds of screen time again.      They are birth markings like a mole.     I don't like the surrogate theory. It doesn't really make much sense.      It doesn't really make much sense.  It fits Sarada having Karin's DNA without needing to go into detail of how she went and stole a fucking umbilical cord. It fits the theme of inheritance v. blood relations. It makes sense.  The only alternative is the clone/experiment, which is plain silly.         No, she learned the lesson and faced her feelings towards her parents, I don't see how the moral that two options are equal can be weakened by not having a specific one.     Sasuke just having sex with Karin is a much simpler explanation than trying to make sense of why Sasuke or Sakura would ask for Karin's help in conceiving a child.      Sasuke just having sex   simple explanation      I don't think it would take more than one or two panels to explain Karin having their material.  You helped us deliver the baby and without you here Sakura would die, please keep Sarada's umbillical cord as a memento of our appreciation to you.      Sasuke having sex or even a sex drive is plain wrong. I can sort of buy him doing his duty to the clan enough times to conceive a child, but not much more. With a barren Sakura on the one hand, and a ridiculously loyal weirdo who'd do anything for him, what is he to do?      A popular writer in a Japanese publishment writing a story for little boys in which a good character with a wife goes away and has sex with another woman is quite hard to explain.    this is true, but Kishi was plainly cuck-baiting as early as the final chapter of the main series, and anybody with half a brain could tell.  it's not as if teasing the plot is that much better than the cuckening actually happening.       I don't see how the moral that two options are equal can be weakened by not having a specific one.   Well, it's weakened because a character going to save their biological mother is perfectly natural, it doesn't exactly show that Masashi Kishimoto's philosophy as spoken through the mouthpiece of Naruto's character is true.  The anons who keep insisting it doesn't matter only insist it doesn't matter because they're only thinking about whether Sarada is happy by the end, they're not thinking of how well the story conveys its own philosophy to potentially ignorant readers.        Don't know about Salad's character but the lesson would be negated and useless if she turned out to be Sakura's daughter after all.    Oh really?   fuck off.    I'm going to cover the face of my midwife in this old photo with my own face.     There doesn't have to be any explicit reference to sex you know. Besides, shonen manga reference sex in "safe" ways all the time.       What's the source on next week being the last chapter?   That photo gave me paranoia months ago.   The woman behind him   She knows.        But by saying it's weakened by not having Karin as her mother you're onyl proving that it does matter, that by default it shouldn't work out and this precidence stands out. I always hated these kinds of morals in any show, honestly, it just doesn't work, if you have to go out of your way to say two things are equal then that surely means they are not supposed to be equal.    Well there is no other picture of Sasuke and those family frames are kinda made with same size in mind.     The only alternative is the clone/experiment, which is plain silly.   You do realize what you are reading, right?       please keep Sarada's umbillical cord as a memento of our appreciation to you.  In Nip culture that's just not something you fucking give away as a memento to a third party.  The parents take care of it because it's believed to be tied to the well-being of the child, and they eventually give it to the kid.  I mean I'm sure Kishi could kishilogic his way out of that but still, it'd be weird.         His arm is full of sharingans.    Since the arm is made with senju genes, those got to be rinnegans.    And how much of a shitstorm that chapter caused, even for Joseph who always was a wild card and a pervert people still said that was going too far. For Sasuke with his stern asexual demeanor that's otright impossible.    He has a normal flesh colored arm. He chooses to keep it wrapped up as a reminder to his final battle with Sasuke.    I'd actually reckon it'd be cool if he built an Edward-esque mecha-arm with kunai and shuriken and shit stored in it. Because he's not enough of a special snowflake.    He can do that via Rinnegan already.    Susanoo is always giant, anon. He literally can't do that. It's not like the tailed beast arms that Naruto could use. Sasuke's a one-armed shinobi and still a complete angsty badass. Although Naruto's new arm is pretty cool too, if only for anime aesthetics.    In what way?     But by saying it's weakened by not having Karin as her mother you're onyl proving that it does matter, that by default it shouldn't work out and this precidence stands out.   I think you're looking at this in terms of real life too much and not in terms of storytelling and its generally accepted rules. If you're a writing a story with the intention of propagating a particular worldview over and against an opposing viewpoint, then you have to assume that your readers are either totally ignorant or in doubt that they need to be reassured or convinced that your worldview is true.   it just doesn't work, if you have to go out of your way to say two things are equal then that surely means they are not supposed to be equal.   But they're not equal, not in terms of actual storytelling. If you're going to use a story as a platform for preaching a particular philosophy, then even if the moral is about "equality," not all examples you can use are equal. Also, for the record, I don't think this story was really about "equality" at all. It was more about how love transcends blood relation, and this driven home a lot better for a potentially ignorant or confused readership by an adopted Sarada who is more attached to her adoptive mother and mentor more than either of her birth parents.          I remember the size changing, though. Sometimes the ribcage is just big enough to have him fit inside, sometimes it holds three people easily.     That's a bit anti-climactic though, ain't it?     We are talking about Naruto, are we not?    The trailer shows he will have at least 10 mins.     I don't think the lesson would be negated, I just agree with what others have said about it being a more weak representation of Naruto's philosophy. Maybe Masashi Kishimoto is content with it being like that, but it does lessen the quality of the Gaiden as a piece of propaganda.  It'd be like if I was making Nazi propaganda films that preached about the glory of the pure white aryan race and the hero was only half-white.       Hm, yeah, I guess I am looking at it from the worng side.Maybe it does weakens the story, but it can still work if she never finds the truth, like she'll just say she doesn't care anymore and get on with her life thinking Karin's her mother but love connects her with Sakura and then it's just Sasuke and Naruto talk about it to reveal for the audience, but then that would be kinda stupid.     Sasuke and Naruto talk about it to reveal for the audience, but then that would be kinda stupid.   If the next chapter is the last one this is exactly how I see it going down.  I think Karin made Salad with her and Sasuke's DNA to so they could be a family, but Sasuke refused and Karin gave her up to Sasuke.        Sasuke can just make an arm out of lightning if he needs to do things that require two hands, like holding his newborn daughter.     The way I could see it playing out, assuming the story won't reveal the dna test was a fluke, is either Naruto and Sasuke will have their talk and we won't know what they say and Sarada drops the issue, leaving it all up to the reader to decide what they believe is or should be the case, or Sasuke will be implied to have had actually had a brief relationship with Karin, but it will be toned down for the rating and to save the most amount of pages  I doubt Sasuke would actually say "yeah, I stuck it in crazy, and it was a huge mistake" but I could see them glossing over any explicit references to sex while still having him explain that Karin "gave birth to her." Keep in mind, they've never actually said any of the parents have had sex to produce their kids, it's just something those of us who know how kids are made naturally assume.  One of the false assumptions I've seen here since this thing began has been that in order for Sasuke to explain how Karin is the mother he would need to actually say he had "sex" with Karin. All he has to do is confirm she's the birth mother, he doesn't have to give us any juicy details, you know?         More like 1 minute.      Sasuke   holding his daughter       Even Vegita held trunks.     Vegeta was there for his kid.     Kind of easy when you don't have a job.  The irony being is that he hugged him while he was on the job.        Sasuke   having a job   His "job" consisted of walking around a forest for twelve years waiting for the plot to find him as he played ninja candy crush on his phone         &gt;holding his daughter    Even Vegita held trunks.    Vegeta was there for his kid.    Kind of easy when you don't have a job.  Vegeta didn't have a job and also had 2 arms. Sauce doesn't have either.   The irony being is that he hugged him while he was on the job.  I see what you did there               In the current ninja economy any work is welcomed.      here's my kid with that other woman   I need to leave to do an important "job"   it's probably better if I never come back   be right back.   yeah, Sasuke is full of it. We all know what his top secret mission has been.            and that's how your mom got pregnant Sarada      The DNA thing could easily be explained away by it being Sasuke's DNA. It's not out of character for her to keep that as some kind of weird trophy.    But the sample given was from Karin's umbilical cord.       You would assume that the technology they used could differentiate between the father's genes and the mother's genes.     Kaguya was revealed first in Storm 4 than she was in the anime    I wouldn't assume Kishy knows how those tests work. And neither do I, in my mind you just put two examples of DNA in and it shows if there's a match.    Except even modern DNA tech can be iffy on the subject of identification, and they ran a check for "does it match," not, "is it female." Also, what with Karin's known tastes and with Sharkboy at the helm, an element known to cock things up, it's more or less guaranteed that the sample was Sasuke's hair, so the match was a misid. It'll probably have some cute little scene of "I don't have to be related by blood to call you my family," then running another test and showing the sample was wrong. Because fucking Naruto.   As far as the wrapped arms, he lost one as a result of series finale, and he also suffered permanent damage from Kyuubi's removal and from the strain of battle. Basically, for the same reason as Rock Lee, it's just not a pretty sight underneath.    it's more or less guaranteed that the sample was Sasuke's hair   hair   black vs bright red    Suigetsu is certain the item is from a birth   I know people here doubt Suigetsu's intelligence but he's not a fucking contestant in the Special Olympics.         Naruto games are making very large money nowdays.  Probably more than the anime.      If it was a hair, even Suigetsu would know if it was Karin's or not. Black hair=not Karin. He at least has the deductive reasoning to know that. So obviously if it was hair, then he would know for certain if it was Karin's.  Now, if it's an umbilical cord, it'd be hard to explain how Karin got a hold of Sasuke's or Sarada's, even if it was Karin one was talking about.  Suigetsu seemed to know how all this technology worked. He wasn't bumbling around trying to figure out how to program a VCR.         Considering the scene was uncolored and Suigetsu was saying how the hell does he operate it, that seems to be opposite the case.     Suigetsu was saying "how the hell does he operate it"   Are we reading the same manga? He only struggled to find Karin's sample.       I don't remember him showing any incompetence in performing the test.      Considering the scene was uncolored  How the living fuck have people commented on the Uzumaki red hair color multiple times in-universe if they're only capable of seeing in black and white?   Suigetsu was saying how the hell does he operate it  He showed a level of uncertainty about the source of the DNA in Karin's desk but he never once questioned how to operate the machine. He even took the DNA sample used specifically in parental testing (Buccal swab). You have Alzheimer's or you're baiting.           I can sort of buy him doing his duty to the clan enough times to conceive a child, but not much more.   Did Sasuke even want to revive the Uchiha? I feel like Sasuke simply wanted to restore its honor and after his redemption and seeing everything the Uchiha clan is capable of doing, I wouldn't be surprised if he actually never wanted a kid. It would explain some of his cold and impersonal demeanor around his own daughter.  Putting aside the issue of who is Sarada's mother, I find it harder to believe that Sasuke would even want a child.         I feel like Sasuke simply wanted to restore its honor  He did, which is weird because until he started all that shit Uchiha's reputation was very high.      Putting aside the issue of who is Sarada's mother, I find it harder to believe that Sasuke would even want a child.  And there in lies the greatest problem that SS fangirls face; they are in love with a guy who clearly doesn't want to fuck.  The entire drama they built up all these years and through out the gaiden, revolve around the undeniable fact that Sasuke had no sexual desires whatsoever. That might have seemed "cool" in the beginning, but SS eventually realised it was going to be a problem. All the argument about Salad's maternity all boils down to "Sasuke needed to have fucked!". This despite overwhelming evidence that no matter how many times Sasuke confirms that he cares about his family and declares Sakura his wife, it still seems like he skipped the honeymoon stage. He went straight from being single, to married with children and away from home. SS needed that missing stage, that "madly in love and fucked like rabbits" stage, which Sasuke just couldn't provide. They got what they asked for, what they deserved.       The Uchiha are not a sensible family. Or at least the ones domesticated by Tobirama aren't.     Sasuke felt like the entire village was laughing at him and his clan. see pic     And there in lies the greatest problem that SS fangirls face; they are in love with a guy who clearly doesn't want to fuck.   Really, I can believe that he did it at least once in his life.  What I can't believe is that he would actually want a child, especially after seeing just how evil and dangerous his clan can be and losing his own family in such a traumatizing fashion, having been driven to insanity over it. And I think the problem with the Sakura/Sasuke fanbase is that they probably assume that Sasuke deep down just wants to have tons of vanilla sex with his wife and raise a whole bunch of Sakura spawn.  Does anybody seriously believe this guy would be enthusiastic about being a father to more cursed Uchihas and starting another family he could potentially lose? It's already a bit out of character for him to be married at all.               Not domesticated, rather.     mere shit-tier Sharingan   not Madara's superior Rinnegan       Suigetsu THINKS it's Karin's.  Also, while technology might distinguish between mother and father, it's far from obvious that Suigetsu could know where to look for that information.       Does anybody seriously believe this guy would be enthusiastic about being a father to more cursed Uchihas and starting another family he could potentially lose? It's already a bit out of character for him to be married at all.  This is why I am a supporter of "Karin made a baby in a vat" theory. It would be in character that Sasuke doesn't want a child, but if he was GIVEN a child he would want it taken care of. But since he never planned to have a kid, it would make sense that he isn't any good at being a father.  All the cucking jokes on /a/ just confuses the issue. No one truly believe Sasuke had enough sexual desire to fuck, let along enough effort to cheat. What we see so far fits the image of Sasuke not wanting a family, but now that he was forced to have one he tried his best to deal with it. A+ for good intentions and D- for result.        Also, while technology might distinguish between mother and father, it's far from obvious that Suigetsu could know where to look for that information.  Enough about that. Their genetic tech is many times more advanced than ours.     No, he's just lost in a forest and can't use GPS since his phone died and he didn't bring a charger.     This is why I am a supporter of "Karin made a baby in a vat" theory.   another bombshell like that would require at least two more chapters. There's no way you can force Sarada to deal with the "fact" that Sakura isn't her mother within the course of two to three chapters and then drop that she isn't even a natural child to boot and resolve that in the course of a single chapter.   No one truly believe Sasuke had enough sexual desire to fuck, let along enough effort to cheat.    Sasuke having sex with Karin doesn't mean Sasuke cheated on anyone because Sasuke may not even been married at the time. Secondly, where is this impression coming from that Sasuke is some kind of alien with no sex drive at all? It's more believable that he just rarely has sex than he doesn't have sex at all. I can understand the interpretation of him being asexual when he was on his darkness binge, but there's nothing to say the redeemed Sasuke wouldn't be more receptive to either Sakura or Karin's affections, even if he was really awkward about it.  I can more easily believe the guy had sex one time in the last 14 to 15 years since he stopped being a psychopath than I can that he's some kind of sexless eunuch.             Sasuke having sex with Karin doesn't mean Sasuke cheated on anyone because Sasuke may not even been married at the time.  I bet they were on a break with Sakura.     Back to the nineties you.   Sauce has been on a break with Sakura for 12 years.        another bombshell like that would require at least two more chapters.  Not really, the ability to make whole humans in a vat was already demonstrated in the early chapters of the gaiden. The point is my argument takes into account the entire arc and what happened in it.   Secondly, where is this impression coming from that Sasuke is some kind of alien with no sex drive at all?  Because he never had any sex drive at all, EVER. Give me any moment when Sasuke was interested in a woman sexually or was arounsed, at any time, from either the manga or the gaiden, and I would believe otherwise. Even in the Gaiden he never treat Sakura as a lover, but as a wife. This isn't conjecture, this is just the way it is. Compared to Naruto who repeatedly had shown interested in women.          Just saiyan. Sasuke may not have married Sakura until after it came to his attention he had a child as a result of some "yeah, sorry" sex he gave Karin.     But his feeling towards here were established in 699 when he poked her in the head. From that point on it counts as they are together.     he poked her in the head  Does that mean hitachi and sauce were a couple too?     It meant they love each other, head poking is literally only expression of love Sasuke knows.    That would be Sarada.  Sasuke even gets to lead a mission to rescue Naruto from the aliens.     So they're not gonna adress the question of where the fuck did Shin get kamui ability? His own mangekyo is just weapon telepathy, that spiral warp is definitely Obito's.   You only notice that now?     Not really, the ability to make whole humans in a vat was already demonstrated in the early chapters of the gaiden.  It took 1 chapter for the DNA test reveal to be set up and another chapter for Naruto to use TnJ to persuade Salad into accepting Sakura as her mother.  I agree with the other anon that even if human experimentation has a big precedent in this manga, it's one thing for Salad to be shaken up about being adopted. It'd be another beast altogether for her to learn that she is not even a naturally created human that was the product of love between two individuals, rather she's an experiment created by a psychotic stalker that was later dumped like a hot potato on an unknowing couple.  The preview for next week's chapter even says that it's going to be about Salad graduating the academy. Even for Kishi it'd be a fucking feat to pull off all that other aforementioned shit in ~19 pages.        Will we find out why Shin thinks he's Akatsuki and why he holds Sasuke as a cunt because he 'killed' Itachi?    I agree with the other anon that even if human experimentation has a big precedent in this manga, it's one thing for Salad to be shaken up about being adopted. It'd be another beast altogether for her to learn that she is not even a naturally created human that was the product of love between two individuals, rather she's an experiment created by a psychotic stalker that was later dumped like a hot potato on an unknowing couple.  What is a "natural" human anyway? In the Naruto universe being unnatural is practically a divine gift. Naruto himself is a walking ball of unnaturalness.    So is Gaiden supposed to be only 10 chapters?  When's the movie premiering anyway?     Not really, the ability to make whole humans in a vat was already demonstrated in the early chapters of the gaiden. The point is my argument takes into account the entire arc and what happened in it.   It's not a question of ability. You already forced Sarada to deal with her mother not being her real mother and it's still something she's dealing with. You plan on adding another twist that she technically doesn't even have a birth mother? The next chapter is the resolution, you're not going to have anymore dramatic reveals like that. The babyvat theory is dead in the water. Sasuke had sex, just deal with it, man.   Because he never had any sex drive at all, EVER. Give me any moment when Sasuke was interested in a woman sexually or was arounsed, at any time, from either the manga or the gaiden, and I would believe otherwise   He doesn't need to. The more reasonable conclusion is that he's merely emotionally and physically distant, not that he's sexless. The problem is you're presenting a false dilemma here where either Sasuke is either passionately interested in sexual relationships or he has no such interest in them at all. But while there's no case of him showing any sexual interest in a woman, it doesn't mean he wouldn't ever, even after he's let go of the things that are responsible for his lack of interest to begin with.          I naturally created human is one that was made simply by 2 people fucking.     head poking is literally only expression of love Sasuke knows.  Then how did he ever become a father?      There's only one chapter left. Even if we assume that it's going to be an extra long chapter, there's no way they would have enough time to introduce and deal with a test tube baby problem.  Either Masashi Kubo is going to leave it all open for the reader to decide or he's going to reveal that Sasuke had sex with either Sakura or Karin to produce Sarada. The simplest explanation is Sasuke had sex just once and Kishimoto doesn't even need to explicitly say he did that to confirm who the mother is.       Yes. But knowing how to operate a machine doesn't mean knowing how to read correctly the results.  The details of the analysis, including whether the parent was father or mother, might well have been displayed only on request and Suigetsu never even thought of checking     NURUTARD U R U T A R D            Yes. But knowing how to operate a machine doesn't mean knowing how to read correctly the results.  You are assuming a scientist who had been working in the same lab for a DECADE does not know how to operate his own equipment. That is definitely reaching.       implying he didn't poke Karin in the head too.      Tenten really was the star of that series.    He mostly poked her in the chest     There's only one chapter left. Even if we assume that it's going to be an extra long chapter, there's no way they would have enough time to introduce and deal with a test tube baby problem.  That's what I said     Except Suigetsu isn't a scientist     I know, I was agreeing with you      Except Suigetsu isn't a scientist  After a decade working in Oro's lab, yes he is.     Ah I can never tell on this site       That's not all he poked apparently.      more important question is, Does Lee really procreated asexually or he managed to get 10/10 pussy?    They look nothing alike really. 1010 is pure.     1010 is pure.  thats what im scared from Cakes in Nardo universe has destined to become rotten     So, Kish explained where the other part of the Kazuma is now?    not fruit ninja  You had one job.      I think Most likely sarada was dying at birth, and they had karin used her blood to heal the baby. But with such a small body the blood pretty much took over.      That doesn't seem like anything to keep from her though.     yeah karin saved salad life, rather then rejoicing about it, sakura decide to Photoshop herself over her and not tell salad about it, while also forgetting to forge some birth record for her dear daughter, explaining the situation of dna change......kek     and they had karin used her blood to heal the baby.  Doesn't explain why Karin disappeared from Salad's life. Any and all theories involving Karin need to explain why Salad had never met her.     theres no way Karin and Sakura could ever be friends. Just like how Ino and Sakura hated eachother until Ino realized how retarded it was to keep liking Sasuke     theres no way Karin and Sakura could ever be friends.  And even IF they were friends, it would make no sense that Salad didn't know Karin exists.      The one thing I can't stand that they've done with Sarada so far is giving Sakura's dumb uber-punch. I get what Kishi was going for thematically, but I seriously hope he doesn't intend this be her main ability. Nobody liked it on Sakura to begin with.  Besides, isn't Sarada's whole thing supposed to be that she's "calm, cool and collected?"     why didn't kuruma regrew naruto's arm?    It's a front, anyone who spends 12 years around Sakura will become a shannaroing nutcase.    Wood arm is cooler plus maybe extra powers.    KEK     Sarada saying shannaro already felt a tad forced, but I don't think her learning or inheriting, whichever it turns out to be, Sakura's punching ability is a good prospect for her career.  The skill itself is hardly useful for anything besides clearing away large numbers of weakers enemies who could have easily been cleared by some other jutsu, except here you just save some time and chakra, or for clearing away obstacles or creating distance between yourself and your enemies. That's mostly why medical ninja use it.  It really sucks in a one on one fight by itself because it depends so much on you getting close to your opponents in order to land accurate and decisive blows. It also lacks stealth and potentially destroys the environment you could otherwise use to your advantage. Anyone who makes it their main ability is doomed to be outclassed by faster or stealthier ninja. Sakura became useless because all she ever had going for her was her strength while even Naruto utilized the same ability more effectively. All taijutsu users have some degree a high strength, but Sakura was useless because she wasn't balanced at all. Tsunade and Shizune were only slightly better because they were actually good at medicine while Sakura just had generic healing skills.         cause character designs.   giving Sakura and Sarada super strength was a mistake   Yeah, I feel like she's not gonna develop any interesting skills if she's just super punching shit all the time.    You're half right, it will be bad for her career but not for the reasons you described but because Kishi's a hack and she's going to become as useless as he mother because pottery. Just as Hashirama was the original user of Tsunade's super strength he wasn't a chump scrub because of all his other powers, and Salad has the same potential to have powers that stop her being a punch-ground useless medic type while still making good use of super strength but she's had her spotlight and now she'll be as shit as her mum. All that potential down the drain.      She won't even have proper taijutsu skills. She'll just rushing in try to get a big hit, just like her mama.    Which is depressing. With her sharingan she could be throwing out super strength jabs because she could still retain good form without sacrificing strength.   is there really only one chapter left?  Fucking hell this thing has been poorly paced.      like I was saying here , the ability is best when used as merely one combat skill in a balanced arsenal or to remove obstacles. It's a pretty piss poor ability to center your whole combat style on. Guy had a lot of strength too, but his combat style wasn't centered solely on "punch stuff and make things explode."    The only hope for Sarada is that she'll actually use her Sharingan to copy useful jutsu to balance things out and just use power punch when it's convenient. But that all depends on whether the creator can calm his obsession with thematic parallels.         Hinata would never ever let that happen.    Hopefully she ends more like a Kakashi with super strength, but holding my breath would be suicidal.    If salad fighting smarter that ability can be effective especially with sharingan   The issue with superstrength is that in order for it to not be overpowered, the one using it would have to miss nearly all the time. This means 99% of the time the user would literally do nothing at all. Compare that to situational skills like Chakra chains, which don't do direct damage but is far more useful against more types of enemies, and one can see there is a problem having super strength in a fighting manga.     Naruto's son    Sasuke and Sakura's daughter   hinata fags btfo        Think of it like a Pokemon's attack slots. The reason people aren't happy with Sarada getting the super punch is that it takes up a slot better used on virtually anything else as Kishi plain refuses to give any character besides Kakashi more than four techniques or abilities. So far Sarada has a low-tier sharingan for buff, a useless, slow AoE that does fuck all and has a history of jobbing. Even if Jump makes Kishi make more chapters and there is more space for Sarada to develop, the jobber punch has lodged itself into Kishi's autistic brain the same way Naruto's Rasengan and clones did. Those of us who welcomed the lowering of power levels are massively disappointed because not only is that now rising, but we are back to fights likely boiling down to spamming your signature attacks instead of something varied and interesting.        Is this from the Lee manga?    Le'ss spinoff is the Springtime of Youth. This is a similar thing but with Sausage, popularly called the Springtime of Darkness/Edge.    Your face when       Naruto presents my hopes for her character. Sarada cradles them to her chest as they die, there are worse ways to go.    He loses his balance if he shaves them anon    but why is Sakura wheezing and sweating everywhere? Is she dying or something    Remember when Tsunade warned him that applying wind to the Rasengan would damage his arm? This is what happens after 100 crazy Rasengans plus this too:     That was before he could throw it.    yeah, how the hell will they tie this all up in one chapter?    Remember when Kakashi was limited to just 5 Raikiris a day or else he'd die, no exception?    What chapter is this of Springtime of Youth?    no, and neither did kishi     Sakura was too sickly to have children because please watch Boruto: Naruto the movie, in theaters this summer!     That and how using Kamui twice use put him in the hospital for a week.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VOj<wbr>OcVLkpTo</wbr>  [ ]    And there in lies the greatest problem that SS fangirls face  the greatest problem ss fangirls face is that they think they are reading a shoujo where sakura is the every girl protagonist that's better than all the other bitches and sasuke is the bad boy that can only change with the power of their love     Is he deaf or is that some hearing aid?    but he did damage his arm before       so either she settled with Lee or on its way to become ninja witch?       she didnt, konoha hiden shows she remained single    looks like communications headset for me since they are in chuunin exams n all...    Derp, that would make sense.    nobody cared who he was until he put on the wrap.    In a way I think it is unfortunate that the Chinese-themed characters didn't get their own village. That was the original plan after all; Tenten, Lee, and even the Hyuga clan were all meant to be in another village where they all dresse in Chinese clothes and learn Chinese martial arts. The decision to put them all in the Fire village just means they end up with less characterisation.     Sakura chan is so moe   Sasuke's and Sakura's daughter    Even WSJ has Sakurafags on damage control.      So far how would you rate Shin as a villain? Is he a step above Kaguya or is he just filler tier?   Filler tier, he's no where near how powerful Kaguya is.    Damn, she is even uglier on that picture    filler tier, slightly above mizuki the tiger    Undoubtedly shit which is too bad because I like his design. Shallow goals, idiotic plan.     So far how would you rate Shin as a villain? Is he a step above Kaguya or is he just filler tier?  He is a plot device for Salad's story. To essentially show that there is something worse than not seeing your father for 12 years.     it was implied that she loves "weapons"  implying she didn't saw Lee's youthful and energetic "weapon"   implying her vagina seal didnt got broken just from seeing it   implying Lee didn't tried to break Naruto's record in the bed with 1010         like a Kakashi  Useless?     let it go    I honestly would have perferred if he just turned out to be Shisui like everyone believed. Sure, it would have been incredible stupid; but it would let the character hold a little more water. Better than one of Orochimaru's leftover experiments.     mizuki the tiger   Wow. I forgot all about this and i did not need those memories back.      cant let it go mang at least, at least just till movie aight?     I somewhat hoped Mizuki would return in the manga but having that filler mess ruined it for me.    I'm pretty sure current Kakashi could've taken this guy. He's Mizuki tier.        Sasuke and Karin's baby kicking ass.     Sasuke smiling at his daughter  Okay, that's actually nice.    can't wait for the next time-skip when we get sarada and boruto kids with kyubi tails rinnegan and sharingan eyes   Why would they have the Kyuubi? Since Kurama is nice now; there is no need to seal him into someone else after Naruto.    More like he picked up some kid in some place.  10/10 is single.        and forced  dude can't spare 5 minutes to talk to her when she's clearly distressed about him attacking her and not seeing her in 12 years  but I guess a smirk is enough for the papasuke fags           The two patterns are exactly the same   It's an exact match   "I'm pretty sure this is from when Karin was born"   Salad wasn't born in a hospital   Oh, now it makes sense. That's Salad's umbilical cord. She was born there.          I still believe on Genetic Experiment end.    Oh, now it makes sense. That's Salad's umbilical cord. She was born there.   The mother is the one traditionally who keeps the umbilical cord for safe keeping until the child is an adult. So SS fangirls still get blown the fuck out.     I think the worst thing about all this is Sasuke never bothered to make contact with his daughter in over ten years and judging by the trailers this gets white washed away.    I think the worst thing about all this is Sasuke never bothered to make contact with his daughter in over ten years and judging by the trailers this gets white washed away.  Sakura can't miss what she never had. Sasuke isn't a very good father and that isn't going to change. And the same with Sasuke not being a very good husband and being a non-existent lover.     He's nowhere near as powerful as Tobi was.  He's a fucking bitch tier, probably weaker than Deidara.      But then again, he's fighting against guys that are Kaguya level, so it kinda should be expected.    not just that, he clearly came back to konoha at least once and didn't care to see her  sakura is to blame to, since she either never told him to visit his fucking daughter when he came back or agreed with him when he said he wouldn't      He got finished by a bunch of retarded onions so he's not even a real villain of the bunch.   Though on something hiliarious, the thing karin did could be that who so ever bangs sasuke, the child would always be sasuke and karin. That would be genuis.   Compare him to previous villains like Kaguya, Madara, Netori, War Obito, and Nagato he looks like a scrub.    He is just a coolest guy wanna be.     Compare him to previous villains like Kaguya, Madara, Netori, War Obito, and Nagato he looks like a scrub.  If he was a serious threat then Salad would have been sent home first thing. It would have been irresponsible for both Naruto and Sasuke to put a child in that kind of danger.     Yeah but you can't simply expect the guy to bust in a "Chibaku Tensei moment" not even 1 volume in the third series. You simply can't.      lol...    Underrated.     what is improving     you know this is ending next week, right ?    had a hunch about it...    Back when Kakashi was a cool guy who didn't suck, like in his Zabuza fight.      That was seven hundred chapters ago, anon.  Time to let go.     Are they finally gonna say why Sarada doesnt have a birth record and why the test matched Karin next chapter?   No, please, it's all I have.    I feel conflicted   Naruto isn't over yet? I saw saradadrara girl in the latest of my narutoxsakura doujin, she wears glasses. i thought of karin instantly and didn't want to read it, I hate those red frames, but it was okay because Naruto got her pregnant and it was in black and white.     Sakura-chan is so moe  Get me every time     That color scheme on Kaguya is shit. Why add purple for no reason? Why brown horns? Why give resurrected goddess lipstick?    Girls wear lipstick, even in Japan.     Why add purple for no reason?  Purple is a Royal colour in Japan, and also ironically it is a villainous colour.     Oh so the great magician that lost her touch with humanity got resurrected in the middle of colossal fight and though "oh no, I can't enslave humanity without my makeup"?    Yes, it's a fucking fictional world with magic ninjitsu and being able to change your old ass body into a triple F tit faced hokage whenever you want.  The "hurdurr an orange ninja?" argument falls apart once you realize it's basic ninjitsu to conceal your appearance to anything whatsover. This is absolutely meaningless to her, she's vain, she's a woman, a female.   In this world vanity choices aren't plot holes or questions you should be asking.        Look mate, if you were a chick who ate a magic fruit and became a god would you not want to look your best while subjugating the masses? She was a ruler before she went bonkers, she had an image to maintain. Plus, who doesn't want to feel pretty, you fag.     Maybe makeup was just invented to look like her face    Purple has always been a color of royalty since purple dye was rare.     But her outfit is a priestess's so the lining should be red, not purple, and it wouldn't clash as bad with white.     Maybe Madara had some liptsick in his pocket just in case he needed it    I wonder, if Boruto and Sarada appear, wouldn't Naruto and Sasuke from the last make more sense as costumes for adult Naruto and Sasuke? They'd have basically the same moveset, and It'd make more sense for the kids to be in teams with their parents instead of, well, the bachelor version of their parents, right?   I feel like everything including sarada's suffering would be solved instantly if sasuke just spoke to them, you know kinda like how itachi could of stopped sasuke going batshit if he told him the truth to begin with?    I feel like everything including sarada's suffering would be solved instantly if sasuke just spoke to them, you know kinda like how itachi could of stopped sasuke going batshit if he told him the truth to begin with?  That would require Sasuke to take responsibility... And we both know he doesn't do that kind of thing.     He poked Karin on the head and she had to redirect the little shits poking to her vagina.     Keep in mind, they've never actually said any of the parents have had sex to produce their kids  Well, yeah. Sex may simply not exist in this universe. Dating doesn't exist either - can anyone name an actual dating couple in Naruto? Anyone? Bueller?       But he can say sorry and take the blame on everything though.    Dating exists though. Sex may not.    my god it's full of sharingan     To be fair, cloning was introduced in the same chapter as the test.    I'm baffled by this. Sakura isn't even the focus of this ad.    Link please?    Fun fact: parent DNA and child DNA are 99.99% identical. A pair of graphs that are 99.99% identical would look pretty much the same.    Kishi did a two page bit of Naruto and Hinata going on a date. Not the actual date, just going to it because he can't take that sort of thing. Shikamaru and Temari hang out too, and Naruto asks if it's a date.     Rachel was a bitch and a whore    Orochimaru still has his akatsuki robes in his cloest    I believe you and not any scientific fact that comes my way disproving you     edo tensei     Interviews said he cried writing Sakura's confession and that was fake. One can only imagine what he went through drawing those two pages.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paren<wbr>tal_testing  In a DNA parentage test, the result (called the 'probability of parentage)[3][not in citation given] is 0% when the alleged parent is not biologically related to the child and the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child.  People underestimate how much DNA we share. Humans and chimpanzees already share around 98%. People think DNA is just "blue eyes, blond hair, couldn't carry a tune if it had handles", and they forget about "has two eyes that function like this and are placed here, has a stomach that processes these substances, is lined with these cells and is placed here". You know, all the necessary stuff you'd need to be an actual living biological organism.   </wbr>    Dating is a relatively new thing in Japan after all.    Seriously? Is he ok in the head or was he lying?     Implying he wasn't crying in laughter     Really, if she just trained under Guy for a while, her punching would be damn effective. Both Sakura and Sasuke showed they could create bursts of speed by pushing chakra into their feet at the right moment (vs Ino, vs Haku). Now imagine if she could do that AND she was as fast as Lee because of training. THEN add on the super strength on top of the strength Lee had without any gates already (punch into the ground and pull up a giant tree root)     I don't know the exact figures offhand, but he may not be far off, due to the simple fact that DNA doesn't differ all that much between even broadly related organisms.  Any random human and chimpanzee will have a little above 98% matching DNA, and any two random humans on the planet average about 99.5% match. A child with two parents of the same race could very conceivably have an absolute match percentage above 99.9%       That's some top tier autism.     mizuki comes back   turns out naruto just surprised him (also lol jinchuriki 2stronk) because he's actually powerful as fuck  I wanted it       early post-timeskip Sakura had a nice ass   she gets in green spandex   due to seeing Gai's wisdom she drops the bitchy attitude   starts fucking Lee   might even be useful for once in her life   fuck it, instead of slugs she summons turtles           and that was fake.  I think that interview was in reference to the confession to Sasuke before he left the village      Shikamaru and Temari hang out too, and Naruto asks if it's a date.   They said it wasn't. Years later, Shikamaru realizes that he had been dating the Temari since he was 12.   comfy          early post-timeskip Sakura had a nice ass  She had no ass. She's never had an ass.      parent DNA and child DNA are 99.99% identical.  It's definitely above 99% on an absolute basis, but 99.99% is probably a bit high excluding cases of incest.   A pair of graphs that are 99.99% identical would look pretty much the same.  DNA analysis doesn't bother to look at the genes that everybody already has in common. custom enzymes are used to cut DNA at well-defined sequence match points chosen on the genes that are most commonly of interest.   you're conflating test confidence intervals with actual gene sequence similarity rates. "99.99% confident" just means it was probably the right mom and dad but could have been like an abnormally genetically close sibling of the presumed parent who actually had the kid.             I'm not a Sakurafag, hell, I fucking hate her character, but even I recall that some panels (Sasori fight?) did show her off pretty nicely. By no means does she have an hourglass figure and her ass got flat as fuck eventually, but early on she did have it.     Its was.     Sounds incredibly cringe-inducing.  Source?        DNA analysis doesn't bother to look at the genes that everybody already has in common.   custom enzymes are used to cut DNA at well-defined sequence match points chosen on the genes that are most commonly of interest.  But that's Naruto and Kishi most likely doesn't give a fuck about the thing actually works.       But that's Naruto and Kishi most likely doesn't give a fuck about the thing actually works.  Once again you went with "what I believe is true because I read Kishi's mind". Look, Kishi said Sakura is Karin's child. This might change next week but it stays true for now. Any suggestion that "Kishi is a hack" is just groundless without evidence.       Sakura is Karin's child.  What?     Think anon meant Sarada     Look, Kishi said Sakura is Karin's child.  He also said Tobi was Madara.      He also said Tobi was Madara.  And if you know what he is thinking then so be it. But it is one matter to say "anything can happen", and yet another matter entirely to say "anything can happen, so I already know the future".  Saying "Kishi is a bad writer" does not support your argument, because you are openly declaring that your argument had no basis whatsoever.        But Kishimoto might have researched enough to know a DNA analisys it's pretty defintite.   Hell most people know that already as a general common fact.        He is already a bad writer, we are just waiting he doesn't sink a new low     he wrote Tobi saying he was Madara  Fixed.     Except he didn't. He wrote Tobi said he was Madara even though he provided plenty of hints that proved the opposite.     &gt;He also said Tobi was Madara.   I must not have cared enough about that debate back then, but I thought it was Kishi making Tobi say a poor attempt to lie about him being Madara when at the same time putting evidence he was obviously someone else?  It does not feel like in this case. Unless he puts an asspull next week, many things point out that Karin is Sarada's biological mother.         YFW we get no resolution on who her mother is.     It wouldn't surprise me.  Hypothetically speaking, In order to avoid the SasuSakufags to go full chimping out, he doesn't outright say it, but still leaves it ambiguous enough because he clearly wanted her to have Uzumaki heritage.  Or he could do it like with Karin herself: make her use a characteristical Uzumaki technique, but never outright saying she's an Uzumaki, even though she obviously is.        Horrible zombie Coolest Guy hand.  It got better though. He really doesn't need the bandage anymore. Probably keeps it as a reminder with his third gay experience with the Sauce.       He really doesn't need the bandage anymore  ?    So this arc is ending very soon, what next? chunin exam?  Is team 7 the new Sannin?    why are they making sarada shit?         The thing I'm mad about is that that punch is Kishi's dumb, hamfisted way of saying that Sakura is going to be the Salad mom at the end of all this. I kinda figured it would go down that way, but I still had a sliver of hope that Pinkshit really did get ultra cucked.    next is movie, this is a lead up to it.     but I still had a sliver of hope that Pinkshit really did get ultra cucked.  That require Sasuke deliberately wanting to fuck Karin, and we both know that is impossible.      They didn't attach an arm, they gave him a white zetsu arm, which in itself is bullshit cause we know he can regenerate body parts.  source: Kakashi's eye        I'm of those who want Sarada's to be Karin's, but I don't think Sasuke would have deliberatly cheated Sakura for it.  The most reasonal option is her being a test tube baby.        He stopped doing that after running low on the 9 beasts chakra remember? By the end of their fight and to now we've not seen Naruto use Ten-Paths and just be in his ordinary tailed beast sage mode but in dad form.     He mentions the way he does it is that he takes one part of Kakashi's body and makes an eye out of it somehow. Say it takes some skin tissue or fat here and there or whatever, converts those cells into stem cells via ninja magic, makes an eye out of them really fast. With something small like an eye I could sort of see how you could pull it off. A whole limb however is a whole other scale. Unless it's stated somewhere he did it bit by bit over a long-ass time, I don't see it happening.      What if Neji had survived the war?   Salad's character will be fine but the Gaiden will be completely fucking pointless.  Anyway, with the movie and game coming out soon, it hardly matters. I just want to see the resolution to this whole cuck fiasco (if there is any) and see the kids' graduation.     Any word on the moveset for Salad? I need any kind of jobbing confirmation    Presumable he'd be head of ANBU or something.    And what she can do about it?    Salad pls go    Yes, but Araki could give less of a fuck.    Comical Woman beatings The strongest Plot Armor piercing element in all fiction.      Burrito and Salad  Does this mean we'll get to play as Dadruto and Mamanata?    when everything started to go wrong?   He could? Weird. I thought he couldn't.    it's not even on the right angle    Sakura being a shit Then I think Kishi tried to make Karin unlikable and it all backfired     It's a pretty decent sized crater. Last one I remember of that size was from Tsunade's axe kick.  If she uses her Sharingan wisely she could be quite deadly. Pink Shit's biggest problem is that she sucked at dodging and was kinda slow, which the Sharingan helps with.  But somehow she's still the weakest of her team. We know what Bort can do, all that's left is Mitsuki D. Luffy.        Well she's not likeable either. Considering she is as bad as Karin.    Salad is wearing one, too.     was kinda slow, which the Sharingan helps with  Explicitly stated not to be the case when Sausage faced off against Lee before the exams.     Mizuki-tier. Which basically means Sakura is the weakest fucking character in the franchise now.  His edgy arm was kinda neat.      Didn't the fox kill his parents?     Still one tomoe   Why are women in Naruto such underachievers?      He's pretty weak, characters like Lee or sharinganless Kakashi could probably beat him.     That's Salad's umbilical cord. She was born there   she was born in Orochimaru's secret lair   the first thing she saw on this earth was creepy snake Michael Jackson try to hold her       How many Tomoe did Obito have when he was Chuunin?     Sakura isn't even the focus of this ad  And I'm pretty fucking sure she's a default character.      Mizuki-tier. Which basically means Sakura is the weakest fucking character in the franchise now.   attracting razor sharp blades to your arm with gravity    Not a smart plan.        Obito   Chuunin      Movie is next. It deals with Burrito's daddy issues, the new Chuunin Exams and the threat greater than Kaguya who are some pair of rabbit faggots called Momo and Kin.     He mentions the way he does it is that he takes one part of Kakashi's body and makes an eye out of it somehow  So Kakashi is missing a testicle now?     Pic related wouldn't have happened.    Maybe he takes a bunch of cells from each organ or something.    It's okay, anon. Standards for Hokage have been in the dumps since Tsunade.    Two  Well Kakashi was a jonin, right? They wouldn't keep him in a squad with genin      I think Kakashi got promoted so fast because it was a time of war and they needed more jonin. Judging by Kakashi Gaiden he wasn't ready to take the lead of a group, it was a bad call.    None, he had just unlocked it before he "died"    What if  Himawari was the one who destroyed the cake?    do you think there will be a part 3?   For what? To get bolt to stop yelling?       http://www.mangastream.to/naruto-ch<wbr>apter-242-page-17.html He had 2. He also started at 2, because Kakashi mocked him the previous day for not having a Sharingan. </wbr>       isn't the number of tomoe based around genetics and trauma? she was excited to see her day so I think it's fair if she had 1. now if sakura were to die in this arc then it would makes since for her to have 2. three is reserved for some one close to you.    Source?    Maybe the argument was upsetting her? She's 6, remember?    now if sakura were to die in this arc then it would makes since for her to have 2  Actually if Pink died she'd probably shoot up to Mangekyou.         Standards for Hokage have been in the dumps since Tsunade.    Jesus Christ their dads dressed like clowns.   Depends on how well the Gaiden went over in Nipland. Also Kishi might just want to work on something different for a change. Not that I would not like to see some actually fun light-hearted ninja adventures with a cheeky little shithead tsundere for his dad, an adorable little girl with an absent father and the world's worst stepmother and Orochimaru Jr, but Kishi would either fuck up by introducing some big bad villain with even bigger super-duper powers than anyone else before him, or fuck about with no real story or meaning, ruining characters to pass the time.     what the fuck is this red fat monster    https://twitter.com/vupl4   The fuck is this and why is Bort on it?   Why is Bolt hanging out with that pasty faggot?     caring about Boludo     It was a different time, anon.    Both of their Dads had crappy childhoods and autism.    Maybe he should just leave it to one of his assistants. Like that guy who does the Springtime of Youth/Darkness spinoffs. Apparently Bort's getting his own issue.    Mitsuki is said to be a superior shinobi and Bolt is someone with great talent. They probably are sparring partners.      Or maybe that's what you get when you're raised by the state      If you were to take those off, would he die?    Dad thinks he needs to hang out with more kids his age, so he had Orochimaru whip up a quick play pal.     Cross dressing with uncle Neji    This is gonna be good.       caring about mini Sakura      tfw the Hyuga Palms were conceived as the ultimate molestation technique      At least obito took the chuunin exams, can't remember if they showed him graduating though     He and Rin had to be chunin. At the beginning of Kakashi Gaiden, Kakashi made a point to say that now that he was a jonin, Obito had to follow his orders. This implies they were of the same rank before, but not anymore.      Dad thinks he needs to hang out with more kids his age, so he had Orochimaru whip up a quick play pal.  Maybe he could be a surviving Onion clone?     No because we saw him at the beginning of the gaiden manga.   i thought /a/ hated naruto?? wtf is this?    Some soap opera     No because we saw him at the beginning of the gaiden manga.  Ah, there goes that theory.  But yeah, I am near willing to believe he is Orochimaru's "child". It makes perfect sense that Oro would create his own successor with SCIENCE.          Orochimaru made an orphan for Anko to remember him by        Orochimaru makes a kid   doesn't give it Sharingan      Is that from when Sauce is trying to murd- train him?     &gt;Orochimaru makes a kid   &gt;doesn't give it Sharingan  Well he didn't give HIMSELF Sharingan despite already being able to. So clearly he made a choice somewhere deciding he had something better?     How would Karin have her own umbilical coord? Even if her family kept such a thing, how would she find it after all these years and after her family died? Also, why have it? I wouldn't keep mine.    How would Karin have her own umbilical coord? Even if her family kept such a thing, how would she find it after all these years and after her family died? Also, why have it? I wouldn't keep mine.  The fact that you asked the final question meant you are ignorant of customs. Go and google.     Even if family customs are different why go through so much trouble to get your umbilical cord back?     Even if family customs are different why go through so much trouble to get your umbilical cord back?  It is a family charm. An an orphan she would clearly want to have something that connects to her dead mother.     holy shit its anko's son    are you seriously asking why a orphan would want keep a memento of her dead parents?     She got fat   Orochimaru left  Add one more shit tier parent to the list      No. All adult Uchiha were expect to have three tomoe. The Sharingan basically matures. One is infant, two is juvenile, three is adult; that is not to say that an infant Uchiha should have one tomoe.    Japanese parents give their kids their umbilical cords for certain special occasions - marriages, moving away permanently, etc to symbolize breaking away from your parents. Either Karin has Sarada's umbilical cord, which would mean she's the mother, or Karin has her own umbilical cord, given to her by her own mother, and the match would mean she's the mother.      implying that would be surprising at this point      unlocking Sakura    what kind of mother would Karin be anyway? She doesn't come of as heartless and can sense chakra-flow inside your heart / ass. She would know if she was hurting Saradas feelings.    She's an orphan. Salad would grow spoiled and hearing about how great Sauce was and how he defeated every great ninja ever.    It would be extremely out of character. I think he is more likely to fuck Hinata than Karin    So just like Sakura?    tfw Sakura is proven to be Salad's mother   tfw anti SS fags will get blown the fuck out   next week thursday can't come soon enough tbh      Thank you for saving my baby, have her umbilical cord.    That would actually be hilarious.    She would try to kill Salad so she can have Sasuke's love to herself.   so Sarada has healing bite?   She wouldn't try to hide shit about Sauce, because everything Sauce is positive for her. Also, as a sensor, Salad would remind her of the Sauce every time she looks at her. If Salad asks about her dad, she can probably pinpoint exactly where he is.  Literally mostly happy end.       &gt;tfw anti SS fags will get blown the fuck out  That's where you are wrong. We are not emotionally invested in Karin being the mum, we would simply lose interest if she isn't because then Salad would become boring as a character.     Sarada would be proof of her union with Sasuke that's why I don't think she is the mother because she would carry Sarada around like a trophy baby. Also it would be cruel to take her away. Unless she is dead which she doesn't seem to be     now instead of telling my daughter about you or inviting you over to visit I'm going to plaster my face on top of yours so I can fabricate a family photo with my husband who'd rather spend 12 years in a dank disgusting forest than see me      Also it would be cruel to take her away.  As if Sasuke cared about being cruel.    http://manga.redhawkscans.com/reade<wbr>r/read/nisekoi/en/0/176/  FUCKING DROPPED  </wbr>  WORRY NO MORE ABOUT FILLERS. WE HAVE JUST SUCCESSFULLY ENTERED AN ARC.   It's an arc filler, nobody cares about Yui.    I wonder if Yui's agent loli is cute under her garment.    She's like 50 years old, calm yourself.    But anon, she looks cute.   The wait for HS commences.     No new OP/ED this week.       The buttbros after gay marriage was legalized     its an abstract kind of wrong hole.jpg        Ulala    Her interactions with Souma are always cute.     Gokigenyo     Seriously? Why not?    Yugi would be CRAZY not to hit that.   Is Houjou paired with anyone?   Changing op/ed mid-arc is weird.    that reminds me, we never got the Generalissimo Meat pose.    If they don't change to the new ones next week, will they use Souma for the ED?   Shit I've been gone for about a week or two, when/why did hippo become hypo in these threads?   Megumi/Yugi.      one of these days I'll fuck your shit up    Megumi. Maybe Yugi if you're a fag.     not 'til elections arc, sadly.     Alice tries to Gokingeyou   fails miserably     I want to protect this smile.    I don't see the hippos   Because the current OP still has the egg flipping done by Souma. We'd most probably get it in 2 weeks.    That's during the elections.   Houjou isn't a man-hater per se, but she's touchy about guys at the moment due to negative experiences. She's still perfectly capable of being friendly though as we saw with Souma.        ASSETS OUT OF CONTAINMENT            Houjou isn't a man-hater per se, but she's touchy about guys at the moment due to negative experiences  She'd ride on Yugi's D so hard once he changes his mentality on Chink cuisine.     What a qt.      She looks hideous in the anime.    2cute4me. Alice best girl, as always.        We'll never get an Alice EDgasm face     dat ED intro was perfect, JC staff so based    IE SENPAI...     I want to think the new ed will have foodgasm faces.    deep down, she wants what all women do:  the approval of stern men        He shouldn't have been a cunt about only doing just shichuan cuisine he way he does it.     mangahere      Takumi needs to smile more and be less of tsundere fag      The manlet would break in two pieces tho.     i needed to pull up the image fast. sorry i don't have every chapter archived like an obsessive fag     shichuan  Do you even ching chong nip nong? Souma would probably be the one to make him change his ways, &amp; in the process, match-make the shorty with her.       manlet   tall, strong, manly girl  It just fits.       not using Casanova's SnS page  http://casanovascans.com/series/sho<wbr>kugeki_no_soma/</wbr>    Stalker   damn    oh look, no colour    She looks like a fucking monkey. Way to ruin best girl JC Shit.     Its written in the stars. Calling it now - Yugi &amp; Houjou to hook up later on.    gokigenyo   Sharp eyes.      that does NOT look like 50 meters...    I agree. I expected much better from them, especially from an attractive character like Alice. They've let themselves down, after all the good work they have put in so far, with regards to the character designs.   hishoko a best    DAT FUCKING ASS     was promised delicious nakahara mai voice for delicious nakiri alice   get shit voice instead to go with shitty animation  fuck you JC Staff, why do I always let you trick me     Nice dubs. Also,  ...       WEEWOOWEEWOO  HYPO ON THE LOOSE      They're allocating more of their resources to Hestia a Bestia.   I would like this version of Megumi  Alice made me rip the skin.    J.C Staff wants to be fanservice   But his source material won't let him    I know, let's make the outfit super skin tight with buttons on the nipples   Ends up looking like a hippo again         If she was like that she would have been best girl.    I think that might be what some people find appealing about the idea.     strike gold with one series   drop the ball on the series that is platinum in order to maximize gold profits  full retard      dang right      Like I said in the previous thread her "inner iris rings" should have been lighter, she looks kind of scary now since it's all red/pink  It seems they took cues from her first appearance, not her current one. Hair is OK        She's going to fuck him with a strap-on.     wait, is ryouko supposed to be the sukeban there? cause megumi's design here looks more fitting to that role.     They're all delinquents there    yes, and?   megumi pleases old men with food  They ruined Alice.  Thought they would finish the breakfast thing in one episode.   For free    Are you retarded?    OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOH    are YOU?   no screencaps of Kurokiba?  So how is SnS doing in Japan? Is it projecting to be a popular manga that might be one of WSJ's staples in the coming years along with upcomers like BnH? (especially that Naruto is over and all)  Erina-sama kakkoii    The doujins write themselves     No, that was a sufficient answer to your first question.    Sasuga Erina-sama    I remember Shigatsu.      Sorry, Erina is already the market leader of pleasing old men for taste approvals.      Aniki! It has always been top 5 jump material, &amp; the anime boosted sales of the latest volume.     I doubt that, Satan    Here, have rankings:     It's from that one page in the manga (I don't have it on hand) where Ryouko was also the sukeban, iirc they were walking down a hallway intimidatingly together with Ryouko in front. The other image with Megumi as the sukeban over 4 other guys is from a completely different page, but it seems they took Megumi's design from that page instead to use in this scene, which is why it's confusing.    Oh alright, I didn't remember the first time that happened.    inb4 "I was only pretending to be retarded!"            Oh hey notJun.     Why is he pissing from his head?     O-Oh my.    I want alice to terrify my meat     Climax in Erina's mouth after magnificent blowjob   Her reaction when you skipped a daily citrus fruit serving, resulting in less tangy semen      JUST FUCK  already       gokigenyo<br/>    forgot image  post ruined     that was a great transition.    watching Shokugeki no Souma without fanservice    He asked who the sukeban is, not whether they are all delinquents, your reply answered nothing.    good. the ED is so soothing, I can never skip it I just want to float away on clouds~~     But sukebans are delinquents you idiot.    EGAO GA AREBA   But I wanted a new OP/ED    Her anime eyes make her look too much like a vampire.  Her revised manga eyes look different, I dunno, fey or elvish          I'm still catching up with the manga (at Stagiare now) but does the anime tie that phrase with Erina? I can't tell much with the manga, obviously.       Its anime-original.    A sukeban is a female delinquent leader.    Treasure what you have now in case the new ones are worse    No, it isn't, she and Alice use this phrase in the manga.      Thank you based Staff.      Alice introduction is QUALITY ep  Heh    I think of it as Erina's "IIE SENPAI", her and Yukina have the same VA after all.    One whole cour to go, and it's unlikely they will begin the tournament arc now   New episode Soon  new chapter raws also out   captain a cute    Nee-chan  ;_;    I hate to inform you of this kid but your nee-chan was a stuck up cunt who didn't want to be partners with the hero of this manga.    Nurse Kobayashi is a beauty    Yamano family is a lower class and Eiko worked her way to become a pilot only to see a dude from underground getting fasttracked.    so Capt's cosplaying as a medic this time again?    So the plot is still going nowhere    She isn't this time, working as an emergency nurse under captain uniform, no mask.      yep   truly the best girl    Am I the only one who thinks she looks terrible with her hair down?     Tomboy captain best captain   Nihei wants to sell it so badly.   Looks like it'd hold an onahole.     you will never be able to buy your own Sasaki from MHz     Spotted this during the first glance as well. It does look nice but this is kinda shameless plug.    The spirit of capitalism has found him.    You can buy a bear instead.     /m/ translation done, typesetting etc in progress but there's a readable script on googledocs. <br/>      Then they should've made better looking THI hoodies in white, green, pink and purple.    Nice to see Captain doing field works when her people need the most.  But no more immortal secrets?      Where do I buy this?    here  http://m-hz.net/?pid=90156386     so its confirmed for a timeskip then?    no? it's right after the battle       New episode Soon  10 hours to go...     And then 3 days for subs    i don't get it, i see the episode every friday with subs  with spanish subtitles    Hey I just started season 2 what the hell is this miniature thing?  Pic related 1/2      that tentacle up her ass  I never noticed     2/2    That's Ochiai's waifu    Ah I see...  Is there any real explanation or no? I'm looking at the wiki and theres no info      Read the manga, faggot.    I will after the current season ends.   Which one should I download, and is the 1080 just an upscale?     That's just Bestgirl, anon. Don't worry about it.    Read the manga you colossal faggot         Well tanikaze finally gets his true waifu.     $32 for a fucking thermos  The fuck is this?     Both TV and BD. BD has different angles.    Hopefully its truly made for space to justify its price     2D books      nolan pls     Anon, I don't understand what you mean.    Even if she was a bit cunt, she didn't deserve to die. She could be a good tsundere-type member of Tanikaze harem.    surprised she even got noted again    there are people here who would reject the clone of their dead waifu just because she's made of placenta  You people are horrible.    she's a gauna not your waifu    Well meme'd, my friend.    Pity Beni didn't get superior Tanikaze genes.  But then probably the Gauna would've been made invincible.     fuckin' delusional hoshijirofags man   every thread without fail   is a season 3 already announced?   BeniJiro returns   has Hoshijiro's personality and memories   has a split personality   switches to seductive, near-yandere Benisuzume once in a while   mfw        Do want.   New chapter in an hour, right before the stream at latest.   Sadly no.    what are they doing there? saying good bye?    Sales are shit. No S3    Why don't they just sell fucking GBEs    Looked like sales were pretty good last I saw. It was something like 19th this season for all anime at that point.     half of what S1 made   good      You are not alone, anon.   Is yucie dead? Where did the stream go?     To cc   Sidonia threads are so fucking dead it's not even funny.   I'm gonna miss these threads after the season's over. God damn it guys, don't leave me.     Yeah, it's too bad but I guess there really isn't all that much to talk about. It's not one of those stories where you've got no idea what's going on.    Well, now that season 2 ends, they'll probably only get rarer. Doesn't help that the manga is monthly. There's rarely much to discuss.    We will have less frequent threads, but that hopefully means the ones we will have will be better.   I just gotta say the previous episode made my dick diamonds. It's been awhile since I was so excited watching anime.   I sure am expecting the next episode to make my dick diamonds.    This coming episode would break a diamond.    Almost everything has been talked, and Sidonia is not as shippers-friendly as other shows so there are not many shipperfags to drive threads up.  Kinda sad but that's the cycle of it.     GBE is firing today  How closely does the series follow the manga? Are there any crucial details that have been skipped over?  This has definitely sky rocketed to the top of my favorites. Makes me booty blasted there isn't more shit like this.     Didn't cc stop working?    Everything good was skipped. Read the fucking manga, you lazy asshole.   As usual, if you'll see anything fucked up or can think of better phrasing, tell me right away.   No. Was fired back to the basement     First three volumes of manga are free on Amazon right now (2048px).    I know I shouldn't ask for this, but can anyone tell me how to find the Douyu stream? I have no idea what to look for on the site. Otherwise, I'd be fine with any other working stream. Aside from Yucie, the one's I know don't seem to be in use.   Check the archive.            I've participated in just about every thread in the last 2 months and I don't remember anyone mentioning any other streams aside from the ones I already know. Besides, there's only a few minutes left. I know it's a lot to ask, but couldn't you help out an anon for once?  ;_;       You should be able to find it in those few minutes.    Well, I've been looking and I can't. I'm desperate here, man.         tfw I can just copy a link while Angela is playing here  Nah, no spoonfeeding man, gotta respect that board culture          That fucking tea commercial    KITAAAAAA   is that from one of the newer chapters? I stopped following a month or two ago   AH AH AH SIDONIA  And it's lagging as usual.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127209381  Gives me nothing. Fucking hell.      Man. This new Horihone Saizou manga isn't as good as his others.       Oh shit, vag flowers!    HOLY FUCK, THEY ARE ENDING THE ANIME     They are taking over Lem IX anyway, so this still makes sense.       Those 80's-hair-kun and pony-tails-chan again.  Fucking hell. My dick was so ready. Now I have to wait for the raw.    Original anime shit once again doesn't make much sense. What was all that tension in the previous ep if they can just sent all the forces in no time?        End it with Blame!  where the fuck is the live stream?   They just have gauna getting wiped out of IX in one shot. Why not?    douyu    Man, that Sidonia stump floating through space looks so fucking sad.   CONGRATULATION ENDING   It doesn't help that the manga is slow as fuck right now So much shit happened on a single chapter of blame, or abara or biomega or at the beggining of knigths of sidonia But right now it's fucking sloooow     Fucking lazy reuse of scenes   Couldn't he have gotten out of those? Or does Kunato not know about the artificial kabi blades embedded throughout Tsugumori that can be launched for this exact purpose?    At least they managed to patch it up. Just imagine if they couldn't have done that.   Will there be a season 3?  Welp, the last ep sucked bear's balls   In this page, some lines are out of position.   Jesus, original ending incoming   that doesn't help much there's over 1000 channels. I'd never be able to find it in time. Just give the stream #.   Pfhahahahaha, no S3 for you. Sidonia dies with S2   Huh. Maybe they weren't separated properly in the script or something. I'll fix it soon.     not raising your elbow so forearm is aligned to a straight hand facing outwards.  0/10 terrible salute Shamfur Dispray!!! commit seppuku      Sol and penis killed Sidonia   dont forget, you have your own little tsumugi between your legs as a reminder.   Decent ending, all things considered. They didn't cover Kunatochiai going "What do you mean, I don't get to fuck both Enajiros?" to Sasaki, but hopefully it'll be on the BD version.  wooh did anybody screencap that yure+izana poster at the end??   He might not know about that, actually.    Kunato a shit.   so, no season 3?  Cooking has started. That's it. No S3   I expected him to die this time, but Nihei pussied out. Them being cool and all didn't work either.    Kunato can't die until he's finally made up slightly for being such a massive fuckup and kills Cloneochiai with his bear hands.  Accept it, anon.     nothing about Kanata (the new chimera) ?   Never    But Clonechiai haven't done anything wrong.   So who was responsible for killing Sidonia?  Tsumugi   inexperienced Hiroyuki Seshita   jews and no money      whick BD has more of Blame!?   He'd better sell some honokas.    They did 'read manga to know more' ending    Season 3 confirmed. They said they wait Nihei to end his work and they are currently busy with Ajin Movies so the announcement will not be made at the end of the episode.    It's a nice way to say "no S3, sorry"    No it's pretty old. How do you manage to forget that scene   nop, there is 3 movies for Ajin so S3 probably late next year.   He kinda did. See posts above.     Oichai clone standing like nothing happen    Just kill me.   they actually animated those vergina flower    Best girl won.    Actually best girls won.     princess carry the alien princess with your headless mecha  Loved that scene in the manga.     i hope she die soon   Alright, mangafriends, I need to know. How far "ahead" is the manga? Is it far enough that we'd get a season 3? Do you think the anime is successful enough to warrant a season 3?  I'm an animefag at the moment, but if I'm not going to be getting my weekly fix of sidonia through the anime, I might have to switch to the manga. They fucking blueballed me with SnK, and I haven't started the manga for that yet  mostly because I don't really like the manga's art style, but I like sidonia's manga's style , I won't be able to deal with not seeing a new season for either of them.     Come on Nihei, hurry up and finish Sidonia so we can see what you got ready for us next.  inb4 he goes on hiatus      hating Tsumugi      No tentacle tongue     Yes, fuck you and your beloved dick abomination.    only if you fill it with Tsumigi being "cute" and if we get a season 3, i really wish that they skip a bit of it    Didn't he announce that he was working on that one thing, with no information other than a title? It was called "android *something*". It was quite a while ago.     hating Tsumugi so hard      inb4 he goes on hiatus  it is a fucking monster who smells like shit for traveling all the time on those pipes, at least it could take the form of a qt monster girl but instead we get a 3 km penis who acts like a retard and sounds like rubber     249 and 167, for some reasons, stayed alive for the whole season.    Love the extra Hoshijiro service they had there.   Season 3 when?    hoshijiro shitting everything up from beyond the grave   Nagate completely forgets about Izana   Being an Izanafag is suffering.       because they want to photosynthesi together    There was, among other things.   When will we have another cool SciFi anime?   better romance than Nagata harem    I'm just about ready to see Nihei put the icing on Izana's suffering cake.    Ajin anime is soon     those tiny THI logos   I once tried a drinking game where I would take a shot every time a THI logo appeared on screen (the same logo on the same object in two shots doesn't count, though) and I gave up about ten minutes in. I could have died from alcohol poisoning.      when people see the selling point of mecha highschool girl        the mechs are women   Regular mechs make me hard. Bio-mechs do it too. You would think mechs that look like qt highschool girls would be extra boner, but for some reason this is an anti-boner.       Isn't this shit full of gore?   CONGRATULATION!     They aren't real girls, just soldiers with PTSD.     Why did they show us Kanata and Kunato (Ochai) seiing the battle between Tsumu and Beni if they don't plan to do a season 3?   Season 3 eventually, friend. It's like Fafner Exodus S2. These things... they take time.     isn't KOS full of smell fetish and genitals    So they can come back later, and claim that upon popular demand, they decided to make one more season,  which might not be the final one either.     It is. Joshi Kouhei just turns that up a notch.  It is not a bad thing but I don't think it will be animated any times soon.       167  Note that this dude managed to survive the last battle of S1 as well. The man is like the no-name hero.     Is the manga worth picking up if I'm a Hoshijirofag?   the mango is 10 time more glorious    Yeah but I dont want to start reading it if they're just going to keep Hoshijiro in a cage forever again    She gets Gaunafied early in the manga too.  Seems Benny has even been forgotten about.      if you like black and white stuff    Speaking as one of the original, surviving, enduring Hoshijirofags who has to put up with abuse from every other newage faction, yeah.   Get used to it.       read the mango and you will relise how awesome captaint is and forget Hoshijiro    If he was one of the handful who survived THAT, he's the baddest of redshirts.   I want to be punched by Sasaki.   Izana and Yure take a selfie.     Sasaki will never suffocate you with her Sasakis     Better version.     better  Your waifu2x abomination looks like shit.    Service Club's first request, its biggest request, and its final request The grand finale is about to come  Welcome to Yahari thread, enjoy your stay         sage     Just look at him, no need to kill     WA2 OP   Fuck off, brainfucked retard      When I look at him I see 8man. They're basically the same character minus the social standing.   I want to kill this fucking cunt.   Good night, hope this proper thread will make it.      Now that's alpha.     How many times must we do this   Where are the fucking subs      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O8X<wbr>fV8aPAyQ</wbr>  [ ]  waiting for subs    Going off to gym bros   Just give up man, this is Commie's most ebin meme yet! They're going to delay the subs until god knows when or just not release it. Watch the raw, you'll figure most of it out anyway.    look at all that POWDER    edition       Why did we need a new thread? Since there is nothing to talk about other than "subs when?". Should have just waited till the subs were out and made a fresh thread then.   This anime made me lust after genuine things, not replicas and fairy tales.   But subs are already out    They're waiting for CR subs since Commie staff apparently is infected with a serious case of anal flu for trying to copy HS   Who else thinks that Yukino isn't actually in love with 8man?  Brothers?   good for you     &gt; Trying to deny the obvious   You're fun anon      hai!    She still likes Hayama.    Nothing about that bitch is genuine.   Singles and CR will release before commie   Some die-hard NTR fags and Hayato worshipers, and a handful number of retards who're actually suffering some serious reading comprehension issue  And then you know they will keep spewing same bullshit even after the series is over so who cares?      No one   Reminder that she will never ara ara~ at your dick and put her yuis to good use.   Genuine photoshop?    Doubles and there's no subs till monday.    Yukino has no feelings for 8man Iroha's feelings are not genuine  Am I doing this right?       Why do you need subs anyway, when all the key moments of volume 11 that are on anime have been scanned and translated already?       Iroha's feelings are not genuine  Iroha is falling for 8man in the most genuine way possible    WHERE THE FUCK ARE SUBS WHAT THE FUCK    I don't. I saw stream.    https://d.maxfile.ro/xwkbmrkjkw.web<wbr>m  If she had actually given us an "ara ara" in the episode I'd be dead right now.  How can 8man pick anyone but Yui knowing he'll have this to look forward to in a few more years?    </wbr>    lurk more    What, you mean by always pretending that she just wants his help to snag the Cunt?    Are all Irohafags this new?   Good Irohasu, everyone!  What is 8man trying to show us, /a/?   Blank paper.    I wish Yuimom had Black Hair    An exploitable meme.   Yukino - Linkin Park, shoegaze Yui - pop, chart music Iroha - boybands Sensei - dadrock 8man - emo, punk Haruno - indie rock, experimental Komachi - EDM Orimoto - pop rock, pop punk Saki - classical, jazz Saika - trap Ebina - metal, goregrind Miura - j-pop              Do you really think 8man is going to base on who he's going to pick based on looks, especially on what they might look like in the future?  He wants something genuine.     Commies translation status    Yukino totally listens to classical stuff     Out before FFF's.     Commie still being lazy shits   Where are those subs from that "only for the desperate" guy?     Well fff just released episode 4. They could catch up, you never know    Their mom&amp;daughter interaction is so sweet it's poisonous to me.   Is sensei really a japanese teacher? All she does is sperg over 90s anime, I think I've seen/read her talk about actual japanese literature like twice. The worst thing is she has shit taste, liking scryed and all.   Yukino need to see a psychologist, not involved in romance   Then why is she always shoegazing?    your brothers are long dead   So  8man  Wants something "genuine" but doesn't really know what that is. He probably seeks a friendship where everyone can be themselves, no facades at all. They can't.  Yui  I honestly can't remember why she even started hanging out with Yuki and 8man in the first place. Apparently she likes 8man now?  Yukino  Wants to stop chasing after her sister and become her own thing. Sadly, she's now chasing after 8man and doesn't realize it. Her mother is a bitch. Her sister is a bigger bitch.  Hayama  A cunt. Wants to maintain the status quo because reasons.  Irohas  Wanted the Hayama D, but couldn't get it. Now she just wants senpai's attention, but won't admit it.  Haruno and her fujoshi friend  Want to maintain the status quo of their group at the cost of the feelings of their members.  Did I get it right? I can't remember shit from S1, so I'll start reading the novels this weekend. Apparently, they skipped a lot of stuff.                  Implying music taste has anything to do with personality.  I'm pretty sure 8man's taste is diverse, he has 5-6 years to diversify his taste    Subs when?   I bet 8man listens to idolshit    Haruno did nothing wrong. She's a good sister who wants Yukino to stop being copy-pastenon     &gt;Yui   I honestly can't remember why she even started hanging out with Yuki and 8man in the first place. Apparently she likes 8man now?  I think its something about a dog.        You got most of shit wrong.    Hayama one is wrong, cunt  And did Haruno have a fujoshi friend?      Treats everyone like shit   "She just wants to help!"  Well, she's not doing a good job.       Irohas  Easiest way to spot a secondary     Shit, that was supposed to be Miura, not Haruno.  Haruno a shit.       &gt;Treats everyone like shit  Apparently exposing Yukino's dependency problem is bad now.     Orimoto is totally the girl from those old iPod commercials     Treats everyone like shit  Nice fanon. She is hard on 8man and Yukino. That's it.      LN gets translated   Suddenly, anyone who didn't bother reading them is a filthy secondary and no anime-only discussion is allowed  No, fuck you.  You don't go to fucking Rokujouma or Mondaiji threads complaining about secondaries; you just discuss what you know.       Holy shit. Really? That was a fucking joke. It felt like a shitty filler episode.    fuck you man fuck I didn't save the edited one     ? Ellen Feis?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l2-<wbr>UuIEOcss</wbr>  [ ]       Blogshit    There is no love triangle, there is no love triangle.   Romance isn't part of the story, Yui has given up on it and Yukino doesn't love 8man.     FTFY     Opinion on anime   blog  Guess this whole board is a blog now.      Of course the idiot who gets names wrong is the guy who actually falls for it when Haruno plays the villain.    ok   I knew this would happen. 8man didn't choose anyone in the end.  Also, Iroha isn't even in the episode.       "she's only PRETENDING to be a cunt, guys!"    Thank you     TLfag   I want to kill this cunt   IROHA OR DEATH  Are you?       Setsuna did everything wrong; she deserved it.  Yui hasn't done anything wrong!      you drunk?    Unlike Yukino Kazusa was an actual villain in her series.    IROHA AKBAAAAR     Wants to help her sister   Has to act like a bitch to do so   Nope, there's no other, more gentle way to do it!   Her sister fucking hates her guts now   "But guys, she's just trying to help!"  She should look for better ways or just don't bother at all.         Yes, that's what the author constantly points out. Are you retarded?     Setsuna did everything wrong; she deserved it   What did she do wrong?      I think my favorite was the brown haired girl from ww   Which volume/chapter have Yui moments?  I just want to read Yui moments and feel fuzzy inside.     I should go and watch that. I could probably download and finish all of it before subs come out.    I actually am    She manipulated her friends so she could get the D. Didn't you watch the last two episodes?  She knew everything that was going on but played innocent.        Volume 7    Apparently they share the same director   Anon subs pls  The world needs you now      She should look for better ways or just don't bother at all  Yeah, letting her spend the rest of her life as a spineless, parroting autist who can't even properly function in a theme park is less evil than hurting her precious feelings.     It's one of the few romance anime of the last years that are actually good.   what's the best romance anime of the past 5 years?    describing neuroses resulting from previous efforts at "helping"   stop trying to fix shit that isn't broken, Haruno. you're not any good at it.      He likes Yukino so that's a given.    Nisekoi.    I'm disappointed in my old self for thinking this series was something special.    Natsuyasumi   What are the chances Yui gets heart shaped pupils if 8man started putting moves on her?    describing neuroses resulting from previous efforts at "helping"  I don't even     Fireworks in Vol 4,5,. Alone time with Hikki in 8. Destinyland in 9. Aquarium/cookies in 11  All I can think of at the moment      Very bad shows in general, but I would say White Album 2 is really decent compared to others.    How about actually being constructive instead of just putting them down and making them feel like shit. That isn't helping them overcome their issues, that's just making them doubt what they have.  Even if she is just "pretending" to be an asshole, her way of "helping" them is still terrible. Sensei helps Hikki by giving him advice and setting him on the right path, whle also not completely coddling him and just doing everything for him. She helps the three grow through their issues. Haruno just walks up to them and goes "WOW LOOK AT THESE RETARDS CAN'T EVEN GENUINE LOL"      She wanted the D and saw that her friend is also wants the same D. So when there is chemistry between those two sparkle she quickly made a move to develop the relationship with the person she loved. And the person she loved agreed to it. I don't see anything wrong with that. Love is a competition ans usually wins the more brave one. That's how alfas get the girls while that omega normies who aren't blessed with 2D waifu are mopping, sulking and getting stuck in the friend zone. The only one who did everything wrong was MC who agreed to everything while loved another girl and cheated on his gf with her friend.    Was it wrong as you expected?  There are similiarities yeah but plot wise Oregairu is better than the mess WA2 became.   Never really got why people though Oregairu was groundbreaking; its a very well written series but it embraces tropes all the fucking time         WA2   Mess  I don't see any mess in this series. It's not that good, but I think is quite well done. Explain.      Fuck off    White Album 2.     omega normies  fuck off     You know it's true.    Okay, but not chitoge, fuck off pls    You can't name a single show that's better than Nisekoi faggot    But chitoge is best girl    no the white silhouettes with the colorful backgrounds    shitoge      All I can say is Touma looks way better than Yukino     speaking suspiciously like a 12 year old girl.  underage b&amp; nao      shittaste      chitoge   best girl   when Marika exists  Nope.       I disagree   who /skeleton/ here?   Literally any other show    Nisekoi is better than literally any other show, so checkmate    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O8X<wbr>fV8aPAyQ</wbr>  [ ]    That's fallacy    It's much worse than 虚無戦史MIROKU    Nisekoi S2.     I ready my chips but there are still no subs, how is it?   Regardless of tropes, I liked it better when it was The 8man Show.   where are the subs where are my fucking subs    I suspect skiddicks read the retarded anon filing a formal complain post      I feel sorry for you and your shit taste, anons.     commie what the fuck  1. Chitoge 2. Yui 3. Haru 4. Tsugumi 5. Iroha 6. Saki 7. Haruno 8. Sensei 9. Everyone else Power Gap  9999. Yukino 10000. Onodera               What have you done    Swap 1 with Marika and im okay with this   Commie I will NEVER download your subs again.   It's interesting how watching Nisekoi correlates with shit taste    is there any Iroha in it?    this    but Yukino was at the bottom where she belongs   HS when?   Commie are Irohafags  Deliver the subs bastards.    You're looking in the wrong medium if you want good romance.  WA2 is arguably the best though, followed by Yahari.      I bet you watch Nisekoi    Anon, what the fuck    Yukino should swap place with Onodera.   Toradora is objectively the best romcom of recent times.  Orange Road is superior, though.      You see Yukinoshita, this is how it's going to be     Agreed.    CC becomes a bit of a mess since they get hit pretty hard with some common dorama and k-drama cliches.   Girl leaves for different country because muh love pains   Girl decides to come back to 'settle her feelings' despite everyone knowing the truth   Drama ensues as everything starts getting fucked again   Introducing 3 heroines was also pretty unnecessary and takes away from the main story. Coda was decent though - too bad CC wasn't as focused.           Toradora   Not Nisekoi       Iroha's dead     Yes I do. I love harems, which is why I watch nisekoi and oregairu   Can't wait for the final episode! :)   theres no romance in nisekoi     Eh? Take responsibility?   I don't I'm the one you should be asking.      Then you have shit taste. Congrats   This series wasn't really a harem until Iroha got introduced.  Can I sue commie for this?   thread is now about nisekoi, wa2 and whatnot   Amazing how waiting for memesubs can affect people.     Read the LNs.     the theme of the series is wanting something genuine so desperately   not even the series itself is genuine       Shall I dump?      Dump Pan-san     Two girls aren't a harem. You don't count sensei.      love triangles end up with someone losing   Big surprise huh?      I would like compensation for their unprofessional behavior.   What does /a/ think of Black Lagoon.  /a/ hates everything.  Pretentious garbage for idiot normie faggots  It's a fun girls and guns anime with a decent MC and it brought us best maido.  Shit is on point, but fuck Tex-Mex.  Being black lagoon fan is suffering.  I think the sub is better.  Pretty good.  I want Balalaika to call me names and hit me while I fuck her.     Should of been a hentai OVA   2edgy4u shit  New chapter never.   It's great. Stick to the dub, tho.   Would watch if it was about the trap.   muh westernized chinese cartoons   I liked it. It was silly, and had some fun, over the top characters. Balalaika best.    I also really liked Roberta's Blood Trail, but mostly because Rock went full evil genius      Shits cool and it has the cutest girls.   I think Hiroe should stop drawing porn.    Pls Hiroe, at least finish the current arc.   introduced me to anime   This. It's what I use to introduce folks. Very easy to get into.    New scans fucking when ? Hiroe said he had come back    Go away newfag.     that filename   implying other options  post it.     Funny thing is that most anime I like is surreal, weird, artsy stuff and cyberpunk/sci-fi anime. I also never liked 80/90s action movies, even as a kid. But when I watched this I loved it, basically it made me realize that I have a think for girls that can kick ass.   http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=list&amp;tags=sawyer_the_cleaner<wbr></wbr></wbr>    I swear. There's so many anime that won't commit to having a girl kick ass and have her start jobbing at the last minute. I like that Black Lagoon is better at keeping the character's badassness consistant.    Good for its time.  Now it's just edgey.        While Black Lagoon does have plenty of girls that kickass, Revy is my least favorite.  While all of them are super unrealistic, at least Sawyer/Shenhua/Roberta/Balalaika seem to have style or grace to what they're doing. Revy just walks up to solders armed with assault rifles with her two pistols and shoots them before they can get a shot off.   In this clip she literally doesn't move anything except her trigger finger. https://<span>youtu.be/L3Lb_ElIeSI?t=1m37<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]  Also her constant bickering with Rock is unwatchable. Fuck him or leave him alone. Christ.  Still, her design is hot as fuck.               Not as edgy as ur mums cunt ,m8     dem legs  I still find myself very attracted to Jane even if she's probably one of the shittier people of Lagoon.      /a/ sure is slow tonight. post the edgiest manga pages.     Manga?    ITT: People who don't know what edgy means    It's only edgy out of context    Shokugeki No Souma    wow this guy shot her head back into one piece   This has a lot of these moments really.   He actually did though.....  go read Fushi no Ryouken      no, dont go read it. its irredeeemable shit.    Edgy things are fun. I want edgy highschool manga that doesn't try to dress it up in emotional turmoil. Like Daimaou.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198932   Boku no Pico.       This is what I call edgy    not even his final edge       Alright I have to read this for a good laugh.     Something Seraph    This is 3edgy5me    Stabbed so hard snot came outta her nose.    to edge even for me.   Enough edge here.      New edge never     ?   This manga hates cute girls.        ITT /a/nons misuse the word edgy, repeatedly.   wait, her whole head was magically healed? I'm so confused     The majority of the population is immortal, when they die they just come back to life fully healed.     How about grim? Is that acceptable?   Grimdark would be the most accurate. Grimdark is an actual subgenre of fiction that most of the things people on /a/ refer to as "edgy" would fit into. Edgy means something completely different.    Edgy has no concrete meaning, or well if it did, it doesn't anymore. Probably one of the better examples of a buzzword.    This part in the anime made me piss myself.     Edgy means something completely different.  You know words can have multiple meanings and uses can change over time. it's not like the edgy, as in cutting edge ore iconoclast use was devoid of grim subject matter to the point of just being shock value.     Grimdark is when there is no light whatsoever.    posters: 32   images: 16  50% of you need to get the fuck out.     Spoiler that shit. It's daytime!           No    this guy is edge tm   Nothing personnel kid.              Purest love.    Why didn't you just post the page you jackass       Didn't it mean "being nervous"? Like being on the edge of a seat?  I wonder if dark fiction characters with lots of spikes on their armor is what started the trend to call them edgy.       Had his arm eaten   No fucks given       I wish there was more of this.   I don't read edgy     You can read this while waiting   Is this edgy enough for this thread?   Ctrl+F   No trash.   Well this thread just ain't edgy enough.       having a bold, provocative, or unconventional quality &lt;an edgy film&gt;   It's used ironically, that's where it comes from.       Entrails blasting from right under the beck      H S O O H W      while waiting  You mean there will be more? I thought it was finished.     3/4 chapters has been translated from first volume.    Nervous is/was a different meaning (with I assume a totally different etymology and stuff).      PURGE THE UNCLEAN  SUFFER NOT THE WITCH TO LIVE      Looks like Shiki except retarded.    It got published.    reading pluto   edge out of nowhere         TWIM was edgy as heck.    yeah it was, but in a great way    ouch      Sauce, please? Google does nothing      sauce?     NO JUST DIE TEXT POSTERS       Nah, I don't give out sources, but you could try again.      Capeta     Honor requires that I do not give help when asked nicely  Your post is the edgiest page in this thread     Listen ass, I gave another picture of the same manga for a person to try and look it up. And I know if they are smart enough, they can find it.    It should be obvious from the second page. There's only one person fucking insane enough to lift a tank.    That's not true. There are lots of  flashlights     OH fuck, you just made me remember to read the newest chapter. Thanks anon.    Yeah, I forogt I lurk /a/ and manga hosts all day every day so I know every single character who's supposed to do that by heart. What the fuck was I thinking?    You're just a Mad Bull. I'd say there's probably 34 anons like you out there.   New chapter when?    It was only good the first chapter, then it just went to shit.     What's the deal with saucefags being the most cancerous fucking shitstains on the face of the earth   It's mad bull you goddamn retarded fucking window licker       Wut?        Decide to watch Katanagari because of the Ep 4 pv   Half the fucking episode is the sister just showing how fucking ridiculous strong she is and fucking with the maniwani   At the end Shichika talks about the fucking fight we saw in the Pv,which wasnt animated   WHY THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT ALLOWED?       Decide to watch Katanagari because of the Ep 4 pv    Some faggot kept posting it as a webm and got me interested.     So how did Shichika win the fight against Nanami again? It didn't make any sense, Nanaimi was stronger but he just won for no apparent reason.     She let him, it was pretty obvious.    tfw haven't watched Katanagatari in ages. read this thread and had immediate flashback to anger when I realised we'd been trolled and all we got of the fight was some second hand dialogue   thanks for re-opening that wound        sent them to the shadow realm      chaika face   senpai  git gud       Well, Togashi's art isn't on Inoue's or Miura's level but above average certainly and, in fact, excellent for a WSJ release.  Compare any of the actual, completely fixed Tankobons (which I own) to other Jump releases like Naruto, Hero Academy, bleach etc and you will find that what I say is true.        filename     It's how Hunter X Hunter looks when it gets printed in Weekly Jump. It gets redrawn for the Tankobons.   Who is the best witch and why is it Yoshika?  Only real answer    Slutchini       Lucchini's mom is great. Best part about Lucchini is knowing how she'll end up.       implying you wouldn't a shimapan, fang-toothed witch     i don't think there's a single that i wouldn't   What happened to Mo-tan to become so tiny? Did she only manage to reincarnate partially?  Is she not part of the zodiac anymore then?     6500 yen   surprise hit of the year?  surprise hit of the year      ordering    Tiger? More like Thigh-ger    Cow? More like Wow!  </blockquote>]
