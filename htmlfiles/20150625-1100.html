[   I fap to Shinobu if that's what you mean.   orly?    Yes, now post more Shinobu feet.   Continuing the Symphogear hype. Only 9 more days until episode 1.  New PV came out today:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CL<wbr>cpO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]   The new concert scene looks great already.        Song translation  Exterminate will be on Nana's radio show this sunday.    I want to fuck Kirika.  Tsubasa's charm point    The new concert scene looks great already.  RIP budget.    I want to see Tsubasa taking care of Maria's hairstyle for her while she's restrained in a straightjacket.  Finally got to watch this damn PV after a long day and holy shit, why can't I hold all this HYPE?!  Slowly getting there.   I want to fuck, mind break, and marry Shirabe.      Are you gonna change anything else?    I'd say mix up the X returns squares. They are all right next to each other.     Yeah, still working, give me a moment.      Miku useless    DMJii a cute.  <br/>    Maria Useful   Chris Learns manners   These are never getting filled in.       Now why did you add yoyos? We know that one already. Should've kept chris table manners.     They should make flips during concerts in real life.   I want to marry Kirika!    Also I'm aware that my capitalization is all over the place.   Chris table manners are there, I removed something else. And I wanted Shirabe in there. We still don't know for sure if that's a yoyo, do we?       Nana is already flying around in her concerts. Not long until she does more crazy stunts.    It's a sawblade yoyo.     Chris a free space    Guys send help I can't stop rewatching the Radiant Force part of the PV.   I'm still saying that Kirika's witch themed outfit looks weird as fuck when it's white instead of black.   Anyone have the webm of how songs work being explained to miku?   When you join team good guys your uniform is required to match     I see. Since I removed other obvious things, any more ideas? Something with Anime janai?     Then do something like Shirabe "cooking" instant ramen    Anime-janai's friend getting a geah.    Anon I can't, I'm doing it too.    That's really not going to happen.    I think it looks great.    Change the Miku useless. That is rather pointless.    DMJii duet. Phonic gain. Mikugeah returns.  I'd say take out Apple lyrics, then I realized you were going for unlikely shit, so do what you prefer.  Is the Evil Mastermind square only supposed to be filled if Genjuro is the evil mastermind? Because that swings things from practically confirmed to extremely improbable.         How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?   They could find her more stuff to throw.   How gay is miku?  How deep can she take bikkis fist?    KIZUNA  KOKORO  HITOTSU NI KAWARE      She can take  all of it    How many people believe in Aoi Yuki again?   Gay enough to turn a shit-tier relic into a killing machine through AI YO.  Elbow deep.     Now the fun about this is to have some completely improbable and some obvious things in them, right?   Can't really remember what that was about.       Lewd     HAZU YO KONO KISEKI NI KUSOU WA NAI E      Is it known who's going to be subbing this? If it's only Commie again I might as well just kill myself   Should be 'Mikugear returns'.    I'd fist Miku's ass with my penis if you catch my drift.    I think the fun about it should be that the event in every single box is HYPE AS FUCK.  Like, the thread fucking explodes with the force of a hundred climaxes every time we get to tick something off.       kusou  It's うそ, anon. くそ means shit.    Best song, and best gear. Why is miku so perfect.   Zoid plans to sub it, he found a timer and an encoder to help.   Commie on the other hand has pretty directly said they don't intend to sub GX.      Fine. But I'm done for now.   It's pretty hard to find enough such things to fill the whole board.       That's what I get for trying to speak gook.  Shou ga nai wa can't be helped.      Why do fansub groups refuse to sub Symphogear anyway? It isn't like a small show no one cares about.    Now  please be consistent in writing words in caps     Doing songs is awkward.    Compared to other shows it is, and it's apparently more difficult to sub due to using technical terms and unconventional Japanese or something.    No simulcast. Too many songs.    Because there's no simulcast script to take, edit and call an original translation. You actually need to know Japanese to sub it. There are only a few fansubbers I'm aware of who are actually good enough to do that.  Start learning moon on your own.      That and karaoke, lyrics everywhere.    Why does a succesful show like this not get a simulcast? Almost every show does nowadays.    Simulcasts killed fansubbing as we knew it    Licensing issues probably.    Do you have any idea how much money it would cost to license all the songs?   I'm so hype I'm even watching this trailer frame by frame.  dat border between red sunset and starry sky     Mexican subs will deliver for sure.     Shit. Will Zoid save us? Commie? FFF?       zoom in on head until it's roughly the same size as mine   scroll down to see how big her ass now is  Magnificent.      No, that was Daiz.    I think my eyes are bleeding    And now I realize they're under a roof that looks like a night sky that's gonna open up just like in the Zwei Wing concert. Hype.    Don't worry /a/, I'll make subs for you. I don't understand Japanese but I'll be sure to put "I want to fuck you Miku" when Hibiki is talking to her, maybe that isn't what she is saying at that moment, but that's what she thinks so it's all right.   Commie like every time. That's until the last episode airs and no subs come out for a whole month.  Bless those fuckers.       new gears  When?     Supposedly Zoid is doing it.   I know enough moon to watch it. I need to pause and rewind raw anime a lot, but I can get through it. I'll feel sorry for people if it doesn't get subbed, though.        99%     No animejyanai in the bingo    8 days 20 hours 31 minutes   So what, 20 days for subs?     I just noticed the London Bridge in the background. Unless they're performing on a barge, I'm guessing that's just a scaled-down replica?    They're in London. Satelight probably doesn't care there's no building in London that could possibly look at the bridge from this angle.     Commie of course. Besides the shenanigans with the last episode their releases were pretty solid. Though you know whenever an insert song gets used the episode will be delayed a day or two.     Commie said they weren't gonna do it. Vale, the Symphogear translator has a job at Sunrise now.      It's a flying arena Maria brought over herself. She set it to hover over the river during the concert.       There goes the typesetting I guess.     It's like when porn artists get jobs doing legit manga and stop doing porn, only worse because at least you have their non-H art to look at now.    Not to shit on people who do this stuff in their free time but we went full weeks without subs well before the last episode.    Since the songs take so long, it might be a good idea if Zoid does two releases; one without the songs, and then a second one after the songs are translated and typeset.    You should tell him that, not us.   I don't know why I have this saved.   I'm not good at that sort of thing.    Maria is shown in a prison getup   In episode 1 she's doing a concert  Wait what? Do they let her out just to sing or something and then immediately lock her up afterwards?       That's how it should be.    didn't mean to post that, sorry    Why do you think they're gonna lock her up again. The prison scene was probably a flashback to the moment when they got her out of it.    I don't see a problem in that.    Time skips. The shuttle incident takes place not too long after G, then something like six months are going to pass before magical girls start showing up. Tsubasa will graduate in that time too.    @zoid9000  Supposedly he lurks here, I doubt he'd mind discussing his plans. Dude seems happy to talk about symphogear at any opportunity.         Further, the live scene in GX will be very different from the one in G, both in terms of music and it’s visual presentation.   It already looks different compared to the other two. There's something melancholic in the lyrics and the atmosphere too.      I can't wait anymore   Fine will come back for real this time right?      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nuH<wbr>fVn_cfHU</wbr>  [ ]   Do we have enough people here who are decent enough at the language in order to translate/summarize the important things in an episode? I feel like I can watch symphogear raws and understand most of it, maybe not the language but it's generally quite easy to understand what is going on (most of the time, action).    The shuttle incident takes place not too long after G  Huh, how do you know that?     Summarize sure, accurately translate only with a raw where I can skip around in. I wouldn't worry too much though, we survived commies erratic shedule just fine so we'll get through this too.    There's usually a few people who fill us plebs in on the confusing parts.    Dear Lord I wish she doesn't, I don't want her to kill herself.    777% We believe in Nana, but we believe in Aoi too. Miracles of the universe.      Ok, just checking.   Isn't the series supposed to start with the concert? Unless its a flashback like the other anon said, I don't see how that makes sense.        bingo  Its starting. The ride is starting.      That's what the story section on the website says, just shortly after the Frontier incident. It doesn't give a more specific timeframe. It does say that magical girls are about 100 days after that though, so not quite six months, sorry.    Flashbacks to explain what happened after G.    Chrisfag weeblord who translated some of the fan comics posted in the threads reporting in.  If subs get delayed I'll summarize episodes in the threads. As long as it's not 20 minutes of techno-babble I think I'll be ok.      Aoi is getting better and better at singing  Finally, there is a candidate to surpass Nana when she retires.  Nice to see you again, Weeblord!      My guess is that the episode will actually start with the shuttle falling and the gears trying to save it, then the time skip will happen and we'll see the pajama party and concert, both of which will be interrupted by the new enemies appearing.   Maria in jail probably is a flashback though. In an interview they said that Maria still being an idol and everything will be addressed in the first two episodes.      Aoi is my angel.   Is it just me or Tsubasa looks more manlier as the time passes?   To me it seems more like it starts with Hibiki and co having a pajama party and watching the concert on TV and then suddenly getting called on site without their gears and then getting permission to use them again afterwards to rescue civilians?   The backgrounds are sure getting better every season.   Shit I just noticed how lewd the crotch region of Maria's idol outfit is.    Same as Tsubasa's Symphogeah, pretty much.    Thank the frenchbro background artist at Satelight.     The frenchies that do background art for Satelight tweeted some months that they were working on Symphogear S3.     Maria is prepared to let Tsubasa stick her sword inside her.      Fushichou no Flamme was about phoenixes and fire   a hot, fast and action-y song   this time they're in goldfish outfits on the river Thames with water sprinklers in the concert  I'm betting it will be a calm ballad or something.       I wish I can work at Satelight too.    That scrolling block of text about authorization is in reference to the shuttle incident. It's giving the 2nd Division permission to act outside of Japan for six hours to save the shuttle.     calm ballad, then shit goes down on the other side of the world were Chris and Bikki are  That works too.      What do the moonrunes say?   Varying degrees of anger.     tfw no Tsubasa at the pajama party     I actually like Bikki's S1 pajamas more because of the sweatpants (those are sweatpants right?). But Symphobird shirt+sweatpants would be perfect.   Looks like Nana is shooting the PV for Exterminate now. http://www.mizukinana.jp/blog/2015/<wbr>06/post-2959.html</wbr>     blog not updated for 2 days  Looks like she's busy as fuck.     She's getting more angry and it uses gyaru meme-speak to describe how fucking angry she is.    You ever watch the Rock? With Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery? She's like Sean Connery's character, but with more singing and less prison rape.    According to the International Union Charter, The international Union of Security held an emergency conference about the measures and correspondences towards the severe machinery trouble of the Space Shuttle of the International Union of Security; Ned Buntline93R which is intended to the investigation and search for the ■■■ suspended antiquity on the point of Lagrange along the orbit of the earth satellite, and 573 latinga, among 15 members of the assembles commissioners.  Main point for the conference is about the activity of the Government of Japan which is the second sector of special hazards correspondence possesses outside of the territory of the country of Japan, and the special correspondence activity to execute measures in order to approve the limitless transit and transfer among the borders of each country in the Peace of Westphalia.  After the conference among the 15 executive commissioners, the result was 13 approvals and 2 disapprovals.  The number of the approving votes exceeded the ones of disapproving and gained the approvals from over 9 countries that are set numbers, however one country of the executive commissioner invoked the rights to refuse and provided the large country agreement rules, it is defined that the special correspondence activity was unapproved.  However the activity authority was certified upon the condition to disclose all the records of the activities outside the territory of Japan as resources and to limit the activity for the maximum of six hours including preparation and clean ups.   Therefore, it is confirmed to commission the measures and correspondence in terms of severe machinery troubles of the Space Shuttle of the International Union of Security; Ned Buntline93R under the supervision of the board of directors.  (Ned Buntline is the name of the shuttle. https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Ned<wbr>_Buntline)</wbr>                Based anon.    Training Montage should say free space    You wouldn't expect that to make sense, but it does.     Tsubasa clearly visible lower right corner of pyjama party   Get your prescription checked, Nana.     No, I mean the GX one.    They were looking for relics in space, and they probably found Elfnein and her box out there, which is why she's designated as "Scrap Material #11".    That anon's talking about the GX pajama party in the PV, Tsubasa is presumably at England at that time.    fire   I feel like I kind of know why they want to fuck up shit.    I want to  hold hands  with Elfnein and tell her everything will be okay.    You can't solve all your problems by holding their hands Hibiki.    I thought that was witch loli, not Eru erufu nein.

I doesn't know many about Japanese culture so as European watcher I didn't understand anything and maybe that decided it sucked for me.   I'll probably pick up everything aside from the few gayshit and Dragon Ball.   Bikini Warriors, nuff said   Akagami no Shirayuki-hime because the manga is one of the comfiest and charming things I've read in ages.  I am watching Monster Musume because of all the hype and love /a/ gives it.   This.  Also hoping that Dumpire doesn't get shitty anime art.

There's nothing I have high expectations of, so I don't expect to get disappointed.                    Prison school should be better for your dick   So is SHAFT not doing anything this summer season? I guess its okay if it means theyre working hard on kizu in the meantime. Surprised Kyoani isnt doing anything either  Going to watch Charlotte. Most anime that have espers always go down the same path as X-men really like Zettai Karen Children, Tokyo ESP, and Rising X Rydeen. I want to see if Charlotte can stand on its own.  Not gonna watch Prisma Illya. I mean, it's shoujou-ai and mahou-shoujo, a combination of the two worst tags to exist in anime/manga.      The Gate threads are going to be 10000x worse than the Danmachi ones.   You're probably right. I don't know why people who read gate care so much about all the military aspect of it. They don't focus on the weapons all that much, or even care that much about military hierarchy.  It's not even propaganda. That's like saying independence day is "propaganda." It's just nationalistic pride. The gate opened in japan and they sent in the japanese army. Deal with it.        worse  But Danmachi threads are lots of fun, what do you mean?      Non Non Biyori  will have worse threads.    That's not what people get worked up about in GATE.   There's only two things people get worked up about in GATE.  1  Where the nukes at?   2  Three countries SF teams got neutralize by Japan and America is the only country that has black people in it's military             DO NOT WATCH GOD EATER You will hate it   Yes it does have some waifus that may interest you   Yes the context and concept are cool  But the ending will upset you and the MC will have 0 developement much less than Personas door-kun You have been warned, just like UBW 2015 its battles will hopefully be awesome but he story leaves too much to be desired        Preview anon doing his thing:   Watching because my autism demands I watch sequels:  Durarara Gatchaman Crowds Aquarion Working To Love-Ru  Will give a chance:  God Eater Prison School Overlord  This season just looks pretty shit.                 Green is a definite watch. Yellow, is the three episode rule. My end of season watch list is probably going to look radically different anyway.    Forgot pic   Working!!!   Kangoku Gakuen, Gate. That's it.   What's up with ushio to tora ? What brought about it getting a remake ?   it is well know in japan i guess  the pv on youtube has more than 500k view     Really excited about Gods Eater, Gangsta, and Ushio to Tora       New season is starting in just a couple days   Damn, Spring just flew right over me. I kept forgetting to watch stuff, hopefully Summer gives me a reason to pay more attention.    Is this the best show Kyoani has made Haruhi aside ?   Haruhi&gt;Hyouka&gt;Hibike   Nope.   Are you some newfag that did not watch Hyouka?   Free &gt; all   Anon how fucking delusional are you? Full metal Panic is superior to that Yuribaiting shit.   Hyouka &gt; Keion &gt; Haruhi &gt; Clannad &gt; Tomoko &gt; Hibike &gt; Amagi &gt; Free &gt; Chuuni &gt; Who cares  Haruhi was my favourite kyoani show  It's better than Haruhi.    FMP  It's just shit for kids.   Kanon&gt;Clannad        Speaking of animation, Hyouka may be a step ahead of Hibike.  But Hibike is surely among the best things they have made for sure. Haruhi is somewhat good, only the movie is almost a masterpiece. So Euphonium is above It undeniably.       Amagi that low   Keion that high   Good list otherwise      No, it's one of their worst.    no FMP    That's how you spot a newfag.       FMP   oldfags      Mecha stuff leaves me cold, sorry m8.     Blurry Filtershit considered among the best things they have made   It's nice to know people have low standards for KyoAni.     I wonder how long It will take for IRC to take over the place....   wait they already did    It doesn't seem completely horrible and like the characters actually develop in meaningful ways but can we maybe stop obsessing about it a bit. I've often wondered how much worship of Kyoani do people think is good enough per typical one cour series because it tends to look downright cultish at times.   please try harder... but nice effort so here's your reply....   OFFICIAL KYOANI ANIMES POWER RANKING 1. Haruhi POWER GAP 2. Hibike 3. Hyouka 4. K-ON 5. Free POWERGAP 6.Chuni 7.Tamako 8. Amagi 9. who cares             Why do people think Haruhi is KyoAnus"s best? It's of course better than any of the competition, because &gt;kyoani, but internally, it's meh tier compared to everything else they've done - I might not even put it in the top half. I don't get it.     But K-On is a thing OP     Hibike second   Have you really watched all those shows?      It was a trend-setter, and started the "dude in weird club with girls" LN adaptions. Same with K-ON popularizing the slice-of-life shows with yuri undertones.    Haruhi is great even without KyoAni, same way Monogatari is good read without or rather despite Shaft.  Plus its based Yamakan, God of Anime. KyoAni was never the same again.  Since Haruhi they got great quality shows and some popular hits - but no source material that great.        nope   Honestly I really don't see what's fucking good about Euphonium. It's the same Highschool setting shit mixed with shitty melodrama and bands. Fuck, the series hasn't even focused much on the band aspect. Also all the characters are completely shit, like am I supposed to find Kumiko like able because she's a little cynical shit or Asuka because she's a little bitch as well. Or even Reina who's autistic as fuck and lusts over the Teachers dick for no apparent reason. How am I supposed find any of these characters like able. Also not to mention Shunichi has barely had any fucking screentime and we're supposed to care about his relationship with Kumiko, that's dumb.  This series is not even close to the best KyoAni has done, it's pretty forgettable.    I still don't know what do "'mah music'fags really want.  Do you really want a show of a girl tuning her guitar for 30 minutes, or playing the same riff over and over for three days straight?    Its one of the best, but that isn't saying much since Kyoani is mostly garbage. Euphonium is a rather good show regardless, and I disagree with the people claiming it has forced drama.    Nodame Cantabile   Is this the best girl Kyoani has made Haruhi aside?  What made people forget Lucky Star despite it being a massive hit at some point?   Nope.     Hyouka first     It's way better than Haruhi. Nichijou is the only other Kyoani show that comes close to the quality of Hibike.     nichijou     Too much forehead showing most of the time.    Nobody forgot Lucky Star, they just realised it isn't as great as it once was. Considering most of the appeal is all the 2007 references, it isn't aging well. Comedy that relies on time-period cultural references has an expiration date right out of the box, even for viewers that experienced the time period.       Free  The water looked nice, that was it. I'm not even going to try attacking its entirely fanservice-driven premise, but its characterization and plot were worse that even Chuuni's "love" story.     Free friendship story is way better than Chuuni love story. Also I cringed less.    It would have surpassed even Hyouka if they didn't ruin it with pointless fanservice.   Hibikek is WAOTS contender.  What was the fucking point of Chuuni S2 though? I sometimes lie awake at night pondering that question.  Keion &gt; Hyouka &gt; Haruhi &gt; Amagi &gt; Chuuni &gt; Hibike The rest is shit  or did not watch.     This still saddens me a little too. It's not that dated, but there are a couple factors that helped push it into obscurity.  It's funny to think how at its peak it was something like "the next Haruhi" and now it's all but forgotten.      Hyouka &gt; Disappearance &gt; FMP Fumoffu/TSR = Haruhi &gt; Hibike &gt; Amagi = Nichijou &gt;*   Fun. People forget this now, but after S1 ended, everyone just wanted another season of fun chuuni antics with less focus on drama and romance.   KyoAni delivered, but then everyone suddenly reversed their priorities and complained about the lack of romantic development.      The problem is that S2 made the ending of S1 feel completely pointless.  If they wanted to give fans more chuuni antics, they could have just made S2 take place chronologically during S1 itself, and maybe the final few episodes after the events of S1 with character development.     Haruhi &gt; Lucky Star &gt; Hyouka &gt; Keion &gt; Hibike &gt; Amagi &gt; Nichijou &gt; Chuuni &gt; Tamako &gt; leftovers   The problem with S2 is that it was a sequel to S1. Which was also shit.   Haruhi isn't even that good.   Kyoani isn't even that good, anon. Haruhi is still their magnum opus.      Chuuni &gt; Tamako &gt; Key anime  Seriously nigger    Of what I've watched.  Haruhi&gt;K-On&gt;Nichijou&gt;FMP&gt;Hibike&gt;KnK<wbr>&gt;Chu2&gt;Clannad  Yes Hibike is good, but its not the best Kyoani work.  </wbr>     I disagree, I got attached to a lot more characters in Free than in Chuu2 because they felt more human.   its entirely fanservice-driven premise  I believe you shouldn't have approached the show in this wrong way, maybe you'd have noticed that the characters actually develop decently then.       I think Free was really good in a lot of respects, but it needed more cure girls.   God tier : Clannad/AS, Kanon 2006, FMP TSR/Fumoffu, Haruhi, Nichijou.  Not bad tier : Amagi, Hibike, Air TV, Hyouka.  Garbage tier : Free, Chuu2, Kyoukai no Kanata, Tamako Market, K-on!, Lucky Star.         Never forget.    Cute boys with gap moe &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generic cute girls   Disappearance&gt;Clannad AS&gt;K-On!!&gt;Nichijou&gt;HaruhiS1+S2&gt;Hyou<wbr>ka&gt;Hibike&gt;Tamako LS&gt;Clannad&gt;Lucky Star&gt;K-On!+movie&gt;ChuuS1&gt;Tamako Market&gt;ChuuS2  something like that, I think there is a power gap after nichijou, and another around chuu  </wbr>    Free     It was more exciting than Chuu, Tamako and Amagi.     K-On   Lucky Star   Garabage tier      Hibike is god tier and KyoAni's best.  I know this because I haven't watched any other of their anime.    Haruhi &gt; K-on &gt; Clannad &gt; Lucky Star &gt; Nichijou &gt; Air &gt; Fumoffu &gt; TSR &gt; Hyouka &gt; Kanon &gt; Hibike &gt;  Knk  &gt; Chuuni &gt; Amagi &gt; Tamako   Haven't watched Free yet.       K-on   Garbage   If you were a woman I'd punch you.       This sounds pretty accurate.    Don't be rude Kumiko but forced moe is cancer.    What a forced opinion     God tier Clannad, Kanon   Not bad tier Air  Nigga get off Maeda's shitdick.      Anyone aside from Haru, Rin, and Sousuke got minimal development at best. Among the most developed of every other character was Rei, whose development was more lackluster than the show makes you believe if you look back on it. Really he just decides to work harder or something to maintain his place on the team as opposed to giving it back to Rin in a metaphorical way.  I hate fanservice regardless of whether it's male- or female-oriented, and it's hard to ignore the constant muscle shots the show gives. Also  "you can tell by their bodies that they don't workout"   everyone is a perfectly toned Calvin Klein model  Gou was as annoying and useless of a character as you'd expect from someone who virtually represents the intended female audience.  It wasn't a horrible show, it even resonated with me on the fact that I was a former competitive swimmer, but it didn't really accomplish a lot and wasted a fair bit of the little potential it had, which admittedly was not a lot. The sports anime formula doesn't work well on a sport that involves basically no interaction with enemy teams.          What went wrong with Kyoukai no Kanata, /a/?  Hyouka &gt; Nichijou &gt; Haruhi &gt; Hyouka &gt; Fmp &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the rest  Fuck you, FMP was not that good. Haruhi movie was a masterpiece but have you guys forgotten the abomination that is season 2?     Disappearance &gt; Hyouka &gt; Nichijou &gt; Haruhi TV &gt; Tamako Love Story &gt; Hibike &gt; K-On &gt; Lucky Star &gt; Chuuni S1 &gt; Tamako TV &gt; KnK &gt; Chuuni S2 &gt; Amagi  Haven't seen Clannad, FMA or Free.      All the money went on creating great girls, and nothing else.    I dunno. Maybe? For me personally it is the only KyoAni show since FMP Fumoffu and Lucky Star to impress me. P.S. Yes I don't like Haruhi much. First season was alright tho.     Maeda is a fucking genious anon. Even if P.A Works are useless shit when it comes to adapt Key material i'm pretty sure that Charlotte will be awesome.    Take your keiki elsewhere faggot.        Woops, accidently put Hyouka after Haruhi. I meant Hibike.    The mix of a serious story with silly comedy was a bad idea    Sure thing mature person    Too many characters, convoluted plot and P.A. Works levels of edge.     mature person   what      Angel Beats being a complete trainwreck had nothing to do with PA Works, it was because Maeda's a hack, same reason everything else Key is garbage.   Actual KyoAni tier list: Trend setter tier : Haruhi, Keion Godly tier : Hyouka&gt; nichijou&gt; Clannad&gt; Tamako Love Story&gt; Lucky Star Good tier : Kanon, FMP, Tamako Market, Chu2koi, Free Trash tier : everything else and munto.      Reminder that KyoAnus is only going to adapt fujoshit shows from now on now that their old formula with cute girls doesn't sell anymore. SHAFT is going to become the new moe-centered studio. Mark my words.    SHAFT   implying it won't be PA works.      Nice shitpost SHAFTfag.    This is surprisingly not so incorrect after all this blasphemy and fanboying in this thread.     PA works    not Dogakobo      Hahaha, you're kidding right?     is going   implying they are not now      Shaft is far more about fanservice than moe. Also, nevermind that KyoAni's done plenty of shows that aren't Free over the past few years.    It sounds like you expected more sports but Free got marketed as a show about bonds and friendship so the characters and their relationships were the focus (and in my opinion done in a satisfying way).  Rin's sister was shit yeah but she was just an irrelevant background character so that's neglegible. All main characters on the other hand were fleshed out enough to give them layers beyond stereotypes which I appreciate. The boys seemed like genuinely good friends.      you gay nigga     DogaKobo   not SilverLink  But seriously Silver Link is somewhat promising. Unlike Shaft that is stuck in Shinbou hell.  I only forget Hibike and that probably should fit in good tier. If they toned down the yuri bait maybe the show would've been better.         Also, nevermind that KyoAni's done plenty of shows that aren't Free over the past few years.   Free is one of their best selling shows and Hibike and Amagi didn't sell shit. They have no reason to not pander to fujos as hard as they can now.     I also wanted to say Hyouka but then I remembered the emo faggot sidekick and episodes where nothing happens. Hibike gotta be better than that at least.   Amagi too low. Hyouka too high. Good list overall.      They won't, KyoAni at its core is still about cute girls and they just expanded their audience.  It's just that out of their recent franchises only Free managed to appeal to a lot of different subgroups (fujoshi, husbandofags, gayfags, sportsfags, normalfags, obligatory KyoAnifags etc.).  KyoAni just need to create another show that hits so many different groups at once again and it doesn't need to be aimed at females like Free.      From what I've seen. Hyouka &gt; Amagi &gt; Tamako &gt; Clannad &gt; shit &gt; Hibike I watched a couple episodes of K-On and Nichijou and thought they were great but they are stuck in backlog hell.     Both Hibike and Amagi sold decently.     tripfagging for absolutely no reason   You are such an immense attention whore Stefan.       Both Hibike and Amagi sold decently.  Barely breaking 5K is not that great in terms of KyoAni. Both those series won't get a second season.     And yet, despite the huge jump in sales with the first season of Free, they still mostly make shows that aren't Free.    That's sad.     For KyoAni.  I fucking hate this meme. KyoAni is a small studio that had few big hits more than 5 years ago. They are still new to the publishing aspect so the stories they are doing are still shit. But given enough time they will truly be the first tv studio to break away from Kodakwa jewery. Their shows don't sell as much as Sunrise. But guess what they don't spend as much as Sunrise does.     They're both closer to 7k, and that's pretty much the average for KyoAni. You can't consider 40k their average just because Haruhi and K-on broke those kind of numbers, especially with such a small studio.   Haruhi = Clannad = K-On &gt; Hyouka = Tomoko = Hibiki = Amagi &gt; Chuuni &gt; Free &gt; Shit &gt; Shit &gt; Shiiiiiit &gt; Lucky Star  The real tragedy is that there's a thread this big dedicated to the most overrated animation house of the last fifteen years.   Pretty much this. I really hate when Kumiko and Reina get together and start acting like they're in a cheap soap opera.  I do admit that I orgasmed when they played Rydeen.     Forgot Haruhi. I'd put it below Tamako but above Clannad. Never understood the hype from it.     The real tragedy is that there's normalfag shitposters who post facebook images on /a/.    All they have to do is make K-On season 3 and NOT sell Nichijou for 90 fucking dollars.  I'm pretty sure they're fucked when it comes to Haruhi since the creator said something about not liking KyoAnus.      Haruhi first time airing was amazing. I know it's overrated but it's difficult to wear off the nostalgia glasses.     since the creator said something about not liking KyoAnus.  W-what? Tanigawa said what?     I really liked Hibike when it first started but I'm going off it now, the yuribaiting and the way Kumiko interacts with other characters like Reina is just strange and unnatural - even for anime.   It was EE wasn't it?    They are not fucked about Haruhi. The thing is there isn't anything to advertise. The books are on hiatus. And there is likely no chance of K-On S3 because Yamada doesn't want to do Keion again.  Honestly they need to keep trying until they get good at picking stories.     Here's a biased quote from someone who has worked in the industry and thinks there's money in appealing to the west    It was from a Con interview, its on Youtube.  Someone asked about Kyoani, and he said something on the lines of "I was never happy working with them"   Very high chance.         Hyouka is boring as fuck   Disappearance, Hyouka  Haruhi S1, Nichijou, Tamako Love Story  Chuu2 S1, Clannad, Hibike, K-On!, Kanon, Lucky Star  Air, Tamako Market  Chuu2 Ren, Haruhi S2, KnK           It's less about stories nowadays and more about character appeal and entertaining interactions KyoAni need to work on.  All of KyoAni's 10k breakers fulfill these conditions.      Clannad   K-On   KyoAni's best shit   on the same tier as Lucky Shit  Surely you fucking jestin.        So Under the Dog is basically going to be Psycho Pass, right?     Clannad   KyoAni's best  Please.     Do people really unironically think that Amagi Brilliant Park was good? I mean it was entertaining but it wasn't good at all. It was KyoAni's weakest show to date.   sure why not    Keion is the best feelgood show Kyoani have done. Hyouka is the best 'arty' one.      mature project = things that aren't cute   I'm surprised they let 8 year old boys work in the industry.      Haruhi is absolute garbage though    Anime industry is currently smothered with moe-centered series, not leaving any space for serious and mature projects   serious and mature projects   serious and mature   Fucking Reddit, why do people enable this kind of shit?        Put LS in the second tier and you've got great taste.   Anyone will go to kyoAni(do) event at Oct 31th~ Nov 1st?   It has a weird fanbase of entry level waifufags.    Honestly his attitude is laughable at best. If your shit doesn't sell it's not because you are better than the people who're not buying it. It's because you're a retard who can't do market research.  I mean if GitS was released this year it would sell more than any other movie combined.  There is nothing wrong with the market. The fault is in the product.       It was lots and lots of fun, which is exactly what I expected. Also plenty of well designed characters with colorful personalities (fairies, mascots).     This show is one of the shittiest shows KyoAnus has ever made.    It's the kumiko you can't resist it.    It's the same segment that still go on about FMP after all these years.    To be fair, it's a PR account in a public context, so it's anyone's guess if the people running it believe what they're saying.     Hyouka that high   great taste      It looked like ass too.    It was probably one of the best comedies i've seen in years next to Nichijou. Not to mention not one character was bland.    Into the filter list it goes    I didn't know you had such shit taste Jebus, I'm disappointed.       based Jebus      I bet you liked Tamako Market.      When do you exactly believe the anime industry hit rock bottom?  This can't be serious. I mean, he's literally goading the guy into naming one show. It has to be a trap.     Nope.<br/>    Failed, my bad.  This one is my post.        Compared to Kyoani's other recent stuff it did look way worse.    Fuck you Tamako Market was great. Unlike the shit like ABP and FMP.    Definitely one of the better comedies.  The mascots were comedy gold.     I...can't argue against this. Though I would put Hibike at least above Air.    I love Lucky Star. It's not forgotten.    m-my opinion is more of a fact than yours!!  Wow can you stop these pointless threads    Not above Air but you're right, I think I should've put Hibike above Hyouka and Kanon.    It had a fucking gruesome start, and aged like cum in a sock. It was only fun at the time, but soon became horribly unable to compete with most standards.  The only somewhat memorable parts were Konata and Lucky Channel.      Wait, the guy worked on Haruhi, and then blamed it for the "lack of serious and mature anime"? Faggot.    welcome to ayyy my friend   I really hate Kumiko. She's easily the least likeable Kyoani heroine to date.    It's odd that people who want animation aimed at "the whole world" would even give a shit about anime to begin with. Western animation already produces a lot of lowest common denominator shit that the world seems to love.     Okay, you have really good tas-  Garbage tier   Go fuck yourself.        He says as he posts a picture from one of the worst Kyoani shows to date     Most accurate list in the thread  Just add two more powergaps and place Knk under them       Shaft is barely relevant outside of like two franchise one of which has maybe enough content for another 2 cour left and the other of which relies on anime's latest super star writer who is clearly so out of ideas he just let the producer decide what to do with its movie version. It's really only /a that has this obsession with them.     French productions are good anon. But for some reason most of them are silent.     It doesn't appear to be from Chuu2 Ren.     He liked being involved with the music production on Disappearance because Kyoani can actually into scheduling while also being quick to blame S1 of Haruhi for LN adaptations.   Kyoani should stick to comedies. They struck gold with Hyouka and Disappearance but every time one of their shows gets serious, it turns to shit.     one of the  Chuu2 Ren was probably the worst one      Yet people in the west are still utterly obsessed with them and forever finding anything they can to praise the shit out of them for. It's kind of sad really, like they're trying to relive the ate 2000s which Kyoani is stuck in and still using the same visual calling cards from that people still praise like it's cutting edge directing.    Fuck all your nostalgiafaggotry, Hibike is great. I'm enjoying it as much as I did K-On, but for different reasons.  1: Lucky Star, Kanon, Haruhi, Hyouka, K-On 2: Nichijou, Air, Chuu2, Tamako, FMP 3: Free, Amagi, Hibike, KnK, Clannad     Hibikie is nowhere as good as K-On, mostly because it only took 1 episode and half of the cast is unlikable.    wrong  1. Keion 2. Nichijou 3. Haruhi 4. Hyouka 5. Lucky Star 6. Kanon = Hibike 7. FMP 8. Clannad 9. Tamako 10. Chu2 = Free 11. Amagi                Is this the best show Kyoani has made Haruhi aside ?  More like the greatest show of all time.    Yeah, looking at all those comments complaining about how Japan neglects the Western audience make me feel more affinity with SJWs than I ever thought I would. Where do they get off watching shows made by one country for people in one country and then complaining that those shows weren't made for them? Why do they even care - if they don't like it, why would they want it to be made for them?    How the fuck is K-On nostalgia? The show ended mearly 4 years back. And /a/nons who enjoyed it tend to rewatch it always. K-On and Haruhi are the best stuff KyoAni ever made and that's a fact.     Nichijou &gt; Haruhi     Complaining about stuff aimed at audiences they're not part of is something that SJWs do.   Top 3 Kyoani best shows.  1. Hyouka. 2. Nichijou. 3. Euphonium.       Nichijou is better made and with bigger production values. Haruhi and especially the movie are better.   Man, Kumiko's sister. She needs the D already.   Clannad&gt;Haruhi=K-On!&gt;Hibike&gt;Hyouka&gt;<wbr>Amagi&gt;Chuu2=Nichijou&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lucky Star</wbr>   fags ITT denying that Nichijou was the best Kyoani     It's just shit for kids.   _________________No_______________      This. Hibike is just a solid 10/10 every episode, it's amazingly consistent, and one of the best anime ever.      Chuu2=Nichijou       Kyokai no Kanata    garbage       Chuu2=Nichijo     I actually liked it. OP and Ending were great, pacing was okay, good characters. I'd give it an 8/10    Calm down hype baby, there were like 2 actually good episodes and rest was just yuri/het fags going apeshit fro no reason    FMP is baby's first anime son      Nichijou god tier   yet Lucky Star in garbage    This kid is all messed up.         Amagi above Free and Tamako Market.      The best part of this show was the idol song and the specials.     That has to be my favorite filler episode ever.    Sounds right, Nichijou is a masterpiece while LS is a meme garbage.    Everything else in his garbage tier is still less garbage than KnK.     Lelouch   having great taste       LS has always belonged in the trash.     Free and Tamako Market   Those were both low points for the studio, unless you value the opinion of fujo's.            It was great up until ep 8 when the yuri baiting began. It's contrived pandering on an otherwise good story. Crybaby Saxophone (Ep 7) was actually the best episode of the season.     Why does EVERY new Kyoani show get treated like a masterpiece, when most of them just get forgotten after a season? I don't get it. Only Kyoani show I see get posted about regularly here are Haruhi, which has a new show on right now, and Hyouka.    Go be gay somewhere else, Lefaggot.      that melodramatic scene in the shower about not wanting to stink anymore   the flashbacks during the song outlining the whole week of training as if it were an actual idol anime   the youmu having an orgasm when Ai shows up   It was too good.         Explain why you think it's bad.    It's one of the worst really along with all the other post-Hyouka anime KyoAni have made with the exception ofTamako Love Story.     Only Kyoani show I see get posted about regularly here are Haruhi, which has a new show on right now, and Hyouka.   Both K-on and Nichijou get twice as many threads than than Haruhi and Hyouka.      Exactly. My sides were gone when they realized she couldn't sing.    Shitpost alert    Fanboys. People will forget Hibike even existed after this season.     Nothing, it was comfy as fuck, if people expect anything else form Kyoani shows they're literally autistic.     most overrated animation house of the last fifteen years.   Which was the previous one?     Haruhi, Hibike and Hyouka are the best you can find made in Kyoani.  If you disagree you clearly do not understand a single thing about anime.      K-on and Nichijou are considerably better than all those except for Haruhi, which is on par.       Haruhi threads   What year is this?        nichijou   better than shit      I can understand the other two, but what exactly does Hibike do to set itself apart from the rest of KyoAni's works?      Tamako Love Story       Better than Hyouka and Hibike. Not saying they're bad, just saying Nichijou is better.     Free is also posted about regularly. Don't they have a thread up right now? Unfortunately.    Because both the characters and story are bland and virtually indistinguishable from every other hamfisted highschool battle show that gets churned out every season. The only saving grace is that this one was done by Kyoani, which means that instead of just being tedious hollow crap, it's well animated tedious hollow crap, which puts it in such illustrious company as Mahouka and Owari no Seraph.    Because the source material for Haruhi is amazing. Kyoani + Good source material = Masterpiece     The "yuri baiting" is only a problem if you view the series through the lens of a shipper. As part of the story, those scenes are beautiful and it's interesting to think about how they coexist with their feelings on Shuuichi and Taki-sensei.    Goddess.     Hyouka is shit.     This.    No. All of their shows are good. Some worse than others.     Not even second best in her show     How are they overrated? They are objectively several steps ahead of any other tv animation studio out there when it comes to animation quality, character designs and overall production values. Your favorite anime would be far better if it was made by Kyoani and you know it.   KyoAni hasn't delivered anything worthwhile since Nichijou.  Why do people like Hyouka so much?  The only good things about it are the visual, the animation and the directing, the show in itself is shit.       Kyoani will never remake Amagami       directing, animation and visuals are good but the show is shit   Now this is autism.     You must not have seen many  Hyouka &gt; Haruhi &gt; Hibike &gt; Nichijou &gt; K-On &gt; Lucky Star &gt; Free &gt; Amagi &gt; KnK &gt; Chuu2 &gt; Tamako   Landwhales like it because of Oreki.    Just like 5cm.  People like it because it's beautiful and all, but it's boring as fuck.       Hyouka   better than anything      I don't get why you love this show, it's fine, good animation, good music, kind of good/OK characters, OK story... but nothing more, kind of boring to be honest.  Kyoani has made a lot of great anime since Haruhi, and Haruhi is not even that good        Hyouka 1rst   Hibike that high        boring   Opinion discarded.      Their talent is purely technical. Pretty much anything they've done since Nichijou has been severely disappointing. They usually do inoffensive and stale young adult / teen drama, which ends up boring as fuck.     1rst     They are overrated because they don't do anything outside of Highschool moeshit. The Studio doesn't have any variety in what they produce. I can name a bunch of Studios that actually adapt a variety of series and don't just stick to one thing. Also about animation if you think being blurry and filled with filter is amazing animation then you have some shitty standards.   Seriously the fanbase that worships them are cancerous as fuck to the point it feels like a fucking cult. They are not the best studio ever like some faggots imply because they produce a lot of shit shows as well.      He probably means the story itself, which I completely agree with. Hyouka was boring as fuck.  If you had an incredibly talented studio and director make an anime about literal paint drying on a wall, no matter how good their animation, visuals and direction would be, it would still be a fucking anime about paint drying on a wall.      I don't think shows that only talk about which girl is the most retarded really count You could be in 100 K-on threads and you wouldn't have any idea what the show was about if you hadn't already seen it.      boring  See     But it is anon.    Faggot   Hahahaha. I'm sorry, but FMP! is fucking awful. I don't even like KyoAni, but god damn is that one of the worst series I've ever tried to watch.        Why? because you don't agree with it? Fucking kill yourself.       Hahahaha     I really don't agree, so I guess it just comes down to taste. To me Hyouka wasn't boring for a second, action anime like Gurren Lagann however I can't even get through because I'm so close to falling asleep.     No. Boring isn't valid criticism. It's the kind of thing that you say, when you can't come up with anything else. And surprise surprise, no one that posted boring added anything else.     Blur and filters has nothing to do with the animation quality itself, that's just post production polish that can be taken slightly too far.  Also, what exactly is the problem with a studio doing one thing really well and only doing projects which they are interested in?      Definitely. Undeniably the greatest thing Japan has ever produced.     Haruhi is not even that good      problem fagot?    . At least KyoAni tries to give their shows a film-like quality unlike most other studios who don't even try in terms of photography. Also, KyoAni's animation quality is good, they're the only ones that consistently put effort into character animation unlike most anime where priority is given to action scenes.     Lol      no one that posted boring added anything else.  Would like but my english is not good enough.     Might be something to brag about if Kyoani had action scenes.    Hyouka airs   "hey guys wanna know what I thought of the latest episode   ZZZzzZZzz "  sleepingman.jpg    Hyouka ends   "le underrated patrician masterpiece"   "almost as good as Nichijou"          Boring to me = Unengaging plot, bad pacing, episodes feel dragged out.  Usually when I watch a Kyoani show, 20 minutes per week feel like they go by way too fast and at the end of the episode, I can't wait for more. Hyouka was the only Kyoani anime I ever watched where those 20 minutes felt like they were dragging on forever. At times I left it running in the background while doing something else, it was that fucking boring.      Do you have problems with the english language?   OFFICIAL RANKING ANTI-FAGGOTS  1- K-ON! 2- Hyouka 3- Chu2 4- Hibike 5- All the shit          &gt;"almost as good as Nichijou"  To be fair, tons of people hated Nichijou when it was airing.      what exactly is the problem with a studio doing one thing really well   The problem is it gets really boring and fucking predictable. I use to like KyoAni but these days imo they really have downgraded. It gets really tiring when you watch the same shit over and over again. It's good to have variety which KyoAni heavily lack and the reason why I don't care for any of their shows anymore.       *Nichijou ---&gt; Chu2     Everything is hated while it airs. Which means since Hibike is only a little bit hated it will soon be regarded as kyoani's biggest masterpiece ever.     Garbage tier   Tamako Market  nigga please. The movie is god tier and it compensates everything from the show.       Their fucking joke Chu2 battle segments blew every serious mecha anime and battle shounen of the last 10 years completely out of the water.      Chu2      Hibike is only a little bit hated it will soon be regarded as kyoani's biggest masterpiece ever.   It's pretty sad if some people actually believe this because Hibiki is really nothing special and below average.      Not quite yet. If it gets another season that's as good or better it might become one of my KyoAni favorites. Of course, there's one episode to go. Who knows, it might be spectacular.    I bet Kyoani could make some amazing paint drying animation. After all, look what they did with K-ON.     below average   That would be incredible.      But that isn't really a problem of the studio but with you getting bored of the genre itself. If you are getting sick of moe SoL, then just don't watch these type of shows anymore. Kyoani isn't obligated to make sure you are getting enough variety.    meant to quote <br/>    Switch Nichijou and Hibike and you have a dead    Knk action scenes were great.    Man I knew Kyoani fans were delusional but this is on another level.    And yet you didn't name a single show to prove me wrong. Figures.    That's what happens when a show is dropped by 90% of /a/ and a minority of retards is allowed to have their circlejerks giving them the impression that what they're watching is actually well liked because not even trolls keep bothering any more.    The movie was shit too.     This, since Haruhi kyoani has consistently made changes to improve the anime over the source material, or at least tried to. I think hibike is a good example, the way they exaggerate certain stuff and rearrange some things to make shit a bit more dramatic.      If you are getting sick of moe SoL   implying KyoAni does moe SoL  KyoAni does generic coming of age crap.       circlejerks   This is a circlejerk. In fact, everything that you like this season probably has a circlejerk thread going on. You might even say that everything is a circlejerk. Of course you don't think of it as a circlejerk if it's a show that you like.      If the show faces opposition, it's not a circlejerk.    Your taste is shit     Or maybe the minority of retards using the threads as a shitposting platform got bored after the episode 1 hype died down?     It was generic coming of age crap. Could as well have been published in a shoujo magazine.    Not really they made Shinichi completely irrelevant which was a bad move.    People got bored by the show, that's right. Not even the trolls kept bothering.    Hyouka has always face opposition.    The baiting is unnecessarily exaggerated and feels out of place in the overall scheme of the show.    Good, because it's shit.     Kyoani's specialty is obviously characters and character animation, and they excel at it. I think Hibike is the pinnacle of this. They take a bunch of shortcuts to try and make backgrounds sets and props look pretty good, but really they want to free up all their resources for character work. That's their bread and butter, and that's what pays the bills. Every show they make is designed around the characters having a shit ton of personality, and being incredibly expressive. At this one very particular thing, kyoani are the masters. It's literally the only think k-on had going for it, and that was wildly successful. Now in Hibike the characters, their animation, their writing, their actual physical acting, their voice acting, their relationships, their personalities, are the absolute centerpiece of the show. It has almost nothing else of value, and that's the whole strategy. Focus entirely on the characters, fuck everything else, fuck making the rest of the show look good, fuck the plot. If it doesn't support the characters then drop it.  And either you like that or you don't. They've figured out what their strengths are and they've chosen to specialize to an extreme. I like shows that are very character focused, so I like kyoani. I don't like everything they've done, I think the second half of hyouka was slow and had no stakes, I think k-on is draggy and filled with missed opportunities, but I like Hibike and Haruhi because the characters have personality, they're well written, and they have interesting depth.       That wasn't the point. Circlejerk was the point so you're obviously retarded and don't know what it is that you're talking about.    finally, a show about musi...    literally less music than K-On, shitty drama and pointless yuri-baiting      Kyoani choose to adapt the rest of their LNs  Which one, /a/?  At the end, we all know it'll end up shit anyway.       a bad move  I disagree.   I should preface this by saying that I think romance in anime is almost always bad. Anime excels at sort of background romance, where you don't know for sure if it's gonna go anywhere or not. Compare all of Yahari with the end of Yahari. When it was apparent that Yui was into MC, and there was just some awkward tension, then that worked well for the show, it just kept things interesting. But now that they're actually trying to work through the romance the show has turned into absolute dogshit. I don't believe that anime can really do actual romance well, I've never seen it (part of this might be a cultural thing, nips are crazy). They just do well teasing romance.  Anyway, I think that all the other relationships in Hibike are for more interesting than kumiko and shoe. Specifically, they decided to take kumiko and reina and turn them into a giant certerpiece of the show, which is great. Their relationship is incredibly interesting, by far the most interesting thing going on, and the show benefits from focusing more on them. There's no reina / kumiko scene than I think would be better cut for a reina / shoe scene.          Your favorite anime would be far better if it was made by Kyoani and you know it.  This. The KyoAni hate is all jealous moehaters, and I'm sure if KyoAni did nothing but shonen there'd be a shitload of hate directed from all jealous moelovers.       wants to hear music   watches a television series       None. I want an adaptation of this.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jZy<wbr>h5T6P-V4</wbr>  [ ]  I'll throw all my money to it.        Violet Ever Garden fucking where?     The main problem of KyoAni is that they always half-ass things.  They want to please everyone. On one hand they want to please otaku with cute girls, on the other hand they want to please the shoujo audience with ikemen and romance. However, they're afraid of doing either of it properly.  The end result is always disappointing, because neither romance nor moe SoL is done properly.          Kyoani Shop: The Animation     You're sort of just talking about the problem with the mainstream anime industry currently. They are forced to integrate all sorts of pandering shit in order to get funding, but they try to work around those limitations in interesting ways.      I think you're misunderstanding me. I have no problem with pandering, I have a problem with half-assed pandering, which KyoAni does.    The hype around this has already marked it for death. VEG isn't going to be the great savior of everything. We don't even know anything about it and it's already being hyped to death. When will you fucks learn.     mfw it's just another haremshit    $5 toothbrush   People are curious about it because it's Kyoani's first winner and there are no information about it, it's natural.    This. I love moeshit but they really need to branch out. Amagi is a good step in that direction. Hibike is just a poor man's Hyouka and there is just no real reason to watch it.    I only listen to opinions of people who were here before 2007. Anything after that and opinions about Kyoani is thrown away.   I'd have bought the fuck out of a Free toothbrush. Imagine all those half-naked attractive guys on that phallic shaped tool that you push in and out of your mouth until all that white liquid comes out. Hilarious.     all these kids who havent watched FMP   Amagi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hibikek   Chidori best girl    The only part I've seen is a webm where the girls get all really emotional from one other band member simply stating she wants to redo an audition or something mundane like that. I'm sure it was way less silly out of context, but it made me laugh.    that bit is probably the worst part of the show.    You can tell that most of the fanbase of KyoAni are newfags especially when they think Hibiki is the best thing KyoAni has made when it's not even that good.     image.jpg  Oh boy, it's this shitposting avatarfag again.    Why does everyone look like girls in part 5  The 80's were a different time  Because Araki likes to spice things up every now and a gain   Because your gender prejudice is too strong.      But Part 5 was serialized between '95 and '99.   Forget looking like girls, almost everyone has that same fucking face and build.  Fuck Araki, he sold his drawing talent in exchange for eternal youth.    I think he means the chronology   Early part 5 is arguably the worst art   really the biggest art change happened in Part 4    But mid part 4 was arguably the best    It's set in the 2000s    The worst is fucking 6. I cant believe this isn't general consensus.     There is literally no one in that image that I don't want to fuck in the vagina, wtf?!    To be fair that's entirely possible - he'd been trying to go with a female main protagonist since part 2 but his editors kept cockblocking him so he went "fuck it!" and just made them all reverse traps.  That and part 5 marked the point when he seemed to go more towards fashion models as body shape inspiration.            well, late 4 and early 5.     How is Bruno even standing like this? Are his feet glued to the ground?     this is why I need feminism.      But mid part 4 was arguably the best  that doesn't mean that the art didn't change.     I'm reading part 7 and I think sometimes Araki forgets that Johnny can't walk. The way he easily moves around is not something he could do crawling.  I want to ravage Narancia's boy pussy   I dunno.     Heyzeus's legs help him     I don't think the early 4 panel is representative.    Narcinia is best girl    Late 6 looks like shit, especially Jolyne that looks like a tranny.    The other thread got deleted it seems and there was some decent discussion in it too. Just don't name threads "edition" or "general" anymore, hopefully that will take the heat off.       sounds like the work of a moderator's stand     Are mods really deleting JoJo generals? Fucking finally.   A crack down on generals would severely increase the quality of the board.       What is 「GRAVITY」? Green baby don't hurt me     I thought they were purging them because there are usually multiple up at a time.   While the threads were fun there's nothing to talk about until JJL chapters/EoH trailer/general announcements of a Jojo nature. If jojofags really need a thread at the most have one weekly.  Why didn't Kira just use Sheer Heart Attack in the mansion instead on relying on slow ass air bubbles?   The one holding the knife is actually a girl... right?    A new chapter did just come out and we've actually had some unusually in-depth discussion about it over the last few days despite not even having a text translation yet. I understand why they'd want to get rid of generals but I think it's a real shame it happens just when all the cancer DIO's World brought in is finally clearing up.   That're some manly girls.   /ag/ when?    Nope    Because Araki just forgot.    Apparently the /a/ sings Jojo is going to be starting soon, someone said last thread that Jebus was going to pick it up. We should just stick to those threads.     Never.     Late part 7 is my favourite.    /r/ing an edit with them in the Gangstars' outfits and/or faces.    Early Part 3 was the best.     Because he knew they were aware of how it worked and he can only use one type of bomb at the time.     But Josuke couldn't do anything against it anyway,only Koichi could.   Araki got tired of drawing manly homos so he switched to twink homos.    He could divert it long enough to punch barrage Kira to death if he set something on fire.     Josuke could just punch it and it'd go back to Kira as his hand.    Early and Mid Part 7 was awesome, Araki started to suffer from his sameface syndrome around Late Part 7 and he has never stopped since then.    If he used Crazy Diamond's healing ability, it would go back to his left hand. Also, then he wouldn't be able to do anything offensively in that time period.    Actually at this point there's more variety than there was during either late 7 or the scratch nose era.   can anyone give me name of a music that is played during almost entire the world part from anime?   Darkness of the world i think.    Araki went through a David Bowie phase while writing part 5.     Araki had just learned to draw different faces around mid part 4 only to revert back to his sameface style in the next volume   Truly sad.  I think he hasn't found an equilibrium yet.        He got sick of people comparing his characters and artwork to Hokuto no Ken so instead of manly characters he went the opposite route and made them FABULOUS instead.    i love you     It's more like he didn't have to imitate HnK and buff 80's action stars once they went out of fashion and he became established enough to do his own thing when part 3 ended.     Didn't he lose it with his left hand?    It might just be my fetish for white hair talking, but I don't blame the Japs for liking Fugo as much as they do just because of his design.    I guess that worked out for him because that's what people prefer for him now, I mean fuck look at all the shit he's done since adapting that style.   NEWS ALERT-Actual Discussion approaching  http://jjlscans.tumblr.com/post/122<wbr>355928463/jojolion-44-delay   This month’s chapter is taking awhile because the store is slow to stock this issue and our Day 1 contact is hard to get in touch with this week.    Expect the chapter sometime really soon    Edited for brevity.       </wbr>     Fuck you.    No fuck you leatherman!    I liked the muscle bound style before part 4. Then everyone including Jotaro and Polnareff turned into fruit boys. There's manly fabulous and then there's faggot fabulous.    Both are acceptable as long as the source material is enjoyable. Like LotGH for example. Full of fruit boys, but still a great piece of work.     Early part 1 will always be objectively the worst.      it took me a while but damn.  J♂J♂     How did JoJo defeat DIO?   DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?        I need the pastebin guys    I totally agree with you, Mid Part 4 is beautiful.     calling Jotaro JoJo     In terms of story and characters the first 3 parts were the best, series went to shit after he was forced to make it more mainstream     http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     DIO's♂DARK♂FANTASY    http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     Jotaro could move for 2 seconds within DIO's time stop   DIO can stop time for 9 seconds (as High DIO)   Jotaro stops time at the 9 second mark   DIO can move for two more seconds (now 11 seconds)   DIO can't move anymore         The youngest JoJo is the relevant JoJo     Implying   tfw Araki will never ever make women as beautiful as in Phantom Blood.      DIO seemingly crushed Jotaro to death before the 11 second mark    Because Araki is a massive faglord, but a cool faglord.    Those are 12 year olds.    I know. It's ridiculous but you just have to go with it. Araki is known for drawing things happening and then having a character say it didn't happen.  Wheel of Fortune burning Jotaro for example and then just saying it was his coat.       not colouring the painting on the wall  lazy colour job      Implying  He started excelling with females at part 4     I love how Araki used to draw women, even before Jojo. Gorgeous Irene is really  gorgeous.     The anatomy's kind of crap but the faces are truly gorgeous. So expressive.      So since they found it necessary to notify us this time I'm assuming we might not even get it this month.  Shit happens and all that and I do appreciate that we get scanlations at all, but I just really want to discuss Karera and Josefumi with you guys.      Looks like early part 1.     Fugo is not blonde  Welp.     Nobody here know enough japanese to translate it?    Yeah, Gorgeous Irene is really wild.    They said to expect it really soon, I don't think that there's anything strange about them giving us an explanation for being a few days late.    It is.    I like it, looks original. I do like Part 8 art a lot but, the sameface is kind of annoying sometimes.     Can someone explain what they're even wearing?    Clothes.    Now here's Gorgeous Irene with the Steel Ball Run art style.    I fucking hate it, how did Araki lose the ability to draw expressions on people's faces?.  Look at this Gyro from mid Part 7       He started diversifying after Paper Moon King, I think it's a telltale sign that he became aware of it.      Now look at this one from Late Part 7, that expression on his face it's terrible, it doesn't look sexy, or intimidating, nothing.     I'll give you late 7 and very early 8 but here's plenty of expression now. Our main character this time is the kind of guy who doesn't show his emotions much to the people who normally surround him, but look at the others around him.      He looks like Iggy before having a human face   Oh God. People really shouldn't be trying this early to guess the designs.  How long do we have to wait an announcement of Part 4 anime?  Like a month ago someone told me to do the phonetically matched lyrics for Jonathan's Ballad. So, uh, here it is I guess.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RwN<wbr>jSwZD8e8</wbr>  [ ]     Awful.    Jojolion Volume 10. We first saw the Iggy promo on a flyer from the Volume.    Please don't use Casca as a reaction image, it'll make me feel bad for fapping to her getting raped.  I wish she enjoyed it as much as I did.    Gyro SAS announced.   I'm pretty curious to see how he'd draw him now. Karera gets a lot of really good panels in this month's chapter and her thick eyebrows reminded me of her a bit.    That's pretty nice, i love the song and Jonathan.    Damn, that's fucking nice, It makes me really appreciate Johnathan.    As dorky as it is to say, I understand why the guy yesterday said Jonathan was his favorite Jojo now.    Jonathan has always been my favorite Jojo     tfw we'll never get an OVA/HFTF The World    This should have played when Jotaro kill DIO.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Yqt<wbr>JqKgemw4</wbr>  [ ]     Making the video was such a treat for myself as well because Jonathan is also my favorite JoJo.     No Diego SAS   No Shadow DIO SAS   You'll never have 5 different Dio SAS figures        Jonathan is the kindest and most gentle JoJo in the entire series. He's Kenshiro if he wasn't so stoic.    Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?   I would let Diego fuck my ass<br/>     Where is the Pucci SAS, and the Whitesnake     Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?  That's like an anon if they breathe air.      no diego  it hurts.    At some point he played so much with the clothes that forgot the faces.   They did say they were doing more villain part 5 SAS then they'll move on to 7. Have hope anon.      Can't unsee young Dio      Italian civilian clothing To blend in     YOU THOUGHT IT WAS DIO? NO, IT WAS I, IRINE.     No, this is Dio.     Purest Jojo didn't deserve that fate   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DMj<wbr>hY98bf-g</wbr>  [ ]  I love DIO's adventures as a nun under a bridge in Japan.    Ｓｉｍｐｌｅ Ｓｕｂｊｅｃｔｓ Ｓｗｉｎｄｌｅｄ Ｓｗｉｆｔｌｙ ｆｏｒ Ｓｈｅｋｅｌｓ...  ...「ｓ4ｓ」     You lost. Now leave.    Far more HnK than JJBA.    This is the only good JJBA AMV I've ever seen in my life, and i'm not crying.    I wasn't trying, that was just the best image I have of [s4s]-tan    And to think I was just going to but the lyrics on a black screen to avoid being grouped in with the AMV crowd.    Araki can just recreate the late part 3/mid part 4 look can't he. If so, why doesn't he do that whenever he redraws characters from old parts. Jonathan looks like a downie in all the recent drawings. The Kenshiro look suited him.   J♂J♂'s Bizzare L♂cker R♂♂m    Because he can't recreate them.    what is the fastest stand? besides Made in Heaven of course   I heard he could. He said that in the J♂j♂nium volumes. He prefers the faggot statue of david sameface art.    possibly silver chariot without armor     Mind to post a link?   Weather Report when?      SUTAR PURACHIMA    Possibly. Even with armor, it matched Star Platinum in speed.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1XT<wbr>gcfwi_L8</wbr>  [ ] Did Kakyoin and Dio engage in homosex in Egypt, other than the fisting?     Fall♂off♂your♂horse    Now I want to reread/rewatch Phantom Blood. People seem to forget about how interesting it is because of the other parts, myself included.    they look the fucking same    DIO was his first friend.    He doesn't care how any old character looks after their part has ended and they'll never appear in the manga again. Check this out, it's from part 4's time.   He also doesn't care much for Jonathan. Back when he made his top 10 he was the only Jojo not on it.      Ah. Right there. Right there was the start of the downward spiral into sameface and scratched n♂ses.      Dio knew Kakyoin better than any of his other "friends" did       Still no C-moon.   ;-;   Spiral staircase.      No, that was always the way it was with old characters. Part 3 style Ikuro and Part 3 style young Joseph were just Jotaros, and Joseph and Jonathan looked the same a lot of the time to begin with.    what was that stand that moved through electricity? that may be the fasted     No C-Moon   No MiH      You could still tell between J♂seph and J♂nathan. I'd say it was part 3 that it became difficult to tell between the faces. Especially between Kekyoin and J♂tar♂.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V-B<wbr>Bt29m0I8</wbr>  [ ]   Kakyoin had a longer mouth and thinner eyebrows. He also didn't had a more colder facial expression rather than that eternally pissed look that Jotaro always had.    they specifically state that it's useless against josuke     You could still tell between J♂seph and J♂nathan  You couldn't even tell between Dio and Caesar     It doesn't really fit.   Can Yotsuba beat Jotaro?   Yes.   Well, now that the season is over I'm gonna probably start reading part 7, but I'd still like something to watch. Do you fellas have any recommendations for some fun, silly shonen like JoJo?   hokuto no ken    Between the different girls? Araki has never had much variety between female faces but I'd say he's doing quite a bit better than usual in that regard this time around. Hato is particularly distinct, but I wouldn't mistake Yasuho, Karera, or Daiya for each other either.    ya ya ya    They've never looked like women. Abandon your meme    soon...  happy birthday, lady jellyfish!   it's Namori's birthday, the creator of YuruYuri. But let's talk about a screenshot from Chinatsu's eyecatch where the animator fucked up her hand instead.   You have brought shame to our jellyfish overlord.     Shhh  Haven't you heard about the surprise party?      I'm doing it with my own hand right now and that's right, the flap of skin between the index finger and thumb goes inwards under the thumb and looks like that. It's drawn a little weird but it's right,    Then you must have some fucking chubby hands cause im doing the same thing   Since the season is almost over, can you already tell what was your AOTS, /a/? I'm still trying to decide between Part 3, Pleiades and Euphonium. There wasn't anything outstanding this time, but the majority of the shows were decent in my opinion.   Eupho    Pleiades probably.   Ninja Slayer. Expected it to be AOTS, was disappointed at the animation, then actually watched the first episode and was floored by how good it was.    Fate/stay night Unlimitef blade works. It's now one of my favourite anime ever.   1. Arslan 2. UBW 3. Show By Rock     Euphonium. Pleiades is second.     Kekkai Sensen anon.    Etotama and Gintama    Kekkai Sensen or Hibike. Oregairu and Oremono are up there too.    Stardust Crusaders  Punchline.  UFO or Punch Line, obviously.  Best of the season: Euphonium Worst of the season: Kekkai Sensen    This.   Sensen is my favorite so far. Eupho is the prettiest. Havent seen pleiades   Shit taste.     not watching the deepest anime of the season    Arslan. Hibikek Euphorium and KEKkai Sensen get 'best meme rivalry' of the season     Worst of the season: Kekkai Sensen  Owari was worse      I agree.     1. Kekkai 2. Pleiades 3. Part 3     I'm not going to attempt any kind of objective judgement or review here, personally Etotama was the one series I was looking forward to every week with excitement.  I'm not going to pretend it's anything other than sensory junkfood, but the girls are cute, the jokes made me laugh and I never fast forwarded through it, not even skipping the opening. That's pretty much an AOTS in my personal book.     AOTS: Gintama, honestly everything else had a GREAT start then went to meh WOTS: Triage X      Precure Thread    Pirika Pirilala Popolina Peperuto! Post the prettiest Cure!  And thus like a phoenix the Precure Thread is reborn. And so the Anons who want to die cannot for they are forever being reborn. With the thread Pslams for little girls ~ 82.  Yeah I don't know what I was going for there Have an Image       This gives me some kind of weird vertigo.     I'm going to marry Haruharu!   I really can't tell if you're serious or just shitposting because it's Smile. 22 was a fantastic episode.    Good luck, loser!    I'm going to pafu Pafu's pafus!        I haven't even watched Doki     Ded thread right from the git-go.   22 was edgy fedora shit and has no fucking place in Precure, madotard.    Swerving the livewatchers has been kind of a thing every now and again. I'm not sure why, though.    You should    Here, a meme response to your meme post.    Nice, I love meme games with censored lolis. So #based.    It's the top one, right?   It's because she the toy is made to push the jewel inward, right?      W-what's got you so mad?    I love this epic stuttering meme! You're just like a kawaii moe loli!      Please don't do that here.        Don't you start with that Meme-x shit. I get enough of it elsewhere Also please stop acting like an ass.        Care to talk about it?    I'll stop if you delete your fucking retarded wrestling shit, you underage /v/tard.    Please post Precures in the Precure thread.   This thread is going well.   Pic unrelated?    You first.   How technologically inclined is your waifu? Does she need help using computers? Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?     She can't really do that, she's not here physically after all, only in soul.  But my Yunocchi isn't a very technical person, that's for sure, but it's not like she's never used a computer! So Yuno would most likely ask for my help with anything technical around the house.      Makoto has a lot of technical stuff in his room like a TV, game consoles and a computer but he doesn't seem particularly knowledgeable about it in general, maybe above average. His strong fields are physical activities after all.   deder than bread up in here   She could use it just fine.    I don't really think she would be especially savvy. She shouldn't have much problems with just using computers or other devices, but she rather wouldn't be able to repair them.   It's not the best time to start thread.        Mai doesn't use computers and the type of weapon she uses was invented in the Bronze Age. So it could be argued that she isn't particularly proficient with technology.    She's got skills, can do the best programming, especially vidya. Well if it gets a virus or something, she can help me too.  Pretty much.  It's 1:45 am here, i think i will sleep and post again later   And at least leaving one question: Do you have something in common with your waifu?          Does your waifu ever have sleepovers with her friends? What does she do in them or what do you imagine she'd do if she doesn't have any?  (Mai does appear to do so based on this image. From what we can see, she and her friends appear to be trying on cosmetics such as nailpolish, styling their hair differently and putting on different clothes.)    I want to kiss my waifu on the nose.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127107959  What is the point of this post?    He's an underage spammer/shitposter.   Does your waifu resemble her parents or other relatives?  (Mai as a teenager does appear to resemble her mother. She's never shown clearly but they both have long hair of the same color and hair antennae. Beyond that she doesn't have any siblings and no other relatives of her other than her parent are shown.)     Well, with all the high-tech gear she uses, I'm guessing either she built them herself or she at least knows how to maintain them.  That is, she's much more technically inclined than I could ever be.    She's ronerier than I am.          We both are introvert and we both enjoy romantic setting/activities, I guess.   I dunno, she would probably just do usual activities in them like talking, having fun by styling each other hair.  She would be really embarrassed if someone asked her about relationship with me~    I want to kiss my waifu on everywhere. Especially on the lips.   No idea. There is no info about her parents.             We share a bunch of minor personality traits, but other than that we're not that alike, it's more that Yunocchi and I make a good match.   Usually when they have a little tea party in one of their apartments, it's easier and more fun to stay over.  Just normal teenage girl stuff, nothing particularly out of the ordinary.   She does, they are her parents after all.             Seeing as her very existence was erased/cursed by the most badass of overlords, nobody really knows if she even HAS parents.    In almost every way possible, we're exact opposites. She's incredibly determined, passionate, unyielding and has pretty damn good hand-eye-coordination. The only thing we have in common is probably the fact that we're both pretty shameless.   There isn't a single part of her body I wouldn't want to put my lips on.  What would you give your waifu for her birthday?  If I could somehow make it happen, I'd give my waifu  Makai Wars 2 .              She's really good with tech.   Not too much, I guess love for robots.   One ending in the game.   Looks somewhat similar to her sister.             She's probably adept at casual browsing but nothing of the programming sorts! She can most definitely handle most things on her end as long as it isn't too complex. She's definitely the leading pioneer in my heart's fields!  As for making or repairing, my dreams and my heart. She's made many of my nights wondrous, and a lot of my days bearable.   We've both had bad moments in our childhood and have trust issues.   She has! She either hogs the pools or stays away from all the ruckus and trouble.   She looks like a less mature and certainly less volatile version of her mother, and she'd probably get annoyed at me if I said that. She does share a lot of traits from both parents, but didn't really show much resemblance to them as a young child.   I wish I could keep giving her the same smiles and happiness that I often see her in. I wish I could keep giving every time, every day just to see her smile, but the times are a bit tough and I haven't had the ability to in the past eight months. It feels bad, but I hope that one day that it'll all even out and everyone goes home happy.                  Something she has lately showed interest in, eg. a dress she said that looks nice or jewelry she find nice. Otherwise, something related to her hobbies, like new microphone, headphones or something. And I would also take her on a really nice date to the place she really like, of course.   How long would you wait to have children with your waifu? Would you do it right now, wait until you get financially stable and had house or maybe wait for both of you reach particular age?        Never. I don't want children now or in the future.    I'd love it if she makes a song for me.  We're both weird and we like music.  I think she sleeps with her friend before her friend died. They were close and always stick together because of work, after all.  She doesn't resemble her uncle which is the only shown relative so far.  I'd give her a sword because she likes those.  I'd wait till we get married. Of course I want us to have a stable life first, we're married and has her family's approval before making kids, I don't want her family to get angry to her.              She's never used one before, so she'd need some help with it.  She makes my day.    Nothing major.   No, and i don't think they're really her kind of thing.   She shares some traits with her sister.   Something she's shown interest in, along with what i bake for her.   I'd wait until she'd be in good health.                    Very technologically inclined, for obvious reasons. Can't really say she's the leading pioneer though, as she's one of the mass-production models. Then again, she's the only remaining one, can't really say in that case. She aced all the engineering classes, so I'm betting she could fix most kinds of machinery. I'd want her to teach me some too.  A few things. We both like machines, have no patience for indirect approaches, say what's on our mind without holding back. She's a lot more positive and hopeful though.  Haven't seen her do sleepovers. But if she did, probably the same things girls do on such occasions. Talk a lot, be made to wear cute outfits, play those silly truth or dare games.  Just hope they don't decide to do a pillow fight, because if so, say goodbye to the bed.   I want to kiss her everywhere. But today, I'm inclined to forehead, in a loving praise sort of way.  Not in a physical sense. Despite mass production, they all differ from each other in small but significant ways. As for her 'mother', she resembles her very little.  I wish I could give her eternal happiness. But if you mean like an object, then I'd commission  Robocop's gun arm  for her. She might like it.  A trip to a science fair or an escapade to travel around and see the world are good options too.  Wait until we've accomplished all our dreams, so that we can finally settle down with no regrets. Then we can  construct  offspring, maybe adopt too.                    Hello!  He seems talented enough. Most pillar men are so intelligent that they tend to refer to the latest human technology as mere toys. Then again, I'm sure if he actually tried to use something like a computer, he might find himself surprised!   Something tells me that we'd repair things together or hand the job to whichever one of us has the time to do it. I do come from a family that likes to tinker with things after all, so it's not like I'm totally helpless when it comes to things like plumbing or mechanics. There's nothing we wouldn't be able to fix, I don't think.    We love niceu fightos!    A manly sleepover? Sounds interesting. Then again, considering his series, I wouldn't be surprised if a sleepover he'd go to played out much the same way.  I want to have a private sleepover with my husbando and do each other's nails!     We never see his parents and he has no siblings. I do have some pictures that someone made of what his parents could possibly look like, however! Naturally, his father resembles him quite a lot.    A birthday party! Something tells me that he's never been thrown one, which makes me very sad.    Whenever we're both ready. There's a lot of things to consider when it comes to having sonfus, of course.                          Is your waifu self-conscious about the size of her breasts?  Do you like your waifu's VA? How popular is she?   Mai is very polite, which is something I think I share with her, at least to an extent.  Perhaps she would like an antique blade.  Some greater stability would be good.  No, she's pretty well endowed and doesn't seem to concern herself with her chest size. If anything, she makes her less endowed friends feel jealous.  I hadn't really paid attention to Saori Hayami before she started voicing Mai, but since then I have been paying attention to her roles. She's very popular and cam third in this VA poll: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-04-06/kana-hanazawa-hiro<wbr>shi-kamiya-lead-in-favorite-voice-a<wbr>ctor-poll/.86759</wbr></wbr></wbr>             Probably average levels of tech understanding for a Japanese high schooler, maybe a little less because she's clumsy   We're clumsy   Don't know but I hope so given she lives alone and is probably lonely.   Who doesn't?   She doesn't seem to resemble her brother and you never see her parents   A comb or hair clips for her beautiful hair   Financial and emotional stability should be a prerequisite for having children. Age and marital status are less important so long as the woman isn't too young or old to have children meaning anywhere outside 15-40 years old.   She's self conscious of her weight which is maybe related to the size of her breasts.                        How would you respond if you discovered that your waifu used to be a man?   Well, she piloted a Mecha once so she knows enough about technology. All in all she is pretty intelligent.   We're both kinda lazy and we both love pizza. I also like teasing my friends like she sometimes does.  I really would love to have a children with her but I don't think I would be a good parent.  She slept really long in Lelouchs room do you could count that as sleepover, but if it's a sleepover with her friends and stuff, they would probably eat fast-food, talk all night long and sleep till noon.          I'm sure we would really like to have children sooner, but we would wait until we got house with enough space for kids and until we would be financially stable. I want to be sure our kids will have good living conditions.   Probably. However I would remind her that her bust size is perfect for me and that it looks really cute and arousing with her petite body multiple times.   I don't care about her at all. She doesn't even sound like Miku.          Not really, but sometimes it is shown that she hides her breasts. I hope she gets more confident about her perfect chest.  She's the most popular seiyuu of this age, and she's named as "The Queen of Anison". Fuck yes, I like her. I admire her a lot.  I won't be that shocked, since she's manly anyway, she gets more bitches than I do.        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Fuck off, retard. No one cares if your feelings are genuine.  The correct term for loving multiple 2D girls is harem and there are dedicated threads for people like you. Waifu threads are meant only for people who are in love with only one girl so you will never be welcomed here. Leave this place and go to harem threads.     Not really, no. She helped out with water damage, at least.   Brown hair and eyes.   There was that OVA released a few days ago where she's at one with the other fairies, so it's not out of the question. They'd most likely drink and have food, maybe talk about the day.   Never say her parents.   That one BL doujin that'll most likely get burned if TPP passes today.   Until we are both ready for a child and at marriage. The 25 range seems most suitable.   Shocked at the fact that she was a man, then shocked that she might actually be gay.  I'd still keep her, though.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Get out.  Does your waifu ever read any doujins? What kind, if she does, and what kind do you think she'd read if she didn't? Non-H works are acceptable answers.                           Unfortunately, yes. I want to alleviate her of her insecurity by reassuring her that they're gorgeous  or just repeatedly impregnating her until they're a few sizes larger .    She replaced the battery in my F 91-W  Hardly  I doubt it  The world may never know  A Nixie clock. Or maybe a snowglobe, snowglobes are cool  Maybe in the late 20's. Sounds like a much better age to start. Better to wait until one is finished with education and has a career  They're not badly sized, I doubt it.  Oh my, the voice. The VOICE. It might be the most sexy thing about her  My dong only expands further <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  In my particular case it's inevitable. For other waifus, absolutely haram                      That wouldn't change anything about her, so I don't see why one should focus on the past. I think that the reaction of Mai's friends when they discovered about her past (illustrated here) is a good one.  I'm pretty sure that Mai has never read any doujinshi, since most of the world's nuclear armaments were dropped on Japan and wiped that country off the face of the Earth close to a century before she was born. She's pretty innocent.and easily embarrassed though, so I imagine that she'd prefer to read light-hearted humorous non-H doujinshi.      She lives in Soul Society which is essentially feudal Japan, the only people using advanced technology belong to the Technological Development Department which she is not a part of. She has spent a lot of time on earth and knows about our technology I.E computers but I doubt she is well versed in utilizing them.  I'd say we're both bold and heavily supportive of our friends.  She sleeps in MC's closet whenever she comes to earth. She doesn't partake in any activities outside of the usual drawing and reading. I don't think she has actually ever had a traditional sleepover.  Don't we all?  She looks almost identical to her late sister and looks eerily similar to her adoptive brother despite no blood relation.  Something chappy related, probably a plush toy. Perhaps a brand new set of high quality drawing utensils, she loves to draw after all.  Not the largest fan of kids, but with her there is a possibility. I'd want to take proper responsibility and thus wait until we're both financially able to support a child as well be being both physically and mentally ready to support the child.  Her breast size is rather small, especially compared to other characters in the same series  not that I'm complaining of course  but she never mentions or even implies she is bothered by it at all. She doesn't care one bit, which is great.  Fumiko Orikasa is great, she's the perfect voice for Rukia. She's voice acted quite a few characters but she's mainly known for her role of Rukia.  Hey, friend.  Orihime a cute.   We talking magical transformation or post operation? I'm surprised to say the least.                                she's pretty good with technology, and can figure anything out if there's a manual to skim through   we're pretty similar, especially in terms of sleepiness and personality.    Most likely. They have a camping trip, in which she spends the entire time asleep - waking up when it's time for food.    Her Grandmother is her only living relative, and they look incredibly similar.    a book, or something cute.   probably never   not really, but she's certainly aware in the difference between her breast size and that of her well endowed friends.   Yep,the voice is perfect. She's not very well known though.   I don't think so.  you're waifu a cute, by the way  If money wasn't an option, where would you take you're waifu on holiday? What would you do?                            Don't derail the thread.  Ded tred. Are waifus finally obscure again?    Basic as fuck, watches idol videos on YouTube. Yes. Nope, she's dumb as fuck but is a natural leader (which I like).  She gave me sweets, different each time.    We are both hyperactive, klutz, disorganized usually, air-headed and one-track minded. Also very stubborn.   Yes. Practices, swims (if pools or at the beach), and eats for days; pillow fights are possible and tends to wander around while asleep.   More on her mother. Slight resemblance to her little sis.   Bread with strawberry jams. Varied imports.   Need a house or two so she can be at ease.   Not really.   Yes! Quite a bit, I suppose.                           Not in the near future.  Maybe once (if) she manages to syujinko it up.    She's not flat, and she never seems to have any trouble with them. With her recent Idol escapades, I'm sure she's pretty satisfied with her own body.    tfw different VAs for every game    Wouldn't really change much. The past is the past afterall.   Unfaithful manwhore.                I'm quite sure she's the type to use Doujinshi as "research material".    Until we're financially stable and emotionally ready.  But definitely not before Yunocchi had a chance to explore and further her artistic path!   Only a tiny bit, it doesn't come up all that often. Though she generally tends to be a little insecure.   She's pretty popular, mainly thanks to the role in which she voiced my wife. A good voice actress all around.            Oh shit   is meant to be<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200       My waifus   Her VA is in everything this season. It's great to hear her voice in so many roles.    I'm pretty sure she doesn't. She probably wouldn't watch any pornography at all.   Rented house near sea. We would go to beach a lot, explore nature around, watch sunsets etc.   Why would they? It's normal for a thread to be slow at this time of a day.         <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115413  It doesn't matter. How would you feel if your waifu had another man? It's the same as NTR-ing your waifu.  Falling in love with multiple people comes off as never truly falling in love with a single one of them.  Harems a shit       Who made it law that someone can only "truly" fall in love with one person? Seems arbitrary to me.     law  Do you have reading comprehension issues?     6 pm isn't a slow time here    My point in saying that is that everybody acts as if it's law, when it's not. Love knows no man-made arbitrary rules. Who is anyone to deny you your love because THEY deem it unfit?    It's not about your feelings, dipshit, but about the girl's.   Enough about polygamy! Question time!  What couple activity would you like to do with your waifu? Yes, watching vietnamese pictographs count as a couple activity if you're doing it together.  We'd probably play vidyas together and she would probably rant about how the RNG hates her.        How retarded do you have to be to not understand what people are saying to you? <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113477  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115002      People like that are just egotistical scum, they don't even stop for a second to thing about the girls' feelings. It's despicable.   I doubt she would, unless maybe for artistic references. She'd rather read the original work to begin with, though.     I'm not much for travelling, but for my Yunocchi's sake, we'd most likely to any location with a rich art history. If she's having fun, then I will be too!          I understand what they're saying. I just think they're wrong.   Why? Isn't having actual discussion more interesting than playing questionnaire?      Stop taking the bait.   She seems somewhat computer literate. Nothing spectacular, mind you, but nothing minor either.  We both have a thing for good music, plus we're pretty similar in terms of personality.  Quite often. She's pretty closely knit with her friends, though what exactly happens during these sleepovers is beyond me. As long as it doesn't involve leek sticks being stuck in awkward places...  Hard to answer. There's no info on her parents, and she isn't the type to talk about them.  The best platter of tuna sushi that I can prepare.  Definitely the latter. She still has a career to think about, and I don't want to do anything that might bring that to an end.  Wouldn't mind trying, though...   She can be, but only because of the attention they bring her... She might not be the biggest, but they are big enough to draw the eyes of the jealous and lecherous.  She's got a nice sultry voice. Can't say anything too bad about Yuu. Though a high point would be hearing her squee as Sakaki in a certain scene from Azumanga Daioh.  Well, nobody's perfect.  Highly doubtful. Then again, her mind can be particularly lewd when she wants.  A nice stroll through a park sounds nice. Just have to find a nice park in my area.  A nice sea cruise to the tropics. She's always loved being out on the water.                          Having a stroll while holding hands and talking together, cuddling under blanket in front of fireplace at winter evening, kissing while watching stars or sunset and much more.   Not in USA.       Don't tell me what to do.    Obligatory    she would download ALL the dolphin screensavers. those free toolbars also sound useful   most of the related group-trip is off camera, but its one of the few times shes shown interacting with just other girls aside from that her sister also stays with them so it's sort of like every night is a sleep over   her hair colour is similar in the second season but aside from that they don't look much like their younger sister and her parents are never shown.   my stance on it has flip flopped a lot back and forth but I think I'd really just have to ween her character into it I might start her off with a puppy so she gets used to having responsibility, I also like dogs myself so its not that big a deal if I end up taking care of it on my own or something  I'd love to have a daughter with her, just thinking about it makes my heart race a bit, but there is so much to think about before then.    no, she's incredibly non-self-conscious about just about anything   they're both great her jap isn't that popular, and also voiced one of the most hated characters on /a/, but her dub has a massive history of roles with some of the most popular dubs on /a/, notably bebop   given her abilities I suppose it's not exactly impossible, but it also would be by magic instead of snapping a dick off and making a flesh hole so I'm down.   she's read regular manga, so I'd think she'd have no issues reading non-h it'd be interesting walking in on her reading an h-doujin not hearing me come in with her face blushing  I'm not sure whether I'd sneak out so I don't get bludgeoned for spooking her or sneak in further and try to initiate by kissing her neck while shes concentrating    gardening seems nice, though I'd be a little afraid if she got too enthusiastic she might somehow acquire some sort of giant venus fly trap that keeps us at bay from the garden until it dies                                  Does your waifu know how to please a man?   Shinobu's pretty smart. She's one of the more talented biopsychologists in Academy City although not the best, and she's pretty proud of it. She's also confident with machines and computers.  I don't think she can help me with my psychology, my biology, maybe.   I don't believe she has sleepovers, since she previously used to live alone and didn't have any friends. She probably does with Janie and Febrie now though.   I couldn't say, since her relatives and such were never shown.   Spend time with her. She likes reassurance that she's doing good.    Probably would prefer to wait until we had a house. However, a lot of that stuff can be excuses, and she's shown that she's partial to kids so the answer would be 'as soon as possible'.   She never mentions anything like that, so she probably thinks that it's silly. Or maybe she does privately.   Hayama Ikumi? She's okay, not super popular. I haven't gone out of the way to check her roles out, and none of them that I've heard are anything like Shinobu.   I'd be surprised at how advanced science has come.   A relaxing resort or the like.   We could visit cafes often, does that count? OR take Janie and Febrie around to play and shit.   Boy, reading the word 'couple activities' used to make me mad.   Blogshit warning: I've recently been questioning myself a lot because 80 - 90% of my thoughts regarding her have been of wanting to do lewd stuff, which does betray a certain shallowness. I'm not quite sure how to overcome this, I probably need to give more thought to her personality.                                    Not at all.   Amusing ones.   That's a cute outfit.   Sex.             She's really good with Technology, she's always on her laptop and she's great with tinkering electronic devices  She made some headphones once as a gift, they are described as "revolutionary" which shows off her amazing skill     Quick, share one sexual fantasy you have with your waifu  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127117509  The waifufags are the worst.    We both love technology and music, i mostly like calm and relaxing environments and so does she, and we both like sharing random trivia   She has a really close friend but she moved away, i don't think she has any sleepovers   I'd give her a brand new laptop, hers must be pretty old That and a piece of jewelry, maybe a necklace           I want to  make love to her  in the  missionary position  while I  hold  her soft, warm  hands  and then  cuddle  afterwards    Fuck her cute butt.    Making love in formal wear comes to mind.   Alternatively omorashi      The fanbase considers her a queen in that regard.  In the shower or on a billiard table.      I wanna give her a slow pleasurable oral while she wraps her thighs around my head and i massage different parts of her   She's a Super Class A hacker   Ahh, but how is she when she doesn't surf?    But I thought she was incredible math    Rather not, but I would lead her to make us both feel good. Her pleasure would be more important to me though.   Romantic, passionate sex in lotus position while embracing tightly and looking into each other eyes, I guess.        Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?   How can she? She's not real.      Chihiro prefers to read books on paper, but she's accepted the growing influence of the internet and its effects on people.   We're both huge nerds who love art   Book covers.  And books to put those covers on    Until we're in a stable life situation and after we're married.   No   Yes, but not that popular. It's good, since i don't have to think of her in other roles much.   It's Chihiro I care about, but this scenario is neither here or there since she's cis  love    Probably, she loves Shoujo manga so despite fandom claims I don't think she'd read yaoi.   We'd watch movies. Chihiro doesn't like reading together since she'd want to talk if we're around, so movies sound like they would work.  How would you greet her after you've had a long day of work? I'd give her a hug and kiss and if she weren't too busy I'd invite her to lay down and watch something with me.                              Thanks.   Sex with her on my lap  while interlocking our fingers    L-Lewd!          I'd wait until we both have a stable situation, a home and a good income   She doesn't seem to be too worried about it, she seems happy with herself as she is, which is great   I do, Mamiko Noto does a great job showing Fuuka as the gentle and caring person she is   I'd probably take her sightseeing, there's not much to do in port Island but I'm sure we could just walk around and make a picnic under a three or watch some movies   We'd go sightseeing and taking photographs, we could also watch some live music shows and concerts                That's too private to say!    But it's not like I hadn't mentioned face sitting and spanking her cute butt before.    A long and tight hug, then pick her up for a kiss, and carry her right to bed for some quality cuddling time.        I'm going to impregnate Nero! I love my emperor!   I think that New Zealand would be an interesting country to visit.  I used to do fencing. Maybe we could try that out and see what I remember, though she would trounce me quite effortlessly. (I did foil while her fighting style resembles the sabre but I don't think she'd have any problems adapting.)  She's a virgin and has never had a boyfriend, but I'll wager that she knows what she'd need to do for that.  A hug and kiss sounds like a good way to proceed.          I'd hug her and ask how her day went, serve her some tea, give her a massage to relieve her stress, and make sure she's satisfied and relaxed  Question What would be your waifu's ideal vacation?  (Fuuka seems the type of girl who'd love a nice landscape, i imagine taking her some place with lot's of wilderness)         If she's home when I am, I'd greet her with a warm hug and some tender words. Usually depends on how exhausting my day has been.   She seems fond of any place with nice scenery, though she seems especially lively near the ocean. It's part of the reason I'd like to take her on an ocean cruise one of these days.  I've only been on one, and I wouldn't mind giving that same experience to someone close to me.        The size, not really. She may feel bad that they aren't soft though.  Haven't really seen a lot of other stuff she's done, but I like what I've seen. Unsure how popular she is, but she doesn't seem to get many roles.  Not very surprised. She may look like and identify as a girl, but she has turned out to be rather flexible in that regard.  I would hope she wouldn't read them at all. Otherwise I may get really clumsy flirting or awful jokes thrown at me.  Actually, that sounds kinda nice .  I don't think she's ever been to the mountains. Let's go there.  So many things: Playing games. Cuddling. Going out holding hands. Take her to a fancy party and dance. Sparring. Go shopping.  Fighting evil back to back against impossible odds, and propose there and then. It's the most romantic setting of all.   You lost me.  Well, the most sexual thing we could possibly do would be  hugging .  Hello Chihiroman!  Say "I'm back", receive "Welcome back".  But that's not enough, gotta wrap an arm around her waist and pull her in for a kiss. Or nuzzle her neck with my nose, that's fine too.   She enjoys learning and seeing new things, so the best thing for her would be a trip around the world. 80 days might not be enough though.                                She at least knows how to use a computer but I doubt she's tech savvy. Well she could give herself the necessary skills to be.  Pretty opposite except for a love of things that are artistic.  Seen pics of her and Casko sleeping together so I guess that counts.  She does resemble her mother and if you buy into the theory that she and Arturia are related then of course they resemble each other.  Almost like clones or something.<br/>   I always have trouble thinking of something for this but maybe a party and a trip to the theater.  I don't really want any and she seems like she'd be too busy but if she wanted it then I would wait till things settled down.  Naw. She knows she looks great.  Sakura Tange is great and I would think she would be popular for voicing Sakura Kinomoto.  Not surprised. I guess that's how she really got away with being recorded as a man.  She hasn't been shown to but I can see her reading yuri ones. Also ones about herself.  Perhaps a trip to the most beautiful cities in Europe.  I'd like to work on an art piece with her and take part in one of her plays.  Man and/or woman, her technique is the best.  Steamy sex in the bath.   Looks like she's popular.                                 Almost our entire relationship is based upon things we have in common, it's what attracted me to her so much in the first place. We are lazy, daydreamers, prone to hoarding, dislike bureaucracy, love potatoes, enjoy inebriation, navigate life at our own slow and steady tempo, and a lot more to boot!  Talking, fun, teasing, drinking, playing and sleeping.  Her twin sister Ursula looks precisely the same as her, just with glasses.  I'll think about that next April.  As long as we need. I really want to, but realistically, we're still too lazy as of now.  Not usually. She looked a bit miffed in S2/E10 when Francesca groped Hanna but aside from that one time, she seems fine with her petite bust, even when surrounded by larger girls. In any case, I prefer slim girls. Built for speed!  I think Sakura Nogawa is somewhat underrated, although that could just be my own bias.  If money isn't an option, then we'll have to make do with camping in the forest nearby.  She pleases me regularly but I prefer to please her.  Ignore those who would attack that as blogshit, as they'll only be crying about the questions and lack of interaction later. Anyway, what you describe may not be shallowness as much as becoming carried away with lewdness, which is something that can happen to many of us (including me). At any rate, you seem to be able to answer the questions well.  Being handcuffed as she sits on my face while lovingly applying a pleasure/pain combo of oral and CBT! Well, you did ask...  Standard-issue hug and kiss, quickly wash my face and hands, followed by a makeout session on the couch/bed. This may lead to either cuddling, lewd, or both!  Anywhere with sun and good ice-cream, so she can just eat and relax in the shade.                            Changing waifus is degeneracy, right?    Same here     Not necessarily, it wholly depends on the specific circumstances.  But most excuses are scummy.      She is never seen using computers. I think she may need some assistance in using a computer.  We have a couple of things in common like fighting for our friends.  Yes she definitely does. She is the one who make cake and stuff to eat and she is the lewdest around them.  Oh yea Akeno looks exactly like her mother  I would give her lingerie  She would want me to get settled into a house then have our child  Biggest bust in the series she doesn't care  I love her VA. She is pretty popular http://myanimelist.net/people/93/It<wbr>ou_Shizuka  Why should that matter I dont think she would change if she was a he  She does not read doujins though she does watch   porn   on her free time  I would take her to   Go to the movies then go to my home and relax  If you mean massages and finger licking   SAndM with her which turns to passtionate sex to make children            </wbr>                   Vidya, naps, and the aforementioned pictographs.    kissu and cuddles, and a cup of tea.    somewhere quiet, like a nice forest lodge.          Chihiro's ideal vacation is sort of like Kyoto: Lots of stuff to see and a relaxing area. Distant, yet familiar at the same time.  The Fushimi shrine is also in Kyoto but that has not much to do with it and is likely coincidence    Hello, Aigisfriend! Chihibro is fine, really. I do wish there was a way I could get to know you more, I like getting to know my fellow Personafriends.        She's average at it, she knows how to use her computer/phone, she have no problems with these kind of things.  She made  me happy.    Minor personality traits, we love cute stuff, and both afraid of heights.   She had a few of them. They did a lot of stuff in them, played games, girls talk, she really enjoyed them.   I want to headpat the bassist.   Her parents are never shown, and she's the only kid of the family, so I have no answer to this question.   A new amp.  That's what she was thinking about what she would buy if she had extra money  But also a nice gateau au chocolat, flowers, and a few other things.   Until we have our own place, and a stable situation.   She is. Her best friend is also jealous of them at the beach.   I like her and she's kinda popular.   I would wonder what kind of technology was used, because there's not a single trace of her previous self, she can even be pregnant, that's amazing.   Never.   A tropical island, where we could be alone on the beach, relax, play in the water, sunbathe, and do lewd things. Or maybe a nice cabin in the Alps, mountains are lovely, I've always loved them  and the word Mountain is also in her name, that's a sign    Taking bass lessons with her as the teacher. Biking together. Cuddles.  I love her.                                                 she is better than that    J-Jellycatz? You are still alive?     She does use magitech a lot and doesn't need help with those computers, but she's not exactly an expert with that stuff.   We both care about justice.   I can see a resemblance to her mother, and she looks like Alicia for obvious reasons.   Not any specific age, just when we both fell like we're ready.   She seems fine with their size.   She's extremely popular, and I really like her. Can't wait for that Live Acoustic BD.   Someplace on a lake where we could spend time together.   Build Gunpla together.   A hug and kiss, and ask her how it went.                             If Yomiko reads a book on the subject I think she can master the computer     Something in common  Our love of literature    I imagine Nene sleeping over whenever she would come to do the cleaning    Her parents are never seen so I have no idea    A bunch of books or try to track down a signed edition of one of her favourite her novels    A couple years, that's if we really want too.    I think she's pretty oblivious to how big they are    Yomiko's VA has only voiced her    Probably not doujins but I imagine her reading good old lewd literature    Probably Paris for literary reasons     Reading together, going to bookshops and just buying what we can find, going to book festivals.    Making love to Yomiko against a book case in a library, trying to be as quiet as possible as we undress one another, next would be bending her over a table and doing doggy.     A hug then kiss and I'd tell her I would prepare some tea, maybe a shoulder rub or foot rub to go along with it.  What have you done for your waifu lately? I've bought about 16 or so books lately which I hope Yomiko would enjoy.                                                        I've been exercising and arranging my folders a lot i need to have it all nice and tidy    Apart from the an eager hug, a long relaxing dinner and getting shit about our respective days off our chest, if she wants.    Mentioned it earlier - nothing too stimulating, something chill like a cruise or resort. I'd like that too.   Thanks again.   I made a new reference pic for WWD, eh, and wrote some stuff. I 'went out' with her a few times. Saw a Railgun LN in the bookstore which made for a strange experience.  How do you guys feel 'close' to her - following a routine, doing stuff, looking at merch?               Rather than going to a single location a luxury cruise with just the two of us sounds pretty great.  Couple activity? Now I'm no romantic but things like; Video games, watching movies, cooking and just generally hanging out with her would be a lot of fun.  She knows how to please me. Thats enough.  Bondage sounds like something worth trying out. If only once.   Welcome home! Shall I run you a bath? Or perhaps you'd like something to eat? Or maybe...you want me?   My geography is bad, I can't name a single place. But Rukia really likes high places, so someplace with mountains, maybe cliffs.                <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  It's a thing with squares that you eat for breakfast, but that's not important right now.   she is a gamer   I think Kagura knows the basics. She wouldn't accidentally download a load of viruses on a computer or anything like that.  She repaired  my soul.    We both like videogames and swimming.   Her parents have never been seen, so I can't say for certain.   I bought her a necklace for her birthday last year. Nothing too fancy, just something she can wear all the time. I haven't thought about what to do for this year.   We'd definitely need some financial stability;  there's no way I could afford having a child on a part time wage.  A house/apartment to ourselves with plenty of space would also be a good idea.   Not really,  she's pretty endowed as is.    Kuwashima's one of the best, in my opinion. She has great range and has done a lot of work since the mid-90's, and still going.   It wouldn't change a thing between the two of us.   I don't think she does, but if she did I could see her being into shounen/sports manga.                             absolutely none at all   Working on my outer appearance. Trying to look good for her.  Come next week, I'll be training to become an instructor.    Listening to her songs is usually the way to go when I'm home. Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side; it's a feeling that flares up even more when I come across merch of her. Mostly, though, I feel close to her during my training. Thinking of her gives me the drive to intensify my efforts and keep pushing forward.        Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side  amen to that     I stare at her photos all the time and i play Persona 3 a lot and speak with her in-game    Road trip across the coast of France and along southern Europe.   There's so much I could think of! Spending the day at the beach or a water park is pretty high up on my list though.   Wanting to do lewd things with your partner is a natural part of the relationship. As long as the two of you are fine with it, there shouldn't be any need to worry.   I want to  2lewd4u  her in the  censored.    Lift her up as we hug eachother, and give her a peck on the cheek.   She'd love to visit America sometime, but she's a little concerned about flying.   Depends on the circumstances.   I did a pretty intense workout with her the other day.  No, not that kind of workout.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893   A wonderful little pile of love!    Going out jogging, exercising, looking at pictures of her, and the daki.                               I think it would be her greeting me first. She would hug and kiss me. Then I would probably go rest somewhere with her so we could talk about our day and maybe plan how we will spend the rest of the day.   Any warm, nice place where we could spend lot's of time outside, I guess.   Nothing more than usual things, like listening to her songs, cuddling and talking to her in bed etc.    How do you guys feel 'close' to her  Well, the closest I feel to her is when I cuddle and talk to her daki while pretending its her, daydreaming while being high and fantasizing about having sex with her during masturbation.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  The girl that made me feel thing I've never felt before.                 Hug, kiss, even more kissing.   I think she'd really enjoy just relaxing on the beach.   Trying to stay happy.   Wake up to her, think about her during the day, go to sleep looking at her and other things.             Fate a cute.    I'd like that as well.  Getting more pics. So many pages to go.  Her fig stands to the side of the monitor, always watching. That's as close as it can be, I think. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  Love in its purest, undistilled form. Not for the faint of heart.           Keep up a steady work rate. No real days off with internship and job but I'm working harder for her!   Kissing her daily.   I'm looking forward to it! Just where could we talk, though?          Thank you, she is.    No, not really. I don't think she's ever shown anything like that.   Yui Horie has a really cute and wonderful voice. I'd imagine she's pretty popular.   Severely creeped out and feel very odd at first, but if she's 100% girl now by whatever reasons, I don't think I'd have really much to say. If she's 100% the same as she is now even after, then it's just a short awkward while of strange.   Some cute doujins I'd imagine, robot fanworks,  Erotic Butler BL doujins perhaps    Anime, videogames, questing and work. A lot more things, too.   Severely doubt it.    1boy 1girl cum cum_on_body cum_on_breasts cum_on_clothes cum_on_hair cum_on_lower_body cum_on_upper_body cumdrip facial cum_in_mouth cum_in_pussy lingerie sex happy_sex missionary_position doggystyle cowgirl reverse_cowgirl thighhighs                       Super lewd all night    I'd give her some hugs and kisses, then I'd just sit down in the couch or chair and laze around for a while.   Not much, apart from trying to lose some weight, at least ease into something.   Daki.                               I love Ai so so much!    I don't know, but if she doesn't, teaching her how to use computers and maybe even program sounds really fun.   A quiet, but fierce determination when it comes to doing things, whether it be academic or recreational. I have to admit though, that she is better at actually getting started than I am.    She is pretty popular, but I don't really pay attention to her. I thought it was funny that she had to have a conversation with herself while working on Cross Ange on more than one occasion.    Money is no object  Space. I'd love to see the stars with her, but up close, which is something I could only manage if I had near unlimited resources. That or Cancun.   Help her improve her swim times, learn something together such as a dance, language or other skill. I'd like to do some unorthodox things that might be fun too like urban exploration. Really, I'd love to do quite a few things with her.    This sums it up quite nicely: http://pastebin.com/Z5v70Z19l    I'd hug her from behind and stay like that for a while, then I'd kiss her and tell her I love her.    I don't do it intentionally like "Oh I need to think about Ai today", but every so often I'll get this really bubbly feeling of being in love and do something as an outlet for that: drawing, writing, listen to romantic songs, some of them sad, and they remind me of her.  Especially the songs it's something I find myself doing a lot lately. Man, if I close my eyes and lip sync while pretending I'm singing to her, I feel like my chest is going to burst from emotion and I feel like crying    OHHH MYY LOVEEEE, MY DARLIIING                                 this pastebin has been deleted  Fuck you too Pastebin. Good thing I saved it. Giving it another shot:  http://pastebin.com/CamHEYG7      Yeah, good thing you saved it.    We don't share many traits but we're a good match and complement each other.   He does. Judging by some official pictures, a lot of plush animals, cute pajamas and sweets are involved. I'm sure they have a lot of fun together.   I want to kiss Makoto on the nape.   He looks like a perfect mix of his parents.   Pets, tickets for amusement parks/zoos/aquariums and my love.   I'd honestly let Makoto decide. I trust him to be reasonable enough and he loves children so I want him to be happy.   Not only the chest but his whole body actually. Makoto popped a shirt button off his shirt because he's so well endowed and got really embarrassed about it, it was so adorable.   His VA does an incredible job with Makoto's sweet, gentle and warm voice, I love it. I think his VA is semi popular but I'm not that knowledgeable about seiyuu.   I wouldn't care. I love Makoto the way he is now.   Makoto wouldn't read lewd stuff so light-hearted non-H works only if anything.   Travel to various places around the world.   We'd pet cats, play vidya, cuddle and eat sweets together.   No, Makoto is purer than fresh snow.  I'll teach him though.    Let him sit on my face and please him orally in various places.   Hug and a kiss on the foreahead, cheek and mouth in this order while caressing his back.   Makoto would love beautiful landscapes and impressive places so I'd do a tour around the world with him.   Look at pictures, imagine various scenarios to please him and hug my Makoto pillow. Post a picture of your waifu when she was young.                                                     Pretty competent with machines. Her phone above all things is pretty advanced considering it's a phablet and bluetooth at the same time.  You can say she fixed my heart, if that counts.  Even if it upsets people on a personal level, we will do what is right.  Doesn't care.  Satomi isn't that popular. That said, she was definitely a contributor in getting me to really notice what I had been missing in my life. She truly brought Kuroko to life in the adaptations, and I respect her greatly.  I would not be surprised.  Lewd thinking is pretty natural when it's for the one you love. Thanks, brain.  The merch search is never over.   how  Exactly what you said, and daki in the morning, or when I go to sleep.                     She's pretty well inclined. She never had one of her own, due to growing up in an orphanage, but she's interested. She hasn't repaired anything for me, no.  Several things, actually. We're both shy, have problems with self esteem and self worth, and both have a stutter. My problems aren't nearly as bad as hers.  She spends a lot of time with her friend Lilly, but no mention of a sleepover.  We don't see her parents, seeing as how they died when she was young.  Something small and heartfelt. She never liked her birthday much, but I'd use the day to tell her how much she really means to me and how much I love her.  A little while. I don't think we would rush into it, but we wouldn't wait too long.  No, she's much more self-conscious about other things.  She doesn't have one.  If she isn't anymore, I don't see the problem. I fell in love with her as she is now, and I wouldn't stop loving her.  Unknown. She loves reading books, though.  Somewhere quiet and peaceful. I think a trip into nature somewhere would be lovely.  Watch movies, play vidya, cuddle.  Give her a big hug and kiss, and tell her how much I missed her.  Someplace where your troubles could just melt away, and you could be on your own.  I think about her every day, and always keep her close to my heart.                                Wasn't there an IRC or a Steam group? I'm unsure.    We can make an IRC channel for just us if you wanna talk one-on-one.    Does your waifu have a blood sister?  Can she defeat gojira?      They never died: they just faded away.     How technologically inclined is your waifu?   Not much.  Does she need help using computers?  Maybe a little but she is the type who can learn fast.   Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   No way.  Yes, we share similar traits in personality, other than that not much.  Yes, in an ideal world she does. They play games like old maid, watch TV, eat snacks, tea and keki, talk about their lives, have pillow fights, etc.  I wish I knew, I soppused it's the same as Yuno. Her warmt comes from her parents.  To be happy.   wait until you get financially stable and had house  Pretty much that.  Yes, she knows she's perfect and I love her.  I don't really care much about her. But she's pretty popular.  Panic!  Something happy and cute, like Life of Maid.  Italy, go everywhere. I want to go there and I'm pretty sure she would also love it.  I would do my hobbies together with her and we'd travel a lot.   Fendom, all the way.    Hello, honey. How was your day?  Kiss, hug and massage. Easy.  Italy. Ari ari---  Bought figures of her.  Merch.                                           Miku would be the closest thing to one, though the fanbase feels that they are closer than blood sisters.   And suddenly I remember a song from the second Project Diva game where your chosen character can grow kaiju size and fight a Gojira expy. She could probably handle the King of the Monsters quite fine, though I doubt her chances against the likes of Destroyah.       There's still an IRC channel.     She'll do better than jet jaguar. How would she handle Orga?      A bit bulky, but nothing to worry about; especially if she has momentum on her side. Should be interesting to see her take on Biollante, though; I mean, all those vines...       i posted it in the spook zone for you two live bards    theres  a few            She lives in a medieval fantasy world, so she doesn't know anything about modern technology  she used to have problems i also used to have and both of us have a bad temperament  nope  yes, her sister also has pink hair, and they mention that maybe she is going to look more like her sister when she grows up  i really don't know what would be a good gift,she can have everything she wants because she is from a noble family,maybe i would invite her to a very special place on a date    she is 16 and im 18 having a child wouldn't be a good idea right now i think we would wait a few years , at least until she is 21   yes  i don't know how popular rie is but i like her  if the money isn't a problem i would take her to a private island where we could have fun together  i would love to travel alnd explore the world with her, also watching movies and cuddling would be nice  giving her a huge hug every day and a kiss  somewhere were we could be toghether without having to deal with anyone else, just a nice place for the 2 of us                           Bulky in all the right places, am I right?     She can use pretty much anything than the average japanese girl can use.  We both are responsible and mature.  She had some sleepovers with her friends.  Not possible to know.  Sweets and musical stuff.  Wait untill she's prepared for children.  She knows what she has.  I do like her a lot and she's popular enough to remember her name.  No.  A different city where I have family. We can live in their house and only spend the necessary money.  The usual I guess, hug and kiss. I'm not very imaginative for these things.  A trip around Europe or a second trip to Britain I guess. Maybe going to a big music festival.  Not much, I like to rewatch especific scenes from her series.  Daydreaming and listening to her songs.                              Thanks mister.   We can go to that one.   But it will have to wait a bit, I must go out. Will be back in 3 hours or so.          Amen to that.     She doesn't really use technology a lot. She's not really mechanical either.   Aside from introversion and  deep love , not too much now that I think about it.   Aside from sharing the occasional hotel room, no.   She resembles her mother a lot, especially with the eyes. They share some personality traits too, but her mother is far more imposing and generally kind of intimidating.   I buy her flowers every year.   Having children is important to her, and while deep down I love the idea, I'm also terrified by it. I'm so scared of being a bad father, not being able to handle the responsibility and not being able to provide to my family. I think it's one of my deepest fears.   She's confident in them and likes them as they are.   Kugimiya Rie does a lot of tsundere roles. I like her voice (especially character songs), but I typically don't like the characters she's associated with.   That's no longer here and now.   No, but she'd probably like  vanilla .   A winter vacation to the Swiss countryside.   Just spending quiet time together in a secluded place, a special place for only us.   I just want to make her happy...  Maybe kiss her shoulders or tummy...    I walk home from work, so I'm usually quite sweaty and gross when I get home. I'd greet my darling, but I'd have to shower before I could give her a hug proper.   I bought the last volume of her manga.   :&lt;    I keep her keychain on my backpack, listen to her character albums,  hold her figure's hand  before I go to bed, and sleep with a homemade plushie of her.                                                  Yeah, a ton. The most obvious thing is that we both play the drums.   Sometimes. Pretty normal stuff.   I think she does resemble her brother, but I'm not sure if she really does or if it's just because of the art style and confirmation bias.   Very long. We'd both want to pursue our musical careers for the time being, and having to compromise between that and spending time with your children isn't the best thing ever.   Somewhat, but it doesn't seem to be a major problem for her.   Yes, no idea how popular she is.   I'd let her choose if she really wanted to go somewhere. I don't really like traveling all that much myself.   Play board games, play vidya, play music, drink tea, watch anime.   She's not very experienced.   Depends on the day, obviously I wouldn't want to do the same thing over and over again.                              I love my  scary  light cruiser!   The one-on-one or the one mentioned in ghost?   Do you have any merch of you're waifu? If there isn't any, what kind of stuff would you like?   I thanked her. Pic related.   I think I just feel very close to her pretty much automatically.   I have a bootleg daki. I'd like to have tons of stuff, but I'm not actually planning on buying anything for the time being.          I doubt my husbando has even one tech-savvy bone in his body. That's okay though, I'm always willing to help.    A lot, (un)surprisingly. We both have trust issues. Social anxiety. A perception of not being worth other people's time. So on and so forth. The biggest difference there is that he's affected by these things much more than I am.   Nope. Probably just watch movies, chit-chat? I don't think he'd care for the typical teenage girly-girl sleepover stuff.    I want to kiss my husbando's wrists.   There's no mistaking him for his mother, but they aren't completely dissimilar either.    A cake and some new clothes. And something sweet and sentimental, of course. Like a custom-framed photo of us together, that'd be nice.    A birthday party! Something tells me that he's never been thrown one, which makes me very sad.  Sadly, I could most likely say the same for Crona. But hey, a first-ever birthday party is a good gift in and of itself.    Only about how skinny he is. An understandable concern, even if I think he's just fine already.   Maaya is pretty good, and she's got a sizable list of roles too.    "Kay, cool. Now where were we?" Let me go ahead and re-state once again that I don't see his ambiguous gender as an issue. If he was something other than what he is now, that's fine too.   Ha, no. But the thought of him getting curious and consulting Google one day, only to get extremely flustered at the results, is rather cute.                                   I have her figure  which I got at 300% its original price.  It's a good figure but I wish it was less popular.       She doesn't have any. I'd just like a figure, honestly.   I just realized this picture would've been perfect for my last post. Technological inclination, and all. Hindsight is always 20/20, right?   Anything! As long as we're enjoying each other's company, it'll do. But if I have to choose, cuddling on the couch and watching tv sounds most appealing at the moment.    The answer depends on whether or not  he's ever touched himself  ;^)    Holding hands  and  locking eyes  and  kissing  while  making sweet, tender, love.   Also, seconding the anon who mentioned omo. God, I have so many fantasies related to that. I'm so gross ;_;    I'd give him a big hug, a peck on the cheek, and ask him how his day's been. /My/ day doesn't matter too much when I can come home to his smiling, lightly blushing face!   I don't think he's the vacationing type, though admittedly that may just be me projecting a little. But if anything, he'd like somewhere quiet and lesser-populated.   I've been trying to get back into drawing him, if it counts. Writing a bit too. Just the usual stuff, I guess.   Looking at pictures and rewatching his scenes, mostly. Sometimes I get random cutesy ideas in my head, and they give me that nice feeling of closeness too.   Just the  cards . I'd really like something more substantial, more tangible. A prize fig, keychain strap, anything.                           Nothing special these days, planning a fourth rewatch of her series.   Listening to her songs, watching pictures of her, constant daydreaming, posting in these threads...   Still alive, Spaniard ?   I don't have any merch of her yet. I know that love isn't measured by the amount of stuff you have, but I still feel bad for owning nothing.             My waifu is the sexiest.   My waifu is the prettiest!    The only thing I have right now is a little nendo petit. I would love a larger figure whether it's a full nendo or something with more realistic proportions, but I'm also hoping for little trinkets like keychains. Other girls in her series have gotten them, so I'm hoping it's only a matter of time.    Not really, at least nothing conscious. Most of these things come naturally.   While there's quite a bit, a large percentage of that is cheap stuff like clear files, stickers and such, which aren't really worth getting in my eyes. As for the rest, it's safe to say that I own most of the quality stuff there is.  Although I'd love to see a proper non-prize scale figurine, or at least one where my Yunocchi isn't in a swimsuit or her school uniform.    Nothing out of the ordinary. Just normal couple stuffs.   My waifu is the cutest!              I want my waifu to pole dance and strip for me.   Something I forgot to mention in my last post, I did a colour edit of some art I have of her. Looks a lot more accurate than the original.   Two scale figures, three plushies, four mini figures and a poster.  Also two keychains and another mini figure on the way as I speak.   Would you're waifu rather do a dangerous job for a lot of money, or a very safe job for little pay?          three plushies  Massively jelly.      Still alive, Spaniard ?  More or less     They are pretty darn adorable.    A couple of figures, two posters. Mousepad and a mousemat. Still a ton of merchandise I'm looking to acquire, though.    I think she's fairly competent when it comes to technology. I guess her field would be Ratings Games if I had to pick one out specifically, and she isn't at the forefront of that unfortunately. Maybe in the future though.  Has your waifu repaired anything for you?   My heart.    An interest in reading and the supernatural is something we both share.   When she was younger I think she used to sleep together with her best friend. Not sure what they did together though.   Incredibly so. She gets the majority of her looks from her mother but with her father's crimson hair. She and her mother look so alike they could be mistaken for sisters.   Financially stable at the very least. It's difficult for Devils to conceive so unless we were incredibly lucky on the first try it'd take a while for it to happen no matter what.   Nope. She's perfectly happy with the body she has and is proud of it.   Yoko Hikasa is very talented and I'd say pretty popular. I like her, she does good work.   If she read any I think they'd be non-H comedy stuff of series she liked. She's not really the type to read doujins though.   If money was of no concern, traveling the entire world and experiencing all the sights and things each place has to offer.   It's a bit private but  planning out our anniversary, which is tomorrow. Mostly involving baked goods, roses, and just being as close to her as I possibly can. I wish I could do more.                                  Can do.  His dress/robe from back then reminds me of a flower of some sort. Can't put my finger on which one though.    He did a dangerous 'job' for what I imagine was a very pitiful allowance. That 'job', of course, was his life under Medusa (not to mention other hazardous situations he's found himself in  for free ), but I digress. All things considered, I'm almost inclined to say either is equally likely.       I wish my waifu had a plushie.    A small collection. Two plushes, a nendoroid, a couple of keychains, two games, and an artbook. Always eager to add more.  Definitely the latter. Not to say that she isn't capable of handling the former.      To think I did most of this damage before even considering going to Japan is still cool to me, and I have stuff on the way, too.  http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/BDKBMW</wbr>   Why this has never come up in my mind is beyond me.  I would imagine dangerous for money, as Judgments field work has proven to be more dangerous than Antiskills.   second spoiler   Happy early anniversary!            She doesn't have much in the way of merchandise; I guess by thinking of her and looking at pictures of her.  I have a phone strap of her. It's the only merchandise of her in existence. I wish that she had a figurine.  Depends on the nature of the job I suppose. She's willing to put her life on the line for a good cause (e.g. protecting others), so she would be willing to do a dangerous job if it helped others.        Yes, pic related. Also I have Project Diva f 2nd and I've preorded http://www.goodsmile.info/en/produc<wbr>t/4878/Hatsune+Miku+V3.html   Safe job. She rather wouldn't like to risk to much.   You can commission one or just make it yourself. I think I've seen some waifufag who had commissioned plushie.      </wbr>    W-What happened ?    All these people with all this cool merch  Damn I'm so jealous    I'd get a lot of stuff if it was available Figures, posters, stickers   She wouldn't care about the pay, she'd do something she likes, although i doubt a Kirijo job is badly paid         Hey, friend. Orihime a cute.  Thanks, Rukia a cute too.     I have her figure, and I have the Mk2 daki, and two of the anime one(peach skin and 2way tricot). I've commissioned a daki, though I want other merch of her. I think there's an extremely rare garage kit, some small figure, a 1:1 scale doll I think(custom), and a JP LE nendoroid that's rare too.    I have two figures, a PVC keychain, both of her character albums, both of her  oppai  mousepads, a wallscroll, and the aforementioned homemade plush, as well as her games, manga localizations and series on DVD.   She'd probably do the safe job if she wasn't terribly motivated.       Sneak up behind her while she's distracted and surprise her before giving her a hug and kiss.   A bit of all three, but hugging her daki close and squeezing it tight feels so nice and right.   She was a cute kid.   A daki, the one well-made (in my opinion) figure she has, and a pre-ordered 3D cushion. I'd love to buy more merch of her but every other figure has left me disappointed. Considering getting a second daki of her in the meantime, after buying her mouse pad.   Would depend on who she's working for. I think she'd prefer a safe job with smaller pay over something too dangerous.   Thanks, Kurokobro! I hope your anniversary, whenever it is this year (or next, if its already passed) is wonderful.                   almost forgot all about the thread today  Jesus.  She spends a lot of time on her computer, whether it's playing eroge, chatting with her friends online, or just browsing the web in general. She doesn't need any help using it, as far as I know.  Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?   She repaired my hateful heart!   We're both into mahou shoujo anime and cute things in general.  We also both have natural, medium-brown hair that's dyed to a lighter color.  She's never shown having a sleepover with her friends, but they're almost a necessity for a teenage girl with friends. With her main friend group, she'd probably do normal teenage girl things like reading magazines, watching movies, and styling each other's hair. A sleepover with her otaku friends would probably be a lot of video games and anime discussion.  I'd say something Meruru related but she has nearly all the merchandise for it. I'd probably get her something really nice that she'd enjoy like some jewelry, or just new clothing in general.  Mmm, a few years. We would have to adopt a child, which as far as I know, takes a lot of planning and whatnot. It's not exactly something we could just leap right into, and I'd also want both of us to be a bit older before we got a child.  She has a small, but not flat bust. She seems to be pretty content with it.  I love Ayachi and her voicework, I think her voice suits Kirino perfectly. She's fairly popular and has a good amount of roles   She reads Meruru doujinshi and some other imouto themed stuff. The ones I know she reads are H-doujins, but I'm sure she reads some non-h stories as well.  We'd hit the town together! I'd love to go out shopping with her, and try on clothing together while giving each other fashion advice. After that, we could stop at a cafe and enjoy coffee and sweets together.                             Who needs help using computers these days ? Unless your waifu is a granny of course. Not that there's anything wrong with that.    Anywhere in the Demon realm or someplace in Kyoto   Yes I do I have a poster, figure, The psvita game that I still need to download, artbook, oppai mousepad and 2 dakis   She has done dangerous jobs before so I guess she would continue   Hey look its Rias             My waifu is older than your granny's granny's granny.    My waifu is never shown using a computer, and I sort of think she'd have trouble with it. She's more hands on.   Does you're waifu poop, anons?   Somewhere tropical, but it cannot be too loud or noisy either. With enough money maybe we could go to one of those really beautiful island resorts in the middle of the pacific. Somewhere the two of us can enjoy the beauty of water and nature in peace.   Not a lot, because it's mostly sold out, but I'm glad I've been able to get what little I have.   I can't imagine Ai doing really dangerous stuff. She favors stability in her life.           Share a Coke with Anon   Share a Coke with Ai   CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE       That's cute as fuck, Aibro.      Hnnngggggg     Thanks guys. Took me an hour in line to get those.      Don't know how I missed this question. Whoops.  I like to think she's stayed over at one of her friends' houses a few times, most likely Chiyo's, but it's never shown canonically. She did have that trip to Chiyo's summer home with her friends if that counts.   There are waifus whose series is set before computers were invented. Would be kinda cute to see waifus struggling to even turn a computer on.        Very safe one for a little pay.   I was just talking about how much stress I have had lately. Let's just stop talking about things not related to the thread.      I love my lovely lady.  She's my everything.      Getting stepped on by my lovely Kiririn! while she teases me for enjoying it so much!   Hug and a kiss and then ask her if she wanted me to make her tea or an iced coffee or something while I work on dinner.  I can't say I'm all that great with place names, but I imagine she'd like going somewhere with loads of shops filled with fashionable clothing.   Just my usual browsing for new fanart of her, and I pre-ordered a figure that'll be coming out in a couple months.  Waking up every morning to an alarm of her voice, daydreaming and staring at my figures of her, listening to her character songs and rewatching my favorite episodes of the anime.  I have a pretty good amount of merch, although there's still things I want to buy. I'd love to get my hands on her azone (the tsuntsun face one, which is a bit harder to find,) and make a custom dollfie of her. My dream figure of her hugging her daki seems to be being made, although I'm not sure if it's been cancelled or not, seeing as how a year or so has gone by without any information on it.  Safe job. She likes having money to spend on her hobbies, but I can't see her taking on a job that could possibly be life-threatening.  Tell me about your waifu's life as a child. Did they have a nice, enjoyable childhood?What were they like as a kid? Has their personality changed a lot over the years?                      Za warldo tokio tomare    Well thank you, it always is, though January is quite far in both directions.  Jelly of these cans. Very cool, still.     She can use technology whenever she has use for it.   I own many figures of her and there are some in the way and preordered.  Good question, I can't answer it.     Even when times aren't great, I'll continue trying to better know myself and become a better version of myself. Thank you for giving me that strength.  I love you more than anything.    I love my sweet miko so much! I want to marry her!  All your waifus are cute, me and Reimu both wish you all much love and happy lives!   She does a dangerous job... for little pay.        Eating out and strolls through the park are obvious ones. Maybe cooking together and eating the meal at the end, that's a lot of fun.   She's a Japanese high schooler so probably every once in a while but I wouldn't know for sure.   Her childhood was tragic. Abusive parents that she was rescued from by her brother only to have him die and become a Hollow.  If you went to the movies this weekend with your waifu what movie would you watch? I'd probably watch Jurassic World            Universal Pictures please go.    Her parents weren't good with her, they were strict and they didn't even report when she was missing for 10 days straight I can't imagine how hard her childhood was     You're waifu a best!  Me too, but I Nagisa were with us, we would watch Inside Out.       Does your waifu resemble her parents or other relatives?  Only when she's angry and heck I'm late. I still want to ruffle her hair.   What would you give your waifu for her birthday?  Lemon flavored cake.   How long would you wait to have children with your waifu? Would you do it right now, wait until you get financially stable and had house or maybe wait for both of you reach particular age?  Marriage and financially stable.   Nope.             not liking Jurassic World      small local theatre which only shows 3 things   jurassic world   some generic kids shit   the new ted movie   she'd probably want to see jurassic world based on the poster but I know the ted 2 is going to be funnier  I'm not sure she'd get most of the jokes though so I guess dinosaurs it is   ...yes there is a scene that involves that  and she's probably the only one in this thread who is confirmed for it which is the only reason I'm answering that.                Nothing's really known about her home life at all, sadly. It seems as though she's happy with her parents and her life in general leading up to when she meets up with the rest of the AzuDai characters.   I could see her picking either Jurassic World or Mad Max, I'd be happy seeing either with her.        Funny thing. I did just that this past weekend. Saw  Jaws       Definitely seems to have had a nice childhood with parents who encouraged her love of literature quite a lot.    We'd probably find an independent cinema and watch something foreign or artistic    That describes Yomiko's job perfectly, it pays incredibly well and she gets to travel a lot, along with access to rare and lost books which she enjoys a lot but the job itself is dangerous. Though if she enjoys it a lot I wouldn't want to discourage her from the thing she loves.  Is your waifu well traveled? One of the perks of Yomiko's job is that she gets to go all over the world which is a very cool thing.               She'd rather do an easy one, which probably falls under 'safe'. I suppose it depends how little 'very little' is.    Well I've already seen Jurassic World and Inside Out, and I preferred the latter. She'd probably find it more enjoyable too.      How smart is your waifu?   I feel like that's a scene I should remember, but I'm drawing a complete blank.    That picture is insulting to your "waifu", yet you post it. You think you're funny you cocksucker?    I wasn't thinking. I've been helping my dad out since five in the morning and I just got back home.    Some waifus are just dumb.     being surprised about Kill la Kids posting meme images     first episode, angels who lose their halos suffer consequences and it comes up twice for poor sabato    She'd probably like Jurasic world just for the technology they display   She hasn't traveled much beyond a few trips like Yakushima and Kyoto   She's an honor student and gets high grades, she's smart and pretty, and pretty smart          It would be weird if she didn't, wouldn't it?   No idea, but I imagine she had just normal childhood.   Jurassic World sounds like safe choice.   Probably not. But I would love to travel with her to various places all over the world.   She isn't genius but she isn't stupid too.                She seems to travel around a bit, at least judging by some of the concerts that have happened.    This weekend, probably Mad Max. Unless I can find something classic to top Jaws.    Fuck Pies  I chuckled a bit.  She's pretty average. Not a genius, but not dumb either. She is a very clever girl, though.             pic related    I love Satomi in Knights of Sidonia.   True, but the reason I was bothered by it is because I don't want to see her as "le cute fuckable anime girl". I also don't want to forget what drawn me to her to begin with. That said, thanks for the reminder, I don't want to end up like one of those chucklefucks who groan about 'muh purity' where it doesn't even matter.   I don't, because there are only 3 keychains and I wasn't so...into her back when they were released. I should probably grab one of her keychains.  I would want a figure/wallscroll, but they are never happening unless they force her into the hypothetical Railgun S3, the likes of which would need so much bullshittery that it would deplete the ADB's and Diet's strategic reserves.    I-it's not gross Who am I kidding, it is     dangerous for money, not because of the money but because she enjoys the challenge. However, she'd want it to be an ethical one.    I would imagine dangerous for money, as Judgments field work has proven to be more dangerous than Antiskills.  Times like this, I'm glad that Shinobu got out of the city.   me too, Makofriend   Jesus, is there a machine where you can custom make those Coke cans? Good shit, was thinking of getting a notebook or something done but I'd never use it.   Presumably. She's human enough.   All that is known was that she was working in research institutions from a very young age, basically 10 - 12 years old if you work back the time based from the anime.   She was always surrounded by older folk and had little contact with people her age, and I'd wager that would be why she had little friends and believed in depending only on herself.  Now she has friends and me, and I hope she is much happier.                                        Very bad child hood her   mom died  Her dad had duties as a   fallen angel   to deal with so no daddy time. She was very different as a child than she is today.   She would either like Jurassic world or Inside out   She is not. She has only been to the Demon world and Kyoto   She is really smart doing things that her best friend wouldn't have thought of doing and even in school she has high grades             Feito a cute.    Safe job. She would much rather prefer peace of mind.  Her childhood was.. not nice. When she was 8 her house burned down, which killed her family and permanently disfigured her. She was ruthlessly bullied at school which caused her to develop extreme anxiety and self esteem issues, and she was one of the few kids at the orphanage not to be adopted, as she saw all the other kids get new families.   Mad Max. That movie's great.  No. Growing up in an orphanage without a family didn't give her a lot of opportunities.  She's pretty smart. She's very well read.            No more well travelled than the average Japanese person her age.  I daresay she's not, considering how she described seeing the world as a "dark, twisted thing" early on she probably wasn't one for that. She's changed though, damn it, I'll hate following her around.   She's a scientist, not amazing tier but damn smart considering her age.  I hope you stick things through with Mako, god knows she deserves it.  Does your waifu have an alternate costume/appearance? Shinobu does.             She hasn't travelled much outside of Japan, although she's been to Okinawa on a school trip.   She's a bit of a Blockhead.   She has a dozen or so outfits, pic related being my favourite.          Her childhood was pretty good, but somewhat sad at the same time. She was too commonly only seen as Rias Gremory, the next in line to be head of the Gremory family and not just Rias, the person.   You're waifu a cute too, Reimubro. I wish you both the best.   Theaters around here are the worst, overpriced, stuffy, and the food's not great. We'd stay at home and download whatever's showing while cuddling up together on the couch. No idea what we'd watch though, nothing that's out now really interests me too much. I'd leave it up to her.  Maybe Jurassic World because dinosaurs are cool.    Other than Japan she's visited a few places in Europe, though the source material wasn't very descriptive as to where exactly in Europe.   Hello, Akenobro.   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127106709#p127132639">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    She was a kind, sweet little girl who had a childhood crush on a human boy. When she confessed to him that she was a yuki onna, he thought she would eat him and ran away. This deeply saddened her and influenced her into become reclusive and miserable.   She mostly sticks to Japan, though she's also traveled to China. It was her first time on a plane.   She doesn't bother attending class much and is generally horrible with math. She's much better at real world sense and attuning herself to people's emotions and feelings.   She has a few.              I hope you stick things through with Mako, god knows she deserves it.   Does your waifu have an alternate costume/appearance? Shinobu does.   Mako  But she isn't my waifu. I posted that picture because my back and skull has been hurting since at least nine and I can't think straight at them moment. Getting better though.   Does your waifu have an alternate costume/appearance?  Yes she does. I like her with less revealing clothes on though.        I'm going to bed now but do you and waifu have any routine before you hit the sack, it could be talking or other stuff, etc. For Yomiko we usually talk about what's going to happen the next day, our plans for the week, then I  usually read her poetry or Shakespeare sonnets  before giving Yomiko her goodnight kiss, then it's lights out.    Mako  I meant Ryuuko, I'm a mongoloid.    What does this mean?  It means 存在の耐えられない軽さ   A pleasure of being cummed inside.    dVlU   That Haru is the only one who isn't a leg spreading slut.   It means you need to kill yourself.   It means  stop making Free threads, faggot.    Nagisa a slut, Rei and Makoto fags who can't into sex, Haru a prude, Rin a pure that doesn't wanna get involved in lewd activites.      Rin a pure     His body is slutty but his personnality is that of a virginal angel.    That doesn't make sense.   I didn't watch the series, so can you tell me if we should expect the Free! movie to be another kyoanus masterpiece like disappearance and tamako love story? Or is the source material shit?   Think harder, and you'll realize it adds up actually.      his personnality is that of a virginal angel.     Hey, now. Rei spreads majestically.     Or is the source material shit?  Here's your answer.     Is that supposed to be him in high school? He looks a lot younger    It'll probably be shit.   What does this mean?   The source material is alright, will be made better by KyoAni is they continue their tradition of making better movies than series.    Yeah but then he falls over    Dr Freud.jpg    Freud.jpg      A masterpiece.    Are you implying there's something odd about taste-testing?   Haru-chan is my waifu!   Not at all.    I want to taste-test you butt   makoto my husbando     I don't get what you mean. Could you explain more clearly?     SOUHARU IS CANON   It means that I'm surprised and disappointed there are no SouRin daddy roleplay doujins.    Just cute little boys whose smiles need to be protected.    One God and one autist.    SouHaruNagi is canon    Haru-chan is my Goddess.    Why is Haru's art so much worse?    http://strawpoll.me/4727984    Rin wants to fuck his dad who also happens to be Sousuke who's in fact a reincarnation of his late dad which explains why Rin was so drawn to Souuke to begin with so it's technically incest but not really.    I want to know too.    Fujos can't into good taste.    homolust: the animation https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9UZ<wbr>hAC7IuYE</wbr>  [ ]     I don't see what the difference is     it's technically incest  SouRin confirmed best pairing yet again.     Haru looks like shit and his right eye's fucked up, Sousuke a manly.   I want to lick Haru's tits   That's some study case for Dr Freud.     Being blind     Haru looks like a beautiful girl, shut the fuck up.    they clearly don't know how to do YMCA    No bullying    Haru a shit, Sousuke a gorgeous.   It means that you faggots will actually stop posting shit on the archives, using ghost as your general.   That's because Rin didn't join them.    b-but anon th-they are both boys    Harufag confirmed for cancerous fun-ruining proxyfag.      I can't recall ever even reading a daddy roleplay doujin, whatever the fandom.    Waifufag please, you don't own the archives.    That's okay, because Haru is a girl.    A problem with that, faggot?   What's your favorite Free! doujin?    women who are drawn to husbands like their fathers   acknowledged her future husband by doing the same thing she did with her daddy.      Every RinHaru doujin.    It doesn't look pleasing visually and Sousuke deserves better than an autist. He deserves to win his waifubowl.    Will Sousuke make a proper woman out of Haru?    Freud would be touched.    You just have a shit taste, that's okay.    3deep5me    How deep does the fist goes?    You just have all the shit taste and that's not okay.    As deep as Rin can take it.    That is so disturbing but also kind of hot.    Nice quints.    Haru is a good and pure christian wife already, she's a good woman.   Why so many people like Sousuke again? We hated him.    We hated him   we   Only you.        <br/>   Because the only people left in these threads are 10 SouRinfags and one Harufag.   OTP T P      we  Who is this "we" you speak of?     As deep as their relationship.     we   Speak for your own shit taste, cunt.

Poor Sousuke can't catch a break.    I don't normally like Sousuke but if it's delicious brown I guess it's okay    He just wants to cuddle with his husbando.   RIN A SHIT A FUCKING UGLY SHIIIIIT    Erwong a balding blonde shit.    Now that's not nice, what would Jesus think?    To think both Sousuke and SouRin would have been about a dozen time twice as delicious had Kyoani given him a darker tan. Suffering.     Harufag in charge of not sperging     All the Sousuke are gorgeous and perfection.    Jesus wouldn't want you to have such hateful thoughts.    Jesus thinks you're a faggot.    Too bad he's shit     never    Will Rei be in the movie? How would they do that?   Jesus loves everyone and you must learn to love everyone too.    They already look perfect together, you brownfag.    There won't be a movie.    Based Proxy-chan.     ITT 500 SouHarufags      Harufag tries to circlejerk   no other Harufags around to circlejerk with him   becomes asspained and shits on Rin/SouRin instead  Every thread.       There's cuddling and then there's being plain clingy so the person will eventually give in and bend you over the nearest flat surface to give you the pounding you've been yearning for. Rin's always the latter.    I'm here, I just don't want to circlejerk.    Maybe he shouldn't have sperged on the other Harufags.    I agree, but there was potential for them to look even greater.    I just love my waifu and I pray to the Lord to forgive your shit taste.   Rin &gt;&gt;&gt; Haru   But my favorite Free is a devout Christian and the Lord loves him, didn't you read that totally legitimate article?   Haru is a beautiful arabian woman.

Probably do some "almost met before" scene.    fuck off already with your meta shit.     quads  It's over, Free is finished.     That's just for 2 minutes before even more pounding though.

She's got everything going for her   Nitori a god   Not everything ;_; but she always looks beautiful.    Rinrin pls, go back to looking after the children.    It's okay, I'm sure true love will prevail and she'll be able to reunite with her husbando soon.      Even though she looks so beautiful when she's sad I still want her happiness more.    Rin's closed-eyes smile is very precious, so I only allowed it at specific moments   nyaaaaa   True, her overall features really do soften when she's in a moodier mood. I almost feel bad for digging it so much.    He sure is happy about getting spoonfed by Sousuke.    Fun gay group sex.    d v l u    Her worried and wary expression looks so nice on her that I almost wish more shit to happen.    How happy is he here?   I really can't wait for his birthday art to come out.   Rei: looks like he knows what he's doing but messes up at the end Nagisa: very eager and energetic; inviting gestures Haruka: great body control and technique, thus little reaction Makoto: uncertain and clumsy but tries his best not to make mistakes  It's basically a metaphorical portrayal of the Frees in bed. KyoAni a lewd.         Same. I want him to bend me over and pound me with his huge thick cock.    I miss these edits   Sourin is love, Sourin is life. Sourin is Sousuke big dick in Rinrin's tiny boypussy. Sourin is a wedding on a Strayan beach. Sourin is everything that is good and beautiful in the world.       Pic  Add some arm hair and a happy trail and it's perfect.     Just some quick and dirty ones, glad you like them.    Hey Freegots, My name is Sousuke, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, unmotivated no-lifes who spend every second of their day dog-paddling in kiddie pools. You are everything bad in the swimming world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten first place? I mean, I guess it's fun filling pools with gay-ass petals, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to waterfalls. Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best time. I'm pretty much perfect. I was fastest in my old swimming club, and one of the top ten butterfly swimmers in the country. What sports do you play, other than "jack off to Haru's swimming"? I've also been scouted, and have a banging hot boyfriend (he doesn't know he's mine yet; shit is SO cash). You are all faggots who should just drown themselves. Thanks for listening. Pic Related: It's me and my bitch.       Stop posting that one, it's shit now.     I've also been scouted    I wish the Frees were actual girls.   She really does look absolutely luscious. It's no wonder Sousuke can't stand th sight of her sad face, he'd have to walk around with a boner 24/7.    I don't.    But Rinrin is already a girl, anon.    Body's top notch but a haircut of similar lenght to the one she has in the show would have fit better I think.    So Rinrin's tears actually make Sousuke's cock hard? He's one of us then?    Would female Rin be a tomboy or a girly girl?    I don't think I would be able to control myself if that face was in front of me.    A girly tomboy.     Kek.     Would you bury your head in that firm but plump ass?    I would do more than that.     not burying your dick in it instead      He's one of us then?  Basically, expect that he gets to act on his urges and lick/kiss the tears off when he's fervently plowing Rinrin into the mattress and tears of pleasure start streaming down her pretty face.     I just want to knead it so damn bad.    Ah, so this is the contest. I was wondering how they determined it.    ULVЬ, if you look from Sharky's point of view.    Why not both?    Don't remind me, now that these 2 are finally reunited in Straya, Rinrin gets her pussy plowed every night and Sousuke transformed into abuser-kun.   I finally watched s2 (dropped it because I found it boring when it was airing), what a mixed bag. Started off good, middle was shit, ended good. I actually teared up at the last episode. All boys are still best boys    OP: If you noticed the words before the half-naked men, I have some bad news for you.      Sousuke transformed into abuser-kun.  The thought of Sousuke emotionally taunting and bullying Rinrin to breakdown sure doesn't sound half bad. Then once he deems Rinrin's had enough dicking for the day, he'd pull Rinrin into his comforting manly arms and whispers sweet nothings into her ear to reassure her on how beautiful and perfect she is.     Of course, he would only do that to see her beautiful tears, then he would comfort her with a tender dicking while whispering sweet words into her ear.     Sousuke emotionally taunting and bullying Rinrin to breakdown   Sounds hot but please, no more.      Aside from that kind of more extreme play they'd indulge in every other week, I'm sure they'd act as a typical couple on their honeymoon period, always joined at the hip, behaving all lovey-dovey and touchy-feely with lingering touches and no notion of personal spaces whatsoever.   You can't let terribly handled dramas ruin delicious kinks for you, anon.        You can't let terribly handled dramas ruin delicious kinks for you, anon.   I try but it's a confusing feeling.      gtfo Haru-chan is my waifu    This thread lacks Rei and Nagisa   Did you seriously just flip the d instead of typing b?    Maybe you'll feel a bit more at ease with Rinrin's tears once the movie gives them both a couple-y resolution.    Maybe, hopefully ;_;    Don't raise my hopes up, anon ;_; I prefer to believe it's over and Kyoanus are faggots then be surprised in a good way, than hope for something that never comes.  My biggest fear is a 5P movie in Straya and no Sousuke ;_;. I mean after the Sakura pool scene in ep 13 and everyone being happy while Sousuke looks like a poorfag at the ocean, I've kind of prepared myself. Still hurts though ;_;     Looks like we really need a seperate containment thread for our resident imagedumping, passive aggressive cancer every time a Free thread is up. What a shame.    No need to talk about yourself that way bro.       dat self loathing    Jesus loves you even if you don't      Freefags are so enlightened ;_;     My biggest fear is a 5P movie in Straya and no Sousuke  It wouldn't even surprise me if somehow 4P make a trip to Aussieland and as Rin greet them and ask where Sousuke's at they just reply he couldn't come because of reasons and leave it at that. That's just how highly I think of Kyoani.     How can we not be when Samezuka is such a loving example of a Christian family? Even Harufag finally found Jesus.    ;_; Same here but let's not jinx it. Honestly, I don't know how 5Pfags do. Personally, I can't erase an entire season of getting to know new characters, following them, their fears, their dreams, only to push them away at the last time, and go back to what you were doing 13 episodes before with just the original characters. That's not how it works, at least not for me.     This picture would be a very different scene if Rin wasn't obviously wearing pants.   Haikyuu &gt; Yowapeda &gt; Basugay &gt; shit &gt; Free    Rin wasn't obviously wearing pants   But it isn't Rin that's wear pants.      You can also pretend Sousuke's pants are pulled midway down his thighs and he's wrecking that boypussy like he's never tasted anything sweeter.   No S3 which means no S3 OST from the god Tatusya Kato.   Oh god why.        no S3  Who said that? Though another movie, after the shota prequel, is more likely.       That 1000000+Yen check  I hope he gets his waifu a nice 18 carats engagement ring with it.       A Furby in the face as soon as he wakes up  Someone seems to hate Sosuke.     Buyfag thread, read this before asking questions http://buyfag.moe  rerelease   Cupoche look disgusting. Like nebdoroids sister with downs.   tfw want to buy kancolle figs but people keep calling me a filthy secondary    Cupoche look disgusting  Opinions     Cupoche look all right. Like Nendoroids with joints.    What the hell kind of rifle is that?     Giving a shit about what others plebs could think about the shit you buy  Step up nigga     It's better than the usual opinion. He gave a valid criticism. He doesn't like the faces.   Most retards come in here and just blurt out random franchise hate, "kek SAO autist"       Cupoche are the pochaco of nendoroids. They look disgusting and they are not ok as op.      Cupoche look disgusting  You misstyped Nanorich, anon     I don't find her that nice for some reason   how the hell do you pronounce cupoche again?   It's the best Tenshi and it was baby's first love tragedy for college aged teens who are too young to realize it's nothing special.    kyu poesh-.    Their faces are ugly. There is something very off about them. Especially the mouth. And they all have the same copypasted open mouth in every character. I like that the got joints but I wish they would learn how to make cute faces. But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.      But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.  You are in luck, there is a Dark Magician Girl in the line     Sadly the only one. I meant more like yugi or any of the other "main characters", I would also give a lot for arc v characters. Or dark magician to go with dark magician girl.   Nippon-Yasan's asking for a picture of my credit card with my name on it, but I only used a debit card that doesn't have my name on it. Payment pushed through, however. Anyone else had this problem before?   I remember someone in this thread being asked for a picture of his passport.    Other characters from YuGi-OH woould be great TBH   How do you guys feel about this?   I like it   How is Pulchra?    Mouth and chin ruin it for me. Shame too, because I really, really like it otherwise.     The ahoge is stupid.    The other version is this. I find the first more appealing. I am thinking about it but the baby face looks off. I still think it looks great.    I actually like it a bit. Just the baby chin is getting to me and I'm not sure if that's enough to stop me.   Is she cast off? If I ever see this one on sale I might get her.   It looks good but I dont see the appeal of busts or other figures where part of the body is missing, like lower legs.    The welded tits are bothersome though. I don't think so though. Semen demon isn't either.    I don't have only figures so it isn't out of place for me. Also the sculptor put a lot of detail in and if he included the rest of it then it would be either, really expensive, or not that great.    APS Underwater Rifle, it shoots big darts.  Step up your obscure gun knowledge anon.       phat will never re-release Mio or Ranko  P-Please.     Yeah the little weld and visible seams aren't great, hence why I would wait for a sale. I think the face looks pretty damn good, and the rest is okay. Not fond of the Maria fig, face is bad. And I just prefer Mio.   Can amiami banned you if you missed payment for once? I already cancel an item last month and I don't want ask them again. This figure quality looks ugly as fuck   They can and might, but I've cancelled many orders and ignored payment twice before and I'm still not banned.    I asked for cancellation 5 times didn't pay 3 times used my total cancel then I can't cancel anymore.       Next time use HLJ to save all this trouble. I usually use Amiami, but for items I'm not 100% sure of I go with HLJ.   I live in Canada and I plan on ordering something from AmiAmi.  The buyfag guide mentions something about Pornogaphy and Lolis, does this prevent me from order anything loli-like or only if that specific loli is subjected/related to 18+ stuff?      Fuck it I'll just not pay, rather spend my money on something useful. Plus I'm leaving for vacation this late month. I'll keep that in mind, mainly use amiami as well.      I like loli, but I wouldn't recommend it because it pays with consequences if customs happen to open your parcel. Just get stuff with adult looking woman and you'll be fine.    I've missed payment for 2 months in a row, and I'm not banned.    Why did you even preorder her? Only po where you know it will be good     something useful  Like what? Another prostitute?     but what is classified as loli? I want to pick up a PriPara nendoroid, is that not even safe?    Wow, aside from the giant eyes, she actually looks Japanese.    You're retarded.    Of course that's safe. Just don't purchase any lewd loli products. Actual pornogarphy or statues with nudity etc    Nigger use your brain. How is a nendoroid even sexual? Don't get lewds and you'll be fine.    I almost got her too but &gt;welded tits    What are you planning to do with that nendo that you even think its lewd?    Not sure I just thought it was gonna be decent, but I also browse other daiki kogyo figures and they look like shit too   Food, clothing      Looking worse and worse and getting more expensive.  This is outrageous.     If these were priced like figmas they might actually be okay, but fuck the prices are outrageous for the quality and just in general.   I'm almost tempted just because it's Haruna though.        but I've cancelled many orders and ignored payment twice before and I'm still not banned.  Man, fuck you. I've asked to cancel something once in 4 years of buyfagging (a tentative pre-order with an unknown release date, at that) and they politely told me to fuck off.    So, Yotsuba got licensed in my place. Should I?   Is that Kaiba?    Probably because it was a tentative one, procuring stock for those is more complicated for them after all. So cancelling one of those is probably the biggest fuck you that you can give them.     procuring stock for those is more complicated for them after all  Yeah sure except they hadn't secured stock for the order. To this day they still haven't, even though I ordered it last year. They could email me tomorrow and say "lol whoops sorry couldn't get it" and I'd be shit out of luck because it's getting harder and harder to find elsewhere. I've been stuck with this fucking order in limbo for 8 god damn months. That's why I wanted to cancel. They're the ones screwing me over, not the other way around.     every order this month delayed   second month in a row   I'm getting the shakes.      That's completely ridiculous. There's no tentative order that should last more than a month.   Boku girl figure with interchangeable parts when?  Also was really looking forward to new prison school figures, but the more and more I see of the new anime the less and less I think it's going to happen. It looks so shitty.     I know. That's why I'm so mad. I've asked them to confirm whether they can get it and they just sent me a passive-aggressive message explaining what a tentative pre-order is and directing me to their FAQ.     it looks so shitty.  No.     It's the perfect time to hunt for some bargains on released figures!    Did you see the OP and ED song choices? That animation quality is nowhere near Danmachi or Railgun either.  I'd rather be realistic now, than delusional and hopeful based on no evidence.     If I didn't despise Infinite Shitos I'd get bunny french slut, it's a nice figure, especially for that price   Well, that's just retarded. I would have guessed that they would gladly cancel it if they have so much problems with it themselves, but they seem insanely stubborn about this for no apparent reason. What is it even?      harder and harder to find elsewhere  It's an item that was indeed released elsewhere after you preordered? That's strange. I'd expect that behavior from them if it was something that kept being delayed by the maker, as I've seen items get delayed month after month until it just says "available late 201x."   I wouldn't be bothered myself unless it was a real expensive item, and I wish you'd post what it is, but I'd understand not wanting to.      Is Yuki Mori Megahouse's Saber?  What's a good proxy service for yahoo auctions? I have a few that are probably gonna need some last minute sniping.  If she's not at next wonfes I'll give up on her. Shame she looks great.           Is that the Beelzebub manga?     hating fun        got  You're a few years late. It has been licensed for a long time and been released up to vol 12 in Indonesia.

People don't get paid for these "studies" I hope     Quite a few people from SEA on /a/ around this time    Cute    I want to get paid for shit like that too.

I'm thankful everyday that I'm not a hoarder, though.       where is this from      that face quality   but waifu in bunny suit  I'm unsure.      Quantum Leap    thanks   Is this the buyfag thread?   No.    Thanks for reminding me why I am saving a money.    Shoot    no its yugi    You're saving one whole money? Hot damn.    Has anyone here seen the Raiden nendo? Supposedly he comes with a nude body, what are the odds it's going to be GSC store exclusive? Has anyone here ever ordered from GSC directly? I'm wondering if it's worth the cost    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127112054  Kill yourself.   So it looks like she's been delayed to July. How many months more do you think she'll actually be delayed?     Hopefully another month, my July order is going to be 38k...    Oh a centaur  boatshit      All great things are GKs    looks too good to be true, must be a GK. I want to learn how to paint them, but that requires time, effort, and patience, of which I have none.     Is she really a GK? She looks absolutely gorgeous   So any news as to when she'll be released?  I've never wanted a GK so much in my whole life   その精液の鬼はだれですか   who wonfes2015 here?   It's still a month away, calm down.    Why    You're waifu is Kirino?    Yes    I feel sorry for you    I'm used to the insults by now. Doesn't stop me from loving her anyway.    wow it feels like last wonfes was like a week ago. I'm getting too old.  I hope my love will get painted this WF       Good. Don't let them change you    I only own aidorus and boatshit. Doesnt stop me. "Good taste" in this thread is determined by who is on. Just say the necessary "Kill yourself faggot" to whoever says you have shit taste and move on.    What's wrong with boats?    I LOVE YOU TOO SANTA CLAUS     I'm getting too old  I know that feeling. I'm noticing blemishes on my skin and and gradual reduction in time in which I can watch anime.     Pretty much this. The majority of my collection is Sonico, Vocaloid, Idols, and vidya-related, so I either just ignore people with their "superior taste" or tell them to fuck off and move on.    What the fuck is even non shit taste? What kind of figures do those faggots buy that they look down i others?    Pretty sure everyone has shit taste.    That's really shit taste though, for real.    Reaally? Curious what example of superior taste have they used on you    I think so too.    No such licensed manga in Indonesia used any language other than Indonesian.    Except me     meong meong      meong        nyaa     Being Malaysian, I'm surprised at times as to the similarities and the differences between Malay and Indonesian. To me, Indonesian sounds like a VERY formal version of Malay    Fuck off.    Now make the superior horse pussy    It doesn't matter what you get because people will always say it's shit.  Even if they secretly like it.      examples  Are you kidding? At best you get a  franchise  And a smug reaction image.         owning anything from mfc's items on fire   Fuck, I still can't decide. I have watched anime a bit and don't really care about it, but this figure is just too cute.   Translation : あなたは何をしている    You mean to say that you're just buying it because it's cute? Have you even seen the anime?    Can you read?    Can you even read? I watched the beginning, it was shit and for little girls, but figure is cute.     I find Indonesian onomatopoeia quite interesting     Feels like they've been the same for years.     it was shit and for little girls  I find that somewhat offensive       Sorry for saying it that way, but it is for kids. It's okay if you like it though, I didn't.    You're 1 off a Pleb Bingo, mate.    So yup   After far to many delays my Mikasa is here it's nice to own the one not shit thing to come from that show.   4 ordered and 1 wished.  Not too bad.      Too bad that Inori is shit.    They're kind of like a fusion of nendoroids and figmas.    Thank you, I like it a lot and wish subs would come out much more faster. But seriously, thanks for being considerate.    That didn't stop you buying the rest.    Funny how iya means the opposite thing in Japanese.    No problem anon, it's okay to like cute stuff. I might try to keep going a couple more episodes and see if I'll like it more.    Do you have any photos of your collection?    Tomoyo still holding up my order   So I have an order in Amiami with keychain that is in stock and Shinobu that will be released 7th July. Will Amiami separate them into two orders?  Now what in the hell is a Spot Sale Item and why is it charging so much handling.  Do you guys have any way to contact j-list, I can't seem to contact them through their website.   no    Yes   Will there ever be any decent Castlevania figures? I really like the outfits and just the overall look of these characters on my pic. Especially that hunky Richter Belmont! Anyways, dont /v/ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;out me to death pls.     Interesting.     Yes, don't.   No.<br/>       maybe    Could you repeat the question?    Shanoa is cute. but     I already made the mistake of ordering through them, now I just want my shit    Here's the pic I posted before. Some figures are in other parts of the house. I'm in the process moving a few things around.     Nice. I regret not getting her earlier despite not being cast off.      not letting you figures out of their cardboard and plastic prisons  how cruel    Welp, the best merch I could get. Gonna enjoy that.   Get the ramen bowl too.    mugs are great    What about it?    casual/10    I'm working on it. Those aren't the only ones unfortunately.    Is it me or are mugs really small?    Are you American?     RAH Miku  I hope you also bought the doll.     GSC charged me for Tomoyo  SOON.     RAH Miku  Please let me know how she looks    Enjoy the twenty-fourth of June.   Thanks.    That size seems pretty reasonable in my opinion. The mugs at my office are so small that I can only put my little finger through the hole halfway.  [ I do have big hands for an asian though      Thanks doc   FINALLY...bought these through amazon.co.jp and had a friend ship them to me...slightly damaged boxes but the books seem to be in order.  Sorry for no resize...I'm on an iPad.     If you mean the DD then yes it's in one of those large boxes.   I'll post some pictures when I open it. From what I see it's not that great and but it was a gift. Like most RAH she dropped in price dramatically after release so still you might be able to find her for a low price.      Would you?   Oh hold on, lemme attach a picture  Now what in the hell is a Spot Sale Item and why is it charging to much for handling?      It just works.   Have any of the rich folks we have here ever had a cleaning lady? Do you entrust your figures to her after teaching her how to clean them, or do you have her clean everything else while you do the figures yourself?   If they made a K-On one.    Cleaning the figures is part of the hobby. Why would you entrust that to anyone else?    I wouldn't, I'm just curious.    I do, and no. Express orders were given not to touch the figs.  Best $85 every two weeks I could ever spend.      Switch around the TT/H to make H/TT and it's perfect.    it looks amazing    I'm guessing Mandarake, in which case you could have easily Googled the answer during that 40 minutes you waited.  As for the handling fee, since you didn't specify an amount no one can tell you if it's a lot.      All I want is that 1:1 Char Aznable helmet, and my search has always been in vain. I might have to fly to Japan to find it.    Just make one yourself.    Ah shit, I'm retarded.   Yeah, it was Manda. Only place I can find that figure. The shipping fee via EMS comes up as 1,860. On the Confirm page it comes up as "Carriage (Tax Included)" and there's also the shipping, so in total I'm paying an extra 2360 for a 4000 fig. I tried placing an order for the same figure at a different store and the only additional cost that came up was the shipping of 500.      Kinda expensive, almost 3kY.    According to myfigurecollection, it is.  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>309703</wbr>      Nothing I'd be able to make would be as good. Ah well, I'll just buy another Jojo figure.    There's a 500 yen fee for orders placed that total less than 5000 yen before shipping. So that "500 yen shipping" at the other store is just the handling fee.  Spot sale items are guaranteed to you if you place an order before someone else. I guess that's why the shipping fee is shown right away instead of having to wait for them to invoice you. So it's probably not a spot sale item at the other store which is why you don't see the actual shipping fee. It'd end up being the same cost at either store.     Yo   Why the fuck did the post just post itself Does anyone think this fig might go cheaper later on after release?     Clean them myself. She bumped my Caster figure off the shelf while dusting and the peg that conect the figure to the base broke. I don't even let her clean the room where most of my figures are anymore. Rather do the cleaning of that room myself.   Yes I'm still mad, I love that Caster.      FunnyKnights   Who?    When I saw the unpainted figure it looked so nice and promising but i really think they fucked it up    Didn't even notice the horse legs until reading comments. This is the first boat girl I actually want...too bad i can't paint     These were the kinds of stories I was hoping to hear. Thanks. I probably wouldn't let mine enter the figure room either, if I had one.    Really? Interesting, thanks anon.    Contact thru twitter, they respond    Those sleeves look so dumb.    You're dumb    Same people who made a few other KanColle figs with some dodgy at best QC.   Will she be expensive after release?     Probably    Probably, since the show is popular.     Well, fuck. She is already too expensive (at least without Amiami's discount) for such a simple figure.     Oh wow. Yeah i need a setup like this! So nice. I like the white displays better than ugly clear detolfs and shit like that.    Of course, the series is really popular and they're milking it for all the money they can get while its still hot.    do you prefer this one than alter's?    Buy it so they make Onodera.    I like MF's more. I'm afraid what Alter will do with the pole, I hate it when they leave them visible.    That was my plan.          11k   Shit, anon. I would want one too, but that's heavy consideration tier dosh right there.       Not sure I want this figure because of tail-butt plug.  ok, I give up. What is the secret to getting her shirt closed?   Do it for second best girl.     I think the nendroid fig would satisfy me when it comes to chitoge. If it were Marika or Haru or Kisaki, I wouldn't even think about it and just buy the full fig.      all heroines have multiple prize figures and some even have figures   Kirito has 2 prize figures, both him as trap  Not that I care about Kirito, but it really shows how rare it is for male protagonists to get figures, even if they're popular as fuck.      That perfect Benten figure. I need it in my life.    buying male figures     it really shows how rare it is for male protagonists to get figures  Kaiki when      He's so beautiful though.     There used to be more but they got bumped off.     not wanting a shota collection  Still waiting for good Killua figure here.     There's no chance of a Kaiki figure until there isone of Araragi.  ;_;      Being insecure     Ararararagi got a figma at least.    About what?     Due to licensing constraints, this product will not be available for shipment to Canada, and United States of America. We appreciate your understanding.     It's Araragi.    Love this gimmick.    I don't know why there isn't a scale of Araragi. I thought he was a likeable MC. People would even buy it if they wanted a complete set of Monogatari's. If Kaiki get's a figma it would be the only one I would buy.   Does anyone have this Yayoi? How dumb does the face look dumb in person?   I don't expect there to be any more expensive merch (nendos would be awesome though). I don't mind paying 3k to remind me of a show I really enjoyed.    Not as dumb. You can see from that picture that the bigger you make it, the more creepy it looks.  I guess the mouth would remain the only issue, if you have a problem with it.       That is brilliant.  But I would be too scared about shipping something so fragile, and I probably would never eat from it.       Not wanting to add fuccbois to your collection    Got home to open my orders from May.   I think it looks fucking hilarious.    It probably comes in a box and amiami usually uses up a tree's worth of packing paper in each box. I'm just trying to figure out if I should get one or two.   When ordering from Cdjapan, do you always have to prepay or is there a way to pay on release like at amiami?   what sound does she make again i hope someone integrates that into a fig     only prepay     I'm just using it as an excuse to not spend ~£12 on a bowl.  But damn I am tempted.  And the show was about the joys of eating together, so you probably need two.  Shame that orders are closed on this.         Can I have a squid?     Bowls are cute, but I don't think there are that many of them around.     Those doors  You fucked up there nigga, I had those and the bezel is way too fucking big to make it a decent display cabinet.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1bi<wbr>1ijeCklQ</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fDm<wbr>NWIUxJEU</wbr>  [ ]      You can always put it on your watch list and pick it up when it's released. Also, what is this going to be? It's listed as an "anime magazine" if it'll feature more art from the show I'll happily get it, but I'm not quite sure.  I also really, really want nendos of the girls so I can make the foods from each episode and photograph them all together.       I love it honestly, feel it's more true to how Kongo looks in most of the fan-art, specially the hair. The original  version looks too off for me to like it. It may be stupid, but in the original version the face with those eyes makes her look like a baby, whereas in the Keiondou Ver. those eyes and a bit more serious expression makes her looks perfect.     kill me   What are the chances that there will be a rerelease of the Holo and Kino figures? They are the only ones that I really want at this point, but they go for upwards of 350 dollars.    18k Base price   Funny Knights   Awful Derpy face   22cm   How about no.  That's basically what the Kongo bust cost, and with it I can at least be sure that the quality is going to be 11/10 as the WHS line has been absolutely perfect so far.          None    Why honestly? I know there is a decent amount of demand for both.    Why does it matter if he bought it only if it was cute (yeah yeah the guide). I mean I mainly buy things based on sentimental value of the figure. But every once in a while I see something that I like the look of but have no idea what it is.    Apart from the fact, that Kino is dead to the Japanese otaku: licensing issues     Probably because not enough people have mailed GSC? They have said time after time that if enough people mail them wanting a re-release of X figure they will try to get the license again and do it.     why is she dead to them?   Opinions on Co-De Box?   Based on the MFC pictures I think her face looks slightly less ridiculous.    This makes me happy to see two anons getting along so well.     Nigga, it's more than a decade old by now. The last thing released of it was the movie 8 years ago.     Warm it up with a hairdryer.      Blister packs   Disgusting        Holy shit, you're right. what have I been doing.       buying an empty box   Why?       Yeah, that is fucked up.    it looks like a toy for 4-year-olds    Looks like a toy for little girls. It's aimed at little girls so I guess GSC reached their goal.   Shit the more I look at this the better it looks  The half racing suit is nice as well.     the only racing miku I care about    nice display     It isn't, the novel is still being published.      Those eyebrows are great.     Thanks, I thought it wasn't bad at the time but that middle bezel meant that anything display behind it would be hidden, so I could barely display anything in it in the end.  I since upgraded to a proper display cabinet.   A lot of things are great, those curves, that waist, that top. I don't particularly like the expression though, a bit too generic.         I had no idea that other one even came out.  ￥ 14,400   Welp.       Lucina back in the Most Viewed    For once I'm not sure if this is the usual joke or if you're seriously asking this.     I since upgraded to a proper display cabinet.   You can't say that and not post a pic man Don't be a tease       Despite Kino being 4th on the re-release poll a few years ago they never even hinted at a re-release. I think it's time to give up anon.     There's literally nothing in there.     I have this same issue with my current display. Bookcase with wood-framed glass doors essentially hides the centermost object when they're closed. And since I collect Nendoroids exclusively, the odd one in the middle is never seen unless I open the doors.  Ah well, keeping them as dust-free as possible is more important, and I've achieved that by putting a weatherstrip of a matching color between the doors. I leave the doors open for a while every few days to air them all out and properly display them.       buying elex shit  Just read the scanlation and buy the Japanese copy.     That's the only thing that stopped me from ordering.    I can't get over how retarded that outfit would be for riding a motorcycle. At least the 2013 one is wearing a proper racing suit.     I preordered it because I couldn't find that little tidbit on the page. Now I have to cancel it. Fucking dissapointing.     fuck that stupid tail and heart on her hair fuck that.     There is, you just can't really see it because it's a potato picture and the Akariiin version.   It would be funnier if he actually removed her before making the picture though.      Shit and wasted resources.     checked it on AmiAmi   still 25k  And here I thought he was binning.       Now I see it. Didn't know that existed.     Cute guys &gt;&gt;&gt; cute girls   Guys please help. I want to cancel something on Tora. It's still in 未発送 so google says I can cancel it.  Something that was about to sell out got restocked and now I'd rather wait for other stuff to go up for sale and ship them all together. I already have the form but I don't know how to fill the last parts.   Should I use "ご注文のキャンセルのお願い" as subject and then something like "#ordernumberをキャンセルしてください"?        There is no secret, it's a piece of shit.    I have him and he's great but I don't know if "cute guy' is the right term, because that implies he looks even slightly like a guy. He's more like Panty with a dick bulge.    He has an ugly man face.    Oh fuck no. Are my IM@S girls going to come like this? Fuck no.    I hate those gaping fucking mouths so many iM@S figures have. It does not translate well to 3D at all.    From the front she has a nice pose, looks pretty balanced, and the scythe is pretty cool.    I think his face is androgynous enough. This is pretty apparent from some angles.    Then this happens.   ◇ Upcoming Items!  ・A scale figure of one of Ylisse’s Pegasus Knights.  painted. Tomorrow morning 4am pst.       She looks great from the front. I wish I had the requisite level of degeneracy to appreciate butt plugs.     Lewd.     Enma AI  Literally the only figure that I do give  at least a fucking tousand  fuck s  about from all the scales there.    I just realized there aren't any nendos of a lot of fighting games like kof, vampire savior or street fighter   YOUR A MESHI<br/>       Am I the only one who likes butt plugs and ass cutouts?  This is lewd even for alter standards and I fully support it.        Dreamcast when?   They better fucking make Dreamcast and Mega Drive.    Even for Alter? Alter are one of the most tame figure companies.    I want to fuck hair-down Yayoi.   I think I just hit the $1000 mark in terms of what I've spent on my collection. That's over the course of one year so not too bad I guess...   Another Yuki, holy shit.    Maybe after the Nep crossover game?  Right?    So this came today. What a nice box. I like things with nice boxes.     Nice collection, man.    11/10 Best I've seen.    Cute.    I would have enjoyed it more if you'd submitted it at full phone camera resolution.     dominion   not nitroplus masters   do you even /a/ bro       Go where it's hot and you'll regularly see people wear less than that while riding.     Throw that shitty ugly Nintendo thing in the garbage, fuck. Or just store it somewhere, don't display it.     I am so fucking ready. Thank you, anon.     Do you have any repeat squids?     Guy posting about it got me looking and it's on tokyo otaku mode shipped for $95. Not too bad, I bought it.     mfc's items on fire  Actually I don't get this, what ' items on fire' means?      Post your MFC      I think it's items that are extremely popular and get the most page views.    MFC?   18k base price? Please tell me you are pulling that number out of your ass    My Fat Cock.    Popular things.    never mind... just checked myself. 14k on amiami, 18k base price.   What the actual fuck. I know kongou is a popular character, but for a company with as shit QC as funnyknights and a weird looking face, I didnt expect this one to go for that much...      Newer companies without the established purchase base often aren't able to charge the low prices GSC can. Griffin does the same shit, their scales are regularly more expensive than kotobukiya or GSC (and occasionally more than alter but alter's prices vary wildly).     Ohh, I see Thanks helpful anons      Maybe if you actually fixed those doors so they closed properly.    Oh, that's a nice deal, but I'd have to add something else for the free shipping. I hope their packaging is okay.    For me at least it was free as a new member. I didn't have an account there previously.    can't stop hot gluing my Ranko figures  I...I CANT STOP, HER PALE BODY IS JUST SO FUCKING LEWD.  So anyone think they'll re-release the Ranko figma like they did with Rin?       if only we lived in a world with genetic engineering advanced enough to produce animu girls.  One day anons, someone has to be brave enough to dream such a thing.       With huge eyes big heads and small noses they're bound to run into a lot of health issues    Fuck. You think she'll be made with better quality?   <br/>  I got a Signum today.  I didn't realize she was 1/7 till I got her.     It's not a re-release, it's a new figure.     nah m8 what about those ayy lamooos they seem to do fine.   Nothings impossible remember anon!       Ehh barely. I doubt they make a new Ranko though, since her figma came out pretty recently, but its not impossible.    My Yamato finally arrived. I knew it was big but I didn't realize it was this big. I don't have anywhere to put it so it's on the floor right now.    It's on the floor right now      I've cleared a space for her already. I-168 just turned up today as well.     I had that happen with a figure once.    Take the shirt off of her, close it properly and keep it closed so the pegs get shaped properly for the shirt, I had the shirt like that for a while and then I could rather easily get it to sit properly on her.    She really is HUGE compared to my other 1/7 scales.    I thought the same thing. I got her and thought "Jesus Christ, she's much bigger than my other 1/6"    Where did you find the squids? Auction?    I always do that. I order figures and don't check their scales until they arrive, and then end up having trouble displaying them sometimes.   Worst was when I ordered that massive 1/7 Nanoha, and actually did check the scale but for some reason had a mindblank and thought that 1/7 was smaller than 1/8. She was a bit of a surprise.      My problem as well. You literally must have mental problems to enjoy that shit.    This shit is way too expensive to be actually selling it to Children. Even if it was 2000 yen retail it would be expensive.   So i got https://www.nippon-yasan.com/figure<wbr>s/1695-zero-no-tsukaima-nendoroid-l<wbr>ouise.html from NY (It is quite an old nendo)  And the stand for it is like pic related, but i have no idea how this is meant to work.  I just have it leaning against it, supported by her hair.  Like, what do i do with this?   pls no bully, i'm a nendo virgin         </wbr></wbr>   My Miku nendo, she just sat in the stand, those bits around around her legs. Check MFC photos to see how other users have done it?    Hooks between the legs. From the ones of mine which have that stand, it's completely shit most of the time.     Ring stands are the worst. You basically have them sit their ass in the stand.      Okay so, i put it in around the legs, and it's just kind of elevated above in the stand in the air a little, like 1-2mm  I'm guessing this is how it is because i dont see any other way        I was going to take a picture of one of my Nendos to show you but the stand broke as i took her off of it. So never mind.   I'll be real here. I spent years thinking figma was just a weaboo way of saying figure.  i thought i could look forward to seeing a prototype of that kinmosa alice nendo, but i guess they dropped it and went along with yuki yuna.   i hate that they dont release sets though and only focus on one character, when they first did the madoka nendo does anyone know if they released them within the same period or was it spread out?    Reach for the stars UFO-kun   I want to smell Reina's shoes    I heard somewhere they were in first name basis outside of school. Is this true?    His wife used to call him that. It'd would just bring up bad memories.       Why is Hibiki selling mediocre in terms of KyoAni standards. I mean the BD sales are less than Amagi.   Scans out bitches  Dump images with discussion please, 1/5 of last thread is literally Irohasu~   Unless you want me dumping Yukino in the name of Spyro      You want to base your statement on a few pictures taken on a single spot? That's not convincing.       We'll have to agree to disagree. The slight indent in the otherwise perfect curve of plump thighs covered by stockings is what keeps me going when I feel like the world is crashing down around me.     Why exactly would he be dying?   Did you see him post that he was ill or are you being a retard?        Pokemon has great girls, do you agree?     I enjoyed the fights but much of the problems during the movie were because Molly was unable to deal with her own emotions. Ash's mom getting kidnapped, her trying to stay in her delusions, etc. She got over it in the end but it could have all been easily avoided.  She's a good character, nonetheless. You can't blame her for her actions since she was just a little kid.        i got a fuckhuge pokegirl folder i cant even be bothered to check for double images and higher quality ones sorry       I love creative uses of psychic powers.    She might not have the biggest breasts but we still love her, right?  Rule 63 thread   No traps.    Best of the four   I have this      What the fuck is going on with that wine glass?   </blockquote>]
