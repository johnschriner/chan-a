[ i guess you've heard of Unbalance x2? <br>Did you that i got a sequel (Unblalance x2.5) and a new alternate story Unblalance x3? (Pic related)<br><br>Sequel:</br></br></br>  Seque (Pic related)l: http://www.comicgt.com/Novel/ComicD<wbr>etail?&amp;comicsIdx=53&amp;sortBy=dateDESC<wbr>&amp;pageSize=7&amp;curpage=2<br>Alternate story: http://www.comicgt.com/WebToon/Comi<wbr>cDetail?comicsIdx=49&amp;Param=15</wbr></br></wbr></wbr>  Summary of the 1st chapter of new alternate story by a Korean bro:<br><br>MC was raised by his sister, who is a CEO of a company she started up.<br>MC overhears his aunt and uncle saying that him and his sister are unrelated by blood. MC calls his sister while she's driving.<br>Truck. Sister gets amnesia and forgets everything.<br>Sister begins to think of MC as a man and MC gets more attracted to her.<br>It doesn't seem that related to each other aside from the fact that the authors are the same and the title.</br></br></br></br></br></br>      Zoro took 100 times more damage than this at thriller bark and didn't lose his memories. Just sayin'.   Sabo has now left <br>Another sideplot wrapped up.<br><br>So, will there be time for partying or are we gonna wrap up this Mam bullshit now before heading on to Zou arc?</br></br></br>  Zoro is admiral level to be fair.  <br>Zoro also wasn't 12 at Thriller Bark.</br>  <br>If you actually think it depends on how much damage you take if you get amnesia or not than you are truly the biggest retard ever</br>  <br>Luffy isn't retarded enough to party while half his fucking crew is potentially fighting a Yonko. What the fuck have you been reading ?</br>  <br>the what does it take you autist?<br><br><br> hurr durr only children can get amnesia  <br>Retard</br></br></br></br></br>  Just don't reply to OP. Think of a proper discussion or just keep making new threads until the mods gets pissed.  What the fucking shit?<br><br>Like<br><br>What</br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10 TL Note</br>  <br>On my phone, can't read the filename.</br>  <br>translators note - i did not translate this</br>  <br> the what does it take you autist? <br>Not that anon, but Zoro did not suffer any severe damage to his head, normally a heavy concussion can lead to memory loss. Oh and he did not almost drown on top of it all which also can lead to amnesia because your brain does not get enough oxygen and countless cells are dying. But you are baiting anyway so I don't know why I am even replying to you.</br></br>  <br> so I don't know why I am even replying to you. <br>So don't. Stop the cycle. Don't reply to this either. Start a discussion instead.</br></br>    <br> I don't understand anything; The post. </br>  <br>OP BTFO<br>P<br>B<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Damn, people are obsessed with Sabo. Must be a lot more popular than I thought he was.  <br>Fuckin' kekked hard. Thanks Anon.</br>  <br>Is this by the same guy who made that Madmax fanart in Odas style?</br>  <br>It been a whole night since Big Mom confronted them. Likely they already dealt with her. Nami probably showed her the card she got from Lola and now they are cool.</br>  <br>Well, what does it mean?</br>  <br>He's pretty cool, at least according to the target demographic. He's got fire, which is edgy but not 'Cold Steele the Hedgehog' edgy. He has an interesting character design, he's Luffys brother, and a badass with the revolutionary army. It's only natural for him to be popular.</br>  <br> Not that anon, but Zoro did not suffer any severe damage to his head <br>Baseless assumption. Literally nothing suggests that the damage Kuma gave him was limited to his body minus his head. Also Usopp took more damage to the head than Sabo did.</br></br>  <br>Looks like Fairy Tail.</br>  <br> trolls getting more and more desperate <br>No wonder why most of /a/ defend One Piece.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't seem like the type to forgive transgressions so easily.</br>  <br>But did Usopp also drown?</br>  What's with all these Sabo hate thread lately??  friendly reminder that he's the current 7th shichibukai member right now  <br> still trying <br>Don't be such a sore loser and stop embarrassing yourself any further.</br></br>  <br>Maybe. Maybe not. Luffy would have no idea unless Sanji calls back, which hasn't happened yet. As far as Luffy is concerned, half his crew is fighting the fight of their lives.</br>  <br>They are made by a single autist who is trying to start some epic new meme but gets BTFO'd constantly. Funny at first but now it got quite boring tbh</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>It's literally one person. He's probably the guy who posts the "women can't use haki" bait.</br>  I think the real question on everybody's mind is, how would Law or Kidd have gone against Lucci pre-timeskip? Their fruits are better, but could they have kept up with Lucci's speed and power and not simply gotten speed blitzed?  <br>Some troll who hates One Piece and trying to make it bad despite it still being coherent. I bet he is a Narutard butthurt that Tobi being Obito having survived his apparent death during a flashback without foreshadowing and it doesn't make sense he joined Madara as a villain.</br>  <br> Baseless assumption <br>Not really. Zoro only felt the pain  of Sabos and Isshos victory  and did not receive any direct hits to his head, body or anything else.</br></br>  <br><br>just wow<br><br><br><br>this is literally my first thread about this. Why are you so autistic about people not liking your favorite character?<br><br> He's probably the guy who posts the "women can't use haki" bait. <br>Of course, also I'm Rebeccafag, every single tripfag, all the Fujos and the Trapfag. There is literally only me and you in this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right, 12 year old Sabo was just the weakest little shit. What a pleb. At least he didn't die from a mere gun shot wound like Corazon and Bellemere amirite? Kek weaklings.<br><br> Is that seriously your gripe with this shit? Can we move on now? </br></br></br>  <br>sure son, sure</br>  <br>His body after receving luffy's pain when sanji found him proved that his whole body got damaged.<br><br><br>fuck off you narutofaggot<br><br><br><br>retards</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>looks gay as fuck</br>  <br> His body after receving luffy's pain when sanji found him proved that his whole body got damaged. <br>Oh, so you assume feeling a lot of pain is equal to a heavy hit to the head and also can cause amnesia? You are a retard and you post like a 12 year old. Stop.</br></br>  I made Vergo a strawhat  <br> Oh, so you assume feeling a lot of pain is equal to a heavy hit to the head <br>YES, you fucking idiot. Just compare how Zoro looked when he told Kuma to give him teh damage and how he looked when Sanji found him.</br></br>  <br>Sabo was a child</br>  <br>No, you stop you fucking child. Stop replying to obvious bait, for fuck's sake. Just. Stop. It is Not that hard. Just don't fucking reply. How fucking hard is that ?</br>  <br> YES, you fucking idiot <br>Then you really are a retard whithout a shred of medical knowledge. As I said, just stop.</br></br>  <br>Law is likely to be the first openly gay man in One Piece. No hetro man dress or have tats like that.</br>  <br>Fucking. Is this the birth of Sabofag? <br><br> An obsession with a particular character <br> Same bulk reply style <br> Rebeccafag at least puts effort into his shitposts. Doesn't matter, still the same.  <br>Literal Rebeccafag 2.0 ! This is almost like poetry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  STOP REPLYING TO HIM YOU AUTISTIC CUNTS. DEVELOP YOUR FUCKING 12 YEAR OLD BRAINS AND STOP GIVING HIM ATTENTION.  Lets take a short break from shitposting and baiting and discuss why Sadi-chan makes my dick so hard  <br>kill yourself<br><br><br> There is only a single guy not liking sabo <br>Look at all the threads before this one you faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Look at all the threads I made before this one you faggot  <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br>That's beautiful. C-can I request a Croc version of this?</br>  <br> implying Domino isn't best Impel girl </br>  <br>Zorofag are delusional</br>  <br>Cause she's hot as fuck. Something about not seeing her full face makes her hotter. Same with Fem-Killer. Also, her VA in the anime id pretty good too.</br>  <br> being this insecure <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Thanks. D-do you have a Croc pic you'd like me to use?</br>  <br>Don't drag our good name to the ground because of one guy.</br>  <br> kill yourself xd <br>you sound like a parrot</br></br>  <br>Do i see pepperonis in that picture?</br>  <br>and you seem to be a faggot, so what's the point? Discuss op or fuck off.</br>  <br>CHECKED</br>  <br>H-how about this one?</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br> Something about not seeing her full face makes her hotter <br>hmmm, but seeing her eyes is not that bad either</br></br>  <br> There is only a single guy not liking sabo <br>I'm actually suggesting the complete opposite, Sabofag. I'm suggesting that you have a raging homolust for this character <br><br>There are also a lot of faggots that hate Rebecca too. But none are as obsessed with each respective character as you and Rebeccafag are. You can't move on even if he's given a plausible, coherent backstory that leaves no plotholes, a touching reunion with his brother, in an arc that best fits his amnesia theme. You're upset because he wasn't treated with the utmost perfect care and wasn't given the most mindblowing backstory in all of one piece. If you feel this offended about a kid getting amnesia after getting hit by a fucking canon, admit it, you are literally obsessed with his character.</br></br></br></br>  <br> openly gay <br>I wish. He's definitely gay though. Everyone in the OP threads seems to agree, even the non-fujos. That's saying something.</br></br>  <br>Yeah. <br><br>Give me 30 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>typical fujoshit delusion</br></br>  <br> expressing your opinion about a character means you're obsessed with him <br>0/10<br>I like the actual strawhats minus Brook and Chopper, does that mean, I'm obsessed with Brook and Chopper?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes he is.<br><br>He partied on PH even though they know Doffy was coming.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he isn't. Jesus christ dude. Luffy had his entire crew there. And Smoker, who Luffy thinks is strong. And Law. And the G5. And they had Caesar. Their crew wasn't fucking halved and they weren't fighting a goddamn Yonko.</br>  <br>Okay, everyone besides you. Happy now?</br>  Law is obviously bisexual you fucking faggots.  <br>Can't think of any females that piqued Law's interests.</br>  Currently rereading Drum and man is Chopper's design great there. He looks like a moomin and that is cute as fuck.<br><br>Not cute in the "marketable to jap girl kawaiiii~ :3 xD" kind of way, but just plain old fashioned cute.</br></br>  Threadly reminder  I like Sabo because  when I was 14 I made up an OC crew whose captain used a pipe as a weapon and I fucking loved those godawful little abominations. Since he also fights with a pipe, he reminds me of them in a good way, even if that means he's fanfiction-tier.   <br>2/10</br>  <br> What is Bon Clay? </br>  <br>He was obviously trying to flirt with tashigi, but didn't know how to do it, so he copied Doffy hoping to get that glasses pussy.</br>  <br>That is perhaps the most autistic thing I've read this week.<br>Congrats.</br></br>   Rushed OP because I didn't like it <br> The reason I don't like it might be because I rushed it <br> Have to go back and reread it all just because I might actually like it <br> mfw: Have to reread a series I don't even like. <br><br>Fuck I wished I could just be into OP like the rest of you are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, because I don't see you making a shitty thread about Zoro's lesser-tier backstory and his reasoning to risk everything to become the strongest swordsman in the first place.<br><br>Obviously, for some reason, Sabo's objectively more tragic backstory offends you more than this. You make a whole thread about the mistreatment of his character and reply offensively to anyone that tells you "hey man, it's actually not that bad". Cause they don't know shit right? They don't understand how fucking tragic it is that Sabo of all people got stuck with the cliche amnesia shtick !<br><br>C'mon, you're obsessed. It's fine, you're not alone. I'm sure he's got a lot of raging boners pointing his way judging by the character popularity polls, and the past three Sabo threads all dedicated to him and the mistreatment of his character. But you chose to make another one for god knows why. Most likely because you just can't get enough of talking about Sabo all day and night.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Girls just can't get into shounen.</br>  <br>Don't force yourself to read something if you don't like it.<br>It'll only make you hate it.</br></br>  <br>Kek, you're delusional. I only headcanon about three characters in the whole OP universe as gay, and Law's one of them. He's gay as fuck.</br>  <br>Why not just, not be into it? It's not for everyone. If you tried it once, and you didn't like it that's fine. You shouldn't force yourself to like stuff just because you want to follow the mass.</br>  <br>Trannies don't count.</br>   caring about sexuality in a manga that does not have any romance <br>Why do people do this?</br>  <br>The first thing I loved about One Piece where the jokes. How it started with Luffy calling Colby a bastard, and saying he hated him. Luffy knocking Zoro off the boat got me everytime.</br>  <br>Bon Clay is 10x manlier then you could ever hope to be</br>  <br><br>Or I should've said I don't see you making threads about Chopper turning into a moeblob and Brook getting the least development out of the strawhats. But whatever, still holds that you're obsessed with Sabo more than them.</br></br>  <br>Out of curiosity who are the other two?</br>  <br> Chopper turning into a moeblob and Brook getting the least development out of the strawhats <br>We had enough of this after the timeskip. Sabo is an actual *new* case of cancer.</br></br>  I thought that was a good chance BB would kill him before he ever got to do anything cool, same for his crew.<br>If Kidd and friends are after him there should be better odds the red hair pirates will cut loose at some point.</br>  <br>Sanji and Zeff.</br>   One person got anaconda from his bread miseries <br>No shit nigger otherwise every Two Thing peoles would has anaconda</br>  <br>reminder of what?</br>  <br>no anon, YOU are the cancer</br>  <br>I sure as hell hope so, because I'm a girl.<br><br>Croc and Marco.</br></br></br>  <br>Btw is it doctor thing to change from a brimmed hat to that cap thing like a level up or was just to make them marketable kawaii?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Just another day in a One Piece thread....<br><br><br>The way I see it Shanks will take the Kidd alliance as his underlings after he beats them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being this defensive <br>Just accept that your favorite character is shit</br></br>    <br>Is Croc gay because he used to be a chick or is he just straight up gay?</br>  <br><br>He still has the brimmed hat.</br></br>  <br>i hate sabo because he made koala cry<br><br>fucking son of a bitch, he's probably going to get himself killed later and maker her cry more<br><br>fucking cunt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it is you who is insecure since you have a minority opinion</br>  <br>Half his face looks like Mihawk here.</br>  <br>Croc ain't gay he put all his teams in manxwoman pairings</br>  <br>He does? Don't remember him wearing one after the TS.</br>  <br>Why the fuck are you trying to follow something that you clearly don't like ? Just read something else.</br>  <br> minority opinion <br>yeah no<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128443<wbr>784/#128443784<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128515<wbr>053/#128515053<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128521<wbr>458/#128521458<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128537<wbr>285/#128537285<br><br>And this came out of the first page, I didn't bother to search on. Look through the threads retard.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying luffy would party without his nakama </br></br>  <br>Chopper is still wearing his red hat, its just wrapped in that blue thing</br>  <br>Finally, someone understands. Why the fuck do people think Luffy cares about Partying more than half his crew ?</br>  <br>Kushina also died falling down stairs<br><br>Are you going to say everyone's damage output is the same, especially when they were kids?</br></br></br>  <br>they are  brothers </br>  <br> threads on /a/ are representative  <br>are you literally 12?</br></br>  <br><br>It's under the cap - the manga shows it better than the anime really.</br></br>  <br>Oh shiiieeet it does seem like that. The fuck is the point of that blue thing? To change style cause he can't take his hat off?</br>  <br> he thinks Kushina is dead </br>  <br> Look through the threads retard. <br>I suggest that is something you should do because there are lots of differing opinions in these threads.</br></br>  <br>Well then he is manlier than the manliest character you can think of.<br>Bon Clay was alpha as fuck. He is the Freddy Mercury of OP.</br></br>  <br>Its confirmed hat glassesfag isn't her</br>  <br>They literally are for /a/'s taste. That's it. I'm not discussing with you if Sabo is a popular character, because the poll proved he is. That's not what we are speaking about you retard. <br><br><br>Yeah, but mostly either shitted on Sabo or called him good while shitting on amnesia.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And the people complaining about Chopper MOST vocally were Chopperfags being upset about what Oda did to one of their favorite characters, which makes sense<br><br>Honestly, you're just supporting my observation even more. You're suggesting that you're not a Sabofag, I'm suggesting that you are, which again, is fine anon. Don't fight it. <br><br>And I don't remember it being this bad with Chopper back then. Three threads in a row about the same shit? You guys just can't get enough, geez.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By whom? Maybe she had amnesia?</br>  <br>Where does that Croc used to be a chick theory come from?</br>  <br> what is wano </br>  <br> They literally are for /a/'s taste. <br> /a/'s taste <br> /a/ is one person <br>yes, you are 12. now lets move on</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you're still here.<br><br>Here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he was born a straight chick. <br><br>He was trying to make himself look less suspicious, of course.<br><br>I'm glad Law decided to get himself a new hat, the first one was ugly as sin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ivankov knows a secret about him, ivankov can change the gender of people</br>  <br>Simply magnificent.</br>  <br> Honestly, you're just supporting my observation even more. You're suggesting that you're not a Sabofag, I'm suggesting that you are, which again, is fine anon. Don't fight it. <br> someone shits on a character <br> n-no I know you secretly love him!! <br>Are you retarded? Do you suggest that Chopper and Sabo have the same value?<br><br><br>Nope you are retarded. I of course meant the opinion of the most anons on /a/ and you know that. Don't try to change the subject now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what if the lil nigga had amnesia. There isnt some magic amnesia meter like "You must take this much damage to have amnesia"<br><br>Besides Sabo's head got rekt. Zoro doesnt even have scars from TB.</br></br>  When will Sabofag and Rebeccafag get together and have sex. They can make an army of shitposters to finally get rid of OP threads on /a/ once and for all.  <br><br>Ivankov knows his 'secret' - a 'secret' Croc was desperate not to let anyone know that he changed his mind and helped Luffy.<br><br>Ivankov also happens to be able to change the gender of people with his DF.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, that's true art right there. I might just make it my phone wallpaper. Thanks anon.<br><br>His secret past.</br></br></br>  <br>Some Oda interview awhile back<br><br>Also I guess I meant Tashigi earlier<br><br>I think it was the same one where he touched on the subject of Luffy's mother briefly. Not in the sense that he told us who she was, but I think he said she'd be ugly at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I of course meant the opinion of the most anons on /a/ <br>and you surely can show me a statistic now that proves this, you can't? Oh, then I suggest you get rid of your tunnel vision you underaged piece of shit.</br></br>  <br><br>I see. Thanks</br></br>  My problem with the amnesia bit is any other author would be getting lit up for using it. It's a terrible trope to introduce a character that should have otherwise shown up.<br><br><br>Soap opera tier writing. Oda is above that. Or at least the way everyone praises him he should be.</br></br></br>  Remember to not reply to the cancerous tripfag  <br>and you surely can show me a statistic now that disproves this, you can't? Oh, then I suggest you get rid of your tunnel vision you underaged piece of shit.</br>  <br>sorry, you aren't 12, you are 10 at most.</br>  I mean its not like child skulls arent significantly<br> weaker to account for the still growing body. Oh wait that's exactly the case.</br>  <br>I would agree if niggas was gettin amnesia left and right, but this nigga went through some amnesiaficating shit.</br>  <br><br>Do you perhaps, work for mangastream?</br></br>  <br> if I call him a child, there surely believe that I'm old enough to browse 4chinks <br>Listen always trying to have the last word while writing senseless shit proves besically taht you are projecting, so speak about One Piece again or fuck off.</br></br>  <br><br>Stop it you're far too kind.</br></br>  <br><br>You're both trying to get the fucking last word, you retards.</br></br>  <br>I agree. <br>It also made him more shy looking, which fits his character.</br></br>  <br>Listen always trying to have the last word while writing senseless shit proves besically taht you are projecting, so speak about One Piece again or fuck off.</br>  <br>•*Wooshing sfx*</br>  <br>god was he a fat fuck back then</br>  <br>I liked Chopper more when he was a pudgy humanoid reindeer and not fucking Pikachu with antlers.</br>  <br> someone shits on a character <br> n-no I know you secretly love him!! <br>You're not shitting on his character though. You're upset that he was given the amnesia cliche. That Oda made his 12 year old self weak enough to not be able to endure a canon to the head. Blasphemy. You're upset at what Oda because Sabo wasn't given nearly as good of a explanation as your god-tier headcannon. <br><br>That's not shitting on a character. That's shitting on the author for how they handled said character. Why would you care as much as you do if you weren't such a Sabofag? Why would you be so offended with the amnesia cliche given to him, even if it makes sense? Because you don't think it's worthy enough for Sabo? You just can't move on for whatever reason. That's more dedication than I have with Zoro and his shitty backstory and I'm the biggest Zorofag you'll ever meet, man. You're obsessed with blond fire dick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Oda would be lit up for making Sabo into a douche who didnt want to save his brother.<br><br>The criticism shouldn't be of the amensia trope, it should introducing such an important character late in the story that the only way to reasonably explain why he wasnt in the MC's life is by using a clichéd trope.<br><br>But, everyone focused on just the amensia takes away all the attention away from the real issue.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oda is above that. Or at least the way everyone praises him he should be. <br>There's your fucking problem. You're reading a shounen manga. Stop that shit.</br></br>  <br> implying the tripfag is the real problem here <br>I hope you're all conscious you morons are discussing OP in the 4the Sabo bait thread in a row.</br></br>  <br> Why would you care as much as you do if you weren't such a Sabofag? <br>Because it's shit-tier writing, introducing a thrid brother and saying <br> hurr durr he just forgot everyone, that's why he didn't show up xD <br> Please be gentle when luffy's second father shows up :) <br>You are literally retarded, because you are suggesting that everyone who shit's on a character is said characterfag. That's retarded. No one would say that Brook is a shit-toer strawhat without addressing him being underused, Does that make ever brook hater a brook fag? No you autist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The new look is symbolic of his training on the island of giant birds.<br><br>Because Pikachu got strong after beating spearows.</br></br></br>  <br>remember that time Zoro helped him wash his back?</br>  <br>Shonen isn't above literary criticisms. There has been genuinely good writing in this very manga. I don't know if he was forced by his editors or not to make sabo and this was the best he could do. But it doesn't stop the problems inherent with creating such a character. It obviously was a good idea monetarily since Sabo seems to be popular and will push out sales.</br>  <br>The problem of Sabo haters is that Oda gave a reasonable explanation for him not showing up at MF or contacting Ace or Luffy in 10 years, now they focus on the amnesia part to vent their hatred. People like this a never satisfied no matter what Oda does and shift to something else to nitpick about immediately.</br>  <br>wait what<br>x - 7 = 19 + x<br>x = 26 + x<br>0 = 26</br></br></br></br>  <br>see <br><br>x - 7 = 19 - x<br>x = 26 - x<br>2x = 26<br>x = 13</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Congratulations dude, you can resolve basic bait equations.</br>  <br> But, everyone focused on just the amensia takes away all the attention away from the real issue. <br>This. Fuck all of that discussion missing the point in the last three threads.</br></br>  <br>Not anyone in this argument but I don't like him as a character, both him and Ace don't feel like actual characters to me and are just 'there'. Though the amnesia part isn't so bad as it's the only explanation that makes sense.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br><br><br>oh. now it makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>It's cool OP, I think we get it now.</br>  <br><br>literally fuck sabo</br></br>  <br>Kuina fell down the stairs and got amnesia. Deciding not to return to her father, she moved to Wano country.</br>  <br> both him and Ace don't feel like actual characters to me and are just 'there'. <br>Why though? Both Ace and Sabo got backstories that fleshed out their characters and ideals.</br></br>  <br>I'm the Op and you're quoting some other guy<br><br><br>top kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>We had a ton of wrong questions in our Maths book when I was learning. Shit even confused the teacher a couple of times.</br>  <br>Well, maybe there are not as much people bothered by this as you think.</br>  <br>It didn't really matter whether tha was op or not I was just joking but fuck you as well. I hope you trip on pigeon shit and break your skull.</br>  <br>Not to me, both of them have very minimal dialogue and I still don't feel I understand them as much. All I know about Ace is that he questions why he exists constantly and all I know about Sabo is that he was Aces noble friend who wanted to free himself, and now wants to free the world from the world government. They don't have as much personality other than being Luffy's brothers.</br>  <br>This is basically me because I watched the one piece anime up until fishman island and hated it because I got spoiled about marineford and the timeskip and couldn't wait for it to get there but that led me to not enjoying everything else in OP.<br><br>Now I'm reading the manga and it's pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>No, people just called me a "hater" when I said Sabo was not well implemented and went on and on explaining why the amnesia is a totally possible thing to happen, missing the point that the amnesia was not the central reason for my dislike of Sabo.</br>  <br><br>Yeah manga is much better.<br><br>However for the anime there is also One Pace which fixes the pacing of the anime to match the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>stay mad shitposter speak about OP or fuck off<br><br><br>I still feel like Ace's dead actually made him a noteworthy character which was of course crushed by Sabo when he took the Mera Mera. Really unlike WB's fruit which BB got no one should have goten Ace's. It would have been way better if the Mera Mera never showed up in teh story again after Marineford.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't taken a maths class in eight years and I'm confused as fuck. How does this shit work again? I can't remember.  I think I might be suffering from amnesia. </br>  <br> what does + and - mean <br>I think you're problem is way  more deep rooted. </br></br>  <br>Given your avatar and the fact that it's already been explained multiple time in this thread, I'd say you've got a lot more to worry about than possible amnesia.</br>  <br>It's fucking algebra, you 10 year old</br>  <br> shitposter <br>Okay. I will shit up your thread and turn it into a gay dumping zone even you tranny uncle wouldn't dare step into.</br></br>  Reminder that the people extremly mad at the Sabo stuff are ones that spent months and months theorizing in their little gay theory notebook on why Sabo was gone.<br><br>If they had any real sense of writing they would know Oda just made up the character willy nilly without thinking about how it affects the past. They would know that he new wrote himself into a corner and took the lazy and easy way out that just so happened to also make the most sense.<br><br>I mean theres really no reason for Sabo to stay out of his brothers lives, otherwise their brotherhood is meaningless. They put their brothers over their lives as pirates and revolutionaries. <br><br>But no, these people cant over the fact their gay theories that he was on a secret mission or something never came true. These people fancy themselves better writers than Oda. Even though they have never written anything buy shit theories on an anonymous imageboard.<br><br>Just look at how obsessed they are at calling Oda a hack for not using their shitty fanfic. If this manga was written by them no one would read it, and this is why they are so assblasted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> avatar <br>This isn't narutoforums.</br></br>  <br>I feel the complete opposite way. Ace got little screentime but the flashback and his speech just before he died layed everything bare about his character. Same with Sabo, his backstory made it perfectly clear why he wants to be free and that he felt like suffocating in his hometown. Finding a place in the world for themselves is what Ace was and Sabo is about. I think Oda managed to make this come across in a a very good way even though we did not see both of these characters as much as the protagonists.</br>  <br>Thanks for that pasta, it confirms my belief that OP is a faggot.</br>  <br> No one would say that Brook is a shit-toer strawhat without addressing him being underused, Does that make ever brook hater a brook fag? No you autist. <br>Do you see threads upon threads popping up addressing Brook and his underdeveloped character? No. Most Brook haters just shit on Brook with a post or too. 'He's the shittest strawhat, least character development. All he is, is a panty perv that tells skull jokes." end of story. They probably don't care enough about the character to continue talking about him for four fucking threads. And they at least shit on the actual character. You're making whole threads about Sabo and taking offense to any reply defending the anmesia plot as the most plausible explanation. <br><br>So tell me, what is your post complaining about besides 'poor' treatment his character got with the whole canon-to-the-head-amnesia thing? You're making no complaints about his actually character, except for the fact that he got a shitty backstory in your eyes. His explanation doesnt change the character he is today. If you didn't like him in the first place, why do you care so much about his backstory to make another fucking thread after we've already had three beforehand? Why do you want to talk about it so much? Was it really THAT unjustified for Sabo in your eyes? If so, why would it be? Like I said, it's plausible and coherent. You'd only be this upset if you were expecting some kind of God-tier backstory for him, or if your favorite character got shit on. Really, three whole fucking threads of Sabo and still not enough for you? Whether you really dislike him or not, you're still obsessed like a homolust faggot. Getting off on hate-sex is a thing too you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I still feel like Ace's dead actually made him a noteworthy character which was of course crushed by Sabo when he took the Mera Mera. <br>Why exactly? Aces death still had impact to the story and to the development of the main character. Sabo getting the Mera Mera did not change a thing about that.</br></br>  <br><br><br>pls no bully</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, I guess my problem is I'm comparing them to the other Strawhats who have had much more screen time to be fleshed out properly to the point where I've learned to love the ones I originally hated. Usopp being a perfect example.</br>  <br>As I said discuss OP or fuck off, you aren't proving anything with your shitposts<br><br><br>It one of the arguments why everyone was like <br> hurr durr sabo is ace 2.0 <br>Which made me start to feel bad about Ace being mistreated.<br><br><br> tl;dr I wasn't here when one piece came back after the 3-months break and the timeskip started, so I have no clue why people shit on sabo now instead of chopper <br>Good for you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am glad no one will reply seriously to this.<br><br>For real though, all that efford you put into spouting shit at people intentionally and misrepresenting their arguments, why don't you put that into something useful, to have a neat little discussion about the subject matter?</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay dude, what it is you don't understand ?<br>The basic principle is that you can switch the numbers and the x around the = as long as you switch their sign.</br></br>  <br> I don't know if he was forced by his editors or not to make sabo and this was the best he could do. <br>This is what I'm talking about. Why do you do that? Why can't it just have been Oda's decision? Why do you put him on such a high pedestal in the first place? The anmesia cliche is everywhere, not only in shounen manga. It's in novels, tv shows, movies, etc. What makes Oda such a special flake that he should be forbidden from using it? A lot of people acknowledge that anmesia explanation was the best one possible. Seriously, what's so bad about Sabo having amnesia except for the fact that it's been used in other stories and mediums?</br></br>  <br> x - 7 = 19 + x <br>You want to remove the 7 on the left side, but everything you do on one side you also have to do on the other, therefore:<br> x - 7 + 7 = 19 + x +7 <br> x = 26 + x <br> x - x = 26 + x - x <br> 0 = 26 <br> you normally want to isolate x and give it a value, but x can't be itself plus 26 either, so the answer wont make sense either way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dragon pissed <br><br>Damn that's cool</br></br></br>  <br> you aren't proving anything with your shitposts <br>You're getting triggered and your thread becomes shit for half the people here, but most importantly It helps reaching the bump limit faster.</br></br>  <br>Its true, I mean notice how they never offer a better solution than amnesia. They dont give a damn anymore how much it makes sense based on Oda's characterization of their brotherhood. Nope, all that matters is that it wasn't their idea so it's hack.</br>  <br>It is not well connected to the rest of the plot, and essentially makes the character appear from out of nowhere.<br><br>Does it explain the situation? Yes, probably.<br>Is it narratively satisfying? No, not at all.<br><br>And no, Oda is not forbidden from using it, just like he is not immune from being criticized for using it. Stop the double standard.<br><br>We've had days of discussion about this already, give it a rest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. When I read the chapter and read the part with the amnesia I just thought "Ah ok." and went along. I really am baffled sometimes how some people are bothered by the most trivial shit and have to overanalyze everything. This is a fucking kids comic for gods sake. Ah well, maybe it is because there are weeks between new chapters and everything has to be taken apart about every chapter until the next one comes out. People who have the chance to read every chapter right after the next one without breaks do not even think about most of the stuff that is discussed here every week and just enjoy the ride.</br>  <br>Sabo killing Akainu when?</br>  <br><br>Oh right, I got it. Thanks. <br><br>I love this artist but you need to fuck off, you're just as bad as the sabofag.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But it doesn't stop the problems inherent with creating such a character <br>There are no problems with the way he was introduced. You just don't like him.</br></br>  <br> What if Oda's editor also worked on D. Gray Man. </br>  <br> tl;dr I wasn't here when one piece came back after the 3-months break and the timeskip started, so I have no clue why people shit on sabo now instead of chopper <br>I was here, faggot. But, if that's all you've got to say about it, that's cool. Unfortunately for you Sabo will be gone for probably hundreds of chapters before you can suck him off again. I hope another blonde cutie can be introduced to fill the void for you.</br></br>  <br> you're just as bad as the sabofag <br>Abyssus abyssum invocat.</br></br>  <br>Okay good night anon!<br><br><br> I really am baffled sometimes how some people are bothered by the most trivial shit <br>The whole deal about this being discussed online blows it out of proportion. People are not actually that bothered, but conflicting opinions push each other up. When I read the chapter I thought "Well, that was a stupid explanation." and went along. When I posted here that I thought that explanation was stupid, someone else disagreed with me and eplained his view. I explained my view. Several different people did the same.<br><br>And then shitposters picked up on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I was here, faggot. <br>nope if you were you wouldn't suggest like a retard while talking about Brook and Chopper that everyone hating something specific about a character actually love that character which is pretty much retarded just like you.</br></br>  <br> I love this artist but you need to fuck off, you're just as bad as the sabofag. <br><br>Don't be mean to doflanon.</br></br></br>  To counter the shitposting let's rank the Supernovas, Luffy and Zolo excluded.<br> Law&gt;Kid&gt;Bonney=Killer&gt;Hawkins&gt;X Drake&gt;&gt;&gt;Apoo&gt;Blackbeard&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;Urouge&gt;Capone</wbr> </br>  <br><br>Salve abyssus meum antiquum amicum.</br></br>  <br> and then shitposters picked up on it <br>More like OP kept pushing that pointless discussion.</br></br>  Soon, right?<br>He found a poneglyph so he has to come back...right?</br>  This thread took me back to simpler times.<br><br> 300 chapters to introduce a brother <br><br>what naivety</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if its satisfying if theres not much if anything else he could. He showed Luffy not giving a fuck about letting each other live their own lives. If his brothers is about to be killed nothing else matters, not even his own life. Even Ace knew this which is why he told the BB pirates not to tell his brother. <br><br>If you want to have an issue have an issue with another brother being introduced so late, but the amensia is not a problem.</br></br></br>  <br>I love you too Lawlu anon.</br>  <br>I actually agree with your list</br>  <br>BB is a supernova ?<br>Apoo and Drake should be higher, otheriwise that ranking is pretty good.</br></br>  Reminder that it doesn't go away unless you ignore it AND report it.  <br>Yeah, the only reason why he didn't join immediately was because he was too overpowered for the crew and would made a lot of things trivial but now is a good time for him to join the SH.</br>  <br> implying reporting gayposters gets them banned <br>So it doesn't go away.</br></br>  <br> Ace being Rogers son is an asspull <br>Narutards really are the most retarded beings on this earth</br></br>  <br>The thing is Jinbei should be as strong as any member of the worst generation by now making him, Zoro and luffy three guys who could take on pirate captain-tier people in the new world.</br>  <br>Wow thats pretty pathetic that you've spent so long reading a manga you hate just to shit on it. What a sad life.<br><br>I hate fairy tale but it literally didnt take me more than a few arcs to drop it and move on with my life. Maybe because I actually have more fulfilling things in my life than to hate read a manga for years and years.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe in 10 years.<br>Now that I think about you Jinbeifags had it pretty hard. People kept shitting on you for thinking he would join, now he joined, but he didn't get on the Sunny yet, and now there's a distinct possibility he won't get on the boat for years or even that he'll die before he does.</br></br>  <br>Does anyone have the edited version about there being no One Piece chapter this week.</br>  <br>Ah so you were a Narutard back then, this explains a lot actually.</br>  <br>Yeah when he joins the monster trio will probably be expanded into the monster quartet because I don't see him being weaker than sanji after all the stuff he's done.</br>  <br> And no, Oda is not forbidden from using it, just like he is not immune from being criticized for using it. Stop the double standard. <br>I never said he was immune from being criticized. But I was replying to this post<br> Soap opera tier writing. Oda is above that. Or at least the way everyone praises him he should be. <br>Which made it seem like the main reason at least some people are upset is because of the simple usage of the 'cliche' plotline and for some reason 'Oda should be above that'<br><br>And what's the use of criticizing if you don't expect some discussion out of it? That's the whole point of these threads, no? If you're gonna criticize, then people should be allowed to voice their reasoning if they have differing opinions. If you're just sick of this topic all together, it's mostly the people that are criticizing it that keeps bringing this shit up, if you haven't noticed. Not the other way around.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> yfw Jinbei replaces Sanji in the Monster Trio </br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>I just hope Jinbei joins really soon, like in Zou instead of Wano because even if Zou is a 'short' arc it will still probably take 1/2 a year to a year to get through it.</br>    <br> you wouldn't suggest like a retard while talking about Brook and Chopper that everyone hating something specific about a character actually love that character which is pretty much retarded just like you. <br>Except that's not what I was suggesting and I've already explained about 4 times in my previous posts what I was. But that's fine. I didn't expect you to be good at reading comprehension anyway. You've got wavy blonde locks and cravats to think about. I understand.</br></br>  <br>Did Jinbei do what he was planning to do though ? He won't come back unless he's finished with that business of his. Whatever that was.</br>  <br> hurr durr I'm so clever <br>No with all your pointöess replies you are proving yourself to be a manchild, so disappear or talk about OP.<br><br><br>I think Jinbei will probably join after or at the critical part of Wano.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'm pretty sure there was a cover story or something with him finishing his business, something to do with a poneglyph. He's definitely going to be joining in the next arc or the one after that, it's just a matter of 'when' now.</br>  <br>I can't help but think Wano will be boring for some reason. I can't bring myself to care about the likes of Kinemon and Momo. Hopefully Drake will take over as the Law of Wano.</br>  <br>Oda said new nakamas would join "consecutively" or something like that so he'll probably join alongside Kinemon.</br>  So we can finally move on from the amnesia shit? Lets just argue about Sabos character as a whole, because one little thing like amnesia is not worth the endless bitching.  <br> you are proving yourself to be a manchild <br> manchild  <br>Ofcourse I am. I frequent threads about a shounen manga with a rubberman pirate MC. <br><br> hurr durr I'm so clever <br>thanks anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>do you remember where he said that, because I don't remember anything like that</br>  <br>I think he stated it on some interview, not an SBS.</br>  <br> Yeah, I'm pretty sure there was a cover story or something with him finishing his business, something to do with a poneglyph <br>Except that covestory had nothing to do with his business. He just tried bringing Caribou to justice on his way out, lost him, and found himself near an island where ruins rained on. Then he made his own investigation helped the villagers and the sea beasts.<br>We still have no idea what that business of his was.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but it was in an SBS</br>  Where's the anime at right now?  <br> http://opforum.net/showthread.php?<wbr>tid=6501</wbr> <br><br>It's an interview with Oda and he says<br> He also says that more members will join the Straw Hats! "And there will be new nakama, they will show up successively." </br></br></br></br>  <br> Oda said new nakamas would join "consecutively"  <br>At this point I think it's clear he was talking about the colosseum fighters who are going to join Luffy and make up his armada.</br></br>  <br>More like Akainu killing Sabo when?</br>  <br>ah thanks</br>  <br>We need more shota doflacroc.<br><br> what is google <br><br>God no, please not Kinemon. I'd even prefer Bellamy over him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we need more shota doflacroc <br>Okay</br></br>  <br>Again I don't hate it. One piece was the first manga I read and it got me into literally all manga. I am just not one of the people who have to pretend Fishman Island was good or that Sabo having amnesia was great. <br><br>Hajime no Ippo was my favorite manga and I am definitely not above pointing out the formulaic structure of Ippo's fights before. Gonzales. One piece seems to be the only manga where there is a cult of people who cry when a criticism is had. I still don't understand it.</br></br></br>  <br>But wouldn't young croc be a loli?</br>  <br> supernovas <br> Blackbeard but not Caribou or Cavendish <br>What you mean is the Worst Generation, faggot</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, he turned before his tenth especially for us shotacons.</br>  <br>Sorry dude, I don't have a single loli croc in my folder.</br>  <br><br>Anyone have any more edits like this? Not necessarily on the same topic, of course.</br></br>  <br>Wouldn't that be the most anticlimactic way to deal with a furious Yonko. For that reason alone she shouldn't be Lola's mom.</br>  <br>Also just having Lola's card shouldn't put you on someone's good side that you stole candy from and sent a bomb too<br><br> Oh you have my daughter's vivre card? I guess I won't eat you! <br><br>For all she knows they kidnapped Lola and is using her as a hostage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone is going to point at the amnesia as one of Oda's finest work. But it is pretty much the best band-aid on what could have been a glaring plothole. To act like theres a bunch of better things Oda could have done better is foolish, and its not paying attention to how closely Oda wrote the 3 brothers. They would literally die for each other. The only thing that could keep the away from each other is if they didn't remember that bond.<br><br>Also, let's not forget Sabo didnt exist even in Odas head before Marineford. Making it so that he was pseudo-dead all that time is a good way to cover it up. And in a series this long you're bound to get easy fixes like that eventually. Its best not to harp on it and focus on the actual great writing Oda has done.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Although Lola did say on TB to show it to her momma whenever they needed help.</br></br>  <br>It's not like we can expect a man to have an actual fight against a woman at this point in the story. At least not without the fight ending with the woman defecting to their side or fainting. Of course this is the way it gotta be.</br>  <br>Every fandom has a cult of people like that. even Bleach and Fairy tail. I think the big difference between cultfags and casualfags, is that you're either a fan of just the manga, or if you're a fan of the manga and its author. <br><br>OP just seems to have more fans of the author as well, compared to other shounen mangas. So criticism to his work is taken more personally. Especially if the criticism is directed at Oda, like "He's losing his touch", "Oda a hack" "Oda worst mangaka" or just things like "OP sucks now" etc. since it's an attack on Oda's work.<br><br>Seeing how One Piece has been going on for a pretty long time and without too many huge disappointments, there are more OP fans that have faith in the author to tell a good story in the end.<br><br>I'll admit, I suck Oda's dick pretty hard. There are plenty of dips in one piece even before the time-skip, but he always manages to pick it up to impress me either way. That's why for me at least, a slow arc or a cliche plot device isn't going to change my opinion about the series a whole bunch, or be worried about how it'll end up in the future. I trust that he knows what he's doing, and that he knows best which directions he needs to take to tell his story the way he wants to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> to counter the shitposting let's shitpost </br>  <br> mangas <br>fuck. i commited the ultimate taboo. it was an accident i swear.</br></br>  So why are these thread always about Law's sexuality?<br>Do you all want to fuck him or what? <br>I can't wait for the next arc because I rather discuss about Kid's sexuality.</br></br>  <br> Luffy somehow wins Big Mom's affection <br> Big Mom becomes Hancock 2.0 <br>I wouldn't even be mad, actually.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree. Can't wait for Kid to replace Law as 2nd best character in the popularity polls.</br>  <br>Did you even read the thread ?<br>It's mostly Sabo bashing and pointless discussion. There's only one pic of Law.</br></br>  <br> So why are these thread always about Law's sexuality? <br>because there are a load of fujoshits and queers here</br></br>  <br> Do you all want to fuck him or what?  <br>He's my husbando. Of course I do.<br><br>Kid's pansexual.</br></br></br></br>  Do you think Kid wants to be called adult while he's fucking?  <br>Kid clearly will fuck anything as long as he's the one on top. <br><br>The only person he'd let top him is  luffy </br></br></br>  <br>Nah Kidd's dirty straight cis scum who happens to be captain sexual, hence his epithet.</br>  <br> Sabo is shit <br> Sanji is dead <br> Retarded powerlevels  <br> Croco is a girl and Doffy wants to fuck him/her <br> I want to fuck Law <br>This is what these threads are really about.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   lawlu sandwich with kid as the filling <br><br>when</br></br>  <br>Why not discuss both Kid and Law's sexuality. <br>They are OTP after all.</br></br>  <br>It's subtler than that.</br>  <br>Good old times when KidLaw was the most popular Law pairing. I pair Law with a lot of dudes but he still has the best chemistry with Kid.</br>  <br>Sanji is just going to cook her some boss ass food and sweet talk the shit out of her.</br>  <br>ITT: POST SHIT-EATING GRINS</br>  I'm actually really interested on how Luffy and Kid's relationship will develop. I'd imagine them staying as friendly rivals, but for some reason I see Luffy getting annoyed at Kid a lot. Since they have similar ambitions and are direct competition. Luffy will probably think Kid is an idiot too. Kinda like he does with Zoro.  <br> mfw dentist-chan made it to this image before me </br>  <br> Not posting Urouge <br>You're doing it wrong</br></br>  Since I fell asleep last time and it crashed, I'm just going to re-dump Patlabor, a dead scanlation.<br><br> In the near future, large mechs called Labors are made to assist in various reconstruction projects in major countries around the world that are being threatened by global warming. In Japan, the government has enacted Project Babylon in order to conduct land reclamation. Labors are also being pressed into police and military service, aside from civilian use. <br><br> However, terrorists are now attempting to use Labors to make themselves heard, as well as common criminals, thugs and guerrillas. The National Police Agency established the Special Vehicles Division, an all-Labor task force to combat the potential use of Labors for criminal/terrorist activities. <br><br> This title received the 36th Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen manga in 1991. </br></br></br></br></br></br>              Nice.       left to right <br>Whoa.

Aoi has sort of bad fashion sense and I remember her wearing grandma-clothing in the series too, but that might be what the cool kids do nowadays, I don't really know. 3D-tomboy has most normal clothing and it really correlates her being boring in the series.</br>  <br>Or it's just a nice looking dress.<br>Revealing leg is overrated.

I hear it gets filler filled some so what episode does the snime stray, and what chapter does it continue on?  <br>The anime was quite loyal to the original manga in term of main plot. The fillers mostly are adapted from the light novel with some adjustment aside from some characters backstory episodes.<br><br>From episode 65 or so onward, there is no filler. <br><br>TLTR, the anime is decent enough to get into the series, but it's recommended to read the manga from chapter 1 despite having seen the anime.<br><br>Also, Lost fragments of Snow</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> d.gray-man <br> battle shounen <br> loving hoshino dogshit fight crunchy drawing <br>She's talented at making character design, background, comic stuff, or even artistic drawing.

Did Hoshino ever explain why they become like that or is just "stylistic choice don't question it"?</br>  <br>They're black because Hoshino wants to create contrast between Noah and Exorcist.<br><br>This manga is racist as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>Zouken's basement</br>  <br>Because it made Road even more delicious.<br>Also nice contrast between Allen/Nea and the Noah/Earl, plus clowns wear white make-up, so further contrrast between Noah and Mana</br></br>  YES a d-gray man thread, thanks for sacrificing yourself op.<br><br>ok after reading all the d-gray man volumes I've learned quite a lot. but not a lot of questions<br><br> do the Noah assimilate,completely take over their host, or the person becomes the Noah like having amnesia and the person really believes they are this person? <br> so neah had the sword already before dying <br>so Allen's innocence is combination of two with allen being the white and neah being the black?<br> so memories can be implanted? <br> how did mana turn into an akuma if mana is alive <br> how hyped are you for kanda becoming a general? <br> how did past allen get young again <br>im thinking one f two ways, he got young same way the earl turn into two babies or past!allen had a kid and implant his memory, of course it will turn out maybe in the next chapter that both of these are bullshit.<br><br>anybody want to make a collage of all the clues and hints leading up to reveal of allen being noah/14/earl's brother?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she <br>then why does the SJ manga book keep saying he?<br>talk about translation error.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;do the Noah assimilate,completely take over their host, or the person becomes the Noah like having amnesia and the person really believes they are this person? <br>The Noah take over.<br> &gt;so neah had the sword already before dying <br>Yes. He has the same powers as Mana obviously.<br> so Allen's innocence is combination of two with allen being the white and neah being the black? <br>What? Allen's innocence/arm is his and his alone. It's influenced by th 14th because he lives in allen's body.<br> &gt;so memories can be implanted? <br>Probably.<br> &gt;how did mana turn into an akuma if mana is alive <br>No one can prove anything about that yet.<br> &gt;how hyped are you for kanda becoming a general? <br>Pretty hyped. But he will lose his regeneration ability soon, so he'll probably be a jobber.<br> &gt;how did past allen get young again <br>No one knows yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pretty hyped. But he will lose his regeneration ability soon, so he'll probably be a jobber. <br>please no.<br><br>oh another question<br>was apocrypho trying to merge with the innocence or was he taking out the innocence in allens arm so he replace it, cause what he saying or whats he doing looked completely different.<br><br>and anybody else want chaouji get btfo?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> do the Noah assimilate,completely take over their host, or the person becomes the Noah like having amnesia and the person really believes they are this person? <br><br>Aside from Nea (and Allen), Noahs keep their old self with their personality a little bit changed due to Noah's memory. But they have to be be careful not to lose themself to Noah's memory, otherwise, they will become like Mana or awaken Tyki<br><br> so neah had the sword already before dying <br>Yes. Since he, too, is a Millenium Earl himself.<br><br><br> so Allen's innocence is combination of two with allen being the white and neah being the black? <br>Probably not since Nea processes an inverted version of the sword<br><br> so memories can be implanted? <br>Yes. Ask past!Allen how<br><br> how did mana turn into an akuma if mana is alive <br>From an anon earlier <br><br> The original Earl splited into Nea and Mana. One of them would become the Earl and the other one would become the 14th Noah. <br><br> Unfortunately, the soft-hearted Mana was chosen to become the Earl and a part of him gave up to his Noah memory.  <br><br> That part became the Earl, killed Katherina "to make things right". The remaining part of Mana wasn't able to take this and eventually asked Nea to kill him. <br><br> Nea, understanding the fact that killing Mana would save him and his heart, accepted the request but at the end he just couldn't kill his other half. He then took Mana and went on hiding. <br><br> Not long after that, Nea got killed by the Earl. Mana lost himself even more and went full batshit insane. <br><br> To the point of 9 years ago, only an extremely broken piece of Mana that was called Mana Walker was left. This is the Mana that Allen turned into Akuma and destroyed him with his Innocence. <br><br> how hyped are you for kanda becoming a general? <br>I only hype because this creates chances for further reveal of Black Order higher-up. I never care about Kanda that much.<br><br><br> how did past allen get young again <br>The clues head toward Apocryphos related, but we never know if Hoshino is up to something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> was apocrypho trying to merge with the innocence or was he taking out the innocence in allens arm so he replace it, cause what he saying or whats he doing looked completely different. <br>He wanted to merge with allen. Which suggets that either Allen's innocence is the heart or a clue/important devise to get to the heart.</br></br>  well time to re-read D.gray man  <br>Isn't Chaouji already BTFO from his own body? I thought he was being controlled or something.</br>  <br> was apocrypho trying to merge with the innocence or was he taking out the innocence in allens arm so he replace it, cause what he saying or whats he doing looked completely different. <br><br>He want to merge with Allen, not just Crown Clown, which would sucessfully remove Nea, who is also an Earl of Millenium, out of the war and prevent Allen to become a Noah.<br><br>Yes, he is trying to save Allen, in his very own twisted way</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anybody want to make a collage of all the clues and hints leading up to reveal of allen being noah/14/earl's brother? <br><br> hints leading up to reveal of allen being noah/14/earl's brother <br><br> reveal of allen being noah/14/earl's brother <br><br>People had always suspected Allen to be an Noah ever since volume 7. Nea got revealed as the 14th in volume 8. It was obvious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>see now, this why they say don't run after a women when she starts running just cause you think someone is behind you when shes actually running from you. this can perfectly describe allen and apocryho situation. of course its a little more complicated than that but still.<br><br><br> I only hype because this creates chances for further reveal of Black Order higher-up. I never care about Kanda that much. <br>hes had a hard past anon, he needs some love.<br><br> To the point of 9 years ago, only an extremely broken piece of Mana that was called Mana Walker was left. This is the Mana that Allen turned into Akuma and destroyed him with his Innocence. <br>so let me get this straight<br>the earl split into mana and neah and then mana split into mana earl and mana walker?<br>how?<br><br><br><br>yeah but it would be fun to make a collage out of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How much time has passed after the level 4 raided their HQ?<br><br>Apparently Kanda is going to be a general, and that level 4s are fodder by now. Last time I read their was something going on with artificial exorcists.</br></br>  <br> see now, this why they say don't run after a women when she starts running just cause you think someone is behind you when shes actually running from you. this can perfectly describe allen and apocryho situation. of course its a little more complicated than that but still. <br><br>It's more like "I don't want you to die from dehydration, so I will drown you.". That's why Allen runs away from him.<br><br> hes had a hard past anon, he needs some love. <br><br>You know a peaceful death is the most happy ending for any character in this series right? <br><br> so let me get this straight the earl split into mana and neah and then mana split into mana earl and mana walker? how? <br><br>Imagine Mana is water in one bottle labeled "Mana" and there is another bottle labeled "Earl". The more Mana grieves, more water from "Mana" gets poured to "Earl".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How much time has passed after the level 4 raided their HQ? <br><br>Half of a year</br></br></br>  the anime and the invasion in hq made it seem like lvl 4 akuma was liek final boss then after the invasion the noahs just started spamming lvl 4, like what the hell.  so what is koshino gonna be doing in between d-gray man chapters? resting?<br>does anyone feel like this might be the only manga koshino writes?</br>  The level 4 arc happened while the Black Order in deep disadvantage, a level 4 wasn't really that strong  <br>This is the only one.
