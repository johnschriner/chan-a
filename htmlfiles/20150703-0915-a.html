I doubt it's going to be the graduation unless this ends up being 2 cour.</br></br></br>  Let's revisit this and look at what questions it brings up and what it implies. So, first off, this confirms there's a well-funded, government-like organization around. But what's up with the box? Someone obviously collected this stuff, but what criteria did they have for selecting it? There's some random stuff in there. Broken knife, cellphone, wallet, revolver, pen, one of those squeezable food packets, and a toothbrush(?). If they're trying to simply find survivors, a lot of this stuff wouldn't help. Then, look at the helipad. There's only one helicopter we see on the 3 pads that are shown, and we get an outside view that shows that this is a large facility (all the lights are on, so they must not have power problems). But the fact they send one one pilot, with no copilot or crew, AND that he's infected, and that they don't send a second helicopter to search for him when he crashes, shows that they're probably severely limited on both manpower and equipment. Then there's the biggest question: What was their goal? Did they really simply want to save the girls? I've heard people say they were after their medicine, but that theory has some holes. First, they wouldn't have known they had medicine unless they knew that school had it beforehand. And if they did, what stopped them from going there before finding the card with their coordinates? There are three syringes in addition to the one he crushed in the box, which seems like it'd be a bit generous if they were low on supplies, so I don't think it was that. So was it really that they simply wanted to save them or what?  <br>Can the first few picture be red herring? <br><br>Like it was way way in the future/</br></br></br>  <br>It's the same gas mask.</br>  <br>What does the label on the box say?</br>  Who is METAL LEEâ€™s mather???  <br>Impressive.</br>  <br> congrats <br><br>Thanks. It's nothing to be proud of though since anybody with half a brain saw this coming a mile away. It's still funny to think about how some anons kept insisting that Karin was the mom.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but she in particular had no talent among her family. She was born with nothing and was cast out, but worked hard anyway to get where she was until she was recognized to be pretty good, because she identified with that other nerdy kid who was a loser yet kept going.<br><br>Her sister had the natural talent in the family, and her cousin was even greater. Hinata started out as a real zero, but she worked until she was something for sure.</br></br></br>   that feel when the new villain wasn't stronger than Madara <br>Feel so good.</br>  <br>Gai Sensei proved everything</br>  New Side Story?  <br> Rin nowhere to be seen <br> OG Tohsaka Tokiomi representing the household <br>I'm happy.

Kobayashi, a boy who goes to this school, meets genius detective Akechi, who comes to the school to investigate.
