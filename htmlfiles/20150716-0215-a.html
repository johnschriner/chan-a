Bleach<br>Forced cancellation when</br>  Seem like Straighten Up! is here to stay which is fantastic news. Both Lady Justice &amp; Devily Man seem to be bust so Kagamigami might survive longer just because of those two. Other than WT being so low I like these ranking.  Quick reminder: Shonen Jump's end-of-magazine survey only asks which series readers want to see more of, not about the actual quality of the material itself.<br><br>The ultimate goal of a Shonen Jump manga is not to actually be good, but to keep people reading until the next chapter comes out. In other words, to run as long as possible and keep interest along the way.<br><br>Which makes sense. After all, WSJ can't waste money running a series nobody cares about. Essentially, a series only dies when talk about it becomes nonexistant. This puts into perspective how many authors try to keep reader appeal:<br> Oda includes dozens of dangling plot lines, ensuring every reader has at least one conflict they want closure to. He also drags out arcs slightly (see Dressrosa), which helps. <br> Kishimoto used shocking swerves to keep up interest, whether good or bad. While we might think Naruto hyperventilating over Sasuke or cuckday was stupid, but it made you want to read the next chapter. And in the end, that's what mattered. <br> Kubo tries dragging out arcs much like Oda, as well as introducing new characters in the hopes one becomes a fan favorite and people want to see more of them. But his writing isn't interesting enough to let this work. <br> Double Arts was cancelled after only 22 chapters because it really didn't keep people hyped chapter-to-chapter. Sure, it had an ultimate conflict, but I wouldn't say it had anything that gave off the "I HAVE to know what's next" feeling. <br> Komi's next manga, Nisekoi, tries to replicate this feeling through bait-and-switching - introduce interesting characters, make readers empathize with them, and then blueball them for 150+ chapters. Sure, it's horrible, but as long as the otter eats the melon his work is done. <br> Black Clover, after the disaster that was Hungry Joker, tries to be as bland as possible. Readers will either assume the author will introduce some twist that will make BC actually interesting or go full retard. Either way, they still follow it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bleach <br>man. how can you go on so long and then faulter so hard. it's kind of sad really</br></br>  <br>As for Jump Start predictions:<br> Lady Justtits is dead in the water. Not only are superhero comics already blandish, but any tease of fanservice the author can add in will be negated. After all, To Love Ru Darkness has all of that, as well as nipples. NIPPLES. <br> Devilyman is okay, I guess. But when you think about it, the only real plot thread people could possibly want to read for is what the deal is with that little boy. Besides that, it's not really anything special. <br> Straighten Up! has the cutest couple in Shonen Jump. If people are reading chapter to chapter just to see more of that relationship develop, than I guess the author has won. <br> Best Blue is a sports manga, which I usually do not read. No idea what hook those have. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If we are lucky, by chapter 700 like Naruto. But most likely they will let him draw for another 7 years because "Hurdur I have another 10 years worth of plotless plot to go" 3 years ago</br>  <br>Why is Koro-sensei a mudslime in that picture?</br>  <br> Best Blue is a sports manga, which I usually do not read. No idea what hook those have. <br>Usually they have sweaty bishounens that serve as fujobait/ for the girls. Best Blue seems like a winning combination, as they are half naked as well, but it relies on the character designs too. That said Best Blue probably won't sink.</br></br>  <br> No idea what hook those have. <br>Fujoshi.<br>Nothing else need to be said.<br>Even Slam Dunk has a big Fujo fanbase</br></br></br></br>  <br>Elite 10 finally introduced and be relevant is doing wonders.</br>  <br><br>Ah. <br><br>Well, good luck for it, then. Hopefully it's better at pandering to one sex than Justtits and E-Robot.</br></br></br></br>  From the thumbnail, it looks like a dog looking up and smiling, but you can't see the rest of his body.  Black Clover, Straighten Up and Best Blue will probably survive for a long time. I'm okay with this.  <br>I'm really surprised that Straighten up is so high in rankings. I was afraid it will be at the bottom like UBS</br>  <br> 1. Shokugeki no Soma <br> 15. Bleach <br><br>And all is right with the world.</br></br></br></br>  Who is the most overrated Anime studio?  Studios I don't like  They made that Manabi Straight show, didn't they?<br><br>That was a cute series.</br></br>  KyoAni  Actually Sunrise.  KyoAni  SHAFT<br><br>Trash animation but disguised as "style".<br><br>Kinda like Apple in computing world, "It's a feature. :^)"</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nobody cares about Ufotable outside Type Moon stuff.<br><br>  Madhouse or Ghibli </br></br></br></br>  <br>You cant overrate Sunrise, since without Sunrise there would not be modern anime industry in first place.<br><br>Sunrise, Toei and TMS ARE the anime. The rest are small parazites eating the food remainders of sharks.</br></br></br>  <br>   Ghibli <br>Nigga, I will cut you</br></br>  Trigger. This entire board was seriously saying they would save anime for months on end.  <br>Its a meme, is not supposed to be taken seriously. Of course everyone knows Yamakan is the only true savior of anime.</br>  <br> damage control <br>Just admit you were wrong about KlK being amazing.</br></br>  <br> Its a meme <br>sure faggot</br></br>  <br>shaft, they are horrible outside fanservise remains</br>  <br> Madhouse <br>They're done some garbage but it's hard to ignore all the good stuff they've made too.</br></br>    pa works  <br><br>Actually taking something like "saving anime" (What does anime need saving from to begin with?<br>How can a single show save anything?) seriously is retarded. <br>I'm seriously surprised anyone remotely intelligent can think "saving anime" is anything more than a joke</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean to quote you<br>I wanted to quote </br></br>  <br> nobody cares about Ufotable outside Type Moon stuff <br>Then why is God Eater getting so much shitposting if nobody cares because it's not TM? Doesn't all the shitpsting mean people care about Ufotable outside TM adaptations?<br>Because GE is an adaptation of a videogame by Bandai Namco</br></br></br>  <br>that sounds overrated</br>  Kyoani or Shaft  Pretty much Shaft. They just produce shit and some faggots pretend it's deep.  I'd say Trigger, people suck their dicks constantly but really the only truly notable thing they've done is LWA. Not saying their other stuff is bad - I'm a fan - but it's not enough to warrant the dick riding. <br><br><br><br><br>Say what you will about the shows themselves, but for those who like them KyoAni delivers with an exceptionally high standard of quality.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but KyoAni fans never approach it like how you're describing. They consistently posture those shows as the best of the season. That implies that the studio makes the best shows and they don't, anymore at least.</br>  Studio Ghibli  <br>TRIGGER, GAINAX and SHAFT.</br>    <br>I'll forgive madhouse pretty much anything for their work on the Satoshi Kon movies.</br>  <br>Thread over</br>  Kyoani<br><br>Same show again and again. Same faces again and again.<br><br>Garbage studio for plebs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Becuase it is a fact that every signle KyoAni show except for 2 of them were AOTS if not AOTY. There is no need to beat around the bush when you are stating facts.</br>  <br>Honestly I think they deserve the praise they get.</br>  <br> Boring CGDCT SOLcrap <br> AOTS or even AOTY <br>Hilarious. <br>They're shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, yeah they constantly make my favourite shows for whatever season they're in, so I'd say they make some of the best. <br><br><br>As far as highly praised studios go, I think Ghibli most deserves it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but for those who like them KyoAni delivers with an exceptionally high standard of quality </br>  <br>Sure if you're a /v/ermin you won't like CGDCT. But anon KyoAni didn't only do that. They had Key, Haruhi and Free. All objective AOTS.</br>  <br>Your new is showing tbh</br>  <br> tbh <br><br>Kill yourself and then take your corpse back to /sp/</br></br></br>  <br>You think I care what a /v/ermin says? It is an undoutable undeniable fact that every KyoAni show is AOTS when it airs. If you want to say no give an example shitposter-kun.</br>  <br>Is that even an /sp/ thing? I see it on /int/ more often than any other board  tbh </br>  <br>Thought it was a /mu/ and /p/ meme  tbh. </br>  <br>tbh I thought it was /mu/</br>  <br><br>You really need to pick up your game m8</br></br>  Ufotable<br>Shaft<br>Trigger<br>Modern Gainax</br></br></br>  Kyoani make some pretty decent stuff but they always play it too safe and just stick to doing really similar series. I like them but I wish they would try something different.    <br><br>Kyoani  tbh </br></br>  <br>You know KyoAni wouldn't include 30 sec stills don't you? And be honest.</br>  <br>While I really do love most of their shows, that's a reasonable criticism. They're clearly a technically talented studio, so I'd love to see them branch out a bit.</br>  <br>They did with KnK and it sold nearly nothing. It is clear that their fanbase wants one thing from them.</br>  <br>They would use lights moving arround and show somthing blurry in the background</br>  <br>In real life? Ghibli and Pierrot. On the anime portions of the web? KyoAni and ufo. Maybe Trigger, but at this point there's so much baiting from both sides that I can't even tell what anyone actually thinks about Trigger anymore.</br>  <br>You say that, but KnK was also one of their weakest shows. They need to try something new + have it be good to know whether or not it'll sell.</br>  <br> Trigger is a meme. Trigger niggers were a reality back when LWA aired and everyone thought they were good. Years later and neo-Gainax is doing better shows than those who have left. <br><br>And it would look better than anything PA or Silver Link ever produced.</br></br></br>  Why do so many people rush to defend Kyoani the second anyone makes fun of it?  <br>Because KyoAni is literally the best studio in the industry. Only plebs can have a bad opinion on based Kyoto Animation.</br>  <br>I like KyoAni.</br>  <br>I'd say PA's best stuff generally looks better than KyoAni's aesthetically (KyoAni wins animation).<br><br><br>People rush to defend almost any studio if it gets made fun of.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck Satelight</br>  <br>I don't know anon. NagiAsu had amazing backgrounds but nothing they made looks as good as Hyouka.</br>  <br>Then tell me, why do people shitpost about decent studios?</br>  A1  <br>Uchoten Kazoku was gorgeous.<br><br><br>Because people rush to defend it the second anyone makes fun of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They made a few memorable anime that happens to be some people's favorites, such as K-On or Haruhi. So they get really defensive when you criticize the studio.<br>Some of the things they make are good (K-On, Nichijou, Tamako, Amagi) while some are terrible (Air, Kanon, Hibike) just like any other studio.</br></br>  <br>Why do people shitpost about decent anime?</br>  <br>Because of their obvious flaws</br>   anyone saying Trigger <br>Trigger has a very niche fanbase. If anything, its vastly underrated.<br>They also saved anime.</br></br>  <br> Kanon <br> Air <br> Bad <br>Are you sure you're not talking about the movies anon? Because they were some really nice adaptations.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll bite; Euphonium was hardly a masterpiece but it was certainly good. What makes you say it was terrible?</br>  <br> This is what Trigger Niggers actually believe. <br>How can you be so stupid and retarded?</br></br>  <br>Kekkai Sensen&gt; Euphonium<br>Garo&gt;Amagi</br></br>  <br>Did people like them? I thought they were pretty terrible. Maybe I was expecting too much since I watched Clannad first.</br>  <br>I haven't been on /v/, and I hate CGDCT SOLcrap<br>Stop forcing your boogeyman<br>And I'm <br>I was just replying to another part of your post</br></br></br></br>  Kouen getting NTRd  <br>aww shit Hakuei. You probably have no idea on how much you fucked up.</br>  The haku siblings are Sinbad bitches now   Subject as name <br>OP never learns.</br>    <br>Alibaba feels insignificant.</br>  <br>I can't see how he could change the situation, fighting for Kou? it woudn't make sense</br>  <br>Didn't Hakuryu just kill Alibaba? I smell a unhappy general in Sinbad's army</br>  <br>There should be quite a few unhappy generals in Sinbad's army</br>  Hakuei best onee-san now<br><br>And by betraying Kouen she probably retains her christmas cake status<br><br>It's a win however I look at it</br></br></br></br>  Fucking traitor slut  <br>Nah, Alibaba betrayed them, some of the kings from the SSA don't have a good relationship with the generals either</br>  <br>she's trying to save her Ototo anon</br>  <br>Is shitposting all you can do now, Ren Kouen?</br>  <br>What I mean is, Alibaba isn't like a protagonist. He has very little impact on the story, unlike Aladin.</br>  At this point, can Mu, Ignatus, Nerva and the Fanalis corps equal the equation?  Friendly reminder there is no chapter next week.  <br>Just you wait until Alibaba is elected president of the world.<br><br>Then you will see. You will all see!</br></br></br>  <br>not really, it also doesn't make sense for Reim to side with Kou, they said they wanted to asimilate them in the summit.</br>  <br> Dat sadness <br> He wanted to destroy Kouen with his Edge Bro <br>Aladdin ruins everything.</br></br></br>  <br>Sinbad always neutralises Haku's edge</br>  <br> Siding with the Sasuke </br>  <br>Man, Sinbad looks molester as fuck there.<br><br>I'm happy Hakuei betrayed Kouen, but sad she isn't getting her bitch on.<br><br>Why can't she be more like her mother?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gyokuen will burst out of someone's chest soon enough, anon</br>  <br><br>You are an unfunny guy.</br></br>  <br> implying <br>He went there to talk, Haku just had to make a soap-opera of the situation.</br></br>   Sinbad no bouken OVA 5 comes out today. <br>Hope it gets online soon.</br>  <br>what? Alibaba was Kouen subordinate and said he was going to fight against Sinbad</br>  <br>Because he had no choice. Also Sinbad was being a manioulative dick to fish princess, so I hope he dies hated by all his genrals and with a erectile dysfunction.</br>  <br>Did hatsuyuki translate ova 4?</br>  <br>True, but it doesn't really change him having to fight Hakuryuu. <br><br>Given the choice between having to fight Alibaba right there and having to fight him when backed by an entire army, well, it makes sense Hakuryuu would choose the former.</br></br></br>  <br>oh you are a koufag</br>  <br>No but JnMBS is translating it right now.</br>  <br>I don't particulary care for Kou. To be honest I just like seeing Hakuryu getting fucked and Sinbad denied me of that. Other han that I'm fine with Sindria as a whole.</br>  <br> To be honest I just like seeing Hakuryu getting fucked and Sinbad denied me of that <br>Actually, no, Hakuryuu pride was destroyed thanks to Sinbad.</br></br>  <br>Eh, I will probably wait until all 5 are done and watch them in single sitting.</br>  <br>I always thought that Alibaba would have the become a third force of his own to counter both the SSA and Kou, but who would even join him at this point?</br>  <br>The damned and lost, obviously</br>  <br> but who would even join him at this point? <br><br>America or Europe can join Alibaba.</br></br></br>  <br>Alibaba is going to conquer the Dark Continent, everybody is going to be fuck.</br>  <br> Alibaba <br> Third force <br> Ever <br>He's just be Aladdin's sidekick after Sinbad goes full David and everyone has to team up to stop him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alibaba's soul is unique.<br><br>Everyone else who died has moeblob souls while Alibaba's soul has a clearly defined shape.</br></br></br>  <br>Cactuars can never be leaders anon.<br><br>No matter how much we wish otherwise.</br></br></br>  This is the only recorded instance of NTR that I can appreciate. Didn't expect Hakuei to have the balls to do this.  Can someone explain why Sinbad's backing Hakuryuu up? What does he have to gain from this? I think i'm missing something.  Can someone just up date me on what's happening because I've miss like five chapters and don't feel like going to read them. I just really need to know who's on who team  <br><br>He gets rid of one side of the Kou Empire and the other side is his puppet.</br></br>  <br>Alibaba is a king candidate who's trying to be a nice person for a change. Every other candidate is a type of narcissistic sociopath. Alibaba on the other hand is a sensible person who genuinely wants to help the people to help themselves.<br><br>Just you wait, he's going to revolutionize the world by the end of this manga.</br></br></br>  <br> Just you wait, he's going to revolutionize the world by the end of this manga <br>yes, because he's the MC best friend</br></br>  <br>Alibaba makes the series worst when ever he shows up, I will say him going to a distant planet was the best thing to happen to the series since the creation of Aladdin</br>  <br>Because fuck Kouen.<br><br>In the long and short term, Kouen is way more dangerous than Hakuryuu.<br><br>Especially since Hakuryuu doesn't have Judar anymore. <br><br>With this, he eliminates a guy with three metal vessels and his two brothers who also have metal vessels. Kou is then left with two metal vessels and maybe Kougyokou in addition to having to follow SSA rules, making it way less of a threat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> there are still people reading this manga who don't realize Alibaba is the MC </br>  <br><br>Thanks, that makes a lot of sense.</br></br>  <br> I hate the voice of reason and love mary sues. <br>If there's nobody trying to be sensible then it's not a realistic depiction of politics. It makes sense that Alibaba's methods haven't been effective so far but in the long run if he can stay alive he'll win.</br></br>  <br>Proletariat will rise! Glory to the working man! Down with the kings! Democracy baby!<br><br>Alibaba is the ultimate american communist.</br></br></br>  <br>emm, no, Aladdin is</br>  <br> I don't know what a mary sue is </br>  <br>how is Alibaba the voice of reason? are you trolling?</br>  <br><br> What are dual protagonists? <br>Both Aladdin and Alibaba share the MC role.</br></br></br>  <br>he's the deuteragonist</br>  <br>He never at any point endorsed a democracy. He endorsed a Republic.</br>  <br>No Hakuryuu is the deuteragonist.</br>  <br>Irrelevant details to think after the revolution.</br>  <br>It's not irrelevant at all. They're completely different systems of government.</br>  <br>Democracy is a republican form of goverment, isn't it.</br>  <br>not really</br>  <br>Never actually thought Hakuei would do something like this for her brother.<br>Kouen Koumei BTFO<br><br>I can start liking her now. Thank you based Ohtaka</br></br></br></br>  Sinbad is a douche.  <br>yeah, he should just let Kou invade Sindria</br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3895189482<wbr>?fr=frs<br>chapter is out in ching chong</br></wbr>  <br>Bro alibaba is the voice of beta man everywhere, he cries because he doesn't have a bitch, he gives up his country and then cries for it back, he followed a evil nigga who betrayed because he was beta, he let Prince zuko basically kill him and the list just keeps going on</br>  <br>Delicious catgirl.<br> More spacebros incoming. <br>Fuck yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck the war. Look at them.</br>  <br>I guess the fact that the focus shifted back onto Spacebros means we get what we saw. Kou is gonna get rekt with no sudden surprises</br>  <br>I'm guess that and a Gary Stu is just a character who's just the shit, like he or she is the main character ex:soma from food wars. But aye I could be wrong</br>  <br>No fuck you.</br>  <br><br>Let's agree and fuck Kouha.</br></br>  <br>Please don't bully the cutest Kou!</br>    <br>When I say "fuck Kouha" I mean it in the most gentle and tender way possible.</br>  <br><br>Oh come on another bitch for Sinbad to fuck? Like he didn't have enough.</br></br>  <br><br>What happened to her scar?</br></br>  <br>Ohtaka probably forgot to draw it.</br>  <br>Sinbad healed it with his dick.</br>  <br> Kouensfacewhen </br>  <br>man i want to see his reaction so badly</br>  <br>Broken Hakuei looks delicious.</br>  <br> Can only save people by whoring herself out <br><br>Why didn't she just whore herself out to Arba?</br></br></br>  <br>dat chest</br>  <br> Kouen getting NTRd <br>wut?</br></br>  <br>This actually looks like NTR<br>Based Sinbad</br></br>  <br>Sinbad: What's up<br>Kouen: Huh!!!</br></br>  <br><br><br>You people really don't realize what the roles are in Magi?<br><br>Ok let me explain. <br>When Alibaba and Aladdin are together Alibaba takes 1st place. Why would that be? <br>Because of the simple reason that that is EXACTLY what the place the King is supposed to have. <br>When they are together Aladdin is there to back Alibaba up, the Magi is there to guide and follow the King. <br>You can't tell that much the story clearly takes focus on Alibaba.<br><br>When they go separate ways Alibaba takes a shorter arc focused on him and Aladdin takes the biggest arc and most of the protagonism. Same thing I put up there :It's not much of a difference either but you can tell the story focuses a bit more in Aladdin. <br><br>It's like faggots that hate a character refuse to believe he's important to the story, it's like you blind yourselves because "I don't like this character!!!".<br><br>tl;dr Alibaba takes protagonism when he's with Aladdin and Aladdin takes protagonism when they go separate ways.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Page shows Hakuei going over to Sinbad's side.</br></br>  <br>Because Arba only likes guys she can marry to control their empire before killing them.<br><br>And Hakuryuu who is obviously part of her plan to have the best hate sex ever,</br></br></br>  <br>I like both Kouen and Sinbad (I like Sinbad more) but damn this really feels like NTR and it pisses me off. <br><br>Really Ohtaka? Did Hakuei really have to do that face?<br><br>Now that I think about it, no joke. Is that really Hakuei? She doesn't have the scar in any of the pages posted </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Alibaba takes protagonism when he's with Aladdin <br>not really</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's Yamuraiha in a wig. She's not in the group shot is she?</br>  <br> Really Ohtaka? Did Hakuei really have to do that face? <br>It makes my dick hard so yes.<br><br>All my yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He kind of does though. Obviously Aladdin is more powerful but Alibaba calls all the shots and is the clear leader of their group. Hell, as soon as Alibaba dropped out of the picture Aladdin became depressed and irrelevant.</br>  <br>Ohtaka forgot to draw Kouen's goatee a couple of times</br>  <br>Technically, he does.<br><br>The problem is the Aladdin is noticeably the more successful of the two which makes him look worse. <br><br>Especially when added to the Alibaba suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He does. <br>He takes the lead and he's the one that pushes everyone up. <br><br>Alibaba is Shonen MC that makes everyone "believe" in him. Aladdin is drawn by Alibaba because of this and he states it many times.<br><br>Also just read the fucking manga without Bias</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does Ohtaka hate this Hakuei/Arba of design? They are all sluts holy shit.  <br>I thought this was obvious<br><br>For some reason, a lot of people love either Alibaba or Aladdin, but rarely both, so they tend to ignore the dynamic</br></br></br>  <br>Hakuei hasn't done anything deserving to call her a slut you fuckboi</br>  <br>She is already fucking Sinbad.</br>  <br>No she's not. <br>She wants to fuck Aladdin</br></br>  I think this is the sexiest thing that came out of Magi.<br>This incest felt so wrong but so right at the same time<br><br>Also when is Anime coming back? Next year? the other?</br></br></br>  <br>Anime will come after Sword Art Online Season 4.<br><br>Obviously.<br><br>Also, you have excellent taste.</br></br></br></br></br>   tumblr   <br> She wants to fuck Aladdin <br>Nah that ended when she fucked Kouen. Like mother she is a fucking slut.</br></br>  <br>She didn't fuck Kouen tho</br>  <br>You can't be this dense.</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Kogyoku acting jealous of her onii-sama doesn't mean they were fucking around. It was never even implied, not even once.<br><br>I mean if you're going to post things at least make sure they're canon not your fanfiction.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You guys are okay, you know that.<br><br>That chapter was one of the best of Magi.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Alibaba calls all the shots and is the clear leader of their group <br>tell me, how much aladdin has helped Alibaba to be a king? not much, in fact a couple of chapters ago, people were comparing Judal and Aladdin saying that he was a shit magi and that Alibaba looked more like a follower than Aladdin while it should be the other way around. <br>I think both Aladdin and Alibaba are equals , none of them really leads ,Alibaba is just a more generic MC, he's also older, so people assume he's the leader of the group which i don't think it's the case.</br></br></br>  <br>I was seriously asking if there were news. <br><br>The entire fight was amazing</br></br></br>  <br>You seriously are unable to realize that Alibaba is the one that gets protagonism when they're together? <br>Jesus christ read the fucking manga.<br><br>The fact that Alibaba is not a good king doesn't mean anything. We're talking about the 2 of them here. <br>Aladdin is not doing his part as a Magi well do Alibaba doesn't make his part as a King well either. It's pretty obvious they both need to improve in that sense but that doesn't change the fact that Aladdin follows Alibaba's steps, he himself says so several times</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>None yet sadly. <br><br>As it is now, they probably have enough material for a season, but no announcements yet. Would have been nice if they announced something after the Sinbad OVA was released but no such luck.</br></br></br>  <br> Jesus christ read the fucking manga. <br> When someone doesn't agree with my opinion it means they don't read the manga <br><br>Oh, You are one of those</br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally I hope they don't do a new season until next year.</br>  <br>The 2nd season had some of the worst animation i have seen in recent years.</br>  <br>The first few minutes were pretty cool though.</br>  <br>But what about the giant blue breasts?</br>  <br>By who though?</br>  <br>Nobody because she wasn't with him in the first place. <br><br>This seems live /v/ screaming "cuck cuck" every second.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Sinbad the only one smiling?</br>  <br> Wasn't with him <br><br>Right. And Sinbad's a virgin.</br></br></br>  <br>The same reason why people still like alibaba, nobody knows</br>  <br> Siding with suffering </br>  <br>because he's fucked up in the head</br>  <br>Because Alibaba did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Well yeah...</br>  <br>Because he's a douche and he's about to becoming the leader of most of the world. <br><br>The others are probably more than a little annoyed at having to team up with the guy who killed Alibaba.</br></br></br>  <br>Besides be a super moralsfag, a terrible king candidate and crybaby. Now tell me again how he did nothing wrong</br>  <br>Show me proof that she ever was together with kouen. <br><br>Like I said to the other anon. If you want to post stuff at least provide evidence, not your headcanon</br></br></br>  <br>that's not even the reason why he fell into depravity, nigga had a hard life<br><br><br>Alibaba joined Kou, he might appear in any minute to fight against them<br><br><br>I thought NTR meant "taking away your loved oenes" or something like that, if that's the case, this is indeed NTR</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can someone sink this ship already? I'm tired of having false hope.  <br>No.<br><br>Alibaba will have Morgiana and Kogyoku eots</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because he literally did nothing and still got shat on. It is to imply he does things wrong all the time but because he didn't actually follow through with his actions it is to say he did nothing at all. <br><br> Sinbad stole Fog Troupe from Alibaba and had Cassam loose his trust. <br> Allowed himself to be taken by the darkness and did not want to escape from it.  <br> Lost his authority of main diplomatic contributor of his kingdom by running away after shit went down.  <br> Actually got attacted by fish princess from Kou that wanted to destroy Balabad if negotiations had it her way. <br> Cucked himself when he went for the Mor route but instantly pulled out when a sent of master X servant started to blow. (She still like him though)  <br> Got cucked onna ship when he had a years chance of hitching up with the Coliseum girl. <br> Failed to stop Haku. <br><br>Beta 4 Lyfe</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Believe anon. <br><br>Believe!</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah he may come any minute but then again I could say he could actually become a alpha soon but we know both of these are lies</br>  <br> nigga had a hard life <br><br>Taking care of mother who loves you until she died =/= Being forced to love a person like a mother in an obedient and respectful way or get punished daily.<br><br>Everyone has a breaking point. That is why this Sinbad arc we get Finalist kid as supporting role.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is Sinbad slowly become evil?  <br>dickgoeshere.jpg</br>  <br>Why? It has been proven time and time again that it doesn't matter if they have better chemistry or who's best girl.<br><br>All that matter is the author is a Morgfag and their ship already has the endgame flags raised.</br></br></br>  <br> got fooled not once but twice by the same person <br>  gave a beta answer for why he joined the fit troupe  <br>  cried his ass off because no bitch wanted him and cried mor into a force confession  <br>  hasn't done anything note worthy  <br>  always in Aladdin  <br> after abandoning his throne now cries about wanting it back <br>  for into a marriage and unwanted partnership <br> not just failed to save haku but but lost to him and basically died while only getting some legs  <br><br>The beta is strong in him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek koumei's btfo face</br>  <br> middle east <br> not having more than 1 wife </br></br>  <br>It's like you aren't reading manga at all, Alibaba said he won't have harem like his father.</br>  Oh boy I bet the nips ain't taking this well since most of them ship kouken. And hacked<br><br>This just proves that sinbad the best character in this show. Dude just raking up kou princesses also the Princess from his spinoff</br></br>  <br>Based SinBAD</br>  <br> the episode where they became friends <br>THANK YOU A-1 FOR PUTTING SOME EFFORT INTO IT</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate Aladdin and Alibaba</br>  I hate and love mindbroken Sinbad at the same time. Wat do?  <br>Your kind is the worst</br>  <br>Ohtaka shouldn't have pussied out just because Sheba became her daughteru, she should have stuck to the original plan of making Sheba both Aladdin's mother and the final boss Gyokuen instead of making the meat-puppet Arba into the bad guy</br>  <br> /v/ <br><br>On /co/ they attribute "cuck" to /pol/<br><br>In reality it is a /tv/ meme, it has always been a /tv/ meme</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can, if they join Kouen side, it will get 2 magi, which is a tremendous power.</br>  <br> Not what happened to her mole. <br><br>Such quality</br></br></br>  My fear that Kougyokuâll end up being the one literally backstabbing Kouen when Sinbad uses her is ever growing.<br><br>I don't think I'm ready for that level of suffering for her.</br></br>  And you made fun of me when I've said that everyone would be on Hakuryuu' side and that Hakuei would betray without being Arba. I also was right that Hakuei was doing negotiations with other countries and that's why she wasn't showing in any Kou meetings. If would have know about it, he would lock Hakei in the basement.  <br>Ohtaka recently forgets to draw it. It's not the first time that happens.</br>  <br>You are going to see Aladdin and Alibaba saving Hakuryuu from Kouen trying to kill him. Judar wouldn't let Kouen to kill Hakuryuu and Alibaba wouldn't let to kill Hakuryuu too. Aladdin wouldn't let to kill Hakuryuu too.</br>  <br> Alibaba joined Kou, he might appear in any minute to fight against them <br>I doubt that he would fight. Alibaba would make a diplomatic choice and save Hakuryuu and Kouen killing each other.</br></br>   early chapters of this manga <br> think its a adventure manga it a little bit of drama, but mostly dungeoneering and fun times <br> it turns full edge, darkness and suffering <br><br>god fucking dammit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kou siblings btfo. Kouen Koumei NTRd kek</br>  I have a feeling that Al-Tharmen might have altered Kouen's body. They supported him.<br><br>When I read the David's passage about true singularity. I get a sense that it's talking about Illah's revival - that reborn Illah is a true singularity. Since no on is pregnant, I think it's magi rebirth.</br></br>  <br>My name is Sinbad, and I hate every single one of you.</br>  <br> she stopped being an ungrateful cunt </br>  <br>It's a fetish not a meme, idiot.</br>  <br> tfw Hakuei can finally be my waifu <br>I've been waiting.</br></br>  <br> hating on best boy <br><br>what are you, a faggot?</br></br></br>  <br>That's really sad.</br>  <br> hating on shota Gary Jesus. <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br> he would lock Hakei in the basement. </br>  <br>  Hakuei was doing negotiations with other countries and that's why she wasn't showing in any Kou meetings. <br><br>Really Best Woman, isn't she?</br></br></br>  is it really a coincidence?  <br>It's a coincidence. Kouen always has a disappearing beard.</br>  <br>Ohtaka has been known to forget important details lots of times.<br>Hakuei hasn't appeared for like a 100 chapters or so. <br><br>Even if we assume it's deliberate, the only explanation is Arbakuei. But then I don't see her stabbing the fuck out of Sinbad who's standing right next to her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least it's not the embarrassing edgy, anon.</br>  <br>Except Judar was so embarrassing edgy Ohtaka herself made fun of him.</br>  <br><br>It's a ruse. Just wait for the reveal and kouen's smug face.</br></br>  <br>His voice was so annying in S1. For some reason he was much more tolerable in S2.</br>  <br>What if KouEn knew about her betrayal and prepared a magical nuke inside Hakuei that would kill everyone within one km so that he gets rid of SimBad?</br>    <br>THE ROSE</br>  <br> I don't know what a Gary sues is </br>  <br>But I know. And It's Gary "Stue" not "Sue".</br>  <br>You obviously don't if you think Aladdin is one.</br>  Whole chapter:<br>http://mh.dmzj.com/magi/40782.shtml<wbr></wbr></br>  M8s, I don't see Alibaba joining the fray at all. Him and Judar will likely return long after the war ends.  <br>same. They may return right after war ends or long after the war ends. Unless Ohtaka wants to make their come back a huge turn off and let them "return in time"</br>  So is this the end of edge master Hakuryuu or will Judar make it in time to turn the tides around?  <br>I mean unless they can get back right this second it looks SSA and Kou are going to wipe each other out. Before it was an assured victory but now it's going to be a long hard fought battle with many casualties.<br><br>Shame Alibaba isn't there. His forces could easily turn the tides of battle one way or the other. He could essential decide the winner of the war if he wanted to.</br></br></br>  <br>  wipe each other out <br><br>Are you retarded? SSA is going to crush Kou.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, maybe if the SSA deployed all of their forces at once they could do it as of right now they're merely forcing Kouen to fight seriously until the last man standing.</br>  <br>I am going with return right at the end of the war but they don't have time to act at all because everything has been decided. Or right after the war. <br><br>I wouldn't mind if they come back after a few weeks/months but we will need flashbacks of what happened during that time if Ohtaka gives them the spotlight of how they returned. If she goes with the war, we will still need flashbacks of how our space duo made its comeback and who won the war etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn I forgot to delete the name, sorry pals.</br>  <br>  Sinbad, Armakan and Mira  <br>  8 Generals and Armakan/Mira assimiliated household members <br><br>Versus <br><br>  Kouen  <br>  2 of his remaining household members <br><br>Tell me again how that isn't incredibly one sided? And I'm being kind here by excluding Hakuei.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if this is possible, but count Aladdin at Kouen's side. I still don't find a reason why he would help him, but we should count all possibilites.</br>  <br> Also just read the fucking manga without Bias <br>That's literally impossible.</br></br>  <br> I still don't find a reason why he would help him <br> the most hlarious thing is if that happens the author will try to convince us that he's doing the right thing</br></br>  <br>dat ass</br>  <br>You're an idiot if you think Alibaba is a Mary Sue/Gary Stu. <br><br>He's fucked up so many times and almost every main player in the story looks down on him.</br></br></br>  <br> shit reading comprehension </br>  Jafar looks pissed  <br>Who's the overall strongest of the 8 Generals?</br>  <br>probably Drakon</br>  <br>she even forgot the spot on her face.<br>And that the most important gene in her family</br></br>  Deku!!!!!!  I am fucking full mast right now  <br> Deku manages to hold up against Stain but slips <br> Ida uses his body to shield Deku and is RIP to pepperoni </br></br>  <br>It's funny how his hair looks so much better in mid-action than it is when he's just standing around.</br>  I am hyperventillating right now, are there more pictures?   Ida doesn't fuck Stain up. <br>Oh come on.</br>  <br>If Stain doesn't fuck iida and deku just to get fucked by gran torino afterwards, I'll be mad</br>  <br>Oh shit this is going to be a great chapter.</br>  Wait, that text in the right bottom corner.... this will be the last panel, right? Still, hype as fuck! I wonder how Deku will find them and how effed Iida might be.  I love this pacing, no chapter disappoints  My dick is on my hand right now. Fucking hyped.  <br>Smash without hurting his hand... <br> true hero Deku vs true villain Stain <br><br>So hype</br></br></br></br>  Cover and color pages next week  <br> Guy who barely lasted over 3 seconds against Todoroki <br> Not getting shat on by Stain </br></br>  This manga here is the reborn of Shonen.<br><br>So hyped, so well-paced, so MIGHTY.</br></br>  <br><br>Is it just me, or does Horikoshi have relatively good pacing for a shounen battle manga?</br></br>  <br> Boku no Hero Academia thread <br>Are you mentally challenged?</br></br>  <br>This will only matter if<br><br> The series has a satisfying end <br> It actually lasts for awhile and doesn't finish up in 99 chapters </br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit.<br>Forgot to take that out from yesterday.<br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice trips. Now check mine.</br>  <br>Seeing as how the story is about Deku becoming the number 1 Hero, and still having at least 2 years at school. I don't see it ending anytime soon.</br>  <br>The pacing is one of it's strongest points by far, can't really think of a shounen with better pacing at the moment. But then again it's still on only 50 chapters. Most shounen fuck up their pacing later down the line.</br>  <br>So you're the newfag from Reddit who won't stop making threads.

You can have lots of power and still be less feared and less notorious than someone who is an active psychopath on a mission.<br><br>My guess is Stain is an ambush predator who kills off people one at a time, maybe two (like how he paralysed Mist and then physically attacked Hands), who goes after mainly less powerful or mediocre heroes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Stain has a normal human body with no enhanced strength or durability <br> can survive being punched with OfA in face just because he is strong <br>Powerlevels are already off the charts, it all started when Todoroki was able to survive being punched with OfA in guts and didn't even bleed. Not long until villains will take hundreds of 100% OfA punches.</br></br></br>  <br>Stain will see that Deku is a true hero in the making, then forgive their lifes. <br><br>ThatÂ´s said, if the full 5% mode doesnt work, he will use the 100% kamizake attacks as last choice.</br></br></br>  <br>Stain was prepared to face AM in his first appearance, so I'm sure he could handle Deku.</br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br><br>He can always go crazy mode again but yes, now he will be more calm before going to fight someone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself you underage piece of shit</br>  <br><br><br>You are legitimately autistic.</br></br></br>  <br>samefag</br>  <br>Kacchan calm down</br>    <br>If Batman/Superman can get angry, then chances are we are getting to see a legitimately pissed Deku.

Wonder who it is.</br></br></br>  <br> nearby upperclassman <br>it's seria</br></br>  <br>It'd be awesome if he kept the coat</br>  <br>He does like busty onee-sans</br>  <br>you are implying it wasnÂ´t foreshadowed.<br>NT6:Reminder Magic god can mean Demon Lord:<br> Say there is a power that could defeat the demon king who ruled over evil. <br> The hero who possessed that power would likely be happy. <br> But not because he (or she) had been born with a special power. <br> It would be because he knows what his power is for and the world around him is widely <br> aware of that fact. <br> Therefore, he would always know what path to take. No matter how powerful the demon <br> king may be, he would never have to fear him. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Index</br>  <br> Seria keeps trying to have Touma come onto to her, and even goes for lucky pervert events and fucks them up <br>Manga ruins lucky pervert events. The saddest fukou da is the fukou da you never even realize.</br></br>   Aogami Pierce isn't 6 but is the Observer <br> He is ALWAYS within 10 meters of Touma <br>Now i want to know that the hell is an ovserver and who is the real 6</br></br>  <br>Nope. Don't pick this back up.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure that was foreshadowing Thor's powers and not heros and demon lords</br>  <br> she's practically begging him to take her <br> he's too focused on the love letter to notice, and he probably wouldn't notice even if that weren't happening <br>He deserves that fucking mummy</br></br></br>  <br>It's a blessing in disguise.<br>1. Do you really think he has time to deal with a girlfriend when he can't even keep up in school due to dealing with magic and stopping world wars?<br>2. Getting a girlfriend means likely making enemies out of the other potential girlfriends.<br>3. He has a headcrab at home. When will they even get to due stuff?</br></br></br></br>  Raildex a shit<br>sage</br>  <br> yfw the girls want to win the Touma out of their own desires <br> yfw they girls have never thought of Touma's feelings </br></br>  <br> Raildex <br> Rail <br>Is this is a newfag thing?</br></br></br>  <br>Touma's feelings are become his dorm manager and you fucking win.</br>  <br>He could follow Hamazura's example, drop from school and get a job.</br>  <br>The point of school is to get more qualifications for jobs. Hamazura's basically lucked out and gets to test pilot an AI suit that's literally in love with him. Otherwise he literally is just doing manual labor.</br>  <br> Getting a girlfriend means likely making enemies out of the other potential girlfriends <br><br>He could like you know, tell them to fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br> tell them to fuck off. <br>Since when has that worked? He told them to fuck off and they followed him to Denmark to beat his ass.</br></br>  <br>If you thing that's something "new" I have bad news for you newfriend</br>  <br> this niggah </br>  <br>Touma could easily work for necessarious or the golden dawn and be stupid rich<br>Heck, he could have been the second in comand in gremlin if he wanted to</br></br>  <br>Being a magic terrorist and having a job are two different things.</br>  <br>Nah fam i don't remember him saying shit.</br>  <br> Protects Othinus from artillery <br> Hugs Othinus in front of everyone <br> Goes to Denmark alone with her <br>You don't have literally say fuck off to say fuck off, so fuck off, Anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's just dumb as fuck doing these jobs for free.</br>  <br>Mikotofags being BTFO would entail the cancellation of her manga, being replaced by a different electrical mascot for Dengeki's brand and being killed offpanel with Touma brushing it off as "shit happens". None of which is likely to happen.</br>  <br>Not all jobs have to be honest and a Touma rulen gremlin would be very different</br>  <br>Now that's just silly.</br>  <br>Yes you do in Touma's case so fuck off as well.</br>   killing the T because someone sent him a love letter  <br>This bitches are crazy<br>And they ain't even a yandere character</br></br>  <br>They just wanted Touma to ask them out but don't realize getting a love letter is an entirely different thing altogether.<br><br>Granted they also quickly realized Touma's a goddamn idiot and it isn't a love letter. Wonder if they followed him to see the magic god, at least?</br></br></br>  So is Touma dead yet?  <br><br>Yeah he died few Vol ago and is only going forward as a husk due to Othinus being kind.</br></br>  <br> Taking gag scenes seriously <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>His dead inside m8</br>   mfw touma doesn't even punch the shit out of bitches no more <br><br>Why haven't you guys dropped this shit already?</br></br>  Touma is quite easy.  <br><br>NT 10 made me wonder how long until he loses his mind and goes AWOL.</br></br>  <br>Gag scene or no, Touma's been through some shit and could probably use someone who's genuinely not violent. He even likes stereotypical ara-ara onee-sans, and those are typically not violent.<br>You forget how he nearly casually mindbroke Aogamu and Tsuchimikado by calling them not otakus? That was pure evil. He's got some stress built up and is just hiding it.</br></br>  <br> tfw we'll never see his best punch against carissa animated </br>  <br>No I'm waiting for him to actually break and turn demon<br><br><br>Like ollerus hinted<br><br><br>We just need for that slut called othinus to die in front of him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not necessarily Othinus, it can be any girl he cares about.</br>    <br>All of my sides. Kamachi is the best troll.</br>  <br>It doesn't even have to be something big to take him over the edge.<br>Just at the thought of St. Germaine possibly being a magic god who was after him was causing him to lose it.<br><br>He barely has it together; a tiny push will be just as effective as a big one in this case.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop it! Don't give him any ideas!</br>   At the same time, he clenched his fist hard enough that he thought it would break and he opened his eyes in such a ghastly expression it seemed tears of blood were going to start flowing from them <br><br><br>Poor lad</br></br></br>   Niggas actually think touma will ever go full demon mode <br><br>Stop deluding yourself fags.</br></br>  <br>He seems to be somewhat ok with High Priest, although he is being a bit more cautious than usual</br>  <br> âI had a feeling it was something like this. I didnât get my hopes at all. Not in the slightest!! Youâre probably some magician after Index, so hurry up and attack so I can destroy your illusion alreadyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy<wbr>yyyyy!!â</wbr> <br><br>I feel bad for laughing</br></br></br>  <br>Well, consider the circumstances. Touma was trying to figure out if it really was a magic god this time, and then when Touma starts to think he's serious, High Priest completely turns the mood on its head with a joke.</br>  <br>Pretty much, which means that he isn't pulling a Kodaka at least.<br><br>The girls should  JUST DO IT </br></br></br>  <br>Satan confirms</br>  <br>Magic God Satan?</br>  <br>His becoming aware of how things usually happens</br>  <br>Ye he ded.</br>   âItâs true the world might look fragile to some people. To a Magic God up in the clouds, itâs something you can remake as many times as you like. â¦But thatâs still wrong. This isnât an RPG that was made to be beaten and it doesnât just reach âthe endâ once it is beaten. Iâm in the center? Iâm the pillar supporting it? If so, the worldâs lifespan is only about one hundred years. That just canât be. Itâll continue on even when I die.â <br><br> âHow naÃ¯ve. Or were you too thoroughly imprinted with the idea that all people are equal?â <br><br>Touma confirmed to continue suffering for eternity</br></br></br></br>   In an instant, bits and pieces of frightening memories stabbed into the back of Kamijou Toumaâs mind. <br><br> He had already grown a bit tearful. </br></br>  <br> Touma  <br> Ever actually dying </br></br>    <br>As much as the gag scenes try to hide it, the billions of hells did seriously leave its mark on Touma.</br>  <br>Othinus is most beta of them all. Creating million personal hells is fucking roundabout way to get people understand you.</br>  <br>That was likely actually a case of Othinus herself not knowing she wanted someone to understand her.</br>  <br>What a little bitch.</br>  <br> butthurt Accelfag is at it again </br>      <br> Creating million personal hells is fucking roundabout way to get people understand you. <br>But she went through all these hells while trying to go back to her original world.<br>So only someone with a similar experience could understand her.</br></br></br>  <br>H3 dead</br>  So accelerator is definitely not in this volume?  <br><br>We confirmed that a few days ago.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, no Shitcelerator in this volume.</br>   Seria is also an angry tsundere that reacts in exaggerated I'll kill Touma fashion <br>Seria a shit? Seria a shit.</br>  <br>What emotion dose this face try to convey?</br>  <br>He's as relevant as Himegami. Go get your fix with the Accel manga/</br>  This High Priest guy is too hilarious. <br>I don't expect him to be like this.</br>  <br>  Itâll continue on even when I die. <br><br>no escape now</br></br></br>  <br>Haven't been on these threads for a while but fuk guess I'll pick up this shit another time then, thanks.</br>  <br>Thinking it and actually doing it is different.<br>She never did anything to him so far.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, he's touching the tits of a legit mummy and a purple Chinese vampire. How the fuck is he supposed to feel?</br>  So... Why girls just can't confess to him first?  <br><br>See you in a few years.</br></br>  <br>Status quo.</br>  <br>Come round the corner and say that again faggot.</br>  <br>Because spaghetti. He also would think that is Thor fucking with him</br>  <br><br>The fact brown skin actually lives at his home now full size must really freak him out deep down.</br></br>  <br> Dem antics <br>I see Mikoto is still best girl.</br></br>  Next Volume should be Accelerator vs Not-Touma  <br>PTSD<br>and now one of them live in his place.<br>His suffering is eternal.</br></br></br>  <br>Because that isn't allowed. Keep up, dude.</br>  <br><br>Best burden girl.</br></br>  <br>I'm always down for Accel getting his shit kicked in</br>  <br>Nuit or bro end soon.</br>  <br><br>I think he just gave up and retreated inside at how it's all worthless to do anything. No will to try anything. Just let it be.</br></br>    <br>because yandere IB-chan keeps all other girls away, too bad that his right hand is a fate changing yandere that want him to masturbate for the rest of his life.</br>  <br>As far as we know, he invites her to his home to presumably talk. I don't think it said she was actually going to live there, and even if she does, she'll likely move out once AntiTouma goes back to his own Delta Squad.</br>  <br>Can't wait for the doujins, especially if she's going to last.</br>      <br><br>Minor nitpick, but her eyes are supposed to constantly switch colors so would be nice to see someone give them different colors sometime.</br></br>      <br> but her eyes are supposed to constantly switch colors <br>I thought it said she could and does change them at a whim, not constantly changing. For all we know, her "whim" could last over 1,000 years.</br></br>  <br>But awaki is best girl.</br>  <br> Implying accel isn't gonna win this time </br>  <br>He's to good for this shitfest.</br>  I do like Chocolate Goddess' design, though.   All these chicks getting wet for Touma when Tsuchimikado is around  <br><br>How?</br></br>  <br> My feet hurts </br>  <br>Do any of these girls look like maids and little sisters? At most he'll get Maria too.</br>    <br><br><br>Damn my fetish</br></br></br>  <br>I prefer Nyang-Nyang</br>  <br>DED</br>  <br>She is kill mate</br>   Touma can't keep a conversation for 15 seconds with Mikoto before she explodes and attacks him <br> He has a very polite and reasonable discussion with a magic god out to get him. <br><br>Fucking teenagers, at this point I think Touma barely passes as one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Vampires are kill from the start.</br></br>    <br>That's what billion of years inside of hell does that to you</br>  <br>Best Magic God. BEST MAGIC GOD.</br>  <br>I'm just surprised none of these bitches trying to get his dick instead.</br>  <br><br>Literally worst magic god, no wonder kamachi killed this shit off.</br></br>  Where were you when Moria cucked arlong and joined the revs to take revenge on the WG.  Can we leave the Haki and Sabo arguments in the last thread and talk about other stuff this time?  <br> You could do that but it kinda lessens the impact of the government having it if its available for pirates. <br>kind of true, but then again I'm imagining it would be hardly easy to find and get even in underworld trades<br><br> Everyone would just default to a weapon fighting style even when not fighting Logia just to stay sharp with it.  <br>fair point, unless there were a way to implement Kairoseki in other fighting styles that do not require a weapon (and that should be the very purpose of Kairoseki) it would limit the various ways of fighting characters have.<br><br> I still don't like haki, I see it as a necessary evil but that doesn't mean I enjoy it, oda should have planned Logias a bit better at the beginning </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> leave Sabo arguments in the last thread <br>The entire chapter was about Sabo, then what shall we discuss instead?</br></br>  <br>Could Lucci defeat any executive if the doffy family?</br>  <br>new nakama</br>  <br>Discuss Moria taking refuge with the revolutionaries.</br>  <br>Kyros?</br>  <br>No thanks I don't want to speak about Bellamy instead of Sabo</br>   Reaction Faces: The Chapter <br> people like the Riku family get multiple pages dedicated to them crying <br> nothing from Law <br> next we see of him he's sleeping like a baby <br> his character's journey ended with one panel of a blank stare in 790 <br><br>But muh catharsis<br>I know Law's not the most animated guy but this seemed off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, he was fucked in the ass by a somehow weak Luffy, I really don't see him doing much good against Doffi's family  even though it's full of jobbers . At least, he may have it against Buffalo, Baby 5 and someone else, but him defeating Pika or Gladius? I hardly see that happening if we talk about pre timeskip Lucci</br>  <br>You can discuss Sabo without arguing about asspulls.</br>  <br>That isn't Moria.</br>  <br>That's not what happened though.</br>  <br>You're right, those were his shadows.</br>  <br>Are we talking about present day (2 more years of training) Lucci or Lucci from W7? I think he could defeat some of them, Pica and Diamante would be tough though.</br>  <br>But then we would just discuss an ace rip off. <br><br><br><br>He would definitely lose against Pica, Diamante and Trebol.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's still next chapter anon, it's definitely coming, just be patient.</br>  <br>This. I wanted to see more reactions from Law. Maybe we'll get some sort of reaction or change in attitude when he wakes up or something. Like he's free now, like what Cora-san wanted. <br><br>Or maybe when he reunites with his crew.</br></br></br>   moria working with the RA yet still has absalom work as a photographer catching pirates pic   Tekkai is haki  <br> yfw law crys out of nowhere while hugging luffy in front of the crew <br>I'm not gay, but I would definitely get a boner</br></br>   an army of flamingirls will never swoon over you <br><br>Why even live</br></br>  <br>Law will get his own "Arigatou Mugiwara" moment in the next chapter, stop being such an impatient faggot</br>  How did Sabo make a Vivre card for Luffy? He hadn't seen him before today.  <br> There's still next chapter anon, it's definitely coming, just be patient. <br>That's exactly what everyone said 4 chapters ago</br></br>  <br> yfw apoo will betray the alliance and become the next joker just liek Doffy was before him working under the violent yonkou   Highest Priest Urouge </br>  <br>Yeah lucci would lose to a guy who was beat by a one legged sword fighter who had been a toy for ten years and the guy who luffy didn't even need to go gear third or and was basically OHKO. Pica is about the only one who could defeat him and that's because his power is overly OP for running, hell just look how it took zoro to one OHKO him! It was like 50 fucking chapters</br>  <br> nakama <br>Use english you assclown.</br></br>  Do you think it will be hard for any villain to top Doflamingo that isn't a yonkou?  How the fuck can the Strawhats just go to some house and chill?<br><br>Why are they not giving a fuck about Sanji and others having to deal with Big Mam? This is something that should top fucking priority for all of them.</br></br>  <br>I know, that was me too.<br>It's coming, it's just that there is just no way to know when exactly.</br></br>  Will vice admirals ever be a real threat anymore?<br><br>Luffy/Zoro/Sanji/Franky can beat them 1 on 1, as long as the strawhats don't split up too much they would be fine.<br><br>Vergo is a special case because he was pretty much the strongest VA so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br> stop being such an impatient faggot <br>Never.</br></br>  <br>There isn't really an english word with the same meaning as nakama. Friend or ally would be close but meh.</br>  <br>Akainu, Kizaru, Green Bull, some Tenryuubito shit, maybe CP0... I'd say not.</br>  <br>Who cares ? Ace did it ,so Sabo do it.</br>  <br> Kyros &gt; pre-tuimeskip lucci <br>Why are you so delusive? There was a reason why kyros was hyped while everyone lost their memories.</br></br>  <br> Sanji <br> anyone's priority <br>They can always just grab a new cook in Dressrosa and eat paella everyday.</br></br></br>  Is dragon the worst dad ever?   Law uses his sword as a pillow <br>2kawaii4me</br>  <br>I didn't mean in powerscaling. <br><br>I meant as a genuinely good villain</br></br></br>  <br>Crew member you idiot.</br>  <br>By the way the translation for this panel is slightly off, what Sabo actually says on the right is "So we can depart whenever?"</br>  <br>Ace got a vivre card of himself. Sabo got a vivre card of Luffy.</br>  <br> Why are they not giving a fuck about Sanji and others having to deal with Big Mam? <br>the trust them and as Nami said that they'll wait on Zou, the strawhats on Dressrosa think that the others are on Zou.<br><br><br> yfw "the sword belongs to my other friend from the past who was killed by Kaidou!! We must stop him!!" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Vergo is a special case because he was pretty much the strongest VA so far. <br>Garp.</br></br>  <br> some Tenryuubito shit <br>WUT</br></br>  <br>dat robin<br>croc must've been a big gayboi to not have tap that</br></br>  <br> muh Sanji meme <br><br>This needs to stop. How about avoiding Big Mam from fucking the Thousand Sunny up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Doflamingo shot him with sleep drugs</br></br>  <br>Nobody , all the other vilains will be generic shit .</br>   Rebecca not invited to a sleepover at her own fucking house <br>Damn that's cold.</br>  <br>1. Luffy and others are severely injured, they need rest to be of any use.<br>2. They trust Sanji and the rest of the crew<br><br><br>There are definitely still strong Vice admirals. I think it would be wrong to assume that Vergo was the strongest VA by a wide margin. Sure he was the strongest one we've seen but there can be others of similar strength. If he outclassed the other VAs by that much they probably would have tried to make him an admiral.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see... In which case, I'd say Akainu has a good chance of topping him. Kidd too, maybe, but I'm not so sure about him.  I know he's a yonko but Blackbeard will be GOAT </br>  <br>Honestly I don't even think any Yonkou has the potential to be a better villain. Unless Shanks turns evil of course.</br>  <br> implying she would have survived the gang bang that they had before they slept <br>Kyros would't want to see his own daughter getting buttfucked</br></br>  <br>Garp isn't in his prime, m8.</br>  <br>Not even close to the same connotation.</br>  <br> Luffy and others are severely injured, they need rest to be of any use. <br><br>Zoro, Robin, and a bruised up Franky are more than capable of dealing with tough situations.</br></br></br>  Will the other half of the Straw Hats appear ever again?  <br>Dofflamingo is so overrated on /a/ that it's crazy. He was an entertaining villain but he didn't do anything worthy of thinking he can't be topped.</br>  <br>Nothing but Franky's massive vibrating robo-dick can satisfy her anymore</br>  <br>Garp could still casually defeat Vergo.</br>  <br><br>He stepped down to instruct and only keeps the title to inspire new marines, he's not really a VA anymore.</br></br>  <br> new nakama <br>The only character that had a potential was Viola. Too bad Oda wrote her out of the story until when the plot needed her. She got the worst treatment of any character this arc save for the girl in the Doflamingo family at the factory who's only purpose was for Oda to make a joke between Franky and Senor Pink.</br></br>  <br> How the fuck can the Strawhats just go to some house and chill? <br>they know they can't get anywhere anyway until their captain is fit again</br></br>  <br> Honestly I don't even think any Yonkou has the potential to be a better villain <br><br>you're saying that Blackbeard and Kaido do not have the potential to be better than doflamingo? Why?</br></br></br>  <br>They coup de bursted their way out. They're fine.<br><br><br>Sluts who didn't do anything weren't allowed at the sleepover.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Crocoboy dried out his own dick so he wouldn't have any sexual tension screwing up his plans</br></br>  <br><br>No. He could be way worse.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad somebody jumped on my joke theory. I will be fairly surprised if it's true though.</br>  <br>nah, there was not a single character in this arc who showed any potential to be a new crew member. And how was Viola treated bad? She helped saving the day together with Usopp and showed that she got some balls when she encountered Doflamingo.</br>  <br>Still the most powerful VA we've seen (although he did refuse a promotion multiple times).</br>  <br>I never liked Blackbeard and thus far I'm only moderately hyped for Kaidou. I don't think he has the potential to be as interesting as Doffy but I hope I'm wrong. At least his crew has Drake and seems cool enough.</br>  No guys seriously, who was crow?<br>I doubt its Moria.</br>  <br>You're crazy if you don't think Bart doesn't have nakama potential. <br><br> interacted with most of the crew members that were on dressrosa <br> met sabo <br> helped strawhats the entire time <br> interesting power <br> clear role on the crew <br> plenty of pre set gag interactions <br><br>He could easily fit into the crew.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What did Doffy do that was so interesting that it couldn't be topped? I don't get this extreme love /a/ has for him.</br>   http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-07-08/berserk-manga-confirm<wbr>ed-to-resume-as-monthly-series-this<wbr>-month/.90187</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Where were you when Miura raised from the ashes?</br></br>  Yeah, can't wait for 3-4 chapters and then another hiatus  <br>you have to believe.</br>  <br> Where were you when Miura raised from the ashes? <br>Dead.</br></br>  <br> There are people who died while waiting for berserk <br>;-;</br></br>  <br>I refuse to believe this.</br>  <br>At the very least Guts will get out of that fucking boat, should be fun to see how he'll different he'll look at the end of his ride</br>  I'll draw anything Griffith x Casca related, so request!  Sorry, I'm not a drawfag but I tried  <br>How old is Guts?</br>  <br> I'm not a drawfag  <br>I can tell.</br></br>  <br>Look at it this way,when the actual drawfag isn't doing shit, you gotta man up and try.</br>  <br>Have this.  [Griffith hair is a little bitch/spoiler]<br><br> Implying I'd ever draw Griffith getting fucked by a man. <br>Miura already did it.</br></br></br> </br>  <br>You should make a doujin</br>  I want to read up on the series.<br>What sites did you guys use to read it?</br>  <br>Nig that's good, too bad your taste is shit</br>  <br><br>Thank you a lot. I don't care if I'm the only one in the world who takes them seriously, as long as I can drew them however I please I'm the happiest.</br></br>  <br>Damn, guts sure got handsome.</br>  <br>Caska shoving a sword through Griffith's midsection.</br>  To the drawfag who said he was going to draw us something. Here, take my request.<br><br>Can you draw Griffith getting fucked in the ass by Casca making the Guts face? Can you draw Puck coming out of her ass hole?<br><br>This is the guts face I was talking about</br></br></br></br>  Why can't I hold all these sacrifices?  <br>I already posted what I drew and I did it thinking about you.<br><br><br>Also, this anon already completed your request you sickfuck.<br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>That drawing is shit though</br>  <br><br>I requested Puck coming out of Casca's anus...</br></br>  <br>I don't want to be rude to the anon, but I can try to fix Casca's face in this drawing<br><br>. <br>I'm not touching Griffith though.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah griffith is fine, I just want to see Puck coming out of her asshole with like a cute face.</br>  <br> I don't want to be rude to the anon <br>Don't worry, I know it's shit</br></br>  <br>Meh, it doesn't look *that* bad.<br>Not bad enough for Guts to scream to Casca not to look.<br><br>I was expecting his face to be entirely deformed, his nose to be cut off completely, his skin to be mostly peeled off with huge infection bubbles and puss coming out of hit, his hair completely cut, his ears entirely removed only showing the inner entrance.<br>A complete destruction of his face except for his eyes.<br><br>That image just makes it look like the torturer simply peeled a bit of his skin. <br>Personally I don't understand why he didn't simply pluck both of his eyes but I guess they were needed for further suffering before the Eclipse. Griffith needs eyes to see how much he's lost.<br><br><br>Niiiice. I love it.<br><br><br> yaoi shit <br>Boring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok! I'll work on it then.</br>  <br>Go fuck yourself name.</br>  <br> go fuck yourself <br>Shoving stuff in your anus is more in your department.</br></br>  I don't get new griffeth is he evil or not?<br><br>becuz on one had his crew is all apostles and he has a division with just demons but on the other hand he did kill that muslim wizard could king and drove all of them from his land and built a utopia, <br><br>imo tbh guts is the bad guy here for wanting to kill him for personal reasons</br></br></br></br>  <br>grif is fag imho</br>  <br>I can't believe that's a real link.</br>    <br>The involvement of the entire God Hand during the creation of Falconia, and the fact that there is a huge fucking stadium full of monsters inside Falconia, seems pretty fucking ominous.</br>  <br>He's the same Griffith he always was. The only difference is as a member of the God Hand he's incapable of feeling remorse for his actions.</br>  <br> becuz <br> imo <br> tbh <br><br>Why?<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All Apostles are evil, stop being dense.<br><br> he has a division with just demons but on the other hand he did kill that muslim wizard could king and drove all of them from his land <br>They were invaders, that doesn't make him evil but it wall all according to keikaku so that the astral could be merged.<br><br> build a utopia <br>At the cost of making everywhere else toxic and inhabitable. Yeah, sure. The God Hand basically just caged the entire human race in a single location to be slaughtered. Truly a good person would do something like that.<br><br> guts is the bad guy here for wanting to kill him for personal reasons <br>How is killing for personal reasons bad if they are justified? Is killing Griffith going to stop Falconia from functioning? <br>That reasoning is flawed and false.<br><br><br>Haha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it does but maybe the new society is for demons and humans to live 2gether? <br><br><br>I did get a lot fo homo vibes from him and he did get fugged by that one rich guy I think he's bi at least <br><br>new griff doesn't seem gay at all</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh? So wanting gay shit to be drawn, being attracted to a shota isn't gay and not in your department?<br><br>I'm pretty sure you're half way from fucking yourself already.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the god hand giraffe and new Griffith are seperate entities how can he be in two places at once?</br>  <br>i think he was legit gay back when he was younger, at least bi like you said, im pretty sure he wanted guts</br>  <br> Is killing Griffith going to stop Falconia from functioning?  <br> That reasoning is flawed and false. <br><br>it's not like it's some self automating system bruh you need a strong goverment to make sure it doesn't go to shit if guts does make his way back he will fuck up a lot of shit and ruins potentially everything</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like things up my ass. I'm a top.</br>  <br>Falconia is a monarchy system.<br><br><br>Please, you're a little bitch and even Puck would be on top of you.</br></br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/8phqA2gkkRc  [ ]  <br>right and I'm pretty sure that system would go to shit if the king and most of his nights were killed imo</br>  <br>You need to brush up on your history. Griffith is not king. And even if he died, the bloodline still resides with Charlotte.<br><br>If Griffith died, sure, there might be some riots but someone will eventually take his place.</br></br></br>  <br> If Griffith died, sure, there might be some riots but someone will eventually take his place. <br>He's migt not be king, but he's their leader and worshipped as a god. If he dies everything will go to shi.</br></br>  <br>guts will most likely kill charlotte too imo<br><br>plus like  said ppl worship griff as a god remember in real history when jesus died the spanish inquisition was the result</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off. Go punch your mother.<br><br><br>Is this put together well?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's important, sure, but you're overestimating how much shit would happpen if Griffith were to vanish. It wouldn't be that bad.<br><br><br> guts will most likely kill Charlotte <br>Maybe, we'll see. He has no real reason to kill her honestly.<br>I still predict that Griffith will consummate the marriage with her and  mind break her like he did with Casca. <br><br><br>You should go punch one of your two fathers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was sat at home drinking brain fluid</br>  <br>If she's pregs with his child you can be sure guts will slay her</br>  <br>Griffith has no need of an heir.</br>  <br>He does, Guts gun kill him</br>  Griffith was so innocent pre eclipse. Guts leaving really fucked him up bad.  <br>this a pretty fucking awesome game with an amazing ost.</br>  <br>Yes and no. The voice acting for ishdoro or whatever is pretty annoying. It doesnt match him at all. Pretty sure they fucked up bot having Rickert on the Hill of Swords too. Gameplay seems really tight. It could use a remake to be honest.</br>  <br> innocent </br>  <br> so innocent <br>Not as much as you'd think he was.<br>He has his cute innocent side and his serious as fuck side.</br></br></br>  <br>is*</br>  <br> sold his ass virginity to fund his warband <br> innocent </br></br>  <br> You should go punch one of your two fathers. <br>That doesn't even make any sense. <br><br><br> Griffith was so innocent <br>So Guts should have just submitted and became his tool?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that Casca?  Kinda looks like me </br>  <br>I'm calling you gay, faggot.</br>  <br>yea telling guts to kill that old man who tried to kill him and his kid that was real innocent<br><br>also raping a child (princess Charlotte)</br></br></br>  <br><br>can you two fags leave the thread already?<br>everything was going so well with one cancerous tripfag gone, please don't ruin this</br></br></br>  <br>You can just ignore it.</br>  <br>No faggot, I didn't say that. It was good that Guts left and went onto pursue his dream. But in the end, it sort of was the reason why Griffith acted so weird and fucked Charlotte and got his ass tortured.</br>  <br>You look like an ugly mexican.<br><br><br>So if I have two fathers, I'm gay? No. I just like sweet b!p.<br><br><br>You must be new. How're the threads treating you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Tane should go fuck himself and fuck off.<br><br><br> So if I have two fathers, I'm gay? <br>It's a stereotype faglord, don't think too hard on it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You look like an ugly mexican. <br>I know that, I just said it.</br></br>  was that preacher bruh a apostle or did he turn apostle last min? tbh it was really confusing but he looked so fucking strange when I 1st saw him I was like dis nigga apostle for sure, but then he had that stupid excuse that he slams his face into the ground every day to give him that freaky ass blockface look and I don no what to think anymore  <br>It's hard for morons to ignore literally retarded random irrelevant shitposters and it's hard especially for the literal retards who suck their dicks.</br>  <br>I love how you think you're superior.

If so I don't even need a powerup, I'd just sacrifice all the niggers for free.</br>  Who wins? Serpico with his normal sword, or Griffith (right before he fucks princess Charlotte in Golden age arc)<br><br>Scenario one: Prep time/strategy allowed. No rules. See who the better strategist fighter is.<br><br>Scenario two: No prep time. Just see who the better swordsman is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My money would be on Serpico in both cases.<br><br>Griffith is a war strategist, Serpico is a one on one combat strategist.<br><br>Also, Guts annihilated Griffith in Golden age arc before he even went off to train for a year to improve drastically, without the dragon slayer in the flash of an eye. Serpico managed to cut Gut's face first fight, and match his speed for a bit second fight. That was after Guts was waaaaaaay stronger than when he fought Griffith and had a better sword.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nyaa or BakaBt I'd guess?</br>  <br>Serpico put up a much better fight than Griffith did against an even more powerful Guts. Can you imagine how shattered Griffith's pride would have been if he had known that there was not one but two swordsmen who could best him in fair combat?</br>  <br>When I realized this I was a bit disappointed.</br>  <br>Can you imagine him seducing Farnese just to fuck with Serp? He had to have picked up on his attraction, and Farnese used to be weak enough to cave to his Grif mojo.</br>  <br> Iwata </br>  <br>I think he's the false messiah type</br>  <br>Unf<br>Pre Sperg Casca is fucking top tier<br>Guts hammered that pussy<br> then he strangled her kek </br></br></br></br>  <br>A-Anon...why would you hurt me like this?</br>  <br>Just start from the beginning of the manga.

You missed out of gay water fights.</br>  <br>I think Falconia will probably end up like skull king's empire/city, because casuality and stuff</br>  <br>I'd use the crimson one with minimal hesitation to be honest. Not even being an edgy cunt.</br>  <br>He is the real messiah, but Miura isn't a Christian and he finds the concept of messiah manipulative and evil.</br>  <br>Wtf, why would you be willing to use a regular Behelit but not Crimson?</br>  <br>Being a God Hand isn't that fun.</br>  <br>Theres actually a certain type of play in japanese culture thats very popular with the older crowd that depicts a White person (clothed, not race) is percieved as good because of the clean white appearence, when in fact he is purest evil, and does everything in his power to portrait the purest of good, who is clothed all in black as evil. Im pretty sure thats what Miura is doing with Guts and Griffith.</br>  <br>Because im not a cute girl like you</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>I doubt it. Guts is not a good guy. And Griffith clearly isn't just some evil monster who wants to kill people.</br>  <br> Griffith isnt just some monster who wants to kill people <br><br>Stop posting you heartless fuck<br>This meme is in poor taste</br></br></br></br>  <br>What meme? It's true.</br>  <br>He just wants to kill people that don't obey him.</br>  <br>Well think about the shit he's done. To humans, hes like a white angelic god. And thats just the surface. Deep down look at the shit thats happened because of him. Black at his core.<br><br>Now look at Guts. The Black Swordsman. Renegade. Killer. Criminal. And yet all the fucker does is try to get revenge for the shit Griffith did, save other humans while being a prick about it, or putting humans out of their misery from demonic possession, or they just got in his fucking way.<br><br>Pretty sure if everyone who hypes up Griffith, The Hawk of Light to commoners just ends every sentence with "and he sacrificed everyone he loved or cared for to hellspawn demon nightmares in a satanic ritual" no one would like him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. He didn't kill Guts.</br>  <br>no.<br><br>griffith was cocky, serpico was well aware of the monster that Guts is.</br></br></br>  <br>If you actually read Berserk you would know he isnt Griffith anymore, hes Femto. There are no shreds of humanity left in him.<br>You clearly missed the part in the last chapter about "the hawks black talons"<br>Dont put so much weight in appearance, Griffith or Femto is a servant of pure evil.</br></br></br>  <br>spoken like a true scumbag</br>  <br>Griffith knew full well how powerful Guts had become. He watched him fight in many battles after all and even comments during his inner monologue that he's not sure he can beat him anymore.</br>  <br> hes like a white angelic god <br>He is their god. The Idea of Evil is the human god and Griffith is its agent. The white hawk is the symbol of their religion. <br> save other humans while being a prick about it <br>He doesn't care about saving anyone except people close to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Any more of these? Where are they from</br>  <br> There are no shreds of humanity left in him <br>So? There is only his original dream and desire. Killing humans was never Griffith's dream.</br></br>  <br>shut up you</br>  <br> to achieve your dream you will need to pile up the corpses <br><br>OH yeah forgot about that kek</br></br></br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>What about fatslugs daughter? You see alot of her in this manga? The old mans daughter who turned into a zombie? He tried to save her, and ended up having to cleave the bitch in two as a mercy killing. He saves people when he feels like it.</br>  <br>Its got nothing to do with his dream anymore, he isnt the same person. He was decieved by the other godhand to make that sacrifice, now he serves The Idea. He babbles on about his dream but whos to say he even has free will anymore.<br><br>Hes still a weak backstabbing bitch that slaughtered his friends because he wanted to walk again.</br></br></br>  <br> decieved <br>Nope</br></br>    <br>What? He literally was..<br>The little floaty guy fed him that bull about having to pile up the bodies to reach the castle in the sky and Griffith thought it was his conscience. He was tricked. You really think they just give people god powers and get nothing out of it? They made him a Godhand so he could merge the worlds, and who knows whats next.<br>You really didnt read Berserk did you</br></br></br>  <br>pls no</br>  <br>Maybe if guts didnt try to rape her  ;_; </br>  <br>Why are my eyes leaking</br>   Get into figure collecting like a year ago <br> Missed Berserker Armor Guts Figma <br><br>Fucking hell, it's so expensive it hurts.</br></br></br>  <br> The little floaty guy <br><br>Ubik showed him the truth. All of what he told him was true. To hold on to his ludicrious dream, people would have to die, and die for him. Just because it's presented in a flashy way doesn't mean it's false. Think of The Count's arc. What did Ubik do? He showed The Count the truth. He showed Theresia the truth about her dad.<br><br>In the end, all apostles make the choice to commit evil willingly. Griffith was not the exception. There's a reason why their leader/master of ceremonies is represented by a big brain.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its not really tricking when the objective facts are put out in a convincing way. Griffiths actions lead to whole lot of dead people. His actions were for his goal/dream, so its not too much to say the mountain of corpses are there to help him get to his dream. The logic was pretty solid all in all. If he wasn't an invalid at that point in time I am sure he would have rejected it, but that is not how fate/causality works.</br>  <br><br>Anyone who says otherwise is full of shit. <br><br>Griffith fought beside Guts for years longer than Serpico has, yet Serpico found a way to challenge Guts on multiple occasions through strategic advantage. He also actually put up a semi-decent fight with Guts. If he used his slyph sword to make up for the fact that Guts was using an overpowered sword himself, the fight would be much more even. If he used his flying robe he probably could have stood a decent chance against Guts with Berserker armor on as well.</br></br></br></br>   Griffith fags <br> Everywhere </br>  <br> You really think they just give people god powers and get nothing out of it? <br>They say "Do as you will." Because the whole God Hand-Aposlte routine ultimately exists to create suffering to feed the Idea. <br><br>So however the apostles and GH act, despite being given instructions will increase the Idea's power. Example: Ganishka.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it was the truth <br><br>And that makes it the right thing to do does it?<br>Griffith would have achieved what he wanted if he hadnt gotten rekt by Guts and decided to penetrate the underage<br>Even after he summoned the God Hand he was hesitant, then Ubik (thanks forgot his name) gave him that flashback to the dream Griffith was always having but he twisted it.<br><br>I guess its a matter of different interpretations, whichever way you slice it what he did was wrong. So so wrong. If you have even a shred of sympathy for that dog after what he did then you arent human</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   People defending griffith <br><br>shit have we watched the same anime/manga, nigga is pure evil.</br></br>  <br> And that makes it the right thing to do does it? <br>What? No, of course not. <br><br>I was just saying that his actions are even more inexcusable because he acted knowingly. There was no twisting involved.<br><br>I'm just glad you're not a Griffith apologist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck no<br>I was just saying thats the way i interpreted it, i believe he was decieved because at the time he was desperate<br><br>Hes still a little shit and i cant wait for Guts to rape HIM next time<br>Oh man that would be glorious</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No one said it was the right thing to do, but it is the logical next step he had to take. Didnt help he was tortured for a whole fuckin year and wasn't exactly himself, but he was rescued and told everyone that rescued him to fuck off to hell. There was no twisting, it was harsh fucking daylight on his own actions. He was able to see all of the actually really shitty things he has done and he makes the decision to do some more. Griffith was never good, he had enough ability to rationalize the shit he did and relabel it. Its the same shit as freedom fighter/terrorist, point of view is a hell of a thing.</br></br>  <br> freedom fighter or terrorist <br><br>Holy shit anon I actually remember Miura saying in an interview that he was inspired by some terrorist events <br>It makes sense now</br></br></br></br>   monthly   <br> shiggy </br>      Why are most Berserk doujins either gay or loli?  <br>The first one is going to be 100 pages, the others probably the standard 40. This is how it should be. At least until it's on hiatus again by winter.</br>  <br>Because it already has plenty of hetero rape?</br>  <br> the face of a rapist </br>  <br> he isn't the same person <br>He is literally the Griffith's soul without his humanity. <br><br> to achieve your dream you will need to pile up the corpses <br>Yes, and he achieved his dream.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger hes stipped of emotion<br>What else defines a person?<br>He isnt the same person</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean he wants to kill humans for no reason. In its core it's still Griffith. Femto is Griffith's soul.</br>  <br>100+ it says. Could be 101, could be 600</br>  <br> implying hes going to let everyone in Falconia live happily ever after </br>  <br>why not?</br>  <br>This image is always so overdramatized. Like a girl would cry because a guy didnt talk to her. Bitch is insecure as shit.</br>  <br>BECAUSE HES A FREAKING DEMON DUDE JESUS<br> GRIFFITHFAGS </br></br>  <br>Do you have some sort of condition that renders you incapable of understanding humor?</br>  <br>It's just a recap anon, together with the new chapter.</br>  <br>So? I don't think you actually understand how the demons work in Berserk.</br>  <br>You clearly dont<br>Did you just skip the Eclipse or something?<br>Demons HATE humans, they feed on them for fuck sake<br>Doesnt it even seem slightly unusual to you that thise very same demons are now risking their lives for humans?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Demons are humans and not all of them hate normal humans. <br> Doesnt it even seem slightly unusual to you that thise very same demons are now risking their lives for humans? <br>No, it was explained.</br></br></br>  <br> this was explained <br>Orly<br>Enlighten me</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 33 or 34.</br>    <br>Ive read the manga roughly 5 times from beginning to end anon</br>   Caska gets her memory back. <br> Becomes despondent, emotionally unstable and hates Guts for not saving her/shaken and keeps remembering the eclipse. <br>OR<br> Guts decides to leave her as she is because she's happier this way. <br>Which one do you think is more likely?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read it again.</br>  <br>Its not explained youre just trying to discredit me<br><br>The fact is we dont know for sure what his intentions are. But its extremely unlikely Griffith and the Apostles are suddenly good guys now. Since they live off suffering, and the literally sold their souls to evil.<br><br>So fuck you nigger im out PEACE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does "good guys" mean? <br> they live off suffering <br>They don't. <br> and the literally sold their souls to evil <br>Which in Berserk world is basically human selfish desires.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guts for not saving her <br>But he tried so hard. He cut off his own arm just to get a chance at rescuing her.</br></br>   they finally get to elfhelm and see the king <br> they have to kill some crazy elf demon god monster so the king will fix Casca <br> they do it but guts is bed ridden again so elf king fixing Casca <br> it's like skull knight said maybe she didn't want to get fixed <br> as Casca tries to kill herself her shadow babeh tries to stop her so Casca kills her kid then herself <br> guts finds near death Casca she says she hates him for fixing her  <br> he goes berserk and destroys half of elfhelm before loliwitch can stop him <br> elf king banishes his party off the island knowing that he couldn't do shit to guts <br> what a horrible night to have a cruise </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all of them. I think it's implied higher class ones like Zodd can control themselves better, like when he refused to partake in "indulgence" when the eclipse was happening and just waited outside. Most of the knights of the apocalypse seem to have at least somewhat bit of honor. The weaker more useless ones are the ones who just want to eat humans, and they get fucked up by greater apostles for it.</br>  <br>What are you even trying to say now? What the fuck do you think i mean you actual mongoloid<br><br>Youre trying to tell me that Griffith has his kingdom, so the fact that he is a rape hungry soulless monster that can squash matter with his mind is completely void now. Hes a good guy, even though he is a servant to the idea of evil. Even though he slaughtered his followers and has shown his demonic side time and time again.<br><br>How will Berserk end then? Griffith having his happy tea parties in Falconia while Guts is fucking around with the little shota elves on that island?<br><br>Pls anon PLS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So im on ch 280. Does this kushan emperor really stand a chance against griffith/femto?  <br>Calm down m8 the chapters coming</br>  <br>Why dont you keep reading and find out?<br>Dont ask /a/ anything unless you want huge spoilers out the ass</br></br>   implying he's back   Fucking hell I have trouble believing griffith is a man. Hes so fucking pretty. I dont know if I wanna bone him or if I wanna let him bone me. Its maddening. No wonder griffith fags exist.  <br>Triple dubs confirm.</br>  <br>Cmon, you know how this is gonna go down.<br><br> Caska regains her memories <br> Denies and pretends it was a dream <br> Sees Guts; Tired, Worn, Ageing <br> 2-3 chapter panic, everyone trying to console her <br> Farnese says some shit like "you dont even know how lucky you are, me luv him long time" <br> She heads back and looks at him again <br> All the scars, the ageing, the armor <br> in her mind, she'll think it was all for her <br> She'll cry, they'll kiss, she gets left on Safety Island or joins the new Black Order or whatever you wanna call Guts ragtag group. <br><br><br> Rickert either gets murdered, has to watch Godo's daughter get rape-murdered, or they join the Black Order. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What the fuck /a/. Griffith is like the fucking lord of prep time. First he pulls out the queen, then the pope. It almost writes itself.  <br> Ella getting raped <br><br>But she'll be doing the raping this time. Lolis are notorious sexual predators.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah yes the infamous mololisters</br>  <br>Remember that a vote for Casca is a vote against 70 gigs and tripfags.</br>  <br>Maximum autism.</br>  <br>Gennon pls.</br>  <br> Implying he wasnt one lucky fuck </br>   you will never yell orders at your naked brown waifu <br><br>why live</br></br>  <br> filthy frank </br>  <br> not using a Dark Horse scan <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  Why the fuck does capn hook even exist? Will they even get off the damned boat? You know how it is with miura.  <br>done the of the drawing rest for you</br>  <br>I think we should be carefully optimistic about getting off the boat now that we get it monthly. <br>I mean I know I wont live to see the end but I think I now have a chance to get off the boat.</br></br>  Why is there so little porn of something so popular with so much fap fuel? <br><br>Alternatively, how much would it take to get Miura to just draw porn?</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what I'm looking at, is this Black Swordswoman Casca giving Griffith karmic revenge?</br>    <br>Its casca winking at Guts after getting her memories back and running to her true love.</br>  <br><br>In case you needed more convincing<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Theres already alot of sex though thats pretty explicit.</br>  <br>So what is this saying?<br>Everyone in Falconia is going to sacrificed for nothing?</br></br>  <br>I don't see the difference.</br>  <br>Holy fuck I need these cards<br><br>I cant find shit online they must be really fucking rare<br><br>I NEED IT<br>I THOUGHT I OWNED EVERYTHING BERSERK RELATED</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wtf..... he actively allowed EVERYONE in the band of the hawk to be sacrificed so that he could become femto. meaning GUTS included. i think you are missing the entire point of the eclipse and how it pertains to where guts is now.</br>  Why do I have this strong feeling that puck was the elf king all along and hes just pretending to be some random asshole for reasons?  <br>Man that's a sexy jaw<br><br>Why does Guts have Batman's jaw?</br></br></br>  <br> dark knight <br>Guts is Batman.</br></br>  Reminder that somehow Griffith is going to get tricked during a ceremony where he summons spirits and instead of bringing comforting shades to his subjects, it's going to be the ghosts of the sacrificed Band of the Hawk. And that'll be the real beginning of the end for Falconia.  <br> Puck could have cured Casca all along <br> likes being inside her mouth too much to do that </br></br>  What do you guys think of this scenario?<br><br> Elf magic un-potatoes Casca <br> News of Griffith's kingdom reaches the party and, like Rickert, they want to see Griffith <br> Travel ensues, adventures are had, Guts gets stronger, Falconia is reached <br> Griffith reached, nice chat ensues until Griffith decides he has business to finish and sacrifices to collect. <br> Griffith v Guts, it's close but   Guts loses, Griffith sacrifices Casca and then Guts sacrifices Griffith  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It won't be happening. If Guts gets any stronger than he is now he could destroy Griffith.</br>  <br>He  isn't yet .</br>   With each arc guts looks more and more miserable, agonized and pained <br> He also gets new scars and is aging fast <br><br>Fucking shit he'll look like hes 80 by the time the manga ends.<br><br> If it ends. </br></br></br></br></br>  Where were you when Rickert fucking called it?  <br>He's definitely strong, but probably not Skull Knight strong, and Griffith is pretty much deity level. There's some gap there where Guts overcomes one or more of the armor's massive drawbacks before he's ready.</br>  Until the next idolm@ster comes out.  <br> Implying hes isnt taking it like a joke because he is THE elf king </br>  <br>He's going to turn into Blacksmith-Senpai</br>  I just reached chapter 144 after two long nights of reading.<br><br>Does the ride keep going?</br></br>  <br>shiiiiieeeet nigga</br>   How will Griffith/Femto end? <br>The "Black Swordsman" arc has just begun. The axis will be, obviously, the story in which Guts' feud with the God Hand, who Griffith/Femto belongs to, will be brought to a close. Let's think about the development leading to the finale.<br>First of all, what is the goal of the God Hand now that it's composed of 5 members? It is naturally expected that if Guts can't find it out, he won't even be able to confront them. Before that, is the God Hand complete with the addition of Femto?<br>"Hmm, for now the God Hand is supposed to be complete with Femto. I'm sorry but now is not a good time, as expected, to reveal their goal... Instead, I'll give you one hint. The keyword is "Void". You can imagine many things based on it." said Miura.<br><br><br> Void confirmed for final boss of the series </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, Griffith is the antechrist</br>  <br>But skull knight is the one destined to destroy voids asshole.</br>  <br>I just can't see any member of the Godhand being defeated through physical means, no matter how powerful the opponent is. I don't think Guts will be able to win like that and will be forced to settle with a stalemate of sorts where Griffith and the others are thwarted (but not destroyed) and Caska is more or less recovered. It would bring resolution to the story without being retarded.</br>  <br>What if  the Idea needs another hand </br>  <br>Where did that quote come from?</br>  <br> Idea of Evil confirmed for final boss of the series <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br> mangareader <br>You disgust me.</br></br>  How powerful would ganishka, the kushan emperor, be if he had his end beast powers to his full control?  <br>Exactly as powerful as shown, which was nigh unstoppably so.</br>  <br>Godo is best old wise man character</br>  <br>I prefer to look at it as him being determined, not quite as enraged as you make him sound.</br>  <br>He may be old but he isn't the wisest.</br>  Does Caska ever get her memories back? I'm currently reading the manga and I can't stand how much of a fucking retard she is.  <br>FUCK you m8.</br>  <br> likes a ruined character </br>  <br>What I mean is that Casca is retarded now for 22 years. He doesn't know our pain. <br><br>I'm glad I'm a westerner who is waiting for her to get better for JUST 10 years now.</br></br></br>  <br>Has her condition been healed yet?</br>  <br>Summer brings the attention seeking newfags in</br>  <br>No. <br>We only got a hint that she is probably going to hate it when it happens.</br></br>  I'm at Volume 12 and I'm scared at what's gonna happen.  <br> chapter 12 <br>I envy you.<br>Although I can't really believe what happens next was never spoiled to you.</br></br></br>  So this is pretty much "JUST FUCK HER ALREADY" the anime x1000?  Yup. <br>It's an ecchi harem, what do you expect? A good MC?</br>  <br>He'll go to jail. Would you go to jail just because you can't control your fucking dick?<br><br>The other chance is him getting married but that means only one.</br></br></br>  Doesn't he love them all equally or some bullshit like that?   but they made up an excuse for him not fucking them! <br>haremfags will defend this.</br>  <br>but she's not best girl</br>  <br>in which country would you go to jail for fucking a snake?</br>  I'll be back in this thread when spider queen and zombina get some time on the show.  <br>Most of them?</br>  <br>No. If you want to see people fucking go watch some hentai or some shit.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128102828 <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting, fuck off.</br>  <br>Papi and Centorea have legs too.

It usually means they consider other girls to be shit.</br>  <br> How many people here share the opinion that all girls are good <br><br>Women are subhuman trash and should have their rights stripped away sooner than later. They have a mental capacity barely above that of children and ever since being allowed to vote by our superior gender the world's done nothing but go to shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. In my personal opinion, each species does have their strengths and weaknesses (better cuddles, etc.), but none of them are really loathsome.</br>  <br> Monster Girls <br> Generic <br>Are you from the future or something?

As characters it's another story.</br>    <br>Trips confirm that all girls are good.</br>  <br>I guess so. Nobody created another, and this one was up a couple hours before the last "official thread" died, so being the lazy /a/utists we are, rather than start another thread, we moved here, and we get less "stop polluting the board!" posters.<br><br> inb4 stop polluting the board. </br></br></br>  <br>The scenario is painfully generic (hey MC-kun I'm some sort of highly-irresponsible-yet-incredibly<wbr>-competent-and-perceptive authority figure; you have a house to yourself and you're utterly obsessed with keeping your dick in your pants so I'm going to surround you with horny girls and punish you if you turn me down or make a move on them) and IMO the leap from "quirky love interest" to "monstergirl love interest" is a small one considering how commonplace succubi/elves/vampires/etc. are in ecchi shows.</wbr></br>  <br>Man I hope he gets a monstergirl like the rest of his brothers</br>  So are any sub groups going to pick up this show?

Thanks a lot</br>  <br> Chihiro <br><br>Not even once. I still remember their speedsubbing days.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I bet that in the dates arc, Draco (dragonewt)will be shown as a subspecies of lizardman. I hope as an example, Liz will be shown. The same goes for Tio and Kinu</br>   same generic haremshit <br> "B-but it has monsters girls so it's good!" </br>  <br>cheating slut</br>  <br>To be fair, they don't speedsub anymore. They've even gotten blue on nyaa a few times in recent history.

The beauty of this dish is that the water mixes with the condiments to create a delicious mild sauce. With the addition of the potato chips, the flavored sauce will permeabilize the fried potato chip interior and give it a natural flavoring that really enhances the flavortown in order to create a more appealing and astringent dish that is full-bodied and pungent, yet savory and succulent that is extremely tart.

They seem to be thing nowadays.<br><br>I'd get hungry if I had to watch SnS on a theater screen.</br></br>  <br>I think it's a game bonus.</br>  Why is oval eye Alice more fun than anyone not in the PSD?  <br>There is no sunscreens in Nippon?</br>  <br>adds some flair cause ladylike skinny shoulders. taking his jacket off would make it easier to compare to souma or isshiki on pure manly physique, in which he would lose in spades</br>  <br>He needs to go full italianmode like his brother when thin soon.</br>  I remember during the elections that Marui commented about the theme dishes for each of the quarterfinal rounds (bento, hamburgers, desserts, and ramen) as being significant<br><br>has anyone theorized what he was referring to? could it be that those are the specialties of the top 4 seats of the elite 10?</br></br>  <br>Commoner food, so basic and popular innovation and expansion is hard.<br> Tsukasa specializes in bento and is selling bento during the festival <br>That would be cute.</br></br></br>  <br>someone else commented on that during the same arc, it's that all of the dishes have a wide range of interpretation so you can get some really weird shit that shows the true personality of each cook. if it was a lot more specific and rigid category, everyone would just have to make variations on basically the same dish.</br>  <br>I think there's more to it than that. ryoko even said that the theme has a huge degree of freedom, which doesn't make expansion hard</br>  <br>Interesting.<br><br>I can see Momo being the desserts expert. Rindo is probably bento. Tousuke is ramen, and Tsukasa is Hamburgers.</br></br></br>  <br>those were the pairs i was thinking as well</br>  <br>Compilation movie with food served based on the movie  with extra high price tags of course .</br>  <br> momo making adorable character-themed bento <br><br>PLEASE GOD LET THIS HAPPEN</br></br></br>  <br> a name like Eishi Tsukasa <br> his stall is basically a castle <br> his specialty is hamburgers <br>It kind of fits his whole cool bishie is actually a slob with anxiety thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying she's not doing that already <br>getting 1st in the uptown area can't be all that easy, but uninhibited cuteness always helps.</br></br>  <br> Egg <br> Don <br> Egg again <br><br>The school doesn't really have a history of putting many restrictions on the students in terms of cooking assignments anyway though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which is a good thing, don't you think? Imagine if every competition ended up like the Giganigga vs Takumi semifreddo match, where the "twist" is just that- shocker! one has an EXTRA LAYER oh my god did not see that one coming where do they come up with all these crazy inventions<br><br>being broad in categories makes for a better story cause we get to see more neat stuff that's distinct from each other. as for why people like marui and ryoko are surprised? you could chalk it up to hamfisted writing, or handwave it away as them used to expecting a more finite category from their classes, and are not used to the competitions. either way it doesn't really impact anything.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying it's a bad thing, i'm just saying that there might be a reason why the school chose those SPECIFIC types of dishes for the elections</br>  <br>Creativity, innovation, and thinking on the fly, all while under pressure? Seems obvious enough to me. If everybody is going to make similar dishes then some people will relax cause they think at worst, they just have to be better than that guy since their dishes will inevitably be compared. If everyone is making something wildly different, each dish stands out on its own merit and nothing else.</br>  <br>Middle school vs High school at tootsuki, I think.<br><br>Middle school was about training your skills and getting shit right, so they made similar dishes every time.<br><br>High school was about proving you have the flair and perseverence to last in the cooking world, so you need to stick out by making different dishes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> handwave it away because nothing happens for a reason <br><br>get the fuck out</br></br></br>  <br>Once again, I'm not refuting that they're broad categories. What I'm saying is why did they choose those categories?<br><br>If you're going to pick "Ramen", why not go even more broad and say "Soups"? Instead of "Hamburger", why not say "Sandwiches"?<br><br>They're hinting that there's a significance in the types of dishes they're being asked to cook</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A hamburger isn't a fucking sandwich Google.<br>A cupcake with icing isn't icecream either.</br></br>  <br>in the broadest sense, which is what we're talking about, yes it is</br>  <br>I once got cupcakes for sushi, and another time I got juice as ice cream. New captcha is weird, that's why I switched back to the old one. Typing out numbers on doors again isn't all that fun, but it's easier and faster than the new captcha. I miss nigger captchas though.</br>   yfw Erina told Souma to beat the 8th seat instead of getting out of the red. <br><br>It's the small changes in character interaction that I really enjoy.</br></br>    <br>It's all part of her need to justify her feelings. She was initially offended at Souma because he made low-tier cuisine food, and in her mind that automatically equals being bad at cooking. Every time he gets some recognition though, it forces her to face the reality that he is actually pretty good at what he does, regardless of his style. So, now she's at the point where she's close to being able to constantly associate him with being a plebe, so long as he doesn't show off his plebe-ness in front of her. Instead, she wants to justify her past frustration at him by labeling it under feelings of a competitive nature. So, if he manages to do something good by beating Kuga, then that provides her with peace of mind since she can delude herself into believing that her antagonism is because he might be a legitimate threat, not because he makes diner food.</br>  <br>Knowing her personality it has nothing to do with Souma, it's because she doesn't like 8th seat.</br>  <br>I think it's a little of both. Nothing brings lovers together like mutual dislike of a third party</br>  <br><br>Well usually she'd tell him you have to focus and get out of the red, like Takumi, and Nikumi did. However by stating he should focus on the bigger objective she just assumed he would make it out of the red. She probably does dislike the 8th seat though.</br></br>  Kuga is cool  <br>If a kebab is a burger, burgers are sandwiches.</br>  <br>Soma are you okay?</br>  <br> A hamburger isn't a fucking sandwich Google. <br><br>Yes, it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Every hamburger is a sandwich but not every sandwich is a hamburger.</br>  <br>Is that how like, all thumbs are fingers but not all fingers are thumbs?</br>  <br>A thumb is not a finger.</br>  <br>Just like a burger isn't a sandwich.</br>  <br>But it is.</br>  <br>How is it not?</br>  <br>yes it is dumbshit, we all have ten fingers, two of which are thumbs</br>  You guys are lucky. my captcha is on some next level shit, asking me for mountains now  <br><br>the last human Ken died of leukemia this year, I wonder if pursuing this dream is worth the risks</br></br>  <br>Erina-sama is for  hand holding  you perv.</br>  <br> delude <br>Why wouldn't he be an actual threat? She can't trick herself if it's real.</br></br>  <br>there is literally no first year that has a shot in hell at beating erina in a shokugeki right NOW, even if she accepted their wager.</br>  how many girls has newspaper boypussy talked to? and what was his reaction to each?  <br>False. Akira.</br>   plot twist: The 3 genius stooges fail to make it out of the red and are expelled   <br>couldn't hold a candle to her. would get BTFO if he tried, which honestly would be good for his character development.</br>  <br> 1st place in his block in autumn election prelims, 2nd place overall <br> eventual winner of the election <br> god nose to match erina's god tounge <br> erina = all talk <br><br>it's not that outside the realm of possibility, anon, especially seeing as having him beat erina would be better for HER character development.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then they went to create their own high class cooking school, with blackjack and hookers <br> We get to have some interschool competition shenenigans. </br></br>  <br>It's asked me for mountains too, and insisted that one mountain I clicked on wasn't one. Whatever, google.</br>  <br>she<br>literally<br>is<br>unmatched<br>in<br>cooking<br>skill<br>in<br>the<br>entire<br>year<br><br>what part of that don't you understand? currynose might be the best of the rest, or not, that's up for debate, but whoever the #2 is would not even win 1 match out of 10 against her</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>where does it say that? like, seriously, where? she's made her teachers cuisinecum, but so has pretty much every other character. <br><br>she's got skills, there's no denying that, but the only time we've really been able to see it is when she whups some no name RS leader into submission and the egg buffet (and souma even managed to steal her customers).<br><br>the only reason that people are so high on her is because she got opportunities when she was younger that other students didn't. if she wasn't the headmaster's granddaughter, do you think that she would be sitting up on her high horse looking down on everyone else?<br><br>stop supporting the 1%</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why was episode 15 delayed?  <br>Recap.</br>  <br>because they had to air 14.5</br>  <br>yeah but Shinomiya is god-tier and he still "lost" to 2 country hicks. This IS shonen, you know.</br>  <br>they have to start at least narrowing the gap between her and everyone else, otherwise it'll just be another year of erina just being an ornament because she's so OP</br>  <br>his dish was unilaterally superior, everyone agreed on this. the only reason they tied was because they chose to "acknowledge" the sincerity of megumi's cooking. literally the power of friendship and shit. souma knew he lost hard from a pure cooking standpoint, which is why he hit the wall.</br>  I'd like to see Erina lose already, she's a bit too smug.  <br>she got better</br>  <br>She's so beyond everyone else she didn't take part in the autumn election out of respect to everyone else, because with her in it, she would have just steamrolled everyone else.</br>  <br>This. Until we actually see her going all out in detail, we can't know for sure how skilled she really is. They overhyped Alice just as badly, and look how she turned out at the Election.</br>  <br>she literally couldn't because she's already elite 10, which she never would have gotten if she wasn't the headmaster's granddaughter, so thank you for proving my point<br><br>besides, you're talking about pre-election erina. all characters have gone through that, plus stagiterrible, so you really couldn't say what the gap between their skill is</br></br></br>  <br>She didn't take part because she's oganizing the whole thig with Isshiki and Eizan.</br>  <br>I thought she didn't participe because she's in the top 10. Anyway she is established to be god tier at cooking, even if we haven't seen much it's obvious she's far ahead of everybody besides the other top members.</br>  <br> and look how she turned out at the Election. <br>you mean making one of the best tasting dishes shown in that arc, but losing by default on a technicality so that the MC gets to advance and alice gets some character development?</br></br>  what visible change does megumi becoming a waiter do for the restaurant  <br> you mean making one of the best tasting dishes shown in that arc <br>Stuff you can't prove.<br>Alice herself agreed her dish was worse, deal with it. If Souma's dish hadn't been at least as good, she would have won, disregarding the theme thing.</br></br></br>  <br>even putting lost in quotes, it's still inaccurate. He flat out won, unequivocally. Then he along with two other people who also weren't' judges basically were like "eh, good enough to not throw you out"</br>  <br>not him, but probably means the start of a steady downward streak between the elections, not appearing in stagitaire (probably because her big change to her assigned restaurant was offering free handjobs in the back alley), and royally fucking up in the festival so far.</br>  <br> which she never would have gotten if she wasn't the headmaster's granddaughter <br><br>Not that anon, but she is #10 because she's good enough to be #10. You can say, she is only that good because she's his granddaughter, but that's a roundabout excuse.</br></br></br>  <br> technicality <br>Nigga Soma's dish was just as delicious.</br></br>  <br>no, she's not only that good because she's his granddaughter, she was born with innate talent. <br><br>the difference is that her talent was acknowledged earlier than everyone else's because she got hooked up with some of the biggest names in cooking thanks to her family connections. because she got to establish a name for herself early on, it's just stuck with her. maybe if Hayama had gotten some of those same opportunities instead of growing up in a slum and developing serious mommy issues, he'd be an E10 too.</br></br></br>  <br>It has been said multiple times that Tootsuki is only about cooking and nothing else, if Erina were bad she wouldn't have gotten into the elite 10.</br>  <br>where did i say she was a bad cook? i'm not even saying she's necessarilly worse than anyone else. i'm saying she's probably closer to other first years than people think</br>  <br>perhaps, but he didn't, so he isn't as good. You can have unfair advantages that make you better, but in the end, you are still better, no matter how unfair it was.</br>  <br>Honestly, she's probably further than most people think. Between her and them, there's probably a handful of skilled third years and second years.</br>  soma would have won election if he watched this vid<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3GT<wbr>TXJKZ08Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> It has been said multiple times that Tootsuki is only about cooking and nothing else <br>That's not right. It's clear that they also give some focus to all the stuff that has to do with running a restaurant that doesn't relate directly to cooking.<br><br>Elite 10 people also have been shown to be running other stuff on the side: Eizan has his consulting, Erina her tasting, Isshiki has that school and the vegetable field. I bet that kind of thing figures into the decision to make someone an elite 10.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't really look like that yet, everytime her ability comes up it's said that she is a prodigy and incredibly good, I think it's fair to say she's far above every first year. Though it was also said that the gap between the elite 10 members and everybody else is huge so if Souma manages to beat the 8th soon your point might be correct.</br>  <br>but souma's already taking down second years in shokugeki, showing steady improvement. where are we seeing erina improve, or even TRY to improve? she didn't even take anything away from her stagitaire</br>  <br>Erina's always working anon. Other than when she got her manga, all she thinks about it cooking and trying out new recipes in her kitchen. This is established in the manga. And if she didn't take anything away from her stagiaire she would have failed it. Chapelle was clear that the passing criteria were leaving a lasting change and also taking away something for yourself. Everyone had to do both, even her.</br>  <br> walks into a kitchen and acts like a total cunt to the head chef <br><br>yeah, she seems super willing to learn</br></br></br>  <br>You can't learn from somebody who is way below your level.</br>  <br>most of the 'work' we see her doing is just tasting other people's food and shitting all over it</br>  <br>Every time I look at this it looks like someone dropped a banana peel on a lions head.</br>  <br> YFW Rindo is mute. <br> She expresses what she wants to say with her bento. </br></br>  <br>Most of what you see her do is a panel here or there of her standing over a pot or something. The specifics don't matter. It's just that it's established that she's constantly cooking. Hell, from Hisako we know she has like 6 different kitchens just for that.<br><br>Then of course she has work beyond that, which isn't directly cooking, but is related. We know she teaches cooking classes for instance. We know that yes, she has her tasting job, where she gets to experience both the best and I imagine some of the more experimental cuisine the the top of the Japanese gourmet world concocts.<br><br>Which quite frankly, gives her some experience that no one else there is getting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>She is working at her cooking same as everybody else. I believe the stagnation angle will come, but it's not going to be just because she's not doing anything, but because she isn't absorbing knowledge from anybody else. She's just alone, doing her own thing, and it's been foreshadowed that that shit just don't fly.<br><br>Imagine trying to learn to draw, but being unable to read any guides or tutorials or look at anybody else's art. I'm sure you could do it just drawing from life if you were some kind of genius, but your growth would be severely stunted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's reasoning here.<br>Bento sure have the capability and tendency to express one self.They often have motifs or cute designs.</br></br>  God tier:<br>Senzaemon Nakiri (?)<br>Jouchirou Yukihira (Saiba)<br>Gin Dojima<br><br>Demigod tier:<br>Kojirou Shinomiya<br><br>Top tier:<br>Roland Chapelle (?)<br>Fuyumi Mizuhara<br>Hinako Inui<br>Hitoshi Sekimori<br>Donato Gotouda<br>Taki Tsunozaki<br>Sonoka Kikuchi<br>Jun Shiomi (?)<br><br>Very High tier:<br>Eishi Tsukasa<br>Rindou Kobayashi<br>Fuyusuke Megijima<br>Momo Akanegakubo<br>Soumei Saitou<br><br>High tier:<br>Nene Kinokuniya<br>Satoshi Isshiki<br>Terunori Kuga<br>Etsuya Eizan<br>Erina Nakiri<br><br>Mid-High tier:<br>Akira Hayama <br>Ryo Kurokiba<br>Souma Yukihira<br>Abel (?)<br>Alice Nakiri<br>Subaru Mimisaka<br><br>Mid tier:<br>Kasayama (?)<br>Lucie Hugo (?)<br>Gao Wei (?)<br>Hisako Arato<br>Takumi Aldini<br>Megumi Tadokoro<br><br>Low-mid tier:<br>Shun Ibusaki<br>Zenji Marui<br>Tetsuji Kabutoyama<br><br>Low tier:<br>Isami Aldini<br>Miyuko Hojo<br>Ikumi Mito<br>Yuki Yoshino<br>Ryoko Sakaki<br><br>Trash tier:<br>Nao Sadatsuka<br><br>Below trash tier:<br>Kiyoshi Goudabayashi<br>Kanichi Konishi<br>Daigo Aoki<br>Shouji Satou<br>Madoka Enomoto<br><br>Special tier:<br>Urara Kawashima<br>Yua Sasaki<br>Mitsuru Soutsuda</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe you wasted all that time creating such a horrible list. errors everywhere, I don't even know how to respond.</br>  OFFICIAL Shit Characters consensus:<br><br>Erina<br>Megumi<br>Meat<br>Ibusaki</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically, whoever made the bento could indicate they are fond of cute things.<br><br>Might also be Momo seeing she's carrying around her plushie.</br></br></br>  <br> Below trash tier: <br> Daigo Aoki <br> Shouji Satou <br>I can't wait for the day when they actually get some development and it turns out that in the right situation, they can make E10-tier cooking</br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem is that as has been mentioned, she's constantly experiencing other people's cooking. Moreover, it's not just experiencing the food of top chefs from all over the country.<br><br>She's not even ignoring her classmates. We know she went and made an effort to see all of Souma's matches in the election. She was even chagrined when Isshiki explained to her how Souma arrived at his prelim dish and she realized her earlier mistake. And he's not the only one who surprised her.

The manga correctly acknowledged that spicy isn't a taste, but is a sensation of pain. I don't think Erina's supertasting is supposed to extend to pain receptors, so reasonably, it shouldn't really have more of an effect on her.<br><br>I'm pretty sure she has tasted his food though, since she made a direct comparison when Souma brought his dish for her to taste.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate puns but that was good.</br>    <br>okay fuck you, now I have milk up my nose</br>  <br><br><br><br>Fucking delusional Erina haters<br><br>Erina is known for smacking down anyone who opposes her with her skills<br><br>She couldn't even take part in the autumn selection because it would've been lol easy<br><br>Keep throwing rocks at the throne, peasants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>half those posts have nothing to do with erina</br>  <br>who is she again</br>  I want to be Alice and get cummed inside.  <br>a new twist on a classic!</br>  <br> self-inserting as the girl instead <br>glad I'm not the only one<br><br>Hishoko is more to my taste though</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does she look like a monkey?</br>  <br> 15 years old <br>she looks like a fucking porn actress</br></br>  <br>Based Tosh</br>  <br> 15 years old <br> 15 <br> 1 5 <br> ichi go <br> ichigo <br> strawberry <br>I'd strawberry my dick so far inside her god's tongue that whoever could pull it out would get 1st seat on the elite ten.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nakiri genes are top tier<br><br>Only rivaled by Ikumi genes</br></br></br>  <br>Why does she always look better when in tight-fitting clothing that covers her body rather than her typical shorts-and-bikini look?

It's not much to go on, and for all we know she could just really hate Yugi, but at least it's better than how she was before.</br>  <br>That's only among the 2nd years, you retard. We weren't privy to how the 3rd years are, in that respect. Erina also wasn't part of Megumi's assessment.<br><br>Learn to read properly, you dork.</br></br></br>  <br>Isshiki likes them</br>  <br>I don't think it has anything to do with her hating Yugi; Erina subconsciously wants him to do well. Its such an astounding change to the days of her wanting him to get expelled.<br><br>Read the atmosphere; she's sincere in what she said.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not that she hates Yugi it's that she wants Souma to succeed</br></br>  <br>Dude what? I am asking because I was reading the thread.<br><br>Maybe instead of hating Yugi she may just like Souma more now? I know this sounds crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>She didn't cheer for him; she told him to focus on beating him. Which is definitely weird. At best you'd expect her to tell him to focus on not getting expelled.</br>  <br>Don't be stupid. She's just showing concern for her fellow 1st years.<br><br>If not, she wouldn't even have bothered to chair that meeting.</br></br></br>  <br>Weird in what sense? Tsukuda-sensei already mentioned the Elections changed her opinion of him greatly.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's probably just me being cynical about her character development. I hate it when authors bait-and-switch with that shit.</br>  <br> my vote put Takumi on the first place, tied with Hisako <br>And everything was right in the world. Also surprised it wasn't invaded by the bot yet.</br></br>  <br>Read<br/></br>  <br>Don't be stupid. She would have never shown concern for Souma before.</br>  <br>You said she now likes Souma, you fucktard.<br><br>Where the fuck did you even get that from?</br></br></br>  <br>What are you even trying to say?</br>  <br><br>Without giving too much away, it has to do with fundamental rules a chef lives by and personal duty.

Megumi and the reporter-fuccboi hasnt been shown together in a panel/page yet.  <br> 2 votes for childhood friend <br>What are you people doing?</br></br>  <br>No I know that. But he still annoys her. It's obvious she doesn't want him expelled anymore, but it's quite a jump from there to thinking he should actually succeed in his crazy plan.</br>  nakiri derena = errina + more shoujo manga  Do series ever reference specific shoujo manga?

(some donuts, cakes, and other kinds of bread I think)<br><br>Shun kinda sees himself on the new kid and basically all he ends up doing is things that will help him make friends.<br><br>I think Shun ends up making a tomato based sweet and he ends up getting the other kids to get along with the new kid by letting him repair one of the other kids console.<br><br>Thanks to some dialogs with Ryouko and the whole new kid thing, Shun has some sort of enlightment on how he tries to keep cool instead of just being honest to his feelings and be more reckless.<br><br>So yeah, we confirm Shun has some sort of rivalry with Satoshi and that Ryouko likes him. (well, we only get a glimpse of the second, it's not confirmed until the Vietnam chapter of the third novel)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> by Eru13 <br>Is he the one translating the novels?</br></br>  <br>Aldini bros best boys</br>  i bet bianca will never get a name mention in the manga  <br>IDK</br>  <br>  So yeah, we confirm Shun has some sort of rivalry with Satoshi and that Ryouko likes him <br>  Ryouko likes him <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>No that's me.</br>  <br>No actually that's me.</br>  <br>I don't think so, you ruffian.</br>  <br>Based anon</br>  <br> ãã <br>Anon please, we're dealing with English here.</br></br>  <br>Sorry but I'm a colossal faggot</br>  <br>Pfft, you just saved my screenshot of my work that uses Deep Black for the program.</br>  <br>Wait, when did it happen in the anime?</br>    <br>https://www.fanfiction.net/</br>  Isobe: I am Isobe Isobee!

Is it the lolis? <br><br>Entry level anime for most of us, were either shounen or harem shows. Those two genres always have a teenager for the self-insert MC, as shounen" implies its audience to be. But over time, we broaden our horizon. <br>Anons start to seek other genres and eventually they find moe/SoL.<br>At first we think it's just slow-paced shows coated with sugar for sissies. Then, we gradually start to enjoy it. Why does that change happens?<br><br>My bet is because of maturity. <br>Lewdness and lolicon apart, at first, one might think that happens because of the men's paternal instinct that increases while they get older. But that instinct may be influenced by something more that's brought by maturity.<br><br>1/2</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naru is a Miracle of the Universe, dude!<br>What are you talking about?</br></br>   what makes people watch SoL <br>I ironically watched the first episode of K-On! one night and completely fell in love with the genre. It's my favourite show to date. I was a hardcore manime faggot for years beforehand.</br>   why do people watch SoL <br><br>Escaping from their shitty lives and watching some chink drawing live a nice and fulfilling one. Fuck.</br></br>  Didnt read  <br>I watch moe/SoL shows and read mostly moe/SoL manga, because :<br>1. young girls are often featured<br>2. a lot of it is cute and non-confrontational<br>3. idealistic characters you actually care about <br>4. focus on the little things<br><br>Pretty much everything I enjoy in real life but only extremely rarely get to enjoy, what with all of the shit in the adult world trying its best to allow a man to lead his own, simple life. Contrast the above for with "Real Life": <br>1. cute young girls are illegal and even then are mostly annoying; women and even men my age are either braindead, obnoxious, fucking irritating, normies, or lack any interests or passions outside of watching TV and working shitty pointless jobs<br>2. most of it is ugly, pig-ignorant and in your face at every fucking turn<br>3. billions of people but very few with the sort of character appealing to want to be around<br>4. focus is always large and obscures everything else<br><br>The lolis for my dick; settings for my mind; characters for my heart. Spend a few decades trying to fill your role in society and please the unappeasable and you'll start to appreciate the Iyashikei elements common in these manga and their adaptations. There is a reason why these sort of shows, etc. are viewed upon as a problem by the elderly and in power: they are driven by looking inwards as opposed to trying to motivate teenagers and adults into projecting outwards and into society. They generate an intrinsically individual response. Over the generations all of these sorts of things which young men were able to escape into and enjoy in private were dangerous to the stability of a society which demanded young men become disposable workers for the state and corporate cattle. <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128103717#p128117029">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/661<wbr>91#more<br><br>http://www.production-ace.co.jp/kid<wbr>s/<br><br> Kadokawa joined with Amusement Media Academy (Production Ace) to open a voice acting school for elementary &amp; junior high school student.
