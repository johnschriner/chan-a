[ Post transformations.    <br>That transformation felt way less badass than it should have been, probably because it was a rushed bullshit ending when Psyren was still ,basically, in it's infancy.</br>  H E<br>E</br>  <br>I still don't understand why this wasn't popular.</br>  <br>That's pretty fucking cool, OP.</br>    <br>Man, I remember having to do a double take when Ageha text changes cuz he lost his shit.<br>Chapter was so FUCKING satisfying.</br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah Psyren.</br>  <br>Because it was the bastard child between Gantz and Bleach.</br>    <br>It then deviated from 'Gantz for kids' to some random bullshit storyline about the future which caused Psyren's popularity to tank and ultimately get cancelled.</br>    <br>The best transformation scene for me will always be Wargreymon's shinka.<br><br>It has better computer animation than most modern anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do future arcs always have to suck? Reborn suffered heavily after it.</br>    <br>For appreciation.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FQU<wbr>cJMQX1RM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I dropped Reborn when that faggot who was connected with the multiverse appeared.</br>  New one tomorrow.  <br>I'm not even angry, just sad at the potential that was lost. Psyren's MC's friends barely got developed and had to be hastily reintroduced (From fucking purgatory or something because they were barely in the manga even though they were the 'supporting' characters.) for the rushed final arc. <br><br>The Manga barely got started and the author had to fuck it up by trying to be clever, wasn't the story that the gantz wasteland they went was earth future or something? Fucking trash-tier plot.</br></br></br>  <br>This looks like something out of a PS2 game dude</br>  <br>It was made in 1999 using a kid's show budget. It's low poly, but the quality of the entire thing is pretty impressive.<br><br>There's the entire composition aspect, too. The music, the battles themselves, the effects. It's not just cool, it's motherfucking Wargraymon.</br></br></br>   You will never transform into a magical shota god     <br>shit, what is this from again? I read it so long ago and my mind is now drawing a blank</br>  <br>I can feel the Edge</br>  <br>Yu Yu Hakusho</br>  <br>It's from Yuyu Reverseimagesearchityoufaggot</br>  <br>why the heck they are so obsess with biri? isnt there other level 5 they can mess with aside from accel kun?</br>  <br>You talking shit about my best boy with trauma?</br>  <br>good luck trying to mess with Rank 2. so by progression, Rank 3 is the next in the experiment line.</br>  <br>Mikoto's more convenient. Unlike the other Level 5s, she has a far more accessible means of achieving a level up. By connecting with the 10,000 Sisters of the Misaka Network, she can become a monster.</br>  <br>welp im gonna go read this right the fuck now</br>  <br>of course i can, i only have to get inside a tower and get everything inside of it rekt, then talk to a giant smurf to obtain his money and magical shit while being returned to the outside in a lightning elevator with a weird ass looking blue hair kid</br>  <br>Full house demands it, everyone go read Psyren now</br>  <br>Again, for the third time?</br>    <br>Why was he so mad?</br>        <br> ribbons  <br>for what purpose</br></br>        <br>Is that really what caught your attention</br>  Nearly every transformation in Claymore   Most of these transformations are just people turning black and going berserk   <br> turning black <br> going berserk <br>Well...</br></br></br>  God tier coming through  <br>Rather go berserk than go KFC</br>    <br>Is that a Devilman ripoff?</br>  Why is Maka such a goddess?  <br>Oh you</br>    <br> implying a berserk transformation isn't the best trope ever </br>  <br>what he said.</br>  <br>The world needs more calm/zen transformations.<br> everyone expects the person to get super fucking mad and shit <br> person just gets extremely tranquil and wrecks even more shit </br></br></br>  <br>Isnt final form frieza felt calm initially? As the they mentioned he looked smaller and less scary</br>  <br>Kinda happened with SSJ god</br>   :^)   <br>I don't hate it, but I'd prefer they have a more interesting design than just "Let's make him black and give him claws and a tail and shit"</br>    <br>Ah yeah that too</br>  <br>Based DS.<br><br><br>Takimitsu Zamurai is my all time favorite. It's so incredible in all kinds of ways.</br></br></br></br>  <br> gorillawarfare.jpg </br>  <br>That was my problem with the second half of pic related's fight. The penultimate power up had Hendricksen completely silently wrecking shit left and right. Then he powers up again and suddenly starts shit talking (and subsequently losing his composure completely). Despite being much more powerful, he came off as much less intimidating.</br>  Greatest MC of all time.  <br> still no Needless 2 </br>  <br>by the amount of destruction that happens during that battle you would say its a man of steel rip off</br>      <br>yea rip of</br>    <br>he got to be tens of times stronger than moka and still never got a proper end for his harem</br>  <br>I need to rewatch the anime.</br>  <br>what did you wanted?<br>that he  choose a girl? </br></br>  <br>There aren't subs for most episodes, everyone says the dub is better but I don't get why</br>    <br>his first kiss was kurumu but still everyone knows that kurumu ended with mizore, the loli witch ended with the chinese guy, the mature witch with the werewolf, and the zombie was only a temporal member of the harem, he should have stayed with iner moka, even in the epilogue doesnt do shit even though the dad of moka said to not choose polygam because that was what hated mokas mother</br>    <br>forgot pic related</br>  <br> mfw I got exactly what i wished for at the end of that manga </br>  <br>I love the way Jinka  turned into the antagonist  for the second arc.</br>        <br>I still found it funny that inner Moka was turning into her mother by the end.</br>  <br>Transformed into a dead body right</br>  <br>They switched  the protagonist and antagonist completely.  I didn't think I'd like Senya at first, but Mizukami does a good job at writing likable characters.</br>    <br>better do that that get NTR'ed</br>  <br>which chapter did she first transform?<br>I'm not a bleach fan but a Rukia fan.</br></br>  <br>Same here. In fact, I wasn't hyped about the "new" cast at all. <br><br><br>I was absolutely wrong.</br></br></br></br>    <br>It looks like she's guiding a big black dick into her.</br>      <br>And then he went full kamen raider and saved the day with the power of friendship. FUCKING TRASH</br>  <br>Used good  but still pure </br>    <br>I liked White Swan oversoul</br>      <br>Superior transofrmation coming through</br>  <br>that's her youkai tail but she does want the D</br>    <br>Pillar Man did that pose better.</br>  <br>Please no, I hate remembering this series.</br>    /thread      <br>And that's supposed to be bad, underage retard?</br>  <br><br>the real question is, why was the series cancelled I thought it was doing quite well</br></br>    Well, mentally, at least.    <br> Yaoi head </br>  <br> By connecting with the 10,000 Sisters of the Misaka Network, she can become a monster <br><br>I was so sure that they were going to do an asspull and say, "LOL THAT WAS THE LEVEL 6 SHIFT PROJECT ALL ALONG RETARDS"<br><br>could still happen<br><br>would be stupid</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br>Clothes also change?</br>    <br>Asura's Wrath did this well initially with the final battle transitioning from the golden god chakravartin to the silver/black form.</br>  <br>No, just the size and shape of the body wearing them.</br>  seeing this in a thread a while back led me to one of my favorite fighting manga  <br>reminds me of the final scene of akira</br>    <br>This and Garou's Progression as a monster are gonna be amazing once Murata gets there.</br>  <br>Continuation never.</br>  <br>I hope you're trolling<br><br>New Waves updates at Berserk speed though</br></br></br>  <br>You know, I didn't think I'd be this happy about this series coming back, but I am.<br><br>The writing is confounded as shit as always but still.</br></br></br>    <br>New waves ended dude.</br>  <br>I didn't think /a/ read this</br>  bruh   I still have to get around to finishing this.      <br> I thought <br>There's your problem right there. No, this series didn't do well in fact it was one of the lowest ranking/selling series at the time. Long story short, Japan has shit tast. Its a well known fact sadly.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's because they change a lot of the cultural jokes to fit in with the fact that it's a dub and surprisingly it actually doesn't feel like they are just terribly trying to localize it. I remember one of the first episodes has him filling out a survey and originally the joke was something like he didn't understand the question correctly, but in the dub they had it play out that the page was filled with just a bunch of random squiggles, and so he just draws a picture for the answer. Also maybe the fact that Bobobo with a black guys voice is a perfect match.</br>    <br>Are those skin flaps?</br>  <br> Romance consisting of main girl, timeskip girl, and main girl:dark edition <br> Cancelled <br>Two bombs were not enough it seems.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It becomes kinda weird</br></br>  Edge king.  <br>It's been a long time, my backlog is heavy, but I might...just...go for the third read.</br>  <br>God Hoshino can pull this god like art. Why the fuck she needs to go full bishi way? Man i'm fine with forever release but please turn back to the way it was. 100-170 D.Gray-Man is the pinnacle of her career...</br>  <br>I tried to get into it, but after getting invested in the prequel, I couldn't deal with how drastically shit changed with no notice. Is it worth reading?</br>  <br> not having duel wield at the top </br>  <br><br>I felt the same way but a significant way into Cavalier I started to enjoy it quite a bit.<br><br>Xyx is still a worthless pile of shit, but the dragon kid is pretty cool and I'm not sure what Caladbolg / Jae Hoon is up to. By worthless I mean he still has yet to really do much of anything, and he's just kinda on the sidelines at all times.<br><br>Princess and Xyx's half dragon sister are pretty cool, though.<br><br>I feel manwha introduce way too many inconsequential characters and they just flood the roster, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im re-reading it and I'd have to agree with japans shit taste, it seems like everyone was getting too strong too fast, especially that idol, he seemed like a self insert.</br>    Idk if its been posted <br><br>But that one manga with the edgy faggot that can only level up for a short time by killing his party members had a pretty cool transformation<br><br>The name escapes me</br></br></br></br>   Wild ARMs is kinda /a/ related.   <br>I haven't really read this since it switched from weekly to monthly. The sudden change in artstyle didn't help.</br>  <br>How did that go? Beginning of New Waves was awful so I dropped it, and I'm certainly not going to read all those chapters, but people seemed pretty bummed part 2 ended.</br>  <br>about 1/3 through new waves it gets good again.</br>  <br>MC actually became alpha as fuck to make up for the lack of his master</br>  <br>Not at all but excellent taste regardless.</br>  <br>I don't think you can top this.</br>  <br>What was the plan on controlling a 6?</br>  <br> dragon kid is pretty cool <br>I hope you're not talking about ninImgoingtolettheworldburnbecausei<wbr>mafuckingspoiledgaylittleshitoorta because if you do then kill yourself</wbr></br></br>  <br>I can't remember much since I haven't read Psyren in a long time but, I do remember when people were taking noticed of Psyren's sells and rankings 2 or 3 years before it was cancelled and how it was getting lower and lower. So I'm sure even the artist knew it was failing aswell. He had to have been trying to rush atleast the last 100 or so before he got the end notice. That's why it felt like it was going fast and then rush ending chapters. Atleast that's my theory.</br>  <br><br>WELP IT'S ON THE BACKLOG NOW</br></br>  The hero the world needed, but didn't deserve.  <br><br>simple and beautiful</br></br>  <br>So was that like a one-time thing?</br>  <br>the series is only 140 chapters, so he cant have rushed 100 chapters, also the huge increase in power starts right after they return, learning rise in just a day and the idol learning it on his first try. How could they get on par of the kids who trained their entire lives in the span of a few months? I liked the kids since they got strong over a time period but the MC and his friends were bullshit.</br>  super saiyan 5  <br>Not him but if it makes you feel better you do get to see Nin suffer.</br>  <br>monthly</br>  <br> 140 chapters <br>Oh damn, I clearly don't remember anything about the seires then. I thought it ran longer than that for some reason</br></br>  <br>god damn it was fun following that and seeing people go crazy.<br>to bad it all died off. haven't bothered to check but I assume it was due in part to author confirming that Anime garbage was cannon, and stuff stagnating.</br></br>  <br>I mean, it's sort of a transformation</br>  <br>Honestly the new chapter that was recently released showed that her art has significantly improved. Now she can definitely draw realistic seen from some of her pics on her Instagram, but the problem is that it takes a lot of effort. Plus damaging her hand really bad ain't worth it.</br>  <br>weak.</br>    <br>Takes me back</br>      <br>yup, what a shame, haven't had that much on /a/ since the KLKbowl</br>  <br> duel wield <br> duel </br></br>    <br>His transformation ended up shit though.</br>      <br>This one was so fucking hype</br>    <br>dem thighs</br>  <br>No wonder why kids love edge shit these days</br>  Move aside casuals try hards.  <br>It's never was the case for her since  she's going to transform again </br>  <br>That's hot.</br>    <br><br><br><br>Holy shit, fuck off. Shit manga</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same with me, also I've seen enough porn sadly to see flaws and get triggered so hard.</br>    <br>Psyren was fucking cool.<br><br>I like how his "complete 'possessive' overall" transformation didn't occur until the very ass-end of the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the manga it self was fine even in the beginning, but the sequel is utterly shit.</br>  <br>Holy shit, fuck off. Shit opinion<br> Now, seriously, OP didnt ask for great manga or even great transformations so by your post I assume that TG really triggers your autism, huh, anon? </br></br>  <br>But he turns into that becuase<br> WHAT DID YOU SAY!??! you called this bitch who has sent me to the future multiple times almost killing me each time and is a complete bitch and you said shes useless!??!?!?! AGHHHHHHH!!! </br></br>  <br>No. You just showing your cancer everywhere, even fucking reposting the same shit. TGfags are shit.</br>  The best.   <br>Heh.</br>   <br>Don't get your hopes up.<br><br>The author and illustrator got "tired" of Breaker so it MIGHT continue in 2-3 years,at best.</br></br></br>  <br>what the fyck. <br>u gotta finish reading this</br></br>  Warning: Horror.  <br>Fair enough. At least it was saved until the end.<br><br>Too bad we never got to find out how the series was supposed to originally end.</br></br></br>  <br>best horror</br>    <br>Edgy.</br>  http://a.pomf.se/igbcmw.mp4<br><br>Manga Incursio evolution was posted and was better, but this was still cool despite the anime being shit overall. Well, the transformation itself, at least.</br></br>  <br>Salt flats will always be the best scenery for motivational speeches or battles, I refuse to accept any other position on the matter</br>  <br>Ok anon, I'm ESL and pretty drunk right now so let me get this straight.<br>Some anons posted a couple of TG related pics  I posted  and fucked off right after, but it's not my fucking fault that  posted the same image that I did several hours earlier.  and that was enough to trigger your autism?<br><br>Ok</br></br></br></br>    <br>I hope Pete gets a happy ending.</br>  <br>Too bad most of it will be taken up by Garou's rants.<br><br>Seriously they went on for so long, I get that Saitama shut him up in the end but the effect was felt. They dragged it down.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Huh. Anyway mangafags are the most retarded faggots I ever witness.</br></br>  <br>what?</br>      <br>I think he was referring to her left foot.</br>     <br> Mangafags are the most retarded faggots I ever witness. <br>So practically 3/4 of /a/?<br> Oh, are you talking about TG Mangafags? <br> Oh yeah, we're a bunch of faggots </br></br></br></br>    <br>Well Yeah. But I talking about all of you as whole mangafags and stop fucking spoilering you hurting my shit.</br>    <br>Is it bad that I can hear the song play in my head when I watch this?</br>  <br>Yes, I have realized after posting. It was a shameful display.</br>  <br>So I assume that actor is the original Kamen Raider?</br>    <br>Yeah, you need to go to slee128511225p now, anon<br>Cause even when I'm an ESL myself<br> your English/typing is hurting my shit. <br> Sleep tight, anon. </br></br></br></br>      <br>Yep. He's also Segata Sanshiro.</br>  <br>Woah I fucked up really bad there <br>I guess it's time to sleep for me too, right  ?</br></br>  <br>beserk hollow ichigo was the only interesting one, transformations are boring unless they come at a price</br>    <br> every anime transformation has to have wings <br><br>Fucking why, fuck off Japan.</br></br></br>      <br><br><br><br>NANI SURU MONO ZO<br>SHINFOGIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the first time he transformed all the way back in part 1 was hype as fuck</br>  <br>this</br>  <br> Pfffffffftttt </br>  <br> It wasn't alredy on the backlog <br>shit got hype.</br></br>  Daily reminder for colorblind people, Lala is exactly how she looks in the manga.<br><br>If you guys want to read ch35 with a summary made by TF use the archive (128480321)<br><br><br>Reminder:<br> Report and ignore the shitposters <br> Keep the thread clean </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to  bully  Lala.

Her attraction to Darling seems to be primarily as a sex-based dalliance to have fun with rather than an actual romantic relationship. That may change in the future, but that's what I've perceived in the manga so far. Also, Rachnera makes me detect some major slut-vibes. She really doesn't seem like the kind of woman who cares who she ties up, so don't confuse that behavior as a show of any real affection.<br><br>And Darling has  good taste  because of this, because  Cera decent girl, Rach good girl, but Miia best girl .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh hey, everyone!<br><br>Look what I have!</br></br>  <br> no legs <br> awful personality <br> slut <br>I guess people are just too picky about what they want for the mother of their children.</br></br></br></br>  Now, this is probably not going to be a common occurence, but because we got nice-ish scans today, we decided to slap something together.

Since they were generally already uncomfortable with her, being a spider.<br><br>If you'll notice, the kind of skimpy clothes she used to wear and the kind of skimpy clothes she wears now are pretty different. Now, her skimpy clothes are usually more comfortable.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> no butt shot of Papi in the cute swim suit <br>unforgivable. At least she makes some cute faces</br></br></br></br></br>   every girl got a chapter about their families <br> Suu won't get any </br>  <br>Right, let me correct it then.<br><br> Dressing like a slut to get the attention of this ONE guy she met like two days ago is something I'd expect from Miia </br></br></br>  <br>More chapters for darlingbowl contestants. Whats there to cry about?</br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br><br>She doesn't need one.<br><br>Slimes likely don't posses the same psychological needs for validation from parents that regular life-forms do.</br></br></br></br>  <br> every girl got a chapter about their families <br>Rachnee and Lala haven't, and Mero's getting a whole arc, putting the main three to shame.</br></br>  <br> Rach's thighs <br>Shit, that's new.

Certainly like it more than what we have in the show.</br></br>  <br><br> Chapter where it's revealed Smith has registered herself as Suu's adoptive mother. <br> &gt;"I was just filling in the forms late at night and put my name in the wrong box, really." </br></br></br>  <br><br> Dressing like a slut to please the Man she loves and basically wants to spend her life with is something I'd expect from Miia. <br><br>Fixed for you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> met <br> two days ago <br>found the animeonly fag.</br></br></br>  <br> Rachnee <br> family </br></br>  <br><br> Rachnee and Lala haven't <br><br>Lala is a supernatural being likely born out of the supernatural ether as an adult entity with no real history or childhood.<br><br>I seriously doubt that Dulahans actually live together in families or procreate biologically.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Smith and Suu doing mother/daughter stuffs <br>Crabman pls, I need this.</br></br>  <br><br>If she was going to bother doing that she wouldn't have just dumped Suu on Darling.</br></br>  <br> I seriously doubt that Dulahans actually live together in families or procreate biologically. <br><br>If they don't need sex then why they got a FUCK hole?</br></br></br>  <br>spiderfag pls</br>  <br>What if she finds a nicer guy, who gives her a more expensive blanket? I mean, for all we know it's really easy to make her love you, so she could have tons of potential people she wants to spend the rest of her life with.</br>  <br>I guess that's better than her eating her mom.</br>  <br>I don't have a problem with the swimsuit, I think it fits her, but I'm honestly not a fan of a lot of her normal clothes. The stuff she wears isn't way beyond what's even remotely acceptable in public. Everyone else dresses pretty normally, if a bit weird in Mero's case, or a bit skimpily in Papi's or Miia's, but Rach constantly wears these things that look like something out of a super hero comic. She looks far sexier when she's just wearing say, a loosely buttoned dress shirt, or something a bit more reasonable.</br>  <br><br>Crabman giveth and the Crabman taketh away.<br><br>We will never get Smith/Suu Shenanigans just as we will never get Bike Cop and Wolf-Girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> What if she finds a nicer guy, who gives her a more expensive blanket? <br><br>You really think that's the ONLY reason she likes Darling?<br>That exchange was a symptom of the real reason, not the reason itself, that Miia loves Darling.</br></br></br></br></br>  Do Laminas even have cloacas? Having a cloaca implies there are male Laminas and there aren't. Laminas need Human males to mate, so this must mean that they have human vaginas.  <br>How much time do you think it passed between the first chapter and the chapter she wears the skimpy bikini to impress Darling?</br>      <br><br>You sure she's doing it for attention?<br><br>Maybe she just likes how she looks in that kind of outfit, and her negative past experiences with humans has led her to not really care if people think it looks indecent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the real reason then?</br>  <br>depends on the writer<br>crabman has vaginas <br>there are others w/ cloaca, like that one doujin I dont feel like looking up<br><br><br>moe trash</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Her weird lace-fringed top she wore more in the earlier is the one that bugs me.<br>It's really weird-looking and it screams "HEY! HEY! LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!" about the person that wears it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>We have only had one Full Moon chapter, which implies everything from Chapter 1 to Chapter 35 has occurred in less than 28 days.<br><br><br><br>I want to fuck that fish!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her vagina is at the very bottom of the front of her human part, where she wears her panties. Darling accidentally fingers her there in the shedding chapter if I remember right.</br>  <br> We have only had one Full Moon chapter, which implies everything from Chapter 1 to Chapter 35 has occurred in less than 28 days <br>Correct.

Maybe she's fat? But that's meaningless, cute or not, our debt remains the same.<br><br>No matter who she is, she's the translator /a/ needs, if not the one it deserves. So we'll creep her out. Because she can take it. Because she's not our waifu. She's a silent cleaner. A watchful editor.

The bottom to it I don't mind, it makes sense with her character and her body having something like that, but the top is just ridiculous. <br><br>I suppose there's at least the justification that she likely makes a lot of her own clothes, and rarely ventures outside of the house, and most of the time she does leave the house she stays hidden and is a secret observer.<br><br>Shit, now that I think of it, she's really done that a lot. She probably follows Darling around outside without his knowing a ton.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> https://twitter.com/foorina/status<wbr>/623674554901135361</wbr> <br><br>No problem.

Female selkies are said to make excellent wives, but because their true home is the sea, they will often be seen gazing longingly at the ocean. If she finds her skin she will immediately return to her true home, and sometimes to her selkie husband, in the sea. Sometimes, a selkie maiden is taken as a wife by a human man and she has several children by him. In these stories, it is one of her children who discovers her sealskin (often unwitting of its significance) and she soon returns to the sea. The selkie woman usually avoids seeing her human husband again but is sometimes shown visiting her children and playing with them in the waves. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> She buys outfits whole <br><br>I would have assumed that there were many retailers for Mermaids and she wouldn't have to buy from human vendors.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Since Darling is known to alter the clothing of the girls for them, that would be logical</br>  <br><br> Embarrass her dom daughter with baby pictures <br><br>I like how you think anon</br></br></br></br>  <br> How do you cook yours?

A touch of salt and sugar, spritz a little citrus over it. Also, might want to parboil prior to grilling. Makes the cartilage a little easier to chew.</br>  <br>Huh. I've always had my stingray at restaurants because I can't cook for my life, but I'll check out your tips.</br>  <br><br><br>Or here's Wikipedia for more info.<br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam<wbr>bal_stingray<br><br>They use spice, but I usually order mine unspiced, so it's more salty, and I get a little fishier flavor.

I don't recall them saying any particular "Species" specifically.</br>  <br>While most female Latrodectus spiders do only live for one year and die during the winter that their brood hatches many they have the capacity to live up to three years and reproduce 2 or 3 times before they die.</br>  <br><br> American Wolf-Girl <br> She speaks perfect English in the Japanese release, with occasional broken Japanese. <br><br> This is literally one of my #1 favorite things I like to see in anime/manga, holy shit. <br><br><br><br>Only if she is the night.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reading over Chapter 1 again makes me think you're right, it mentions the various species have integrated into Human society but it doesn't make any mention of which, it just shows images of bunny-girls doing the Playboy thing, Wolf-girls in uniform, etc.<br><br>Still, most of Darling's homestays seem like fringe cases on account of us seeing how they're pretty... Well, difficult to integrate on a cultural or racial basis. Mero is the only one that seems like she should've been fully integrated, and she has, in fact this seems more like a vacation to her than a cultural exchange.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just wanted an excuse to mispronounce his name.</br>  <br>I think when they say that they've been integrated into society, it just means that they've largely been accepted by society. They probably all still have hosts regardless of species, but have been able to lead otherwise normal lives.</br>  <br> &gt;She speaks perfect English in the Japanese release, with occasional broken Japanese. <br>That'd be pretty cool.</br></br>  Pick one    <br>Too much best girl for one girl</br>  Why is this shit so god damn funny?<br>http://exhentai.org/s/ff9ee69903/11<wbr>4295-11</wbr></br>  <br><br><br> Akita <br> Beagle <br> German Shepherd <br> Siberian Husky <br><br> German Shepherd is best and most suited for police-work. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this french bias <br><br>Jes suis fuck me.</br></br></br>  where was Lala this chapter  <br> French Poodles </br>  <br><br><br>Where's the American Golden Retriever?</br></br></br>  <br>more like any chapter amirite</br>  <br>She'll nonchalantly show up at some point I'm sure.</br>  <br><br> no Labrador Retriever  <br>  no Airedale </br></br></br>  <br> Labrador <br>Labradors are pretty dumb anyway.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd like to see an Aussie Blue Heeler</br></br>  <br>I'm late, but you *always* need the filler girl for a good harem.

It doesn't matter how old the artist makes them as long as the judge thinks it "look like a child" it's illegal.</br>  <br> Out of nowhere <br>Is because Bruce Lee's 75th aniversary(1940-2015), you illiterate moron</br></br>  fuck those prices and DX versions.  Received more idols today. How many more can we expect for wonfes?  <br>Who the fuck is Bruce Lee that I need to celebrate his 75th birthday?</br>  <br>Too many.</br>    <br> Maki <br>No thanks. You can keep that card.</br></br>  Anyone just consider stopping buying figures minus their waifu and just buying other merchandise? I feel like one get's to a point where they have too many figures to enjoy them all.    <br>I this going to be a figure? I want it.</br>  <br>MUST BUY<br> So that my Haruna can squeeze her to death </br></br>  <br>Fuck off retard</br>  <br>Celebrities are the easiest things to search for on Google.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure that one was a GK. I will dig up where I found it to make sure. There is still the 1/10 that megahouse will be making.</br>  <br>Think their will be a mage that's not cast off?</br>  <br>Nendo facial hair is odd</br>  <br>I really don't think so that would make no sense at all.</br>  <br>Nice, I wonder how long until we get her.</br>  Will Illya be up for preorder tomorrow?  <br>I thought GReco was shit? All I ever see is people complaining about it.</br>  <br><br>I see the STD/DX version, release date and scale, but not a price.</br></br>  <br>People with shit taste.</br>  <br>More idols than my wallet would like probably</br>  <br>Extra torso also most probably limited+exclusive, do you want to guess the price?</br>  <br>It was shit.</br>   otakumode still hasn't restocked the mushishi art book <br>Fucking cunts.</br>  Today is a good day.  So do you guys think this is all we'll be getting to see monmusu related besides maybe the Miia daki?<br>I hope we see a scale or something</br>  <br>STD is the worst abbreviation they could've used.</br>  <br>I am sure there will at least be announcements at wonfes.</br>  <br>that's why you should buy the DX one.</br>  <br>She looks terrible in that picture. Mostly because of the paint.</br>  <br><br>She's probably going to be as much as the Sorceress, meaning I'll pass. At this point I actually like that they are going full retarded jew on that line up, its saving me lots of money.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128506857 <br>Fucking ew.</br>  <br>Spider scale figure would be magnificent.</br>  <br><br>I can't see Miia, Rachnee, or Cerea getting anything more than 1/8ths, probably with really condensed poses like Miia fairly coiled up or Cerea sitting or something.</br></br>  wasn't expecting this to come out so soon  <br>The lighting is really odd. Hopefully we get better photograph soon.</br>  <br>I've always had fantasies of this being a good Miia scale<br>her tail could be the base</br></br>  <br><br>That works. And the one with Cerea has her in a sitting pose as well.</br></br>  <br>Hunter a best.</br>  <br>We saw the sculpt around four months ago. Seems like a fairly standard time schedule to me. Are you going to order through gsc for the wall scroll?</br>  <br>Couldn’t agree more, at this point I'm not sure I'm getting even Mage.</br>  <br>what a crappy WS</br>  <br>I suppose that's true, but at that time it was still unpainted as well. I probably won't order from GSC's site, would rather jew off $15</br>  <br>Figure name?</br>  <br>it's in the picture.</br>  <br>I wonder who is more disappointed in you. Me, or your parents.</br>  <br>Hunter from Bikini Warriors</br>  <br>Pre-ordered. Maybe I'll watch the show eventually but either way that expression does it for me.</br>  <br>Haven't seen the show nor have I ever buyfagged but god damn that is cute. I want it.</br>  <br>Get her.</br>  <br> it <br>get lost, normie</br></br>  <br>Superior version.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much the same here, the expression and the surprisingly cheap price is making me want it. Will wait till after Wonfest to order her though.</br></br>  <br>My bad. I guess it just happened since I haven't seen the show.</br>    <br>Remember everyone, these kind of people vote, breed, and breathe the same air that we do.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It honestly isn't. At all.</br></br></br></br>  How come no one says "Madokashit"? Is Madoka universally accepted here?  <br>I haven't seen much Madokashit being posted recently.</br>  <br>It's at least better than fate/boats/sins/most other shitty mainstream shows</br>  <br>I can't even remember what the last Madoka fig was.<br><br>Psycho yukata Madoka?</br></br></br>  <br>Maiko Mami came out last month. Sayaka and Kyouko are due out in November.<br><br>There have also been 3 Akuma Homuras in the last 6 months.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know how to describe Madoka fans more than pleb, shit taste, meme, etc. Mostly just stupid. Boring. Uninteresting.<br><br>Like bugs being drawn to a light source at night. Endlessly bumping into it like a moron.</br></br></br>   http://myfigurecollection.net/item<wbr>/330951</wbr> <br><br>So it's finally happening.</br></br>  <br>Cool, I just started playing Muramasa the other day.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>330952<br><br>Alter is making more idols too. Eri swimsuit version.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Call me when they rerelease momohime</br>  <br><br>You're two years late.</br></br>  <br>I hope they re-re-release her</br>  banpresto  <br><br>Good luck, there's a better chance to see pigs flying than Alter releasing something a third time.</br></br>  Wing has some teaser images.  <br>Why are Sonico's prize figures so much more interesting than most of her scales?</br>    <br>Kisuke when? He is a faggot and I don't even like him but I need to complete my collection.</br>      <br><br>Mother of god<br><br>I can't believe it's happening, going to preorder on amiami as soon as she's available.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And so begins the WonFes hype</br>  <br>"Do I fit in yet guys, please let me know if I fit in"</br>  <br>Another Ignis scale?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I really want this wall scroll.  <br>would murder for rachnee in her hammock.</br>  <br>post a better angle</br>  <br>Does she even have a tail?</br>  <br>Because they only ever put her in fucking swimsuits for her scales</br>  <br>I hope they make this pose and not the same pose GK has. This is a lot cuter.</br>  <br>Not likely</br>  <br>Depends on HLJ's discount. Not really a fan of GSC's random charging either.</br>  I want the full art for that swimsuit Satan.  <br>Swimsuit is guaranteed seller. Anything else could bomb.</br>  <br><br>God, I'm so fucking sick of swimsuit figures.</br></br>  Skytube.    <br>Stirrups are hot.</br>    <br>I want the full art of everything, especially of fluffy Belphegor.</br>  <br>I watched the show, hated it, but still pre-ordered her. The show might be shit, but I liked her. She's miles better than the other girl.</br>  <br>she looks really cute in that picture. I should reconsider picking up her scale.</br>  <br>What's with all the pokemon merch lately</br>  <br>fuck.</br>  <br>20th anniv</br>  <br>It's not that great a game. The character designs are the best part.</br>  <br>It's a shit overhyped game, the figs are fine though</br>  <br><br>I dunno, I like it.</br></br>  Anyone else going to wonfes on sunday?<br>Any veterans have advice?<br>I'm salty i can't make it to comicon but this seems like the next best thing.</br></br>  <br>Have fun. Keep hydrated.</br>  <br>Unless you're a GK buyer, Wonfest is more of a one and done type of thing. Since everything else good is already sold out by the time you get to the front of the line.<br> <br>Figure out which line you're going to wait in before Saturday night.</br></br></br>  <br>Well fuck, I'll buy 3 of that.</br>  Ultra pleb here. Since AmiAmi specifies yen only, if I use an American debut card will the currency automatically translate and the transaction go through with no problems?  <br>A newfag to this whole buyfag business.<br>How much is the price difference for shit in Japan and otherwise? I know it must differ depending on many factors, but the question is how often and how much? Just thought that I can buy shit here for lower prices and send it to anons, so I came here with questions.<br><br>I know that I don't make any sense, I'm sleepy, so yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have faith in Crabman it's all we can do for now.</br>  shit.  <br> No visible pubic hair <br><br>Not interested</br></br></br>  <br>didn't you notice her tiny head?</br>  <br>I noticed that there's no pubes. <br>That's all that matters on a fig.</br></br>  <br>Which one is this? she's beautiful</br>  <br>headswap?</br>   that Jessie <br><br>Instabuy.</br></br>  <br>How can a figure have a flabby ass, but no ass at the same time?<br><br>It defies logic.</br></br></br>  <br>Usually yes.<br><br>You should also be aware of what % your card charges on foreign currency exchanges. Some banks might find a foreign transaction to be suspicious and block it. In that case you will have to get in contact with them. If for some reason it doesn't work out you can set up a pay pal account.<br><br>What are you thinking of getting?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this<br>How long do you think it will be before pre-orders run out?</br></br>  <br>Not same guy, but probably fairly fast</br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>235633<br><br>That isn't an easy question to answer.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Gonna watch the show just to see if I want her or not</br>  Take it easy!  <br>This is what nightmares are made of.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  The ruv is real.  <br>You and I both, anon.</br>  <br>I give up, what would be easier to get into, Idolmaster or Love Live?<br><br>Need to finally watch an idol animu</br></br></br>  Native teasers.<br><br>I am okay with this becoming a meme.</br></br>  http://native.blog.jp/archives/3721<wbr>4641.html</wbr>  Adult boobs hot blue leaves, the illustrations will be on display booth is.

I did it for Anzu.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might need some lube.</br>  <br> My only reason to get the Sorceress would be that is based on Oda's art, <br>Mage was Saitom, Oda did Dark Elf</br></br>  Hey look, more kekkai sensen merchandise. I wonder whether ther will be any proper scales or super deformed announced at wonfes.<br><br><br>I am pretty sure when he said sorceress he was referring to Dark Elf, not mage.</br></br></br>  <br>Those 30 seconds she had sure were great.</br>  <br>Which 30 seconds?<br>She appeared more than that</br></br>  I want to  live off of  Anzu's  royalties.       <br>details? <br>As far as i know this is the only kongou from arpeggio.</br></br>  <br>FAKE NEET<br>FAKE LOLI<br>FAKE IDOL</br></br></br>  <br>Really cute, though.</br>  <br><br>Looks weird TBH</br></br>  <br>Just like all idols and celebrities.</br>  <br>Did they really post this with such tiny text?</br>  <br> No pubes </br>  Hey, anons.

A true refined lady.</br></br>  who would buy this shit  So when does the Saberfest begins?  <br>How long ago did you send it? Maybe Lilco lost it.</br>  <br>So is their some sort of im@s sticky or something like kancolle and buyfag threads have? I'm thinking of getting into im@s, will I have to buy an xbox and play through the games before watching the anime?  I'm half expecting responses to be la guia </br>  What are the chances of seeing/hearing anything about pic related (or I guess any of the Hibikes)? I want my PVC euphonium.  <br>With all the circles posting the garage kits they will be bringing and the major manufactures leaking out teasers it is already sort of underway.</br>  <br>Alter when?

Take especially care of the Kotomi figure I stopped caring about, she's in dire need of a peg repair.</br>  <br>They are both trash. Build a custom Mirai dollife.</br>  <br>I recommend that you send a second e-mail inquiring about the status of the first.</br>  <br>Watch Love Live, it's easier to get into. You don't even have to like idols in enjoy LL.</br>  <br>You call that tiny thing a penis?</br>  <br> Kyoukai no Kanata was amazing </br>  <br>That's a pretty good idea.

I've been dying to watch puchis</br>  <br>thats cool as hell but unfotunately i only buy figures from series that are good</br>  Do you guys hot glue your figures?  <br>Yes, might do it. I'm really getting worried about it. And, that almost my july order is out. Hope they answer this time.</br>  <br>Holy shit anon, just pull it off</br>  <br>mine is normal size,  is your anus that is too big  </br>  <br>it'll take a harder man than me to bring me down so just try me nigga</br>  <br>Keep dreaming with your tiny pencil dick</br>  <br>No. I don't want to take that leap to being beyond saving</br>  <br>Who do you think is going to save you?</br>  <br>The plastic shit is infinite and will never come out.<br>I've resorted to just tucking in the plastic as far up the skirt as possible, it's all I can do since I can't get the skirt or torso off for shit.</br></br>  <br>Post pics.</br>  <br>You crossed the line way back then.</br>  <br>It can get pretty tricky.</br>  <br>I'm guessing it's a Koto figure. Just pull man, you're not going to break it.</br>   check twitter <br> unlimited scroll down of GK update. <br><br>Damn it Japan!</br></br></br>      Koto's new donut Shinobu.    <br>Do it faggot.

Sick of that shit.</br>  <br>I like all of the weird little handmade tchotchkes that they sell there.</br>  Broccoli teasers. Today is really busy.  <br><br>360 release is the main original game, introducing Miki (arcade version actually starred Haruka).<br><br>It has fleshed out full routes of all idols but starts you off with only one idol. You have to work your way through multiple playthroughs in order to create duos and trios, as well as collecting accessories (presents from fan letters) which "randomly" appear after every evening.<br><br>L4U is a fandisc (basically Taiko) which skips out the grind of getting 3 idols + favorite song + all accessories in the original game. Also has a ton of DLC, but unlike the original game, the DLC in L4U has no attributes/influence on the game itself. It's purely cosmetic.<br><br>2 is set +1 year in a different timeline; anime is an adaptation of it. Forces you into choosing 3 idols. Also, the president's voice actor is new, because the original game's president's voice actor died (irl), as well as Yukiho, who has a new seiyuu. 2 has fleshed out routes and has a linear path, expects multiple playthroughs much like the first. Generally not as liked as much as the first.<br><br>2 introduces Takane and Hibiki, which are also in the PSP releases, which are basically just rhythm games. Also, the PSP Shiny Festa games were released in iOS, in English I believe. I didn't bother so no idea if it's any good.<br><br>OFA is more of a streamlined, easier version of the former games.but expects the player to have played the former releases beforehand. Has a levelling system.<br><br>There's also an iM@S in the works for PS4.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br><br>Seems as though people  donut  want this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>getting tired of this cunt</br>  6 more hours till air time.<br><br>I believe A-1 to deliver Kaede.</br></br>  I believe in Mio  <br>Awakened Miki is good but Mio is shit.</br>  <br>Awakened Miki is good,<br>but your opinion is shit.</br></br>  Y'all calm down  <br>Does that mean Awakened Mio will be a blonde?</br>  <br>Awakened = True<br><br>Miki stopped dying her hair, because that was fake herself. So Awakened Mio would hardly manifest by becoming a fake.</br></br></br>  Noice  <br> CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT <br> ever good </br></br>  Still nothing...  Which sub group should I complain to today?  <br>Shinsen subs</br>  Fansubbing officially are killed.  <br>Write a very detailed to Crunchyroll saying how much we need quality subs and that /a/ would really appreciate it and shit.<br><br>Hopefully they'll understand our dilemma and give us subs by the end of next week.</br></br></br>  <br>That's how the UK spells it<br>It's how Canada spells it.<br>It's how Australia spells it.<br><br><br>America successfully cucked.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The fuck am I watching here? I thought this was a show for kids..  <br><br> anime for kids <br><br>it doesn't exist.</br></br></br></br>  it is masterpiece anime    <br> a show for kids <br>1 and 2 werent but 3 and 4 were</br></br>  why would you think that  A show that expected no sales.  I thought after season 2 it could only get better  <br>JUST</br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>I really should continue watching it, I'm still at the first few episodes. For some reason it just doesn't feel right to marathon it.</br>   The fuck am I watching here? <br>The Citizen Kane of Evangelion.<br><br> The fuck  <br>The Citizen Kane of Evangelion, you disgusting redditor.</br></br></br></br>  I thought it was those kind of shows that teaches you about friendship and how you can achieve anything together but instead its about homeless girls trying to make a living.  I feel like watching this again.  Season 3 when  Very good show, it gets even better in third and fourth season.  <br> a show for kids.. <br>Hah.<br><br><br>But it doesn't even have a third of fourth season.<br>Just some spinoffs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I thought this was a show for kids.. <br><br>I bet you're one of those guys who thought Milky Holmes was about detectives solving mysteries.</br></br></br>  <br>I am those guys.

Do they have nothing to discuss so they come here?</br></br>  <br>thanks for your work anon-san</br>  <br> Your text should've been more specific, Midoriya <br> I was almost late because of it <br>Ooh, so Deku called for backup<br>That was smart<br>Much better than Todoroki showing up outta nowhere</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ty anon</br>  <br>Luckily mods banned the faggots. If you go on other websites keep it to yourself you fucker we dont need to know how many dicks you suck a day. <br><br><br>Thank you translatorfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh Shit son! Thanks Translator-Anon</br>  <br><br>I hope Aizawa shows up next week. He's the perfect match for Stain.</br></br>  <br>Best Boy called the other Best Boy yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<wbr>ees</wbr></br>  <br>They have shallow knowledge and only look at the pretty pictures. Secondary's gonna secondary.</br>  <br>Thanks Translator-san.</br>  <br>Deku is motherufcking MC that we all deserve. He know that he wont stand a chance against hero killer so call for help   But why not for fucking pros ? </br>  <br>You're doing god's work Translatorfag.</br>  <br>When did Midoriya even get Todo's number</br>  <br>They're gone, don't push it further</br>  <br>you clearly see him texting someone pages before, also based deku asking for help instead of going "heroic dumb", this boy knows</br>  <br>He probably doesn't have the cell numbers for many pros<br>I'm surprised he didn't call All Might though.</br></br>  <br>Thank you translator-kun. <br><br>  I love you, please marry me  </br></br></br>  <br>I doubt he knows any of the pro's phone number. Its</br>  <br>Obviously offscreen. They were borderliner friends after the battle.</br>  <br>He would have tried but he had no proof. </br>  <br> making All Might worry on your first mission <br>yeah no</br></br>  <br> Next week: flashback of Todoroki talking to his batshit mom and then getting his ass handed to him <br> Chapter ends with "bakuguo enters the fray!" <br> by the end of the arc the half class lies in that alley </br></br></br>  <br>Nah man<br><br>Obviously there is more to it<br><br>I'm hype because we are going to learn a lot more about the quirk because of this<br><br> and there is nothing wrong with getting hype over something like this. Get off your high horse, yo </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That is one absurdly happy face<br><br>There it is again jesus christ here we goooooo</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;&gt;Your text, <br> &gt;&gt;should've been more specific <br>What the hell did he write in that small window he had?<br> in alley Iida attacked send help </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He already said he didn't have any more proof to get the pro hero's to believe his story. So he probably asked Todo for a favor.</br></br>  <br>There are Noumus running rampant and Iida nearly got killed already<br>This is already well beyond a simple training mission and Deku is a smart enough kid to know that.</br></br>  <br><br>The only thing that'll annoy me is Todoroki being stupidly OP and untouchable again.<br><br>He only loses to Bakugou because he half-asses it due to being emotionally conflicted. I wanna see him get his shit pushed in by a villain more than Bakugou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AfO enhanced typing brah</br>  thanks for making this board a better place translator-kun.  <br> not calling bakugou <br>arc ruined</br></br>  <br> Ice-kun Iida danger alley fighting hero killer <br><br><br>He has Gran Torino besides him, there's no need to call for Almight</br></br></br></br>  <br>he probably sent it when he saw all the noumus and was trying to find ilda</br>  <br>Calling All Might would have been risky, because his transformation isn't lasting as long as before.</br>  <br>quick text and contact list.<br><br><br>Bakugou lost the dekubowl.</br></br></br></br>  <br> HELP Bakugou Iida is in danger!! <br> What the fuck deku where did you get my number? </br></br>  <br> send help, attacked in alley, iida in danger <br> FUCK OFFFFFFFFFFF WHO GAVE YOU MY NUMBER YOU LITTLE HSITJFSLF </br></br>  <br> Mom.Cookies.BackAlley.Now </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128485493 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128485278 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128484926 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128484985 <br>Nice one, samefag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it kinda normal for you to have the phone number of most of your homeroom in japan?<br><br>Or am I just going crazy?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks as always man, you always save us from the damn FA shitastic translation.</br></br>  <br>Is there a quick text for "Classmate is being attacked by a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle in an alley in Hosu"?</br>  <br>when are they gonna show the slice-of-life side of the series with great characterization and dynamics between the homeroom</br>  <br>fucking casual, should send coordinates like.

Help Iida</br>  Does Stain use throwing knives? It seems like he'd be incredibly scary (even moreso than he already is) if he could just nick you from a distance with a throwing knife then finish you off at his leisure. One-hit paralysis is extremely scary as an ability.  <br>It's something like 35.6833° N, 139.6833° E, dumbo</br>  <br>Hori showed Stain licking the knife he nicked Deku with.<br>Could his quirk have something to do with his tongue having to taste the blood of the foe he wants to paralyze?</br></br>  <br>That could very well be the case, maybe his gross-looking tongue isn't just grotesque stylization and it's actually relevant to his quirk.</br>  <br>God bless you, anon</br>  <br>cool but mine work too.<br> L <br>Latitude<br> B <br> B Longitude</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Cum2me! I need u!"</br>  <br><br>He has to literally taste the blood of whomever he cuts to paralyze them. He does this to both Iida and Deku.</br></br>  <br>I am pretty sure he will lose against Stain or at least get pushed back. Stain got hyped up a bit too much to instantly job to Todoroki or anyone else for that matter. Maybe Endeveor will appear and Stain will have to retreat, Deku might break free or Stains quirk might just run out, whatever it is this fight won't end in Stains defeat.</br>  <br>He need to ingest/lick the blood.</br>   next chapter <br> Stain rushes to slay Ice-kun <br> Ice-Kun: "I wouldn't do that if I was you" <br> Close shot of Stain's Eye <br> Endeavor literally breaks through the wall and burns the running Stain into the ground <br> Stain's right hand is on fire <br> Stain: You...

My hype went full Deku the moment the State dropped.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128488452 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128488374 <br><br>While I appreciate seeing the only good character in that manga, this isn't Medaka Box.</br></br></br>  Thanks based mods  So, is Stain's natural enemy AIDS Man?  <br>No, it's this girl.</br>  <br> Frozen barbecued Iida <br>T-thanks, Friendeavor</br></br>  <br> AIDS Man <br>just fucking imagine</br></br>  So when are we going to get a side chapter with sticky balls and mount lady?  <br>kek'd.<br><br><br>What's her power again ?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Detroit <br> State </br></br>  <br>Her blood is extremely acidic.</br>  I hope we get a pro hero soon that always encourages the villians while he defeats them like screaming <br> "Please try harder, I know you can do it!" <br> "I'm actually not that strong!" <br> "Why don't aim at my legs ones in a while?" </br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how dangerous stain would be with a boomerang</br>  <br>How did he control warp gate?</br>   Pulls off X's wall jump within two days <br> Them sweet sanic moves <br> Two successful SMASHes <br> Secretly calls for help by thumb texting behind his back  <br>Deku is best shonen. I can't wait for Endgame Bawl Might being Superman and Batman rolled into one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He cute Black Mist.</br>  <br>He slashed at his arm. You can see him bleeding in the panel.</br>  <br>You can see that warp was wounded in the arm, so that.</br>  <br>If Stain says Cowabunga at one point my life will be complete</br>  <br>HEY LOOK ITS SUSAKE TO SAVE THE DAY!</br>  <br>hey calm down hes not even close to that kind of edgy</br>  <br>He's more like the Neji that should have been.</br>  <br>For once, I really really want FA to mess up the translation so he says it.</br>  When do we see the poll results?  <br>Want to know the color of todo's new customs, cause his hair is red but maybe black.</br>  <br>Next week I think. Or the next time we get a color page.</br>  <br>Warpman has a real body hiding under the fog. Ochako grabbed him during their first attack.</br>  <br> Detroit <br>YES</br></br>  <br>  Stain's hideout is full of discarded pizza boxes </br>  <br>But he more like Neji</br>  <br> &gt;FUCK OFFFFFFFFFFF WHO GAVE YOU MY NUMBER YOU LITTLE HSITJFSLF <br> ... <br> ...why isn't he texting back? </br></br></br>  <br>The next day everyone in class is talking about how they fought Stain. Kacchan can't participate.</br>  <br><br>Until he shows any dere, he's just tsun.</br></br>  I knew the having the text would help make the chapter better. It's till transtion one rather then a super hype moment but the characterization going for Deku and Stain does a lot.<br><br>Hell even Deku's calling for help plays into the theme about a real hero. This is about saving lives for him, not proving he has the biggest dick in the room.</br></br>  <br> oh man, you remember how silly everyone looked when paralyzed? </br>  Ok, we know stain needs to suck his target's blood, then how was he able to do that to blackmist? I assumed blackmist real body was somewhere else  <br>Blackmist didn't have his power activated in the bar. It's like how crowbro has a bird head but that's not his quirk.</br>  <br> oh yeah, we were lucky to get out of there. <br><br>Meanwhile Kacchan is salty.</br></br></br>  <br>Would have been salty even if he was there..</br>  <br>How can he write with such precision on a touchscreen without looking?<br>Did he already have the message ready beforehand?</br></br>  I hope Endeavor is the one to save the day, to be honest. I want to see him doing something heroic since all he has done is be an ass.  <br>SASUKE SAVES THE DAY</br>  So does this mean IcyHot is interning at his dad's after all? Endeavor was close by too after all  <br>Wonder if they have some sort of chat group for that.</br>  <br>Somehow I can totally imagine him having a few drafts for these situations<br> Strong hero in ____, need help <br> Pls evacuate ____ <br> Wounded people at ____ </br></br></br></br>  <br> Strong hero in ____, need help <br>Strong villain you mean.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, of course</br>  <br><br>Drawfag you there?<br><br>Draw dis.</br></br></br></br>  What's the chances that deku and todo gives stain the good old one, two, tag team ass whooping he wants so bad. <br><br>And I like stain more and more. if he actually sees your potential he lets you go. And I bet iida is going to be ass hurt about the whole ordeal! You would think he would be happy, but no I can already see him being salty like sasuke was when he realized how fast naruto was growing.</br></br>  I want to see Deku in with his cowl on. Also I need some more training and less almost death  <br>Nope thats Gaara.</br>  <br><br>That's Kaachan's secret, he's always salty.</br></br>  <br><br> What's the chances that deku and todo gives stain the good old one, two, tag team ass whooping he wants so bad.  <br><br>None, but the ice will provide a good distraction so Large Size Jump Spicy Flame Dad can join the fray.</br></br></br></br>  How long until the anime gets announced?<br>Jump Festa?</br>  <br>Deku is a pro stalker, he probably knows the numbers of all of his classmates.</br>  <br>Next year</br>  <br>Probably never, the author is speedy as fuck, he doesn't have time for such things.</br>  <br>Whenever Toei is ready.</br>  CHINK SCANS  <br>We can only hope whoever picks up the anime does a lot of comfy character interaction filler instead of making shitty filler villain arcs<br><br> Who am I kidding </br></br></br>  <br>Stop it anon!

I'm sorry I don't know what I was thinking I meant mad house</br>  <br> when anon is telling the truth and you can't fight it  <br><br>At least let me have hope that God will send it a savior like madhouse at least</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Toei doing another season of World Trigger but with completely anime original content?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  <br>Even Stain will run away from Endeavour.</br>  <br>Apparently it is. Well after that is over Toei is probably going to nab Boku Hero.</br>  <br><br>It overtook tumblr really quickly because Bakugou parings were "problematic" due to how abusive he was.<br><br>So yes, "problematic" fantasy pairings of manga characters are a thing<br><br>lol</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Let be real here. Todoroki will be first at the popularity poll, isn't he. I don't even like him but I can't see him losing.  <br> things a cursory glance at the main tag show no sign of </br>  <br>I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and just assume "problematic" means "no chemistry" and I agree, but there's also no chemistry with todoroki.<br>The only decent pairing shit i've seen is that Bakugou and ochako squabble stuff.<br>Who ever does that should continue.</br></br></br>  <br>You've said this before, and from what I can find, there is one person saying that and the rest of tumbler loves Bakugou.</br>  <br>The cat gets me every time.</br>  Anime when?  <br>My bet for the results is:<br>1. All might<br>2. Midoriya<br>3. Uraraka<br>4. Todoroki<br>5. Tsuyu<br>6. Bakugou<br>7. Tokoyami<br>Then im not sure, anyone's game.<br>Bakugou is going to lose some fujo points to Todoroki for being an asshole, but i dont think todoroki is going to beat that top 3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ochako being that high <br>We can only hope.</br></br>    <br>There is no way she's losing to any of the other girls at this point.<br>Maybe when the series has a bit more weight to it and some other girls get a lot of screen time.</br></br>  <br> Ochako being that high <br><br>Nips have shit taste there is no way she is gonna be that high</br></br></br>  <br> DETROID <br>Clench your ass real tight and...<br><br><br> SMASH <br>Shit nigga, I came.  And cried a little. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear it will happen.<br>Iida is a wild card though.<br>I dont expect him to appear high because he's a bit of a cunt, but his screentime might make him show up anywhere</br></br></br>  <br>Iida, Stain, Hosu alley, Help</br>  <br>A lil bit of blood came out of my dick</br>  <br>I'm more interested in 2 things.<br>When did deku get todoroki's address?<br>And how talkative is todoroki?<br>I mean, deku must have known he was in hosu so at the very least he get's status updates but is todoroki secretly a very texty guy like Sasaki Isaburo?  RIP </br></br></br></br>  <br> heroes not having a special app that allows for a distress signal and a trackable position </br>  <br><br>i think is to soon for that to happen, also stain just lick a little bit of blood, almost nothing, im sure there is more to it.</br></br>  <br>Why dont we actually have that?<br>emergency services is pretty dumb, if you call but dont say anything they might not even take it seriously, but if you're in a real emergency you might not have the time for that shit.</br></br>  <br>ty anon, you are the best</br>  <br>They may trade All Might cards, stickers and talk a lot about Silver Age heroes.</br>  <br><br> All Might <br> 1st <br> In Japan <br> Land of shit taste </br></br></br></br></br>  the real judgement of japan's taste will be where dekumom ranks  <br>If it is good taste<br><br>at the bottom</br></br></br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  http://www.poll-maker.com/poll36960<wbr>6x1ab32B16-14<br><br>The poll corresponds with the image.</br></br></wbr>  <br><br> Mei has 1/3 of the votes. <br><br>Sasuga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck your poll, it's Mei time!</br>  <br><br><br> Mei has more votes than the rest combined. <br><br>Why</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mei has her own Y-san apparently</br>  <br> Iida carrying Deku <br>I hope we can still see Iida's smile after this arc</br></br>  <br><br>I'm impressed the author actually gave him a reason to show up instead of being there randomly to save the day. Deku is pretty smart for a MC since they usually don't plan this much. Even something as simple as calling backup in an emergency is to be praised.</br></br>  So everything thinks icyhot will stall him before ultimately having to be saved by his pops and storming off angrily because of it right?<br><br>I can just see him paralyzed while his dad is talking down to him about how fire is so great.</br></br>  <br> And I like stain more and more. if he actually sees your potential he lets you go. <br><br>He's just letting him go so he can kill him later though.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Todoroki will have the upperhand, he's all ranged attack, but is still good when the fight is brought into close range, his ability has an advantage over stain.<br>I think stain will either escape and/or be attacked by Mr. Hands<br>Fire dad will probably deal with the noumus.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice poll you got there.</br>  <br>It would be nice if we could have one of these without people gaming it and spamming their waifu. I know that will never happen, I'm just saying it would be nice.</br>  <br> Implying those aren't the real results </br>  <br>Yeah, I actually want to know what people think. I think there'd be a lot of variety considering how likable most of the cast is</br>  <br>Yes anon, that's exactly what I'm doing. How astute of you to notice that.</br>  <br>Pretty much every boy is likable except bakugou.<br>Though only like half of them are diddle-able.</br></br>  <br><br>In Eyeshield 21, the winning and loosing team members exchanged their numbers as a show of no hard feelings and future training partners.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if Deku has mindkun's number.<br><br><br><br>But then again he'll have to be working with his dad in order to be in the area to respond so quickly.<br><br>I want to see Endeavor going apeshit at the thought of his son being in danger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Bakugou <br> Not likeable <br><br>Anon pls. Everyone loves him because he's framed as the asshole he is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All Might <br> 1st <br> Other interesting side characters <br> Anywhere near the top <br>Nahh. It's Japan, the land that voted a side character with no personality over all of the main characters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying dad of the year won't just yell at his kid for being too weak. </br></br>  <br><br>does it constantly smell like pussy around her when she's always fighting nude like in the cavalry fight?<br><br>surely her invisibility must have some weakness.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Look at that Iida face <br>totally SASUKE</br></br>  <br>I don't think Ochako will higher than Frog, unless y-san loves her.</br>  <br>Frog is only fanart popular.<br>That's why she'll be the highest ranked minor character.<br>Ochako is like the sakura of this manga if sakura wasnt shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> but you <br> are worthy to survive <br><br><br>I really REALLY like Stain  he is stain because he is a necesary evil to remove all the fake heroes that stain society , he has principles and sticks to them, he's not a psycho just looking for a reason to kill.<br><br>I can see how he could even actually attack yuuhei at some point, because that institution only promotes bigmouths into the hero business when they have not the true hero principles like Deku.<br><br>Stain is impressed by Deku for the same reason All Might chose him to inherit OfA.<br><br>So stain wants to make hereos tob e REAL hrees for some reason and improve society, but then what do Shigaraki and his boss want?<br><br>Damned Hiroshiki making a shonen this great.<br><br>Deku is fucking awesome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Stain can at the very least paralyze 2 people at once (we don't know if the other hero is paralyzed or unconscious).<br><br>he has to be fucking good to be able to cut strong heroes to pralyze them.<br><br>How do you discover a quirk where you have to lick the blood of another and then you can paralyze them?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah todo will help them gain time before they run the fuck away from there.<br><br>Maybe endavor will get killed this arc.<br><br>Oh man I really hope Stain is a permanent character and not one just for this arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that will be shown in a flasback when grapes calls deku to visit him at the hospital, becaus he's been injured.<br><br>Then the group rushes there only to find mt lady all angry outside and grapes there with a dumb happy face<br><br> I... I've been in paradise! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Totally agree, Deku is the hero Shonen deserves.</br>  <br>nah he will keep an eye on him, so if deku goes against his heroic principles, stain will be there to kill him.</br>  <br>He's probably angry because no one saved him from AIDS</br>  <br>Kek, Underrated post</br>  <br>I'd wager he probably thought he was quirkless for a long time like Deku and only became aware of it later in life. Maybe he too craved to be a hero but was never able to become one due to appearing to be quirkless. Seeing wannabes that didn't really give a damn about being a true hero attain the position he so coveted may have driven him over the edge and led to the mindset he has now.  Perhaps he learned of his quirk after earning his redwings. </br>  <br>maybe his mental stress was greater, because he DID have that bone in the toe, but he never learned his quirk until later on.<br><br>Imagine knowing you have a quirk but you can't use it, or know how or what to do to use it.<br><br>Must be frustrating.<br><br>And I think you are right about seeing all the hero wannabee being fake while he felt to be more worthy.<br><br>If this is the case I really like Stain more, because he is a really good contrast to Deku, or even All Might himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw he accepted to train with his Dad which explains him being there </br>  <br>I guess that's obvious.</br>  <br>What should be:<br><br>1.- All Might<br>2.- Deku<br>3.- Grapes<br>4.- Bakugo<br>5.- Ochako<br>6.- Crow bro.<br>7.- Todoroki<br>8.- Erasehead<br>9.- Stain<br>10.- Tsuyu/Mei<br><br>What will be:<br><br>1.- Todoroki<br>2.- Deku<br>3.- Bakugo<br>4.- Shigaraki<br>5.- Ida<br>6.- one of the metal dudes<br>7.- Crow bro.<br>8.- Ochako<br>9.- Tsuyu<br>10.- All Might</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If we ignore Mei Deku is the most popular</br>  <br>Why would you ignore Mei?</br>  <br>3.Grapes<br> Fuck off, I hate that grapes</br></br>  <br>Because someone was obviously samefagging with his shitty script/bots</br>  <br>Lunch Rush a best. All of you faggots can fuck off.</br>  <br>You just mad your favorite girl didn't win.</br>  <br> Hagakure's only visible attire are her gloves. <br>I want her invisible feeet on my dick.</br></br>  <br>Those color combinations are interesting. <br><br> Red Uraraka and Kacchan <br> Green Deku and Tsuyu <br> Blue Mina and Ingenium </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Red Uraraka and Kacchan <br> ignoring best boy and momo </br></br>  <br>Half of them are wearing the same colors. No wait I bet Tails and Todo are totally paired for eachother because they wear the same color suits!! And obviously Ochako, Kirishima. Bakugo, Earjacks, and Momo are all going to have an orgy because whoa they wear the same color clothes!!</br>  Can we get a OPT?          Is this shit worth the investment of time? Because I feel as if the main character is the only redeeming factor of the show.  Not at all.  Not at all.  <br><br>Does it have one of those endings where it all just amounts to nothing?</br></br>  I enjoyed it. <br><br>I haven't finished it all, but whenever I'm bored I find myself watching an episode or two more.<br><br>Railgun is more slice of life, and Index is more plot and story driven.<br><br>For the time investment, it's probably not worth it because it's a pretty 6/10 anime and there are 4 seasons of episodes so it's ALOT of time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just tired of watching anime where the ending is something ambiguous, open-ended bullshit.</br>  <br>The story is ongoing. The anime are adaptations.</br>  I liked it, just watch it I did hate how it ended though  Are you interested in the characters? How touma and mikasa have that little thing going? Want to see it progress? <br><br>Then don't bother watching the show, it sidelines all that shit.<br><br>Do you like the idea of a city full of mutants with superpowers? Do you want to explore that idea in more detail?<br><br>Don't bother tuning in, all the shit gets pushed aside.<br><br>Want to watch a very generic battle shounen? Want to watch it twice from slightly different perspectives? Did endless 8 give you a semi, but you wish it could have dragged out a bit longer?<br><br>This is the show for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because I feel as if the main character is the only redeeming factor of the show. <br><br> Implying the main character isn't the one dragging the whole series down </br></br></br>  <br>What? The main character is a typical haremshit gary stu. I only enjoyed s2 of Railgun. Index was boring shit. <br>So no, it's not worth the time in my opinion. But if you actually like the white knighting preacher that is Touma, then maybe it's for you after all.</br></br>  im on episode 3 don't think i will continue  <br>I'd say it's worth it. Wasn't really a fan of the Raildex series until I finally decided to sit down and watch it just this year. Depending upon your views you may or may not like the TouMan but he's one of my favorite MCs. If not, you might like a bunch of other characters though because one of the strengths of Raildex is that it does bring a diverse cast of characters along with it.<br><br>Railgun is pretty SoL while Index is your generic shounen. It's pretty average but if you like Touma telling people why they're not living their life correctly and punching his way through tough opponents to the point where you might think he has plot armor, then you'll enjoy it immensely like me. <br><br>If you enjoy it enough, you can read through the 20+ light novels that take place after the anime ends and come discuss with other fellow LNfags. The newest volume is getting translated right now and we're discussing about  PTSD Touma and Misaka getting BTFO </br></br></br></br></br>  No  <br><br>Sorry but Accelerator isn't a main character.</br></br>  <br>The main character is the worst part.</br>  Index S1 is really mediocre. I tried watching Railgun but I dropped it 3 episodes in. I don't understand why this has such a big following on /a/. Maybe the Index LN and Railgun manga are just better.  <br>Railgun is way better than the endless 8.<br>Touma from misaka's perspective is just so flawless.</br></br>  <br> Is this shit worth the investment of time? <br>No.<br> I feel as if the main character is the only redeeming factor of the show. <br>You're not feeling correctly.</br></br></br></br>  Have you lived your life correctly today /a/?  <br> spiky haired gary stu generic beta self insert MC <br> redeeming factor <br><br>Nope</br></br></br></br>  <br>Railgun was a fine adaptation and is worth a watch if you skip the fillers. Index on the other hand got butchered hard but I still watched to the end. In the end I picked up the LNs and they are pretty great. The story is fun and the characters are interesting. Also the powerlevels and final boss shenanigans are pretty hype.</br>  <br> Railgun was a fine adaption <br>Fuck no it wasn't.</br></br>  <br>I don't see anything wrong besides the fillers.</br>  <br>Index is cheesy as hell and kinda shit. Just watch Railgun.<br><br> 32 hours <br> a lot of time </br></br></br></br>  <br>I sit around at home all day wishing something special would happen to me while becoming a worse and worse person to the point I cant even see myself being happy even if i was transported to a magical anime waifu world with super powers.<br>So no.</br></br>  <br>Nagaispace invades even the canon content. He constantly changes shit for no reason and has the characters act OOC. He removed Touma from a lot of the manga and replaced him with retarded Saten scenes for no reason.</br>  No, instead of watching 96 bad episodes of anime watch some good anime instead.  <br> not loving satan unconditionally <br>It's like you're some kind of a cunt.</br></br>  I honestly think that even if you want to watch the anime along with the LNs, you should skip Index S1. The Sisters arc and Accelerator's arc were the only parts they made enjoyable to watch.  <br>Saten a useless level 0 shit.</br>  <br> good anime </br>  <br>You're a shit, please die.</br>  <br><br>Good anime exist anon, just stop watching Typemoon crap.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off Nagai you dumb nigger.</br>  <br>Ninety-nine percent of the cast is useless at this point.</br>  <br>Only when it comes to the main story of Index. Other characters can still be useful in side stories like Railgun. Saten isn't even useful in Railgun though so she's the pinnacle of worthlessness. At least Uiharu is good with computers since her esper power is useless.</br>  <br> Touma <br> not-Touma <br> Aleister <br> Fiamma <br> Accel <br>Does anyone else even matter?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fiamma <br>Literally worse than Stiyl at this point.</br></br>  <br> the main character is the only redeeming factor of the show <br><br>What did you just fucking say?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Best Kihara</br>  <br>He's right. Touma is the only real reason to read or watch this shit.<br><br> “It was because Misaka was with me that I made it this far. She kept my trembling legs moving, supported my heart as the pressure bore down on it, and kept me in a position to make jokes. With Index, things may have been too focused on magic. With Othinus, it would have been exclusively about Magic Gods and having a clear understanding of their strength might have crushed me with despair. It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. She saved my life and you want me to tell her to back off because she’s in the way? Who the hell do you think you are!? You don’t understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but you’re trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!”  <br><br> “So take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, I’ll go punch you just like you want!!”  <br><br> “I don’t care if you’re covered in magma or if you’re over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I don’t need that for you and I don’t care if it doesn’t work on you! I don’t care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you don’t shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, I’ll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shounen-level cheesy speech that makes no sense if you actually think about it.<br><br>I suppose you can read it ironically.</br></br></br></br>  Not really, the harem is kind of trash, biribiri is shitty tsundere, the titular character doesnt do anything, and its way slow in parts. The only good parts were Touna punching things and Stiyl interacting with loli teacher. <br><br>If you're already mostly through the first season I'd say finish it just because theres some interesting scenes and concepts.</br></br>  i thought it was fun. i usually watch shounen but i liked most of index. that soundtrack is top notch. only thing i disliked is that ice ship arc. i guess the light novel is the only good thing about the series overall  <br> Railgun was a fine adaptation  <br><br>You can't be fucking serious</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Accelerator being edgy as hell. That's really fun, too.<br><br><br>0/8</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the whole point. The dude's broken and he's just running on his emotions at this point.</br>   NT13 <br> Dat chapter 4 and afterword <br><br>Nuit or awakened wings please, Kamachi.</br></br></br>  <br>Delusional power ups will never fucking happen.</br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>I'm not sure how far you are but depending on who you are you'll end up liking somebody.</br></br></br>  <br>Kamachi can pull World Rejecter from his ass. He can do anything now.</br>  <br> Fiamma <br>Given how he jobbed this volume, he'll never be relevant again.<br>Unless he regain the Holy Right somehow.</br></br></br>  Touma is shit but everyone in universe and a majority of the fans will suck his dick and praise every thing he does forever so  <br>Personally I don't really see much reason to hate the guy.</br>  <br>She's still way more capable than you'll ever be.</br>  <br>If people took Saten seriously when she talks about "legends" she'd be helpful as fuck.<br> Name one time a legend she believed in was wrong. </br></br>  <br>There's plenty of reason to find him obnoxious and uninteresting despite how the series does everything it can to make the guy look good</br>  <br> raildex <br> ending </br></br>  <br>So tell me some of those reasons anon, I'm not really seeing it, at most I could call him boring at times.</br>  <br>Have you read the LNs or are you Just watching the anime</br>  <br>I've done both anon.</br>  <br>Are you caught up on the novels</br>  <br>If I wasn't then I would have said so. <br>Infact in the latest volume was pretty great as far as interaction goes.</br></br>  <br>You're all caught up on the series and you can't see how someone could think Touma is obnoxious and boring for yourself, even if you don't necessarily agree?</br>  <br>Hate and finding him uninteresting/boring is pretty different anon, I can understand finding him boring but outright hating Touma is different.</br>  <br>Being obnoxious and boring is a reason to dislike. Hate comes in after the dislike grows</br>  <br>Its long and dumb, but index does some crazy things with its settings and adventures. Its rather addictive to see what the fuck is going to happen next. Its almost a madlib the mediocre anime. Would I recommend it though? No I wouldn't but if you are into a show that doesn't change or add much to basically the harem/action/magical genre and can be mildly hilariously bad at times then sure why not. I would suggest alcohol when watching index.<br><br>Didn't get into railgun lost interest early on because of all the slice of life crap.</br></br></br>  <br>So you hate him because he bores you? <br>Interesting.</br></br>  <br>I found accelerator to be a bit more compelling but ok. Although you guys aren't talking about the anime I'm sure.</br>  <br>Definitely don't the series too seriously.<br>It's not episodic, but more than one time a similar thing happens.<br>Essentially, moralfag preaches to people telling them to live their life correctly, then that moralfag goes home to the underage girl he keeps at his apartment after a long day of punching women.</br></br></br>  I would kill for a third season of index. <br>Please for the love of God, announce it already.</br>  <br>They won't announce it before HO anime ends. Probably not even then.</br>  <br>Personally I just want another fighting game.  Even if it isn't that good, it's still pretty fun. </br>  <br> Definitely don't the series too seriously. <br> It's not episodic, but more than one time a similar thing happens. <br> Essentially, moralfag preaches to people telling them to live their life correctly, then that moralfag goes home to the underage girl he keeps at his apartment after a long day of punching women. <br>Sure. Sure why not.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Aren't accelfags mostly guys who hate touma?</br></br>  OP here after an hour and a half.<br><br>If anyone still wonders why I said Touma's what keeping the show interesting for me is how the author presents him. Coincidences keep bad things happening to him because he has bad luck. He's a level 0 in his world, fukkin weak. But it's because he has a sick right hook that allows him to stay relevant in battle. Accelerator would probably shred him up if he could, because he's the strongest no doubt. But he can't, because by his own misfortune he has that right hand.<br><br>There's also that dragon thing that became his right hand for a second but I haven't watched enough to see if that develops into anything.<br><br>Plus seeing him power through getting his arm lopped off was pretty sick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Accelerator is a main character.</br>  <br>Well in that case you'll fall in love with Hamazura.<br><br> IF you read the LN that is. </br></br></br>   streaming <br><br>am i doing it right /a/?</br></br>  <br>not yet. you have to first  download the stream  and then  upload it to youtube.
