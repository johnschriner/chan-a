Their single for Jinrui was pretty much universally loved.</br>  <br>kind of dissapointed actually, not nearly as good as the S1 OP.</br>  why did they put yuri stuff in a kid's show?<br><br>what will kids think about hotarun's obsession with komari?<br><br>all them plushies?</br></br></br></br>  <br> kid's show <br> aired @ 2 AM in the morning <br><br>pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kids would just think of it as a cute relationship between reversed kouhai and senpai.

The preview for the 32nd issue teases, "What is the dream that Sarada has obtained now that she has passed her graduation exam!?" The final chapter will include a center color page. <br><br> Shueisha is listing that the one compiled book volume of the series will ship on August 4. <br><br>so its seems Kishi got one more week to wrap this whole Karin/Cuckura shit up<br>could he really can pull it off?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>Of course not.</br>  <br>Can't you faggots stay in one containment thread <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127343788 ?</br>  <br><br>At least Kishi keep his word of it being a 'short' sequel unlike DBZ.</br></br>  <br>Toriyama never promised that.</br>  <br>lets use this as containment thread and not the other one shall we?<br>since Coolest Mod wants to see actual news/info about Boruto or else he will delete it as he said in this thread:<br><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/a/thread/127300174/#p127320434" target="_blank">https://boards.4chan.org/a/thread/1<wbr>27300174/#p127320434</wbr></a></br></br></br>  <br> Daily one-after-the-other threads are not necessary or desirable. <br> makes a new one when there is already one up <br>It's like you want both to get deleted faggot</br></br></br>  <br>I thought he was a janitor.</br>  MODS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br>Why is that Fatefags can have as many threads they want? There must be a reason.</br>  <br> Because we're only speculation hunters, shit posters, and spoiler hunters <br> Unlike the rest of /a/ </br></br>  <br>i take it he likes it and hates naruto but tries to tolerate it because of feedback spam?</br>  So it ends this Thursday?  <br> implying JUMP won't nag Kishi to do another sequel in the future </br>  <br><br>Can you guys shut the fuck up with this cuck bullshit? if you don't know what the word cuck means and how do use it in the right situation then please shut up.</br></br>  <br>No actual material out yet, same thing with shingekifags and their spoiler week.</br>  <br>Cry me a river faggot.<br>And remember that sarada is just a clone. Mark my words</br></br>  <br>Maybe for an anniversary project but not right now.</br>  <br>nope, next week<br>i think JUMP realized Kishi got fucked up and gave one more week to solve this whole DNA thing</br></br>  <br>It is not an epick maymay to hate that series.</br>  <br><br>If you could only make threads about an anime/manga when something new is released wouldn't this place be mostly dead most of the week? What kind of stupid rule is that?</br></br>  <br>guess they want to kill /a/...</br>  Is Boruto actually any good?? Boruto himself is fucking retarded but everything else doesn't look that bad.  <br>New stuff comes out every day of the week, unless anime and manga as a whole dies /a/ will never run out of discussion.</br>  <br>We get the Manga a week earlier than the nips. So it ends this week for us.</br>  <br> Be dead most of the week <br> MOST </br></br>  <br> but everything else doesn't look that bad <br>I really could have done without Edward Rinneganhands.</br></br>  <br>Shingekifags get the same treatment and i don't see them complaining, stop feeling so entitled.</br>  <br>Who? I haven't read any of this and I didn't even finish the original series.</br>  <br> We get the Manga a week earlier than the nips. <br>wha?<br>i thought we get same time as nips do<br>how the scan/translator guys get that early?</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Most content (i.e an episode) is usually discussed for a week at minimum over the span of a week's content that's a considerable amount of threads even if you exclude meme-threads and rec threads.</br>  <br>guess this post overrules moot's previous statements about nardo huh?</br>  <br>I remember there was a period on /a/ some time ago where Naruto threads were deleted on sight.<br><br>Good times.</br></br></br>  <br> Daily one after the other threads are not necessary or desirable <br>Let's see, that means threads that have to be deleted are also:<br>Fate threads<br>One piece threads<br>Bleach threads<br>JoJo threads<br>Evangelion threads<br>Yahari threads<br>Monogatari threads<br><br>Looks to me like the mod isn't doing his job properly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The guy on the Bolt movie's poster. Big, bad, kidnaps Dadruto so Sausage, the Kages and Bolt rush to whatever dimension has been taken to and save him.</br>  So in one chapter they need to:<br><br> Kill all the Shins <br> Solve the paternity plot  <br> Make Sasuke the coolest papa <br> do the graduation exam <br> show why Sarada now wants to become hokage </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah that was before anal devasitation of NS happened...<br>never thought kishi would make his fanbase THAT mad by just one pairing</br></br>  <br>Gotta have some villain to justify a plot, right? Also who is that red fucking fat bitch. Fucking why? All of those kids look retarded except Sakuras kid</br>  <br>Most of those are still currently airing though and so have new material to discuss on a weekly basis, although i am in no way advocating the frequency in which fanbases like fate create new threads.</br>  <br>But the Nardo anime is also still airing, gaiden coming out every week for now, and the boruto movie mid july if I'm not mistaken. Plenty of content for threads, I'm not defending this shitfest but if the mod is going to be a dick he might as well be fair</br>  <br><br>Except multiple One Piece threads are present throughout the week, even when the day for spoilers hasn't arrived yet. It's literally just a meme to hate on the Naruto threads, and the moderation thinks it's a good idea to pander to it than fairly moderate the board.</br></br>  <br>The anime for JoJo ended, though we did just get a new chapter of the manga but the manga only get's new chapters once a month</br>  <br> Kill all the Shins <br>Can happen off-screen or just 1 page<br> Solve the paternity plot  <br>Karin can intervene or flashback happens  or both  lets say can take 3-6 page<br> Make Sasuke the coolest papa <br>snuggling and kissing 2 page at max<br> do the graduation exam <br>3 pages max<br> show why Sarada now wants to become hokage <br>4 pages<br>there you go</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura's kid is shit. Basically looks like one of those sjw bitches. Her glasses look tacky too.</br>  <br> show why Sarada now wants to become hokage <br>Obviously because Naruto is hokage</br></br>  <br> Talking shit about best girl </br>  <br> implying <br>Naruto's going to pull off Tejuu doushdedt Rasengan and kill every shin, solve maternity and graduate all children straight to Hokage at once</br></br>  <br> Make Sasuke the coolest papa <br>At this point I'd be willing to believe he just fucks off again so he can make a homecoming entrance in the film. <br>Maybe take a new family picture at the most.<br> graduation exam <br> Sarada now wants to become hokage <br>That's gonna be a colour centerpiece, her donning the pussy deflector with Bolt and Whatshisname on either of her side. <br>Throw in some cheap lines about finding the sense in being a ninja (possibly with a Sausage reference) and protecting the village, as someone whose dream is now to become Hokage one day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  is she or he???  <br>Looks like shit.</br>  Why is the next movie about Boruto and not Sarada? Gaiden didn't give us any reason to care about Boruto at all  <br>He can be whatever you want her to be.</br>  <br>well i dunno since Kishi and SP really obsessed with traps and feminine boys</br>  <br>I think it looks more interesting than the majority of the designs in Naruto</br>  <br> red fucking fat bitch <br>Chouji fucked some girl from the Cloud who once called Sakura annoying and beat Naruto's face who took the beating for Sauce.<br>The other kids are Shikamaru's spawn with Temari, the pale-ass creepy guy is Ino's and Sai's mutt, the guy in blue is some new character who can stretch his arms.</br></br></br>  <br>so the last chapter should come out this wednesday<br>also what is this chibi sauce doing here?</br></br>  <br> who once called Sakura <br>Chouji confirmed for tasteful.</br></br>  <br>new chapter of Sasuke SD i guess...</br>  <br>You are delusional.</br>  <br>Gaiden is Sarada's story<br><br>Movie is Bort's</br></br></br>  <br> Ino's and Sai's mutt  <br>Fucking really?<br><br>Also is it some family tradition that every kid in Shikimarus family/clan have to look exactly the same with the same abilities and same attitude?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shikadai has mother's eyes.</br>  <br> Also is it some family tradition that every kid in Shikimarus family/clan have to look exactly the same with the same abilities and same attitude? <br>To be fair he is much less ape-like than his father was at his age.</br></br>  <br>Not many people discuss SnK though, since it got mainstream /a/ stopped caring.</br>  <br> we will never get good scans </br>  <br> and same attitude? <br>His problem attitude has some bite in it. It isn't the standard Nara "Fucks are too much trouble to give"</br></br>   tfw no genki Himawari <br>why even live?</br>  <br> why even live? <br>DISREGARD TOBIRAMA<br>MULTIPLY UCHIHAS</br></br></br>  So, we all know that Baruto is going to get it's whole new series, right?  <br>Is that even a question? He will milk these series until Naruto GT: Space boogaloo</br>  <br> His problem attitude has some bite in it. <br> Hinata and Naruto and Temari and Shikamaru are probably the best fitting, most stable relationships <br> they both give birth to cheeky little shits </br></br></br>  <br>China</br>  <br>I really think that's just Kishi's art style changing.</br>  <br>Shikadai is just the same lazy faggot his dad was at his age.<br><br>Boruto on the other hand is an ungrateful asshole.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127346047 <br>No</br>  Everyone move to r9k for the time being<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Uchiha a shit.</br>  If they never address Sarada's backstory, then it should be assumed that Karin is the mother because of the test right? I still think that would be a cop out that they don't explain exactly how she was born and why Karin isn't taking care of her.    <br>We all know it might, given Kishi's doormat mentality. If they tell him to go make more, he might very well do so.<br>That said I can't see him make much of a new era manga, structured in the same way as the main series was. Movie BBEG aside he'd have to scale the powerlevels way down, and make the characters just have fun, light hearted adventures with ninja wizardry, next to no DARKNESS or Sarada going apeshit enough to really delve into the eye power routine if she really is going to be Hokage. He just doesn't have it in him.</br></br>  <br>Enough with this shit. Why do you want to let shitposters get their way? The thread's fine. Stay where the material belongs.</br>  <br>Burrito is an stupid edgy fuck<br>Shikadai at least calls out stupid, but still wants to be lazy</br></br>  <br>Theres no winning against autistic, power hungry mods.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127346047 <br>Fuck off germanfag</br>  <br>What a privileged little shit. Can't Naruto and Hinata just throw him into the forest and let him fend for himself?</br>  <br>I really doubt he'll make a new part 3 manga.<br><br>If anything it will be SP the ones who officially make Naruto GT, but we all know they are still going to be making fillers about Coolest Guy until 2020.</br></br></br>  fuck off  <br>There is when they give up. Stop giving in. We've come far in the months sine this shit started getting bad.</br>  <br>Then they would be bad parents like Sakura.</br>  <br>Hasn't happened in the months you've been complaining, and won't happen anytime soon. You're wasting your time.</br>  <br>But shitty/absent parents make good children.</br>  <br> making fillers about Coolest Guy <br>I'll never understand why they have such a hardon for him. Is his VA super cheap to best fit filler, or something? <br>I just want to see Gai rip Madara a new asshole, is that too much? It's probably the last decent fight of the main series.</br></br></br>  <br>But Sakura's kid considers her a great mom and she doesn't vandalize national monuments nor ruin birthday parties.</br>  <br>ayylieans have no gender.</br>  <br>Then how did Kaguya give birth to the sage?</br>  <br>Eh, they should have given him more chapter at least. It was going fine but last chapter felt rushed.</br>   Did someone say coolest guy?   <br>She is basically a god and if she cant do something she invents a power that lets her do something I'm sure she might have figured something out</br>  I can't imagine Karin being in the last chapter, so no one can/will be able to explain why the umbilical cord matched, so that must mean the test was the truth and Karin's the mom.  It's not ending next week, their information is wrong. No where in previews or in WSJ says Gaiden is ending.  <br>Let him, shitposting in nardo threads is his life.</br>  <br><br> red <br><br>You need to get your eyes checked</br></br></br></br>  Will nurutu end once and for all after this?  <br>Are you literally blind?<br><br><br>Nope</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How did that thing turn into one of the coolest fucking characters out of the entire series.</br></br>  <br><br>red = brown<br><br>okay</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's definitely a mix of both</br>  <br>First there's the Boruto movie and then Kishi said he's going to make an announcement after that which will probably introduce Naruto GT. So no and it never will.</br>  <br>I can't see Karin being the mom when she is still being treated as a plot point rather than as a character.</br>  <br>STEP INTO THE GRAND TOUR <br>NARUTO GT</br></br>  <br> Kishi said he's going to make an announcement after that <br>When did he say that?</br></br>  <br> tfw no third kid genki Naruko clone </br>  <br>In Nurutu yes. In the real world it's variable.</br>  <br>He is a trap</br>  <br>She is a plot point to this short story and will likely never make an appearance, doesn't mean she's not the mother.</br>  <br> the real world <br><br>Don't bring up such topics here.</br></br></br>  <br>When did Kishi say something about an announcement?</br>  <br> ... <br><br>Fags like you are the ones killing /a/.</br></br></br>  <br> First there's the Boruto movie <br><br>After this gaiden. That's correct.<br><br> And then Kishi said he's going to make an announcement after that which will probably introduce Naruto GT. <br><br>False.<br><br>And even if Naruto GT turns out to be true, that would have been decided by Jump/Pierrot, not Kishi. Kishi wants to get out and do other things.<br><br>At most, he would make some character designs and get the fuck out leaving Pierrot handle the rest, just like when Toriyama did with DBGT and Toei.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fanbase of those shows isnt as retarded as naruto's though. <br><br>I actually ''like'' the spin off manga and the thread isnt as bad as it used to be. But the naruto threads were so fucking cancerous when the movie came out. Full of deviantart, tumblr and other shit. <br><br>/a/ is better of without Naurto threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You nurutu fags are the shitposter, though.</br>  <br>I would get rid off every mainstream series then, not just Naruto.<br><br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting you know?</br></br></br>   this shit will never end   <br>The threads just need about actual discussion and speculation rather than shipfaggotry and fanart dumping.</br>  <br>Spinoff is ending this week. Salad is getting a character arc now because she won't get one in the movie.</br>  <br> ronic shitposting is still shitposting you know? <br><br>Wow, great line you learned ! Welcome on 4chan!</br></br></br>  <br>Is english even you shitposters first language?</br>  <br>Why are you so mad? Did the ending ruin your personal ship or something?</br>  Well this is a GET thread. Check em.  <br>I am prepared for disappointment.<br><br>Here's chapter 700+9 by Viz if anyone wants it: http://www58.zippyshare.com/v/ur5Ze<wbr>GGo/file.html<br><br>It was a pretty dull chapter so I won't even bother dumping it.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I dont care abou the shipping. Sorry, I'm not from tumblr.</br>  What the fuck was the Scarlet Spring?  <br>It's a term for a girl coming of age.</br>  <br> Sarada's first period </br>  <br>Sharingans errywhere</br>  <br> Karin's or any regular Uzumaki's hair <br> Sharingan <br> A reference to Salad's period <br> A reference to Salad's internal rage towards her deadbeat father, but won't show it <br><br>Take your pick</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>simple, it isn't Naruto.</br>  <br> Is Boruto actually any good?? <br>The movie or the Gaiden? Because the movie isn't out yet and the Gaiden is about Salad.</br></br>  <br>Easier than you think. Of course, I wouldn't be surprised if Kishi doesn't reveal Salad's parentage, instead saying it doesn't matter who the real mother is because Cuckura took care of Salad.</br>  <br> best girl <br>That'd be pic related, not Sakura 2.0</br></br>  <br>How is she best girl when she hasn't been shown or even mentioned since chapter 700 seven months ago?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>You know, I was kind of pissed at the anime adding even MORE Obito flashbacks, but then I realized it's kind of a necessity.<br><br>They're doing everything they possibly can to try to make people sympathize with this murderous, insane, irredeemable fuck.<br><br>Because it makes NO sense for Naruto to have forgiven the person who started a war, killed thousands upon thousands, resurrected Madara, unleashed evil that was sealed for millennia, and not to mention, KILLED HIS PARENTS AND MADE HIM AN ORPHAN. Why? Because his waifu died and he was sad.<br><br>I get that Naruto's whole character development was him becoming able to let go of hatred, and if he had left it be after the battle that would have made sense. But to PRAISE him? ADMIRE him? THE COOLEST GUY? That shit still makes me cringe to this day. <br><br>Fuck Kishi, why didn't you just let Madara be the final villain? Madara didn't give any shits, he was in it for himself. Madara was the best written character in the entire show bar none.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> privileged <br/></br>  <br> warm and gentle like her mother <br> incest  <br> Saori Hayami <br>She's best girl without even having to see or hear her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> warm and gentle like her mother <br>So another clone? That just makes her uninteresting.</br></br>  <br>I really wish he wasn't quite as dead pale as his father. He already does the painting bit besides his mother's mindrape, no need to make him look that fucking horrible.</br>  <br><br>Good job Ino!</br></br>  <br>Gotta See Gotta Know! The true identity in Inojin's pants!</br>  <br>Do Chouchou and Shikadai get powers from both their parents too or is that just for Inojin and Sarada?<br><br>I can't see Shikadai using a giant fan but at least he should have some wind jutsus to use alongside the shadow imitation.</br></br></br>  There seems to be a lot of clan mixing in Gaiden.But it makes me wonder. How many of the other kids in the original Naruto were mixing clans? Because most of those kids seemed really straight forward in their abiliities.  <br>They all married fodder with no abilities.<br>Sasukes mother was no Uchiha by blood.</br></br>  <br>The answer is simply that Kishi didn't put much thought in where any of the moms came from other than Naruto and Sasuke's.<br><br>Minato is from a literally who clan so he married into Kushina's dead family and Sasuke is an inbred.</br></br></br>  <br> Sasuke is an inbred <br>Cousins are fair game in nipland<br>Wonder how important are Sharingan levels in matchmaking</br></br></br>  <br>I'm really digging some of the SP designs. Shikadai looks a lot less trap in that poster though. Must be the eyelashes.</br>  <br>What even IS a haruno? It's gotta be the most bottom of the barrel genes ever. Like clan outcast breeding with other clan outcasts assuring shit genes for anything to spawn from them.</br>  Which one, /a/?  <br> what is Nara Yoshino <br><br><br>according to some exhibition, there is no Haruno clan and also no Namikaze clan, there was a hatake clan though</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Speaking of villains, the fuck is this thing's gender?</br></br>  <br>That artist does a really good fem-Bort.</br>  <br>Kishi is celebrating LGBT by making the first trap villain since Dr. Crowler from Yugioh GX</br>  <br> what is Nara Yoshino <br>We don't know where she came from before marrying Shikamaru's dad. However we know Kushina's entire backstory and that Sasuke's mom was an Uchiha.</br></br>  <br> Dr. Crowler <br> trap <br>More like Tim Curry-tier transvestite. Bakura was significantly more trap-like.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Naruto gets too much attention. It sucks the other threads to death.</br></br>  <br>Will they get family justus with Naruto/Sasuke and Karin/Sakura?</br>  <br>I only know Chrono-sensei, who is this crowler?</br>  <br>And whose fault is that?<br><br><br>Bort will get one with Salad, the new Team 7, Dadruto and Sauce. Salad will get one with Chouchou, Bort, new Team 7 and Cuckura.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny you say that when she's also nothing but a Hinata 2.0.<br><br> Inb4 implying that's a bad thing <br><br>It is, mainly because that just means she's going to be irrelevant forever and has no character on her own so far.<br><br>At least Boruto is a borderline edgy faggot unlike his father and Sarada is less of an edgy faggotress unlike her father so they don't feel like complete copy-paste, unlike Himawari and Shikadai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Boruto x Sarada <br>They aren't wasting.</br></br>  <br>At least she's not voice by a literally who person.</br>  <br> [pottery intensifies] </br>  <br> At least she's not voice by a literally who person. <br><br>FUCK</br></br></br>  <br>Bolt.</br>  <br>That just made me realize, Boruto is like Sasuke while Salad is Naruto.</br>  <br>Implying little known or up and coming voice actresses aren't a breath of fresh air.</br>  <br> implying you wouldn't watch a ninja Okusan cross Yotsuba with Hinata and mini Hinata with whiskers </br>  <br>Yeah, pretty much. Except Bort's not even a 10th as edgy and Salad's not obnoxious or gay.<br><br>It's the best of both worlds. Everybody wins.</br></br></br>  <br>More like a failure considering the damn actress is 32 and has not landed big roles.</br>  <br> More like a failure considering the damn actress is 32 and has not landed big roles. <br><br>HE JUST DOESN'T STOP</br></br></br>  <br>How long has she been voice acting?</br>  <br> 32 <br>Wasn't she like 8 when Nurudu started?<br><br>Jesus fucking Christ.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bort is still pretty terrible. I wouldn't be surprised if he ran off and got undertaken by an edgy villain and Salad wants to save him over everything</br>  <br>The one whose parents aren't absolute shit.</br>  <br>Teenager anon. 1999 is when Nurutu started.</br>  <br><br> One Piece x Naruto <br><br> Dragon Ball x Toriko <br><br> Bleach x Gorillaz <br><br> Sket Dance x Gintama <br><br> Joseph xJotaro x Jolyne x Josuke <br><br>That's just an association "nomenclature" used to point out "Combi" that has nothing to do with shipping most of the time. Of course, shipperfags will think otherwise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Salad then?</br>  <br>Since 2005 at least. From what I see on her ANN page.<br> http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/en<wbr>cyclopedia/people.php?id=25965</wbr> </br></br>  <br> Sasuke <br> Sakura <br> not shit <br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shikadai? <br><br>Inojin?<br><br>Chou Chou?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a funny guy.</br>  <br>Do you have ruin joke?</br>  <br>Do you have to ruin grammar?</br>  <br>But Sauce is a parent to both of the kids.</br>  <br>Then both Bolt and Sarada are doomed.</br>  <br> Boruto - Doormat and Hokage <br> Sarada - Jobber and absentee <br> Chou Chou - Slouch and brown <br> Inojin - Whiner and androgynous <br> Shikadai - Lady and consigliere <br>Shikadai has the most accomplished parents, at the least.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lady <br><br>You mean tsundere</br></br></br>  <br><br>o-oh</br></br>  <br>Wait, why the fuck does Salad need glasses when she's bred with special eyes</br>  <br>But we have anime Guy this week</br>  <br>Coolest guy needed goggles because he had sensitive eyes.</br>  <br>Sakura's genes.</br>  <br>Sakura doesn't wear glasses. The majority of people in Naruto don't wear glasses. I can't remember a single person who does</br>  <br><br>Sakura ruins everything even the sharingan.</br></br>  <br> Sakura not even on the poster with her teammates <br>I take it now she's fulfilled her purpose of mothering main character offspring, she, like Hinata before her, is worthless and will hardly appear anymore?</br></br>  <br>It's okay, anon. He actually seems to like Bort. At least more than that vagina-having Pink Shit clone crybaby.</br>  <br>"naruto will end in 1 and 1/2 year"<br>"never mind it will end in another year and a half"<br>"ok half a year I swear"<br>does anyone remember this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her only job in the movie to my knowledge is being a medic. Probably won't even see her until shit hits the fan. Bort's mansion is the only home that's going to be featured.</br>  <br>She seems to have enough formal bearing in her new household.<br><br>Shikadai still doesn't give two shits, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, she ended up doing more in the gaiden than I ever thought she'd do post-700.</br>   final issue of Maury comes out 2 days after Jul 4th <br>FREEDOMINTENSIFIES.WEBM</br>  <br>Kabuto, Nono &amp; that girl with swirly glasses come to mind.</br>  <br>Kabuto, Karin and that girl with the swirly science glasses.<br><br>Basically only weird science girls and Kabuto wear specs.</br></br></br>  <br> 'sup <br>I love that kid. I'm actually glad he's fighting Bort in the exam finals.</br></br>  <br>You've gotta appreciate Kishimoto wasting the extra volume with an excuse plot that barely even ties to the movie. How much do you want to bet Shin isn't even mentioned in the movie.<br><br>The only drama coming from a cuck story of all things. I can't wait for Sasuke to apologize next chapter and everyone forgets he didn't even visit for 12 years. That shit was cold even by his pathetically low moral standards.</br></br></br>  <br> day after that is the start of Gai vs. Madara </br>  <br><br>You won't be glad when he takes a chidori in the name of an attention whore's Daddy Issues.</br></br>  <br>In terms of well-adjusted and succesful children<br> Top tier <br>both parents alive and present<br> negligibly lower than top tier <br>one parent alive and present, one parent dead<br> meh to low tier <br>one parent alive and present, one parent alive and absent<br> &gt;necromancer tier<br>one parent alive and present, one parent dead and present</br> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean saying sorry for nearly killing Sakura and all the Kages wasn't the lowest point for him? And then marries Sakura anyway?</br>  <br> yeah <br> sorry </br></br>  <br>Same way there's no Lee clan</br>  <br>Sasuke is probably the worst dad in all of Nurutu. Even Hinata's dad paid her a little bit of attention. <br><br>He's probably just gonna get off scot free and Salad will decides she forgives and loves him and wants to play happy families with cuckura because he's her bio dad....despite the 'message' of Gaiden being 'bonds over blood' or something along those lines.</br></br></br>  <br>I did like the hilarious reactions to when Hinata won the Narutobowl. And the Hiashi post game smugness.</br>  <br>So, only weird science girls then?</br>  <br>Tazuna and Gato had glasses, but they're old as fuck<br>But yeah young people don't wear glasses</br></br>  Be honest /a/ would you fuck Sasuke?  <br> Hinata won the Ramenbowl <br> Sakura is a cuck <br>What a time to be alive.</br></br></br>  <br> More like a failure considering the damn actress is 32 and has not landed big roles. <br>The fuck, didn't she play Smugfu this season and the girl who did that chuuni explosion a little while ago? Not huge but she's been progressively getting more roles since Yotsugi.</br></br>  <br>I'd fuck Sasuko.</br>  <br>First we didn't even know if Sakura would be a cuck until the gaiden came out, but it just makes it even better tasting.</br>  <br>Woops, thought you were talking about Saori at first</br>  <br>Well then all of them are Ladies except Sakura the Destroyer of Houses.</br>  <br>Gai will have a flashback about the time he first meet coolest guy</br>   leaves wife and daughter for ~12 years <br> is completely capable of contacting them either by phone tech or bird or ninja summon shit but never does <br> doesn't look remotely pleased to see his wife and instead just asks her why she's even there <br> never even kissed his wife <br> not even that bothered when she was kidnapped <br> more interested in/worried about naruto when nardo is a god level ninja and his daughter is only 12 and wife who is in apparent poor health (fainting fits) <br> fails to recognize and points sword at own daughter <br> continues to avoid talking to said daughter <br> probably fucked another woman and made sakura raise the child </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone but faggots would a Sasuko.</br>  <br>It's just Sakura's fodder genes ruining the Uchiha genes. SHANNARRO!!</br>  <br>And don't forget the piece de resistance<br> returning to the village after 12 years only to train your daughter's shithead rival instead of her </br></br>  <br>What a great guy, would give full custody of my child to.</br>  <br>and yet people call this manga garbage and hate on narutads</br>  <br><br>It's more that she has the decorum and environment of an actual ninja-aristocrat, which she is (Shikamaru is ninja-gentry, but old blood and respectable). Hinata could do it too, but she's living out her lifelong fantasy of a comfy homelife after winning the ramenbowl instead; it's her choice to make.</br></br>  <br>It's almost like a comedy by this point. Now we're just trying to see how much more Sauce can neglect his daughter. It's amazing.</br>  <br>I haven't read Baruto but this is fucking hilarious his facial expression after she runs out, he gives no fucks</br>  <br>Too bad he will lose to Boruto.<br><br>Even if the fight gets interrupted by the aliens, it will be Shikadai the one who dodges a bullet.</br></br></br>  <br>Can you not see how concerned he is about Salad.<br><br>He cares a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck does the guy that crops the characters out of the promotional material keep changing Boruto's eye color?</br>  <br> *it will be Shikadai the one who dodges a bolt <br>FTFY</br></br>  So Sarada is closer to Naruto than her own dad, and based on the upcoming movie Boruto is closer to Sasuke than his own dad. They might be more happy by changing dads.  <br>I was ready to call that old Sauce. Like crazy Gaara. He was redeemed. Fresh start.<br><br> Vanishes for 12 years. <br> Plot of Gaiden hinges on his daughter not knowing or trusting her own father wouldn't cheat. <br> Sakura is the mother and the entire message of the Gaiden goes to shit. <br> Karin is the mother, her blood relation will be disregarded, but Sasuke's won't, entire message of the Gaiden goes to shit. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B-but Sasuke-kun was trying to protect her</br>  <br>The cropping makes sense but the eye color thing is just autism.<br><br> DNA <br>The fuck?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is, that the whole "Sakura is a cuck" started out as a joke on the basis that Karin and Salad wear glasses.<br><br>No one really expected Kishi to actually go with that as a plot point later.</br></br></br>  It kinda makes objective sense Sasuke would end up making a babby to be in the narutu cashgrab sequel with Karin, because he actually gave two shits about her:<br> apologised to her exclusively before telling everybody else he didnt care what they thought about him <br> unlocked sharingan ability to save her during bee battle <br> in attempting to sacrifice her unlocked his FULL DARKNESS <br> redhead <br><br>Makes me wonder if he just genjutsu'd Sakura into thinking Salad was hers/that they were married and taking care of his spawn, since he doesn't seem to care about her as anything other than her fitness as his child's caretaking unit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and based on the upcoming movie Boruto is closer to Sasuke than his own dad <br>Guess again fuccboi</br></br>  <br>I think this artist is in on that shoulders joke from a while back.</br>  Do people actually care for this books??  <br>Naruto is what Sarada needs in a dad and Sasuke would probably discipline Bolt better than his parents.<br>They really should switch kids.</br></br>  <br>What if Salad thinks her dad is still a douche by the end of the Gaiden?</br>  <br>Reading books based on comics is like reading books based on video games.</br>  <br>He is meant to be sympathetic. When a main character literally gets away with murder, you kind of have a case for a story being badly written.</br>  <br><br><br><br> "Salad was a mistake." - Sasuke Uchiha </br></br></br></br>  <br>The pirate costume really brings it all together. I wish Sauce dressed like that in the actual series.</br>  <br>Sasuke not ending up with anyone would have made the most sense. But you are a retard if you think he ever cared more about Karin than he did about pink (as little as he did)</br>  <br>Who wants more Uchiha dickings?</br>  <br>They're actually kinda decent.</br>  <br>It's fake.</br>  <br>He forgets that he actually tried to kill her when Danzo showed up with his Izanagi bullshit spam.</br>  <br> Madara Hiden <br>Maybe we'll finally figure out what his stupid fucking MS actually did. I liked the idea of it rewinding time for a few seconds they put into that one game before it was confirmed he was a Rinnegan spammer.</br></br>  <br>Whoever writes them seems to care more about the non-Naruto-and-Sasuke characters than Kishi does.<br><br>Is one about Madara really coming out or is that just fanart?</br></br></br>  <br>Kirin?</br>  <br> Implying Sasuke and Naruto aren't a gay couple with Sarada and Boruto as their kids <br> Implying Hinata and Sakura/Karin aren't egg donors </br></br>  <br><br>Maybe that's why she decides to become Hokage.<br><br>She finally got a father figure to look up to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke was sympathetic in in Shippuden, because he wanted to destroy the tailed beasts (thus putting a stop to their continued misuse) and Konoha. <br>Konoha is basically shitty: filled with unsympathetic villagers who abused a little boy en masse, powerful clans like the Hyuuga who practice slavery without being questioned, the third hokage and pals basically authorised the massacre of the Uchiha clan and forced a child to carry it out, the third literally let Orochimaru leave and continue his human experimentation, and their entire economy is based on churning out child soldiers. Who the fuck wouldn't want to destroy Konoha.<br><br>In Gaiden, he's kind of just a sack of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't be. It's clear as day in that picture.</br>  <br> pirate costume <br>It's not that complex.</br></br>  <br> Sasuke <br> sympathetic <br>Yeah, nah. After the Coolest Guy basically fooled into being a retard I lost all respect for the edgefestival and sympathy he got after his brother died to help alleviate his guilt.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>It's fake. Someone took this Fanart and made the book design around it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Salad decides to be Hokage during graduation <br> Bort immediately shits all over her and her dream <br>   at the end of the movie he decides he wants to be Hokage </br></br></br>  <br>Can his little sister have the 9-tails. I don't need more edgefests from the dynamic duo of edgers.</br>  <br>Well kudos to them, it's damn convincing.<br><br>Someone should pester the assistant until he writes a Madara Hiden. He's doing one for the Akatsuki.</br></br></br>  <br>Other Uchiha are actually getting their novels.<br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-06-21/naruto-franchise-gets-<wbr>3-more-novels/.89535</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Sasuke never gave a fuck about Sakura in Shippuden until ch. 699. And even then he pushed her away, if not more politely than he usually did. <br>He ignored her until she was useful to him, then ignored her again and was happy to let her die, even when he wasn't in full edgelord mode like he was when he would have killed her before. Then he eventually got annoyed with her and basically told her to fuck off before putting her in a violent genjutsu to get her out of his way.<br><br>Sasuke getting with Sai would have made more goddamn sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Karin's not sasuke's type. Sauce needs a woman he can dominate and leave to raise their spawn while he goes to buy ninja cigarettes. If he had chosen Karin she'd ride him day in and day out, only stopping to spit out the occasional child. You can't be an edgy loner when your wife rapes you like you're luka from monster girl quest.</br>  <br>That's like teaching the rasengan to Tenten. She won't do anything with it because she is a borderline background character.</br>  <br><br>For some reason, I doubt he would want to be Hokage, even if he sort of ends up having good terms with Naruto.<br><br>If the whole "looking for your own path" Kishi is trying to implement in this things bears any importance, that is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sasuke was sympathetic <br> he wanted to destroy the tailed beasts <br> and Konoha. <br> and the kages <br> And all shinobi villages <br><br>Purest guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't care, I don't need more CRAWLING IN MY SKIN from the peanut gallery.</br>  <br> For some reason, I doubt he would want to be Hokage, even if he sort of ends up having good terms with Naruto <br>I would like Bolt a lot more as a character if he never wants to be Hokage. He has no reason to. He's not seeking the approval of his village, and he doesn't want to succeed his father by taking over his job. <br><br>Let Salad be the one to sign papers and wear a goofy hat. Bort can fuck off and do his own thing. Maybe become the next Jiraya.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sasuke is strictly Narutosexual</br></br>  <br>He tried to kill Sakura again and again and constantly didn't care if she died during the war wishing for Naruto to have let her die in the lava. His care for her is less than zero. I would care if a baby I didn't know got hit by a car. Sasuke doesn't even care on the most basic human level if Sakura lives or dies.</br>  <br>tbh if Sasuke married Karin, this would be his only appearance in Gaiden:</br>  <br><br>Fucking sith lord Kankuro, everytime.</br></br>  <br> Maybe become the next Jiraya. <br> Sarada wants to become Hokage. <br> Orochimaru wanted to be Hokage until Minato took that from him. <br>Sarada confirmed to have dreams shatter and become next psycho scientist who ran away from home.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true, until shortly after danzo. once he killed Danzo his character became DARKNESS, NO PARENTS as opposed to his taka self who learned how to use black flames to stop his friends for taking the BBT and learned how to extinguish black flames to stop karin from roasting showing he was actually capable of emotion. the he nose dives in quality at this exact page/frame and doesn't get it back until the taka reunion (loses it again shortly after) and finally becomes tolerable for good after losing his arm.  lol jk he's still a massive dick in gaide. just not as much of a shit. </br>  <br> Orochimaru wanted to be Hokage until Minato took that from him <br>That explains why he's free to do whatever he wants. Nurudu probably even considers him a cool guy.</br></br>  <br>When Sasuke had Team Taka he was actually super likeable. I'm glad they got a rock lee style spinoff manga.</br>  <br><br>So this means we have two more chapters?<br>The one released today and the next one on the 6th?</br></br></br>  <br> tf Shikadai becomes hokage </br>  <br>No moron. We get the chapter a week earlier than Japan.</br>  <br>No. Nips get the Gaiden later than we do, strangely enough.</br>  <br> today </br>  <br> tfw when taka was the highlight of shippuden <br>It's kinda said that the side team consisting of characters that would be hate able in any other situation (with the exception of suigetsu of course) are more charming and dynamic than your main fucking cast.</br></br>  <br> implying he won't become Salad's adviser <br> implying he won't groan and gripe his way through her entire term </br></br>  <br>Some Halo books are NYT bestsellers.</br>  <br>Does having kazekage blood count in the chain of nepotism?</br>  <br>It means he'll marry a grumpy sandnigger.</br>  <br>Even Goku's a better husband/father. Step your game up Sauce.</br>  <br>Blood relations aren't nearly as important as being trained by a previous hokage, or at least working alongside one.<br> 1st and 2nd are brothers <br> 3rd was trained by 1st and 2nd <br> 4th was trained by 3rd's student <br> 5th is another of 3rd's students, 1st's granddaughter and 2nd's grandniece <br> 6th was trained by 4th <br> 7th was trained by 6th <br><br>Hebi/Taki was a way better team dynamic than team 7.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that, for all we know, Sakura may still not know the truth of the Uchiha massacre.<br><br>I want to know how much clan history Sarada knows.</br></br></br>  Boruto is hokage material but he is probably going to end like minato in the road to a ninja movie<br>A Mr. Housewife</br>  <br><br>It matters a fuckton. But only for Kazekage, not Hokage. But it matters enough that the Suna elders were shitting themselves at the thought of the Nara clan inheriting Suna.</br></br>  <br>Actually during their time as teammates Sasuke treated Karin and Sakura the same. The only difference was he actually found Karin more useful than Sakura.<br>The only reason Sakura won in the in is because she's riding on Team 7 benefits.</br></br>  <br> implying he won't take parenting advice from Sauce </br>  <br>To be fair the Nara family could probably buy the Sand if they wanted. That place is like the Afghanistan of Nurudu.</br>  <br>It's kinda funny<br><br> As a kid his daddy is too busy with his hokage job to play with him <br> As an adult his waifu is too busy with her hokage job to have sex with him </br></br></br></br>  <br>She and her dad are the last and the uchiha die out when she gets married</br>  Good ridance.  <br>She knows that she's supposed to be the last along with her dad. That's why she was so confused when she first met Onion-kun.<br><br>I don't think she knows about the genocide, though. And the fact that all her relatives were world-infamous mass murderers, two of which helped to start a war that killed 90% of the next generation's grandparents.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Sakura knows anything. Nardo swore to keep it a secret (and did so really at the expense of Sasuke, since the village's sins have never come to light), and Sakura doesn't know that the forehead tap gesture really symbolises gentle distancing.</br>  <br>Reminder Boruto's Va also voiced Sasha from qwaser.  You are welcome. </br>  <br>They should have just given the job to Chiyo after Gaara's dad got killed. She's the only worthwhile ninja that shithole has ever produced.</br>  <br> what is Hiraishin </br>  <br>I don't think he will marry Salad though.<br>Probably just fuck prostitutes.</br></br>  <br>Something that didn't help Naruto show up to his daughter's birthday party. (though to be fair I don't think he knows he has one)</br>  <br> she's the only worthwhile ninja that shithole has ever produced <br> beat Sasori who beat the most powerful Kazekage and sacked a small country <br> still barely even a dribble of piss in the ocean of powerlevels <br>Jesus fuck what happened to this series?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wot aboot sasori?</br></br>  <br>The only reason Sakura "won" was because Kishi realized Sakura realistically giving up on Sauce would make her a "bad person".<br><br>That is to say, if Naruto's pathetic willingness to be emasculated by ebony strangers for the sake of a friend that wants him dead is meant to be heroic, Sakura not doing the same would then not be heroic. In retard logic, of course.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good point, but Sasuke is definitely the lynchpin here. If Sakura isn't willing to tell Sarada her true heritage, she's sure as shit not willing to tell Sarada that her father's family has a hereditary tendency to become psychopathic megalomaniacal murderers.<br>So the real question is "Would Sasuke tell her?"<br>I don't even know if Naruto knows. Seriously, Sasuke has to be the only one who knows at this point. We got 4 infodumps about the massacre: Sasuke alone with Itachi, Sasuke alone with Obito, Sasuke alone with Danzo, Sasuke and Orochimaru alone with the revived kage who of course already knew.<br> why aren't we getting this sakura in the gaiden she's the only sakura I'd fug <br><br> implying Baki <br>He got away with killing based Hayate Gekko, that's enough for me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> marries Salad <br> cheats on her with his little sister <br> makes her raise the kid <br> yeah... sorry'ttebasa </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh didn't know that, it really is strange, does this apply only to Gaiden or WSJ in general?</br></br>  Remember when Sakura was almost becoming likeable then regressed straight back to ohh Sasuke-kun ignore me more ohhhh  <br>Consistent retard logic at least for that specific case.</br>  <br> Uchiha <br> Hokage <br> Not burrito <br>HAHAHAHA...No</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura doesn't know that the forehead tap gesture really symbolises gentle distancing. <br> itachi does it every time he "doesn't have time for sasuke right now" <br> itachi does it with sasuke when he dies, because this will be the most distancing event of all <br> itachi does it again as he gets called back to the afterlife, because after a brief time together they must be separated again <br> sasuke immediately leaving sakura to travel the world <br>It's true.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't even know if Naruto knows <br>Obito told Naruto, Kakashi and Yamato everything about the massacre just a few moments after this scene  in what appears to be some teenage girl thinking about her unrequited crush.</br></br>  <br>I always hated her.</br>  <br><br> incest with her sister while cheating on salad <br> pregnant sunflower with bort's spawn <br><br>My dick can only get so hard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br><br><br> though to be fair I don't think he knows he has one <br>He probably thinks that Bolt is just going through a phase where he pretends to be a girl just like him as a kid.<br><br>Also Nurudu never learned Hiraishin. Only Shunshin. Which is fucking retarded because Hiraishin is probably the most useful technique in history. Here's hoping Bort inherits it since he's shaping up to be a more butch Minato with lightning tech.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I am not looking at Bolt the same way again.</br>  <br> that page <br>Jesus fuck it's like something straight out of a shoujo. No wonder people always saw Nurudu as the bitch in the relationship.</br></br>  <br>You have to be genius to use Hirashin for some reason. I guess it requires calculations or some shit.</br>  <br> Kiba is still going after pussy </br>  <br>Kishi thinks women are bad people if they give up on their childhood crushes? That must mean that Sakura is a bad character because Kishimoto has the attitude of a massive fucking shut in virgin lol<br><br>Her moving on from Sasuke would have been great character development.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura actually fell in love with Sasuke due to the time they spent together on team seven unlike the other girls at the academy.</br>  <br>His grandma was a better puppet style user. Sasori still lost despite having better puppets and with all the shit he did to his body.</br>  <br><br> Sauce taps Salad's forehead this week <br>doesn't come back until the movie to train Burrito</br></br></br>  <br> You have to be genius to use Hirashin for some reason <br>All the more reason for Banana-kun to use it.</br></br>  <br>Only one of his puppets was good. It was their numbers plus poison on their weapons that made them deadly.</br>   we will never get a fight like Shino v Kankuro   <br> lol </br>  <br>Blame Japanese children.</br>  <br> Naruto moving on from Sasuke would have been great character development. <br><br>[citation needed]</br></br></br>  <br>He's right though, what kind of person would depict that kind of relationship as good?<br>Probably the kind of person that can't show a fucking dating relationship</br></br>  <br> guy who needs chakra strings to control puppets <br> versus a guy whose bug swarms do nothing but eat chakra <br>Was there a more one-sided matchup than that?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh please<br><br> Bugs eating the chakra threads <br> Bugs eating the wooden puppets inside out <br> Bugs eating Kankuro's insides <br><br>It would be one sided as fuck.<br><br>Shino has never failed to deliver.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, Kankuro probably would have bought it if his father hadn't shown up with poison-eating bugs.</br>  <br>She was beginning to be liked by people during her fight with Sasori, but she didn't do anything after that and it was all downhill from there.</br>  <br>You do realize we got that fight, right?</br>  <br>No, she started liking him before that and she didn't even know him. Sasuke ignored her most of the time they were on the same team. They didn't really bond anything worth holding onto her entire life.</br>  Do you like healthy girls, /a/?

The guy will definitely swallow it." <br> "You got off from the road of sympathy... It's more about the wallet than sincerity now." <br> Even thought there is nothing wrong with that way of thinking, this feels bad. <br> "I wouldn't be happy with it..." <br> "Well, that was a joke, I just tried to imitate Senpai..." <br><br>I thought that was said by 8man if weren't for the Yui-senpai at the beginning<br><br> I just want Komachi to meet Iroha and see the results. <br><br>Iroha has done everything Komachi ddid (even the 8man imitation).

Only that we don't know either way and that one line isn't anything to go by.<br><br>It's seems clear to me that the author has deliberately tried to avoid spilling the beans on Hachiman's romantic feelings. All he gives is the vaguest hints that have to be interpreted and poured over to see. And such hints have come for all the girls in recent volumes.<br><br>It's fun for the waifu wars to act like we know what Hachiman feels. But it's naive to think we've really been given the truth on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I want to kill this fucken cunt </br>    <br>I seriously hope not, because even he should know that the next volume will focus on Yukino's growth.</br>  <br>You think wrong.</br>  I wonder if Toradora threads were like this when the novels were coming out along with the show.<br><br>I wonder how the show and the novels would be received today.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I didn't mean to jump to conclusions. It's just that particular scene I was expecting a little more from in the LN version. In the anime his voice strained a bit, and I thought maybe the no blushing was FEEL screwing Yui again, but it really turned out to not give anything strong to work with after all.<br><br><br>I was referring to the lines in order. Showing a desire to talk to someone you spend practically every day with doesn't imply romance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She already said that during the scene when they meet with Orimoto</br>  <br><br>Think about it, Komachi knows she could take care of her onii-chan if things went wrong. She also knows that he can rely on her and that she understands him.<br>Really, Komachi might ship them together like mad.</br></br></br>  <br>Toradora threads were probably worse than this. The Taiga tripfag was cancer.</br>  I bet komachi would be so turned off and intimidated by Iroha because they are pretty similar that komachi would be forced to jump into action and start attracting 8man to prevent her from being with komachi. She's okay with yukinon and yui because they aregullible and she knows she can easily deceive them while she dips into that sweet 8inch behind their backs   If there's one person that can actually help push a girl to victory, it's Komachi. <br> Haruno has Komachi's number and may very well have talked to her off-screen <br>Yup, the Haruno end is inevitable.</br></br>  <br><br>And she didnt even lose, he just doesnt like to know that yukino is just an inmature autistic little girl.</br></br>  <br> She rated 8man's date in points. </br>  いろはす～   「先輩、おっそーい」 <br> "Seniors, so yummy!?" <br><br>Bing translation is so funny.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, so much for not reading side material</br></br>  <br> umbrella <br> in snow <br><br>Komachi way r u doin?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the better assumption is that he does have feelings of love for all three girls, and its just a matter of which one he decides is the one he loves most.<br><br>Otherwise yes, waifu eats are ultimately pointless, but you should know by now that's not going to stop anything</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>He's slowly translating it. He added another subsection for Ch 1 Today (ends right before the Iroha request scene)</br></br></br>  <br>He's just discouraged, that doesn't mean he won't do it.</br>  <br>It's scary how she managed to understand perfectly 8man and his way of thinking in just 3/4 months</br>  <br>If Iroha and Komachi met they would both realize at that moment that 8man is a gigantic siscon</br>  <br>No automated translator can get that right, because it's writen in such a way that only a human can notice the true translation.</br>  <br>How dense can you possibly be to ignore the constant romantic hints throughout the series and say there's nothing to go by? Your way of thinking is useless and contributes nothing.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>If komachi sees herself in Iroha, then she'll love her because like somebody else said it already, komachi knows that komachi can take good care of 8man.</br>  <br>  It's just that particular scene I was expecting a little more from in the LN version. <br><br>LN scene :<br><br> That’s why, I took in the mood and decided to ask now. <br><br> “By the way…” <br><br> I squeezed out those words with a hoarse voice and Yuigahama turned around. Her inclined head and her eyes urged me to go on. Seeing her straight-on was somewhat dazzling that I slightly averted my face. <br><br> “…Do you have a day you’re free on soon?” <br><br>Now try to compared it with anime scene.<br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Orimoto scene was part of the Christmas event (it even appeared in the anime)<br><br><br>Do you know what happens when the snow on your robes melts?</br></br></br></br>   “…I’ll be honest with you.” <br><br> The tone of her voice was deeper than the one she used earlier to talk. Because my head was held in place, I could only move my eyes to look at Hiratsuka-sensei and she had a slightly sad smile. <br><br> “It really doesn’t have to be you. Someday, Yukinoshita will change and she might even meet someone that can understand her. There might be someone who can take the extra step for her. The same could be said of Yuigahama as well.” <br><br> Just when would that be? It seemed like something so far into the future that it wasn’t realistic at all, yet at the same time, it seemed so close that I felt it was awfully real. <br><br> “I’m sure you guys feel that your time now is everything. But that’s not true at all. It’ll eventually make sense to you. After all, that’s how the world is made.” <br><br> Those words were probably correct. Someday, somewhere, someone would definitely step over the line for her. When I thought about that unsteady truth, I recalled the slight pain inside me and I twisted my body to brush it off. <br><br>So Hachiman hates the thought of someone getting close to Yukino and he does eventually step over the line with her, but what was that pain inside him?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least he's trying to keep his promise, but there's no way he'd be calm when asking a girl out, just because it's yui doesn't mean anything special.</br>  <br>Cant wait to see the monologues where he has to reject a girl<br><br>I can already somewhat envision how he'd reject Iroha.<br><br>A Yui rejection scene would be incredibly hard for him but it might also involve Yui also realizing where his feelings lie <br><br>No fucking idea how'd he reject Yukino (once she gets past moeblob stage and reaches her final form). Maybe something like Yuki fell out of love or something (unlikely) or they mutually agree it'd never work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe. I don't see this reaching some anguished moment for Hachiman like in a lot of other harem series where the protagonist goes "I like them all, why can't I decide?!" He's going to pick one and then whether he ever had romantic interest in the other girls will be minimized or ignored.<br><br>It's more like the "romantic interest" from Hachiman is so vague and unclear, that for whichever girl wins we will be able to dismiss the moments for the other girls as fans overthinking it. If Iroha wins for instance, people are going to point to the 'indirect kiss' as some pivotal moment that shows it. If she doesn't, then it will have never mattered as much as people thought. The same goes for Yukino's moment on the water ride. And this and other scenes for Yui would be the same way.<br><br>But yeah, trying to stop the waifu wars is an exercise in futility.<br><br>I feel like rather than trying to figure what Hachiman feels, when the author clearly doesn't want to give it away. It's much more enjoyable to see how the girls themselves make their feelings clear along with the other more significant drama in the story and just wait for Wataru to tell us about Hachiman's romantic inclinations clearly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;“I’m sure you guys feel that your time now is everything. But that’s not true at all. It’ll eventually make sense to you. After all, that’s how the world is made.” <br>Foreshadowing</br></br>  <br> he does eventually step over the line with her <br>Are you even reading what you post?</br></br>  <br>Wait, when did this occur? I dont remember reading the part where he felt pain at the idea that someone could get close to Yuki<br><br>Is this new?</br></br></br>  Here's a list of all interesting Iroha Videos on Nico<br>For those that don't know how to use jap Nico or don't bother to.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW</br></br>  <br> I can already somewhat envision how he'd reject Iroha. <br>Really nigga?</br></br>  <br> No fucking idea how'd he reject Yukino (once she gets past moeblob stage and reaches her final form) <br>Something like he doesn't want to risk having her going back to being a helpless girl.<br>Or just straight up 'I have feelings for somebody else.'</br></br></br>  <br>It's special because he did in at Valentine day of all time and with Valentine mood. Like this anon explain here .</br>  <br>The more important element of that first quote is that he's actually thinking "man, why do I want to talk to her so badly"<br><br>I just can't see that coming from nothing but friendship</br></br></br>  <br>Him stepping over the line was him asking her what Yukino's career path is.<br><br> “This is the first time you’ve asked me something like that, isn’t it?” <br> “Really?” <br> I knew that, but I pretended not to. <br> For all this time, there were plenty of opportunities to ask personal things like that, but I had drawn a line that I swore not to step over. It’s because I thought I wouldn’t be forgiven if I did. <br><br>It may seem petty but for Hachiman its a big deal. Similar to how its a big deal when he asks Yui if she had free time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Back to my previous point. <br><br>I don't think there is a love triangle at the end of volume 11. Both girls signaled to eachother to be genuine and follow their feelings.</br></br>  How long until we return to decent, peaceful threads?  <br>It's from the bridge scene with sensei in Vol9.<br><br><br>He has his own view of what is stepping over the line with Yukino.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't v-day when he did it. He just saw a moment that gave him the proper mood to ask her out and keep his promise.</br>  <br><br>Never.<br><br>It's all shitposting and waifu wars from now until the finish line.</br></br></br></br>   No fucking idea how'd he reject Yukino <br><br>He can do it. With a smile, he'll say "Don't you remember, we can't be friends right?".</br></br>  The lack of yukinofags and yuifags is strange lately<br><br>Would this be an iroha general thread in the future?</br></br>  <br>Yes it's different, but it's not different enough to mean anything especially significant. 8man being embarrassed because he has no idea how to ask a girl out is nothing we didn't know about.<br><br>I was expecting more than just some embarrassment out of that scene, since it's basically the only scene 8man has alone with Yui in the entire volume. (Unless FEEL cut entire Yui scenes like they did Iroha)</br></br></br>  <br>Last thread was relatively peaceful until burgerland started coming home.</br>  <br>No, Valentines Day is aquarium date<br><br>Remember, the chocolate event was a pre Vday event</br></br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Yukinoshitters got BTFO. They can't be as smug and stuck-up as they used to be anymore.</br>  <br>Say it ain't so, anon. S2 has been the worst thing to happen to this fanbase since the blogshit in early S1 threads.</br>  <br>Nah, we'll have our weekly threads on saturdays once these BTB finally die.<br>Also, I can't blame them because the Iroha spoilers that we got so far are amazing.</br></br>  <br>Now that's beta.</br>  <br>That seems something like Yukino would say (since shes always the one who says that they cant be). I get your point though<br><br>Though if you take that line by itself, one could spin it so that Yukino means that they cant be friends, but it doesnt say that they cant be bf/gf. <br><br>Semantics</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The "step over" he was talking about was the obvious problem she has with the family. Like he always said, he doesn't want any of it. Remember, it was Haruno who made a request to him to ask Yukino's career path.</br></br>  <br> "Don't you remember, we can't be friends right?". <br>"I don't recall asking you to be my friend.</br></br>  <br> He just saw a moment that gave him the proper mood to ask her out <br><br>And this is the stressing point we're discussing, Anon-kun. It would make more sense if he read the mood, reminded about the date promise and brushed it off for later.</br></br></br>  <br> general thread <br><br>Stop that. These threads will hopefully be dead by next week, LN translation and BD releases notwithstanding.</br></br></br>  <br>Why was Yukino so sad to give in to Yui on that one? All Yui was saying she wants to be friends.</br>  What's wrong with him?  <br>There's no point on brushing it off later, he was well aware of the elephant in the room that kept growing with the incoming v-day.<br>The next scene inside the club room confirms that.</br></br>  <br>Yui was saying many things, none of which Yukino had any say in. Yukino was very reluctant to give in at that moment, probably because she realizes her dependence on both Yui and 8man.</br>  <br> Missing the entire point <br><br>We're asking about his motivation during "that" scene which some people saw it like more than just "want to fill dat promise soon".</br></br></br>  <br><br> Liking a poorfag </br></br>  <br>Too much alpha. His life and decisions depend on his status.</br>  <br>Because she wanted the 8dick and gave up on him too for the sake of the forced friendship</br>  <br> of the elephant in the room that kept growing with the incoming v-day <br>I'm stupid but what was it if not the date? Yukino's dependence?</br></br>  <br>I'm still talking about 8man's motivation during that scene, Anon. There was no elephant in his inner monologue during that exact scene (before entering the room)</br>  <br> Liking a basket case </br>  <br>Conflicted. She doesn't want Yui giving up, she doesn't want to give up, and her usual recurring thought she could mess this up again.<br><br><br>Nothing. It was the whole world around him that was wrong.</br></br></br></br>  I just realized something - Iroha is what Komachi would be without the 8man.  <br>That both girls have the hots for him......<br><br>Yuki's dependence was fully revealed until the 2nd half of Vol 11</br></br></br>  <br> Choosing someone based on their wealth <br>You don't even deserve to look at her.</br></br>  <br> he was well aware of the elephant in the room that kept growing with the incoming v-day. <br>The next scene inside the club room confirms that.<br><br>But this scene below show he is just start aware elephant in club room yet.<br> She shot a glance to the door of the club. After that, she had trouble bringing out her voice. And unlike earlier, her expression sank. <br><br> I was slightly surprised to see that and hesitated to ask why she was making that face, finding myself choking as well. The air in the hallway was awfully cold and dry that I had an uneasy sensation as if something was stuck in my throat. <br><br> Asking her that now in this place might’ve not been the best choice. Or perhaps, there might’ve been a better or smoother way to do so. Would it be weird to ask again? I just wasn’t confident in any of those. <br><br> Unable to exchange any more words, I glanced at her face, my back still slumped and my eyes downcast. The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> liking a girl because of money </br>  <br>I'm rich and I can understand haruno, i'm the oldest daughter too.<br><br>I would be happier with a normie life</br></br></br>   かたや雪ノ下はなぜか上から目線でふっとやや高圧的な微笑みを浮かべた。<wbr>二人の姿にちよっと気圧された様子の一色が若干言葉を濁らせる。</wbr> <br><br>Iroha doesn't have any feeling for 8man they said.<br><br>(currently reading chapter 1, right where Iroha asking for 8man sweet reference.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino and Yui fags are already coming out for the day, and a few more hours from now they'll be the bulk of the thread until Irohafags start walking up again.</br>  <br>Yahallo~!</br>  <br>I disagree, it's not uncommon at all for 8man to do a "wait, why did I do that" retrospective monologue. Him hanging back to talk to Yui would be a new development for him, but it would be a friendship development regardless.<br><br>You guys need to remember 8man is still a pretty big autist in terms of general friendship, not just romance.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thankfully, she has an equally rich and more sane sister  who will win the 8man bowl .</br></br>  <br>Thanks, I know exactly what that quote says.</br>  <br>Yurpoor Irohafag, I bet your glad you have free medical care for all that butthurt, huh?</br>  <br><br>8man is not dense, anons. He doesn't need to remind himself all the time that he knows that Yui likes him and that he made a promise for a date.<br>This issue has been growing since volume 10.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet it was the first time someone honestly asked her to become friends</br>  <br>I'm just here mostly just reading the thread. Don't want to disturb Irohafags having fun.</br>  OST FUCKING WHEN<br>I NEED THOSE FEEL PIANO TRACKS</br>  <br>It probably was, but at least the second time she tells him exactly why they couldn't be friends.</br>  I hate how we kept being led on with 8man's hitting on Iroha all the time. We all know she has approx. 0 chance of winning. Why does 8man hit on her? Is it an automatic reflex because she resembles Komachi?  <br> he knows that Yui likes him <br><br>That would be out of character for him. He always denying/rejecting the idea of girls have any feelings on him and act based on that knowledge. He has trauma regarding "too confident" attitude, remember? Also, honey toast scene confirmed it.</br></br></br>  <br> Don't want to disturb Irohafags having fun. <br>In what way would your posts disturb anyone, especially us?<br><br>Unless you're the denialfag or something, of course.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Icequeen Yukino was just an illusion </br>  <br>Come on, anon. He knew about it for some time, but denial is denial.<br>The problem just got bigger to the point of him not being able to ignore it anymore.</br></br>  <br>I know he is not dense anon <br>but in that scene show he just START aware elephant within club room after seeing Yui reaction to his invitation.<br>Before that he is in valentine mood and invite her by himself.<br><br>If he totally aware elephant in club room before that scene, Why would he invite Yui in first place where it could make thing even worse?</br></br></br></br></br>  Dont see why people keep latching onto a few scenes from Ch 1; yes its great that Yui got development on her friend but lets not blow it up.<br><br>Yuki's scenes are yet to come and this is the end of Yui's until double date.</br></br>  <br><br>He knew since the fireworks festival.</br></br>  <br>*on her front</br>  Now that's beautiful.  <br>He knew Yui likes him since forever, just that his cynical mind kept telling him that it was out of kindness, even post Vol. 4. <br><br>He only started considering the romantic possibility recently since around the events in Vol. 9-10 or so, though.</br></br></br>  <br>The Yui/Yukino rejection is easy.<br> "Sorry, but you're not my type." <br><br>A blunt final rejection would be pretty fitting for the series, since it's about being direct and sincere about your feelings, rather than hiding behind excuses and pretense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Yukino even realizes that wearing those thigh high socks of her is fucking lewd as hell. God damn it.</br>  <br>So when he does get the idea that Yuki likes him? Vol 11?</br>  <br>Indeed she is. Best girl by a mile.</br>  Anyone have the picture explaining the meaning behind yesterday's episode?  <br>'Elephant in the room' is always in the back of his mind whenever he's close to Yui, simply because he knows about what she feels and what she wants.<br><br> If he totally aware elephant in club room before that scene, Why would he invite Yui in first place where it could make thing even worse? <br>Because that's the right thing to do, volume 11 literally ended with him saying that hurting people it's ok if it's genuine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get why she didn't accept his friendship. At this point they are friends though.</br>  <br> Sorry, but you're not my type <br>Really faggot</br></br>  <br>Denial is the key term here. He knows on a subconscious level, but because he's trying to avoid misunderstandings like his middle school days, he refuses to believe the evidence in front of him<br><br><br>It's not "latching onto a few scenes" it's discussing new lines for the scene spoiled last thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>vol2</br></br>    <br>Hachiman doesn't have a type, he used that as an excuse to not say that he ends up liking anyone that was nice to him</br>  Before someone starts spouting genuine this, not genuine that, let's make it clear what genuine means for 8man.<br><br>It's difficult to define what is genuine, but it's easier to identify what's not genuine for him<br> Hayama's clique: Tobe likes Ebina, but Ebina doesn't want to be in any kind of relationship <br> Hayama and Miura are against Tobe confessing his love because he would get rejected and therefore the group would fell apart. <br> The Service club starts acting like them. The girls harbor feelings for 8man but they are afraid of getting rejected or the club disappearing because of their actions.  <br><br>Genuine is about the feelings. It doesn't necessary need to be connected with telling or not telling lies</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man's a siscon, he loves playful younger girls like Komachi. Iroha is very clearly his type, the club members aren't.</br>  <br>I can see it too. "You're a wonderful girl but (Y) is just too important to me."</br>  <br>Because end goal is him asking her again to be girlfriend<br><br>I mean dude already felt passion and heart beating faster when asking her to be his friend. <br><br> I felt my heart beat a little faster. It was like my heart was saying it wanted to beat faster than the ticking of the second hand and beyond. <br><br> I felt the remaining passion from the festival welling up in my body. I posed the question again and the new answer I arrived at is my conclusion <br><br>Wonder what Try#3 will entail</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hikki is a genius of wisdom, but it comes with a critical flaw -- he has trouble seeing the good side of things. It was mentioned he could actually become a cult leader -- even though it was a joke, it's probably true. If he ever decided to become a bad guy he could easily manipulate people.<br><br>And you know what? I also note the people around him don't bother trying to set him straight on this.</br></br>  <br> 'Elephant in the room' is always in the back of his mind whenever he's close to Yui, simply because he knows about what she feels and what she wants. <br><br>[citation needed]<br><br>or Source: from Your ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  So wait, the end result of EP 13 is that if there is a love triangle and there is a winner there will be no hard feelings and everyone can be friends. I had the impression that if someone were to win 8man before that then it would wreck everything.  <br> genius of wisdom <br>Slight hyperbole there.</br></br>  <br> Cooking is all about sincerity. The most important thing in homemade cooking is kindness and feelings. Thoughts about your partner lead the way to the progress. Because your partner is a guy who knows nothing about pastry making. So handmade is easy-peasy. You can get a low-cost mass product, show a little ingenuity and make some individual customizations. The guy will definitely swallow it. <br>isn't that almost the same shit 8man said when they were helping Yui with the cookies?</br></br>  <br>He already is a cult leader. The club is the cult.<br><br>Both Yui and Yukino are basically broken and look to him for guidance.</br></br></br>  <br>That completely contradicts him doing it because of the "valentine mood" though. Wanting to let her down is one thing, but trying to do it specifically because of valentines day would be adding insult to injury.</br>  <br>It is, I thought that too during translation</br>  <br>Yes he and Iroha make the argument that it is the thought that counts. Cept Iroha branches off into budgets and money with hers while Hachiman's was about how Yui's cooking skills are awful</br>  <br>That would be the stupidest, lamest most non-genuine way, and a hack writeup for WW</br>  <br>Toradora threads were in few ways. The threads were more active because the show was insanely popular for one. Also there was some hilarious drama with the sub groups for the anime. Started being subbed by gg and then Koda and company said "fuck this show" so their translator started a side project just for Toradora called qq, but he was slow and people were pissed, and somewhere around that time people split off of gg to make coalguys too, which was amusing. Only shit with the novels was anons that read them saying shit like "you guys are going to freak out next episode". They didn't really post translations because people would get mad about spoilers.</br>  Why doesn't 8man just go to the clubroom one day and just straight up tell the girls that he doesn't love them romantically, he isn't currently interested in a relationship, and that they should stop it. There, no heart break from either of them.  <br> They didn't really post translations because people would get mad about spoilers. <br>That's unlike /a/ now</br></br>  <br>Everyone comes to him for guidance, even people not in the club.<br><br>He lacks charisma though. He just needs to lift.</br></br></br>  <br> 8man's a siscon <br>Have you ever considered that they're having a healthy sibling relationship? Also the talk with Hayama pretty much confirmed that he doesn't have any specific types. The only 'type' he prefer are girls can take care of a dead weight</br></br>  <br> The only 'type' he prefer are girls can take care of a dead weight <br>Basically Komachi.</br></br>  <br>Didn't he just say it in his genuine speech at the end of vol. 11 that he thinks (to be genuine) he doesn't want lies and deceptions to / from people who are important to him? Telling lies may not be all there is, but it seems to be a part of 8man's definition of "genuine", whatever that is.</br>  <br>This. <br>He's almost 3rd year, he needs to study and decide about the future, yet they force drama onto him. <br>All he needs now is sweet romcom.</br></br></br>  Can't they just do a threesome and have everything solved happily?  <br>The first and third lines are Hayama. Hayama is saying 8man doesn't know what his type is, and/or that the "much quieter and louder girls" (an obvious hint at Yukino/Yui) he's liked in the past weren't his type.</br>  <br>Indeed, brother. And we both know just who has been providing that sweet romcom for some time now.</br>  <br>Iroha is Komachi</br>  <br>If you mean, 8man, Komachi and Iroha, then yes, that would fix everything and more.</br>  <br>Because if he *is* actually looking for a relationship, that wouldn't be genuine.</br>  <br>I'm sure there would be more to it than that, but that would be the gist of it. Iroha has plenty of romance flags, but 8man cares enough about Y+Y to struggle and endure pain to keep them in his life.</br>  <br> He likes her as a sister <br> His preferred type is basically her sister <br> So he's a siscon! <br>Really faggot?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally the happiest ending out there.</br>    <br>Komachi deserves better than 8man.</br>  <br> Have you ever considered that they're having a healthy sibling relationship? <br>Anon this is a Taiwanese textbook visualization production we're talking about. The protagonist has gone as far as saying he'd marry Komachi if she weren't his sibling, that having an imouto is better than being married, and has been called siscon by other members of the cast.<br><br>Komachi and Iroha by extension is very much his type.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br><br>T-thanks Watari, now I got a 2D poorfag fetish</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The protagonist has gone as far as saying he'd marry Komachi if she weren't his sibling <br>He said he'd prefer to stay with Komachi rather than be married.<br><br>That's because she takes care of him and doesn't really judge him for his actions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this a new kind of denialfag? Holy shit this is tiresome.</br>  <br> poorfag <br> smiling all the time <br> still able to make 8man have fun at the date <br>It's impossible to dislike Iroha.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Precisely.<br><br>And really, are there even any major parallels between Komachi and Iroha other than "younger"?</br></br></br>  <br> Iroha by extension is very much his type <br>She doesn't want a dead weight to take care of.</br></br>  <br>Aside from also being sly, no.</br>  <br>attitude, banter etc etc</br>  <br>I wouldn't pay 130 yen for a canned beverage either.<br><br>8man is like some fag who buys red bull.</br></br></br>  <br>Check the OP.</br>    <br>Actually, 8man thought a few times that Iroha is pretty much like Komachi, just that Komachi is more sly when it comes to interacting with him. There should be more similarities than just "being younger".</br>  <br>M-my heart</br>  <br> implying she would only buy one can. </br>  <br>More like this Komachi/Iroha thing is today's flavor of delusion from Irohafags.<br><br>You are now reminded that if anything, 8man putting them in the same category means imoutozoning, not victory.</br></br></br>  <br>Similar personality, gets along with 8man really well without drama, younger, talks scoring points, off the top of my head.<br><br>And of course there's the fact that 8man likens her to Komachi very frequently.</br></br></br>  <br> That's because she takes care of him and doesn't really judge him for his actions. <br>[CITATION FUCKING NEEDED]</br></br>  <br>More like <br> Wakes up at 4am smiling thinking about the date <br> Buy Anna Sui, pink yarn ball while smiling thinking about the date </br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br><br>Please anons. I didn't want to like Iroha this much.</br></br>  <br><br>8man loves girls like his sister.<br><br>Read the karaoke scene during yui's birthday in the LN. He literally said it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha's so imoutozoned that 8man lusts over her lips multiple times in each volume.</br>  <br>You're triggering my autism</br>  <br> 8man loves girls like his sister </br>    <br>Stupid sexy Tobe.</br>  <br>Also, on the same episode<br> Foreboding </br></br>  So I didn't pick this up until recently and then I just marathoned both seasons. This leaves me a bit confused by the threads. It sounds as if the anime is pretty much caught up to the LNs? What volumes did it actually cover?  「……シスコン？」<br>「…… Feet? 」<br>「ばっかちげぇよ」<br>"All bark poop!"<br><br>Ha ha ha, now I'm reading bing translation just for entertainment. This is way too funny,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the karaoke chapter.</br>  <br>He doesn't think of Iroha as non-blood-related Komachi only, so no imouto-zone here.<br> Isshiki had a sly part to her that would skillfully use her immaturity and innocence to her advantage. That was a part that resembled my little sister, Hikigaya Komachi. However, her cuteness and charm was lacking. Therefore, I could conclude that Isshiki Iroha was an example of an absolutely uncute Komachi. <br><br> As far as outer appearances and scheming were concerned, Yukinoshita Haruno came to mind. But she fell absolutely short of her. Therefore, Isshiki Iroha could be said to be an inferior Haruno-san. <br><br> That fluffy aura of hers. That resembled closely to Meguri-senpai, but fundamentally, they were different creatures. Therefore, Isshiki Iroha was a phony Meguri. <br><br> That desire to be pampered was probably very similar to Sagami. But unlike Sagami, she was much more skillful. Therefore, Isshiki Iroha was something like a super amplified Sagami. <br><br> I also thought that how she made a character for herself and behaved in a way to preserve that was very similar to Orimoto Kaori. Therefore, Isshiki Iroha was a different type of Orimoto. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm reading bing translation just for entertainment <br>You didn't before?</br></br>  <br>I don't get it, he gets her a Pan-san every year.</br>  Iroha really was a mistake. Watari should have left the romcom elements of the series die on the vine after he decided to make this a more serious story.  <br> 「……シスコン？」 <br> 「…… Feet? 」 </br></br>  <br>I provided you evidence, why would I look one for you?</br>  <br>He said like his sister, not his sister.</br>  <br>Yes, S2 ends at the same point as volume 11.</br>  <br>Because<br/></br>  <br>So is the iroha date thing something they just didn't adapt to the anime or something?</br>  <br> smiling all the time </br>  <br><br>Lol, i mean <br><br>I didnt say that 8man would fuck her sister, I said that he said during the karaoke party that he likes girls like her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well I was just using the english text to mark the progression (I'm not that fluent in moon so wall of runes confuses me).</br>  <br>Iroha date is a side story.</br>  <br>10.5 was a side volume, so it probably wouldn't have been included in the main run anyway</br>  <br>Fuuck that, why would you do that?<br>I know it's not literally smiling all the time, but those faces are painful to look at.</br></br>  Why is yui after the 8dick?  <br> 1 hour earlier to the date she stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pray for an OVA<br>The S1 OVA was a side volume too? or it was original</br></br>  <br>Don't you dare convincing me jumping ships</br>  <br>Yes, as was the bonus episode</br>    <br>My heart.</br>  <br>this scene reminds me that we can never see her in anime form any more (except for the OVA).<br>sad Iroha, sly Iroha, disgusted Iroha, devilish Iroha, surprised Iroha, dejected Iroha, heartbroken Iroha, confident Iroha, genuine Iroha...<br><br>Wow, she had a lot of expression in just few episodes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Original, later adapted by WW.<br> still no webm for this scene </br></br>  If Iroha is poor<br>If the cunt is rich<br><br>that explain why she goes after him at the begining</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha will always be "just kinda there" tier for me but even I think this writefaggotry is cute as hell.</br>  <br> I wonder how it would look if someone took it off <br>Thus, Yukinon became the moeblob she is now.</br></br>  <br>You could even say that she was late to the date because she didn't want to spend money on the train.</br>  <br><br>Ok thanks, that clears shit up for me. <br><br>I was about to say, that sounds like an ova, but they haven't announced one yet. They will probably throw it in retroactively in season 3 if they don't do an ova and the iroha thing picks up steam going forward in the LNs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't ever say things like that</br>  <br>S3 when<br> S3 never </br></br>  <br>Movie in three years<br><br>  to be released in parallel with volume 12 </br></br></br>  <br>The ending will get adapted at some point, that's when we'll get in-love Iroha.</br>   I'm a bad person because I tried to force my best friend to confess her feelings to the boy she likes instead of stealing it from her straightaway <br>What was Yui supposed to do?</br>  <br>Jump ship to a better anime.</br>  <br><br>Should have just stolen him away like Setsuna did. Fuck Yukino and Kazusa.</br></br>  I've been away from the threads for a while now. What were the Iroha spoilers?  <br> Should have just stolen him away <br>What makes you think she could have done that? Iroha has been trying that for a while now and she's still imouto-zoned.</br></br>  <br> Junen Mae. <br> Iroha getting bullied at playground for being poor. <br> Another poorfag comes out to save her, and buys her a random drink from a vending machine. <br> Tells her his name is Ha-kun. <br> She promises to pay him back one day with sweets. <br> They start hanging out all summer long. <br> One day sees him hanging around another little girl gets jelly as fuck and avoids him. <br> Boy goes around everywhere looking for her. <br> He tells her the other girl was his sister, gives her a locket he saved up all his allowance to buy, and tells her he's moving away. <br><br>Iroha hanging out with random boys with Ha in their name, trying to find that boy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> like Setsuna did <br>Boy you didn't know the ending huh?</br></br>  <br> Yukino and Kazusa <br>Truly the worst girls.</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>It's hard to say. Not only it depends on the popularity of the show, or how good can Watari deliver the final chapter (that won't piss the nips so much they boycott the entirely franchise), publisher decisions, and the animation studio also (iirc only J.C.Staff. has the tradition to finish the source material in anime form)</br>  <br>Stop, I beg of you</br>  <br>Let's be honest for a second, as much "muh genuine" 8man is, if ANY girl in the series confessed to him he'd probably accept.</br>  <br>If Iroha started trying the 8bowl would already be over.</br>  <br><br>Haruki was a shit, 8man wouldn't betray Yui like that.</br></br>  <br>NO. This has gone too far.</br>  <br>Please stop, I can't take it anymore.</br>  「あ、でも、ヒッキーはちよっとお姉さん、くらいのほうが相性いいよ、うん<wbr>ー……たぶん。絶対」<br><br>ぐっと握った拳には妙にカがこもっているようだった。でもね、そういうこだ<wbr>わりあんまりないんです、わたくし。<br><br>Yui just got rejected, hard.</br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr>  <br>Same mental gymnastics as "I'm selfish because I want to understand other people and don't care if they understand me"<br><br>Yui is more similar to 8man than she gets credit for.</br></br></br>  <br> gives her a locket <br>Fuck off Komi</br></br>   For example, the mood on Valentine’s Day? <br> I suppose I could understand in that case. Occasionally, I’d learn from the masses, take in the mood, and play it off. Then, I’d just brush it all off with a simple “it’s what everyone’s doing.” Doing that made you want to have expectations, be spoiled, lose yourself, and wait. <br> But I don’t think that’s something you should do. <br> It’d be insincere if all you did was wait. Regardless of the answer and conclusion awaiting you at the end of the tunnel, you should make sure to take that step forward without deception and incredulity and leave the regrets for afterwards. <br><br><br>What does he mean by "It’d be insincere if all you did was wait." ?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, no rejections until the last volume</br>  <br>So Iroha is the true "first girl"?</br>  <br><br>This won't happen because Iroha was specifically written to avoid main heroine tropes.</br></br>  <br>Technically ha could be hayama, so we have a reverse nisekoi on our hands.</br>  <br>That was painful to read, poor Yui.</br>  In LN volume 11 <br>When 8man reject Yui proposal because he think its wrong for Yui to decide Yukino's future by her method. While he did genuine speech. He said in his monologue that He doesn't want to lie to someone important to him.<br><br>I wonder who someone important to him.<br>Is it Yui (he decline her proposal because he think is wrong and tell her about it)? Is it Yukino (He tell her to solve her problem by herself because she should choose her future by her own)? or Is it both girls?<br><br>What do you guys think about it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Translate it, weebs.</br>  Irohafags have the best Oregairu OC.  <br>The pleasure of being cummed inside isn't genuine.</br>  <br>They're both important to him you dense motherfucker.</br>  <br>yeah I know, just kidding. There is no way that would be true since their family aren't that close from the start.</br>  <br>Well, fuck.</br>  <br>Secondary here.<br>I remember comentaries about the LN about 8man giving the YY girls two presents, one blue for Yui and another pink for Yukino.<br>It seems it was skipped in the anime, so I'd like to ask when it happened in the LN.</br></br></br>  <br>So is genuine just "What Hachiman thinks is right?"</br>  <br>6.5</br>  <br>that one was fairly simple<br><br>Yui force her ideal to 8man "you must be more comfortable with onee-san type, right right Hikki" but he just deny that  in his head.  Basically it means Yui is not his type.</br></br></br>  <br>6.5, I think the bonus track</br>   ctrl+f "saki" <br> no results <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>We have the best girl, the best part of the fanbase, the best autistic posters and the best taste.<br>Sorry.</br></br>  「なんだよ..」<br>"I'm...."<br>「あ、いえ……ちよっと意外だったので」<br>"Oh, no. Sunday was gone and was surprising because "<br><br>way off the point, bravo bing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What is unreliable narrator? <br>He was avoided to think Yui as his type for some reason.<br><br>Just Like this scene.<br><br> Seemingly not fond of jumping into the heart of the matter, Haruno-san’s cheeks swelled indignantly and she gave me a squint. “We’re finally on a date, don’t be such a party-pooper. Your attitude’s soooo different from the time with Gahama-chan.” <br><br> “Da… No, that’s not what it was, at all, and neither is this.” I answered while in a fluster. <br><br> Haruno-san smiled with a composed appearance and pointed at herself. “Hikigaya-kun, are you not into beautiful onee-sans like me?” <br><br> “I don’t believe a thing can be done if you end up hating beauties who can say things like that about themselves.” I answered. <br><br> After Haruno-san nodded, she gave me an upward glance and poked back. “But you hate girls who pretend as if they’re not a lot more, right?” <br><br> “…True.” <br><br> Crap, she got me… Though truthfully, I felt those kinds of girls really were a little out there for me. <br><br> Well, if I were to be honest about it… I definitely preferred pretty onee-sans a lot more! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could be worse. She could be Totsuka.</br>  <br>I'm watashi wa gomenasai</br>  <br>B-but yui is a retarded type.</br>  <br>Maybe of he did a hard denial of being a momcon. I doubt anyone here or in the story would peg her as an onee-san type</br>  <br> わたくし </br>  <br>well the scene isn't that serious to be lying about. And you have to admit that 8man prefer younger girls, right?  Like Rumi for example. </br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br>Try with<br><br>あ、いいえ......ちょっと意外だったので</br></br></br>  <br><br>I haven't gone far enough anon.<br><br> Girl he was hanging out with was Ko-chan and also gave her a locket. <br> Ko-chan is blonde. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's really not a very good comparison though, because 8man appreciates good looks and can't stand dishonesty.<br><br>To begin with, pretty onee-san isn't a personality type.</br></br></br>  Why is it that translating Japanese is always described like deciphering ancient dialects of lost languages?  Iroha/Taiga<br>  + were in love with another guy at first <br>  + both got rejected <br>  + fell in love with their respective MCs afterwards <br>  + were inseperable from the MC, either by going after him all the time or just random occasions <br>  + have ridiculous chemistry with the MC <br>  - Iroha is not a tsundere, thankfully <br>  - Iroha is not violent, thankfully again <br>  - Iroha is not short and has breasts, yet another good thing for Iroha <br><br>Iroha/Chihiro<br>  + not first girls <br>  + late proper introductions <br>  + normalfags <br>  + fell in love with the MC <br>  + were competing against 10/10 girls filled with tropes <br>  + flags after flags after flags <br><br>  8man describes Iroha's lips the same fucking way that Watari described his kouhai's lips on that tweet. <br><br>Really, Am I the only one that sees this shit as obvious?<br>This is going to be another Chihiro ending, and only then people will call it obvious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man's reaction aside, I have to wonder how the fuck Yui even came to the conclusion that 8man likes onee-san when it's Komachi he fawns over more than anyone else.</br>  <br>Well he doesnt say his type anyways. Recall his convo with Haruno at fireworks <br><br> “So how about you, Hikigaya-kun? Do you like Yukino-chan?” <br> “I’ve been taught by my mom to not discern between my likes and dislikes.” I answered and Haruno-san made an amiable laugh. </br></br></br></br>  <br>because he was eye-fucking her mom, Haruno, and Shizukawaii</br>  <br>Well the Taiga one can be applied to Yukinoshita for a majority of them (should be obvious why)</br>  <br>But Watari deconstructs the typical RomCom, which would mean that Iroha can't win.</br>  <br> No doujin starring all three raping 'Hikki' </br>  <br>well mostly because the OCR software wasn't that good so the source text has many fault. And bing is kind of inexperience, too (google translate has many people contributed to improve the translation).</br>  <br> implying he hasn't done that already with Yukino </br>  <br> that gif <br>Iroha really is Legal Komachi.<br><br><br>Taiga only has rich girl, family drama, and X-dere elements.<br><br>Pretty much not a single one of which were relevant to Taiga's actual victory, and are generally regarded as the less-favored parts of her character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> typical RomCom <br><br>if the two above was typical romcom then none of them would be that famous.<br><br>Compare to thousands of them when the first girls/rick girls/genki girls won then those series were like few grain of sand in the beach.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My point is 8man doesn't have clear girl preference if you just seeing it from his monologue because he is unreliable narrator. <br><br>But there is something suspicious from his monologue when he keep avoiding to think about Yui too much despite he himself being possessive toward her unconciously or conciously.</br></br></br>  <br> Iroha/Chihiro <br>You forgot these <br>  + Like another guy at first but get rejected <br>  + MC helps them to go for another boy despite them lusting for the MC </br></br></br></br>  <br>You're really grasping if you think Iroha's supposed to be less RomCom-typical than Yukino or Yui.<br><br>Or are you arguing in favor of Saki/Shizuka end?</br></br></br>  <br>He likes Yui<br><br>But he also has internal monologues about Yukinoshita as well that portray similar thoughts (usually involving her and Hayama though)</br></br></br>  <br> that gif <br>How cute.</br></br>  <br>Whatever girl wins in the end, everyone will be saying that the signs were obvious.</br>  <br>You've only realized that just now? 8man's never used the dictionary definition for his "genuine thing". He doesn't even have a solid idea of what it is.</br>  <br>They'll also call it a hack ending for having the main character of a semi-serious story building serious relationships with two other girls only to go "lolnope, third girl got more romcom flags"</br>  <br>He's an unreliable narrator, but that doesn't mean his narrative is worthless. I'm not going to try to claim a single paraphrased, out-of-context line of moon is going to be sufficient to draw any conclusions, but his attitude toward Komachi and Iroha stands out far more in the narrative than his occasional ogling of Haruno's breasts.</br>  <br>Exactly. It boggles my mind how people aren't seeing that Watari is raising flags for every ending conceivable so that the readers believe anything can happen.</br>  <br> 8man imitates Komachi on a regular basis <br> starts imitating Iroha when he's just getting to know her <br> Iroha imitates him in the latest volume <br><br>It's infectious.</br></br></br></br></br>   “Alright, I’ll take some shots.” I called out to Isshiki. She answered by resting her cheeks in her hands and her elbows on the desk. <br> Her moist eyes and her long eyelashes in her inviting upwards expression was impressive and despite the innocence in her somewhat elated smile, her cherry (it should be glossy) lips glazed softly. <br><br>How did he manage to contain the boner?<br><br> “…I suppose,” I answered briefly, and I positioned the camera again. Now then, let’s think. Will these photos be the memories of what’s ordinary, or the memories of what’s extraordinary? I thought as I pressed the shutter. <br><br>What do you guys think? Memories of what's ordinary or extraordinary?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is going to be another Chihiro ending, and only then people will call it obvious. <br><br>Why everyone is surprised with Chihiro end? There was no main girls and development like Yukino and Yui in this manga.</br></br></br>  webdeb anon here, anyone consider donating for me to register one of the following domain:<br> iroha.su 30$ <br> irohasu.co 8.88$ (the figure seems nice) <br><br><br>irohasu.space<br>irohasu.link<br>irohasu.us<br>is pretty cheap I can actually afford that on my own.<br><br>Or more neutral names like transladder or transtep or some other shit, what do you think about it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Elucia and Haqua</br>  <br>Try .moe</br>  <br>Are you guys planning to kill Watari or something?</br>  <br>huh?</br>  <br>Yeah but were they main romantic love interest.

Elsie end with random buddy cop adventures, or a romantic end with Haqua, Chihiro, or Ayumi. Not sure why it was a shocker to people.</br>  <br>Oh shit, he's onto us. Abandon ship.</br>  <br>But Iroha is moe as fuck</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>Are you saying TWGOK and Toradora! aren't romcoms?<br><br><br> Yukino <br>She seems more like a k-drama heroine than a romcom heroine, to be honest.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hey there. Since I'm scanning some Nishioka at the moment, I'll dump this 1-volume story by them. It's an absurdist story about a man facing a crisis, and the adventure that ensues.<br><br> A man sets out on a journey to go away from his repetitive and boring life. He finds unbelievable things, terrible things. </br></br>    The illustrator also contributed to the monogatari series.

Seriously?<br><br>Pathetic.<br><br>I tear off my limbs, constructed from the essence of my own prayers, hopes, wishes, and curses, and warp them into the imaginary shapes fitting for true demons, whereupon they devour the defenseless duo.

Guess I should get my wallet out because it looks like I found it.</br>  <br>Maybe it's because of how adorable Rider is.</br>  So it's pretty much agreed that Hibike! Euphonium is the best anime of the season, right?  Not much competition tbh<br><br><br>not counting sequels</br></br></br>  Second for Dream Solister and Tutti being underrated songs and don't deserve the hate that they're getting here.    <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br>Pleiades was better by a hair.</br></br>  <br>Not even close. Good music, but the show itself is a huge disappointment.  Plus where are the fucking feet? <br>AOTS would be shokugeki or kinmosa.</br></br>  <br>Well it's up there along with Pleiades and kekkai</br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br>Where's SC?<br><br>Also, that's a shit sample size.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck no.</br>  <br>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/1HCbKUsDhFWwaW2SZliA11NpJvsNWSm<wbr>k13C4cYl4mEVw/edit?pli=1#gid=0</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Yahari was complete garbage.<br>Fair enough if you like the source material, but anime adaptation itself was in the rank of fucking Denpa Kyoushi.<br>You people disgust me.</br></br></br>  <br>Not even close.</br>  <br>It definitely is NOT the best of the season.</br>  pleiades was aots  <br>this</br>  <br><br>yeah!</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>This anime made me so happy.<br>I love everything about it.</br></br>  <br>fuck you</br>  Feet  <br>Now that the anime is almost over, can we appreciate how perfect this promo image is?</br>  <br>It had the potential but KyoAni ended up adding random changes to source material, without fully committing to them making the end result inconsistent and without clear focus. It's still a decent show but could have been much more.<br> AOTS is Tesagure </br></br>  muh, the whole season was mediocre, it shines because most of the rest was garbage.  <br>I just realized I posted that in the wrong thread but it happened to still be relevant.<br><br>But yeah, the promo pic is literally the only reason I decided to pick it up.<br><br>I haven't actually watched the rest of it past episode 5 but is it completely done or are they going to continue it? I know the manga or LN is still going on but I don't know how the far the anime got into it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Novel has four volumes.<br>First three are the main story, fourth is a collection of short stories.<br>Anime adaptation only covers the first volume.<br><br>Manga is still ongoing, but the novel is over.</br></br></br></br></br>  Pleiades or Show by rock.  <br>It depends on the ending, if nothing hetero happens, it is.</br>  Yes  SnS is great too, but yeah. Tuti a best  Houkago no Pleiades is AOTS<br>Hibike is shit</br>  <br><br>But hetero have already happened</br></br>  Maybe if you only watch generic moeshit  <br>Yes.</br>  Shokugeki IMO but Hibike is still top tier.  <br>It's average.</br>  <br>1. Hibike<br>2. Kinimosa<br>3. SnK</br></br></br>  <br>gotten kind of shitty towards the end</br>  <br>It looks nice but the high school band drama is tedious</br>  <br>I don't understand. How is euphonium both second on the best anime list and second on the biggest disappointment list? Were people expecting it to be a huge hit?</br>   (OP)<br> CGDCT Kyoanus boring shit <br> Ever AOTS <br>even Gunslinger Stratos is better than that crap, moeshitter<br>True AOTS is anything from this list<br>Kekkai Sensen<br>Ninja Slayer<br>Punchline<br>UBW <br>Arslan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People are extremely disappointed that it isn't yuri, but still acknowledging it's a solid 9/10 in spite of that. Easily AOTS.</br>  <br>Wow, what shit taste<br>Boring crap deserves 3/10 at most for missing the point of entertainment<br>Visuals alone don't do shit</br></br></br>  <br>What if good-looking visuals entertain me?</br>  <br> people look for different things in entertainment </br>  <br> Ninja Slayer <br>Finally some taste.<br>http://a.uguu.se/drpirk.webm</br></br></br>  Pleiades was a far better moe-shit anime. Kekkai was the AoTS  <br>Then, you have Kekkai Sensen and UBW which are much better than this shit because they both have more to offer than visuals<br><br>The we can't agree that shitphonium is AOTS like OP suggested<br>Because I certainly don't agree</br></br></br></br>   everyone suddenly likes Pleiades <br>What happened? I thought everyone dropped this boring shit after 1 episode</br>  <br>It got really good after episode 3.</br>  <br>Space happened</br>   <br>Not telling you to agree since this AOTS nonsense is just what the majority likes anyways.</br>   <br> dropped AOTS </br>  It's shit, so nope.  <br> CGDCT Kyoanus boring shit <br>Are you retarded? It's not CGDCT because these shows usually don't have males as possible romantic interests, that would scare otaku<br> even Gunslinger Stratos is better than that crap, moeshitter <br>Nevermind, you are.</br></br></br></br>  Nah, it got blown the fuck out by MANIME. BOOYAH.  <br>So? How does your post change the fact that shitphonium is unappealing and boring as fuck? <br>Face the truth, moeshitter. Your show is shit</br></br>  <br> How does your post change the fact that shitphonium is unappealing and boring as fuck? <br>It's neither unappealing nor boring?</br></br>  <br><br>That's extremely fucking sad if not altogether unsurprising that that's what people are going with given the standards and stagnant interests of anime fans nowadays.</br></br>  <br>It is. Stop deluding yourself</br>  <br> Anyone who likes something different than me is deluded! <br>Beautiful argumentation. I consider myself well and truly bested.</br></br>  <br>I accept your concession.</br>  <br> hibikek <br> anything other than a failed k-on attempt with more drama and yurishit <br><br>Mein sides</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is this K-on when it has male characters?</br>  <br>it's utter shit. you only watch it for the cute girls.</br>  <br>More like complete garbage.</br>  <br>Nope.

From the dialogue it sounds like he shot both but that seems strange.</br></br></br>  <br>Ryu is going to be on Smash Bros!? Neat, didn't knew.</br>  <br>They each did one. Note the numbers.<br><br>Touma probably did the smiley face.</br></br></br>  <br>Does Kubo even read what he writes?</br>  <br>Rank 2 was referring to his squad. In Sniping he is rank 1 and now it says overall he is rank 4 solo meaning we now know:<br>Solo Overall:<br>1. Tachikawa<br>2. Ninomiya<br>3. Kazama<br>4. Touma</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Love rival regarding Chika</br></br>  <br>Chika is imoutozoned and you can't convince me otherwise.<br><br><br>Ah.<br><br>And I suppose from this chapter we can assume he's like some kind of rank 0 because he's incredibly good and simply doesn't play by the rules.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Although I would prefer Kitora I feel like Ashihara is pushing OsamuxChika more.</br></br>  <br> And I suppose from this chapter we can assume he's like some kind of rank 0 because he's incredibly good and simply doesn't play by the rules. <br>No Touma is ranked first in terms of snipers. Narasaka for all his high scores only ranks second</br></br>  <br>I'm so confused by all these ranks. I'll get it eventually.<br><br><br>I don't know, it could go either way to be honest.<br><br>Both characters are considered heroines, Kitora was introduced first but Chika is part of the core trio, Kitora has a steady, developing relationship with Osamu, Chika has an old relationship that seems to fluctuate between sibling/friendship and teased romance, Ashihara likes Kitora a lot but doesn't particularly like Chika.<br><br>I'd go with sticking Yuuma and Chika together if I were him.<br><br>On that note, I've taken interest in another ship: Konami/Hyuse. Blame pixiv users. I'll dump some comics I found. They're cute.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br> Everytime that Satoken is mentioned, the author puts a pic of him, as if we weren't supposed to remember him <br>Goddamnit</br></br>    <br> I'm so confused by all these ranks. I'll get it eventually. <br>From what I've gathered it goes:<br><br> Solo Attackers <br>1. Tachikawa<br>2. Kazama<br>3. ?????<br>4. Murakami<br><br> Solo Shooters <br>1. Ninomiya<br><br> Solo Snipers <br>1. Touma<br>2. Narasaka<br><br> Solo Overall <br>1. Tachikawa<br>2. Ninomiya<br>3. Kazama<br>4. Touma</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Ashihara is pushing OsamuxChika more. <br><br>Tbh he just blushed the first two times Yuuma asked him about it then afterwards he just seem confused as to why people would assume that about them</br></br></br>  <br>There's basically three ranks: Team, Solo Overall, and Solo Position/Class.</br>    <br> I've taken interest in another ship: Konami/Hyuse. Blame pixiv users. <br>They look pretty good together. I wonder if one character picking on another one is the trigger for this.</br></br>  <br>Poor guy, that´s said I think that his double gunned sniping is pretty cool</br>  <br> I think that his double gunned sniping is pretty cool <br>Don't encourage him.</br></br>  <br>I wonder how All-rounders are ranked</br>  <br> I wonder if one character picking on another one is the trigger for this. <br>That might be right. After seeing Konami bully Osamu every time he ranks high in a poll, I thought it was cute.</br></br>  <br>So Narasaka has his own loli, better than Chika.</br>    <br>Whatshisface, the sniper from the first major rank battle they did, suggested that all-rounders basically don't happen as it is right now. Even he is focusing on being a sniper, even though he's also a good attacker. He wants to make all-rounder an actual thing, but as it stands it isn't. I think he might be the only one, really. Maybe Reiji roo, but Reiji is a Tamakoma and thus a weirdo.</br>      <br> Izuho needs a mentor  <br> All-girl Nasu squad is losing their sniper  <br><br>Is it really going to happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br> no TL <br>wow thanks for nothing</br></br>  CUTE<br><br>SHIT<br><br>that's that</br></br></br></br>  Silly wing juxtaposed with silly wing hair  <br>I am only a young adult four years' out of practice with moon, I can't properly even read most of this stuff. I really should start re-learning.<br><br>Context is pretty easy for most of them, though.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be great, but I like the actual sniper of Nasu team, it´s a pity that she must leave</br>  <br>I didn't know I wanted this. More.</br>   Yuma has a ton of attacker friends  <br> This chapter shows Chika starting to interact with other snipers  <br> Osamu has no friends </br></br>  <br>Kikuchihara is friends with him</br>  <br>Sorry, that's the only one I have with Konami and Hyuse.<br>Here's some Torimaru and Konami instead.<br>1/3</br></br></br>  <br>Kikuchihara is tsundere for him.</br>  <br>2/3</br>  <br>3/3</br>  <br><br><br>You can never go wrong with Konami bullying.</br></br></br>  <br>Kitora is tsundere with him, Arashima respect him and Kikuchihara is just bad at making friends (too blunt for his own sake)</br>  <br>i just wont to bully her</br>  <br><br>Don't bully, Konami is for playful teasing only.<br>Mira on the other hand, I'd rub her horns till she starts crying.</br></br></br>  After Arashiyama´s explanation I wonder why so much people complain about Osamu dont getting points, I talk about Kikuchihara and Ninomiya. Osamu is weak, but he was doing a good job as a strategist/shooter even with his limitations, one could think that at least Ninomiya wanted to put him in the wrong way  <br>He aims to go to the neighbor world and he's unable to defend himself/stand up against even his own peers. Think of it that way.<br><br>He does alright but as it stands he may as well just be an operator. If anything goes awry while he's on an away mission he can't bail out, he'll simply die. This is why he needs to learn how to score points on his own.<br><br>Arashiyama mostly said what he said in consideration to the fact that Osamu is a beginner. As a novice shooter, he's pretty alright, but...he's a novice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop it Arashiyama, don't snatch Osamu away from Kitora!</br>  Despair awaits you at   /ai/ idle activities    ded    The guide: http://pastebin.com/iDebHQu6  Sleepy madoka is best madoka      How can we make /ai/ alive again?  <br>subs</br>  <br>how can we make subs happen again?</br>  <br>Sleepy idols are the idlest.</br>  <br>at this point winning the holy grail or killing an 100 yo fabulous vampire in Egypt</br>  Yuu a qt  <br>By subbing.</br>  <br>Looking at this again, I think this is depressed Akari rather than sleepy Akari.</br>  <br>PR</br>  <br>But anon I want to sleep and idle...</br>  <br>Me too dude.</br>  <br><br>You can't.
