[ School Noire is best Noire.  Close      This is Nepgear.    being best of shit   OK.      Correct. Would you like a cookie?    Do you have a best girl instead? I'd rather have something more meaningful than a cookie.    Who then, is best girl, anon? There are many girls that are not bad, but only one can be best.     Vert       Apron Noire is fine too      Iris is best.      I want her to step and spit on me.     -Best- Nep, Vert, Puru, Rei/CPU, PH, YH  -pretty good- Noire, Blanc, Uni, pko, Rom, Uni (cpumode), IH  -ok- BH, Ram (cpumode), nepgear, nepgear (cpumode)  -meh- Ram, WH, GH, Rom (cpumode)              Best   Sweating, trembling, and moaning Noire while Nep watches is best Noire.     /v/   You need to live with the fact that this is legit animu.      It's great when she shows affection     This is God Eater-chan  Purpuru Heartu  So, Neptune knows, and is just trolling her, right? (See also Vert and Chika.)   And her thighs.     whatsherface is joining Blancs game.    There were no pantyshots in the anime, right. I was hoping for some of Ge-Ge's pink-white shimapan.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090906  We will never see the new goddess in an official manga.  Wouldn't now be a good time to fire up an anime sequel, though?      Which Nep has the best one?   She is a pure girl, she doesn't wear such things.    Nope, the only thing close to it was the beach episode when she got fooled of not wearing any swimsuit.   Shh... Ram and Rom are sleeping  Who Purubutt here?   MAGES has the sluttiest navel.    But she has no friends?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090906   god eater   no freedom wars neps      i fucking with we got another season, but im not sure there enough material seeing as how they slapped 3 games in 12 episodes.     I'd do some raunchy, demeaning shit to Noire  and I wouldn't call her the next day.    That's not very nice.     That a prefect butt for spank     It's part of my plan. By the third day, she'll come crawling back for more. After that, she's mine.    I'd rather just lick her. Much more satisfying for both parties.   I want to confess to Blanc.   I'm going to lick her for a whole night to seal the deal. Either that or just rub her for a few hours.    I believe in you anon Try to not die     Blanc a shit  flat   gets angry easily   comes with excess baggage (twin bratty sisters)        I want Blanc to sit on my lap and read all day while I play games.   not liking flat chested girls  Literally a faggot.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127096608  fuck off Garrett   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127097009  PC-only fags*   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127097009   They're called secondaries anon.

Anyway post some nep.      What exactly does "secondary" mean here? Haven't watched the annie mays either.    tfw Black Heart is still raping me      I want PH to dominate me while taking ques from Iris.   I love Neps   Nep loves me.  I wish ;_;    Needs more purple in here.  Lastation neps are best neps  What's this face trying to convey?   Sexual pleasure    Happiness.     you wouldn't a Vita   Of being  neped  inside?         All these uni, my Uniggas.       Easily the most nepable.    time to recharge your batteries, Uni~   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127100077  This adorable little monster.   Wait, Sega had an American founder. Does this make Neptune and the other Planetune girls half-breeds?  I want to sexually fuck noire   how does one non-sexually fuck Noire?    I want to give Noire a copy of PH and my honeymoon night.    I like bullying Noire as much as the next anon, but pic related makes me sad.   Why theres no CPU that representing PC yet ?   We don't need the CPUs to get BTFO because PC &gt; console.    Too over powered. The girls would need some plot armor since she would be a major threat to all the goddess.     [soiler] That girl is such a bitch, fuck Noire [/spoiler]        3DS port when? Vert imoutos when? X-BOX handheld when?     I bet she has smooth thighs. I want to bury my face in them.   Nepgear is the  purest      You can have your purity. I want a lustful NepNep.    Please don't sexualize the Neps    they sexualize themselves.    If I don't sexualize her in some way, how are we supposed to have kids?        As with PC-Tan, how can you really have one single face to represent all of PCdom? Moreover, Gameindustri is isolated like how Japan is to the whole world around it. God forbid Nepnep go abroad instead of being just a mere slider.  A CPU that may represent PCs would be at a level beyond the existing Neps, and dominate over a whole empire outside of gameindustri. She'd be like some conceptual god with several platform that operate on the hardware along with a huge number of makers. She'd be like the Roman empire who is fighting all the barbaric consoles and the heathen mobile platforms.  Gameindustri would just be this one front out of the whole console war, and that's not factoring in all the alt dimensions outside of hyperdimension at that.           If you treat console in the sense of platform, then Steam-chan would be there, along with Origin, Uplay, GOG and studio-specific platforms such as Battle.net. PC is Balkanized and it's about as Roman as the (un)holy Roman empire.   Come to think of it, platform cohesion of iOS and Android far exceeds the segmented PC through more draconian default web store enforcement (at least those two can somewhat trace to UNIX and are distant relative of the inconsequential non-gaming platform o' Linux)       And when Linux-tan gets drunk she tries to play games, but sometimes weird shit happens to her somehow.   Being Vert is suffering   Kinect is not a younger sister. It's just accessory.  Although Vert would have a rather distant cousin in Surface line tablets that aren't marketed as gaming consoles.     Isn't she the only one to actually remove her garments in that one episode?   Who's the best mascot character and why is it Cave?     Explain her appeal. Honest question.    She's beautiful. Pretty chill too. Arguably one of the more normal characters. Sometimes when everyone else seems to be crazy normal is good. Though she is a bit socially awkward which can also be cute.   Noire is nowhere near my favorite but I want to rescue her from a life of loneliness when she's at her absolute most depressed and then nuture her and fall in love.  Also: She's kinda a bitch. I noticed she's the only CPU who acts like a bitch to her sister. Noire constantly acts passive aggressive towards Uni tears her down, belittles her, and makes backhanded compliments all the time.     Peashy is PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16.)    iF a best though.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127104671  Cave is pretty great.  would /a/ have gone to Neptune's concert?       I would go, rain, snow or shine. Because I love Neptune.    Gee, I wonder who could be behind this post.    Best Nep   If we're talking about pc, then how would Valve look like as a maker? kind of fair game now that you can be a secondary through buying in at steam sale and all.   fuck off, Noire is shit and she clearly abandoned Nep in that picture. Only dedicated anons like me and the one you're responding too are dedicated enough to go no matter what.    THANK YOU PURPLE HEART.    *perfect heart     implying the PC wasn't the original True Goddess       Ran-ran a best.    What is she / it? Not bullying, just curious.    I want Compa to give me a paizuri while Noire sucks me off.     thats not what secondary means     (´・ω・｀)   She represents the emoticon.            where is nude mod   New hotness        I want Iris Heart and Kurumi to gang bang me       Reminder that Uzume&gt;Puru   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106553  But anon we can only see up to 24fps    Google it.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106553  Even though I'm a PCfag I don't usually get bothered by FPS as much as other people. But still the console Nep games' framerate drops were pretty fucking ridiculous, even Victory had that problem.    I didn't exactly hate her, but I have to agree with that statement. A lot of the comedy surrounding Iris Heart felt stale after the first few gags. Uzume is a more interesting character in my opinion, and she had more relevance to the main story too.         okay     Has Tsunako Gone Too Far?     I'd drink that water    Not yet, we can still go further, further beyond the boundaries of lewd     Nepgear with an IF like ribbon  Huh, I didn't even know I wanted this until I saw it, weird.      not very many lewd pics of the neps by fans   she more than makes up for them herself  And bless her for it.      Except its exactly what it means...? What do you define as secondary? I've always defined it as someone who gets into a series from the most accessible point while ignoring the original material. The people who start from the originals are primary fans and the people who start from the gateway are secondaries.  Is this wrong?       loligeddon  whose subs did they use     they edited commie's     edited  Less memey?     I want her to sit on my face.     editing Commie subs  Good heavens, how horrifying.    I want to do lewd to Buran   Only Tsunako can lewd the neps. We've discussed this many times already.    Fuck that I want her to carry my babies      Beru sure is cute...      She would look cute pregnant, wouldn't she?     How do get high-tier waifus like these?   what do you mean?    Eazy peazy    I'd drink Big Nep's toilet water after she had a Mexican dish.    They all would, except for the twins. I'm pretty sure that would be looked down upon anywhere.    They made me go new 3ds xl. I bet they play MH4U.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127100077  Pure Sex   Best Nep   Oops, wrong pic    A WH is fine too.  And when I mean fine, I mean rapeable.     All neps are, doesn't mean you should do it    But I want to fill the void in her life (and womb) with a few kids.    Then do it, but not with rape    But surprise, rough sex is the best.     tfw I was at the last boss of chapter 6 in Re;birth 1   lost my save, oldest save is on chapter 4  damnit       Blanc tries to write another novel   This one is R18 hardcore chuuni edgelord stuff   You need to help her with the sex-related material   Rape playing, bondage, torture and other rough sex stuff        Don't forget public stimulation.     Walking around with Blanc walking like a dog on a leash, blindfolded, naked, on cold snowy night in Lowee   Fucking her like a horny dog because she needs bestiality scene       she's being done by her man instead of going to the concert   and loving every second of it       Is thread kill?   no      I want to deito her.      we all do   nep    NEP NEP     Puchiko is best mascot    Who the hell is that?  Orange Heart? Okey dokey     I don't like Neps anymore. They betray the Playstation.  Nowa has been corrupted. Neps are dead to me now.    Why is resta so obsessed with getting impregnated?   Ever play Agarest War, the series she's based on? It has Soul Breeding which is just making babies to pass on to the next generation.    That makes a lot of sense but I prefer thinking she just wants to be impregnated by the secretary   Where's the "Uni is my UNIverse" guy? He's obligatory for a Nep thread.   Post Uni, she must be heartbroken about the recent Vita hack.      What vita hack?    Nothing wrong with that. Hell, I'd put my seed in all of those girls, especially Noire.   Is it a backdoor hack, because I'd her backdoor.       Of course you would, masturbator     http://yifan.lu/2015/06/14/rejuvena<wbr>te-native-homebrew-for-psvita/  The hole is plugged now, though.  </wbr>    The softest.   Please, im pure and innocent   For what purpose?     so new DLC?      Forgot link. http://www.compileheart.com/neptune<wbr>/vote/result2014/</wbr>     I hope Uzume becomes a dlc/addition to most games, I would definitely buy her on every game. God eater-chan too for the delicious underboob.    Noire already has her own game and Nepu's whole character is "Im the protag". Makes senese that blanc would be the next one to get her game.  Next one will probably be vert unless people decide that they hate vert and vote for someone else.          Why did both manga have to end? I know, "We can't have nice things." But still.   I hope Gameindustri will be destroyed by meteor.  It's what they deserve for betraying Uni-chan.      But there's no PC girl so no one was betrayed!    That's actually the meanest and funniest thing I've seen today.  I'm pretty sure the studio animated this scene just because they wanted to poke fun at the director.

Upper ones too  With eggplants       h*nd-h*lding  Too lewd!      Agarest War  Tried once, dropped it as soon as the first line out of MC's mouth was 'why must we fight' while they were about to assault the enemy in a war.      Both.     Her voice is better too.    But resolving things peacefully is always best.  Power of friendship overcomes all     If we were to prat hard enough, is it possible that we could cause the neps to manifest physically out of the mass human consciousness?   It didn't work for any other religion.    play it on strong dose of psychadelics? idk    they just weren't praying hard enough and they didn't have goddesses like these.    I want to nepnep all over them     strong dose of psychadelics  No no no. I did that last year. I though I was being chased by lions and the walls wouldn't quit moving. The lion turned out to be my long haired Chihuahua. Worse experience of my life.     Nepgear stubbed her toe.   Why are the girls in this so good? There's so many great girls in this that its hard to believe.    True. Every girl is dateable.

My browser freaked the shit out on it and now it won't load.  Fucking cookies     STOP MAKING THESE SHITTY GOD DAMN THREADS  Your 'game' is the very epitome of what RPGs shouldn't be like! With a generic, empty world to 'explore', horrible horrible writing (ie. Hey look at this reference to this game, LOL!) and awful enemy design, basically just mix &amp; match creatures worse then any greek could dream up in their live time.  Not to mention the gameplay itself, truly this is the game fails the most. Boring special snowflake tier mechanics that feel lackluster and repetitive at best, there is no strategy to be found anywhere in these games.  In sum, HyperDimension is becoming an increasingly pathetic cancerous growth on the /a/ board and 4chan as a whole.  So I ask the OP of these threads; posters of these threads; lurkers of these threads, please stop participating these unwanted, loserbait threads for the good of both this website and for your own health.

Drop it in a drawthread.    to everyone who wants to make neps real: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nuH<wbr>fVn_cfHU</wbr>  [ ]  Don't fail us.     what happened to her top?    Or just lurk around or ask in a thread. I usually post in these. Catalog is your friend.   It is my enemy!   She let Vert borrow it.    Stretched out.    Don't worry about it; Blanc and I just had a little accident.      I want to stretch Blanc out, if you know what I mean.    I don't get it.    Thanks alright  What else have you done?      If Vert were to wear Noire's top, would the top even cover her nipples? It'd be a lowcut and look sexy on her.    Who me?    really? Got details?    Whoever said they'd do the Noire confession thing, yeah.    Why do you have that?    because,    What meme was that?   tohou is my favorite anime   Are you lost?    Chen please.    the "Nepnep getting violated by eggplants meme"    It's one of the common side effects I've noticed; or, you can take them just for that purpose. Otherwise I never remember my dreams. It's kind of weird, because in those type of dreams things from my actual environment are 3d, but made up things and locations are 2d     it's kinda expensive are there any cheaper brands of the same thing?    there's always cheaper    I don't take it for the dreaming. But I'm sure some hippies out there have made a lucid dreaming herbal mix    Hippies shouldn't be trusted.    I know, I wasn't thinking about just the dreaming, the supplement sounds useful all around. Do you think it's worth it?      I don't know how much of it is snake oil, but I think it does something. Most all of the cognitive enhancement supplements run about the same price, which isn't cheap. I'd go for a B-complex vitamin first, and see how much energy that gives you—because those work.     This does nothing to me. Shallow and empty, superficial yelling won't make me do the best thing I could do with my life.  Yeah, sure, don't give up, do it. After the starting enthusiasm dies down, you will just stop anyway. Only the chosen few can cross this invisible border, and amount to something in their life. Even after arriving to Gamindustri all you will be is a hobo, without money, home or any kind of identification papers. Even if you see one of favorite Neps, it will happen through TV or from the 49th line in a live idol event.  Give up now, so you won't face failure. Don't start it, so you won't have to face regrets of failed tries. Have no expectations and nothing will betray you. Make no efforts, so you can tell yourself you could do better than others.  This is the one and only path to Gamindustri. Your resolve must be made, when Nepgear comes to take you.          What?   NEPU   Nepu Nepu Nepu    Oh alright that ain't bad, just dirty.

That's cool, I guess more Kitora for us    Who dis?  Is Chika finally gonna get her own rival?      Who wouldn't want more of her?  I think right now Arashiyama is teaching osamu the different ways a shooter/gunner can attack and work with it's team  Right now yuma is the driving factor of his strategies and right now what he wants to do is be able to work on the same playing field as him and not just survive but help  This is one of he reason why I love Osamu as a character because his struggle for strength is understandable and doesn't make him annoying unlike all of the times it has been done before.    Looks like it, I am guessing he is going to be a more "Shoot to kill' type person compared to Chika more softer personallity             I like that Izuho still had the cat on her head. And that it moved to Isami's head.     I think he will also get some lessons from Izumi. Karasuma acted like he wanted him to see both.   Who was the sniper that made the drawings? Narasaka? He somehow looks different.   He isn't wearing his headphones   Is this less boring now?   Yes    It is a slow boil that I got through only because I am a huge Sci-fy fag    Yes he is, they are on his neck just the scans are so shitty that it is hard to see    We still only normally see him when he has them on his ears. It is probably why he looks different.   Summary from p-kun, posted on MAL:  Not an info heavy chapter.  HQ: - Osamu is sent to see Arashiyama and Izumi. Chika has joint sniper practice. Yuuma wants to rank battle.  Arashiyama Team War Room: - The team is busy because the number of applications increase since Mikumo/Kido leaked the rescue plan. Intake is not once in 4 months, but becomes once a month now. Satori is in the joint practice. - Arashiyama questions Osamu's lust for solo points. He says that the point of shooter/gunner position is not for taking points solo. Their weapons are underpowered to begin with, especially because shields are getting better. Even during the time when shield was bad, shooters/gunners are pretty much dead meat against good attackers like Kou or Yuuma. - The advantages of shooters/gunners are distance attacks and ability to support allies. So, use it to to control situation or lure enemies to be finished by allies. Izumi is really good at the later. - Osamu has shown some level of this. Arashiyama also says that there's no point learning small tricks that may change the good habit that Osamu has built. - Osamu is upset that Karasuma's mindset was right - So Arashiyama agrees to train him (probably about teamwork and such)  Sniper training room: - Izuho is looking for a mentor - A boy (Ema Yuzuru) cleans up booths for them to use, removing Touma's belongings. - Akane comes and fawns at Izuho's cat, which jumps on Touma's pompadour - Training ends, Chika is rank 24, Izuho 47, Narasaka (Akane's mentor) ranks 1 as always. He hits dead center in every shot. Touma draws a smiley with his shots (which is why Narasaka is always no. 1 in joint practice), Yuzuru draws a star. - Narasaka says that points do not indicate sniper ranks, as there are unorthodox snipers like Yuzuru and Touma. Yuzuru is introduced as B-2 Kageura team sniper.                      The cat has great taste in husbandos   Oh that makes more sense! sorry I didn't realize that is what you meant    I wonder what Narasaka means when he says that Touma and Yuzuru are unorthodox    Fuck Osamu just keeps getting told that he is an idiot   I wonder if he might go to hyuse for some help or something?      So Arashiyama believes that gunners/shooters are better for support than actually raking up points? I'm guessing that obviously Izumi and Ninomiya have the opposite mindset.    They probably shine better on the field than in practice.     I think it means something like they have the ability to use their precision in an unusual way  So instead of hitting a target one way they are able to do something else      I'm not sure exactly what's going on here without translations, but I assume someone is going to eat their hat.   How does one acquire a headcat?      It's more that Osamu feels pressured to be more than support on the battlefield. Arashiyama wants to teach him to be a better support shooter.    It means that they are only spending time drawing on shooting practice, or that are unconvencional sniper ala Chika?   I thought something like that   Real life cats are assholes           Fuck Osamu just keeps getting told that he is an idiot  He probably gonna fuck up in the coming rank battle but not before he feels that the advice given before to him are wrong. Im gonna enjoy his delicious tears.     No, I think this is more of a case of that they are better snipers when it matters. Sort of like the scene in American Sniper where he could shoot a snake better than a target board at the same distance away.     God I love the way that osamu's character is written, he is weak yet doesn't come off as useless, his desire and struggle to become stronger is something that is relocatable     I completely agree with you  I said this before but what I think is gonna happen is that yuma/chika are gonna get a bunch of points in the beginning and then osamu is gonna try to support and fuck up hard because of that fuck up yuma and chika are gonna die so the rank battle becomes a fight for survival for osamu to wait for the timer to end and get the 2 survival points      I think Osamu can pull a victory if he doubles down on support tactics. He already has a knack for it.    That looks like some final chapter looking characters   eeyore-ee   anal-qu-een   watch me pull a rabbit out of my  wait, it's not a rabbit?

Yoshino a slut.   It's NeOrigami, you fag    But phantom is young and tight    How does Tsunako keep on drawing even more lewd things?

There is a less dead thread guys   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127162596      Fuck you this one was first    Enjoy your report, this thread was first filthy secondary.   the summary will be posted here.   Summary anon?   Is this the real thread?   Check the out when this was posted.    This is the  genuine  thread,  yes     The other thread have more than 80 replies from the samefaggots talking to themselves, terrible way to start a DAL thread. They're just calling shitposters in.   Daily reminder this is the end girl.   True End    Reine = phantom Phantom = Shidou's mom  Reine true end = incest end.  WHAT?       The one true thread Reine will be are guiding light!   come in this thread   see cancerous posts already <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127165753   And this thread is better why?     Who said Reine is Shidou's mom? for now all what we know there is Phantom and Spirit N°2 who was imprisioned on DEM industries, besides remember Kurumi knows who is phantom and who is the spirit numer 2.    Incest=Wincest    Why she's always the only one sane and competent person on the entire LN? I mean Koroti is a piece of shit as commander, the team of Ratatorsk is shit too.  She deserves a better team like the DEM ones.       Kurumi knows who is phantom and who is the spirit numer 2.  Kurumi is the oracle     Because the faggot is asspained the other thread was better, he did the same last thread and his thread got deleted but the janitor deleted the thread with discussion for no reason.    I bet she's older than everyone, for some reason Kurumi is like a non-virgin 30 years old slut who keeps her looks using her own power.    Mods love loud retards.    Good thing the janitor works fast.  Oh and is the Material A = Mio thing was confirmed from the guy who did short summary spoilers or is it just speculation?      Kurumi is pure      Samefag OP from the other thread getting assblasted because he doesn't know how to use the catalog.   Fuck off retard, remember guys report and ignore these secondaries shitposters.       Mods encourage shitposting apparently.    It is confirmed but seems like Mana and Shidou used to play with her when they were kids.    Are you retarded? It doesn't matter which thred is the real one as long as there is discussion and this thread is filled with autism    Enjoy your ban shitposter.   Miku is worst girl    non-virgin 30 years old  Im okay with this as well as Reine and Tamae      secondaries shitposters.  This secondary and cuck shit from Oregairu is really getting annoying. This only encourage more shitposting.       Reine  She's too lazy to ride dicks so she's virgin.   Tamae  She still virgin too, actually she doesn't even know what a dick is.       Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice  Reminder that Mio is Shidou's and Mana's childhood friend who was captured by DEM along with Mana  Picture related, Mio and Tohka being sluts       Just ignore that and keep discussing the series, that guy did the same last thread.     Mio    Posting RIO   What?       Slut and retard     Tohka   Slut  Fuck off      No DEM has the Second spirit it is unconfirmed if second = No 2. but a bit of food for thought Shidou and Mana's true last name does have 2 hidden in it 崇 in Takamiya (崇宮) contains ニ (2). And more fun with names. The Ma used in Mana can also be read as Shin (true).     well Mana is the true Imouto    At that point, nearly everyone has 一 in their names. But for Reine and Shidou, combining the kanji in their names straight up give you　十一 and　零.    What about Mana being spirit number 2? and that's the reason why she lost her memory?    I really want to know if Tachibana is running out of ideas, seriously, everyone knows what is going to happen with phantom and shidou. I think this LN have just 3 or 4 more volumes because at this point is turning into a trainwreck.    We might get a few more then that if he dose more volumes like this instead of new spirts     running out of ideas  Hardly, he's got one big event planned, but we don't know what it is. Or at least I don't know what going to happen. With every volume, he just keeps throwing out little bits of information that we can't do anything with. I just want to know what's really going on between Shidou, Phantom, Westcott and Woodman, but we usually only get a chapter dedicated to plot.     Meh I doubt it    do you think there will be more spirits then the ones on the tree of life like Rinne and Mayuri?

Almost everything Tachibana does that pertains to the plot is planned and isn't actually just pulled out from his ass. He just puts it out very, very slowly. I blame harem antics.     Nope.      More spirits   Why? we already have all what we want in terms of spirits and Rinne/ Mayuri are just cannon shit.  PIC RELATED       Hi all  Kaguya a Cutie     I get your point but wishful thinking    If he introduced more spirits without somehow working with the theme, then DAL would be kind of a wreck. But I doubt that'll happen.    Not likely as the color for number 2 is gray and as a spirit she would be much stronger and there is no way Wescott would let her get away. I'm more convinced it is their mother. The reason I brought up the Shin thing is there is someone with grey hair that keeps refering to Shidou as Shin and who he woke up to with them in his face after haveing a dream that was almost word for word what Phantom later told him in volume 11 with his name censored out.     Highest crown   Highest wisdom      both are semi related to the tree. Rinne is an alternate Da'at and Mayuri seems to be a reference to the lower order of angles.    all spirits are kinda ironic when matched on the tree    Miku-Redemption    Actually Origami is the most powerful spirit, even more than Kurumi or Reverse Tohka so yeah she deserves to stay at the top.    The tree isn't a ranking of power though    I think he is referring to Origami's repeated showing of lack of wisdom.     lack of wisdom.   Stop Kotori of killing Shidou   The rest of the girls just do nothing    Yeah sure anon, lack of wisdom.         all spirits are kinda ironic when matched on the tree  pretty much       Rinne, Rio, and Phantom are definitely part of the Zeroth Spirit group. Phantom might be Ain Soph who without her, the spirits might as well have never existed, hence why she calls all of them her children, even the human born ones.    That is lack of wisdom.   The logical thing to do was kill him. Logic before feelings. Always      USA was wise on throwing the atomic bomb on Hiroshima? because following your logic killing people for random reasons is wise.  Killing shidou was just a desire of part of the staff on Ratatorsk organization, instead of do some research about how stop him they create a superweapon, dat logic.      I'm not going to get into this actually but the US made the right decision. Learn some history, it was the only option to avoid more bloodshed   doesn't mean it was good      There was a second bomb too.    Showing wisdom once does not erase the other times she hasn't. And it is debatable if that really is a wise choice. We know it will work out because of the type of series DaL is, but the fact is if Phatom hadn't helped it is unlikely they could stop him from killing himself and millions of people. I like her but you have to admit wisdom is her dump stat   Where is summary anon? is he dead?  New nep looks the Yami's put togther   He said he will be late in the other thread.    Or maybe he just don't like this thread.        Said he would be late today   More of best team when?   A not very wise genius and a retard, sounds legit    Learning wisdom does, though. Phantom chooses candidates for their potential, not their current status. Origami is as wise as Tohka is worldly, which is to say not. They'll both get there, though. Eventually. Maybe.    Next volume   I love Yoshino!   You do realize they did reserch and found the only other way besides killing him was to seal all the known spirits. They've been trying that but Shidou is going critical about to melt down and he is going to do more damage then the event 30 years ago. Yes killing him based on the infomation they currently have is the wise choice.    But both can be pretty smart when the plot needs it tbh. Plus Tohka is surprisingly perceptive    Never   Is shidou going to die?  Please say yes dal should be yuri     Origami when she needs to be, Tohka is just Autistic    Yes.   And that's when Ratotoskr finds out this guy can seal spirits too.       No permanent change to Shiori    That would be a shitstorm  Specially when the bwaka falls for him       In the next game.     No, it's not, it's the short-sighted solution because it solves the problem of him exploding but does nothing to solve the long term problem of "these magical girls will not stop wrecking our shit".  In fact, it creates an additional problem, which is that the previously handled girls are now unsealed and sad/angry.  And yes, they *know* how to solve Shido's problem without letting him explode. All he has to do is kiss the girls. If they would bother to explain that he's a walking time bomb, the problem would go away because Shido isn't an edgy shit. It's because they avoided explaining the problem that the situation degraded so far.        That's actually wrong though considering through the series Tohka's made much wiser choices than Origami     Nope.     11=10+1.

Really surprised by this series. I spent each episode waiting for them to irrevocably fuck it up, but they didn't. They didn't even make a heavy handed ending, forcing some final meeting between Subaru and Minato, it was really nice.  Kudos to Gainax, shame that their times are done.      Why is everyone convinced Gainax is done for? If anything this show should gove us hope.     It's more like the fall would have put him into a coma because his potential is gone and must converge with the 'real' coma potential.

I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167352  She had something for him in her bag earlier in the ep remember?    what the end card should've been   This is the reaction Yukinon gave when Yui gave 8man her cookies. I wonder what it means.   I know that, I meant her facial expression and body language.     Fuck it, Yui and her mom were too good this episode. I'm switching ships, since Yukino is too fucking weak willed. What a disappointment.   Literally making a new thread before the other hit page 10, even before it hit the fucking bump limit  I hate newfags.   It means 8man ask Yui to continue hurting herself with her feelings and Yukino to stand and fight while he sees in the corner.    Get jealous when she knew Yui wanted 8man for years   What a fucking bitch.      She has no right to be jealous when she knew Yui liked 8man for over a year.     justmessageboardthings     Lol wow WOW you're one of those "lol I hate Yahari Oregairu!" "Forced drama" sluts. Guess what?! No one gives a shit you can shitpost about Iroha and false flag Yui all you want, doesn't change the fact that Yukino already won bitch. "I only watch sophisticated anime like Ping Pong because I'm pretentious and literally eew" - You. Who's laughing now fag. You sit at home and cry all day about how Yukino won, get over it. She won, Yui lost, Iroha was never even in the running    She was envious of Yui, because she wanted to give Hayama her cookies, but didn't have the courage.    Jealousy   I'm going to kill myself if Yukino doesn't win  Yui looking at the chocolate's in Yukino's bag.  This fucking ending.   Might as well do it now faggot. We won't miss you.    She wanted to give him something earlier too but Haruno appeared.    Holy god we have a facebookfag here.   Hey pal,  get the fuck out.        8man's going to eat Yui's bun    Momentarily jealous, thought about giving him her cookies too but decided not to because she's too much of a pussy.   Endcards:  8man starts with a coffee that he exchanges with Totsuka   The same coffee gets passed on by everyone, at the end it's up to Yukino to pass it back to 8   8 has another coffee in his hand at that time   WHAT DOZ IT MEEN?        At least now it's confirmed that cookies man is 8man all along.    Yui had a secret stash and got there first    WHAT DID HE SAY   Finally that shit is over. Fuck you and your threads. Goodbye.

But nobody understood him, just one girl at the end, being a loner like him, did understand him and has his "MAXcoffe" now.  You know which girl it is.      Does he accept the coffee or not though? I missed that part. Saw an image of Yukino throwing it away.   Why did she freeze up when Yui said she was leaving?   What isn't about Hikki emoting that makes the girls so wet?     Fuck Kaori Orimoto  gladly     naruto is ok moeshit not      Saw an image of Yukino throwing it away  That's a fanart from pixiv.     The one with her throwing it away is the only legit one, the others are fakes made by the evil Yukinofag menace    They both can have their genuine.    Fuck off abck to Reddit, nurutu fag.

You're going to have to be genuine with each other no matter how much it hurts. I have no idea what you guys are hiding btw.     "I can't do anything without you besides me"  We're already discussing it (Yukino's dependency issues) for a week straight, DAMMIT ANON!      Because that would have left her alone with 8man while giving him the choco/cookies whatever she had made for him.    epic pasta    Final secret end card is the two drinking the coffees they have with slight blushes on their face    She's also dependent on Yui. She still needs her training wheels.    Can't be right because the only thing that prevents Yukino from making the exchange is 8man having obtained another coffee.    I'd watch an anime about the stuco romance.    God damn it Yukino.      Those training wheels be dropped now.    He never lost his own wisdom, he just gave her his wisdom.    He wanted Saika's sweets above MAX COFFEE     symbolies his wisdom and he gave that to everyone   You bull is taking a shit.     SUBS WHEN?  IS THE ANON FROM THE PAST FEW WEEKS GONNA DO IT? CHANCES OF MEMESUBS COMING EARLY? GOD DAMMIT.      No capitalization   No punctuation   Thinks wanting Naruto banned is Reddit-tier   Thinks Naruto has been allowed in the past  I know you're too new here, but just so you know. /a/ had self-moderation for a long time, not to say there were no mods but if they did not want something, they just shitposted threads to oblivion. Then mods started banning people that did that because muh reddit.  It's shocking to see how acceptable, and even worse, how many people are discussion naruto here. Please leave.         I don't get it. We hear all of 8man's thoughts. He never at one point admitted to himself he's interesting in anyone except for Saika.  He needs to make up his mind. Does he want to be alone or does he want a partner?     No, no and no. Go to sleep and come back in 12 hours.    I guess by now they figured out the other one likes him. Also 8man must be a chucklefuck dense, they literally say that it resembled and that it was cute and lovable.   Dude, the anon subs were a dude copypasting Spyro's translation, so that's not happening anymore.    It is difficult Yukino is too passive for that kind of thing     man this episode was shocking, I never thought I'd see something like that Yui/Yukino scene at the end when I first started this series  I just got in, what happened?  In the book it's described with much more detail that Yui has made her move to  get the friendship end , only to confirm that Hachiman wouldn't want it  In other words, this episode has practically  denied a friendship ending  like Sensei's advice on the bridge has  erased a loner end   Now Hachiman will have to choose either Yuikno or Yui, though it's pretty much obvious at this point for whom he has romantic feeling        they literally say that it resembled  *they literally said that a fish resembled him     &gt;&gt;&gt;/q/    Indeed. Loners are not very good at showing affection. This is a new experience for her so she has no idea what to do or when to do it.    Yeah  It's obviously Yukino      Man that look, I just wanna give Yukino a hug and tell her it'll be all right.    Towards the end, Yui wasnt being a nice girl and Yukino was being frail and weak and Hachiman, knowing them both to be the opposite, had his genuine sensors overload and called them out on their bullshit    Goes to show that you would never fix her problems.   Is the coffee that gets returned to 8man still genuine?  Aren't you blushing a little too much, Yukino?   "Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I think about the date, and destinyland. Even the infirmary. It's like we're all still there. You feel it too, don't you?"    DAMMIT YUKINO     &gt;/v/     True, I will never be the 8man  ;_;     I don't think she wanted a friendship end. I think she just wanted out by forcing Mr. Genuine to do something.    mfw I'm watching the raw right now   mfw you EOPs have to wait   mfw you're already spoiled anyway   mfw you'll try watching and guess shittily based on your "knowledge gained from watching anime for years"   mfw you'll maybe get some shitty subs by some fag from here   This is what makes learning Japanese so worth it /a/-wise         Yui didn't want friendship end, she wanted to win.   I rewatched the episode. Is it me or did the girls had romance on their mind the entire time? Towards the end it seems like Yui got a new vigor to get what she wanted and Yukino stepped it up.   &gt; Irohafags wanting to see Iroha   &gt; Episode starts   &gt; Episode ends   &gt; No Iroha   &gt; Mass fag suicide        No Iroha  Glad I dropped this preemptively   So Hachiman has finally reached breaking point, right? Enough with the superficiality.   no iroha on the episode   it's a drama fest with one person trying to sink her own ship and the other almost jumping into dependencyland   BUY THE LN FAGGOT   Awesome. Guess it's time to plan those weekly Iroha threads.       8man puts expectation on Yukino again he would make a mistake again    She said that she knew Hikki would stop it. What I don't get is why Yukino looked so tortured thinking about that sort of relationship between them all.     We already knew because we had some novelfags here?    Wait for memesubs, fag.   Where was Iroha in this episode?  Irowho?   It's not "expectations". He knows for a fact that she can stand on her own two feet because she has done it before.     he expected a romcom from a sentai     I don't use subs, ever.     though it's pretty much obvious at this point for whom he has romantic feeling  I'm 8man level thick. Who?      Probably because she's now the one most terrified of what might happen if everyone is honest.    Irrelevant again     sentai  This is not the power rangers bro  sadly , you mean Seinen      implying we actually care about what the fuck you do      mfw I'm an Irohafag, can understand moon and already know what will happen because I read the novel.   I found no reason to watch this episode,  except for Yuihamama       Who?   She knows they're both in love with Hachiman, Yui was giving them a way out and keep what they have.       She is problemo girl   Whos the main girl who's really suffering?  Because honestly since Vol 6 is all been downhill for Yukino. What's Watari endgame for her?     Yukino. Or Yui. It's actually not obvious at all.   Rewatching the episode now. It's fucking boring to wait for subs. Learn japanese /a/   It's not a seinen either.          I'm an Irohafag  When you're calling suicide prevention?        It's hard..    same, and Yuckynonfag make a fuss when she failed to give 8man chocolate. Read some moonrunes and learn how she really is.   Iroha will never win the 8bowl......... Fuck my life   maaaji ukeru~   Shit episode due to no Iroha. Good it finally ended. OVA with Iroha date when?  WHO WON !??!!?!?  I think who ever won, we lost because we have to wait for the next few volumes for a conclusion which will take years, god damn  Anywho, fucking perfect anime, 10/10 AOTS       I had a feeling something was wrong with it.   You do realize Yahari is a seinen right? This isn't a romcom.       Well, it's most definitely not Sentai at least and he most likely was trying to say Seinen. I never implied this series to be either, you cockmongler    Yui tries to give them an easy and convenient way out.   Hachiman has none of that shit and says that they'll have to face waht they want.   Yukino realizes she has to step up, instead of waiting for Yui and 8man to sort things out   I'm actually pretty hyped for the final novel now. Good job Watari.       But did she even ask for help?    Nice falseflag there with the frog posting.    8man being her boyfriend and carry her problems for her. That's eventually what a husband does for his wife. But the wife has to carry the problems of the husband too.    There's a difference between asking for support, and asking for people to solve things for you. We have to wait and see which is it.     yuki 'no balls' non    I hope commie holds subs hostage for a week.   The nips call her copy-pastenon.    No, fuck you, I can't pretend to not be an EOP for so long.    Not really, at least that's what I think. I've been learning since I was 11 because I'm going to study abroad in Japan. You need to put on it some effort, but it's damn rewarding    Watari said it himself, most modern LN have shit endings and hes having none of it   He is the savior of the LN industry       Whos the main girl who's really suffering?  Yukino actually. Yui gets all good thing even her problem is just romance problem.      and hes having none of it   Yeah, we'll see about that.      Hachiman tells both of them that they'll have to face up to things together.   Incredible. He actually decided to run away from the easy answers     She's like a little kid caught up in a divorce.    Iroha had no place in this episode, she was never mixed up in the club's bullshit drama to begin with. Every time she shows up it's to either lighten up the mood of the episode or just inject romcom in it, and this episode was not going to have any of that in the first place.    Wait, what will I do with my life now that this is over? My mom says go to work but I don't want to ;-;   who is she copy pasteing?    I'm waiting for the ending, he likes Haganai so I'm worried    Hikki, she copied what he sad word for word.    It's almost like she's a side character or something.   Just watch it in Raw.  Did FEEL just cut 8man crying scene after Yui crying?     If he does a cliche "main girl" ending it would still suck. Loner end best end.    Based 8man preventing ship sinking and started trying to rehabilitate Yukino. Yukino needed pushing to pursue him before so now it looks like she might go after him. Yui's ship is upright and now she wants to pursue the 8.  Does 8man know he essentially said "Let's have a love triangle, one of you might get really hurt and it may end up destroying things between us."       not a sentai  Wait for the next volume. It's going to be the Samurai Flamenco of this generation.       he likes Haganai  People keep saying this, I don't think it's true. I'd bet it's more like he thought Haganai was shit and he could do better.     pls go, Saizefag.    TOTSUKA END CONFIRMED    That is development for you, I am proud of him.    I hope there are no more love triangle shenanigans.           Does 8man know he essentially said "Let's have a love triangle, one of you might get really hurt and it may end up destroying things between us."   Yes  it was included in his genuine speech.        Preach it.    If its done well I'de have no problem with him ending up with yukinon, hes clearly shown intrest in her all throughout the series and she clearly ahs feelings for him, I mean as a yuifag, its pretty fucking clear whose gonna win the 8bowl..  Loner end has artistic merit but as it stands it honestly wouldn't fit the hachimans character development       Does 8man know he essentially said "Let's have a love triangle, one of you might get really hurt and it may end up destroying things between us."  I think so. He took Sensei's talk to heart.   yfw Sensei was /8maninhighschool/ but fucked up and is just making sure he doesn't fuck up as well        I mean maybe it's Yui but I feel like it's Yukino. They're quite alike so they can relate to and understand eachother on a deeper level than the other characters in the show. Somewhat like 8man and Rumi. It would also be very awkward to have Yui winning and then going back to read all of 8man's Yukino sonnets.  Then again I'm biased so as always I'll doubt what I think is rational and assume there's some kind of middle ground I'm just not seeing yet.  Maybe he loves both of them as friends and hasn't really thought of romance as part of his future yet.        It didn't really say he cried in the novel version I think.    Watari best friend, Eguichi, 8man's VA    Yes because its genuine. Sensei told him he'd have to hurt someone if he cares about them so Yui/Yukino will lose and get their feelings hurt     says that his LN will have a great ending   everyone buy it   his LN has a shit end anyway   "thanks for the money"  Watari is a hack.        Eguichi is based, he has an incredible voice  I didn't know they were best friends that's funny      Did you really read it or You just heard it from spoiler like me?    Well Yuki cried here after the speech so maybe it was her who did it (and who needed one last push)    Watari is a Mahouka and HENNEKO's fan.    The anime is more hinted to a friendship end than I thought. It would be very beautiful if they can be true friends after all of this happen. Yeah I know in real life friendship between man and woman is kind of bullshit (unless they fall out of other strike zone), but we can still dream because this is a novel, right?   This episode feels completely different from the LN without 8man's monologues.   So he knows about the love triangle part?  Who will handle the rejection better, or be less hurt, Yui or Yukino?     I thought 8mans VA was a old and wise chinese old man who has seen everything in this life. Not a megane assfingering faggot which licks watari. Now I like him even more    mfw Yui win on volume 12   mfw we get another chapter with gahamama talking with 8man   mfw Yui's dad is crying because his daughter got a boyfriend      Reminder that he also voices Takeo.     best friends  They're more than that.     Well, thanks, doc.   Ohys raw for Ep13 is up. https://torrents.ohys.net/torrent/%<wbr>5BOhys-Raws%5D%20Yahari%20Ore%20no%<wbr>20Seishun%20Lovecome%20wa%20Machiga<wbr>tte%20Iru.%20Zoku%20-%2013%20END%20<wbr>%28TBS%201280x720%20x264%20AAC%29.m<wbr>p4.torrent</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>   8man's VA is like 8man. He wants to fuck his kouhai.  and I don't mean Iroha     I read it. He wasn't really sure what face he was making from what I remember    Totsuka wins Girls get Btfo but they can live with losing as long as its not to another girl.  Club is saved.   Good taste.   Blood Brothers?            Japs cannot into writing romance. It always ends either in suffering or akward status quo.   I believe he was inspired by Haganai. This doesn't mean that he has to imitate it.    Loner end has artistic merit but as it stands it honestly wouldn't fit the hachimans character development  Depends. "In the end, reject these people" kind of loner end, definitely. "Now I'm  genuinely  fine being alone but I'm open to people" kind of loner end would be fine. Like the finale of Buraiden Gai. However I'm not really sure if it would fit the overall progression and themes of the series.        What did Gahamama want to talk with Hikki-kun about?     Yahari ore no pussy is tight as expected     As it should be     We better get some fucking OVAs when 12 comes out.   He doesn't know until Haruno shoved it in his face.  Both, but Yui explicitly has longer romance span than Yukino. Who knows?      2 fucking seasons of no handholding or any of that semi-lewd stuff   I know these things are slow, but why?     Why do the people who work the hardest never achieve their goals?    "Please fuck my daughter right in the pussy"     some fucking OVAs  Hentai OVAs confirmed    So wait, Yukino gave Hikki cookies at the beginning of this episode but she also wanted to give him chocolate as well later? Yui gave him cookies too so they're even in that regard   Yui's ship is upright   Yukino is confirmed for no feelings for 8man   No important Iroha events, she isn't even in the second half  And all these pro Irohax8man Irohafags assumed I wouldn't win volume 11. Eat shit.       When are you going to get married?     I'd like to see Iroha's house.  Getting a feeling that she is a poorfag and lives in Kuroneko-style japanese house.     What is Golden Time then?    Not true anon. From the top of my mind, Yawara! had very good romance. The conclusion was disappointing and 100% satisfying at the same time, it's great.     no handholding   And there was a direct confession without interruption. Not counting a 50% looks-similar-to-WA2 scene.      What a shit taste. Both are shit shows.     Thanks for responding to my post, I didn't even realize I got quads.      Yukino is confirmed for no feelings for 8man  ???  Have you not seen her faces and how she acts? what?        He doesn't know until Haruno shoved it in his face.  So he realized it when Haruno said something or do you think she is going to say something?    So Yui's mom knows that Yui has a thing for Hikki?         Everyone getting BTFO   Polygamy is okay 8man     Yui just held hands with yukinon, please pay attention    2015   wearing glasses as protection from computer light  Is she a retard?     Quad 8's confirm OVAs    Her boat still afloat, m8. This episode is pretty much reinforced that only double-YY are now mattered in the romance bowl.    Imagine a fucking polgamy end holy shit the hilarity    This episode sponsored by GUNNAR    Her "feelings" are just a manifestation of her dependency. If you watched the episode you would know that she truly doesn't think of him in that way and she doesn't actually want to pursue him.    Look how big her head is. It's abnormal.   WTF ep 13 cut so much Yui scene. FEEL = YuckyCopypastenonfags?  Yui and Hikki should have a romantic scene after touching fish and yukino left. He blushed and hard to breath, clench his fist ..... Yet they skip it ,disappointed     an anomaly  The author showed her true colors and went and created Evergreen right after Golden Time      Yes, she wanted to give him chocolates I think but she didnt have the courage to do. This was when they were outside the school and Hachiman was about to leave .Then Haruno appeared  Then she withheld the chocolates again when Yui gave him cookies     I can't contain myself.  Someone go to meme HQ and tell them to release memesubs right now      not owning the same pai of gunners as your waifu   pleb       evergreen   dat ending      watari is retard    Another example of how dependent she is on the 8man.    I have meme boss on the phone right now    she's blind, thanks to those super apple glasses she can see the world    Nice denial   I wish humans were incapable of blushing. It would make romance series much more bearable to read/watch.   Holy fuck he looks like S1 8man here And more ikemen     Why is her head so big on that frame?    Seinen refers to gender and age of target audience, not genre.  That said, I'd call the first half SoL/romcom and from 6 onward drama with romcom DNA.      which part? are you in denial?    So she wanted to still give him her chocolates even during a "we're friends" date?       He blushed and hard to breath, clench his fist   Is he having a cancer? And no, FEEL is actually Yuifags. Yui's important scenes are pretty much 1:1 adaptation with minimal alteration. Very contrast with Yukino's infirmary scene and Iroha's train scene.       the face of somebody that is sick and tired of bullshit    well they've touched up finally on yukino's dependency issue that they've been noting since the very beginning (houshi bu, where they fulfill the requests of people who ask). my problem is that if they were to end in the next novel, what the fuck happens to haruno's character? it was touched upon that she pretty much just never found that genuine thing, but is that all that her character amounts to?  somehow one feels that perhaps watari is going to continue after this next volume. we still do have loose strings to tie up. probably endgame though    Now that's alpha.   https://d.maxfile.ro/zbrfeibrkj.web<wbr>m  They're "busy" </wbr>    Weren't those only legit with old CRT screens?    not noticing quad eights   in a Yahari thread         This looks like it's from Psycho-Pass    Well Yui gave Hachiman cookies on the same date so I guess they both had similar ideas.  Rewatching the raws, Yui wanted to leave Yuki and Hachi alone when they were outside the school (so that Yuki can give him her chocolates/cookies/whatever) but Yuki froze up     Can we say good job FEEL? Are FEEL our guys? I think FEEL are our guys.      Yukino is confirmed for no feelings for 8man   Indeed      FEEL cut most of 8man reaction to Yui affection for him in Anime compared what happen in LN.    I think they handled it pretty poorly making everything way too over dramatic but whatever I'll take it.   Like I swear half the time they were talking about the fate of the world or some shit. I don't remember it ever getting THAT bad during the novel.  Genuine scene was 10/10 though, they hit the nail on the head with that.       I'm so sorry...     denial  Stop using that meme word. I think I am on the right track with that observation.   She was just embarrassed. Yukino does not love 8man.        I'm so fucking tired of these mixed signals. Love triangles are never a difficult thing to deal with. If 8man has feelings for one of them then all he has to do is says so. What is he so afraid of? If he has no feelings then admitting that would also fix the problem.   The only one who's not being genuine in this series is 8man. He's just stringing these two girls along because he's too indecisive to give them an answer. Yet he has the gall to berate them for trying to come up with an answer.  Yui and Yukino should just tell him to fuck off and go make Yuri-babies with eachother.       Plot twist   Saber wins the 8grail      I want to brush her fabulous hair and sleep on her lap while she looks at me.    last episode   commie are still lazy fucks and need to rev up their mememachines first  Fucking commie.     Because they will probably not have enough content for a S3, is there going to be an anime original ending?    what the fuck    They cut out a lot of things for both girls. I think early in the series they did the Yui scenes fairly well but now they're putting forth more effort with Yukinoshita.   I think a big problem is that a lot of hachiman's reactions comes from his monologues but its hard to adapt thoughts 1:1 into anime so they have to do shit like overdramatic blushing and hand movements      8 isn't sure of his own feelings nigga.    Too many unnecessary blushes. 5/10     Yukino is a cute.      Love triangles are never a difficult thing to deal with   WA2 would like a word with you      If you hadn't notice 8man has a real fear of romance and of thinking women love him. He is in denial mode.   8man is not genuine and basically told them to ruin their own relationship because he can't get over his own bullshit.     I've been waiting for the right opportunity to make my "saize queen" joke, but I just can't find a place where it'll fit.   ...go on...    The worst thing is the blush followed by the loss of words and a zoom in on the face. I cringe every time.   I know hating Hayama is a meme but I've always gotten the feeling that he would be great friends with 8man if 8man could just stop being such a miserable piece of shit.       what the fuck    i laughed        GTFO Shiro    The problem is that 8man is teying to go for the harem end but, he's obviously having problems along the way.     saize   dibs       Love triangles are never a difficult thing to deal with  They are in k-drama land, which Yahari seems to be copying from.      ...   ...  literally two times  Pal   get the fuck out.          It's going to be a boring Yukino end isn't it   i wuv you   No i wuv you   The end       Volume 12:  2 years time-skip   8man is on a ramen date with Sensei   after eating Sensei is going home   8man calls her   "Wanna go to   saize!? "        of course Gamama knows, unlike Yukimom she's a great mother.  I think I'd approve of Yukino marrying 8man if it meant she'd get disowned by the Yukinoshitas and got adopted by the Gahamas.      You should read the LN instead of mocking me. It's just like they cut the 2nd question on Iroha scene.   Holy shit fuck this I'm watching it raw   More like   Wait for me   I will   The end           it's very  genuine      ellipses can only be used once  How do I into English?     The problem is 8man almost has no reaction at ALL to Yui affection for him in anime compared with his reaction to other girl. When in LN there atleast some fluster or embarassment from his reaction to it.   What the fuck is going with all these underage shitposters? I'd never thought I'd see the day when people here started using WTF unironically.   That fucking penis, I'm dying over here.    8man fucks a panda   panda fucks yukino   happy end      Let's be honest here. Feel prefers Yukino. Take that for what you will.      this one seems like it will be nice. Yui and Yukino are friends and 8man gave them encouragement to be genuine. If they put their hearts on their sleeves then there shouldn't be any hurt feelings.     At least they were making key points clear. So that IF (again: hypothetically speaking!) by some odds chance Yui managed to won the 8inches, it can be explained throughout the the entire S2.    How about you take those shitcorns you call ellipses and you put them back in your ass, fucker.    At this rate, it looks more like an open end leaning on Yukino.  LN might go in a different direction.     Will Mikatan stay safe /a/?

Guriko will die I can feel it   She won't   Up close, Guriko really did retain her pointy eye lashes just like the others.    Oh so she did. Nice catch.     She probably plucks them so she wouldn't look too gay    We need a good incentive to buy the games.  Anime will have a 999-esque safe ending, screencap this shit.       I think Guriko will die just because the Qmay leader is still alive. He'll intervene and probably try and kill Mikatan and Guriko will save her and die in the process.   It'll be a sad ending because the trio weren't able to rescue Guriko, and the game's true ending will be about all three reuniting.       The true end will have two Yuta's. The spirit one gained a physical body somehow, and the two of them will be paired with Chiyoko and Guriko.   See you guys after I watch the finale.  It's been a fun ride. Night.     detailed mech action   Torahachiro such BAMF   Thanks for the songs!    I guess the usual Korean uploaders probably forgot about it.    Is that supposed to be water?

Is she truly dead?  Do robots die?    Wait, the OST is already available?   No.   super happy ending  LALALALALAcan't hear you...  http://board.futakuro.com/jk2/res/1<wbr>679536.htm</wbr>    RIP Strange Juice.   akuryou taisan  AOTY    The OST is released 2 days ago in Japan along with the ED single. Although I can't find an upload of it on the usual sites.   noooooooooooooooo  inb4 everyone switches back and real Guriko dies  whats happening  Pine ;_;    Is Pine in jail or something?   Pine died    The cat was just a regular cat  wat   Buy the game for true end fuckers  What the fuck happened?  Will we be able to get a real happy ending with the game? This is too sad.   Yuta died giving her body to Mikan Guriko died in a fighting     Hnng!   I can't fap to this     No, Guriko is still kicking on Pine's body    BAD END   FUCK THIS SHIT!! FUCK THIS!! FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!    UCHIKOSHI YOU MOTHERFUCKER   It was a good end, but not the true end.    It was sacrifice end, but only because Pine is a fucking moralfag idiot    Look good to me I mean, no magical friendship saving anything    Where can I download the latest episode?   HS hasn't released it yet and some of you guys seem to have seen it already.     wait for hs, we saw the stream   But its magical bodyswap saving eveything   We live in japan so we saw it on tv idiot    I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN  WHY DIDN'T I SAVE MYSELF      Fuck off newfag.    body swap was pretty much given    Can't fucking wait    Sorry, I'm from /pol/ and I started watching this anime because of the whole trans drama thing.  I didn't know there was a stream.      Is that the game?   who's making the game?  also   your reaction when 4infinity is just announcing the localizationn of punchline       See you in another time   I DIDNT ASK FOR THIS FUCK YOU JAPAN!!   So only one from the children survived?   Do you even Uchikoshi?    Guriko got abandoned and is now a forest hobo.  Only Pine is dead. His non-ghost version.      Fuck, don't tell me it's in CG?    inb4 the ending to the vita game is where chiyoko and guriko live  and the actual TRUE ending was on the ps4 this entire time       I don't have ps4     Don't be retarded. PS4 and Vita are the same game.   Preorder for the real true ending!        ps4 and vita have the same ending   sequel game announced   wiiu exclusive      what a ruse!    Sony exclusive  Why? The PC is fine too.      wiiu exclusive  Now this is delusion     Barely anyone has a PC in japan.   It's it told what kind of game will it be? Cause I loved 999 and VLR but fuck if it'll ever be localized.    He doesnt have a PS4       implying the true ending is hidden in the DLC     okay so i'm waiting for subs but is really a bait and switch "here have a lame ending, buy the game for the true one faggot" or are people just exagerating?  what means this?  Heh   Ching chong la, King Kong da    It's an ending just not a completely happy one.    "buy the game -Uchikoshi"   Kinda /u/ ending since Yuta give her body for Mikan as proof of they love   an adventure game with shit ton of puzzles. basically zero escape with pantsu and more gameplay     nopan   BD WHEN?!?!      Towards a peaceful future with the greatest happiness.     Happiness     I think it's more like 3D ghost trick with panties.     the boy gave the girl her body back   /u/  Sasuga delusion       the girl gave her body to her beloved  fixed      beloved  /u/ deluding yet again     It's Mugino, ignore it.      slut    rabura a slut     she's desperate because she's a 29 year old single woman      What a shitty ending.  Literally everything ended unexplained.     Like what?    Chiyoko in Chiyoko body is pretty god damn fucking cute but I'm not satisfied with this ending  I know their are greener pastures out there, where the world is filled with happiness.      Well it's not the true end but I liked it. It was unexpected     Having to buy a shitty game for the tru end   Fucking jews      The faxes.  That's all that comes to mind though.      It was at the end on the rooftop Waiting for subs    what this shit about the true end?  did they say the game will have a actual best ending?     the game will have the a lot of endings.  the anime is just a prologue. we start with the adventure of the next yuta     Oh anon    A pimp I see.    Exactly.  Anime Yuuta fucked it up.      it still hurts  the 4infity site is still going and it's been months i think. though i gave up on the idea that it was ZE#3       best ending?   Also remember       suddenly random italian      italian    So Chiranosuke is  ghost Yuuta?    "buy the game"    noitaminA slot gets wasted for a game advertisement   Guilty Crown 2.0 needs to save the slot once again.     Will Araki's next guilty crown be on noitaminA?    Yes.  Same studio. Same staff. Same timeslot.       Implying Guilty Crown isn't advertisement for the prologue game.  Al least Un-Go 2.0 is going to air on Noitamina next season.        Ahoge    I just fapped to this  Am I gay now?      they're all girls now though    Welcome to capitalism. The Soviet Union is to the Northwest.    buy the game.mp4  I never asked for this I want to get off the ride     Sasuga uchi you fucking troll    It's just one week until the reveal.    Spirit Yuuta explains that.    Too bad I'm a poor faggot      Nailed it!    [HorribleSubs] Punch Line - 12 [720p].mkv   Finally     [HorribleSubs] Punch Line - 12 [720p].mkv   owari da      /a/ denial yet again  fixed     Eaaak! She should end with Meiko instead with a character who is literally doujin blerghtier        Fuck off landwhale, go back to tumblr and kill yourself.      Alright lets get this MAPPA disappointment over with.   Guilty Crown couldn't save anything     best selling noitaminA show for years   gave I.G studio 6 a promotion resulting into them becoming WIT   better ratings than the stuff that came after it   You can say about GC whatever you want but it made money.           The PC is fine too.  Fine for calculating your taxes that is.    I teared up.  This is not the supremely happy and peaceful future I wanted.   ;_;7        pls buy game for better ending   Did I just watch Eva again   reddit leave   https://d.maxfile.ro/lokyriqimk.web<wbr>m   audio version  </wbr>   I'll buy two if it gets localized.   Amazing show, amazing ending. Also a weird alternate prologue for Ginko.     3DS version is literally the best case scenario. Tons of nips have it, Zero Escape series is on it, and emulator will definitely be finished before it's translated.     He's got to live with his sins.     3DS  Not for VNs. The resolution is too low.     Stop dreaming and get a Vita/PS4 already faggots    I got a vita  It's not going to get translated is it?     Really nice ending. I teared a little when Pine decided to sacrifice himself. Such good boy. Also, the production was top notch again and I enjoyed every little second of the episode. The slideshow during the ending was heart-warming too.   Pine is dead  I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS      After ZE3 buddy      It worked well for Zero Escape, I don't see why it can't for Punchline. Resolution is bad, but not too bad.    buying dead console   buying console with literally one exclusive  On top of that, this is /a/. Not many people here give a shit about videogames, definitely not enough to buy a console for this.         Get back to /v/ retard    But Vita and PS4 will get most of the anime-related games.  People don't give a shit that they won't get Splatoon or some Dudebro Gears of War.      Fuck yeah   Huge ponytail.   It helps fill up the empty space to the left?    We're going off-topic now. 3DS is great because it's been tested for this genre, and it will be emulatable in months from now. Right now it can run OoT3D at 80% original speed, with little to no graphical bugs.     The fuck are you even trying to say?   How do Zerofags exist? I don't get it. It boggles the mind. Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!), and the plot is like a less mature version of Fate but with Heaven's Feel for an ending. This is ignoring that Zero is full of shitty CGI.  Even after Ufotable decided to remake UBW into the same sort of adaptation as Fate/Zero, Zerofags manage to actually bitch about UBW and how it isn't as "smart" or "mature" as their shitty spinoff.     Ubw is inferior to zero, just accept it.     CGI   that thing where everyone explains the fight instead of letting it happen   chuuni as fuck characters that don't get punished for being chuuni   JETS         Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!)  Just like F/SN     The main difference that in F/SN the fights had weight to them. There isn't a single fight in Fate/Zero that could even be put in the same category as Shirou v. Gilgamesh, or Shirou v. Berserker, or Gilgamesh v. Berserker.     EMIYA ALLY OF JUSTICE TORTURED BY HIS FATE   not more chuuni than anything in F/Z   Get over it, faggot. UBW pales in comparison. F/Z actually made proper use of the world Nasu built by using masters from all over the world, whereas UBW has FOUR fucking masters from the same high school. I mean, fucking seriously?        How do zerofags exist   muh porn novel is original   it has deep plot and character!  actually :  boring battle   same fighting place   not enough focus on other master beside rin and shirou            expecting the Association, the Church, and just about everything else to get shit done in 10 years    Nasu tends to make all his characters break the rules for the sake of the plot, mostly in UBW. Zero actually felt like a Holy Grail War, with more clever, thought out actions. The servants felt more like their mythological counterparts, and not distorted as fuck as Nasu did to the servants in the 5th HGW. The entirety of UBW was Shirou fanwanking, using plot armor and asspulls to try to show how "deep" of a character Shirou is.       &gt;not more chuuni than anything in F/Z  Yeah, and then he gets his shit kicked in for it. What are you trying to say here?    hurr durr porn can't have a good story  Pic related americunt         Because the protagonist is not an "avarage" highschool boy who beats servants with ease. Mainly because it focuses on every team and not just kiritsugu.     implying any of that matters   It's fucking boring and pandering, m8. Nasu's universe was too interesting of a setting for his writing abilities at the time of Fate/Stay Night.  This whole shit would be a million times better if he had started writing it now as a LN instead of an eroge that needs to justify how four fucking high schoolers are in the world's greatest mage battle.  F/Z actually felt like a real Grail War. UBW did not.    gets his shit kicked in   saves the day like three times   says goodbye to Rin and redeems himself   Did you think a Servant could stay in the world? He left because he ran out of mana, not because he got killed by anyone.                  Shitty CGI  Lancelot CGI was to portray FSG.      hurr durr muh epic fight scenes   Kill yourself, assburger.      Yeah, and it looked terrible.  Ninja Slayer uses CGI for comedic effect, but it still looks terrible.       Gilgamesh v berserker   had weight  you mean berserker took all weight       plays baseball with Tohsaka in the middle of the Holy Grail War   has a picnic   comes home   holy shit, Caster took Fuji-nee hostage!        F/SN is more chuuni and edgy than F/Z, kill yourself you memeing faggot.     4th Holy Grail War   everyone's buddy-buddy   nobody takes that shit seriously EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ADULTS         Because the Fourth Heaven's Feel is actually the ONLY proper Heaven's Feel.  3rd one had Angra Mainyu 5th one had Destroyed grail 1st and 2nd one had broken class systems. 4th had enough preparation and proper placements          everyone's buddy-buddy  oh shit he went full retard     F/Z had actual mage battles requiring strategic choices on the part of masters.  Let's compare:   Shirou v Gilgamesh  DA BOAN OF MAH SWOAD WE R JUSS FAEKS  Saber v Lancer  Saber was at a disadvantage because of a miscalculation so Kiritsugu dicks his way into sabotaging Lancer by cutting a deal with his master. Realistic mage situation. Not to mention this fight is preceded by three different encounters between the two master/servants that build up into this final moment. Each encounter adding another layer to the confrontation.   One is chuuni power level shit, the other resembles what a real mage battle would entail.   Gilgamesh v. Berserker  Jobbing, the battle.  Gilgamesh v. Iskandar  More jobbing, for the same effect.   Shirou v. Berserker  Didn't even happen in the anime. Irrelevant to compare. But it's more Shirou fanwank.   It's pretty stupid to make a cool idea like Heaven's Feel, and only have it done properly once.                        AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA   forgetting Tohsaka and Priest   forgetting Waver and Kerry        thanks for confirming your retardness     It's pretty stupid to make a cool idea like Heaven's Feel, and only have it done properly once.   That's how they managed. First three were just the three great families finding loopholes in the Grail war's rules (and failing horribly)    fucking noobs          Tohsaka and Priest  What? Remind when Tohsaka and the priest went out for a night on the town.   Waver and Kerry  Did they play baseball at some point? I don't even remember Waver interacting with Kiritsugu.        I started watching the Fate Series around March probably. I initially watched UBW S01 and finished it just in time for the start of UBW S02. I got pretty bored with the first episodes, so I decided to watch Zero while UBW S02 was airing.  Well, there's absolutely no contest. Zero had better masters, better servants and an overall better story. Also, all fights seem believable, while in UBW Emiya goes from Crilin to Goku level in a couple of episodes.     I mean story-wise. There's a lot of room for really great character conflict and world building to be expanded on with Heaven's Feel. But we get SoL and jobbing instead.     Is it that hard to get the point the date scene was trying to get across?      implying  https://<span>youtu.be/ogNZtIAeDmM  [ ]     It's usually because people like  happen.     Tohsaka and priest   buddy buddy   backstabbed    rin and shirou   i-i'll kill you shirou if you dont bring saber with you   now who is more buddy buddy later            watching the anime  Opinion discarded.     He was comparing anime adaptations. I doubt he read the Zero LN. Zero anime &gt; UBW anime.     No, the Zero anime is uglier, and still full of the same retarded shit that was in the UBW anime.     he doesnt like saber get bullying     There shouldn't be a fucking date scene in the middle of a fucking Grail War. Do you remember Hitler going bowling with Churchill during WW2? A grail war is a retarded circumstance for teenagers to find love.    That scene alone is better than anything in UBW.    Saber bullying is a miracle of the universe.     saber trashing   buddy buddy      Is it that hard to understand that having a date in the middle of a war is retarded no matter what point you're trying to give to it?     No, the Zero anime is uglier     Exactly. There weren't any retarded date scenes in Fate/Zero, especially not with expensive wine and Grail talk.     He doesn't like saber being bullied.      conveniently using the one shot in the series that wasn't full of CG     UBW had CG too, m8.    Except it isn't, this thread already blew you the fuck out. Stay mad.  Enjoy your play dates during the most intense mage ritual. Oh, let's not forget servants need cum to regenerate mana, fucking kek.   Sorry, did you just compare a mage and Servant discussing the nature of the Grail and humanity to a picnic where a tsundere goes "G-geez, MC-kun"? In your mind, is a college lecture the same as talking about the latest avenger film?          saber trashing   not buddy-buddy  That shit happened in all three VN routes, including the one where Shirou fucks her.       same retarded shit  the place any battle in UBW took place : - school - temple - church - einzbern mansion boring shit over and over          No, I compared a scene where three Servants sitting around drinking and a tsundere goes "g-geez Gil-kun!" to a picnic where a tsundere goes "g-geez MC-kun!"     the world's greatest mage battle   Read the fucking VN.       less mature version of Fate   Fag detected. Calling your waifu simulator "mature" is laughable. Stop being obsessed butthurted about your "mature" waifu games.     Reminder Kiritsugu is so childish that he honestly thought that his ideals could become reality if he managed to get a magical cup, and was willing to put his wife in danger to do it.   Do you want me to pull up the dialogue so we can compare the content of the two?   Gil and Kotomine talked about what it means to desire something, Gil's philosophy on what life entails, the nature of the Grail, and Kotomine's lack of identity.  Rin, Saber, and Shirou talked about how Rin is really scary when she was batting and how much fun they had.  Good job, faggot. You're grasping at straws for like the fifth time this thread.           grimdark is mature   the removal of adult themes makes a story more mature   &gt;&gt;/MAL/       Everyone thought that. That's why all of the servants even bother fighting.     Gil and Kotomine  Retard detected, at least read my post before you respond. Here, I'll just post it again.   No, I compared a scene where three Servants sitting around drinking and a tsundere goes "g-geez Gil-kun!" to a picnic where a tsundere goes "g-geez MC-kun!"        I don't want to read an eroge where getting cummed inside replenishes mana.    Rin and Shirou talked about what it means to desire something. The nature of Emiya, and Emiya's lack of identity.    Yeah, and that doesn't make it any less childish. That's why the 4th HGW is the worst of them all, they're all fighting for the dumbest fucking purpose in existance. In the 5th, everyone who isn't Shinji or Saber has a different purpose for fighting in the war. Nobody desires the grail because it's a stupid thing to bet everything on.    Oh, so when three kings discussed what being a ruler means, each of their approaches to it, and why Saber failed at saving Britain and Lancelot?  Yes, that's exactly like Rin is so kowai! Wow, we had so much fun.      how the fuck you compare Rider and GIl talk completely destroy Saber Ideal. to "we have free time lets play baseball, oh crap caster ambush us"    Then play Realta Nua you subhuman mongrel.     not even RN/10     Yes, fighting to make Saber your wife, destroy the world, because your family told you to is a lot better than fighting to make a girl your wife, save the world, and because your family told you to.   At the picnic? No, they did not. The only time that's explored is in the bedroom and during fights.       I probably will play all of them at some point, but this thread is about the anime, m8.    The bus scene.     fighting to make Saber your wife  He has everything else, thus he wants Saber. He has no other desires that conflict with it, thus it makes sense for him to relentlessly pursue it when she's actually summoned.   destroy the world  For reasons properly explained in every work he's ever appeared in. He despises the world as it is, and only want the ones who stand out to serve him as they did during his lifetime.   because your family told you   Okay who the fuck are you talking about now, because regardless of who there is no way this isn't a massive oversimplification.              holy fk      more edgy than F/Z  F/Z was nothing but muh edge. Constant sacrifices and needless killing for the sake of making things dark.    Leaving aside the usual "Muh Zero is better" or "Muh VN is better" shit flinging from the rabid monkeys, at least one thing that's objectively true is that the Kerry vs Kirei fight is the emblem of good fighting in anime.  No shitty monologuing. No cringe-worthy dialogue about ideals that would be considered childish on a four year old (Hurr durr seigi no mikata) No explaining what each move does and just fucking using it No delaying using the most powerful moves because of muh pacing  Kerry vs Kirei felt like an actual fight between two people who want to kill eachother. They don't talk. They don't explain. They fight. They use right away every move they have, they don't withold anything, they just go until someone is dead.  Anime fighting is one of the worst thing in the medium, and Zero managed to do it right. Too bad nobody followed on it and we still have shitty saturday morning shonen-tier fighting even in mature series.             Ilya heart rip isn't edge   Ilya eye cut and bleeding out isn't edge   Sakura worm raped from child to teen isn't edge   Sakura getting raped by Shinji everyday isn't edge   BloodFort melting everyone into a perpetual pool of sludge isn't edge   Caster torturing Saber isn't edge   Kotomine orphans being living skeletons isn't edge    Consider killing yourself retard.              to make someone your wife  Because he's seen her suffer and tear apart her own family because of her mage husband. He wants to help her, which is itself a delusion. It turns out that all he did was make her suffer more, so he goes crazy.   to save the world  He despises the world as it is, and loves humanity. He wants to save everyone from despair so they don't have to make the choices he did.   for the family  Tohsaka in F/Z is only fighting because family duty to magic, because Root. Illya is only there because she was made to fight in the Grail War, for Root. She has a personal motivation to meet her onii-chan though, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you don't think that's actually better than wanting to advance magic research.           What episode so I can rewatch    Shinji wanting to rape Rin as well as Ilya telling Berserker to rape Saber and Rin as well as wanting to torture Shirou by keeping him alive is way more edgy than anything found in Zero    THIS. no fight in fsn better than this. they always talk talk talk. and resolved dumbly   At least it doesn't have asspulls and John Cena'ing like Shit/Night.  All of Shit/Night is just Shitber and Shitrou John Cena'ing through every obstacle.      He hasn't read HF      Ilya telling Berserker to rape Saber and Rin    Is there a doujin for this?       You can't see me, my time is now     Season 1 finale    12? 13?   Last ep of S1. Immediately after date scene.      But there was explanation that Kirei's using command seals, and that contender is a terrible fucking gun with only one ammo capacity.     Origin Bullet on Kayneth   fucking everything about Team Caster    Kayneth's death   Deermuds death   Kiritsugu's backstory   Kotomine's entire development   Kiritsugu killing his wife and children inside Angra    Kariya's motive   Kariya's death    Lancelot's dumbass shoehorned last fight  Everything but Team Rider was fucking filled with edge during Fate/Zero, the shit in Fate/stay night doesn't even come close.              I'd pay to see that shit nigguh.    This    Caliburn killing Herakles was the only thing that went unexplained, and a constant stream of energy killing off multiple lives sure as hell makes more sense than Iskandar summoning his army several kms away from Gilgamesh so he can get destroyed even harder.    Not that guy, but you can't call every fucking fight or death edgy.   Kariya's motive  sure he's a faggot, but let's not call the motive edgy.     what's with /a/'s autism over edge?  does any attempt on being serious/dark automatically qualify as edge?     I have. A VN has inner monologue and narration, so it can't be compared. Plus, you can just flip past the endless monologuing since you can just go ahead every time you're done reading, instead of enduring endless budget-saving camera pans every time someone is doing that in anime. What I'm saying is that as far as anime goes, no one ever fights right.   Are you saying that's even comparable to the amount of monologuing and explaining in a typical anime fight? Even the explaination about Kirei was brief, and felt more like the actual character trying to find the next course of action. It was dynamic.  On the other hand, the typical anime fight will have a fucking 5 minute dissertation on what's being observed, even when it's incredibly obvious.          The only deaths that didn't have some sort of edgy and dark scene for it was Iskandar and surprisingly Team Caster.    Just wait and see when they watch  Gakkou gurashi      chuuni as fuck characters that don't get punished for being chuuni      Deermud's death   Seriously? Did you even play the VN? Lancer's death in UBW is way more edgier with the way he ended up.   Kayneth's death   How's Taiga begging for Shinji's help while melting just to get a kick in the head less edge?    Kiritsugu's backstory   Sakura's backstory.   Kotomine   that's from F/SN you retarded secondary.   Origin bullet   Caster's torture.   Lancelot's fight   literally your retarded opinion.  reminder that retarded secondary will think pic related is less edge than Zero.                             It doesn't even matter if it's "unexplained" because Nasu's "explanations" are always retarded shit that you're supposed to swallow just because he tells you to   HURR SHE DODGED GAE BOLG BECAUSE LUCK XD   But of course Shit/Babbies eat that shit up because they're fucking retarded and actually believe it makes the fights "intricate" or some shit like that when it's really just the usual bullshit  Especially UBW is chock full of shonenshit like Shirou getting powerlevels forced down his throat "lol he actively gits gud by fighting archer"          Not at all; see  Berserk   mabu rabu   Evangelion   Legend of the Galactic Homos         Anything that isn't serious is moeshit/retarded/otaku-pandering  Anything that is serious is pretentious/edgy/overrated       Seriously? Did you even play the VN? Lancer's death in UBW is way more edgier with the way he ended up.   lancer's death   edgy  nah he went out a hero again Lancer is best servant         using the Gae Bolg example  God you're fucking retarded. Gae Bolg is a surekill, therefor divine favors in the form of luck is the only thing that makes it possible to avoid. The fact that you can't understand something so simple means you're probably incapable of reading.      Lancer's death in UBW   edgy  Nigga the way he died was like an 80s action movie hero  Don't worry, it's just a flesh wound  Man was a goddamn hero.         For some reason, it's not on my computer. Downloading right now.     I dunno, I would think "I'm bleeding out, and this is the prettiest and the kuuuuuruest thing ever" is pretty edgy   The only deaths that didn't have some sort of edgy and dark scene for it was Iskandar and surprisingly Team Caster.  Death is a dark event anon. No one really enjoys death,       Thanks for proving exactly what I was saying, Shit/Babby.     Gae Bolg is a surekill  Well, it obviously isn't and shouldn't have been intrduced as such if it is actually avoidable.      edge  So something being dark automatically means it's edgy? Give me a fucking break and try harder you stupid /v/ermin piece of shit. M.D. Geist is edgy. A Serbian Film is edgy. Elfen Lied is edgy. That webm of that anime where this girl steps and brutally kills a puppy is edgy.  Tragedy does not equal edgy, and I know you have very limited vocab, being a mouth-breathing crossboarder and all that, but try to make your points without meaningless buzzwords from other boards.       Lancer's death in UBW is way more edgier with the way he ended up.  Are you fucking serious? Lancer's death was fucking glorious and 100% heroic, there was nothing edgy about that. Deermud was literally all-out edge, nothing but suffering and killing for the remainder of the entire scene.    Taiga getting kicked  Really? She didn't even fucking die to that, it was just Shinji being an asshole and it didn't even result in anything dark. He got promptly fucked by it without problem.   Sakura's backstory.  True.   that's from F/SN  I was talking about his development you retard, not him as a character. The process of him growing to have his Fate/stay night motive was more dark and gritty than him actually having it in Fate/stay night.    Caster's torture.  Caster's torture was nowhere near as grating as the Origin Bullet crippling Kayneth.   literally your retarded opinion.  Oh yeah sure. Lets pretend that shoehorning Lancelot in a position like that for the sake of forcing last-minute despair into Saber is somehow not forced edge. It's there for that purpose alone.                    Do you think old people who talk about seeing Jesus when they're dying in the hospital is edgy? What the fuck?  /a/ has really twisted that word to the point where it's lost all meaning. It's just "serious thing I don't like" now.    This skill guarantees that you hit the target every time.   So it effects probability?   What? No! You can still luck out.            It isn't avoidable through human feats, the gods have to intervene in order for it not to kill. Treating it as anything but a surekill move when you need divine favors to make it out of there alive is just ridiculous.    Not him, but:   it didn't result in death, therefore it isn't edgy   a character feeling despair is edgy   It's pointless. You don't know what edgy means.          gods have to intervene  As we all know, Gods interacting with mythological characters is unlikely...      Help I don't know how Zero came to be!   Read HF and then realize that Kotomine's character has always been like that was decided before Zero was even out, fucktard.   Taiga wasn't dark  Yes, getting melted into a pool of flesh and then getting kicked around isn't edge, but Kayneth getting his magic circuits destroyed and then getting shot is edge. Right.   Caster's torture  Saber is just strong enough to not show how bad it was. But apparently torture isn't edge and the bullet is.    Still didn't refute the image I posted.  Read the VN before spouting your retarded UBW anime only opinion, cancerous secondary.                it didn't result in death, therefore it isn't edgy  How is it edgy if a hero comes in to save the day before anything bad can continue? You're comparing absolute despair and betrayal to a guy kicking a girl before getting his shit kicked in for doing so. Claiming stay night is anywhere near as pointlessly dark as Zero is just wrong.      divine favors   It's called plot armor.  Nasu decides the target shouldn't die so it doesn't. If it was fired at Gilgamesh, of fucking course it would hit because Nasu wants it to. Even though he has the same luck rank as Saber.   BUT BUT BUT HURRRRRR   Eat shit.             It's like a tiny deus ex machina    Ufobabbies and VNbabbies taking the piss out of each other over whose shit smells better  I came here to laugh at you    This is for you, feel free to save that.    So if we had 20 hours dedicated to Illya getting tortured by Gilgamesh before Shirou magically bursts in to save the day, it wouldn't be edgy? If Ufotable animated 20 minutes of Sakura getting raped on-screen, but then Shinji gets killed, it isn't edgy?  Fucking retard.       Zero is more edgier than this  People will actually think this     Why is she so adorable?     Winter Forest is edgy  No, over the line, fuck you      Kotomine's character has always been like that  The acts and the way his development progressed was more edgy than anything. Not only that, but in hollow ataraxia we actually get to see him somewhat mellow out so in stay night his mindset isn't even as set on being dark and he just wants to finish up his goal.    getting melted into a pool of flesh and then getting kicked around  She didn't melt entirely and ended up being saved pretty fucking quickly afterwards. It was only there to demonstrate Shinji being a dick and getting punished for it.   Saber is just strong enough to not show how bad it was  So you're making assumptions based on nothing. The torture was definitely painful, but it wasn't a gory process meant to appeal to edgefags.   hurr durr better call him a secondary despite defending the number 1 source of secondaries  Yeah, the image you posted is edge but virtually everything in Zero was so what you're trying to imply is wrong. Stay night did have dark and edgy moments, but they weren't nearly as frequent nor as much the focus as it was in Zero.               If you guys are referring to the 20 second exchange on the bus before running into caster with Taiga, then what on fucking earth are you smoking?   You didn't enjoy the date?!   Well..   Loosen up, dude. Whatever happened isn't that bad. You'd be happier if you got over it.   to    I don't know why I've never desired something.   Maybe you don't understand what desire is.   What is it to you?   detailed explanation involving man's nature   Watching 13 now to make sure this isn't what you're referring to.                   It's called plot armor.  So you have no argument. They explain it outright and it makes complete sense, but of course it's plotarmor despite that because you're incapable of reading.   If it was fired at Gilgamesh, of fucking course it would hit  Except again you're wrong. He fought Gilgamesh for 12 hours during Fate, and he didn't win. If Gilgamesh Luck level had been lower, then he would most likely have, but due to it being that high it wasn't enough.       Why would you even use edgy as criticism? Is there anything that suggests that edgy things are inherently bad or are some people just afraid of being associated with a stereotypical view of a certain kind of teenager on an anonymous image board?     Citing F/HA  Might as well kill yourself right now   She is in pain but she isn't throwing up and shit so it isn't edgy!  Really?    Someone recovered from it so it isn't edgy!  I guess since Kayneth ended up in a wheelchair the origin bullet scene wasn't bad amirite?  F/SN is just as edgy if not more so than Zero.  to think otherwise proves you are a secondary.               Is there anything that suggests that edgy things are inherently bad   It literally means "serious done wrong" to most people.      In the darkness as thick as blood, only one solitary candle flicked. The dim candlelight reflected Uryū Ryūnosuke's handsome face. In front of the man, three rows of raw meat that reflected bright red were placed.   They were intestines. On the long table were human intestines.   Ryūnosuke stared intently at the intestines in front of him, then picked up a tuning fork with his left hand and hit it on the edge of the table   Before the clear sound of the tuning completely disappeared, he quickly poked everywhere on the intestines with his right hand.   Ahhh...   Haaa...   A seemingly agonizing sound suddenly came out of the darkness.   Ryūnosuke listened carefully to the sound emitted, and nodded satisfactorily after he compared it with the residue echo of the tuning fork.   "Very good, so here it's ‘mi'."   As he spoke, he marked a point on the intestines with a pin. The intestines seemed to be still alive. To be correct, it seems the owner of the intestines was still alive.   On the crucifix on top of the long table, a girl who was sobbing incessantly with pain was tied up. A horizontal cut was made on her abdomen, and the innards that were dragged out were being fondled with in Ryūnosuke's hand.   To make the girl picked as the material not die from massive blood loss or infections, Bluebeard placed a few healing and rejuvenation spells on her body, and specially made some adjustments to prevent the pain from numbing her brain.   "Very good, so one more time. 'Do re mi~'"                  This attack will always hit, no matter what.   Unless a god gives you extra luck   Something that bends probability losing to probability doesn't make logical sense, but Nasu a hack anyway.   Not him, by the way. I just hate Nasu's writing, while I love his world building.           ignoring canon sources   while calling anyone else a secondary  It was in a flashback so it was before the events of Fate/stay night.   she isn't throwing up and shit so it isn't edgy!  You know if you're grasping as far as to pretend that Kayneth getting shot with the Origin bullet was somehow less edgy than Taiga getting kicked and then saved then I don't know what to tell you.  Kayneth ended up in a wheelchair during different circumstances. His dreams had practically been pulled from him due to that encounter and his chances of winning reduced to almost nothing.           Gae Bolg doesn't bend probability, it reverses cause and effect.    See     Fits right at home with Blue Beard's story. He tortured children.    That's even worse. If it reverses cause and effect, why wouldn't it be able to reverse the effect of a divine favor?        Nasu himself said to not take F/HA seriously  But nope gotta grasp straws!   Kayneth's dream getting crushed  IF we're going there, you can use that argument for literally everyone.        Because the favor of god is practically the same as the favor of reality itself. It was never a weapon designed to kill divine beings, simply the weapon of a knight.    We're not talking about killing divine beings, we're talking about reversing cause and effect.  If it reverses cause and effect, bending reality IS it's business as that is literally a fundamental aspect of reality.      Team COOOOL are just a pair of lunatics torturing a helpless little girl Ilyasveil is targeting a potential Master and while she's seriously disturbed we're at least given a justification as to why   In the sense of "when Gae Bolg is activated, the result will always be that the target is struck" Whatever happens in between is left up to fate          citing a dead end as edgy  eric     It's very clear he said that because of the lighter elements to it rather than seeing it as a direct sequel to any of the routes. Difference is, these events happened to Bazett before she died, so there's no way they're not canon because it doesn't conflict with anything. There is no statement claiming that everything in hollow ataraxia. All that statement means is that stay night is prioritized over it in terms of which word is considered the most important when actual conflicts in dialogue appear. If anything you're the one grasping at straws denying a work which is explicitly meant to expand upon the Nasuverse.   you can use that argument for literally everyone  Yeah, but it would be that argument alone without the process of it being needlessly dark and gritty.       FSNfags trying to shit on Zero    Seriously why? I don't get it. Trying to pretend its completely different from Stay Night is laughable, and trying to pretend the anime versions are vastly different is even more laughable.  Are you THAT asspained that maybe some people got intro'd through Zero anime? There's just as many people starting fate from UBWs anime now who didn't even watch Zero. Its the same shit.       Being justified doesn't make it less edgy, she wanted to use torture tools while keeping Shirou alive, it's no different than Ryuunosuke acting like a pyschopath    My point was that gods are outside the realm of something which mortals can affect without a divine or demonic force made to combat it. When Gae Bolg would strike a divine being or a being with divine favors, then it's directly trying to bypass something which has the ability to outright remove it from existance if the favor is high enough.  The Gods in the Nasuverse will always be prioritized higher in anything.      The only argument you have for Kayneth is that it was an attack that destroyed his dreams and left him in a wheelchair.  There are dozens of other characters in this setting with worse fates. It's retarded to bring this up alongside someone like Caster's Master who watches the only thing in his life that had meaning die to then die pathetically against a Servant.      Since when?    Since /a/ decided they were the ones in charge of language    For me, it has always meant senselessly grimdark for shock value.   HF &gt; Zero &gt; shit &gt; Fate &gt; UBW    World's greatest mage battle.   a dubious, broken system using a leylines from a washed-up town in the far East.    Not a single big name in Nasuverse cared about it.   greatest.  Whatever you say, m8.        You realize Nasu oversaw Zero and agreed that Kotomine will act like that. He enjoys watching humanity suffers, this is echoed in all three routes, Zero only showed it in action   dark and gritty  And Shinji turning to a meatmound isn't dark and gritty? Or Ilya? Or Soichiro and Caster? Plenty of master and servants lost and suffered.       It left him in a wheelchair and set up the future events. It's a dark outcome with a dark process that proceeded to even darker events. There was nothing positive, no ray of hope like Shirou saving Taiga, nothing.  Also Kuzuki didn't even comprehend his own feelings, that's why he was completely empty by the time she dies. It was his only purpose left, but it was nothing which he necessarily considered to have meaning.       she wanted to use torture tools while keeping Shirou alive  Ilya's goal was to capture Shirou and transfer his soul into a doll or some other container. She wants to do this because she's using Shirou as a proxy for Kiritsugu, in terms of both revenge for abandoning her and having someone with her who will never leave her alone again. Ryunosuke and Giles tore out a little girl's intestines for the purpose of listening to her scream. That's it.      I'm not arguing that it's not how he would act during the events of Zero, but by the time stay night hits he's become different and matured beyond minor pleasures due to having experienced loss and everything else.   Shinji still ended up being saved. That's the thing, shit in Zero never goes right. When someone does something dark, there is never any form of salvation, that's the complete opposite of how almost all events in stay night are.      Is there a ray of hope in Kuzuki's story? No. It was a dark outcome with a dark process that gave you a definite dark ending. No ray of hope like Assassin saving him, nothing.  He watched his only purpose die, became an empty shell, and died pathetically at the hands of his supposed ally.       That's the thing, shit in Zero never goes right.   What is Waver?      Yeah, but what's so bad about something being a little dark or having shock value if it's entertaining?     Do you think old people who talk about seeing Jesus when they're dying in the hospital is edgy? What the fuck?  What are you babbling on about? When did I say anything like that?     Kuzuki never had any real emotions to begin with. He spent his entire life being emotionless with only once instance in his life where he actually expected to feel something, and that was way past. It's not a dark ending, it's an empty ending if anything. He never had any desire to live anyway, he just lived on for teh sake of it. Caster wasn't a purpose for him in stay night, and it would take him longer than that to actually grow to doubt himself or even feel anything concerning it.    I already said in a previous post that Team Rider was the only ones who actually had a brighter story.        trapping someone's soul in a container so you can keep them hostage forever against their will because your parents abandoned you is not edgy   Okay, m8.   I can enjoy some bits of shock value if they're properly timed, but certain things abuse it and make it the only appeal. Dark themes/events are not inherently edgy.     "I'm bleeding out, and this is the prettiest and the kuuuuuruest thing ever" is pretty edgy     A character with no emotions whose whole life is empty and has no desire to live, dying without purpose is not edgy   Holy fuck.                 When it tries to hard. Devilman is edgy as fuck but on a whole it's pretty great.     I already said in a previous post that Team Rider was the only ones who actually had a brighter story.   Which is a feat in an of itself. Not only for any grail war, but for one that had to set up the FSN one, which required people to die in order for the protags to not have the full story of the grail.  The two wars don't have the same purpose. The 4th had to be the bad end to set up the 5th having a better one, and they STILL managed to give someone a positive ending in Zero.        So in summary  Edgy: things I don't like   Not Edgy: things I like       Not in that particular end.     became an empty shell   became  He started out as one, and he died as one.       the route where all the characters give up is the best  Fuck off edgefag     How is it edgy? He has no purpose, and he overcame his purpose to die in his past. After that, his death was just another event rather than his purpose. There was nothing dark about his story.     it's a bad end so it's alright if it's edgy  The same VN showed it's possible to make a dead end without edginess, like the one where Shirou forgets about the Holy Grail.   Perfect taste.        I'm not pretending Zero is a bad story or anything, I'm saying that claiming Zero was anything but darker than stay night is just an outright lie. The guy I'm arguing with is implying the complete opposite when in stay night, there are few who don't find some form of salvation.     Fuck off edgefag  No, I'm just a fan of older Nasu. Tsukihime, KnK  movies , and Heaven's Feel were all better than Fate and UBW.      That's exactly what anon has been doing throughout this thread.  I don't know how you can think someone being crippled by Origin Bullet is edgy, but Shirou's soul being trapped inside a doll for Illya to play out her deluded fantasy is not.    nothing dark about someone without purpose who doesn't care about death or life and marches to death willingly           nothing but edgeshit first     That's my point. Edgy doesn't inherently mean something is bad yet it's used like that here. I wouldn't be ashamed to admit that I enjoyed Fate/Zero for its edginess.      HF&gt;UBW  Aside from that you're right. I liked Tsukihime more than fate.      I'm saying that claiming Zero was anything but darker than stay night is just an outright lie    Thats its purpose you moron. And even then its not that much darker. Its a prequel that came out after to explain how things got to where they were in FSN. Kirei and Gil have to walk away, thats already built in. So in that sense of course its darker.  But its not like FSN is really any better. Its only because Shirou gets to walk away instead of the antagonist. Illya and the like still get fucked no matter what.          UBW &gt; HF  disdain_for_plebs.jpg     UBW was more enjoyable than any of those. Seeing Shirou following his ideals in the face of everything going on was the best. It's the only route where I actually felt like I was making the right choices for someone trying to become a hero.     liking MC fanwanking over actual stories  Of course.     You realize Shinji only found salvation in UBW right? And that only happened because it was to cement Shirou's ideology of saving everyone. Ilya dies in every route even the one where she had the most development, she didn't find salvation at all. Kauzki found nothing either and neither did Caster whose death can be considered edgy by your standards.  Whereas Zero &gt; Kiritsugu found salvation in Shirou and Waver became successful, compare that to the constant of success found in Stay night, Rin and Shirou, the numbers are the same.       He properly said Tsukihime &gt; Fate, so its okay.      Thats its purpose you moron  I never claimed otherwise, I still like Zero somewhat. The main difference I find between stay night and Zero is that even if characters die in one route, then they generally find some form of happiness in another. Illya didn't get fucked in every route. She got nice development and even the way she went out in HF wasn't dark in any way from her perspective, since she was happy for what she accomplished with it.     They have 3 fucking routes to get a good ending, no shit.  Zero is one story and you already know how it ends. Kariya can't save Sakura, Tokiyomi will die and Kerry will fuck up but save Shirou. But even then you got Waver coming out of it better.      I can't like HF The idea that shirou throws away his beliefs entirely for some stupid bitch is retarded. Especially after UBW where he refused to back down. Not to mention Sakura is jealous unlikable cunt. H/A actually made me dislike her more somehow when it had the opposite effect for every other character even shinji.       (You)   &gt;"I'm bleeding out, and this is the prettiest and the kuuuuuruest thing ever" is pretty edgy   Are you honestly comparing seeing Jesus on deathbed to "I like the color of my own blood?" Are you fucking insane?       He found simple happiness in Sakura and Ilya. He doesn't need to strive to be a hero anymore if he is happy already.    It wasn't MC fanwanking, it was just him actually following his ideals. In Fate, they practically skimmed over that part entirely for the sake of showing more of Saber. In HF, he gives them up without caring for the idea of the act of following the ideal itself being beautiful. The story of UBW is the story of Shirou. It wasn't dark because the MC was steadfast in not wanting to regret any decision he made when walking that path regardless of what he'd have to do during it. Him having to preform the same actions as Archer will still pain him greatly, but as long as it's for the greater good he'll follow it.   Claiming that UBW was anything but an actual story when there were obstacles to overcome and the entire route following his gradual development is dumb as shit.   Though I wouldn't expect anything else from someone who prefers Tsukihime over it, since in Tsukihime the MC wasn't nearly as interesting and took other works to even get him to be an actual character.         Zero is one story and you already know how it ends  Of all sad words of tongue or pen The saddest are these, 'It might have been.'       H/A actually made me dislike her more somehow when it had the opposite effect for every other character even shinji  Fucking this. Throughout HF she was a manipulative bitch, but all HA did for her was expand her into jealous bitch territory as well. The only argument anyone ever seems to bring up for liking her is that they like the idea of giving everything up for your waifu.      the MC wasn't nearly as interesting  Actual insanity is way more interesting than your fanwanking route.     Both are: "I'm dying and I'm at peace with that." There really isn't anything edgy about what Caster said, he was just finding rest in death.    Illya is dead.      Reading HF for Sakura  Well there's your problem      Ilya route a BEST.    So is Prisma a route where Kiritsugu decides to run away at that castle scene?     actual insanity  All you're referring to is mindless insanity. Shirou was an insane person, but only in that the had aspects of himself he couldn't control, like his wish to follow the ideals that he had grasped for since his childhood.   Calling it fanwanking is silly as shit, when Tsukihime is just a huge fucking fanwank where he gets everything ever. Shirou is miles better of a protagonist than the blank slate Shiki is.       You know, if it actually was Illya's route then I wouldn't have any problem with it. Problem was he threw everything away for Sakura, with a few scenes of Illya. The scenes with Illya were good sure, but when 90% of the route is him chasing after Sakura and doing shit with Sakura, then that's going to cause at least 90% of the route to be SHIT.    No. In Prisma, Irisviel and Kiritsugu just kill all of the Einzbern and prevent the war from starting entirely.     Shirou was an insane person  You mean a complete retard? Nanaya Shiki was way more entertaining.      Eight months after Ilya is born, Kiritsugu and Irisveil wipe out the Einzberns to abort the Grail War so their daughter can live a normal, happy life  It doesn't go quite as planned      In prisma he and Iri decide that Ilya is more important than the grail war and kiritsugu slaughters the einzbern family    Holy shit, but how does that stop the war from starting? Do they explain this in depth in the manga?    Hitler-kun went on a picnic to the olympic games.    That war was the first, none of the other families even knew about it and the Einzbern name is forgotten    If by entertaining then you mean repetitive and a massive Gary Stu then yes. Shirou can't even fucking compare to the levels of fanwank that Shiki gets to.  Shirou knows exactly what he's going into, and he's not overly powerful at all. He has a strong innate ability that was developed through his mindset, but it's not an overwhelming one. He follows his ideals because it's beautiful to him, because he's a broken individual, but it's because of that insanity he's able to bring happiness to many.   Shiki is just for edgelords who don't want anything else.        That's not during WW2, fuckboy. Hitler-kun is a very serious boy who doesn't have time for antics.    In Prisma, that was going to be the first Holy Grail War, and the Einzberns had prepared everything on their own.     I am the bone of my bait.jpg    Guys i wanna start watching Fate/stay ubw, which one do i watch? theres like 4 different ones   I'm not talking about Caster, but his master went full retard     So I can't even pretend it's a real Illya route that can be shoehorned into fitting with F/Z.     Read the VN Watch Zero Read hollow ataraxia  Do it in that order and you can basically start with everything else in any order you want. The Fate route can get incredibly boring but just force yourself through it. You're going to end up liking either HF or UBW generally.   Also don't listen to Tsukihimefags, they're just lonely and want people to look at pages in the manga with Shiki cutting things with them.          Shirou is closer to a Gary Stu than Shiki is. Neither of them are, of course, but UBW itself is incredibly broken and the only servant that actually beat EMIYA is Berserker's convenient counter to UBW.     Watch Zero and then Ufotable's UBW. Ignore the movie and the DEEN adaptation.      Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!)  That's nothing like Naruto. That's Errol Flynn shit. Naruto is magic nukes and shit.      Zero first  All it'll do is spoil HF for him. He's better off watching UBW and waiting for the HF movie before watching Zero.     Read Tsukihime, read Plus Disc, read KT, read and play Melty Blood, read and watch all of KnK, read the F/SN VN, read Hollow Ataraxia and read F/Z.     watch Zero first      my shitty eroge adaptation is better than your chuuni LN adaptation!  They're both shit, Prisma best route, deal with it.    Heaven's Feel &gt; Zero &gt; Prisma Illya &gt; UBW  It's always great to see you fatefags argue which show is shittier when both series is garbage.  I just can't imagine what kind of fanbase you both have anymore. Combination of newfags, nostagiafags VN readers, cancer from /jp/, narutofags, etc.  Enjoy your thread.       Edgelord detected      Carnival Phantasm   Why are magical girl spinoffs always better than the source material?       Everyone knows Tsukihime, CP, and Prisma are superior.     dunecooning      Please explain what's going on in that gif      This scene right here is already better than the entirety of anything else there is in the other series adaptions. Zero has so much more weight to it than something like ubw. The universe in zero is much fuller and actually has some substance rather than everyone coming from the same highschool and only having one location etc. A comparison would be something shitty like bleach that has 3-4 locations max vs one piece which is a whole world + potentially moons and shit.  Another example...alexander vs gil is barely even a fight and yet it has so much more meaning and maturity to it than any ubw fight. Its like comparing obi vs vader to any of the garbage prequel fights.   Also this   The entire franchise is absolute garbage, but at least zero tries to make something WHOLE out of it that has some actual scale.           Phantasmoon sucks. Worst part about CP. Prisma illya has its moments. Bazett was the best part about it.      Phantasmoon was the worst part of CP  Say that to my face and not online and see what happens faggot      Phantasmoon sucks. Worst part about CP.  Kill yourself.     Archer vs Shirou in the VN blows Banquet of Kings out of the water.     It was boring shit, not really funny either. Shiki+Shirou teamup was the best part by far.      I'm right!   No you're wrong!   I'm right!   Okay maybe you're right    better than KINGLY TALKS and saber bullying         Can't we all jusy agree that Fate is just shit in general? Or nah?    /a/ ever agreeing on something      simplifying it to DEEN levels  As expected from a Zerofag.     HF is a modest 7/10 but the rest is shit. Zero was a 6/10 only for Iskandar and Waver.     Fate became shit in general after F/Z got adapted.   God tier:  Holy Grail Grand Prix   Marble Phantasmoon   Seihai-kun   Berserker's First Task (Berserker's Day Out?)   Saber At Work   High tier:  Sakura telenovel   MCs date everyone   Final Dead Lancer   Magicians Hate Technology   Mid tier:  Holy Grail game show   Ilya's Castle Let's Play   Tsukihime at the beach   Shonen H   MC's date the main heroine   Low tier:  Neko scenes   Sharing Tables   Please stop tier:  Back Alley Alliance                             Because the originals are made by throwing random ideas on paper to make money, but the magical girl spin-offs are made out of pure love.    Fate is not only shit, but it was so close to at least having the HF appeal of a few cool fights.  Lancer vs Gilgamesh could've been great, and Archer vs Berserker was so good that even DEEN managed to make it great.      Oh fuck, I forgot. Caster and Souichiro go somewhere on high-tier.     Nope, this is pretty correct in terms of what you get with each      and the plot is like a less mature version of Fate but with Heaven's Feel for an ending.    Fate    mature        Final Dead Lancer   Date Everyone   Shiki's master   not Elder God Teir         worst thing in her own route   worst thing in her own scenes in HA   worst thing in her own CP episodes  Is there anything Sakura can do right?        &gt; Fate   &gt; mature  That's not what I said      Well, her Servant is oppai megane, so I guess she did something right.    this thread     oppai megane  So she fucked that up too.     I think you forgot messed up there friend. Phantasmoon is on the wrong end of the tier list.          Yun    Why do people even like this self-insert character?  Fate Stay Night becomes much less interesting once you take the mistery away.  I remember when i first read the VN without knowing any of the servant identities or the nature of the grail. Much of the story revolves around trying to unveil the secrets of the war but making an adaptation focusing on that when everyone already knows everything from Zero and DEEN adaptations wouldn't work.  So we are left with an anime focused on the battles which really doesn't capture the atmosphere of the original story.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=j4x<wbr>sfkhcw-A</wbr>  [ ]        ubw feels like it was made for self insert faggots    broken sociopath   self insert         I'm used to seeing dead bodies       This is fine. I'm comfortable with this turn of events.        fate adaptation is airing (again for about the 100th time)   have to endure 15 fate threads a day  thank god it's almost over      implying HF movies won't start airing soon.   implying we won't get Ataraxia after that.  The new Fate golden age will never ever end.      Jokes on you, Prisma airs after UBW.    If you don't want Type-Moon on the front page, you should really stop browsing /a/.     2016 : HF route   2017 : Fate route   2018 : Hollow/ataraxia anime   2019 : Tsukihime VN remake + Arcueid route anime   2020 : Ciel route + Akiha route   2021 : Hisui route + Kokahu route   2022 : Satsuki route  The ride will never end.           say hello to illya next month     JETS   I am the bone of my missile Steel my body and jet fuel my blood I have created over a thousand JETS Have fired over a thousand missiles yet jet fuel will never melt steel beams So as I pray, UNLIMITED JET WORKS.           2019   Tsukihime VN remake  Look at this optimist.     If they made an anime about your life what studio would you use?    Milky    Trigger I've died many times so it'd be interesting seen that animated   BONES. Let's see if they can come up with an ending worse than the original one now.   Ufotable   PA Works Admittingly nothing much happens   Kyoani, now I'm finally a girl.  DEEN because it would be cheap and shit.  Kyoani, maybe I'll have some lewd luck    Anime about cute NCOs in the Finnish Defence Force training cute rookies into soldiers  I'd go with White Fox because I can't think of anything else.    Gonzo.  Gainax, just to see if they can make something interesting and/or crazy out of my extremely dull and uneventful life  Shaft since I spend my entire day in a single place, might as well be huge and well drawn.  Shaft. My life needs more plot and thought provoking themes.   They easily could. Don't tempt fate.   Bones.  Shaft, fucking love the art style in monogatari and nisekoi  What did you think of the chapter?   All the Uchihas would've been better as girls.    You think Bort  lets her wear the jacket and gags her with the headband while fucking her in the ass?     no, i don't. it's a kids manga, with kids as characters you sick fuck.      naruto hasn't seen sakura pregnant     Sakura looks like Kushina here.   Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed  http://www.zero-tsukaima.com/    I know nothing about this series apart from that the glasses girl has some great porn.    Shit taste.    I hated this show so much that I ended up loving it. I'm actually excited it's going to be finished.    Did they manage to gather the dragon balls?   I'm so happy that they're going to finish what he couldn't finish himself. I don't even care it it's shit, just knowing that it's finished will be fine.  And the self-declared winner of the Kiyoshibowl is...   holy fucking shit, I`m 10 pages in and already hate this trash. the guys are all betafaggots and the retarded fanservice is disgusting. jew noses and shit art.    Cool blog    Nice b8     betafaggots  M-types are the best guys.      Chiyo  Disgusting   self-incerting   baiting        Don't mess with the Ruris  hey guys, i'm a bit outdated from YGO TCG. it is true that the card game became a PTW?   Oh anon, its been a pay to win since the first starter deck  Summoned Skull+Axe of Despair=You win.  5Ds with Synchro Solitaire pretty much sealed it though       ENJOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY   KOI KOI KOI KOI KOI KOI KOI KOI       TCG   P2W  You don't fucking say. Go back to /v/.     .   Velvet was once a quiet and simple girl, who shared nothing but strong feelings and love towards her family, but after a certain incident that occurred three years piror, she completely changed.     She no longer smiles anymore, and instead, displays colder feelings such as anger and hatred. The girl who suppresses the kind and gentle part of herself in exchange for a colder passion, will be the one to shock the entire world.

No seriously, it really is.      Edgy is ok period. Edgy characters are always the most fun.   People love Shadow, the only reason people hate Donte is because he was a rape of the original Dante      Edgy girls are the best.     Rina Sato  My dicks already hard.    Who was best tan?   Chu-tan was best girl all along  I knew it, cat a shit.    Good thing their etoshin, not animals   Why is your dick so small anon?    vlc     Yeah, goats and sheep have weirdly high body temperatures. Meaning Mei-tan's sheep pussy will be extra hot.  I guess Shaa-tan's would vary between cold and hot, which would be interesting.   </blockquote>]
