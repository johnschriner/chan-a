They should make a beautiful lewd shota figure, I'd buy that.</br>  <br>I think it'll look nice once I'm done setting up. I only wish I could route the cables from the back.</br>  Only a bunch of weeks until the KanColle event and the release of the Vita game.    <br>Sure.<br><br><br>Sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, let's be friends.</br>  <br> Thereafter Chinese merchants dealing with foreign trade (known as yanghang (洋行, literally "ocean traders") acted through the Cohong under the supervision of the Guangdong Customs Supervisor (Yuèhǎi guānbù jiàn dù, 粵海关部监督), informally known as the "Hoppo", and the Governor-general of Guangzhou and Guangxi. <br><br>China has a long history of respect for Hoppos.</br></br></br>  <br>Meanwhile the US bans Poi</br>  Fuck, she's on to us.  <br>Yo buddy, still alive?</br>  This thread needs more Mabel.  <br>Can it still fly with a third of its wing missing?</br>  <br> f15 <br> wing gets damaged  <br> loses wing <br><br> a10 <br> wing gets damaged  <br> doesn't lose wing <br><br>That just proves the F15 was a piece of shit overpriced "superiority" fighter. The F14 was superior in many parameters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the F-15 lost its wing in a mid-air.</br>  What is this expression trying to convey?  <br>Oh boy, here we go</br>  <br>We have an /lgbt/ board, dingus.</br>  <br/>  <br>Actually I just reported and linked the thread in the IRC with a mod. You can thank me later.</br>  <br>Fair point but this looks well beyond saving.</br>  Post the worst girls of their respective series  fuck this boring ass marie sue shit<br>why did they have to pick the only uninteresting servant to be the protagonist?</br>    <br>Remove Mio and Touka, and I completely agree with you.</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>Now that's delta.<br> Pic unrelated to topic, she is best girl. </br></br>  Why can't Tuesday come fast enough?  <br>let me try</br>  <br>Novel and manga*</br>  <br><br>I see, that's an interesting path the author took. But it does give easy access to the kingdom's nobility.</br></br>  <br>YOU DARE QUESTION BOB'S AUTHENTICITY?<br><br>I AM ABLE TO RETRACT MY LIMBS AS WELL AS MY HEAD IN ORDER HIDE INSIDE MY HARD CARAPACE PROTECTING ME FROM HARM <br>BEING ABLE TO FIT ON THE PALM OF A PITIFUL HUMAN'S HAND, I CAN THEN SLOWLY PROTRUDE MY HEAD OUT OF MY SHELL AND STARE MENACINGLY<br><br>MENACINGLY, I SAY<br><br>I AM BOB <br>GRAND TURTLE OF THE ASPECT BOX</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As said, author hasn't written that far. Afaik  Vol 9 end sees her older half-brother die and Kingdom politics go into shitstorm in future (probably) since they just lost crown prince and one prince + her remains . She might "help" the  remaining prince to get some leverage. who knows .</br>  things you learn from animu &amp; mangoes  <br>You probably prefer Vegemite.</br>    Does anyone have that screen cap with Ichika from IS saying "children have parents" or something really redundant like that.  <br>I have better stuff</br>    OPN manga will be publishing in Poland!  <br><br>What's wrong with JPF? Just asking, I stopped buyfagging polish manga like 5 years ago.</br></br>   manga in Poland   Dont you have toilets to clean?  <br>Jokes on you, my Old Man is the king of toilets.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=t_O<wbr>DhVn78SI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Time to rewatch this.</br></br></br>   Worst adaptation of this summer   <br>you can't even look</br>  <br>Wow... I didn't think I'd get to find a legit reason to use this so soon after making it.<br>Thank you, you dip-shit.<br>Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>think of the child...oh yeah you are; as you were!</br>  <br>at least we'll have this gem to remember out of all the shitposting that's happened since the anime was announced</br>  <br>quick, get the Madonna song off the school PA, they are getting way too 'into' a certain song right now</br>  I know it's common in nippon animu that scientists are pure evil, but this is just retarded. <br><br>Dropped.</br></br>  Subs are out, move here<br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>There's still this one faggot<br/></br>  Is HS by funi?    The dog kicked the Megane-Kun 2x<br>Typical guy Heroin, cliche, generic, violent.<br>Who loves kicking men, for stupid reasons</br></br>  Halfway through and forced drama and general retardation is creeping in really fast into this one. Too bad, it has/had really big potential to be amazing.<br><br>Are the romances resolved at the end or is it open ended garbage?</br></br>  <br> Are the romances resolved at the end or is it open ended garbage? <br>no idea, had to drop that shit around episode 6 and I'm sure I'm not the only one</br></br>  What's with all the Sakurasou threads lately?  <br>Dropped on episode 1, even though blonde girl charmed my snake if you know what I mean.</br>   Are the romances resolved at the end <br><br>No<br><br> is it garbage? <br><br>Yes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Well... it sort of turns into a series about growing up, and it forgets that it's a romance. There's one romance that gets solved, the other are left in the air.<br><br><br>Dunno. I made one a couple of days ago, just 'cause it seemed like nobody in Japan watched it.</br></br></br>  Is there a character universally liked by /a/?  Never seen anyone hate on Siegfried.<br><br>Probably because of what happened and all.</br></br>    Chifusa    <br>This</br>  Rock Lee probably found a ninja prostitute.  <br>probably got him drunk to do it, either that or she begged.</br>  <br> CRT monitor <br>The fuck<br>Naruto has an iPad how does this happen</br></br></br>  <br>His iPad was wide as fuck though.<br> Implying boruto isn't hipster faggot </br></br>  <br><br> iPad <br>Do you mean the laptop?</br></br></br>  <br>No, I mean the one he has at home in that picture where Boruto is leaving through the window.</br>   Best girl appears <br> Bitch gets slapped <br> Cryptic messages in the OP <br> Special ED </br></br></br>   75 cycle    time leap   <br>Also seems to say geocentrism.</br>   特殊能力＝病気 <br> Special ability = illness </br>  <br>Sounds useful.</br>  http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/18-1/school-live-manga-s<wbr>ales-increases-10-times-after-tv-an<wbr>ime-premiere</wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>I wonder if that would make her snap out of it or just completely break her. If the bear breaks maybe she'd see Ruu dying?<br><br><br> Maybe someone will get hurt or into trouble but no one is going to die <br>Megu-nee is already dead. Takes a lot more to kill a main character admittedly, but I see it happening eventually. Fuck Kurumi is already turning.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just keep taking the one in the ten billion chances. It's bound to happen sooner or later, it's not impossible.</br>  <br>Okay then. I don't even care if she's a virgin or not cause I'm making sure all parts of her body will be covered in my semen. Marking my territory and everything.</br>  <br>Megu-nee is a posthumous character, it's not the same as killing one of the main girls, specially because the manga is about the girls sticking together as friends.<br><br>Kurumi is the only one likely to die and that's only if she doesn't get more serum, she's the one with accumulated death flags but I honestly don't see anyone dying until the manga ends.</br></br></br>  <br>Until now I would have agreed but meeting all of these characters is new territory.</br></blockquote>]
