It wasn't a huge hit, but it wasn't a flop by any means.<br><br>Just because they're a business doesn't mean that they focus on just doing what makes them the most money.<br>They refused to make third season of K-On and made Tamako Market instead because that's what they wanted to do, and then after piss poor sales even gave Tamako Market a movie, too.<br><br>Kyoani made this anime because they liked the original story. There is no reason to assume they won't adapt the rest of it just because it didn't sell as much as Free.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kazuki sucks.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mWO<wbr>uUdymjeI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Kazuki <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>A happy buchou is life.</br>  <br>Haruka sweated and worried a lot more than everyone else in the band to make it work.

I'm not even a /u/fag and they don't even have to end up together, but it's gonna bug me if all that shit amounts to straight up yuribait.<br> my hopes aren't high </br></br>  It would of been better without the bait. Also why does /a/ have to start shit. Just give it a rest already its annoying.  <br>Since you seem new I'll be nice enough to tell you that KyoAni never ever does explicit canon gay. You either get subtext or shitty bait.</br>  I'll admit this anime original shit with Shuichi concerns me. I hope the final episode is all about music and the band celebrating their win.  <br>maybe I just have those hopes because the last kyoani show I watched was chu-2</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;&gt;ANIME ORIGINAL SHIT </br>  <br>How does it concern you?</br>   No ZR <br> No twintails <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>  College Rin a cute.

How many times do you think Shirou creampies her daily? Why is her route the only pairing that makes my blood boil? I can't help but feel like it's straight NTR if it's not Saber or Sakura, despite me hating Sakura.  <br>Multiple times daily. They are fucking like rabbits.</br>  <br> That post <br> That picture <br>Jesus Christ, fucking triggered.</br></br></br>  what is she 4? good thing she got rid of twintails since that ponytail was glorious    <br>She gradually loses her tsun along with her twintails.<br>By the time she drops the sidetail she'll be full deredere.</br></br>  <br>That's the script what are you fucking griping about?</br>  <br>The fact that is the classical picture you see in NTR doujins. Smug as fuck manly dude fondling the doe eyed slut in front of him.</br>  <br>Jesus anon you have issues</br>  <br>I have never seen such a thing in an NTR doujin, ever.<br>In the first place, 90% of NTR doujins about about blacks and old men, not manly individuals.</br></br>  <br>How is that anything close to NTR when they're a couple?<br><br>I guess it would kind of be NTR for Sakura, I guess?</br></br></br>  This epilogue was too much  <br>Oh fuck.</br>  <br>Usually blacks, and usually, along with the blacks, big buff faceless guys. Also, I don't know how you could miss it. I stray as far away from NTR as possible, yet I've seen many images of either panels or art with that kind of stuff. It's either that or a girl being fucked/opening her cum filled mouth holding up the double peace sign. <br><br><br>It's not. I'm just saying it looks like it and that I feel like being with Rin is wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I gotta do all the work around here.</br>  <br> I feel like being with Rin is wrong. <br><br>But it's oh so right.</br></br></br>  <br>It actually really bothers me how much this bothers me. I don't fucking get it. Because I actually like Rin and I didn't feel this way back when I read the VN. I felt it was off, but not like this.</br>  season 3 when?  <br>Nasu's too busy playing Dark Souls to write it.<br><br>We're gonna get a Clock Tower drama CD, at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Would be more effective if it was slowed down just a bit</br>   Shirou and Rin live in London <br> they haven't been beheaded <br>immersion ruined</br></br>  <br> this distortion </br>  <br><br>Japanese are a bit harder to culturally enrich than Britbongs.</br></br>  <br>Nothing of what that bald nazi said is actually wrong</br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded? Please tell me pic unrelated. Apart from the other three pictures, the first one is completely true. Race mixing makes you lose what both sides had.</br>  Was i really the only one that thought that they fuck right there?  no kissing of course, only hardfuck   <br>Classroom sex is best sex</br>  <br>It's clumsy and uncomfortable as fuck, it's as overrated as beach sex.</br>  <br>Speaking from experience anon?</br>  <br>/pol/ pls.</br>  <br> beach sex. <br>I never understood this. It always seemed like a stupid as fuck idea with no appeal to it.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Shirou and Rin live in London <br>Pfft, the animators have confirmed that they know nothing about London.<br><br>It feels much dirtier and greasy and busy and filled with people than was animated.<br><br>Also, you can't take a bus out like that into the countryside... Unless you want to ride for nearly two hours.<br><br>The countryside DOES look like England's home counties though, I'll give them that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a grown up woman now. time to get rid of the cute and look intelligent and sexy.</br>  <br> England <br><br>Oh, thank god</br></br></br>  <br>Is there a way to say yes without getting a shitstorm of sarcastic replies and bullshit claims?</br>  <br> side ponytail <br> intelligent </br></br>  <br>Here is your reply.</br>  <br> A real world location is idealized in fiction <br>Gee this is fucking new</br></br>  <br><br><br>You guys notice how they pan out from the house and just show london going into dusk and then evening?

Shirou looks ok but Luvia looks like some abomination.</br>  <br>Stylistic choice. Side mouths just sort of exist in the UBWverse.</br>  <br>I demand to see the full body shot of Rider please.</br>  <br>Here it is mang</br>  <br>It's the same as any kind of outdoor sex, assuming you're not being retarded and actually fucking on the sand.</br>  <br>Oh, I get it. The NTR material you read is basically vanilla stories with a 3rd wheel pointlessly added in to create the "NTR".</br>  <br>why are you watching troll subs?</br>  Guess I'll post this here.<br><br> I began by thinking that #25's script was "mostly original, so I should write this as a side story to the original [the VN] story." <br>And so I, Kinoko, was at my wits end trying to write something approximating a screenplay.<br><br> That's right. You know what I mean. In other words, I bit off more than I could chew again. Fuck! <br><br> Thus we drastically cut the parts that weren't needed for an anime... but the generous people at Aniplex said, "It would be a waste if all of your Nasu-san's work was cut, so let's include it as a special in the second box set." <br>Those of you interested in what was cut (Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine, etc.) should check out the second box set.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I fucked up the green text. Oops.<br><br>Anyway, Nasu cut some stuff in 25. Expect it on the BDs.</br></br></br>    <br>her eyes are too apart.</br>  <br>So you're saying the only thing that was cut was some luvia exposition?<br><br>Fuck that, give me some London SOL</br></br></br>  <br>The drama CD that's coming out with the BDs is confirmed to essentially be just that.</br>   memefetish waifufags getting BTFO when their girl is redesigned into a proper woman   <br>Oh shit. Maybe on the BDs.</br>  <br> pan out <br> transition to night <br> oh god its happening <br> construction noises </br></br></br></br>  <br>11/10 How to make a great episode better.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I tried. Had to upload to /gif/ for it to work though.<br><br><a href="http://i.4cdn.org/gif/1435491709543.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/gif/1435491709543<wbr>.webm</wbr></a><br><br>Warning, contains  sound. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice.

Is the bgm the same as the h scene from the vn?</br>  <br>True, but I'm working under file size constraints</br>  <br>Ah true.</br>  He's pounding her medulla oblongata until she goes down.  <br>you engage in sexual activities at the beach when suddenly a shark appears and eats you. risky</br>  <br>Sharks are pussies.</br>  <br>Ufo makes the men look far better than women</br>  <br> No Tsun <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>      Half of me wanted this "having fun in london' so much.<br>The other half, the Sakurafag one, hated it.<br><br>i fucking hope they will not mess the HF movies.</br></br></br>  <br>Normally Tsunderes are suppose to grow out of being tsun. Yeah I know shits weird.</br>  So do you think Shirou fucks up as much as Archer or do you think he's going to succeed going down Archer's path since he had a huge head start?  <br> Oh boy, just look at that shonen protagonist with his cute devoted girlfriend, it's totally asuna and kirito all ver again <br> She even has the same haricut </br></br>  <br>it's funny how he threats her like a cat, specially considering how she's pretty much one</br>  <br>It's confirmed a long time ago that Shirou does not become Archer in any of the routes.</br>  <br>But why was he combating ISIS then? How you think Archer got his tan? I bet he's getting über stressed and hence white hair.</br>  So what injustice is Shirou fighting?  Twintails Rin was pretty mediocre.<br>She looks better now.<br><br><br>Also, Pantyhose&gt;ZR</br></br></br></br>  <br>The tan and white hair are apparently because of overuse of his magic. By, "not becoming Archer" Nasu means not being the bitter CG, Shirou still wants to be a hero.<br><br>I'm sure he'll fight in actual geopolitical wars but in the Nasuverse there is plenty to do that involves only mages, just look at Kiritsugu or KnK with Araya/Cornellius.</br></br></br>  <br>You are mediocre.</br>  <br>By overusing magic and diving into nuclear reactors.</br>  <br> vlcsnap </br>  <br>The video that comes from is utterly hillarious.<br> Fighting the jews on the spirit-plane </br></br>  <br> Nothing goes over ripped pantyhose to have sex. </br>  <br>That is her adult design.</br>  <br>I'm not sure which I like better,<br> Both are better than twintails </br></br>  So UBW Shirou doesn't get tanned? He surpasses Archer but he is still a ginger.  CUTE  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br> No attempt to play off a gentler fate for Sakura <br>ha ha</br></br>  <br>He will get tanned if he overuses Projection.</br>  <br>  &gt;She even has the same haricut <br>No, she hasn't. Take a better look.</br></br>  <br>Get out, normie.</br>  <br><br>samefag</br></br>  <br>I wondered if this was serious, until I saw the Under Armour logo in the fourth panel.</br>  <br>So he is not overusing it in UBW because he has Tohsaka back up?</br>   I raped you repeatedly and now you're feeding me apples and caring for me <br> I threatened to rape your sister and fondled her thighs and she still risked her life and saved me from a horrible abomination <br> fucking Tohsaka women </br></br>  <br>Because Commiefags believe typesetting and humor is more important than the actual content.</br>  <br>She finally looked attractive after 2 cours of looking like shit. Twintails looked terrible on her.</br>  <br>Their babies are going to be so cute.</br>  <br>Because they don't make her look sassy or cute. They make her look like the star of a low-budget porno.</br>   all these pantyhose bros ITT   <br>REMOVE MISS GORILLA</br>  <br>Twintails are shit.</br>  <br>We need more SakuraxShinji.</br>  <br>REMOVE DRILLS</br>   Saber gets a eternal lover that accomplishes all he wanted <br> Rin gets a husbando that surpasses Archer on the same ideal <br> Sakura gets a doll that dropped his ideals for a life of mediocrity </br></br>    <br>Oh boy. I have like 5 episodes of Fate/SN to watch, i hope theres good leg service of rin in the latest ep.</br>    <br>How the fuck are they moving at servant level?</br>  This was too cute  <br>Supplex &gt; Punch in the medulla oblongata.</br>  <br>Enhanced by magic. The same way Kuzuki did it.</br>  <br>It can almost loop.</br>  <br> two people in anime are dating! SAO ripoff! </br>  <br>Shirou even fought with swords.</br>  <br>Since when could you reach servant level from enhanced with magic?</br>  <br>Since always. Kuzuki beat Saber with it and Rin beat Medea.</br>  <br>Why do I get the feeling that this would be a great banner for 4chan?</br>  <br>Dual wielding at times too!</br>  <br><br>Rin beat the shit out of Caster, who has the strength of ten men, the durability of twenty men, and the speed and reflexes of thirty men, by using magic reinforcement. That means, since forever. <br><br>The problem isn't attaining Servant level physical abilities - even Kotomine can reinforce himself enough to be able to fight defensively against True Assassin. The problem is that just having physical abilities on the same tier as Servants does not make you equally capable as them in terms of fighting skills, experience, special and unique abilities like Prana Burst or Medea's ability to cast magic from the Age of the Gods, and worst of all, you still have no Noble Phantasm. <br><br>That's why a single Servant can easily take on dozens of modern magi without breaking a sweat.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not actually Servant level, but self-reinforcement is still an obscenely good buff.</br>  I need to catch up but I hear it gets boring with the dialogues. This series adaptations need work with that.  <br>I love how calm Luvia is compared to Rin.</br>  <br>Calm Lady outside, fucking tiger in the bed. Luvia is great</br>  <br> I love how better Luvia is compared to Rin. <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>EMIYA, GET AWAY FROM THAT HARLOT IMMEDIATELY.<br>COME TO MY ARMS!</br></br>  It was brief, but Shirou and Shiki were so close to meeting.  <br><br>How would you rank their buffed abilities?<br><br>Well it did seem like they were.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Luvia looks much younger.</br>  that's because Luvia is being a youthful maiden instead of a slappy sourpuss  <br>Rin is old and busted.</br>    <br><br>I would say a properly reinforced human would hit somewhere around E rank in all physical stats. There's some potential for variation since an individual's strength, endurance, etc. can be higher or lower than others, so it may be possible for some to reach D rank in some stats if they're swole as fuck or quick as hell for a human. That would give them stats good enough to put up a fight against Servants in very specific situations (Kotomine chasing Zouken while guarding from Assassin, Rin catching Medea off guard with kung fu) while some like Bazett can actually go toe-to-toe with weaker Servants and win (though a lot of that is thanks to Fragarach).</br></br>  <br>I just realized that Luvia's hair/eye color is the reverse of Shirou's.<br>SHE IS THE CHOSEN ONE.</br></br>  <br>So top tier mages can reach weak servant levels in terms of physical stats. Never thought about it this way, I thought didn't have any hope of matching one and the reason Kirei matched Assassin was because he was just that bad.</br>  <br>I thought that was Gil, and I thought Luvia was suppose to have yellow eyes like in prisma.</br>  This is now a Luvia thread.  <br>Physical stats are meaningless.<br>True Assassin has better physical stats than Shirou!Saber.</br></br>  So now that its over do we have to retire the dense Shirou jokes? He was awkward but nothing remotely like the DEEN version.  <br>A magical girl fueled by dark energy always has red eyes and blonde hair. That is the rule.</br>    <br> ufotable in charge of drawing noses </br>  <br>Shero and Luvia are soul mates. Once Rin dies in the hero business she will take over.</br>  <br>Was he not?</br>  <br> True Assassin has better physical stats than Shirou!Saber. <br>Yeah that never made sense. I guess Excalibur and instinct is just that good.</br></br>  <br> anime in charge of drawing noses  <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>No stats just mean absolutly nothing.<br>Also "skill" isn't a stat.</br></br>  <br>The translator was the dense one.</br>  <br>This was a translation error. "Right" should be just or moral.</br>  <br>All women have to grow out of twintails at some point.</br>  <br><br>there is nothing wrong with that second example assuming he is using a different meaning of right</br></br>  <br>Then what is correct?</br>  <br>Nope, just this one show. By the same studio with a better alternative available.</br>  <br>DEEN made a joke of his character.</br>  <br> Sandy vagina </br>  <br>How is this image a profile shot?</br>  Isn't Sakura still having fun with the worms? It just kept bugging me with the happy lovey-dovey scenes in the last episode.<br><br><br>It's a more grown up look. I rike it.</br></br></br>  <br> THAT gif </br>  <br>ISIS.</br>  <br>Nah. I read a lot of ntr and even more mindbreak. And I'd say ntr has like 51% douche bag faceless youngsters (old fat hobos may come later but they don't count) and mind break is probably foreigners in general and with blacks there too.</br>  <br>I think Zouken dies shortly after Fate/UBW.</br>  <br>Nope.<br>He is forever known as the stupid, dense MC.</br></br>    <br>The KnK movies also did away with noses as they went on. I'm not sure if this applies to any other stuff Ufotable's done animation for, like God Eater and Tales. Maybe they just really love perpendicular triangles.</br>  <br> Isn't Sakura still having fun with the worms? <br>Yes but is not like Zouken has long to live anyways.</br></br>  <br>Blacks are rare as fuck in doujins ad NTR is no exception.</br>  <br>Because twin tails&gt;side tail and thigh-highs&gt;pantyhose.</br>  <br>see<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br> yellow eyes <br>But that's wrong.</br></br>  <br>It won't matter. It lives on forever.</br>  <br>Its gentle as she could hope for in that route.<br><br>Zouken no longer has any chance at the grail and probably dropped her training entirely as a result, Shinji no longer treats her like utter shit, and she might even have the worms removed eventually when Zouken either kills himself or switches focus to a new plan.<br><br>It could be far, far, far worse.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>white privilege</br>  <br><br>Like I said, you could take a hundred modern magi and throw them at an average Servant and the Servant would come out on top 9 times out of 10. It's about the difference in skill and experience and unique abilities, as well as the lack of a Noble Phantasm on the side of the magi. Though it also does deserve to be mentioned that not all magi have the capability to harm a spiritual being, either - it's the same with how not all Dead Apostle Ancestors would have the tools required to eliminate a Servant and how not all Servants would have the tools required to eliminate a Dead Apostle Ancestor. Servants do get a significant bonus against real living beings in the sense that they can harm humans just fine, while humans have to have a weapon or spell capable of targeting spirits to be able to harm them in return. <br><br>Kotomine, for example, would only be able to kill a Servant by using up around ten Command Spells at once to power his magecraft up. Otherwise, the best he could do was stall True Assassin by trapping his shadow with his Black Keys. <br><br>Rin, on the other hand, is such a proficient magus that she can cast spells capable of harming spirits as well as real things, like the attack she used on Berserker to melt his face into slag. <br><br>Shirou is lucky that he can project Noble Phantasms, because they can naturally harm spiritual beings like Servants without any additional fuss.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about?</br>  <br>Exactly what it sounds like. I get to do whatever the fuck I want because I have a lot of connections in high places, so I live a very privileged life</br>    <br>My sides have pierced the heavens</br>  <br>Go shitpost somewhere else.</br>  <br>Nah<br><br>(In other words, I have a lot of friends who are actual, real Jews who actually know how to do this kabbalah stuff)<br><br>So uh, guys, you'd better stop trying to fuck with me, because all that's gonna happen is I'll rape you some more</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Perfect</br>  <br>Why is she wearing a torn up swimsuit?<br>Is she poor?</br></br>  <br><br> Yellow eyes <br>Did UFO mess up or what?</br></br></br>  <br>It may be one of those alien skin suits from Spiderman, you know like Venom and Carnage, etc</br>  <br>Terrible color for her, and the design is garishly gaudy.</br>    <br>Oh, of you want some added realism to make people panic and spill all their secrets, call it sentient flesh-eating bacteria :D</br>  <br>If Shirou isn't a good mage to enhance his body how did he keep up with servants?</br>  <br>or some kind of sentient version of mad cow disease :D :D :D <br><br>oh my god this is amazing</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't this a coloring error?</br>  <br>Logical correct, morally wrong.</br>  <br>I want to grab those hips.</br>  Alright, now here's my biggest secret of all. Watch me "escape" from this "prison" they put me in <br><br>hheehehehehehe</br></br>  Is creayus the most dedicated and loyal artist?  As in not being able to draw anything else other than CC?  I don't know, but I am thankful to have a constant stream of good quality art of my waifu  Well, there's always Mogudan...  Creayus is a hero who keeps C.C. alive in our hearts.  I dunno, but C.C. is the most dedicated and loyal waifu. Lulu earned that shit.  NEVER GONNA STOP    <br>That hand's not nearly noodly enough.</br>   I want to see what Creayus looks like in real life. I have a feeling she is attractive enough   This picture makes my heart doki more than her usual offerings for some reason    Wow he's still making art of her to this day? I would really like to see some more C.C., <br><br>Her and Lelouch really made the series, the Akihito bullshit is stupid as fuck and it better end up explaining where C.C. and Lelouch ended up going in the end to make happy little babies.</br></br>  <br>too bad a died a virgin eh</br>  <br>Hands, feet and pussy is excellent. Not a fatty.</br>    <br> died <br>Your bait is overdone anon.</br></br>    <br>not bait if it's the truth.<br>Meanwhile C.C is free to fuck whoever she wants. Suzaku might even be lucky whenever she gets horny only if he wears Zero outfit</br></br>  Lelouch and C.C. are the truest OTP.  <br> Suzaku might even be lucky whenever she gets horny only if he wears Zero outfit <br>She's a wanted fugitive though. She is 100% complicit in Lelouche's "crimes".</br></br>  <br> implying they won't do it secretly </br>  <br>Her face looked pretty good in that one cosplay pic she posted.</br>  <br> you will never live an immortal life with an immortal waifu who constantly teases you while desperately loving you to death at the same time </br>  nah, we've got ark for that with all his morrigan art<br><br>[no pic, google it. last time i posted any on this christian image board, though, it was a ban]</br></br>  <br> giving your waifu a larger chest than the one she has <br>We need feminism because of this.</br></br>  <br>Orange is also 100% complicit in Lelouche's crimes and he owns an orange farm with pink knight.</br>  <br>I dunno, but C.C. as my waifu makes me feel like i can take over the world. Guess this is how lulu felt.</br>  <br>That guy is still going? Damn, what a fucking champ. Truly dedicated to his waifu.</br>  <br> his <br>Her.</br></br>  <br>sugoi<br>I haven't fapped to rin in awhile<br><br> I think its time to bust a nut to this picture. </br></br></br></br>  <br> rin <br>sorry I ment rei</br></br>  <br>Does he even do shit anymore?<br><br>God tier artist but I feel like he hasn't done a doujin in years</br></br></br>  old game<br><br>Mai wear</br></br>  <br>CC is one of those anime heroines that just oozes sexual dominance. And there's nothing you can do that will ever surprise her.</br>  <br>I'd imagine that if you live as long as CC does, you get to see pretty much everything.</br>  <br> And there's nothing you can do that will ever surprise her. <br>That immortality isn't just for show, she probably invented most of the positions we use today</br></br>  <br>You just wonder what kind of kinky shit she did with Marianne and Charles.</br>  <br>Nah. Charles was VV's waifu</br>  <br>Her thumb...</br>  <br>vv loved chuck, but not the other way around</br>  <br>Why do Charles and his sons hate their Nii-sans?</br>  <br>...Is behind the rest of her hand. No problem there.</br>  What would sex with C.C. be like? Is sex even fun to her?  <br>Humping a pizza, all slippery like.</br>  <br>Does it still count if it is OC?<br><br><br>I love that dude's art.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Slippery sex is the best, no?</br>  <br>Ohh, I like this one.</br>  <br>Season 3 when?<br>Didn't anybody notice CC praying and giving Lelouch her immortality?</br></br>  <br>10th anniversary of Geass is next year and there are rumors about the announced movie in 2012 being a retelling of R2, but who knows.</br>    I want to marry the Creayus.  <br> wanting to chuck CC </br>  <br> implying Creayus isn't CC all the long just taking selfies </br>  <br> 10th anniversary of Geass is next year and there are rumors about the announced movie in 2012 being a retelling of R2, but who knows. <br><br>I think people shouldn't expect that since there is literally no information about that subject.</br></br></br>  <br>Anniversary of the series or anniversary of Lulu's death? I remember they did some memorial thing a year after Lelouch's death or so</br>  <br>If Lelouch is immortal he didn't get the code from her though.</br>  <br>The Geass series obviously</br>    In the six hour since I'e checked this thread, she's already posted three new images. What a lady.  <br>It wouldn't be surprising if it's just something like Suzaku's counterattack. An animation project of Oz or something would be cool</br>    Kallen &gt; C.C  <br>stop starting waifu war shit both are great</br>    <br><br>She's still an active character in the OVAs</br></br>          <br> the Akihito bullshit is stupid as fuck and it better end up explaining where C.C. and Lelouch ended up going in the end to make happy little babies. <br> Akito takes place before the events of R2 <br><br>Seriously Anon, even if you don't like it, it's easy to just read the fucking wiki.</br></br></br></br>         This thread <br>Man, I love creayus.</br>    She speaks pretty good English too.  <br>No, anon. That's Japanese.</br>  Creayus is CC after all.  i love this thread.      <br>We know you're here creayus, stop hiding already.</br>      <br><br>Wait, creayus is female?</br></br>  <br>Creayus is  C.C. </br>  <br><br>Why didn't they have her wear this outfit more in the show?</br></br>  <br>Now I want to see CC in a plug-suit...</br>  Speaking of dedication...  <br>Yeah, you can tell if you use translate on her twitter. She did a cosplay of pic related but it seems like she's deleted the image.</br>    <br>I... That is.... Well, um....<br><br>Fapping now.</br></br></br>      <br> Implying he didn't die <br>He clearly died, just like Charles died before the Code took effect and revived him.</br></br>  <br>Does anyone happen to have that one saved? It's gonna really bug me knowing it's the one image missing from my folder.</br>  <br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gNh<wbr>yzoq4mxo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Lelouch lives.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First of all, that's fake.<br><br>Second of all did you even read what I said? I said Lelouch died like Charles did, before being revived by the code.</br></br></br>  <br> First of all, that's fake. <br>No.</br></br>   having a waifu who has canonically taken innumerable dicks, none of which were yours <br><br>How do you CCfags justify it?</br></br>    <br>It was confirmed to be fake.<br><br>First of all the art is shit and looks nothing like sunrise animation if you even bother to look at it.<br>Second of all it never aired in Japan.<br>Third it was confirmed to not be in any DVD/Blu-ray releases, which is where people said it was from or some shit after it was shown to have not aired in Japan.</br></br></br></br></br>  Only good thing about Akito  <br>Are you really falling for it?</br>  <br> Having a waifu who knows countless ways to pleasure you <br><br>I don't see the problem, really.</br></br></br>  New episode when? Was it not supposed to be released a couple of days ago?  <br> I was only pretending to be retarded </br>  <br> becoming you're waifu <br>Now that's doing it right.</br></br>  MORE PORN  <br>I fucking love the Alexander.</br>  <br>It's not bait.</br>    Creayus is amazing, but when you think about it, if anybody deserves eternal devotion and art, it's CC      <br> symmetry <br> black-white contrast <br>Simply the best.</br></br></br>    <br>Goddamnit <br> It looks like she's spreading shit out of her ass </br></br>    CC and Lulu is probably the best OTP of any series  (besides ichiruki )  <br>How can you say you love if you won't even eat her shit?</br>      <br>CC still enjoys the earthly pleasures so sex would probably still feel good. The fact that she can still regenerate means that she'll never get fucked to the point of boredom.</br>  <br>Does she regenerate her hymen everytime?</br>    <br>I don't know. It actually feels like if she didn't, I'd be feeling weird about it, like "What's wrong with this eternally hot 500 year old woman? Why the fuck is she a virgin? Something wrong with her?" kinda thing.</br>  <br>The dance seen with the shaking boobs was good too.</br>  <br>She probably no longer has a hymen. She had years of using the Love Me Geass until she got killed. I don't think she reverted back to her virgin self.</br>  <br><br>My first thought as well.</br></br>        <br>Actually I think the guy who posted the youtube video is just a summerfag.</br>  <br><br>I'm sure that's great and all if you ignore that her Geass destroyed her ability to love</br></br>  <br>I've always dreamed of what being Rei in Mogudans doujins would feel like.</br>  <br> her Geass destroyed her ability to love <br>The fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  <br>Sorta.</br>  <br>Her Geass was all about getting loved by all. After so much love shown to her, she grew numb to that emotion.</br>    <br><br>until she met Lulu</br></br>   2015年 物語シリーズ ファイナルシーズン『終物語』（コンテ） <br>Animator Kazui Hiroko reveals that it airs in 2015.<br><br>http://kazuihiroko.jp/history.html</br></br></br>  And what about Kizu?  I'm starting to get burned out with monogatari. How many novels are left to animate?   Still waiting for commie   <br>You'd think the name suggests something but of course it's not the last one.</br>  Still no Kizu.<br>I'm not bothering until I can watch it.</br>  <br>Koyomi<br>Owari<br>Zoku owari</br></br></br>  <br>is this sequel of Oremonogatari?</br>  <br>It's a spinoff of Owari no Seraph.</br>  <br>And the prequel, Kizu</br>  You just know there is gonna be a giant ass collection that includes all the books and the anime for an exorbitant price.  <br>It'll probably be one of the biggest BD releases in the history of anime. Similar to that one TTGL release. It's probably going to sell out too.</br>  <br>everything  except for kizu </br>  <br>but it's just about to get good man. Tsukimono was utter shit, but Owari is GOAT.</br>   still no kizu <br>Well, at least it's something.</br>  <br> off by one from a palindrome </br>  <br>I got dubs anyway. Can't wait to tell my mom, she will be proud as fuck.</br>  <br><br>Sweet</br></br>  Good keep pressing and get this shit over with already. Its long since worn out its welcome and getting it done and all possible money made should convince them enough is enough  <br> mfw they decide to animate kuzi last <br>At this pace I wouldn't be surprised if it gets released 202X</br></br>   skipping Koyomimonogatari  <br><br>why?</br></br>  im still on fucking nise slow down fam  <br>Its been years nigga</br>  <br>and all the future ones nisio is yet to release</br>  But SHAFT already animated Kizu  <br>The novels are ongoing and will most likely continued to be animated for at least 5 or 6 years.</br>  <br>No, fuck you where's Koyomimonogatari</br>  <br>It's not like they've ever given a fuck about the novels' release order.</br>  <br><br><br>What happens in it?</br></br></br>  <br>alot</br>  <br>They are just a bunch of short stories of Araragi and all the girls he have met, but the sories are a little after he meets teh girl, for instance Koyomi Flower is with Senjougahara before they were a couple.<br>The important thing about Koyomi is that the last chapter is important for what happen next because  Gaen "Kills him" and we don't know what happens next until Owari Vol. 2 , If they animate Owari Vol. 1 it's okay I guess</br></br>  <br> The novels wrapped up for now as far as I understand. I know the guy teased he'd write more but time will tell if that's just a gag or not. Personally i still think it wore out its welcome quite a while ago but I could say the same for a lot of light novel trash</br>   Still no Kizu <br>FFFFFFFUUUUUUCK YOU SHAFT</br>  <br>Bakemonogatari aired 6 years ago<br>How much longer until the series is over? It's kind of sad to think we're near the end.</br></br>  <br>Kazui Hiroko is the one who storyboarded that. She may be implying something there too.</br>  <br>No Kizu until 2020.</br>  <br>I'm glad it's still going actually<br><br>SHAFT could've stopped after Bake but I think they love it too much. Also money.</br></br></br>    <br> I'm glad it's still going actually <br><br>Same, it's nice to have a story that might actually get completely adapted. The endless 1-2 season adaptations and then learn to read Japanese or never see the rest of the story do get annoying.</br></br></br>  <br> The endless 1-2 season adaptations and then learn to read Japanese or never see the rest of the story do get annoying. </br>  <br>Isnt the time to start laughing 379 days away still?</br>  <br>I'll give you an idea, Ian Flemming's James Bond novels spanned from around 1952 to his death in 1964 being written , it took the films from 1962 to 2006 to catch up.</br>    <br>Awesome, I'm a little disappointed if they don't adapt Koyomimonogatari but that's currently being translated so hopefully it won't be an issue.<br><br> The novels are ongoing <br>no they aren't</br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, tsuki was ok</br>  <br>Based shaft</br>    Who is ready to see Kiss Shot again?  <br>Nice. <br>We're talking about how much episode for this arc?</br></br>  <br>Confirmed.</br>   Numachi <br> Tadatsuru <br> Sodachi <br><br>Why would NisiO think it's a good idea to introduce characters at the end of a series?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll say 4-5 per arc: Ougi Formula, Sodachi Riddle, Sodachi Lost</br>  <br>I was thinking about it and it makes more sense to animate Koyomi between Owari vol. 2 and Owari vol. 3.</br>  <br>5-6 would be ideal.

That looks like a regular season instead of a new year's special.  <br>[Citation Required]</br>  <br>shit it's almost july already. why 2016 coming so fast</br>  <br>Sorry, I meant the book official localization.</br>  <br>Owarimonogatari = 12 episodes<br>Koyomimonogatari = special <br>Zokuowarimonogatari = special <br><br>They could easily finish the series as two cour show but I guess that's more profitable this way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Much appreciated.</br>  <br>Because he is a shitty writer who only writes boring dialogue?<br><br>He writes more dialogue in extreme detail that is NOT interesting and uncesserary. it shows not only in this but his other...well they are on the level on fanfiction, so his other fanfiction writing nonsense is on the same intellectual level. very low, only extremely stupid people would find anything worthy in his dialogue in the same way people found a RANDOM fucking artpiece "brilliant" and all because it was modern art.<br><br>So yeah, shaft is anoying with its BLOOM and repetitive anoying flash cards and quick cuts that are being done TOO MANY TIMES that the bad cgi(they were so cheap they didnt even write anything on the books, they could easely just copy paste some random text even, but nope too cheap, it looks like 1997 in terms of CGI with even more bloom)the only good thing about the series is some fanservice and the fact that dead characters stay dead in the bakemono universe, no matter what "its magic we dont have to explain shit"<br><br>This is mainly because its nisio isin's old enemy that trumps him at everytime, it trumped stephany meyer aswell. <br>Logic and reason. So all characters after episode 12 in bakemonogatari that appear dead are dead due to simple logic. And thank fucking god, the worst one was that pedophile who stole money from children, im glad he died, he was the most stupid one and deserved to die at the hands of one that he tricked. his family died aswell if we take, again, nisio's old enemy, logic and reason, that if someone did that, revenge by killing his family is acceptable. Unless you are someone against the death penalty that is.<br><br><br>I think araragi not killing him for tricking hitagi is the worst plothole yet, the only one more incompetent is his mother<br><br>Araragis mother is a POLICE OFFICER!yet she does not notice shit from all the injured people by those monsters?I mean holy shit.Im glad its over, thats the only good part of it,no more repetitive music either by shaft</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsukimono was utter shit <br><br>What the fuck?

I can't believe that we've tolerated those awful existing scans for so long.<br><br> Then again it seems like not many people have even heard of the manga. </br></br>        <br>how did her story end? did she marry the hotel manager?</br>  <br>Her story is not in the last chapter so probably not.</br>  <br>heh</br>      <br><br> I don't want to die <br> I wanna die </br></br></br>  Guess who stopped drawing porn like Reika Ootsuka recently  Is it implied in Episode 4 that if a god is forgotten they die, so he grants ANY wish so he stays remembered<br><br>or is it that they get power from wishes</br></br>  I like the bandana  <br> Is it implied in Episode 4 that if a god is forgotten they die, <br>It is outright stated in the manga and the plot of the upcoming second season.</br></br>  <br>it was stated but was only said once so briefly</br>  <br>in the 4th ep</br>  <br>is there a big difference in the dialogue of dubbed version compared to subbed?</br>  <br>Don't insinuate that I might know the dub.<br>That is offensive.</br></br>  <br>Excuse you I like to hear my own language.</br>  <br> Dub <br> DUB <br> D <br> U <br> B <br>EOPS.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Chitoge won?  <br><br>Are you an animeonlyfag?</br></br>  Nobody is even remotely close to winning in the manga and it makes me fucking sad.  <br> lets reuse that exact look we made for sasami-san for this scene </br>  When exactly did the manga enter the cashcow status?  worst girl always wins<br><br>so yes</br></br>  The only winners when it comes to Nisekoi are those that dropped it half an episode in and never thought about it again  <br>The only true winners are the ones who read the one shot while staying away from the serialization and adaptation. It actually was a good one shot.</br>  <br><br>you're kidding yourself if you don't think everything is currently lined up perfectly for Chitoge. there's literally no chance of it being anyone else</br></br>  <br>Sure buddy, whatever makes you sleep at night.</br>  <br> remotely close to winning in the manga <br>I'd have agreed with you up until the last 2 chapters. Any doubt over how Araraku feels about Chitoge is completely gone now.</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>What is it that makes her worst girl? I'm saying this as someone that wants to watch it but is curious why there's a lot of dislike for Chitoge.</br>  <br>Shitty tsundere.</br>  <br>Plenty of people like Chitoge. It's a harem story, so you have people in different camps that hate every other girls besides their favorite. Chitoge has been set up to win the whole thing since the oneshot, so you will see desperate Onoderafags shit post about here.</br>  <br>She is an archetypical neo-tsundere.</br>  <br>Ah, that's a shame as looking at her design that's the first blonde character I've ever seen in an anime I thought looked really cute.<br><br>From what little I know of it my guess is whomever is on the front cover, or media relating to advertising the most will win.<br><br>It's like thinking Toradora, Love Hina, or Golden Time would end any other way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Oooh, Neo-Tsundere, does that mean just the pissiness without punching the MC into the sky?</br>  <br> It's like thinking Toradora, Love Hina, or Golden Time would end any other way. <br>Toradora and Golden Time were not harem stories, though.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, sorry, I thought that straight after typing. I think Love Hina and Tenchi are the only harems I've watched.<br><br>But do you understand my sentiment of the advertising and such usually being indicative of a winner?</br></br></br>  <br> But do you understand my sentiment of the advertising and such usually being indicative of a winner? <br>While does prove to be true many times, I think that in the genre of harem that you should never doubt the writer's inability to make one girl actually win.</br></br>  <br> without punching the MC into the sky? <br>In Chitoge's case, literally no. Classical tsundere is where they stare off tsun and go dere, with no bipolar mood swings except maybe during the transition. Neo-anything just means new definition. So how we currently typically think of tsunderes would actually be neo-tsundere.</br></br>  It would appear that our MC is becoming self-aware... Real end of Nisekoi soon?  Oh Komi-sensei, you jester.  <br>He'll get amnesia and reset all his progress.</br>  <br>Remember Love Hina, but only keys?<br>Yeah.</br></br>  <br>List me a few examples, I want to read/watch a few and see if the change of winner seems like an ass pull.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, last Tsundere I seen was Ringo Oginome. I guess I try not to think of Tsunderes especially since Working.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hilarious that ever since that thread, Nisekoi threads have been dead as fuck. People really did drop it after that.</br>  <br><br>She's gonna win, yeah.</br></br>  <br> He'll get amnesia <br>HA! That will be good for a chapter or two, but amnesia rarely lasts in manga.</br></br>  <br>I like the way you think.</br>  <br><br>He already had amnesia once.<br><br>They were Chitoge chapters.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> people actually think this <br><br>lmao, just READ the mango Kosaki is a BEST</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Spoiler: The reason the 5 of them were all childhood friends in the first place wasn't just because of all the gang stuff. It's that they were all involved in an accident that hit them with a special poison that was developed by Claude.<br><br>Marika got the worst dose, which is why she's sickly all the time. <br><br>The promise to get married was with Onodera, the normal girl who just got caught up in the over the top police/mafia war, and it was a "You'll definitely live, we'll get married when we're grown up!" way.<br><br>The reason so many details about their childhood are foggy is that Chitoge, Raku, and Onodera were then given an amnesia drug to block out their memory of the illness once it went into remission. Marika and Yui still remember everything.<br><br>Series is going to end with Marika, then Yui, then Onodera dying, leaving Chitoge and Raku. Overwhelmed by sadness, they'll avoid each other for two years, then reunite and hold hands.<br><br>The End.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Chitoge doesn't win this will go down as one of the worst harem series to exist.  This whole season was nothing but Chitoge.<br>Chitoge, Chitoge, Chitoge.<br>When she's not being a violent gorilla, she's a bawling moeblob. Who cares?</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I wish we had 10 episodes of (worst) Onodera sweating for 20 minutes straight and playing with her disgusting rat tail</br></br>  Let us take a moment to appreciate perfection   in 3 years nisekoi writer catches a nippon cold and dies, plot still hasn't gone an inch forward   <br> Onodera sweating <br><br>It's extremely off-putting the amount of sweating she does. So gross.</br></br></br>  <br>So nobody misses it?</br>  <br> Series is going to end with Marika, then Yui, then Onodera dying <br><br>OK</br></br></br>  I just want S3 for animated fireworks. Or similar in relation to it. Finally getting Yui is fine too. S3 is overdoing it though, and don't really want to see such things stuffed into OVAs.  <br> nisekoi <br> anyone wining anytime soon </br></br>  <br> lmao, just READ the mango Kosaki is a BEST <br>But she is boring moeblob with ZERO development</br></br>  <br> lmao </br>  <br>Oh, let's do.</br>  <br>Best girl always wins.</br>    Is watching the tv version of the second season ok or do I wait for the BDs?  <br>you need an update</br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br><br>What are the chances for a Marika end?</br></br>  Chitoge was always the one<br> Sawsze in love means Forever in Love </br>  <br>Raku basically says in the last chapter he needs to stop leading her on and just reject her feelings already.</br>  <br>Marika a best</br>  <br>acording to the manga, I would say less that 10% (she's either kill or eventually leaving because of her health condition)<br>In the last chapter Raku said he needs to stop lying to her and be honest by saying he's not interested at all</br></br>  <br>She sweats more than the Colossal Titan</br>  <br>Last Chapter also confirms that the "Best friend" stuff was bullshit.</br>  <br>She never had a chance</br>  <br><br> manga panda </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>So it is true. Best girl always loses.</br></br></br></br>  <br> nothing but Chitoge. <br> Chitoge, Chitoge, Chitoge. <br>Because this manga is about False Love. The False Love turning into a true one.<br>  What if "Nisekoi" stands up for the "false love" Raku feels for Onodera? <br><br> implying that's a bad thing <br><br><br>You wrote "wins" wrong, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Giving Raku a crush from the very beginning (Kosaki) was a stupid idea for Harem Shenanigans: The Manga.  <br>I still have to watch this last episode but no, she didn't win unless SHAFT pulled an original ending (which I doubt because there would have been some shitstorm).<br><br>She'll win in the manga regardless.</br></br></br>  <br> I have a crush <br> my crush is not my true love <br> The girl I used to hate is the girl I fell in love with <br>We all know that's the scenario.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone that thought otherwise was delusional. It was always just Raku trying to justify his feelings in a way that wasn't romantic. Because he's swimming in a river in Africa. Onodera at this point is a strawman.</br>  <br>The episode was just like in the manga. She decided to give herself some time to get ready to confess.</br>  <br> streaming manga <br>Kill yourself my friend :)</br></br>  <br>Raku's already being forced to realize that he cares about Chitoge more than just a "best friend".

The flag is already rock solid!<br>Yui-nee knows that and even Marika knows it. The only one who has no idea and still thinks there's a chance is Chitoge</br></br>  <br>Wow, that's such a funny joke.

Did you even read the chapter weeks back?<br><br>Raku was for the first time willing to give up the pendant, which he treasures the most the whole time, just to fulfill the promise with Onodera, and she acted the same. They both finally said fuck it and moved on from 11 years ago.<br><br>On the other hand, Chitoge is still stuck in the whole childhood promise thing, thinking Raku will still fall for promised girl.<br><br>Besides, neither Chitoge nor Onodera was the girl Raku made the promise with. It was Yui.<br>But Yui gave the book away to Onodera because she knew Onodera was the one Raku truly liked back them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Raku doesn't give a shit about the promise girl anymore.
