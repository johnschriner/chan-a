There are 203 cards total but grammar is not vocab. To get the most out of that deck you are best off before reviewing a concept, to actually read through the concept as it is found in the DoBJG. On subsequent reviews it will help remembering bits of pieces of what you have read and stimulate those memories. By the time you have reviewed a fact/concept to the point of maturity it should feel, well, comfortable. This is obviously going to be compounded by general reading, etc. Digesting essentially the entire Basic volume of main entries in under 21 days might be rough depending on your schedule. It is probably fair to factor in around 23 hours worth of focused and attentive reading outside of the deck covering the concepts involved, give or take a few hours either side. <br>You aren't going to be able to recall everything in the notes which goes into the specifics for each grammar point, but subsequent focused reviews in Anki should help in stimulating the associations with what you've read in the dictionary entries and it will have a carry over effect in outside reading where you are going to be bombarded with a mesh of all of these concepts in high frequency. 90％ time spent reading the entires, 10% reviewing; 400% carry over benefit from maintaining reviews and this knowledge when being bombarded by these concepts in native material.<br><br><br> Shouldn't I also put 999 to "Ignore answer times longer than x seconds"? <br>I would. For that sort of deck time per card isn't really a useful function. Set it for as high as possible and as you say, allow time to revise the concept as it is illustrated in the formation and example sentences. <br><br>The graduating intervals are all set at Anki defaults. Before making any changes to them I would suggest looking into exactly what these defaults mean. The Anki manual online would be my first port of call. <br>http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html<wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Set your computer clock back 12 hours or something? who knows. <br>The preferred method is time travel.

Killua is fickle about lots of things, but his relationship with Gon is not really one of them.</br></br>  <br>I think it has to due to the rescue Alluka arc and Killua's mindset throughout the CA arc. In the manga Killua's minset is that he just wants to be the center of Gon's attention, and is upset that he isn't. <br><br>Then he goes off to rescue Alluka, and along the way he seems to forget about saving Gon and (or at least it becomes an afterthought). Saving Gon became a constellation prize. Made worse by the fact that he doesn't stick around for Gon to wake up, and then can't admit where he fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>*mindset</br>   All these 99fags coming out of the woodwork   Special delivery for /a/!  <br> oh noes, short hair, that's for boys, no way i could find that attractive <br>Who are you trying to convince?</br></br>  .o0O(Hmmmm, I'll just return that to sender.

Very nice and sweet, not a lot of banter, not a lot of gags, relatively predictable in conversation, just not a lot to capture my interest.</br></br>  <br><br>That was my point. Running gags make characters pretty predictable in general. If they fit one type to suit a routine.<br><br>She has wisdom and insight, which produces thought provoking conversations. And she works by using intelligence to get through things, like making Hitagi stop the silliness of keeping Araragi chained up in Nise with one sentence. It's fresher when a character works in a passive way, then employs an aggressive tactic. Same way she left the country to make Hitagi rely on Kaiki both to keep Gaen off her tail and to help Hitagi get over some issues.<br><br>She just doesn't overtly use any force or influence more than necessary. Notice how she is the only girl who actually fights her oddity head on, and Nisio made it so it was impossible to win alone, both with logic and tactics.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please reread what I wrote. For the most part, I agree with you, and the person I considered boring was Nadeko. In the mean time, my point is that you place too much good faith in Tsubasa. She's not that holy, and I really think that her actions were meant to make her parents suffer, because she does hate them as you said.</br>  Last day! After this thread I won't be making any more, but will still accept submissions if they happen to come my way when I'm still mixing. Thanks for all the positive response, anons.
