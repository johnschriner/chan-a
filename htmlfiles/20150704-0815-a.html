Over 21  <br>Lolis are for love.</br>    <br> I would watch women with big glamorous hair and sparkly dresses standing on the street outside our house. I had no idea what they were up to; I just thought they were shiny. As a little girl, all I ever wanted was to be shiny. <br><br> One day I asked my grandmother what the women were doing and she said, "Those women take their panties off and men give them money." And I remember saying to myself, "I'll probably do that" because a man had already been taking my panties off. <br><br> Fucking Google at it again. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why isn't my food captcha in color?</br>  I want to be mercilessly bullied by a precocious loli.  creamed  fertilized    <br>raped with a big black cock of death.</br>  <br>There will never be a h-game as perfect as that one</br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>why don't you ask google-sensei?</br>  <br>kek</br>    <br><br> There is only one way to be free from it. <br>That is to have a sexual intercourse and inject the seed of desire into the vagina.<br><br>Sounds interesting.</br></br></br></br></br>  Loved, of course.  <br>Why is Akatsuki so fucking ugly?</br>  <br>reminder that through the years she has had 5 different fathers</br>  <br>Lovingly bullied.</br>  I like my lolis conquering the world.

Unless we got Shanks in there   Half of the crew after Big Mom <br> Taking out Doflamingo sets Kaido on their asses <br><br>Are we potentially walking into a Yonko vs Yonko vs Strawhat fight?</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127533583 <br>no, now you fuck off since this is a normal thread with a normal topic</br>  Crocodile flashback when  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  <br>Potentially yes, but I have a hard time seeing the Strawhats taking on one half of the yonko at the same time, regardless of their new pirate allies. Even with Shank's help, it's still looking pretty ugly.</br>  <br>I hope not cause that would introduce a fuck ton of more side characters who probably won't be relevant because they're just enemies. And the Dressrosa side characters would get shafted.</br>  <br><br>Croc and Daz were on their way to do SOMETHING so hopefully soon. I really need to see Croc getting Sanji'd in Kamabakka <br><br>also stop giving me new ships, I dont need to ship a dead man</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of see Big Mom becoming an ally. If Lola IS Mom's daughter, then Sanji-tachi are probably already chilling with her</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>and Shachi!</br>  <br>He was a good father indeed.</br>  <br>0%<br><br>it took gear fourth to beat doflamingo and that's only because doflamingo had no active way of harming luffy while he was in that mode. Had there been any sort of help for doflamingo on that island the strawhats were toast.<br><br>Look at what Doflamingo was working with. It was literally him and a bunch of liabilities vs the world</br></br></br></br></br>  I'll try my best.  these threads really should be limited to release day <br>this shit is just annoying</br>  Damn today is Nami's birthday<br><br>someone remember that for the next OP</br></br>  <br>release day is the worst day. <br><br>It's just a by product of summer. People like to pretend it doesn't get worse in the summer but it does.</br></br></br>  <br>then I will post Nami</br>  <br> implying tripfags like you are not part of the problem </br>  <br>I am not. I only talk about One Piece and I have been reading longer than most of you have been alive.</br>  <br>Fuck no, release day threads are the worst of all because cancer from everywhere swarms to the threads and everything is crawling with plebbits, tumblerinas and people who are not even reading the manga and just want to shitpost.</br>  <br>and this is better?</br>  <br>Holy fuck, I want those</br>  <br>*tips fedora*</br>  <br>we are still in the post release day period, the threads will stay shitty like that until sunday</br>  What do you anons think about new SBS. I found 2 really interesting stuff.<br><br> D: I have a question for Odacchi. In "The White City", chapter 762 of volume 76, during the scene where Law stabs Cora-san, I found Crocodile printed on the paper Cora-san was reading. <br><br>So what was that article about? P.N. Yamamoto・Sugiyama・Hori<br><br>O: Yes. I'm quite impressed you found this one~. As you've pointed out, if you look really closely, you can find Crocodile there.<br><br>This was from the time when Law was 10 and Doflamingo was 25; 16 years ago from now. Crocodile was 30 at the time.<br><br>Similar to Luffy, back when he was young, Crocodile's name spread across the seas with incredible momentum, but soon after he was admitted into the Shichibukai in around his mid-20s, he tried to fight Whitebeard and and was completely and utterly crushed by him.<br><br>Though he seemingly tamed down at this point, his eyes became set on the kingdom of Alabasta, and it happened to be precisely during this time period that he was being featured in the papers as a hero who hunted down pirates. In other words, that was an article reporting the acts of heroism by Crocodile at the time!<br><br>This tells us a little bit more about Crocodile while he was still in adventure mode</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is it so hard for you to just post without a name and trip?</br>  <br>And this one<br>D: The one who was with Barrels the pirate called "Dorry" was X Drake, captain of the Drake pirates, right?! It struck me when I saw the name "Diez", found the scar on his chin, and discovered that he comes from the sea of the North.<br><br>So does that mean that Barrels is Drake-san's father? from Kobe Prefecture, Kazuki-kun<br><br>O: Yes, that's correct!! Well done with your findings.<br><br>X Drake, along with Luffy and the others, is a member of the youthful "Worst Generation" of pirates that stirred up a great deal of commotion around the world. His father, Barrels, used to be a Marine Officer and Drake admired this, dreaming of becoming a great Marine just like him one day. However; who knows what happened, but his father suddenly turned into a pirate and became a terrible man who would physically abuse even his own son. Drake, who still believed in his past father and followed him around was aged 19 at this time (13 and a half years ago). Though that's a bit too old to be calling him a boy, he probably seemed to look a lot younger while he was weakened with the fear of his father. Later, he fatefully crossed paths with Law, and the Marines soon took custody of him, leading Drake to become a Marine. The thing is, as if resigning himself to fate, after Drake made his way all the way up to becoming a Rear Admiral in the Marines, he ended up leaving the navy and becoming a pirate himself!!<br><br>Just what happened? What's he thinking? Hey, you!! ---come onnnnnn.<br><br>I'm interested in seeing the future of Drake, who has also made an appearance in a cover series!!<br><br>So this almost certainly confirms that next Supernova we will get to know better is X Drake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Law turned way more interesting than he first seemed on sabaody but I can't see Drake getting the same treatment. He is just a T-rex.</br>  <br>just check the goddamn box, it isnt difficult</br>  <br>There is a lot that can be done. We haven't seen his hybrid forme, and with Doflamingo introducing the concept of Awakened DFs, X Drake can possibly transform random people and lamps into dinossaurs<br><br> We Scary Monsters now </br></br></br>  <br>I am pretty sure awakened Zoans do not work that way, but we don't really know jack shit about awakening at this point so who knows</br>  <br><br><br>Nah awakened zoans were introduced in impel down. They are like chopper where they heal faster than normal and have increased strength.</br></br></br>  <br>Buy them and show us.</br>  <br>Basically this as a pirate</br>  <br>Where are they sold?</br>  <br>They look official, so they should be easy enough to get. Check the buythread and the most well known weaboo stuff reseller from your country, or cdjapan.</br>  Lucci is a very good boy  <br>Meh he's alright, but not "good" by any means.</br>  <br>Nah. He's most likely a gorilla fruit or human fruit. Maybe Hydra or some other mythological zoan.</br>  <br>Reminder that if Luffy didn't waste time talking to citizens while in Gear 4 he could have just soloed Doffy. Also reminder that most of Luffy's "help" was fodder and only half of Luffy's crew was even on the island.</br>  <br>nah he needed King kong to put doffy down. He was going to use another kong gun before his time ran out not the huge king kong gun.</br>  <br>http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.p<wbr>hp/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction</wbr></br>  Post your best heart pirate comics  Nah, Big mom will probably be whatsherface's mother, that she told Nami to find in the New World.<br><br>Either that or she will want to clash with Kaidou and there will be a 3 way battle.</br></br>  <br> fodder <br>there is this word again</br></br>  <br> solo <br>He couldn't even beat him at the castle. Even a gamma knifed Dofla (who may have been mentally busy trying to control or hold together his strings patching up his organs) survived G4 Luffy, who needed rescue from everyone else to do it again.<br><br>Keep in mind Luffy was already pissed because of what he did to Bellamy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit.</br></br>  <br> Hey, Penguin <br> If you win this one round against me, I'm willing to bottom <br> bottom... ! </br></br></br>  <br>She isn't going to just ally with them. Especially after fishman island. They will still fight first like every other villain that allied with luffy<br><br>Even Hancock let her sisters fight luffy first and the only reason she didnt fight luffy was because the story would have ended.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you throwing such a god damn fit about him having something that you wouldn't even notice unless you were specifically looking to see if he had a trip</br>  <br>You don't seriously believe Sanji and Co would have been of better help than Kyros, the dwarfs and the coliseum fighters right?</br>    <br>Was that lion dude the lion zoan, or just a weird person? <br><br>I thought he may be the lion, with the king aspect and how bloodthirsty carnivorous zoans are.<br><br>He's probably something stupid like a peacock.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> defending tripfags <br>thursdays and fridays really are the days were the cancer is most prominent</br></br>  <br> Throwing an autistic fit because someone has meaningless symbols instead of the word anonymous </br>  <br>can you fucking please read the manga like someone who doesn't have down's syndrome before posting here?</br>  <br> also in hunter x hunter <br>gtfo</br></br>  <br>just get out, you do not belong here</br>  <br>chopper has human already brah</br>  <br>your point?<br>are you a speedreader or a legitimate retard?</br></br>  <br>Doffy was<br> manipulating citizens with strings, controlling a massive birdcage of string, dealing with emotions regarding law and corazon, had just been attacked by Kuzan, directly hit by multiple attacks from law including having his internal organs disintegrated. <br>And it STILL took gear 4 to beat him, you mean</br></br></br>  <br>holy shit it took him 16 years to try and take over a country and within a week luffy blew his shit plans to sand feelsbadman</br>  <br><br>I hope you're enjoying your first day on 4chan, please make an attempt to get yourself accustomed to the website and I hope you have a good time  faggot <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/YgHNtzxO0y8  [ ]</br></br></br></br>    <br> Was that lion dude the lion zoan, or just a weird person? <br>He's a talking lion with a turtle zoan fruit.Have you ever heard of the wizard of oz?It's pretty much self-explanatory</br></br>  <br>Because he's a faggot, there's literally no other reason for being a trip on a board about chinese cartoons</br>  <br>how tf would he have a fruit someone already has</br>  <br>your welcome faggots</br>  <br> he needed x attack <br>I don't understand how you know that King Kong gun wasn't overkill and that, if Luffy had gotten an extra hit in previously, it would not have defeated Doflamingo<br><br> you dont </br></br></br></br>  <br>again, are you a speedreader or a retard?<br>zoans have different kinds of models for every type of zoan, the human zoan is not an exception <br>go reread the manga please and stop making stupid questions</br></br></br>  <br>he tanked 20 or so minutes of them. One more kong gun sending doffy through a building wouldn't have sealed the deal. He got up just fine after the three we saw. he wasn't 100% but he was in better shape than luffy was after his nen contract.</br>    <br><br><br>sengoku has a human as well the buddha model.</br></br></br>      <br> specifically looking <br>Really?</br></br>  shachi is chibi for some reason  <br>jesus christ...i think youre the speedreader here, it doesnt matter if they have different models you cant have two human-human fruits, you have mythical and ancient due to the animal/organism they portray, hence there wont be two phoenix fruits because it is classified under mythical due to the fact that phoenixes are mythical and not normal animals, nice job showing your reading comprehension skills you fucking ass clown</br>  <br><br><br>Fuck yes thank you, I loved that one but I never saved it.</br></br></br>  <br>0</br>  <br><br><br>more?</br></br></br>  <br>Bro, Sengoku has a Human fruit. Model Buddha. Kaido may just have another model of a Human fruit. It's unlikely as all hell because if he ate a Human fruit, he'd be enlightened but he's cruel as all fuck so it seems unlikely. Both Chopper's and Sengoku's fruits are ''Hito Hito no mi''. It's just that Sengoku's is a different version.</br>  <br> it doesnt matter if they have different models you cant have two human-human fruits <br><br>Chopper and Sengoku are both Human-Human, the fuck are you on?</br></br></br>  <br>he didn't fucking specified that he could have the human human fruit you piece of shit, he just said that he could have a human fruit</br>  <br><br>also, marco's fruit is not even named so shut the fuck up</br></br>    <br> One more kong gun wouldn't have sealed the deal <br> got up just fine <br><br>standing isn't a big deal in One Piece and you don't exactly have a lot to stand on.</br></br></br></br>   there was people who hated the doffy/luffy fight <br><br>I've just caught up, and got to read it without any gaps and it was the best fight we've had in a long time. Hell it's probably the best arc we've had in a long time, easy top 5 material</br></br>  <br> shachi slutting away at the pub like the heart pirate bicycle he is <br>I knew it</br></br>    <br>welcome to One Piece threads, where people complain about the same things every arc  and keep reading </br>  <br><br>well its more Law than Shachi here but he sure isnt protesting</br></br>  <br>he didnt just stand back up. he went back to parasiting people and using his awakening powers.<br><br><br><br>  it was the best fight we've had in a long time. <br><br>not saying much. The fights post time skip minus vergo has been been lackluster. Vergo has been the light in the darkness keeping us altogether</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, someone should make a compilation of all scenes were Luffy and Doffy fight, when you see all scenes together without any gaps between them it is one hell of a great fight</br>  <br> never actually read the manga <br> ellipses <br> all around typing like a faggot <br><br>Underage, please fuck off back to Reddit.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Yep, it was nice to see some actual choreography mixed in with the haki/df instead of move names and reaction images.</br>  <br> Vergo <br> good <br>Wow, Smoker threw a bunch of shitty hits, got his ass handed to him, and then Law one shot him. <br><br>Fuck off tripfag<br/></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Smoker acted as a distraction m8</br>  <br> and then Law one shot him. </br>    <br>there have not been any real great fights since Lucci vs Luffy to be honest, I don't care though since I am not a fightfag and am glad when the fight scenes are short.</br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Go back to fucking tunblr</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> soo, you've been like this <br> yeah, but we don't remember the culprits, what should we do? <br> isn't it good, you're young again <br> also really cute <br> damn i can't be in the crew like this, isn't there anything to do? <br> soo, you don't know the culprits, this might be a good adventure <br> it's kinda scary when capp'n seems to like this </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> battle shonen <br> don't like fights <br><br>why are you reading one piece instead of a pure gag manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>it is useless anon, thursdays and fridays are just shit days for OP threads and this sadly will never change</br>  <br>they are not going to listen <br>these threads are not about one piece anymore, just about these faggots spamming their shitty fan art</br></br>  <br>I did not say I do not like fights, it is just not the primary reason I read One Piece, I read it because I love pretty much all of the characters and the world building is just great and very intriguing.</br>  <br><br><br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off tumblrtard.</br>    <br> there have not been any real great fights since Lucci vs Luffy to be honest <br><br>Marineford was okay for what it was.

There's no reason for people like you to bitch about it.</br></br></br>  My favourite page for a while  Wait, that was it? That was the whole flashback?  <br>I like how kubo could have made this whole flashback into one chapter and lost nothing</br>   next chapter starts <br> ichigo and crew are still chasing askin  <br><br>I like how grimmjow is acting like he could even hurt the guy if he caught him</br></br></br>  <br><br> askin wanted Mayuri to follow him <br> mayuri was too smart and said no thanks <br> ichigo and the retard crew can't help themselves </br></br></br></br>   Quincy genocide was 200 years ago <br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br> the quincy genocide was done because the shinigami wanted to kill the next would-be power-sharer <br><br> ywatch-like power sharers is also the reason being a shinigami substitute and also Rukia lending powers to Ichigo was such a big deal <br><br> the first shinigami substitute, Ginjo, has power sharing abilities </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OOOOOOO FUUUUUUUCCKKKKKKK</br>  <br> I like how grimmjow is acting like he could even hurt the guy if he caught him <br>But what if Grimmjow got a piece of Ichigo's soul during his fight with Ichigo? and that soul fragment has been evolving and enhancing Grimm's power even more. What if Grimmjow is Ichigo's letter D 'The Destroy' Star Knight?</br></br>  Well, that was over faster than expected    <br>was probably the worst flashback in the entire series solely because they could have done it on one page or gave us a bunch of chapters covering the ancient history of the quincies<br><br>instead he went shitty version of both outcomes</br></br></br>  <br>Is that why Aizen is stronger now? Because of Ichigo's soul piece? Are all the people around Ichigo gonna die at one point when he decides he needs his power back?</br>  <br>FUCK<br><br> you are now aware that, in order for Ichigo to restore his power after Mugetsu, had to take a spirit sword made of power from lots of people he influenced before <br><br>KUBOOOOOOO</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WAIT A MINUTE THIS MAKES SENSE<br>KUUUUUBBBBBOOOOO!!!!!!!!</br></br>  <br>Indeed. But I've taken to the belief that with Kubo 'everything is possible, until it's not, and even then it might still happen'. Basically around Kubo never Relax or you'll get caught off guard.</br>  <br>So where they really giving him his soul back because he has the power sharing ability or ala rukia is this just a common ability?</br>  <br>And was pierced in the same place like Ishida after he lost his powers</br>  So Juhabach is at least 1000 years old<br><br>He says special Quincy are only born every 200 years....even though he says there was never one before so how did he decide that.<br><br>Bazz says they're supposed to happen every decade but there hasn't been one since Flashbackception McGee here. <br><br>Juhaback got sealed 900 years ago<br><br>Genryusai failed to kill him 1000 years ago<br><br>Just trying to figure out the timeline.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So Juhabach is at least 1000 years old <br>Do you not remember the whole "999 years, 11 months and 30 days" bullshit?</br></br>  <br>try to fit the quincy genocide and all the rest of the quincy births in there and gets even worse<br><br><br><br>that's why he said at least</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is that why Aizen is stronger now? Because of Ichigo's soul piece? Are all the people around Ichigo gonna die at one point when he decides he needs his power back? <br>I wasn't really serious about that post, but if it is true, then it could be the reason Aizen got stronger even though the HG had made him weaker pre-timeskip. And if Ichigo did impart his Soul to everyone and is going to gain those cultivated pieces back for the Final showdown; I doubt anyone will die and that the worst that will happen is they'll lose their powers.<br><br><br> So where they really giving him his soul back because he has the power sharing ability <br>Even if what that other Anon said was true the Shinigami wouldn't have known that, but Urahara might have had an idea as he was the one who made the Spirit Sword for everyone to put their power into.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Ichigo is going to absorb all the power he has lent out.<br><br>This will include Bach as he had been giving young bach power the whole time which fueled current bach to reawaken<br><br>so Ichigo will absorb everything and become god</br></br></br></br>  So being the Uber Quincy enhances the powers of those around you. The Hogyoku does the same thing. Is it a ball of crystallized Uber Quincy?  I swear to god if this ends in<br>"MY EYES THEY SAW EVERYTHING, HOW COULD YOU?"<br>*smirk*<br>Aizen or whoever says some shit about fooling his senses cue the classic "BUT I SAW YOU DIE" meltdown.<br>Then bach dies.<br><br>I'd much rather bach actually be a good guy and die in the end all according to his plan. The true villain is someone else, which he has already seen beaten by ichigo but only if he does exactly what he's doing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always thought the Hogyoku was something made from the spirit king. But it's weird because it's indestructible but bach killed the spirit king</br>  <br>To further it, everyone he's killed was due to necessity to save the world.<br><br>If yamato lived, maybe our unknown villain would have used him to destroy the world.<br>Just as an example.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Will bach ever use the yamamoto bankai he stole?<br><br>It seems hard to believe anyone can beat that power</br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of yamato banki what did it really do again?<br><br>Burn everything to crisp instantly while reviving all the people he's ever killed, but as skeletons on fire?<br>I honestly didn't get it. Do the skellys still have their original powers?</br></br></br></br>  <br> this ends up being the actual reason for chad and orihimes powers <br>KUUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</br></br>  <br>pretty sure that's how it was already explained that being around ichigo and his high reiatsu caused them to develop powers<br><br><br>I am too lazy to look it up but I think rukia said it if not her then yorouichi</br></br></br></br>   now it's all about power-sharing <br><br>Ichigo needed to powerup somehow after all - they thought it was the Hogyoku (which it still does), but it was Ichigo all along.</br></br>  <br>they explained it that because he had no control over his reiatsu it was just leaking out and thats why they got their powers. before this made no sense but with this theory it actually ends up making a whole lotta sense</br>  I don't care about this. I just want to see Rukia.  <br>They are Ichigo's first sternritters. I'm afraid for their lifes now</br>  <br> not caring about the plot and only watching for cute girls <br>fuck just go read muv luv you mouth breather</br></br>  <br>But that doesn't have Rukia. I want Rukia.</br>  <br><br>Ichigo's is probably special snowflake (like it isn't already?) and doesn't kill them.</br></br>   Orihime has the power to defy God <br> Orihime's power doesn't work on God <br><br>what?</br></br></br>  <br> Ichigo needed to powerup somehow after all  <br>Is there anyone that can defeat Ichigo? And I am not talking about bankai ichigo. I am not even talking about Final Getsuga Ichigo.<br><br>I am talking about quincy, vaizard, hollow, fullbringer, shinigami human hybrid ichigo with soul absorbing powers and two zanpaktou</br></br></br></br>  <br> So Juhabach is at least 1000 years old. He says special Quincy are only born every 200 years, even though he says there was never one before so how did he decide that. <br>Yhwach is said to be over 200yrs old at the time and that a Quincy like him hasn't been born for that same amount of time. This could mean Yhwach's own existence was the origin of the not-normal Quincy Myth Bazz-b heard about, or that he's even older then what is said and that Quincys like him were born a lot more until 200yrs ago. <br><br>Anyway, this flashback takes place prior to the war with the SS a thousand years ago and that this power-giver Quincy thing means Yhwach is over 1200yrs old in the present, but he's probably even older than that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget part Soul King.<br><br> since when were you under the impression Bach was the only one? </br></br></br></br>  <br>That was the original explanation but then Aizen said it was the Hogyoku and it's wish granting abilties<br><br><br>Has...she tried yet?</br></br></br></br>  So since Ichigo's dad is technically dead... Is Ichigo 100% Quincy genetically? <br><br><br>When she tried to fix the soul king</br></br></br>  <br>Since Orihime is irrelevant now, she's also weak. It's how Kubo works.</br>  <br><br>Get ready for it being Ichigo, and not the Hogyoku, or rather Ichigo speeding up the process with his 'new' powers.</br></br>  <br>no souls function the same as real bodies when they get in a gigai</br>   Ichigo gets power up <br> No longer needs to rely on Yhwach <br> Shows off base form for 2 pages <br> Not seen again for over 30 chapters <br><br>...........</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ichigos friends end up convincing ichigo to use ashwallen (fuck german) to defeat juha <br> ichigo wins but they all die <br> bleach ends with ichigo defeating juha and forming a new soul society made up of arrancar, quincy, and the few shinigami left of which he is the captain commander <br>sounds good to me to be honest.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE, HE'S GOING TOO DEEP<br>.

Perhaps he was actively giving powers to people that he was very fond of, maybe even being really altruistic, and then Soul Society was like "you're not building friendships, you're abusing the system, bastard."</br></br>  <br>Many people would be pretty happy with that.<br>I'd be okay with it, since Ichigo is annoying as fuck.</br></br>  <br> Ichigo will TAKE the power of the Soul King from Yhwach <br> Take his sight, then kill him. <br>Wait wait wait wait. I need to back up. Have we talked much about how Yhwach is the son of the Soul King?</br></br></br>  Who in the manga is worthy of her, bros?<br><br> Nobody. </br></br>  <br>Oh, shit.</br>  <br> give me <br> and then i give you <br><br>Power distribution? Kubo? Help? Somebody?</br></br></br></br>  Hmmm....what makes this power absording/distributing power so damn undetectable? You'd think shinigami/quincys/fullbringers/holl<wbr>ows could feel the stuff like it's reiatsu or reishi. Even Yhwach seems to have been on the hunt for someone with powers like his. He apparently couldn't feel Hasch's powers until he was nearby. Even with the "A" he was roaming around for his power-partner- and when he finally met Hasch, he apparently used "A" to make sure Hasch was the one. <br><br>Furthermore, this could be the reason Mimihagi-sama stayed in hiding successfully from Yhwach.<br><br>And of course, if the epic theories in this thread are true, we have the plot reason for saving this power's reveal until chapter 600something.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  Did Ywatch know that Bazz, Lil and Gigi were going to betray?<br><br>Are they actually under the impression?<br>Is everything going according to keikaku?</br></br></br>  <br> They are Ichigo's first sternritters. <br>Chad Sternritter G "The Guardian or Giant"<br>Orihime Sternritter S "The Shield"<br>Grimmjow Sternritter D "The Destruction" <br>Nelliel Sternritter K "The Knight" <br>Yoruichi Sternritter L "The Light-speed"<br>Ganju Sternritter T "The Transmute"<br>Urahara Sternritter B "The Blood"<br>Rukia Sternritter F "The Freeze"<br>Renji Sternritter H "The Howler"<br>Uryuu Sternritter Q "The Quincy"<br><br>I tried to think up what their Epithets would be, but I don't think they work really well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinigami feared he would become the next Ywatch, so they killed his friends from that era except for Tsukishima who managed to flee?<br>Ukitake would be the one who persecuted them, off course.<br><br> Is Tsukishima Ginjo's Haschwalth? <br><br> also, Ginjo uses a sword which comes from a cross </br></br></br></br></br></br>  When was the last time Lab Member participated in our threads?  <br>Why do you care?</br>  <br>You should know, Lab Member</br>  <br><br>We'll probably get those answers in 70 chapters or so.</br></br>  <br>When they turned to shit.</br>  <br>Because I want them chart updates.</br>  <br>Anons, keep in mind the Sternritter and their letter powers (aside from the Almighty himself) were a late invention (see the flashback)<br><br>Ywatch had the power to give and take soul pieces and power before creating the SR.<br><br>That Ichigo can do so doesn't mean they all become SR with Letter powers</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127483805 <br>Called Allah, your time is coming shitposter</br>  <br>Orihime is R, "The Rejection"  because Ichigo will never love her </br>  <br>So he's a Rukiafag?</br>  <br>Of course.

What the fuck could it even be about these days?</br>  <br>Uryuu, Quincy Q: The Quincy, a quincy that has the powers and looks of a quincy.</br>    <br>No I'm serious. I stopped watching the anime after the main dude saves his waifu from the tower before her execution. Then I read it goes on for another like 5 arcs and bad dudes being bad on a DBZ tier power level hike every arc. Then I heard they stopped making the anime but kept the mangoes going.<br><br>Are they basically invincible galaxy throwing beings like TTGL now?</br></br></br>  <br>nope it isnt that shitty.</br>  <br>Well basically there's this Jew who's trying to conquer the world through the power of usury and now Ichigo has to holocaust them.</br>  reminder this happened  <br>Oy vey shut it down.<br><br>Is that the actual hilt on his sword? I don't remember that being a thing when I watched it...</br></br></br>  <br>lol, so is Toshiro also a girl?<br><br>shiro = white</br></br></br>  <br>Is this the wiki?<br>How fucking delusional can you be?<br>It's like Giselle all over again.</br></br></br>  <br>Naw, the theorycrafting was much better when it was all Rukiafags, then tumblr and narutards came and they went to complete and utter shit.<br>Example, <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/119368<wbr>002/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>It gets even better</br>  <br>Didn't the badge he used to steal Yamamoto's Bankai got covered with Ichibei's ink?<br>He was able to undo the name-removing effect from himself because lol almighty, but technically his sword and the bankai stealing badge should be nameless and powerless, meaning Yama's bankai is done for.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>This is really only the third arc after that. Chapters 180ish to 420ish is a mega fucking long arc that makes Namek look concise, in which the Soul Society and Ichigo and friends all fight together. Ichigo gets way way stronger. Then he gets a whole lot weaker and it's more mystery and coolshit than fighting shonen for like 60 chapters. Then he gets a lot of power back and and the enemies go from super strong hollow humanoids to well-trained OP-ability using nazi dudes. The villain is even more OP but Ichigo has some extreme power ready but not really used yet. Early in this arc there was a lot of weird battles going on, but the good guys finally have a competent enemy. And recently each week has been WTFing the whole fanbase. While the author can be accused of pulling a lot of things out his ass, overall this arc is giving more context to the earlier arcs. It's far from DBZ levels of "let's just make the characters stronger to keep the manga in print".</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>ooi oi.<br>kubo knows what his shit is....<br>damn.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Rankings <br>Topkek<br><br>Bleach rounds the 3 million volumes oer year and it doesn't even have an anime</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. The fact he actually took a little time to flesh out a couple new characters rather than machine gunning them in and out before we can even remember their name was a relief. If he had done this in 4-5 pages we'd be tearing him apart for pacing.</br>  <br>Stop lying, the way you write makes it an obvious bait<br><br>Also<br> Rukia <br> Waifu <br>Kek</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically his waifu, yeah.</br>  <br> You are under the impression that he hasnt started kuboing <br> under the impression he hasnt started  <br>hehe, made me chukle...sort of implies he is always kuboing and theres no way off this ride.</br></br></br>  <br>lel, nice.<br><br><br>Ah, thanks for the summary, friend.<br><br><br>Was I misreading their relationship? They seemed pretty into each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will the anime come back?<br><br>I think so I'm just bummed that whoever would do it knows they should wait a few more years or at least until an end is in site.<br><br>I'd really want to see what they could do with this bullshit though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>of course it will, it may not be as popular as naruto or one piece buts its still profitable as an anime</br>  <br>I can't wait</br>  <br>Slam Dunk was really popular. It never came back</br>  <br>does anyone have the gif/webm version of this?</br>    <br> ywach gives people part of his soul and collects on his debts with exorbitant interest by taking all of their souls <br> Getsuga Tenshou was originally Isshin's move with Engetsu, a fire-based zanpakuto <br>FUUUUUUUUUCK</br></br></br>  So, there's something special about the fact that Uryuu didn't lose his powers even though he comes from a corrupted bloodline i.e. his mom?<br><br>Maybe something about his lineage from his fathers side?</br></br>  <br>He is just like Ichigo and Haschwald and  Ginjo  a sharer. Sameface confirms.</br>  <br>ywhach seemed utterly shocked by it<br><br>I assumed ryuuken informed urahara about everything and they developed something.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's what I'm thinking, but since he hasn't really shown anything beyond being a prodigy there can still be other reasons perhaps/ <br><br><br>Which chapter does Ywhach state as much?<br>I want to re-read it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  <br>oh god...</br></br>  <br>the same chapter we learned about ishida and he made him an A like him</br>  <br>All the Nazi jokes were supposed to be jokes, dammit</br>  <br><br>Ichigo's manji has nothing to do with the Vandenreich.......right? Even if he's related to Yhwach? It's a coincidence?<br><br> Ichigo really needs a Jewish friend. <br><br><br> Or the Vandenreich needs an ethnic Jew on their team. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime's never coming back theyre broke</br>  <br>it will eventually get remade like hiatus x hiatus did</br>  <br> Or the Vandenreich needs an ethnic Jew on their team. <br>Yhwach is actually a Jew. His town "gave him the name of their god". YHWacH.</br></br>   Maybe Ginjou is the 5th special war potential.   <br> soul society goes to earth and kills the full bringers <br><br> they ressurect in soul society <br> let them roam free instead of killing them again </br></br></br></br>  <br>If the Bleach anime were remade, with good budget, better seiyuus, and loyal to the manga, it would be a dream come true. But I doubt Bleach will ever be animated again.</br>  <br> better seiyuus <br>Fuuuuuck you.</br></br>  <br>they animated hni and medaka box and they had far less fanbase than even dying bleach.</br>  <br>Orihime needs a voice that won't make viewers want to claw their eyes out, off the top of my head.</br>  <br>I want to fuck Young Jugram</br>  <br>YHWH probably did.</br>  <br> train hard <br> making solid gains <br> skinnyfat guy near you isn't improving at all <br> does he even lift lol?? <br> turns out he has been emitting steroids for you the whole time </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with their pupils</br>  <br>Everyone wants to, even his uncle did.<br>I would rather the older one, though.</br></br>  <br>Wait that can't work because...shit.<br><br>Godammit Kubo.</br></br></br>  <br>Slamming into him while pulling his long hair</br>  <br>All fullbringers have a power-sharing ability. They shared a piece of their abilities with each other, being a shinigami/fullbringer lets you steal other fullbrings though. At least that's what I got out of it.</br>  <br>S-stop it, anon, I've already fapped today.</br>  <br>Why does he look like bankai Rukia?</br>  <br>skinnyfat guy sweats creatine</br>  <br>seems stronger than creatine<br><br><br>protein powder?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aizen Sternritter P "The Plan"</br>  <br>Sosuke Aizen, Sternritter I "The Illusion"</br>  <br> not I the illusion <br><br>step it up senpai</br></br></br>  Come on Bazz B, kill him. I believe in you, do it lad.  <br>He couldn't even kill the powerless one back when his morale was bad.<br><br>No way he kills the one who realized why he couldn't use quincy skills.<br><br>now I have to go back and watch the interaction with shunsui and nanao. would explain why the barrier held him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not a chance.</br>  <br>This thread made me go from a 3 to a 9</br>  <br>The power of belief is more powerful than the power of writing. I believe that Bazz can do it. I have faith in him.</br>  <br>Oh fuck you, I can't unsee.</br>  <br>The mouth is coming out of her ass so I deleted that one.<br><br><br>Yes, yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Orhime is really the only mediocre one I can think of, all the others were top tier. <br><br> Tfw I'll never hear Mamoru Miyano as Haschwalth or Eri Kitamura as Gigi </br></br></br></br>  <br>It also explains why Yhwach is so interested in Ichigo and why he called him his child. (Well, that and Masaki as matter, but this kinda solidifies it)</br>  I just want friendship arc to end.<br>Please, Kubo.</br>  So If Ichigo has the same 'sharing' abilities as Jugo then is it safe to assume that if Rukia never 'awakened' Ichigo, Chad and Orihime would still develop their powers while Ichigo stayed relatively normal?  <br>It's already over dude, we'll only see the aftermat next chapter and then it will probably be ichigo/Sternritter D time</br>  <br>no I think the shinigami powers would have manifested eventually. He was attracting all sorts of hollows to the area because of his reiatsu. he would have awakened the quincy zangetsu at the very least.</br>  <br>Bazz will have to bleed and curse him, hinting at something. And the rescue party will arrive. And we'll get back to it later.<br><br>God, I hope he dies here. Not that I have anything against him, I just want other threads to progress.</br></br></br>   Ichigo is a human lent Shinigami powers <br> Urahara fucked up, now he has Hollow powers <br> now he's a Vizard <br> his full potential is as far beyond a god as it is beyond other beings <br> he's a quincy too <br> he's a special quincy born every 200 years <br><br>Where does it end?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>urahara didnt fuck up<br><br>he knew exactly what he was doing<br><br>which is why he told them wait on killing him or saving him when they thought it was all going wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ichigo is a human lent Shinigami powers <br>He lost those and then gained his own. It's why his original zanpaktou had the guard of sode no shirayuki<br> Urahara fucked up, now he has Hollow powers <br>He's always had hollow powers nigga, in a way. all shinigami use a hollow-like being for their asauchi, Ichigo just uses the genuine thing<br> now he's a Vizard <br>He's something better, vizards were just shinigami with hollow-like powers, Ichigo was more like a complete cross between Shinigami, Fullbringer, Quincy, and Hollow at the time of his birth.<br> his full potential is as far beyond a god as it is beyond other beings <br>Because he's everything<br> he's a special quincy born every 200 years <br>We don't know this yet, heavily hinted at though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're missing the point, which is that Ichigo is a garbage sue-esque character. And I forgot Fullbringer.</br>  <br>Thanks, that statement was far more interesting than the last three chapters.<br>I hate those flashbacks. It's like fillers but worse because it's even shorter compared to anime episodes.<br>I sincerely hope the flashback is over now.</br></br></br>  <br> a series where people are competing to make the perfect hybrid <br> main character finds out that he may be that hybrid <br>How is that a mary sue?</br></br></br>  <br>He's not a transcendent, doesn't have access to his quincy tech except for blut vene in dire situations, his fullbringer powers got taken away, and he's still probably weaker than the strongest characters, including probably Uryu now.<br><br>Nigga, don't use buzzwords you don't know the meaning of.</br></br></br>  I'm wondering how they'll end up with replacing the Soul King. Someone's gotta take his place, right? My bet is Ichigo or Aizen.  <br>What an original post.</br>  haven't read bleach in a few months. Are these 2 cannon yet?  <br>Not yet. It's getting closer now though, multiple characters are starting to push them together because Ichigo is completely clueless.</br>  <br>yes, dubs confirm</br>  <br>Well that scene wasn't cannon and no</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>They're getting there.</br>  Wait, so.. Would Ichigo's soul sharing abilities also be what caused the Monk's revival, then? Considering he said "It's a logical conclusion given the both of our powers".  <br>Yep. Which means Ichigo knows.</br>  <br><br>  People still caring for bleach after even the manga went full retard </br></br>  <br>What else is there? Everything else is pure garbage.</br>  <br>Jesus christ, read more manga.</br>  <br><br>Vagabond and Vinland saga when released... Berserk if not up to date and till recently SnK (though i fear the retardness is already claiming it's tool)</br></br>  <br>Well fuck me sideways<br><br>Also I feel you B.

If you're talking about popularity rankings and sales and you don't know that much, you need to do more research.</br>  <br>I don't get it.</br>  Starting to think that Yhwach's "dai ichi no musuko"-schtick actually means that Jugo is Yhwach's personal favorite.<br>I mean he's not claiming to be Jugram's literal father in the flashback. So instead Jugo is a descendant of Yhwach and the same may still apply to all other Quincies.</br>   you will never be as attractive and perfect as Jugram   <br>He looks like he's literally gay. You can't be that pretty and not look gay. <br><br>I think Aizen is the perfect specimen.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter.<br>Aizen and Jugram are absolutely perfect in their own way.</br></br>  <br><br> tfw you will never be as fabulous as Askin </br></br>  <br> those facial aesthetics <br>I would LITERALLY kill a man to have them.</br></br>   Ichiruki doujins and Ichiruki conventions are still being held in Japan <br> Newest one was 3 weeks ago <br><br>The fandom is strong with this one.<br><br> Ichiruki ship is literally the only reason why Bleach sells anything in Japan <br><br>Kubo realizes this I'm sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, I hope that's the end of the backstory. Seriously.</br>  <br>these past couple of weeks have been so boring</br>  <br>Jugo-chan wasn't Bazz's friend anymore when Bazz realised Jugo was more powerful than him. <br><br>When Jugo realized that, he decided to stop his assassination attempt.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Ichigo + Uryuu fighting the Menos </br></br>    <br>It might just be Jugo's Quincy blood kicking in, you know. This means that even someone who has Yhwach's powers isn't safe from The Almighty, or the Quincy blood control. For some reason only the SK was capable of bypassing The Almighty .<br>I wonder how Ichigo is going to rid himself of Yhwach's interference. At this point he has no choice other than to complete hollowfication.</br></br>  <br>I love how the story was set up as if Jugo was the betrayer and Bazz was the super bro. Turns out Bazz is nothing but a power hungry sham.</br>  So, there must be other "born every 200 years" special people, right?<br><br>My bet is on Urahara, Ukitake and Aizen.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, Friend arc gets shit on because it doesn't advance the plot but it was well executed, unlike the plot. <br><br>I don't mind filler shit anymore when I enjoy the filler more than the main plot</br></br></br>  <br>Rukia would be last person to survive since Ichigo would take more from her than anyone else and in fact did take all her energy the first time they did it.<br><br><br>I was thinking that the shinigami could have been trying to stop the second coming of Bach as he would return in 999 years but counted down from his birth rather than his sealing. They killed off the pure born and assumed Bach had been thwarted.<br>Then again capturing Ginjo to keep him under control makes a lot of sense. I really hate this theory though because I hate Ginjo and don't want him or Fullbringers to be relevant.<br><br><br>And plain Rukia looks like Tensa Zangetsu.<br>Black hair, blue eyes, short eyebrows, even got the hair in the middle of their face <br><br><br>Maybe only power sucking Quincy count as sons. The rest are monkeys.<br><br><br>You could cut the homoerotic tension between Aizen and Ichigo with a knife.<br><br><br>He builds up their relationship till the last chapter and then pairs Ichigo off with Orihime.<br>Bleach ends in a wave of salt.<br>Kubo gets away with everything.<br><br><br>Ichigo ties Uryu to his swords and uses him to bludgeon Yhwach to death.<br>The Menos fight and Mayuri determining Yhwach's return from meeting with Uryu seems to suggest that Uryu is a power mover as well.<br><br><br>Ukitake can redirect energy, but that might be from Mimihagi merging with him since childhood and giving him lesser abilities of the Soul King.<br>Ukitake might be where Aizen got his idea of merging with the Hogyoku from.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh shit it's A Thursday already  <br>I'm not sure hollowfication would help. They're anathema to *quincy* (human+Yhwach), but pure Yhwach power seems to mix with hollows just fine.</br>  <br>We're talking about quincies here, not shinigami, and of those we want the ones that can't control reishi, the only one we know about with such criteria is Ichigo (Aside from already known ones like Yhwach and Jugo).<br><br>I don't think Ishida is one of them, he already displayed good control over reishi.</br></br></br>  <br><br> breaks reishi glove, literally starts deconstructing Soul Society <br> reishi control </br></br></br>  <br>If that's not reishi control then what is?<br>Reishi control is just manipulating it as far as I know.<br>I'm not understanding your argument, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>It only needs to remove Yhwach's influence, not remove the Quincy power completely. Once Ichigo is free of Yhwach's death grip he'll be able to fight properly again..</br>  <br>Based Japan, shipping the one true pairing.</br>  <br>That's what I'm saying. If Yhwach can quincify arrancar the same way he quincifies humans, a full hollowfication probably wouldn't do anything to stop him.</br>  <br><br>Oh, sorry, implied sarcasm is hard to understand.<br><br> Mayuri makes note of this </br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, anon, but sarcasm isn't easy to detect in text and in such arguments...<br>At least we agree on that Ishida does in fact have such control and is, therefore, unqualified to be a "power-sharer".</br></br>  <br>A full hollowfication would blend all of Ichigo's alter egos and powers into one supreme being that is stronger than the sum of all three of them. If Ywhach loses his connection to Ichigo, then Ichigo can fight with the intent of killing, without holding back again. As it is now ever since Ichigo's Quincy powers made a full awakening Ichigo has been a lot less hostile and he hasn't even killed anyone.<br>Remember Shaz? Ichigo oneshot him out of principle alone. He's not attacking NakkHe's not attacking Nakk either. He could've done the same with any other Quincy he has run into since then, but he has chosen to instead avoid them, or play around with the Quincies.<br>It's puzzling though because Yhwach struck Ichigo down Ichigo's Quincy blood clearly acted against Yhwach's wishes by shielding him and keeping Yhwach from forcefully recruiting him.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>That's not how japanese works.

I don't want Orihime to win, she was always bland as fuck. Rukia at least had personality</br>  <br>No romantic end is most likely, though Ichigo/Rukia probably has the best chance.</br>  <br>I can live with that</br>  <br>I HAVE GAZED INTO INFINITY AND IT MADE SENSE</br>  <br><br>Orihime is the only one among the three whose feelings are confirmed to be highly romantic. She gets canonically fucked over by not winning Ichigo. That's why I think her chances are better- it satisfied her non-fan-speculation feelings. If IchiRuki becomes canon, it means Kubo has been trying to embarrass her. It's not like she has some other love interest in the works.<br><br>I'm not really in it for the shipping, though. We know that whoever gets the strawberry will only do so for a few panels in the epilogue.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, we only ever see Ginjo taking and sharing the power.<br>He took it from Ichigo and redistributed it.<br>Everyone gets mad at him for taking it before they arrive because they aren't sure he won't just keep it all.<br>But we don't see Orihime or Chad do anything like that, or any of the other Fullbringers.<br>Kubo...He can't keep getting away with it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> It means Kubo has been trying to embarrass her <br><br>Wow, I would never have guessed.</br></br></br></br>    Today I will remind them.  <br> it means Kubo has been trying to embarrass her <br><br>Its possible. Even if he's hard pressed to kill them off, he is willing to screw over his characters and her recent appearances have been pretty pitiful.<br> wears a sexy outfit for her crush <br> he tells her to cover up <br> competition shows up with respectable clothes AND bigger tits </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not agreeing with the other guy, but what Yukio says in the third panel doesn't explicitly state that full-bringers scan share their powers between themselves on their own. All that it really says is that they shared they're power with Ginjou and he shared his with everyone else.</br>  <br>He says Fullbringers and Subtitute Shinigami, not a Subtitute Shinigami Fullbringer.</br>   the threads will always descend into shipping shit <br> rukiafags will always scream that ichigo wants to fuck his bro </br>  <br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</wbr></br>  <br> Skipped the last 3 chapters <br> Didn't even skim more than 1-3 pages in each just to check if this flashback was done. <br> Still don't even know if it's done <br>Fuck I just want Bleach to be over already this is awful.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Ichigo's abilities were all things he copied.<br><br> Byakuya goes fast <br> His Bankai goes Faster <br><br> Grimjaw is fast and strong <br> After he sorts his shit out he's goes faster <br><br> Ulq can regenerate everything except his organs <br> Ichigo can regenerate his organs. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, but the sub-shini to full-bringer thing doesn't really mean anything as Ginjou wasn't a sub-shinigami anymore at that point. He was just a full-bringer with some leftover shinigami power he pulled out from within himself.<br><br>And to make matters worse the only two Sub-shinigami that exist are both full-bringers, so that info about it only being between sub-shini and full-brings can't be proven.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel EXACTLY the same. Have not even checked this week's.</br>  <br>And yet we're still here. Maybe I'll just dump pictures of characters I like or something.</br>  <br>Zaraki Kenpachi - Sternritter K "The Kendo"</br>  <br>They've barely even been around recently</br>  <br>Ichigo could regen long before that fight. During his training to subdue his inner hollow Kensei cut his whole arm clean off and he just grew a new one. Even before then Ichigo was using passive regen, but Orihime's healing is far more potent and quicker. Speed and power are just basic stats, but I will give you that he copies his opponent's fighting style to some extent. The change in Ichigo's mask can be attributed to Ulquiorra's powers and the absorbtion of Quilge's power is also legit.</br>  <br>They were getting plenty of screentime until the last three weeks, that's relatively recently.</br>  <br>Ichigo hasn't done shit since 620, and Orihime since 615. Ichigo has taken up space in exposition but he hasn't been the focus of anything for months. And Orihime hasn't even managed more than 5 panels in any one chapter since her stupid new outfit debut in 587.</br>  <br>It's more screen time than most get nowadays.</br>  <br>Well, it pretty much established why ichigo hadn't used Quincy powers until now. He was giving his powers to his friends, like hashy and ywach. Cept it was orihime and Chad that got powers.</br>  <br>That's fullbringer to substitute, vise versa, but not fullbringer on their own</br>  When will we see her zanpakuto?  <br>Soifon's using it.</br>  <br>After her brother deliver it to her.</br>  The only good fight in this arc is ichibei vs yhwach. Seeing two powerhouse going head to head with one another.  <br>That fight was shit and you're a faggot.</br>  <br>It was a rather even fight compared to the other fights in this arc.</br>  <br> Bleach 633 <br><br>While I enjoyed the flashback, it doesn't help that I don't give a shit about the characters or if either side wins or not. I'm just ready for Buckbeard to be dead already, so Kubo can't wrap this shit up.</br></br></br>  <br>Jugo is a rather important character so you should care about him. That guy looks like he won't be defeated so easily.</br>  <br> Jugo is a rather important character so you should care about him <br>No sucker, I'm going to care for the characters I like, not someone I "should" because he's "important".</br></br>  <br>Ah, thanks for the explanation, always good to know more.<br>lol, all I remembered was that in the omake Juushirou kept giving Toushirou candy, and when asked about it explained it was cause of shirou in their names, which had to do with their white hair.<br>When talking about these folks in English, shirou is often shortened to just shiro, which probably caused things to be overlooked.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ishida</br></br>  <br>Bleach has no even fights.</br>  <br>ooh.</br>  bump so I can sleep in peace.  bump again.  Reminder that Everything but the Rain took place in Naruki city, the headquarters of Xcution.  <br><br><br>I want to see those chapters animate</br></br></br>  <br>The Dark Knight Rises.</br>  <br> Rukia looks like Yhwach <br> Bankai Rukia looks like Jugo <br> her past is still a mystery <br>I DO NOT LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING<br><br><br>I know what you mean, but if Orihime sacrifices herself for Ichigo and/or Rukia, maybe with some insight into her own feelings, then it won't feel like she was treated badly. It wouldn't be out of character for her, at least. She loves Rukia too, wants to be useful and is pretty selfless.<br><br><br>Oh, almost forgot.<br><br>WEEKLY REMINDER</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Blood = Blut in German<br>Iron = Eisen in German<br> Aizen <br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</br></br></br>  <br>Isshin Shiba Sternritter O - The Origin<br>Shirosaki Sternritter Z - The Zangetsu</br></br>  <br>Zangetsu Sternritter M: The Moon</br>  <br>Eat that Aizen, Ichigo. It's good for your blood.</br>   Narrative reasons for why the power-creep only started when the protagonist appeared in the story <br><br>kubo plz</br></br>  <br>What power creep? No one has powered up in a long time. Jugram was retard strong before as well.</br>  You neanderthals actually think Orihime/Ichigo is going to happen? K E K   Rukia looks like Yhwach <br> Bankai Rukia looks like Jugo <br> her past is still a mystery <br><br>Don't let it be this way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the Quincy palace made of ice?<br><br>And doesn't Rukia's bankai turn her into ice?</br></br></br>  <br>Askin is a turkish name.

I thought that scene where Rukia was comforting her after Urahara made her cry did that.</br>  Does Ginjo have to regive ichigo his fullbring powers that were taken? Or were those returned when ginjo died?  <br>No Ichigo just shared his power with Ishida.</br>  One thing that needs to be cleared up is if the "defective" Quincies were born every few decades and killed for their lack of ability, or if Jugram is the only Quincy since Yhwach who was born with soul distribution. If it's the first then we may have a lot more Yhwach-type Quincies roaming around. Ginjo might be one as other anons have pointed out.<br><br>They were never returned, if they had Ichigo's overall appearance would be different.</br></br>  <br>The personal Full-bring born from Ichigo's badge were taken by Ginjou and should still remain in Ginjou. But the base Full-Bring abilities remained in Ichigo and were displayed -according to Kubo- in the changes to his Shinigami attire and Zanpakuto in Shikai and Bankai before he had them reforged in the Royal Realm.</br>  <br>I don't think that's the case, this was already discussed here. <br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Ishida is outright stated to absorb the power,stabilize it, and give it back.</br>   Rukia looks like both Jugo and Yhwach <br> Her sister looks like her <br> Hisana died to a mysterious illness, much like those who Yhwach grants power to <br> Kaien and Ukitake died as well <br> Her powers are ice, the Quincy Palace was made of Ice (at least in that sketch) <br> The powers of Ichigo and everyone else jumpstarted as soon as Rukia came to Karakura <br> We have no clue who Rukia's parents are - they could be shinigami and/or quincy <br> We have no clue how she survived as a baby - Yhwach survived as a baby because people recognized his healing power <br> She was supposed to be the MC, who always is a special case in shonen </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she's not.</br>  <br>Never said she's wielding it.  sexual frustration is a hell of a drug </br>  <br>Oh. Well then. Damn.</br>  <br><br> Ichigo and his mother get attacked by Grand Fisher <br><br>  In a panic response it is Ichigo that inadvertently saps power from his mother in a fight or flight response to protect her. <br><br> Masaki, now powerless gets killed, and Ichigo having no clue how to use or even realize his powers is hopeless. <br><br>It didn't make sense to me, that at that moment Yhwach decided to take his powers back. It makes more sense that Ichigo could do it unwillingly at the present moment. I mean after all, he does have a bit of Ywach in him.<br><br>This would also explain why his dad got his powers back, cause like every non-Quincey around him, they seem to suck his energy up. <br><br>Alls I'm saying is, Ichigo is responsible for his mother's death, and that will be the big plot twist that Ichigo will have to hurdle over. The ruse cruise never ends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ichigo vs byakuya and ichigo vs grimmjow round 3.</br>  <br>I like your theory, Yhawch himself said that he killed his mother.</br>  <br> Ichigo was telling Rukia that he was the one who killed his mom <br> Turns out he actually was  <br>Rekt</br></br></br>  <br><br> Ichigo and everyone else learns of this simultaneously as Bach reveals it and so there will never be a talk between Ichigo and Rukia about it <br> they'll probably never interact again anyway <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>   rukiafags feeling threatened by the fact that Orihime was Ichigo's first sternritter. Now spewing retarded theories everywhere   <br> now <br>I've always been spewing retarded theories about mai waifu you know.<br><br>Don't be so antagonizing, silly anon.</br></br></br></br>  Didn't we actually see Masaki prepare her bow only for it to vanish? Ichigo couldn't of done that. Man, I wonder how much of a pussy Ichigo would of grown up to be if his mom hadn't died and had actually sniped fisher's head off like a badass before getting her powers taken.  <br>oh you silly troll, isshin and his sisters were his first sternritters, possibly even chad</br>  <br>Chad and Ori have a specific set of powers to be Ichigo's shields. Everybody else was just spiritualy awared.</br>  All right faggots, it's been a while since I dropped colored bleach and wanted to ask you people if there is any specific chapters you would like to have (Chapter 6 - Fullbringer arc), if I like it too, I would do it, I guess  at some point   <br>Rukia's flashback with Kaien</br>  <br> tfw when someone posts your image. <br>You've got top tier waifu taste as well, my brother.</br></br>  <br> which chapter </br>  <br>I second this. </br>  <br>Seraph Aizen</br>  <br>I just want Rukia back in the manga.

This girl has half of her school fawning after her, plenry of Rugonkai and some Shinigami too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of which, what does the armor do? Is it like the shinigami equivalent to the Thorbuster armor?</br>  <br><br>This used to be normal until cunts like you showed up, getting butthurt at the very sight of Rukia.<br><br>Being the wiser part in this conflict, we don't talk about Rukia that much anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>we dont anyway man. its just the hime fags reverse trollan. just like that isane faggot who showed up.</br>  It's just the poor bastards who have their interests set on other female characters that feel shadowed by the overbearing popularity and positive attention Rukia receives that they started up their own meme becoming the vocal majority of "Rukia is shit!" insults at even a single mention of her.  <br> It's not like she has some other love interest in the works. <br>Ishida and  dead guys don't count. </br></br>  <br>She isn't shit. She's just boring</br>  <br>She's the most interesting and fleshed out female character in the manga.</br>  <br>Its not that I'm butthurt at the very sight of Rukia, its just that Rukiafags are making threads shit with their cringefests</br>  <br>Yet she still manages to be one of the most plain and boring ones there</br>  <br>Orihime's spherical shield looks the same like Yhwach's Blut Vene Anhaben</br>  <br> who is yoruichi </br>  <br>Picture faggot.

According to spoilers  </br></br>  <br>Saint Seiya should be gayer than that.</br>  <br>I wonder if there will be another libra temple scene with Camus and Shura.</br>     miro isn't really kil <br>uwutm8?</br>  <br>And what is the thing Andreas has in his special room?</br>  <br> Will Shura die? <br>Yes<br>The only Gold Saints standing will be Aiolia,  Mu, Dohko and Saga :^) </br></br></br>  is this shit canon?  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>No  or yes if Utgard is really Titan </br>  <br>toei canon<br><br><br> implying DM isn't protected by the power of love </br></br></br></br>  Biweekly reminder that Utgard is really Kanon,  he  looks the same from behind.<br>Only forget the details about muh height and hair/eyes color.</br>  <br>Sounds gay but Toei is making a mistake if it's Shura the one who's going to make Camus realize his TRUE FEELINGS. <br>Fujos are very defensive of their Camus x Milo OTP.</br></br>  <br> muh hair eyes color <br>Dye and contacts.<br> muh height <br>I don't know, man.<br>Unless he's using one of his illusions all the time, I don't see it happening.</br></br></br></br></br>  Episode now available.

That wasn't so bad, I'm impressed.</br>  Not sure how I feel about Camus legitimately being a traitor, his characterization in this show is all off. I got all excited too when he talked about a sword of ice, but he was just talking about Aurora Execution, and not a new move. Oh well.  Those God Warriors have no chance against the Golds, this is a pretty underwhelming.  <br>Hopefully the bit about Baldr being an actual god will make next episode's fight more interesting.</br>  <br><br>Yea, Aldebaran embarrassed Hercules without even fully awakening his God Cloth. I expected the power up and purple aura to actually do something, but I guess it was a fake out.<br><br>If we keep going at the rate of 2 GWs per episode, that will leave us time to face the real final bosses that come from Ygdrasil.</br></br></br></br>  why the fuck are god warriors so shit?<br>or are god cloths broken as fuck?</br>  <br><br>God warriors were always shit, now the gold saints can finally put them in their place with the debuff field turned off.</br></br>  <br>I thought the sapphires were going to make them OP as fuck but instead they are getting clowned left and right.</br>  <br>The one who translated probably thought that when he said "ken" he meant 剣 instead of 拳</br>  <br><br>I laughed my ass off when I saw that shit, how humiliating.</br></br>  OST track listing shows that Kiki is going to show up at some point soon?

Fujos won't like it.</br></br></br>  what did Camus expect to happen after he defeated/he was beaten by Shura?  He is so broken by Shura getting killed   what happened to Lufia? <br><br>My poor waifu of the season.</br></br>  <br>It makes you wonder if someone at the writing desk is pushing their own OTPs.</br>  <br>Is Shijima in front of comatose Seiya?<br>Anyway, best SS news in a long time</br></br>  <br>Kanon NTR'd Aioria. <br>God make that happen</br></br>  <br>she didn't turn out to be a trap god, so we lost interest.</br>  Holy shit.<br><br>3 gorudo sainto are out of the game in one episode ?<br><br> Aldebaran's get captured was bullshit. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it appears that Shijima somehow ends up in present day sanctuary, and witnesses the gold sacrifice themselves to the wailing wall. Whether he's actually in the present or just projecting his soul remains to be seen.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everyone will be captured as soon as they clear their respective rooms.<br><br>So there are 2 rooms left and 3 golds wandering around and one M.I.A. , but only ONE God warrior left without a pair, how the hell will this play out?</br></br></br>  <br> He didn't job at all, so thats a win. </br>  <br>Yeah, big win for the taurus fans but they had no reason to get him captured other than easy plot progression.</br>  <br>Mu and Dohko have to survive if they're going to do the Athena Exclamation like in the OP.</br>  <br>Totally agree</br>  Shaka was looking extra moe in this episode.  <br>Aldebaran was out of fucks to give this episode.</br>    Why do you keep reminding me of better things Soul of Gold? <br>Is some sort of masochism?</br>  I like the implication that Mu's been spending this entire time just continually psychic bitchsmacking Fafner.  <br>Araki-sensei ;w;</br>  <br><br> Not even the crotch shot is good <br>Sometimes I wonder why do I keep watching this.</br></br></br>  <br>can't wair for next episode when Shaka will confirm he can kill Gods no problem</br>  <br>Why? What's the traduction?<br><br>I really hope the masked GW is not kanon</br></br></br>  <br>Shura looks like as in the SoG version.</br>  <br>Meaty looking thighs there, Camus.</br>  The thing i like about this ep the most aside from Camus action<br><br> God Warriors: WE ARE STRONGER NOW CAUSE OF ODIN SAPPHIRES <br> Gold Saints: Okay <br><br>and then they proceed to knock the God Warriors into a wall</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is implied that otherwise Gold Saint wouldn't even have a problem destroying most of the God Warriors. They seem to be slightly above a Silver Saint in power, maybe in equality to a Marine.<br>On the other hand, Andreas look upset about losing the statues, isn't that part of his plan?</br></br>  <br>who is the seiyu of masked guy in hell chamber? he seems a lot like Aiolos</br>  <br>I think Andreas is just in it for the shits and giggles at this point. He probably has bets going on each fight match-up.</br>  <br>Not Aiolos, i meant to say Seiya</br>  why is this show so terrible? the original series was gay as fuck but it certainly didn't suffer this much of QUALITY  <br>nah i dont doubt that the God Warriors arent close to Gold level but it was still hilarious</br>  <br> The thing i like about this ep the most aside from Camus action <br><br> &gt;God Warriors: WE ARE STRONGER NOW CAUSE OF ODIN SAPPHIRES <br> &gt;Gold Saints: Okay <br><br> and then they proceed to knock the God Warriors into a wall <br><br>And then we got a shit episode because it ain't about having good fights but just muh constellations</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The original series quality vary depending on the studio animating that week. But it had something SoG truly lack, and that's a good director.<br>Seriously, the general directing is as so basic and plain is boring.</br></br>  <br>Because that's the future of anime.</br>  <br>Especially as the moefags take over and anime gets more and more niche. Looking forward to a future of nicovideo streaming exclusives.</br>  <br>Did you truly expect it to be anything else, anon.</br>  <br>this am just waiting for the faggot to start a drinking game that correlates with how many people die in a chamber.</br>  <br>The twist is he's been broadcasting the fights all this time to an international audience and the GW are dying for nothing.

I hate Seiya</br>  We need a DxD thread. So let's have a DxD thread.<br><br>Reminder that all DxDs are a best  including Asia  but Rossweisse is super-best.<br><br>Recent news includes v20's cover being posted and v20 spoilers should be out in 15 days.<br><br>Oh yeah, and friendly reminder that DxD might get licensed in less than 72 hours.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The ride never ends.  bump  <br>will ishibumi finally out vali or is vali going to stay in the closet</br>  DxD has the best advertising.        <br>Ishibumi confirmed that Vali will be outed Vol 21</br>  anime only fag here. Does anyone know how well season 3 did in Japan? Like how high the viewer count was. I keep hearing that the anime did really well on kissanime but that doesn't contribute at all to money. <br> <br>Just asking to try and figure out the likeliness of a season 4.</br></br>  <br>vali x gaspar &lt;3</br>  Going on second hand reports preorders are doing well and season 4 should happen easily.    <br>would vali top or bottom?</br>  <br>bottom</br>    <br> Tfw no animated dulio </br>  <br>Hasn't gone on sale yet. Doesn't on on sale till the 24th.</br>  <br>Season 5 in a couple years.</br>  <br>Aye but he asked about viewer numbers. Since I have no idea about that I gave him the info we do have.</br>  Season 5 never ;_;  <br>Doesn't really matter in regards to sales. There were some series who ranked high in that regard, yet they flopped in sales.</br>  <br>I can see how that can happen, but it was the question asked. Also why I went with pre orders in my answer. <br><br>Almost all of us want there to be at least 2 more seasons. And this season answered an old question of mine about ending a season with vol 11 or vol 12. Without spoilering it, events in 11 are easily as important as vol 1.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Viewer count in Japan isn't available, but the BDs are expected to sell at least 5-7.5k, which is a definite success. Consider S4 pretty much guaranteed.</br></br>  <br>Good. Orifice is such a shitty fucking character and I'm tired of faggots in these threads obsessing over her.<br><br>She's Asia tier</br></br></br>  <br> Orifice  <br> shitty <br> Asia tier <br> Orifice <br><br>Here's your reply.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The butt is presented for your kiss.</br>  <br><br>The only reason you faggots like her is because she's autistic as fuck, just like you.</br></br>  <br>Incorrect. As stated in the OP all girls are best DxD.</br>  <br> Cutest loli and most daughter of all DxD <br> No fucks given attitude <br>Ophis is best.</br></br></br>  <br> Cutest loli <br><br>I love Ophis, but I have to give that title to Kunou or Le Fay.</br></br></br>  <br>Except that some girls are more best than others</br>  <br>Kunou is a very close second for cutest loli, imo.</br>        <br>who the fuck is gaspar?<br> also Gasper is one of the most straight guys around and already has a girlfriend so thats just silly </br></br>      <br>I hope we get another pic of buff Issei in v20.  Although I want colored Crom Cruach much more <br><br> Tfw you realize the BT version is cut above Kuroka's waist and Ravel's clothing is see-through </br></br></br>  <br> v20's cover </br>  <br>Is that... ASIA?!?</br>  <br>his gf is vali</br>    <br>It's Kuroka.</br>  <br><br>Silly anon. Can't you see the blonde hair? That's Le Fay.</br></br>  <br>I have to wonder if she is allowed to wear panties in that armor? What do you anons think?</br>   2015 <br> No TRPG DxD game based on rating games <br> No DxD fighting game <br> No DxD JRPG <br> No qt Xenovia to lay in the grass and stare at the stars with </br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't look like she's wearing any. I can't tell if Fafnir will be happy or sad.</br>  <br> WTF was Rias thinking when she choose to wore that outfit ? </br>  <br>She's being selfish thinking of seducing Issei when the guy is busy being tutored by Ravel.<br><br>Or she's just that confident in her body.</br></br></br>  <br>If Kuroka can be naked and Issei has no nosebleed then it's alright to her.<br/></br>  <br>Nothing like that. She just wore that because she can.<br><br>All the females, including Griselda, are wearing swimsuits and are lounging around the underground pool after their meeting with the DxD group.</br></br></br>  <br>Another question is how effective will Asia be in battle armor? Her strength for her healing is her kind nature, but that seems like a detriment in a direct fight. Maybe she'll take a cue from Issei and Ddraig and let Fafnir be in control of the fighting?</br>  <br>I thought Griselda was wearing her habit? She didn't expect to be swimming right? Along with Dulio and Tobio.</br>  <br>She has Gate of Pansu.</br>  <br>It'll probably be something to up her defense and evasion at the same time so she won't need to be looked after by everyone on the battlefield.</br>  <br>If you got it, flaunt it.</br>  <br>Nah. Bikini. <br>The pool scene is close to the current translation. With the rate the translator is going, most likely after the next update.<br><br><br>Unlimited Breast Works &gt; Gate of Pantsu</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you still on the internet CG ISE, didn't you make a wish to date every single female heroic spirits in the Throne?</br>  <br>Which volume are we talking about? Because I'm thinking the side story one. I still don't think the nun wore a bikini to a swimming party she didn't expect. Heck Kuroka and Le Fay are there and they're not wearing bikinis either.</br>  <br>Faker.</br>  <br>Oh. I was talking about the pool scene in v19. Tobio and Dulio are there too.<br><br>The anon that I replied to has an illustration of Rias and Ravel from v19.</br></br></br>    <br> Tobio and Dulio are there too <br>What were they doing there?</br></br>  <br>Holy fucking shit Akeno is so hot. Best DxD</br>  <br>They had a meeting with Issei and Rias showing new techniques.<br><br>The people present are the people living in the Gremory group, Dulio, Griselda, Tobio, Vali Team (except Fenrir and Gogmagog)</br></br></br>  <br>Not so hard to guess as they are both part of the greater DxD anti terrorist team and the Hyuodo residence is a major HQ for them.</br>  <br>I see. Thanks.</br>  <br>Forgot to mention, an anon was saying there was the oiling sessions by Issei that the girls were fighting over for who would be first in line. Then Ravel makes a schedule since she wanted to be oiled by Issei as well. Ross apparently nabs one of the first slots by the way.</br>  <br>Seriously? Less than a week after BorN ending for all the "I want to marry Rias" and "Akeno a shit" to just vanish? Are people allowed to like Akeno now without sperg rage?</br>  <br>Source my ass</br>  <br>Assiagamesh</br>  <br>How are Issei's family paying the property taxes on that thing?</br>  <br>Not quite what happened.<br><br> Issei is putting oil/lotion or whatever you call it on both Rias and Akeno <br> Rias said they should continue on the bathroom <br> Akeno said they'd continue on the bedroom <br> Irina and Rose quipped that they too want to be put on some oil by Issei. <br><br>Then, Ravel interjected saying that Issei is a busy person and there is no time for him to put oil on multiple people.<br><br>Rias suggested that she should join as well. After hearing that, Ravel modified Issei's schedule to put in the oiling session with the girls.<br><br>After that, the remaining girls also showed interest and want to be scheduled as well.<br><br><br>v20 is supposed to be Vali's. Ishibumi changed it because there are lots of important things in v20 and it is just proper for the MC to have it. v21 will be Vali's.<br><br>All is from Ishibumi's twitter and blog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't, Rias paid for them, she could give them a mountain if they wanted.</br>  <br>Well since the cover story is that it's a model home for the Gremory, I think it's safe to assume the Gremory handle those small details. Pretty sure they can afford it.</br>  <br>With Rias integrated to the family I think the Hyoudou's problems won't include money<br> Hey Hyoudou-san, heard your family was rolling in cash now. What happened? <br> Nothing much. My son fucked his rich girl and now she's engaged to him. <br> So it's one of those Chinese family marriages? I'm sorry for your son. <br> Not really. More like there's too many marriages about to happen... </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Issei is filthy rich himself now, so he can probably pay it him self as well.</br>  <br>True, but his parents don't know that.</br>  <br> Paying taxes <br>Imagine the damn electricity and water expenditures, it's like running an hotel<br><br><br>I hope so, going around punching people kinda ruins her character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh and also Grayfia won't let him go hog wild anyway.</br>  <br> it's like running an hotel <br>Ravel be looking at the ledger of the house<br> Why do we need 50 boxes of condoms? </br></br></br>  <br>Ravel of all people should know why they do.</br>  <br>Kuroka!</br>  <br><br>Wait if DxD Ex is canon then why would they need condom?</br></br>  <br>she goes through 50 boxes per day</br>  <br>Gasper doesn't want kids yet and right now his girlfriend can't say no.</br>  <br>gasper doesnt need condoms if hes fucking men</br>  <br>He has a GF as shown here. </br>  <br>pretty sure he's her gbf</br>  <br>Does Valerie even see Gasper that way?</br>  <br> link on the box <br>Does it work?</br></br>  <br>Nope. Wait 10 more volumes and Val'll be in the harem while Gaspie cheers her on.</br>  <br>I'm still mad Issei's dragon swag took Sona out from Saji.</br>  <br>That dragon aura is weapon of mass destruction.</br>  <br>Nah, don't think Sona sees Issei that way.<br><br>I almost want Serafall to go with Issei and Sona with Saji just so the bros can be bro-in-laws.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not happening, already too many girls in the harem as is. And if you add more girls, things will become too much of a clusterfuck, then people will bitch and moan that their preferred girl is being shafted. Also the additions will feel forced among others, especially since Sona said she only wants someone that is smarter than her, and that Gasper owes so much to Valerie regarding their past, just wouldn't make sense.</br></br>  <br>No worry, Saji had unlocked armor in vol 17 so dragon swag is coming for him.</br>  <br>Really? I'm seeing signs pointing to Sona wanting to be with Issei.<br><br><br>I know it doesn't make sense but when has Issei made sense with all that he's done?<br> only wants someone that is smarter than her <br>I can totally see Issei getting smarter for the high class devil rank test and exceeding expectations by a mile.<br><br><br>Sure hope so, the dude's been busting ass for her. I hope Ishibumi lets the guy notice Hanakai and Ruruko. Maybe get a few ideas from Issei and form his own harem as well?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not really, the whole concept is coming from people who are looking to much into those little moments when they really have nothing romantic implied. And you know those Saji/Sona moments that happened in BorN? I guarantee Ishibumi had something to do with those being shown since he helped with the changes.<br><br> I can totally see Issei getting smarter for the high class devil rank test and exceeding expectations by a mile. <br><br>Yeah, really doubt that happens. If Rias can't match Sona in that area, do you really think Issei has any chance of accomplishing that, no matter how much time passes? Would really be forced in that regard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the opposite<br><br>The reason for adding more girls into the harem is simple to understand since this is a cockblocking series and issei's done fucking everything other than sex with his core harem. This severely limits how much more development can be made.<br><br>If ishibumi only focuses on the pre-existing harem, people are going to whine about the plot getting repetitive real quick since there's only so many times you can read about asia getting kidnapped or akeno having daddy issues and it makes the roadblock at sex much more visible.<br><br>Adding more harem members is just an illusion to keep the series fresh since, say, if a MILF gets added in vol 22 or something, everyone's going to be talking and speculating again.<br><br>That said, there's still a lot of harem girls without much development like Le Fay who got introduced a dozen volumes ago and we know nothing about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's that, the novel is something else. Off the top of my head Sona calls Issei by his first name and has only shown him besides her family her body in a swimsuit. This could always be nothing but I can't help but doubt.<br> Would really be forced in that regard. <br> Boost! <br> Transfer! <br> Issei's brain gets smarter as a result <br>I'm still worried.<br><br><br>I think there's something as too much. The sweet spot of a harem for me is 6-10 girls. Anything else is too much unless it's for gag purposes like Touma's clone following.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The plot's already repetitive and people keep lapping it up so I don't see why it should be a concern. Hell, Japan was split between loving or being neutral on the anime original shit from BorN so it's not like it matters. They clearly have no standards.</br>  <br>That's not saying much seeing as we watch the same shit they do.<br><br>Or do you want them to stop producing just because of one shitty season? I certainly don't want it to end unlike Index. A shitty series is always better than no series.</br></br></br>  <br> Or do you want them to stop producing just because of one shitty season? <br><br>Yes. They've shown themselves to be completely inept in handling it.</br></br></br>  <br>The negative of your statement is that the plot will take a back seat if you add more girls, also the current Arc is already reaching the climax involving Trihexia and Great Red. Not to mention Ishibumi is testing the waters to see how a potential sequel will fare in the EX story line, which means we may be getting close to the ending of DxD. The Asia getting kidnapped and the Akeno daddy issues are already over and done with. Especially since Asia is getting that power up in Vol.20 and Ishibumi said that future volumes will focus on the main four as well as Kuroka and Le Fay. There's already 9 girls in the harem(Kunou is a regional wife) focus on them, really make them standout in regards to how other harems handle their girls.</br>  <br> completely inept <br>Oh a troll. Okay then.</br></br>  <br> I don't like your opinion so you're a troll <br><br>Half of S2 was shoddy.<br>S3 was shit.<br><br>Crawl out of your hugbox mentality, you autistic little bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I had your negative mentality we'd be out of anime to watch already. That's how negative I am on the animation department. I keep complaining about it yet I don't want it to end.<br> Crawl out of your hugbox mentality, you autistic little bitch. <br>You should be grateful someone's answering you on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>We're getting another "waah save Asia" thing in Ex so I don't know that being finished.</br>  <br> yet <br>*but</br></br>  <br>Seems like a good time to debut this.<br><br>If you don't like it why would you be in a DxD thread?<br><br>On 4chan the answer is troll.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the franchise.<br>I do not like Season 3 or how it was handled.<br>Find the stick firmly lodged up your own asshole.<br>And either remove it or shove it up even further and hopefully impale your brain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People are saying that EX takes place after BorN or Vol.7 at the time. So before Vol.9, which is why only a couple of Issei's kids he has with the girls are present. I'm not so sure if that's the case however, but we will see on the 24th. And saving Asia is more of a secondary objective to the main, which is stopping the event which causes the future war from happening.</br>  <br>Ok I can deal with a well articulated opinion. I withdraw my claim of troll. That said I disagree with you but we can handle that.</br>  Who is collecting all short stories, PDFs and epubs in preparation for the death of the LN in two days?  <br>Did it a month ago.</br>  <br>Fuck, I waited too long and now I'm freaking out because the epub generator is down.<br>Care to share the spoils?</br></br>  <br><br> Vali won't touch her </br></br>  <br>Konozama.co is Japan's Amazon, or something like that.</br>  <br>Shut up white boy.<br>I hope you get fired when you ever get a job because you messed up scanning the papers.</br></br>  <br> epub generator is down </br>  <br>Vali's team is currently a sausage fest.<br><br>Just as planned.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean this?<br><br>http://ln.m-chan.org/v3/<br><br>Alright, let me see what I can do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Holy shit, these arguments are a waste of your time. Objectively, Season 3 was bad. However, why can't someone give criticisms of a series they don't like? Why can't that person bring up negative criticisms in a thread relevant to the series? Trivial kids, man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one was disagreeing with you saying S3 was bad. They're disagreeing because you said TNK shouldn't produce anymore with their work on S3.<br><br>That's more immature than repeatedly telling you "it's just one season, it'll get better, they've learned their lesson."</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what? This is my first comment on their little autism-fest. I am just barging into the conversation. I am just defending an /a/non.</br>  I believe we are also getting this..<br>https://lnresource.wordpress.com/</br>  <br>A person CAN give a criticism, but a poorly worded on may backfire.</br>  <br>What is this? Homoeroticism for ants?</br>  <br>Whoops. Missed that! Thank you kind anon!</br>  I wonder if any of the next Sitri rating game will be shown next season?  <br>If they want to get the Rias-Sairaorg fight, then they should.<br><br>From a round robin format, it changed to single elimination and Sona and Seekvaira were seeded.</br></br></br>  <br>I just feel that Sona's development got slighted by the S3 changes,</br>  <br>Sitri rating game then Kyoto.<br><br>I still think TNK should try a 2 cour season.</br></br></br>  <br> I still think TNK should try a 2 cour season. <br><br>That's the thing, being a lower tier studio means their are limited on what they can do. A 2 cour is too much for the studio to handle, also they more than likely don't have the money to back it up.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if alternating between the Sitri and Gremory games could work instead? I mean they ARE supposed to be taking place at the same time.<br><br>I kinda like this idea actually.</br></br></br>  <br>Would only work if they stop the Sitri game stuff around the time Issei nearly OHKO's Kuisha.</br>  <br>Not necessarily, After all who knows WHAT kind of emotional wringer Saji went through in that game? Done right it could actually ADD to the series.</br>  <br>What volume's the pic?</br>  <br>Vol.5</br>  <br>Licensed for what? English translations?</br>  <br>Yep, people are speculating that Yen Press will make the announcement that they have licensed the light novel during Anime Expo. It makes sense since they licensed the manga already.</br>  <br>Light novel akeno &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anime akeno</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>They just put no time into her character in the anime</br>  <br>they were just like<br>lets balance everything instead of improving what people like the show for</br></br>  Harem anime = otaku NERD  <br>They didn't even balance it. Honestly I started the light novel as a joke and it ended up being really really interesting. The anime is stupid but thats why I like it. Besides The third season which just butchers the source material for no reason.</br>  <br>These are the cons of TNK. Can't produce a two cour or 15 episode season, and since they wanted season 4 to adapt Vol.9&amp;10 and season 5 to adapt Vol.11&amp;12, they had to this this. But changing the story line didn't make any sense. They could've added the Rias/Issei dynamic albeit in a different way, and introduced Loki earlier as well but instead of sealing him at the banquet, have him retreat for the showdown at the end of the season.</br>  Chapter 3-2 of -SLASHDOG- has been translated.      <br>Irina's tits aren't that big plus she's not a rook.</br>  <br>They are that big</br>  <br>What's your point?</br>  Anyone getting the figure(s)?    <br>The rook part is a quirk of the card line. All characters are assigned chess pieces, even if they clearly don't apply. Heck sometimes they slip up and use different pieces for the same character.</br>  <br>I still think Irina's tits aren't that big.</br>    <br>The recent cards certainly have the tits of the girls drawn much bigger.</br>  <br>And you absolutely have the right to that opinion, but your argument is with the artist and not with me anon.</br>  <br>personally I like em that way.</br>  <br>Post more Irina, I need some motivation to continue reading DxD and the last time I read it, it's still Irina volume ch 1</br>    <br>I don't even watch this but that art looks gorgeous.</br>    <br>Asia got ripped?</br>  <br>I think since shes leaning forward, her stomach is making that appearance.</br>  <br><br>fat.</br></br>  <br>cat</br>  <br>tats.</br>  Requestijg Raynere or her alter ego pictures.  <br>Requesting* my bad.</br>  <br><br><br>http://hsddmobage.blog.fc2.com/blog<wbr>-category-38.html</wbr></br></br></br>  Random ract : Rias's father has a harem of his own as well but is being managed by venelara(Rias's mother)  <br>fact*</br>  <br>Link?</br>  <br>That is true Scooby- anon. (Sorry couldn't help myself.)</br>  <br>That's on v10.</br>  <br>I believe it's in vol 10, so in anime terms next season.</br>  <br>So in Issei's case will Ravel still be his manager?</br>  Ishibumi updated his blog.<br> There will be no such thing as Asia hitting her opponents. Her abilities will always be friendly. <br> You can continue reading the main Volumes even without knowing what is on EX. <br> Unfortunately, there will be no new short stories for 6 months. The September issue and EX will be the last, for now. <br> Slashdog will resume by the end of the year. <br><br><br><br>No. Rias is.<br><br>Ravel is just Issei's manager regarding the business stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really need to fuckin reread this shit before it gets taken down.</br></br>  <br> &gt;There will be no such thing as Asia hitting her opponents. Her abilities will always be friendly. <br><br>I  nailed it.</br></br></br>  <br>So YP will really take this down. I thought it's only a speculation since they will announce their next line up.</br>  <br>Only speculation. A speculation that always rises when an something concerning A.) DxD or B.) an event related to anime comes up.</br>  <br>Actually he *did* have a harem. But Venerana broke it up and drove away all the other girls long ago. It is stated that demons in the Gremory line are known to have a particularly strong love and this can translate to being promiscuous. Though neither Rias, nor Zirsechs have ever appeared to me that way and little Mr DragonEdge outright condems that sort of behavior.</br>  <br>Just how fine are these Gremory ladies that the husbands don't complain about it? <br>Do they all have some special demonic bed techniques that make them obey their every command?</br></br>  <br>Venerana is a Baal and she's quite domineering. Rias on the other hand isn't, so doing something like that is out of the question for her. Not only is she friends with the majority of the haremettes, but they frequently try to and some times succeed in stealing a march on her. Even Irina who isn't a devil and gets minimal screen time manages to get ahead.</br>  <br>Speaking of Baal, are there any women gunning for Sairaorg besides his queen?</br>  <br> besides his queen? <br>When did Kuisha show interest in the muscle dick?</br></br>  <br> She’s a woman with strong resolution. That person, she must have feelings for Sairaorg….. <br>Volume 10</br></br>  <br>This looks more like Tail Yellow's armor, actually</br>   Issei's parents will die this volume   <br>Absolutely, this tweet claims that V20 is best read alone and that you're definitely going to cry.<br><br>https://twitter.com/hatano_j/status<wbr>/616900549435265024</wbr></br></br></br>    <br> DxD becomes the GoT of anime </br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br> moonrune <br>I'm not 11th anon, translation please?</br></br>  <br>Blah blah promo shit.<br><br>"I recommend that you read it alone. Do not read in the train because you're going to cry! Love overflows!"</br></br></br>  <br>this will probably end up meaning issei and the gang will just move to the underworld as soon as they are done with school.<br><br><br>Still they better get some nice send off, they fucking deserve it for being some of the best parents in history.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't but help but think that it's a throwback to vol 4, when Vali threatened to kill Issei's parents to give him the motivation and strength to fight him on more even terms.</br>  <br> "I recommend that you read it alone. Do not read in the train because you're going to cry! Love overflows!" <br>Doubt that, he's going to troll us again, and reading on the train? Seriously Ishibumi?</br></br>  <br> Vali threatens to do it <br> Rizevim actually does it <br>Well played, Ishibumi.</br></br></br>  <br>The tweet isn't even from Ishbibumi.</br>  <br>The guy is Hatano Jun, an editor and a collaborator for the anime. I think you can say that he's legit.</br>  <br>I know. I said that as it seems like the anon is under the impression that the tweet is from Ishibumi and is self-hyping his work.</br>  <br><br>But they got a grail so unless Rizevim killed them and revived them first I don't see why this could create any drama.</br></br>   all this fear about parents dying <br> forgetting Asia's balance breaker <br> healing doesn't break the balance of nature <br> &gt;but resurrection does </br></br></br>  <br>Do you not understand how that grail works? Every time it's used Valerie loses her sanity more and more, and she's already at the brink. Other people may die and Issei might have to make the tough decision.</br>  <br>Then the old church guy gave her a part of the grail is just to cure her?</br>  <br>That piece was for emergencies, but it still hurts her.</br>  <br>The piece is just to wake her up. The piece itself does nothing.<br><br>Valerie will be doing the resurrection with Sephiroth Graal.</br></br></br>  <br>There's two people she has to wake up. Who does she choose, or does Issei let his parents rest in peace?<br><br>I still think it's Asia's turn to do this. You guys don't listen yet I've been saying this for quite a while now.</br></br></br>  <br>Ishibumi isn't gonna do something as cliche as turning healing into resurrection. Seriously.</br>  <br>And I also can't imagine Asia donning BB armor only to get defense and evasion. Ishibumi already said she can't attack.<br><br>Resurrection is fine if done right. We already experienced it once. Heck, DBZ didn't get worse even after all the wishes they've done for resurrection.</br></br></br>  <br> Asia donning BB armor <br>Balance breaker is not an armor, it can be an armor but is not always one hell its not even usually armor. <br><br>The armor is clearly fafnir just like Azazel used him back during the meeting of the powers so it probably has nothing to do with her healing powers and its just an extension of her dragon afinity .</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you think her BB is then? Because besides her skill at healing which is max I can't think of anything besides resurrection.<br><br>BB are usually an increase of power or a gamebreaking skill. Resurrection for healing makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Cao Cao's BB had no relation to the passive ability of the True Longinus, so not always. Ishibumi is clever at making up ideas for powerups.</br>  <br>No idea, i was pointing out that the armor has nothing at all to do with her sacred gear.<br><br>Balance Breaker is actually a "fuck everything" kind of thing, so its not always a plain powerup of the basic powers, specially with issei around who is known to influence the abnormal growth of power in his allies.</br></br></br>  <br> I'll protect it, i'll definitely protect it. ―― Asia Argento <br><br> Ise-san! <br> I will fight as well! <br> Erotic <br> For Asia to fight as vanguard....I won't allow such a thing! <br> I mean it's Asia...! <br><br>Yeap. It's resurrection.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> badass armor gets reduced to bikini armor </br>  <br> Asia's jewels are red instead of purple </br>  I would x her DDs so hard.  <br>Looks like cards received more budget than anime.</br>  <br>I totally would 24/7.</br>  <br>It doesnt really have to mean anything ,It could be Miyama fucking up again, or they were purple because of Azazel or that because this is probably a new contract with fafnir the armor is not the same as it was with down fall dragon.<br><br>The DFD armor design is probably my favorite out of the scale mail armors in the series so seing it turned into bikini armor is kinda heart breaking, lets hope that at least this means Asia starts being more than just a walking first aid kit with a bullseye painted on her back... also lets hope it bring more crazy Fafnir shenanigans .<br> Asia starts wearing it and then cant take it off , ask fafnir how to take it off and he sais she HAS to get hot a sweaty for the armor to come off </br></br></br></br>    <br> best read alone <br> you're definitely going to cry <br><br>I... I don't even think they said that for v11/12 ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeap. It's resurrection. <br> There will be no such thing as Asia hitting her opponents. Her abilities will always be friendly. <br> taking the "I will fight" line literally <br>Keep drinking that delusional kool aid brother.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Must be like Tsubaki or Dulio's anti battle will again.</br>  Well one thing that could really push Asia into BB would be Issei's parents dying. She is an orphan and they just up and took her in and did ALL the parental stuff she fantasized about for her, They really went above and beyond.   Rizevim can stop the effects of Sacred Gears <br> Asia's BB <br> Holy Grail is a Sacred Gear <br>If he kills Issei's parents, can't he just do something to make them immune to Sacred Gears?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends how his ability works. We know pretty much nothing about its origins or whether it can be transferred.</br>  thetimehascomeandsohaveI.jpg      <br>Then that means only 10 western Asia fans will cry. West don't like Asia.</br>  <br>Issei's parents dying is sad in and of itself, no matter how much it affects Asia. West won't like seeing all the other girls in tears.<br><br> I'm actually happy this is looking less and less like a fake death </br></br></br>  <br>am i the only person that don't get it with all these hair styles of the girls from dxd?</br>  <br>If you don't get it, then you have nothing to worry about anon.</br>  <br>i wanna get it, i'm that curious, source for it mate would appreciate it</br>  <br><br>Have you ever played the flash game Super Deep Throat? The hair models are to make the girl look like DxD characters.</br></br>  <br>You're missing out.  https://d.maxfile.ro/indvpskhup.png<wbr></wbr> </br>  So was s3 any good? stopped watching it on episode 4.  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/indvpskhup.pn<wbr>g</wbr> <br>ok link please i wanna play :D</br></br>  <br>It was decent aside from animation through episode 9. Then everything went to shit in the final 3 episodes. You can just watch 1-9 and call it a season.</br>  <br>With the way you type? No.</br>  Friendly reminder that DxD might get licensed in 48 hours. Just gotta get the short stories and v18 PDF (plus the epubs if generator is back up).  Not like the translation will get taken down or anything     <br>So what actually happens if it gets licensed? And why would they nuke fan translations without any product to sell? Walk me through this please.</br>  <br> So what actually happens if it gets licensed? <br><br>In most situations, translator-kun drops the series for fear of legal action. zxzxzx said he'd continue translating as long as there's no significant threat of that.<br><br> And why would they nuke fan translations without any product to sell? <br><br>DMCAs start rolling out as soon as the translation does, and Baka-Tsuki takes down their translation very quickly after it's announced to be licensed (to avoid getting into that legal mess).<br><br>Basically, what'll happen is that translations will continue, but BT won't host them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on the fan translators themselves. They might just do it still, such as with Danmachi and SAO, but host it on another site. If/when DxD gets licensed, Baka-tsuki will nuke it right off their site immediately. As I said, it's completely up to the fan translators if they will continue, as it's technically illegal to do it once it's licensed because Yen Press is a nazi with their shit. Just to be safe, download the pdf's/epub's because you'll have a rougher time finding them once it's licensed.</br>  <br><br>Thank you for your kind explanations anon.

Also try to convince him to take on another name, for safety reasons.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm on it. But what good would changing names do? Wouldn't he still be "wanted" under whatever new name he chooses to go by?</br>  <br>Remove any association with previous personas, declare that he has abandoned the project publicly and thus erase his trail. I've done this before.</br>  <br>Is YP really this bad?</br>  <br>Honestly, I was thinking more along the lines of continuing translations like SAO does. Remove the earlier volumes as YP publishes them, keep a PDF set in the back, and continue translating the later volumes publicly.</br>  <br>Yes, they killed the danmachi blog and any attempt to restart the Haruhi translation also gets viciously persecuted. Mahouka has gone under ground and luckily Spice and Wolf was almost finished when they picked it up.</br>  Hey. I scanned the English publication of AX a while ago, so I'll be dumping it.
