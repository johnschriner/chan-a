[  My whole life was Unlimited Blade Works <br>Wow, fucking really ufotable?</br>  That was in the VN too, now stop making obvious troll threads.  <br>You've only watched the DEEN anime and Fate/Zero, right?</br>          <br>We need one of those for Shirou's UBW.</br>    <br> Now you've done it! You've become a Puella Magi, Madoka Magica! <br>Dropped instantly, I can't believe people call this a masterpiece.</br></br>  <br>I like this one.</br>  Is there an Angry Manjew evilness mental breakdown bait?   /v/tards bringing in their shitty may mays   My whole life was Unlimited Rin Works  <br>I thought this is /tv/ meme?</br>  <br> not seven proxies </br>   My whole life was overrated shit with a circle-jerking fanbase  <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br>It is. Everyone steals from /tv/.</br>  "My name is Charlotte"<br><br>Bravo PA Works</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your shit OP</br>  <br> circle-jerking fanbase  <br>Hilarious coming from a puppet repeating maymays in order to try and fit in, go and kill thyself you dumb loser.</br></br>  <br>That's shit. Here, have a better one.</br>  <br>That IS for Shirou.</br>  <br>No, this is Archer's chant.</br>  <br>I am the bone of my bait <br>Bait is my body and bait is my blood <br>I have created over a thousand baits<br>Unaware of mods, nor aware of discussion<br>Withstood pain to create baits, waiting for OP to deliver <br>I have no regrets. This is the only path<br>My whole life was Unlimited Bait Works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet the image is of Shirou. Maybe that's the bait.</br>     So you won't talk huh? Looks like I'll have to Kill la Kill you! <br><br>Seriously trigger?</br></br>  Someone should do fall semester mike to read "did you mean bait?"    <br>That line wasn't in UFO's adaptation.</br>  <br>I am the Bane of Gotham.<br>Darkness is my body and fire is my blood. <br>I have crashed over a thousand planes, <br>Unknown to CIA, nor known to Batman. <br>Have withstood pain to take many masks off <br>Yet, this crash will never have any survivors.<br>So, as I pray, unlimited Bane works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>     My whole life was the infinte creation of swords. <br>I'M GONNA KILL YOU CRUNCHYROLL</br>  <br>Yes it was, Crunchymongrel.</br>  <br>I guess that True Assassin&amp;Berserker are the only ones without their own b8image.</br>  <br>It wasn't. He explicitly refers to his body being made of infinite swords in that scene.</br>  <br>Why does he look so innocent and not like a crazy sociopath in this image?</br>  My whole life was /a/   We finally did it Asuka... We finally reached the end... of Evangelion <br>I can't believe I sat through 26 episodes of this shit</br>  <br>Not to mention<br> I've got to find out who Kill La Killed my dad </br></br>    <br/>  <br>Nice work OP, all those great fate related bait pictures.<br><br>Bait Stay Out</br></br></br>  <br>At first I felt bad for making such a shitty thread, but it's summer and I thought "why the fuck not?". I definitely don't regret it.</br>  <br>The term "無限の剣製" is used in both the VN and the anime. The most literal translation for this is "infinite creation of swords", but the official romanization is "Unlimited Blade Works" (アンリミテッドブレイドワークス).<br>More over, some of the promo material literally quotes "...I have no regrets. This is the only path/ My whole life was Unlimited Blade Works"<br><br>Seriously, fuck off Crunchymongrel secondary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aniplex typically puts out a crude sub script for the initial broadcast and then revise it after the fact. Also, a more professional script is usually used for the BD release.</br>  <br>Why does he look so innocent and not like a  fancy gentleman  in this image?</br>  <br>“Their lines may cut, but the fish still see my bait! These men are my fishing buddies – my loyal fishermen! They’re my true friends - breaking the rules of 4chan and /a/ to fish once more at my side!”<br><br>“They are my worms on hooks; they’re my right to bait! They make up Anon's most triggering bait – Ionian Baitroi!!”</br></br></br>  <br>12 baiters and tsubame kouji</br>    <br>wait, fake assassin has one?</br>  I need Bait of Honer.<br> everything you touch turns to bait </br>  <br> The term "無限の剣製" is used in both the VN and the anime <br>That's not the line he uses. The anime and VN use この体は、無限の剣で出来ていた which doesn't translate to "my whole life was unlimited blade works." It's no wonder the FSN translation gets shat on so much. Crunchy roll did people a favor using a more proper translation as opposed to using the garbage Takajun shat out.</br></br>  <br>Not 100% sure but I remember seeing one with him.</br>    <br>RIN A BEST!</br>  <br>But which Rin is the bestest?<br><br> HF Rin &gt; Fate Rin &gt; UBW Rin </br></br></br>  <br>Broest of bros.</br>  <br> Crunchy roll did people a favor using a more proper translation as opposed to using the garbage KINOKI NASU shat out. </br>  Bazett needs one of these images. <br> Answerer: That Which Posts Later Baits First  <br>Is just too perfect.</br></br>  <br>All Rins are best.</br>  <br>Nobody actually wants anything to do with /tv/. <br>/tv/ is literally a shitpost memeboard who have nothing else better to do but spam their memes on other boards for the sake of getting it out there with examples being Brendan Fraser,Baneposting, and this thread</br></br>    <br>I hope to see it one of these days</br>  <br> All Fate girls a best. <br> I still need to read Tsuki since lods of those girls look good too. </br></br>  <br>Hisui is best meido and best Tsuki.</br>  <br> literally a shitpost memeboard <br><br>You mean like /a/ before it chopped its own balls off?</br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/FB7QS8v9EEo  [ ]<br><br> Implying this song doesn't bring tears to you're eyes </br></br>   I guess this was the choice of Steins;Gate <br>wait</br>  Why does the Fate/stay night fanbase hate Unlimited Blade Works, again?  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LIl<wbr>eIBSm_zc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>fuck you  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Vocal minority as always.</br>  <br> Why do the most autistic Fate fans on MAL hate UBW again <br>You mean this right?</br></br>  <br> song <br>If it had lyrics :^)</br></br>    <br>I know I don't.</br>  <br>They mostly don't, but there's the VERY vocal minority. Also<br> Assuming that a vocal minority on fucking 4chan actually means anything in the grand scheme of things. </br></br>    <br>They ruined Shirou's rich progression as a character.

Ask any VN reader and they'll tell you how Ufotable ruined Shirou and Caster's characters. The director is also an amateur who ruined both UBW and KnK6 (abysmal compared to their source materials) http://myanimelist.net/people/12167<wbr>/Miura_Takahiro</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read the VN. You're talking about the people on MAL lead by the cookingpriest. /a/, beastlair, and even reddit VN readers mostly enjoyed the anime with many having parts that they thought were much better than the anime.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>We need<br><br>Baitaniya<br>Subaitme gaeshi<br>All the bait in this world<br>Ionioi Baitoroi<br>Bait of Honor</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>VN reader here. I can confirm that Ufotable ruined  nothing. THIS IS BAIT ___________________________________<wbr>___________________________________<wbr>________</wbr></wbr> </br>   Miia?  <br> No Darling, I have become the Monster Musume no iru nichijou. <br><br>Fuck you Okayado that was terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is being a VN reader so well regarded in this fanbase, again? Do we get a medal or something?</br>  <br><br>Do you realize that's not a fault of the source material but bad adapting on Ufotable's part?</br></br>  <br> not reading the VN </br>  <br>Nice shitposting.</br>  <br>You can redeem your smugness at the complementary gift shop. They sell tiny Excalibur knives and Gay bulge tea stirrers.</br>  <br>Being a reder is always well regarded. Adaptations are for plebs, a real man reads the original story.</br>  <br>So you're saying that Ufotable's bad adapting made UBW better than it was in the VN? This is a bad thing why?</br>  <br>But I read it at a time when all we had was the UBW movie and 2006 anime, there was no other choice, anon-senpai!</br>  <br>If you think UBW was badly adapted, try watching Zero or DEEN's adaptations.</br>  <br>I'm kinda surprised he's not 150 lbs. fatter at this point.</br>  <br>Because it's the difference between being ignorant and not ignorant. The most common complaints about UBW pretty much all come down to people not understanding that they were watching an adaptation of a visual novel route as opposed to a whole story. If the adaptation ends up being good, expect Heaven's Feel to have much better reception than UBW, at least in the west, because more people will at that point understand the kind of story they're actually watching.</br>  <br>you can stop now</br>  <br>/tv/ went to shit when it stopped being the board of the pedophiles, those guys were at least fun.<br>Now is just Bane spamming and capeshit threads.</br></br>    <br>You can say something is not retarded because it was in the VN.</br>  <br> All the bait in this world <br>Now that would be cool.</br></br>  <br>Even in the fucking key visual.</br>  Shinji, not even once.  <br> &gt;  HF Rin &gt; Fate Rin &gt; UBW Rin <br> implying UBW rin with her dere dere kissu makes her best rin instantly. </br></br>      <br>What about Heaven's Feel?</br>  <br><br> Shinji saved humanity from Gil-kun <br>I expected as much from Wakame-kun.</br></br></br>  <br>Completely irrelevant.</br>  <br>Snack.</br>  <br>As relevant as midcard jobbers.</br>  <br> hating the cutest fate </br>  <br>why are all those vile vixens in a picture with glorious rin?</br>  <br><br> All the bait in this world <br>sounds good to me<br>but what image would you base it on?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know it's a bit goofy sounding, but it kind of does make sense.</br>  <br>Substitute the fish for Gil</br>  <br>Pick a random Angry Manjew image</br>  <br>Original &gt; Imitation<br><br>Source Material = Original<br>Adaptation = Imitation<br><br>Therefore<br><br>Source Material &gt; Adaptation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you that anon who made some of them?</br>  <br> Original &gt; Imitation </br>  <br><br>So Nasu just doesn't know English or does being chunni mean you can translate things however you want?</br></br>    <br>Shows up three times, tries to play the hero and save his humans since only he may judge them, and complete fucks it up.</br>  <br><br>Let's be honest, "my whole life was unlimited blade works" sounds way cooler.</br></br>  Which was the correct path?  <br>There are two versions of the UBW chant.<br><br>Technically four versions really, since each version of it has two translations due to ruby text.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. <br><br>Saying "This body was an infinite source of blades" is also pretty cool.</br></br></br>  <br>The one where he achieves a miracle so neither.</br>  <br>I really don't think it does, but I'm genuinely curious about this issue since when I saw the episode I thought the line was actually different since I understood the Japanese Shirou said and that the lines he said matched the subs.</br>  <br>nah, I was just curious how would someone represent it. I may do it if I find the inspiration<br><br>like this one?</br></br></br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br><br> fucking Shinji doomed humanity <br>WAKAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEE</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Yup but i don't know how you could fit a bait and a fish there.</br>  <br>[X] Persist on being a superhero.</br>  <br>Caster route.<br><br>Rider route close second</br></br></br>    <br>Both paths are right.<br><br>It's ok to save everyone, but it's also ok to save the one you love.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not a mistake.</br>  <br>There is no correct path, they both come with good and bad points.<br><br>This is an entire point people miss about ninety percent of Nasuverse stuff. <br><br>When people ask "Who was REALLY right in the feast of three kings dinner? I mean REALLY?"<br><br>If you're asking that then you missed the entire point, or are a fag in one direction. All three kings had some good points in their ideals, all three kings had their failings, which were talked about at the time. Both good and bad are interweave. You might lean more towards one path, but they're neither right nor wrong in the end, there is no "correct" path.<br><br>Too many people though tend to miss the good points of one path when they wank another path, so its a dangerous road to go too far one direction. You're likely to miss a lot of the points if you decide before it started.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>really? I think that it´s actually the easest part</br>  <br><br><br>forgot pic</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> But Gilgamesh is terrible ideals <br><br>CCC shows his ideals more than any other game so far, and he does have his own ideals about ruling that are pretty good. <br><br>His main fault is that he gets a little extreme in how he tries to reach that path. Till the end of time he loves humans, he's seen the future where they're destined to die, he tries to force them to get their shit together so it doesn't happen, and a lot of them die in the process.<br><br>He's like a parent rather than a protector; his job isn't to simply save their lives, rather his entire deal is about trying to find a way to make them stronger so they can get past this. He'll save them from outside threats, while turning against them himself and pushing them, see if they can get stronger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      They skipped pic related, damn ufo.  <br>The Shirou who went to college.</br>    <br>This one.</br>  <br>What does this imply that Archer and Saber will meet again in UBW time line?</br>  I wish Zero had stayed true to the Fate route. Seeing Saber fight Gilgamesh in a sea of flames for the finale would have been amazing.

Okay, I went with this instead.  Thoughts on Dandelion so far? It has fairly unique concept but its execution is absurd as fuck. The characters are pretty decent and cute especially Kanade and Hikari. Above average show.   doki <br>They're subbing it? Sweet. Didn't know since they're still banned from nyaa for some stupid reason. Was afraid we'd have to deal with funishit for this show.</br>  <br>My only thought so far is that FUNi sucks.</br>  <br>The last time I watched a Funi sub, it gave me cancer. Never again.</br>  <br>Kanade fucks shuu or we riot</br>  <br> tfw no Commie subs </br>  New episode today<br> subs monday </br>  <br><br><br>Akane rape when?</br></br></br>  Cool premise, mediocre execution. Of course, this is only judging from ep 1.  <br>They're still hit or miss on some of the lines, but typesetting and video quality are way above Funi.</br>  Team Akane represent<br>Can't have Kanade ruling the country</br>  If you don't vote for Akane you're a fagot.  Her voice is so cute  <br>After seeing the first episode I feel a lot better about it being Hanakana than before.</br>  <br>Agreed, I was kind of bummed it was her at first but she's still  cute. </br>  <br>Why is the eldest brother so unpopular? He seems bro as fuck.</br>  Red head is a cutie, but the show overall is kind of boring. Will probably watch a few more episodes then drop it  <br>He is, he just doesn't do very much. Plus he has a girlfriend so girls won't vote for him.</br>  <br>Impure sluts don't deserve votes.</br>  Such a best.  FUCKING FUNISHIT 4 DAYS LATECAST<br>CAN'T IT BE PICKED UP BY SOME COMPETENT GROUP AND RELEASED BEFORE MONDAY?</br>  <br>Crap. Dropped. Not even KanaHana can redeem it,</br>  <br><br>shitty show but my ears want to hear hanakana</br></br>  <br>Hopefully no one subs to Funi and it just dies trying to pick up this many shows. <br><br>Then again groups might just kill themselves over drama rip Kaylith</br></br></br>  <br> rip Kaylith <br>If I'm not mistaken, GJM/GoodJobMedia is basically Kaylith with a few different members. Overall release quality and speed seems to be more on par with what we got from Kaylith. A shame caffeine couldn't keep up with most of the shows they've picked up the past couple seasons and that Kaylith died in the first place, but at least GJM seems to basically be the same group.</br></br>  <br>I had no doubt they'd come back in some way but it just doesn't keep up with the speed old Kaylith used to have. There's been plenty of decent groups popping up but they just seem to slow down or die. Just checked to see what Asenshi was doing this season and doesn't look like anything. <br><br>Better get hurrying up and take that N2</br></br></br>  <br>Is that right? I thought Caffeine was the group with most of the Kaylith members.</br>  New episode is aired around 1 hour or so.  <br>Yeah no kidding. Fansubs seem really sparse this season, and some shows have multiple groups while other either only have funishit or don't have subs at all. My Japanese is barely at the point where I can read manga though, so it'll be a while before I can just watch stuff raw.<br><br><br>They did too. Not really sure what's happening to them though. Not sure if they just suck at getting stuff done in a timely manner or if there's sub drama going on behind the scenes or what. The scripts from them are pretty hit or miss sometimes too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It shouldn't take too long to be able to watch some stuff untranslated. Something like this is mostly basic and then maybe will throw you off when they describe some of the powers. <br><br>I still can't understand stuff like Hyouge Mono though. <br><br>1hr 15 to go</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked it, will probably stick with it till season end and will be okay with it ending, not craving a second cour, but would.enjoy it if there was one. 10/10 would keep watching. Can't really judge for a few episodes in anyways</br>  <br>Aren't there /a/nons that understand Japanese to watch and read the untranslated stuff?<br>Even if it was just the sub file it would be amazing if /a/ formed an impromptu subgroup each season to fight off shitty Funi crap.</br></br>  <br>I thought about it but there's Doki now.</br>  <br>It still seems to get a lot of flak though.<br>It was just a thought I had, really, like /ak/ scans.<br>Translated by anons for anons, without the shit in between.<br>If I weren't such a useless sack of shit I'd try to learn Nip, but I'm my own worst enemy in the sense that if I can't even follow through on watching the shows I'm interested in, how the hell can I follow through on learning something as time consuming as Japanese?</br></br></br></br>  <br>doki a guesslated shit</br>  <br>Well Doki's release isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Anons have translated stuff in the past but it's a hassle getting a number of people who want to remain anonymous to get it together.</br>  <br><br>I could do it but i never subbed anything before.<br>Also my Japanese isn't perfect yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Neither's Doki's and they've been going for years</br>  <br> implying Anons haven't gotten their shit together for stuff in the past. <br>While those /a/ sings threads that pop up from time to time aren't to my taste, it shows that, in theory, if someone were to set up a thread at the right time one could make it happen, with minimal shit posting.<br>It's time consuming, I should know, I subbed a few episodes of /co/ related stuff in my native language once, but knowing enough of the language to understand it is already half way done, the only thing needed is time to open up the raw and type down everything that's said to be later used, the actual shitty part is actually subbing it and keeping it in sync.<br>I can't complain since I would be fucked without these shitty subs to help me follow whats going on but /a/ could do better, right?<br>Every season just keeps getting worse.<br> Funi delaycasting and general eyecancer. <br> memesubs. <br> Sub groups either keep dying or are just using slightly changed subs from the shit group. <br>We reached a point where we are aware that we must choose between turds for the most polished one and no one does anything about it except complain  Which, ironically, is what I'm doing myself. <br>Don't get me wrong, I'm okay with the status quo, its just sad seeing so many anons in threads complain about stuff that doesn't need to be the way it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Starting any minute now<br><br><br>No one implied that. <br><br>The sub situation will get better again but right now it's a bit shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  starting<br><br>get in here niggas</br></br>  <br>I guess i could give it a try.<br>Need to find the tools and maybe a tutorial for how to sub since like i said never done it before.<br>If i really cant i will make the translation one way or another like a pastebin for exemple.</br></br></br>  Dual wield action    <br>God speed, anon.<br>Like I said, if you know the language well enough translating it is the easy part, maybe even fun, the unpleasant part is the subbing, it's just so dull and time consuming.</br></br>  <br>You can play around in Aegisub and get the hang of it. I think they still use that, but not sure.<br><br>Takes a long time though, 4 hours minimum.</br></br></br>  shu so dreamy    kanade best girl  smug  Goddammit Akane stop being spaghetti.

Also, what Akane blabbering in the end was because she's jealous? jealous of what?</br>  Who is this tuxedo temptress?  <br>I'm guessing they did the confession chapter this episode? Cute.</br>  <br> He doesn't want Kanade to win because she wants to win for him. At least she says that later on I think Shuu knows already though. And Akane is jealous of Satou </br>  <br>I guess its related to his injured leg.<br><br>For jelly Akane it was after Satou left them she was angry at him and Shuu was being dense.<br><br>The part at the end Akane was still a little angry at Shuu but it was mostly about her being confused about what was happening in the election</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that docking <br>Damn it.</br></br>  They are really hyping up her panties.  <br>Everyone wants to see Akane panties. <br><br>Next episodes going to be a good one.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt; she wants to win for him <br><br> kanade really wants his dick huh? </br></br></br>  <br>At first I thought "why wouldn't she wear spats or pantyhose to prevent such blatant shots?" but it seems stuff like that can't stop it.</br>  <br> She mostly want to do that because she injured his leg when they were younger </br>    <br> mfw Hikari is going to have bigger tits than Akane soon </br>  <br>And Shiori eventually, there's a picture of her being older from Hikari's power in vol2.<br><br>6 daughters and she's the only flat one.</br></br></br>  <br>This might become my AOTS solely because of Akane.</br>  <br>She already does.</br>  <br>You're a man of excelent taste.</br>  <br> implying that's bad. <br>Pettanko is justice!</br></br>   [Ohys-Raws] Joukamachi no Dandelion - 02 (TBS 1280x720 x264 AAC).mp4 <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>09811</wbr></br>  <br>Im downloading it now.<br>For the sub i dont know how long it will take.<br>I will use Aegisub like  said and i will try to do my best but dont expect anything amazing.<br> should i use a trip ? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Normally i'd say that 'before' is better, but 'after' version really suits her.<br>He knows what's good for her sister.</br></br>  <br>What kind of princess actually scrubbing toilet?</br>  <br>Do you think using a trip would help in any way?<br><br><br>Loser Princesses</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope i don't think it will.<br>I asked just in case to have another person opinion.</br></br>  Someone pls tell me Shu actually goes for Kanade instead of the moeblob  <br>Putting a trip on when you actually post the subs will make them easier to find in the archive but that's about it.</br>  hnngh  <br> He doesn't, he intends to marry Satou </br>  <br>They did twintails.</br>  <br>Incesderp pls<br>Kanade want the twintaill</br></br>   voting for any king besides the one who can see the goddamn future <br><br>Holy shit how stupid can you be.

There's a good chapter on it in the manga that shows why it just doesn't always work.</br>  <br>Knowing the odds still lets you always make the best decision even if it isn't guaranteed to work. If you have 2 options and one has a 50% chance to work and the other has a 75% you obviously go with the 75%</br>  <br>It's the best power to actually have as a king, but he still has to know what to do.</br>  <br>If everyone knows you'll make best move, they can counter them</br>  <br>Probability guessing doesn't mean "see the future"<br>75% still means 25% chance it will fail, and if you throw people into the mix the odds will be constantly all over the place and changing depending on their mood becuase you can't accurately know shit when a bunch of humans get together.<br>Might as well just teach Aoi anything and everything necessary to rule and make her King since she's actually a people person.</br></br></br>  <br>That pic reminded me of this for some reason.</br>  How can these two actually do it?  <br>Mama a crute</br>  So i figured out how to use Aegisub and i started doing the subs.<br><br>But theres a scene just before the op where im not sure what is said.<br>I have a an idea of what is being said but if im wrong dont hold it againt's me.<br> it's the piano scene so i dont think it's an important one anyway. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't you just transcribe whats being said and then use the internet or a jap handbook to help you out? or are you just at a level where you can just understand speech but not actually write or read it?<br>Pick kinda related.</br></br>  <br>post the transription of what is being said in the djt, and ask for their help</br>  <br> So i figured out how to use Aegisub and i started doing the subs. <br><br>Your typesetting will be shit, you'll probably choose a poor default font (you're probably even going to forget to mux the fonts), I doubt of your English grammar and nip skills too, your timing won't be any better than Funimation, you're surely going to use Ohys-raws for your release and they are more eye cancer than Funi.<br><br>Just let Doki handle it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I doubt of your English grammar and nip skills too <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  Chapter 5 just got translated, dumping.        Man, why's the character design so good? They should've hired this guy for ore no twintails too ;_;          <br> caught on them <br>That's a weird way to say it</br></br>        <br><br>I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to make the audio into some sort of subtitle.<br>It would be much easier and faster than translating by ear.</br></br></br>  <br>Make some friends and get a transport stream.</br>  <br> againt's  <br>I hope this is just a typo (albeit an odd one) and isn't indicative of your English.</br></br>  <br>Japanese subs come out 2 days after broadcast on kitsunekko</br>  <br>I lied they're out already</br>  <br><br>You are a life saver.</br></br>  To those who have read the manga, does the MC get over her embarrassment of showing her panties or is that the joke the entire series?  <br>This is a gag manga, what do you think?</br>  <br>She stops showing them after a while. She doesn't get over it it just stops happening. There's one more chapter about it but it's ero enough to let it go.</br>  <br>Don't you mean her all around bashfulness? Being embarrassed to show your panties on national television and everyone else to see seems pretty normal.</br>  <br> There's one more chapter about it but it's ero enough to let it go. <br><br>Explain further.</br></br></br>  <br>She  walks around school all day without wearing a skirt. Eventually people call her out on it, she says she's wearing shorts but she isn't and flashes everyone. <br><br>Going to be a good chapter if you're a leg man</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, saw the raw yesterday (I think), I thought you were talking about something else.</br>  <br>No that's the last one that I remember. It moves on from pants pretty quickly afterwards. <br><br> I am looking forward to seeing little Akane next episode though. </br></br></br>  Is Akane best because she's easily bullied?  <br>Easily bullied, easily made happy, flat, twintails to grab<br><br>Perfection</br></br></br>  <br>This anon gets it.<br>Akane-chan is a miracle of the universe!</br></br>  <br>this one?</br>  <br>That one, I can't wait<br>Poor Hikari never thinking things through</br></br>  Alright this is going much faster now to translate.<br>But since i work tomorrow i'm going to go sleep and finish it after work.</br>  <br>What kind of terrible thing would happen?<br><br> Related to old men? </br></br></br>  <br> 2222 <br>Shuu for the win. Also for boob goggling</br></br>  Why do I ship so hard Shuu with Kanade? I just watched episode 1 though  <br>Because best boy and best girl deserve each other.<br><br>Also I can't stand anyone outside of the royal family getting to tap dem kanades.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to know too.<br>Her power is already really weird with the savings thing. And how does she know about a material that will only be invented in another 20 years? I thought she would just be able to create anything she wanted, not have a catalog of everything that was ever conceived in the past, future and beyond to the land of fiction.<br>Really weird.<br>The only actual thing that would make sense would be "super powered debt", any money she would get would immediately be deduced until her debts got paid off, meaning if she fucks up she might end up permanently penniless until she dies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kanade could magic herself up the perfect android husband, would that be ok?<br><br><br>I guess it just works as a list of qualities. She can make anything at all, so "block of material to stop truck and absorb impact" is easy to imagine. How she knew after I don't know, maybe she gets a magic reciept in her head telling her what it was and how much. <br><br>As for what happens if she doesn't have money  it happens in the manga, basically as a kid she made a castle and parts just disappeared and it broke up </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, Hikari is a real semen demon.</br>  <br>Also, couldn't she just create a printer with everything necessary to legitimately print money like the specific paper they use and the codes? Fuck, what about the signatures? Screw it. Why doesn't she just create more money?<br>Think about it! The material used is cheap as fuck in comparison to the value we actually give it, so by doing that loop in the logic, she could, and I'm using USD here for lack of Yen data, create stacks and stacks of 100 dollar bills, which cost 11¢ to produce, basically gaining infinite money in the process.</br></br>  <br>Illegally printed money probably has no value. And if her dad authorized it than it'd just be causing inflation and lowering the value of the money of the citizens.<br><br>You shouldn't take it too seriously.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, you need to retake the junior high economy class.</br>  My poor dick.  <br>I prefer older Shiori<br><br><br>Imagine having them all at once. Someone get the doujin artists on this.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Illegally printed money probably has no value. <br>That's if its actually seen as money not printed by the government, if you had a way to get your hands on all the required stuff they would never know the difference. <br> And if her dad authorized it than it'd just be causing inflation and lowering the value of the money of the citizens. <br>I know, it was just a what if, it's not like she would actually use the money in the market, stingy as she is.<br> You shouldn't take it too seriously. <br>I'm not.<br>Just taking her power and going with it, its fun to speculated the potential in super powers.<br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Imagine having them all at once <br><br>And they're all different ages because of Hikari's power<br><br>Japan pls</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it'd just be causing inflation and lowering the value of the money of the citizens. <br> Not wanting to be a super villain that would rule the world through economic inflation and debt. </br></br>  <br>Yes. What is a girl if she isn't bullyable?</br>  <br>She could ruin economies of enemy countries.</br>  <br>This artist, goddamn!</br>  <br>Hikari seems pretty fun to bully because of how airheaded she is.</br>   Family gets to rule an entire nation just because they have special powers <br><br>I found a dissident who lives in the neighborhood.<br><br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZtYU<wbr>87QNjPw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Misaki? She seems pretty insecure of herself because her clones are the ones that are good at things.</br>  <br> Family gets to rule an entire nation just because they have special powers. <br>You got it wrong, anon.<br>Its not superpowers that make you a royal, its royalty that gives you superpowers.<br>By the way I miss Monty python ;_;</br></br></br></br>  what is happening here.  <br>One of the kids have the power to fuck with people.</br>  <br>What happened with Shoe?</br>  What the flying fuck?<br>How does Fire Hydrant-san know about anything? It's an inanimate object, it can't go anywhere, how does it know the layout of the building so well to actually know about a short cut? it would make more sense for Shiori to talk to the actual building for this, but then again how would a building know what goes on inside it anymore than a person knows whats going on inside themselves?<br>Fuck you Fire Hydrant-san.</br></br>  <br>Japs are kind of retarded and think every object of a certain age has a soul.</br>  <br>Accidentally rolled off the bed and hit his head after fucking Kanade.<br><br> I wish. </br></br></br>  <br> Fire Hydrant-san <br><br>Ugh.</br></br></br>  <br>Having a soul doesn't make you know about shit. Children have souls, yet they are dumb as a bag of bricks because they haven't learned anything yet.<br>Now if you told me Fire Hydrant-san used to "play" a lot "inside" Building-chan that he found a shortcut, then yeah, I'd believe it.<br>Even self aware a fire hydrant wouldn't know anything besides the few feet around it, and that's if it can actually see and feel.</br></br></br>  <br>How dare you.<br><br>Fir hydrant talks to the building and because the hydrant is much smaller unlike the building, Shiori felt it was more approachable.</br></br></br>  I love her.  <br>If I had Shiori's power I'd love to talk to all manner of shit.<br>Like, a woman's vibrator-san, I'd love to hear its thoughts about stuff.<br>I'd also love to hear about condom-san's expectations about it's live.<br>Or maybe ask the ground how much it likes being walked on like the worthless slut it is...</br></br></br></br>  <br>That last one got me kind of excited.</br>  <br>You could even talk to your onahole.<br>Just think about it.</br></br>  <br> Pick it up to use it <br> Constant loud panicked screaming <br><br>Whether that's a good thing or not is up to you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It has a man's voice </br>  Why does this studio never follow the source material? Fuck.  <br>Can 4koma adaptations really follow the source that well?</br>  <br>I think Dogakoba handles 4koma pretty well.</br>   yfw no cute girl to latch onto your leg and enjoy your smell <br>Sucks that they omitted Kanade's jelly after this scene.</br>  <br>Her power is more like having instant shipping on anything she orders really</br>  There needs to be a wiki for this, I can't remember any of their powers  <br>Why doesn't she just materialize some advanced technology from the future and then sell it to interested governments at a much higher price to get more money.</br>  <br>when you think about it her power really is the strongest in terms of the scale of what it does. I see two ways it could works. either while she exists every inanimate object in the universe become sentient but only able to communicate with her. or when she tries to talk to an object her power goes back in time and bring the object to life in the past so that it has memories to speak to her in the present.<br><br>if it's the first then her powers operate on an unbelievable scope, if its the second still clearly the strongest of the 9</br></br></br>  <br>maybe fire hydrant can sense through the pipe that's connected to it and feel every where in the building that has running water</br>   when she tries to talk to an object her power goes back in time and bring the object to life in the past <br>literally what</br>  <br>What's not to understand</br>    <br>But what if she materializes something from a post-apocalyptic future? Does she need to stock up on bottlecaps as well?</br>  <br>It's changed little bits here and there but it's following decently enough. A few jokes slightly changed a bit but it's all still there. <br><br>If they did something like remove Satou it'd be something else. <br><br><br>They'd still have to find out how to use it, how it was made etc. <br><br>Imagine if I gave someone a mobile phone 100 years ago. They wouldn't really be able to do anything with it. It could speed up some processes maybe, but then would the money be worth it? <br><br>Plus if Civ taught me anything it's that you shouldn't sell technology to other civs because 30 years later they're going to invade you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I'd cover Satou in my white stuff, if you get what I mean</br>  If she so worried about people seeing her panties so much, why doesn't she just not wear them?  <br>Kanade pls go.</br>  <br>Or like, pants or something</br>  <br> Not selling tech to your main rival's enemies so they ruin each other <br> how_to_spot_a_goyim.ttf </br></br>   best show of season <br> have to wait 5 days for subs </br>   transport streams on nyaa <br>If only I knew how to encode and shit.</br>   Kanade getting NTR-ed for the entire ep <br><br>I THOUGHT THIS SHOW WAS ABOUT WINCEST</br></br>  Finally got around to watching KLK over the past few days. It was absolutely, irrevocably  _fun .  Best outfit, expression, pupils and razormouth, there can be no denying.  <br>She bullied Senketsu, that automatically make her a shit.</br>  <br>Seeing her trash the rest of the cast was great though.</br>  <br>P L E B <br>L<br>E<br>B</br></br></br></br>  I think we all know who wore it best  <br> it </br>  <br>I'm sorry, Him. it was very insensitive to insult brogestu like that.</br>  <br> Him <br><br>Senketsu is a genderfluid</br></br></br>  Satsuki a best.  <br>He has a drill though, he must be a boy.  Girl Senketsu's a supreme beauty though. </br>  Where the fuck are the threads?  At least wait till tomorrow, damn it.  <br>Preview hasn't came out.</br>  I'm kind of considering dropping this because nothing can possibly top the opening scene and I don't want to be disappointed.  Nothing to talk about, Satelight is torturing us with no preview pics.<br><br>I really have no idea what tp expect next episode. How do I even prepare myself for it if I have no clue what'swhat's going to happen.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127826302 <br>Fuck off.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127826302   28 hours to go.

I just want to see some stupid pictures that tell us nothing, and then get excited because one of them is shaking for no damn reason. <br>Is that so much to ask?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping they just forgot them.<br>Speculating on preview pictures that don't show anything was pretty fun in the G threads. If they keep not releasing any at all for the next episodes or release it like 10 hours before the airing I don't think I can handle wait, especially if terrible cliffhangers happen.</br></br>  Wake up, see this. What do?  <br>Check if I'm Bikki.</br>  <br>What would you touch to check?</br>  Stop, I knew these threads would become trash generals.<br>We had fun for days, now just wait till tomorrow.</br>  <br>Preview pictures might happen at any moment.</br>  <br>Just ignore all threads that aren't on the airing days.</br>  <br>Miku. Then observe her reaction.</br>   sleep  <br> wake up <br> still no EP2 PV <br>Are they planning to upload them after the episode airs?</br></br></br>  <br>They'll come with the BDs.</br>  Someone in the last thread said that perflat doesn't apply to butts.<br> That isn't true at all, flat butts have their fans and if a man doesn't aknowledge their obvious benefits in certain situations he hasn't been living his live correctly.</br>  So, is it already a given that Tsubasa will get trashed by Phara? This seems to be the typical case when new strong enemies appear.<br>Also her character CD won't even come out for one month after Hibiki's CD so I assume she won't even get to sing her battle song until she comes back to fight in episode 4 or so.</br>  <br> their obvious benefits in certain situations <br>Please elaborate.</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa will job for Maria <br>All of my Phonic Gain.<br><br> Sorry Nana. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If a small chest means you're closer to her heart when you hug her, a small butt means...</br>  <br> Will she get kissed? </br>  <br>You're closer to her poop.</br>  <br>I'd be fine with that, Maria needs to be useful again.<br>But that's unlikely too because Maria's CD is the seventh one, so it seems like they're saving her gear for last. Or maybe her second song will just have spoiler-y as fuck lyrics so they can't release it earlier.</br></br>  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/8<wbr>0om4dehtbrqodp/Symphogear_G_Lyrics.<wbr>rar<br><br>I dont remember the quality of them but that was all of the ones from G</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Where the fuck are the threads? <br>/m/</br></br>  Wait a second.<br>Won't season 3 mean we get a DMJii+Maria training montage?</br>  <br>Oh look "stop making threads" anon is here again to tell us to stop having threads about currently airing series</br>    <br>Yes, but they will be trained in the way of the ninja by Ogawa.</br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  <br>YES!

Kind of surprised that Kaneko likes Zesshoushinai so much.  Could this mean more SoL moments? </br>  <br>I just hope it doesn't mean they still haven't finished this ep and we're in for some great quality.</br>  <br> Maria does as bad as Chris in physical activities <br> Chris pats her on the shoulder afterwards with an understanding look <br> she and Chris become closer friends because of it  <br>Would be cute.</br></br></br></br>  Confirmed the dolls will make poses like flamenco, classic ballet or jazz dance when they fight. Kirika and Shirabe are their targets too.  <br>But will we get character songs with lots of flamenco motifs? I want at least one song to have a trumpet solo.</br>  <br>Still hoping for a bed scene.</br>  SLAY THE GAY  <br> Kind of surprised that Kaneko likes Zesshoushinai so much. <br>He said on his twitter that even though they asked him to pick a scene from S1 or S2 he broke the rules and chose a scene from Zesshou Shinai in consideration of his fellow staff members and cast, so that their choices wouldn't overlap.</br></br>  <br>which magazine is this from?</br>  <br>But then there wouldn't be any geahs left.</br>  <br>Dunno.<br><br><br>Animedia.</br></br></br></br>    <br> wait over a week for the spread with sword to get scanned <br> this gets scanned in less than a day. <br><br>Sword needs more love.</br></br></br></br>  GLORIOUS BREEEAK  RADIANT FORCEEEEE  EXTERMINAAAATE  <br><br> I LOVE YOU </br></br>  <br>So which dance for which doll?</br>  <br>Green is already established as Flamenco<br>Red gets Jazz hands<br>Yellow gets ballet<br>Blue gets  breakdancing </br></br></br></br>   tfw just found out about Hajamari no uta Babel and Nijiiro no Flügel <br>Can't believe I overlooked them for so long. Felt like a kid on chrismas day. I can't even decide which one I like more.</br>  <br>Did you even watch G episode 13?</br>  <br>I did but it was after a time gap and I missed downloading some cds. Completed it now and listening to them all.</br>  I cry myself to sleep at night wishing I could hug Tsubasa-senpai  <br>More like LAY the gay.<br><br>Confirmation when?</br></br></br>  <br>Based Satoru Fujimoto that was such a good scene. Chris's character development was a major highlight of the first season.</br>  <br>Why are they so gay? Did Mamu and Maria raise them like that?</br>  Okay guys I think I'm ready to fist Hibiki  <br>The 3 of them took baths and slept together so the 2 kids probably think it's normal to be that touchy-feely.</br>  <br>I want to be a little girl and take a bath with Maria.</br>  Episode 2 with proper hype ass Nana OP when?  <br>I really want a special episode or something about how Maria met Shirabe and Kirika. I bet the two of them were edgy little shits like Kanade was before Maria and Mom adopted them.</br>  <br>Step it up seempai</br>  <br>Remember that Irish anon from a few days ago?<br><br>"She has too much ass" lol</br></br></br>  The art style is pretty 2006 now that I look closer  <br>It's good too but the drill has rotational power for more pleasure and the deeper it goes the more it expands. <br>Also, considering where the drill comes from, using Incinerate! to loosen it all up would be very helpful.</br></br>  <br>not gay enough</br>   24 hours till new episode  <br> still no preview images  <br><br>Symphogear is dead</br></br></br>  <br> a week till subs </br>  <br>LOVE IS NOT OVEEEEEER</br>   Symphogear G aired 20 years ago <br>I think I can wait one more day.</br>  <br> 20 years ago <br>How is the future 18 years form now?<br>Is Nana still singing?</br></br></br>  <br>she quit after yukarin offed herself on christmas 2015</br>  <br>Now, that's not funny anon.</br>  <br>Is that when the episode 7 subs come out?</br>  <br> 5 minutes until previews </br>  <br><br><br>Too round, this is atrocity.</br></br></br>  <br>C H A R M P O I N T</br>  <br>I'm refreshing the website even though I know you're lying.<br>Is this what it feels like to be a drug addict?</br></br>  Charm Point Tier List<br><br>God Tier:<br>Kanade's Hair<br>Hibiki's Butt<br><br>High Tier:<br>Maria's Legs<br>Miku's Smile<br><br>Mid Tier: <br>Chris' Zenbus<br>Shirabe's Eyes<br><br>Low Tier:<br>Kirika's Back<br><br>Doesn't Have a Charm Point Tier:<br>Tsubasa's  Personality </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  To whoever missed it. Yuuki Aoi is voicing yet another goddess this season.  <br> Not Kirika's top tier ZR </br>  <br>Who is this sperm wyrm</br>  <br>While Maria's legs and her body in general is very nice I'd say her charm point is really the combination of her hair and eyes.<br>The colors go really well together.</br></br>  <br>Truly a miracle.</br>  <br>It's definitely the legs</br>  Will previews even come out today?  <br>Cat ears are the best though.</br>  <br>More like Kanade's everything. Dem butt, tits, legs, hair and voice man.<br> still no signs of coming back to life </br></br>  <br>Based on <br>Maybe not.</br></br>  <br>What is Serena's charm point?</br>  <br>I want to headpat Maria.</br>  <br>While I do agree with you I wanted to appear less biased than I normally do when talking about Kanade, so I only picked one.  To be honest even though she is my waifu I recognize that she probably should stay dead for the point of character and story development in the show. That said, more flashbacks when? <br><br><br>While I am also very fond of Maria's hair, like I said above, I wanted to only pick one thing for each character and I already used hair for (imo, slightly superior) Kanade.</br></br></br></br>  <br> waifu dies in episode one and never comes back <br>How can you deal with it.</br></br>  <br> The JAM </br>  <br>I swear to god I'm not Kira Yoshikage, but her arms, specifically her hands and shoulders. Probably goes in mid-tier.<br><br><br>It's... hard, anon. Best I've got is listening to her song on repeat and scrounging every source I can find for images of her. I'm working on trimming episodes to dump every frame she's in as well, and considering video and audio clips of her dialogue. It seems kinda bizarre, I guess, but when your waifu has about seventeen minutes of screentime in her whole series, compared to some characters who have seventeen episodes worth of screentime, there's only so much I *can* do.</br></br></br></br>  What are the chances of this happening?  <br>Does anybody have the Ashes-noise?</br>    <br>I believe in Aoi</br>  <br>Little Miracle.</br>  <br>Aquarion Logos' episode 2 preview that is on Animate news site came out 5 hours earlier than its first airing today.</br>  A third group is subbing GX now, Dororon. Anyone tried those?  <br>Dororon is H&amp;D without fonts and a weird resolution.</br>  <br> your cute imouto will never look at you with this face <br>Why live?</br></br>  What does the chingchong on 5275 stream say?  The action, suffering and suspense along with those great characters creates an infinite amount of amazing SoL moments that we will never see the Geahs do. It hurts.  <br>What are you talking about?<br>The only gay Symphogeah is that creepy dyke Miku (and maybe Kirika and Shirabe) and none of the other girls like her, except Bikkie, who does so out of pity.<br>Hibiki, Tsubasa, Maria and Chris are all straight as an arrow.<br><br>Take off you're yuri goggles.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Believe in the next Zesshoushinai episodes and maybe Drama CDs.</br>  <br>Seriously, get out, go back to your Naruto or DBZ threads.</br>  I like the fact that Chris gets around. She seems like the pet-type.  <br>Please be careful about disrespecting 2D images, it might trigger crack-kun.</br>  <br>I was about to make a joke about that as a spoiler but thought it would be laying on too thick.<br><br>Not sure if this official art can be considered safe.</br></br></br>  <br> maybe Kirika and Shirabe <br>They are even gayer than Miku.</br></br>  <br> onsen episode never ever </br>  <br>Why is Miku there?<br>She is not a real symphogear user and doesn't belong in that group.</br></br>  <br> maria without her cat-ear hair <br><br>It's adorable but subtly wrong in a way that unnerves me</br></br></br>  <br> they're still wearing their ribbons and clips </br>  <br> Shirabe and Kirika run on LiNKER <br> Maria doesn't have a gear <br>Come again?</br></br></br>  <br>The show's treatment of Miku is weird in general. She's more important than a secondary character, but not quite as important as the main characters either. She was for instance the only non-geah in G's ED as well.</br>  <br> Shirabe and Kirika run on LiNKER <br>There's nothing wrong with being a LiNKER user. Druggies are people too.</br></br>  <br>I love Chris' zenbus in this image even more so than usual</br>  <br>So you admit that Maria isn't a person?</br>  <br>Unless Satelight or other staff force Kaneko, he will certainly avoid to write such lewd scenes.</br>  <br>Yeah, some sort of cat/tentacle creature hybrid.  I honestly didn't mention her because we already know she gets a gear and she also runs on drugs so it applies to her too. </br>  <br><br>Man they are really giving Hibiki big hips and ass</br></br>  <br>I love Maria!</br>  <br> Chris gets around. <br>Rude</br></br>  <br>Serena please.</br>  <br>Maria is the prettiest</br>  <br>Amazing what a couple more years can do to a body.<br><br><br>This. While the rest of the cast is definitely adorable, Maria's design is definitely more focused on being pretty or beautiful.  And it fucking works. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a fan of that outfit. Her 1st one is the best.</br>  <br>Definitely the softest. Even her usual color palette.</br>  Can't believe I'm still waiting for previews after some guy said they might not release them until a few hours before the next episode. Symphogear's hurting me.  <br>Dat asymmetric thigh high.</br>  <br>GX will be a very suffering season for everyone, including us.</br>  <br>Cutest - Chris<br>Coolest - Tsubasa<br>Prettiest - Maria<br><br>The others have their specific appeal but these 3 hit the broader categories of cute/cool/pretty the best for me. Not to say that Tsubasa isn't pretty or Maria can't be cute etc, just that it's their focus.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This anon said it best <br>I just want my vague pictures and to freak out over pictures that shake.</br></br>  <br> No "Manliest - Hibiki" <br>You forgot the most important one.</br></br>   Singing geah vs dancing elemental dolls <br>Heaven or Hell, let's rock.</br>  <br> someone else uses a three-category system <br><br>Albeit different categories, but holy shit I thought I was the only one<br><br>Without my personal bias<br><br>Cutest - Chris<br>Prettiest - Maria<br>Hottest - Hibiki  and also Maria <br><br>With cutest being the best looking day-to-day, prettiest being the one that looks best 'all dolled up' (i.e. makeup, fancy dress, etc), and hottest being the one that looks best in nothing at all<br><br> I've been off /a/ so long but now I question myself every time I click Captcha's "I'm not a robot" thing when I make statements like this </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki's fucking hips <br><br>Jesus christ I can't contain my dick.</br></br></br>  <br>The most manly - Hibiki</br>  <br> Symphogears singing while the dolls are dancing to their tune as well to match their fighting rhythm <br>Can't wait.

It was there most of the time, but sometimes they'd forget to draw it.</br>  <br>I like it, her smug faces spice up her character. I also like that they drew Maria's breasts smaller and shaped a little different so she doesn't overlap with Chris.</br>  <br>They only started getting inconsistent when she was in her winter jacket and started to wear two of them.</br>  <br>Miku's unhealthy cooking is making her fat.</br>  <br>The asymmetry is pretty nice but skirts are the best.<br><br>Maybe if we combined those stockings with the new outfit.</br></br></br>  <br>Maria's chest measurement is 6 cm larger than Chris' though.</br>  <br>Might be her broader back.</br>  <br>Remember Maria is taller than Tsubasa.</br>  <br>Chris breasts are still a lot bigger. The wonders of misleading measurements in the breast area. Chris probably has a 5-10cm smaller under-bust measurement due to their difference in height alone. For her height Chris is probably around an I cup.</br>  <br>How did Chris get such tits anyway</br>  <br>You know those hentai plots where the rapists inject weird drugs to make their tits grow and stuff like that</br>  <br>Lots of childhood sexual activity jumpstarted her hormones.</br>  <br>They were "massaged" a lot by her captors.</br>  <br>Drink milk, kids.</br>  <br>Phonic Gain from an early age on.

I'd prefer if it was a continuous bunch.</br>    <br><br>Time for skiing?</br></br>   Hibiki is literally Rudy <br><br>When guns</br></br>  <br>It's geah, sooner or later we'll see her actually do that.</br>  <br>Senpai is so cool</br>  <br><br>That outfit and lighting makes her thighs criminal.</br></br>  <br>We saw one other.</br>  <br>Doing a crime with Tsubasa.</br>    <br>Gonna kill all the miracles</br>  <br>Please be nice to the Kisekis.</br>  <br>that small ass cheek peek</br>  <br> Ass fang, anon </br>  <br>CHRIS: Stupid sexy sempai.<br><br>TSUBASA: Feels like nothing at all.</br></br></br>  <br>New comfy anime when? It's been too long since ZBL and Natsuiro Kiseki.</br>  <br><br>no wonder Tsubasa doesn't have a charmpoint, her entirety is perfect and can't be reduced to a single point</br></br>  <br>Her charmpoint is her alphaswag</br>  <br>There have been great comfy anime all the time, were you asleep?</br>    <br>Yes, actually. Kanade/Maria/Hibiki power trio when?</br>  <br>The charm point might be the vagina bones this season. We'll see during her transformation.</br>  <br/>  <br>Is that bunny supposed to be the magical device from Vivid? Chris wearing a Chris plushie?</br>    <br>There is nothing gay about two cute girls hold hands. Nothing at all.</br>  <br>Ok fine, I admit it, Tsubasa is actually pretty sexy despite being a hag.</br>    Chris a cute.  <br> forgetting that Maria exists </br>  <br><br>I forgot how much that hurt my ears</br></br>  <br>too cute...</br>  <br>Maria is not a Gungnir anymore. She's a Airgetlam now.</br>      <br><br> Flat and old insults <br><br>When will the bullying end?</br></br></br></br>  <br>C-cute.</br>  <br>I want a Serena.</br>  <br>Flat is perfect, but she will be a hag for the rest of her life.</br>  <br>Nope, it's designed by Chris' VA herself. And don't you remember how Chris mentioned a key holder in Classroom Monochrome?</br>  I want Chris to bully me.    <br>I want a Maria. And maybe some buzzkill.</br>        <br> Bikki as a maid <br><br>Interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>I want meido Bikki to break through my wall with a cup of tea in the morning.</br>  <br>It's sad because she's neither flat nor old. She's only small by comparison, and she's three years younger than Maria, who is arguably the hottest girl in the series.</br>  Welp   <br>I want medio Bikki to clean my room hot bloodedly.</br>  <br/>  <br>At least they're doing it at home</br>  <br>Rewatch the second Zesshoushinai. Now. Just do it, don't ask why.</br>   wake up  <br> 19 hours to go <br> still no preview pics </br></br>  <br> Zesshoushinai <br>Are those canon? I wonder if Kirika's letter will show up and if she will DESSSSSSSSSSSS then.</br></br>  <br>w-what am I looking for</br>  <br>It has to do with doing things at home. Maybe that was in the first ova now that I think about it again.</br>  <br>I forgot this feeling</br>  <br>Right in the feels with the last part.</br>  Who is best sympho and why is it Chris      <br><br><br>Chris, seriously, you're killing me</br></br></br>  <br> moment_of_insertion.gif </br>    Literally useless.  If there's 301,655,722 locks, would that mean that Hibiki only unlocked 3 so far?  <br> Setting up the flags to get her ass handed to her by Airgetlam Maria later </br>  <br>So she wants to kiss Tsubasa?</br>  <br><br> Puppet girl kisses Tsubasa and starts draining her <br> Maria jumps in and saves her at the last second <br> The only way to save Tsubasa is through a kiss </br></br></br></br>  <br>And then Maria wakes up.</br>  <br> Hibiki is gets knocked unconscious after a fight. <br> Miku shoves everyone out of the way so that she can be the one to give CPR. </br></br>  <br>It is sinful to submit to someone younger than you.</br>  How alive is Maria x Tsubasa  <br>I think it's stupid.</br>    <br><br><br>Alright those two pairings have their kissing moment, and Kiri and Shirabe will kiss at some point just because they are turbo gay. So that leaves Chris with  her daki of Tsubasa to cry alone with in a dark corner of her room </br></br></br>  <br><br>Seems you're mixing up Chris and Maria's positions.</br></br>  <br>What if Fine traumatized Chris so badly that she became straight? That would explain why she gets so flustered by all the gay.</br>  <br>She can kiss anime ja nai or one of the other two. There is an odd number of them after all. She also has her own classmates that are gay for her.</br>  <br>If anything the rape by her "pimps" traumatized her into becoming gay<br><br> Luckily she has a cool and dependable senpai who makes her feel safe </br></br></br>  <br>Chris harem of side characters when.</br>  <br>No, think of the locks as a Gear's skill tree. Hibiki unlocked parts that Kanade didn't and vice versa.</br>    <br> teased in magazine <br> totally missing from episode <br><br>What the hell</br></br></br></br>  <br>(Basically, every element that can distinguish users of the same gear from each other is one of those things that can be unlocked, but only those features that suit a user's personality/desires/subconscious will end up being unlocked even after training.)</br>  <br>Of course, you have common features that need unlocking too, such as the verniers.</br>  <br>I came here to post this, my new animejanai picture that some kind anon made for me.</br>  <br>Glad she invested a skill point in scarves</br>  animate.co.jp/special/charaby_tv/pc<wbr>/charabyebook/<br><br>Soon</br></br></wbr>  <br>Dan Yoshii is a wonderful woman for suggesting that.</br>  <br>I'm still waiting for her to save Miku from falling with it or strangle an enemy into submission bondage style. Maria's cape could do cool things too.</br>  <br> strangle Miku with it bondage style </br>  <br>Miku has her own scarf for that</br>  Tsubasa a cute!  <br>That's weird, it won't let me open that link directly. I have to paste it into google first and go from there. So what's going to be in these ebooks?</br>    <br> glasses <br>A sword doesn't need that</br></br>  <br>I want to inspect her crotch area</br>  <br>http://www.animate.co.jp/special/ch<wbr>araby_tv/pc/charabyebook/<br>Sorry.</br></wbr></br>  <br>I think that's the magazine that has this spread?</br>  <br>Oh, nice.</br>  I had a dream about the previews being out and immediately woke up to check the thread and it wasn't.<br>Fuck you, dream.</br>  <br>Go back to sleep anon</br>  <br>what were they like</br>  <br>I did too, but it was pretty embarrassing.<br>All of the preview pictures were of Moo-tan from Etotama wearing a seashell outfit.<br><br>Dreams are stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa suffering.</br>   Waiting for previews <br> 2:50 AM </br>  I watched all of Symphogear and Symphogear G in the past few days and I had some pretty weird dreams last night.<br><br>Something about Chris blocking a dam or something in a forest while I was taking a bath.</br></br>  <br>You were just remembering season one anon, go back to sleep.</br>  <br>Bosnian</br>  <br> Something about Chris blocking a dam <br>With her tits, right?</br></br>  <br>Not quite, her Gear turned into a mecha, sort of like how Shirabe once did, and used her mecha legs to create a shield.</br>   someone, somewhere in the world, watches Symphogear at something other than loud ear-bleeding volume <br>I'm disgusted just thinking about it.</br>  <br> I had a symphogear dream before, all I remember is Shirabe doing a low-to-the-ground horizontal spin attack with her yoyos, I think they looked kinda like this except yellow for some reason. <br> Posting in case I'm psychic. </br></br>  <br>It's terrifying when dreams show future shit in detail...</br>  <br>Oh wait, I'm not psychic at all, they've showed her yoyos before I just forgot. Now I feel like a moron.  I'm kind of proud of my recollection though, I haven't seen this picture in awhile. </br>   Oh crap did she see me crying? <br> I think she saw me crying <br> Quick, try and think of something tough to say <br> Kind of breezy up here <br> Stupid papa </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's proof that we have already lived at least once and know all this stuff already subconciously. Or we already died in a parallel universe. Maybe this is all just a game. Maybe it loops so we can keep watching 3 seasons of Symphogear for all eternity.</br>  <br> watching a great show for the first time over and over <br>Is this... heaven?</br></br>  <br> I bet she doesn't have to deal with issues with her dad. </br>  <br> I wonder what my dolls are up to </br>        <br>S-sorry anon</br>  <br>I wear headphones and I'm still worried about disturbing apartment neighbors when I watch symphogear at night.</br>  <br>everyone is shitting on Maria, yet she knows her flaws and is doing her best changing herself</br>  <br>My brother in arms. I feel you.</br>  <br>I imagine my neighbors heard me laughing hysterically through the walls starting from about three minutes into the episode.</br>  <br>"K2 is now only the third highest mountain in the world!"</br>  <br>She's retired from her seiyuu and artist work but she is know a known Enka singer under the name Kondo Nana.</br>  <br>I usually watch shows at about 25-35% volume, I keep Symphogear at 80%+ at all times.</br>  <br> you'll never be so alpha you just look like you're going out for serious skiing even though you're on the top of a fucking space shuttle that's going to crash </br>  <br>Maria is the only hag here.<br>Tsubasa is always one of the miracles of the universe.</br></br>  <br>That reminds me, I compiled all the K2 autism.</br>  <br>I want to reproduce with a sword.</br>  <br>That's why she's so cute. Even if everyone else bullies her I will always love her.</br>  <br> tfw Tsubasa wakes up seeing this every morning <br>Sometimes I want to be a sword.</br></br>  Guys, guess what was just updated on the website.<br><br> Nothing. </br></br>  Swords can also be cute!  <br>Bring a sheath.</br>  <br>Swords are much better when they're alpha as fuck.</br>  <br>I also like Maria because  it's very easy self inserting as her since I'm also useless </br>    <br>Well, people can self-insert in Maria too because they want to be dominated hard by Tsubasa.</br>  <br>well done anon.</br>    <br> I won't deny that </br>  Why are a couple of losers trying to force Maria x Tsubasa?<br><br>Did you not watch G?</br></br>  <br>It feels weird to be sexually attracted to a sword.</br>  <br>AI RABU YUU might have part in that</br>  <br> Not wanting alpha dom Maria <br><br><br>Yeah I did. What about it?</br></br></br></br>  TAKANARE  Loli pantsu will get befriended by Miku or Genjūrō.  <br>Because professional singers doing love duets always live the lyrics.<br><br><br>Watch all the scenes with Maria and Tsubasa again.<br>All three or four of them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alpha dom Maria only exists in the first 4 episodes of G.<br>She's dead now, Maria gets rekt every night by the Alphalord that is named Kazanari Tsubasa.</br></br>  <br><br>As it should be.</br></br>  <br>That tummy is begging to be fisted.</br>  <br> Half dom Maria </br>  <br>The official art isn't too clear on the pairings either though.</br>  <br> her alphaness only lasted 21 seconds </br>  <br>I like the way Tsubasa doesn't give a shit about Maria on anything more than a professional level.</br>  <br>Maria is probably the cutest gear.</br>  <br>She thinks of Maria as a friend now.<br>Though we don't know what exactly is Tsubasa's definition of "Friend".</br></br>  <br>Only fourth to Bikki, Chris and Derebasa.<br>Or maybe fifth or sixth because of DMJii.</br></br>  <br>Gross.

Not even worth the effort. He would rather circlejerk</br>  <br>If you already paid for it, you deserve to either have your money back, or tell him that he needs to hurry up.<br><br>If you only suggested the idea of what you want, and haven't actually paid him, then yeah, you might as well go commission someone else.</br></br></br>  <br>about what was your comission?</br>  <br>I paid him but it really isnt worth the headache. If the peanuts are worth that much to him so be it</br>  <br>No, no, go fucking say something.<br>You gave him your money to draw something for you. If that person has not drawn somethign for you, he's broken an agreement that you had with him.<br><br>At the very least, go ahead and ask him, "Is there a WIP at all?"<br>If he says no, you can ask for your money back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah, anon! <br>Fuck yeah... <br>https://<span>youtu.be/0p_1QSUsbsM  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I tried to be as rough as possible.</br>  <br>You're too nice, mr boa</br>  <br> commission an artist <br> he stalls a lot, people who talk to him mention him feeling down <br> discounts me half the price because he feels bad about being slow <br> still slow, occasionally shows up in drawthreads here and there doing the odd request <br> long gaps between hearing from him, send him an e-mail every other week or so to see if he's done any progress <br> only responds sometimes <br> eventually stops responding entirely <br> nobody else has heard of him <br> it's been over a year now since I first made the commission <br>F-fuck...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The suggestion makes it sexier.</br>  <br>And that's why I'm afraid to commission anybody.</br>  <br><br>Publicly shame them, they deserve it for being shitty with no commitment.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure the first one is dead</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>It isnt worth it to me. Chances are if he does have a wip they will just finish it with a half hearted attempt</br>  <br>I've commissioned plenty of people before, it practically always goes well, I may not be 100% happy with the end result sometimes, but I try to be grateful anyways, most artists are willing to work things out and do edits/changes as we go along, and I'm always willing to pay half up front, it tends to work 9 times out of 10.<br><br>At this point, I don't even care about the picture, it was just 35 dollars, I hope the nigga ain't dead, I'd feel really bad about it because he seemed like such a nice guy.</br></br></br>  <br>I-I can't do that, I'd feel terrible about it!<br><br><br>NO! Don't say that ;____;</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yess thanks boa, the suggestiveness I think is really nice. Cheers!</br>  <br>rather not run the risk of a huge mess especially given how the threads have been lately. it will only ever backfire</br>  <br>Did you pay them already?<br><br><br>Fuck the police.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think it's something worth mentioning in these threads.</br></br>  <br>id rather not run the risk of having my waifu shitposted into the ground by artists and requesters alike. with the way these threads are some entitlement card will be pulled out or something or I will be put on some blacklist</br>   Weekend soon <br>Is your request ready?</br>  <br>I paid him half upfront, but after a long while of not hearing from him, he said that he felt bad that he was taking so long and that I didn't have to pay the rest. I don't remember exactly, but he even mentioned the possibility of a freebie I think, like at some later date.<br><br>We kept going some back and forth, he kept showing progress, we talked some back and forth, all that.<br><br>But now I haven't heard from him in several months, he's not responded to any of my mails in that time and nobody else has heard from him. I'm legit fearing that he's killed himself and I sort of feel really guilty about it for some reason.<br><br>Do I want to hear from him again and see my commission finished? Yes, of course, but if he just responds with "I'm sorry, I can't do it, I've got too much shit going on my life right now, I'm sorry I've let you down" I'll take that and be happy because I liked him and don't want him to die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tons and tons of requests stockpiled <br> not requesting this weekend </br></br>  <br>you paid this guy money. If anything hes gonna be the one getting shitposted</br>  More or less done with the expressions of the sprite, that was pretty fun to make. And ended up making some kind of character profile card with the background of the ps3 game.<br><br> I wanted to continue right away with Rena but I suddenly remembered I have a family "reunion" today far from my house and computer that will last until next wednesday, fuck me </br></br>  <br>maybe he got frustrated with art and quit completely</br>  <br>where is full version?<br><br><br>boa pls</br></br></br></br>  Can I commission 34?  <br>I wish I could believe that. there are far too many excuses used in these threads that favor everybody being totally innocent</br>  <br>Nice work.</br>  <br>Gotdamn, I wanna slap you.<br>Stop being a nigga and pm the dude.</br></br>  <br>http://3fourdraws.tumblr.com/post/9<wbr>1824663106/commission<br><br>She's asian and draws 30 hours a day, guaranteed fast delivery</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> tfw can't decide whether you're going to pick a request from your normal request list or from your list of loli waifu request </br>  <br> She </br>  <br>Looks cool.</br>  <br> he still doesn't know 34 is grill </br>  <br> he </br>  Requesting sad Cecilia with no drills  <br> $30 for a full bodied watercolor <br>This motherfucker...<br>I'm commissioning 34 for sure.</br></br></br>  <br> 9 times out of ten <br>whats the story for that 1 out of ten?</br></br>  <br> 150$ dollars for a drawing <br>Goddamn it's expensive but seeing my waifu like that.I'm conflicted.</br></br>  <br>You sounds like a nice person. I think if you told the guy exactly what you posted he would be more than happy to try and wrap things up for you. <br><br>I took commissions for a while and tried really hard to just keep in contact with people but after picking up a job 6 days a week I couldn't get anything done in less than a month and I felt really guilty about everything. Stopped taking them and just dropped off the map after finishing up things. I might just do like dollar commissions for fun but it got mentally stressful<br><br>I think both parties get way too guilty for no reason way too easily</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would actually be $262.50 if you wanted it to be a full body pic.</br>  Requesting Kotomine Kirei in this pose, text optional  <br><br>I've got  $125 in Amazon.ca giftcards  so the medium is quite a bit out of my budget. Do either of these seem worth the price?<br><br> http://www.amazon.ca/Huion-H610-Pro<wbr>-Graphics-Express-keys/dp/B00GWYYXV<wbr>0/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=14364<wbr>93173&amp;sr=1-4</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br> http://www.amazon.ca/Ugee-Graphics-<wbr>Digital-Drawing-10x6-Black/dp/B00KX<wbr>UMZLO/ref=sr_1_8?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1<wbr>436493274&amp;sr=1-8</wbr></wbr></wbr> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wooooooooooohat. Fuck jew.</br>  Should one learn to draw 3dpd before drawing waifus?  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Eh, I paid $350 for my favorite artist. He's pretty famous so it was worth it getting waifu in his gallery, although he did it with traditional media which I found somewhat less exciting than his digital works.<br><br>Well, my point is that $150 is reasonable.<br><br><br>Full body is overrated unless you're a footfag. All you do is complicate the composition for the sake of some shins.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no but it definitely helps.</br>  <br>... hes just posted it?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> tfw that's 1/10 of my monthly wage <br> tfw I would still pay for that <br>And I'm a fucking stingy man.</br></br></br>  I want a picture of Cobra (from Space Adventure Cobra) and Dandy (from Space Dandy) hanging out together. What is the progress on this?  <br>Well her highest tier picture looks fucking stunning. I could see a company commissioning her for promo art. So the price might not be too bad.</br>  <br>But I want to see my waifu's cute feet and shins.</br>  I'd like Ravel or Koneko from DxD<br>As lewd as possible</br>  <br>i've head good things about huion but I have never used them personally, maybe someone here has.</br>  Requesting Satou Shouji and Aoki Daigo from Shokugeki no Soma engaged in yankee behavior. Anything from fighting over mirror space fixing their hair in the morning, to squatting in front of a Williams-Sonoma giving people the stink eye would be fine.  Requesting these two fucking like http://imgur.com/a/YWsZE or http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=31057 or or something competitive like mud wrestling; alternatively this with any of the other goddesses and their counterparts (ie Vert, Blanc)</wbr>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Yes. Its part of the basics.</br>  A drawing of this please  <br>No, that takes too long<br>Anime drawing is easier than 3dpd.</br></br>  <br>Yes, and don't listen to any schmuck that says you can learn both at the same time.<br>It will only pollute your fundamentals with stylistics.<br>As  is demonstrating, it's just a shortcut.</br></br></br>  This one is for drawfags. Where does one start learning how to draw ? My skills are pratictally 0 where I can't even draw a stick man properly. Which sources should I look for and what absolute necessarities should I learn first?  <br>Nah man, that just proves you're a lazy faggot.<br>Trust me, I studied anime drawing more and because of that stupid fucking choice I fucking suck at drawing especially proportions. <br>Don't be like me, start from the basics.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck that, i'm not commissioning.</br>  <br>R<br>e<br>a<br>d<br><br>L<br>o<br>o<br>m<br>i<br>s</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>never underestimate mechanical practice, circles straight lines, ellipses, gradients, etc.</br>  <br>But that's only for the highest tier option. I'd pay the $80 for the clean color soft shaded full body one. That's comparable to other artists.</br>  <br>If you learn to draw from anime you will only learn that particular style, not the mechanics that it's built on. <br><br>Everything in anime is stylized which means a lot of detail was removed. knowing what detail to remove when comes from drawing 3d stuff. <br><br>Like for instance the nose is usually just one line. But knowing what that line represents is only possible if you know the human body and thats the only way you'll be able to place it properly from every angle.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering it takes about a day to do something like that 150 isn't really much.</br>  I think the mods are Kallencucks because they deleted the last C.C. thread.<br><br>Here's a tribute to the best girl.</br></br>  Daily reminder that this is best girl, and Kurisu is a smelly know-it-all bitch  tuturuu<br> Suzu is 2nd best </br>  I want to smell her.  <br><br>I wonder what her farts smell like</br></br>  Kurisu&gt;Suzu&gt;Mayuri&gt;Luka&gt;Faris&gt;Moeka<wbr></wbr>  <br> Dr. Pepper </br>  <br>Christina&gt;Faris&gt;Suzuya&gt;Luka&gt;Moeka&gt;M<wbr>ayuri</wbr></br>  <br><br> you'll never have a qt3.14 scientist gf to bicker with <br><br><br>I hate life</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> liking autistic girls <br> not posting the best autistic girl </br></br>  Waifu2x is some shit.

Though it seems I remembered correctly that she sleeps on a park bench. So my question still stands.</br>  <br>According to her Phenogram route she atleast has a tent to sleep in.</br>  <br><br>This, Kurisu being stinky only makes me like her more.</br></br>  <br>Shit, I swear I saw a beautiful girl on youtube who had the same hairstyle and beautiful eyes. Looked exactly like her. Gotta find it again somehow.</br>  <br>If you find it, post it so I can be disappointed again</br>  <br>It's pretty much impossible. It was a video response to a certain video, but video responses are dead because Google doesn't like people connecting with each other. I finished watching Steins Gate just recently and remembered that I saw a girl many years ago, who looked almost exactly like that. Especially the hairstyle and the greenish-blue eyes.</br>  <br>I'm not into gay shit</br>  <br>I decided to give it another quick read, and I realized that the first time I read it I had no idea who 4°C was. Now the cameos are pretty funny, seeing him suffer</br>  <br>What the baka did you just fucking say about me, you little baka?

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Glorious Nippon Time Machine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little bakabakashi. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn hentai. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  Hey, remember that time when Kurisu was anything less than perfect?<br><br>Yeah, me neither.</br></br>  Do you think Okabe had the Reading Steiner ability because for the universe to have Time Travel they had to have someone to observe its changes across world lines; otherwise the nature of time travel would be utterly pointless if there were no one to actually observe its existence<br><br>This is riding on the whole thing about things only existing once they are observed</br></br>  <br>Everyone has reading steiner to some degree, okabe was just lucky enough to have it strongly.</br>  <br><br>If only the anime didn't make it out to be some deus ex machina for other people to get reading steiner, the VN made it seem like less of an asspull</br></br>  <br>I cant remember the anime too clearly apart from butchering moeka/braun but how did they asspull it? I mean with faris and luka I thought it flowed pretty naturally it is something everyone has it a bit</br>  <br>Not him, but anon may have been referring to how they handled it in the OVA</br>  <br>The movie was bad too.</br>  <br>dat drunk kurisu, tho</br>  <br>I remember, anon. Although I never actually got around to watching the movie.</br>  <br>Wish the movie was about funny romantic antics instead of bad writing.</br>  <br>I still love the idea of a Kurisu-centric drunk escapade comedy in the vein of The Hangover -- but with time travel and suffering</br>  <br>I still love the idea of okabe retelling his adventures while kurizu sits there blushing and tsundereing hearing all of it.</br>  <br>I just want something with a deredere Kurisu<br>Is that too much to ask?</br></br>  <br> they try to sabotage SERN together <br> kurisu is so deredere okabe doesnt know what to do anymore </br></br>  <br><br> dere kurisu <br> okabe spilling his spaghetti <br><br>would watch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So when we say the Upa mask girl is non-canon, does she actually contradict any established canon or is it just Word of God?</br>  <br>Different events for the same worldline, divergence.</br>  <br>What different events? Only one world line is depicted, in chronological order from Suzuha's perspective, until Okabe undoes his d-mail at the end.</br>  Is the movie that bad?  <br><br>it's not terrible, but they could have done a lot more with it than they did. <br><br>I mean all it is is a reverse roles movie where kurisu is the hero and okibe is the damsel in distress. <br><br>It was kind of a cop-out so they could make kurisu a little more dere, but meh.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it canon?<br>I remember reading that it's canon to the VN.</br></br>  <br> kurisu will never confess that she loves you even though you are a stupid chuuni blockhead. </br>  <br><br>Oh yeah it's definitely canon, since Kurisu is the one that gave him his first kiss as a teen, but still, it just felt lacking. <br><br>It was a sweet movie that made my heart warm but still, nothing substancial</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> still haven't watched that or the tamako market movie <br><br>What the fuck is wrong with me? I haven't stopped watching anime, but these movies just don't have the pull. Am I growing a taste?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I should watch it then, thanks for the answers anon.</br>  <br> lying on the internet <br>the movie wasn't canon in any way shape or form</br></br>  <br>lukafag I'm guessing?</br>  <br>It contradicts canon in the VN, so unless 5pb put out something that says "THIS IS CANON", I refuse to believe that it is</br>  <br>Not him, but it's non-canon. It wasn't handled by any of the original writers and contradicts all the stuff suggested in the original VN.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=y0P<wbr>iPld3_lg</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Zero anime when? And how depressing do you think it's gonna be?<br>Also which designs do you prefer, adaptation or Huke's revised ones?</br></br></br>  <br>Kind of a tossup for me. Some of them I prefer Huke's; some of them (especially the midget) I prefer the other ones</br>  <br>Huke's revised ones, for sure. Exception being Okabe, I found him all normalfag-like to be more depressing than huke's simply depressed Okabe. I also liked Maho's old clothes a bit better.</br>  <br>Why does huke's professor look like he's half dead?</br>  <br>I agree. Although that doujin is shit.</br>  <br><br>Actually, are those two Okabe designs comparable? Previews suggest that's Okabe's design for the post-war portion of Steins;Gate0, not the Epigraph equivalent content.</br></br>  <br>Knowing Huke and laziness. That's the Okabe we're getting in the game.</br>  <br>I don't like how Fubuki has inexplicably become !!NOT CHIE!! in Huke's design. Plus I don't like Zero Okabe either. Also I prefer manga Leskinen. He looks like a vampire in Zero.</br>  <br>But the question is whether the Epigraph portion is all from his perspective or not, leaving that sprite to be used after the time skip.</br>  Everyone who has taste knows that Moeka is best girl  <br>Can you state a best girl by pointing her good features, and not other girl's bad features?<br>Then again I guess you're too primitive.</br></br>  <br>Best for beating, maybe.</br>  <br>I love huke's Fubuki. She's immeasurably better than Chie in design, too.</br>  <br> Operator Suzuha <br><br>I NEED MORE<br><br>Which reminds me, I really hope we get to see Suzuha go full operator at some point in 0. That would be so fucking good</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if we see her go full Operator, but I do know in Altair there's a  fully naked fistfight between her and someone. </br>  <br>Lucky for you, I like those pics, even if she isn't best girl.</br>  <br>Mayuri&gt;Suzuha&gt;Kirisu&gt;Ruka&gt;Moeka&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fayris<br><br>Fayris most annoying character with the most annoying arc</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Wow you managed to spell three character names wrong.</br>  <br>More for you. God, going through these pictures I saved made me realize what a huge fag I am.</br>  <br><br>Not only that, but the order of the first three characters should be reversed as should the last three.<br><br>Kurisu &gt; Suzuha &gt; Mayuri &gt; Faris &gt; Moeka &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Luka<br><br>It's really quite astonishing how wrong one person can possibly be. Especially since Faris' ending is actually quite good. Way better than Lukako's.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These are amazing.<br><br>Suzuha's not even my favorite, but I love this shit.</br></br></br></br>  Why did Steins;Gate take off better than the others?  <br>The VN was a sleeper hit and the anime was an excellent adaptation -- way better than the one c;h got.<br><br> inb4 "b-b-but muh secondaries" <br><br>Fuck you, it was a good adaptation that did justice to its source material, even if it wasn't as good as its source material.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a good adaptation, not an excellent one. Still fucked up on a few things.</br>  <br>I'd like to say because it had an anime adaptation that wasn't shit, but I feel like it was more popular before that.<br><br><br>Everybody be operating.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>an ending doesn't make up for everything else in the arc<br>and yeah, my spelling sucks<br>deal with it, nerds</br></br></br></br>  Now we know the amount of people who likes Papi is really low, what about the second best girl? (obviously I'm talking about Rachnee being the best of the best). <br><br>ARE YOU READY FOR HORSE PUSSY AND PANCACKE NIPPLES?</br></br>    I hate you so much   horse pussy thread   I want to make favorite girl's heart go doki doki    Threadly reminder to imagine what paizuri with Cathyl would be like.

And my dick too of course. </br>  <br><br>The funny thing is that the main group are really the most boring and shittiest group. You have Miia who's irrelevant and turns into a jealousy gag. Cerea is completely boring with her chivalry shit, plus she has a filthy filled with shit Horse pussy. Also lets not forget she belongs to a race that a pitiful tradition of cucking. Papi is literally mentally challenged and Mero has a NTR fetish. Although Rachnera and maybe Suu are better than them<br><br>The MON squad are far superior in every way. You have Smith, Zombina, Tio, Manako, and Doppel who are great. Fuck, just Zombina and Smith themselves are so much better than the main group.</br></br></br></br>  puddi puddi  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br> Now we know the amount of people who likes Papi is really low <br>I'd rather say the amount of people who have her as their favorite is low.

You have dead girl, tall girl, one eye girl, and transforming girl, none really have any super different features.</br>  <br>Smith looks incredible on this shot. Wish Okayado would do something interesting with her but again, he's not even doing interesting shit with the main girls either.</br>   there are people in this thread, right now, who wouldn't tenderly love a horse pussy <br>Disgusting, all of you.</br>     Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.     <br> Rachnera <br> not cucking you </br></br>  <br>  loving a Horse pussy that is filthy and mixed with shit <br>  not disgusting  <br><br>Have you ever heard of good Hygiene?</br></br></br></br>  <br>LUCKY MOTHER FUCKER!</br>  <br>Stop posting this shit, I don't want to have to filter MON too.</br>  <br>That's because Rachenera literally has a two settings: Fuck and Lazy</br>  The cutest  <br>She's looks ugly as fuck here.</br>  <br>do you think she would cheat on darling?</br>  <br/>  <br>Thank you, based anon.</br>  <br>A while back I actually got this exact thing drawn on a drawthread in /h/.

Im not turned off by anything, be it horse pussy, kobold nips or killer fetish.</br>  Here's why Slime and Spider are the best girls.<br>Papi is too retarded to do anything  including sex <br>Mero masturbates to her NTR/cuck fetish<br>Miia masturbates to Darling and yells at people not to love darling.<br>Cerea does horse shit and is a fucking weeaboo.<br>Suu cooks and cleans and does chores and shit. She enjoys helping darling because she wants darling to have easier life, because she cares more.<br>Rachnee tries harder than everyone else not to hurt him. She's literally the only one whose never hurt darling, because she cares more than everyone else<br><br>Also Suu can make herself look like anything for sex, and Rachnee has literally any fetish you want, so both are best in bed. <br><br>I have explained best girls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My i all remind you:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cZt<wbr>ukAVvE34</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>To bad Miia's copying her gimmick off someone.</br>  <br>Miia is a cutie pie</br>  Is HS the only subs for this?  <br>Slut</br>  <br> Every time </br>  <br>I dont understand how your Miia argument is a bad thing.</br>  <br>no you may not.</br>  <br>she's an annoying bitch whose trying and failing to be a yandere.<br><br>Plus she gets in the way of superior girls.</br></br></br>  <br>I think he meant to say "masturbates ON Darling."<br><br>She's also a jealous, loud, egoistic cunt, so there's that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>more like miia can't cook and doesn't have any good personality traits outside those of liking darling</br></br>  DAH-LING  someone use this when they make a new thread<br><br>WHO'S BEST MONSTER GIRL??<br>(Includes Smith)<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4879011</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>jealousy is cute anon.</br>  <br> Pick one <br>You fucked up.</br></br>  <br><br>I keep misquoting myself.<br><br>Also skipped one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no bicycle cop <br>shit taste</br></br>  <br>A tame, quiet and, more importantly, non-violent jealousy might be cute.

I don't see anything wrong as long as you can teach her to have a little more restraint in her raping.</br>  <br> 100% sinister <br><br>Rachnee was okay with Lala killing both Miia and Darling</br></br></br>  <br><br> making Papi irrelevant <br>How, because she has big tits?

I really like Papi but the chapters dedicated to her are really bad in comparison to ones dedicated to other characters.  <br> normal breasts on a harpy <br> bird feet don't cover as much of her legs as Papi's. <br> No clawed wings for cute wing/hand expressions. <br>2/10 would not buy her ice cream.</br></br></br></br>  <br>are you a pedophile anon?</br>  <br> Was one of the first of her race to move in with a human. <br> Terrible cook <br> Unknowingly hurts her 'Darling' when sleeping <br> Gets mad when her 'Darling' tries to spend time with other girls <br><br>Miia's just Snake Lum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, because she's an older girl and older=better</br>  <br>At least she isn't drawn by Rumiko Takahashi or has green hair</br>  <br>what subs aren't censored?

I finished the first volume a while ago and I have to admit it is interesting so far. Haven't decided my favorite monster girl yet. But am I the only one that thinks that "you fuck the girl, you go to jail and she gets deported" law kind of stupid? Why does it have to exist?</br>  <br>In the case of monster girls, consider who you could be physically intimate with, without showing any negative reactions.</br>  <br>Nice blog.</br>  Post anime characters smoking.  <br>She looks like a total slut here but here's one of my favorite.</br>                  She returns to full creep mode this time.          tomoko reached a new depth of autism previously unknown to man   This whole chapter <br><br>Thanks for the dump</br></br>  I thought the author got their hand crushed or something. All better now, I assume?  I seriously can't stand this bitch.<br>What is wrong with her.<br>she is so pitiful it is cringeworthy but she takes it as a point of pride.<br><br>I only popped in this thread after a not being in these since the penis incident, people still big on buying it? Its just painful to read.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I had that happen to me a couple of months ago. I thought I would be able to have a nice night alone, but the guy I was staying with stayed in for like 3 hours in the hotel room with me.</br></br>  WHAT THA FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!?! IS ANON TROLLING ME WITH A FAKE CHAPTER?! TOMOKO CAN'T BE THIS AUTISTIC  Poor Sheep-chan  <br>Confirmed slut</br>  <br>the fuck. haven't read this in awhile but when did she lost her virgin pussy?</br>  <br><br>She's lying, obviously.</br></br>  <br>You serious? who would touch her? She's terrifying.</br>  <br> tfw I've been Tomoko in that page before <br>The pain of reading it is almost unbearable</br></br>  Holy shit this chapter.  Jesus fuck, why do people like her again?  <br>self-inserting is a powerful thing</br>  <br>she makes me feel better about myself<br><br> even though she's fictional </br></br></br>  I wanna stroke Tomoko's unkempt pubes  <br>How many irredeemable selfish, self-centered assholery has tomoko done? Has someone made a list?<br><br>The one the sticks out is when she was being a lazy bitch and didn't mail her brother's school application in. That's some life changing shit there</br></br></br>  <br>Because despite her total ineptitude at anything involving communication with other people I still have slight hope for her.</br>  Did the author got a relapse? I thought this trip was going to end with something good happening.  <br>WHY<br>DOES<br>TOMOKO<br>NEVER<br>LEARN?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people just want to watch the world burn.</br>  <br><br><br>I dunno, I think she was funny and so boss this chapter. It's so rare for a chapter to have Tomoko be so confident and having the upper hand.<br><br>When you watch moeshit, do it with pride. Fuck what anyone else thinks.</br></br></br></br></br>  This entire school trip story has been hilarious thing one after another. Kind of surprised at how many chapters it lasted too.  <br>Another one falls victim to Tomoko.</br>  Every time they release such a messy chapter I can't help but think that 4chan sending them all those penises has something to do. Like that must be quite a traumatizing experience that changes your life forever.  <br> why do people like her again <br>But nobody likes her, that's the whole point. You're supposed to feel kinda sorry for her, but she's actually a terrible person.</br></br>  THIS IS NOT THE ENDING I WANTED NOR EXPECTED  <br>shes lying her ass off like she always does in hopes it makes her sound cool, or because she wants to talk down to the other girl. Ether or, maybe both.</br>  <br>Actually, I think everything become better after the penis spam, maybe we need to send her some more again?</br>  <br>New mokoface :3</br>  <br>die</br>  i waited a month for this  <br>What kind of feelings is this image trying to convey?</br>    <br>She's a complex one. <br> <br>She lacks any sort of social skills or understanding (probably aspie) yet desparately wants to be liked. Despite wanting to be popular, in her mind she talks down and insults those who are popular, probably out of her deep-seeded frustration for not being able to be one of them. It looks so easy for them, yet she has the hardest time just talking. <br> <br>I root for her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's not really "terrible". The worst she does is tease the other girl about being a virgin. She acts superior because she spends her whole life feeling inferior. The truth is we've all done this sort of thing. Just like her appearance is plain, Tomoko is actually normal in this sense, its just that she fails to self censor sometimes.</br></br>  <br><br>Personally I prefer Tomoko at her lowest, so a lot of the field trip has been kinda dull for me.<br>This chapter was a fantastic return to form, though. Probably even worth the wait.</br></br></br>  <br> shower <br> panties <br> yuri anime <br> sleeping girl molested <br>The doujin are writting themselves</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People wont take advantage of it.<br><br>Very few pictures even draw her with pubes even though she's confirmed to have them</br></br></br>  <br>/a/nons spend so long putting women on pedestals of unattainable purity, the thought of a loser who spends all day masturbating is a pleasant refresher of "hey this person could actually like me for who i am"</br>  <br>Well, then we have to draw it by ourselves. /a/'s talent is limitless to my balls</br>  <br>I love Tomoko.</br>  well that was painful to read  <br> slut </br>  I just wanna platonic snuggle her scrawny body while we watch anime or play vidya.<br><br>No sex, just some friendly skinship to stave off the pain of being alone</br></br>  man i was expecting some titanic-tier fuckup, not some background character  Emoji girl lewds when  <br>She is creep as fuck</br>  <br>eh, I think we actually get a decent amount of pictures of her, and her pubes.
