So I am not sure why /a/ hate this so much. The "hur dur trapped in a gaem" is stale but it looks like he is going to be alone and the focus is shifting away from the game aspects and more towards being trapped in fantasy land. <br><br>Am I missing something or am I taking shitposting too seriously?  or am I just blinded by the skelly MC </br></br>  <br>Whose this semen demon</br>  <br>A retarded maid</br>  <br>He doesn't like demiurge, the guy who skins and tortures people.</br>  <br> So I am not sure why /a/ hate this so much. <br>That's news to me. Bar a few shitposters, I'd have sworn it had been received if not positively then neutrally. Especially after episode 2.</br></br>  <br>Everyone hates Demi which they should</br>  I'm scared guys<br>the first episode was great like log horizon season 1 and the second was as bad as any from log horizon season 2. I really want this to be good.</br>  <br>I kept seeing that is was the worst anime this season. I find that hard to be true when GOD EATER is airing.</br>  <br>see file name</br>  <br><br>What are you talking about? The whole scene with Ainz flying to the moon was good and also Albedo scenes were great.</br></br>  <br>Of course he would, however Sebas is less likely to cause unnecessary destruction and murder unlike the evil cast. Sebas and Cocytus are less likely to enslave you, while the rest of the guardians would probably have no qualms about it.</br>  <br>People jacking off to how great the mc is and the mc being the nicest guy ever doesnt make an episode good. That's all they did in ep 2.</br>  <br> implying Ainz isn't the biggest dick OG </br>  <br>Where? Just ignore them. Most of them just heard "MMORPG and didn't bother taking a second look.</br>  <br>They are his servants, they cant do anything BUT drool for him. I agree it doesnt excuse a whole episode of drooling over the MC though.</br>  <br>If you didn't get that it was the whole point of those scenes, you probably weren't paying attention. Momonga finding out how they see him means he HAS to keep up the act in front of them even if he didn't want. That should bring out a bit of the "conflict" people like you seem to be looking for.</br>  Is Dio going to be He-Man?  So after checking around the web, the general consensus is about 85% positive. Most people are really just wondering where the series is going. And Albedo is currently the best girl.  EEEY EEEY E<br><br>Im liking the opening too much.</br></br>  <br>I mean when I saw that it was another MMO game it turned me off too, but I am enjoying it so far. <br><br><br>I am hoping that it avoids any other "real world" people and trying to explain why the MC ended up here and instead focuses on them trying to take over the world.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I am hoping that it avoids any other "real world" people and trying to explain why the MC ended up here and instead focuses on them trying to take over the world. <br>Well you're in luck my friend. Keep watching.</br></br>  <br>I thought this was going to be full on comedy. Kind of disappointed that it turned out to be SAO#29321948.

Are you really going to claim that isn't her real name?</br>  <br><br>It's a crime to display those little butts.</br></br>    <br><br>This was so unnecessary. I remember facepalming hard when I first watched it.</br></br>  <br>The real crime would be not displaying Yuru butts.</br>  <br>a-are you okay?</br>  <br> This was so unnecessary. <br> facepalming <br><br>Remind me again, did we call 2010 and ask for their faggots?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ayano's pajamas accentuated her figure so much.</br>  <br>Seemed par for the course. I think sexual fanservice is boring, I just didn't focus on it.</br>  <br>What you say..?</br>  <br>I agree completely.</br>  <br><br>Do you guys possibly prefer dicks in your mouth, perchance?</br></br>  <br>You gay, son</br>  <br>Seeing it as sexual is your own problem. I thought it was a breath of fresh air seeing a bath scene where the characters aren't wearing towels for no reason.</br>  <br><br>I must claim responsibility for the thread's death. I killed it with my terrible Ayano pun. I'm so sorry. I feel so bad Baghdad.</br></br>  <br>p-please stop trying, you're literally worse than Kyouko</br>  <br><br> i didn't get this reaction when i made my flavour pun a few threads ago <br>does this mean i'm funny?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh stop it, Yui. You laughed, we all know it.</br></br>  <br>When they were in the hot tub it was fine, showing them standing around barely covered was unnecessary. The anime also had scenes like this and I didn't mind it because the focus was on something else. Even Chinatsu looking at Yui's back was about Chinatsu rather than Yui. <br>Although Akari having problems both times was funny. The bonk on the head sounded painful.</br></br>  <br>They didn't do the dirty kind of disgusting ecchi, just showed us the girls glorious little body to appreciate it.<br>If you can't, that's your problem.</br></br>  <br>Can't remember sorry<br><br><br> pic related </br></br></br></br>  <br> showing them standing around barely covered was unnecessary. <br>Being in that state of undress is actually pretty necessary for a bathhouse.<br>Excessive steam covering them from the shoulders down, or wearing a towel everywhere even though they're all friends hanging out at a bath would be unnecessary.</br></br></br>  Do these people ever become relevant?  <br>That's not what I mean at all. It's all about camera angles, or whatever the equivalent would be for anime. In  showing so much of the bath detracts from the scene. A close-up or something more dynamic would work better.<br><br><br>Also not what I mean. Scenes like  are a nice detail.<br>Also</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Himawari <br> not Ayano <br><br>Explain, Ukraine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally who<br>  no really who  </br></br>  <br>In a spinoff maybe.</br>  <br>Yuru reset</br>  <br> Futanari Himawari <br>If only</br></br>  <br> showing so much of the bath detracts from the scene. <br>It's not the most interesting shot, I guess, but I don't think it's bad. Honestly I can't think of other ways to handle showing Sakurako pranking Himawari while she's washing her hair that aren't unavoidably ecchi.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128181668 <br>Fine I'm a bit biased because I'm not a pun person, but even I giggle at the grand pun exchange between Yui and Ayano.<br><br>You just need to get better material<br> Take it as a challenge and make me laugh </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not a pun person <br> using exclusively Yui reaction images <br><br>Irony = funny, amirite?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui gotta be kidding me.</br>  <br>That's because I'm a Yuifag, nothing wrong with that.<br><br><br>I chuckled</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you found that funny, you really are full of it Nunavat.</br></br>  <br>Ayano I'm not funny; you don't have to rub it in.</br>  <br><br> it's funny when Ayano exchanges puns with Yui, but not funny if literally everyone else tries the exact same pun scheme <br><br>10/10, I've taken the bait. Tell my parents that I love them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sakurako has NOTHING</br>  <br>When I saw the initial screens I thought I was going to feel the same way, but the actual scene was actually rather funny and tasteful, nothing too overtly lewd about it.</br>  <br>you can't be this retarded, even in the show when Ayano puns Yui laughs like an idiot, when Kyouko puns Yui doesn't even try to pretend it was funny</br>  <br>she has shampoo though???</br>  <br><br> cute girls that get embarassed easily <br> no one bats an eyelash in the OVA about going full nude in front of everyone else <br><br>I don't get it. Does the steam in bathhouses change your brain?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like everyone in Japan is so used to seeing each other naked that body-accentuating clothes are what they find lewd.</br>  <br>It's different for bath houses. In fact bath scene nudity isn't even considered ecchi, and happens even in the most innocent series, becuase nips are used to naked bodies in public baths.</br>  <br>I only called it sexual because another anon said he face-palmed and thought he shouldn't mind it so much. But I did think it was a bit boring, sorry.</br>    <br>I enjoyed the gags that they had in the bathhouse, but humour is subjective. I respect your opinion, anon-chan!</br>  <br><br> "I respect your opinion" <br><br>Am I even on 4chan right now? Where am I?</br></br></br></br>  <br>In a comfy yuru yuri thread.</br>  There's a distinct lack of Chitose art on Pixiv and Danbooru. How sad.  Which Yuru do you think is Namori's favourite?  <br>Akari. That's why she bullies her.</br>  <br>Which Yuru got her own spinoff, anon?</br>    <br>Nadeshiko!</br>  <br> I'd like to think so because Akari is my favourite too. <br><br><br>Honestly I think that indicates that she wanted to show more of Nadeshiko and Hanako than Sakurako being her fave.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Sakurako is my favourite, but she loves Akari-chan so of course I do too!</br>  <br>That always confuses me. I don't think it would matter if I was used to communal bathing or not, if I were in a bath with my crush I would freak out, but it's like that always gets ignored. Octave being a notable exception.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Anyways I think Akari and Sakurako fans have the largest fanbase overlap between any Yurus, so either choice is fine.<br>They are also the two popularity poll winners among nips.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> It's a tie between Best Genkis</br></br>  <br>still mad about the het fling</br>  The OTP  <br>Except Kyoko is actually good at things</br>  <br>Funny anon, now that you mention it I realize that my top three girls are essentially Akari, her developing lover, and her fangirl. Basically Akari is the pillar of my Yuru love and her bestness is what decides who follows her.</br>  <br>Different culture.<br>You see that even lolis get bath scenes for example in anime, while they have a hard time getting any real fanservice, and it's because of that same reason too.<br>Bathhouse nudity is just natural in japan. Unless they take extra efford making it ecchi, it isn't even considered lewd or fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakurako is good at being cute, fun, and beautiful.</br>  <br> Where's the yuru thread, yuris? <br>on /v/<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/v/302810737 </br></br></br>  <br> Still having best girl arguments <br> Still talking about China being a rapist <br>I bet the majority of them have never even made it past 5 chapters of the manga.</br></br></br>    <br>Stay mad. Octave is perfect.</br>  <br>Sakurako is bad and drawing, studying, cooking, and any kind of skill required for a student council member.</br>  <br>There's a distinct lack of Chitose in general.</br>  <br> her developing lover <br>Is that Chinatsu?<br>Just asking because my top three are Akari &gt; Sakurako &gt; Chinatsu.</br></br></br>  <br>I love Octave, but I really do hate how the MC had sex with a dude she didn't know. I don't care that he was a dude, I'd be just as mad if it was a girl. She didn't know the person, and was already in love with a beautiful woman. It makes me sick thinking about what she put herself and Setsuko through.</br>  <br>Her being childish is one of Sakurako's most endearing qualities.</br>  <br>i exhaled through my nose at a faster rate than normal for almost a second</br>  <br>W-we have the exact same best girl order.<br>Can I be your friend, anon-chan?</br></br>  <br>I just want her to be good, but I can't find any redeeming qualities for her.<br><br>Even the spinoff manga doesn't make it all that easier.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's because she's terrible. Setsuko was partially responsible for it as well.</br>    <br>Sure.</br>  <br>It just really broke my heart. Even thinking about it now makes me feel awful  and I kind of want to cry. </br>  <br>Good at what?<br>Like I said, she has many endearing and lovely features.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry anon. tbh it is pretty heartbreaking, for both parties. But at least they discuss it (eventually) and move past it! That's why I actually like it as an aspect of the story. Even though reading it makes you feel like crap.</br>  <br>She and Himawari love each other. Do you really want to ruin that love by changing them?</br>  <br>i don't understand the third from the left in the top row...</br>  <br>I don't feel like Sakurako being less of a useless shit would ruin their love. If anything, Himawari loves Sakurako in spite of her personality most of the time and she honestly deserves more.</br>  <br>Whoever edited the picture is a shit.</br>  <br><br><br>Ren-chon is also some 120-ish cm actually.<br>There was some joke about it that I don't remember exactly, maybe something about the top of her hair gave her extra height.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why beside Koma-chan's height it says "self-proclaimed". Learn to read first.</br>  <br>She's a good cook. She made pancakes. That's about it, I think</br>  Chitose a best  <br>More please. Her and Chinatsu. Those are the two I wish to lewd.</br>    <br>Is it possible to lewd Chinatsu?</br>  <br>Thank you.<br><br><br>I hope so. I mean I like all of them but Chitose and Chinatsu are amazing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, Chinatsu really is quite sensual.</br>  Chinatsu is a satan  <br>Do they have pubic hair?</br>  <br>What went wrong after the first volume?</br>  <br>I like to think they shave/wax, but that's only because I'm a pervert.</br>  <br><br>I think the smaller girls don't have any, or just have weak, silky, hard to notice pubes.<br>Chinatsu is probably smooth as a newborn though.</br></br></br>    <br> Chinatsu is probably smooth as a newborn though </br>  <br>The thought makes me very horny. I really want to feel.</br>   be Production IMS <br> adapt Twintails <br> fuck up god-tier chara design <br> adapt Dandelion drawn by the same artist <br> somehow don't fuck it up <br><br>Why is this allowed?<br>I don't know whether to be glad they didn't fuck up Dandelion or mad they fucked up Twintails first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to fuck all the twintails!  <br>What minor detail did they "fuck up" in Tailred's design that triggered your autism?</br>  <br>Well for one thing Dandelion actually looks like the original art.<br>Twintails doesn't.</br></br>  <br>I want to fuck Akane's thighs so bad.</br>  <br>They hired a different anime director and character designer for Dandelion.</br>  <br>BUDGET<br><br>Twintails needs like 48 episodes and twice the budget from UBW to be adapted properly. <br><br>Also the chara design in twintails looks great, slightly different sure, but honestly great</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And what part exactly triggered your autism?</br>    There's different character designers for each show.<br><br>The studio isn't the cause of that.</br></br>    <br>Solar a best.</br>    <br>Flat a best, Tailred &gt; Solar</br>  Do you think Twintails blew its budget to get Ikeda to voice personified love of twintails?  <br>I don't like the way faces are drawn in the Twintail anime.<br><br>They look lot less lively compared to the LN drawings. The range of emotion feels more limited.</br></br></br>  <br>Quite possible they blew the budget early on with some VA choices, but what hurt this the most was definitely falling behind schedule, having to outsource 3 episodes to korean studios and barely catching up in the last 3 episodes.</br>  <br>It will be such a shame if the only adaptation we ever get is that one cour. What a waste of a great idea.</br>  <br>Artist fault, in any case the one got one hit the most was Aika. She looks full blown moe in several LN drawings while she looks more aggressive in the anime.<br>Honestly I do preffer the anime design, body proportions look better too.</br></br>  <br>Shit's depressing. I love the VA choices and they definitely added to my enjoyment of the series, but if hiring the VA's fucked with the budget, I would have preferred Shimazaki voicing everyone or something.</br>  <br> Akane <br> for cum and country </br></br>  <br>Again, budget has an impact for how much animation you can cram in an episode, but what hurt twintails so much was falling behind the schedule so hard that the studio had to outsource 3 eps to barely have enough time to put out the last 3.<br>More cup noodles for more animators, but bad time management will fuck you up.</br></br>  <br>Moetron Aika</br>  <br>I learned that much from Shirobako, but damn this could have been a goddamn masterpiece. I still listen to the ED, and imagine what could have been.</br>  <br> that chest bulge <br>Did the anime nerf Aika's chest or something?</br></br>  <br>Didn't they fixed everything for BDs?</br>  <br>Yes, because flat chest jokes are easier when there's no chest to speak of rather than modest sized chesticles.</br>  Greetings, time for this month's edition of tall girl hijinx and ecchi shenanigans.

Before Teru.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not if I support her tits.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she has a personal assistant.</br>  <br><br>Well, that explains why her growth is so stunted.<br><br>But what's with the obsession with Honors tiles?</br></br></br></br>  <br>pssst, Toki is... sleeping.</br>  <br>I want to sleep with Toki!</br>  <br><br>It's not as fun as it would seem.</br></br>  <br>OH MY GOD</br>  <br><br>But of course. Just look at all the shading Ritz has done just on her alone, nevermind the scenes with her.</br></br>  <br>But Shinohayu is about Saki's sister.</br>    <br>Don't you know that Shino is Saki's sister?</br>  <br><br>Massive Mahjong Mammaries.</br></br>  <br><br>Not this shit again.</br></br>  <br><br>I held off fapping to her yesterday/today. It took a monumental effort on my part, but willpower and video games pulled me through.</br></br>  <br><br>Not far off, actually, since they contain all those&lt;nodoka&gt;*cough*SOA*cough*</br></br>  <br><br>Singularity, Invasion, and/or exodus from this doomed blue marble. Pluto looked like it could work, if you could somehow bring enough tech to overcome the lack of pretty much any energy sources. It's far enough from all the noise down here at any rate.</br></br>  <br><br>Can mahjong lesbians have sex in space?</br></br>  <br><br>According to Mairu, it helps to strap yourselves in.</br></br>  <br><br>The tiles will need to be magnetized on a magnetizable table, or the other way around.<br><br>Sticks too, I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but not while playing mahjong.<br>The tiles fly all over the place.</br></br>  <br>With magnetic tiles, you'd have problems with them either sticking together or flying apart. Poles attracting and repelling etc.; dora indicator flip would be tricky.<br>With a magnetic table and metal tiles, you'd have problems building the wall. It would be hard to make the table strong enough to hold the top row, but weak enough to release the bottom row.</br></br>  <br>They'll probably invent simulated gravity before we're far enough along to have lesbians playing mahjong in space.</br>  <br>I love turkey</br>   game today with friends <br> win one round for 2000 <br> lose one round for 2900 <br> don't play into any hands for the rest of the game <br> end with 13000 points <br>Fuck this game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems like it'd be easiest to make something like a slotted table where you just latch in the tiles rather than magnets. Of course, the walls would look kind of ugly(basically a non-revealed version of Nodoka's experiment with the walls) but it would work in space.<br><br>It's not pure, but it's possible.</br></br></br>  <br> implying not playing into hands is an accomplishment <br>Winning is for winners, kid</br></br>  <br>Nodoka did an experiment with the walls? When was that?</br>  <br>My luck is too terrible to actually finish hands.</br>  Is this a leak or old?  <br>Translation- I suck at mahjong<br>At least you're good at blogging.<br><br><br>Seems new but isn't it a little too early for that sort of flashback?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> my luck is too terrible <br>This isn't dice, this is mahjong. There's a lot more to it than just getting lucky. If you almost never win it's because you're bad.</br></br>  <br>Chapter 4; Nodoka playing 1P to see if she could score +/-0 like Saki.</br>    this is mahjong. There's a lot more to it than just getting lucky. <br>Right.</br>  <br>Oh I thought it would be something like Nodoka playing against Saki with the wall revealed to see what happens, but that would probably be illegal in the saki universe.</br>  <br><br>The only thing you have nearly 100% control over and is skill based is your defense, hence why I barely ever deal in.<br>Not matter how well you develop your hand, if the right tiles aren't drawn/discarded then you're literally out of luck.</br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for not knowing shit.<br>There is literally no luck involved in mahjong. Anyone who disagrees is clearly not even past the beginner skill level.</br></br>  If luck is a factor in mahjong then how does Teru win all the time?<br>Checkmate SOAtheists</br>  <br>A winner makes their own luck. Champions are opportunistic.</br>  <br> There is literally no luck involved in mahjong. <br>Nigga please.<br>I even heard a story from the members our the official mahjong club, whore ended up placing rather highly in a recent tournament because of a single yakuman, despite sucking in all of her other games.<br><br> But yeah, playing devils advocate is fun. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*where she<br>Fuck, time to sleep.</br></br>  <br> whore <br>Do you have to be so rude to Shino's mother?</br></br>  <br>What the hell IS Mihoko's power? Does it give some sort of approximate overview of the table? In games it tells you how much of each color a player has in their hands etc but is that really what it does in manga-canon?</br>  <br>It's one of those vague "sense the flow" powers that tells us nothing about it.</br>  <br>She uses her magical eyeball to notice how people organize their hand and discard to guess what sort of yaku they have.</br>  <br>It's like a tell finder, think Akado but without the electronic equipment</br>  <br> What the hell IS Mihoko's power? <br>The power to make me want her to suck me off.</br></br>  Why do japs love Chikako so much?  <br>blonde fetish</br>  <br>Do they? How so?<br><br>Because she's obviously the best waifubait in the series. I want to have 9 kids with her in a giant christian household.</br></br></br>  <br>Deep in their hearts they long for Christians to show them the way. They long to know the Gospel. The desire is in the heart of every human, but sometimes it takes a catalyst in the form of an anime girl to awaken in.</br>  <br>They always post her and seem to think she's yandere for Sawaya.</br>  <br>I hope Uzusan can free Nodoka from the demons that are holding her.</br>  <br><br>that looks like young Saki hair, but slightly older.<br><br><br>She has sight beyond sight.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always see Yuan and Sawaya. I dont think there are any good usuzan lesbianisms. They could just be  heterosexual   friends .<br><br>I mean, they are bad at mahjong and all.</br></br></br>  <br>This man has the right ideas.

It makes the most sense that she stops time and literally walks around the table.<br><br>100% not sarcasm, btw.</br></br></br>  When will we get a mahjong power that skips time? <br>Like you turn happens and you discard whatever tile you pick up but you don't remember it happening.</br>  <br>I don't understand how that would be useful at all. <br>Maybe against Teru, so you could lessen the terror experienced by a few turns.</br></br>  <br>It could stop someone from getting their winning tile.</br>  <br>But you'd discard whatever you draw. Isn't that just as dangerous?</br>  <br>Oh wait I meant to say that the user isn't affected by the ability.</br>  <br> Like you turn happens and you discard whatever tile you pick up but you don't remember it happening. <br>You partially described Ippan play</br></br>  <br>So the ability would force the opponents to discard whatever they draw, even if it was useful to their hands?<br>That's kind of crazy, honestly.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128157162 <br> Read the fucking thread. </br>  <br>I guess to balance it you could turn it into a Toki like thing.

Saki is putting on a show of emotion so Kyouko will join her alliance to beat Nelly and Sawaya. It's all about emotional manipulation.<br>Saki is the opposite of Yuuki. Saki uses the East round to gather info on her opponent's tendencies, and then uses flow control to destroy everyone in the South round. Or if they're playing 2 hanchans, Saki may hold off until the second one. She's done this before.</br></br>  i need a good mahjong app for android.  <br>This is why Teru didn't want to watch Saki's match.

Reposting<br><br>Reiji's accomplishments so far:<br> Making bootlegs <br> Brainwashing his subordinates <br> Stealing Yuto's duel disk <br> Letting Yuto die <br> Pissing off Shun with Heartland field and joking about it <br> Muh Serena <br> Getting Mitchie and Teppei killed with penalty <br> Creating propaganda to get child soldiers <br> KEEPING PENALTY WHEN GOING TO SYNCHRO </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuto's death and the fact that Ruri will never see him again breaks my heart.<br>I wonder how Shun will break the news to her in their eventual reunion</br></br>  <br> I wonder how Shun will break the news to her in their eventual reunion <br><br><br> Oh by the way, that annoying guy who used to stalk you is kinda dead. Not sure on the details. </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Ruri and Yuuto weren't head over heels for each other <br>Yuri/Serena is the only exception to the Yuu/Ruri rule</br></br>  <br>But he also gave Yuya his first real defeat that broke Yuya's EGAO. While Yuya lost to Yuzu before, that was when Yuya didn't know what the Pendulums did and the duel itself had no actual consequence or impact. It was just something that was irrelevant in the long run.<br><br>Even the Sora vs Shun rematch, while Shun never seemed to care he was almost carded before he could save Ruri, was still relevant. It caused Serena to save Shun and resulted in Serena learning more about the Heartland invasion and herself joining the Lancers.<br><br>Whereas when Yuya got BTFO by Reiji, it had a far greater impact since Yuya was forced into the Lancers, suffered his first real loss, and it was Reiji's third duel across 50 episodes.<br><br>Though Reiji is quite possibly the WORST STRATEGIST EVER when it came to the Lancers. Then again, Reiji is the guy who thought he could recruit Sora into the Lancers (see episode 26, and less so in episode 35) despite Reiji knowing he is from Academia. Sora being from Academia while not being a counterpart of Yuya/Yuzu basically solidified he wasn't joining the Lancers.<br><br>TL;DR: Yuya vs Reiji rematch was a good duel, and Reiji is dumb for trying to recruit a kid drunk on Fusion Dimension nationalism to fight against the Fusion Dimension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuto maybe. Ruri probably only hung out with him because he had no other friends except for Shun and her.</br>   Zefras <br>I'd really rather you be quiet.</br>  <br>Reiji is no better than Leo with how he operates, I hope he'll be called out on it.</br>  <br>I swear he has some bullshit card that'll activate when he has to pay the 2000LP intrusion penalty.</br>  <br> Rewatchng episode 26 to see what you're talking about <br>sweet jesus look at that ass.</br></br>  <br>Yuri noticing how similar Reiji and Leo are would make sense considering Yuri is Leo's strongest subordinate. What if Yuri tries to get Reira on his side similarly to how Noa ended up using Mokuba as leverage over Kaiba? Though that all depends on Reira's opinion of his father, as well as whether Yuri is forbidden from carding Reira due to Reira being Leo's pure child.<br><br>Reiji will be called out on his shit, similarly to when Tron basically called Kaito a hypocrite who enjoyed taking people's souls. Its just a matter of who will get to call Reiji out. My main guesses are Yuya, Shun, Serena, or Yuri.</br></br></br>  <br>Does LP intrusion penalty count as effect damage or what?</br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br>The penalty at least has the cool factor</br>  <br>Not sure, to be honest. Common sense would dictate it's a payment, but "penalty" usually carries a posteriority, which isn't usually payment. But the Covenants are contracts yet they deal damage even though payments would make more thematic sense.<br><br><br>It'd be hilarious if it's considered damage and he uses it to SS Leonidas and go back to 4000LP the moment he enters a duel. But if so, Dennis could also abuse it with that flame eater.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That only applies to japanese electric batman.</br>  <br> This was back when Yuzu wasn't in Synchro Dimension and able to cheer Yuya on. <br> This was back when Sora wasn't an obviously evil Academia scumbag and actually helped Yuzu get good. <br> This was back when best dad had his daughter by his side and wasn't suffering ZETSUBOU from being told that his daughter was trapped in another dimension. <br> This was back when best mom had not gone full retard with her EGAO filler bullshit in episodes 52-53. <br> This was back when the three useless kids served as the useless characters. <br><br>To think there was a time when Yuya was actually happy and not an annoying Yuzufag, Yuzu was ARC-V's best girl because Serena didn't exist yet, and Sora was just a pure boy who taught Yuzu how to Fusion even though most of us expected him to be evil.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was something of a simpler time, back when the animation was terrible and the cards were worse.</br>  <br> To think there was a time when Yuya was actually happy and not an annoying Yuzufag <br><br>Reminds me of Judai being a Johanfag<br>in season 3. Although next episode Yuzu.wav will be put aside, and will be all about 'Protect Tau-sans Ideal'</br></br></br></br>  I love how everyone has their weird headcanons with Arc-V like Yuto was friendless or Ruri liked watching birds which explains Shun's deck.  <br> Yuzu.wav being put aside <br>More like the writers are remembering he has other issues than that The Yuzu.wav isn't stopping until Yuzu is back in Yuya's arms.</br></br>  <br>My favorite is Sawatari being Serena's snack butler.</br>  <br>Well both Shun and Ruri has bird names so it makes sense they like them.</br>  <br>Feel sorry for him, by far the most yugioh protagonist with psychological problems   Although that's how I like my MC's to be  </br>  <br>It was commonly accepted that the Johanfag Judai was best Judai</br>  <br>Caring for the main girl<br> Not best </br></br>  When the fuck did this come out?<br><br>WANTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</br></br>  <br>I actually don't mind Yuya sacrificing many things for the sake of Yuzu. Probably the compensation for too much homo in the past series</br>  <br>Wanting to protect your waifu and forsaking everything in the world to protect her are different. <br><br>I'm all for him trying to save or protect her, but he gives no fucks about anything else, Reiji and Crow both have told him to put a lid on it for now and he's still just MUH SADNESS, MUH YUZU!!<br><br>It took Jack calling his entertainment fucking garbage to snap him out of him for a little bit. Thank you based Kingu, his entertainment is garbage compared to yours.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NEVER<br>EVER<br>Tewart won't let it get released in the TCG, because he's got stupid ideas about iconic designs.</br></br></br>  <br>It's summer, go read a book or something.</br>  <br>so it's basically this faggot's fault?</br>  In hometown.

Apparently on Duelist Kingom deck size limit was maximum of 40.  <br>Tewart and the head judge iare everything wrong with the TCG actually, everything.</br>  <br>Fuck you, gimme the fucking list.<br><br><br>Can't we just hire some assassins or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br>spoiler that faggot</br>  <br>Kojima probably already has against everyone at Konami, I wouldn't worry about it.</br>  <br>Thank you based kojima</br>  I want to card this fucking xyz scum.  <br>Yuyas inheriting it as well<br> Tfw Yuzus butt is less squeezable than her husbandos </br></br>  <br>I love hungry Serena in general. I like to imagine she was pouting in prison because the food sucked</br>  <br>I think we all like to imagine that Anon. She probably just watched the Food Network on her fancy prison TV.</br>      <br>So, how are they suppose they abuse that in DK era?</br>  <br><br> we want the bioshock audience </br></br>  <br> This tomato hate </br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  when the fuck will Yuto's laundry get printed?  <br>I like the Tomato, he just needs to chill out.</br>  Arc V is the first series that has both best boys AND best girls, wich is kind of refreshing after all the previous series being boys club and the girls generally being fanservice devices (especially in ZeXal). Sure, Aki was nice to look at AND she had a personality but that kind of went south after the dark signer arc. Does anyone know if Yoshida is returning to the Yugioh anime or are we safe?  I found Ruris. A village of them!  <br> you will never live in a village full of Ruris </br>  <br>Shun.... you are getting me really worried.</br>  Reminder that Yugi's deck will be the Gaia, Black Luster Solider and Silent archetype support with Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl will be savedfor the duel against the villain character.  <br> Silent archetype support <br>We all know that it won't happen.  ;_: </br></br>  <br>Reminder that Kaiba is the main character of the movie and he has knee guards.</br>  <br>The people who saw the actual trailer keep saying they saw Silent Magician and Silent Swordsman in their manga looks.</br>  <br> annoying Yuzufag <br>I hadn't found his Yuzufaggotry to be annoying in the slightest, honestly. It's super refreshing, you'd never expect a Yu-Gi-Oh! MC to be this concerned over a girl (Yugi cared a lot about Anzu's safety, but not to the point of screaming her name to end the episode) and it's not a one-time thing, it is just yet another problem that Yuya continuously grapples with.<br><br>It's also nice that the -faggotry is reciprocated for once, you know?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the high level Silent Magician a celibate cake past her expiration date. Ultimately feeling jaded from what she have missed?</br>  <br>A Christmas Cake so old she was a Halloween Cake of the next year.</br>  <br> Ruritania <br>How do I move there?</br></br>  <br> An English gentleman on holiday, who fortuitously resembles the monarch, is persuaded to act as his political decoy in an attempt to save the situation <br><br>Do you look English? Do you resemble a monarch? Are you at all politically aware?</br></br></br>  <br> Do you resemble a monarch? <br>What do you think?</br></br>  <br>It'll be good if what you wanted is a gigantic amazonian Ruri.</br>  Holy crap, I'm dense. Yugi's deck is Warriors and Mages. Too bad there is no such archetype that exists.  <br>You're more of a Funky Comedian, I'd say</br>  <br> Yugi's deck is Warriors and Mages <br>Little Yugis deck was more rock and machine, with a couple spellcaster and warrior bosses</br></br>  <br>But Yugi's deck is magnets?</br>  <br>He mostly had Warriors, Spellcasters, Fiends Machine and Rock and a couple of oddballs here and there</br>  <br> No Marshmallon </br>  <br> no DMG </br>  <br>These monsters all like like shit from a generic RPG game. The Warrior and the mage look main character=ish while the marsh marshmellow looks like a generic level 1 enemy with the dragon and golem looking like dungon bosses. I'd love it if Kaz used new versions of them</br>  <br><br>EVERY<br>SINGLE<br>TIME<br>You post a deck list, someone WILL tell you what's wrong with your deck list.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dark Magician Girl is only magnetic in her...personality.</br>  I'm from the future<br>Yugo duels Dennis and wins, Dennis accidentally reveals he is a spy to Yugo because pawn of fusion<br>Crow beats Gongenzaka<br>Sawatari ties with Yuzu<br>Shinji beats Ninjabro barely<br>Reira duels ENJOY</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No DMG is fine since this seems to be based on Ceremonial duel deck and Yami had that. But Marshmallon is one of Yugis few decent cards</br>  Jack's new cards are just so incredibly good.  <br>Oh, neat, you can actually see the fucked up right horn on Scar right.</br>  <br> deck from duel arena <br><br> DMG <br> in Yugi's deck </br></br></br></br>  What's the point of Shinji? He hasn't done anything other than bringing junk food to the kids and being Crow's useless friend.  <br> in Yugi's deck <br><br>Unless Yugi retired from dueling in those 10 years before GX starts Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are still in his deck. Then again, he may of just stopped competing in national tournments and just uses a deck of his own for Eago duels every once and a while like Yusei does after 5D's and put the one he and Atem built together on world tour.</br></br></br>  <br>They've foreshadowed his upcoming rebellion in multiple episodes now anon, his episode is in 2 weeks</br>  <br>What old shit will they shill next after Jack/Crow becomes irrelevant in ARC-V?</br>  <br>Kotori.</br>  <br>Hard to say until we really establish what he's about in his duel. He could function as a more extreme revolutionary to force Crow to balance his current hatred of Tops to eventually work towards peace</br>  <br>Jean-Michel please, you are not even part of the Council.</br>  <br>Best girl only gets fresher with age</br>  <br><br><br>I still like Gadgets the most.</br></br></br>  <br>Cyber Dragons and Red-Eyes</br>  <br> that little peek <br><br>Huh, didn't expect that.<br><br>Too bad Yuma's so incredibly gay to the point that the next series' MC had to be almost obsessively straight, huh?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ojamas, Armed Dragon and WVXYZ</br>  Crimson Dragon appears in Arc-v<br>Yuya, Yugo, Crow, Jack, and Shinji become Signers later on in the Synchro arc</br>  <br>Nice fanfic</br>  How long until I can hear Reira's boku no turn again?  When is the manzai?  <br>At least a month.</br>  <br>I wonder what crazy hairstyle he is hidding under that cap.</br>  <br>Spade inspired no doubt to go with the suits theme of his family.</br>  <br>What is Reiji's symbol ?</br>  <br>It's a Jump promo. That means Shonen Jump Alpha will release it, since Tewart has no say in the matter</br>  <br>DiamonDs</br>  <br>That pic has me about as confused as the dinosaur bone.</br>  <br>So, we got DM, BLS, Gaia, Kuriboh, DMOC and Summoned Skull retrains and support.<br>When is it Magnet's turn to get retrains/support</br></br>  <br>Manjoume is based. That is all you need to know.</br>  <br>Reira's club. You can see it on his jacket.</br>  What if pic related voices a new guy in Arc-v?  <br>I don't know. Is he relevant?</br>  <br>That nigga ran three different decks I think. Or he combined them all together and it just magically worked...sometimes.</br>  <br>I'd like it if he voices someone outwardly antagonistic but is actually kind-hearted in the inside.<br><br>Also not pining after a girl who's clearly into someone else.<br><br>And hates grapes.</br></br></br></br></br>  You know, I was wondering for a while now, Who actually owns the fusion card Black Skull Dragon, Yugi or Joey?  <br>None they both magically make it</br>  <br> Implying Duelist Kingdom fusions actually existed in card form </br>  <br>Actually, 7 with the manga.<br>Chtonian, VWXYZ, Armed Dragon, Ojama, Meca-Insect, Light warriors and Dragon</br></br>  <br>With Asuka in that outfit it's no wonder Manjoume's dragon is roaring out bright red.</br>  All of this Black Luster Solider support and envoy of the beginning is still a better option. Why? If the next set has cards for Magician of Black Chaos I'm gonna run a muck with a leaf blower.  <br>And not one of them are actually playable. Sad.</br>  <br> a muck <br>Is amok you dumb nigger.</br></br>  <br>Shut up. I know what it is, I just wanted to be unique instead of being another one of the sheeple.</br>    HOLY FUCKING SHIT. FUCKING SHIT YEAH.

He better rest.</br></br>  <br> Disc commander still banned <br> STRATOS STILL BANNED <br>FUCK THIS EARTH</br></br></br>  <br> Muh Disc commander <br> muh Stratos <br>They are overpowered and you know it.</br></br></br>  <br>Lavalval Chain made too many combo centric plays easy. For example the Djinn lock and the Clownblade engine liked to go into this first turn and dump Djinn or Clown from deck to set up plays. My Melodious deck will miss this card for ease of setting up the grave. On the bright side though, Foolish will now see more use to replace the lost Chain, and it frees up an extra deck slot for the decks that had used it.</br>  <br>Because.</br>  <br> Elemental Hero Stratos <br> Forbidden </br></br>  <br>Once again we are given explicit evidence that Konami gives ZERO SHITS about this game.</br>  Hey what's the best way to search for character deck recipes?

The links listed in  list multiple different decks. Are they geared towards different things or are they all he same base deck as it changes throughout the story of the game?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hokuto taught her.

The decks change through the story. I remember Tag Force 6 was set up as Weak Deck -&gt; Accurate Character Deck -&gt; Strong Deck -&gt; Broken Deck for main characters, but I don't know if Special follows the same way.</br>  <br>Who butt are we talking about here? Yuya's mom yuzu's or  the fat kid's?  </br>  <br>Except they don't.<br> Yet. </br></br>  <br>Their fourth card got leaked on /dng/ yesterday. It was a tuner.</br>  <br>Galeforce? <br>That card was declared fake within seconds and confirmed fake within 3 minutes.</br></br>  <br>I don't even give a shit about the banlist. I only play YGOpro vs AI with shit decks. Couldn't care less about broken meta because it's impossible to fix Yugioh. This is a fun hobby to me only.</br>  Devpro updated for new Banlist<br>Haha time for Trishula</br>  How is Arc V compared to the rest of the series? Thinking of giving this one a shot.  <br><br>It's basically 5D's 2.0<br>Especially starting with episode 64. Arc-V episode 64 is literally 5D's episode 1</br></br></br>  <br>Good.</br>  <br>Better than most of the series, save season 1 5D's and maybe DM if you think highly of DM</br>  <br>Good. Surprisingly less filler and no restriction on summons makes for nice duels.<br>Fun characters.<br>Watch up to episode 7.<br>If not hooked by then, maybe not for you</br></br></br></br>  So /a/rc-v, if you were shitty self-inserts in this show, what would the summoning chant for your ace be?  <br>Good, be prepared for relationship drama/trauma though</br>    <br> not being the odd guy who never chants </br>  <br><br><br>Good, I watched a bit of Zexal and found it dull, mainly the main characters. The ones in Arc V are a much more tolerable from the 6 episodes iv'e watched.</br></br></br>  <br>EVERYBODY GET UP<br>IT'S TIME TO SLAM NOW<br>WE GOT A REAL JAM GOING DOWN<br>WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I see. Does that mean the last decks listed would be the best ones to go with if I want to make a character deck?</br></br>  <br>I want Stratos too, but Disk Commander is never coming back.</br>  <br> 6 episodes <br>Oh boy. You're in for a ride next episode.</br></br>  <br>LIKE I SAID, KIDS ARE CRUEL  JACK.  AND I'M VERY IN TOUCH WITH MY INNER CHILD!</br>  <br>Probably the second deck listed would be best, but Arc-V characters don't have all their cards out yet, so for the Arc-V ones the last one listed would be best.</br>  <br>WARRIOR OF RIGHTEOUSNESS<br>ITS TIME TO RISE TO THE SKIES AND BURN AWAY ALL THAT IS UNHOLY<br>FUUGO SHOKAN<br>ITS TIME FOR JUSTICE<br><br>ELEMENTAL HERO NOVA MASTER</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!<br>I want to tell you a story. Don't worry, it's only short. I went to the barber's yesterday, and he asks me "What kind of dragon you want, fam?", so I told him to just fuck my shit up. And now, it's about to fuck YOUR shit up. ODD-EYES REBELLION DRAGON!</br></br>  <br>for everyone interested, I just posted decks for those signed up for the animu tourney<br>http://challonge.com/tomo10<br>make sure to check it out and look for your deck!<br><br>there's also still a few slots available, and a couple days to sign up and tweak your decks</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ugly as fuck</br>  <br/>  <br>Fuck off Tomo, no one gives a shit.</br>  <br>Fam what has your brother been doing to you and why are you so sad all the time b</br>  <br>mhm.</br>  <br>Not my brother, fam, my mommy. Now that Daddy's running that Academia place, Mommy gets... lonely sometimes.</br>  <br>I see. Should I just wait until the anime finishes in a year or so and then build a deck then? Hopefully most/all of their cards will have been released by then.</br>  <br>no fair, that's MY ace</br>  GX has some pretty cool duels   Trishula  <br>FINALLY</br>  <br>Ahem<br><br>I sacrifice Barrel Dragon and Slifer the Sky Dragon<br><br>Advance Summon<br><br>Dank Magician</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  5D's in a Nutshell <br><br>Top kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Price of Synchro Trish is overhyped though since it is not doing much to the meta for now. Also the unbanning of Synchro Trish means that a reprint of it will happen in the near future since it only came out in HA04 and DT here, probably in the next gold series.</br>  <br>I KNOW RIGHT</br>  <br>I fucking hate chunni's especially the bad ones.</br>  <br>Wait, doesn't the manga manjoume run a Dragon deck whose ace is Light and Darkness Dragon?</br>  <br>More interaction between Tsukikage and Reira when?</br>  <br>I play IgKnight, it's too much of a Glass Cannon and still has slight issues with Qlis and Shaddolls, it especially has issues with TellarKnights. <br><br>If anything gets a large boost thanks to this it's RR.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Dark End and Light End were tribute monsters but they got made into Synchros IRL.</br>  If you look too much into how serious the syncro monarchy is taking dueling it kinda becomes sick. It's borderline roman gladiators shit with how they use them as slaves for their shows and treat them well only if they win. Also acting like dense retards in regards to actual academy threats. Syncro dimensions needs to be cleansed.  <br>With theese two level 4 monsters being treated as level 7, I construct the overlay network!<br>Oh leader of the mythical planes<br>Descend from the sky and let your engines roar<br>Let no sacrifices be in vain<br>XYZ SHOUKAN<br>Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>synch trish<br>summon k?<br>eff trish<br>response?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shoot forth with your burning shots. <br>And drive into hell with burning fury. <br>Witness their glorious sacrifice. <br>IGNAITO BURSTO DRIIIVER<br>PENDULUM SHOKAN<br>IgKnight Avenger<br>PENDULUM YUGO SHOKAN<br>First of the Dragons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is everyone in syncro dimension such annoying faggots? Be it elitist pretentious aristocrats or even the filthy common peasants. And let's not even get started on that king asshole. <br>Also are they seriously going to go in the direction of Yuuya was too selfish and not entertaining enough and that's why he lost the duel AGAIN? Wasn't this shit used like 4 times already? Literally nothing changes in between.</br>  <br> And let's not even get started on that king asshole.  <br>Salty af</br></br>  <br>Because that's how New Domino City was in 5Ds. Also Yuya lost because he's too focused on his own ideals of Entertainment, that's why he is wrong. Synchro does not work the same way Standard does as far as Entertainment goes. Jack was right. <br><br>That and Yuya is gonna get everyone carded because of Entertainment.wav and Yuzu.wav.</br></br></br>  <br> Mammoth <br> Dinosaur <br>Triggered.</br></br></br>  <br>But you can say the same about Jack as well.<br>Who even fucking judges the entertainment values anyway. People fucking see three new summoning methods + bullshit action cards and nobody calls cheats and just act mildly surprised. King doesn't even bat an eyelid at all.<br><br>And yes, Yuuya's constant talk about entertainment is really fucking annoying because he seems to always go back to square one which is muh Yuzu and never learn anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jack determines the entertainment because he's the King of Games, simple as that. That's why people were horrified that it looked like he was going to lose. Nobody gives two shits about anything but Jack and D-Wheels.</br>  <br> Also Yuya lost because he's too focused on his own ideals of Entertainment, that's why he is wrong <br><br>but he lost because Jack beat him? what the fuck does entertainment have to do with it</br></br></br>  Hey, give me some good dueling music for DN!  <br>Duel of Rebellion / Yuto's Passionate Soul<br>Wavering Feelings<br>The Evolving Falcon</br></br></br>  <br>fuck op spoiler that shit, im getting goosebumps looking at his face</br>  <br>He did not entertain the audience in any way, he just said "MY ENTERTAINMENT DUELING WILL WIN!" and then proceeded to get his ass ripped apart by Jack and did not hype the audience up in any way.</br>    <br> He did not entertain the audience in any way <br>They got really hype for his fusion combo wombo</br></br>  It has been one month since the last time anyone called Yuto 'Edgeplant'  <br>This. It was reflected perfectly when Yuya first came to Synchro dimension. When he tried to use his entertainment duel, none of them actually entertained, even Reira think that was pretty cringey.<br><br> Personally though, Yusei's duel really entertaining for me. </br></br></br>  <br>They was more hype at a new summoning method than it was Yuya or his specialized dueling. Hell Sawatari could have fucking fusion summoned and they'd have been hype.</br>  <br>OH GREAT DRAGON OF A TWISTED DIMENSION<br>I PAY NO HEED TO YOU BEING ACTUALLY A PARROT<br>BREAK FREE FROM YOUR LOONEY CHAINS<br>ACCEPT THE SACRIFICE I OFFER FOR YOUR GAINS!<br><br>ADVANCED SUMMON<br><br>PARROT DRAGON!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> entire dimension using the most retarded way imaginable to duel <br><br>No wonder they have shit taste</br></br></br>  Here is something to fill if you're bored.  <br>Why the fuck did i read this in Dota2's Warlock voice?</br>  <br>Going back to the archives is really fun</br>  <br>Shame, it was such a great nickname, all the subsequent attempts at fruit nicknaming didnt even come close</br>  <br>Nice draw, close but not enough<br>See, i believe in the heart of the cards, draw!</br></br>  <br>Well, Purple Kotori and Egaoman is funnier</br>  <br>People forget Jack was an antagonist for the entire fortune cup arc of 5D's. Dude is straight up a selfish asshole with an entitlement complex. He only gets better because Yusei rekts the shit out of him in front of the crowd and hey what do you know, no one gives a shit about Jack Atlas anymore because he lost once. Outside of a few die hards like Carly and that one kid, the general public moved on to the new King Yusei who proved that even Satellite scum can duel like the people of New Domino City (although his real intention was just to get Stardust, he didn't give shit about rich snobville until Dark Signers showed up.)</br>  <br>Tomato and Citrus have stayed pretty consistent.</br>  <br>Wave the Flag of Rebellion and Reiji's Theme are good too.</br>  <br>starting with mine</br>  <br>I don't think it's the same Jack though. It's an alternative universe or some shit. But still, the way he acts indicates he's still the most selfish asshole there is and he has the balls to somehow talk about someone else being selfish. Hell the whole point of the exhibition duel is to show off so everyone can jerk off to his majesty.</br>  <br>this seems like more of a dng thing.</br>  Vector is so based jesus christ    <br> Tomato <br> Citrust <br> Banana Hammock <br> Dragon Fruit/Plum  <br> Crude and Strong <br><br>All the fruits and ruris still have their names, Serena and Yuri a little less so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah I never got that last comment to Yuya about self-satisfaction. He's the most self-centered person of all 5D's and probably all of the Synchro Dimension. This Jack not being the one from 5D's can only mean he'll stay being a dickbag unless Yuya fills in for Yusei and gives him development.</br>  <br>there's a way better template than this out there<br><br>I used to have it but I can't find it anywhere</br></br></br>  <br>I tried going really far back once, to the very first threads after Arc-V was announced, and this one anon called Synchro dimension really damn early.</br>  I don't see why people think there are only 4 dimensions.<br> Arc-V <br> V=5 <br> FIVE </br></br></br>   tfw Kingu retained dickishness and bashed on Yuya's entermate dueling <br><br>Kingu still got it FUCK YEAH!</br></br>  <br>The 5th dimension will be the result of fusing the 4 dimensions.</br>  <br> Yugioh 5Ds <br> 5=5 <br> There were 6 dragon </br></br></br>  <br>It's the Pendulum dimension son.</br>  <br> inb4 the fifth element comes to be by fusing a summoning methods </br>  <br>Sinister eye that sees all.

I don't really pay much attention to YGO anymore, kinda getting back into it now b/c of the movie, but I have the original JUMP version of the card back when it was still forbidden.</br>  <br><br>It's as crushing as when I was excited as fuck for Temple of Kings to come back only to learn that it was errata'd. <br>Why not errata every single forbidden card ever?<br> Graceful Charity banishes <br> Pot of Greed can only be activated if you have less than three cards in your hand <br> Yata Garasu needs to destroy a monster to trigger its eff <br><br>what else?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trishula is bullshit. Brionac just needs a once per turn errata or something for it to not be complete bs.</br>  <br>yeah, they errata'd all those old really busted cards. that's why temple of the kings is at 3 now too.<br><br>chaos emperor dragon got an errata too, and it's probably coming back as well.</br></br></br>  <br>last will forbids other special summons the turn you use it<br>magical scientist is hard OPT and negates the effect of the monster summoned.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't see how Synchro Trish is any more bullshit than Nekroz Trish</br></br>  <br>I was just viewing Sync Trish as a card by itself. Mist Wurm was good enough. Banish from three areas of play was too much power for a generic. But Konami is konami so it really doens't matter what the fuck I think to them.</br>  <br>synchro trish can't be stopped by not having a hand, field, or grave.</br>  <br>Nekroz Trish needs a target in each zone to activate his effect, and if one is stopped from being banished none are banished. Regular Trish ignores all that and can be used in more than one or two decks.</br>  <br>To add on to this, It was extremely OP with Glow Up Bulb and also in Infernity decks.</br>  <br>It's the magic number of 2 level 4s + avenger.<br>Mist Wurm is not a bad card , but it is just not the same</br></br>  <br> just not the same <br>This is the problem with YGO players today: they are not satisfied unless it's broken. Broken meta overall results in people only wanting OP shit. So Konami keeps print more and more brokeness to amass the masses and balance gets tossed out the window for LOL I OTK YOU SCRUBLORD :^)))))))))</br></br>  <br> Pot of Greed can only be activated if you have less than three cards in your hand <br>But that'd still be broken<br> Go first <br> Set 3, or set 2 and summon a monster <br> Draw 2 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Regular Trish ignores all that and can be used in more than one or two decks <br>All of those decks suck dick.
