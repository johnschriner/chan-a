I can't seem to be able to find it.</br>  20 days to WonFes. Prepare yourselves for swords and boats everywhere. <br><br>What's something you're hoping for, anon? I'd like to see Alter scales of the three unannounced YYY girls.</br></br>  <br>A Karen or Yotsugi scale.</br>  <br>It was posted in the last thread.</br>  When  <br>Thanks, I had it open before it archived so I'll take a look.</br>  So, I haven't used Manda since RSAL stopped working in some countries. Heard they don't undervalue anymore, or something like that? What's up with that?  Pre-ordered this, did I do good?  <br>G-reco character artbook.</br>  <br>Imagine this<br><br> two figures <br> base sold separately <br> 40k </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They still do but not by default, jsut ask them when you place the order.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>No, are you hyped for something?</br>  <br>nami mugiwara V2 it was at 7.8k now it's at 12.5k</br>  <br><br>Thanks for noticing me senpai.<br><br>Actually, I'm hoping since most people think this thing is over $200 (which it really isn't) I can get a good after market price on it. If I intend selling it that is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd buy it.</br>  <br> paying for Play Arts Kai </br>  I want a dollfie so bad.  <br>the face on this is atrocious</br>  <br><br>When I first saw that, I thought they were rereleasing the Dragoon PAK.</br></br>  <br>I don't think you'll be able to sell it for that much, at least in the short term.</br>  <br> PAK <br><br>Jesus no</br></br></br>  <br>Did Miku decapitate the orange one?</br>  なかなかやるわね  <br>Thanks also that is a bit overpriced for her.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>What's wrong with PAK?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're not familiar with one piece then yes, then again that's one of best nami figures out there.<br><br><br>yes, it's too much for a figure that simple(and small), there's a new bikini nami for PO at 7.8K (in case you like the character), it's probably going to be around 10 in the aftermarket.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some Sympho same as every wonfes, and some Gatchaman Crowds would be nice.</br>  <br>They're just poop, simple as that.</br>  <br>I don't know</br>  <br>Those are all old as fuck. Recent (armored) PAKs have been pretty decent.</br>  <br>Little musical animals.</br>  <br>I have a long list of swords I'd like to have. Most of them are quite popular, so at least some of them will surely get their scales.</br>  <br>Some are ok, others at just terrible, speacilly the older ones, I liked WW and SG.<br><br><br>yeah people keep posting that shit over and over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Where is this?</br>  <br>Everywhere, that's her price sealed, check manda or amiami.</br>  <br>In before Blue Bunny Chris</br>  <br>Any futanari scale that is not a GK.</br>  <br>This guy</br>  <br>Commit suicide.</br>  <br>Ýour figure is nice but, could you just not spam her in every thread?</br>  <br><br><br>I thought the Catwoman looked pretty decent. I could be wrong. oh well.<br><br><br>Do they actually sing/dance as animals or are they just people with animal ears and tails</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's an ass, Anon.</br>  <br>I am sort of thinking about getting the original but there is just something about it that i am not a fan off, fuck why couldn't they have just picked one of her costumes from the show.</br>  <br>How much did all that set you back?</br>  <br>That's not my fig though</br>  <br>They're Sanrio animals during concerts and fights, outside of that 2D kemonomimi.</br>  <br>Lurk more.<br>It's not his collection.</br></br>  <br>You still can order this Nami</br>  <br>Now with Orange Rouge I wouldn't mind seeing some  shirtless  male figs.</br>    <br>You know what he means, faglord. Stop spamming the same figure over and over, we've seen it a hundred times already.</br>  <br>Soon Anon, soon...</br>  <br>Good job with the mirrors but you missed one at the bottom.</br>  <br>I said that to him, but there is no need to be rude.</br>  <br><br>Me and the Devil Blues v5 just came out.</br></br>  <br>Maybe he likes that one</br>  <br>Pochaco might be more to your taste.</br>  <br> Tripfag acting like a faggot. <br>What a surprise.</br></br>  <br>Couldn't be more wrong.</br>  <br>the beer maid one is cute, the others look bad.</br>  <br>The bunny maid one is the only acceptable one.<br>Decent face.</br></br>  <br>Jesus anon, that gave me a mighty good chuckle<br><br> Post more </br></br></br>  <br>Not soon enough</br>  <br>I'm being rude because people have asked him to stop in the past and he is still doing it.</br>  <br>I want to see Mio already.</br>  <br>I wonder how Ritsu's figure will end up looking if she has to come with her drums.</br>  <br><br><br>A SHIT</br></br></br>  <br>Is anyone here getting here?</br>  <br>And you haven't learned anything out of it? I you ignore it it will stop, keep feeding him and he will continue.</br>  <br>Why does Pochaco always have her mouth open?<br> Is she always ready for the phallus? </br></br>  <br>Komeji pls go</br>  <br>cute base.</br>  <br>I'll fight you</br>  <br>OR said something about bringing the delight of female breasts on figures to male ones, didn't they?</br>  <br>I imagine she'll just have her sticks or maybe one drum instead of a whole kit, Mugi has a keytar instead of her Korg</br>  <br>She's always  hungry </br>  <br> For what? </br>  <br> 10 Chicken Buckets </br>   Finally confessed <br><br>And it only took them 39 episodes and two years.</br></br>  <br> 798x472 </br>  On ya, Ei-chan.  <br>Well, the name of the show was a hint</br>  I was a bit worried how they would handle this, considering the quality in the earlier parts of the episode, but they delivered when it mattered.  <br>I knew something was up when the lipstick magically appeared on Natsu.</br>  <br>Read porn already.</br>  This is one of the few good shows airing and literally nobody watches it. Of course.  <br> literally nobody <br>Factually wrong.</br></br>   Can't even act like a proper couple after confessing. <br>This is pretty awkward. <br><br><br>Just because no one discusses it doesn't mean anyone is watching it.<br><br>What can you discuss for this show? Ei chan taking notes or losing a game but gradually becoming better from experience?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITS FUCKING CALLED BABY STEPS WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?!  <br>Are you saying we count as somebodies?</br>  <br>You don't, but most other people in this thread do.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>is this better than kuroko?</br>  <br>Does Kuroko have  the despair of not even getting to the finals in the All-Japan Junior causing you to question your decision on how you are going to continue your life ?</br>  If I've liked Haikyuu, YowaPeda and Hajime no Ippo, will I enjoy this?  <br>watch it and find out<br><br>though the last time I enjoyed any sports anime was when Haikyuu finished and The last time I read a good sports manga was when I read kurogane</br></br></br>   you're waifu will never confess to you while wanting to show you something cool <br><br>Why live?</br></br>  <br>You can lose yourself in her eyes.</br>  <br> Why live? <br>Because usually the confession is the end of the story.<br>So you live *until* your waifu confesses to you. If it doesn't happen, in theory, you cannot die.</br></br></br>  39 episodes is actually pretty quick for a shounen sports anime. Usually the love interest just kind of disappears for awhile. Like how it took Major something like 120 episodes for Goro and Shimizu to fuck.  How many episodes till they hold hands?  <br>39 episodes is practically light speed.</br>  I felt warm and fuzzy watching this.   you will never work hard at becoming good at something with a qt to help support your dreams   <br>Maybe if you had a real hobby that required skill and hard work she would.</br>  <br>Surprising a confession that doesn't end with they both stuttering like retards.</br>  <br> Can't even act like a proper couple after confessing. <br>What did you expect?</br></br>   settling down before you get a chance to abuse your tennis fame to bang qts all over the world <br><br>lol what a nerd</br></br>  <br> worrying about bitches instead of settling down so you can concentrate on what you love to do <br>Do you even have a dream?</br></br>  <br>Plenty of professional sportsmen successfully balance being GOAT and fucking vaginas worldwide</br>  <br> GOAT <br>Usually the actually best ones and not just the ones that you like also work all day every day on their skills.</br></br>  <br>Well yeah, but they also bang models</br>  <br>FUCKING WHY ANON</br>  <br>Soon I guess.  Fuck you, don't even spoil that. </br>   Baby Steps thread with more than 10 replies <br><br>What kind of bizarre world am I living in?<br><br>Fuck this show is fun to watch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Romance happened. /a/ is full of little girls so sports don't interest them, but romance does.</br>  <br> not watching Baby Steps </br>  <br>Not enough colour wars for waifufags. No over the top scenes worth shitposting. Very little to discuss.<br><br>This series threads are dead before being born.</br></br></br>  testing  <br>It sucks but there's really not much to discuss when it comes to sports anime.</br>  <br>It's translated that far? I could have sworn they were like, 50 chapters behind last I checked.</br>  <br>50? Try over 100. But yeah, that part just got scanlated a while back. The raws are at 350 now.</br>  How beta, having the girl confess first. NTR setting launched?  <br>Was hoping Aki would give Natchan some competition when it comes to Maruo.</br>  what chapter is the translated version on? i tried looking for the most recent ones but saw some shit on the raws i didnt want to see  <br>Why?</br>  i was really worried about this episode. some of the animation in the begin was kinda mehh  <br>You're watching the wrong show if that's the sort of development you're looking for.</br>  <br><br>glasses girl was cucked</br></br>  <br>translations are at 246</br>  Despite Natsu's role of token cute heroine that is common in every shounen manga, I'm starting to really like her as a character. She's not useless, she can hold a conversation and has a definite personality and play style. Now all she needs is some arc not involving Eiichiro.  <br>just think, if eichan never picked up tennis, him and shimizu would have been having endless awkward moments about school or some shit<br>natsu is superior in everyway</br></br>  I don't care all that much about their relationship to be honest - there could be no love interest at all and it wouldn't bother me the slightest. Also, it's one of the *very few* shows I'll watch this year (the other two being Hibike! Euphonium and Yowamushi Pedal, which I might drop because it's getting a little too weird for my taste in Grande Road).  <br> Now all she needs is some arc not involving Eiichiro. <br>That's not gonna happen. The Bechdel test is nonsense anyways, not something to strive for.</br></br>  <br>The show already passes the Bechdel test with flying colors though? The girls spend way more time talking to each other about tennis than they do about boys.</br>  <br>anon this is why manga is superior medium.You actually wasted your life</br>  <br>Yeah, and the translated material has barely even started in on the really good stuff, like the  second US tennis camp .</br>  <br>I'm not him but I gotta say, while that's usually true, watching sports in the form of still pictures is kinda dull for me.</br>  <br>Don't know about entire arcs, but there are a few chapters that don't involve Eiichiro.</br>  <br>Nat-chan's VA makes it all worth it.</br>    <br>Thats because the show has terrible visuals so most simply picked up the manga.</br>  <br><br>i really need to stop looking at these goddamn spoiler texts</br></br>  This show would amazing with a higher budget. But its pretty good otherwise. Blame Nishikori for losing the US open final.  <br>So you came here to tell us that you are a huge normalfag that barely watches anime and finds it weird 99% of the time?</br>  <br>Well, Nishikori even breaking into the top 5 is probably why we have two seasons to begin with.</br>  I just want a girl like Natsu<br>This is my first anime ever, I can totally relate to those guys with the waifu body pillows</br>  <br> This is my first anime ever <br>How did you end here so early?</br></br>  <br>He's a new moderator, so he's obligated to lurk every board for at least a week to get a feel for 4chan.</br>  <br>This is not the future I asked for.</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Not really underrated. He wasn't even the first guy in the thread to bring it up.</br>  Why does a sport anime has better romance than most shows entirely devoted to this genre?  <br>Because it is not romance related melodrama every two seconds.</br>  <br>because you don't like romance manga.While a fan of the genre expects all those melodramatic moments and enjoys them.</br>  <br>Wrong. Only a brainless retard enjoys poorly written shit. You can have a romance story without it being a complete trash.</br>  <br>He didn't say anything about poor writing though.</br>  <br>Melodrama is exactly that.</br>  <br>Don't be stupid on purpose.</br>  <br>Again just because you don't enjoy melodrama doesn't make it bad writing.</br>  <br><br> something used as an insult for stories by almost everyone is not bad </br></br>  <br>its used as a descriptor not an insult. You are equating it to an insult for some reason. Maybe your just being overly dramatic for attention.</br>   every new anime has a thread <br> but this one <br>Why?</br></br>   It's time.   So what homo shows have we got this season?  To watch or not to watch?  I'm kind of sad the entire manga isn't about them as children. Here comes the inevitable love triangle shit.  <br>Just finished the episode. It was shit.</br>  <br>It's shit, Aldnoah 2.0 in terms of trainwreck</br>  This has potential  <br> That's a girl <br><br>Why.</br></br></br>  Why is he so damn adorable? I can't really place it.  <br>As far homo is concerned, Ranpo seems much better.</br>  I hope there will be some shota homo of them.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127582773 <br>Google the fucking name of the character.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127580771 <br><br><br>Movie is out looks like.</br></br></br>    <br>Turns out there are a bunch of Itami a cute out there.</br>  <br>I am watching for the boys  and Morikubo having a lead role for once </br>  <br>And 90% of it is shoujo or supergay</br>  <br>It's called Nippon Stronk</br>  <br>Not spoonfeeding you, try again.</br>  <br>It's because he looks like a retard.</br>  <br>It's a shame the MC's not a guy, but I'm looking forward to more of this qt.</br>  <br>Feels like Captain Earth all over again. It's shit.</br>  <br>The animation is not all that great, but I'll probably keep watching for him.</br>  Did anyone manage to get the drama CD of this?<br>I was hoping to hear more about it.</br>  <br>That first episode was painful to watch.</br>  <br>Is this from the ED? Also what is he saying?</br>  <br>Maybe this? I don't know shit about sign language.</br>  <br>He looks autistic.</br>  <br>I hope he is. I love autists.</br>  <br>Yeah, it came out Friday. Spoke to someone who saw it, they said no new footage, just edited anime eps. Didn't sound very impressed.</br>  <br>Looks like it</br>  <br><br>Even if you did speak American sign language, the Japanese one is entirely different.</br></br>  <br>But isn't the setting america? Though I guess they wouldn't do this much research.</br>  <br>No, it's a fictional city in a fictional country</br>  So, how do you like this season so far?  <br>I am just gonna pretend she's a boy just like some people pretend some traps are girls.</br>  Any of you homos got this shit yet?  <br>I hope this doujin has a lot of<br> As expected of country grown vegetables! </br></br>  <br>Pretty shitty so far</br>  <br>I hope it has its own meme.</br>  <br>I want Ishiki to be the fucked one.</br>  <br>Reverse traps aren't supposed to be blonde. They fucked up.</br>  <br>Fuck yes! I asked for this webm in the thread.<br>Thanks anon.<br><br>It was subtitled anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a below average season, only Working!!! and Durarara x2 ten are good.<br>Looks like the originals and new adaptations are almost all shit, only sequels to look forward too</br></br>  <br> Durarara <br> good </br></br>  <br>I'm feeling very positive. Both Laplace and Aoharu x Kikanjuu seem to rather homo. Also there are some great boys in Charlotte, Gangsta and Classroom Crisis. Also, there's always Gintama.</br>  <br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br> homo <br>It's literally a reverse haremshit/love triangle with two boys one girl.<br><br> classroom crisis <br>It's shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ushio to Tora and Rokka no Yuusha had a good first episodes, the latter might be from a LN but at least it's not harem, the setting is interesting and MC looks good. Working wasn't as funny as I remembered.</br>   YOU WANT AMON?! TOO BAD! HERE FAGYAMA! FUCK U! <br>Fuck you too Ishida.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127591441 <br> fanfics <br>Anon pls</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127591441 <br>God's work. Nice to see nips putting together an anthology too, love is alive if cultish.</br>  <br>None of those have any good boys.</br>  <br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>Literally Ouran Highschool Host Club.</br></br>  <br>Aoharu was okay, Rokka was great and I still have Akagami to look forward to. That's already better than previous season.<br><br>Still need to catch up on Gatchaman before I can watch season 2.</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't like deaf moe </br>  <br> It's literally a reverse haremshit/love triangle with two boys one girl. <br>Except it's not. We're 29 chapters in and they still don't know that she's a fucking girl. There's more fujo pandering in the manga than het pandering.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127591441 <br> fanfics <br>please leave.<br>There are other sites that specialize with that.</br></br></br>  <br>This is probably going to be my manga backlog season, I'm not really interested in any shows airing besides Rampo and Ushio to Tora.<br><br>Would anyone happen to know if any chapters were ripped from the Asumiko Nakamura anthology DMG published digitally? There's a chapter with Leo from Coponius no Kokyuu in it.</br></br></br>  <br>But Ouran was good with humor, boys were nice and pander to fujos there and here.</br>  <br> Gintama <br>I'll fight ya</br></br>  <br>Sure. All boys are shit.</br>    <br>Confirmed for not even watching, therefore opinion discarded.<br>Just wondering, but what boys do you consider good?</br></br>  <br> liking gintama boys <br>You can't have shittier tastes, fujoshit.</br></br>  Personally I thought the highlight of Aoharu x Kikanjuu was not the cute boy vibes (which were nice enough) but the over the top gun battle. I lost my shit when he was walking towards her dodging the bullets.  <br>The one-shot was better.</br>  <br>Not a great season for homo, I'll probably only watch the 8 minutes shorts, Monster Girls and Charlotte.<br><br>I want to like Gangsta, but I really don't trust Manglobe all that much.</br></br></br>  I want to abuse Green.  <br>Why don't? <br>They delivered with SamFlam.<br> Fuck Kurata. </br></br></br>  <br>Never watched SamFlam. <br><br> Probably a good thing, I guess.  </br></br></br>  <br>I want to  hold his hand. </br>  <br>Nope. You missed out on all the fun.</br>  <br>  the fun <br><br>SamFlam was ony good for the homo, it was all over the place in quality for everything else.</br></br></br>    <br>Not really the sale when they're doing an adaptation than when they're doing an original show though</br>  <br>*the same I meant<br>Also, while I loved SamFlam to bits it did have troubles un the visual department</br></br>  <br>Quality was the only issue with SamFlam and they fixed it in BDs. The characters were likable, the ride was crazy and the toku references were good. It was a good watch with /a/ since it was original and no one could  predict and  spoil the plot.</br>  <br>Watching it week by week was so fun.<br>That said, I dropped it when it went full power rangers for the couple of episodes it lasted.</br></br>  <br> The characters were likable, <br><br>I, for one, couldn't stand the idols girls, they were insufferable everytime they appeared on screen.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that arc was the weakest but Goto's arc afterwards and then yandere shota arc was worth it.</br>  <br>Mari a shit, but the other two were alright.</br>  <br>I can understand Mari, but Moe was an angel and Mizuki was pretty cool but<br> discussing girls in a homo thread </br></br>  <br>At least it's not fags getting mad at otome games again.</br>  <br>Watched only Charlotte so far and I kind of liked it, will watch Kikanjuu now. <br><br>Working is the same as ever, funny and a nice way to spend 20 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br>I missed those too. <br>Too bad they are paired.</br></br>  <br>Soma is top you can't tell me otherwise. (still need this though)</br>  Not a huge fan of gradient hair, but he is pretty cute.  <br>Working is the best thing I've watched this season.<br>Still great, but damn the season is awful.</br></br>  <br>Gradient hair is ok in general, what's shit is long hair.</br>  <br>Yeh. I rarely mind a redhead MC.</br>  <br>But the only homo was a slutty straight girl kissing her lesbian friend.</br>  Why can't I ever find any translations anymore besides Free! shit where the guys have spider legs and long fingers? Did the hentai world move to a new site?  <br>Learn japanese, doujins are so basic to read too.</br>  <br> Needing translations for porn </br>  <br>Best captain soon.<br> so good he pops up in flashbacks in a critical game to inspire a different team to get past their fucking boring opponents </br></br>  <br>I want to pet him.</br>  <br>I usually think that long hair is shit, but I think it actually looks sort of good on the Rokka mc.</br>  <br>How is it plot wise?</br>  <br>It's generic, but the good kind of generic so far. There's no annoying LN archetype yet and the characters are likeable enough.</br>    <br> brown Akaashi </br>  <br> love is alive if cultish. <br>I'll take what I can get</br></br>  <br>Charlotte MC is kind of an endearing prick. and the rest of the show seems interesting enough. If only his little sister wasn't so damned annoying. It was like she sucked the fun out of the entire second half of the episode.</br>  New Tomcat doujin out. http://exhentai.org/g/829655/3e0e4b<wbr>b8f8/ <br> that cliffhanger ending </br></wbr>  <br>Hope the guy at the end gets fucked.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127599861 <br> balls touching <br> not gay <br>newfag pls</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127599861 <br>What's the source of that, anyway?

Why couldn't he have been in a better show, homos?<br><br>Also use this opportunity to post good boys stuck in shit shows if you want to.</br></br>  <br>Green and Kuroko. Maybe even Red Edgelord because he might be cute as kid.<br><br>Yellow would be a whiny bitch like always, Purple would cry all the time when he gets no food and Blue is  shit. </br></br></br>  <br> No Kensho this season </br>  <br> good boys stuck in shit shows <br>There are so many to choose from.</br></br>  <br>i would let this baby sit on me if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>I hope his character in Daiya no Ace appears again. I really like his laugh.</br>  <br>I wish Kensho would do R18 CDs but I guess it would be asking for the impossible.</br>  <br>ZR.</br>  <br>Don't sexualize Aomine.</br>  <br>The writing drops the ball in a lot of places, but I'm in it for the shota suffering flashbacks.</br>  <br>shotas are meant for  teasing  and  raising them to be good citizens <br>molesting them only turns them into edgelords and freaks</br></br>  <br>There's nothing I love more than the bratty little shota you want to take home and  properly raise into a loving son .</br>  <br>that's what he's made for.</br>  <br>The way he passed the breakfast challenge was unexpectedly arousing. His deep breathing was lewd.</br>  <br><br>This is true  doesn't stop me from doing it though. </br></br>  <br>It seems Akechi had a childhood friend too.<br><br><br>Is this Eden? I don't remember this part.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is this Eden? I don't remember this part. <br>Yeah. If I remember correctly, next scene is  nii-san telling him he should have gotten money for it. </br></br>  <br> 6 named, non-greyed-out characters <br> 2 Ranpo original characters <br> 2 detectives <br> Sensei is also Akechi or some shit <br>Childhood friend is the murderer?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that's what he's made for. <br>No.<br>He's made for cuddling, loving and  bullying. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Yukine is love.<br>Yukine is life.</br></br></br>  <br>None, they are all ugly and shit.</br>  <br>agreed with the spoiler</br>  Would you a priest?  <br>I'd a priest in the confessional booth.</br>  <br>"You're husbando a shit"</br>  <br>It's not quite as good, but it was enjoyable and the first episode had a pretty similar structure to Ouran's first ep, not to mention covering some of the same plot points</br>   semen demon stuck in a shit show <br><br>Every time</br></br>  <br>Who is he supposed to be?</br>  <br>Shoulder length best length.</br>  <br>I watched that to see what the teacher guy was like. It got progressively dumber and dumber. I may 3-episode-rule it for the designs though because it seems like it changes direction next week.</br>  <br>Looks like Shingakkou's.</br>  <br> shit show <br>I guess I'm just not getting how it's shit. It didn't wow me, but it wasn't as godawful as people are making it out to be. It just seemed average to me.</br></br>   Finally start to marathon Grande Road. <br> This guy. <br><br>I've never thought a character in this series could get any more creepy.</br></br></br>  <br>Just wait until you see what chicken tendies can do with his hands.</br>  <br>Why have slutty babbies when you can have the babysitter.</br>  <br>I assume people are angry and impatient because it doesn't tell everything right away, unlike genuine shit like Rokka no Yuusha that had godawful exposition in first episode. Not even the male character designs can keep me watching that. I really liked Classroom Crisis, Nagasaki's direction kind of gave me Build Fighters vibes again especially with Hayashi Yuuki's OST and another smug shota.</br>  <br> Godawful exposition <br>seriously? I actually thought Rokka no Yuusha had a great first episode. Just enough to get the background of whats going on and tease the real meat of the story.</br></br>  <br> everyone knows this story <br> we both know this story <br> and now I'm going to tell it to you anyway <br>That is the worst way to give exposition, having two people who already know something tell about it to each other. It happens often so you might not notice it but when you think about it's really dumb and lazy. Not to mention overload of exposition in the first episode is bad idea anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, only because cassocks are my fetish.</br>  <br>Oh come on, exposition in the first episode only means it's out of the way for the rest of the show, especially when it's basic stuff that fits in one or two scenes. Dropping a show early is warranted when there are terrible elements that can be reasonably expected to stick throughout the show.</br>  <br>Is that Hori?</br>  <br>It's Touken Ranbu's Hasebe</br>  <br>Very nice.</br>  <br>Did you miss the fact that his limbs seems to be melting off his body?</br>  <br>Sazaki was so great. Why build fighters, why did you have shove that asshole reiji down our throats instead of having sazaki goodness?</br>  <br> Likes boring uninteresting shit like Gundam BF and CC <br>Sasuga shit taste, it's no wonder you didn't like Rokka.</br></br>  <br> Those oreimo faces </br>  <br>Kagami a best</br>  <br>Some boys are just born to get bullied and NTR'd</br>  Sunrise delivers.  <br>Does his shota self do this?</br>  <br>Looks like genderflipped Kyoko and Sayaka</br>  <br>Yes</br>  Is it just me or we are not getting many homo spread anymore?<br><br>What happened to Otomedia and Pash?<br><br><br><br><br>Those design are fucking delicious, waht a waste</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't unsee Oreimo.</br>  <br>Oreimo is very hot, it's just stuck in a shity LN.</br>  <br> spider legs and long fingers <br>In bizarro world maybe.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't the last pash with ShingancrimsonZ?</br>  <br>Didn't you fap to doujins from there?<br>I don't ship the characters but their design were pleasant.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty alright.</br>  <br>There is a god when a shitty harem like Oreimo spawned several high quality homo doujins.</br>  <br>I'd a priest with rosary beads.</br>  <br>If he has tired eyes and white pantsu.</br>   Rui's hand   <br>They have hands like Frees bodies.</br>  <br>Why is Wallace so much better than Worick? He should have stayed an angry young master forever.</br>  <br>Did he put his hand too far up his ass?</br>  <br>But those hands don't look great like the Frees' bodies.</br>  <br>I'd be more worried about the ugly art style.</br>  <br>Naw, I'm definitely more worried about their mutilated appendages.</br>     Best guy gives the MC the death flag look. <br><br> It was nice knowing you, best guy. </br></br>  <br>Daryun rape</br>  <br>Oh shit, I forgot this was updated, thanks for reminding<br> Best boy died in ch.34 though </br></br>  <br>But wasn't it  a false death flag ?</br>  <br> ch.34 <br>Well, you're not wrong.<br><br><br>I believed it until that happened.</br></br></br></br></br>  When you think about it, Sajou Ayaka is kinda qt.    Bump.  <br>Her personality reminds me of a mix of Rin and Sakura.</br>  I'm still irked about her blonde hair in Strange fake. It doesn't go with her uniform.  So yeah, it's been nearly 20 years and Toriyama still hasn't learned a fucking thing about pacing. Who starts a series like this?  <br>shut up and enjoy it.</br>  Did you seriously expect some fighting in the first episode  How is this bad pacing? It starts off completely slow and character establishing.<br><br>Bad pacing would be like starting immediately in the middle of a huge brawl</br></br>  <br>Just like he started db, dbz and dbz buu?<br>Wow, what a surprise. And sure it must be a abd way right? Fuck off underage faggot</br></br>  <br>Do you seriously think Toriyama is involved in the writing or directing?</br>  <br> Babies believing Toriyama is actually involved <br>top kek</br></br>   Next episode: Vegeta´s exciting family trip. <br>yay</br>  speaking of dbz, does anyone has a link to the revival of freeze in vosta ? can't get my hands on it : /<br>fucking DMCA</br>  <br>More like it's been nearly 20 years and Toriyama doesnt want to let this shit die</br>  <br>More like it's been nearly 20 years and the Yakuzas that own jump doesnt want to let this shit die.</br>  I hope they start doing dubs soon<br><br>Can't stand granny goku</br></br>  <br>go listen to some bruce faulconer you big wank</br>  <br> seriously think Toriyama is involved in the writing or directing <br><br>Isn't this why this new DB project got the greenlight? BoG had Toriyama involvement and was a sign that the series could work?</br></br></br>  <br>He is.<br>He returned to the franchise that's why it's been resurrected in the first place.</br></br>  <br> Toriyama <br> not knowing how to pace <br>Shut the fuck up and read the original manga, pleb. Toriyama's one of the last classic mangakas who knew how to properly pace stuff.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oK2<wbr>SE7LKmS4</wbr>  [ ]<br>Did this track ever play in the Boo Saga Kai?</br>  <br>Let's hope it will have more of the comedic tone of DB/BoF and less of the angst on DBZ</br>  broly should have shown up in the first episode so i could see everyone's reaction  <br>So like Boo Saga then?<br>Honestly I'd rather have it be less serious than Freeza/Cell Sagas but more serious than Boo. <br>AND LESS FUCKING GOTEN AND TRUNKS</br></br></br>  It was Dragon Ball, exactly what people wanted and got. It boggles my fucking mind they're going to make a retelling of the movies first, tho.  Yeah how fucking stupid starting with light-hearted antics to introduce the main characters whilst simultaneously foreshadowing the arrival of the first villain.  I'm really fucking excited. I can't help but love Dragonball. I want to wait and see the whole season at once though, I don't like waiting a week at a time. I'll keep myself busy with other things until it's done. <br><br>I do actually like the English VA though but I don't think I can wait THAT long. Subs should be fine.</br></br>  <br>Disagreed. More Goten and Trunks. Would like to see them older though. More Gohan as well. I like Goku but we need someone else to do something for once. Vegeta would be acceptable.</br>  <br> super saiyan god super saiyan </br>  <br>This. Man, how impatient are some of you?</br>  <br>I didn't say I don't want more Gohan, Piccolo, Tenshinhan, Krillin, Vegeta and  Yamcha .<br>I said I don't want Goten and Trunks since they were the worst fucking thing in Boo Saga. They're obnoxious little shits that are completely unlikeable. Goku and Gohan were such pieces of shit.</br></br>  only thing i want out of this series is sss bra (super saiyan slut)<br><br>toei pls</br></br>  why does videl have to have such shit hair and no personality now.. she's just "nice girl" now<br>all the tomboy of her was fucked out of her</br>  <br><br>It IS suppose to start up like this.<br><br>Now shut up and enjoy it, DBZOnly scum.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DBZ started out lighthearted too.<br>First episode was Gohan getting lost in a forest and then falling into the river with Goku saving him (just like he saves Goten here).</br></br>  <br>He is involved.<br><br>He wrote the whole fucking outline of the story along with the character designs.</br></br></br>  <br> AND LESS FUCKING GOTEN AND TRUNKS <br>I don't agree with this part. Goten and Trunks shenanigans are pretty awesome with the right writing behind them as partly seen in BoF - get people to invest in their friendship to almost the same level like they do with  Gon and Killua (pre-ant arc) . You're on the mark with the Freeza/Cell thing though. But I'd have to say, the Cell saga was pretty good in terms of having an interesting plot before it returned to the conventional fighting.</br></br>  <br>This is a classic example of "OP IS FAGGOT"<br><br>Read and learn, newfags.</br></br></br>  <br> AND LESS FUCKING GOTEN AND TRUNKS <br>No, they served as nothing more than to introduce Fusion in Z. Here we actually get to see them interact and be friends and shit.<br><br>I'm not saying they should take over the show, but they should at least be the characters they are</br></br></br></br>  <br>How should Goten be written as an adult? I can't really think of any good ideas to distinguish him from Gohan without relying on a lame gimmick like being girl crazy</br>  <br>Yup, enjoy that SoL while it lasts...</br>  <br>I definitely enjoyed Cell Saga the most, I just feel like it had too much overbearing constant feeling of dread and Cell's introduction was straight from Hammer horror film.</br>  <br>Not really sure honestly. I would assume he would be more like Goku older. Just lighthearted and dopey. I think Goten and Trunks actually doing some good without being obnoxious kids would be neato. <br><br>Mostly I just want  adult Gotenks </br></br></br>  <br>I can't really enjoy the Cell saga these days. It's really only good at the beginning with Trunks and then SS2 Gohan at the end. The middle is just full of pacing bullshit, villain switching and just bullshit in general. Also Cell is boring</br>  <br>Cell had this anal vore thing going for him. I guess I appreciate the slight tonal shift with his saga.</br>  <br> living in South America <br> every normie is totally hyped for Dragon Ball Super <br> tfw you have outgrown it </br></br></br>   Who starts a series by introducing characters? <br>Literally everyone.<br><br>Literally<br><br>everyone</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama needs to write a Goten and Trunks spin-off asap. He could really redeem himself that way.</br>  Anyone have a link to resurrection of F?  <br>It happens exactly like that in real life.<br>Girl is full of herself as a teenager, you fuck her and she becomes fragile and needy.<br><br>I wouldn't expect virgin neets to understand that though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't watch it if you're going to watch the anime, it'll be retold in that.</br>  <br>We don't know yet.<br>Chances are they're just going to timeskip after character introductions.</br></br>  the first episode of DBZ was 90% filler, what did you expect. Toei likes to milk.  <br><br>He never had another hit since then... and there are only a few anime that could be considered a worldwide success like Dragon Ball was.</br></br>  <br><br>It's ok, anon. I'm the same.<br><br>There's nothing wrong if you only watch it for fun, though.</br></br></br></br>  Trunks VA fucking sucks.  I'm sad, i hope they will improve the quality...  i think I like them turning Beerus into a villain. Considering how much junk food he ate in BoG and RoF, he never seemed like the type to care about grease, and I dont think hed blow up a planet for it normally.  <br><br>Toriyama was already swimming in Dr.Slump bucks whe he made Dragon Ball.<br><br>And his style has been pretty mucj the face of the Dragon Quest series for decades now.<br><br>The man is actually going back to the franchise because he wants to ever since the middle 90's. <br><br>my guess is all Dragon Ball Evolution's fault.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oops, I meant to say I DON'T think I like them turning Beerus into a villain.</br>  <br> i am kawai ugu </br>  Best subs atm? Need a good place to watch it.  <br>Don"t worry, that's what Champa is for.</br>  <br>Fuck man, and this is just the first episode<br>What the fuck, this is fucking Dragon Ball dammit.<br>Fuck Toei.</br></br></br>  <br>Beerus won't be a villain, Champa will.</br>  Next question, where is Oob? Based on this episode, they totally forgot him (just like launch)  <br>He doesn't exist yet you fucking retard.<br>This is set 6 months after Kid Boo's death and 9.5 years before last episode of Z.</br></br>  <br> So yeah, it's been nearly 20 years and Toriyama still hasn't learned a fucking thing about pacing <br> le pacing argument <br>try when you've learned a fucking thing about pacing.<br><br> Who starts a series like this? <br>What shonen starts with the final fight right at the begining?<br>Also, it's literally what you DB haters been wanting for years, more SoL. But, of course, you'll always complain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not alive yet.</br>  <br>He's an infant?</br>  <br>As always with these people, its wrong if DB does it.</br>  <br> Not realizing it's a shoop </br>  <br> AND LESS FUCKING GOTEN AND TRUNKS <br>And then there is THIS faggot.</br></br>  <br>It's not you retard.</br>  <br>maybe we'll get another one of those different character designs that differ with each director.</br>  <br>wow this is fucking terrible<br> abysmal voice acting <br> juvenile direction <br> terrible animation <br> obvious budget problems </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> le <br><br>Leave.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably less studious, more typical teenager-y?<br><br>Gohan was an adult by the time he was 8.<br><br>I liked this episode because it's fun to see kids actually being kids.</br></br></br></br></br>   mfw this meme anime   <br>what's sad is that they won't even begin to grow up until they hit 17 years old cuz saiyans' adolescence is longer than hoomans. at the start of the series goku is literally 15 and looks like he's 5</br>  <br>This isnt a jojo thread.<br><br><br>Goku is 12 at the beggining.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegeta is the character most memed in the internet</br>  <br> Bad pacing would be like starting immediately in the middle of a huge brawl <br>Are you implying that Shin Mazinger's first episode was anything but awesome?<br><br>By the way, it's called in media res, and it's a popular literary technique. Get some education.<br><br>"In medias res is Latin for "into the middle of things." It usually describes a narrative that begins, not at the beginning of a story, but somewhere in the middle — usually at some crucial point in the action."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Could this have killed Cell?  <br> Fuck Toei. <br><br>Saint Seiya Omega / Sanctuary of Gold, Sailor Moon Crystal, and now Dragonball Super all ruined by this studio.<br><br>I'm so glad it's not getting preferential treatment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goku was 12, also they're half saiyans and age faster (their hair also keeps growing endlessly like human, while Saiyan stops at one point). In DBO Saiyan blood is so dilluted they don't even grow tails anymore and can't reach basic SSJ either (without wishing on Dragon Balls to unlock it for them)</br>  <br>as far as I know only one group subbed it thus far, they're called AnimeRG and from their past projects it seems like they're not very good (mistranslations, leaving some words, even lines completely untranslated)<br><br>Unison and Baaro might sub it eventually</br></br></br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br>Yes, but only if Cell didn't at last moment realize it was going to fuck him up and try to dodge.<br>The fact he got hit in the first place was because Vegeta taunted him to take it head on instead of just flying away.</br></br>  <br>Those are all anime by Toei, so they didnt ruin it, if anything, they made them bad.<br><br>And super looks good at least in this episode.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off to tumblr fucking pedoshit</br>  <br>Toriyama has had nothing but financial success and therefore no reason to improve himself for the past 20 years.</br>  <br>Baaro completely dropped Dragon Ball because he's a lazy fuckface and would rather release one Detective Conan episode bimonthly instead. He didn't even finish Boo Kai because he wanted to do Conan instead and said he's bored of Dragon Ball. He's THAT committed to projects he starts.<br>Oh and he's been releasing Detective Conan since 2008. That's 7 years and he's only on episode 120 or so. Good luck have fun with that subhuman lazy trash. He's also a libtard nigger.</br></br>  <br> What shonen starts with the final fight right at the begining? <br>Shin Mazinger.</br></br>  Are you literally fucking retarded, OP? Do you think that the pacing problems in DBZ was Toriyama's fault?  I hope Broly becomes canon so the normies like me can be happy while the perma virgin neckbeards of /a/ get mad.  <br>They ruined their own flagship titles by outsourcing their stuff to third world asian shitholes.<br><br>Toei is a deader than dead as a 2d anime studio.</br></br></br>  how can one character be as based as Mr. Satan?<br>He's the true hero of DBZ!</br>  <br>Unison is awful (only slightly better than AnimeRG) and Baaro dropped DB altogether.</br>  <br/>  <br>my sides</br>  <br>The dragon ball anime has always been animated like shit for the most part.</br>  I still hate having half the male cast voiced by women.<br><br>The DB series is the only anime where I wholeheartedly prefer the english dub.</br></br>   Satan's new voice <br><br>they didn't even try to get someone that sounds like Gori, did they?</br></br>  <br> Hey I'm kinda one of the richest men on Earth right now <br> Here have my money I swim in this shit anyway </br></br>  <br>http://the-moonlighters.ml/pelican/<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>i'm pretty sure the utskushii raws rips didn't have any english dub track...</br>  Piccolo is apparently over 220 cm tall<br><br>What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>It's Ishizuka, who voiced Joseph Joestar in JoJo Stardust Crusaders adaptation. He has been voicing Satan in Boo Kai as well.<br><br><br>Indeed they didn't. Only subs ripped from Murrikan Dragon Boxes.</br></br></br></br>   Videl being all dere now <br>I love it.</br>  What a cozy episode. I liked it a lot  <br>I haven't watched Kai 2 specifically because of all the cast changes. particularity Videl's. Glad they brought back the original actress for Super.</br>  <br>if only he knew instant transmission</br>  <br>But Unshou Ishizuka is a great voice and best Jojo</br>  will toei ever update their shitty SFX? are they still using the ones from the 80s? i remember when i watching strong world, they used the super saiyan transformation sound for when Luffy broke the big water ball or whatever  <br>Given its conditions, it couldnt be much better.<br>And is still better than One Piece.</br></br>  this part was so light-hearted and sweet :')  It would have been hilarious Android 18 showed up at Satan's house demanding her cut of the 100 million Satan just gave away    <br>She became a mother anon.</br>  <br>He's alright, but i liked the gravelly-ness of the old voice better.</br>  <br>Not yet</br>  <br><br>She got it in Bio Broly.</br></br>  <br>I like that stuff but how could they be so dumb that they dont even know hot spring water should be hot? Not that the end result would change anything since its still just water.</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Kai 1 had changed VAs as well BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THEY'RE DEAD YOU FUCKING IDIOT</br>  <br>She isn't even married yet.<br>That reminds me, will we get a wedding episode?</br></br>  <br>well i haven't watched that either.<br>also, caps lock is for autistics.</br></br>  So who's waiting for the  superior  Mexican dub?<br><br>I heard fucking FOX had licensed the show, which is weird, but I'll take it if it means original Goku, Vegeta and Piccolo.</br></br>  I liked this episode a lot. It feels like if DBZ never ended. It got a few chuckles out of me too.  <br>did gohan really need his voice changed to luffy though?</br>  <br>Are you new to Tohei, kiddo?</br>  I liked it. Also who do you guys think supreme kai is worried about at the end of it?  <br>This. Videl was completely domesticated. Thank god GT is no longer canon tho</br>  <br>He has always been the tallest. He's Piccolo Daimao reincarnation after all.</br>  <br> you will never a young bulma </br>  Any word on how long this is going to be? 1-cour? 2? Long as fuck?    <br>No remember he came back from a single cell when he blew himself up.</br>  <br><br>It never was.<br><br><br><br>Not reincarnation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? He's still voiced by Goku's VA.<br>Or are you talking about dub? In which case you should kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>100 episodes as of now.</br>  Is there any subs right now?  <br> So who's waiting for the superior Mexican dub? <br>I want to watch it now, specially given people wont be generous with spoilers.<br><br> I heard fucking FOX had licensed the show, which is weird, <br>It's not weird since they distributed RoF here.<br>That said, it was a fake rumor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying <br>I'm waiting for the superior Portuguese dub.</br></br>  <br><br>Krillin's VA is Luffy.</br></br>  <br>  Toriyama still hasn't learned a fucking thing about pacing <br>He provided the plot concept, he isn't writing the script. Also, if you weren't expecting nostalgic and calm start then congratulations, you are retarded.</br></br>  <br>Yes he is a reincarnation. He has all the memories of the original Daimao and he himself touts himself as reincarnation both during 23rd Tenkaichi Tournament and at multiple points in DBZ.</br>  <br>no, DB /a/ fans are so versed in japanese that they just watched it raw.</br>  <br>What are those numbers?</br>  100-150 episodes, probably a bit shorter than Kai.<br> Peace Arc <br> Battle of Gods Arc <br> Revival of F Arc <br> Universe 16 Arc </br></br></br></br>   the tori bot money <br><br>Ayy lmao</br></br>  <br>100 episodes planned for Season 1.</br>  <br><br>Yes. Watch from Kissanime.</br></br>  What if...DBS was all SOL like this ep and Kyoani was in charge?  <br>I watched it raw. but i do feel like a sub should be nearby soon.</br>  Poor Piccolo, now that his stepson (he's more of a father to him than Goku) is getting married he has nobody to hang out with and nothing to do with his life  <br>8 cours.</br>  <br><br><br>No. Toei website has been updated.<br><br>http://www.toei-animation.com/en/co<wbr>ntent/dragon-ball-super-0</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot /a/ was like this</br>  <br>you're not very bright, are you?</br>  <br>He's still the strongest base form character.</br>  <br>Expect female namek in alternate universe.</br>  <br>So what dragon ball haters always wanted?<br><br>They would say it's shit because there's no fights.</br></br></br>  <br> /dragon-ball-super-0 <br>0 episodes confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Second strongest is Android 18, right?</br>  <br>I'm pretty bright, theres one pretty odd sub out right now, and i a lot of the fan-subbers aren't... you know. But yeah. guess i'm not,</br>  <br>http://www.idigitaltimes.com/dragon<wbr>-ball-super-release-date-confirmed-<wbr>july-2015-over-100-episodes-planned<wbr>-440343<br>http://www.designntrend.com/article<wbr>s/50449/20150509/dragon-ball-super-<wbr>may-have-over-100-episodes-maybe-mo<wbr>re-if-successful.htm</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  i heard the F movie proved that goku was actually low tier in power levels and can be beaten by anyone with a laser gun  <br>His height, anon.</br>  <br>Piccolo can use split form so he can go fuck himself.</br>  <br>There was fighting in the first episode. Goten and Trunks fought a giant snake. It was great.</br>  <br>Actually I forgot about Buu, so in terms of people who cant transform at will its Buu &gt; Piccolo &gt; 18 &gt; the rest of the cast.</br>  <br> 7 meters </br>  <br>pardon, i'm french. but i do know a lot of english.</br>  <br>It was kinda like the first Z episode. Some of this thread are forgetting how DBZ really started.</br>  <br> i heard the F movie proved that goku was actually low tier in power levels <br>Not really, no<br><br>  can be beaten by anyone with a laser gun <br>That's shit writing, but it wasnt intended to prove that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>From the comments:<br><br> Beg pardon: where exactly are you getting an episode count from? The initial press release said nothing about it at all, and no series is picked up for a 100 episode run when untested. </br></br></br></br>  <br>He had his Guard down when it happened</br>  <br>in foot yuropoor</br>  <br>The first DBZ episode that aired in the states actually completely cut out the whole Goku looking for Gohan thing.</br>  Do you think giant snake was stronger than giant fish in DB's first ep? Could kid Goku from the beginning beat giant snake? Goten and Trunks actually had just a bit of trouble and they're probably a million time stronger than kid Goku a the time. What kind of overpowered snake is that?  <br> self induced daily dosage loop. </br>  <br>I don't know if I would call it "great". Why didn't they completely demolish it in seconds? How is there still an animal on earth capable of standing up to them for any amount of time?</br>  <br>  no series is picked up for a 100 episode run when untested. <br>Not disagreeing with you here, but this is dragon ball, so not an entirely untested product. Moreso considering it exists just so Toei and Shueisha can find a One Piece companion.</br></br>  <br>7 feet and 5 inches. 2.26 meters.<br><br>It isn't hard to google anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Y'a des sous titres français négro.</br>  <br>I'm glad I got to watch the superior Latino release.</br>  Need some quality subs<br><br>any help?</br></br>  <br>It's a SoL show now. There's no such thing as pacing for SoL as it has no point.</br>  <br><br>They didnt use their full power because they would have wrecked shit with that.</br></br>  <br>or even just dragon ball for that matter.</br>  <br> mfw seeing the preview for the next episode <br><br>filler episodes are my literal favorite in dragon ball. it's just them being the super powered idiots they are trying their hardest not to turn everything around them into dust. So hype it's back.</br></br></br>  Trunks talking goten into not fucking murdering that snake was a nice scene  <br>Funny, I'm a nigger myself. But i lost a lot of my french since then. Thanks.</br>   YFW the series will be fun, but it won't have the same level of violence of DBZ or maybe even lower than DB (Blood, gunshots, pierced chests, etc.) <br> Also, no ecchi scenes. </br>  Dude I just realized that TFS Abridged series running gag of Goku's kids with abandonment issues is so spot on. He literally can't wait to get away from his own son.  <br>Still missing the background monsters and anthros.</br>  <br>Come on, don't tell me they couldn't punch through it with ease. It's a fucking snake from earth.</br>  <br> needing a shitty overrated parody to know that <br><br>He wasnt running away from Goten anyways, he just wanted to train.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying /a/ or anyone doesn't like Broly <br><br>u wot m8</br></br></br></br>  <br>right?</br>  <br>If they rape One Piece on a weekly basis they will shat on DBSuper any day</br>  How do saiyans have sex without breaking their partners in half?  <br>Just like how Goten and Trunks didn't break the giant snake in half.</br>  <br>Yeah it's overrated of course, doesn't mean it's shitty.<br>Plus, I'm currently down with a mild case of stupid after sitting through estrogen OD Goku, so there's that.</br></br>  <br>i just dont understand why one piece has a worse budget per episode than generic harem animes<br><br>like even naruto is better animated</br></br></br>  <br>Base form saiyans are weak as shit.</br>  <br><br><br>stop trying to apply logic to dragon ball<br><br>this kind of discussion is not what the series is about</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the driving episode and gohan going to highschool </br>  <br>Controling their powerlevels.</br>  <br>He is also a stalker and hates normies.</br>  <br>Because it sells anyway. And Toei doesn't give a shit.</br>  <br>Post link</br>  <br>Didn't you watch the episode?</br>  <br>Remember this guy? You do? My point exactly.<br>You don't? My point exactly.</br></br>  <br> drinks alcohol <br> bribes dirty old men using his friend's wives <br> accepts money so he can escape from his family to go train <br> tfw Goku is not pure anymore <br><br>I bet he can't even ride the Flying Nimbus (not that he needs to, but...)</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Next Episode: Vegeta goes on a family trip <br>OH BOY</br>  <br>Stopped watching when the ED started playing</br>  <br>My nigger.<br>Hard to believe there are people who dislike those episodes.<br><br>It was at the end of the first episode, dummy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's at the end of the episode</br>  <br>Nobody has to enjoy such shit only because nostalgia-baited.<br>The first 2.25 minutes were hands down the best part, that should tell you something.</br></br>  <br>I do, filler king of the filler bug planet which brown haired Vegeta in lemon gree-red armor then explodes while breathing in space.</br>     videl turns into an ara ara lady <br>This pleases my dick.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>It's just rehashed 9fag tier jokes that just proves how retarded americans are regarding dragon ball.<br>the yugioh one is way better and is not even that good still.<br><br><br><br>One Piece is aimed at families (with little criteria regarding animation), and made on a weekly basis with no end in sight, so it would require a way bigger budget than it can have. It's the same reason dragon ball, seiya and such shows have the animation they had. And it sells so it doesnt need to improve.<br><br>Harem shows are made for otaku (who are a bit more critical with animation, albeit not much since they still like trash), and last 12 episodes so you get a better budget distribution.<br><br> like even naruto is better animated <br>Based on some scenes and movies I watched, Naruto is awfully animated and way worse than One Piece. Which is surprising since it's the same studio that did Bleach and is not even doing Bleach anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Left: After losing virginity<br>Right: Before losing virginity<br>This applies to most woman in existence.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I know. So disappoint.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>   Roshi mentioning DVDs <br><br>fucking real world progress leaking into a fictional universe.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, there's no point in arguing, cause the power bloat thing kind of speaks for itself. Besides, I had a good idea of what to expect.</br>  <br><br><br>No, fuck you.<br>Goten and Trunks having to fight that thing instead of just dodging it and flying away was retarded as hell.<br>That was a monster even kid Goku from the first episodes of DB wouldn't have had trouble with, and we know both kiddos are many many times stronger than he was.<br>Don't even try to justify that shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will gohan finally get to do something? Or will he continue to either being a mama's boy/Videls bitch or get jobbed so that Goku can continue being the MC  If you didn't notice the Head Cha-La BGM being played in the prologue, get out.  <br>Completely ruined the character. Toriyama turned her into just another baby maker like literally every female in the naruto series.</br>  <br> People actually believe this </br>  <br>Given their world was always more advanced than real world, it makes sense there are dvds.<br><br><br>  instead of just dodging it and flying  <br>You mean what they did?<br>Why do dragon ball haters never bother to watch/read what they're hating?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   people who can blow up planets not blowing up planets <br><br>Why even watch</br></br>  <br>Didn't you notice how Trunks let it escape? They were trying not to wreck it. Pay attention before you spout bullshit.</br>  <br> implying you wouldn't this Videl as your wife. </br>  <br>He got to beat Cell. People didn't like him as the main hero, which is why they brought Goku back.</br>  Why were the media so surprised by Buu's apearance?<br>Weird looking people are normal on DB Earth, just look at Pilaf, King Furry, etc</br>  <br>It was a joke, you fucking retard.</br>  <br>QUALITY</br>   Vegeta filler next episode   <br>He looks even more tame than usual, I dunno.</br>  <br> BAWWWW WHY ISN'T VIDEL STILL A BITCH <br>Slag off.</br></br>  <br> what is sarcasm </br>  <br>Oh they're doing it alright. Off-screen.</br>  <br>you're waifu no chin havin shit now. you mad?</br>  <br>What I wondered is why did nobody recognize him as Buu but I guess they wished that or something. It's been a while since I watched the ending of DBZ.</br>  So we're not gonna talk about the heinous act of wiping the memories of the buu saga from every person on earth?  <br>Naruto has better average animation than one piece if you don't count fillers<br><br>one piece is just consistently shit animation and I can't stand it. I love the manga so much and it just kills me to see it ruined</br></br></br>   mr satan is Job Truniht <br><br>SHIEEEEEEEEEEET</br></br>  <br>None of those are actually QUALITY shots.</br>  I didn't like the music.  <br>They literally spell out everyone forgetting Buu in the show's intro, did you skip that?</br>  <br><br>I'm just saying they could have IMMEDIATELY dodged it by jumping up in air in a split second instead of having to dance around with it.<br>That shit had me so disgusted I just skipped a couple of minutes ahead.</br></br></br>  <br>Guess /fit/ drew that.</br>   tfw Videl will never force you to lick her sweat after a long training   <br>So what you're saying is that her face is really like that.</br>  <br>I loved it.</br>  <br>why did they forget him? was it part of the wish when they were brought back to life?</br>  <br>...It's from the old Z opening</br>  <br> Naruto has better average animation than one piece if you don't count fillers <br>I wont disagree because, as I said, I didnt watch the whole thing.<br><br> I love the manga so much and it just kills me to see it ruined <br>There are reasons for it to be like this. It's either that or making it seasonal which would change it entirely.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Naruto seriously looks like that all the time <br><br>Like One Piece, Naruto has episodes where they try and then most of the time they don't</br></br></br>  <br> That shit had me so disgusted I just skipped a couple of minutes ahead. <br>You might have autism.</br></br>  <br>This wasn't mentioned in the manga version</br>  <br>Yup, worst girl.</br>  <br>The artist for that episode of naruto is rarely used</br>  <br> implying she trains anymore  <br>she's gohan's hole and bank now</br></br>  <br>...You mean Funi opening.</br>  <br>Yeah, dragon ball isnt exactly known for its realistic artstyle you know.<br><br><br>That'd be pretty boring. This is dragon ball, fun matters more than consistency and it always has.</br></br></br></br>  <br>REMEMBER KIDS<br><br>YOU GET A WIFE AND THIS CAN HAPPEN TO YOU TOO</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck that hairstyle.</br>  <br>Funi openings were still animated by Toei you fucking retard.</br>  Honestly, I was expecting major QUALITY from this, but for being a mostly filler episode, I loved it very much. Goku's back to being an absentee dad again. Goten seems like he might get more screentime, seeing as Gohan is no longer a fighter anymore. Goten is great, as he has a bit of young Goku's personality and fearlessness.  <br> That shit had me so disgusted I just skipped a couple of minutes ahead. <br>Literal autism<br><br><br>I'm pretty sure it was</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he watched the american dbz dub </br>  <br>Vegeta's character development is great</br>  <br>Naruto actually has a lot of sakuga scenes<br>But it also has a lot of fillers so they have the money to make a good looking episode once a while</br></br>  <br>I'm sure they play it rough in bed and Videl slaps the shit out of Gohan because she's frustrated she can't get as strong as him</br>  <br>People say that there aren't retards in Dragon Ball threads but I keep seeing things like this</br>  <br>Who do you kick off the team, /a/?<br><br> HARD MODE: No chaotsu </br></br></br>  <br>I watched FUCK THE DRAGON on Youtube.</br>  <br>Everything you say is sadly true, and I dearly hope none of your speculations become reality.</br>  <br>well yeah she's definitely still a top but her fightan days are well over</br>  <br>Who says so?<br>I barely get into DB threads anymore despite it being my favorite series because people here are too retarded to understand a show for kids.</br></br>  <br> People say that there aren't retards in Dragon Ball threads <br>What? Just look the opening post.</br></br>  <br>Yamcha</br>  <br>Don't worry, I was only pretending to be retarded because the guy I replied to was being retarded. But maybe he was pretending too! Ah, the hijinks of posting!</br>  I hope Gohan stops jobbing.<br><br>I really want him to outsmart opponents instead of blasting the fuck out of them.</br></br>  <br>Just a joke.</br>  <br>Chiaotzu is the correct answer.</br>  <br><br><br>is this even a question!?</br></br></br>  <br>seems like nips indeed like pan from dbgt<br><br>maybe that's why looks like gohan married her daughter</br></br></br>  <br>What is Beerus</br>    <br>epic meme XD</br>  <br> Hard mode: Not Yamcha <br>Yamcha</br></br>  <br>Not sure, she's not pregnant yet. Maybe she still trains and fight, I hope we'll see her fighting, she's probably top 5 humans.</br>  mandatory  <br> No, I fought Kakarot. Nappa fought everyone else. Except this one scrub who got blown up by a Saiba---- HHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHHAHA </br>  Anyone else hoping she makes an appearance?    A review from the wonderful Danny D's World... Look at his masterpiece speech of his. :3 http://<span>youtu.be/RSnipNPZQWk  [ ]  It was pretty adorable<br><br>I loved the opening scene where Goku choked on his lunch and Goten fell off the cliff, and the music was really calming and lighthearted. <br><br>I don't like Trunks voice actor</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well let's be honest, who is she gonna fight? She only fought petty criminals cause she was lashing out at being thought of as weaker than her dad. Also was a big tsundere. Now she's gonna be a mom soon.<br><br>It's like saying "I wish Yamcha and Tenshinhan could get stronger" even though you know they are about to be fighting gods and universal threats as strong as gods</br></br></br>  <br>Which ones? Goku being deadbeat dad, or Goten becoming a more central character? I'm pretty sure it's still "Goku Vegeta and the rest", but Goten didn't get much screentime in Z without Trunks beside him. The OP showed Gohan still has Mystic form, so maybe he'll do some fighting. I think the series will be different than the movies, and hopefully that means with more episodes, the other characters are given time to shine a bit.</br>  <br>Assuming we're talking about the moment Super started and that half humans dont count as humans:<br><br> Ten <br> Krillin <br> Yamcha <br> Chaoz <br> Roshi <br><br>so no.<br><br><br>fake</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not complaining about the comedy, but about the forced comedy.<br>You should never use comedy as an excuse to disregard consistency.<br>Never settle.</br></br></br>  <br><br> filler episode 50 <br> videl is pregnant <br> timeskip <br> pan with same GT artstyle is here </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yamcha really does suck though.<br>At least Krillin is likable, and Tien can be badass at times.</br></br>  <br>You know that is fake right?<br><br><br>This part actually made me laugh</br></br></br></br>  <br> POPO STRONGER THAN KAMI <br> POPO STRONGER THAN PICCOLO AND GOKU AT START OF Z <br>I CALL BULLSHIT</br></br></br>      <br>Trunks wasn't so bad. Boo on the other hand. One of the few times I prefer the dub voice.</br>  <br>Krillin has one of the deadliest moves in the series yet never remembers how or when to use it.</br>  <br>i know right memes are great XD</br>  <br>It's bullshit.<br>Tory himself said that the power levels didn't jump that much.</br></br>   Goku will never be proud of you   <br>She just has to lift her shirt and she has total advantage over Roshi.</br>  I just watched the first episode. I thought it was super cute. and the next episode looks like it will be too. I'd like to see more stuff like this but some balls out cool fights will be nice too.  Who the fuck is even subbing this? I don't see it on news..  <br> You should never use comedy as an excuse to disregard consistency. <br>But that is literally what Toriyama does all the time</br></br>  <br>Kienzan is such an OP move, that it has to be nerfed in terms of timing.</br>  <br> Goku using machinery when he could do it all by hand in under a second </br>  <br>and whats that?</br>  <br> Not complaining about the comedy, but about the forced comedy. <br>That's not comedy though, there's no jokes in there. And DB is partially a gag comedy manga so yeah, you will have comedy.<br><br> You should never use comedy as an excuse to disregard consistency. <br>You should have completely forgotten the idea of consistency the second you started consuming any dragon ball media, even the manga.<br><br><br> Yamcha really does suck though. <br>fuck off american</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm making webms.<br>any requests?</br>  <br>We've been over this<br>-Chichi wants him to know hard day's work<br>-He gets to slack off and be lazy so he can train if he does it slow. He even says this in the episode</br></br></br>  <br>No one yet officially, but I saw a group called Gogo on nyaa that made a sub file for the RAW. It wasn't bad.</br>  <br>http://animerg.net/anime/info/103</br>  <br>goten's just the cutest.</br>  <br>Kienzan</br>  <br>maybe goku lacks the exactitude of the farm machinery.</br>  <br>What the fuck? Everyone complains that Goku sounds like a woman in Japanese but Buu's English voice is even more high pitched.</br>  My one fear about this series is that Goku/Gohan/Goten's VA is pretty damn old now, so what if she kicks the bucket in the near future?  <br> Chichi wants him to know hard day's work <br>Why, exactly? Was saving the world not hard work?</br></br>  <br> I haven't watched it yet. </br>  <br>what it cuts through mountains and shit? that it?</br>  <br>Goten falling off cliff and goku using IT to catch him<br><br> That serious goku face </br></br></br>  <br>I mean in actually getting a job and not fighting.</br>  <br>Goten has no personality, he just a moeblob</br>  <br>grumpy chichi</br>  <br> You will never live in the Dragon Ball world <br>Kill me.</br></br>  <br>Buu is cuddly and cute. Goku isn't.</br>  <br>Masako Nozawa is as immortal as Stan Lee</br>  <br>Chichi is all for appearances, status in society and money. She don't care as long as Goku makes her look good. She may actually be a whore.</br>  <br> mfw I don't mind Goten at all but Trunks is just super annoying and Gotenks' personality is 100% Trunks </br>  <br>It was literally the technique that defeated freeza. Do you even watch the show?</br>  <br>gonna need to be a little more specific.</br>  <br>No i dont.</br>  <br> Implying he's not </br>  <br>well goku shouldn't sound like a 12 year old girl, buu however is a fat pink blob, his voice first perfect.</br>  <br> Gotenks' personality is 100% Trunks <br>The arrogance is Trunks. The full-retard childish mindset that leads to that arrogance is Goten</br></br>  <br>what this guy said though<br><br>if they copy gt at all goten won't have any personality until he realizes he can put his penis into a vagina then he becomes a ladies man</br></br></br>  <br> Can cut through anything no matter how high their powerlevel <br> Cuts off Freeza's tail <br> Freeza tries to shamelessly copy it as last ditch effort to kill Goku <br> Gets cut in half <br>It's OP as fuck<br> inb4 that one retard that says it didn't work against Cell without realizing it was filler </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> well goku shouldn't sound like a 12 year old girl <br>No, that is how he should sound. Americans have a vastly different perception of Goku than Toriyama and the rest of Japan does.<br><br>And he sounds like a 12 year old 'boy' get it right</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wouldn't neighbors be more impressed if he did a whole days work in five minutes?</br></br>  <br> well goku shouldn't sound like a 12 year old girl <br>He's lighthearted as fuck, I don't care how old he is.</br></br>  <br>it didn't work against Cell</br>  <br>He has that voice for tradition, not because it fits him.</br>   fuckers saying Yamcha sucks <br>ROGAFUFU KEN<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8kr<wbr>7BKP5amM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I want people to stop applying logic to DBZ.</br>  <br>Filler.</br>  <br>Gohan caught the ones cell threw at him</br>  <br>What happened to the nimbus?</br>  <br> Living in India. <br> Everyone's a fucking normie. </br></br>  <br>Bills cutting that planet in half with his finger.</br>  <br>One of my favorites songs.<br>The latin version is awesome too.</br></br>  <br>Higher testosterone levels is linked with deeper voices. It's irrefutable that Goku's Japanese voice is awful and unfitting.</br>  <br>Last time it was used was by Gohan and Goten. They're still pure enough, but not much longer for Gohan if he's getting married soon.</br>    <br>when she didn't wanted to share any zeni with roshi</br>  <br>Gohan is the strongest character who doesn't have to transform. He's also the strongest character in general.</br>  <br>Doesn't corrin have a bunch of them?</br>  <br>I rage every time i see fucking hipster Gohan.</br>  <br>Just the whole clip of Roshi asking to buy porn.</br>  <br>can you change the file name from engrish i hate that.</br>  <br>Mystic Gohan says hi</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br><br>Uub rides it at the very end of the series</br></br>  <br>Thats a transformation.</br>  <br>why the fuck would the director dump the animation budget into the first episode<br>any smart animation director would save their budget for the important fight scenes just like they did with DBZ</br></br>  <br>you miss the heart and soul of what dragon ball is actually about</br>  <br>The part in the OP where Beerus and Champa descend.</br>  <br>As of this episode of super, yeah, but as shown in RoF he loses that later.<br>There, Goku and Vegeta are the stronger without transforming.<br><br>Of course, as long as we count only the Z warriors and not Bills, Whiss and the other 2.<br><br><br><br>The entire point of that is that it's not a transformation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Link?</br>  <br>Uub won't show up for a while, since the ending of Z was 5 years later or something. Maybe he'll show up later in Super.</br>  <br>Because nostalgiafags don't watch anime and they have no way to compare and they doesn't see it shit.</br>  Why was that snake so strong?  <br>Toriyama confirmed Gohan's SSJ in RoF is applied on top of Mystic, not Gohan losing access to Mystic.</br>    Why does Goku need to teleport to stop the truck?<br><br>Why do Goten and Trunks struggle with a snake?<br><br>These characters should be able to move faster than the speed of sound and lift mountains effortlessly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sauce or else I'm calling BS</br>  <br> The entire point of that is that it's not a transformation. <br><br>First of all it is and second of all if it wasnt there wouldnt be this big thing about Gohan not being able to go Mystic anymore in RoF.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not though. He basically maxed himself out so he doesn't have to transform to get stronger. He's at his peak now 24/7.<br> Seeing how Mystic works, that seems redundant, as he wouldn't get any stronger. The only time it would be relevant would be for the God form creation I would guess.</br></br>  <br>It was the legendary super snake.</br>  <br> and they doesn't see it shit. </br>  Good subs when.  <br> irrefutable <br>lol. dude, he is an alien from a planet of monkey people in a show about fighting off aliens. you're so full of shit</br></br>  <br>Can you make a webm of the preview where Beerus moves his eyes, licks his lips, and then is looking at an hourglass, but replace the hourglass with a penis?</br>  rate the opening theme<br><br>I give it a 7/10<br><br>Nowhere near as good as Cha la/Dan Dan</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying goten was in danger <br><br> Implying goten couldn't fly out and catch the tractor himself </br></br></br>  <br>The tone is all different. No-one's OP by default now. But once they try, they are. I donno don't ask me.</br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>sped up webm of goku getting satan's money and teleporting to king kai's place</br>  <br>6/10. not memorable but not offputting, got me hyped remember that I'm actually watching a brand new episode of dragon ball. Kinda like breaking a giant stone wall open to find my hype underneath.</br>  <br> not Gohan losing access to Mystic. <br>Gohan doesnt "access" mystic, it's just his strength at base form. He didnt train so he lost that.<br><br>Also sauce.<br><br><br> be this big thing about Gohan not being able to go Mystic anymore in RoF. <br>Rewatch it, Gohan says he didnt keep up with his training, so he got weaker. that's because it's not a fixed transformation you can have.<br><br>Heck, Mystic is a fan term, is not an actual new level. Gohan already unlocked his potentianl in Namek and I dont see anyone saying "Namek Gohan".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The best part of the episode for me was finding out who Mr. Satan was.  Pretty good start overall and the story is pretty good at least on the LN. what do you think /a/.<br><br>Also <br> FREMY THE ONLY BEST GIRL <br> RABBIT CAN SUCK DICKS AND GTFO </br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously? Who?</br>  <br>Hint: only one of those two spoilers i wrote is true. Another one is clearly fake.</br>  <br>The first spoiler is false, the second is true.</br>  They had Sawashiro as the narrator? What a waste.  <br>That was the fake then, I find it hard to believe.</br>   http://yusaani.com/news/2015/07/05<wbr>/150922/</wbr> <br>Whole series confirmed for being adapted ala Monogatari.<br>Are you excited yet?</br></br>   Excited for SAO <br><br>No, because I'm not a huge faggot with shit taste.</br></br>  Two years  Monogatari didn't invent full adaptations.  <br>Does it mean more rape doujins?</br>  <br>Will Kazuto finally always look like a girl like he's supposed to?</br>  WORTH  JUST  Kirito goes into a coma because of the evil NSA.<br><br>The surviving Law guys try to train up a peasant army in preparation for the Chaos invasion (Chaos are led by the literal God of Darkness who is also an evil NSA agent who eats souls like rape).<br><br>They get rekt, but Kirito's harem save them with GM accounts and deebeezeee powerlevels.<br><br>NSA connect UW to the internet and get 50,000 American players to connect (it was advertized to them as a beta test for a new AO-rated VRMMO where you're allowed to slaughter anything and everything you like, with blood and guts), they mass murder UW residents and think it's hilarious.<br><br>To defeat them the main characters get 2,000 Japanese VRMMO players to connect. Despite the difference in numbers the Japanese are superior and win because Asian gamer damashii.<br><br>Then PoH (who is also an evil NSA agent) unleashes a zerg rush of Korean and Chinese gamers who were recruited by being told this is the a Korean VRMMO that's in beta test but evil Japanese hackers broke into the server, turned off pain dampening and are torturing their countrymen.<br><br>Even when some Japs who speak Korean try to explain the situation to them they don't listen because hurr japanese<br><br>The other NSA guys are surprised this works, they thought it wouldn't be worth it because they didn't think Japan is more different from Korea/China than European countries are from each other (hurr).<br><br>Kirito wakes up and wipes them all out in one attack though.<br><br>(Also PoH's motivation is that he's Korean and he hates Japanese so when he got stuck in SAO he decided to set up Laughing Coffin and have them and the clearers kill each other for shits and giggles because Nips killing each other is hilarious.)<br><br>Leafa and Sinon get almost tentacle raped because Kawahara loves them tentacles but Sinon gunfights with a real American.

That's hilarious.</br>  <br>I wish there was a short children's book with this plot. It would be the best.</br>  <br>They're correct in broad strokes, but skim over or exaggerate many details.<br><br>For example the reason the Japs win against Americans is because they're using exported high level accounts rather than newly created level 1. It's not enough to defeat the Chinese and the Koreans, though.</br></br></br>  <br>This looks like bullshit, but I believe it.</br>  I look forward for more doujins.  <br>It's from the webnovel. How much the author may change when all is said and done, is unknown. If past experience is something to go by, he'll dial back the numbers some at the least.</br>  <br>That sounds like both the dumbest shit ever and the most hilarious shit ever. 11/10 will watch every episode</br>  <br>Of course when they need players that have to be evil they get Americans, and when they need to save the day they get Japanese.<br><br>I get it, you guys are still sour that you lost.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, SAO is nothing but literally bad writing.<br><br>It started off really good but toward the end of the first arc it just went down the shitter.</br></br></br>  <br>this is just dumb enough to make me think it's real</br>  <br>It was only good for the first episode.<br><br>Also the books SAO II was based off of were actually decent (except any time Kirito was in them), but A-1 fucked up their adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br> except any time Kirito was in them <br>As the protagonist, was that not a frequent occurrence?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm still waiting for the new Cior doujin, it came out june 14th.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/817410/069ec2<wbr>25ec/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He shouldn't have been the protagonist of GGO (and even then it was arguable, since Sinon effectively carried 90% of that arc herself while Kirito was off playing Jedi), and he really was not the protag of Mother Rosario, though I'd stopped watching the anime before that point so I have no idea how they adapted that arc.<br><br>I know they missed their chance at ending SAO II on the cliffhanger of Johny Black killing Kirito, so they fucked up on that.</br></br></br>  <br>So we get to see Kirito be killed by desu gun?<br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>They didnt say that though. Everyone was jsut asking for the next season of their favorite series and they we're give vague replies like as long as people show their support and theres enough material and they secure funds then it might happen.</br>  <br>There's a decent chance we might not see SAO III. The next arc is a mess that's looking to be longer than the rest of the series before it (meaning there's no chance they can adapt the arc in a single season). Splitting an arc between seasons can't be appealing for a show that tries to get through two arcs a season.</br>  <br> Project Alicization <br><br>I can't wait for A-1 to blow the animation budget on Kirito and Eugeo whittling down that giant tree and halfass everything else.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Lumberjack HYPE</br></br>  <br>The most Sakuga tree-chopping action you'll ever see.</br>  <br>SAO makes Naruto look like the AOTD that is how shitty SAO is.</br>  <br>Yeah. I like SAO</br>  It amazes me how popular SAO is and .Hack is still considered shit.  I actually liked most of what I read of Alicization.<br><br>And then you find out how the arc went in the web novel.</br></br>  <br>It's still possible to change it for the LN.</br>  <br>Anime adaptations of .Hack are ultra shit while SAOs at least are more than just talking and walking on the town.</br>      <br><br> Of course when they need players that have to be evil they get Americans, and when they need to save the day they get Japanese. <br><br>If it's a chinese story, then both americans and japanese are the bad guys and at least some americans will get killed in real life when they come over to try their violence spiel as they do with all countries.</br></br></br></br>  What if instead of animating Alicization, they animate Progressive?  <br>Not enough material yet.</br>  <br>yet another rapist psichopat villain</br>  <br>It's obvious from a business point of view, normies eat this shit up.</br>  <br>No raping this time, just psychopaths.</br>   Monogatari has the main couple get together early and fuck but still has a ton of girls that want the MCs D. <br> Popular, full adaption. <br> SAO has the main couple get together early and fuck but still has a ton of girls that want the MCs D. <br> Popular, full adaption. <br>Are psuedo-harems with sex the wave of the future? I welcome this change.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't really rape people, he just gets turned on when eating delicious souls.</br>  Never watched the second half of season 2, but I heard the only player better than Kirito dies of AIDS.  <br>That's about right, I guess.</br>  <br> SAO III <br>Didn't SAO II bomb?</br></br>  <br>Now that I think about it, they might be able to scrounge up enough material if they mix the manga and LN versions for the anime.<br><br>There's no way if they go with just the novels though.</br></br></br>  <br>asuna a cute<br>cute!</br></br>    I'm excited, SAO gets a lot of hate, but I enjoy it quite a bit.<br><br>To hear that they'll be adapting the novels probably to the end is great, I can't wait for Alicization to begin.</br></br>  <br>The only thing ever good to come out of this is BUN BUN art, and now we have YYY so SAO is unneeded.</br>  <br>GLOP</br>  <br>huh, I just marathoned the first two seasons. I'm actually pretty glad it's getting more eps.</br>  I just start watching this, it very good. Your thoughts? I say, anime of the season, personally  shouldn't be allowed  I'm waiting to see if Hiryuu actually sub it and if their subs are any better than Funi's. Otherwise I'll just watch the raw + .ass I've got. <br><br>Hopefully it's enjoyable.</br></br>  still waiting for non funishit  <br><br>Sensei best girl</br></br>  Crazy scientist girl is my waifu, I love sickly looking perverted girls with huge bags under their eyes  meme of the season  <br>H-haram!!</br>  <br>Will she ever learn how is babby formed?</br>  <br> I love sickly looking perverted girls with huge bags under their eyes <br><br>Simply the best</br></br></br>  <br>Initially I thought it was a very Japanese take on Fahrenheit 451 or Equilibrium...but it's gonna be more SYD...which is fine too.</br>  <br>Also, terrorist is the best girl, at least when she's wearing glasses.</br>   FUNi hardcode eyecancer garbagestreams <br> SYD-ripoff <br> good </br></br>  <br> being you <br><br>yeah I know. You suck</br></br></br>  <br> Your thoughts? <br>You need standards.</br></br>  Laughed pretty hard, being like SYD makes it great.  It might be one of the stupidest fucking anime I've ever watched.  I love it.   <br>It's shit and so is your taste</br>  I think it's funny and I like the characters. One of this season's better shows.  <br><br>not him, but you're a faggot, accept than this is trash and you're trash.</br></br>   eechi humor <br><br>this is literally high school tier and only funny to immature kids</br></br>  <br>I would teach her the complex mechanisms involved in the act of reproduction, if you catch my drift</br>  <br> bags under eyes <br>The best~!</br></br>  <br>It's funny in the context of the show, though. It's not just the toilet humour that's funny, it's that being exposed to a nation so heavily censored that they literally don't know how babies are made.</br>  <br>Its not good only because of the censorship.<br>I can understand if it's a little censorship but this was mass heaps even for me. The manga is a better place to start. I'm still too salty cause of the china-tier levels of censorship.</br></br>  You should be able to solve this.    <br>PONOS IN VAGOOO</br>  It may not be AOTS material, but it has the best ED so far.  <br>you pee in a a girls butt right?</br>  <br>walk her home gently</br>  <br>Right.</br>  It's so good. Like diarrhea in my mouth.  <br>Mah nigga. Tomoko's existence is like a dream come true.</br>  This definitely AOTS for me. <br><br> I miss World Break, I liked when Oreimo and Haganai aired. This shit feels right up that alley.<br><br>tl;dr My taste is shit.</br></br> </br></br>  Why is Funimation so shit?  <br> AOTS <br> before the 3 episode rule <br> before all shows this season have even aired <br><br>Yeehaw boys, we got ourselves a gen-u-ine retard here I tell you what!</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to know how much she's getting paid to voice this.  <br><br>Love it personally, but I'm fairly certain there are shitposters from SRS complaining about the show being immature, etc...</br></br>  <br><br>OOH HO HO HO HOOO~!</br></br>  <br>Isn't it a tad bit humorous that a show about lewd censorship got the censor treatment?</br>  How strong are the police shields?  First for best girl  <br>They can take multiple bullets easy.</br>   First for best species   4th for anime rory looks like shit  Riot shields are lightweight protection devices deployed by police and some military organizations. Riot shields are almost exclusively long enough to cover an average-sized man from the top of the head to the knees. Some riot shields are designed to be bullet resistant against low-velocity handgun and shotgun ammunition; however, most are not. They are generally intended to be used in riot control, to protect the user from shrapnel, thrown projectiles, and splash from various weapons such as a Molotov cocktail. They can also be used as short-ranged melee weapons to push back rioters.<br>Riot shields are commonly used for protection from thrown projectiles or blunt/edged weapons, but not firearms. Ballistic shields are commonly known by the brand names "Body Bunker" and "Baker Batshield".<br>The extremely lightweight "Baker Batshield" ballistic shield is popular for police patrol first responders utilizing progressive "Immediate Action Rapid Deployment" (IARD) tactics when approaching high-powered handgun, shotgun or submachine-gun threats.<br>"Body Bunker" ballistic shields are opaque with a small, clear, armored sight window and commonly have a bright light mounted on the frontal surface. Bunker shields are not normally used by riot police, but more often tactical SWAT teams, as they are bulky, heavy, and designed to be used during slow, methodical operations where there is a higher risk of the officers being shot at.<br><br>In short, those shields would have been more than enough for the swords and arrows and other garbage they were up against</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> those shields would have been more than enough for the swords and arrows and other garbage they were up against </br>  <br>Why did the JSDF make her an MP at the Alba FOB again? Wasnt she a mercenary for that invading army?</br>  <br>Agreed,<br>I like the manga version much more<br><br>She's got some that thickness going and her dress looks so much cuter<br><br>The sluttied up anime version is extremely disappointing <br><br>Well I didn't expect anything good in the first place</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did Gainax get away with passing off geometric shapes as monster designs? So fucking lazy, even worse than the last couple episodes which were just random clips thrown together.  <br><br>You are wrong, the fact that the neuroi were simple shapes that made very little sound aside from that strange high pitched noise it made (my imagination came up with an angel singing, actually), stuck with slow and focused movements through the city without destroying anything, and didn't attack outright until the witches appeared made it outright unsettling. This is one of the things that made it interesting an interesting watch because none of the other neuroi we had seen before behaved in this manner.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>holy shit stop</br></br></br></br>  <br>Angels aren't actually humanoid, science says aliens wouldn't be either.
