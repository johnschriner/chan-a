[ We need more furries.  <br>You what now?</br>  I like anime Rori.   Japanese nationalistic bullshit <br>Dropped</br>  <br>Haha   No  </br>   my face when this anime BTFOs all the amerishit posters   6 months of 24/7 gate threads.<br>sounds fun.</br>  <br>Speaking for the manga, America has only been involved in like 3 plot points.</br>   new SAO produced by the A-1 masters themselves <br><br>Picked up.</br></br>  <br>The fun never stops.<br> That means the funposting as well. ;_; </br></br>  <br> infantry rifle melts under normal conditions of fire <br> half the vehicles are derelict (includes armor, planes and logistics) <br> budget issues <br> HAVING TO USE BROOMSTICKS INSTEAD OF RIFLE DURING EXERCISES <br><br>I wasn't exaggerating.

Fictional work <br> Fantasy setting <br> Dragons Elves Magic etc. <br> Nip has good military <br> Out of all these only the Nip military is the one people hate <br><br>Get over yourselves, this isn't a valid complaint.<br>It's not real world, it doesn't fucking matter if they get potrayed as god military.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying anything about that other shit (I've heard plenty of horror stories of Bundeswehr under conscription) but L2's are pretty solid tanks.</br>  <br>The trope for the whole jsdf against fantasy shit is<br>'A big fish (JSDF) in a small pond (Gate world).</br></br>  <br>There already is I just forgot the title. <br><br>It's by Alphapolis and the illustrations are made by the same person who draws Gate novel.</br></br></br>  <br> aohige had confirmed LAST YEAR that there will be a part II of the series from the author's words in the Bunkobon version of book 5, so this wouldn't be news, also, the insertion of a JMSDF officers in a military without a ship is so obvious that of course we will be dealing with ocean exploration later on, remember the official map of the world has a caption (the known land), so basically there will be new continents beyond the ocean for them to discover, since JSDF had not yet to launch a satellite to map the world so this story plot is possible. <br>copied it off animesuki</br></br>  <br>Why does anime Pina Colada look about five years younger and have a 5head?</br>  <br>So are is the Abrams/Leclerc/Merkava/T-90MS, etc<br><br>though my tankfus are the T-72-120 and T-84-120<br> soviet tanks <br> upgraded to modern standards <br> NATO specs <br> Leclerc-style autoloader instead of the original carousel autoloader <br><br>fucking Ukrainians.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   friend can't stop wanking over this Gate manga <br> constantly tells me how awesome it is <br> some medieval fucks being blown the fuck out by tanks and shit <br> finally decided to give it a go <br> expecting good old America kicking some elf ass <br>You can imagine my disappointment and disgust when I found out that proud and noble Americans are actually bad guys and this shit manga is centered on filthy japs instead. <br>Fucking race traitor shits fucks. Saged this shit for America.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>KRAKEN VS SUBMARINES CONFIRMED</br>  <br> QUALITY out the ass. You can clearly see them juggling their budget already and the season just started. <br> Censoring a Seinen and focusing more on the harem. <br> Character design overhauls. <br>The anime won't "BTFO" of anything, friend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>MURICA<br><br>FUCK<br><br>YEAH</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's still shitposting even if you're being ironic.</br></br>    needing more furries ever <br>Fuck this.

Perhaps there even were some nips fighting with us.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> Replying to bait </br></br></br></br></br>  The Americans portrayed are greedy and underhanded, ready and willing to blackmail the Japanese government to satisfy their interests, and use military force if that doesn't work. Of course the Japanese are shown to do the same thing, but what makes it somewhat irksome, is that it indicates that it's okay for Japan to use force if they don't get their way.<br> From TVtropes </br>  How long is the anime gonna be? I wanna see what's her face beat the shit out of the prince get animated.  if you go to monster girl land, MC is not the only one who gets a waifu. Look at this shit. Most of them are better than nearly all of MCs harem, if you want to call it that.  <br>Who is the third male?</br>  <br> One chance for Earth humanity to fuck shit up with the power of unity and show these shitters how we do it without magic. <br> Instead it's just one small island country playing keep away with the rest of the world while their shitty military get to shoot monsters and notRomans by themselves. <br>Sasuga Nippon</br></br></br>  <br>He's the cook.</br>  <br> Ojou <br> Catgirl <br> Bunnygirl (RIP) <br> Bunnygirl <br> Tomboy knight <br> Loli ojou <br>They're all top tier waifus.

And apparently protagonist is hanging with 3 magical underage-looking waifu instead of his real woman. Very offensive!</br>  <br>Honestly that's pretty disgusting<br>No wonder Japs have such a low birthrate when they're constantly lusting after foreign women</br></br>  <br>Nice post, no matter how irrelevant it really is to the topic.</br>  <br>When the hell did the cook catch the eye of the bunny princess?</br>  <br> Honestly that's pretty disgusting </br>  <br>With his cooking skills, naturally.</br>  Is /ak/ not going to pick this up?

You can have an off-duty soldier, a former Green Beret, getting caught up with the Gate invasion in NY while heading to a comic book or Star Wars convention. <br><br>The whole establishing base at Alnus and reaching out to locals can be done the same. <br><br>But then you skip all the baggage in between since once the USAF have mapped the region and pinpointed the capital, they'll just bomb the shit out of it and the story will end rather quickly.</br></br></br></br>   Dragon girl is blue <br>B-But I was expecting delicious brown</br>  <br>If there's one thing I would like turned into an anime, its Band of Brothers.

Hey, it's just like the original series!<br><br>It seems like the latest arc in Black Clover is ending. I'm going to give the series a few more chapters to get entertaining otherwise I'll be knocking it off the list until it does.<br><br>There's still no new series in the English magazine. I don't know if there WILL be at this point. If there is, I hope it's Straighten Up!, because apparently it's doing well right now and should probably last a decent while  Maybe it'll take another month or so for a new series to enter Viz Jump. I remember when Black Clover entered they did like two weeks of multiple chapter releases to catch up.<br><br>If you read Blue Exorcist/Ao no Exorcist, here is a DDL of chapter 69: http://www23.zippyshare.com/v/NtuB5<wbr>1C5/file.html<br>I don't know why you read this, but I won't judge you. To me, it looks pretty dull!<br><br>Boku no Hero Academia <br>Shokugeki no Soma <br>World Trigger </br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So OnS will also be in this thread or nah?</br>  <br>cool cover for a boring spin-off.<br>sarada soap-opera</br></br>  <br>I will make a new thread for it since it's not a WSJ series and it has a lot of fans who would basically just make this an OnS thread.</br>      <br>I'm guessing they're just combining the previous Jump Start with the new group that starts next week in order to decide on what series to add. It's gonna be annoying if they add Straighten Up or Devilyman now though, considering we're going to be more than a month ir two behind at that point though.<br><br>But they have to be adding something new soon since the Naruto short series is over and so is Yu Gi Oh Zexal. I'm guessing they'll announce something at Comic Con? (I hope they add Jojolion as the monthly series myself, although I really really really really really really really really doubt they will since it's mid story and problematic in the naming department like all thr Jojos.)</br></br></br>    Now that it's over please leave /a/ back to your respective home boards  Good fucking idea Naruto: introduce MORE super emo eyeballs that make people go insane into the world. No bloody issues there, surely.  <br>Thanks, it's appreciated</br>   Still posting Black Clover <br><br>You're only hurting yourself, you know.</br></br>  <br>Leave /a/ and return to /a/, huh?</br>  <br> if they add Straighten Up or Devilyman now though, considering we're going to be more than a month ir two behind at that point though. <br>yeah , but they would make triple releases just like they did with BC</br></br>  <br>Hence I'll potentially only be doing it for a short while more.<br><br>You know, it was at least amusing in the early-goings.</br></br></br>  "Is she misunderstanding something? I have no idea why! OBVIOUSLY I'm her mother, there should be no confusion! I only awkwardly hid information from her, had Shizune do the same thing, and explained absolutely nothing. What's the problem?"  screw you  <br>It was. Too bad the author saw the death of his first manga and decided the only way to save his next work was to add more cliches and rip off more successful manga. And it fucking worked.<br><br>That's the Komi principle for you.</br></br></br>  This man is responsible for the deaths of thousands of shinobi, as well as desecrating several well known, powerful ninja with a forbidden technique that stole them away from the afterlife.<br><br>He runs an orphanage and goes unpunished.</br></br>  <br>Nisekoi, awful as it is, was definitely way more entertaining than Black Clover for a pretty long while, even.</br>  <br>That happens a lot.</br>    It's funny that Sarada is, in her eyes, trying to prevent her mother from being cucked again. Really, I'm not being sarcastic. That's legitimately funny.<br><br>It would be way funnier if Sasuke was actually a cheating scumbag though.</br></br>  <br> Cho 'Nuff learns her father's weight loss jutsu <br><br>oh jeez</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair he did essentially get a lobotomy from Kishi's self-insert via eye magic mindrape.</br>  <br>Are you the guy who posts the author comments?</br>    <br>hownew.ru</br>  If I were Itachi, I'd be so creeped out my how misappropriated this gesture has become.<br><br>Means: brotherly love, lust, motherly love, and fatherly love<br>the lust one really tears it<br><br>At least Salad's still pretty cute.<br><br><br>I think I am one of the guys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>booooo</br>  <br>Truly the expression of a happy, reformed family man.</br>  <br>Post em.</br>  This is not funny. Like, I don't see how this is even supposed to be a little bit humorous. Sasuke is so fucked up, and Sakura's worse for sticking with him. It's a wonder they actually fucked. A miracle, even. I have to imagine alcohol was involved in Salad's conception. A lot of hard alcohol.  <br>But even that would take a while at this point. Black Clover's Jump Start ended in Issue 14 and started as a normal series in Issue 19. Straighten Up eneded in issue 26 and Devilyman ended in issue 28, and we're on issue 32 now. If they're up against the next group then depending on the number of new series we might be waiting another 6 weeks at least. That's over 4 weeks of triple chapters to catch up on Straighten Up at that point.</br>    <br>So after the movie this franchise is finally over right? It'll finally be done?</br>  <br> A lot of hard alcohol. <br><br>That's Naruto for you. <br><br>I'm sorta glad Kishimoto is retiring from drawing manga after the movie. I have the feeling any other series he would make would be just as bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  If you're gonna be Hokage you'd better stop fighting like your mom. She was shit and her mentor was possibly the worst hokage in history. Okay, maybe that title belongs to Sarutobi but she was still pretty useless.<br><br>And yeah, here's the reveal that this entire Gaiden was pretty much pointless. If Suigetsu had never done that "reveal" of Karin being Salad's mother, I think this would be a much better gaiden overall.</br></br>  <br>No please ;_;</br>  <br> he think it's over </br>  <br>that's no problem BC had 3 weeks of triple chapters iirc</br>  <br>It will never be over, no. Even when Kishimoto retires, you bet your bottom Studio Pierrot and WSJ will try to make a new series about Boruto a la Dragonball GT.<br><br>And we'll all say it'll be horrible and we'll watch it anyway and we'll cry.</br></br></br>  Do you think in the movie Salad even knows that Sakura is her real mom? I don't.<br><br><br>There will probably be an anime based on the new generation, thus everyone can just ignore that seeing as Naruto original content/filler is some of the worst, but I think Kishimoto is thankfully done.</br></br></br>  <br>He's going to make a samurai manga where every character and plot point is an homage to Naruto.</br>  Fuck this awful family.<br><br>DDL for this chapter: http://www23.zippyshare.com/v/rbdNV<wbr>mkc/file.html<br>DDL for the Gaiden: http://www23.zippyshare.com/v/YKC6s<wbr>rPZ/file.html</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>She probably got the truth from her mom afterward. Keeping it a secret after all of this is just plain retarded.<br><br>But again, that's Naruto for you.</br></br></br>  <br>Sarada a cute</br>  Author Comments<br/>  <br><br>Didn't he say he'll make some announcement after the Bolt film airs?<br>Hopefully he'll sign the rights over to someone competent or lets Studio Pierot make Nardo GT while he sits back and couts his money. <br>The man is burned out as fuck and bereft of ideas besides the same shit he's been doing for years on end. He had a shot at doing something smalltime and fun with the newly graduated kids, but he just made more Uchiha melodrama, set up one interesting thing but didn't take it anywhere and had a big bad evil guy covered in fucking sharingans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br> No. </br></br></br>  <br> Komi buys Fire Emblem If <br><br>There's a joke I can make here, but I just can't think of one.</br></br></br>  <br>Komi probably bought the easy-as-fuck version too.</br>  <br>No, it was 2 weeks. Chapter 4 in the issue it was added as a normal series, 5-7 in the next, 8-10 in the third, and then 1 weekly as normal.</br>  THIS SHIT<br><br>Nah, I'll be honest: this chapter doesn't make me too mad. You'll see why soon.</br></br>  Last time: our hero shot out a wave of FRIENDSHIP (I wish I was joking) at the enemy by swinging a sword he received via deus ex machina.<br><br>Now, the wave collides!</br></br>  <br>I actually liked this chapter. We may see it change into more than just a Naruto/Fairy Tail copy.</br>    <br> that Salad laugh <br>Where have I seen that before?</br></br>  HAHAHAHAHA    <br> what is artificial insemination </br>    <br> Ma <br> Da <br> Ra <br><br> Sa <br> Ra <br> Da <br><br>Think about it, turning a Ma into a Sa and switching the Ra with the Da seals the deal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck was the Scarlet Spring?</br>    <br>Sarada's first period. That's why she was so angry and moody during the whole thing.</br>  <br>Salad's first dressing in the form of period</br>    <br> A sword that nullifies magic actually has the power to copy magic <br><br>GEE<br><br>I SURE LOVE THIS TOTALLY ORIGINAL IDEA</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Until proven otherwise I'm just going with the explanation that he put aside his disgust, somehow got hard and jerked off, then handed Pinkshit a full vial, told her to make it work and went to his separate bedroom before once more departing in the morning for his walkabout.</br>  This was actually foreshadowed.<br><br>Also, it's a loli.<br><br>I have been double appeased.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No need to be Itachi, it really is a bit creepy. Cute when you don't overthink it, but for so long it was used as a gesture between brothers everytime itachi postponed spending time with sasuke, when he uses with sakura and now sarada it's hard seeing in any other light.</br></br>    <br>It's a different sword, dumbass. He has two now.</br>  <br>Shota Jun a cute</br>  neat  <br>You act as if Black Clover hasn't already shamelessly plagiarized countless shonen series.</br>  <br>Fuck. The powerlevel escalation has begun. Anyway, this almost looks like a parody of a shounen series with how literally it paints by the numbers.</br>  <br>Doctor Sivana?</br>  <br>You act as if you didn't even read it.</br>  <br>The concept is still there. A person unable to use magic can first nullify it, then copy it completely.<br><br><br>A loli fairy? Where could he have gotten THAT idea, I wonder...</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the last chapter we saw it nullifying Zabuza's magic before he sent out a wave. He was slicing up those ice/diamond/whatever shards, just faster.</br>  <br>I have and I can guarantee I've read a lot more manga than you.<br>It literally is just Naruto+Fairy Tail+Magi.<br>Plus a littany of other series.<br>Do you entirely lack reading comprehension?</br></br></br></br>  So, alright, let's try to understand this shit here.<br><br>A grimoire in Black Clover is kind of like the spellbooks in Zatch Bell. More spells are unlocked as you improve. Except, you can also add new spells from outside sources, like scrolls and artifacts. Asta got a new sword here, so I imagine if he dives into more Magi dungeons, he will get more swords.<br><br>It's still bullshit that this is an anti-magic sword. I'm still not sure how that sorting grimoire ceremony was supposed to work either. Do the grimoires manifest right there for their wizards/witches, or was it the motherfucking coincidence of all coincidence that the 4 and 5 leaf clover books happened to be in a small town's grimoire tower?<br><br>In any case, anti-magic seems to be a shock to several veteran wizards in this world so the existence of several swords of anti-magic is pretty much bullshit. The only way to rationalize it is that there used to be a fair amount of/at least one very powerful anti-mage(s) that had anti-magic sword, but they're so ancient everyone forgot about them.<br><br>Wait, how does an anti magic sword borrow magic? Friendship sure is something!<br><br>Jesus fucking Christ, I think about this series too much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This art feels like a mix of Claymore and Berserk.<br>Series any good or typical shounen shit? Getting mixxed messages</br></br></br>    <br>If you had read it then you would know that he picked up a new sword like 3 chapters ago.</br>  And so, the arc begins to end.<br><br>An improvement over the last few chapters, but I don't think I'd really call this entertaining yet.</br></br>  BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS!  <br>Okay autist-chan, let me make it simple for you.<br>It doesn't matter that he got a new sword. What matters is that AS A WHOLE this series is a plagerism fest. <br>It's not simply generic like My Hero Academia or Seven Deadly Sins (yes, I know it's not Jump but it's still a popular generic battle shonen) but it outright steals from other series without any attempt at making things its own.<br>It's an objectively bad series and one of the worst popular series I've ever read in Jump.</br></br></br></br>  <br> girls can be friends too <br> really thinks of sakura as her friend <br><br>ayyyyyy<br><br>but cheer up karin, you totally avoided two bullets. sasuke and sakura only deserve each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Correct me if I'm wrong but the grimoires seem like the most original concept this manga has come up with so far. I can't think of what they may have been ripped off from.</br>  <br>Posting Seraph of the End over yonder<br/></br>  <br> really thinks of sakura as her friend <br> meanwhile Pink plasters over her face and doesn't tell her daughter shit about the woman who delivered her  <br> then scolds Salad for asking perfectly logical questions when she was the one who flew off the handle and broke the house and fainted <br>Sakura never ceases to amaze.</br></br></br></br>   Precure thread   I want to pafu Pafu's pafus.  <br>that's perf</br>  Kirara still has the best henshin, to be honest.    Next episode summary from the official website http://asahi.jp/precure/princess/st<wbr>ory/ <br> Towa transformed into Cure Scarlet and was reborn as a Precure. <br> However, there's no smile on her face. <br><br> To cheer her up, Haruka and the others bring her to the city.  <br> Shopping together, eating donuts together! <br> Towa smiles appears for a moment, but it's soon gone. <br><br> Apparently, she thinks that since she hurt so many people, she can't enjoy her time with everyone else... <br><br> Then, she chooses to disappear. <br> Resolved to live on her own, she wanders the city. <br> However everything is different here from how things were in the Hope Kingdom. <br><br> Towa understands that she can't do anything on her own, and feels depressed. <br> Right then, somebody calls her: &lt;Young lady&gt;... <br><br>From the way she was called (Ojou-san) it's probably an adult.

To tell you the truth, I got into this industry (the VA one) because I wanted to play a villain in Sunday Morning shows like Toku and Precure. I wanted to be like Soga Machiko (Bandora/Rita Repulsa). Since, when I was in elementary school, during the art festival I also played the role of a witch. Considering all that, I was extremely happy to voice a villain! So at first I just forgot about the "become a precure" part and thought &lt;Let's fight the precure with all myself!&gt;. And then, after playing the part in which she transforms into Cure Scarlet, I realized &lt;To be able to play both the villain and the heroine, this must be my dream role!&gt;. Acting the Precure part is what I'll do now, and I'll give it my best. <br><br> Tell us about Towa, and if you feel any point of connection with your character. <br> S: I think that among the 4, she is the one I resemble the most. It's more like a process of elimination, but I think we might share the point of being too serious for our own good.I think that we could both grow up if we toned that "too serious" part down a bit. <br> Also, and this is not something I noticed myself, it seems like I'm a bit careless. The people around me often tell me "you've got it together!", but people who really know me go "no way!". Towa also doesn't realize this, but her reactions are a bit off at times *laughs*. <br><br> How does your acting differs between Twilight and Towa? <br> S: Since Twilight was brainwashed by Dyspear, I acted her part as a completely different person. However, I also tried to get the feeling across that her nobleness, her unwillingness to admit defeat and her core strength, which is slightly different from Flora's, permeate the character of Towa too. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(Part 2/2)<br> Please tell us some anecdote from the recording sessions. <br> S: Getting our 4 voices together for the transformation sequence was hard. The staff wanted an absolutely perfect match. Even when I thought it came out ok, we ended up redoing it a lot. Even when checking both the time and the animation, a difference of one heartbeat meant a mismatch, so we ended up watching Shimamura's (Cure Flora) lips to get it perfectly. <br><br> What do you think is the appeal of Precure? <br> S: I always think it's amazing seeing girls fighting with full force and barehanded. Fighting your enemies in close combat, what tough girls they are! Also, having come to know the staff, I really felt the passion that is in the staff which run this show for 12 years. Being part of it now makes me extremely happy. <br><br> Anything we should look forward to, or a message to the viewers? <br> S: Towa has gone from Twilight, a villain to a red and pink Cure Scarlet. There's already a pink, Cure Flora, and she got red too, a color combination which no doubt stands out. It's cute that it's like her inability to read the situation. That said, having finally acquired friends, a main point of the plot will be to see how she changes and matures. Also, reuniting with her brother is her dream, and saving the Hope Kingdom is her duty. I will surely be happy if you watch over her in her future endeavors. Thank you! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have to marry Aguri now.      I'm going to marry Haruharu!  <br>sasuga</br>  <br> I always think it's amazing seeing girls fighting with full force and barehanded. <br>One of us, one of us.</br></br>  <br>What's this?</br>  <br>Cure seiyuu list, age when they started a character and their current age.</br>    <br> That feel when the Seiyuu closest to you in age are Diamond's and Honey's. </br>  <br><br> To be able to play both the villain and the heroine, this must be my dream role! <br> I really felt the passion that is in the staff which run this show for 12 years. <br>Reading about staff enjoying what they do always give a good feeling.<br>I always end up liking more a series when I know things like this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>really? It just lacks any creativity</br>  <br>http://myanimelist.net/people/6634/<wbr>Kotobuki_Minako<br>She's accomplished more than you ever will.</br></wbr></br>  <br>why those faces are always blured?</br>  <br>I'm surprised Karen seiyuu wasn't older. Only 31? She sounded like an old lady.</br>  <br>And GoPri is one of the, if not the, best series for that since FW.</br>  <br>Because everyone always moves around really quickly at these events.</br>  <br>even that right hand that is taking photo?</br>  <br> Even when checking both the time and the animation, a difference of one heartbeat meant a mismatch, so we ended up watching Shimamura's (Cure Flora) lips to get it perfectly. <br>Damn that's some impressive</br></br>  <br> Not realizing I was talking about fuckability. <br>Nice job pointing out the obvious.</br></br>  <br>privacy issues. Non-performers and sometimes even the announcer have their faces blurred or otherwise obscured.</br>  <br>What does age have to do with fuckability?<br>More importantly, why would you want to fuck a seiyuu?</br></br>  <br>Yes, of course. Everyone.</br>  <br>Oh shit, she was Mugi.</br>  <br>Nobody wants to fuck someone who is old as fuck and why wouldn't you want to fuck a seiyuu and have them talk dirty in that character's voice in bed?</br>  <br/>    <br>Some of the worst fanfiction I've read.</br>    Official Towa profile from http://sp.asahi.jp/program/precurep<wbr>rincess/chara/chara_04.php<br> A first year at the Noble Academy middle school. <br> A refined and hardworking girl. Prince Kanata's sister and a Princess of the Hope kingdom. <br> She was abducted by the Witch of Despair Dyspear when she was but a child and was raised by her as Twilight, but regained her former self thanks to the power of the Precures. <br> She loves playing the violin, and wants to play with her brother. Her dream is to become a Grand Princess. <br> She transforms into the Flame Princess, Cure Scarlet <br><br> Birthday: December the 15th <br><br> Likes: playing the violin, anmitsu <br><br> Catchphrase: The Princess of the Deep Crimson (or Scarlet) flame, Cure Scarlet! <br><br>Also staff spoilers (no picture provided) for episode 23:<br> Script: Koumura Junko; Storyboard: Kuroda Narumi; Direction: Iwai Takao </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>you just don't want to believe</br>  <br>and she got married half year later</br>  <br>How tall are the GoPris?</br>  <br> She loves playing the violin, and wants to play with her brother. Her dream is to become a Grand Princess. <br>I'm afraid there can be just one grand princess and that is</br></br>  Is Scarlet a pink or red cure?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>She's purple.</br>  <br>He was totally at Toei but here's a picture of a subway ad. He recognized her as Mana (not her, despite later saying he knows her) despite her speaking voice sounding nothing like Mana. She goes around looking for ads and strikes up conversation with random strangers to invite on dates. Fucking "Will I ever see you again" to someone she just met on the street with minimal conversation whose only connection is a foreign adult who watches a kid's cartoon. He would have totally hung out with her too he was just too busy, even though he apparently formed such a strong connection with her that she would be willing to date him but not get his phone or email?</br>  <br>That's just how thirsty she was.</br>  <br>That's fast.</br>  <br><br><br> I want those plushes </br></br></br>  <br>So if I'm understanding correctly both Towa and Haruka are 12/13 in the 7th grade, Kirara is 13/14 in 8th grade and Minami is 14/15 in 9th grade? I know that Towa and Haruka are 1st years and that Kirara is a 2nd year but I can't remember if Minami is a 2nd or 3rd year.</br>  <br>Kirara is a first year too, isn't she?<br>She got into the school at the same time as Haruka. Minami is a second year, I'm pretty sure.</br></br>  <br>I want to fuck that cardboard cutout of Cure Honey</br>  <br>Kirara is definitely a first year along with Haruka, but I'm not sure what year Minami is, I can't remember them ever saying.<br><br>She's been in Nobra for at least one year and she doesn't refer to Ranko as sempai, but I'm not sure if that means anything.</br></br></br>  <br>  and she doesn't refer to Ranko as sempai, but I'm not sure if that means anything. <br>That definitely means something, good job spotting that.</br></br>  <br> she doesn't refer to Ranko as sempai, but I'm not sure if that means anything <br>Minamin confirmed for disrespectful upstart.</br></br>  <br><br>Here's her profile page <br>http://sp.asahi.jp/program/precurep<wbr>rincess/chara/chara_03.php<br>『ノーブル学園』２年生の生徒会長。<br>容姿端麗、成績優秀、スポーツ万能ゆえ「学園のプリンセス」と呼ばれている<wbr>。<br><br>責任感が強いため、時にきびしくみられることもあるけど、本当は思いやりが<wbr>あってとても優しい、はるかたちより一つ上の上級生。<br><br>海のプリンセス『キュアマーメイド』に変身。<br><br>●誕生日<br>7月20日<br><br>●好きなもの<br>海、紅茶<br><br>●名乗り<br>澄みわたる海のプリンセス！キュアマーメイド！<br><br>声:浅野 真澄（あさの　ますみ）</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  It would be pretty sad to think that they would only be together for one year, if Minamin were a third year.  <br>do people really expect that I know japanese language?</br>  <br>Right, so she's a second year. I was right.</br>  <br>She's a second year then. And she likes black tea besides the sea.</br>  <br>isn't it black coffee?</br>  <br>That would be ブラックコーヒー.</br>  <br><br><br>Based Sawashiro.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It sounds like Towa will be more than a simple Ellen 2.0/Setsuna 3.0 with an ojou-sama coat of paint. She seems like she'll be hard-working and determined to save her homeworld and won't spend much time dwelling on her past sins, since she came to terms with them and plans to atone for them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Ah so I was off. Everyone but Minami is 12 at the youngest, 13 at the oldest with Minami being 13 at the youngest and 14 and the oldest. Poor Minami,she must be lonely since she wouldn't be in any classes with the others.</br></br></br></br></br>  Cure Scarlet looks a lot better in motion. I remember thinking her outfit looked retarded in the concept art but it is pretty cool after all.  <br><br>Maybe Towa will end up in her class.</br></br>  <br>Towa's also a 1st year though so that's not likely. Minami is the only second year.</br>  <br>I mean, that makes it sound like Ellen &amp; Setsuna are just cardboard cutouts with no substance of their own and I'm not sure that's entirely fair. More than anything though, it really depends on how things go in the late game. Ellen and Setsuna both took a back seat to their pink despite having what should have been a huge emotional stake in the final battle, though at least Setsuna got to have her final confrontation with Westar. We'll see how they follow through with Towa.</br>  <br><br>I didn't mean to imply that, sorry. It's just that Setsuna's story shouldn't be copied for a third time like it sort of was with Ellen.<br><br>I thought she stayed relevant to the very end, though. She had her solo confrontation with Northa, she explained to the others what Labyrinth's goals were on screen, and she even got a moment with Moebius all to herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Setsuna has died for her sins tho.</br>  <br>Fresh had a decent enough final battle considering it was not PINK PINK PINK PINK PINK. That Setsuna did not completely overshadow and suck-up everything, despite the fight being the most personal to her, was actually a good thing as well.<br><br>Just because everyone and everything doesn't resolve around a certain character doesn't mean the character is irrelevant.<br><br><br>I wonder how many more Setsuna rehashes we will have to go through so we can get a Setsuna rehash that is actually as good as Setsuna itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So is it true that GoPri is actually doing well sales-wise and that's because they are trying to aim to little kids again after failure by attempting to go for older demographics?  <br> by attempting to go for older demographics? <br>like when recently</br></br>  <br>I think they're pleasing the big friends just fine.</br>  <br>I don't know about the latter, but I have heard that GoPri sales have been great so far, not that I have the numbers or anything to back that.</br>  <br>What makes you say that?</br>  <br>http://prehyou.blog.so-net.ne.jp/so<wbr>ukai2015<br><br>Supposedly, according to this place both things you said are correct. Would be nice if the moonspeakers from here could verify though. I don't trust translations from outside /pc/</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>I don't know where you heard that but it doesn't seem to be grounded in reality. As you can see in the bottom chart, it sold poorly.<br><br>TV ratings on the other hand have little to do with toy sales, which is the main source of revenue.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know that every TV series is affected by this decline, right?<br>Even little girls use internet to see their anime nowadays, TV raiting isn't that important anymore.</br></br>  precure is ded  <br><br><br>Speaking of ratings, I wonder if Super airing right after GoPri affected the ratings in some way.</br></br></br>  /pc/ sexualization and statistics  <br><br>It's on a different channel, so it couldn't really matter.</br></br>  <br>It does matter. For example, people could have changed channel from Asahi to Fuji midway through GoPri so that they wouldn't miss even a single minute of Super's airtime.</br>  you guys realize that you can't directly compare the total sales of a show that has finished already with one that isn't even halfway through, right? I mean, you can, but you have to take that into account.  <br><br>Please don't sexualize the statistics.</br></br>  <br> Supposedly, according to this place both things you said are correct.  <br>It does say that they tried to widen the audience range before (Doki and HaCha) and since it failed, they are now going back to 4-6 years old. And it also says that 46% (of the tv ratings I assume) came from the intended target which is good. It goes on to say however that the ratings weren't their main concern.<br>Just to put things into perspective, the page opens up with "Next year there will be Precure too" and finishes with "Toei said that, rating fluctuations notwithstanding, Precure will go on". Precure is doing so badly, that people were actually concerned that the franchise would be terminated. <br>Actual toy sales are here <br><br>That's why all the graphics are divided in quarters and the likes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's like saying we can't compare GoPri with any other series because GoPri it's not over yet. Of course, we can't compare GoPri finale with HaCha's because GoPri's finale doesn't fucking exist yet, that would be silly. But we can easily talk about what we have so far and compare it to to the equivalent point of the other series. For example, we can talk about the first quarter sales which are the only certain numbers we have so far as shown </br>  <br>Thighs. Thighs everywhere.</br>  <br> Kirara in charge of having good animation <br>Such is life as the support Cure.</br></br>  <br>She'll get her very own sakuga one day</br>  <br>Did that last image actually happen</br>  Is it a pentagram?<br>DROPPED</br>  <br>I don't think Towa's story outright copies Setsuna's. It's just the same basic idea.<br><br>And it is a sort of mix I think - there's a little of Ace thrown in for good measure as Towa is essentially a new character for the viewers (she's obviously not Twilight) but she's not new story wise. And a good justification for such change is already given - and the revelations about her were not occuring neither too fast neither too slow or left for much later episodes.<br>I actually think that so far this may be the best midseason "switch to good" arc. It was extremely easy to make everything go to hell and make her switch a complete asspull but everything worked out in the end. Arc was predictable in general (duh, Twilight's switch to good was called since she appeared in the opening) but details and writing really make up for it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Support Cures are always the best.</br>  <br>Hopefully this means Saban will never taint this.</br>  <br>actually it looks like more complicated glyph</br>   That Kirara QUALITY bust   <br>If you like support cures you are a beta faggot who's too scared of being overshadowed by your partner in bed so you want a passive dead fish in bed to soothe your low confidence.<br><br>A real man likes bruiser Cures like Haruka because they enjoy a challenge in bed that ends up in more pleasurable, even if rougher and a more challenging act.</br></br></br>  <br> and the revelations about her were not occuring neither too fast neither too slow or left for much later episodes. <br>It happened in the two episodes leading up to her conversion. If this isn't too fast, I don't know what is. They should have introduced her on episode 1, no excuses for that.</br></br>  <br>If you didn't realize by now, that is her shoulder.</br>  <br>This. Twilight definitively has the worst build-up of all the villain to cure-characters so far.</br>  <br>So she has a shoulder in the middle of her chest? I realize the one on the left is her shoulder but then she only has one boob?</br>  <br>I'm literally staring at her boob adn tring to figure out the other one.

You should be used to this by now. Keep wishing goodness for Ashihara's well-being.<br><br>Secondly: the official translation of the sixth tankouban of World Trigger will be out TOMORROW which kinda twists my buns. If it was today, I would've posted the cover and omake pages in this thread.<br><br>If you guys keep this thread up until Tuesday, that might still be a possibility! Do what you want, though.<br><br>In the meantime, I did some sniffing about and found a cool little interview Viz did with Ashihara last year so I'll share that in this thread. It's a good interview, I think.<br><br>Now then: Touma.<br><br>Boku no Hero Academia <br>Shokugeki no Soma </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I do believe somebody's gaining a crush.    !!<br><br> That's the sniper who allegedly stole triggers and gave them to Chika's brother, Rinji, then fucked off to the Neighborhood. </br></br>      !!!<br><br>That's Chika's issue. Now it makes sense why Ninomiya could call her out on that little problem at the end of the last Rank Battle.</br></br>  So this makes me think that, like Osamu, Chika may have "faults" but she can still be useful.<br><br>However it's troubling that a potential "away team" status can be revoked from Tamakoma-2 if the top brass learns she doesn't want to shoot people.</br></br>  These two are cuties.  In case you're wondering, overall Yuuma lost against Ko here.<br><br>I like that these characters can still fluctuate in wins/losses since it's not really about "power level".</br></br>  <br>That "i fucked up" what.<br><br>Is Yuma having a new love rival?</br></br></br>    <br>6-9, huh? Damn.</br>      Nice, didnt know its the usual time you dump the chapters.  So, it's a side effect of either reading comms or reading minds.<br><br>I'm guessing minds, I can't see why a side effect would be born for such a specific purpose as reading communications. At first I thought he had Kikuchihara's side effect of "super hearing", which might've been cool, but I guess not.<br><br><br>Seems like it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For reference, Viz usually releases around 12:30-2pm EST. Rarely they'll release much earlier. It's a little inconsistent.</br>  <br>Thats what I like WT, they prepare AND further formulate strategy in battle and MOTHERFUCKING TEAMWORK the fuck out of their opponent.</br>  ara  Oh wow the new guy doesn't look like a robot  <br>Well I'm guessing it's the mind seeing as that how they talk to each with the coms right? Unless he has a ability that deals with technology all together which would be cool</br>  Man, they must've tripped REALLY hard to be knocked out of their combat bodies.  Hard to believe that qt shota sniper is a part of this crazy motherfucker's squad.<br><br>For now, I hope to see this series back in Jump in two weeks.<br><br>I will now dump Black Clover and Naruto Gaiden in another thread before I post that interview. I may also dump Seraph of the End before that, I don't know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> will be off next week <br>Aw fuck, remind me again what health issue the author experiencing? Its either neck or wrist issue I read before. Thanks for the dump anon, I appreciate it.</br></br>  <br><br> World Trigger will be off next week <br>Is this real life?</br></br></br>  Ema and Kageura got some fanart on Pixiv.  <br>Can you upload new chapters of WT and BNHA on madokami or something? I download and read shit on my tablet and reading in a browser sucks and Fallen Angels' and Readmangatoday's translations are unreadable.  please ;_; </br>    <br>there is a mega-folder, search it in the archive.</br>  Yuzuru a cute  I wonder who the third ranked attacker is  <br>WELP</br>  <br>Jin</br>  <br>Im betting he´ll actually end up being a fairly decent guy even if very hot blooded. Exactly the opposite to Ninomiya.</br>  <br>Did Jin rank up that fast? He started over last time I checked</br>  <br><br>Naruto Gaiden, Black Clover, Blue Exorcist DDL <br><br><br>There's a link in the archive if you do some digging. I won't upload official releases to madokami because that seems incredibly dangerous. On that note, definitely don't upload these chapters anywhere a lot of people could notice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And then he meets Osamu and is like<br> T-Think about m-me Osamu-s-senpai~&lt;3 <br>I mean, he only needs to be in a little bit trouble and the masked hero, Sweaty Glasses, will come and save him!</br></br></br>  <br>I don' think Ninomiya is a bad guy. He's hard on Osamu and Chika because Hatohara screwed him over pulling the same passive bullshit.</br>  Do we know the third member of Kageura's team?  <br>no.</br>  <br>Nope, but we know that the third one is a shooter and should be a very good one. All the members of A-class teams seems to be very competent, they dont rely so much in the ace member Ko´s one, Tamakoma-2 or Team Nasu more or less.</br>  <br><br>found it thanks</br></br>  <br>that's the point it would show how OP he is</br>  <br><br><br>I can't decide which one I like better<br><br>Why do they both have to be talented fluffy haired shotas?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stick with Yuma.</br>  <br>Whoa,and I thought Zebra hated shit talkers.</br>  <br>One won't break your heart when he eventually dies</br>  <br>Fucking hell Japan</br>  <br><br><br>Let's face it Yuma and Chika don't have any chemistry and except for the beginning they didn't had any moments.</br></br></br>  Anyone heard of a Shuueisha editor by the name of Saito?  <br>Is not that they don't have chemistry, is just that the author hasn't made them interact directly since the invasion arc</br>     Teekyuu day <br> no Teekyuu thread </br>  Will it even air on mondays?  pink lewd a best  <br>According to anichart, it aired an hour ago, and it's marked as started on MAL, so I guess it's happening.<br>Now we wait for HS or Commie.</br></br>  WHO HYPE FOR QUNKA QUNKA?

But Arc-V splits the series into different, alternate dimensions. The Fusion Dimension is based off of Gx and Synchro is based off of 5D's and so on</br>  <br>"Zuzu".<br> it's RURI</br></br>  <br>The events in the movie were mentioned in the Ark Cradle arc<br><br><br>Yes it is you dumb fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch Ruri be called Suri or worse, Siri.</br>  <br> Implying 5ds is actually directly related to Synchro Dimension <br> Not seeing this is a homage and not hardline continuing continuity. </br></br>  <br>Are they serious?<br><br>Do they actually think kids enjoy this?

In no way did I imply that. I literally said <br> Synchro is based off of 5D's </br></br>  <br>This isn't too different from the first episode in japanese.

Anyway, ill continue to think that DM/GX/5Ds have same timeline and dimension until they say it's wrong in Arc V.</br>  <br> muh headcanon </br>  <br>It's already wrong. In the Synchro Dimension, nobody knew what the fuck Fusion Summoning was which is why Roger tried to arrest Serena<br><br>Fuck off with your idiocy</br></br></br>    <br>Maybe because DM/GX was a long time ago? So everybody forgot what fusion summoned is. <br>If 5Ds movie is canon, Yugi Jaden and Yusei are from same timeline and dimension. If it's wrong, the movie isn't canon.</br></br>  <br>But in 5D's Jack used Fusion Summoning<br><br>The movie is canon. Get the fuck out. Please.</br></br></br>  <br> So everybody forgot what fusion summoned is. </br>    <br>You are right that DM/GX/5Ds have the same timeline and dimension.<br><br>Here is where you are absolutely wrong: ARC-V is in a different dimension than DM/GX/5Ds/Zexal. Its stupid to assume that Fusion Dimension is any continuation of GX, Synchro to 5Ds, or Xyz to Zexal.<br><br><br> 5Ds movie IS canon <br> DM, GX and 5Ds ARE in the same dimension since Satellite was Domino City destroyed by Zero Reverse, and Judai met Yugi in episode 1. <br> ARC-V is completely separate to the past series. <br> Meaning that what took place in GX does not apply to Fusion Dimension, 5Ds to Synchro or Zexal Xyz. <br><br>Now this is my "headcanon": DM, GX, 5Ds and Zexal are Dimension 1. Standard Dimension is Dimension 2, Fusion Dimension is Dimension 3, Synchro Dimension is Dimension 4, Xyz Dimension is Dimension 5.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   :^)   <br><br>Ok, I didn't see 5Ds.<br>So why that dude said <br> In the Synchro Dimension, nobody knew what the fuck Fusion Summoning was which is why Roger tried to arrest Serena </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Synchro isn't 5D's.</br>  <br>Because the Synchro Dimension isn't 5D's. It's BASED off of 5D's. <br><br>You can't be this dense, you just can't.</br></br></br>  <br> Ok, I didn't see 5Ds. </br>  <br>Well, thanks for giving me a real answer with arguments.</br>  <br>I dunno, the subpar VA work for most of the characters and the fact that their substitute for the original OST isn't even used competently just makes everything feel pretty pale in comparison. I never planned on watching past episode 2 of the dub, though.</br>  <br>Everyone else gave you real answers, faggot.</br>  <br>I don't get the "based of" before this answer. Probably cause i didn't see 5Ds. Arc V is the first yugioh serie I watch. I saw GX and DM 4kis translate version when I was young, but not 5Ds and ZeXal.</br>  <br> thinking you deserve arguments handed to you on a platter <br>Back in my day, we had to work for years in the mines to get our arguments. It was horrible, there were folks with miner's lung and blindness everywhere, and when the full moon came out, they turned into werewolves!</br></br>  <br>man just watch 5ds and stop shitting up this threat so hard. hell it will even be fun for you with the bonus for us that you are gone for a bit till you can actually talk about shit.</br>  <br>I can't tell which OP I liked the least between Dualism and Wondah Wings</br>  <br>I'm willing to give them until 7.

Does that mean while Jaden is in Venice, Domino City was destroyed?</br></br>  <br>I just realized, how are they going to do the "Yugo = Yuugo" joke? Because that mixup is basically responsible for the antagonism between Yuugo and Yuuto kek</br>  <br>The real reason that Yugo and Yugo fought each other was that they thought the other was Yuri who kidnapped Ruri/Rin.<br>Also makes me wonder if Yuto treated Ruri like a princess whenever they met up with each other?</br></br>  <br>Is that a reverse trap Yuya?</br>  <br>When facing someone like Yuto, Yugo will just get called "the Fusion lackey" or "Duel Academy pawn" or something. Meanwhile, when Yuzu gets his name wrong, she'll say something like "Hugo". It'll be kind of split into two like that - enemies will use the association with Fusion to piss him off, while friends will just fuck up his name, which pisses him off too.</br>  <br> Yuto treated Ruri like a princess whenever they met up with each other? <br>Yuuto probably treated everyone he personally knew like a princess. Super softy on the inside.</br></br>  <br>Based on how he acted towards Yuzu, probably.<br> yfw you will never have a gloomy knight-kun of your own </br></br>  <br>M-m'lady...<br>*drops SILENTO BOOTS*</br></br>  <br> no Yuuto knight to make me feel safe <br> no obsessive Yuuya to make me feel loved <br> no spontaneous Yuugo to make me laugh <br> no rape face Yuuri to scare me to death <br>Living, why do I do it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's ok, anon.

Besides, his mind was stuck on Rin.</br>  <br>He's commons, murdering people is like breakfast for that filth.</br>   Ruri will never tip her fedora at you <br>Why live</br>  <br> you will never teach Ruri about the simple things in life </br>  Why doesn't Yuya use defusion to kick Yuto out?  <br>Because he Overlaid with Yuto, not Fused. It's going to require Xyz Encore, but that's a TCG-only card.</br>  <br> Shun finally saves Ruri <br> Ignores Shun other than a hello and hugs Yuya <br> I knew you'd come save me! <br> Yuya stutters that he isn't Yuto. <br> Shun confirms it. <br> "Stop messing with me, You two!" <br> Yuya looks at the ground. <br> "Where's Yuto?" <br> "Why isn't Yuto here?!" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never considered the possibility that Ruri had feelings for Yuuto.<br> My heart :( </br></br>  <br> never considered the possibility <br>Yuto is crushable as hell.

I only watched the german dub, which had its own version.  <br>from the wiki<br>Note that in the English version of Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, when Yami Marik attempted to gain control of "Ra" in his Duel with Mai, the viewer can hear him speaking understandable words. However, in the Japanese version of Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga, what he recited was the Hieratic Text itself (in the anime, Marik recites some unknown words; in the manga, his speech bubbles are filled with Hieratic Text).<br><br>Since we dont know what egyptian sounds like its a compromise</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to the Japanese version of the anime and manga, the Hieratic Text printed on the card records the following three groups of Ra's abilities (quoted from Kaiba's own translation of the text in Duel 248 of the Japanese manga).<br><br>When (roughly) translated to English, it reads: <br>(1st ability) "Ra shall acquire the power of three tributes. However, only those who offer the ancient incantation to heaven shall God follow."<br>(2nd ability) "God shall revive from earth. By offering the Ritual of Revival and his own life, one shall be united with God, and all enemies on the battlefield shall be incinerated."<br>(3rd ability) "In an instant, God shall become a Phoenix, and all evil spirits chosen by it shall repose on earth."<br><br>The Summon chants that Marik and later Atem would use were based on Hieratic speech. So yes, it was gibberish.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i hope there is a doujin of him &amp; fem yuya enjoying a private duel ;^)</br>  <br>Yugo, please. We all know you're not lasting past this arc, you should really just start coming to terms with it.</br>  <br><br>Too bad. The german version was chuuni as fuck. I loved it. Kinda a predecessor of the current ones.</br></br>  <br> mfw if Yugo does survive the arc, it'll be all in his mind and he'll go through the stages of grief <br> denial - lasting the arc seemingly intact and seeing nothing wrong <br> anger - dropping motherfuckers left and right, regardless of their alignment <br> bargaining - striking deals with anybody who can keep him afloat long enough to find muh Rin <br> depression - realising he may never find muh Rin, and taking on Yuto's sad eyes and getting the shakes like he did <br> acceptance - falling in battle to Yuri (or similar) and getting nommed by the tomato </br></br></br></br></br></br>  New episodes when  <br> He is a prisoner of Academia. Considered a heretic by everyone else because he doesn't use fusion, uses filthy rituals and he made decks built entirely on sealing away fusion summons. The last straw was him saying "Fusion summoning causes you to lose card advantage most of the time, it's not worth the investment. I think Xyz could be better".
