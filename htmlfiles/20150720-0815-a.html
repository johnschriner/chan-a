[ New chapter up soon.  I don't think there's any 'anticipation' for this shit anymore.<br> also be prepared to be flooded with /co/tards starting August. Thanks Toonami </br>  <br>GOOK SCANS WHEN</br>  <br>Niggastream &amp; the gooks are at fault for that.</br>  <br>Tashiro said on his twitter the new chapter will be exciting and interesting.</br>  <br>Who gives a shit anymore?<br><br>Sure. He wants to spark up some interest but this is already over. He'd better rush the thing and start something else.</br></br></br>  <br> implying we give a fuck about this. </br>    <br>I want to believe</br>  <br>Into the trash it goes.</br>  <br>You keep saying that but the manga killed itself.</br>    <br> AgK <br> Anticipation Thread </br></br>  nobody anticipates akg  <br> he wasn't around for the 3000 replies mega threads <br>I pity you anon</br></br>  <br> Tashiro said his manga is gonna be exciting and interesting <br>So is he trying to promote his turd because interest is utterly dead or because even him knows that previous chapters were boring shit?</br></br>  mine is kill soon I just can't wait anymore  <br>This is 2015 anon.

Toonami is airing the anime <br><br>Seriously? That was one of those "why did they even bother" adaptations. Animation? What's that?</br></br>  What happened to chapter 61?

The manga is pretty bland apart from the shock value, which spoiler threads did best.<br>Waifufags, like you said, all grew tired and moved on.<br>The anime killed hype for the ending because the second half was so bad. <br>Now toonami I hear? The series is fucking dead. Never has there been a case this bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  AgK is dead already  <br>OMG he is turning into a biological dragon!</br>  IT'S HAPPENING<br><br>HAIL TYRANT<br>A<br>I<br>L<br><br>T<br>Y<br>R<br>A<br>N<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well , other than start of Akame vs Wale and  nothing really happened.</br>  <br><br>We Bleach now</br></br>  <br> Akame vs Wave <br> Tats goes full dragon <br>Skimmed through that crap and I'm 10 chapters behind.<br>Literally who cares, R.I.P. Wave.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's cool.</br>  so probably gonna follow like in the anime with akame vs kurome  <br>We got to see Esdeath with her new move.</br>  <br>Super speedread that shit, no Mine, fucking shit. Re-dropped.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br><br>Replace Kurome with Wave</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Wave kills that bitch</br>  So next month we drink Wavefag tears?  <br><br>doubit because wave is the 2 MC accodiring to takahiro</br></br>  <br>was that her new special move or just one that hadn't been previously showed in the manga?</br>  Does anyone eben remember them all?  <br>Bu but he is better than Tatsumi</br>  <br>lame pun incoming..<br><br>A WAVE of tears.</br></br></br>  Wave a shit and worst girl.  <br> draw perfect and qt grills <br> have them die <br>Why is this allowed?<br><br>Time for Wave to fly again.</br></br></br></br></br>  There are people still reading this?  <br>Spear, Coro, aniki, Sayo, Tatsumi, Mine, Cordelia, Tsukushi can't remember the last one.</br>   Akame vs. Wave <br><br>fuck this shit to be honest</br></br>  <br>Tyrantsumi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wave&gt;&gt;Tatsumi</br>  I think he has all the right pieces he needs to fix this manga.<br><br>He needs to establish some more allies and fanservice girls to Tatsumi's team. Along with that, have Tatsumi go down a dark ascent into madness.<br><br>Have him questioning his loyalties and going up to join esdeath because of all the pain he felt being apart of night raid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good hopefully Wave fucking dies so a good girl can win.</br>  I dropped it when Akame was revealed not only to be a super-swordsman, but also Bruce Lee in naked hand combat, which chapter was that?  <br>To think that I used to hype this so much.</br>  <br> they told me I could be anything so I became Tyrant </br>  <br>the last one</br>  <br>That's stupid.</br>  <br>I still don't understand if she is supposed to be big breasted or not.</br>  Guys come on, it's not that bad, let's try and do damage control on this manga. <br><br>/a/ does it for literally EVERYTHING posted here, let's not give up. We need to try and coat the shit with paint and make things seem better.</br></br>  Meh. Re-dropping this till Tyrant fully takes over the manga and shows everyone how shit gets done  <br>Breast size in the manga and the anime fluctuates a lot</br>  <br>And we wouldn't want that, would we now?</br>  <br> 2 covers for Mein <br> 2 covers for Leone <br> 2 covers for Esdese <br> 1 cover for Akame <br><br> Akame ga KILL <br> Akame </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it is shit. Ever since Takahiro decided that no one will die anymore.</br>  he should just make AKG VN  <br>Wave is way too nice. Where all the others just murder and kill, Wave goes and captures them. Like he doesn't even know what happens to prisoners.</br>  <br>That's why I said it.<br><br><br>More like Akame ga Shafted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, budo is given the most ambiguous death in the series, he might be still alive an making a return.<br><br>tyrantsumi might mean we won't need demon mode akame<br><br>mine might die</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The coat is in the way. She is pretty stacked.</br>  <br>In many scenes yes, but not all the time.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>So I guess that's it for Wave. I highly doubt that Akame is going anywhere.</br>  <br>So they will dance around with Esdeath and PM and just become friends?</br>  <br>Akame usually gets the alternative covers. And I'm sure she will be the cover for the last volume.<br><br><br>Mine won't die. If they wanted her dead, she would have died like in the anime instead of becoming a vegetable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that because she flat on the ground?</br>  Here lies Wave, he never won.  <br>No.</br>  <br>You can also grow up and leave threads you don't like.</br>  <br>Ending will be the same as the anime, but with Tats and Mein both alive and well.</br>   wave beat akame before because she couldn't cut his armor <br><br> it is canon that good enough swordsmen can cut through tyrants armor <br><br> yfw she kills wave because she has been practicing armor piercing moves in case tatsumi gets taken over by tyrant </br></br></br></br>    <br>The perfect job to end it all.</br>  <br> Katana <br> armor piercing <br>Wouldn't it just break?</br></br></br>  <br>Not if it's folded over a thousand times.</br>  <br>Akame ga beautiful</br>    <br>It looks the same bust size as this. </br>  <br>And then we get pictures like this where she's just small and her breasts look absolutely disgusting.</br>  <br>So, you think that's the canon size? There are plently of pictures like this too.</br>  <br> Akame <br> Good <br><br>HAHAHAHA</br></br></br></br>  Akame would be better off dead then getting the same terrible fate as in the manga.  Is AgK popular again?  Mein is the cutest potato.  <br>while Lubbock pimps the girls in heaven. And this being AgK, there are many of them.</br>  I will fucking burn all of my AgK books if they just kill Wave without even hearing his ideals.  <br>Will probably get a popularity boost soon due to it being on Toonami  unfortunately </br>  <br>Pretty same that scene isn't as detailed as later volumes though.</br>  <br>So now Esdeath can also fly thanks to her teigu. That's not how Ice works.</br>  <br>No happy endings now.</br>  <br>There's not way Akame is going to cut through Grand Chariot, I guess either she uses her triumph card or they'll just stop fighting, or, the most probably one, she'll win with an asspull.</br>   sheere ded <br> aniki ded <br> introduces 2 new NR <br><br> chelsea ded <br> su ded <br> raba ded <br> mine ded <br> 0 new member <br><br>Here's the problem. Takahiro new to create more Main characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, Incursio will get 2 × Pratt &amp; Whitney F119-PW-100 pitch thrust vectoring turbofans to counter that.</br>  Soon.  <br> can't remember Zero's best girl <br>That's Poney.</br></br>  <br>*need</br>  <br> mine ded <br>No.</br></br>    <br>This is the last arc. Introducing new characters now is stupid.</br>   Fucking idiots still charging in on Esdeath <br><br>Why? If you see that bitch you just run for it. I will never understand these underlings that think they can just take on the strongest the enemy has to offer. Also literally who was that giant Black guy? Looked like Budo 2.0.</br></br>  <br>Time stop isn't how ice works either. Its demon blood she ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>I hope now that wild cunts are dead we can finally have a full on Rider fight.</br>  <br>They could just give some RA teigu users better design and characterization and have them interact with NR. Not just give them 2 panel each and then dropped dead.</br>  I don't think I've ever seen a series fall off the wagon quite as hard as AgK.<br><br>Fuck, 10 chapters ago the spoiler threads got to 1000s of replies. The anime really killed this series.<br><br>I realized what having an anime series finish the story off for you really does for a manga. It removes all interest in what happens next because, even if it IS different, the story is already concluded in people's mind. <br><br>Also Budo is the worst character in the story and Mine's "coma" is a complete copout after people bitching about her anime death though it was probably intended for her to die there in both anime and manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>There is also the niggerstream fact.<br>I mean, remember what happened when jag posted here? The threads were full of people hyped for the anime and the manga.<br>Raba losing his balls was the best.</br></br></br>  <br>RA are the bad guys is pretty much confirmed at this point.</br>  <br>Welp, he's dead</br>  <br><br>If esdeath is in front of you you're either going to die running at her or running away, your only hope is somehow surviving an ice barrage and playing dead</br></br>  <br>Nigger you what?</br>  <br>Keep in mind, 10 chapters ago was almost a year ago.</br>    <br> This could've all be avoided if Tatsumi had only chose to go with Esdeath <br><br>Sasuga Tatsumi</br></br></br>  <br>I think Lubbock dying was precisely the moment when I lost all interest in this.</br>  <br><br> underage cross-siters forcing this shit on /a/ <br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  So in what bullshit way is Wave going to die? We all know that Akame can't lose.  <br>What is this Akame vs Wave match-up at the first place?</br>  <br>Better become a monster than go with a monster.</br>  Takahiro has been cleaning house more than giving meaningful deaths for a while. In the beginning it was shocking but it ended up getting tiring. We barely get any world building or character development and everything that happens goes towards some battle where someone dies. It feels like lazy writing.  <br>Akame can't hurt Wave.</br>  <br> Lets name a manga bleach when it has nothing to do with detergents <br>Top Kubo.</br></br>  <br>Dude really it's just as bad as joining a monster.</br>  <br>Not really. Even with that, Tatsumi is 1000 times more human than Esdeath.</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>I really want to have her go doki doki after me.</br>   Wave promised himself he will keep away Kurome from fighting <br> Event of the actual chapter <br>Sasuga Takahiro</br></br>  <br>That's why it's going to be bullshit. Unless the two of them come under an understanding about Kurome.</br>  <br>Any gookfags around? TL is strongly needed here.</br>   Tatsumi becomes full dragon <br> Stars dating full demon Esdese <br><br>Only thing that can make this good again.</br></br></br>  Kurome will interfere in some way.  <br>So nothing really happens again the chapter.</br>  <br>And Tatsumi too. The cover spoils it.</br>  <br> mfw Tatsumi rapes Wave </br>  <br> The super acclaimed TV anime </br>  <br>Armor &gt; Murasame.<br><br>Wave managed to fuck her ribs up last time, MU wise Akame is at a huge disadvantage. But this is manga so...</br></br></br>  <br> Kurome sacrificing herself for her Husbando <br><br>Poor Wave will never be with his Waifu.</br></br></br>  <br> Esdeath can fly now <br><br>Takahiro and his asspulls, no wonder this shit is awful.</br></br></br>  <br>can't wait for the dumbass to start pew pewing into civilians.</br>  <br>Tatsumi is far beyond Wave though. This can only end in Wave getting wrecked.</br>  <br>You guys never give up.</br>  <br>The only way to have a fair match is 1 vs 1, no teigus, final destination.</br>  <br> no teigus <br>Tatsumi is already half-dragon now.</br></br>  <br>At this point they're both monsters. It just happens that Esdeath is more of a monster than him.</br>  <br>Tatsumi has fused with his Teigu now though.</br>  <br><br>Okay, Wave with his teigu vs Tatsumi with his bare hands.</br></br>  <br>Fucking this.</br>  <br> The super acclaimed TV anime </br>  <br>For me it was when Syura died. Syura sama ;_; I still can't get over it ;_;</br>  i wonder which of the generic background tier character dies next bros <br>this manga is so epic.....teh feels await....... ;____;</br>  <br>lol faggot</br>  <br> lol </br>  <br> literally what he just said. </br>  <br>heres your reply.</br>  <br> .......  <br> ;____; <br/></br></br>  It surprised me that it already airs on German television.  According to logic Wave should beat Akame here. Too bad this is AgK where anything can happen.  Every passing chapter is making me hate Akame more and more. Bitch really should have died to Izou, that would have planed AgK above your average shounen, but no, bitch should be invincible for no good reason.  <br><br> mere hours before chapter spoilers <br> shitposting everywhere <br> recall the day Mine confessed to Takumi <br> shitflinging like it was no tomorrow <br> all the tension that led up to the panel that revealed Chelsea's head on a pike <br><br>Where did it all go? I missed those.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait what? Where? I was supprised to see that Pro7 actually showed Evangelion but which Channel shows this?</br>  <br> Shura  <br>probably the most pathetic death in the whole manga.</br></br>  <br>Most pathetic was Dorothea. But Syura shouldn't have died like that.</br>  <br>Sorry nobody will ever top Budo. Those threads were so fucking funny.</br>  <br>I guess now with that the series hit rock bottom, now it can't get even worst right? Right!?</br>  <br>Merry christmas!</br>  <br>Pro7 Maxx the adds are fucking embarassing.</br>  <br>Not necessary, remember Suzuka vs Tatsumi.<br><br>Akame just need to resist until Wave's armor disappear.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is this happening now? I thought he had 2 more times until this would happen</br>  <br>I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ANYMORE, BUT I SWEAR THAT IF KUROME DIE IMA GO ALLAH AKBAR ON TAKAHIRO ASS, BUYING THE FUCKING TICKETS ALREADY YOU HEAR ME MOTHERFUCKER.</br>  <br> people unironically want another one hit kill from Akame <br><br>Just no, pls Takahiro. Do something fuckin new.</br></br></br>  <br>He is probably not _that_ retarded to do this again. But this akame vs wave thing is pretty surprising. Kurome and Tatsumi will surely show up.</br>   This is just going to follow the steps of the anime with some really minor changes and with a much slower pace <br>Count me out</br>  <br>Gookfag(s) where? What they are talking about seem interesting at least.</br>  <br> Check it out <br> Fucking Stargate is playing <br><br>Welp no Anime with horrible German dub for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tatsumi new final boss?<br> Tatsumi will become such a big threat that going to obligate Esdeath and Akame work together against him. </br></br>  Why can't Tatsumi control Incursio like Esdesu did with that evil blood shit? I thought Incursio was a good boy.  <br>Don't kid yourself.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EQ1<wbr>wvsmmI-I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Oh god they are playing Eva 3.33 this Wednesday</br>  <br>That would be too good for this Manga.</br>  <br>At least the show had budget just for this. Tashiro will struggle pathetically to get it half right like he did with Budo.</br>  <br>That's great but who will be the one who can stop him.</br>  <br>Nah, the moment Wild Hunt become fodder was, at least for me, Wild Hunt was suppose to lead the manga to a new outcome, but at the end nothing happens. I lost all hope already, just waiting if Takahiro decide to give Kuromo a happy ending now.</br>  <br> "good" doujins never. </br>  <br> Sie sind Killer </br>  <br>The one with Leone is really good.</br>  <br>If I remember correctly, Incursio by his nature adapts to every situation or environment, so it makes sense to slowly dominate Tatsumi.<br><br>The demon blood was just evil, but since Esdese is pretty fucked up it doesn't matter.</br></br></br>  <br> German dubs <br>Every single time. It's like Germany never recovered from<br> SASOOKAY, HE'S REALLY COOL <br> SAKURA, DA BYOOTIFOOL </br></br></br></br>  <br>exdeath said he was done being trained or something while she said tatsumi would take years. even though he has the raw power, i think they'd make it so that wave has the skill to compensate for it somewhat. wave would still lose though</br>  <br> I lost all hope already, just waiting if Takahiro decide to give Kuromo a happy ending now. <br>Literally the same for me.<br><br>Anyway, Doya lost her arms against the fagpirate, no?</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's the only good one</br>  Whoever called the revolutionaries being just as bad as the empire was right on the money. This manga is Edge incarnate.  <br> Whoever called the revolutionaries being just as bad as the empire was right on the money. <br>The Revolution/Night Raid being as bad as the empire was the intention, but the anime and manga failed hard to deliver. Despite Bulat saying that they're not fighting for justice and little more than hired killers, we factually see Night Raid operating with a quite strict code of conduct. Everyone they kill is evil in one way or another, they've never killed a genuinely good person simply because he's a detriment to the goals of the revolution. We have a few sympathetic guys on the side of the empire, but even they see the corruption of the empire. Most of its warriors (Seryuu, Dr. Stylish, Kurome, Esdeath, the three demons, all of Wild Hunt) are genuinely horrible people.<br><br>So no, Night Raid and the Revolution are nowhere near as bad as the Empire. It'd be interesting if they were as bad or even worse, but Takahiro can't write that well. I repeat: not ONE person associated with the empire we've seen die was a good person (other than maybe some faceless, nameless soldiers and even that is pure speculation).</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the pages of the revolutionaries killing civilians? Or the one where they are talking about enslaving the inhabitants once they kill the Emperor and his associates?</br>  <br> Did you miss the pages of the revolutionaries killing civilians? <br>NR confirmed to be IS.</br></br>  <br>HQ scan when?</br>  what if agk was more of a comedy but everyone still died in the usual gruesome fashion?  <br>dem cat tats</br>   Mdese is alive <br>Yes<br><br><br> Will probably remain that way until we get more Esdeath/Tatsumi interaction <br>It's not like they can any other interaction that fighting at this point, so it's pretty meh.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just like early Attack on Titan it's like Game of throne genre which each chapter a person is killed.</br>  <br>Yes, I miss those. Unless that happens in this new chapter, I don't remember that things happening.</br>  <br>they can have*</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Tatsumi was overpowering Budou and Esdeath. Wave couldn't come close to that.</br>    <br>and no body questions any of the deaths except Tatsumi who is the same as current manga</br>  <br>Tatsumi is like the Eren of AgK. <br>Some basic skills <br>while his black haired friend who is overly skilled etc.</br></br></br>  <br> Lubbock dying <br><br>Yep. Honestly, that was bad writing. I never gave a shit about Lubbo before his last moments, but afterwards I was interested and wanted to see him succeed.<br><br>AFTER he fucking died. That's not how you develop a story. It doesn't feel sad, it just feels like wasted potential. When I think about Lubbo that only thing I can do is wince in disappointment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The anime handled his death a bit better than the manga version that's for sure.</br>  <br>do you guys remember that retarded anti-Teigu thing the PM had in the last episode?<br><br>maybe it will reverse this shit.</br></br></br>  I want Wave and Kurome to have a happy ending together.<br><br>We will at least get that, r-right?   ;_;  </br></br>  This chapter was shit, it still feels like it's going to end like the anime but it's just going at a slower pace. Maybe Mine lives but that's all.  <br>Seriously. He was one of the few people in the manga who fought smart instead of bullshitting it up. He also was pretty good as a character. And then he gets killed in a dumb way for shock value by a guy who ends up jobbing in two panels. Fuck that shit. I think even Takahiro realized how badly he fucked up his death with all the "I'm doing this for Lubbock" in the next chapters.</br>  <br>Yeah, I missed those. Did a new chapter come out already or was that implied in Zero?<br><br><br> He reproduced so he's a good person <br>Try again. Pic related is the very next page, recounting all of his sins.

You said there would be meat. Where is the meat? Where is it?  <br>in  my pants </br>  <br>this actually annoys me.<br>akame would have worked well as an eroge, it's shit for a manga though.<br><br><br>*unzips stake*</br></br></br></br></br>   *unzips stake*   <br>I keep hearing he used to write VNs. Were those actually good?</br>    <br>I know they finished the translation for the first game, but S is still unfinished right?</br>  <br>S got finished like 2-3 days ago I think</br>  <br><br>S translation has been finished 2 days ago actually.</br></br>  <br>Ever since Esdese and Budho became generic medium threat enemies I stopped caring.<br><br>Last time they had their entire strike force and several trump cards they barely managed to get away from Esdes with their lives.<br><br>Now Akame is able to take her on solo and Tatsumi wiped the floor with her.<br><br>Mein also instakilled Budho who was supposed to be on par with Esdese.<br><br><br>Seriously this series lost all of it's threats, now it's just boring. They don't even have to worry about armies because as they said the revolutionary army has completely encircled the capital and has cut off all of their supply lines.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, what. I can fap to Benkeis route now?</br></br>  <br><br>First Mikayo's route and now this. I'm fucking happy. Now I only need Benkei's route and I can die.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Seriously this series lost all of it's threats <br>But the writing of the author is the greatest threat. He can kill any character with an asspull.</br></br>  <br> Last time they had their entire strike force and several trump cards they barely managed to get away from Esdes with their lives. <br>Keep in mind that back then, Esdeath was actively holding back because she had to defend her target. She couldn't let loose and wreck them.<br><br>I understand that a shonen needs powerful enemies for the MC to overcome, but it never felt like Tatsumi improved. Tyrant just gave him an upgrade and voila, Night Raid can now wreck Esdeath and Budo at the same time, killing one of them. <br><br>We never saw anyone improve. The closest thing we had to improvement was after Susanoo and Chelsea were introduced. At some point, Bossu ordered them to go into the woods to "level up". <br><br>Even Naruto, as much as /a/ may hate it, had episodes where the titular character trained and practice to perfect his Rasengan. That's more development, improvement and training than we've ever seen in Akame ga Kill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Benkei´s route is in A1 actually, so you´ll have to wait for that. I have however seen some Benkei scenes while browsing the S CG gallaries but i have clue how to get acces to those.</br></br>  <br> I keep hearing he used to write VNs. <br>he still does, pic related is from his newest VN.<br> Were those actually good? <br>yes</br></br></br></br>  <br>have no clue*</br>  <br> Benkei´s route is in A1 actually, so you´ll have to wait for that. <br>So, another 2-3 years?</br></br>  <br><br>I can't believe I'm happy in an Akame thread.</br></br>  <br>Why do Finnish in visual novels and anime always get silver hair? Not that I mind.</br>   tfw I will never get a laid back girlfriend like Benkei   <br>Isn't this new one shit though?</br>   If they use the part that was already translated by Wairu translations they might finish by the end of this year with this pace.  <br>we haven't seen him fight properly yet. the best we got was when he fought 3 night raid members. budo said he underestimated tatsumi before he got critically wounded and he still outlasted tatsumi. he would've won in a 1v1 at that point if he wasn't retarded or even if mine's power wasn't plot armor shit. esdeah was also underestimating him in that fight and said she'd fight serious next time since she got him or something like that<br><br>tatsumi's stronger now though</br></br></br>  <br>happens in this chapter. <br><br><br><br><br>This looks like a doujin.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far as I remember, her and the maid's routes in A-1 were started but dropped, and now it's up to whoever picked up the series to finish them, might be talking out of my ass here though.</br>  <br>Show me the pages.</br>  Why doesn't Tatsumi just use Akame's sword? Are teigu supposed to be like devil fruits or something?<br><br>I'm pretty sure if Tatsumi could easily beat the shit out of Esdese with a spear then he'd be unstoppable with a 1 hit kill sword that he has actually trained with most of his life.</br></br>  <br>Didn't they lost Mine in that battle? Also Esdeath couldn't land a hit on her in the cathedral.</br>  <br> implying you will get any kind of girlfriend </br>  <br>If I ever get one, I'd like a Benkei type of girlfriend.</br>  <br>each person can only use one, no? they also said early in the manga that there was a matter of compatibility with them. i don't remember if someone can't use it or if it's just much weaker if the person isn't compatible. either way, there was some sort of explanation in the early chapters</br>  <br>Maybe they think the Finnish are like polar bears.</br>  <br>Except that her 3DPD equivalent is an alcoholic NEET.</br>  Translation when?  <br> Didn't they lost Mine in that battle? <br>Only after a one-on-one clash where she singlehandedly destroyed Mine... and ended up surviving, probably long enough to fully recover to be with Tatsumi in the end. Against Budo, who is on par with Esdeath. When earlier she struggled to defeat Seryuu and only came out victorious by the skin of her teeth, and even then needed the help of Tatsumi to survive. And we've never seen her significantly improve between those two moments.<br><br> Inb4 "b-but Budo hadn't exercise in a while" <br>Not only is that not enough to bridge the gigantic power gap between Mine and Budo, but that also doesn't explain how Esdeath got her shit pushed in as well. Also, that's fucking retarded: the empire is at constant war with enemies both on the outside and the inside, and the emperors throne is more shaky than it has ever been. Budo, if he's as devoted to the empire as he claims he is, has literally no good reason not to train his ass off. Even in times of peace it'd be inexcusble, but in times of war and chaos it's downright retarded, almost as if the author made him temporarily a complete and utter retard just so Mine could survive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I could understand that if it were an armored suit but a sword is a fucking sword. It can't fight back if you want to swing it.</br>  <br>With an amazing body and apperently one heck of a brain?</br>  <br><br> Teigus kill you if you have bad compatibility.</br></br>  Did Akune and Leone fuck Tatsumi to calm him down?  <br>who's akune</br>   there are people on /a/ who read this dogshit <br> all the cancer ITT <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/gaia/</br></br>  <br>That's bullshit. If they could kill people that easily then they would use that power to kill their enemies when compatible users use them.<br><br>Fact of the matter is that they're tools and can't fight back unless they're literally alive like Tatsumi's weapon.</br></br></br>  <br>not really. they could corrode their internal organs or give them deceases or something like that. you're being pretty stupid about this</br>  <br> Didn't you watch the first episodes or read the first chapters? Tatsumi almost got killed by the Eye-thingy Tengu because he had bad compatibility with it.<br> They don't use this to kill other people because the process is slower than just outright using your Tengu to kill the faggot and it involves you handling your Teigu to somehow who might or might not have good compatibility with it.</br></br>  <br> almost as if the author made him temporarily a complete and utter retard just so Mine could survive. <br> almost <br> "I'm using my trump card" <br> random lightning targeting no one <br> oops I didn't check my energy gauge <br>no budo lost was super fucking stupid when it came to mine</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akame being able to hold esdeath nearly on her own is just silly following her getting pushed in by wave.</br>  <br>No they are shit.</br>  <br>Esdeath was playing around. Notice how easily Budou bitchslapped Akame.</br>  <br>Anekouji? apparently for some people is a big disappointment, but I don't know if they went over hyped.</br>  who wavexakame here    <br> Esdese will never finger your butt </br>  <br>unless akame manages to talk some sense into him. and that's very big if</br>  <br>Delicious Leone</br>  <br>What. The. Fuck.</br>  <br>Akame betraying NR for Wave could be interesting, a shame is not gonna happen, that would be living the dream for Wave with the two sisters.</br>  <br>What's with the white hair?</br>  <br>Guess it's because of the fire.</br>  The chapter everyone has been waiting for.

IT FINALLY HAPPENED!" à la Dumon?  <br>I don't usually complain about anime designs, but in this case they really take away the best of the manga.</br>  <br>If anything, I think the beginning of the manga is drawn as if it's a serious shoujo, romance manga with the writing of an off-the-wall comedy.</br>  <br>The anime is confirmed for shit, sadly, so unless some miracle happens and Dumon manages to save it I'd say just go for the manga.<br><br><br>"The song that connects the universe"<br>"It's Supergalactic Idol Nagisa-chan!"<br>"What is this person saying--"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wait. what? a japanese harem manga having a successful love confession? that can't happen. no fucking way. why am i grinning so much? why can't other mangika's do this? is this so hard? think about all the time and effort that bastard who drew mystery girlfriend x went through only to give us an asexual non-romance ending, where as this based motherfucker blows that shit out with the force of 1000 suns.</br>  <br> because the manga feels like it's drawn as a horror manga <br>Don't start, we had enough of that with the other thread.

I, I don't even know what to say. <br>This</br></br>  <br>Sasuga.</br>  This is the best confession I've ever seen. <br><br>They both confessed and there was no last minute "I can't because I have to spare others feelings" or "I can't because it would put him/her in danger" it was a mutual confession after all this build up and no one got hit by a truck or got hit on the head and got amnesia. <br><br>This was all payoff. One hundred percent payoff!</br></br></br></br>  <br>She did it, she fucking scored.</br>  <br>They both won each other, which is how it should be</br>    <br>And it would feel wonderful</br>  <br>Joke's on you, I'm into strong girls!</br>  The great thing is that since the manga is focussing on silliness and comedy, it can actually allow the other plot lines to progress.<br>They actually get closer and closer while the usually whacky bullshit happens with the other characters, but it actually discusses their plans for the future and such.<br>During the next chapter they  panic about what 'going out' means to them now, even getting grilled in a pseudo quiz show by Dumon, before coming to the agreement that they'll take things slow and not rush into it .<br>Around chapter 100 we get  the first big date, with two more heart-attack-inducing chapters .<br><br>Besides that, the story also explores all the side-characters and even devotes entire chapters to the first-years, with Durriken, Asahi's sister and Dumcubus.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MOTY,AY</br>  <br>Not to mention Alium finally reaching 100% despair.</br>  Also: best substitute teacher soon  <br><br> I haven't given up on you yet <br> If there is an opening, I will go for it! <br><br>allium confirmed dumpster tier, where she can trash around with lewd orange</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, she'll get over it.</br>  <br><br><br>Alien may be my favorite but this still pleases me so damn much.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Futa clones? I like where this is going.</br></br>  I'm only 40 chapters in but I don't regret going into this thread. I'm glad to know that there will be actual romantic development.  <br> They don't even confess, they just kind of have one side imply it and the end. <br><br>This shit is like drinking fresh untouched water directly from a mountain spring after spending years in India.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thank you guys.</br></br>  <br>Never has it seeing an MC being totally and disarmingly honest with his love interest been as hilarious and rewarding as Kuromine's confession right here.<br><br>I can't help but cheer for him all the way.

You'd know that if you had ever been in one of these threads before.</br></br></br></br>  <br> reading manga on 4chan is a shitty experience <br>What? That's the best way to read newly translated chapters. You read the same page as all the other anons and discuss it, while waiting on another page dump. It's  fun. <br><br><br>What do you mean, what's the point of that? The chapter they're dumping on /a/ is not the final version of the translation. Futari dumps it here so we can catch all the mistakes they made, if they made any.. Think of it like a beta-version of the translation. When they're sure everything's correct, they publish it on their website.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>keked</br>  <br>When will Oka get his time to shine?</br>  <br><br> you will never be able to take being friend-zoned this cooly. </br></br>  <br> implying he didn't cry himself to sleep that night </br>  <br><br><br>The pasta must be really good</br></br></br>   Bakangel is the only girl without a love interest <br><br>Feels bad man.<br><br> you will never be subjected to the suffering of having her give you sweet tender loving UNTIL DEATH DO YOU PART </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> water cress on pasta <br><br>What an abomination. Water Cress on anything is only second to the crime that is ketchup on pizza.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except she's not. Dumon, Sensei and Shiho do not have a love interest as well.</br>  <br>What sort of fucking monster puts ketchup on pizza?</br>  <br> Sensei and Shiho do not have a love interest <br>hhhhohohoho</br></br>  <br> ketchup on pizza <br>People don't actually do this, do they?<br> Do they? </br></br></br>  <br>Our god is an awesome god</br>  <br> the real cool beauty </br>  <br><br>Is it really that weird to put ketchup on pizza? I mean sure, if you already have some sauces on it then you don't really need anything else, but whenever I make home-made pizza I always add ketchup and it's fucking tasty.</br></br>  <br>Sakurada likes Densei and Shiho actually likes Kuromine which is why she only teases him.</br>  <br>Dumon had a love interest.<br>Had.<br><br>Atrocious.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>People genuinely do this.<br><br>There are also a bunch of pizzas you can by in the UK with mustard, balsamic vinegar-type stuff or Raita on them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So who's their love interest?</br>  <br>I sense endless possibilties with this.</br>  <br><br>Do you think the Dumon had a virgin birth?</br></br>  <br>Did the series got axed?</br>  <br><br>I lost it.</br></br>  <br>No, it's still going strong. Currently there are 120+ chapters, and it releases weekly.</br>  It was all worth it, to get to this point. Now I can die a happy man  <br><br>every time</br></br>  <br>Japs fucking love puttin all manner of condiments on their pizza. It's probably a carry over from okonomiyaki.</br>  <br>Now that's just retarded.</br>    <br>OOOOH YEAAAAAAAAAAAAH</br>  <br><br>If you find that disgusting, then I have some bad news for you, people will use ketchup on literally everything. Hell, my sister puts ketchup on a fucking cottage cheese.</br></br>  <br><br>Ketchup sandwiches.</br></br>  <br>I hope this happens in D-Frag! one day with Kazuma and  Takao </br>  <br><br>And I thought me putting mayo on pizza was bad enough.</br></br>  <br>My heart hurts. This happiness is something I was not prepared to deal with today. Look at these fucking dorks, they've come so far.</br>  <br>I doubt she is sad about it, he probably fucked it until his death.</br>  <br>I can't believe she's not really a cool beauty.</br>  <br>WHEN WILL SHE BITE? WILL THERE BE ANY PRE-MARITAL BITING?</br>  <br>In Germany pretty much every pizza delivery has the option to replace the passata with barbecue sauce.</br>  <br>But anon,  she is, she just doesn't know it.  </br>  <br><br>Dumon just doesn't know when to quit.</br></br>  <br>She's pretty clearly broken up about something. Literally everything that's happened so far has happened because Dumon is lonely.</br>  <br>now that's just rude</br>  <br><br> posting that image over and over again </br></br>  <br>trace on?</br>  <br>Yamada and the Seven Witches continued after the main dude and girl got together and it's been horrid ever sense. This could be the beginning of the end of this manga.</br>  <br>Fuck, I thought it was the one from chapter 1-something-something where she's saying "I'm... lonely?"<br>Which is an image I don't seem to have saved.</br></br>  <br><br>That's not okay.</br></br>  <br><br>Yamada tried to do the same thing over and over again, despite the story basically being over. It's a total shitfest now.<br><br>This is a gag manga with the romance secondary, it'll easily survive them having cute awkward dates and ending once they're married.<br><br>It's already fucking bettered MGX<br><br> "I know the manga has been treading water since the idol arc but stick with it and you'll get a payoff with a kiss" <br> final chapter <br> this happens <br><br>FUCK YOOOOOU</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yamada tried to do the same thing over and over again <br><br>It didn't try to it did do the same thing over and over again.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Yamada manga went downhill after they got together, because it was the end of the first arc. It would still be interesting if Mangaka would introduce something new, but she's basically re-doing the first arc with new characters now. Characters that literally nobody gives a fuck about, that's why it's so boring now.<br><br>We won't have the same problem with JW, as it's based on comedy and character interactions - something that won't get boring anytime soon, especially now that they're dating.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I like how there was basically a chapter which was obviously a result of editor intervention where they just suddenly gave up the witch hunting.<br><br>Even the publishers knew the whole "new witches" thing was a cancer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't remind me. The first arc was great, and now I have to force myself to continue reading this crap every week. Noa is the only reason I still have the strength to suffer through this shit.</br>   you'll never be confessed to by a cutie kansai-ben vampire <br><br>why even live</br></br>  <br>Cuck</br>  <br><br><br>Ah, so she just wants to make sure Dumpire and Asahi stay together by keeping the heat on them.<br><br>Alium is SUCH A CUCK.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To wait for VR to become advanced enough for it to happen</br>  <br>Did the author make the main dude and girl win each other then make up a bunch of bullshit to keep them apart for most of the manga like I saw in the anime?</br>  <br>Yes, for reasons they're barely together.</br>  <br>Why even pair them up then?</br>  <br>Yeah. It doesn't even make sense, they barely have any chemistry behind them. Anime ended on about chapter 90, after which we got few chapters with them acting like a  retarded  couple, and then she basically disappeared from the manga.</br>  <br>Only things I've ever considered putting on Pizza were Tabasco or Blue Cheese.</br>  <br><br> and then she basically disappeared from the manga <br><br>so exactly like fucking yankee-kun to literally who-chan?</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying I've read that trash manga </br>  <br> &gt;and then she basically disappeared from the manga <br> so exactly like fucking yankee-kun to literally who-chan? <br>Final Scene: Yamada became a Teacher at this school. He slips and falls down the stairs, dragging someone behind him down while falling.<br><br>It is Shirashi, as youthful as ever. A Kiss happened while falling down.<br><br>Did I mention that the two don't know each other?<br>(Alternative Interpretation: This is just in Yamada's head as he lies in a puddle of his own blood after falling down.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Have we had any good doujins yet?</br></br>  <br> But as a man <br>Shouldn't that be as a woman?</br></br>  <br><br> next chapter <br><br>"Actually I really am a..."</br></br></br></br>  <br>SHE likes HIM as a man, you moron</br>  <br>English is a shitty language, give him a break.</br>  <br>I'd like to thank based God for creating the universe, allowing me to see this.</br>  <br>Nobody pointed this out, but you already used "Let's Confess!" as the first chapter's title.</br>  <br>Maybe they have the same title. It makes sense.</br>  BASED<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>Has there ever been a more BASED pair of protagonists?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Next chapter</br></br>  <br>Thank you so much for providing those. I love this mango and recent frequent and steady stream of updates makes my kokoro  moist .</br>  <br>The end of chapter 84 is the same as p20 or so in the first chapter, so maybe it's actually the same title.</br>  <br>These two dorks were literally made for each other. <br> Will she bite him before the wedding, during it as a replacement for the kiss, or on their honeymoon? </br></br>  <br><br>You never know, but it's heating up with Chitose entering the Kazumabowl</br></br>   this thread <br><br>Welp, time to finally pick this up.</br></br>  <br> It took me about five minutes to realise that was a truck. I thought she was standing in front of rice paddies for some reason. </br>  <br>i can say without a doubt that MGX anime&gt;manga<br><br>Why the fuck isnt Urabe's VA in everything holy fuck</br></br></br>   It's time.   <br>Prison School full of worst boys.</br>  No  So how about  It really isn't time. This season is shit.  I'm loving that bara-ness of Ushio. If Tora didn't look like he came out of a 90s comic book (and wasn't a furfag, let's be honest) I could see there being plenty of doujins where Tora forcefully 'eats' Ushio. <br><br>Does Tora have a human form and, more importantly, is it cute?</br></br>  <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>You're just being picky, anon.</br>   Why can't Rui just be loved tenderly?    <br>We see a man orgasm on-screen and this season is supposed to be shit?</br>  Which Tenkai would you Knight?  <br>Because traps deserve to suffer</br>  <br>None. They look a little underdeveloped.</br>  <br>The only thing missing this season is a decent sport series with qt boys, but other wise we got all tastes filled.</br>  Anyone else start playing this? It's an actual rhythm idol boy game.<br>Some of them are cute.</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>IB is best idols</br>  When's HQ coming bach?  <br>That was a surprise.</br>  <br> this face right after while the shower soundclip was still running </br>  <br>I don' have any devices that can play the game.<br><br>Also fuck off to<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  I like how this season continues to omnipander.  Would you let Leo be your tortoise knight?  <br>Watching haremshit for its guys is only going to break your heart, anon. <br> But I'm also enjoying GATE </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br><br>It's a good week.</br></br>  <br>I wonder</br>  <br>Why would you assume I know what that is? <br>Is it an anime or a manga?</br></br>    <br>It's from Aichuu, a mobile rhythm game.</br>  <br>What could have been</br>  <br> that show </br>  <br>Try googling text from the card then,</br>  <br>Then fuck off to </br>   thread turning into /v/ again   <br>That author who does Oreimo doujin better deliver.</br>  <br> dat look <br> dat wet hair <br> dat everything <br>popped a boner</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching it for  adult characters and I love the modern military in a historical or medieval setting theme. One of my favorite anime is Zipang. </br>  <br>I wish that Ghostbusters had more than 1 cute guy in it but I'm also enjoying it.</br>  I've finally figured it out, he's just Mattsundere.  Did /a/ like K? wasn't around when it was airing but it's pretty homo. <br>Here's Green King.</br>  <br>I can't figure out which one is more dominant. He is the boss and has clearly more authority but then again sensei is older.</br>  <br> dem tiger brows </br>  I've never understood these threads.<br>It's satire right.</br>    <br>Is it on google play? I can't find it.</br>  <br>Don't forget<br> dem armpits </br></br>  <br>Just as satirical as waifu threads.<br>Which means it started out as a joke and now people mistakenly believe it's a real thing and okay.</br></br>  <br>The movie was disappointing, but I can't wait for S2. I rewatched it like 3 times.</br>  <br>Its region locked. The bitches on otome general should be able to help you get it though.</br>  <br> Shounen MC with passions outside of sports or food <br>Fucking fresh.</br></br>  <br>Maybe fucking off to /vg/ well help.</br>  <br>Also, nomination for having the most surprise homolust of the season?</br>  <br>Thanks, I'll try. I've been looking for a mobile rhythm game anyway.</br>  <br>Alright.<br>So is this shit limited to 2D. I have no idea how this works.<br>Like how lolicon doesn't translate to 3D at all, can anyone that participates in these threads explain themselves?</br></br></br>  <br> surprise <br>You should read the manga, it's pure bait.</br></br>  <br>The movie felt more like something that should have been an ova instead. Did you understand a lot of the stuff that went on in season 1? The manga has horrible art but reading in explained a lot more stuff by adding in details. It was the Green King that caused all that shit to happen in season 1.</br>  <br>Everyone on this show has brain problems.</br>  <br> So is this shit limited to 2D. <br>This is a given.</br></br>  <br>Chapter 1 reads like a BL manga.</br>  <br> surprise </br>  <br>It's hardly a surprise, though the premise might sound like it's reverse harem. But it barely focuses on the fact MC is a girl and hasn't had romance so far. It's more bros being bros shonen manga.</br>  <br>I did but I don't remember it being this homo.</br>  <br>Does it have a female mc?</br>  <br>The mc is female yes</br>  <br>He's so depraved.</br>  It's time to post your husbando!  <br>Can I post my son instead?</br>  <br>This thread is off to a good start.</br>  <br>Bl needs more diverse art styles</br>  <br>It sure is.</br>  <br>Hmm, looking back he is extremely depraved.  I hope he gets the mob doujins he deserves </br>  <br> fujos <br> watching shoujo  <br>I doubt he'll get anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Summer is the best time of the year, after all.</br>  <br>Technically it's shounen, but you're probably right anyway.</br>  <br>Who looks exactly like a boy 100% of the time. There are certain implicit leanings here.</br>  <br>That's not shoujo though<br>It's "neo-shonen", aka shonen that most likely still panders to girls(see Kuroshitsuji).</br></br>  <br>Tora is a qt oversized cat, do not sexualize him.</br>  <br>You need to relax. Why don't you lay down right over there.</br>  <br> neo-shonen <br>Why do you have to invent new terms if you can just call it shoujo?<br><br>Monthly GFantasy might as well call itself shoujo since by now 90% of its target audience is girls. <br><br>ffs, Switch, Saiyuki, Pandora Hearts, Nabari no Ou and Kimi to Boku ran in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This show is shit though. Only watching because some anon told me that there will be shota suffering in the future.</br>  <br>Wow sounds like it's demographic is shoujo.</br>  <br><br><br>MC is so fuckin ugly.</br></br></br>  <br>He looks roofied.</br>  <br>Okay. I just hope we at least see more of this delinquent.</br>  <br> Yes he does </br>  <br>So even if you call those shoujo, what does that have to do with  ? G Fantasy's titles are popular among fujoshi.</br>  <br> Ranpo kittan threads are somehow gayer than homothread </br>  Yo homodachi, any of you interested in some typesetting?  <br>Not really. You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos. Besides, he looks a lot cuter in the manga.</br>  <br>Ouran got some doujins back then, they were all terrible but still.</br>  <br>And he is even uglier in the manga.</br>  <br>Why are they so LONG?</br>  <br>I think he's cute</br>  <br> You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos <br><br>No man, I'm just not blind.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking LONG </br>  <br>This doujin was great.</br>  <br>I think he's really cute.</br>  <br> fujo design <br>He looked like Sousuke on manga cover.</br></br>  <br>Actually in that image he looks fine, if only the rest of the show was drawn that well.</br>  <br>Well, Sousuke is cute.</br>  <br>Wrong Sousuke though.</br>  <br>Then you should've posted who you meant, dumbass.</br>  <br>Everybody knows which Sousuke dumbass.</br>  Myreadingmanga died?  <br>No?</br>  <br>Oh god, CLAMP has a problem.</br>  <br>Because they're not 15</br>  My homo-meter was off the charts this chapter   cutest boy is gone <br><br>Suddenly there is no reason to watch it anymore.</br></br>  <br>nope.</br>   3745HOUSE new doujin out <br><br><br>Uh? Sensei still there.</br></br></br>  <br>That's some weak trolling there, dumbass.</br>  <br>What are you saying, Kaitocchi is still very much present.</br>  <br> cutest boy is gone <br>Something happened to the teacher?</br></br>  <br>Why use it? Basically everything on it is on sadpanda</br>  <br><br><br><br>Jesus christ get some taste. No wonder everyone is laughing at you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some aren't, and I prefer the scroll down format.</br>  Sera-sensei is a tyrant teacher and probably smells like beer and oil.  <br>Still posting worse Sousuke dumbass?</br>  <br>I prefer a guy that smells of blood, sweat, and whiskey.</br>  <br>Is it going to be KarmaxNagisa or NagisaxKayano? I'm personally rooting for  OotaxNagisa .</br>  <br>What an ugly bitch.</br>  <br>Kayano is clearly the manga endgame, but that won't stop me fapping to any good KarmaxNagisa doujins.<br>I really wish we'd get NagisaxKarma sometime too.</br></br>  <br>At least someone is posting a Sousuke dumbass</br>  <br> everything on it is on sadpanda <br><br>A lot of translated manga and doujins aren't. Site is good, if you ignore the terrible layout and users.</br></br></br>  <br>He sure is. Makes him even more moe.</br>  <br> Manlets </br>  <br>You are wasting image limit dumbass.</br>  <br>They also make me smile</br>  <br>And you still haven't posted the Sousuke you were thinking of, dumbass</br>  <br>No, it makes him shit.</br>  <br>Manlets are cute</br>  <br>No need to post the obvious dumbass.</br>  <br><br>Can you faggots fuck off?</br></br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Old post, but am I looking at this wrong? He looks like he has a bustle, or dislocated hip.</br>    <br>Thanks for agreeing that GATE MC is cute.</br>  <br>He means Sousuke from Free. Hence why he quoted the thing about fujo bait. Now both of you can shut up.</br>  <br>And there's this faggot.</br>  <br>Almost forgot about this. I thought they'd reveal Nagare's design in the anime as some sort of surprise and not earlier.</br>  <br>He's as ugly as Sousuke still better than FMP Sousuke though.</br>  Thanks to the anon that mentioned Gakuen Ouji last thread. Shit's crazy. Nobunaga a shit but he has some serious homolust.  <br>So which Sousuke were you thinking of? Because this Sousuke is pretty cute too.</br>  <br> You're welcome! </br>  <br><br>He's wearing a dress. He's just holding side of it out.</br></br>  <br>He's better as a shota.</br>  <br>Already mentioned dumbass.</br>  <br>You haven't posted him yet.</br>  <br><br>Everyone is better as shota duh</br></br>  <br>Most bad boys are.</br>  <br>I thought it was strange too. He has a really cool design though. along with his priest and shota. Sorta wish Munakata didn't beat him to the punch of making Fushimi a clansmen. He would have fit in well with the greens.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>REJOICE</br>  <br>So it WAS Aizen all along!</br>  <br>Deaf moe is cute.</br>  <br>That's some Aizen tier trolling right there.</br>  <br> Kotomine is now the same voice of another Best Priest. </br>  <br>No you're Aizen!</br>  <br>I don't think he's moe but Nic sure is hot.</br>  <br> MFW he speaks. <br><br>I never thought having a speech impediment could be so sexy.</br></br></br>  What do I say to people who think having more than one husbando is perfectly fine?  <br>Call them a slut.</br>  <br>I call them out for the sluts that they are.</br>  <br>You join them.</br>  <br>Tell them not to use words they don't understand.</br>  <br>Leave them to their delusions and then go back to feeding your husbando.</br>  <br>It's perfectly fine.</br>  <br><br>Slut</br></br>  <br><br>You cum guzzling whores.</br></br>  I didn't like this that much but the new cover is so nice I'm tempted to buyfag it.  <br><br>I love cumming in my pure husbandos.</br></br>  <br> husbandos <br>Don't use words you don't understand.</br></br>  <br>I thought I was the only one who didn't like the story. Art's nice though.</br>  <br>Tell them having more than one husbando will ruin their laifusbando.</br>  <br>I love all my husbandos.</br>  <br>Or more than one husbando is a bad endo.</br>  <br>I would've liked it better if Shun hadn't been such a shit. <br>Mio getting character development out of nowhere didn't help either. He lost a lot of charm.</br></br>  The staff really, really likes these guys. This episode had a bunch of anime-original touchy-feely shenanigans. <br>I'm dying to know what they're doing in the pot in the ED since they're facing away from the viewer.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277298 <br>The on-topic one.<br><br> Fuck that's lewd. </br></br></br>  <br>Lewd swords are best swords.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277298 <br>The one that belongs in /vg--<br>oh wait your swordshit general is dead because your game fucking sucks.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277298 <br>Kill those abominations.</br>  I didn't expect to like this guy as much as I do now. I can't wait for his suffering to begin.  <br>I didn't expect to like any character, or even the show itself, as much as I do. Truly glad I picked it up.</br>  It was  okay.   <br>Same here. Even  imouto  is growing on me.</br>  <br>I like him too, the sol scenes with the teleportation guy and him are great. The whole cast is really nice to watch.</br>  <br>Alright, I'll bite.</br>  <br><br>What's the target audience for this show? I was expecting the two guys to get paired up with the girls but it feels more like the two guys and the two girls are getting paired up among themselves.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/833992/2c2c79<wbr>6cd7/</wbr>  <br>Megane's autism is so endearing.</br>  <br>Might be omnipandering.  I know this isn't the thread for this, and I'm usually no yurifag, but I have to say that the two girls seem cute together. Kind of wish it were real rather than just ED fanservice. <br><br><br> I can't figure out which one is more dominant. <br>I think it's pretty clear, since Kaito barely acts his age and Nagisa pretty much curbstomps his enthusiasm given the slightest chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dropped CG but moeducer was really a gem boy there. Glad he got noticed.</br>  <br>I hope we have time for his backstory.<br><br>By the way, are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones?</br></br></br>  <br>I am, but first I need to learn how.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure, if fujoshi jump on this, Kaito will be the one on top.</br>  <br>I never saw HS for this one so I don't how they compare, but subs for every other HS show have been pretty shitty, so I'm sure these are better.</br>  i waited 3 months to see this moe face again, and i was not disappointed  <br>Is this shit still being translated?</br>  <br> are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones? <br>I haven't seen CR's script aside from the pastebin with the mistranslations from episode 1, but judging from that I'd call the other option better.</br></br>  <br>That one's the sequel, so no. <br>Someone's typesetting the old one right now, don't know if it's completed yet.</br></br>  <br>Going to buyfag it for the art. I'm probably going to buyfag all her works.</br>  <br> To be honest the suffering was the only reason I picked up the manga.</br>  Please tell me this semen demon shows up again at some point.  <br> Everyone in this story returns at some point. <br>Also Obi is best girl.</br></br>    <br>Here I thought I wouldn't feel the need to watch this show after reading the manga, but I'm almost changing my mind just because of their increased screentime.</br>  I'll post some Kyoani boys from specials who still hot no screen time but was mentioned    Why did I wait so long to start watching this?  <br>If you like the manga enough to stay current, you'll like everything JC Staff is doing with the anime. You have Shouji and Daigo's cheerleading scenes in the election, which I'm sure are going to be embellished, to look forward to as well.</br>  <br>Are any new films or pretty much anything coming out anytime soon?</br>  <br>Is he autistic? I felt really sorry for him. He'll forever exist only in this short, lacking personality, blowing at cats on his window sill. It's almost as if the viewer is a figment of his imagination.</br>  <br><br>I like KnK's designs for boys better.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277298 <br> Nakigitsune <br><br>Thanks for the update anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked how Kyoani colored the hair in KnK, but my favorite were Hyouka's designs.</br>  <br>You are still on time to sweat together over precious Shokugeki boys.</br>  <br>Kind of wish the series had a couple more guys in it, I still haven't gotten around to watching it because it seems like a lot of yuribait drama.<br><br><br> I think of him as being like a stoner NEET.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The bodies in Shokugeki are deliciously drawn. I had originally dropped it due to lack of time, but I've picked it back the fuck up after seeing all these screencaps.</br>  <br>So I assume you don't know about the new ending</br>  <br> fagotto </br>  <br>I still want Isshiki and Souma to fuck.</br>  <br>It's probably a toss up between the two for me when it comes to character designs. For actual character personalities, though, Hyouka wins for me.  S2 never. ;_; <br><br> "select all ice cream" <br> only gives me pictures of sorbet <br>Goddammit, Google.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>best instrument</br>  <br>I liked how Soma's dad was utterly unfazed by how Isshiki walks around in nothing but an apron. I get the impression Polar Star is like a breeding ground for weirdoes.</br>  <br><br>I want to molest all Kyoani boys.</br></br>  <br>The yuribait is  great  and isolated into a couple scenes. The rest is just regular friendship. <br>The series is plot heavy and drama is always related to the brass band club, save for one episode.</br></br>  <br>Well, despite what Hibike threads said while watching this I hadn't got the feeling there is yuri there or my yuri googles wasn't strong enough to see romance between fem characters, but indeed there was friendship, idolizing and appreciating. <br>Also it is really rare for Kyoani shows but the drama was surprisingly fine and didn't felt like overreacting about stupid things.<br>It was about  having leading solo in competition's performance everybody trained really hard for. </br></br></br>  What's the homoest non homo show you've ever seen? Any Gundam does not count, or any mecha for that matter.  <br> image <br>What is this anon?</br></br>  <br>  No Gundam or any mecha <br><br>Fine then.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Evangelion technically isn't a mecha</br>  <br>I guess Texhnolyze or Shigurui. <br>The amount of genuine gay both had was pretty surprising.</br></br>    <br>Hunter x Hunter</br>  <br>I need to go watch some more shows with bromance.</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=<wbr>1509618<br> They're from this artist but I'm not sure if they're musician OCs or some kind of instrument gijinka.</br></wbr></br>  <br>he said non homo</br>  <br>HxH is non-homo. Togashi intended it as a pure friendship.</br>  <br> dat bari sax <br>I'd empty that guy's spit valve, if you know what I mean.</br></br>  <br>You should have exclude sports series too.</br>  <br>Wanted to post it </br>    <br>Nice rec request.</br>  <br>Don't be so slut, Kise.</br>  <br>Dio the moest</br>  <br>I wonder why Araki made him look like a lesbian after drained Joseph. Regular Banana DIO looks better.</br>  What's going on here?  <br>A not-so-secret discussion over whether or not to rape Marui once he's unconscious.</br>  <br>Discussion of country grown vegetables.</br>  <br>I want to  hug_  Ceylan tenderly</br>  <br><br>Those are rather different.</br></br>  Will everything be okay in the end?  <br>With those two, their conversations can range far and wide.</br>  <br>No, because bitches will ruin anything and the omnipandering roach who created this series won't kill them off.</br>  <br>Getbackers is really fucking gay without actually being gay.</br>  <br>Someone's mad.</br>  <br>Never 4get.</br>  <br>Mika was Yuu's family first. That has to count for something, right? If Shinoa canonly won the Yuu it'd be like she slipped into Mika's yard and stole the fruit from the tree he's put all his effort into growing for all these years. It'd be too cruel.</br>  Nagisa's thighs  <br>It's not cheating if they have the same VA</br>  <br> It'd be too cruel. <br>Sounds just like Kagami. But more importantly this is a shounen magazine. If there is any actual romance it will be with the main girl.</br></br>  <br> serious homo end <br>Remind yourself how many times that has happened.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember Shinoa/Yuu being implied as hard in the manga as it was in the anime. Do I just have selective memory or did WIT up the hetero.</br>  <br>I'm not asking for a homo end, just one where Shinoa doesn't undeniably win. Something nice and open-ended and easy on the imagination is all I need.</br>  <br>Indeed, hence my nomination of it in 's post.</br>  <br>I keep putting off finishing the manga, it's a shame where the anime left off and best boy couldn't be animated.</br>  <br>I am. I'm weary of being tormented by cowardly writers and studios. After the Aldnoah Zero not-ending, I'm after full-on homo ends now. Being teased is no longer enough.</br>  <br>That hair looks so bad. Who finds that attractive?</br>  <br>But anon, best boy was animated.</br>  <br>The early '00s were a time of strange things.</br>  <br>Those are still common choices in video game hair selection, so clearly people who like them haven't been properly exterminated yet.</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I'd love a legitimately homo end, but I know it'll never happen. More than anything I just want Kagami to stop relentlessly shitting on every aspect of Mika's life and let him be cared for the most by the person he cares for the most in turn. That's the absolute least he deserves for all he's been through.</br>  <br>I think they gave her a few more scenes. And the fanbase is extremely vocal so it makes it look even more serious.</br>  <br>The official art for this show always got me.<br><br>I'm still mad with what happened with Kagami and I can't hate that 'two seconds' guy.<br><br> You will never share a body with six of your brothers. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because it's fujobait. Blatant, 90s fujobait.</br>  <br>Either way, I can't stand her and I want some vampire to suck her dry and then piss in her skull.</br>  <br>where's the raw for this? I want to translate it.</br>  <br>Slightly bigger.</br>  <br>The official art was great. It went from casual like pic related to almost shameless sluttiness.</br>  <br><br>I remember watching this anime because of the gay art and in the end I thought it wasn't even that gay<br>Same thing with Trinity Blood, damn this artist and my dumb young self</br></br></br>  <br>The art trolled a lot of people, but it wasn't like it was a boring series. Sure, the ending was ambiguous as usual but it didn't take a brain surgeon to figure out Ban and Ginji were basically a married couple.</br>  <br>Karma's ass</br>  <br>A poor married couple.<br><br> taking showers in sprinklers  <br> sleeping in a car <br> sleeping on benches  <br> begging for food <br><br>It was a lot of fun, now I want to rewatch it.<br><br>The third ed, where they moved a little closer and the fourth ed I had no idea what the hell was going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice! I wish Hamatora had been this good.</br>  <br>Mika gets only suffering from his families. This time is not exception.</br>  <br>Shared adversity is all part of the package deal. After the reams of shit they went through across the scope of the series, nothing's breaking those two up.</br>  <br>Shinoa is letting him borrow Yuu currently but we all know  he will die in the end for being an expat of the human race </br>   decide to read Reborn <br> like Yamato and Enma <br> Chrom is cute <br> don't see what people see in Hibari, prince or those other fags <br> still reading more, quality going down hill and everywhere <br> for some reason start liking Hibari and don't know why <br><br>On a different note, I have no idea what the hell is going on anymore in DGM, it's nice that Hoshino has come back but I am quite confused still after trying to re-read things here and there. <br><br>I don't get why people say it's fujo now, maybe aside the fact that Kanada's waifu was given a penis but I don't see it. Those outfits were lewd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I had read a little of the manga beforehand and recall it being a pretty heavy on the female fanservice, so I was a bit surprised when I eventually saw the anime's official art.</br>  <br>Titmonster Hevn was a bit of a smokescreen, but it became pretty apparent early on that she was basically just static noise and every freak and weirdo in town was trying to pry Ban and Ginji apart for their own little agendas and that was going to be the crux of the series: those two vs the world.</br>  <br>I just want to see Ceylan and Guren   hug  </br>  Soon  <br> a microman in a power suit <br>Somehow this triggered my fetish sensors.

The <br> I'm only gay for you <br>thing gets tired very very quickly if you ask me, it's just lazy writing so the boys can conveniently fall in love whilst still being "available" to the straight women reading.<br><br><br>Yes, it's only good for shit like the corn.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Monochrome Factor <br><br><br>Unfortunately.<br><br>The OP was pretty good though.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SLH<wbr>nxM0lE3Q</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I remember thinking how weird it was that they didn't have noses. How times have changed since then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant for<br/></br>  <br>No I mean how next to every poster here decides to be more vague than necessarily and use homo which says especially little as an adjective. Historically it could as well mean Code Geass level. If a character is "actually homo" as in "actually loves men in general and only men" it's better to call it what it is.</br>  <br>Homo sounds more amusing than gay, and usually the characters in question aren't officially gay regardless of what they end up doing.</br>  Did we ever get any mob Oikawa doujins?  <br>I want to get mauled by this taiga</br>  <br>Fuck off sjw.</br>  <br>U gay</br>  <br> you will never abuse shota Mika <br><br>How terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to maul his boypussy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128300779 <br>Hello newfag, welcome to the homothread and enjoy your stay.</br>  <br><br>Did it ended for good?

He should never do the fucking. <br><br><br> Not him actually. Pastebinanon.  </br></br></br></br>  <br>That seems really subdued for some reason<br>I'd always imagined it to be more of a jingle</br></br>  <br>JoJo rule of doujins: If it's not gay, it doesn't exist.</br>  <br>You underestimate just how little practice Joseph's had at that point.<br><br>He makes up for it by being a slut later, but at that point you would NOT want a deep kiss from him.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you, all I want to see is a Hotpants and Johnny doujinshi. I'm at the point where I'd literally pay money for one.<br> Johnny deserves to not be the bottom once in his life </br></br>  <br> I'm at the point where I'd literally pay money for one. <br>What's stopping you?<br>Anything can be bought and sold for the right oil</br></br></br>   I summon that one green and red monster and attack your monster. <br> The attack points of your monster reduce your life points <br> I win lol <br>Every single duel, holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Arc-V is hype as fuck</br>  <br>The only reason it's not higher is because we don't have enough of it. This train could derail at any point.</br>  <br>Yea but Arc-V introduces Dennis like halfway through. Dennis is everything we want Yuya to be:<br><br>Good entertainer<br>Non idiotic looking deck (OHHH enterntainment hippo and wolf and waterstrider. Fuck you shit deck Yuya.)<br>Better hair<br>Overall cooler.<br><br>That made me angry because now I want Dennis as the MC instead of shit Yuya.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>can't wait for fusion dimension and XYZ dimension arc</br>  <br> tfw i love dm season 3 because villain is a digital shota <br>Deckmasters were really cool too and you got to see characters besides the mains duel.</br></br>    <br>honk a shit</br>  What comes next? Rickert dying? Sayonara ship? place your bets, anon!  <br> Rickert dying <br>NO!</br></br>  <br>We'll get to see how Erica is raped to death, so get hyped!</br>  Nothing. <br>They will continue in the boat, we wll get a comical episode where Guts learns to fish. Hi-la-ri-ous!</br>  <br>AND he'll learn there are plenty more fish in the sea</br>  <br> mfw there are people who waited years for the new chapter  <br> mfw there are people who died waiting for it <br> mfw I won't wait one fucking day </br></br></br>  <br> Mfw asuka is worst girl <br>Faggots being faggots, what else can I expect?</br></br>  <br>I want Berserk to have more SoL elements</br>  <br>I tnk retard casca is best casca</br>   morons are speculating again   <br>Welcome back Shitposter-kun</br>  Griffith talking.

So I can't wait.  Griffith sipping more tea like a faggot. You know it's true.  <br><br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>But have you seen how beautiful he looks?</br>  If it's still in Falconia,<br> Griffith dicksuckers (Sonia in particular) anally annihilated by Rickert, attempt retaliation <br> Griffith reflecting on how much he would like Guts' penis up his butthole <br> Princess perhaps realizing that all the demons and shit around isn't kosher, or just continuing to suck Griffith's dick like Sonia </br></br></br>  http://strawpoll.me/4962329  <br> being a homosexual <br> any year </br></br>  <br> mfw Guts somwhow ends up alone separated from his friends for the next five years </br>  <br>you're such a dumb boy!</br>    <br>this is a sick joke</br>  <br>This</br>  <br> he doesn't realize that it's a ship <br>You're a moron.</br></br>  <br>This is the captcha that came up when I posted the boat yesterday.

What were her last thoughts?</br>  <br>imagine if your neck was cut off and the amount of signals your senses were sending to your brain<br>Fuck with griffits is probably similar that your brain just gets flooded with signals and goes into a shock.</br></br>  <br> this isn't half bad actually </br>  <br> Dick...too...bomb </br>  <br>Do you think Casca still has a muscular back? Or has she's been out of fighting shape too long now?</br>  <br>considering how little activity she does and she eats whatever is put in front of her her physique would resemble average /v/ user</br>  Explain this  <br>He's losing his head</br>  <br>then explain THIS</br>  <br>Dang. This is NOT congruent with my fetishes.</br>  <br> implying she's a fat neckbeard </br>  <br> Berserker wants to rage but his waifu won't let him </br>  Griffith fapping to being humiliated in front of his followers by a femboy.  <br>Oh shit</br>  <br>I have a feeling Sonia is going to join Guts &amp; Friends once she learns the truth about her living idol</br>  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it   You will never rub yourself over Farnese's face   <br>Why isn't serpico killing puck?</br>  <br>Puck isn't supposed to die.</br>  <br>You have such a good hand... why waste it on that Griffith cuck?</br>  <br>I'm not the original artist you fag  I just appreciate best ship </br>  <br> Savor the taste <br><br>Holy shit I forgot how great Puck can be sometimes.<br>I really want to go back to Guts and friends now.</br></br></br></br>  I actually thought Miura had reused Sonia in the second panel before putting them together and noticing the subtle details.

Wtf?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128283519 <br>I might have shit memory but I'm quite sure the comedic faces have always been used, I think Griffith and Casca did that sometimes back in Golden Age.</br>  <br><br>Fags fighting</br></br>  <br>It's her fucking child holy shit do you people not pay attention<br>Owait im being 'trolled' again</br></br>  <br> considering how little activity she does and she eats whatever is put in front of her her physique would resemble average /v/ user <br>In all seriousness, assuming you've worked out really hard during younger years, puberty and so on that affects your metabolism for the rest of your life. Someone who is a giant fatass in highschool is always going to have trouble not matter what they do and vice versa, someone in great shape will lock in a certain amount of that. Consider her long periods of poor food between heavy meals and the massive amount of walking they all have to do she'd lose a ton of muscle mass but she would not get fat.</br></br>  <br>Please, don't reply to me like that. I am waiting for a response from this asshole who told me not to reply to him a certain way. I doubt he'll respond to me. He's fucked off.

The game all adults play. </br></br></br></br>  <br>What makes you think Erica is going to die next chapter? You are one of the weirdest users.</br>  <br> next chapter <br>Oh, no, of course not.<br>Next chapter is going to be, again, about how Falconia is awesome. Perhaps just Rickert working and Erica having fun. She's not going to die next chapter, obviously.<br><br>First comes the crowning, then the wedding then the consummation of the marriage. Then Erica will die.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guts and Griffith fight <br> Rickerts there watching <br>  shit happens <br>  a behelit rolls over to him <br>  shit gets real <br>  Eclipse 2.0 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>But Rickert has no reason to use a behelit</br>  <br>Why is serpico so hot?</br>  <br>what would modern casca singing sound like?</br>  <br>it's the fox eyes</br>  <br>Royal blood</br>  <br><br>why won't farnese tap that?</br></br>  <br>too busy learning to draw apples in her mind or some shit</br>   next chapter has them get off the island <br> "Wow, that took no time at all!" </br>  <br>She wanted to but he turned her down.</br>  <br>Fuck, I meant get on the island.</br>  <br>bastard swag</br>  <br>But he loves her</br>  I've forgot the majority of Berserk's plot up until now<br><br>It's been so long</br></br>  <br> why won't farnese tap that? <br>Did you forget her whole background chapters anon? She very much wanted to tap that but he said no.</br></br>  <br>incest is bad m'kay?</br>  <br>He doesn't want children with 11 toes. Which probably wouldn't be too out of place in the Berserk universe but they're still related.<br><br>Otherwise he'd probably be DTF.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't he in love with her though?</br>  <br>Doesn't matter. He probably realizes that since their father knows about how they're actually related that it would only cause trouble. Besides, Serpico still cares for her deeply, he just wouldn't put his dick in her. And can you really blame him? Bitch is crazy.</br>  Wait, I thought Berserk getting updates was just us memeing again.<br><br>It's really happening is it? I guess after all this time of little to no updates I've become jaded that I can't even summon any excitement for it anymore.</br></br>  What if the next chapter is the boat sinking and nobody can do anything about it?  <br>We're getting a 100 page chapter in a little more than a week and it will continue from there with monthly updates.</br>  <br>He's always aware of how Farnese looks at Guts...it hurts him.

Did void give Femto a tour of everything after the eclipse? Do any of them care that the newbie is doing all this kind of crazy stuff in the physical plane?  <br>It's one of the spirits of the dead children that Rosine had turned in to pseudo elves</br>  <br>loli witch is a miracle of the universe.</br>  Why hasnt farnisse fucked anyone yet<br>even schierke was closer to getting laid</br>  <br>She fucked herself right?<br><br>Also are the single issue Berserks anywhere translated? Only ones I can find are 334 and 335</br></br></br>  <br>Welp they are in Mangafox all of them but that quality, also who has translated these? Are they crap?</br>  Rewatching the anime and this was the most fucked up moment first time seeing it  before ever reading the manga   <br>http://mangafox.me/manga/berserk/v3<wbr>8/c335/16.html<br>shows who translated</br></wbr></br>  <br>Forgot the picture ofc</br>  Is Gut's eye sewn shut?  <br>I'm pretty sure he just has the reflex down pat.</br>   Re-reading Berserk. <br> Having a great time. <br> Enjoying the funny moments with the Band. <br> Eclipse <br> "Oh right, the murders." <br> Become incredibly sad watching Guts watch all his friends get ripped in half, Gaston's head explode from the inside out. <br> And everything else. <br><br>On the bright side, you can literally pin-point the moment Gut's rage kicks in to MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.<br><br><br> Casca a cute. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i just assumed it was the nerves/muscles being dead or whatever</br>  Given this a try for like 3 times but just cannot get past the opening scene with horrible CGI<br>Should I just bite my lip and go through with them?</br>  <br>the third movie is the only decent one<br>but they cut out two of the best parts, the sex scene, and WYALD THE GRAND MAGICAL RAPIST</br></br>  <br>they're what got me onto Berserk in the first place, but they don't really do it proper justice<br><br>i wouldn't bother</br></br></br>  Whatever happens I won't be discussing it with you lot. These threads are cancer and show the average reader of Berserk today is a complete utter shonenfag moron. I hope Deepfag doesn't do something stupid, like comeback to you retards.  <br>O shit son</br>  I hope we will know more about this guy  <br>why is his true form doggystyling a deer?</br>  <br>Because Miura draws his fantasms</br>   5 days until new chapter gets released <br> No leaks <br><br>Holy shit, I just want to know about what will be covering.</br></br></br>  <br>Miura here, Casca dies.</br>  <br>so how did he even end up in prison?<br><br>Obviously he went in willingly, did he just do it because he thought it would be fun?</br></br></br>  <br>Excitement and enjoyment!</br>  <br>zach here<br>thanks man</br></br>  <br>You've never raped anyone in your life.</br>  <br>Back the fuck off?!</br>  <br>Daily reminder that we must all become Cascafags in order to dispel the tripfag threat.

Witches and wizards also train there, while Schierke speaks of elves that can predict the future. All of Griffith's apostle army were focused on fighting Ganishka anyway, even if they were told to burn down Elfhelm they'd probably take the time to shipwreck the jRPG party in the process.<br><br>tl;dr - Anons are retarded to think that the island is just some sitting duck for demons.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the moon child Guts and Caska's son?</br>  <br>No, he might be either:<br> Griffith's son <br>or<br> A guide sent by The Elf King. </br></br></br></br>  <br>That is also possible. I like to go both ways by speculating that the Elf King gives the soul of Guts and Casca's child a blessed body during nights of the full moon in order to steer the former on the right path. Whatever it may be, the child certainly has no demonic aura, which Griffith cannot help but give off.<br><br> Why do some anons spell her name as Caska? Do you drink alcohol from her? </br></br></br>  <br>It was as its best between 14 and 19.</br>  <br> it's those dastardly Hawk scans, i get it mixed some sometimes as well </br>  <br>Casca is what we call Easter here, and it's the exact same pronunciation as well.  Skellig is also an island off our coast, coincidence? </br>  <br>There's also Easter island<br><br>It's like poetry</br></br></br>  <br>If you see this post while scrolling this thread, you have been visited by the Berserk world's true lord and savior. The ability to count to behelits will come to you, but only if you post CASCA BEST GIRL on this thread.</br>    <br>What panel is that upper right image from?</br>  <br>i forget, one of the ones when they fug</br>    <br>nice</br>  <br>Rape</br>  5 DAYS UNTIL NEW CHAPTER<br>ARE YOU GUYS READY?</br>  <br>CASCA BEST GIRL</br>  <br>How long will it take until a translated version is released? <br><br>Or am I gonna have to learn Japanese?</br></br></br>  <br>a day at most</br>  <br>It doesn't take long for an anon fluent in moonspeak to come along and translate it for us, but it can take up to two weeks for Evil Genius to release a proper scanlation.</br>  <br><br>Alright, good to hear</br></br>   Guts gets off the boat <br> gets a new powerup and throws the berserker armour in the trash <br> Caska regains her memory and still loves Guts <br> &gt;you wake up </br></br></br>  <br>It's not her child anymore</br>  <br>Still has baby blood, which caused him to involuntarily save her. Too bad Griffith only wants a meal ticket.</br>  <br>I'm calling it, Casca will become Griffith's only weakness.<br>Oh the irony.</br></br>  This was one of the best fucking pages ever made in manga. Damn miura, DAMN yu.  <br> Casca must die for Guts to defeat Griffith <br> Guts insists on finding another way <br> Casca sacrifices herself <br><br>nothing would prepare me for this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why are her arms trying to hug him? is she enjoying it?</br>  <br>Kamiyan should voice him.</br>  <br>Of course. She even kissed him back.<br>Griffith became an expert at it after all. Add to that the fact she's always been madly in love with him.<br>I think part of why she's so fucked up now is because she enjoyed the rape in front of her lover. She became the bitch she always knew she were.<br>The shame and disgust was too much for anyone to handle.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally copypasta from the 3-Gatsu Lion spread tribute <br><br>Lazy faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> She became the bitch she always knew she were. <br>You're taking this a little far. Why do you hate Casca so much?</br></br>  <br>She always knew it mang</br>  <br>I think that anon was trying to insinuate that Casca would cause Griffith to hesitate if he were about to land the killing blow on Guts during the final battle, which would allow Guts to finish him off once and for all.<br><br>Then they have sex over his dead body.<br><br><br>It's just bait. People have been raging over the rape for decades. Even I, the honorable Cascafag, had the same problem, but then I had the best fap in ages to it and saw the light. Now I just tell people that Casca can give you more orgasms than the average hentai, but don't go fapping to webm related.<br><br> b-but Cascafag, that doesn't sound right <br><br>It doesn't really matter if she enjoyed it or not. If she did, then I wouldn't really blame her for it, wise magical rape raven and all that. If she didn't, then Femto can give the Rapeman a run for his money. We should just want what's best for her at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Guts... He is literally perfect in every way.</br>  <br>Casca would never attack Griffith though. She'd probably kill herself if he dies because of her.</br>  <br>Why does Casca look whiter in the movies than in the manga?</br>  <br> Caska <br><br>le trashman face</br></br></br>   trying to stream Golden Age Arc 3 <br> can't go full screen <br><br>HELP</br></br></br>  <br>Post the rest</br>  <br>Now, here's the thing people take too far - Casca's worship of Griffith. They all say she'll return to him or attempt to justify the Hawks' sacrifice, but she recognizes Griffith's betrayal during the Eclipse and asks him (obviously with no response) if this was "the nightmare you wanted". When most of Casca's plot during the Golden Age was her trying to accept herself as more than just a pawn under Griffith's thumb, it'd be kinda boring for her to to take a step back. I'd prefer for her to come to terms with the reality of her situation, connect with the rest of the group and attempt to talk Guts out of his suicide mission against Griffith. Obviously it won't work, but with Griffith and Charlotte having tea parties in Falconia they could also take some time out to recuperate and train for the fight back.<br>Making progress, moving forward, growing stronger, these would be good things for her character. Even if she did want to come back, it's too far, she doesn't know where he is, and the amount of Apostles around Falconia would result in her dying instantly.<br><br><br>Because Studio 4c are hacks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First you should  kill yourself </br>    <br>Did you miss the part where she literally prefers Griffith over Guts and her desire to change went to hell because Griffith is all she's ever lived for?</br>  <br>http://kissanime.com/Anime/Berserk-<wbr>The-Golden-Age-Arc-III-The-Advent-D<wbr>ub here you go anon</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I feel like Red Saber and Wyald would get n pretty well.</br>    I wish there were Mongolian Nomads in Berserk. <br><br>I like to see how Guts can fight off horse archers.</br></br>    <br> Making progress, moving forward, growing stronger, these would be good things for her character. Even if she did want to come back, it's too far, she doesn't know where he is, and the amount of Apostles around Falconia would result in her dying instantly. <br> Casca nad Guts fighting together again <br>I need this to happpen</br></br></br>  <br>That was a textbook bros before hoes situation. You'd have to be a major cunt to run off with your lover when the guy who brought you up from nothing is a few bits of skin away from being a spooky skeleton. However, now Griffith is back to full power, he doesn't need her anymore, and Guts and Casca have now unknowingly fulfilled their promise of running away together.<br><br>tl;dr: lrn2plot</br></br></br>    <br>post this one</br>  <br>Did you forget the part where Casca called Griffith her dream and she still couldn't her over her jealousy despite having Guts?</br>    Reminder that Miss Luca is best girl  aight imma find that page  <br>You mean the part that's being dumped now? The one with the shitty Hawk scans? I think it's very realistic for her to not immediately "get over" Griffith, and courageous to admit these feelings to Guts. A part of Casca will always love Griffith, but that doesn't wash out her love for Guts. The two of them are equals.<br><br> no more nitpicking pls <br><br><br>Luca is a woman, not a girl. Show more respect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No, I mean this part.<br><br>You know what? I'll go and make a college just for you.</br></br></br>    <br>Nobody will trust collages based on shitty Hawk scans. Go on Bakabt and download the proper stuff, then get back to me.</br>  <br>the message gets across for crying out loud, don't be dense and accept Casca never stopped loving Griffith.</br>    <br> Such differences in dialogue! Hawks scans fucking sucksss <br><br>I know it's a thread meme by now but it gets old when you are told they don't help to support your claims</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, I said that. Casca would always love Griffith, deep down, but it's the kind of unconditional love anybody would have towards him for saving their life and honing them into a strong, proud warrior. You're dense to think that Casca can't think of anyone else, that Griffith is the only person she cares about.</br>  I'm 30-35 chapters away from the last one, does Guts appearence ever improve? Man he's completely destroyed just look at his face.<br><br>I'm legit feeling sad for him although I've felt sad for him ever since golden arc but this is going off the charts.<br><br><br>Not only that but he seems to start getting signals that he's getting blind due to the armor. I can't see this ending well.<br><br><br>Caska is also starting to piss me the fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judeau is cute</br>    I'm still mad there are no RAPE HORSE doujins.  <br>She realizes there's a difference in worship and love, anon. Read here<br><br>What she feels for him is deep-rooted love. And this will never change, because it's what shaped her as a person, it's the core of her character. Even after having lost her virginity to Guts, even after having him deciding to stay with her, she still prefered they part ways. In the end, her love for Griffith was greater than anything.<br>And even when she yells at him "this is the nightmare you wished for?" you can see desperation in her face, but not anger, even if what Griffith did what all she cared about ath the moment.<br>There's never anger in her, not even when she's being raped, not a single "damn you".</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>somehow, yes. i guess magic can heal burnscars.</br>  <br>Guts is best piggyback</br>  <br> those thighs <br>damn grffith u luckyyy</br></br>      Where were you when Casca realized where her heart belonged?    <br>What do you think about Skull Knight being Emperor Gaiseric theory?</br>  <br>He'll be a full-blown cripple by the time he gets off the boat at this rate.</br>  <br>It's obvious.</br>  <br>Not as beautiful as Guts.</br>  Who's this kid?  <br>small oopsie</br>  <br>Guts' bastard child.</br>  <br>PLEASE</br>  Wait...is that a...  What would Griffith do if he saw Casca again?<br><br>Apologize?</br></br>  <br>ye, who the fuck is he? He just dissapeared and we were never told shit about him ever again.<br><br>I'm guessing he's the elf king or some shit</br></br></br>  <br> There's never anger in her, not even when she's being raped, not a single "damn you". <br><br>I think that may have more to do the fact that she's barely conscious.<br><br>Anyway, seeing as you refuse to see how important Casca's love and acceptance of Guts is for her as well as him, there's no point in continuing this argument, everyone knows Casca x Farnese is the canon ending.<br><br><br>I don't understand what this image is trying to convey. I told you not to use the shitty Hawk scans, but nobody listens to the Cascafag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Take that motherfucker out of my sight.<br><br>This is how beautiful real man look.</br></br></br>  <br>i think it's reincarnated flor</br>  Who did it better?  <br>here's the DH one if you want<br><br>for best woman</br></br></br>  <br> I think that may have more to do the fact that she's barely conscious. <br>She still managed to say "don't look", anon.</br></br>  <br>I love how there are little details like that. In most things, they might describe how the protagonist's abilities/equipment fuck them up in some way or another, but short of being bisected or something the small things never get shown.</br>  <br>This is beuty</br>  <br>It's the behelit and Casca's child</br>  <br><br> that what have I done face <br><br>hngh my heart</br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot, she said no a few times as well. Pic related is when she sees Guts being mauled by demons after trying to rescue her.</br>  poor Guts    <br>He was asking for it tbh.</br>    Was there anything better than Rickert slapping Griffith?<br><br>Miura still has it, gang. This is the greatest series of all time.</br></br>  I've been re-reading the last arc, and I forgot just how many glorious two-page spreads of Falconia Miura drew. No wonder this shit takes months, what the fuck - he's more or less architected the entire city layout.    <br>Does anyone else cringe when they see insanely detailed pages like this in Berserk because of how long it must of took? <br>I don't mean cringe in a bad way but I just feel like oh shit that must of took forever.</br></br>  <br> both Guts and Casca were asking for it <br> they're both branded <br><br>Genuinely made for each other. Griffith x Casca fuckers have been BTFO'd for years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet she still came</br>  <br><br>Fuck this! I'm more angry than before!</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, all the time. I know it's an incredibly popular and well-received series, but it still feels like Miura goes under appreciated.<br><br>Spreads like that take so goddamn long, I can't imagine how much it must hurt to make progress and realize you messed up something and need to do it over.</br></br></br>  <br>You sure it isn't 90% by assistants?</br>  <br>Griffith came, and you're shit at collages. Kill yourself.<br><br><br>People like you are the reason these shitheads keep posted. Stop getting baited.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. The last couple chapters in Falconia are doubly ridiculous on that front - he'll put anywhere from 5-6 of these motherfuckers in one chapter, all with the same level of detail.</br>  <br> Griffith came,  <br>So did Casca, look at her. She's wetter than an otter's pocket.</br></br>  <br>You think what's dripping on the floor is Griffith's cum? KEK</br>  <br>You guys are less cynical than I am. I respect the effort it takes for something like this, but I think he and his team do so many of them because they're not sure where the story is going.<br><br>They're just filling up space.</br></br></br>  <br> wetter than an otter's pocket <br><br><br> using kek <br><br>No, it's Slan's cum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most girls just get normally wet in intercourse without even squirting.</br>  <br>Griffith hadn't come yet when Miura focused on Casca's trembling foot and the love juice on the floor, anon.<br>Casca came, and she came hard.</br></br>  <br>Do you hate her for it?</br>  anyone else think that other manga miura drew with the muscly fat guy drinking the loli her pussyjuices to heal? Made him seem very pedo  <br>That's so not true. In order to get wet, you must get horny. Believe me, if it's something you absolutely don't want there's no way you'll get wet, only repulsed and nervous as fuck which will make your walls tense the fuck up, which difficults the penetration. Thus, making everything hurtful and awful. You can't cum under such circumstances, you can only feel pain.</br>  <br>Miura does not use many assistants</br>  <br>Of course not, Casca is my favorite girl and I don't try to make her something she's not and ignore all her flaws. I love her for what she is.</br>  <br>So was it five angels or four?<br><br>Also are they the Godhand we already know?</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't even last a minute.</br>  <br>Rickert wasn't even raped and rejected the new Griffith. Why people think that Casca would come back after being raped into retardation is beyond me.</br>  <br>Will the heavens destroy Giffith's city?</br>  <br>I am aware, but you talk like fluids directly mean orgasm.</br>  <br>Because she loves him and his dream. She understand that the end justifies the means, she was prepared for anything, anon.</br>  <br>Her body is pretty much excited. I mean, wet is normal. But dripping wet? that's something else. You just have to look at her, she trembles and drools at the end.</br>  <br>You should be kinder to the anons who are still sensitive about it, then. Not everyone has no name's fetish for rape.<br><br><br>Is this the face of being prepared for anything?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. But then again, it was a fucked up situation, not even Griffith saw it coming. <br>But of one thing I'm certain, she was prepared to die for him. If she were to understand what the fuck happened, if Griffith were to explain what all that was about I'm 100% Casca would understand him and even forgive him.</br></br>  Well, congratulations Griffith! You just take Midland Kingdom! Now what's the next step in your master plan?  <br>Casca was raped, bloodied and full of demonsemen even beofre Griffith touched her.</br>  <br>Crashing this boat.</br>  <br>I'm the only person who thinks rape is far better than dying?</br>  <br> She understand that the end justifies the means <br>She watched everyone she care for die, and was raped by her idol in front who made her lover watch. <br>Even Casca can't be that devoted to overlook it all in favour of Griffith.</br></br></br>  <br>But not wet, anon. Only bloody.</br>  <br>To be subjected to so much pain for him and still want him in the end would say a lot about Casca's mental condition. She's be more reasonable in her potato form.<br><br><br>It's pretty hard to read through this again when you realize that Casca was pregnant the whole time.</br></br></br></br>  Who is he, /a/?  <br>Women have reported orgasming during rape despite themselves. It's still physical stimulation. Now imagine physical stimulation by Satan, who once reincarnated, is able to reduce grown (ish) men to tears with his mere prescence.</br>  <br>Are you forgetting the part when Guts was first introduced to the hawks and how he killed members and nobody seemed to give a fuck? they're ready to throw their life on the line, as long as it's for a reason. <br>Nobody but Guts could Witness how Griffith did it, or what happened to him. So it seemed as if they were dying for nothing. <br>I'm sure Casca would've given her life away if it mean Griffith would accomplish his dream, but she was left to wonder and make sense of the mess she experimented. Then she was raped by monster, and later Femto, who also happened to be love of her life, that made her cum in front of her significant other. <br>Honestly, retard Casca is better that way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>some vessel of the elf king<br>to watch shit go down and make cute pictures with casca</br></br>  When will we stop discussing this rape shit? What's the point? Why can't we all view the rape as prime fap material and still want her and Guts to get back together?  <br>A manifestation of Guts and Cacsa's child, only made possible by Griffith's rebirth.</br>  <br>Nah, dude. In 500 years, when someone can just pick up and read Berserk from start to finish, they'll be marveled at Falconia in all its splendor. These images will compliment the story, in the sense that we're seeing all this greatness before it all comes tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down.</br>  <br>I can't tell if you're serious or not. You never bother to use the right translation either.<br><br><br>Or elf king magic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd believe this if the woman was experimented. After all, orgasms by clit stimulation are the most common and why you see most porn actress rubbing it so fucking much in order to reach an orgasm. <br>Otherwise, there's just no way. Penetration alone won't cut it. And Casca isn't experimented at all.<br>Most of female orgasms are a mental thing after all. It heavily depends on who you're having sex with, or if it's part of a taboo fantasy you've always had.</br></br></br>  <br> Are you forgetting the part when Guts was first introduced to the hawks and how he killed members and nobody seemed to give a fuck? they're ready to throw their life on the line, as long as it's for a reason. <br><br>How can you even compare Guts offing some Hawks that attacked him first with Griffith sacrificing all of his loyal followers? Not only that they all died a gruesome deaths, but also are they damned to suffer in some hell dimension. I wonder how Rickert can even stay sane, when thinking of Corcus, Pippin and Judeau suffering for eternity. I doubt that no one will fill Casca in on the details of their branding, once she should regain her sainity.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm 100% serious, and the translation is trustworthy. What are you so afraid of?</br>  <br>I'm saying that anything Griffith commands it's done by the hawks, even if it means losing their life.</br>  Guts and crew ride the ship up onto land and up into Griffith's new kingdom, where they continue to ride it into Griffith and crush him to death.<br>The series then ends.</br>  <br> What is the G-spot <br><br>Also, women aren't a monolith. All women are different - some can be brought to orgasm easily even by penetration alone, some will never orgasm unless rub their clit at 9000RPM.</br></br></br>  <br> are you a woman? have you lost your virginity? </br>  <br>I just think Casca is better off with Guts, that's all.</br>  <br>Who is Oscar?</br>  <br><br>The ones on Mangareader are better quality</br></br>  <br>Now you're just bein petulant. I don't deny that the Hawk's were not ready to give their live for Griffith in a battle. However they were betrayed by him and given to feast upon by abominations and can't even rest in peace in their afterlife. I doubt anyone would have signed up for that shit.</br>  <br>Which is okay, I think they're amazing too. But I also believe her and Griffith could've worked and given the circumstances, Gutt's later train of thought, Casca's feelings that can still be perceived in her retard state and Griffith's condition. It isn't unlikely to happen.<br>Let it be what Miura wants it to be, which will most likely end in rape anyways.</br></br>  <br> unless you rub their clit at 9000RPM <br>iktf</br></br>  <br>*that the Hawks were ready to give their lives</br>  <br> girls <br> browsing and shitposting in /a/ <br>Retarded ugly permavirgins like you will never change.</br></br></br>  <br>you're such a dumb boy!</br>  WHERE IS THE NEW CHAPTER<br>WASN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE OUT TODAY</br>  <br>5 days, my friend</br>  <br>NOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>By give their lives I imagine that means they're willing to fight and die for him, you know... In a normal battle<br><br>Not be eaten alive by monsters and sacrificed in evil rituals and be damned to hell forever to suffer forever</br></br></br>  <br>They all knew what they were getting into when they decided to follow this moterfucker</br>   you now realize countless anons have started reading berserk since the hiatus started and only recently caught up with the manga without having have to deal with years of torment waiting for them to get off the boat.   <br>Yeah, I know and agree. I just corrected my sentence in the previous post by that post.</br>  <br>Hell no, they did not. People didn't know what abominations ran around the world and thought everything supernatural was just fantasy. They were ready to die for Griffith in battle and fight for his dream, not be eaten alive and be tortured some more in a hell dimesnion. How can you be so dense?</br>  Enjoy your Friendship Cup while you can.  My Ruri is a miracle of the universe.  <br>She's my Ruri.</br>  <br>To be fair she looks like a loli resonator. Maybe Jack didn't want it because he only use manly cards.</br>  <br>Mine.</br>  <br> implying Jobelisk Force poses a threat </br>  <br>Yuuri dragon when?</br>  <br>Mine.</br>    <br>You don't even have a Ruri, Shingo.</br>  <br>Neither does Yuri, so she's up for grabs, I did spend several days with her.</br>  <br>I want to see his d eck. </br>  <br> so she's up for grabs <br><br>Not anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Will the new Goyos and Ancient Gears ever get released?</br>  <br>I'm gonna beat that ass once I beat Yuzu.</br>  Shun, Sawatari, and Sora (I know you're here), you guys need to stop posting on the internet so much.  <br>No, because Konami hates Synchros.</br>  <br>It's not like they have anything better to do.</br>  <br>I hope so. I think the Goyos has a higher chance of being printed than the Ancient Gears.<br>The Ancient Gears don't even look like actual Ancient Gears</br></br>  <br>Even if they do, they'll be useless little baby cards that can't do anything worth a damn.</br>  <br>Will Chess-kun duel Lex Luthor?</br>  <br>The anime Goyos are good, and then there's Sniping Hazy Type-0</br>  <br>They are locked in their rooms until it's time for their duels though.</br>  <br>Those rooms are luxurious. They obviously have free Internet.</br>  I called Sam giving Yuya a TUNA monster that he would use to summon the inevitable synchro OEPD evolution  <br>Doesn't mean the actual cards would be good though.</br>  <br>It'll probably be the cover card of the next set. Unless of course Synchro Odd-Eyes gets it</br>  <br>Prove it.</br>   they both know the other is here now <br> in the same goddamn building <br> still can't reunite because they're locked in their rooms until their duels <br>Can things be any crueler for them?</br></br></br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br> Yuzu and Yuya will duel <br> Yuya will duel Yuzu after knowing what happens to the losers <br> Yuya will try to lose on purpose <br> Yuzu will catch onto what he's doing <br> Jack vs Carly ver. Arc V begins. </br></br></br></br></br>  Blessed be are the raw providers, for they enable the subbing.  I want to card this fucking xyz scum.  <br>I want to cum into this sexyz card.</br>  Poor Sherry.  <br>Give it pink hair and hand it to Yuya.</br>  <br><br>It's ironic that the only Lancer that's not locked up in their room is Reiji</br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128250<wbr>029/#128256463<br><br>Caalled it</br></br></wbr></br>  So what's this about Yugo going Yugo mode in the spoilers?  <br>The audience liked Yugo's duel, so they were 'Yugo Mode' like Kingu Mode.</br>  Yuya's TUNA monster is cute! CUTE!  When will we hear The Resistance theme again? It sounded so badass  <br>Good job, anon.</br>  <br>When Shun starts running through the halls of Academia screaming about Ruri and disrupting the classes.</br>  I like that Yuya's tuner is level one, because in my performapal deck the only Tuner I use is Effect Veiler and it works pretty nicely to summon stuff like Trishula. Hope Tuning Magician will work greatly with Pals so I can just replace Effect Veiler without changing much about my deck   Yuzu next to Yugo <br> Serena next to shun <br><br>NTR is real</br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping his pendant magically transforms it to a pendulum. Right now it doesn't have any searchers and it needs a partner like the other pendulum magicians.</br>  <br>Who the hell is Shun/Serena NTRing? Serena and Yuri don't even know each other.<br><br>Also they're beside each other because they're complete opposites, and Yugo/Yuzu despite their cute interactions are beside each other because they're friends that have been hanging out for like two weeks straight.</br></br></br>    <br> Also they're beside each other because they're complete opposites <br><br>The only way for them to be any more similar at this point is for Selena to reveal that she has a little brother.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Shun holding Ichigo?</br>  Have we discussed this yet?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PyT<wbr>L2EBWtzQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Darkside of Dimensions <br><br>Guys, do you think it will be connected to Arc-V?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he is a man of divine taste.</br>  <br><br>Totally Not!Yusei confirmed . No Arc V Duel Disk . Proto D-Gazer ?</br></br>  <br> ! <br>Back to tumblr.</br></br>  <br> yfw Jack sees this and remembers what could've been, and what he left behind <br> yfw   everyone's soul burns a little too much sometimes </br></br>    <br>You mean Sora isn't her brother?</br>  <br><br> Anon try to discuss about the trailer  <br> Faggot come here just to shitpost <br><br>Please kill yourself <br><br><br><br>Talk about Yu-Gi-Oh if you want but please just stop those " !"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>About the only connection I can see is this is going on concurrently with Arc-V and that's about it. No way they'd explain why the dimensions/universes are split completely separated from the actual anime.</br>  It's gonna be a big while before Yuya duels again, Will his opponent be Yugo? I can't see Yuya synchro summoning until after he beats Yugo and takes Clear Wing.  <br> please just stop those " !" <br>Not the guy you replied to, but the "! between words" thing is a TV Tropes thing. This was their fault, not Tumblr's.</br></br>  <br><br>Now that we see the trailer , can we agree about the fact that the blue haired guys look so much like Yusei with Ponytail ?</br></br>  <br>I think you mean Johan.</br>  <br>I wonder if this tournament will even make it to the next round. I think we'll just have each Lancer dueling once, and then crazy shit will happen. I don't think Academia are just sitting on their asses. Plus, Roger means to arrest Yugo and Yuzu in front of everyone, and he's already moving on Yuzu. Once they cart her off, Yuya and Yugo can meet without either one of them disappearing.<br><br>And THEN, there's pic related.</br></br></br>    <br>All I could think about this episode is how badly I want the Tops to meet the Obelisk Force. This so called "Tournament" Is a sham. The competitors are paraded out in front of the tops like cattle and then locked up in their rooms like prisoners until it's their turn to duel. The only way this could get more hypocritical and disgusting is if they throw any people who lose into the Facility and fix the winner vs Jack matches since he's so popular, like what Godwin did.</br>  <br>I like how the anniversary editions go back to the original art style. It's like Pokemon: Origins all over again.</br>  <br>Who gives a damn about the first series, only nostalgiafags care.<br><br>it was shit, compared to todays actual fast paced and great cardgames.</br></br></br>  <br>Without the success of the first series we wouldn't have Arc-V today.</br>  This anime makes me feel so lonely  <br>Well it's supposed to be a continuation of the manga, not the anime, even though it'll be a continuation of both regardless.</br>  <br>Sora pls your deck sucks balls and can't do anything fast paced or great.</br>  I just waked up in the morning, what happened? I only cared about two things now (it was one but I did a quick peek in the other thread)<br> Summary of today's episode <br> Yuya and Yuzu reunion <br> Aki appeared? </br></br></br>  i only have 40 hours before i leave to a place without internet for a month.<br><br>Is there any other translation for the latest episode coming? since that mono said he will delay</br></br>  <br><br>It's like saying Yugo knows entertainment more than Yuya.</br></br>  <br>You're still dreaming anon.<br> Today's episode was a summary <br> No Yuya and Yuzu reunion <br> Where did you get this idea? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait people in a dimension that are entertained by motorcycles are more entertained by motorcycles than a kid screaming about his entertainment then proceeds to get fucking destroyed by someone on a motorcycle who also happens to be the King of Games? <br><br>You don't say.</br></br></br>  <br>Your only hope is a script that should come out in around 12 hours give or take. Maybe you'll catch that ruSub group if you're lucky</br>  <br>Yuzu was screaming Yuya and her voice was so disgusting and horribly whiny i wanted to punch her in the fucking face and kill her.</br>  <br>Tell that at least has something worth to watch.

And that most of them aren't even 18? And one of them is a child?</br>  <br>Screw that, what about the relatives and friends of all the people he forcefully recruited into his private military</br>  About that Green-eyes thing, Asian have blurry concept of blue and green. In my place parents call cyan 'green'.<br><br><br>Speaking about controlling EGCs, the Devil's were designed by Pegasus to contain the EGCs power.</br></br></br>  <br>Watching this while listening to Started from the Bottom is so strangely compelling.</br>    <br>Some of the Lancers may end up facing folks like Enjo, Divine, Grieger, Koda or maybe just entirely new duelists.</br>  <br>Especially since given how much short notice there was, people that were already in the tourney must have been kicked out</br>  Whoa, this episode was horridly boring, Sam being asshurt that Jack gave him a tuner that's not really all that bad for a dragon deck? Yuya and Yuzu worrying about each other again and those Tops being Tops. This wasn't even a set up episode, it was just pure shit.  <br>Isn't that right Chairman?</br>  <br>These motherfuckers are so getting carded.</br>  <br>Oh, yes!<br><br>[|-3</br></br></br>  <br>Who will do the deed?

I predict he duels Yuzu  Just saw new ep today<br>I see a level 9 thing, Will Gongenzaka-sama use new Superheavy Samurai's next week?</br>  <br>That man, Gongenzaka, will use debba tewning.</br>  <br>Looks like it. Still, level 9 is too high, it's not what SH need, he needs lv 5, 7 or 8</br>   tfw Toons won't get a level 1 Fish-type Tuner named Toona Tooner   <br>It really worries me that the trailer has Atem in it.</br>  <br>Dem ahegao</br>  <br> dat brick hand <br>Pathetic</br></br>  <br>I feel the same way. I was feeling great with the Puzzle being gone and Atem's story finally being put to rest, and the end of the manga having Yugi saying, "My story is just beginning," and now Atem's in the trailer and I'm like, "For what purpose?"<br><br>Oh, right, nostalgia-fags eating the budget of the best thing since sliced bread.</br></br></br>  <br>So much this, I would have preferred to be just Yugi and Kaiba here, not Atem.</br>  <br>Erm I'm pretty sure nostalgiafags have nothing to do it since it was explicitly stated this movie was going to be Kaiba's story but the upper heads wanted Yugi to be shoehorned in as well. So blame them.</br>  <br>but anon, muh dark magician shilling</br>  Wait so if Yuya has a Level 1 tuner, doesn't that mean he's getting a Level 8 Odd-Eyes? That means he's not getting Clear Wing.  <br>Literally Return of F.</br>  <br>Clear Wing's evolution (once he gets it) will require 1 Tuner monster + Clear Wing, because all of the other evolutions so far have been Lv 8 (or Rank 7 in the case of OERD).</br>  <br>I'm still wondering what happened in their day-long duel. Seeing the Shunfags get btfo was satisfying tho</br>  <br>But how would that relate to Odd-Eyes if it's not being used in the summon?</br>  <br>GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HER<br>REEEEEEE</br></br>  <br><br> people still not realizing that Yuya's "Beyond the Pendulum" monsters are separate from the individual Yu-s upgrades <br>Jesus Christ.</br></br></br>  <br> reading comprehension </br>   people who still think Hanate &gt; Burn    enter thread of nostalgiafags <br> post nothing but Arc-V and be hostile for no reason </br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the BTP Odd-eyes, I'm talking about anime Odd-Eyes. All of its evolutions require Odd-Eyes and an enabler i.e. Dark Rebellion, Silver Claw, Trump Witch, etc. Yuya can't use Odd-Eyes and Clear Wing to Synchro Summon unless he gets new magicians that change levels.<br><br>Sam gave him a Tuner, that is Level 1, which when tuned with Odd-Eyes, gives him a Level 8 Odd-Eyes Synchro.<br><br>He can't do that with Clear Wing since isn't an Odd-Eyes monster, and even if he gets Clear Wing, he'll have to get Magicians or cards that can change around Clear Wing or Odd-Eyes levels in order to tune them with Tuning Magicuan. Not to mention that he has to do that every single time he wants to summon whatever Odd-Eyes+Clear Wing monster he creates. I just don't see that happening.<br><br>After today's episode I don't think he'll get Clear Wing, or he will but it won't have a Synchro Pendulum evolution.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's not gonna beat crow is he and will they give this nigger some pendulem cards. why not have crow fight shun first </br></br>  <br>Maybe he still has to get another Xyz evolution first, to match his having 2 Fusion ones.</br>  <br> REEEEEEE <br>What's this referencing anyway?</br></br>    <br>The sound of a shithead frogposter when a normie kicks sand in their face at the beach? I dunno.</br>  <br> this is fine it pleases my fujo nature <br>I kind of hope Atem is the antagonist.</br></br>  <br>Adding on to this since this does make valid points, Yuya would have to Synchro Summon Clear Wing with either of the literally two Level 6 monsters he has as well as Pendulum Summon Odd-Eyes and then find a way to get Tuning Magician back on the field since he has only one copy AND finding a way to alter the levels of either Odd-Eyes or Clear-Wing in order to SS Odd-Eyes Clear Wing Dragon<br><br>Shit is too much work to summon a most likely Odd-Eyes Rebellion with a white card background</br></br></br>   all Fluffals need is an RotA <br> Fluffals will never get an RotA </br>  <br>Toy Vendor ; )</br>  sora is cute    <br>For a second I thought the Tournament would end nicely.</br>   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Jack Atlas so much, I owned all his cards and merchandise <br> I pray to Jack Atlas every night, thanking him for the burning soul I have been given <br> "Jack is love," I say, "Jack is life" <br> My dad hears me and calls me a traitor <br> He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Jack <br> I call him a jealous commons <br> He duels me and beats me 2-0 because of Blackwings <br> I am crying now because my pride hurts <br> I lay in bed and it's really cold <br> A burning soul is moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Jack <br> I am so happy <br> He whispers into my ear, "This is entertainment" <br> He grabs me with his mighty arms and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my Duel Disk for Jack <br> He summons a bunch of monsters in one turn <br> I have no cards but I do it for Sawatari <br> I can feel my field emptying as cards are destroyed by his absolute power <br> I push against his force <br> I want to please Jack <br> He laughs a mighty laugh as he synchro summons his very soul <br> My dad walks in <br> Jack looks him deep in the eyes and says, "There is only one king! And it's me!" <br> Jack drives away on his Wheel of Fortune <br> Jack Atlas is love, Jack Atlas is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do you think someone will use PSYframes in the anime?  <br>Doubtful, the set is released in less than a month, there's no time for anyone in the anime to shill it</br>  <br> Not liking "ATTACK THE MOON!" </br>  <br> shinji </br>  <br>I don't know, from what we've seen of Shinji Psyframes don't really seem to suit him. Shinji will probably use a more REVOLUTION FIGHT THE 1% deck. Psyframes seem like the kind of deck an elitist intelectual would use</br>  <br><br>Shinji's using an insect deck, most likely bee themed, if the title of the episode is anything to go by.</br></br>  <br> &gt;I have no cards but I do it for Jack <br>fix'd, my bad</br></br>  <br> I have no cards but I do it for Sawatari <br><br>I think you might have missed a line there.</br></br></br>  <br> implying there's anything to fix </br>  <br> still from the preview </br>    <br> ahoge ahegao </br>  <br>At least its better than the Fortune Cup's 8-man "tournament"</br>  Oh hey, this would go great in my Super Heavy Samurai deck!<br>OH WAIT</br>  <br>When I was little I thought the background was the Golden Gate Bridge.</br>  <br>Got any good decklists?</br>  <br>No it wouldn't, super heavy samurais depend on not having any magic or trap cards to activate their effects.</br>   yfw Sawatari uses Dark Mirror Force to save the day   <br>I'm fully expecting it and all the people calling it a shit card are going to eat their words...or they'll just greentext 'lel script duels'</br>  <br>Wow, I had no idea, that's why I emphasized my evident ignorance with an overtly naive OH WAIT.</br>  <br>All duels are script duels</br>  <br>Exactly, so people not expecting Sawatari to use a card they had no reason for showing for whatever reason in a good scripted context are stupid. <br><br>There was no point to showing DFM other than if Sawatari is either going to use it against Yuzu and win or use it against Academia and save somebody. But all I ever see is, "lel shit card never gonna be used' and then when it's finally used it'll just be 'lel shit card with script duels how stupid fuckin shitters'.</br></br></br>  i think i am in love with yuya  <br>we all know whos going to get carded when the fusion attacks....there will be no more ENJOY! my heart...oh my heart.</br>  <br>Enjoy her while she lasts</br>   Yuya and Yuzu in the same hotel <br> On the same floor <br> They can't see each other because the suites are locked before the match </br></br>  i wonder how strong are the Secret police are than your everyday security dude.  <br>All the better so they can end up dueling each other</br>  I don't understand what Yuya was shouting about in his room.  <br>MUH ENTERTAINMENT AND MUH YUZU YAAAAMEEEEROOOOOO</br>  <br>MUH ENTERTAINMENT<br><br>MUH YUZU</br></br></br>  <br>Screaming about everything that had happened since MCS, hoping Yuzu would hear him.</br>  <br> it was shit, compared to todays actual fast paced and great cardgames. <br>And yet the original manga stands as the only truly great version of YGO.</br></br>  <br>Put it in your opponents deck then steal it with your samurai powers.</br>  <br>I'm getting mighty sick of this. Will somebody put them back together already so they can focus on other shit? God, If it ain't Yuya screaming about something it's Yuzu screaming about something and the first thing is usually each other.</br>  <br> I was only 9 years old I loved Jose so much, I had all the merchandise and movies  <br> I pray to Jose every night before bed thanking him for the life I've been given.  <br> Jose is love I say, Jose is life  <br> My dad overhears me and calls me a faggot  <br> I knew he was just jealous of my devotion for Jose <br> I called him a Synchro Scum <br> He then kicked my butt with his Junk Doppler Deck. <br> Im crying now, and my pride has gone <br> I lay in bed and its really cold  <br> A warmth is moving towards me.  <br> I feel something touch me  <br> Its Jose  <br> I am so happy  <br> He whispers in to ear "Prepare your anus and taste my Grand Slaughter Cannon!" <br> He grabs me with his powerful cyborg hands and puts me on my hands and knees  <br> I'm ready  <br> I spread my ass cheeks for Jose  <br> He penetrates my butthole <br> It hurts so much but I do it for Jose  <br> I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water  <br> I push against his force  <br> I want to please Jose <br> He roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his love  <br> My dad walks in  <br> Jose looks him straight in the eye and says "Running duel, acceleration!"  <br> Jose leaves through my window  <br> Jose is love Jose is life. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lol, your funny</br>  Our time has come. For 300 years, we prepared. We grew stronger. While you rested in your cradle of power, believing your people were safe… protected from carding. You were trusted to lead the casuals but you were deceived, as our powers over our fusions blinded you. You assumed no duelists could challenge you and now… finally… we have returned.<br> -Malgus</br>  <br> he doesn't do it for Sawatari </br>  <br>Yuzu hasn't been screaming much, she cried a couple times over missing Yuya and then seeing him against but mostly she's just been doing shit with Yugo over Academia or New Domino City economics, or them just having some light hearted chemistry.</br>  Is there an episode without yuya saying YAMERO or YUZUU  <br>What the fuck is a Malgus?</br>  <br>you dont know much about starwars do you, this anon has been quoting a few shit form swtor &amp; Darth bane, anyways Malgus is a a guy from swtor and that quote is from a trailer, theres more out there than just anime &amp; card games you fucking loser.</br>  <br>I believe he's one of the Sith Lords for The Old Republic.</br>  <br><br>Oh cool.<br>I don't watch crap.</br></br></br>  <br>That's because Yuzu isn't as fucked up as Yuya is</br>  <br>same could be said about your current living arrangement anon.</br>  <br>Give it time</br>  Crow's friends are going to get carded, Shinji and ENJOY join Lancers, Jack stays to defend Synchro dimension with Crow. Fusions get fused with Yuri  <br>No.<br><br>Crow's friends will get carded to protect Crow. <br><br>Crow and Shinji will get carded to protect the kids.<br><br>ENJOY will get carded to protect Yuya/Sawatari's entertainment. <br><br>Jack will clean the fuck up and stay behind and continuing ruling Synchro with a burning soul.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Security vs Obelisk Blue gang war are in too</br>  Yuya's new card is a total cutie.<br><br> level 1 tuner <br> level 8 Odd-Eyes synchro <br> unsearchable only tuner to reach it with <br><br>D'aaww</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Yuzu/Serena kidnap bowl with Yuya breaking off from the Lancers to hunt her down in EGAO mode. <br><br>Which causes Shun to go out on his own, and then Reiji to deem the Lancers not a success and leaves with Reira and the ninja. <br><br>So now it's just Gon and Sawatari left to try and save the day.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pretty much this...Shinji is going to be missed</br>  Remember a guy last week who called that yuya will get a tuner and a synchro and he is gonna do all summoning methods?<br><br>Yeah that was me.</br></br>  <br>Just like there was no point to show BTS if he wasn't going to use it? Anon, random old cards are shown all the time and NEVER used.</br>  <br>I think we all figured he'd be doing every summoning method just like Reiji and that he'd eventually get a tuner monster, he'd need one eventually anyways.</br>  <br> Atem's holding Dark Magician <br>  Yuma's holding Number 39: Utopia <br>  Judai's Holding Elemental HERO Neos <br> Yusei's holding Junk Warrior, Junk Synchron and Stardust Dragon  <br><br> Yuya's holding Odd Eyes Pendulum Dragon and an Action card. <br><br>How fitting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will never get how jacked Atem was for a little 5 foot guy, and then Yugi...</br>  <br>wow thanks captain obvious, anything esle you'd liek to tell us? can you see into the future of you getting the fuck out of here?</br>  Zushin vs Zushin   You now realize that Sora is the only character to this date that has legitimately defeated Birdman in a duel <br> fucking <br> Sora </br></br>  Do we all agree that Judai is the best MC?<br><br> Handsome as fuk <br> /fa/ as fuck <br> overall best desing <br> competitive deck <br> has unlimited sex by succubi </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Greetings from /dng/. Anyone cautiously hyped about the new yugioh movie?  <br><br>Yuya represents the Balance, he is some kind of Avatar, you heard it here first.</br></br>  <br> legitimately <br>You mean that duel that was mostly off screen? I sure am glad we got to see how skillful Sora was and how Shun overextended.</br></br>  <br><br>Those retarded D-Gasers ruined my hype, not to mention the posibility of atem apearing wich is total bullshit.</br></br>  /dng/ is having a pissy fit with /ygp/ and /a/rc-v just got brought into it, thought I'd let you guys know to prepare yourselves for any faggotry that may follow.  <br>Then don't post about it if you don't want any faggotry, retard.</br>  <br><br>Don't forget that half a day passed and Sora likely had to stall just to beat him.<br><br>Atem is being used as the villain this time around if the leaks are true.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He still beat him though.</br>  <br> Atem's armpit </br>  <br>Yeah and it would have been better if it had been a full duel. If they were going to have Shun be beaten by Sora they may as well as make it a good duel rather than Shun acting completely different from there first duel while Sora is actually trying to play smart.</br>  <br><br><br><br>He got ripped as fuck in order to win those yami no duels.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh? we know the effect,already?</br>  <br>No, but it's a level 1, not a magician and definately a tuner. That means that the next Synchro will be level 8 and Odd-Eyes decks can't reach that without her.</br>  <br>No. <br><br>Its just that, its Level 1.<br><br>Someone did mention a support, but he didnt state a source.<br><br>(Basically, its Level 1, 100/100 ATK/DEF, Spellcaster)<br>(It can only be used for a Synchro Summon of a Dragon-type Monster)<br>(If there's 1 or more Level 7 Dragon Type Monster on your side of the field, you can special summon "it" from your Hand or graveyard.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not a magician <br>http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Tuning<wbr>_Magician</wbr></br></br>  <br>It's a Magician, but since it isn't a Pendulum that means it has no support and can't be searched</br>  <br> It isn't a Pendulum <br>It probably will be in an episode or two</br></br>  <br>I just double checked the characters and yeah its a Magician. I wonder what the scale and new effect of it is when it gets converted like the rest of Yuya's Magicians and who its partner will be to compliment it. Also this marks the 5th Yuzu card after Trump Witch, Creation/Synthesis, Helprincess, and Noble/Superior Dragon Magician. Yuya's Citrus lust is too strong.</br>  <br> (If there's 1 or more Level 7 Dragon Type Monster on your side of the field, you can special summon "it" from your Hand or graveyard.) <br>Being a pendulum would make it worse, since it wouldn't go to grave, and once in extra deck it can't be pendulum sumoned since its level 1</br></br>  <br> People still don't grasp that people mean a Pendulum Magician when they say not a Magician <br>I blame the nips for using two different words for Magician cards.</br></br>  <br>I actually think it'd become a Tuner/Pendulum mostly because yuuya is like that.<br><br>And it can special summon itself from Extra Deck when a Level 7 Dragon is on field (or is pendulum summoned)<br><br>Tuning Pendulum Magician sounds great too.<br><br>Also, she'd fit right in a Dark Magician Girl deck. (Ones with access to Eye of Tialmus)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuya <br> Balance <br>He's the evil god.<br><br>Yuzu is the good god.<br><br>But since this is Yu-Gi-Oh they'll pull the switcharoo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  MIERU WHEN?  <br>Who?</br>  <br>She has such an annoying voice, almost as annoying as Ayu's</br>  <br> She has such an annoying voice, <br> Talking shit about Aoi yuuki  <br>Your shit taste cannot be cured.</br></br></br>  <br>I should say the same about you</br>  I find that new magician card extremely odd. Why would Jack have a monster like that in his deck?Why would he choose to hand it off to a kid? It's a tuner monster to help him synchro summon yet the kid took it as an insult. It's even part of Yuya's sub-archetype. so many mysteries, so much speculation. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm curious.  Why is it that Reiji has 'real' forms of all three summoning methods?  <br>Because he has nothing else going for him, he shit chara</br>  <br>Because BASED Reiji.</br>  Few questions, What is Sam saying to Yuya? He seems to dislike jack for some reason. What is Yuya saying when he's just screaming YUZU in the room? What's the Tuner's effect and why does Sam give him the card? Who's going to win crow vs gon?  <br>Sam met Jack when he was a kid and Jack gave him a card he thought suited him, Tuner Magician, Sam felt like Jack was insulting him and that he really was a traitor and a sellout to the Commons. Yuya was yelling because he figured that glowy dragons means Yugo's nearby which means Yuzu is also nearby. His yelling was his attempt at trying to talk to her through the wall and finally, Gon will win vs Crow because the spoilers say something bad happens to people who lose in the Friendship cup and Gon is not so expendable that he's gonna be put out like this.</br>  <br> Gon will win vs Crow because the spoilers say something bad happens to people who lose in the Friendship cup and Gon is not so expendable that he's gonna be put out like this. <br>So I'm not the only one who doesn't repeat the "Gon is irrevelant" meme.</br></br>  What ever became of pic related?  Holy shit!!!!!! Best mom gets better!!!  I want to test Odd-Eyes with the magicians, anyone has a good deck? Preffered if it's only Odd-Eyes and magicians and not some off-archetype cards  <br><br>Who is that?</br></br>  <br><br>Gon is likely to win, because Academia will invade after the losers of the friendship taste their punishment in which Gon will be a help against academia rather than Crow. If Crow happens to win and takes over Gons place as a lancer and fights against Academia instead, thats basically like how he stole Aki's relevancy from 5d's</br></br>  <br>Funny because she's the one that told Yuya to go EGAO in the middle of the interdimensional war rather than Take it seriously</br>  <br>To be fair, Crow will likely be irrelevant once they leave the Synchro Dimension so giving him some moments to shine now won't be too bad.</br>  <br>OR of that pic, still love it every time I see it. If the original artist ever has the chance to make it more solid and complete, that'll be the raddest shit.</br>  <br>I'm not at that point yet. I just found out she was leader of a gang.</br>  <br>Just like Yuto told Yuya to Eago even through he was face to face with a monster who just carded someone in front of him and would of carded his buddy without remorse. Yuto and Yoko are fucking retards. Just like Yuzu putting up fucking posters of Academia and ranting in the streets about them.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1542<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1541 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Wifu when?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128204880 <br><br>Not time yet.</br></br>  Thread is up.   6 AM chan time <br><br>So, when we pushing it back to Thursday?</br></br>  <br>Why not waifu weekdays instead of weekends?</br>  Requesting Sendai staying up late browsing /a/.  <br>There is.

Here's a reference: http://i.imgur.com/BJgeLG8.jpg  Requesting a combination of Silver Crow and Silver Karasu's outfits  Coming upon a clearing in the woods  while wearing a hooded cloak  <br> In the clearing is one is one of these gods: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cernu<wbr>nnos https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mieli<wbr>kki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudra<wbr> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapio<wbr>_%28spirit%29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekke<wbr>itsertok or cute Artemis and/or Diana </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>Does she ever come across any sort of danger or in contact with another person? I'm actually curious</br>  The general seems so much more peaceful right now.  <br>Probably because everyone moved to the WWD.</br>  <br>Pretty much.<br>Could you draw some more cute/lewd lolis in the meantime, Heikatsu?</br></br>  <br>Honestly I kind of wish I could move my requests from the WWD to the general, even if I could I don't want double dipping shitposting because all the meta shit from that thread drags into the general during the week.</br>  This poster from Hostel 1 but with Shion from Higurashi holding the chainsaw and wearing that mask. Make sure she is wearing the attached maid outfit. <br><br>It says:<br>“Ni-Pah!” <br>-Rika <br><br>Ryukishi7 presents:<br>"Higurashi"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The general is the best during the weekends.</br>  <br> Could you draw some more cute/lewd lolis in the meantime, Heikatsu? <br>Sure thing! I can try to draw some stuff later today when I'm less busy.<br><br> the meta shit from that thread drags into the general during the week. <br>The WWD is kind of awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was one of the people who told you you'd be better off doing deliveries in the general where you'll probably be appreciated more for what you were delivering there. <br><br>How's it been working out for you anyway?</br></br></br>  <br> So close. </br>  <br>awesome, man. I'll look forward to it.</br>  Requesting Louise walking funny after spending the night with Thickus Dickus and Biggus Dickus  Requesting moe maids! Tripping over, spilling water, soda, etc while screaming KYAAAA GOMEN NASAI  Now that I think about it, a maid cafe with different anime gals would be nice...  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128225109 <br>Get my tabs mixed up, every time.</br>  <br>Well  yeah .  From this point on I want her to run into more people, interact with various deities and mythical creatures.  I've got an end in mind.  </br>  Requesting Kanna and Yuu in cute swimsuits kissing underwater like in Sakura Trick  <br>Cool, I wonder if you ever thought of her running into other yurus</br>  <br>Yeah that will definitely happen  as long as artist stay interested heheh </br>  <br>Well I have to say that I've been enjoying the work people put into your requests. Hope enough drawdudes are still interested in finish it!</br>  <br>I've been lucky that some really talented people have been picking them up. And thanks so do I</br>  Hey OR, just wanted to let you know that I'm working on this, is taking longer than I expected but I'm quite busy and I'm trying not to rush, otherwise it wouldn't be as good  Requesting Yamcha and Maron cuddling together.  <br>Holy shit, those details.<br>Not OR, but good going.</br></br>  <br> going nuts on the goggles <br><br>I understand, metal stuff is fun to paint.</br></br></br>   tfw when the best request you got from this drawthread was of a character you eventually despised   <br> While bulma isn't looking. </br>  <br>With gape and cum drip still in effect.</br>  <br>Sweet mother of god! Take as much time as you need, that looks absolutely perfect!</br>  Requesting Snail and Bat in extremely skimpy bikinis like the girls on the left have.<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/7NGI7jF.jpg</br></br>  <br>I get the superslut part, but the milf?</br>  <br><br>Okay finally back, heres one I did while testing some new brush settings. <br><br><br>Posting more in the general? Worked out fine I guess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lines look really clean. If you're still in a drawing mood, have you ever done Hachikuji? Lewds of her are surprisingly scarce.</br>  <br>nice.<br>all I can note is that her butt seems to look kinda tiny perspective wise compared to her head.</br></br>  <br> Dat loli-vagina <br>Holy shit muh dick. You must be some sort of Semen-Sorcerer to make my cum shoot out so fast at such force like that. Not OR but you are my nigga, younger looking lolis never get drawn.</br></br>  <br>Fantastic loli as usual. Looking forward to whatever you do next. <br><br>Something with some bulges hopefully.</br></br></br>  Requesting Aisha hugging Jim from behind while wearing nothing but an oversized shirt and underwear, and Jim is noticeably embarrassed by it.<br><br>This isn't a good request for the waifu thread is it?</br></br>  <br>I agree. Its all teens people try to pass off as loli. Could use some more younger lolis from time to time.</br>  Requesting a redrawn version of this, this time, colored, it doesn't have to be too fancy, just good enough so i can post it on other threads.  <br>Thanks. <br>I'm surprised there are so few lewds of her, since shes so popular. I'm not terribly fond of her so the chance i'll draw her is very slim, sorry. <br><br><br>Thanks, Noted. I completely agree, there are a lot of small issues I have with it. I will work on making the butt a little larger but other problems I probably will not change since its just a quick drawing and not something I terribly care about. "Fixed" version will be posted to my pixiv. <br><br><br><br>No prob. Glad you enjoyed it.<br> younger looking lolis never get drawn. <br>It's a real shame, honestly. Rest assured though I'm not afraid to take drawing requests of younger characters.<br><br><br> Something with some bulges hopefully. <br>Same here stomach bulges are great, I'm staying up late tonight, I'll do some more drawings definitely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You ever looking for requests feel to say so. I don't typically request lewd stuff in these threads unless people offer. Looking forward to tonight with the more good stuff.</br>  <br>I wish I could request you, but publicly requesting lewd of my waifu is like impossible for me.</br>  <br> Looking forward to tonight with the more good stuff. <br>Go ahead and request if you feel like it. Whether I choose to take on the request or not is uncertain. Depends on the request and if I feel like doing it or not. If you have a request, post it, if i dont accept it im sure somebody else will. <br><br><br> publicly requesting lewd of my waifu is like impossible for me. <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Illya getting  DP? </br>  <br><br>how about something cute for an aside?</br></br>  <br> Why? <br>I get extremely uncomfortable up to the point of anxiety when I attempt to.<br> Guess I must be a literal faggot. </br></br></br>  <br> Go ahead and request if you feel like it. Whether I choose to take on the request or not is uncertain. <br>Well yeah. Its just a preference of mine not to request that sort of thing blind. Plus I'm not really sure what kind of stuff you are okay with. How obscene you are okay with being and that sort of thing. <br><br>Of course you can always just pass on it, thats a given. <br><br>I guess as a request<br><br><br>These Monogatari girls sharing a large dildo, with bulge.<br><br>You can age them down a bit if you want. Actually might be kind of interesting.<br><br><br>But as I said, not knowing how obscene you are okay with or how young or old you like to go its hard to choose one request and I would hate to post a whole bunch like a greedy asshole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Double points? On her capital cash back card?</br>  <br>I'm not sure if its the same thing as you, but I am honestly a little emotionally invested in most /a/ lolis I can think of to be okay with porn of them. And hell, even girls that aren't lolis but have loli body types, like Taiga, who is just made for sex, are a little hard to ask for porn of just because I have grown attached to them.<br><br>I don't know why, but /a/ related lolis I just get attached to.</br></br></br>  <br>A lolified Nadia getting spitroasted by two large cocks. I really don't like her so that would be an incredibly pleasant thing to see.</br>  <br>Oh, I don't actually have any problem with lewds of my waifu. I just can't publicly request lewds of her.</br>  <br><br> Please forgive me for this redirect, I don't usually do this sort of thing I swear.  No worries if you don't pick it up</br></br>  <br>Not the same thing then. Like I try and fap to porn of some girls like Taiga, or the Monogatari girls, and I can't do it unless its really sweet and happy porn. Anything else and I just get upset and have to stop. As pathetic as that is.</br>  <br>Why are Japanese animals so incredibly sexual?</br>  <br>fucking kekd</br>  <br>It's the nature of all Japanese things, it can't be helped.</br>  Requesting Noriko and Jung doing topless symetrical docking.

How obscene you are okay with being and that sort of thing. <br>There isn't really a limit on obscenity. I don't draw guro though.<br>I'm no expert at drawing (obviously) so complex requests or requests with multiple characters or detailed backgrounds and objects are less likely to be picked. <br><br><br> I am honestly a little emotionally invested in most /a/ lolis I can think of to be okay with porn of them <br>I've done deliveries of H-manga lolis in the past. Are you emotionally attached to those as well?<br><br><br>I hate her too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  May I have something sexy-lewd (such as posing nude, except keep her shoulder/head armor on) with Martei from the Mega Man X2 manga, please?  Louise, in this dress having a run in with cunt destroyer.  <br><br><br><br>Didn't feel like drawing all that extra stuff, so I just drew her lewdly masturbating.

It's a shame his latest comic in LO still hasnt been translated. <br><br><br> Not a fan of guro either, but sometimes you just don't know. Thats good to keep in mind. I'll try and think up some pretty obscene things then. <br>One of human kind's most precious gifts is the ability to express our imagination, even when it's lewd or offensive, you should have the right to do so. So personally I have no issues with drawing obscene lewdities. I'm still learning, so theres some things too complex for me to draw though. <br><br><br> I'd shake your hand right now if they weren't both completely covered in cum. <br>Fantastic! I'm so glad you enjoyed it. <br> this delivery is so fappable and adorable <br>I know, right? I love her expression.<br> I'm really glad I bit the bullet and link-redirected you. <br>Huh? I don't understand. What do you mean?<br> Your lolis that are actually lolis instead of the usual "lolis" that are just teenagers <br>Ah, yes.

I haven't fucked with Digimon for like 16 years so I'm out of the loop but it could be a fun request, maybe.</br>  <br>Not really, doubt it'd be a character you'd want to draw since I'd only choose my waifu or daughteru.

Complicated clothes are a pain though</br>  Requesting Rei, Warp from Kaiba and Lain in the bear suit sitting in fron of the bonfire from dark souls. The characters can be simplified or chibi versions.  <br>I mentioned the last part just so that the designs are consistent.</br>  <br>Neat</br>  Where do you guys get complete set of character design sheets of shows?  <br>I would assume it can be a little easier if you google the character's name along with "concept art" or something.<br><br>Also, going to the series's wikia helps too.</br></br></br>  <br>I checked zerochan and it has scans of character sheet.</br>  Requesting Sakaki as a Jinko, carrying Maya, her cat.

I liked it a lot.<br><br>Yes they don't get many arts, especially together  ;_;  I wish there was more art of them, looking forward if you do it!</br></br></br>  Tamamo celebrating No Bra Day by wearing her left outfit without her bra on; make it more teasing the viewer.  <br> *550 </br>  <br> this abs </br>    <br>I need it.</br>  <br>Not OR but this is fucking great</br>    <br>Noice!</br>  <br>Woah, that's awesome</br>  <br>Not OR, but nice work Untitledfag.</br>  Time for an update.

Again, take as much time as you need!</br>  What the fuck was with that ED? W-what has she been doing with such a large dog?  Her sister loved the knot and couldn't give it up even after death.  <br>The dog is left from her dead sister, perhaps. Or her soul is in it.</br>  doujins when.  Let's go pal  <br>That's a big dog</br>  <br>for you</br>  <br><br>Was taking the knot part of your plan?</br></br>  Homeless people often take on pets as companions and are especially loyal towards them.  <br> Having a pet when you can't even feed yourself <br><br>Fucking homeless people..</br></br></br>  <br><br>Have a stitch.<br>Goddamnit all the text was bitch to clear.</br></br></br>  <br>I was waiting for this.</br>  <br>Thankyou based Anon.</br>  <br>humans have emotional as well as physical needs.</br>  <br><br><br>You encouraged me to make another one.<br>Feels good when people like your work.</br></br></br></br>  <br> bitch <br>Oh I bet she was one.</br></br>  <br> ED...WARD.... </br>      <br> Ikkuzo, aibo. </br>      <br> tfw no dog </br>  <br>Homeless can be moe.</br>  <br>You can have the dog, I'll take the girl.</br>  <br> not posting the correct pic </br>    Who do you anticipate being the best girl of Love Live Sunshine?  <br>It's not up to them and it doesn't really work that way with this franchise which is essentially a 30 minute a week game commercial.</br>  <br><br>The best part is you know somebody is going to pay that price.</br></br>    <br><br>I remember when it first launched people laughed at the idea that it could ever be another idolMaster thing. Now there's Aikatsu, Love Live and idolMASTER all at the same time all insanely profitable. Not that Bamco really needs anymore cash cows. Dragon Ball starting up again too means it'll likely become an ever bigger profit machine for them.<br><br>Judging by how Aqours first single has been charting without so much as a hint of what their music sounds like or a picture I'd say Sunshine is probably going to do fine. Love Live probably has brand power at this point.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I like Love Live well enough but sometimes it's dominance along with the other Namco idol stuff scares me. Nobody should be allowed to have 3 hugely popular idol franchises on top of Gundam and all the other shit they own. I mean Yamakan can barely manage to get one off the ground.</br></br>  K-On on motorcicles. Last season KyoAni was sponsored by Yamaha, next by Suzuki. Seems they found a new funding model.<br><br>http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/664<wbr>41</wbr></br></br>  <br>No it was obviously a magical girl nukige adaptation with the porn cut out, with goethe's quote written on the wall, so deep</br>  <br>This is the headline:<br> アニメ化も決定してる漫画『ばくおん！！』仕様の公式痛バイクが発売決定<wbr>！　</wbr> <br> An anime for the "Bakuon!!" manga has been green-lit!! An itasha-bike has also been announced! <br><br> 京アニが作れば <br> If KyoAni made this... <br><br> 京アニ待ってるぞ <br> KyoAni, I'm waiting <br><br> 京アニでやれ <br> I want KyoAni to do it <br><br> 京アニだと信じている <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128308771#p128312168">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hipster(s) upset because neither /a/ nor japan gave a single damn about their shitty show   <br>You are right here, and I shouldn't have directly my shitposting towards the show specially because it hasn't even aired, and I have't read the manga.<br>My problem is with /a/ who hops on the kyoanus bus no matter what is made, and even when using the same advertising/collaboration methods, they won't bat an eye at kyo but not even gainax is allowed to do this without being shit on. It just proves again that /a/ has shit taste.</br></br>  <br><br>Well maybe it wasn't for you then, I thought the space stuff was amazing. Seeing them go further and further every episode was great and the final with the last fragment in a black hole was great.</br></br>  She never smiles.<br>She is always with a blank expression.<br>It is very weird for someone of her age, I guess she does have autism.</br></br>    <br>It's different if it's Europe.</br>  <br>This. Didn't you know? Everyone in Europe is constantly drunk from birth, so it can't be helped. Also they are all way shorter than grorious nips due to being stunted barbarians.<br><br>Shit like this must be why the Paris Syndrome exists.</br></br></br>    <br>But the maps in the last OVA confirmed they were in Japan the whole time.</br>  What do you guys think of DBS so far? Three episodes thus far and it has a slice-of-life feel, episode two with Vegeta's family vacation was enjoyable to me. I know this is just setup but I almost wish we could get past the BoG stuff and start progressing with new material. So far episodes follow a pattern of focusing on SoL stuff and Beerus wrecking things.  <br>The whole series from now on will be set on that boat.</br>  <br>  source my ass and i'm a literal faggot </br>   yfw you won't be a kid and listen to Chala Head Chala for the first time again <br><br>Is this the most Iconic Opening of an Anime series?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GHn<wbr>fX1RmZX8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>  Dragonball has and always will be about the good things in life. <br>Then why is it been about how Goku and Vegeta think that everything is gay except training?<br>Dragonball also had the element of going to new places seeing new people and watching Goku learn new shit. Pretty sure DBS will have barely any of that. At least not for 2 arcs. DBS is pretty shit compared to Dragonball</br></br></br>  <br>yes it is.</br>  Continuation of the former thread.  <br>Urie didn't demand meat after his psycho attack. All he did was attacking relentlessly.</br>  <br>Sure why not.</br>  <br>They do, but that's clearly not why Urie was crazy there, he certainly wasn't showing symptoms during the other parts of the raid.<br>And besides, if he was hungry he would've been grabbing for meat rather than slashing to kill.</br></br>  <br>Get back to SoL containment then. I don't know how you can tolerate such a dumb faggot.</br>  <br>Can't he be saying sorry because he's fucking insane and killing people left and right? <br>Like I said, Kaneki said it countless times. He said sorry because he was going insane. <br>Seido ate lots of people probably so he's even more crazy and that's why he says that. <br><br>I just don't think it's possible because a Ghoul investigators family should be protected by obvious reasons and there was no mention of something happening.</br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
