Is Anna actually Lewd herself?  AOTS period, only Non Non Byori stands a chance.  <br>They should have went with a butthole, even more ambiguous</br>  <br> when they start to fight unironically with terrorist. <br>People going to drop this shit so fucking quick.<br>Is going to be delicious.</br></br></br>  <br>A real man like me<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tx1<wbr>mryKqvT8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>yes, unfortunately. Not sure if there's any uncensored subs out right now</br>  <br>She's a person, people are born lewd.<br>She doesn't understand her own lewdness, or even realize that lewdness is what it is, but I assure you her loins lest like any other.</br></br>  <br>PM's on steroids<br>We all better buy a dog</br></br>  <br>Aren't they doing it unironically already?</br>  <br> show about freedom fighters protesting excessive censorship <br> is excessively censored <br>What a world we live in.</br></br></br>  <br>that sucks man, plus I think none of the volumes are translated yet, the anime might cover 2-4 volumes and adding the time it takes to translate those volumes... will be quite a few years until new content. really sucks, I'd place my hope on the manga but then again... only 2 chapters translated.</br>  <br>If that one picture is any indication, she might be a sniffing pervert.<br>And gorilla is probably gay.</br></br>  <br>Ohys-Raws are AT-X, use the senketsu subs with them and you're set.</br>  I can't wait to find out who has the anal kink.  <br> Funi </br>  <br>At least they're decent enough if you don't want to wait and want to watch it immediatly.</br>  <br>Normally I'd guess the main girl because she was made for it, but a name like "Anna" is just too perfect.

I hadn't noticed that. I'm sure it's a typo, but still pretty funny.</br>  <br>Sasuga shit scans</br>  Why is Megumi gonna get expelled? She's just a helper, this Cart is all Soma's.  Also pajama tadakoro is love  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>They register as a team, the whole member would be expelled if they fail.</br>  <br>I honestly don't know considering he filled out all the official paperwork without her and only put his name on it.</br>  <br> They register as a team <br>He didn't though.</br></br>  <br>  Nene 4th, above Tsukasa, Swordbro and Isshiki <br><br>Nice. I hope she gets into the top 3 on the second day.</br></br></br>  Don senpai a cute.  <br>pajama girls are good. I think we've seen Yuuki and Ryouko in pajamas too? Or am I imagining that?</br>  I'm not sure if Alice actually has a plan or if she's just fucking around.  <br>This is the face of man who manipulates the bitches for his convenience.</br>  Does this mean that Souma is doing night-time vending?   Erina not gloating and singing to high heavens that he is in danger of getting expelled <br> actually telling him to focus on beating Kuga  <br><br>Who broke Erina?</br></br></br>  <br>No one likes the Yugi wannabe.</br>   Akira finally understands Ryou's suffering   <br>So nobody can help a guy out?</br>  <br>I like how they are becoming bros. Its a shame Soma isn't bro'ing it up and is always with the girls.</br>  <br>YouDon'tEvenKnow.jpg</br>  <br>Megumi noted that he didn't use all the left over ingredients for the buns he shared with them. Maybe he's taking his extra stuff and handing out free samples after hours to build up hype.<br><br><br>They still aren't friends or anything, but things have changed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because both Ryou and Hayama have literally no friends and are unsociable fucks, they need each other.</br>  <br><br>Dojima hinted that Akira, Ryou and Soma will become some sort of a trio of rivals but it doesn't seem to look like that in recent chapters.</br></br>  <br>Why are they impressed by Isshiki being just 7th? I'm pretty disappointed and so should they.</br>  <br>Because he's selling cheap food in the rich people area.<br>Look at Erina for example who has a fixed income influx, which I hope she changes because she's not beating the loli that way.</br></br>  WHO WAS THE HAND?  <br>Isshiki is literally doing cabbage patch friends with his dorm mates, he just wants to have fun an make good memories.</br>   Just buns first day <br> Buns and noodles day 2 <br><br>If he brings a new menu item out each day to drive hype that'd be pretty fucking cool. It has an impact that having the whole menu available from the beginning doesn't, and encourages customers to stop at the cart as return customers daily to try something new.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Smoker</br></br>  <br>Yeah, Soma is being left out so he can have more screen time with the girls. Can't say I'm happy about that.<br><br>Pretty sure he's going to drop it all together and switch Soma back to Takumi exclusively, now that the latter seems to got back on track.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Erina isn't able to take first place by the end of the festival.</br>  <br>Hisako talking to her again, and Hisako being friends with Soma</br>  <br> NakiriRapeDungeon.jpg </br>  <br>There probably is one; I don't have the scan though, so I can't help here.</br>  <br>mimisaka</br>  <br>watch it be Eizan o some shit looking to fuck over Yugi.</br>  <br>The hand looks more comparable to Souma's than Megumi's dainty hand on the same page, so I'm inclined to think it's a guy.</br>  <br><br>I can't help but feel that Erina is a lot more lenient on Soma cause of how she noticed Hisako being friendly with him. Maybe not for herself but more like out of respect for Hisako, her only friend ever, she's trying to tone shit down in spite of it all.<br><br>Who knows, I'm liking the subtle defrosting this arc has done on her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, thanks anyway. We really should compile all the recipes into a cookbook.</br>  I thought everyone participated in the festival? What are the other Elite Ten members doing? Are they actually not even in the top 10?  <br>I think it's Houjou, she's onee-sama tier and manly as fuck.</br>  So out of 3 days he only got 35th place on day 2, I can't even think of how he can beat Yugi in 1 day, but this smile makes me think there is about to be a glorious asspull<br>What will he do?</br>  <br>I think he'll get to top 10-5 in day 4 and Yugi will panic because of his promise with Tsukasa.<br>He will fucking murder Souma if he beats him last day.</br></br>  <br>It's not gonna be an asspull since it's something that has been getting obviously set up since like 3 chapters ago.<br><br>What's really the question is if it's gonna make any damn sense or not.</br></br></br>  <br> switch Soma back to Takumi exclusively <br><br> Souma is a sexual slave of Takumi, Takumi is gentle with him but Souma still doesn't like it. Then Souma is taken away and brutally sodomized by Kurokiba and Currynigger at the same time. Them Takumi somehow gets him back and Souma realize that he is happy to be Takumi's dick slave exclusively <br><br>This was born in my head just from one sentence.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that Nao watching him? Is she finally getting some development?</br>  <br> Erina ships Souma with best girl <br><br>Good...Good.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's just a cameo.<br>Unfortunately.</br></br>   They had to put Jobberia Aldini with the nobodies just so that he'd be able to compete <br><br>top kek</br></br>  <br> so that he'd be able to compete <br> most popular shop in the most popular area with the most shops <br>Meanwhile the idiot trio keeps flunking.</br></br></br>  <br> Hayama. <br> Ryou. <br> Alice. <br> Nobodies. <br><br>Aldinis aren't even interested in competing anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that edgy hair and eye color change <br>why did you make her design look like shit</br></br>  <br> Alice <br> not the failure of Nakiri family </br></br>  <br>I bet it's going to be Eizan.</br>  <br> best girl <br> a failure </br></br>  <br>Like Erina said, not everyone is there to make the most money and top the rankings. We already know what Isshiki wants from the festival. A wonderful memory for him and his precious kohai from the dorm. On top of that he's giving them some useful experience competing in the most exclusive area filled with 3rd years and the elite 10.<br><br><br>Erina may be using reservations of out necessity. Let's be honest, she's a triple threat of popularity which will attract interest in her shop. She's not just one of the elite 10, she's also the bearer of god's tongue, and the heir to the Nakiris and granddaughter to the food demon king.<br><br>I don't know how many cooks she's set up in her kitchen, but I doubt it's anything like Yugi's bald army. And that means that if she allowed walk ins, there would probably be a line stretching blocks that would take hours. That does little good since it would make potential customers really angry waiting for so long.

Good thing SnSfags know better than to take the bait.</br>  <br>That makes sense.

Kurokiba only listens to Alice and Hayama is prideful as fuck. Even if she gave them proper instructions I think they might experience creative differences.</br>  <br> Fuck you for placing Yukino in last place you fucking faggot.   Assuming you're speaking about Yukinoshita Yukino. <br><br>Is Soma going to sell his buns outside of the one with disgusting smell? So that he steals her costumers or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Hayama has Jun.</br>  <br> Toruya <br>I'm inclined to think that's a typo, because the kanji said "Touya" IIRC and Toruya would be a very unusual Japanese name. Then again, this is manga.</br></br>  <br>She's packing up for the day, so obviously not.</br>  Erina has started to become pretty fucking great. <br><br>She has been helping Soma for a while now, telling him the problems, key issues he isn't understanding properly. <br><br>She's really taking care of the people who are rather close to her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that he changed his location is a bit disappointing for me. I thought the entire point was for him to defeat 8th seat right in front of him and to take all of his customers.</br>  <br> Kurokiba <br> listening to Alice <br> Erina  <br> making simple mistakes like ordering the wrong ingredients or changing the menu all the fucking time <br>Under Erina, they'd swallow their pride and do their job, because it'd work.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's always been great, just not so great with Souma</br>  Shokugeki no Souma x Isobe Isobee Monogatari i done at http://imgur.com/a/rY6Rd. I'd also upload it onto Batoto but the chapter uploader isn't cooperating at the moment. Sorry my redrawing isn't that good.  <br>He was selling in front of Kuga throughout the day. I don't think he's selling; I suspect he's giving away his extra stuff as marketing.<br><br>Sales are tallied at the end of the day, so if he tried selling stuff at night it wouldn't count.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt night sales don't count, I mean, the daily count stops at 6 pm which is still really early.</br>  <br>Thanks for your work.<br>Now we only need that omake from the recipe book and Royal to translate the other IIM extra.</br></br>  <br>that's a better depiction of erina than in the source material</br>  <br>That sounds like a very reasonable time of day to end a school festival actually.</br>  <br>But not the Totsuki school festival where food is the main appeal, chefs serving diners seems appropriate.</br>  <br>probably taking the cart somewhere outside of tootsuki to  another moon offering festival  and gathering clients there</br>  <br> Guts vs Griffith </br>  <br>wat</br>  <br><br>If it had a sleeve I would have been sure it was newspaper kid, helping him drum up hype by publishing articles about one of the festival's mysteries: the roaming cart with amazing Chinese dishes served for a limited time. You can only figure out what it's serving at the moment if you manage to find it.</br></br>  <br><br> Isshiki <br> 3rd year </br></br></br>  Is it starting?  <br>I recognise this design.</br>  <br>Erina wasn't being objective.</br>  How long till Casanova release? Viz is so shit its unbelievable.  <br>Tomorrow. Viz comes out every monday.</br>  Has anybody tried making the more complex recipes in the manga?  <br>If you're the anon who posted ketchup with rice on a thread a while ago i want you to know you always make me laugh like a retarded hyena<br>Keep it up you glorious motherfucker</br></br>  <br> yellow cream <br>uhh</br></br>  <br>A true gourmet?</br>  <br>oh god</br>  What is the noodle dish?<br><br>Presumable it has something to do with the left overs from the first day.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure. We didn't see Souma experimenting with noodles when he was setting up for the festival, so it seems unlikely that it would be something very complicated.</br>  <br>M-muh heart</br>  <br> We didn't see Souma experimenting with noodles when he was setting up for the festival <br><br>That's exactly right, he didn't. You know what that means? He and Megumi didn't make the noodle dish. Here's my bet: the crafty little fucker has franchised his food cart.<br><br>Souma was going over the rankings to see who else was struggling in the red. Then he went around to those people with samples of his meat buns. (That's where the extra ingredients went.) Someone bought in for the second day and set up their own foot cart under Souma's banner, with him and Megumi supplying the meat buns and the new person supplying the noodle dish for both carts.<br><br>Now he's got the ranking jump to show for it, and he's going to go back to the people still in the red. The third day? There's going to be twenty food carts under his banner, each with a multiplied selection of dishes on offer.<br><br>See, Souma realized this event isn't about cooking, it's about running a business. So that's how he's going to win.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I certainly hope he pays her a visit. I can see it now.<br> "It looks like Yukihira Souma climbed the rankings again. What is he doing I wonder? W-wait. I-I don't care about what he's doing! I should be getting back to w-" <br> Sees Souma's cart just outside her shop <br> She's shocked but surprisingly glad at the same time </br></br></br></br>  <br> McSoma's McMeat Buns (c) </br>  <br>The franchising idea would certainly be a brilliant idea. Souma brings in his brand name as an autumn election finalist. <br>He wouldn't be hunting down people in the red though, since evidently, only Alice and Souma were in the red for the first day.</br></br>  <br>That is a cool idea but I don't think it's very souma-like or fitting with the theme of the manga.</br>  Just as an update for the people waiting on the LN translation, I'm a little under halfway done with the first chapter but still have some business to take care of that will probably be over by the end of the weekend so I expect it to be done with the TL sometime next week.  <br>Thank you very much for your work, based anon.<br>Do you plan to translate all the three volumes?</br></br>  <br>I like this idea. I also liked the other anon's idea is that he would make himself the mythical elusive cart. But from a plot point of view, but your idea makes a lot more sense.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> who else was struggling in the red <br>not commenting on the rest of the idea, just going to point out that according to the chapter, that's just him and Alice's group.</br></br>  How could anyone have been surprised when Gon acted like an hypocrite? He's been that way since the exam arc, when he didn't have a problem with using someone else's death at his advantage (and was actually hoping for it) but only if it wasn't one of his friends.<br>Even Zepile noticed that he doesn't give a shit about right or wrong as long as it doesn't concern or benefit him directly.</br>  Gon  Were people surprised? It felt like a natural, albeit extreme, culmination of his character flaws when faced with a situation he couldn't handle. <br><br>Fucking scary though.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, i've seen a few posts who said they didn't understand why Gon changed so much, when in reality he hardly changed but just was pushed past his breaking point.<br>Also i don't think it wasn't only a culmination of his flaws, but of everything that defined him as a character.</br></br>  <br>You're right, not just his flaws but also his good traits like optimism and determination. I really loved that aspect of it.</br>  <br>So he's like kid Goku.</br>    Gon is so cute  I really like Gon, he's a great and precious character.  <br>yeah but it was subtle enough to pass the radar<br><br>the Crimera ant thing was much more easy to notice</br></br></br>  <br>gon a best</br>  What a nice kid.  <br>I wish Shoot got to thank him. He needs that right now, kind words and praise</br>  Hypocrisy is a construction of society, though. That's where the idea of holding yourself to some sort of stated set of values came from.<br><br>Gon just like what he like, and don't like what he don't like. It's the same as when Goreinu wanted to shit on Bomber, but but wanted to heal Killua instead. <br><br>That being said Gon needs to learn to chill the fuck out and he doesn't learn that lesson from being 99% dead then fuck him</br></br></br></br>  Tell me /a/, where does he place on the character alignment?  <br>definitely chaotic neutral</br>  <br>People cannot handle characters in shounen handling situations like real people would in real life. They think hypocrites are poorly written characters<br><br>Gon is a kid who needed to decide between avenging one of the few truly influential figures in his life or getting through with the rescue plan safely</br></br></br>  <br>Hisoka is Chaotic Neutral. Gon is Lawful Good, that's why he was so conflicted in the first place.</br>  <br> Gon is Lawful Good <br>What makes you say that? I've started rereading the CA arc and the only part where Gon seems truly "good" is when he tries to rush and stop Yunju from crushing one of the guys he kept on a leash.</br></br>  <br>Gon also could not understand how the Genei Ryodan would kill people they didn't know.</br>  <br>Nah, he's neutral good if anything. maybe chaotic good.</br>  Gon will be a fucking monster if he has to, it's just that he acts nice in normal settings.  <br>There was also this guy.</br>  <br>Can we say he tries really hard to be Lawful Good? I mean, Neutral Good and Chaotic Good are definitely Kurapika and Leorio</br>  <br>He isn't acting.</br>  <br>Isn't Kurapika more like chaotic neutral?</br>  <br>If he were Chaotic Neutral he wouldn't care about the eyes anymore as they serve no purpose to him. Him wanting to serve justice means he has some good, albeit twisted, inside of him.</br>  <br>He got mad at the Spiders for indiscriminately killing people with no regard for their lives.</br>  Since we're discussing alignment now, let me try to give the best examples for the remaining ones:<br>Lawful Neutral - Netero. Otherwise he would have gone on a dojo rampage after becoming super strong instead of becoming chairman.<br>True Neutral - Zeno. The Ant situation barely phased the Zoldycks and Komugi dying made him lament not being able to act truly neutral.<br>Lawful Evil - Meruem. Don't think there's a lot to discuss from this point onward.<br>Neutral Evil - Genthru.<br>Chaotic Evil - Pariston.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is Illumi?</br>  <br> Meruem <br> evil <br>What? <br>Uvo would be lawful evil.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaotic Neutral, just like Hisoka. He wants to preserve the family hierarchy but at the same time he wants to control Alluka's power.</br>  <br> Lawful Evil - Meruem. <br>get the fuck out of here</br></br>  <br>He could never realize the evil in his ways of maintaining humanity as cattle for the Ants. In fact, his revival only made his become more delusional about his intelligence and the true meaning of equality.</br>  <br> Chaotic Evil - Pariston. </br>  <br>Pariston stop posting</br>  <br>See<br><br><br>Although I can agree maybe we already have better examples. I'd like to place Chrollo and the Spiders or Gyro in that spot but we have no clue what their motives are.<br>their motivations are</br></br></br></br></br>  YOU    <br><br>lawful evil is pouf, completely bound to the 'rule' of serving meruem</br></br>  <br>CAN</br>  <br>But that was what he was biologically programmed for. Those were his innate instincts, there was nothing evil about it at all. He forgave Pouf, wished good luck to Welfin, spared Knuckle's and Meleoron's lives, judged himself unworthy of his RG's loyalty and gave up on everything once he remembered the thing he truly cared about as a person.<br>He is not evil in the slightest.</br></br>  <br><br>More like Teen Gohan 2.0<br><br>You do know the ENTIRE Chimera Ant Arc is based of the Cell saga, right? <br><br>Culmination of DNA built into one "perfect" being? <br>Check<br>Netero sacrificing himself for humanity? (Do I hear Goku?) <br>Check<br>Netero power up scene in front of Colt IDENTICAL TO GOKU POWER UP SCENE IN FRONT OF KORIN where both are told they're not strong enough? <br>Check<br>Self-destruction bomb used (TRIED to be used in DBZ) on perfect being? <br>Check<br>Young boy realising tremulous power that culmunates from hatred? <br>Check<br><br>Toriyama doesn't get enough credit for basically being the grand daddy of modern Shonen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ho before bros <br> not evil </br></br>  Pariston is more chaotic neutral than evil IMO.<br><br><br> more delusional about his intelligence <br>What do you mean? Meruem was very smart and capable of rationalizing moral values; the only issue was that his standards stemmed from a position in which Ants were the key species, not us.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Teen Gohan 2.0 <br>How exactly? I'm curious, it's been a while since i read DBZ.<br> Toriyama doesn't get enough credit for basically being the grand daddy of modern Shonen <br>I'm pretty sure he does get an immense amount of credit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the whole point was what would a perfect being like that actually think and feel upon coming into existence. Kind of like how Gon was like what if a super optimistic stereotypical shounen protagonist actually existed and had to deal with things like loss and failure?<br><br>It's no secret that Togashi takes influence from Dragon Ball</br></br></br>  <br>I understand where you're coming from but I'm judging him on the perspective of the story as a whole, not on each character's nature.<br><br>For example, maybe the Ryodan have a good reason for killing all those people, but none would make them be good. If I were to judge them from their perspective, they would be heroes.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never hold hands with Gon </br>  which part of hunter x hunter left the biggest impression on you? it was netero vs. meruem for me. the scale and brutality of that fight was insane.  <br>116 for sure.</br>  <br>The dodgeball game</br>  <br>gon and killua</br>  <br>Pushed to his breaking point. A usually young, playful, caring boy having power brought out by rage. Gohan's character changed when fighting Cell. He never liked fighting, but after going Super Saiyan 2 he only wanted to punish Cell. Make him feel pain and fear instead of killing him quickly. Basically torturing him. Though with the speed of DBZ, that phase didn't last too long. Gon, on the other hand, is an even more extreme version and is drawn out more, as you can see from Hunter X Hunter.</br>  <br>That picture is so disingenuous because Madhouse altered the events of the first chapter.</br>  <br>Not really altered, just rearanged.<br>Doesn't change the fact that everything you see in the pic would still have been in ep 1 even with the Kite flashback, it's a very short one.</br></br>  <br>This<br><br><br>If we're talking about scenes, though, it's definitely this:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VYQ<wbr>rOXbznKs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Few were able to better flesh out characters like this scene did with Ging and Gon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay anon, at least we have this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nDg<wbr>WDlvvaNQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Probably that one scene of Kaito under that cherry blossom tree at the end of GI, even though it's like one page. Netero vs Meruem was great too, I really liked the analogies of the field of needles and a contest in which one must consecutively make the correct choice.</br>  <br>This part. It sent chills down my spine when I first read it.</br>  <br>Togashi's really good at conveying expressions. Most other mangaka would have everyone looking shocked instead of tailoring it to each character's personality.</br>  <br><br>the yorknew arc made me realize this wasn't going to be an average shonen. aside from uvo, the phantom troupe all remained alive and escaped, as opposed to becoming structured 'boss battles' for kurapika. chrollo was also a very interesting 'villain', i haven't really seen anyone like him before.</br></br>  <br><br>gon-san jadedly smashing what remained of pitou's head, still muttering his rock-paper-scissors callout.</br></br>  <br>This is the essence of HxH</br>  <br>Right? The part with Gon and Killua following Kurapika's plan from Leorio's directions really sealed the deal for me.<br><br>Chrollo also looks like he's in just as much of a struggle as Kurapika to get to his objective, from the fight against Silva and Zeno.</br></br></br>  As someone who recently watched the 2011 anime then went back and read the manga, what is the justification for not showing Kaito's flashback at the very beginning? It seems like a pointless change.  anyone else find greed island just sort of...clumsy? the dodgeball finale was great but i thought the rest of it was all over the place.  <br>Gohan had gotten angry before and the thing that changed about his character was the maturation past his cowardly nature. He only needed a little push at that point and that's why Goku had him fight Cell. <br><br>Sure it was rage that brought him there, but he was still himself and was even still holding himself back.<br><br>More or less, Gohan is a regular person psychologically where as Goku and Gon are sociopaths.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty angry at the 2011 adaptation for making him look so fucking ugly. His appearance along with his somewhat disturbing facial expression was a big part of his charisma.</br>  <br>Same here. It had a lot of potential, specially since Togashi looked like he was gonna follow some RPG structure, but it turned out to be more like... all sidequests? It was cool that he managed to fit in the training sequence with Bisky in it without it feeling forced, though.</br>  <br>This video reminds me that we don't see enough of HxH's beasts. We see pterodactyls and "chocobo" in Kurapika's flashback arc, though. Where the fuck did he live?</br>  <br>These<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QvNU<wbr>kqHni6o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>he looks too 'cute' in 2011. in the manga it's impossible to determine what he's thinking, which makes him eerie/more of an effective antagonist.</br></br>  <br><br>Greed Island is a mess, the card system just slows the story down and the 'reveal' of it not being a game at all was pretty poorly done. I'm fine with the twist itself, but it didn't carry any weight.</br></br>  Hajimeruyooo~  <br>Nothing. Madhouse fucked up immensely.</br>  <br><br>all i can think of is to build mystery when gon/killua finish GI and encounter him under the tree. so the audience has more of a 'who the fuck is that' reaction rather than 'oh, it's kite'.</br></br>  <br>There WAS no reason. There's a lot of things Madhouse messed up on</br>  <br>GI is an amazing arc. Its obvious you dont enjoy it if you cant follow the meaning of the game for Gon's pals and for the rest of the players.</br>  <br> it didn't carry any weight. <br>I'm fairly certain it wasn't supposed to be an important plot point, they kind of just shrugged it off.</br></br>  <br>Director's waifu was certainly true</br>  <br>HxH is all over the place in case you haven't noticed. It's an intentional design.</br>  <br>Do you thin shonen characters turn strongers just because of power of friendship? Yes, GI is a "training" arc, but it gives a great sifnificant of nen and it gives too the support of how much Gon and Killua become stronger during the arc. And thats the reason why Biske is so important in the plot.</br>  <br>Damn, that directing is pretty fucking good. I think i need to rewatch the old version.</br>  <br>No, he understood how they could kill people they didn't know, he didn't understand how they could feel upset over their own being killed and nothing over anyone else.</br>  <br>I think you're almost right. He didn't understand how they could do it, but he wasn't upset at them for it, it seemed like he genuinely wanted to understand why. The only thing that made him upset is the fact that they could feel bad over one of their members being killed.</br>  <br>I watched the show first and that was my exact reaction. Thought it was kind of cool how they just jumped straight into the next arc with a new character we knew nothing about.</br>  <br>It felt structured like a training arc meant to give Gon and Killua their nen abilities.<br><br>The ending to it was contrived. <br> "Everyone who came here was prepared to die, that's why we're letting their killers live". <br><br>Aside from its resolution, it was a decent but lighthearted arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And, obviously, GI is much better in manga than any anime version (OVA version is awful).</br>  There would be no issues if people would just be his friend. But no, they just have to be the antagonists. They chose their own fate  <br>I thought the OVA was okay. Then again this was a long time ago. I don't really know.</br>  <br> 'oh, it's kite'. <br>I was actually very happy to see him again after like 180 chapters because he's a really cool guy.</br></br>  <br>easily the dragon dive scene, it gives me shivers no matter how many times i rewatch. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=86M<wbr>oueTiBXE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a big fan of the 99 version. I think it had the best version of York Shin and I complain a lot about the 11 version for its directorial flaws.<br><br>The GI OVAs however were fucking shite.</br></br></br>  <br><br>and now he's a loli.</br></br>  <br><br>pouf going apeshit is great.</br></br>  <br>Dat episode</br>  <br> 1:08 <br>God damn, Zeno's VA REALLY nailed that part</br></br>   watch the first Madhouse movie thinking it's gonna be great with more Troupe interactions <br> they don't do shit in the whole movie and instead it's about the edgy chuuni villain and his imouto complex <br> has more Killua Illumi angst even though he canonically can't get over it yet since he doesn't pull out the needle until later <br>Boy was that a disappointment. Is the other movie any better?</br></br></br>  <br>He's a natural born psychopath. The way he absorb things after he left his house is like a sponge. Whether it's good or bad he takes interest in it without a second consideration. His concept of "good" is only imitation because that's what his aunt taught when he grow up with her. Imagine Gon was growing up in the same place as Chrollo, his perception and personality would fall to the later personality. He might even be crazier than Chrollo.</br>  <br>No. The movies are basically fanfics.</br>  <br>I love how Togashi just added a narrator to the final half of the CA arc. When he's talking about the Ants it looks like a National Geographic documentary.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with the art on that page.</br>  <br>Togashi stop posting and make a new chapter</br>  <br> Pitou's expressions </br>  <br> Is the other movie any better? <br> <br>I enjoyed it a lot more since Gon and Killua actually have their abilities instead of just Ten/Ren, but it definitely wasn't a masterpiece by any means.</br></br></br>  What gender is Pitou actually?  <br>Please don't start</br>  <br>Probably female, but we'll never know for sure</br>  <br>That's why I said Gohan 2.0<br><br>But Gon got angry before that point too? For both of them it was their breaking point and power up. <br><br>Like I said, Gon was more extreme and willing to kill an innocent person for his selfish purposes, whereas Gohan as willing to keep everyone on danger by keeping Cell alive for his own selfish purposes, which isn't as extreme, but is similar. Whereas, Gon is the more extreme version in an arc that seems to have taken away from Gohan's arc, which makes him Gohan 2.0</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You tell me</br>  <br>Transnigger</br>  <br>that's a cat</br>  <br>He was put in a similar situation, but with his own circumstances and has pretty different morals and personality. That hardly makes him Gohan 2.0. <br>But i do understand where you're coming from.</br></br>  <br>Wrong, that's a  cute </br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>she's a fucking ant, are you really this desperate?</br>  <br>a psychopath wouldn't get that angry over kite's death</br>  <br><br>Was he? i always felt he was some kind of psicopath/ sociopath...</br></br>  Isn't Shu the one where they focus their aura on a weapon?  <br>They are more likely than a normal person.</br>  <br>He was angry because he was a factor in Kite's death, not just over it. I don't think he would have reacted the same way if it wasn't the case.<br><br>That's correct, but Ko is when all your aura is concentrated into a single point. Shu is just making your aura flow through an object.</br></br></br>  <br>i guess he means because it's from the perspective of a guy who just got conked on the head by a very heavy super yo yo</br>  <br> gon growing up raised by an assassin family <br> killua raised by mito in the mountains <br> they meet each other <br>they'd still like each other</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon punching Hisoka.</br>  <br>No altered, very little of chapter 1 is actually in the 2011 adaptation.</br>  <br>That or he has Asperger's Syndrome.</br>  <br>They are more likely to act violent, but Gon had real feelings involved. He was just as sad as he was angry. Togashi wouldn't make Gon a psychopath.</br>  <br> Togashi wouldn't make Gon a psychopath <br><br>Really.</br></br></br>  <br>He isn't anon.</br>  A psychopath doesn't experience emotions the same way a normal person does. Nor do they have a conscience. Chrollo may be one. But gon certainly isn't. He has a conscience and a set of morals. Albeit an odd one.  <br>as i explained on<br><br><br>People can't deal with their characters not always sticking to a set behavior, so they try to address one to them themselves<br><br>Gon gets called a psychopath even though he has very well structured emotions and moral reasoning through the entire story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or they're just moralfags who can't get it through their heads that HxH doesn't follow their moral compass.</br>  <br><br>The nen system feels so authentic with the way everything has a checks and balances system. <br><br>You need more physical power? Use Ko on your fist/leg/object but subject to yourself to more damage since all your aura concentrated on a specific place leaves you defenseless <br><br>Need more defense? Increase your Ten into a Ken state but you won't be able to maintain it since it drains your aura(stamina) at a rapid pace <br><br>Ryu doesn't even need a name or be identified since it's something every Nen user does in battle by applying more aura to a specific body part in real time combat whether it be for offense or defense <br><br>Need Stealth? Stop your aura flow with Zetsu but again subject yourself to increased damage <br><br>Then throw in how emotions affect Nen, Vows/Contracts, and finally something of a beast on its own, Hatsu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Chimera Ant so polarizing?  <br>It drags out a lot</br>  <br><br>I think it's the best arc of the series but even I can see it has some pacing issues. <br><br>115, and 130(and the respective manga chapters) are literally blue ball episodes which setup high points for the arc</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the manga the pacing isn't terrible but because of the constant hiatuses it took a while for it to finally end. So people got arc fatigue. For a while readers had a similar reaction to Greed Island arc because it took so long to end.<br><br>The 2011 adaptation didn't help things by dragging on the arc.</br></br></br>  <br> The 2011 adaptation didn't help things by dragging on the arc. <br>Uh oh. So it's probably better to read rather than watch?</br></br>  <br>Just do whatever the fuck you want. Both are essentially the same as far as pacing goes, albeit with slight atmospheric differences.</br>  <br>Yes, Gon definitely comes across as sane. He was just having a bad day was all.</br>  <br>Considering how the 2011 cut out key parts of the MC's backstory which plays a part in his involvement in the same arc that MADHOUSE was rushing to get to, I'd say it was doomed for failure.<br><br>At this point in time only really 2011fags who'll claim that Madhouse handled it well.</br></br></br>  <br>I watched first, and it wasn't horrible. The parts where it drags on have incredibly badass fights inbetween so it's not too bad, I've certainly seen much much worse. It never got even close to bad enough where I considered skipping through episodes or skipping episodes altogether.</br>  <br>Is Arturo Vidal a HxH fan?</br>  <br>It's the most ambitious arc that achieves the most in the story, but things on that scale are more susceptible to flaws. Most people cite pacing as the worst part but I found it just fine in the manga, I think it's just a big risk to bring in a bunch of new characters and dedicate a lot of time to each of their role/development. Instead of everything being resolved linearly, it's split up and if you're really into one storyline it will annoy you to switch to another. <br><br><br>Nen is really cleverly written and so well thought out, particularly the vow and limitation part from the writers perspective. It's a built in resolution and conflict plot device, you can solve nearly anything but it forces the character to deal with conflict at the same time.</br></br></br></br>  115 and 116 were such good episodes though that they made me stop being anime only and i read the rest of the manga<br>was not disappointed</br>    Is anyone else here a retard that spoils the ending of CA because they looked up how long each arc was?  <br>I spoiled Ging appearing and being an active character by watching the last 2011 opening</br>  Pitou - lawful girl  <br>ptiou was so obviously neutral evil</br>  <br>I'm one of those idiots who can't resist reading threads and even reading through archived threads while in the middle of watching a show. I'm still so mad at myself for spoiling Meruem's death.</br>  Just finished the anime and "caught up" with the manga.<br><br>5 &gt; 4 = 1 &gt;&gt; 3 &gt; 6 = 2<br><br>Some people shit on Chimera, but I think it's a flawed masterpiece.<br><br>What do you guys think about the story continuing after 339? I think the story found it's natural conclusion in the tree, and outside of some unfinished plot strands like Hisoka and Illumi's arc, I thought the story ended at a perfect time. IMO, HxH continuing with a new arc is an enormous mistake as it's committing to an enormous story (that doesn't need to be told) for an overall saga that frankly isn't as sustainable long term as One Piece. I feel like the ideal scenario is to finish the story conclusively over 20-30 chapters and just let it rest, if not retcon the last ten chapters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A V <br><br>you blind fuck</br></br></br>  <br> it's split up and if you're really into one storyline it will annoy you to switch to another.  <br>This so much. I think this arc has great reread/rewatch value because once you know what happens you pay more attention to the details of each scene.</br></br>  <br> lmao pitou btfo</br>  Yupi is best RG.  <br>The story was always fucking meant to continue after CA arc.<br><br>Kurapika and fucking LEorios objectives hadn't been resolved.</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually the opposite situation to One Piece. In One Piece, there is a lot of build up for the mystery of One Piece, but with HxH the entire series was Gon getting sidetracked or even forgetting about Ging, so of course it makes sense for when we finally do meet him for it to be nothing special and for the story to continue on beyond that, because ultimately Ging was nothing special. Gon even points that out when he Talks to Mito.</br>  <br> more than half of the plot points are left unresolved <br> it's done guys <br>Nope</br></br></br>  <br>wow<br><br>ant arc was just about character growth...and the change in relationship between Killua and Gon..it wasnt the ultimate build up of hxh<br><br>Gon meeting Ging at the end was just a sidenote.<br><br>Other plotlines were still as important....also What Ging has been up to and his main objective has been scratched at multiple times in the manga.<br><br>The Dark continent ins the ultimate goal of the ultimate hunters which Ging has been for a while.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Gon is interested in the Dark Continent he just can't go along with Ging is all.</br>    <br>I don't recall Gon being interested in the DC, are you sure about that?</br>  <br>They could have been left as is.<br><br>Kurapika got the eyes back showing he got some level of closure in some context.<br><br>Gon proudly proclaimed Leorio was going to be a doctor during the election's conclusion and that honestly felt good enough.<br><br>As someone who loved HxH and YYH, Togashi doesn't have it in him to give this series the continuation it deserves. 339 left it in a good enough place I think, and definitely a better place than YYH left off even with light unresolved threads.<br><br>And from what we've seen, I think DCE is looking to be the worst arc yet. It feels the same as if they decided to continue Yu Yu Hakusho for a fifth arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> more than half <br><br>Yeah, okay big guy.</br></br></br>  <br>During the talk with Mito, he admits that he wanted to go along with Ging.</br>  What's the word on the hiatus? Do we think we're looking at another 2+ years before it starting up again?<br><br>Trying to decide if I even want to start the new arc.</br></br>  <br>I just checked, i guess you're right. Though i think he just would have been interested in going with Ging, not in the DC itself.</br>  <br>The Spiders are still alive, and we also still don't know why they killed Kurapika's clan either so no there wouldn't be any closure there.<br><br>The election in and of itself was obvious build up for something else.<br><br>Again the story went out of it's way to show that meeting Ging was nothing important, that's why the story continues on afterward.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HxH isn't worth it anon. Save yourself before it's too late.</br>  <br>Don't. Wait for new chapters. The few chapters we have of that arc are basically info dumps and are hyping the DC up really well, it's very frustrating.</br>  <br>How are DC arc and YYH even remotely similar? If Togashi continues the way he has, DC arc is going to be extremely unpredictable and most likely extremely good. All the different characters and plot lines involved have so much potential, he's set it all up so thoroughly and it looks to be on such a huge scale. <br><br>He seemed to have gotten a big burst of inspiration for it, hopefully he commits to it.</br></br></br>  What are the odds Ging is Yusuke Urameshi?<br><br>Damn, he looks, acts, and sounds exactly like a 40 year old Yusuke would.</br></br>  <br>The only that was really resolvevd was Gon meeting Ging, which the story built up as not important. And Leorio becoming a doctor. There are far more plot points left open:<br><br>- The mystery of the dark continent<br>- The Spiders and all of their plot points<br>- Kurapika's revenge<br>- Alluka<br>- Ging's motives</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we also still don't know why they killed Kurapika's clan <br>Anon... for money. There's no mystery at all about why the troupe do things, they're thieves who steal valuable things even if they happen to be body parts.<br><br>You're right that their story is nowhere near resolved though.</br></br></br></br>  Alluka is pretty much to this what Bran is to GoT: A mistake that needs to be dropped as fast as possible.  <br>There are people who honestly do think that the story was just about Gon and Killua's relationship. As well as Gon finding Ging.</br>  <br>Then who ordered it? We just found out who the Spiders were working for, and even then you have the subject of how Kurapika is going to get his revenge on them.</br>  <br> who ordered it? <br>I don't think they're mercenaries, they just sold the body parts.</br></br>  <br>Alluka is actually tied to the dark continent.</br>  <br>Anon we already know who ordered them to do it, my question was rhetorical.</br>  <br> we only post when there's no discussion you guise </br>  <br>My bad, i misunderstood your post.</br>  <br>There are a lot of parts in Chimera Ant that stick out in my head as things I'll remember for a real long time.<br><br> Dragon Dive scene <br> The nightmarish Netero/Meruem scene where the chairman activates the rose bomb <br> Meruem's final hours/the conclusion of that love story (honestly maybe my favorite part in the entire series) <br> Gon turns into an Ultimate Gohan-level monster from pure hate alone just to murder Pitou </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and we also still don't know why they killed Kurapika's clan either <br><br>the Kurta took something from Ryūseigai, Ryūseigai sends the spider to kill the Kurta, Kurapika thanks to her first PMS reveals the location of the Kurta, We reject no one, so take nothing from us.</br></br></br>  <br>Which was only shown after 339, disputing anon's belief that the story could have ended there.</br>   tfw no one has ever tried making a game based on HxH in the modern era <br> tfw the only appearances are in the Jump fighting games <br><br>Is there a chance of this series ever getting the One Piece/Naruto or even HnK treatment? It's one of the top 25 selling manga ever, the 2011 show was pretty damn popular, and it's built for the anime game treatment more than most anime that actually get it.<br><br>What kind of game do you want?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's built for the anime game treatment more than most anime that actually get it <br>Hardly, i really don't see some hatsus and how nen works in fight being incorporated (Ryu, Ko, In and the likes) into a fighting game.<br> I'd love a Greed Island RPG though </br></br></br>  <br> doens't know about HxH <br><br>HxH has a lot of games released for it, granted most of them were released for the manga or for the '99 anime, there are strategy games, adventure games and role playing games. Hell there was even a Harvest Moon-esque simulator.</br></br></br>  <br> in the modern era <br>Read.</br></br>  <br>If you mean a game for the 2011 anime, then it not having a video game actually tells you a lot about it's actual popularity.</br>  <br><br>How Uvogin killed those Shadow Beasts so easily, I mean, Jesus, he basically ate his skull.</br></br>  <br>Uvo was so fucking based, it's unfortunate he was the first to go.</br>  I just finished the 2011 anime after watching the '99 anime up until the end of Yorkshin a couple years ago and I feel pretty satisfied. I understand that what most people fault the 2011 version for is the lack of Kite, but is there anything else as big as that?<br><br>I plan on reading the manga from start to finish sometime in the future when (or if) there's enough new chapters to justify it, but having seen both anime I feel like I have a fairly complete experience. Of course, I will move the manga up my list of priorities if I'm wrong.</br></br>  <br>There are differences in characterization between both anime and manga. It's always better to start over from the very start.<br><br>Cause you'll be waiting a while for Togashi to get off his hiatus.</br></br></br>   HxH still on hiatus <br> Berserk is back <br> even fucking D Gray Man is back <br>There is no end to this suffering</br></br></br>  <br><br>They probably didn't include Kite at the beginning because they weren't sure they were going to animate the whole thing when it was announced in case the series got shit tv ratings on Sunday morning<br><br>If anons forget or didn't watch it as it was airing, let me remind you when the anime was announced it was commonly listed as 48+ episodes which would've placed the "end" right after Kurapika vs Uvogin</br></br></br></br>  <br>D.Gray-man, and Berserk were on a much longer hiatus than HxH.</br>  <br>Still makes no sense to include that but to still include their own bullshit, instead.</br>  <br>I want to be happy about Berserk but I'm just jealous as fuck</br>  <br><br> include their own bullshit  <br><br>What the fuck are you talking about? Besides Kite, the story is pretty much the same as the manga except some streamlining of the excessive non relevant details Togashi loved to randomly add</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right about D.Gray man, but i'm pretty sure the latest Berserk hiatus started after the HxH one</br>  <br>It's your own fault for liking the works of artists who have all since lost their work ethic. Togashi is the worst of them too because he sometimes just does scribble chapters when he actually isn't on hiatus.<br><br>All that aside, G.Ray-Man is just a mess, so it's best to pretend that it died long ago. Because it did.</br></br></br>  <br>episode 2 they added in their own character and even gave him his own character arc. They changed the scenes around so that Mito could essentially play the role of Kite. In reality they could have cut down on the chapter 2 material but they didn't.<br><br>All of those random things helped us to better understand the world of HxH and the characters. Because of the consistency of which the 2011 anime changes the things they adapt I think that it was more because someone on the staff interpreted the series differently rather the series being streamlined.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Episode 2? With the Kiriko? <br>Seems like you're making a mountain out of a mole hill since that character has nary impact on the big picture of HxH for Gon or the audience</br></br></br>  <br>Look at it this way, which ultimately caused more problems for the 2011 adaptation, including their pointless shit or not adapting chapter 1?<br><br>Considering that we have animefags who are genuinely confused about why Gon cares so much Kite and those who think that this is an accurate representation of Gon in the early part of the series. I wouldn't say that my complaint is something small at all.</br></br></br>  <br>He found the guy that was shot by what's his name's poison arrow a couple days later in the exam arc and carried him over near a pond.</br>  <br> They probably didn't include Kite at the beginning because they weren't sure they were going to animate the whole thing <br>The 99 staff still did it, even if Kite didn't become relevant at the time the anime was made<br>And even then, they changed his relationship with Gon when he was "introduced"</br></br></br>  <br>That's supposed to be him spitting it out in the bottom left panel, right? Am I forgetting wrong, or did they not have that in the anime? I remember being actually disturbed that he had no problem actually eating someone like that.</br>  <br>the porn</br>  <br>Surely you're not talking about shota porn</br>  Why?  <br>Because they both had their childish views shattered by reality</br>  <br>No, Togashi said if he wanted to kill his story he would. Just doesn't give enough of a fuck to work on it regularly.</br>  Okay, I'll say what I think.<br><br>Lawful good : Mizaistom<br>Lawful neutral : Netero<br>Lawful evil : Pariston<br>Neutral good : Gon<br>True Neutral : Zeno<br>Neutral Evil : Illumi<br>Chaotic good : Kurapika<br>Chaotic neutral : Gin<br>Chaotic Evil : Hisoka</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>"You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want."</br></br>  I dropped hxh before the dark continent arc, I just hate togashi's long dialogs, they make me sleepy and the info in them is usually garbage, better wait for the anime  <br><br>I just wanted to see Gon wreck Pitou's shit the whole time, it took forever to get there. I really do like the Chimera Ant arc though. It had some solid character development and a lot of sub plots that I ended up really liking. And the end was awesome. Not what I expected at all</br></br>  <br>Me too but I think the wait made it all the more enjoyable when it happened. Everything is better with build up, if things happen too fast they lose impact.</br>  Also, Gon looked gay as fuck when he went apeshit on Pitou.  <br><br>Yeah I agree. At the time that's all I wanted, after it happened I knew it was worth the wait.</br></br>  <br>I think anyone would look gay as fuck if they're wearing a twelve year old's clothes when they turn into a buff adult.</br>  <br><br>Meant to reply to this </br></br>  <br> Gon looked gay as fuck <br>It was funny and symbolic, i like Gon-san a lot. His design is the most amusing thing in the series.<br> went apeshit <br>I don't know, he seemed pretty stoic while doing it. He knew it wasn't heroic and he also knew it was fucked up while somewhat maintaining his composure.</br></br></br></br>  I wish Gon had died and Killua became the MC.  <br><br>Except there is so little good HxH porn, shota or no. There needs to be much more.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not saying I didn't like it, I definitely found it a little humorous. I think he went apeshit when he first transformed. It was just pure rage and hate that made him that way.</br></br>  After spending these last couple weeks watching every episode of the 2011 anime, I still don't get why they kept the OP the same for the entire thing. I rarely skip them even when watching many episodes in a row, but I couldn't manage it after the first arc was over, especially considering the shifts in tone that it doesn't match.<br><br>On the other had, I didn't think much of Hyouri Ittai at first, but ended up loving it.</br></br>  Was there a reason why Gon never interacted with the King?  <br>I think it was a bit more complicated than rage and hate. He really didn't know what to feel, and was experiencing conflicting emotions. Ultimately he came up with the decision that both him and Pitou were at fault for what happened to Kite.<br>The words he said to Pitou before his last blow didn't really seem hateful or angry. I really can't tell what he was feeling.</br></br>  <br>God, I love this page. It really feels like his hand is sticking out of the page and pointing right at you.</br>  <br> I didn't think much of Hyouri Ittai at first, but ended up loving it <br><br>Same here. Especially the second version used in the Chairman Election arc. This shot with them in the suits was cool.</br></br></br>  <br> being a dirty Killuafag <br>Ging became the MC anyway.</br></br>  <br>Killua wouldn't have taken the hunter test if he wasnt born in an assassin family</br>  <br>Really? I've only seen the anime so I didn't know. That sounds like the next best thing though.  Not that they'll finish the anime while I'm alive. </br>  <br>The people who like it are delusional, and the people who dislike it rightly see it as so absurd within the HxH universe that they can't immerse themselves. <br><br>As soon as you see the human-sized ant, just quit reading.</br></br></br>  Why is there so little  straight  porn of HxH?  <br> so absurd within the HxH universe <br>How so? Creatures like the ants have been around since the first arc</br></br>  So does this show get any better? I dropped it after the Ant arc because Gon turning into the strongest being on the planet despite being 10 years old was fucking retarded.  <br> strongest being on the planet <br>That always was Meruem<br> 10 years old <br>He's 12<br> fucking retarded <br>How exactly?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That always was Muruem <br>Neferpitou clearly stated that he was potentially stronger than the King and he had to try and stop him from getting close to him at all costs<br> He's 12 <br>Not a big difference<br> How exactly <br>Oh i dunno how about because a little kid who only had powers for about a year suddenly turned into a 30 year old man with enough power to kill people who literally dedicated their whole lives to training and perfection in an instant and without any explanation whatsoever? It is literally the equivalent of 12 year old Sakura from Naruto getting angry and killing a Hokage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, but Machi is the best girl.</br>  <br> and without any explanation whatsoever <br>You must be a special kind of retard to not understand something in a battle shonen of all things.</br></br>  <br> It is literally the equivalent of 12 year old Sakura from Naruto getting angry and killing a Hokage. <br>Why is it that retards always go straight to the Naruto comparison?</br></br>  <br>The trips have spoken.<br>I second this, Machi best girl.</br></br>  <br><br> He doesn't like the idea of a little kid being the strongest shit thats ever breathed for no reason! <br> Hahaha what a retard <br>Fucking autists...</br></br></br></br>  <br> Neferpitou clearly stated that he was potentially stronger than the King <br>This never happened. Only that he was as strong as the King, which could be Pitou overreacting like Knov explained. Also, post-nuke Meruem definitely was stronger.<br> without any explanation whatsoever? <br>What? It was all explained in that episode. Gon made a contract, he sacrificed his nen, potential, future and life just to reach his full hypothetic potential for a few minutes. He would have died without Killua and has no powers as a result.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The reason was literally explained in the same scene. Fuck off back to whatever underage forum you crawled out of.</br>  <br>Purple or pink hair? <br> Pink is the correct answer. </br></br>  <br>Both are great.</br>    <br>Surely you mean Bisky</br>  I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HXH SINCE '02<br><br>MAKE THE PAIN STOP PLEASE, I WANT THIS SERIES TO END BEFORE I DIE</br></br>  <br>http://hiatus-hiatus.rhcloud.com/<br>Reminder that we could be at chapter 700</br></br>  <br>I found it pretty funny when I first saw it but once I got past the fact that he was wearing short shorts and a crop top it was just scary and tragic. <br><br>He went apeshit but I think it had building up in him over a long period of time, so it was less of an explosion and more him consciously choosing to punish himself and end Pitou, and by the end he was just sad at what he had done.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, lower quality chapters though</br>  <br>Do you want to send women to the asylum if they act like a huge bitch on their period?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oo0<wbr>d1zTAFKA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Current hiatus: 44 issues <br> Longest hiatus: 79 issues <br> Longest publication streak: 30 issues <br><br>He couldn't go 30 fucking chapters without taking a break?<br><br>At least according to that maybe he'll release a chapter in 10 or so months.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait I dont remember this, what chapter is this from?</br>  <br>it's the one where he tests his yoyos and hatsu on Gensuru's ally</br>  <br>Well so far we've had at least 2 chapters a year. We can only hope this isn't the year we reach 100% hiatus.<br><br>178.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he was a hypocrite, his patience just reached a breaking point and he decided to be selfish. Imagine if you were a money loaner and you came to collect a debt and the guy told you he won't be able to feed his family if he paid. Maybe you'll do the right thing and give them a break but what if this happened again and again and again? When it happens enough times you're just going to say fuck it it's not my duty to sacrifice myself for the greater good.</br>  <br>That's because nen and ki is almost copypasted from real life concepts of chakra, kundalini, qi, and other such equivalent eastern philosophies in the neighborhood of Hinduism and Buddhism. Characters literally practice yoga/meditation on screen as a nen exercise.<br>Keep in mind I'm not criticizing it, I like the occult and mythologies in my anime, you won't see me complaining about demons in SMT.</br></br>  <br>For me , this scene is probably the best in all shounen.</br>  <br>hes a fucking autist that can draw but draws like shit<br>lazy fuck</br></br>  <br>IIRC Berserk had a 7 month long one while we're about a month away from it being a year.</br>  <br>shut up already you whiny autist</br>  <br>His arms look so weird here.</br>  <br> Bisky <br> Girl </br></br>  <br>Best woman.</br>  <br>y-youcan smile ; ;</br>  <br><br><br>Best girl is Senritsu you mongoloids.</br></br></br>  It's time<br><br>Top 10 girls/women:</br></br>  <br>1/machi<br>2/machi<br>3/machi<br>4/machi<br>5/machi<br>6/machi<br>7/machi<br>8/machi<br>9/machi<br>10/Kurapika</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All that's important is<br> 1. Senritsu <br> 2. Pakunoda <br> worst: Mito </br></br></br></br>  <br>That whole episode was great</br>  <br> Pakunoda <br>Moe~</br></br>  <br>kite, senritsu, mito, paku, bisky, machi, cheadle, alluka, canary, spina<br><br>something like that</br></br></br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/znuvpufmuy.web<wbr>m<br>That scene was awesome.</br></wbr></br>  <br> that "DORAGON DAIVU" <br>literal jizz</br></br>  <br>Purple of course</br>  THREADLY REMINDER that Togashi is a genius and already has the whole Dark Continent arc planned out.  Oh damn, Feitan's 2011 voice is a huge improvement over his 1999 voice.  <br>He's so moe.</br>  <br>But will we ever see the Dark Continent arc?</br>  <br>He's definitely more of a chink in the '99 version.</br>  <br>Who's death he used in the hunter exam?</br>  <br>I hope so. Really looking forward to pic related too</br>  Why do half of the young boys in this show look like girls?<br><br>Is Togashi a pedo?</br></br>  <br>Kalluto is the only boy that looks like a girl.</br>  <br>Pito too</br>  <br>Please don't start this. Pitou isn't a boy or a girl, so it doesn't matter.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  How can people claim Gon is inherently good? He never is disturbed by all the deaths happening around him (no empathy). He never chastises Killua for killing people and actually accepts him easily. He is simply a child with childish morals and may seem good (friendly with people) but can't comprehend the difficulties with morality and death in general.  <br>All of the Zoldyks look like girls at one point or another. I'm sure even Silva and Zeno at one point were full trap mode.</br>  <br>Moralfag plz.</br>  <br> What is Alluka <br> What is Kurapika </br></br>    <br>I don't care, I like Gon. But he is not good, nothing like Goku or especially Gohan.</br>  <br>Girl<br>A man with a pretty face. He's not a young boy.</br></br>  <br> Alluka <br>A girl.<br> Kurapika <br>Have you never watched any kind of anime before? He's clearly a man.<br><br>Killua doesn't look like a girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Alluka <br> Girl <br><br>Pick exactly 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The story makes it clear from day one to not be a moral fag, and yet here you are being a moral fag.</br>  <br> Killua doesn't look like a girl. <br>Does Pitou look like a girl? Does Komugi look like a girl, because Killua looks like them.</br></br>    <br>Stop</br>  <br>Girls like Pitou and komugi have pronounced eyelashes unlike togashi's boys, the only exception being kalluto whose specific gimmick is looking like a girl.</br>  I'd love to hear what speculations people have on what the Dark Continent arc will have in store for the characters. Will we see more suffering? How will Gon regain his nen, and will he be a different nen type post Gon-san?<br><br>What nen abilities beyond Jan Ken Pon would suit him?</br></br>  <br>Not disagreeing, but all of the Zoldyck children (barring Alluka for the most part) have noticeable eyelashes. It seems to be a family trait that just happens to play into Kalluto's 'thing'.  Unless if you're talking about pronounced strands. </br>  <br>Pic related<br><br>We will get: Netero's past, Don Freecss, shit more dangerous than the Chimera Ants, and Pariston vs Ging</br></br></br>  <br>I am talking about strands, a lot of togashi's hxh girls have longer detailed lashes unlike that "eyeliner"-esque design that the zoldycks and some other males have.</br>  I think... I remember one time when there were more HxH chapters out than Naruto ones.<br><br>How long ago was that? I feel old.</br></br>  <br>What happened? I posted one image, anon.</br>  <br>It's because Killufags usually keep posting the same images over and over again, and the one you posted was one of them. Well people called them out on their shit posting they usually come up with some excuse like "We're off topic anyway" or "We only shitpost when there isn't a discussion"but then continue to shit post even when people are in the middle of discussion.<br><br>Anon is just pointing out how hypocritical Killuafags are.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Togashi should release some new chapters so we can have something to actually discuss.</br>  <br>Or maybe Killuafags should post on /cm/ instead of spamming /a/.<br><br>Besides I'm happy for the hiatus, it's doing its work in culling the more cancerous additions to the HxHfags, and it's forcing the newfags to actually read the manga instead of relying on the anime, and because of them 2011 adaptation ended. It's a win win situation.</br></br></br>  <br>Will Madhouse continue the series if more chapters are released consistently?</br>  <br>This shouldn't happen unless Furuhashi takes the role of the director instead and does an adaptation starting from Greed Island.</br>  <br>There aren't enough chapters and they've caught up, plus knowing Togashi he'll just go on hiatus again. By the time that DC arc is completed people will have forgotten about the 2011 adaptation, making a continuation pointless.</br>  <br>I didn't particularly like Pitou but some small little filler interactions with Komugi would have been nice.<br><br>It'd be interesting to see what kind of filler scenes he'd make for the Ant arc actually. Can't get any worse than the Kite filler, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Not true.<br><br>Ippo does a season every 5-7 years and it hasn't grown pointless/lost its fanbase.</br></br></br>   t-there's no creepy suggestions of pedo <br> Togashi is just telling a great story, get your mind out of the gutter! </br>  <br>But the Ippo anime is also ridiculously popular in its own right. In the case of the 2011 adaptation its really the manga that was popular and the anime that was riding on its coat tails.</br>  <br> no filler of pitou tickling komugi's feet with their tail </br>  <br> this entire post </br>  <br>Ignoring NETFLIX, I don't think they were going to molest Zushi or anything. That's something Killua would have picked up on quickly if that were the case.</br>  Reminder:<br>- It doesn't matter which gender Pitou and Alluka are.<br>- Killua and Gon are simply close friends.<br>- Only a pedo would think the series is filled with pedophilia.<br>- Forever a hiatus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In all fairness, the first 2-3 arcs have a lot of really uncomfortable suggestions of boy love that are at least as prominent as homosexual undertones are in JoJo.</br>  <br> Killua and Gon are simply close friends <br>Just like Itsuki and Sensui.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Killua will finally express himself to Gon when he's dead, by embracing his corpse</br>  <br>Implying that CA arc wasn't the Itsuki/Sensui scenario.</br>  <br> hetshit </br>  <br>I meant Gon and Killua's character arcs. Killua probably could have stopped Gon if he told him that Kite was dead, instead of allowing him to continue with his delusions.</br>  <br>Oh. My bad.</br>  <br> But gon certainly isn't. He has a conscience and a set of morals. Albeit an odd one. <br><br>There is nothing particularly odd about Gon's morals. At the core he has the typical moral compass of a child. Above all other considerations, whatever helps him and his close friends is good. Whatever hurts him and his close friends is bad. Gon forms bonds easily, as befits a shonen protag, but people he had no chance to get acquainted with effectively don't exist for him. He can feel, for example, that Kurapika loathes killing from the bottom of his heart, so he tries to ensure that the conflict with the Spiders is resolved without further bloodshed, the fact that the Spiders would murder fucktons more people in the future is irrelevant to him.</br></br></br>  <br> liking a fake loli </br>  <br>That's becasue Gon is actually an asshole. And fake loli sucks!</br>  <br>Look at this asshole</br>  <br>That guy Hisoka killed</br>  <br>heh, I will never not find it funny that even an autist like Ging had the sense to comfort Gon.</br>  <br>Does that make Killua even more autistic than Ging?</br>  <br><br>It's a old-as-time trope for hero to be "above" societal norms- ubermensch. What's refreshing is that Togashi has a much more cynical view on society</br></br>  <br>girl</br>  <br>The best part is that killua's not even autistic</br>  <br>One thing I like about Gon is that he's never heroic. He's never trying to save the world, his adventures are all about his own personal goals and that of his friends so most of his achievements are on a small scale. Even the palace invasion, which did save a lot of people, was all about himself and Kite and instead of his victory over Pitou being portrayed as heroic, it's just tragic.</br>  <br> Ging literally becoming spaghetti <br>I'm surprised he didn't make a super cringe joke</br></br>  I love how human Ging feels already.  <br>What a qt</br>  <br>I wonder if you could use this as a weapon...<br>Like someone tries to rob you and you just<br> "Protect me Gon-san!!" </br></br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>cuntism =/= autism</br>  <br>I really like Gon like I like Yoh<br>Both kind, perceptive, and carefree nature<br>And both have phases of angts</br></br></br>  <br>All of G,I, the way everyone uses information is amazing</br>  <br>there's a decent amount, it's just overshadowed by all the gay</br>  <br> worst: Mito </br>  Why do you guys keep making these threads. They just remind me that HxH on hiatus. Its easier to cope with it when you are not reminded by them constantly.  I miss Ryodan,i hope we'll see them soon .  Fuck you guys nobody told me this series would get spooky.  <br>Are you guys ready for Brion?</br>  <br>Yes, because who fucking lies to a kid about their dad leaving them? <br>She's utter shit, even if Gon eventually learned the truth.</br></br>  <br><br>Truthfully?<br>Hunter Exam.<br><br>The appeal of HxH has with me is it's a extremely straight forward story, but in how straight forward it is, it's very well told.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goddamn. I forget how good this was getting. Togashi please come back</br>  <br>I loved that the main character and the big bad only exchanged glances and that was that. I think it happened that way because them meeting absolutely wasn't necessary. Togashi doesn't force the main character must do everything trope onto HxH which is great. <br><br><br>I was very pissed when they did that. It should have changed at the York Shin Arc to fit the tone shit but I just learned to accept that it wasn't changing.</br></br></br></br>  Is there anyone who can beat the legendary Super Shalnark?  <br>Her intention was to convince Gon that Hunters are shitty people who don't even care about their family so he wouldn't try to become one. I don't see anything wrong with this since he were to risk his life during the exam and trying to keep the child you raised from danger is natural.</br>  <br>Excellent job she did with that.</br>  <br>Blame Kite, not Mito</br>  <br>As if anyone could stop Gon from doing things his way. At least she tried, unlike Killua.</br>  <br>I don't think Meruem ever looked at Gon.</br>  FFFFUUUUUUUUUCKKKJK i want weekkly hxh <br><br>;_; pls togashi<br><br>FUCK</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right. He probably knew Gon was there though.</br>  <br> DRAGON..DIVE! <br><br>That part always give me shivers, it's so damn profound and powerful, easily one of the best episodes in the series for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Those two episodes which, all together, cover about 5 seconds of real time action, are my favourite.<br><br>They do so well to keep it so intense and so interesting despite playing real time at 1/1000th speed.</br></br></br>  You guys should definitely play the first 3 Arc the Lad games for PS1, Togashi totally based HxH on it.<br><br> Modern urban fantasy <br> Hunters Guild for jobs <br> Mafia and corrupt Governments are the ones to set the rules <br> Grey morality  <br> The MC looks like a younger Ging <br> Blimps heavily used as means of transportation <br><br>They are from the golden age of JRPGs (mid/late 90's), and so, they might not be as polished and easy as the ones we have today, but damn, give it a try if you can, it's really good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Which is better 1999 or 2011 anime?  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>Manga&gt;1999&gt;2011</br>  <br>Watch both</br>  <br>Is he a fuccboi like Ging?</br>  <br>Thanks anon, that sounds pretty good.</br>  <br> have two above average adaptations when most adaptation for shonen manga are garbage <br> argue about which one is better <br>Top autism.</br></br></br>  <br>I think that anon was asking which one to watch</br>  <br>I'd think watching the 2011 adaption first would be better, if you're really set on watching both. save the desserts for last.</br>  would you give kurapika a footrub?  <br> man feet <br>no thanks</br></br>  <br><br>well everything else about him is girly.</br></br>  <br>If it weren't for Kite then Gon would be under the impression that his father didn't care about him whatsoever, when that's obviously not the case.</br>  <br><br> I knew it all along <br><br>It's extremely common in this genre for those type of traits to be exalted, and unquestioned, by the story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would give Kurapika a backrub and cuddles.</br>  why did kite make a weapon that could possibly fuck him over? what an idiot  <br>Definitely gay for Kurapika.</br>  <br>Wasn't it Ging that gave him the idea for his ability?</br>  <br><br> man </br></br>    <br>In a platonic way, of course.</br>  <br>Is he going to have little flutes with Senritsu?</br>  <br>edgy</br>  <br> sitting on a stool is now edgy </br>  <br><br>It's the only way to conjure multiple weapons. part of his nen contract is that he can't choose.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  Anyone thinking that Togashi hasn't been writing because he's stuck and doesn't know where to go from here? He seems to make it up has he goes a long.  <br>Pretty sure he just hurt his balls by spreading his legs that far apart.</br>  <br>How is he stuck? He's obviously pretty inspired for the DC arc.</br>  <br>Look at this edgelord</br>  <br>More restriction, more power. I liked the idea, you just have to adapt to the hand you're dealt.</br>  <br>If it wasn't for Kite then Gon would have believed that Ging was dead. Ging even admits to abandoning Gon.</br>  <br> implying there are any bad rolls </br>  <br>I thought he said himself that 2 and 4 were bad rolls</br>  <br>Reread the beginning, you're right about the first part. Gon finds out he isn't dead so Mito tells another lie, and then reveals later that Ging didn't abandon Gon. Mito still a selfish shit.<br>Ging does care about Gon, though. I'm not sure why you'd think otherwise. Taking away custody from a child means that Mito could press charges against Ging for coming in contact with Gon, and I'm not sure what the context of "Ging even admits to abandoning Gon" is, but what it sounds like is that it was meant in a "I could have fought it if I wanted to, but I didn't" sort of way.</br></br>  <br>No, Ging abandoned Gon. There was nothing stopping Ging from seeing Gon at any point he wanted and he said himself that he'd abandoned him in his tape.</br>  <br>Ging has also admitted to being extremely shy. Once you know that, it's pretty apparent that what he said in the tape was to dissuade Gon from pursuing him. He even went as far as to redirect Gon to Kite if Gon tried to bring a friend along.<br>If you stick by that Ging abandoned him, then you're also saying that Mito was lying once again in the previous picture.<br>Ging's some kind of mega-autist who's shy of even his own son; it makes sense for him not to want to see him.</br></br></br>  Why is Kumiko so lewd?  <br>What? he's nothing but a club advisor?</br>  Kitauji in 10 years. Kumiko invites Reina, Midori, Asuka, Mizore and Nozomi to coach the band  <br>I'll have the buchou.</br>  <br>I'll fight you for her hand in marriage</br>  <br>I'm not really that much into Natsuki, but her breasts are damn fine on that picture. Lower medium size, and perfectly round.<br><br>I'd still pick Midori over everyone else, I want to run my hand down from her armpits ot her wide hips.</br></br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1536<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1529:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1535 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting a blushing and surprised Sawyer wrapped in a towel, similar to one of these:<br><br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1828302<br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=940166<br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2761171</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Stepping on anon and demeaning him.

Them and Eva were all made by Gainax so it makes sense.</br>  Requesting Adlet, anythings fine, preferably something "action-y"  Requesting Guren being caught trying on Shinoa's uniform.  <br>Tumblr is filled with doodles so lemme just link something im currently working on (just needs some adjustments and shades)<br><br> http://i.imgur.com/ubXGGZJ.png </br></br></br>  So you wake up, and go take a shower. You put the water temperature just right and jump in. <br>Now you reach for the shampoo bottle and start squeezing it, but then <br> no shampoo comes out <br>How would your favorite character (or waifu if you want, I don't discriminate) react when this happens</br></br></br>  <br>Is that your best in terms of feet? If you're capable of better, I'd possibly be interested.</br>  <br>This sounds like a neo-waifu thread question.</br>  <br>She'd start screaming and banging her head against the wall until she collapsed</br>  <br>as I said, it's not over yet, so yeah I think I am "capable of better" I'm really okay with spending more time on them if it means that you'll appreciate the final product better. posted my skype here if you're interested </br>   <br>Delivery.<br>Sorry I took so long. I got busy and couldn't draw as much as I wanted.</br></br>  <br>Naisu</br>  <br>Really well done.</br>  <br>OR here, amazing.</br>  Requesting Issei from High School DxD with his full Balance Breaker ( Ddraig and Albion arms) doing Hell And Heaven move from GaoGaiGar<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EnV<wbr>lcBXpTtc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Requesting Teto with her top opened in a cumshot picture on her face + chest or into her womb, smiling and double peace no ahegao.  I'd like color of this Ayame delivery , IIRC she was wearing the catgirl outfit from Prism Ilya. There's a reference of her   WIP for armored Kotetsu <br>Any comments or concerns would be welcome.</br>  Requesting this fusion chart, thanks in advance.<br>Of Futayo Honda, Angela, and Jun the Swan</br>  I'd like to see these two done<br>http://i.imgur.com/okXtfqC.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/Zdixm0Y.jpg<br>sorry if they're rough and all, even clean lines would be nice.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks great. That's some funny shit. Thanks for drawing this.</br>  <br>Who's the drawfag</br>  Began sketching Rena's sprite, I'll continue it later.  <br>That's some nice linework. <br>I still think the fold on the skirt in the crotch are too extreme though. Especially as it looks like you have wind blowing from the other direction.</br></br>  <br>Squatz n' oats, smurf, m'boy! She's achieved trex mode.</br>  <br>Digging the thickness.</br>  <br>I'll rework on the skirt for the lineart anyway, not satisfied of some stuffs already when looking at it, but won't have the occasion to continue working on it 'till tuesday anyway. Even with the wide hips and thighs intended, the legs could be a bit thinner for example.</br>  <br>Glad you like it.<br><br>I don't use a name.</br></br></br>  <br>Well the thick thighs are a matter of preference but the skirt is just not acting like a skirt. <br>I get that you did volume work under there that you want to show off but sometimes you just have to hide all of it.</br></br>  <br>Will you do Rika and Satoko?</br>  <br>I look forward to this.</br>  <br> I don't use a name <br>You. I like you.</br></br>  <br>oh I see do you have an art blog?</br>  <br>Neither, I don't like my stuff enough to post it.</br>  <br>No, that's not planned for now. after cleaning and coloring this one I intended to do at least one pose variation (same position as the original), and I wanted to make the casual clothes versions as well for Rena and Mion.<br><br>And besides her "official" sprite expressions, I always felt like she was lacking some others, mainly when being serious, I think I'll try that too.<br><br>And after that, the next character I want to draw is  Takano </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like you as much</br>  <br>I'm sorry. I'll get better and more confident.</br>  <br>Deliverin', it's finally done!<br>Thanks to all the anons who helped me along the way.<br>I'm never underestimating backgrounds again<br>I actually finished this morning, but the thread was auto-saging and I passed out before the new thread was made.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good job, drawfag</br>  <br>This is really good.</br>  <br>Nice job, I enjoyed watching that progress.</br>  <br>Aside from what another anon said about the skirt fabric, those hands are way too small in relation to her head (or maybe it's just that her head is a bit too big for her body). There's also something off about her head's placement in relation to her neck. They don't look connected.</br>  <br>Great job drawamigo, that looks wonderful! And seeing the progress sure was interesting, great great.<br>Thank you a lot! Way more than I expected</br></br>  <br>Is she a mini-GTS or is that just a really small torpedo?</br>  <br>Is there any specific height difference between these two?</br>  coloring delivery! only for 1 out of 2 pics though  going to go sleep now<br>i can't link back drawthread 1534 for some reason, it's deleted, i guess. ayamefag didn't post request for the last 2 threads too</br>  <br>Neither character's height is discussed in canon, but I believe Reco is about 5 inches taller than Reimu.</br>  <br>Thanks, I'm still sketching so this might take a while.</br>  I wish Smurf would quit posting his WIP that aren't related to general drawthread's requests. Didn't you try to fish for responses in /ic/ already?  <br>I don't see a problem, drawfags should be about the art, not bending to requester's whims.</br>  <br>But we have a board for that.</br>  Posting the collage pastebin list on request from the WWD thread.<br><br>http://pastebin.com/YrDDnzK2<br><br>Subject to change.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this?</br>  <br>heh, didn't even have to request her for her to be on her, I guess that's just how perfect my waifu is</br>  <br> sample <br> artifacts </br></br>  <br>Remove Oora</br>  <br> oora! <br>haha</br></br>  <br>I'm not entirely sure if I want to see her in there or not.</br>  <br>Do not remove Oora.</br>  <br><br>I'm not ycake so can't edit it, but I'm sure he's around the threads somewhere. Either that or he's working on requests for the WWD.</br></br>  <br><br> It can't be that bad, right </br></br>  <br>How was my waifu picked for this exactly?</br>  So, WWD is kill?  <br>No  ? </br>  <br>What, are you not down with Hulkamania?</br>  <br>If whoever made this could please remove kurome from that list, thanks.</br>  <br><br>Tried to access from phone but the catalog doesn't show the drawthread though</br></br>  <br>What are the contents for this collage?</br>  <br>Because some retarded faggot put the title in the name field.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>That's because the idiot who made it didn't put anything in the subject field, search for weekend</br>  <br><br>Ah, thanks a lot!</br></br>  <br>Nice, but I think you missed her tongue</br>  <br>So what's the practical difference between these threads and the WWD threads?</br>  <br>  There isn't really. </br>  <br>WWD has more WWE superstars.</br>  <br>WWD has become somewhat of a spectacle as desperate anons beg for deliveries and start flinging dung at everything that can hold a pencil in its hand</br>  <br> soak-a-slut <br><br> everything is complete </br></br></br>  <br>I'm mostly finished with the sketch now, <br>Is there anything I should change? <br>I'd appreciate it if someone could point out any mistakes, I'm pretty bad at noticing things like that.<br><br><br>From a drawfag perspective, WWD has more general requests, this one often has very specific ones.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WOW! thank you so much!<br>this looks great so far!<br>Can you have reimu looking up at Reco instead of looking into her shoulder like you have it?<br>Thanks!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not anymore it doesn't, janitors just cleaned fucking house.</br>  <br>Sure, I'm glad you like it so far</br>  <br>so, is a over the whole holding hands thing or are people still upset about that stuff?</br>  <br>It's an old meme anon. Holding hands is the most lewd thing imaginable.<br><br>Better handholding that watching a waifu get dicked by some other bloke.</br></br></br>  <br>Which Akari is that? ARIA?<br>If so remove her please.</br></br>  Requesting Frenda as a magical girl fending off a tentacle monster, but losing badly.<br> Or losing on purpose. </br>  Any hardcore or brutal fucking requests?

OP didn't put waifu or WWD anywhere in the entry post.</br>  <br>Remove Rias Gremory from this, please. I do not want her included because some sack of shit wants to double dip between here and the WWD with his requests, even more so because this is a stupid fetish in the first place.<br><br>Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess 4chanx searches the name field as well as the rest of the OP.</br>  <br>I didn't request in the WWD, friend. If you'd read the whole post, specifically didn't request in the WWD, I was wishing others well in their own request hunts.<br><br>Moreover, didn't we already have a whole convo about this two threads back? Even the non-dunkfags thought you were being an aspie about it trying to shoot down anyone but you requesting Rias pics for anything, dunk or not.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay good, will probably finish the linework+hatching before the threads done.</br>  <br>I haven't stepped foot into the these threads specifically and solely since I wanted to avoid you because you completely disgust me. Believe it or not, more than one person in the entire world does not like you.<br><br>Do me the personal favor and stay in here. You can request whatever stupid fetishized garbage in here and apparently nobody gives a shit, you'll even get into a collage. Thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>I love you too anon. Your single-minded devotion to filling my womb with your surging hatred makes me doki doki.</br>  <br>You want a mind-broken pregnancy edit or a holy-shit-my-brain-just-broke-from-<wbr>cumming-too-many-times face edit with a close-up impregnation window?</wbr></br>  <br>the second one</br>  <br>Oi fuck off</br>  <br> Marika not on the list </br>  <br>Marika getting pounded in the ass while being pressed against a glass window.</br>   (Cross-thread)<br/>  <br><br>If only those two could be combined...but the world is not ready.</br></br>  <br>OR here, thanks a bunch!</br>  <br>Without any other context, I might have enjoyed seeing Kaede in a dunk tank scenario (certainly not one labeled "soak-a-slut", of course). However, I don't feel comfortable knowing that people proposing the hypothetical collage and its target audience are a group that fetishizes this kind of thing. Please remove her from the list.</br>  <br>It's not fetishistic, just a strange kind of love</br>  <br> it's not fetishistic <br>Who the hell are you kidding?

Is there a method to getting motivated to draw? Its super fun learning different things and seeing slight improvements from nothing but the actual act of drawing leaves me horribly empty.  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1436383382250.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1436383382250<wbr>.webm</wbr></a><br> Draw what really happens, what they couldn't air.  Rape. </br>  <br><br>Everybody finds their own ways for motivation, you just have to find yours.</br></br>  <br>I know that feeling, personally, I like to look through my old art notebooks and seeing my progress. It's kind of the feeling of: "I'm going to get better if I just keep going, so I'll just keep drawing until I finish this art notebook too."</br>  <br><br>My life is so shitty that the only refuge I can afford is drawing and masturbating to 2D girls.</br></br>  <br>You could try to pump yourself up, or set a reward for a goal.</br>  Requesting Paladin holding Fighter down and lustfully tonguing her navel, saliva dripping from her mouth and a sense of sexual pleasure on her face as Fighter squirms at her appendage probing her umbilicus.

I just guessed speculars because they are very faint now and look glassy.<br><br>I see that the eyes are in shadow which is why you made them dark but I find that eyes are a place you can ignore regular shading rules and make them lighter than they should be, especially in a more stylized style like anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>omg</br>  <br>It's foul like Nergels rot. I love it.</br>    <br>I think it generally looks fantastic, but it could do with more attention to lighting.

Try looking at 3DPD images for references.</br>  <br>Hmm I was trying to get that pose right, from the looks of it I fucked up again huh. Nobody said anything in the stream so I just assumed it was okay. Oh well. thanks.</br>  <br>That this with a grain of salt because I am far from an expert but I think her neck isn't centered and her hips/butt are too big for the size of her shoulders. It looks like you were trying to have her leaning forward, away from the viewer, but I think you over did the proportions.<br><br>Don't be discouraged. You are one mistake closer to being amazing!</br></br></br>  <br><br>yep</br></br>  <br>Yeah the perspective does feel off, but its a good attempt draw friend, keep drawing and getting better. Maybe look at some other references to get ideas of where to better that region.</br>  <br>Don't despair! Just keep practicing using real people as references. <br>Don't worry so much about making a "complete" drawing that includes colors and everything.

Akira cucking Daisuke?<br>Sounds hilarious but im not going to do it.</br></br></br>  It's shit, right?  <br>it's pretty terrible</br>  Its good if you want to fall asleep  yes  Pretty mediocre overall. I'd give it an 8/10  nope, now that they toned up the yuri it might be interesting  <br>Mediocre is a 4 or 5 not an 8</br>  <br>He probably comes from MAL.</br>  yes, very   criticize clumsy exposition in a previous show <br> do clumsy exposition  <br><br>BRAVO MARUTO</br></br></br>  <br>Its taking its time setting itself up, which means the instant gratification autists will hate it.</br>  The thing that I don't understand is why the new guy is obligated to close the school if all of his past works were "Go to this shitty place and make it profitable"  <br>I don't understand /a/. It's not amazing, but it's not shit. Just seems average to me. I'll keep watching, though, since the premise seems interesting to me and I don't hate any of the characters yet.</br>  It's OK  <br><br>That's what they said about Glasslip.</br></br>  <br>On the other hand, no gratification autists will say it's still setting up, and it will get better soon even by episode 10.</br>  <br>I think he's not meant to close the school, just the A-Tec,\ division, which is basically a money drain. It just seems like his brothers give him shit jobs partially because they enjoy being assholes but also because he apparently seems to be good at doing them. So I guess he's just the company "fixer", getting rid of situations that no one else wants to deal with.</br>  <br>You missed the part where his brother would send him to shitty jobs so that he would look bad when he couldn't fix them.<br><br>Since he was able to fix them and make himself look good, his brother is trying a new approach. Using him as the scapegoat to get rid of A-TEC, which despite its popularity is a money pit.</br></br></br>  <br>Unlike Glasslip, the plot exists and is coherent.<br><br>Like others said this isn't good or bad. A run of the mill show that will probably be forgotten by next season.</br></br></br>  <br>the only thing that annoys me about this situation is that these fuckers insist on making it be a school, even though its so far removed from everything else about it just for the sake of muh genre. its like they feel the need to write in a cover story to get the actual story past the whimpering anime police. <br><br>please just tell a story about commercial space exploration and development. real life now...</br></br></br>   mfw watching this   <br>I highly doubt that.<br><br><br>Someone was triggered.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's certainly an interesting way to look at it. Either he shuts down the division and loses public face, or he joins up with the class (the least likely turn of events in his brother's mind, but the most likely in terms of how plots like these tend to go) and he looks like a sentimental money waster to the rest of the company.<br><br>I don't think the "use him to get rid of a popular division" thing was intended, though, seeing as how his older brother seemed visibly upset about missing the chance to keep that television piece from airing. But it'll probably work out that way in the end.</br></br></br>  <br>hi OP</br>  I had to force myself 3 times to watch the second episode...  but they have 'fast' space cars so who are we to judge  <br>Did you enter a persistent vegetative state when watching the first episode of Hyouka?<br><br><br>Maybe it's time for you to go reread Planetes again, anon. Not that the commercial space exploration anime wouldn't be nice, of course. I personally don't mind the setting that much because it feels much more like tech/trade school than a typical Japanese high school.</br></br></br></br>  The format is just inexcusably terriible<br><br>If they wanted to make a documentary anime they should take a look at actual good documentaries and try to copy them first instead of just taking a shit all over a screen for 20 minutes</br></br>  so what was the point of the miners making the deadline only a day long if they weren't actually crazy people?  <br>4-5 is bad. 6 is mediocre.</br>  <br>I don't think it's boring, I think it's shit so no, not me. <br><br>Can anyone comment on that one Twitter post made about this show saying that this isn't your run of the mill SoL, but a show that goes into a big betrayal theme among other things? Or do I have the wrong show? Because this shows no elements of that.</br></br></br>  <br>i love planetes, this seems like it could be a modern and rather different take.<br>I agree on the tech school aspect, im more commenting on the ridiculous "im joining your class but really im a new manager who is downsizing" thing.</br></br>  <br>They were hired to fuck with the MC, he mentioned he was having all sorts of 'issues' while en route to Mars.</br>  <br>4 is bad 5 is average or mediocre. 6 is above average. 7 is good 8 great 9 is outstanding or one of a kind 10 is masterpiece. Use logic.</br>  <br>you are trying far too hard</br>  ten/ten  <br> documentary anime <br>Where are you getting this? It sees like they just used the in-world documentary as an excuse for exposition. This isn't the first or last time you'll see this in a show.<br><br>What bugs me is that whoever subbed this apparently understood that Ganymede and Europa are moons, but didn't catch Callisto and said "Caristo" instead.<br><br><br> im more commenting on the ridiculous "im joining your class but really im a new manager who is downsizing" thing. <br>Yeah, I agree that's kind of dumb. There's no reason for him to join the class if he's just going to shut it down anyway. He could just stand at the sidelines and observe if he was going to audit the place. But like you said, it's for the sake of the school genre, I suppose<br><br><br> Because this shows no elements of that. <br>If we were going to get a big betrayal theme going, it wouldn't be in the second episode, anon. Part of what makes a betrayal sting is the it comes from someone you trust and it feels unexpected. We don't know much about any of the characters besides the teacher at this point, so I wouldn't expect to see a betrayal theme until later. If the show bores you, I can understand that, but I don't think "I don't see signs of betrayal" is a legitimate complaint at this point in time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   world where kids casually crash 15 billion dollar spaceships <br> still using fax <br>shiggydiggy</br></br>  <br>How do you send a fax in space, anyway? Wouldn't it just be a scanned email that was automatically printed? How do phones work when calling other planets? Sending some sort of long range electromagnetic waves? Wouldn't that be difficult to parse if so many of them were going at once?</br>  <br>I am really really liking it so far, first episode was pretty bad in my opinion cause it seemed to be about a special space-class that has adventures every week which I would consider to be generic and boring. Second episode had me intrigued however because it seems to be more about corporation politics than space adventures, I can't see how you could feel bored during this episode. Im expecting the class to launch a more agressive propaganda campaign and fight against the corporate leadership</br>    <br> If we were going to get a big betrayal theme going, it wouldn't be in the second episode <br>But is there going to be one?</br></br>  it's like I'm watching a reverse Amaburi  <br> In space <br>They have a company building in mars, the fax machine maybe just works in the planet and he has to print new cards if he has to go to another planet.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't know, man, I don't write the show. If it's boring you, you should drop it and just check a thread later in the season to figure out if anything interesting happened.</br></br>   show goes full yuri <br> suddenly gets all the hate <br><br>you're so predictable /a/ fuck you</br></br></br>  Pretty good so far to me, fuck that glasses guy though, he wanna shut down the class because it reminded him of his classmate's achievement? <br><br>Is this an original or there are ln/manga source?This better not be another LN/manga advertisement, fuck me if it is.</br></br>  <br>the ideal way with the least (but still significant) latency is to point a laser at a receiver and transmit in binary. you need better lasers to combat refraction at long distances.</br>   Character says sensei <br> Subs use Mr. Sera <br>Just fucking use "teacher" or something if you're not going with honorifics, holy shit.<br>Is FFF the worst sub group of all times?</br></br></br>  huh?  <br> Its taking its time setting itself up, which means the instant gratification autists will hate it. <br>nope. the ending has already been teligraphed. <br><br>not-lelouch provoked both his nii-sama and the idiot teacher. now he's in a win-win. He doesn't have to do anything for 6 months. basically this is how the plot works<br><br>1) the ATEC class pulls out a miracle and revolutionizes space travel, in which case it can't be elimintated and not-lelouche will impress the board of directors for turning around a department hemraging $$ and making them all filthy rich, likely securing his place as CEO, because he can rightly point to his nii-sama as wanting to close ATEC down.<br><br>2) ATEC, provoked tries to prove him wrong and screws up. in which case he's just manufactured the justification for closing ATEC down. This of course is 100% in line with the board's request of him, so his star rises further in the company with an unblemished trackrecord.<br><br>expect him to provoke people into hating him the rest of this story, so that they try to show him he's wrong about them, and in the end even if ATEC wins he'll win.<br><br>there is nothing deep or slow about this. it's a transparent setup with a bad cast of uninteresting characters. though i'm sure you feel really special for having watched all of Glasslip expecting something more then ~ nothing; while telling yourself that people who correctly saw the show as trash were "instant gratification autists"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but Kobayashi has a role so I'll be watching it anyway.</br>  <br>nope. nice try though<br><br>mal reviews are more like this<br><br>1-7 (nothing is ever rated a 1-7)<br>8- bad/mediocre<br>9-ok<br>10-ok to greatest of all time! (90% of all votes for anime is a 10 on MAL)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're a /pol/ack who defends capitalism (that is, nowaday's fascistic capitalism) you're gonna love it. If not, don't bother, watched the first chapter and that's it. Also annoying mary sue don't care super cool feMC and annoying marty stu deuterantagonist rich son faggot.</br>  It's not bad  <br>This guy gets it.</br>  <br>Glasslip ended up not doing anything despite setting up a lot of shit. This remains to be seen.</br>  <br>The problem with the show is that it has all been done better before. The characters are bland cut outs of various popular archetypes. All that being said I wouldn't call it bad persay. Just horribly average. Its decent production values are wasted on a show that I know the end of from episode 2. There are no surprises and as such it's just boring.</br>  <br> I don't know, man, I don't write the show <br>Well why the fuck not?

Never. </br></br>  I wish I wasn't so low level when the event happened  <br>I wasn't and didn't get her anyways.<br>Hopefully she'll drop from 4-5 at some point.</br></br>  <br>damn that sucks how long does it usually take for event ships to start dropping?</br>  <br>TWO YEARS<br>At which point the servers will have already been shut down. Tough luck</br></br>  Fairies a shit.    <br>I'd like to see you clear the event without them.</br>    <br>Anywhere between the event right after and never.</br>  現在「艦これ」運営鎮守府では、今夏作戦展開予定の「艦これ」夏イベント2<wbr>015：期間限定海域の実装＆展開準備を進めています。同作戦開始は、来月<wbr>【八月上旬】を予定です。同作戦は夏季恒例の【大規模作戦】、【ソロモン海<wbr>域】方面への作戦展開を予定しています。<br>Aw yeah baby, we're coming home.</br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  What's with Takao class and being utterly meaty and delicious  <br>Top heavy, large superstructure compared to other CAs.</br>    Are you faggots ready for the return of gauge regen? This time with ship locking.  SOLOMON, I'VE RETURNED  why is Atago such a shotacon?  <br>Not canon.</br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>I feel like most of the people on these threads weren't at the 1st Solomon event.</br>  <br>And they're about to get taste of what real pain feels like if they weren't around for AL/MI either.</br>  Event is confirmed for "beginning of the next month".<br><br>So I guess it'll be something like April 4 considering how the last event started on a Tuesday as well?</br></br>  <br>I only managed to get in after the event ended. Didn't have much luck with the lottery.<br><br>I still kick myself for missing out on that torp.</br></br></br>  <br> Event is confirmed for "beginning of the next month". <br>That was confirmed a week ago.</br></br>  As unlikely as it is I hope they do a remix of this for the final boss node<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uaG<wbr>xytQz2_8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>We've known it was starting at the beginning of August since July 1st, all they've confirmed now is that i's in the Solomons Sea again, like Iron Bottom Sound. Not all events start on the same day of the week either, it could be as late as the first Friday or the week after.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying early is the same as beginning <br>Early can be 2nd week as well. Beginning is usually first week. It's an annoying difference.</br></br>   boss is Flagship Re Kai with BB Water Oni and BB Hime escorts <br>Make it happen devs.</br>  <br>Upgraded quints are better, 53cm just look cooler.</br>  Why are they reusing a past event? They are seriously skipping the Marianas or Leyte for this?  <br>You do know upgraded torps don't have extra accuracy, right? Upgraded quints are worse off than 53cms by 1 accuracy point.</br>   Poi   <br>Because it's time to show newfags what real pain is. What better way to do it than to show them what night battles are like?</br>  <br>Except we now have yasen gear.</br>  <br> a remix of a remix <br>Well, now.</br></br>  <br>Thanks devs. Now all that's left is to announce that Re-chan will appear in this event. Will sacrificial DDs also be making a return?</br>  <br>Yes, with voices now.</br>  <br> the enemy now has yasen gear to cancel out yours too <br> all the enemies at night have double attack on top of that </br></br>  Out of interest how much actual money have you anons spent on kancolle?  <br>Yasen equipment isn't going to help you against an army of Ri Kai.</br>  <br>You already have fags using sacrifical DDs on 1-6.</br>  <br>Hey man, gotta do something with those dups from 1-1 sparkling.</br>   she sees your miracles       <br>Then Zerkbikki would probably wreck a continent or two.</br>    <br>Maybe that's alchemy loli's plan.</br>    <br>Aren't you that Flip Love Live fag?</br>  <br>Burd calm the fuck down.</br>  <br>dat byrd</br>  <br>She a good too.</br>  <br>Umi is the only answer</br>   Meanwhile, in 2007 /a/   <br>Do you happen to have rocket lawnchairs?</br>  <br>Yes, now everyone just rips them from Crunchyroll.</br>  <br>Night time /a/ died as a natural consequence to the board growth. Even in 07/08, people argued whether or not there really was a "night time /a/," and many simply thought that if there were a higher quality on the board during those hours, it was simply due to less number of people posting.</br>  <br>I don't usually condone school shootings, but you school could have benefited from one.</br>  <br>Purikyua!</br>  Shows that deserve a second season but will never get one.  <br>well I haven't finished the manga more than where the tv series left of, guess I'll just keep it this way.</br>  <br> Tiger and Bunny <br>It might get one, in between 5 and 10 years from now, according to Ozaki's Bandai Namco Pictures panel at AX. Currently they have nothing either in the works or planned.<br><br> The Rising movie sold like hotcakes for the show that didn't have new material in three years <br>Coincidentally I just checked how much Rising sold exactly and it was over 40k discs in less then two months.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But there was no set up for a second season. The big bad was defeated at the very end. And the hero is happy forever after.</br>  Highschool of the Dead<br> mfw jiggle physics </br>    Thoughts on Little Witch Academia and its sequel, The Enchanted Parade, /a/?  <br>old side characters really took a back seat to the new ones. Lotte's singing was also pretty lame and she's easily the worst of the gang even below fatty-chan</br>  <br> lotte <br> below fatty <br>I'll fucking stab you</br></br></br>  <br>Lotte was great in the first episode, but besides the cute/clumbsy broom dance she didnt really do anything in episode 2</br>  <br> she didnt really do anything in episode 2 <br>Apart from, y'know, get the most character development and be the one to save the day.</br></br>  <br>that's some good stuff right there<br><br>I would crowdfund that<br><br>I get a bunch of bros all together and ram all kinds of washingtons and jeffersons in that shit</br></br></br></br></br>  What would you do in this situation?  <br>24-26</br>  I want to sniff between Umaru's legs  No incest hints, they said.  <br> PLAY SOCCER WITH IT </br>  <br>I hate you.</br>  Was Rolling Girls a good anime?  <br> zero battles </br>  Main characters are completely forgettable and you don't remember their names even at the end. Some episodic plots are weak, especially the finale one, which was also where the budget ran out.<br>That said, the animation was fucking amazing, the music was great, and even if it wasn't super great, I still think you should watch it since the high points outshine its low points any day.<br>Also </br></br>  The show had a cool aesthetic and I the character designs were pretty fresh, but the story was crap and alot of the show was boring save for the moments where they clearly just wanted to show off their animation. I wouldn't call it good.  <br>Absolutely.</br>  <br>for you</br></blockquote>]
