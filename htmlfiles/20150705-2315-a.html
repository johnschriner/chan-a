[ /a/, do you like armpit pussy?  I'd rather your boypussy, OP.  Yes.  Why is /a/ so lewd today ?  <br>What do you mean with lewd?</br>   on the train today <br> see poster about it being the season for sweaty armpits and if you sweat too much it might be a medical condition and you should see your doctor <br> their website is even waki-ase.jp <br> get boner <br><br>why</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are fetishes genetic? I don't have a foot fetish at all, but I've discovered this one all of a sudden</br>  <br>how do you exactly unlock a fetish ?<br>If it gives you a boner does it mean you have unlocked it ?</br></br>  Monogatari is the Call of Duty/Assassin's Creed of anime. It gets yearly rehashes (sometimes even two seasons a year) that everybody seems to eat up without question while there are plenty of great anime that actually DESERVE more seasons and never see more than one. <br><br>Why is this considered okay?</br></br>  Because the fans financially support it.  <br> everyone <br>No, this has a very specific fanbase. Somewhere between thse who think this is somehow more highbrow than the average haremshit and those who easily fall for waifu-bate.</br></br>  I like it when people use capital letters when they want to focus on something.  <br>It's not like we can properly &lt;i&gt;italicize&lt;/i&gt; things on this site.</br>  Still better than your favorite anime OP. <br><br>Hehe, owned...</br></br>  I really don't understand this series, it's just so fucking boring. It's not even good boring like Hidamari Sketch.  <br>Yeah bro you just don't understand. Having to pause the video every ten seconds to read a wall of text that flashes on the screen is what makes it such a deep meaningful masterpiece</br>  <br> DESERVE <br><br>First, kill yourself for using all caps. <br><br>Second, if people supported those other "deserving" series half as well as Monogatari, you'd be seeing multiple seasons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a better way to add emphasis to text than all caps?</br>  <br> Hehe, owned... <br>Get the fuck out<br><br> inb44 you start shitposting harder <br>Not gonna reply you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know this is a shitpost but I still don't know what you're trying to say</br>  <br>There are people who legitimately believe that</br>  <br>if you didn't like it you just have shit taste, what differs it from yearly gaming rehashes is that it's actually good and based on something so it's not a rehash in the first place.<br>and go back the fuck to your  shitposter-kun</br></br>   yearly <br>2009<br>There is a big gap between Bake and Nise, OP.<br>Tsuki was released earlier because the studio probably need to manage the inconsistent count for episodes in a cour for broadcasting purposes.</br></br></br>  <br>make a bigger copypasta i want to spam this in the future</br>  <br> rehashes </br>  <br>You're an idiot. Nobody's meant to read all of it.<br>I'm Japanese, and even I can't read it all. You get little snippets of information from them -- kanji is nice in that way that just seeing a few of them can give you a lot of context -- but I certainly can't read ALL of it in the split second it flashes up on the screen, and it's not meant to ALL be read.</br></br>  <br>No, that would be Fate, anon.</br>  <br>Fate is the marijuana of anime.</br>  <br> sometimes even two seasons a year <br><br>There's literally only two seasons.</br></br></br>   Hana was a mistake <br>-SHAFT.</br>  <br> yearly rehashes <br>Stopped reading right there, you don't know what a rehash is.</br></br>  <br> It gets yearly rehashes (sometimes even two seasons a year) <br>The entire series only has 62 episodes over the course of 6 years, something like Precure would be closer to what you described as they have a new series air every year and really don't have a lot of variation, and each series is around 50 episodes. A series having 60 episodes in 6 years is nothing. Stop being such a pleb.</br></br>   complains that adaptations of long series get never finished <br> complains that something get a full adaptation. </br>  <br> marijuana <br>No, Fate is really more fitting, since it is the complete normalfag shit for teens.</br></br>  <br> I'm Japanese. </br>  <br>To be fair, that's not true, there's at least three with Bake, Nise, and BakeS2.</br>  <br>Go vote with your dollars if you have an issue.</br>  <br> yearly rehashes <br>I wish.<br><br>Also<br> comparing anime to videogames <br>As expected of a summerfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nise is a part of Bake. So there are literally 2 and 1/3 seasons have been produced so far.</br>  <br>You're not supposed to read it all, just catch glimpses of words or phrases.</br>  <br> Call of Duty/Assassin's Creed <br> Monogatari <br><br>You are mistaken. Monogatari is more like the Souls series.<br><br> Revolves around an undead protagonist trying to survive in a world full of monsters <br> Fanbase thinks it has a deep lore when it is in fact shallow <br> The series is hard to get into because it has a casual filter (Text dump/hard difficulty) <br> Gets a release every year <br> Kizumonogatari will never get a release just like Demon Souls 2 <br><br><br>Call of Duty/Assassin's Creed is more like Type-Moon titles.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like marijuana</br>  We should get the official announcement for more Monogatari in two days.  <br>IDS HABBENIGN<br><br>https://twitter.com/nisioisin_anime<wbr>/status/617623862549745664</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> https://twitter.com/nisioisin_anim<wbr>e/status/617623862549745664</wbr> <br>That's an announcement for BD release.</br></br>  <br>Everyone already knows about the Nise-Neko box set already anon.</br>  <br>lol you just mad because no one buys your manime</br>  Okay but we can all agree that Cat is best girl right?  <br>claiming the series is like that of COD's and/or AC's, states that this post is utter bullshit</br>   Listening to music at work <br> Something that sounds vaguely familiar comes on <br> Can't place it <br> Two days later realize that Two Steps From Hell did a full orchestral remix of Tsukihi's theme <br> It's even called "Flight of the Silverbird" <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=L3P<wbr>Ai8lyv34</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It's fucking great, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just a coincidence.</br>  <br>Doesn't Tsukihime just play straight-up classical music that's in the public domain?</br>  <br>He's talking about Tsukihi, the little sister, not Tsukihime.</br>  <br>What theme?

I find it less boring than 95% of the shit I watch.  I think I may have some bizarre variant of ADHD, since I also have a much harder time sitting through an anime without distracting myself than reading a manga. </br></br>  <br>its more like the world of warcraft of anime.</br>  <br>Souls series released Artorias the Abysswalker DLC (Prepare to Die) for the 1st game and Crown of the Sunken King, Crown of the Old Iron King and Crown of the Ivory King DLC for the 2nd game (Scholar of the First Sin).

Instead of making the show, Kirito encounters and saves a girl the show, they could've done more with what they had, but for what it's worth, the character dialogues weren't all that cringe inducing for anime and the action was solid.

Overpowered mecha that defeat established kings and god without trained crew</br>  Popular shows will receive hate whether they deserve it or not. Proven non-generic example is Little Witch Academia 2 (look at all those hate in sticky). You can see those hate came from people who doesn't even watch them. Also occasional hate on /arc-v/  <br> arc-v <br>That's probably less because it's popular and more because it's Yugioh (I haven't seen Arc-V, but I remember watching the first two series, and they were pretty terrible).</br></br>   Highschool DxD <br>It has become dumber and dumber to the point where i don't even care what bullshit they vomit next season, i just need to watch the end.<br><br> Oreimo <br>Decent first season that fucks itself with a bunch of OVAs, has a godawful second season and ends with one of the most shitty harem ending of all time.<br><br> Abarenbou Rikishi!! Matsutarou <br>23 episodes of dumb toilet humor and shitty animation, worst sport show i've seen.<br><br> Glasslip <br>Besides the fact that is a show about nothing, about nothing people where nothing happens in the end, it end up making me pick up Shirobako late, which was one of the best anime of the same year.<br><br> Strange+ <br>It's just a bunch of bad sex jokes, it's just so unfunny that it angers me.<br><br> Wizard Barristers <br>I expected the minimal knowledge of law when i saw that and at least mediocre tier animation through the whole show, i was disappointed both ways.<br><br>I'm sure there are more but this is all i can think of right now.<br><br> Red Data Girl <br>The MC, the love interest and the side characters are all unlikable, by the end of it i just wished everybody died.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  escaflowne<br><br>all i wanted was fucking fantasy mechs fighting<br><br>instead i got a bunch of bullshit and an annoying girl yelling NO DONT FIGHT over and over whenever there was a fight</br></br></br></br>  The child molester looking guy from monogatari series. Stealing from hitagi and tricking her made me so angry, even more angry than opening 4 of the S2 of the series that I was so glad he got stabbed.  <br>Anything that has an MC who excuses himself for everything short of breathing.</br>  white album 2, sword art online and high school dxd. all tied for worst anime i've watched  Why's it cool to not like Kill la Kill?

Horrible crap with even more horrible underaged fanbase.  <br>This is about anime you hate, not characters you hate.<br><br> Interestingly, I think loli has made me hate pedophile/child molester-type characters even more. Lolis are for loving, not abusing. </br></br></br>  <br>Well he did also steal from them and abused araragis sister and other small children psychologicly, if psychological torment is bad and abuse, then yeah he is a abuser.</br>  <br>here is your reply</br>  <br>No it doesn't.</br>   Toradora <br>I'll never get how this garbage can have such a high rating<br> D-Frag <br>Just terrible</br></br></br>  Are you ready to starting working anon?  <br>OP kinda shows her facing him, kinda. Maybe it's a hint.</br>  Maybe next Working! will get animated. They deserve more than an april fools joke  Is yamada abused at home?  <br>You think a light hearted comedy has anything like that lurking behind the scenes? Inami's androphobia was a side-effect of an overprotective father, Yamada just ran away because her mother said she couldn't have ice cream before dinner.</br>  <br>I tend to overthink simple stuff like this, its almost second nature</br>  How come Fate/Stay Night gets so many adaptations and spin-offs?<br><br>How many times can you fags want to watch an autistic knight, tsundere mage and this wormslut? At least Sakura's a proper slut and wants the dick all the time.</br></br>  I want to breed Sakura with /a/  The whole series is shit including the chick in your pic OP.  <br> How come Fate/Stay Night gets so many adaptations and spin-offs? <br><br>Because both the base concept of the Holy Grail War and the greater lore of the Nasuverse have a fuckton of potential.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why is the base thing still being adapted? They should just make something interesting with the series.</br>  <br>Because it still hasn't been adapted in full, despite how popular it is.</br>  <br>In terms of Anime adaptions it really hasn't had that many compared to other series.<br> 3 25-26 ep tv series <br> 1 movie with more to come <br><br>compared to FMA for example<br> 2 tv series 51/64 eps <br> 2 movies </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>everything beside zero is trash</br>  <br>I thought evolution was supposed to have people pick out ideal mates with superior genetic quality not busted up retards?</br>  <br>Butcherdrone please leave.</br>  <br>Anime only fag here. I only watched the first F/SN anime, F/Z, the UBW movie, and now UBW. Just now started reading the VN.<br>And I have yet to see Sakura act like the evil bitch everyone has talked about. Will I see it in HF?</br></br>  Pretty good start overall and the story is pretty good at least on the LN. what do you think /a/.<br><br>Also <br> FREMY THE ONLY BEST GIRL <br> RABBIT CAN SUCK DICKS AND GTFO </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty fun<br><br> When should we see the girl in pic related? </br></br></br>  <br>Next episode for sure</br>  After watched the OP&amp;ED, i know why this show have 2 OP and 3 ED  <br>Next episode.</br>  <br>How many episodes is going to have this show? because the LN is actually on volume 5 so they can go and rush until that volume (cuz cliffhanger at the end) or they can just stay with 12 episodes and 3 volumes adapted.</br>  <br> Rabbit girl isn't actually a Rabbit girl <br><br><br>Lame</br></br></br></br>   art and animation looks beautiful as fuck <br> music sounds mellifluous <br> compelling story <br> yet nobody cares about it <br>This must be Pleiades of this season.</br></br></br></br>  The OP is quite nice.  Shit anime, how can there be conflict when the MC is the strongest man in the world?  So everyone's going to die right? The scene in the ending showed "strongest man in the world" half starved to death and looking defeated. I hope he abandons his comrades and watches them all get slaughtered as he flees.  <br>I think full 3 vols would be a nice stop.<br><br><br>Really? I think they gonna change after some character left and join.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HAVE YOU EVER READ ONEPUNCH?!</br>  <br>12 episodes. Some say that they will adapt only 2 volumes would be pretty cool if that's true.<br><br>Volume 2 would be better.</br></br></br>   THIS  <br> IS  <br> SPARTA!!! </br></br>  <br>He says strongest but he's a trickster. It grinds my autism.</br>  AOTS  it's set on 1400ish México  <br>Had the stupid LN thing where two characters that both have the same knowledge exposit to each other for no reason other than the audience doesn't have information, but other than that, it was good. A very nice pilot. Hope the quality keeps up.</br>  <br>You know what, if you follow Passione's twitter account right now, you're even in first 20 to follow them.<br><br>https://twitter.com/office_passione<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>How would a mediocre shounen be AOTS?</br>  <br>I love the Aztec setting. It's pretty rare to see fantasy anime having a non-european world. Definitely the setting itself is a breath of fresh air, we will have to see rest of the show to see if it ends up being good. Had a good start though</br>  I had a lot of fun watching this ep. I like the MC. The combination of cocksure and complete dick dirty fighter is enjoyable. I like the setting, the art and music were OK.<br><br>This is the sort of show could go horribly, horribly wrong, but I'll keep watching for now.</br></br>  <br>The strongest is a trickster, simple as that.</br>  Question for those who read the LN, does the story get serious/dark in the future? I don't like suffering or edgy stuff.  <br>They are expanding very slowly.</br>  <br>Look for the previous thread if you want big ass spoilers.</br>  <br>I know the feeling. There's a ton of terrible LN adaptations out there that start off promising with great pilots, and then the budget just goes to shit. Not to mention I think the longer an LN goes on, the worse it gets. The medium as a whole seems to have a problem of being needlessly drawn out. The planning ends after like one volume, then they start to wear the premise thin with bullshit.<br><br>Fingers crossed. I think I'll like the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Shhhhhhhhut up, Anon. It's too early to say that.</br>  Cant wait for Black Rabbit.   reading vol. 1 <br> finally find out   who the fake is <br> "Ok, now the plot can finally continue!" <br> read the epilogue <br> mfw <br><br>Are they fucking serious?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How the fuck did Passione go from Rail Wars to this? Holy shit what an improvement.  <br>Better director</br>  <br>those rabbit hips are so unf</br>  <br> The scene in the ending showed "strongest man in the world" half starved to death and looking defeated. <br>Have you seen the episode? That's when he was young and went to his master.</br></br>  <br><br><br>The second episode ends a little bit after goldov shows up. 80% chance it'll just be two volumes or at the very most 3.</br></br></br>  <br>Black guy looks like an asshole.<br><br>Let me guess, is he MC's rival in getting some rabbit's pussy?</br></br></br>  <br> but he's a trickster <br>Hisoka wants to have a word with you.</br></br>  <br>He's not an asshole.<br> rival in getting some rabbit's pussy <br>Adlet isn't interested.</br></br></br>  <br>He's her knight.</br>  LNfag here. Chamo is best girl post.  <br> token loli <br> not even fanservice <br> best anything </br></br></br>  <br>yeah he's more intrested in Remy than Nash</br>  <br> Adlet isn't interested. <br>B-but those hips goddamn. <br>It's asking to be destroyed.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to put my penis inside the rabbit girl.</br>  <br>Only thing that irked me, is that his little fire to the face trick in the fight didn't blind the old guy or burned his face.</br>  <br>LNfag here, Chamo is an annoying cunt.</br>  <br>  muh kill <br>  muh pet <br>  muh angry <br>worse charecter ever</br></br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/xgdqswbuva.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  So is the LN to this actually good or is it just generic shitty LN tier shit?  <br>Depends on your tastes. It's not harem for starters, more like mystery.</br>  <br> fagboy protag fighting and edgy bullshit <br>What do you think?</br></br>  The designs and animation aren't that great but I liked the setting.  <br>Wow, you serious?</br>  <br><br>The only thing that grinds my autism is that the story is supposedly in an Aztec/Maya setting, yet there are no human sacrifices.</br></br>  <br>It's fantasy/mystery. I'm personally not one who likes mystery but hey, if it's your cup of tea. Had to drop it because I couldn't stomach the characters.</br>  <br>Now, I am not a fag, but the MC's gradient hair tingles my dick.<br>Honestly, gradient hair in general does. We need more of it.</br></br>  <br>It's like people don't even think Chamo is adorable as fuck.</br>  <br>You mean to tell me there's no romance between the two?</br>  <br>Not really. Next thing you know and she's trying to stab Adlet.</br>  <br>None at all.</br>  <br>I am incredibly inclined to agree 100%<br><br>Mora a cunt<br>Nash a literal beastiality slut<br>Molonia a shit<br>Fremy is love though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She loves dogs.</br>  <br>What's the point of a token loli? She's never going to be anything more than that</br>  <br><br>Dropped like it's hot.</br></br>  <br>She's the required team-fight specialist in terms of combat.<br>She's the naiive yet OP character to be turned against the rest as necessary when it comes to spotting the 7th.<br>She can the strong point or the weak link of the party as the plot requires, as in vol 3 or 4.</br></br></br>  <br>None.</br>  <br>Rabbit only has tits. I always associated her with light blue rather than yellow for some reason.</br>  <br>So, a token loli.</br>    <br>Brute strength gets you fucking nowhere here, the kyouma bosses are all clever bastards that will fuck you up if you're dumb.</br>  <br>Well I mean after Rail Wars, expectations of the studio must not be great.</br>  <br>The wild ride never ends.</br>  <br>Truly we never would have guessed by the iconic Aztec-like architecture and apparel.</br>  <br>Shame. she has the best design out of the girls. <br>I almost thought I finally found a main girl who's also the best girl.</br></br>  <br>On the subject of Rail Wars, how well did the show do sales wise?</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Heh.</br>  <br>Yeah, look at what happened to Chamo</br>  <br> Caring about romance </br>  <br> Rail Wars <br> Sales <br>Pick one</br></br></br>  <br>No Quetzalcoatl/Kukulcan.</br>  <br>You poor fool.</br>  I wanted him not to be chosen but still be wrecking shit.  <br>I expect them to be the next Gonzo.</br>  <br>Indeed.<br>Looking forward to it.</br></br>  <br>But that's not Fremy.</br>  <br>It's possible that she is interested in him but the romance is between Adlet and Fremy.</br>  Is the LN finished?  <br>no</br>  I am the bone of my sword <br> Steel is my body and fire is my blood <br> I have created over a thousand blades <br> Unknown to Death, Nor known to Life <br> Have withstood pain to create many weapons <br> Yet, those hands will never hold anything <br> So as I pray, unlimited blade works.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   generic oriental epic music à la Disney Alladin <br> disgusting art and animation, full of CGI, pale aztecs, otaku baits, and more <br> all the budget (probably that of next episode too) spent on the tournament battle, the rest of the show filled to the brim with QUALITY <br> the most mediocre ``play it safe'' OP and ED <br> story is some mix of everything the MAL and tumblr fanbases would love -- super strong arrogant charming MC with a tragic past, a beautiful mysterious traitorous princess, pretend-fantasy, ANCIENT EVIL HAS AWAKENED AND YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE, jungle shenanigans, edgy, grandiose, magic, betrayal, psychopath <br><br>Perhaps this whole post could have been summarised simply with <br> LN adaptation <br>Moreover, the threads and the fanbase are pure cancer. Spoilers everywhere, delusional circlejerk, /v/, pleb culture, pretending their little shitty book wannabe is good and /a/ likes it, etc. Truly this will be one of the worst shows this season. Maybe even the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bait</br>  <br>gb2 your LWA thread</br>  <br>Sod off, Anon.<br>Just because Fate threads are done doesn't mean you can shitpost anywhere else.</br></br>    <br><br><br>Nice rebuttal, faglords.<br> he is not part of the circlejerk so he is troll <br>Disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS. previous thread cancerous as fuck. they dont even hide the spoilers</br>  <br>C-can i pick none?</br>  <br>Why does one has to refute when your opinion is subjective to yourself?<br>Although I agree that there were a lot of flying spoilers in the last thread.</br></br>  <br>You actually see that he's missing a brow and half his beard.</br>  I do not like Adlet.<br><br>Im glad to see a more assertive MC but he's just a cunt. He starts trouble and is rewarded for it while he just repeats how strong he is over and over. That's not engaging and certainly not endearing.<br><br>the princess is a right boring shit too. I know it's only episode one but I don't think it's so much to ask to at least pretend to have likable characters</br></br></br></br>  AOTS with charlotte  <br><br><br>Nice samefag.</br></br></br>  <br>What kind of power does a Salt Saint have, anyway?!</br>   Mesoamerica setting and artstyle <br>Well this is a surprise.</br>  Holy crap, the battle animations where fucking good. I just hope they don't drop the quality.  <br>A hit turn you into clump of salt, very OP.</br>  <br>Stop samefagging, idiot.</br>  <br>Producing salt</br>  <br> Ctrl+f Chamo and best girl <br> One result <br>I came to make sure a best girl post for Chamo was made. Anon didn't disappoint me today. <br><br>Chamo is the strongest and greatest.</br></br></br></br></br>  This anime gave me some Yona of the Dawn vibes. Anyone else?  His eyes clearly say "look at this shit outfit I gotta wear".  <br>You sound angry. Why are you so angry, anon?</br>   Watch first episode <br> Seems interesting, let's check it out <br> Start reading LN <br> First paragraph, bitch princess is trying to impale fagMC <br>We're in for a wild ride, I see. At least I'll be suitably entertained.</br></br></br></br>  How will adlet beat fucking demons? He only uses traps to fight, unlike the blade princess who seems OP as fuck.  <br>His the world's strongest man. That's how.</br>  <br>literaly Cirno</br>  <br>He hold them off with his petty tricks, bunny is the one finishing them off.</br>  <br>Poison mainly, also stuff like flash and smoke bombs, he actually brews up all the shit he uses himself. Against the actual monsters, it's pretty effective, but then again all the other heroes are even moreso.<br><br>He does get his shit pushed in relatively quickly to the point he realizes he's not so hot shit though. The hot shit thing point of view he maintains for himself has relevance to his motives and character though.</br></br></br>  <br>He's actually pretty respectable all round, even without his gadgets. That said, brains is his biggest weapon.</br>  <br>Poisons and bombs work on them, they're more aberrations of nature than demons.</br>  <br>Why do you think he trained so hard? And what tells you his weapons are not effective? He doesn't only fight with hidden weapons, he trained his body and is smart as well, he's the Batman of the group.</br>  <br><br><br><br>These is the most retarded thing I've ever read. <br>It's as bad as saying that guns can kill servants from fate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to enjoy this anime but I know it's not going to end resolved. Is it too much to ask for a high fantasy anime that actually fucking has an ending?</br>  <br>are* Fuck.</br>  Looks pretty good. I think that its more because direction was decent and it was written pretty well than because of how it looks. lets just hope they don't shat themselves  <br>What the flying fuck made you think that these were anything like servants from Fate? Most of them are barely any better than animals.</br>  <br>Guns &gt; Magics<br>Don't you have Gate thread to shitpost into?</br></br>  Just finished and I gotta say that Adlet is like the Yona of this series, probably the weakeast fuck.  <br>Goldof fights with a spear and heavy armor, Hans dual wields swords, they are among the strongest heroes, faggot.</br>  <br>How are the two related? To be honest, if humans had NBC protection and even WWII level tech, this would have been over so much faster.</br>  <br>He's the strongest anon, THE STRONGEST.</br>  <br>His only the STRONGEST MAN. Chamo is still the strongest person aside from the OP time saint.</br>  <br>Chamo is retarded and a jobber, he can easily outwit her.</br>  At the end Edlet and the Sword princess will fuck and marry. <br>Remember these words.</br>  <br>If by fuck and marry, you mean battle to the death in a climatic battle then sure.</br>  <br><br> smartest/batman of the group <br>There's someone smarter than him in the group.<br>Hans Humpty.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither won't die and she'll regain her senses.<br>Come on anon, it's like you never watched anime before.</br></br>  <br>Amen, brother.</br>  <br>No, Hans is the second smartest.</br>  She sure looked damn nice throughout that opening episode.  <br>I think Hans is more experienced, but Adlet sees the bigger picture and is generally regarded as less likely to be the 7th, which is why he gets the leadership position.</br>  <br> Edlet <br>Sure, that can happen. <br>Adlet will fuck and marry Fremy though.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, if the shit posters can do it so can he.</br>  <br>And what happens to Fremy?</br>  <br>She's the best girl, don't believe the fake spoilers.</br>  <br>Everyone like to shit on her but honestly the flowers' plan isn't great either<br> You have 30 days to seal the demon king  <br> If you had to fail the world is be fucked. <br> Repeat this every 100 years. <br>If one team fail they are doomed. They should find a way to get rid of the Maijin for good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tender loving by Aldet. Seriously, she is by far the most likely if you really read the LNs.</br>  <br>Adlet is the one who solved the mystery, he relies on Hans a lot because he knows how smart he is too and Hans fears Adlet the most. Though Hans is perceptive he has never been ahead of Adlet when it comes to strategy.</br>  So Adlet is a punk who is just smart but is way over his head. So lame. I guess he ain't even a Saint.  <br> It's as bad as saying that guns can kill servants from fate. <br>How so? Servants are the incarnations of the strongest heroes of mankind, easily capable of moving at supersonic speeds and slaughtering armies on their own. The fiends are just scrub monsters, so there's no reason why bombs, poisons and other stuff can't work on them.</br></br>  <br>Yes, that's why I am asked him this. She's the love interest.</br>  <br> They should find a way to get rid of the Maijin for good. <br>Thing respawns so good luck with that.</br></br>  <br>Only females can be Saint, retard. You should read the source material instead of posting shit relying on spoilers.</br>  <br> Only females can be Saints <br>That's so retarded.</br></br>  <br> fiends <br> just scrub monsters <br>Animefag just create a Fate thread and discuss about your Servant nonsense.</br></br></br>  <br>Hans doesn't have the information. He also said that he feared Adlet the most because he's in the leadership position, clearly stating his chief consideration is how much damage a betrayal would bring, and Adlet was the one guiding the group. Hans was the first one to suspect Mora as well.</br>  <br>I thought it was supposed to be 6th petals, what is this.</br>  <br>They pretty much are really. They are conventional firepower, relying mostly on numbers, and lacking in genuine hax that some servants are known for.</br>  <br>I think it got me to pay attention more than a Medieval European setting would.</br>  <br>6 chosen ones were promised. 7 showed up with the mark. Then another showed up after the first traitor was discovered and ran off. It's not exactly going according to plan.</br>  <br>You are brainwashed by shitty fantasy anime, there's nothing wrong with fiends being killed by normal means.<br><br>I think it's nice to see a more trickster, roguish MC. But I bet most people just want the usual overpowered magic swordsman.</br></br></br>  The more I read the LN the more I hate it.  <br> traitor <br>I bet it's the sketchy looking guy in the cover picture with the blue hair covering his eyes.</br></br>  <br>Elaborate.</br>   it's been 700 years since the first round of heroes  <br>So what the fuck have they been doing all this time that they still need heroes to deal with scrub fiends and the regular army won't do? It's been 700 years, in that time we went from our own Medieval period to fucking WW2.</br>  <br>Kyouma are bottom of the barrel trash most of the time outside of stuff like the bug queen that figman uses, the fig itself and the like.</br>  <br>All this drama about the  seventh  and shit up in a fantasy setting, when characters should be getting shit done.</br>  Fucking spoilers man, now my autism nerve exploded. I'm now angsty and want to see who the traitor is.<br><br>Also do the mark give them power ups or na?</br></br>  <br>Actually, that's really fast for a high fantasy setting. <br><br>Most fantasy campaign settings in pnp rpg, thousands of years pass and absolutely nothing happens.</br></br></br>  <br>So it's 2 traitors!</br>  <br>The majin corrupts everything around it, just being in the area would kill you, you need one of those crests just to get close to it, the average kyouma still needs a squad of people to take down and their tech level isn't all that high. The kyouma spawn endlessly so throwing bodies at them won't work either.</br>  Japan is angry that the western simulcast of GATE removed the JSDF flag<br><br>http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/655<wbr>86<br><br>How do you feel about western anime distribution sites politically censoring the anime they sub?</br></br></wbr></br></br>  Please don't bring politics to /a/.  <br>kill yourself</br>  Obviously they shouldn't change anything, political or not.  <br>I don't feel anything because there are "sub"groups that conveniently encode the untouched raws for me and you.</br>  <br>They're not censoring it for political reasons.

The problem is that you cannot prove yourself against someone who is much weaker than yourself. They are in a lose-lose situation. If you are strong and fighting the weak, then if you kill your opponent then you are a scoundrel... if you let him kill you, then you are an idiot. So here is a dilemma which others have suffered before us, and for which as far as I can see there is simply no escape. Now the Israeli army has not by any means been the worst of the lot. It has not done what for instance the Americans did in Vietnam... it did not use napalm, it did not kill millions of people. So everything is relative, but by definition, to return to what I said earlier, if you are strong and you are fighting the weak, then anything you do is criminal."<br><br>-some jew</br></br>  <br>Meh having unlimited access to American military technology helps.</br>  <br> unlimited </br>  <br>Google is your friend fellow American, don't stay delusional to where our tax money goes.</br>  <br>I really hope someone pays to do one of those with Rory.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127614082 <br>Kill yourself, shitstain.</br>  <br>Nagi is a pathetic cunt, you shouldn't be surprised.</br>  <br>The amount of self-hatred here makes me physically ill.

Don't lie fucker i know you're here  <br>Not me but that's pretty funny. How did they react?</br>  ak thread?  <br>I couldn't see who it was, but he asked this. <br> "So on some certain boards, people have been saying that GATE is actually just a recruitment scheme for JSDF, is that true?" <br>They responded that it was just out of pure entertainment, and not affiliated with JSDF.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a FAMAS ?</br>  <br>What if Japan outlives 10000 years?</br>  This is worth watching solely for the lack of teenage-boy main character. Finally someone I can identify with.  <br>BANZAI</br>  <br>We can't. The chinese subs run circles around the fleet. At best we could do a slight show of force to back down the Chinese, but that might backfire quickly.</br>  Why are there so many /pol/ threads this season?  <br>Because a lot of /pol/ stuff is going on as well in real life.<br>And shows are about /pol/ themes(ie political correctness).</br></br>  <br>meat to quote<br/></br>  Not really looking forward to this one. Manga and novel started out pretty interesting, then got more and more boring as it went on. Would have liked to see more involvement of altworld politics, instead we got cutesy trope characters and jingoist Japanese SDF is stronger than all bullshit.  <br>why yes it is</br>  <br><br>More IJA please.</br></br>  Quite liked the first episode, but judging what people are saying I'm expecting to drop this around the mid series mark.   actually thinking that there will be war with China <br>Yeah, and North Korea actually believes it can nuke people and go to war, instead of pretending as part of its strategy of ransom diplomacy</br>  <br>Pay is too little in my third world shithole country</br>  <br>That image never fails to make me laugh.</br>  this show is shit. few of the characters made sense, and the pacing was really strange.  People have been saying this is the worst first episode of the season. I didn't think it was bad, just incredibly boring.  GATE is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br>However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the GATE world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br>GATE is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no GATE threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br>  <br> The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry <br><br>C'mon son, get creative.</br></br></br>  Reminder that all this crap is just because people can't take Japan being a hero in their own story. <br>Here is a list of shitposts you should be wary about:<br> article 9 <br> war crimes <br> security treaty <br> jingoism <br> greater east asia co-prosperity sphere <br> world war 2, ww2 <br> rape of nanking <br> manchuria <br> american soldiers are the best <br> nationalistic <br> nippon steel folded x amount of times <br> nippon stronk <br> masturbatory power fantasy <br> JSDF wank <br>When encountered, report and hide.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And aside from frogeaters nobody wants to translate nuclear Yamato.  <br> giving Japan the atomic bomb <br>Great, I guess they just ensured the destruction of Japan because in a full-on nuclear exchange the US can produce more bombs faster than Japan can.</br></br>  I haven't read the manga, does it follow the army platoon around or does the MC break off at some point and go alone? If it's the latter it's an instant drop.  <br>They got their peace treaty.
