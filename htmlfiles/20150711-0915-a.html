[ おあがりよ!  First for Erina romance  For all you faggots who are too lazy to do your research:<br><br>No new episode today.</br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA  <br>I feared this because I didn't see it on my torrent client.<br><br>I waited for it all week too, fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks fam</br>  <br>There's still gonna be 3 or 4 posts asking where the episode is.</br>  <br>I can't wait for /a/ and /h/ when they are released</br>  subs when?  8th for erina is a pig  <br>What's the special? Some stuff with the VAs?</br>  Why do Asian men either look very feminine or just plain hideous like in OP pic?   tfw no subs   where's the episode?  I wish Megumi was like this so she could fuck me up then give me the wildest make up sex  <br>I hope he doesn't fuck up the Erina doujins.</br>  <br>Sukeban Megumi a best.</br>  <br>To be fair, we knew this a week ago so it wasn't really a surprise. I'm not blaming you for missing that info though.</br>  <br>But why.</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl coming through</br></br>  Why doesn't CR sub cast/seiyuu specials like the one we had this week? I mean come on they could totally shill that as an EXCLUSIVE BONUS FEATURE!!!  <br>i don't understand why you are actively trying to get people to hate your waifu<br><br>it's been proven that more posts = more hate</br></br></br>  <br>I want to cum in you while you cum in Erina</br>  <br>What a shame that Ai Kayano wasn't in that seiyuu show</br>  <br>Quads have not been wasted</br>  <br>I will protect that smile with my life anon</br>  Aldini style Insalata Frittata.<br><br>A lot better than I expected, good stuff.</br></br>  <br>Probably because they're harder to sub and CR is lazy.</br>  <br>Who was in it?</br>  <br>Looks delicious, but why did you add the extra sandwich meat on the sides?</br>    <br>I followed the recipe on the tankoubon, which added ham. <br>It works well though.</br></br>  <br>Shitty scans</br>  <br>L-lewd!</br>  <br>Was that uniform all she was wearing?</br>  <br>Not as hideous as you I bet.</br>  <br>WHYYYYYYYYYYYY</br>  <br>Where can I watch this?</br>  <br>the special had the VAs for Souma, Erina, Megumi, and Hisako.</br>  For anyone who didn't see it. The drama cd.<br> https://mikorin.wordpress.com/2015/<wbr>06/24/shokugeki-no-soma-volume-11-b<wbr>onus-drama-cd/</wbr></wbr> <br><br> tfw Takumi isn't clueless as he seems. </br></br></br>  Subs when?  <br>Ugly skin, style and hair</br>  <br>He's only clueless around Soma.</br>  <br>Holy fuck stop the shitposting already</br>  Anyone have a sub file that I can throw into the Ohys-Raw release?  <br>now that you mention it...</br>  <br>Does the dude have downs? Sure looks like it to me.</br>   Soma: Huh? What’s that black card? Is it a card from a karaoke place or something? <br><br> Erina: Huh? I don’t know. Hisako always uses this to go shopping. Hisako called it a black card… <br><br> neither of them know what a black card is <br><br> Erina doesn't know how rich she actually is </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>What's a black card?</br>  The fuck is wrong with that guy's hair  <br>He's 3dpd. Of course he has downs.</br>  <br>am ex black<br>the credit card you only get when you have 25millions on your one account and use many millions via your am ex account, too<br><br>at leats that used to be the threshhold</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the off chance you aren't being intentional, a black card is an invitation only credit card issued by visa after you reach a certain net worth.<br><br>TL;DR<br>Visa gives special cards to people who're rich as fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nikumi's one is quite cute. She is really not a bad character, if only she had a little more screentime where her character flashes out.<br><br>I also listened to the second drama while reading the script. Takumi's voice is so charming, I really like it.</br></br></br>  <br>American Express*</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centu<wbr>rion_Card</wbr></br>  <br> harem faggot <br><br>Good thing I never watched the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigga he's perfect as Soma.</br>  Multiple credit card companies have "black cards". And yes, Souma was being hilariously ignorant about rich people while accusing her of being the ignorant one, but because Erina was relying on Hisako so much, she let Souma talk her into thinking her credit card wasn't actually a credit card despite seeing Hisako use it.  <br>WHOA. There are people so rich they actually have their own special brand of credit card? I'm green with envy right now, I had to splurge on freaking cup noddles this week.</br>  <br>Isn't 25m for a gold card?</br>  <br>Of course he has a great voice, he's voiced by Hanae.<br>Is there lots of Takumi in it?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I mean, when you're in the 1% people want to you give you shit so you give them some of your copious amounts of money.</br>  was Gendo Ikari banging Rei?  <br>Plausibly.</br>  Yes.  she's basically a sex toy anyway  Why are the armies of the Empire's tributaries so proud to fight at the command of the Empire that they are desperate to be the vanguard? They enjoy being under the Imperial thumb and paying tribute?  Im getting Generation Kill vibes from this  <br>Being the vanguard means getting to the action first, means getting the best opportunity to win glory and fame and renown. It's not about the good of their country, it's about personal reputation. Feudal nobles love war.</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  They had a culture of honor. Something foreign in today's era unless you're east asian.<br> only japan has a genuine culture of honor <br> china has a culture of nationalism <br> korea has a culture of shame </br></br></br>  <br>She is strong like a bull for her size</br>   mfw they keep changing character designs   <br>More like sucking up is the best way to be promoted.</br>  I'm surprised they learned the language fast enough to draw these chicken scratches, but I'm more surprised they bothered to write the Japanese translation under the sign.  <br>They should had written the warnings in english too, just to be sure</br>  <br><br>The anime messed up her build. She's a 5' manlet (?) with quite a rack.</br></br>  <br>How much time did exactly pass since the gate was first opened?</br>  <br>Not even close as good or cathartic, there has to be magic and a campaign complete with a story. A good Company of Heroes - GATE edition if you will.</br>  <br> not latin <br>The sign should have read "Catapultam habeo. Nisi pecuniam omnem mihi dabis, ad caput tuum saxum immane mittam"</br></br>  <br><br>IIRC the invasions are a month or more apart. They had plenty of prisoners and time.</br></br>  <br>At least 3 months plus a week or so to build fortifications and tunnels.</br>  <br>I was afraid they would go with the route of the natives speaking Japanese and never acknowledging it</br>  <br>3 months</br>  Man, that was like playing a RTS in easy.   roman niggers invade Japan, slaughtering civilians, including children, without warning or mercy <br> JSDF retaliates, only killing armed soldiers who attacked and continue to attack them <br> /a/ will defend the former <br><br>Are you this butthurt your anime fantasy land got btfo?</br></br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/jivskrfyrh.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br> just to be sure <br>You make it sound as if the area is administered under UN. <br><br>US-Japan security treaty did not get invoked in the story btw.</br></br></br></br>  <br> plebs play Civ 5 </br>  <br> They should had written the warnings in english too <br>Why? Muricans will never pass through the gate</br></br>  <br>That's exactly the kind of nonsense that you'd expect from anon fantasyaboo apologists</br>   new moon <br> darkness <br>I can see the fucking light reflecting off their armor, they call this darkness?</br></br>  <br> implying that Japan isn't big on shame and nationalism </br>  生まれた 2 キル   i'll kill you if you badmouth my waifu <br><br>this is what fansubbing has become</br></br>  <br>one guy was in the previous thread</br>  <br><br>It was a joke<br><br>this nigga</br></br></br></br>  Why didn't they get some dwarves build a tunnel?  <br>Generation kill with montser girl.</br>  <br>But thats exactly what he said.</br>  <br> got their nationalism stomped in after ww2 <br> isn't a culture of shame because they don't readily apologize for their mistakes <br>It's a culture of honor.</br></br></br>  Why didn't they dig trenches for shelter, Romans knew how to dig trenches to stop enemy advances  <br>For their defense if it was truly dark you will only get a black screen.</br>  <br>Just think of them as meta-subs.</br>  So what's the point of this anime?<br>Fantasy-Romans are so backwards tech-wise that they aren't even close to being a legitimate threat.<br>Where's the tension supposed to come from?</br></br>  <br>Except they used the word for waifu you retarded fuck.</br>  <br>they'd need to survive arty barrages first to do that</br>  <br>How would they manage a long, arduous dig when artillery rains on them as soon as they step over the line?</br>  <br>How can they dig trenches while under fire?</br>  <br>Why don't you read the source material and find out, you lazy fucker?</br>  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br>Why don't you ask the same question in OPM threads faggot</br>  That little girl in the first episode, what are the chances that her mother is the earthling fuck slave of the prince?  <br>I too don't see much point of the battle.<br>Its not focus of the show. And the outcome is obvious.</br></br>  Is the novel translation ongoing? Or should I just read the manga instead?  <br>The tension in OPM comes from "how long can everyone else hold out until OPM arrives"</br>  <br>it's more about politic than war itself, read the manga</br>  <br>You dumb mother fucker, how are they to dig trenches and fortifications when they are under heavy fire and are within range of 105mm howitzers? Shut up</br>  <br>zero. it's been said noriko has no more family left on earth or something</br>   you will never go on patrol in fantasy land while singing your favorite op with your bros <br>Why even live.</br>  <br> I too don't see much point of the battle. <br>Actually this battle was VERY important. The Emperor sacrificed the forces of the Vassal States to prevent them from rebelling, but that has long term consequences.</br></br>  <br>It's a very deliberate attempt to parallel the 2nd Gulf War, but with dust mudhut desertland replaced with verdant european fantasy kingdoms, and smelly muslims replaced with elves and catgirls.<br><br>It's largely a political series juggling the personal story of a soldier and his company seeing things firsthand as occupying 'liberators', and a larger picture of the geopolitics of a technologically and culturally less developed nation being forcefully initiated into the 21st century by an occupying military, while also being plundered for its valuable resources in a geopolitical power struggle.</br></br></br>  <br> short chicks will never be around to tell you off for singing our favorite op <br>You don't even need to be in the military for that.</br></br>  <br>much appreciated</br>  <br>Its a medieval fantasy world meeting modern.<br>If you aren't getting kicks out of that and still need some super saiyan sharingan aizen villain to kill, you should just stop watching this.</br></br>   Their vehicles are current <br> Their weapons are old <br> Supposedly in case they have to be left behind <br><br>In that case, surely it should be the other way round? Their personal arms and armour should be current, but they should be travelling in old shit that they can leave behind?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Join the SDF today and make your dream come true! Enlist now!</br>  <br> female comrades will never look on in disgust at the childish hobbies you still embrace as a grown man. </br>  <br> 105mm <br>The howitzers used there should be type 99 155mm<br>105mm is the type 74 L7 gun caliber</br></br></br>  <br>But they could change that though just for a little more story.</br>  there's nothing there anymore, what are JGSDF even shooting at? who are they suppressing?  <br>Hm, that sounds mildly interesting, at least</br>  <br>But that does happen, minus the "comrades"</br>  <br>I don't know that feel actually.</br>  <br> digging a trench when you are launching an assault </br>  <br>Then how are they going to get back to the base? Walking?</br>  <br>That one guy in the center of your picture<br><br>There's no kill like overkill</br></br></br>  <br>"The empire played us like a damn fiddle!"</br>  <br> not shooting corpse just to be sure </br>  <br> Stannis Baratheon.jpeg </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cYr<wbr>h5h9acg8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>In the manga the armies actually pointed out that JSDF were digging holes in a mocking manner.<br>Doesn't look like they cared much for trenches even though their world is filled with magic and arrows so long range battles should be even more important.</br></br>  <br>They were pretty far away shooting at targets only occasionally illuminated by flares.<br>Probably just firing until the cease fire order is given.</br></br>  How is this nigga planning to deal with the SDF? Surely he doesn't plan on conventional medieval combat. Or will the SDF do something stupid like spread themselves too thin because of &gt;budget?  <br>Not even the dead can know peace from this patriotism.</br>  <br>Abandoning your vehicles would be last resort, since they constitute your primary means of retreat.<br><br>If you run out of ammo, or it becomes inoperable, you can abandon your gun without much consequence. If you're fleeing for your life, it's desirable to abandon the dead weight even though it might be fixable if you carried it back with you.</br></br></br>  <br>They are suppressing the darkness.</br>  <br>yes<br><br>perfect</br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>watch helplessly.</br>  <br>Diplomacy through her daughter, Alnus was the last real battle fought between JSDF and the Empire</br>  Holy shit just send some guys there under flag of truce to "establish a dialogue" and find out more about them then. Once they come home with their report then you'll know more.  <br>Not-Saddam thinks he'll block their advance by scorching all of the earth between the gate and the city, thus preventing them from resupplying on the march and forcing them to spread their supply line too thin to siege.<br><br>He doesn't realize his enemy moves around using technology he's never, ever heard of. When they demonstrate that the scorched earth tactics don't really have any affect, he bends over backwards for the JSDF and sues for diplomacy.</br></br></br>  <br>They can drive the old shit back.<br><br><br>But in an emergency at the base, you are not going to spend time collecting vehicles if you need to retreat back through the gate, you're going to haul your ass outta there with just your gun and helmet. Surely your personal protection is far more important than some vehicle you sign out of a pool.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic was shit before modern science (high elves excluded) and trench are useless when you can just send dragons who resist arrows.<br>In CQC battles the one with higherground wins. They could use them to slow down cavalry , that is if the land dragons they have can't just jump over them. And they don't seem to know black gold to use to fill trenches with fire to stop cavalry from jumping over it.</br></br>  <br>The nigga probably realized that if the invading forces trully wanted to just have everyone dead, the invading forces would already be in their doorsteps.<br><br>He used the allied nations to attack so that their forces thin like theirs. The JSDF has no choice but to attack only when provoked due to their oaths and shit anyway. And that smug smart bastard took advantage of the powerful yet docile invading forces.</br></br></br>  <br> How is this nigga planning to deal with the SDF? Surely he doesn't plan on conventional medieval combat <br>He doesn't know shit, anon. He has no idea how impossible it is for him to win, he seriously believed that his army has a chance if only they buy more time to train more troops. The lack of instant communication means info get diluted, you find out later that for the majority of the series the Emperor never believed any of the stories that the survivors told him.</br></br>  <br>Why not sending your troops in with shit that is so old they are on the same level as the enemy's equipment, so you can call yourself a fair guy?</br>  <br>You don't stop shooting because you think there are no enemies left. That's retarded and can get your men killed.<br><br>You shoot until your commanders think that there can't be any enemies left. You don't want one arrow to somehow hit someone in the neck due to a strong arm or magic just because you stopped shooting.</br></br></br>  <br>This. He wants to keep his control over the other nations so he used them as sacrifices while not sending even one of his soldiers after he noticied he would not be able to win and that they arent conquering them.</br>  <br>They weren't concerned about retreating back through the gate.<br><br>Only the deep recon teams were given dated equipment, and only because they knew nothing of the world outside of their encampment and were concerned that they might have to abandon their gear and retreat.<br><br>The 'retreat' being addressed here isn't egress through the gate, but the recon teams fleeing back to the defensive perimeter in the event that they encounter a situation.</br></br></br></br></br>  So how much did they censor this episode?  <br>Although all of that went out the window when Itami and co found Japanese citizens being enslaved by the empire.</br>  <br> The nigga probably realized that if the invading forces trully wanted to just have everyone dead, the invading forces would already be in their doorsteps. <br>This too. The Empire basically mistaken Japan's reluctance to invade as a sign of weakness. And this means for far too long they still thought they had a chance.</br></br>  <br> How is this nigga planning to deal with the SDF? Surely he doesn't plan on conventional medieval combat <br>Did you miss the bit where he said he'd poison all the wells and take all the livestock so that the army will have no resupply on their way to the capital? Even people from other planets have to eat food, right?<br><br>Unfortunately for him he's never heard of supply trucks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Was the first also censored in a way?<br><br>Man I need to know now so I don't download the Horriblesubs version again. What's the alternative that uses an uncensored version?</br></br></br>  <br>I really enjoyed the scene when the dragon's head is placed at the empire's capital as a result. That one gesture was more powerful than even taking out the senate.</br>  <br> Holy shit just send some guys there under flag of truce to "establish a dialogue" and find out more about them then. Once they come home with their report then you'll know more. <br>The Empire didn't believe they need to. They were the sole superpower for too long.</br></br>  <br>The Blurays you will be able to buy in 6 months.</br>  <br>Oooooh that's fucking smart. That's why he's a conqueror afterall.<br><br>So he has not heard of 2 years expiration date canned goods.</br></br></br>  <br>They also explained that why would they bring their next century scifi shit if they have no satellites to back them up. Everyone watches this with eyes closed or what?</br>  WHY THE FUCK HAVEN'T THEY FIXED THE TRANSLATION OF ITAMI'S RANK YET  <br>They are like 5 meters from the gate. Resupplies aren't a problem.</br>  <br>This makes more sense, but I still think that personal protection gear should have been current if they valued their soldiers, the army isn't so cheap to not be able to replace a dozen rifles and body armour.</br>  <br> 2 years <br>ayyyy</br></br>  <br>You can watch the raw in HQ and see the subbed version in mp4.</br>  <br>Here's a better idea. The ones on Arnus Hill send an envoy to tell the empire what exactly they're up against. A simple advanced reconnaissance force with enough firepower to wipe out a 75,000 man army in less than a day. And they aren't even the full force of their military and they aren't even the most powerful military from their world. Then tell them about nukes and the ability to wipe out a city in the blink of an eye. <br><br>See if the Empire is still willing to fight after that.</br></br></br>  <br>That fucking nationalistic boner was amazing for me.<br><br>Comparing the nation to a griffon that's had her young taken from her was great. Although it's probably unlikely this would happen in reality. I was expecting Itami and co to overreact, but when glasses also got serious/angry it became kinda unrealistic.</br></br></br>  <br>Humans have had ways of preserving food for thousands of years besides canning them, are you an idiot?</br>  <br>I love how fucking mad everyone is in GATE threads<br>Just a beer-drinking manga reader along for the ride, man</br></br>  <br>What is it meant to be?</br>  This seems interesting.<br>Please tell me it won't become elf harem shit.</br>  <br>Just like Japan itself was so eager to capitulate when they were told of nukes.</br>  <br> beer <br>wasted dub quad</br></br>  <br>No my intellectually bankrupt anon. He meant the distance between the gate and the main Capital.<br><br>To ensure that you actually reach the far place you still need to eat and drink. If everything between the Arnus Hill and Capital is burned and poisoned (no food and water) then assuming a 2 month journey on horse to the GATE then it would be fucking impossible to reach the capital.<br><br>But alas modern technology can both purify water from pee and have canned goods that last 2 years without rotting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was hoping for more /k/omfy threads, but I guess this show attracted the shitposters this season.</br>  <br> Please tell me it won't become elf harem shit. <br>If it did it would have already become one by now. Don't drop it just yet anon.</br></br>  <br>One rank above 2nd Lt.</br>  ROMUM ITE DOMUM  <br>He was second lieutenant promoted to first lieutenant after the Ginza incident.</br>  <br>Yes. That anon is an idiot. Always assume that anon are buffoons so that you don't drown yourself in disappointment. <br><br>This guy obviously doesn't know about marination, pickling, deep-frying, smoked and barreling.</br></br></br>  <br> . The ones on Arnus Hill send an envoy to tell the empire what exactly they're up against. <br>Over and over again, the Emperor were told what he is up against. He doesn't believe it. He still doesn't believe it when a gigantic decapitated dragon head appeared one night without anyone noticing on their castle walls.<br><br>Quite simply, the tech gap is so huge that there is no way words or letters could be convincing. It is too unbelievable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon....2 elfs, emperor daughter, a sorceress, a demigod and few random monster girls looking for a quick fuck</br>  <br>Remember that somewhere along the line the goal changed from bringing the Ginza perps to justice to finding oil and resources.</br>  <br>Ok so ONE demonstration for a nuke may be in order. No one would be willing to fight after that.</br>  <br>What you don't remember the glorious Total Eclipse subs?</br>  <br>What exactly was censored in the first episode to prompt you to even ask this?</br>  <br>The only thing I remember about those was calling Yuuya an Ensign even though he's Army not Navy.</br>  <br> when glasses also got serious/angry it became kinda unrealistic. <br>Yeah, any real diplomat would have dismissed her as inconsequential and focused on "the bigger picture". You can almost feel their annoyance of Itami's petty morals if this had happened with a real state department official.</br></br>  <br>You talk like a true american.</br>  <br>They weren't given old equipment because they were less valued or because it was too expensive.<br><br>They simply didn't want weapons or equipment falling into enemy hands. If the worst should happen and gear must be abandoned, it's better that it be inferior equipment so that the enemy isn't turning sniper rifles and LMGs back on the JSDF's position after a few months of training guerrillas.<br><br>Unintentionally leaving equipment your enemy can turn against them is probably the biggest threat to the JSDF, since the actual empire has little to no means of attack outside of whatever they can scavenge from the JSDF.<br><br>The recon force is armed for their own protection, but they aren't being sent out to search and destroy. They would be expected to avoid direct combat where possible and not carry out combat operations on their own, so they don't need 'the big guns'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what? Eating Jam? Eating Pickles? And eating salted fish? Is that even enough calories and nutrients to last you? Not to mention you need purewater, the dude wanted to poison all water resources from the gate to the castle. Water purifiers aren't a thing back then I would imagine.<br><br>The weather is hot/summer as we are shown at the show for now. And since it's a new big world, one can assume that the gate is extremely far from the capital, enough that your supply will rot unless you have some kind of magic/tech.</br></br></br>  <br>they're just going from series to series until someone bites<br><br>last week it was the gangsta threads, next week will be something else.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll keep watching for the setting alone.<br>I just hope it won't become all goofy.<br>i like the serious tone.</br></br></br>  So do they have other magic besides dragons?<br>I assume they do because the villagers aren't treating them as aliens or trying to stone them for witchcraft.</br>  <br> muh flags and muh gore <br>Apparently implications and french flags aren't enough</br></br>  <br>From the manga:<br>Other than one scene where he sleepily lusted over the magician sorcerer, the only semi-romance is between death loli and Itami.</br></br>  <br> Remember that somewhere along the line the goal changed from bringing the Ginza perps to justice to finding oil and resources. <br>Bring to Justice also meant repatriations, i.e. making the Empire pay for damages. Since the Empire can't pay with gold alone resources would have to do. Justice doesn't just mean prison time, it can be money too.</br></br>  <br> I just hope it won't become all goofy. <br>It's like a mix of goofy and serious.</br></br>  <br>Does it make much of a difference? Can you just simply promote someone from NCO to officer? I thought you had to go through some officer school first.</br>  <br>With their lack of knowledge artillery fire has the same effect honestly. Besides the leaders don't give a fuck unless they are at their doorstep.</br>  <br> Japan  <br> in charge of learning other languages <br>This is probably broken engrish tier.</br></br></br>   Right now, Meikon! Meikon!    they poison the wells using elves <br>Elves are confirmed for being AIDS-ridden cumwhores only used for public meat toilets.</br>  <br>It can't be that hard to hash out something that means "WALK HERE, ASS BURNS"</br>  <br> So do they have other magic besides dragons? <br>Magic is too hard and even Roman technology had surpassed battle mages. So basically magic is stagnating because it is hard to scale up.</br></br>  <br>You are a complete imbecile. It was not the nukes, but the Soviet conquest of Manchuria that Japan was truly sweating about. I shouldn't be responsible for your education, but please do others' sanity a favor and look into the deadlock of the Imperial Council for god's sake.</br>  What kinda outdated tanks are these  <br> sleepily lusted <br><br>More like "sleepily treated her like his daughter."</br></br></br>  <br>He was already an officer.<br><br><br>Itami didn't lust over Lelei.<br><br><br>Mind control.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whiskey if I feel like regularly drinking above my means<br><br><br>Going by how these threads always ended up even before the anime, there's just no way that would have happened. Giving these people some semblance of factual evidence to argue with really brings out the crusader in them</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's gone and graduated from officer school among other advanced training<br>.<br>People will get anal over anything that's incongruous with what they know.</br></br></br>  <br> get close enough to actually land a hit <br> start digging trenches instead </br></br>  <br>Nah, I already read a book written by a former japanese soldier who was captured after the nukes and was part of the still resisting military forces. Retard.</br>  <br>Type 74 from mitsubishi. I'm waiting for the cute Type 10.</br>  <br>Japan doesn't have the money or military industrial complex to make their own like the US or Isreal and they don't have the funding to buy Germany's latest and greatest like the rest of us so they stick with rotting, outdated 60's tanks they periodically retrofit with new electronics and equipment.</br>  Piña and Bozes corrupted by yaoi doujinshi when?  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_<wbr>74</wbr></br>  <br>http://ackuna.com/badtranslator<br>Original text:<br><br>"Keep Out For safety reasons, this area is not to be entered.

Japanese tanks are easily on par with the rest of the world; it's their air force that uses most of the outdated shit.</br>  <br>Seems so.</br>  <br> Humans have had ways of preserving food for thousands of years <br><br>Yea salted meat and dried bread/biscuits were always around. The problem was that armies were never able to transport a sufficient amount of food with them as they marched through occupied territory. They always had to forage or plunder to maintain their food stores. Logistics before the mid 20th century could not keep up.<br><br>Napoleon's army was defeated by scorched earth and winter. His soldiers ate their horses and then knawed on boiled leather out of desperation. They turned into what was described as an army of scarecrows, and this was as recent as 1812.<br><br>Germans in WW2 ran into a similar fate even with supply trucks and over 1 million horses hauling supplies. Scorched earth and winter are a deadly combination. They did not suffer as badly as Napolean did, but it still took an enormous toll on a modern army.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> harem of fujos <br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Just the usual blood and gore.

Alcohol's a sterilized source of water, and the real issue isn't so much having insufficient cured meat, but scurvy really. <br><br>Running long supply line is difficult for any army to manage. That emperor did what he could to make things difficult as the attacking army couldn't forage for food this way.

They also had casked water. If the only thing you drank was rum you'd die.</br>  <br>Elevens were more afraid of soviets dethroning and executing the imperial family than they were of the american nukes.</br>   Israel is the only other militarily advanced country besides Japan to call its army a "self-defense force"    many nations anticipate Japan's defeat <br> when the fucking riot police were able to put down large numbers of enemy soldiers after their morale was broken <br>How?</br></br>  <br>JSDF is too kawai for you.</br>  <br> fucker <br>What a funny choice of words, little rapebait.</br></br>  <br> That pic <br>Doing /ak/ some pride anon.</br></br>  <br>Probably half the planet calls their army defense force. Even the fucking nazis.</br>  <br> fucking dragons. <br> not thinking some bullshit magic on the other side could destroy them </br></br>  This show has been bretty gud so far, i liked how it's more about politics and overall strategy than romans getting rekt by nips  <br> &gt;many nations anticipate Japan's defeat <br> &gt;when the fucking riot police were able to put down large numbers of enemy soldiers after their morale was broken <br> How? <br>Because many rally think the Japanese are inferior just because they lost their last war? Like a lot of trolls said before the anime started?</br></br></br></br>  <br>More national pride propoganda where Japan is underestimated by foreign nations.</br>  <br>One of them isn't part of Itami's harem.</br>  <br>Hirohito got a pretty fucking good deal from McArthur<br><br>Wonder what it would be like if the americans had used the occupation to depose and destroy the imperial institution in Japan...</br></br></br>  <br>At night, just like in WWI.<br><br>It took a few weeks and a few thousand men just to dig down a couple feet though.</br></br></br>  <br> the soldiers not wearing thick bushes for maximum camo </br>  <br>Because modern japs are NEET's who hump anime pillows, or hang themselves after failing a test.</br>  <br>US has the Department of "Defense" and the National "Guard".</br>  <br>Hmmmmm so it's still about nutrition? Since pickled stuff and such will deteriorate the Nutritional content of the food causing scurvy from lack of Vitamin C. Unlike MREs where it is intentionally designed to be sterile and nutritious(relatively).<br><br>About the alcohol though you will need tons and tons of those in store to traverse say a 1000km journey. Unlike if you just have a water purifier device.<br><br>Both logistics and under-tech haults a marching army it seems.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Because Isreal, much like Japan, is a nation that was created by and exists under the auspices of its allies and benefactors. There are a lot of international treaties limiting what Isreal is allowed to do with its military because, if they were given a free hand they'd be marching through all of Anatolia burning and killing as they went. Isreal was formed knowing full well that its eventual leaders would champion manifest destiny harder than the Nazis and their military has various restrictions placed on it to help prevent them doing any more harm than they already do, restrictions that are regularly violated and then handwaved because Papa USA aproves.</br>  <br>i don't care if she may become a fujoshi, look that ass.</br>  <br>Japan doesn't technically have a full military. It's written into their constitution as a condition of their surrender in 1945.</br>  <br>The very fact that you lack the faculty to construct a properly formed sentence gives little credence that you could cite any proper source on the subject matter. Foreign Policy's paper, the analysis done by The Asia-Pacific Journal and Institute of Historical Review all pointed to how that Togo did not change his mind even after the report by Dr. Nishina was made (on the atomic bomb damage) until it was clear that USSR had declared war and invaded Manchuria. <br><br>You asinine baffoon.</br></br></br>  <br> acting intelligent on the internet <br> acting intelligent on 4chan even </br></br>  What are Pina's knights good for? Do they actually do anything or do they just escort Pina and look regal?  <br><br><br>Let me rephrase<br><br> the only other militarily advanced country besides japan that constitutionally defines its army as a "domestic self defense force" (a definition corroborated by the terms of their status as signatory parties to the first 2 protocols of the geneva convention) is israel <br><br> inb4 SHUT IT DOWN </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>In reality that's probably would happen. Those security treaties are serious shit, and the US would not dismiss the opportunity to take a leading role. Gitmo full of terrorist bunny girls when?</br></br></br>  <br>They are good at bullying.</br>  <br>Not even jumping into the fact that A9 can be rewritten, the definiton of a military is as follows:<br><br> mil·i·tar·y <br> ˈmiləˌterē/ <br> adjective: military <br> 1. of, relating to, or characteristic of soldiers or armed forces. "both leaders condemned the buildup of military activity" <br> synonyms: fighting, service, army, armed, defense, martial <br> "military activity" <br> antonyms: civilian <br> noun: military; plural noun: militaries <br> 1. the armed forces of a country.

That's part of why Japan has historically been a major contributor to UN peacekeeping operation. Committing their resources to the UN banner is the only means they have of throwing their weight around.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Romanes eunt domus</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127888040 <br>It's also closer to the original light novel design.<br><br>People that complain are just manga secondaries anyway</br></br></br>  <br>Why did they even change short stack into Idolm@ster?

They are strictly defensive. I'm not sure if that implies that they cannot have certain equipment, at least publicly.</br>  <br>Since they are all high school dropouts and the most expendible demographic before people working in factories, yes.</br>  <br> "Many nations" <br>Read it as China and Korea.<br>It's a kind of slang for japanese /pol/ shit.<br><br>When a chinese and korean criticizes japan they says all the asia is against them but in the reality, there are just them.<br>Other nations does not give a fuck or just like japan.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Did they honestly never think GEE THIS PORTAL MAY HOLD SOMETHING STRONGER THAN US? <br>It took a while.

(Hasegawa frigging cute when jealous. Two girls askes Basara to picture of them and then praised how good Basara was at taking photos, Basara got in good mood because his dad is a photographer but seeing that Hasegawa wrote to his back with her finger "cheater" and "stupid" and was close to crying)<br>-It appears Hasegawa reserved the whole damn inn for just the two of them. Of course they bathed together and of course it didn't end in just bathing or wayching scenery.<br>-Stuff happened and Hasegawa wants to make a contract with Basara so he could use her powers.<br>-Hasegawa copied the contract that was inside Basara and beared the slavery curse so it would be easier for Basara to make her his own<br>-Hasegawa makes barrier where time flows 1/1000 slower. Apparently it's hard as hell to make contract with gods. Normally it'd take many generations<br>-Basara and Hasegawa had fun for a whole year inside the barrier, Basara usin succubus adult-toy-drug duplicating into 6 Basaras and having them all play with Hasegawa, etc.<br>-Then Basara finally lost his cool and tries have real sex with Hasegawa. (By this time, she was all over Basara already and had no reason to reject) It was then when Basara found Hasegawa's weak point by chance. It was her insides.

Hero, Demon and Angel?  <br>-Basara has two moms. The little sister of the former Demon King (Mio and Maria's dad) and one of the 10 Gods of heaven. The demon sister got pregnant first but she couldn't give birth to a child of a hero so they used trick to move Basara inside angel mom so angel mom could give birth to Basara in heaven. The angel mom and Hasegawa appeared to be cousins, so you could say Hasegawa and Basara share blood as well. The gods didn't like it so they ripped angel mom of her powers and threw her to some eternal dungeon. It was Hasegawa who brought Basara from heaven back to Jin and continued to watch Basara for 15 years after that</br>  <br>Praise the banana demon.</br>    <br>So let me get this straight:<br>His totally-not-blood-related adoptive sister who he's been almost-fucking this whole time, turns out to have been blood related all along?<br>Bravo.</br></br></br>  Shovels are the best!  <br>I wanna fuck this fucking shovel</br>  Everything is fine !

I just don't see "plenty to discuss", instead of the same procedure ever and ever.</br></br></br>  <br><br> YuYuYu  <br> Good discussion <br><br>I was there.

Did a mahou shoujo eat your teacher and gave you PTSD?<br><br>But yeah, unfortunately it's only circlejerking yurifags now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just watch the episode until the end and you'll understand.</br>  <br>I did see those, and a flood of speculah certainly flooded when the Sange mechanic was revealed.</br>  <br>The only good dog is a dead dog.  Sorry if you love dogs, I can't help it because I was attacked by a German Shepherd when I was little. Now I classify dogs into two groups: one kick kill, and others. </br>  <br><br>It was certainly present, but most of the discussion that spawned from the translations was healingfags in increasingly desperate denials, and sufferingfags shitposting. We would generally have an immediate thread where speculah and shitposting were equal, and then the shitposting went into overdrive in the next couple until the next episode.<br><br>That said, once the disabilities were revealed to be permenant, it calmed down a bit. Though evey 4 posts was still either "&gt;healingfags btfo" or "I want to touch Togo's Togos."</br></br></br></br>  <br>We'd still get constant threads that want to talk about it though.<br>I was just giving generals as an example, pls stop.<br><br><br>Okay guys I understand.

I can't remember everything anymore. guess I'll read the manga a again.<br><br>though the story would benefit from it, I think</br></br></br></br>  Am I the only one who finds the character design stupid?<br><br>Not the characters itself, but the clothes. They have too much detail to pass of as school uniforms and it looks like mangaka tried to make them unique but just put too much stuff. Like, how many different fucking hats and gloves and other accessories can one character have without looking retarded?</br></br>  <br>Shovel dies July 9th next year, not a coincidence.</br>  <br>It's appropriate for Yuki to look retarded.</br>  Anyone know where I can find the raws for the manga? I'm having some difficulty finding them.  <br>Only chink and gook, which poison do you prefer?</br>  Just woke up. Did that one anon ever translate 36?

After that they become really prominent. Either you don't remember the past well or just enjoy shitposting.<br><br> Says the person who can't capitalize their sentences. <br>can't be bothered to use the proper style for some faggot who just shitposts and tries to make the new-/a/ in a better light.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck can there be gook but not Japanese raws?</br>  <br>Sure is, I seriously hope she is not going to die or become undead rather.</br>  <br>If you have the uncensored version of that image, can you please post it on /h/ and link it here? <br><br>IQDB yields no results and Google Images only yields thumbnail-sized images and images with text over her breasts.</br></br></br>  Seriously, what gives?  Where's Miki-kun and Taroumaru?   <br>Most living beings don't possess the mental capacity to understand the concept of perpetuating their species and many will fight and kill other members of their species for various reasons.</br>    When was the last time they had a bath?  <br> I want her to be indeed the imouto so that everyone will enjoy getting tricked again </br>  <br>Don't forget the two hair ornaments that look like teddy bear ears.</br>  <br>Keep reading</br>  How the fuck did fnord mishear "bu" as "un"?    <br>Nobody uses -bu alone, though.</br>  <br>It's probably a meme.<br>Well, he normally hides phrases he is unabe to translate behind meme's and Hitler jokes.</br></br>  <br>Read her lips https://<span>youtu.be/mW-JAiZcGbU?t=51  [ ]</br>  No time to explain, I need all your ahegaos.<br>Post'em</br>  <br>Tell that to feminists. You'll blow their fucking minds.</br>  <br>Well its only a minor downside living in canada. This place is still awesome compared to the people below us.<br><br>Yeah its sucks though. Just put your loli stuff (if you actually download them) in a password protected zip or folder. So no one accidently sees it. Its only illegal if you actually have the files on your computer. Not if you view them on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>On the other hand, I think you are overestimating it.<br>Women have always come second because that's what felt natural for us humans to do. If we were, say, spiders it would've been the other way around and the situation would be the same.<br>Social conditioning does warp your personality, but if anything, people are more open-minded now than the're ever been in history. Still, no one is satisfied because it's impossible to be satisfied, there literally NO solution for a society that only values the "things that only humans posses that make you feel better and smarter than other animals".<br>Wanting to dominate over women is what comes natural to men, and we're already warped our society around so that's ALMOST not the case anymore.<br><br>My main point is this: right now, men are just as unsatisfied as women are. There many laws and ethics that prefer one over the other, in an overall quite balanced way. But balance is not what comes natural for people. People need to feel like they have a role in society. That's why they're unhappy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My bad that was the RAW one.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Seriously it's not like the cowgirl position is some sort of long lost arcana from the first editions of the kama-sutra.<br><br>But really, there is a time and place to discuss real sexuality. This, is an image thread about ahegaos, damnit.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are there of any examples of good robot/android waifus in anime?<br>Not just normal girl with a USB port in her neck, but an actual machine that is sofisticated enough to be sentient.</br>  <br>Eve no Jikan?</br>  <br>That looks neat anon, I´ma check it out.</br>  Nice rec thread. Now check em  <br>Does not compute</br>  <br/>  The automatons in Horizon. <br>And take off your name you massive faggot.</br>  Doesn't really fit your recommendation, but Video Girl Ai fits somewhat, vaguely. Can be watched in an evening so you don't really waste a lot of time if you don't like it. Just a warning, the first episode or two are pretty generic, but it gets really much better later. <br>And another warning, it isn't really robot.</br>  <br>Could you be more specific? The name horizon gives me multiple results.</br>  <br>Is it an AI? Or just a human?</br>  <br>Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon.<br>just-believe.in</br></br>  <br>It's an artificial human that has been "programmed" to do a specific thing, but due to circumstances she starts to deviate from the script a bit. You will see some of the struggles intelligent androids go through when they have personality, but it's not a robot, so you'll not see machine parts or computers.</br>  Best girl  <br>That shit seems whack, I'll still give it try though.</br>  <br>I'm all about that shit. But no mechanical parts is still a loss in my book.</br>  <br>Mahoromatic, obviously. Mahoro is the ultimate robo-waifu.</br>  Danbo is a pretty cool robot.<br> Sleek cardboard chassis <br> Uses currency as a fuel source <br> Can fly </br></br></br>  Did Gil successfully break the final layer of Rho Aias or did Shirou not manifest it properly?  <br><br>Shirou can't use Rho Aias at the same extent Archer could, so it was a lot weaker and didn't have as many layers.<br><br>Still find it stupid Gil didn't just break UBW with Ea like he did with Iskander in Zero, but the arrogance was strong.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He didn't respect Shirou like he did Iskander, he wanted to defeat Shirou in his own RM without trump card because muh hubris</br></br>  Ajax's shield has 7 layers of leather and one layer of brass. <br><br>Archer can only create a 6 layered gimped version of the shield and he isn't even known to be a good shield maker so the 6 layers should be weaker than the original because dirty faker. Plus, the strongest part, which actually stopped the spear of Hector, is the 7th layer, the metalic one. <br><br>Shirou can only create 4 layers if I am not mistaken and probably each layer is even weaker than Archer's. <br><br>Great Ajax servant when?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can someone explain why can they create stuff like shields?<br><br>I mean I get knifes but how does he create a shield when it's not a Sword?</br></br></br>  <br>Gil can't penetrate plot armor.</br>  <br> mad Gilfag being mad <br>What a surprise, king of jobbers</br></br>  <br>Great Order Shielder is rumored as Ajax but we'll have to wait for a confirmation on that<br><br><br>Rho Aias -&gt; Manifests as a shield of flower petals -&gt; Flower petals have edges -&gt; Eh, sounds sword enough for me</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is, if he wasn't he would not lose to the mc to make him look good.</br>  <br><br>Rho Aias is a shield made out of the petals of a flower.<br><br>The petals of a flower are sometimes referred to as 'blades' in poetry and Japanese culture. <br><br>When he traces Rho Aias, he's actually tracing seven swords that act as shields.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer creates 7 layers you fucking retard.<br> Also UBW Shirou in the VN also does 7 levels while he does 5 or 6 layers in the anime </br></br>  <br>He creates a shield made of swords, just like how he can heal injuries with tiny swords in his body.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TuL<wbr>YXvjiqNk</wbr>  [ ]<br>Look at 0:33 where he is doing the UBW chant, he wasn't able to project the full 7 petal version.</br></br>  <br><br>Gil lost because he hesitated taking Ea. I appreciate that for once, Plot armor isn't the MC tanking fatal hits for five minutes, then getting declared the victor by plot. Gil dies by his own flaws and Shirou, a weaker or equal opponent wins a fight that for all rights he should have lost.</br></br>  <br> wins a fight that for all rights he should have lost. <br>Yeah and Sauron should have easily killed Isildur.<br>What's your point?</br></br></br>  <br><br>My point is there was a reason, it wasn't "I've got more spirit", It wasn't "I've got friends", It even wasn't "Episode's done in 6 minutes, wrap this up.<br><br>It was exploiting a crucial character mistake. You can see the moment Gil loses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate/Grand Order's Shielder is speculated to be Ajax. Since she was supposed to be one of the heroines in F/SN, some assume she did appear in Archer's route and that's how he traced Aias.<br><br>Both even appeared on the commercial for Grand Order in the city on fire.</br></br></br>    why is shirou so shit bros  how can Shirou create Aias in anime UBW (I know how in VN but in anime is nonsense)  <br>He saw it in Archer's UBW</br>  <br>Yep, being a skinny looking teenager actually worked on his favour.</br>  That was't Rho Aias. That was Shirou's insane amounts of plot armor manifesting itself into the actual show.    <br>The explanation I remember was Archer Emiya encounters the shield in his lifetime and is able to study it close enough to replicate it at will.<br><br>Basically bullshit to give him at least one defensive weapon that trumps yet another bullshit NP.</br></br></br>  <br> Basically bullshit to give him at least one defensive weapon that trumps yet another bullshit NP. <br>But Gae Bolg trumps Rho Aias.</br></br>  <br> superior version of excalibur <br> still lost to saxxons <br>Shittier king than seiba</br></br></br>  <br> But Gae Bolg trumps Rho Aias. <br>That's debatable in CCC it blocked it with no problem. Also, do not forget about the real deal.</br></br>  <br> CCC <br> Extra <br>Dude just stop<br><br>You are just arguing with fucking game mechanics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> game mechanics <br> forgetting that every Holy grail war has a set of game mechanics  <br>The mooncell is a Holy war on drugs that can boost a servant's powers and skills. that is why EMIYA can project Excalibur.</br></br></br>  <br>CCC and Extra fags should stick to their shitty game instead of mixing universes as they see fit same with Prismafags.</br>  <br>Wrong. <br><br>UBW Shirou can create a seven-layered Rho Aias just as Archer could, and succeeds in doing so. The reason it ultimately breaks is because it wasn't made to defend against an endless barrage of Noble Phantasms. <br><br>The four layer Rho Aias only shows up in Heaven's Feel and Fate/hollow ataraxia. In UBW, it's seven-layered as it should be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> CCC and Extra <br>Um, Nasu helped create them both and droved a little bit deeper to Gil's and EMIYA's past.</br></br>  <br>Archer can project Excalibur, albeit shittier than CCC. Shirou can trace it in HF.</br>  <br>At that point isn't wasn't even Excalibur just a darken sword that lost it's Holy status like Arondight.</br>  <br>So what? That doesn't mean the same mechanics apply to both the same way. The only thing people can derive from that game is EMIYA's past because Nasu stated they were the same.</br>  <br> Why do people keep spreading this misinformation? A holy sword is still a holy sword even if it's blackened. The strongest holy sword is still the strongest holy sword no matter what. It's written on the weapons page in the game for crying out loud.</br>  <br> That doesn't mean the same mechanics apply to both the same way. <br>Yes it does.</br></br>  <br> game mechanics <br>This bullshit again. <br>Did you even play the game? they explicitly animated the moment GB is blocked just to make it clear for faggots like you that yes, what you're seeing is legit.<br>So, your argument is [pic related]</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If this is the future of this shit threads I don't want to be in here. There was already a fag assuming prisma shit mattered.<br><br>There's no salvation for this threads anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then leave. No one's forcing you to say lmao.</br>  <br>Prisma wasn't written by Nasu, unlike CCC. You're grasping at straws there, Shitposter-kun.<br>Do us a favor and leave already if the thread is shit to you.</br></br>  <br>You are the retard who actualy thinks that Rho Aias wins against Gae Bolg</br>  <br>Just go already, this is starting to get sad.</br>  <br>Just to clarify, Archer didn't die when getting the anti army version of Gae Bolg. <br>A shield that keeps the user alive is a good shield.</br></br>  <br>accept it, you were aching to use that pic.</br>  <br>But that's just the anime. The VN is different.</br>  <br>You sure took a while to reply. <br>After all that thinking the best you could come up with is just more bait?<br>Ok, have a pity reply and call it a day.</br></br></br>  <br>OP's pic was from the anime, specifically from the moment Shirou uses Rho Aias inside UBW. <br>In the VN it's never used inside the RM to begin with.</br></br>  <br>I wasn´t the guy you were talking to, calm down your autism.</br>  <br>The Real  Cuck </br>  Why is Fate/Kaleid GOB more efficient than FSN GOB ?<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/QguRwhx.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/Dhtl9Vb.jpg</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Shirou has never been limited to swords for fuck's sake.<br>Non-sword weapons, shields, and armor are all within his grasp. It just is more expensive magical-energy-wise and sometimes implied to be of lower quality than other projections.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because F/SN Gil is weaker.</br>  So /a/, how do we pronounce this?  ba ke mo no ga ta ri  Monogatari thread?  <br>Baked-monogatari.</br>  <br>I like to localize everything in my head, so I call her Harriet Crabworth</br>  <br>  Monogatari Thread  </br>  <br>cu ra bu shi to</br>  Baked humungous Atari     December 2015 <br> Owarimonogatari last episode ends <br> afterwards a super short trailer <br> Kizumonogatari  <br> May 2015 <br> in cinemas <br><br>And then I go to see it three times in Japan and boast about it on /a/. <br><br>Please look forward to it being true.
