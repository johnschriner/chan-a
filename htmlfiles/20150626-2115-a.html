[ What's going on here? Time for more Yurus!    best yuru    Why does she wear the buns?     yuru yuri is fantastic but i think the threads could use a break since there hasnt been anything new for ages unless theres a new chapter im not aware of      Wannabe general threads should fuck off.    I lacked presence until I put on the buns    Silly anon, we yuru yuri lovers don't do generals   I want to rewatch another episode of this, but I don't know what episode should I watch. What's the best episode you can think of /a/? (Besides the time travel ep, already saw it)   just watch all of them you dingus    b-but my backlog is huge enough as it is.    mine is too, but we have to accept that it'll never get smaller. follow your heart and rewatch stuff if you want to.    Making daily threads about a show with no new content. Could have fooled me /yyg/. You guys are a general in all but name. Kinda sad really.    wake up   see this right in your face   What do?      Stop making generals for a series without currently content.   The handful of regulars that bump this thread just to keep it alive should create a channel for the discussion and have a little more respect for the board. http://www.rizon.net/        without currently content   The manga is ongoing, dumbass. Get your facts straight before you embarrass yourself next time.       He's saying that no new (translated) chapter was released. OP should at least attempt to start a discussion, not a general.  I don't get how this is so hard to follow. It's like post-S2 again.     Yeah, I mean, come on. There's two OVAs coming before the new season. At least make it related.  And there's this, that's using the anime designs, which is cute. Feels like forever since any news, though.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155363  Sounds like you're the one bitching instead.  Also, mods haven't deleted these generals because they've been tolerating them, not because they're quality threads. You'd know this if you weren't such an oldfag simply because you joined after the OVA.     Jesus tapdancing Christ, this is why we can't have nice things. I come here to get a laugh, not listen to you asshats bitch about proper posting etiquette.    Honestly? If you bitch about something, some other idiot is going to bitch back at you. I'm not going to pick a side, but don't try to be coy about it. And don't try to act like YrYr's threads are the only "Generals" up in /a/ right now either.      We could have had a pleasant thread, OP. We could have had nice things. But you chose not to post any Yurus in your image.   Now Kyouko is crying. I hope you're all happy. ;_;       If you don't want people to bitch, start by not creating shit threads.   Quality thread, gentlemen.     one of the cutest    Part of me wants to believe that this is just a cute Chitose cover, and not some nefarious subliminal shiptease. But I know better.     The manga is ongoing, dumbass  So make a thread when a new chapter is actually released. It isn't hard. These generals aren't discussing anything about the show anymore.    If you don't like how the site is supposed to function, find an IRC where you and the other ten regulars can ERP together.         And don't try to act like YrYr's threads are the only "Generals" up in /a/ right now either.  It isn't. That doesn't make it right. If you think those other threads aren't being reported you have another thing coming.   Two wrongs don't make a right.       If you don't like it, fuck off  Wow simple      You can't ignore the truth!    It's literally one-sided. Ayano doesn't even think of gran-chan that way.    When she loses the Kyoukobowl, she'll stop being so blind Just like how China will finally admit her love for Akari when she loses the Yuibowl    I want to hug Yui!   Welcome back!    Thanks! I love you anon-chan!    Whose birthday it is?    Well, recently it was Namori's, before that Nana's, and Himawari's. Maybe that anon can't read.     I know I know, I just like Sakurako on this pic.      I like Sakurako in all pics. Except for the ones that delve into weird fetish material.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127163471    K     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127163471  See you later.    Why is sakurako the best yuru?    Vampiric hypnosis   Which one would you?   neither. i'm into older women but not THAT old      both       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155046     ok I think the ass blasters are gone so now lets enjoy our Yurus our way        Ok, Kyouko wins a all paid vacation to anywhere she wants. However, she can only bring two friends.Who does she bring? and where does she go?   Ayano and Yui.   Anywhere, I don't care.       Quads must tell the truth     Who does she bring? and where does she go?   Easy. Chinatsu and Yui, Akari will join them regardless, because Akarin.  She would probably go somewhere really close, but take several trains and buses to get there.         From the catalog I thought this was a pregnancy checker    Obviously she brings Ayano and Yui.  She likes attention so would want to keep her dominant harem members close at hand.  She takes them somewhere that Ayano likes to make puns about, so that Yui can be cutely cracking up the whole time.        You think Himawari finally got knocked up by Sakurako? Her breasts have been looking unusually big...    She brings Kyouko and Kyouko, and goes to Comiket.    mom's spaghetti   If the yurus were in a band, who would play what instrument?   Akari would play  triangle.     Probably    what else would she play?      Kyouko: Guitar Yui: Bass Chinatsu: Costume design (she's aiming for cute, winds up with death metal) Akari: Triangle Ayano: Manager Chitose: Piano Brat: Drums Boob-chan: Shy lead singer           I could see it   Found this in my old screenshots today, Himawari sure has a big bush.     what the fuck      Indeed she is.    Because she can drink cocoa like an elegant adult        Drink Cocoa   Lewd.       My kisekae yurus were better, and edgier.     I bet they weren't.     Chizuru a cute. For some reason, Chitose a not so cute.  I think it's the eyes.      page 9  Chinaslug will slide us back to page 1     C-Chinafrog could have got us there faster. J-Just saying.     <br/>    Chitose is already cute, but Chizuru is extra cute because of gap moe.      not recognizing China Sue as uniquely beautiful    Don't judge a book by its cover, Anons.       best doujin  I was prepared for despair I really prepared myself for a sad as fuck ending   I was pleasantly surprised           no u       No words.     Well then guess I have something new to read. Is everything on bakkingamu site? I know they scanlated a few of them   Don't die while I'm sleeping, little thread.   if this thread is still here in the morning I'll be surprised   I want to cum inside tomato pajamas.     I will keep it up just for you anon. Sleep tight     I'm surprised there aren't more doujins about Chitose. She has a lot to work with. Chizuru is better, though.      Why is Kyouko so artistically gifted?   Autistically*     She probably has ADHD, but I doubt she's autistic.     How can a person even be autistically gifted?    Very easily amused.    Oh cmon even I would want that shirt    I guess we're all autistically gifted.      that fucking shirt   Damn Namori for making me love Kyouko more and more every time I see her. ;_;      Hey Yurus, just letting you know if you haven't seen it yet I've started a yuru yuri kik group (#yuruyruilove), anyone is welcome. and dont ask about an IRC, i dont wanna pay money for a server so yeah   #yuruyurilove, spelled it worng      what the fuck is this shit    but i don't have a phone. why are you excluding me?    Over 20lbs of pussy and ass    I am so confused and aroused rn    You wouldn't this snail.    I would.    I want to drink her  t e a      I would China her Chu.     How lewd.    no no no no no no    i already said why, im not gonna pay for a server      We're always here anon. We're here to remind you that you are deluded with your shitty thread that you bump with image spam. There is no need for you guys to keep a constant general up for your show.    last thread lasted 5 days, I think we will be safe, ayano-chan      not fair! i want to talk to people too!     does anyone have more pics of Akari from the manga?   she's even obfuscated by her own weapons. poor akarin. ;_;    You're better just setting up a room in something like raidcall or something        <br/>       BAM!  Thinking about oppai   Thingken*   Wait, why do you guys think IRC channels cost money???   I would totally play a shump game of akarin and her buns as weapons. Kinda got the vibe from that image.    millennials   What is Akari dreaming about?   just finished reading yuru zero. Other than Archer being way off character it was pretty good      She's dreaming of being popular with the girls.   Little does she know she's already very popular with the little girls on /a/.       needing to poop and no bathrooms nearby   Who are you going to main /a/?   Anyone not maining panda is a faggot.    why Dante?        just woke up   thread is still alive      I'll stick with my main girl Himawari. She's an underdog.   It's been "updated" unnecessarily.       You're welcome. Now it's my turn to sleep.  I'm counting on you!       Thanks! I'll do my best!    Reading through it for the first time at the moment and making crops as I go. Got about 120 images so far with about 30 being Akari. Will post them all as an imgur album or something when I'm done.    It's an SMT: Nocturne joke. And now I'm imagining the yurus as SMT demons. Chinamata.      Just skimmed through my smt4 bestiary and no yuru demon look alikes    tfw no demonic yurus with which to drown the world in chaos      When was the last time you cried during an anime?   Watched Diary of Anne Frank again recently that is pretty sad. You know she is a jew.   I cried at the end of pic related  End of SoreMachi.  Plastic Memories tomorrow   only faggots crying     This.     The end of death parade.   Never, I'm too jaded lol   anon, this is /a/, you dont need to lie    Glad im not the only one  An anon told me they cried after finishing Punchline earlier     Had a few moments while watching Ippo Rising. Teared up pretty often while watching Your Lie in April.    I cried at the second half of ep10 too. Something about how jarring the mood changes are helped a lot    Ding. Still not entirely sure if they were happy or sad tears.   At the end of toradora, the time i lost watching that crap is never going to come back  I cry very easily to the point of it being ridiculous. So the last time was today.  I was watching Ore Monogatari.    I kinda teared up during Plastic Memories last week. To be fair, I also thought it was the last episode.  Felt like crying a bit during the Pleiades finale last night too.    I don't cry often but I kinda wish I did, it actually feels good. I don't remember the last anime, it was not this season.   You cry when you see shit?    I want to hug you too, anon. Too much fucking drama     Hah, I need to check this out. Looks like this 'Anne Frank' girl has waifu potential.    What?   I cry intermittently and without warning when watching Aria. Nothing particularly triggers it, the tears just fall out of my face.  It's like an emotional hypobaric chamber, and all my sadness, anger, and frustrations just boil to the surface.      This.    Yesterday  Emotional scenes always make me cry    I don't cried because of the anime itself, I cry because it reminds me of what I don't have.  When finishing Origination yesterday.    This.      btw I'm a girl    Oreimo.  Embarrassing, right?    when the chick in hhh triple ecchi got pregnant and had the baby.  Who /specialsnowflakeedgemasterthatcan'<wbr>tcry/ here?</wbr>  Yesterday to K-On!!'s last episode.  Sae and Hiro graduation OVA  I watered up a little bit while watching Welcome to the NHK, and at the end of Initial D when they had Rage Your Dream playing.   I cried while reading the novels and then while rewatching the anime during episode 14, 15 and 16.      What a fag, if anything you are suppose to laugh.     Shed a few stray tears earlier today when I watched the finale of Houkago no Pleiades. Beautiful series. Mahou Shoujo shows make me cry more frequently than any other genre, not sure why.  I'm a grown man.      S1 was quite funny.    More like grown manchild. A real grown man don't cry.     Oh, OK then. Thanks for correcting me.     I cried a little when Haru was suffering at the end of Free s2     Crying over magical Subaru girls     I've never cried...Probably teary eyed with OP a couple times.   Code Geass had me tearing up near the end. Never flatout cried though.    Yep. I'm glad I didn't dismiss it as a worthless car commercial. It was an excellent show. Worth watching for the astrophysics porn alone.     Not to mention it's last series by Gainax until who-knows-when. Yes, I also shed some tears there.    Where exactly to you guys even draw the line between crying and tearing up?  For me, it's officially crying territory if a tear streams down my face. Even if it's only one and I'm not really sobbing.  I feel like some people define crying as bawling like a baby in a fetal position or something.      I am more prone to crying while watching anime, while i'm stoned. Any other fellows anons, experience the same thing ?   Episode 1 of Ninja Slayer.   The Archer and Rin scene in this last episode. Even my mom teared up and she's a filthy secondary.   I consider it crying even if my eyes just water.    Was it the part with Suna in the hospital?    During the last ep of Gatchaman Crowds. I just wished shit in this world were not as bad as they are and could be solved more easily.      Watching Fate with your mum.  Anon I....       Well yes, but I actually teared up when Yamato got all close to Takeo on the recent episode.   When I rewatched Madoka. That series is one of the few I've seen where it has more emotional impact on a second viewing.   NHK had the same impact on me.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=trr<wbr>oxGoaenI</wbr>  [ ]  which reminds me i have to rewatch the series now.    zankyou no terror bro moments hit home for some reason   When Caesar died in Jojo  I've never cried to anime, but KEY VNs usually do it for me. AIR was so sad I almost felt physically hurt, I don't even like to remember it.   Made me cry just as much as when I read the VN.   Watching the Steins;Gate movie about half an hour ago. Before that, when watching the PunchLine finale about 6 hours ago.  I cry all the time, I think there's something wrong with me.    All the time. The shit quality of anime brings tears to my eyes. Also every cryfest like Keyshit, Anohana gets me cause I'm a big pansy. I cry at everything basically.    Wow damn your mum has terrible taste in anime.     I got absolutely destroyed by the second ep of sotsugyou hen.  I tear up reasonably often, not at sad moments but at moments that I think are really good or emotionally impactful. So I guess crying out of happiness or something? But  was the last time I genuinely cried because I was sad. The entire last season, hell, most of Aria was beautiful.  I cried Steins;Gate, teared up during Eva, and got sad during LAIN. I'm eternally crying inside because a show I really liked isnt ever going to get a second season.   tfw season final week   tfw gonna cry at least five times this weekend   The ride never ends ;_;      I have an idea. If you mention what it is, one of us will dutifully tell you why it's shit and free you from your eternal struggle.    Because he waited until the autistic girl was half dead already to fuck her?    You wont be able to convince me that Yuyushiki is shit, anon. I'm a rational human being.   Episode 9 of YuYuYu Maybe it's just because I have five younger siblings.   I get teary eyed pretty quickly when it comes to anime,but anything else and I'm cold as ice. Just today I felt empty and teary eyed during the punchline ending.  I was fine watching the anime, then I played through the VN. I cried like a bitch at least 3 times   At the ending of angel beats, that made me tear up a bit.   Straight up lost it when Illya started talking about how Heracles was like a father to her.   It didn't hurt this much when the played the VN. Why?    A few minutes ago when I rewatched iDOLM@STER episode 20.  Fuko disappearing.  Then she reappeared as a joke character and I dropped it.      not episode 15    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qiN<wbr>RO5H3AfI</wbr>  [ ]  Ashita no Joe ending  Some months ago during  Free .  i cried like a bitch when kaiji narrated that everyone's actually on the narrow bridge in the competitive society  Grave of the fireflies...  I cried just now because my allergies are so bad.  I only ever get close when I rewatch something for some reason.  I think it has to do with knowing whats coming and setting myself up to be sad or something.  Happened with both Texhnolyze and Bebop most recently.       Plastic memories gets good? I dropped it ep5.   During episode 265 of Gintama.   It's going exactly where everyone expected it was going, for better or worse.    When KinMosa ended    No, it got worse.   An absolute shitshow which will try to save itself with a sad finale.  and I will still cry anyway. fucking japan       I haven't watched the last episode yet, so it's still airing in my heart.    It was very average. No musical by the way.    Yeah, they cockteased us with the end of Ep11 and then delivered a wow it's fucking nothing finale  I want my money back      This.  Season 3 never ;_;    Today. Cowboy Bebop Ep10.   Got hit with the ex gf feels. inb4 &gt;3dpd     Why doesn't anyone remember this?  Who was the best girl?     it was all garbage     Because anyone in this series are cockteases.  I wouldn't live with house full of girls if my boner is always hard as diamonds.        It came out a long time ago. It helped set the standard for all the bullshit harems we have today. The only difference is that most of today's harems don't have half of the character development that Love Hina did. They just add a bunch of girls, fanservice, and lolmisunderstandings to attract the desperate and uninspired.      Pretty much, best girl with the greatest character development was drop for an abuser.    Best girl was Motoko. Still my waifu     Motoko Mondays.  MO-TO-KO MONDAYS.       Who was the best girl?  You posted her.    It was terrible. Fuck them for normalizing the abuse the MC's trend     We are two my old anon.      liking disgusting tsundere    best girl is still  the turtle     normalizing the abuse the MC's trend  Honestly, yeah. Love Hina has some good points, but it started some annoying trends.    I seriously wonder why people still are reading UQ Holder. I've even asked in threads and it's like they're ashamed to reply.    Shinomu the cutest!  I remember reading this back in 2001~ and it was great. Sure, nowadays we are used to better things, but overall it is still a good read.  I hate this. I feel like the haremshit boom would have been much, much smaller if this trash hadn't somehow gotten so popular. Still to this day you'll get at least 1 carbon copy of it every season, only condensed into 12 episodes.     love hina was shit. harem garbage.  turbonerd gets all the girls.     I reread it every year.  Naru           According to Ken Akamatsu's Mangaupdates page:   Draws hentai (perverted/pornographic) doujinshi as a hobby; his doujin circle is known as CULITTLE   Anyone read these doujins?        Motoko was best girl.  Though I felt for Mutsumi, she deserved a happy ending.        It was Mutsumi Otohime, but she was unable to win due to plot, even if, in-universe she had the best qualities to win.  Yet she won my heart.       I read those FF7 and Cowboy Bebop doujins a while back.      uninspired   God help me, I swore not to engage in meaningless debate with the retards that make 4chan, but I will and demand to ask, in context, what do you mean by "uninspired"? Please elaborate, sigh.       Either Motoko or Naru take the title of best girl.   However, I feel that if we had seen more of Shinobu in her true form, she could have taken the spot.       Except it was Tenchi which has done it.   I enjoyed the newgrounds dating Sim more.  Galaxy Angel was the better series     Holy shit, I don't remember this scene. Naru is quite the god damn molester.   My dick.         It's not Naru      Imo it went on for too long. Like nisekoi     That is from the OVA, when Nanako impersonates Naru.     It's not naru, its keitaros sister.     *Kanako.      sigh.  Kill yourself.      sigh  Fuck off back to reddit, idiot.     MC's sister was definitely best girl, I can't remember half their names anymore though. That said, Love Hina was pretty mediocre and went on way too long.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127168061  Fuck off back to reddit, idiot.     why doesn't anyone remember this?   Are you kidding? Who doesn't remember the greatest harem series of all time?       harem  way to set the bar low anon     Most of them were only cockteases because Naru kept cockblocking them. Kitsune would have fucked Keitaro by week two if she had her way.    Why was Naru such a bitch?     Kitsune would have fucked Keitaro by week two if she had her way.  [citation needed]    Best girl is mai waifu of course.    Possibly. Though she could've been the secretly insecure cocktease type.  We'll never know since Akamatsu neglected her character        SUperior wanted to ride him within 10 minutes of meeting him.    We can all agree Naru was shit, right? She made me drop the manga    Hey now, it gave him superhuman reflexes and endurance to become a master martial artist in the end. I'd say that was a fair trade.    She wasn't as bad as all that. Just the closest to a real human personality of all the girls.  Urashima was an annoying, beta sperglord for much of the story. Naru isn't without her faults, but realistically most people would find Urashima pretty annoying.        punching guys through walls and blaming them for accidents    not hating her guts  Sasuga, anon       equating this piece of garbage anything close to human     2) Love Hina: I'm not even going to mention the unspeakable, disgusting, pedophilic, pornograhpic events which transpire during this show, but suffice it to say, groups of young men on Love Hina-fueled rampages are raping children at a level unheard of since the 60s.   it was a standard harem imo     Akamatsu harems are the only ones I honestly enjoy     blaming them for accidents   routinely ends up in her tits/etc  At some point a line starts to get drawn. Hell even Rito's harem is starting to wise up that there might well be other forces at play.  And a lot of the time she's pissed at him because he's being such a disgusting beta with zero motivational drive.   She's without a doubt the most realistic of the girls.            following a harem series for "real human personalities"  There would be no harem.      wanting mango girls to be shallow, one dimensional characters relegating to being cute cardboard cutouts for the sperg MC to molest occasionally     Motoko no contest   Motoko &gt;&gt; Shinobu &gt;&gt; The Others. Came just to say this, now bye thread, ot was a terrible story anyway. Main character is such a looser like those girls with tsundere problems (for except Motoko and Shinobu).    Main character is such a looser   looser   oo   And yeah, Urashima was pretty fucking terrible but got better toward the end. Which is something most modern MCs fucking lack. He at least started to grow a spine.        I have all the volumes  in spanish cause I'm a spic    But wasn't videogirl Ai like the biggest cocktease? I have vague memories of super-detailed pantyshots   Ctrl + F: NEGIMA    0 results   the hate is real         implying that worst girl is best girl        Magic World arc   yeah fuck Negima  it could have just been harem magic shenanigans with occasional serious but noooooooooooooo           But wasn't videogirl Ai like the biggest cocktease?   you never finished it did you? motherfucker went through hell just to get dat ass  that he knew was going to disappear anyway   Video Girl AI was alright         Fuck you, I loved the Magic World Arc. The powerlevels may have gone through the roof and the ending might have been shit, but it was still a fun ride with a decent plot, great action and likable cast.    best LH girl   not the autistic semon demon   or Matoko everyone else is garbage       it went on too long, the rosters was mostly ignored, it turned into magic dragon ball z, the ending was horseshit, the spinoffs/alternate universes were horrible and Asuna was literally worst girl.     hahahah, that bait is too strong eh anon? Your words are what run through my head before almost every post on this site.      Asuna was literally worst girl.   Asuna   not one of the best girls  Shit taste.       Haruka &gt;= Mutsumi &gt; Shinobu (because Kei cant into loli) &gt;= Motoko &gt; Kitsune &gt;= Kaolla &gt; powergap &gt; Naru &gt; Sara  search inside your heart, you know this to be true       Wasn't Haruka his older cousin or something like that? Isn't that  w incest?    Love Hina introduced me to manga and anime after the usual dragon ball z, yuyu hakusho, inuyasha etc.  I remember when I was 12 I was playing the dating sim on newgrounds and I got curious and searched for more about it. And there I discovered the manga, and from that point on my life completely changed.  I won't ever forget about it.       every Akamatsu manga had bad scans (even those that Akamatsu released himself), mediocre to bad scanlate, and terrible licensing   no one will ever do justice to his series   A days of youth, after manga was fully scanlated and I read every chapter while next downloaded from IRC while using dial-up with bad line...     I just re-read my old copies. First manga I ever bought.  First half holds up. Comes across as cliche, but it's solid, and there's enough plot to make me actually care.  Second half is crap. Like,there was literally no plot, but he kept going. Bunch of one-shot chapters and increasingly stupid "Naru and Keitaro almost admit their feeling but she winds up punching him" plotlines. And some weirdo incest subplot with some shoehorned character.       Manga Naru was best girl.     dating sim on newgrounds   shit, are you me?     jesus   All the best girls had names that began with M.    Naru.    card captor sakura doujin was the best. i think it was called AM:4 or some other number    Wow, both of those points are such bullshit, that I shouldn't really be responding to them. But I got nothing better to do. Blaming someone for being a "disgusting beta with zero motivation" is no reason to sock him in the face every five seconds. She's a disgusting human being with an unlikable personality who deserve the same amount of physical abuse she dishes out, if not more.  Also, she's as realistic as a stick figure on a piece of paper. Plenty of girls, both in the 2D and 3D world, aren't complete bitches for no true reason other than "I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT, BETTER PUNCH HIM"  She needs to be dead and stay dead        We all remember it, but are too ashamed to admit it. That said, Mutsumi was best girl.   The guilty gear one with Bridget and Millia is fucking excellent.    My first manga... Naru is obviously best girl. Mutsumi or Kitsune second. I literally had nothing to compare it to... it was incredible. Absolutely buttfucking incredible.       This  sadly. None of the girls were really amazing in any regard. At least watermelon giel never hit Keitaro     Not this. Why anyone likes physically and verbally abusive, violent women is a mystery to me. Literally the worst girl.        Kanako and Motoko were the best grills.   oi you can't just say being unlikable is realistic   it devalues reality     Tenchi was better.   Watch anime  Mutsumi was the best girl   Watch the OVA  Kanako was the best girl   Read the manga   Motoko was the best girl          Love Hina? Oh you mean that Flash Dating Sim!   This is what I remember most about Love Hina   unpopular opinion (and probably for good reason), but I disagree  liked the character development of LH better, and I watched Tenchi before LH      I was supposed to be taking care of college work, but it looks like I'm taking a detour through nostalgia lane.    I CAME     Almost July   college work   Summer classes? Are you a glutton for punishment?       Certainly not Naru. She is a fucking psychotic hypocritical cunt.    Mutsumi was best girl, but i'll concede she was about as smart as a brick.    Is this the one starting the rise of harem ?    i feel like tenchi muyo deserves that title but love hina is a close second.    No, that would be pic related.  Love Hina definitely boosted the popularity and demand though.       smart as a brick   ended up with a degree in Medicine from Toudai   just because she's dense like lead and derps alot in favor of Naru, doesn't mean she's dumb  I love you Mu-chan but you were stupid to give Kei to Naru... TWICE        Shinobu     SUperior   ?      Agreed. She was the one who deserved to be loved the most. Motoko was a close second.    when she grows up Kaola joins the Rebellion just for shits and giggles    Negima! excelled when it was balancing action/plot with slice of life chapters. The Magic World went full fucking retard with the latter and turned the manga into power level bullshit for the last five years.  Also, Chisame a fucking shit but they kept shoehorning her into the story to the bitter end.      Naru was the best girl that won too.   I loved Love Hina. Sure is a harem full of cliches but it was fun, Keitaro was goofy and likable but not retarded like many harem MCs, Naru was a generic tsundere at first but changed early on and was also likable, Shinobu and Mokoto had a enormous development as characters, Mutsumi was a good counter balance for Naru, Su and Mitsune weren't too relevant but they were fun.  I just don't like Kanako, fuck that bitch     Love Hina was good until it went full shounen and dragged the plot into the ground.     went full shounen  are you thinking of negima? love hina never really fundamentally changed and its problem was that it did the same fucking shit for 3 or 4 volumes past when everyone was way too tired of it  introducing a new girl that fucking late in the story and expecting us to believe she meant anything  epilogue girl was qt though.       i just remembered how awful the whole kanako part was.  Shinobu was the best girl and from where Love Hina ended she should have been the winner.      Everyone hates Kanako. Her best moment was counter-punching Naru as she was about to punch Keitaro. Felt damn good.  Also, I agree that she's a terrible girl but she's still better than Naru.        Now that I think about it, Kanako was my introduction to wincest. That explains a lot...   I loved Kanako.      I loved her you faglord.     She was just a plot device so they could extend the life of the manga     Yeah. Sinobu and Ku were never really in the contest imo because it's borderline pedo at the time.  Older Shinobu is stacked.       She was just a plot device so they could extend the life of the manga  She was the first real challenge towards naru/keitarou, other than their own internal bickering. More than a plot device.      you two are literal cancer. she's the fucking scrappy doo of love hina only worse.     The only cancer here is you.     real challenge   kanako   REAL CHALLENGE   KANAKO   CHALLENGE   KANA-FUCKING-KO  KEITARO BARELY REMEMBERED HER FUCKING NAME YOU IGNORANT RETARD SHE MEANT NOTHING TO ANYONE          She wanst even the first. Mutsumi was a real challenge to Naru/Keitaro, hell, even Shinbu and Mokoto were a more big of a "threat". Keitaro never considered Kanako as a love interest, he only see her as a sister       I loved kanako   loved   past tense   It's time to move on, anons     implying it wouldn't be borderline pedo today   Japan, or more specifically, Anime and Manga are really open minded about pedophilia these days...                 KEITARO BARELY REMEMBERED HER FUCKING NAME YOU IGNORANT RETARD SHE MEANT NOTHING TO ANYONE   Well the last time he saw her was when she was a babby. The Hinata residents all came to care for her, and Keitarou always has.     She was a challenge for them in that she really took things to the extreme and went truly all-out, none of the other girls really did that, even if they had better odds (Keitarou wasn't into that wincest, so it was an uphill battle for Kanako)  Or do I have to remind you of that entire Kanako arc where she basically whipped everyone and made them all into her bitches, etc. etc. Not to mention she (accidentedly) ensnared keitarou with the curse of the abandoned hinata inn, etc. etc.   The other girls could have been a challenge to the relationship of naru/kei as well, but most of them didn't even speak up about it until the very end of the series, this is including shinobu ofc.                &gt;implying it wouldn't be borderline pedo today  I meant that in my eyes.   It's time to move on, anons  Me too though. Except it's not Kanako, but Motoko. I don't partake in waifu bs, but if I had a waifu it would probably be her.         She took things to the extreme because she was created to represent a big challenge to Keitaro and Naru, a sort of final boss so Keitaro and Naru's relationship could mature, different from thet other girls that represented some threat for the couple   Naru best girl  Shinobu close second      She was a challenge for them in that she really took things to the extreme and went truly all-out  and yet none of the readers felt any tension because it all felt like bullshit time-wasting OH BUT THERE'S A CURSE IN THE MANSION THAT WE NEEEVER KNEW ABOUT BEFORE MAYBE THIS WILL TRUMP KEITARO BREAKING HIS CHILDHOOD PROMISE (or not, no one can remember anymore) AND ALL THE OTHER SHIT THEY WENT THROUGH SO THAT HE COULD END UP WITH NARU BY THE WAY DID YOU REMEMBER THAT NARU IS LIKE THE AUNT AND KEITARO IS LIKE DR BIG DICK HERE'S HIM DRIVING BAD SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE SAME AND MAYBE THE DESIRES OF THIS EVIL BITCH MATTER AND WE WILL CARE ABOUT HER FEELINGS  NO AKAMATSU YOU FUCKING HACK END YOURSELF SO WE CAN BE DONE                how is she a threat if she could not have won? it was obvious there was no possible game plan where she would be with keitaro.   I was crazy over this shit in high school back in like 2002 along with other Harem shit like Ai Yori Aoshi (which made me hard as diamonds since it had nipples in it). Had all the volumes, lent them to my art teacher who I got into animu. Nostalgic, but not that great in retrospect. I still have all the Negima, but Ken turned those into shit.  By the way, wasn't Shinobu based off Ken's niece? Kietaro was a self insert of him and Naru was his soon to be fiance whom he made a literal promise with to part ways until they both succeed in their dreams (him a mangaka, her a model) and then marry only on condition that they fulfill their dreams on their own. Does this mean that if Shinobu won, he'd be banging his niece in real life?   Also Nodoka best girl, fucking fight me        Thats what I said, she didn't represent any kind of threat  Misquoted  ?     Akamatsu remade Love Hina anime/manga like AMAGAMI where every girl wins in separate routes?  I would pay for it. Especially Yandere Naru after she gets NTR'D by Kanako      how is she a threat if she could not have won?  Keitarou at one point almost gave in, even started having fantasies about Kanako and everything.  I'd say she actually didn't do too bad a job despite having had the odds stacked against her.  This is why I loved Kanako so much. She was every bit as beta/shy/secluded as the other girls were, but did that stop her even once from trying to win Keitarou over? No it didn't. It was so refreshing to see a girl that actually took action and tried to win her love, rather than just pacing back and forth in denial, breaking things occasionally, or just being uguu~ senpai pls notice me (shinobu) the entire series.  Kanako had the cards stacked against her from the start but she always went all in, she was always true to her feelings, none of this hesitation, rom-com, blue-balling bullshit.  She was also one of the more fleshed out characters, You clearly see her develop from this cold, Keitarou hunting machine into someone warmer, softer, someone who, in the end of her arc, even sacrificed herself in order to let Keitarou be with the girl he truly wanted to be with. It was probably one of the most touching moments in the series for me when Keitarou, despite knowing who Kanako truly was behind the disguise, chased after her first instead of Naru. Ofc he did that mostly out of platonic love, but it cemented Kanako's place and arc as one of the best in the series for me.             this whole fucking post holy shit what is wrong with you      I have taste, you don't.    She's a generic oni-con.  Pic related is a superior brocon       &gt;She's a generic oni-con.  You can add 'generic' to just about every character in anime/manga.  But I'd argue that kanako was not generic. She took onii-con to new levels of insanity, even for today's st andards.       Ou, I watched this like 20 years ago, I think I was 4, don't remember much of it, what happen at the end? Who win?    http://lovehina.wikia.com/wiki/Kana<wbr>ko_Urashima#Character_Design  Love Hina was supposed to finish after Keitaro got into Tokyo University, but it was more successful than he realized and his editors wanted the series to continue. When he found that he didn't have any way to create tension/conflict with the characters he had by now, he introduced Kanako Urashima in a way to "bring closure" to the story, just like he did with the character Yayoi Kobe in A.I. Love You.  she was ham-handed into the story due to the demands of editors she added nothing she was hastily created to serve a purpose and this was blindingly obvious to everyone else she's a fucking scrappy doo yet you think she's a good character. fucking epilogue girl is better than her.      </wbr>    Love Hina would have been pretty shit if they ended it @ turtle island arc.  Even if Kanako wasn't in the original palns that doesn't stop her from her arc being good and it certainly doesn't draw away from her character. In fact it makes one appreciate her even more. Most of the girls in love hina just plain out sucked. Kanako was a breath of fresh air.      naru narusegawa aka nerd-bitch tsundere i want to say his childhood promise was to her first, not musume, but i honestly am not sure anymore because even keitaro decided that some shit he said when he was 7 doesn't fucking matter.      doesn't stop her arc from being good  it isn't good you may like it but it's widely hated by readers.       you may like it but it's widely hated by readers.  Prove it.  Also, since when have the majority had good taste? It's pretty rare when they do.      Everyone knows Love Hina, and know it's to blame for every generic Harem Anime ever.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zfc<wbr>5twxGjZQ</wbr>  [ ] You are now hearing the opening manually.     Why anyone likes physically and verbally abusive, violent women is a mystery to me.  Pretty sure the ones who like Naru just don't care about the slapstick humor enough to bitch about it at every opportunity.     Except Kei can't into Loli, and she would have have to waited (at least) 3-5 years for him to even allow himself to look at her the same way Kitsune made him look at her.    I don't even remember Kanako at all, or Keitaro being worse than an average harem protag (in fact he was better, since he actually actively pursued the girl he loved).    i guess there aren't any good surveys or critical analysis available on the series whatever, she's still shit and only served to drag out a story that was already way too long. telling readers to try and believe keitaro truly loved a girl he literally never mentioned or thought of over the course of the series, and then saying that a magic annex was going to make him, was downright insulting to the readers.      telling readers to try and believe keitaro truly loved a girl he literally never mentioned  What are you even talking about?  You don't even explain why you think she's shit. You're just saying   hurr durrdon't like the things I don't like    as far as I'm concerned.          Even her name isn't very good. If it was she would be called Hina.  Just the reveal of her name would have been hype as fuck.         Reminder that Naru is everything wrong with the tsundere genre. She was the vanguard of the "new" tsundere we have now that is hyper bipolar aggressive (sometimes unaggravated) violence followed by immediate "dere" moment that just caters to moefags because it makes money.  Motoko is the real tsundere and how traditional tsunderes were written. She's cold in the beginning and warms up to the MC because she gets to know him as a person.        for there to be tension we have to believe there is a possibility for her to succeed for her to succeed keitaro has to give up his love for naru and fall in love with her when 10 fucking volumes have been about him and naru and keitaro has not mentioned or even thought of her once over those 10 fucking volumes nor has any member of his family there's no fucking chance the readers are going to buy that so they introduce the cursed annex maaagic will even the playing field and now keitaro will have to break the curse and be with naru or stay with kanako even though there had been fantasy elements in the story, it is still fucking retarded for a curse to be a central plot point for the final arc of a fucking rom-com.           Pretty much this. Both for Naru and Motoko. They even state how Motoko was getting "less rough around the edges" and becoming "softer and rounder", her outfits and demeanor slowly becoming more feminine. Which was why Motoko was so popular, or at least why I liked her.       Reminder that Naru is everything wrong with the tsundere genre.  She at least gets some decent character development, unlike modern tsunderes.      for there to be tension we have to believe there is a possibility for her to succeed  We all knew from the start that naru was going to win 100%. Therefore none of the girls added any tension to the series, by your definition.   even though there had been fantasy elements in the story, it is still fucking retarded for a curse to be a central plot point for the final arc of a fucking rom-com.  I wouldn't go so far as to call it a central plot point, it gets introduced relatively late into her arc.  The real point of Kanako's arc, along with all the other arcs of the girls, was to flesh out Kanako's character in the story and to help solidify Naru's relationship with Keitaro.   It's just what you do. You employ some form of conflict/tension in order to develop/further sone facet of the story, in this case that being naru and Keitaro's relationship.   I don't think that makes it a bad arc though. It really pushed their limits as a potential couple and it's only after this arc that they become truly serious about each other.             I have a copy of Love Hina Infinity  Official pool for most popular girl   1st Narusegawa 4225 2nd Motoko 3276 3rd Shinobu 2703 4th Kanako 1430 5th Mutsumi 814 6th Su 613 6th Haruka 613 8th Mitsune 590 9th Ema 362 10th Tsuruko 160 11th Sarah 107 11th Nyamo 107                  In the manga, respectfully. SOME. Not a lot. In the anime, she is outright stagnant.     kanako herself is shit because she's hung up on something said to her when she was very young. keitaro was older than her yet he still has literally no recollection of it.  she didn't even try to contact him within the last decade even though her entire psyche is apparently built around her love for him  she's sexually aggressive with all the other characters which is totally jarring for a character so invested in the concept of true love  she's also a bigger bitch over the course of a few chapters than naru was across the whole series combined.           knew it was naru from day 1  arguably no. there were points where i thought it honestly could have been musume with his relationship with naru going down a different direction.  pushes their relationship to the limit  it was fucking NOTHING compared to how much they stressed over musume, her illness, and the childhood promise. that was also a better conflict because it was actually something affecting the thoughts and emotions of the main character while all of kanako's arc had a null effect on everyone but herself..        kanako herself is shit because she's hung up on something said to her when she was very young  It was because of their overall relationship/time together that Kanako went the route she did, not just a single phrase.   keitaro was older than her yet he still has literally no recollection of it.  You know what else he forgot? His fucking 'promise' girl, well that ended up being a far bigger plot point than Kanako ever was, so why not attack that first if you're hung up over it?   she's sexually aggressive with all the other characters which is totally jarring for a character so invested in the concept of true love  I'm not even sure what you're trying to say here. She does sexually molest some of the girls, but only as a form of psychological attack, not because she lusts after their bodies or w/e. This has no bearing on her love for keitaro other than that it illustrates how far she's willing to go to stomp out the competition.    she's also a bigger bitch over the course of a few chapters than naru was across the whole series combined.  Being a bitch doesn't make you a bad character. If you want something where everyone holds hands and gets along all the time no matter what, go watch sesame street.               arguably no. there were points where i thought it honestly could have been musume with his relationship with naru going down a different direction.   With how developed Keitaro/Naru were at that point, it was hardly likely that the main girl would shift to Musume.   it was fucking NOTHING compared to how much they stressed over musume, her illness, and the childhood promise.   I'd disagree. It forced Naru to once and for all confront her true feelings for Keitaro, and that's quite the feat considering how stubborn and tsundere Naru is.          This   Regardless of the reason, I am glad Kanako was introduced. Because of that we got to see good stuff like Molmol and Todai.  Overall I think it wouldn't have been as good without those chapters.      I'd disagree. It forced Naru to once and for all confront her true feelings for Keitaro, and that's quite the feat considering how stubborn and tsundere Naru is.  Other way around. Naru was supposed to have won and stopped that bipolar tsundere nonsense during the island trip (she was going to give him the P), but they reverted her back to a retarded bipolar tsundere just so they can extend the manga for $$$$.     Love Hina-hen?  Really,what I want most is for him to go back and color the damn manga already.Shonen jump does it with naurto,one piece and bleack.  How hard would it be to just go back and color it all in?  I want full color love hina,ai love you,and negima so fucking much.         10,000 continuation songs and alternate versions on 1,000 soundtracks....  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F3t<wbr>vJPa3wIE</wbr>  [ ]    Motoko &gt; Mutsumi &gt; Kitsune = adult Shinobu = adult Su &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rest Shinobu was cute, not waifu material, aunt was off-limits and Su was a kid, so the "rest" is mostly Naru, the sister I don't care about and Ema from the epilogue.  Was this manga a milestone in terms of shifting popularity into harems? It sure looks like a lot of archetypes came from there, but I know shit about anime history.      Definitely not in Japan, but very likely so in US.  Tenchi Muyo was out before if I recall.....     Love Hina was one the first animu I ever watched outside of shit like Sailor Moon and DBZ.  I had dial-up back then so I used to dedicate every sunday afternoon to downloading one episode off of KaZaA, since they were only like, 30 megabytes a pop.     people don't like Naru   Explain yourselves, homosexuals.     Unnecessarily violent bipolar shitty type of tsundere.  Everyone knows good tsunderes are the OG type that are naturally cold but warm up.  Like Nanasaki Ai.       The only thing I know about this manga is due to fact I played that game boy advance game.   Shinobu best girl       This. Exactly this. Also excellent taste.     I like my Tsunderes to be angry when the situation deserves it, and not comlete rageaholics 95% of the time   even less when the 5% that they're supposedly Dere, they're being more indecisive and wishy-washy than the piece of shit harem protagonist       sigh  Sigh    Love Hina will always hold a place for a lot of people, even if it was just to introduce you to a part of something bigger.

There's nothing natural feeling about their friendship, it feels forced and like they are all awkwardly too close to each other.    But girls actually act that way, anon.    Why so homophobe?

That Azusa break down during episode 24     Azumanga Daioh    10/10 manga. Comfy af.    the only time i cried watching anime    K-On    Delete this.   Azumanga   I still have to watch and finish a few on these list but I agree.      Too gay.      Non Non Biyori. I think K-ON and Yuru Yuri are better SoLs overall but nothing I've seen has ever topped NNB for pure comfy.     It's actually not needed just manga is enough.    Azusas are for happiness, not for crying.    That just makes that scene all the more upsetting    A KyoAnifag would defend that that is better than this.    Hello autism my old friend    massive spoilers in the preview    watching previews   What wicked plans have she conjured up?   Delusional lonerendfag  He loves Yukino, that much is obvious.       8man   being in love at this point  You need a mirror to look at.      No, I'm not delusional nor do I think so because of some ship. I think Yui has better chances than Yukino, but even then it doesn't really mean that 8man is going to start dating her.    He's shown more interest in Iroha.    He has feelings for her yeah, but I'm not sure if we can really say he's in love with her.   Why don't you like old hags, /a/?  They're called christmas cakes  But i love em, theyre the peerfect breeding material   Got any source? Tried various times, and all it leads to is /r9k/, with no leads. Sorry for being a faggot    The artist is Redrop faggot.   I personally prefer Christmas cakes to MILFs. But they're both great.   i thought it was the same    Cakes are 25+ with no kids.    I Smell NTR     like MILFs   don't like NTR   What a terrible mixture.       Not him, but I just like older women. If it has to be a MILF, why can't she be divorced or a widow? Why go through the trouble of introducing a husband purely so he can be cheated on? Divorce is (way too fucking) common nowadays, you can easily use it as an excuse to have a single MILF.  What the fuck is it with the Nips and NTR?       they're aroused by shame?     I don't give a shit about cheating when there isn't this perverse and obvious sexual thrill from watching some guy's life shatter.  It's attention better spent on the actual sex      only if they're over 24 and unmarried   and i do   because of this          Yeah. I guess I wouldn't care about a throwaway line like 'Oh I hope my husband doesn't find out~'. But NTR just makes me feel bad for everyone involved.   My favorite.  Best MILF ?   it is the most popular fetish among betas and nips are genetically beta    Is Step-MILF a thing?     I guess I wouldn't care about a throwaway line like 'Oh I hope my husband doesn't find out~'  Why? That line has to actively be thought up and written. You could just as easily NOT mention a husband. In fact, that's even fucking easier.     I don't know. Give it that 'forbidden lust' appeal or something. I don't care for that stuff but I can deal with it when it's that minor, but it rarely is. I just don't get the fetish or why it's so widespread.   Old hags are not cute.   Do you get to fuck them all in the VNs?    Yes.    Cool.    I guess I will play the VNs, but not because of this.   If real life was like anime, older women would look like Demi Moore(she's 52)   Makeup, photos hop and plastic surgery     Demi moore was a shit even as young woman, there are better example.     is that picture supposed to look good      well a christmas-cake marrying a man with a child might be it, there's actually a manga that revolves around a story of one living with a NEET    when's the release date anon ?    download older anime   defaults to the english dub and no subtitles     downloading    not streaming     It must be difficult being retarded.     Download older anime   Read the subs and understand some moon   The fucking subs dont match what they're saying or it is a translation out of context        reading Jojo part 5   the translation is literally just making shit up      tfw   get the fuck in here faggots  starting now   http://yourafool.keyblade.jp http://yourafool.keyblade.jp http://yourafool.keyblade.jp           streaming  Look at this pleb.     What kind of incompetent fuck does that?    How do you do that?    those are all english sub tracks    I'm poor so not enough hardisk space for me, please understand    older anime  How old? You must be underage if you don't realize how based 80s-90s dubs are.    Must be tough with a 4gb hard drive. Otherwise you don't have an excuse.     This.     Dubs were always shit, people who watch anything outside of the language it was made in should kill themselves.      People should kill themselves for watching a show the way they want to      Exactly, whats your point?    download show from a few years back   only seeded torrent is [Deadfish]   timing is slightly off and there's watermarks   Looking at you, Canaan.       Doesn't always work getting the sub tracks because multiple tracks could be labeled English but only be signs. Also the audio tracks sometimes aren't even labeled.    Didn't know you could do that. You saved me a lot of future grief, thank you.     timing is slightly off      Wow. That's fucking sad. You have some serious mental issues.     Go back to reddit retard and stop taking what you see on the internet at face value.   This happened to me when I downloaded code geass R2  And another show which I forgot I managed to download it in a spanish dub     He's right though.     People should kill themselves for watching a show   yes  Baccano dub was good       pic related   wow so hard   The problem with dual audio torrents is that they always have two tracks of subtitles, one with just signs and the other with real subtitles, and the sign one is always the default. So you can't automate it and need to manually switch subs every fucking episode, as they're both labeled as English subs.   finding dubbed anime for new shows is so hard    timing is slightly off and it changes between each episode by how much   timing is slightly off and it changes during the episode   That was hell.       Yes.     not know what DeadFish is    You poor saps should learn how to remux. In more extreme cases, you should learn how to use aegisub.    It is hard. Thank you for understanding.   Also my anime folder has a 30 Gb movie in it so go fuck yourself.             This asshurt over Chinese cartoons          downloading bloatgirls    Hitting A and then S is complicated I know    Hardsub   timing is off, and it gets worse as each episode progresses   3 episodes in there's a 30 second delay   by the sixth it's 1:30         not watching raw      suddenly everyone is speaking English   Japanese track is marked as jvn (Javanese)       This doesn't work anymore, those assholes mix some oxygen with the helium now or someshit      watching dub       those assholes   Sounds like someone's still bitter he woke up in a hospital with brain damage and had to spend a few weeks in a psych ward.       It's a legitimate language.    download dual-audio release   defaults to english dub with subtitles  figuratively why? dubfags need to turn the subtitles off every episode, and subfags need to turn the jap audio on every episode. It's the worst of both worlds.      A lot of english shows have eng subs for some reason.     30gb movie  whoa we have hotshot here!   not downloading blurays        Signs, karaoke.   Fuck that shit.       That is likely because they don't exist anon.    So everyone is equally ticked off.    I love it, personally.  I grew up having to watch everything on TV with closed captioning because my father was deaf as fuck so now I'm so used to it I can't watch even english shit without subs.     This Power Level placements are correct, right /a/?     This is the up to date one  inb4 boo hoos      Technically Wizard has the strongest suit of any Kamen Rider, you did see Black RX right?    Not like it matters, Space Sheriffs and Zubat have the toughest armor of any toku hero short of an Ultra    Not this shit again     calling it bait  and little goblins too, anon, and little goblins too  Now if only I had a "get a load of this guy" pic       No it's not. This is the idiot-friendly version.     It is Hao Asakura, not Asokura.    The types of threads remind me of when I used to play with my friends as a child, and in the end it would always result in us arguing by saying "infinity plus 1". Don't you feel somewhat embarrassed by still doing this as an adult?   I see you're a Demonbanefag.    How is Battler that low, he literally punched Bernkastel in the face   There's no fucking axis! what kind of bullshit is this?    idiot friendly   Over a hundred characters      Less powerful.  Featherine is above them all, but she's in special for some reason.     This is getting asinine even by autistic powerlevel thread standards. The only things you people bitch about now is whether or not to move Demonbane/Featherine/Myuugi half a pixel higher or lower. Take 's advice and shut the fuck up.    spike   stronger if not even with shichika    nigga w u t       No contradiction there, retard.  Having a huge clusterfuck of characters with no special tier is garbage. Sorry you wasted hours of your pathetic life making this.     oh look another power level thread. fun thread guys   Fuck off, weeaboo.   Reminder that Full Possession Shurouga is stronger than Demonbane      No contradiction there, retard.  Nice irony there      Hatou is up there   I approve.       I don't know about the other faggots, but It's proven that Shichika can take atleast 8 bullets and still fight as if it's fucking nothing. Spike wouldn't even touch him.      deleting your post to make a new one  Confirmed idiot.     Nobody cares     Accel stil above madara     Arcueid should be higher. She can fight the God tiers of CCC, who are confortably in large planet/solar system level and billions of times FTL.    [citation needed]   Reminder that even nu52 supes can throw SSJGod into the sun before he could react.   Nothing suggests they are that strong outside of the mooncell.    Check the Origin Servants vs Kiara fight.   So? The fact Arc can fight them on even level still puts her at that level anywhere else.        implying he couldn't survive being thrown into the sun      throwing Superman into the sun  Are you aware of the flaw in your plan?     Full Possesion Shurouga is just a meme m8.    When did she fight them? And Nasu's statements mean shit since he doesn't canfirm that she can go and beat them at their strongest under the conditions where they have those stats.  As it is now CCC god tiers are still way above her in raw feats.       He would suffocate in an instant.      She is the only one who can fight Amaterasu among all CCC characters, while it was noted all other characters stand no chance against Amaterasu. Regardless of how anal you are about feats, that still puts them at the very least on a comparable level with other CCC characters, if not stronger.    instant transmission, boya   Why is Guts not in here? There are weaker people in this list, more weaker than him.    Hajun   might as well put Ren in there too      Esdeath would destroy Guts.    This, if Gutz is not there I'm sure as hell Spike should't be.    Spike is only on that chart made by retard for retards, ignore it. Any other chart than that is much better.    move jack rakan to special tier. he can respawn if he is errased from reality    What does Yuugi even do?   I'm ultimate.    Beerus not rank 1 with Goku rank number 2  Your list is shit     My ass, Esdeath is garbage, she wouldnt even kill Dio, who's time stop only lasts for 5 seconds, unlike her 8 second advantage.    He can only respawn for a couple moments though.    So? Dio's The World is faster than light and has regeneration.     being this new    Reminder that Guts is a jobber.  He wouldn't be able to kill any characters at the bottom of the chart.      DIO's timestop lasts 5 seconds  Your new is showing.      Don't you feel somewhat embarrassed by still doing this as an adult?  I stopped worrying about stuff like that when I realized that doing so is no less immature.     I don't think Saitama should be that high, considering he doesn't have reality-bending powers.    And you're still watching stupid cartoons as an adult   Stronger than every DBZ character.    Saitama to the top baby  As someone that recently started Noein (only 7 eps in) just how powerful are the titular character and Haruka?  homura would literally die if you shot her in the head.  she's not a god she's just able to interfere with a god    At least we know one thing will always be true.    homura would literally die if you shot her in the head.  Magical girls can't die from physical damage. Shooting her in the head would just render her unconscious until she regenerated.     Wouldnt the End of Evangelion be above the viewer then?    No. A fictional event can not do anything to real people.    Special tier.     missing the joke     The holocaust made people pursue nazis.    I see what you did there    Battler was only able to punch Bern because she was caught off guard by the sheer absurdity of someone punching her.   AuAu is in special because she is literally omnipotent under special circumstances, but completely powerless otherwise. That makes her impossible to categorize normally.       Special Tier    The same applies to the other witches, yet they're in the field.  You always assume they're at their post powerful on these charts.        That all only holds true if you interpret extended metaphor and delusions as literal fact.  MAGIC ISN'T REAL         aka: I am so broken but truck-kun can kill me.       The difference is that Lambda/Battler/Bern/Beato can all be defeated, even under perfect circumstances. AuAu, at the height of her power, is 100% invincible. The only way to "win" against her is for her to decide that the story is more interesting with someone else's victory.  I would place her in special tier because there is no contest when she is involved. She can just choose to automatically win.       I would place her in special tier because there is no contest when she is involved. She can just choose to automatically win.  That's a nice way to summon all the Demonbanefags.     I don't know shit about demonbane other than copypasta, but it seems to me he should belong in special as well.    That's because it had the word "general" in it.  We've had quite a few power level threads in the last month that go to 500 replies, and the mods have no problems. Keep the tears flowing.        Actually no. Battle was able to punch Bern because they were playing a game. She was not fighting using her real power. She was playing a magical board game with him.      There is a Demonbane that forces her to write her own defeat.  There is a Demonbane that can summon an infinite army of Featherines.  Demonbane wins.        Honestly, the easiest way is to just put all of the toppest tiers on the same level, since they're all just fluffed-out pseudo-omnipotents. You can spend all day arguing about who's stronger, but never come to a conclusion because they're all fucking bullshit.   Someone post the chart with the guy "Fucked/NTR your waifu" or something.  Shuma Gorath should be above Goku,  saitama is a god power level      Omnipotents   Stronger than other omnipotents   you people have no idea what this word means         Demonbane is not omnipotent.    /thread   I think we all know who's really the strongest.  <br/>     Why do people put non-omnipotent characters above omnipotent characters like LoN and Kami-Tenchi?  Also if you're going to include Featherine and Omnipotents you should include The Creator from Umineko which is basically the LoN of Umineko.        Who even are any of those on the top row, and what did they do to be there?    What I'd like to know is why Kumagawa is above Ajimu.  Kumagawa got his powers from Ajimu and she has a few trillion other powers besides those.     Isn't the Anti-Spiral more powerful than STTGL technically? I mean, I was under the impression they lost because they underestimated STTGL, and adjusted their power to be equal to them, as to shame them.  Wonder if Goku or someone else from DB will reach the top of these chart after Super ends  Why is phoenix gundam above STTGL and Anti-Spiral?  Is Omega Shenron stronger than Bills?      Nagato Yuki on the same level as Enrico Pucci   Enma Ai lower than Nagato Yuki   witches on the top row    Kiss Shot and Alucard on the same level   Arcueid not orders of magnitude above the two          It is LITERALLY, completely omnipotent   Regular Shurouga's help was needed to weaken it before they could even harm it    weaken an omnipotent   harm an omnipotent   God damn how retarded are the people that wrote this bait?          Madara isnt on top    Whis isn't even on there He is stronger then Goku, and Beerus, and can rewind time.      dbzfags     Even within the context of the game, Bern was infinitely more powerful than Battler (other than the whole "Battler is alive" shenanigans). He wouldn't have been able to punch her without it being a completely unexpected attack.    You're welcome for the gift of powerlevels moe wizard girl faggot       Arcueid isn't even a proper Type. ORT (Type Mercury) is probably the strongest thing in the mainstream Nasuverse, and going by Notes the other Types are even stronger. Even just going by Tsukihime, the original Crimson Moon is inherently stronger than Arcueid.       She's still leagues ahead of the other vampires that were mentioned.     Kamijou Touma on the level of Battler and Beatrice   Shiki on the level of Goku   Shiki above [ ] Shiki   Gilgamesh, presumably still wielding Ea, only two "tiers" above an ordinary human    Anything above Demonbane   Anything other than Demonbane above Featherine           Why are you even responding to it?    None of those characters are.     Demonbane above omnipotents      There is a Demonbane who is more omnipotent than your omnipotent character     Not how it works    Power level thread   guaranteed replies    I'm an Elder God Demonbane fag, who is this Myuugi girl and how is she stronger than it?     strongest vampire in anime isn't even on the chart      Lina Inverse in special   But why?     She isn't.    butthurt demonbanefag detected    Retard detected.    Not that anon, but you're obviously a delusional demonbanefag. You faggots keep fighting characters you don't understand and proving it in these threads. How retarded can you get?    Myuugi isn't even the strongest in her own universe, anon.    demonbane also not so?    Demonbane is stronger than Azathoth. This is outright stated in the VN and shown clearly in D.Y.N freaks.    EGD is.   I believe if you guys are ever going to do future power level's, you have to split it into different categories, namely the most basic creation and destruction   why is yomiko readman so high on there? also she's not a magic user faggot       tumblr   now that's gay.    Actually you can't beat this guy.  demonbane should be in the special tier to avoid demonbanefags go full retard   Demonbane should just not be on the list considering how many things can simply erase him.     Not understanding what omnipotent characters are     There is nothing on that list that can defeat Demonbane.    Please show where it says this in DYN.  People always say that but it isn't translated and has never been shown to actually be a thing.  And even if Demonbane was stronger than Azathoth it wouldn't make him stronger than LoN or Kami Tenchi. It would just show that Demonbane Azathoth is not omnipotent.         "Any Demonbane, past, present, or future, possible or impossible, real or not real, that should come in contact with this universe is now erased."  Hell, Myuugi's even worse. She can just set her ring on Autopilot and she doesn't even have to say anything.     Author&gt;Viewer    People like that, aka gods, should all just be put into their own little box simply labeled "omnipotent" so that we can have an actually meaningful chart composed of people whose power isn't just having all the powers. They put gaku-chan, who is quite literally THE creator God, in the special box for a reason, but most of the top are just like her.     Viewer should be special tier.      with this universe is now erased.   this universe   universe   Open the flood gates and let the demonbanefags through, because you just fucked up.        Oh it doesn't matter if they come from a multiverse, if they contact Featherine's universe, they're erased. So they pretty much have to get erased or keep sucking, because they can't overpower Featherine at that point.     Demonbane can just ignore that and erase Featherine and Myuugi.    Not without coming into contact with Featherine's universe he can't. And Myuugi has an autopilot "Delete everything that stands against me" mode, so that's out of the picture too.     typical demonbanefag bullshit post      Literally confining Omnipotent entities under the limitations of human logic       &gt;Demonbane above omnipotents    There is a Demonbane who is more omnipotent than your omnipotent character  Oh dog. This comment is stupid it actually made me LOL IRL.  Thanks man.          The Demonbane completely, undeniably, and absolutely unaffected by Featherine    The Demonbane that exists within a universe without coming into contact with a universe    The Demonbane made of a bunch of tiny Featherines duct-taped together   Fuck right off.           LOL IRL.   kek  Fuck off.      No? Do something about it lil bitch.    So GER can win against Demonbane too? GER is even more broken. It's instant. Operates outside of space-time. Acts without even needing a command from it's user as it's autonomous. It turns anything that thinks of doing any harm to its user a potato. Unbeatable in its own universe.    I agree that some of the top-level characters are just as Special-tier worthy as Haruhi or Lain, but just calling someone "omnipotent" is oversimplifying. Let's use the Umineko witches as an example. Featherine has the power to edit reality at will. She is unquestionably omnipotent, she doesn't even have to come up with a cause for the effects she creates. Bernkastel has the power to cause anything to happen, so long as its probability is greater than zero. She's a god compared to most characters, but she's nowhere near all-powerful. Lambdadelta has the power to cause anything to happen, so long as someone is always working towards it. Lambda is not constrained by possibility, and so for the purpose of measuring power she could be considered functionally omnipotent, even though in practical application she's far weaker than Featherine whose power is completely unrestricted in scope and requires no time or effort.        That would fall under the category of 'impossible'. And Impossible is covered, so there's that.     yes    Remove Demonbane from reality   Remove Demonbane from anything   Wouldn't be the first time Demonbane came back from/ignored that.      powerman not at the top of every list    They are essentially gods but not unquestionably all powerful, so they top the chart but their being there is meaningful. Slot featherine into omnipotent. Slot myuugi into omnipotent. I've never seen the show with tenchi, but I've heard it said he's a god, so he goes too. That's what I mean, it's like the retards who argue that the infinity within the number 1 created by counting decimals is bigger than the infinity of just counting up. They've got no limit, what the fuck are you even arguing trying to call one bigger?    no separate entries for Demonbane adjacent to every other character  Everything is Demonbane. Demonbane can/will/has be/been everything     If you look at the official stats (punch force, jump height, etc) the Gaim riders are some of the more high powered ones, and Wizard is lackluster.       no ichigo or naruto   wtf?       erased from existence  Gonna have to try something else to deal with the big EGD.     You're pretty on point about everything there except maybe your examples of bern/34 could be better.   Bernkastel has the power to cause anything to happen, so long as its probability is greater than zero.  Because she can reset and travel through universes to find the one she needs.   Lambdadelta has the power to cause anything to happen, so long as someone is always working towards it.   This part is a bit weird. 34's power is opposite of Bern's. If bern's power is getting the 0.000000001% then 34's power is the strength and ability to assure that her will is imposed 99.99999999(100% before she lost to Bern possibly out of boredom).   The hard work stuff is just how her absoluteness takes place in the real world(she only grants her favor only to those who work hard and have unwavering wills of their success)            ikr?......smh.....    Their powerlevels are so negligible by comparison to pretty much everyone else in this list that they don't really belong here.    but they can just erase demonbane from reality  Has happened, it just willed itself back into existence. Elder God Demonbane and Featherine are both omni, don't know much about Myuugi but she sounds like an omni too.     While infinities are not equal, the problem is trying to compare them almost always degenerates to "my character could beat up your character" which was explicitly not the intent of the chart     That's what I mean, it's like the retards who argue that the infinity within the number 1 created by counting decimals is bigger than the infinity of just counting up.   I don't understand cardinalities      Has EGD ever returned back from turning into 0?     She is unquestionably omnipotent   No she isn't  Omnipotent characters have unlimited power. Examples of this are things like LoN where they literally are their multiverse and everything it it. In Umineko that's the Creator. Featherine is just below the Creator but she is not omnipotent.        You're confusing a difference in power with the scope of setting    This only applies to things in whatever series Myuugi is from though. It can't be applied to things like LoN/Tenchi. If Myuugi can destroy whatever multiverse they are from and everything multiverse associated with it they would be on LoN/Tenchi tier.   I'm glad that Ageha is on the chart, but I feel like he should be a smidge higher than the very bottom, considering where he is at his peak.   The only thing that I could see being meaningful in any sort of comparison of characters with unlimited power is whether or not their powers work on autopilot or if they have to do it themselves. That being said, an omnipotent being could of course just make it so that their powers work on autopilot since they can do anything.    Please tell me all about how there's a different amount of elements in 2 never ending sets. Once you put an amount on infinity it is no longer infinite.       The Creator is unquestionably the most powerful being in Umineko. They are omnipotent while Featherine is not.   http://vsbattles.wikia.com/wiki/Fea<wbr>therine_Augustus_Aurora</wbr>    vsbattles      Looking for any excuse you can to ignore Featherine's ability     The only difference between Featherine and the Creator is that one is a character.    actually arguing Umineko witches   when the whole point is that   they don't even exist in their own fiction     actually arguing in favor of fictional fiction      Alucard always has retarded placement on these lists. By the end of the series he can exist just by thinking he exists, and can simultaneously be anywhere, everywhere and nowhere thanks to schroedinger. Madara doesn't stand a living chance in hell against him even without those powers, as he would just be absorbed. Alucard should really be the highest tier before getting to reality warpers, because that ability is basically reality warping that can only be used defensively. Goku (even though he is stronger) can't beat him, sailor moon can't beat him, antispiral/tengan toppa cant beat him, etc etc etc  And it could even be argued that reality warpers cant really destroy him, unless they can negate the existance of the past before he absorbed shroedinger, which even then is iffy because of the open ended definition of the power.  If I had to choose, he would be in the special tier.         he can exist just by thinking he exists, and can simultaneously be anywhere, everywhere and nowhere  Literally any demon does this inherently.     No.    Throwing superman into sun gives him cancer so it would work in the long run.    Demonbane is higher on vsbattles than Featherine, first of all. The important thing is that Azathoth is Tier 0 despite not being able to destroy Demonbane, proving their incompetence.    That makes it sound like he's right. The difference is that featherine is a distinct entity, a character, while the creator sounds like a force devoid of any sort of personality or sense of self.    sailor moon higher than goku? By what justification?    Yes but Featherine is not that. That force is omnipotent and Featherine is not.     So Featherine is basically Void Shiki?     Then what would you say her power is?   Kingu soon  So have we got to the Post Ep. 64 5Ds of Arc-V now thanks to Sawatari?   No, one character that was always a joke continuing to be a joke doesn't mean anything.    Which is why I find it weird that KoA went with "Hi-Speed"     said character has now split the thread into arguments over whether he's a joke or not   people are starting to get fed up with it   More Shun and RR pushing   I've seen you niggers argue for 2-3 threads now on top of the constant Synchro Dimension is really lacking and starting to get dull arguments. It's quite clear it's starting to fade just like 5Ds did.        It's one anon complaining about it and a couple of other anons saying he's stupid. That's hardly the entire thread split on it.   Hey there. Dumping a dead scanlation. Chapters are usually 8 pages long. The raws look terrible, so I'd be willing to scan this, if anyone wants to work on it.  Previous works include Genocyber. Tony Takezaki's Evangelion parody anthology was recently published by Dark Horse. Aside from that, he also has a comedic Gundam anthology that's a few volumes long.   The hero is Dr. Kishiwada, a brilliant but demented scientist, who creates bizarre mechas, battles the forces of evil, or just mucks about. There are many parodies of B-grade sci-fi movies and of TV. Crazy, slick, and very funny.                   I thought i was the Jurassic Park of anime.   She appears in the movie.    No it was Kaiji with Jurassic Park    Jurassic park of the Yu-Gi-Oh genre    Remember is white.   ITT: Characters who deserved what happened to them  Deserved every second of suffering      two rapes?        Fuck EVERYTHING  A demoralised Kumiko is fine too.   Now that I think about it, they didn't focus on Shuu's reaction, did they.    Right, because she can't feel empathy.      That reminds me of Haruhi.    god, are japanese ugly without photoshop and centimeters of make up  Centuries of imbreeding do that to you. Almost as bad as English.   </blockquote>]
