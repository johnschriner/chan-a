[ So, with the incoming season. Whats /a/ expecting for this summer season?<br><br>In my case prision school  for the plot </br></br>  <br><br>Just like always, I will watch pretty much everything as it comes out, weed out the obvious garbage week one, then give everything else another episode or two until I've got my list pared down to the shows I enjoy watching. During most seasons I get sick of a title or two halfway through and drop it. Occasionally I pick up something into the season that I either never gave a chance to or dropped early on if there's good threads on /a/.<br><br>By the way, I wouldn't get your hopes up too high for Prison School. Funi licensed it, so they will likely be your only choice for subs, and I'm betting on a lot of censoring. <br><br>If that's the case I'll be waiting for the BDs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully I will be good. The only other thing I look forward to is Monster Musume.</br>  Everything in the Ultra Super Anime Time block, Teekyuu, a couple other short anime, Jitsu wa Watashi wa, Monster Musume, and Gakkou Gurashi are all sure watches. Looking at livechart/anichart/neregate, I can see a few others that look like I'll watch them, but there's a big difference between anime I pick up when it airs and anime I've been looking forward to for months or years. Plus I'm pretty lazy with my anime watching, so I accidentally drop series all the time. Hell, I skipped this Spring altogether for a little backlog and some Western media, even though I was looking forward to quite a few shows this season.  -Miia is Still Best (Deal With It)<br>-Dumbpires 'R Us<br>-Goth-Loli Goes to Ginza (unless they fuck it up, which they could do in many ways)<br>-Yamada!!!<br>-Classroom Crisis<br>-ShimoSeka</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh men, im also expecting something of gakkou gurashi, read the manga and is quite interesting</br>  I feel like I won't need to watch Prison School, just read the threads and watch the webms roll in.  <br>It's funi shit anyway. Just read the manga.</br>  I'm going to try at least the first episode of<br><br>Classroom Crisis <br>Monster Musume<br>Ranpo Kitan <br>Shimoneta <br>Charlotte<br>Overlord <br>Dandelion <br>Gakkou Gurashi<br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa <br>Prison School<br>Gangsta <br>Non Non Biyori<br>Million Doll<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127370359#p127372625">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How poor is she?  I want to kill this fucken cunt  <br>Enough to win my heart.</br>  Too poor to afford new bread  <br>Poor enough to have to resort to pleasing old men for money so she can buy perfume and lipgloss, to seduce even more men for money.</br>  Why is Yui never the one to bring it back up?  Now that's alpha.  <br>Isshiki Iroha pleases old men for money.</br>  <br>So I told Watari to write a threesome end.. he <br>actually did it the absolute madman<br>hahahahahahaha!</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino needs the excuse to interact with 8man</br>  <br>I kind of really want this to be her route in the VN.</br>  <br> MAX COFFEE = 130 YEN <br> ILOHAS = 65 YEN. </br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  8man deserves better than a poor waifu like Iroha.  Who else didn't expect a love triangle end?  <br>Fuck off, Luvia.</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Luvia still mad because she lost to a poorfag</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127361036 <br>Lol</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127361036 <br>How do you even fuck up that badly</br>  <br><br>I wonder if we had another season we'd get to so many memeposts that the thread would hit the bump limit within the first few minutes of its creation and nothing would be able to get discussed.</br></br>  <br>OHOHOHOHO</br>  <br>Guy who posted that. <br><br>Ignoring my awful grammar/spelling in those posts, there are many ways you can interpret her monologue. I just went for the most straightforward, "easy" answer but its hard to really know what she wants. But Yukino is the type to reach her hand out an ideal <br><br>Yuki is rationalizing the irrational and she never really has been in touch with her emotions until genuine speech I think. Even with Yui there was always a wall between them; I think Vol 12 Yuki is going to fully open up and she will act on her feelings and desires on her own accord which is the start of her necessary growth.<br><br>I think people tend to over exaggerate her problems and think we need volumes of material that her going into therapy and then doing something to redeem Hachiman and Yui for helping her. She just needs to act based on her own heart and desires more than anything. <br><br>As an aside, Yukino has 3 main animal affinities/symbolism in the novels: cats, bears, and believe it or not, fish. Cats eats fish, bears (Hachiman wants to be a bear rmbr) eat fish, and guess which character has fish eyes<br><br>The motto of the club based on ep 1/vol 1 was Teach someone how to Fish. The club was going to aid others with their problems but in a way so that they can do it themselves (be independent). The funny thing that happened is that in the end, its Yukino who needs the service club the most in finding her own path in life. She alludes to this greatly when talking to 8man about that fish during the aquarium date</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br> buy smartphone <br> doesn't work <br> passtime is shopping with random men <br>Rich slut</br></br></br></br>  <br>A shame Feel didn't animate Yukino hugging Yui's cushions and laughing at what Hachiman said about pasta at Yui's place. Feel really did dramatize Yukino's problems too much, though now that I've read up to chapter 8.</br>  <br>Translate for us?</br>  The whole scene with Yui at the end is gut wrenching. The anime magnified with the music and the fireworks.<br><br>  the way her hand trembles when she gives Hachiman his cookies <br>  "Even so, these are just a token of my gratitude" with so much feeling to her voice <br><br>God it really felt like it was her swan-song.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goddamn it feel<br>Can you translate it?</br></br>  <br> letting random men buy things for her after she pleases them <br><br>Why do you think she's so interested in what Hachiman's career ia going to be and how much he's going to earn?</br></br></br>  I hope somebody steals Yui by the end of the series. I want to see how Hachiman reacts to that.  On a scale of Taishi to Komachi, how close is Iroha to Hachiman?  What would 8man have to say to seduce either Yukino or Yui?  <br> Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball, wondering if senpai would like her scent and the color <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br> Wakes up at 4 to prepare herself for the date <br> She stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue <br> She is late to the date because she didn't get the train and preferred to save the money for the stylish cafe </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He can literally do anything to them and they would let him</br>  Actually establishing that Iroha is poor would make her more interesting to me. Probably not enough to move her past Yukino and Yui, but it give her more depth than "girl who constantly lies in order to get closer to Hachiman".<br><br>Doesn't the school have a tuition? It's supposed to be a pretty prestigious school isn't it?</br></br>  <br><br>Yukino:<br>  I know what you need. <br><br>Yui:<br>No words are necessary. Just make a physical move on her and she'd break down sobbing uncontrollable tears of joy then she'd put out all you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Poorfag <br> Anna Sui <br><br>It's just a meme. <br>Don't take it seriously.</br></br></br></br></br>  IIRC Watari always describes her cardigan as "worn" so maybe she is poor?  <br>Komachi, since she already knows 8man enough to pull a spot-on imitation of him</br>  <br><br>I know. I'm saying if there was something to it, she'd be a lot more interesting than she is now.</br></br>  <br> Yui <br>Anything in private that could be considered affection<br> Yukino <br>Just using the word genuine makes her panties melt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Spyro plz hurry</br>  <br>Yui is already seduced. She needs to seduce the 8.</br>  <br>I really hope that Yui will win at the end.<br>Underdog's victory is always the best kind of ending.</br></br>  <br>Why does Watari always look like he's perpetually stoned?</br>  Can Haruno pay 8man to have sex with her? What's his price if he does agree to it?  <br>Man, I thought her ship was dead. 8man stop her from killing it. It is going to hurt a lot if he rejects her in the future now that she is sailing again.<br><br><br>Then what does he need to do to Yukino?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think Haruno could seduce him without paying a dime. He gets all flustered every time she closes the gap and starts rubbing all over him.</br></br>  <br>How do you just namedrop designers like that?</br>  <br>There are far more indicators that she comes from a poor family. Which doesn't mean she can't save 4000 yen to afford a bottle of Anna Sui, all the more for a date</br>  <br><br>I hope his next novel series exclusively features a sly, foxy girl.<br><br>No more multiple love interests, I'm a Yui-fag and I feel like Iroha is a stellar character that needs to star a series on her own, from the very beginning.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The flashback to the fireworks combined with the music is what got me. I have nothing at all against Yukino or Iroha but I really hope Yui can pull out the win.</br></br>    <br>He simply needs to give her the genuine.</br>  <br> Man, I thought her ship was dead. 8man stop her from killing it. <br><br>Not only her ship but Yukino ship too.</br></br></br>  <br>Watari self-inserted too hard about her kouhai perfume</br>  <br> what does he need to do to Yukino? <br>Yukino do you want my genuine article?</br></br>  <br>I want to fuck her right in the cunt.</br>  <br><br>I get bi-vibes from Yui, or is just girls being girls with their skinship?</br></br>  <br>I dunno man, everytime Hello Alone plays I keep thinking, it wont end up boding well for Yui in the end</br>  <br>I'm also a Yuifag, but Iroha's only character development thus far has been that she somwhat liked one guy and now likes another guy. Besides being sly, there really isn't that much to her character.</br>  <br>Their seiyuus (Sakura Ayane and Touyama Nao) are a bit too close to each other<br>http://ambiseiy.com/2012/10/30/saku<wbr>ra-ayane-and-touyama-nao/</wbr></br></br>  <br>So you want to fuck Hayama?</br>  <br>Poor enough to please old men for money</br>  <br> Iroha's only character development thus far has been that she somwhat liked one guy and now likes another guy <br>Whoa, then you need to watch the anime again, or  read the LN  </br></br>  <br><br>I want to worship this fucking goddess.</br></br>  <br><br> says she's not a nice girl <br> everything she did was an 8man sacrifice ploy, that makes her a nice girl <br><br>Yui, please. You don't have a shred of mean girl in you at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, Yui is always in the middle of them, bridging them together<br><br> Help Yukinon if she's ever in trouble <br> Destinyland photo <br> Taking their hands for Aquarium Date  <br><br>Watari is going make it so that Yui bridges them one last time (but as a couple) isnt he</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Although this is pretty obvious,<br><br>Watari's twitter basically confirms that Yui did the whole proposal thing just to get 8man to react.</br></br>  <br> yuckyno  <br> goddess <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>that's Haruno nigga</br></br>  <br>She's ashamed of the part of her that did want her proposal to come true.</br>  <br><br><br>If "Hello Alone - Yui Ballade" plays at the end of her rejection it'll be the biggest tear jerker ever.<br><br>Speaking of which, is there ANY video out there with the slow piano version of it? I don't want to keep linking that guy's version, as it's not slow enough.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=L1r<wbr>8aj2XuoQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what it looks like.<br><br>She is, and will always be, the "link" between both of them.</br></br></br>  <br>In her date with 8man during vol 10.5 she kept all the receipts and tried to make them pass like student council expenses for making a magazine.<br><br>The worst part is 8man was probably the one who payed most of it.<br><br>She poor ;_;  or Chiba expensive. </br></br></br></br></br>  Who else didn't see the love triangle coming? At least it is over with.  <br> Haruno Yuckynoshita <br>You were saying?</br></br>  <br>This. She would have been fine with a lie, as long as they stay together.</br>  <br><br>I just love the back and forth banter, and her obviously fake "I'm a girl and I need heeeeeelp~!". I could see potential shenanigans in a new story with a heroine like that.<br><br>Maybe make her a delinquent at the same time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> heh </br>  <br><br>Hopefully it'll be a Yui being spitroasted between 8man, and a Yukino with a strap on.</br></br>  <br>Probably because Yukino has become dependent on it, as she said in her diary.</br>  <br>More like the school is so expensive she doesn't get much for allowance. Her parents probably both work overtime all the time just to be able to keep her in school, just like 8man's parents do. They'd probably get along pretty well.<br><br>On the topic, Ghamama seems to be a housewife so Gahadad must have a very good job.<br><br>And we all know the Yukinoshitas are made of money.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never knew the club had a motto/slogan? It barely gets mentioned at all<br><br> Yukino has fish symbolism <br><br>Well anons do think she'd be a fish in bed so it makes sense</br></br></br></br></br>  What does Iroha buy every time from the convenience store before student festival meetings?  <br><br>That still makes her a nice girl.<br><br>Her ideal was for 8man to break the status quo, and he did, raising Yukino's ship and rehabilitation in the same action, and on a meta level making Yui's ship stronger too, but she's an unreliable narrator whenever it concerns her, due to her low self-esteem.</br></br></br></br>  <br>didnt watari make a new LN with another author that combined iroha and yukinoshita and had sex with the mc and so on?</br>  <br>Because Yui lost.</br>  <br><br>Do we got any summaries of their work out?</br></br>    <br><br>I wonder how Yukino would respond if 8man one day said he found genuine (without her help) and he doesn't need her to do anything anymore.<br><br>Judging by her memorandum it would mind break her.<br><br>Also Yui doesn't bring it up because she knows her idea of genuine is different from theirs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui still loses even when she isnt in the fucking series</br>  She WANTS IT ALL.  <br>She went from a poser who was manager for the soccer club just to hang out with Hayama to become student council president so people don't look down on her. And while at the start she was struggling, after the Christmas event she became more of a leader to the rest of the stuco. 8man comments on this in the LNs and it was all with his help.</br>  <br>She WANTS IT BAD</br>  <br>She wants the threesome end?</br>  <br>I think she wouldn't. He is like the only friend she has.</br>  <br><br>FUCK, EVEN EBINA WANTS THE YAHALLOS.</br></br>  <br>Does Yui think that Yukino wouldn't be her friend anymore if Yui got 8man or vice versa?</br>  <br>Now that's beauty.</br>  <br> memorandum <br>What's the memorandum thing? the mini chapters about No Longer Human?</br></br>  <br><br>Her diary is hard to parse. What she says reads more like she's clinging to a specific interpretation of 'genuine', more so than the concept itself.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes, but of all endings, a Yui end seems the most likely for her to share 8man with Yukino.<br><br>Because Yui is a freak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What does it say?</br>  <br>How much work does ahe do herself? From what I've seen, she mostly bosses others around to do everything for her, except when it comes to flirting with boys.</br>  <br>Why do you think? Come on, you can do it.</br>  <br>I think Yukino could share, it isn't as if she has a nasty jealous streak.<br><br><br>What do you think her interpretation of genuine is? Blunt honesty? Maybe it is the same as 8man's.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm a cocktease troll, also don't forget to buy the LN, VN and BDs! </br>  <br>her character has grown on me from worst to best. <br><br>The main reason is that she's not as over dramatic as all the other people and she seems to be the most entertaining to be around. <br><br>With all the moping the other girls do (except little sister and older lady), I can't even see them enjoying a date without the baggage causing a scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The funny part is that she doesn't even go to the soccer club anymore (because "it's winter and it's cold"). She spends all her free time at the Service Club.</br>  <br> I think Yukino could share, it isn't as if she has a nasty jealous streak. <br><br>If it's Ice-queen Yukino no, if it's rehabilitated Moe-blob Yukino maybe.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think Yui believes Hachiman likes Yukino. The infirmary scene seems to have solidified that in her mind. We know that the truth is a lot more muddled, but she doesn't.<br><br>A lot of her behavior has to be understood in the context of that. She doesn't think she's going to get Hachiman's affections. Her willing to attempt to sink her own ship may be driven by that conviction.<br><br>If she thought 8man liked her more, she might be less focused on getting Yukino to confess her own feelings and more on trying to get Yukino to accommodate losing somehow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's Yui's definition of genuine? Does it ever specify what it is exactly?  <br>During the christmas event she wasnt even able to boss them around and they didn't really trust her, being younger and all. She's come a long way.</br>  <br> Even so, these are just a token of my gratitude <br><br>What is his reaction when Yui said that in the LN?<br>He looked unhappy in the anime when she said it was just to thank him.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> "C-Could you stop looking around my room so much...?" <br> "Huh? Oh, no, it's just there was some kind of fried spaghetti thing, see?" <br> "That's a room freshener..." <br> Hoh, so it's something like perfume for the room... Basically, it sucks some kind of perfume product and fans it out, not that I'd know. Heh, so girls have all kinds of stuff in their room, huh? I sat there impressed and I noticed the shaking of someone's shoulders at the corner of my eyes. <br> "Fried spaghetti..." <br> Upon looking, Yukinoshita was trembling with her face buried in her cushion. Come on, is that really something to laugh about...? As usual, she finds humor in the strangest things... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how 8man not sinking her ship makes her really feel. There will be more ambiguity to her feelings, which might hurt more since she might hope. <br><br><br>From what I understand the cookies really touched him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, but she still doesn't do anything or very little herself. Even getting the others of the StuCo committee to listen to her/take her seriously, was something Hachiman (and to a lesser extent Yukino and Yui) had to do for her.</br>  <br><br>  What do you think her interpretation of genuine is? <br><br>I don't really know. She doesn't clarify and it's hard to guess at it.<br><br>Another way of looking at is that Spyro was clunky in translating those last few lines. Thus<br>  Even so, there is something like an answer for us, so I decided to vaguely think of it as the right one. <br>  I don’t mean that half-heartedly, because I’m thinking of it as a prerequisite for the answer that should coincide with all our interests. <br>  I want to believe that is genuine. <br><br>The "I want to believe that is genuine" may be indicating that "genuine" is the answer she was talking about a few sentences before. In that case it would have been more clear if Spyro had written it as:<br>  I want to believe that answer is "genuine". <br><br>In other words, is the answer literally 'genuine' or is she hoping that the answer to her long train of rambling that all seems to be about defining 'genuine' is the right one?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cute, thanks anon</br>  <br>She did the whole magazine thing herself except for the actual writing which was done by 8man.<br><br>And it's not like the YY girls don't leave everything in 8man's hands as well.</br></br></br>  <br>What is it with snow girls and laughing at random shit</br>  <br>Talking Yukino into 3P is simple. Just frame it as a competition.</br>  <br>Not really, they respected 8man because he did all the shit. But after genuine and confession, she grew stronger and got their respect. When she asked to the vice about rejecting Tamanawa's brainstorming and he replied about not doong so, the old Iroha would have answered yes to his senior, but the new Iroha listened to him and decided on her own to reject jazz hands ideas and make a parallel event</br>  <br>That guy has been evading her date for months,<br>of course she won't believe that 8man may have any feeling for her.<br><br>Poor Yui will never learn that 8man get jealous too when guys are hitting on her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does Yukino know? Because most of his jealousy momnets are internal monologues. Like all his nauseated thoughts when thinking about Yuki and Hayama</br>  <br>Snow girls have no character otherwise so they gain a shoehorned trait that is otherwise uncharacteristic of them.</br>  <br>Stop.<br>Fuck, she needs to win.</br></br>  <br>True but I feel like outside the end of volume 9 we never got to see much more of that. Since then it's just been 24/7 sly kouhai.</br>  <br>Yuru Yui also comes to mind.</br>  <br>Yukino probably hopes 8man cares about her enough to be jealous of Hayama but she doesn't actually know</br>  <br> Does Yukino know </br>  <br> He looked unhappy in the anime when she said it was just to thank him. <br><br>Maybe he hoped the cookies meant more than just "thank you"</br></br></br>  <br>Divine beauty in fact.</br>  <br><br>That's a good question about what Yukino thinks of Hachiman's affections.<br><br>My gut feeling is that she's either totally oblivious or she thinks he likes her too because she reads their key moments together as being as significant to him as they are to her.<br><br>She also seemed unaware of Yui's affections for a long time. She seems to know by vol 11 though. I wonder if she knew it before vol 11 or if at some point during vol 11 she learns it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably knew that Yui wasn't telling the complete truth there and it triggered his genuine sensor</br>  <br><br>It's an endearing trait.</br></br>  <br>They only talked about the date in Disneyland, it's only been some weeks since then</br>  <br>He promised to take her out for sharing her honey toast during the festival, that's gotta be months at least.</br>  <br><br>He definitely saw through what she was doing. He knows about her romantic feelings and exactly why those cookies were given to him.<br><br>He got pissed when he spotted her attempting to put the batsuit on. That's doesn't necessarily mean he shares her affections, or maybe it does. We'll have to find out later.<br><br>What bothered him most though was her deceit. Her being dishonest about herself. That's what he's communicating to her in his speech. He wants her to be genuine, even if you have to agonize and struggle in doing so. The possibility of heartbreak for her is implicitly left open, but not confirmed either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  And then he went on a date with another girl, who happens to be the best girl.  I want to  playfully tease  moeblob Yukino  <br>Yukino found out during the sleepover most likely. <br> right before the sleep over <br>She tries to get Yui to stay so she can give her treats to 8man<br> the day after it <br>She tries to leave once she knows it is a date with 8man out of consideration, leaves Yui with 8man and the penguins, gets sad when she reads the penguin sign, and shakes her head when she wants to give him treats again while Yui was giving him cookies.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They were taking before about how if she returns the gratitude with a present hell have to return that one in turn and it would never end. She didn't mind, but he probably thinks it would hurt his wallet.</br>  <br>She's the second most rotten person in the world. She's 8man fem-version, damn it.<br><br>And more, she's drama free because she's not in the love triangle, so she can be (almost) full honest with 8man, so there's that too.<br><br>Kinda sad that 8man holds little to no special feelings for her whatsoever, except for big brother feelings.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Poor Yui will never learn that 8man get jealous too when guys are hitting on her. <br>I wonder how Yui would feel if she found out 8man gets jealous of other guys being around her or doesn't want her in any strange social situations.<br><br>I wonder if Yukino would be happy if she found out her got jelly over her too.</br></br></br></br>  Remove Haruno<br> Remove Haruno </br>  <br> She's 8man fem-version <br>In what way?</br></br>  <br>We literally just got to see a great deal of her ability in 10.5 and 11.<br><br>Yukino even compliments her by saying she's surprisingly capable, even calling the other school into the chocolate-making event to reduce costs.<br><br>Iroha's actually undergone an enormous amount of growth since her introduction, whereas Yukino and Yui have arguably regressed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to  kill  moeblob Yukino</br>  <br>Yukino probably didn't actually have the cookies in her bag, and just clutched at it reflexively from being reminded of them. Shaking her head was probably still a sort of "no I won't try to do that too, not right now" response though.</br>  <br>Heh thats how honey toast date started in the first place<br><br>Probably ~4/5 months</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well she had the cookies in her bag that day at school, then went straight to Yui's without going home.<br><br>Unless she left the cookies at school they're probably still in her bag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Having to actually face tough shit and being afraid isn't "character regression"</br>  <br><br>  She's 8man fem-version <br><br>I think that's Haruno.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean Qualidea's main girl?</br>  <br>Being completely dependent on 8man for literally everything is regression.<br><br>It's not just Yukino who has a dependency issue, Yui has it too. That's why she needed to goad a genuine speech out of 8man instead of just giving one herself.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to marry yukiblob</br>  <br> mfw Haruno is as interested about genuine as everyone else and is searching internally and externally for it because it matters to her </br>  I came into this thread just to have you guys' opinions on this, my friend suggested it to me the other day and I hadn't seen it discussed before:<br><br>What do you guys think the odds are of the source of Hayama and Yukinon's interactions is that they're being forced/coerced into a relationship/possibly marriage by their families?<br><br>The more I thought about it the more it seemed to line up. We don't know why the rumor started that Yukino and Hayama were dating beyond the fact that they were seen together. We don't know what they did and Yukino never elaborates (I will admit that this may be in reference to when Hayama was with Yukino's family for dinner).<br><br>Hayama and Yukino's families have known each other since they were both very young and they grew up together, Since Yukino's family is so rich it's safe to assume Hayama's is as well. Yukimom is always seen in a yukata and their being rich means they have enough leisure time to still actively pursue traditional Japanese things and probably still have a very conservative sense of how young people should marry/be in relationships. That much seemed to be confirmed when Yukimom confronts Yukino outside her apartment.<br><br>So what are the odds here? Is this a total shot in the dark? Have you guys discussed it before? It was just something I hadn't thought of and it's been spinning in my head ever since</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you were 8man would you extend the situation as long as you can so you can hang out with all those cute girls or would you bite and get together with one and leave the others alone?  <br>Samefag here. This would also explain why Yukimom says she's afraid Yukino will "choose the wrong path". Haruno knows about Yukino's feelings for 8man and likely told Yukimom. This is why Yukino is so hesitant to confess her feelings. She wants to avoid the conflict of going against her family's plans.</br>  <br>And she did all of that....<br><br>Just for the Club's photo.</br></br></br>  <br> Yukino even compliments her by saying she's surprisingly capable, even calling the other school into the chocolate-making event to reduce costs. <br>So once again, letting others do shit for her and also to ensure that she doesn't have to pay from her own pocket. How admirable.</br></br>  So was this really the end? Watari ended it here? No epilogue or nothing? He really blueballed us didn't he  <br>She does talk about how the guys her age are superficial and never question her while 8man can look behind her good girl façade</br>  <br><br>If I were 8man<br><br>Considering Yui and Yukino, I'd probably just keep with the situation, occasionally tearing up and muttering about genuine to keep the ship rolling and their panties melting.<br><br>Once I settle on a girl I'll pick her and then when it looks like the other girl is drifting away I'll just cry about genuine one last time to bring her back in the fold.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's been a theory for a while now, and it's mentioned in more detail in Vol. 10 of the novel (covered by episodes 10 and 11 from S2, albeit in rushed fashion). Basically Yukino explains to 8man that yes, her family wishes to maintain a close relationship with Hayama's family, but it doesn't necessarily have to be through marriage. One alternative is through a career, and that's why Yukimom is all up in her business about her class choices.</br>   2 knock outs like him <br> one is a 11/10 gorgeous long haired beauty <br> the other is a 9/10 cutie but with a 11/10 body <br>What is the problem? Why do people think he is suffering?</br></br></br>  <br> what is a still ongoing LN series </br>  <br> who the hell does she think she is, using her leadership position to lead people like that? </br>   Yukino end get <br><br>Now the wait for S3 in 2 years.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>I knew there was no way it wasn't a theory by now, it seemed way too obvious after I thought about it. I'm interested to see how it plays out.</br>  <br>Because he's a raging retard who won't accept either</br>  <br>I don't think it's something like an arranged marriage, but Yukimom would probably be very pleased if they do get together and probably voices it all the time.<br><br>Hayama's dad is a lawyer and Hayama saying he's not allowed to choose meas he's set to become a lawyer too, which would work perfectly to succeed Yukidad as a politician.</br></br></br>  <br> but not doing a single thing herself, Sagami2.0 </br>  <br><br>She might still think Hachiman is in love with Yukino exclusively.<br><br>He acted the way she expected to prevent Yui from pressuring Yukino to give up. From her point of view he might have done what he did because he prefers Yukino and doesn't want to lose the chance with her. In her thought processes her expectation of him intervening may have been tied to that conviction of him liking Yukino.<br><br>If she failed to pick up on him seeing completely through her plan, that is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Delegation is considered high level work.<br>Why do you think manager get paid more compare to grunt work?</br></br>  <br> sagami <br> leading </br></br>  <br>Because both of them are crazy and they are best friends, ensuring there is no way out of this without at least one broken heart.</br>  <br><br>Do I need to cry about genuine to you too? I'll do it you know. I'll cry as many times as I need to.</br></br>  <br>Well, so are the other two.</br>  <br>Actually, i'll admit that regression isn't wrong, but your use if it was. They have moved backwards as people, but only temporarily and as part of a longer forward advancement they've been going through for at least 5 volumes now. Using it to imply they're worse characters simply because your waifu has only ever moved forward is completely disingenuous.</br>  is 8man suppose to be the nips holden caulfield?   mfw I like all girls    specially Iroha   <br>I don't really mind who wins in the end as long as it's well written. Yukino has more chances to win right now.</br>  <br>Had Hachiman held her hand throughout the process as much as he did for Iroha and considering all Iroha does is boss others around, yes, Sagami would have been effective, however since Sagami is a ginormous cunt an not a sly manipulative girl like Iroha, people wouldn't put up with her shit for long.</br>  <br>Why are they both crying?</br>  <br>There's a difference between leading others to do stuff and doing nothing and letting them decide what to do.</br>  <br>Truck-kun came to reap Yui.</br>  <br>I would probably end the situation as soon as possible and not pick either. I would quit the club ASAP and tell them I found genuine so there is no reason to show up anymore. I would focus on my studies and taking it easy for the rest of my time.</br>  <br>Sorry, I sounded badly.<br><br>This anon is more right <br>, but I meant that they were both kinda the same type of person (when they first met), they even had lots o things in common (exemple householding).</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not asian</br>  <br>Goddammit, why did it have to be the fat old men?</br>  <br>Tell my why not?</br>  <br>That artist in particular loves drawing faceless old men. His girls are cute though.</br>  So many words. So much ambiguity. I don't understand what the fuck is going on.<br><br>Can someone explain in layman's terms what the fuck happened during that final scene with the cookies.</br></br>  <br>It's not worth figuring out. Even when you get it, you would be like "THAT'S what the fuss was about? So fucking stupid"</br>  <br>The one who was fem 8man at the beginning was Yukino, until they both realize exactly just how different they truly are.<br>Don't know what you mean by householding though.</br></br>  <br>At least they came to pay their respects.</br>  <br>How can you tell?</br>  <br><br>8man and Yukino were (and still are) alike in their circumstances in the beginning. I mean both are loners and 'monsters of logic'.<br><br>But even from the beginning they were different in their ideals and their way of going about dealing with things.<br><br>That being said, comparing Iroha to 8man is silly. Iroha has some insight into the Hachi-mind, but she was never and is nothing like him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait for when it's Goro.</br>  <br>Which is a crying goddamned shame.<br><br> Dem fangs need to fuckin' go though </br></br></br>  <br>Yui tells Yukino in the vaguest most roundabout way possible that if she doesn't confess right here right now then it'll come down to whoever wins the "who can help the most people" contest the whole club was started on. Hachiman knows that'll never work because Yukino doesn't want someone making decisions for her like that blah blah blah it's retarded. If I ever met someone who was that vague and insincere about everything I would avoid them at all cost</br>  <br>I'm not being disingenuous because I specifically used the word "growth" to indicate beneficial change, not "development" to indicate general character progression.<br><br>Whether Yukino and Yui's regression is only temporary is nothing but your personal conjecture. Currently the only fact we have is that in their current state they're arguably less functional as people than they were at the beginning of the LN.<br><br>Granted  was arguably talking about general progression, but frankly he's a moron anyway for thinking that Iroha's student council duties haven't been relevant since 9.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man tried to hold Sagami's hand, all it did was make her cry.</br>  <br>Iroha is Komachi, and because she's Komachi she gets a very good insight into 8man's mind even if she's not 8man.</br>  So, will the series continue after the cliffhanger?  <br>Depends on how many more volumes of the LN come out. Author is starting a new series soon though so I imagine not.</br>  <br>Watari's contract will end, and so the light novel will end with nobody understanding anything</br>  <br><br>The LN will. We've got at least one more volume coming. Perhaps more. The more volumes we get the greater the chance of a S3. Most don't seem to expect more than two more volumes at the most.</br></br>  <br>Here, m8.</br>  <br>When does she see 8man's thought process or solutions?<br>All I remember is her getting mad at him and Yukino for ranting in the middle of the Christmas event.</br></br>    <br>It's because patriarchal societies like Japan love to see old men revel in their authority.</br>  <br>The point is you still tried to use the girls' current state to depict them badly and make Iroha seem better by comparison<br><br>And if you're really going to try and start an argument that somehow Yukino and Yui's current state ISN'T temporary, we're done here. I don't feel like wasting my time on someone deluded enough to argue that Watari will turn this narrative on its head. I'll even give you as much that there's a non-zero chance of it happening, but to actually bet on that is crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>That's because you don't like girls.</br>  <br> threesome with Yukino, You, Iroha <br> 8mans watches them walk off together laughing </br></br>  <br>The only thing I don't agree with is the "She's already given up in the 8man bowl" line. She clearly wants a fair fight and wanted Yukino to finally step up to the plate.</br>  <br>She's so poor she couldn't even afford to get a role in the first season with the real girls.<br><br>She's that poor.</br></br></br>  <br>Some specific instances off the top of my head is how she gets him on a date by making it a part of work, picking up on him being into younger girls/siscon, and her pretty spot-on imitation of him during vol 11. (Cut by FEEL, of course.)</br>  I can't stop staring at her tiny mouth.  <br> You </br>  <br>POVERTY-CHAN OR DEATH</br>  <br>Arranged marriages are not genuine if the party members dont have feelings for the other</br>  <br>Reminds me of Chihaya's fit of laughter in im@s</br>  shaa~  <br> Biased towards Yukino <br>Otherwise, it's okay. Needs a tl;dr version.</br></br>  <br> It's not looking good for my girl <br> hurr durr bias </br></br>  I need this Iroha card.  <br>Who said anything about trying to start an argument? I merely explained my reasoning after you accused me of being disingenuous.<br><br>You shoud stop getting angry at people for saying things you disagree with on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>Feelings can come after the marriage tho</br>  <br>And just who do you suppose 'my girl' is? Because I can assure you it's neither of the two female leads.</br>  <br>The fact you think it looks good for either one of them says you're biased.</br>  <br>http://a.uguu.se/aqmguq_shaaa.webm</br>  How would you describe their respective types of cuteness?  <br>True but I dont think Yukinoshita would want it for obvious reasons. Even moreso if it involved Hayama</br>  <br> http://a.uguu.se/aqmguq_shaaa.webm<wbr></wbr> <br> ehh <br> The file you were looking for is not here... <br> It probably expired or never existed, check your URL. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck it died</br>  <br>genuine<br><br>fake</br></br></br>  <br>shaa~ denied</br>  <br><br>I can still see it through 4chanx embed.</br></br>  <br> can <br><br>What if it doesn't?</br></br></br>  <br> Yumiko <br> Yankee/Delinquent looking boss girl <br> Fiery personality <br> Actually motherly and kind </br></br></br></br>  Is that why Iroha really wanted 8man to become a publisher? Because he'd be bringing in the dough so Iroha can live a non poor life once they marry?  <br>They're both gap moe.<br><br> Yumiko seems moody but is actually really caring <br> Iroha seems fake but she's actually genuine </br></br></br></br>  <br>A Sugawa with worse taste?</br>  <br>Your reasoning was completely ridiculous, as is your assumption that I'm angry because I used the phrase "start an argument"</br>  <br> Yankee/Delinquent looking boss girl <br>delinquents with drill hair is the new meta</br></br>  <br> publisher <br> bringing in the dough <br>She wanted to keep her job of pleasing old men for money so she's deliberately pointing 8man towards a shitty job</br></br></br>  <br>go back to /d2g/</br>  <br> Publisher <br> Dough <br><br>Are you 12?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or at least a Chuuni.</br>  <br>That's the average age for an Irohafag</br>  <br>Closest thing to orcs you can get.</br>  <br><br>I just don't think this guy has it right. It would take an equally long amount of text to address everything he wrote. But especially at the end he gets it wrong.<br><br>When Yukino says "Don't you tell me how I feel" she is talking to Yui. Specifically she is rejecting what Yui was trying to do earlier by trying to force Yukino to back down (of course that was just her surface effort, she was obviously relying on Hachiman to step in). Not acting like she doesn't have feelings or being disingenuous about her feelings for Hachiman. You could say she was being disingenuous in acting like she wasn't about to succumb to Yui's pressure. She still hasn't confessed them, but she is not denying them in that moment.<br><br><br><br>How is it biased towards Yukino? That guy obviously is not a Yukinofag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Publishing Editor* I meant...<br><br>They're talking about jobs and the publishing Editor position comes up. Iroha says she plans to marry one then suggests that 8man become one</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually I made that judgement because you thought it was worthwhile to make an entire post of pointless insults and accusations.<br><br>Why are you even posting at this point? You clearly have nothing to say about Oregairu anymore.</br></br></br>  Everyday until I'm bored.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/tplqqbrcmf.mp4<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>I wish they would release OVAs or something.</br>  <br>のだけれど</br>  The only way to resolve this is for Hayato to man up and get with Yukino already.  <br><br>Do you think he will? That actually sounds pretty interesting, I wouldn't be against the idea of him coming in and sweeping up Yukino. It's definitely not outside the realm of possibility, at least.</br></br>  <br>Then it's revealed 8man's true goal was Yumiko all along.</br>  <br> constantly lies in order to get closer to Hachiman <br><br>Read the fucking LNs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No sir, apparently it's you who needs to read them.<br><br>Everything she does to get closer to Hachiman is hiding behind this "I love Hayato" lie. It's just lie after lie after lie from her. There's nothing sincere about her behavior towards Hachiman.</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like he settles for Yukino since Haruno is out of reach</br>  <br>money bitches.</br>  <br><br>I would bet everything on if Hayama ever actually switches his affections from Haruno to Yukino for whatever reason, he will get rejected by this point.<br><br>It would be amusing to see though. Hayama rejected old doll-Yukino years before then falls for new-and-improved Yukino but Hachiman has already got her.</br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand FEEL's marketing.<br><br>Why would they toned down all the Yui/Iroha scene? <br>Just compare their scene in vol 11 with the LN and the atmosphere feels entirely different.<br><br>If they are trying to appeal to the Yukinofags then why are all the goods they sell are Yui related?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He said he love Y <br> mfw when Y is Yukimom </br></br>  <br><br> They know who is going to win from Wataru </br></br>  <br> why are all the goods they sell are Yui related? <br>Are you positive about that?</br></br>  <br>Yui has more merch because bigger tits and her birthday, despite this Yukino and Hachiman seem to have sold better.<br><br>Also WW was helping with the anime with some creative directing since Vol11 wasn't even released.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying there are any author is spoiling his own story before he wrote it themself. </br>  <br> Everything she does to get closer to Hachiman is hiding behind this "I love Hayato" lie. <br><br> What's volume 10.5? <br> What's the club magazine? <br><br> there's nothing sincere about her behavior <br> tells him she only asked out Hayama because of Hachiman's genuine speech <br> told him she wanted to find genuine with HIM <br><br>Read the LNs, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui has more pixiv art too.<br><br>Dunno man.</br></br></br>   /a/ on 6/18 <br>Hahah Yuifags should an hero. Her ship is burning<br><br> /a/ on 6/28 <br>Looks like she has a shot now. She may not win but her ship is still sailing<br><br>What happened? You are all hypocrites.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> every anon is the same <br><br>Do you remember when people thought the spoon scene was a rejection from Hachiman? Blame denialfags who believe anything 2ch says.</br></br></br>  Ok brothers. Seeing as Iroha doesn't have a real chance at the 8man, do we form an allegiance with Yui or Yukinon?  <br>The manga (Vol7) has a full body shot of that and I love it.</br>  <br>I'm a Yukinofag and I thought the final scene looked pretty damn good for Yui.</br>  <br>I didn't though</br>  <br>Possible Watari has already said how it ended.</br>  <br>He should have been sitting in on the script writing conferences so I doubt they'd be able to get away with such massive Yukino flags without Watari's consent.</br>  <br><br>What's this about vol 10.5? You mean when she got Hachiman to go on a date with her by pretending it was some sort of practice date for Hayama?<br><br>And the magazine? Where she acts like she's fixated on getting photos of Hayama?<br><br>She doesn't tell him she wants to find genuine with him. She just vaguely says "I’m starting to want something genuine too."<br><br>Still you cite a tiny handful examples against almost every other Iroha moment in the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Even if this is the case,<br>this still doesn't make sense.<br><br>If I were them I would make it as vague as possible so that all the shipperfags will buy the BD.<br><br><br><br>Look up the BD pre-order special illustrations,<br>all of them has Yui in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I am starting to suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.</br></br>  <br> some sort of practice date for Hayama? <br><br>READ<br><br>THE<br><br>LNs<br><br>I'm convinced you just parrot what you just selectively repeated what you heard in these threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow, you're right, and for the whole box set too. <br>Maybe Feel decided to dedicate season 2 to Yui as a consolation prize for losing the 8bowl.</br></br>  <br><br>What the hell, you may just be right.<br><br>I mean if you look at all the patterns and connections, it starts to seem like that might be true.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If I were them I would make it as vague as possible so that all the shipperfags will buy the BD. <br> Being even more vague <br>No one would know what the fuck is going on in anything if they were even more vaguer.</br></br></br>  <br> losing the 8bowl. </br>  <br>Care to make another prediction for volume 12?</br>  <br>Not really. The triangle got dissolved at the end of EP 13 so all ships and shippers are dead, save for Iroha.</br>  <br>Who has the all the panels of this</br>  <br> You mean when she got Hachiman to go on a date with her by pretending it was some sort of practice date for Hayama? <br>Ah, no it wasn't a practice date for Hayama, it was specifically "research" for dating spots that match 8man's preferences. <br><br>She barely even used the Hayama excuse, only mentioning him when saying she'd prefer to go places where Hayama normally wouldn't, or to spell it out to a retard (i.e you), she wanted to go to places where 8man wanted to go.<br><br> And the magazine? Where she acts like she's fixated on getting photos of Hayama? <br>Ignoring the fact that it was made an obvious parrael to 8man's obsession with Totsuka? Nice reading skills there faggot, I bet repeating fifth grade so many times must have been a trying time fort you.<br><br> She doesn't tell him she wants to find genuine with him. She just vaguely says "I’m starting to want something genuine too." <br>Ignores the fact that everything about that conversation was revolving around 8man, and how he personally effected her. Subtext, try using a dictionary for once in your life. If that isn't beyond your reading skills of course.<br><br> Still you cite a tiny handful examples against almost every other Iroha moment in the series. <br>Mirrors, they are a thing. You know you can stop pretending like you read the series (or can even read at all) at this point. Every poorly thought out word is just making you seem more and more retarded. Quite funny in my honest opinion.<br><br><br>That's some pretty powerful stuff you're on anon, the amount of wrong in there is quite mind boggling. <br><br><br>That's a lot of conjecture you're making anon, you sure you got enough evidence to back that up?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Except that entire scene symbolized that he chooses Yukino over Yui. The one he stands beside is his life partner remember? They all saw the sign. He left Yui and went to Yukino's side. ;_; <br><br>That fucking idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT I NEED THIS</br>  <br>Yui tells him to leave and follow Yukino in the LN. He then talks to Yuki where she tells him that she might not be a wandering fish anymore<br><br>But end result seems the same (Yui once again bridging them together)</br></br></br>  Does anyone have a link for the manga raws?  <br>Yui has had way more merch than Yukino since long before her birthday. And I'd like to see where you get your "sold better" from aside from what I assume is the keychains they sold during the ita-train event.<br><br>The big tell for me is the figures, where Yui has two upper-end figures to Yukino's one. Basic business sense says if Yukino was more popular the situation should be reversed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>  He then talks to Yuki where she tells him that she might not be a wandering fish anymore <br><br>She says she might NOT be a wandering fish anymore?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Once I started thinking about it I couldn't come to any other conclusion. No one seems to have a counterpoint so I guess I did research it well enough.<br><br>I don think it is possible that she just wants to be friends, really strong friends.<br><br><br> That's a lot of conjecture you're making anon, you sure you got enough evidence to back that up? <br>This LN is vague and very few things are outright stated. I gathered up a lot of evidence to support my conjecture, it stands to reason that Yukino likes 8man romantically.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's some pretty powerful stuff you're on anon, the amount of wrong in there is quite mind boggling. <br>Where am I wrong? I said:<br>Love triangle has been dissolved<br>YY Shippers/Shipping is dead<br>Iroha is alive</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui doesn't understand genuine because she's dumb as a post so she tries to avoid anything related to genuine like the plague</br>  <br>Your bait is too obvious.</br>  Thanks for the advice on toning down the listens to Harumodoki. It helped, but I rebounded way too fast. I think I'll accept my defeat to Yanagi Nagi again.    <br>I have 4 versions of it on repeat. There is no escape.</br>  <br>Is Irohasu a sly creature?</br>  8man, you know what your answer should be.<br><br>It isn't the expected answer nor is it the correct answer, but it is the right answer.<br><br>Anyone else agree? Do you think he should shoot for the moon consequences be damned?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh how I hate that word.</br>    <br>Man at least mix it up a little. Throw in Yuki Toki and maybe some of NagiNagi's other stuff. Like Vidro Moyou, for personal preference.<br><br><br>Goddamn right he should. Polyamorous relationships aren't easy to balance but there's obviously enough love between the girls to make it work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck are you even talking about?<br><br><br>Okay, I layed the Iroha part on thick but I still think the love triangle is dead. There is no reason to believe it is still on unless I completely missed the point.</br></br></br></br>  Hayato needs to die be made into a doll then get raped.    <br>My body is ready for Ebina's doujin.</br>  I didn't understand one goddamn second of this season.  <br> Vidro Moyou <br><br>How is she so good? Now I'm tempted to watch Ano Natsu.</br></br></br>  <br>Does Yukino know what genuine is?</br>  <br>surely you understood yuimom was the best grill and that SYNERGY was required for COHESION and POSITIVE THINKING.</br>  <br>She's my idolfu. Stay away.</br>  Who wants to be genuine with me?  <br>JUST LOOK AT HER ASS AND SKIN FOR FUCK</br>  <br>If you think this logically through logical thinking you'll reach the conclusion that it was very conclusive</br>  <br>The hand gesture guy I understood, yeah. That was it, though.<br><br>I'm not even sure who's a girl anymore, never mind best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Be careful anon, down that road lies only suffering.<br><br> It was great actually. Except for the part where Best Girl won and my heart was still torn into a thousand tiny pieces. </br></br></br>  <br>Yui can't win because 8man never developed feelings for her due to her saying she liked someone else in the beginning of the series; which was actually 8man, but he didn't know that at the time.</br>  Can someone explain the penguins and how they relate to everything? Why did the girls react to this? This show is too fucking vague for me.  <br>This was the fucking easiest analogy in the fucking episode. Penguin couple = 8man has to choose one of them</br>  <br><br>I prefer the Yui and Yuimama oyakodon ending.</br></br>  <br>Drama for the sake of drama. Symbolism for the sake of symbolism.

We all have to read the paragraphs the few who actually understood it wrote to get a gist of what's happening.</br>  <br> implying nips stop buying merchs if their waifu lose the MC <br>Do you know waifu is not only for shipping right?</br></br>  I'm honestly surprised and sort of disappointed that /a/ likes this show so much. Just goes to show you how low the average age of anons is nowadays    <br>It was quite obvious. 8man is going to die alone.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DI3<wbr>u7g8PPEA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Still better than Yukinon requesting you to buy the LN ending</br>  <br>Thanks for your opinion anon. We'll take it into consideration.</br>  <br>If you actually look at the post count in these threads, it's almost always the 100~ or so people making 24/7 threads a day.<br><br>It's really weird when you think about it, since only stuff like Fate warrants so much discussion and shitposting.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, looking at the IPs you're right. Thanks, makes me feel a bit better about the state of /a/.</br>  <br>I suspect she does. She keeps hinting towards it, and she's the only one who even mentions the whole genuine situation, which leads me to believe that she may be on to something.</br>  <br>Why did you show me this</br>  <br>This poor thing makes me want her to win even more.</br>  <br>Then why did the girls react like that? <br><br><br>Does Yukino want the genuine? How invested in it is she?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She wants it so badly (for her own sake and for his)</br>  <br>They reacted like that because it's basically calling out their love triangle neither of the girls want the other to win if it means ruining their friendship.</br>  <br>My new wallpaper</br>  Who is the superior younger girl? Rumi, Keika, Komachi or Iroha?  <br> 944x955 wallpaper </br>  <br>Why do you have a square monitor</br>  <br>Rumi.</br>  <br>It means the 8bowl is already over.</br>   To fill up the silence, Yuigahama quickly said, “Let me think about it and I’ll tell you later!” <br><br> “…Y-Yeah.” <br><br> Was it relief or indifference? Perhaps, something much more different? <br><br> Whatever it was, since I had let out a deep sigh at the same time, Yuigahama didn’t wait for my response, walked a few steps ahead, and opened the door to the clubroom. <br><br>I don't understand.<br>Can someone explain me what is 8man thinking in this scene?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That bad? I know genuine touched her but it isn't as if she thinks on and on about it or him.<br><br>I guess that is the reason she brings it up whenever she can. Maybe she thinks of it as a link to 8man.</br></br></br>  where's my usual sakibros?<br><br>shipping aside, how would yukino resolve her issues to stay on par with yui recent advance?<br><br> inb4 nurutu/twgok bowl winner </br></br></br></br>  <br>I see you falseflagger</br>  <br>Hello brother. It has been a harsh month, like usual.</br>  <br>Ah, a Sakifriend<br><br>I have been wondering, does Saki have a crush on 8man? If she does what is the extent of it? Would she ever confess? Would she accept and 8man confession?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, all signs from both the anime and LN point to her having a crush on 8man. In the LN, given his interaction with her siblings, she probably would be willing to accept an 8man confession. However, I doubt she will confess.</br>  <br>yes<br>she likes him romantically<br>yes<br>yes</br></br></br></br>  <br>He can't understand Yui's reaction.<br>The reason she acted like that is because she remembered Yukino.<br>8man doesn't know that she saw him and Yukino in the infirmary when they were face to face.</br></br></br>  <br> However, I doubt she will confess. <br>A shame, I want to see 8man deal with it somehow. I don't think Saki is all that conscious of her feelings.<br><br>I can imagine 8man picking one of the girls and Saki finding out about it. She would feel kinda down and not know why.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> but why <br>fucking lost it<br><br>man i fucking love this board</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hope watari insert some romcom where 8man incidentally meet keika and saki. hijinks ensues and saki thanked him for  fulfilling her request <br><br><br> will she confess <br>hardly<br><br> would she accept a confesison <br>certainly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Burn heal!</br>  <br> And so, the penguin searches for what is genuine. </br>  Does yukino treating 8man for his knee fall into the penguin behavior as well?  <br>kek</br>  <br>Oh shit didnt even think of that</br>  Please don't click on the button.<br><br> http://www.myinstants.com/instant/s<wbr>ore-aru/</wbr> </br></br>  <br>Would Yukino have let 8man kiss her in that scene?</br>  <br>She would've went with it in the moment but once her hormones go down she'll be tsun but happy</br>  <br>She's the one who leaned in. You could even tell it in the LN.<br><br>Somehow 8man didn't notice however.</br></br></br>  <br>would yui have let him kissed her during the head hug?<br><br>probably yes for both cases.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>So Yukino could've won the 8bowl right there if she was just more assertive?</br></br></br>  <br>B R A V O W W<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O<br>W<br>W</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like she leaned up. to look at him, probably around the same time he leaned down.</br>  <br>That would have been genuine, so yes.</br>  <br>She can't really be assertive if she can't even understand her feelings</br>  <br>nice meme</br>  How will SNAFU end?

Don't remind me, feels like they keep getting more and more shows every season.  If only actual fansubbers still existed.  <br>If I wish hard enough do you think the fansubbing scene might be revived?</br>  FFF will save us<br>Press F to pay respects</br>   joining <br> Denpa Kyoushi's retarded english title <br><br>But they already had it</br></br></br>  I would have subscribed to the Funimation sub plan if they had Chromecast support. I think they even have Death Parade dubbed already.  Why is Rampo Kitan spelled with an n or an m in some places?  I wish we had fansubbing.  <br>I wish I had Horo!</br>  <br>Don't we all<br> AI robot waifus when </br></br>  <br>aside from Overlord, shimoneta and prison school I couldn't care less.</br>  <br>Everything on that list is trash anyway and here I thought funi would ruin this season.</br>  <br>In Japanese, n and m are interchangeable.<br><br>For example senpai/sempai.</br></br></br>  <br>Now the real question is how I have watched anime for so long and not noticed this</br>  <br> overlord <br> trash </br></br>  <br>Not another Funigeddon, the last winter-season was bad enough.<br><br>Also I remember Funi cutting out lewd scenes from Seikoku no Dragonar which were still there in other raws, so that makes me worry for Prison School.</br></br></br>  <br>Gangsta is on that list, also even though Overlord may be trash I'm still going to watch it.</br>  <br>Prison School will just be a black screen for 20 minutes. The only animation will be Funi's title screen.</br>  <br>If FFF is so great where's my euphonium?</br>  <br>It's not a real FFF release if you don't have to wait at least 6 months for the last episode.</br>  At least the quality of translations will be far better. Silver linings.  <br>Good thing I don't mind Commie.</br>  <br>justlikeaplan.jpg</br>  <br>Better than what? Google translate?</br>  Has there been any faggots that tried to publish series in webms?  It's a sad world when your only options are shitty Funi rips, Comeme and FFF's 1 ep every 2 years  <br>I don't think I was looking forward to any of those shows in the first place.</br>  Nothing good besides Akagami no Shirayukihime.  <br>Are you that Funifag who has been defending this shit?</br>  <br> hardsubbed <br><br>Is that true? So HS will finally upload only .ass files to be watched with the Raws?</br></br></br>  <br> paying for this </br>  <br> Aquarion Logos <br>Well, shit. The one show that's guaranteed to have fun threads and I dread funi getting.</br></br>  As long as neither of the final two shows are Gakkou Gurashi or Monster Musume, I'm fine.  <br>And Vivid is two episodes behind Kekkai Sensen. Fuck me.</br>  <br>I never understood where people got the idea from that Funi actually has good translations.</br>  <br>I'd rather wait for a properly prepared meal rather than just have all the ingredients thrown in a blender and have the sludge microwaved.</br>  <br>There are always the mighty OCR-Senketsu subs.</br>  <br>God bless you moot.<br><br>Even with faggots such as Daiz, Jebus, Lelouch and even Bedford here, it wouldn't be /a/ without them.</br></br></br>  can we make these BTB threads? i love them and i have lot of fun with them thanks  <br> Both FUNi and CR have issues with quality, but they do fare a lot better in terms of release consistency than fansubbers for fairly obvious reasons - they get materials in advance so that they can put episodes up at the same time every week  <br>They not. Especially funi. You can have however many material in however much advance, but if your translators and typesetters suck big cock - funi doing 100% of time, and CR like 35 to 45 - then you still will be getting shit. For money. Fuck them and fuck you.</br></br>   yfw fansubbing is dead and no one will save us <br><br>Time to get back to learning nip</br></br>  <br>dank</br>  <br>Then I'll wait for other groups to release their Funi edits or Senketsu ripping the script. Go suck on a turd with your hardsubs and shit video quality, Funi.</br>  <br>It's impossible to watch it even for free, and you want to pay them for it? Fucking cancer.</br>   no Dragon Ball Super simuldub  <br><br>Are they literally retarded?</br></br>  <br>It's still funicrap. you can't fix that.</br>  <br>But I can at least run my word-replace-script over the subs if the need arises. <br><br>Duct tape subs!</br></br></br>  <br> senketsu <br>Except funi's translation is actually also still shit.</br></br>   posting from your phone <br>Leave.</br>  <br>It's only cosmetic changes, you can't fix translation without re-translating it.</br>  <br>Well FUNi does certainly seem to capable of messing up scheduling on its own too, which is pretty inexcusable, but a lot of that shit comes from Japan's end generally speaking, like with contracts being signed at the last minute or after a show has already started airing or materials delivered late etc.<br><br>Anyway, you seem to think that I'm saying CR and FUNi are somehow better quality-wise than fansubs, which is very much not what I'm saying. But they do generally beat fansub releases in speed, and they could do the same in terms of quality too if they actually cared about it, but unfortunately they very much don't seem to.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, tripcodes are important, because otherwise you wouldn't be able to filter the worst of the low quality posters that easily.</br>  <br> Bedford <br>Didn't he die?</br></br>  <br> Denpa Kuyashi got localized as Ultimate Otaku Teacher <br>Holy shit. The show can't get any worse than it already is, please stop beating that dead horse.<br>And wait, what the fuck. It has 2 cours?</br></br></br>  <br> And wait, what the fuck. It has 2 cours? <br><br>Just think about all the shows that only got 1 cour, anon.<br><br>And it's not like Denpa Kuyashi is going to sell better than those did either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Moot's a jew and a cuck and his opinions are shit. He said it himself in that video. The current idea that total anonymity is a platonic ideal of 4chan developed over time, so the original situation of everyone being a tripfag is irrelevant. All that matters now is that the only tripfags left are just attention whores who should be banned for attention whoring.</br>  <br><br>Commie is still here.</br></br>  Will we ever get new chapters again or will SNK forever keep eating a bag of dicks?  No one cares?  It's dead forever, sorry OP.  SNK have been dicks since forever. SE counter sued though. If anything it'll stay dead for a big while longer at least, until the lawsuit actually concludes.  <br>Think it'll actually resume and not just die?</br>  <br>what exactly happened?

You fucking Tamamofag.</br>  What makes a good request? because Ive seen some of these requests here for months and they haven't been touched.  Requesting Pitz doing something adorable like balancing on a beach ball, please  <br>True.

Thanks for considering. <br>http://imgur.com/NwtfVql</br>  <br>Fusion requests are way too specific.

Doing the right thing some of the time does not permit you do try to make this your own deviant art page.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno it's pretty strange, but I'll try my best. I apologize for any chicken scratching.<br><br>Head and chest are okay; arm is a bit long and hands are a bit awkward; lower body is pretty odd. The hand on the leg seems pretty awkward. For the other hand, keep in mind that the hand opens and closes in a spiral, so you can usually trace an arc across the fingers' position. This can be employed to make any hand pose much more convincing.<br><br>The lower torso seems like it's just coming forward and like the legs are way too far apart. The legs also have some weird rhythm going on that I don't really follow.<br><br>The pelvis's orientation should not follow the chest's orientation unless she happens to be sitting, squatting, or lying down. In this case, the bottom face of the pelvis volume should be tilted away from the viewer relative to the chest volume. Note that the curve of the spine affects the orientation of the volumes that are attached to it (mainly the rib cage and pelvis).<br><br>The legs look weird as hell; I think the shins are far too short. In profile they're up against the skin, so the right leg's outer contour should be pretty straight as well. Legs should have a more downward orientation.<br><br>Take it as yo will; they're just another beginner's observation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the brush tool<br><br>If you're using the line tool you're probably doing it wrong</br></br></br>  Shima-tan as master asia<br>Nyaa-tan as domon</br>  <br>Is this Boa being a senpai to Smurf?

I am learning and trying to improve so I'm thankful people are merciful.</br>  <br>Really? I'm perplexed, would you care to elaborate what is probably wrong with it?</br>  <br>Appreciated but you're posting that a bit late, already fixed the main problems like the legs </br>  <br><br>Besides the fact I was supposed to go to sleep when I first posted it, so I'll take my leave now, I'll read your post tomorrow.</br></br>  <br> already fixed <br> fixed <br>I told you, give up. The perspective tool can't save the drawing. Just accept that your attempt was bad and move on to another request, rather than filling the thread with "okay, I tried working the pose with the perspective tool. It's better"</br></br></br>  <br>Line tool is going to produce very mechanical looking lines without variation in width, which is vital. It can sometimes be useful if you're making objects with uniform lines like, say, a desk, but even then you're just as well off shift+clicking a straight line in.<br><br>You certainly can play with the line tool to produce line width, but the vast majority - maybe all - pro artists will just draw with the brush/pencil/etc tool.</br></br></br>  <br>personally I recommend sticking with lineart for awhile simply because it helps you get the underlying form better. No matter how much you polish if it looks off people will notice, and that's one of the reason smurf's art in particular is so disgusting to most people.<br>Even sharkbro is a good example of this although his forms are far better. The reason people don't say sharkbro is the best artist in these threads is precisely because he has so much polish while sacrificing the underlying drawing and he knows it too, I don't mean it as an insult to anyone who does it because its a popular way to get more notice especially when you're at that point where its easier to polish than perfect your forms.<br><br>you're good though monsterbro while you're still quite lacking in many areas you're getting better and I hope to see good things from you soon. Try to keep that in mind though in case you fall into the polishing a turd trap.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What? The line tool does have width variation, default even.

Sure, little girls suffering and all. I get it, but there isn't any decent intrigue going on, the action is sparse as fuck and the art is bland and boring. It not that I think the show is shit, but there's nothing there to keep me going either.

Remember that this isn't taking into account their toddler years, so really their period of highest sexual activity is from age 15 (when a girl loses her virginity) to 30 (when she becomes gross, old, and/or married).<br><br>So say from 15 to 30, an average girl fucks about 50 different guys over the span of fifteen years.<br>Now C.C.'s Geass power is literally to have people fall for her, so raise the number to 300 guys in 15 years. That sounds a lot but I'm actually being generous, considering her power: that's only 2-3 guys a week.<br><br>Assuming C.C. was born around 500 AD, and modern day is 2018, that's 1518 years.<br>1518 years, divide that by periods of 15 years (highest sexual frequency for girls), and multiply that by 300 men.<br><br>(1518 / 15) x 300 = 30360 men<br><br>C.C. has literally fucked 30,000 men in her life.<br>That's fucked up.<br>Assuming she has sex not just once with a man, but also multiple times with the same men, you can multiply that again by 3-4, and including gangbangs perhaps even higher.<br><br>So potentially C.C. has fucked 30,000 men for a total of over 100,000 times.<br>She's had sex 1/10 of a million times.<br><br>=<br>Oops I fucked up my math.<br>Assuming 2-3 guys a week<br><br>79205 weeks in 1518 years<br><br>so 79205 x 3 men = 237k<br><br>C.C.'s had sex with almost 250,000 men, and assuming she has sex with the same men and including gangbangs, she can have sex 1,000,000 times in total<br><br>=<br><br>C.C:<br>-You can be as rough as you want when fucking her, she just heals right up.<br>-She has tons of sexual experience, she will milk your cock like no other<br>-Can't contract any STDs<br>-Won't age<br>-Won't get fat<br>-"fulfill your contract anon-kun, cum in me"<br>-probably can't get pregnant either</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What will she do if she doesn't get one?<br><br><br>Ok</br></br></br></br>  Can we have Leila too?  <br>what</br>  <br>Nice pasta<br>Do have in mind that C.C. didn't get to use her geass for that many years since she got the code, lost her geass and got tired of all love bullshit.<br>C.C. still best regardless.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think your theory is flawed</br></br>  <br>And I want to tongue her bung hole, but we can't all be winners can we</br>  <br> Most girls fuck approximately ~50 different guys by the time they're 30. <br>It's like you're 5.</br></br>  <br>She would probably get a bit sad, but that ain't enough to get her down</br>  What was her real name?  <br>Unfortunately, I don't have any Leila I second this</br>  <br>I only have a couple</br>  <br> Most 3DPD girls fuck approximately ~50 different guys by the time they're 30 <br>FTFY</br></br>  I did always prefer C.C. over Kallen.

Episode 3 states she has never used it before.</br>  <br>Science is frightening.</br>    Honestly I don't think I could fuck/make love with CC. Not in the sense that she's my waifu, but because she established a very strong non-sexual identity for herself over the course of the story, and the sudden emergence of her sexuality would weird me out.<br><br>I guess it's like thinking about fucking my sister, except I have no problem with fucking my (hypothetical) sister.<br><br>Actually I guess I'd fuck CC too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a tragedy of existence that this amazing zipper technology does not exist in real life</br></br>    <br><br> anus tail <br>I hate this shit, no pun intended.</br></br></br>  And now lets get Marrybell in on the fun<br> Thers no Oz fanart </br>  <br>that doesn't answer why christmas cake exist</br>  <br><br>Huh. I hadn't watched Ep 3 so I didn't realize she had her own Geass. <br><br>I guess that explains some of her insane person actions in the episodes previous to that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because procreation is a natural fulfillment you autistic fuck.</br>  <br>Well, it was implied since the credits of episode 1 showed a scene of her meeting C.C. in a forest.</br>    There are official subs on the akito bd, why has no one uploaded it yet?  <br><br> C.C.'s Geass power is literally to have people fall for her <br>I do not remember this at all.</br></br></br>    <br>Well, the nips aren't gonna upload it. Its a waiting game for now until someone who will upload gets their copy.</br>        <br><br>Yeah that jogs my memory a little bit. Of course I knew she had a Geass, I just didn't remember what it did.</br></br>  <br>Anon I just want to see a pure-hearted CC thread why must you trigger my fetish so</br>  <br>And Oldrin</br>      <br>is it fuckin out???</br>    <br>PSN rip has been out for weeks. Just no one subbing it.

CC still the best CG.</br>  CC = Cock Craver  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>I haven't watch CG in a long time but<br><br> Can't contract any STDs <br>Is this true? I know she can't die, but couldn't she spread STD to others?</br></br></br></br>  Best girl  <br><br/></br>  <br>This gotta be the most interesting discussion this thread can hope to spawn.</br>  <br>Cock Connoisseur </br>  <br>Cavernous Cunt</br>  <br><br> her name is literally "plop" </br></br>  <br>Ninja CC</br>  All this talk about CC and next episode of Akito makes me want to rewatch the series again. I fucking hope they announce something good at the 10th anniversary  So did Lelouch and CC ever actually do it?  <br><br>Probably</br></br>  <br>Do what? Change the world?</br>  <br>Be smug assholes? All the time.</br>    <br>They're doing it to this date.<br>Lelouch is not dead, we all know that</br></br>    <br> potentially <br>And I've potentially had time in my life to murder hundreds if not thousands of people</br></br>    <br>Shit, I kill millions every night.</br>  <br><br> Do what? <br><br>you know, the DO</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is this so hot?</br>  <br>It's not really a Code Geass thread. It's a Code Geass female thread.</br>  Why the fuck is youtube suddenly recommending me code geass videos? Is google fucking watching what's going on my screen?  <br><br>Always watching.</br></br>      <br>Anyone who denies this needs to rewatch the show. It's so obvious.</br>  <br>The sword penetrating his abdomen makes it obvious he survives?</br>  <br>A very survivable wound, shall I pull up reports of people surviving being impaled through their heads?</br>  <br><br><br>And what about the end of Phantom of Inferno?</br></br></br>  is there a new CodeGeass series or something?  <br>Just that movie series.<br><br>And a very dedicated fan artist.</br></br></br>  <br>The next Akito episode is out but subs never</br>  <br>gg subs when</br>  <br> A very survivable wound <br>Also a deadly wound. Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>His death was never confirmed onscreen and a body was never shown.<br><br>It is extremely possible that he is alive and just faked his death. Lelouch is the master ruseman after all</br></br></br>  <br> possible <br>Maybe, but that's not what was initially said.</br></br>  I am not leaving until you fuckers tell me her name.  <br>It was initially said that Nunally was dead, Charles was dead, Marianne really was fucking dead but came back regardless through her Geass.<br><br>You can't trust anything this show tells you. It is quite likely that Lelouch is alive.</br></br></br>  <br> Lelouch is not dead, we all know that <br/></br>  <br>Can't be alive if you're a ghost</br>  So is that new series worth watching?  <br> ___C.C.__ </br>  <br> Non-canon <br>Notice how Suzaku is there too despite Kallen apparently killing him and he now assumes the identity of Zero?</br></br>  <br>It's great and Leila is lovely</br>  <br>Its canon, bro.<br>Also, Suzaku was never shown to have been caught in the explosion. Unlike Lelouch, who died on screen before his sister.</br></br>  <br>Lelouch is probably not dead. We have seen that C.C. was wounded in her flashback in church so it's easy to assume that to truly activate code after transfer someone needs to be mortally wounded (Charles was killed by lelouch in Sword of Akasha before we have seen his code) And until killed that person runs as normal geass user.<br>And to all people but Orange and CC, Suzaku IS DEAD.</br></br>  <br> Charles was killed by lelouch in Sword of Akasha before we have seen his code <br>Actually, no. Charles did that to fuck with Lelouch. During Lelouch's elaborate Geass scene, you notice that the "brainwaves" or whatever you want to call them, don't change to show Lelouch's command takes hold. Just like when he tried to Geass C.C. during season 1. The Code was already active from the moment he got it<br>Nothing in the series implies the "Need to die to activate code" theory.</br></br></br>  <br> Actually, no. Charles did that to fuck with Lelouch <br><br><br>That's the ambiguous and questionable part. He could have easily let himself be enslaved by Geass knowing that his death would activate the Code, not necessarily having to hilariously act out the part like you're assuming. The proof isn't conclusive either way.<br><br>Death seems to be involve quite closely with Code transfers. V.V. died after Charles took his and the Nun was in a pool of blood after C.C. got hers too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>V.V. was already mortally wounded and didn't have a chance to heal. Nun was crazy annd probably killed herself.<br> And in Renya of Darkness, when Shiori got Dash's Code, she didn't die to get it and became V.V. </br></br>  <br><br><br>Yet C.C. says something to the effect that the name of V.V. will continue or that said person will carry on the lineage. I would need to re-read that part and what happened with Dash.</br></br></br>  <br>gg ded</br>  <br>Where did charles's code go to?</br>  <br>Not to Lelouch since he still had Geass</br>  <br>No one knows, obviously. It could've disappeared with him in C's world.<br><br>I wonder if we'll ever find out if U.U's code is still in the R1-R2 timeline</br></br></br>  <br>I thought that Dash had U.U.'s Code, which went to Shiori who became V.V. which eventually passed to the current V.V.<br>Of course, Akito the Exiled also just gave us the Administrator, so who knows.</br></br>  <br> Of course, Akito the Exiled also just gave us the Administrator, so who knows. <br><br>If I had to guess, I don't think she even needs a Code in the first place. It seems she's a being from another plane of existence. <br><br>Just like how there is a Memory Administrator with a blue straightjacket living in the World of C as a distinct entity from C.C. <br><br>By the way, that thing on her neck is a physical necklace in the shape of the Geass symbol, which is present elsewhere throughout her clothes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Administrator <br>Explain</br></br>  <br><br>It hasn't been explained yet.<br><br>That's merely how she is listed in the credits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shes a new character from episode 3. She has a connection to Geass andgave Shin his. And she can teleport. Thats all we know.</br>  <br>Did nobody see CC kneeling at the end scene and giving LeLouch her immortality?</br>  <br> She has a connection to Geass andgave Shin his <br><br>That last part is rather uncertain so far. I'm under the impression Shin must have stolen something from them or otherwise hurt her faction. <br><br>We do need a better translation since I'm not getting that sense from the couple of non-English subs I've looked at.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>To illustrate the point.</br></br></br>  <br><br>U.U. is such a bad name but I guess it works with the scheme they have.</br></br>  <br>Its fine,  if it was the 70's </br>  I was OP of the pizzabutt thread last night. I think I'm banned. Test 123  <br>With U.U, the Administrator and stuff like the Holy stones, I wonder if they'll ever explain where it all originated from and if they still exist after R2</br>  Rejoice! I'm not banned! Mods = gods. To be fair that thread blew up a lot faster than I thought it would. /a/ apparently still loves Code Geass and C.C. more than I previously thought.  <br>When does the belly dancing occur?</br>  <br>Who knows? Oz the Reflection isn't really focusing on such stuff so I'm not really expecting anything on the matter there. Maybe in the next spin-off if we get one.</br>  <br><br><br>Guessing you were accidental collateral damage of that trainwreck thread someone started after your first one</br></br></br>  <br> /a/ apparently still loves Code Geass <br>I don't think /a/ will ever forget 2006-2008</br></br>  <br><br>b-but anon, I was OP of the trainwreck thread.</br></br>  <br><br>That looks like a dude about to throw a woman in a fire</br></br>  <br>Of course the thread blew up. You should know better than to invoke that meme.</br>  <br>Then you should consider yourself lucky that someone punished the sin but not the sinner. <br><br>I would have done some very impolite things to you.</br></br></br>  <br><br>C^2 is always watching over me!</br></br>  That was depressing as fuck. Neverending fucking hype and then you get smacked in the face with that death and grievance scene. <br><br>I wish Lelouch lives but I don't want to set myself up for disappointment so I'm gonna assume he died.</br></br>  <br><br>It's set up for interpretation so either outcome is fine.</br></br>  THERE ARE FAGGOTS ON /A/ RIGHT NOW WHO DOESN"T KNOW CC  <br>I think Episode 3 of Akito.</br>  <br>She saved your skin but not your poor excuse of a thread. Which should tell you something.</br>  <br>No, it really wasn't set up for interpretation whether he lived or died. He died.</br>  <br><br>From the official Sunrise Panel at NYCC 2011 (via http://bayoab.info/live/old.php?pan<wbr>el=219): <br><br>12:58:03 &lt;bay|NYCC|Sunrise&gt; Q: At the end of Code Geass R2, does lelouch really die?<br><br>12:58:21 &lt;bay|NYCC|Sunrise&gt; A: Actually, as you can probably tell by watching the series, we leave that up to the viewers opinion<br><br>12:58:56 &lt;bay|NYCC|Sunrise&gt; I think the best part is you can debate and discuss</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>It's clear symbolism. Lelouch as Zero dies, he passes it on to Suzaku. Lelouch himself lives on, to live forever with C.C.<br><br>Or you can just think like a faggot and say he died, but that's not something Lelouch would ever do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"The only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to be killed"</br>  <br><br>He did kill himself. <br><br>The question is what comes next.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lelouch would want to live on to see the world he created, not die and risk everything for potentially nothing.<br><br>Use your brain. His plan had a large percentage of failure, because this is the world we are talking about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you not pay attention at all to his final confrontation with Schneizel?</br>  <br><br>Lelouch was never assuming that the plan meant the world would be without troubles from here on out, but that doesn't necessarily mean he had to stay. Even if he were alive, I doubt that's his concern.</br></br>  <br>Well, next came him coming back as a ghost to visit his friends.</br>  <br><br>I am kind of glad that they kept the whole gypsy dancing but didn't try to pull off that move in the actual episode as opposed to the preview.</br></br>  <br><br>That's the special with Jeremiah as the narrator and the characters even noticing him? I think it breaks the fourth wall too much.</br></br>  <br> Actually, as you can probably tell by watching the series, we leave that up to the viewers opinion <br> I think the best part is you can debate and discuss <br>Why the fuck do people do this fucking shit. Endings open for interpretation (actually open, unlike the Sopranos ending) are fucking garbage.</br></br></br>  <br>Picture dramas are all canon. Especially since the end gives us a glimpse of what his friends are up to post series.</br>  Why give a shit if he's dead or alive? We will most likely never find out because it's pretty obvious there will never be a sequel. It wouldn't surprise me if they've even scrapped the movie, but hopefully they're considering a retelling of R2 for the 10th anniversary  <br><br>haha shut up</br></br>  <br>Sunrise actually seems to want to expand the Code Geass world what with Akito the Exiled OVAs and has the ongoing Oz the Reflection manga/photo novel side story.<br>They provide want Code Geass to be their second Gundam.</br></br>  <br><br>I disagree with that. I think endings open to interpretation are just as fine in anime as in live action TV. Even way after and way before Blade Runner for instance.</br></br>  <br>'cause they want to have it both ways. They don't have the balls to commit to one ending or the other so they make it ambiguous. <br><br>Kind of like the whole Euphie thing which allowed the to keep Lelouch as Zero without making him too evil with the whole thing being an accident.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the oddest of all picture dramas. <br> 'cause they want to have it both ways. They don't have the balls to commit to one ending or the other so they make it ambiguous. Kind of like the whole Euphie thing which allowed the to keep Lelouch as Zero without making him too evil with the whole thing being an accident. </br></br></br>  <br>The only thing that comes from it is uncertainty and people throwing poorly-constructed arguments at each other. Fuck it.</br>  <br>Unless Sunrise makes a statement saying its not, its canon.</br>  <br>No really, shutup.</br>  <br> 'cause they want to have it both ways. They don't have the balls to commit to one ending or the other so they make it ambiguous.  <br>That's your view, but it's not the point. This is a show full of deception, manipulation and trickery. It's quite fitting with the rest of the material to leave some mystery in the air.<br><br> Kind of like the whole Euphie thing which allowed the to keep Lelouch as Zero without making him too evil with the whole thing being an accident <br><br>He was still pretty evil though. Nobody forced him to kill Euphemia and lie about it. That, plus his own initial anger towards her, was all him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> le ghost maymay is canon <br><br>Even for Code Geass this is stupid as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd kill for that but they need Taniguchi on the team. And most of all, they need the majestic soundtracks to return, the Jazz is killing Akito for me.</br>  <br>There's nothing odd about ghosts showing up in anime. Gundam came before Code Geass and Newtype ghosts are practically regular occurrences. Did you watch Gundam Unicorn?</br>  <br> It's quite fitting with the rest of the material to leave some mystery in the air. <br>Know what else would be quite fitting? Lelouch dying based on what he said in the first episode. <br><br>The fact that you think it's consistent doesn't mean it should be ambiguous.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Taniguchi doesn't like to repeat himself (unlike Okouichi) and the man himself thinks new people should make more Code Geass rather than just him. He could do something more, but don't expect too much.</br></br>  <br>Its not even the only instance ghosts in the franchise. Akito spoke to ghosts at the end of episode 1 and Oz the Reflection recently had a chapter where characters interacted with a ghost.</br>  <br><br>Gundam = Code Geass<br><br>Cause there is a lot of Ghosts in Code Geass.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lelouch says many, many things anon. <br><br>That's only part of his way of thinking. And even if he somehow survived that doesn't mean he didn't die. He's still giving up his entire past life and identity, which is fitting given how "death" has been interpreted figuratively (ie: Lelouch was "dead" in the eyes of Charles right from the start, etc.)</br></br></br></br>  So does this mean C2 is fucking Lelouch's ghost?  <br> Became V.V <br>Wait what? I didn't see any of this in the manga. What chapter is that?</br></br>  <br><br>Code Geass is not Gundam (that's far bigger than this ever has been) but it is a popular enough secondary property for them to keep alive at least every few years.</br></br>  <br>I'm so tired of retards on this site being illiterate.</br>  <br>There are actually</br>  <br><br>I would like you to reconcile that line with a lot of other things Lelouch says and does then. Because the show does present more information that makes a simplistic reading too shortsighted.</br></br>  <br>Oh wait I guess I missed this page</br>  <br>Final chapter. C.C. remarks about what will Shiori do as V.V.</br>  <br>Doesn't Taniguchi and Okuichi work on Oz together? Taniguchi also worked on Renya so maybe not all hope is lost yet</br>  Lelouch not dying clashes with one of the central themes of the show; that all men who kill must be prepared to be killed.  <br>You could say the show presents so much information that you could glean any meaning you want from it, and then use that to justify whatever ending you want. <br><br>Wow. Imagine that. There goes your retarded consistency argument.</br></br></br>  <br>No, new writers. They do get consultef and get some say in things though.</br>  <br>He did some of the initial planning for Oz. That's all.<br><br>Renya is weird and quite low key. Officially, he did write the story. But the Japanese say that what Taniguchi did in Renya was basically lend his name and an outline to Takuma Tomomasa's work. It has more similarities to Nightmare of Nunnally than to either of Taniguchi's works or the TV show.</br></br></br>  <br><br>At least I have brought up two specifics though. The use of lies, which is something Lelouch absolutely never gives up on, as well as the figurative uses of death (Charles says that to Lelouch, Lelouch says that to himself in a monologue, also to C.C. when he knowingly goes into Cornelia's trap, etc.).<br><br>Is there anything you want to elaborate on?</br></br></br></br>  Outside of R1 and R2, where else has C.C. appeared in that is canon?  <br><br>But Lelouch did die after all. The question is whether or not it must be a permanent death or a figurative and metaphorical one. The show also places a lot more focus on other themes, such as Lelouch's trickery and deception, than on his strict adherence to that standard. He is not supposed to be an icon of morality.</br></br>  <br>Renya of Darkness and a flashback in Akito the Exiled where she gave Leila Geass.</br>  <br><br>Okouchi hasn't done anything related to Geass in a long time. Taniguchi did write two new picture dramas for the BD boxes (unsure if anyone has ripped those).</br></br>  <br><br>There's a very short manga whose name I forget that also has C.C. in it.</br></br>  <br> At least I have brought up two specifics though. <br>You've brought up two specifics relating to why Lelouch lives, not why the creators were justified in making the ending ambiguous.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, that's a different story. There's nothing written in stone regarding filmmaking or literature that condemns ambiguous endings as a rule. Even many that are far more abstract, vague and artsy-pantsy than this one. It's up to the viewer to decide if they can tolerate ambiguity or not.</br></br>  <br> There's nothing written in stone regarding filmmaking or literature that condemns ambiguous endings as a rule. <br>Nobody said there was. What are you even going on about.</br></br>  <br><br>The implication behind your objection seemed to be that ambiguity is the equal of cowardice.</br></br>  Instead of fighting, can't we instead talk about how C.C. is the perfect waifu, if not only for Lelouch.  <br>4chan.org/banned next time</br>    <br>Scan never<br>;_;</br></br>  Akito Episode 3 out on AB, most likely out on nyaa in a few<br><br>[Code Geass Boukoku no Akito][03][JPN+ENG][BDRIP][1080P][H<wbr>264_FLACx2_TrueHD].mkv</wbr></br></br>  <br>Awesome.

He outright says(Or thinks, really) "I can't beat her! Even using the Geass I'm cursed with! You're strength is imessuable, Kallen." Those are his exact words.<br>So he wasn't holding back and was trying to win.</br></br>  <br>They both lost the battle, but in the end Suzku completed his objective while Kallen failed her objective.</br>  <br>Duh. She didn't.</br>  <br>Yeah. There is also another thread on there of people bitching about Geass too.<br>As a mecha fan, I do hate /m/</br></br>  <br><br>mecha isn't even that big of a part in code geass, for instance it doesn't even exist in the manga.</br></br>  <br>Oz would like a word with you.</br>  <br>What the hell is that retarded logic? So if a guy who is trying to stall someone gets Into a fistfight with the person hes trying to stall, and gets his ass kicked, he somehow doesn't lose the fistfight because he successfully stalled the guy?<br>Nigger that's not how fights work.</br></br>  <br><br>is that some tripshit on /m/?<br><br>Tell him to suck my cock</br></br></br></br>  <br> not knowing about OZ <br>sasuga /a/</br></br>  <br>No its Oz the Reflection. Its basically to Code Geass what MSV is to Gundam</br>  <br>No, you bloody moron. The Oz CG manga.</br>  <br>That parallel was the dumbest shit I've ever read.</br>  <br><br><br><br> gay fujoshi spinoff <br><br>no thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Kallen did lose in the long term. Throughout the series she always relied on KMF specs and you have to be pretty dumb to not notice that</br>  <br>That is basically exactly what is being said. Even if Lelouch won in the end, Kallen still won against Suzaku. Show even states through Gino Kallen won.</br>  <br> mpv <br>Wow.</br></br>  <br>  Fujoshi <br>You know the protagonist is a girl and a lesbian right? Theres even an image of her sleeping with another girl in this very thread.</br></br>  <br>But in this case both of them got their asses kicked as they couldn't continue to fight. One of them "died" and one got knocked unconscious with an almost destroyed Knightmare.</br>  <br>Suzaku was using an older model, as stated by Kallen. <br><br>Although he did have the Geass "don't die" advantage.</br></br></br>  <br><br> gay yuri spinoff <br><br>no thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Winning the battle but losing the war." is what happened. Really, Kallen won the fight, but the outcome of that fight was insignificant from the start no matter who won. The real final confrontation that mattered was Lelouch against Nunnally.</br>  <br>The spec difference wasn't that big. Both were 9th gen KMFs. Its not like the performance difference is as dramatic as between 9th and 8th gen.</br>    <br>VLC is even worse. My god.</br>  <br>How did Kallen win when both KMF's got destroyed and both of them couldn't continue fighting? Suzaku also didn't die.</br>  <br>Well for one, only Lancelot was destroyed, by Guren ramming a fist through the chest. Suzaku only managedto make the Guren lose power while the Lancelot Albion was destroyed.<br>Show also has Suzaku admit Kallen got him and has Gino say Kallen won</br></br>  <br><br>who cares. why are discussing this /m/ trash on a C.C. and Lulu thread.<br><br>Kallen and Suzaku are both third wheel trash and belong together as the cucks of Code Geass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't start that shit again.</br>  <br><br> vehemently denying known truths <br><br>heretic</br></br></br></br>            <br><br>L O N D O N<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That's no plug</br>    <br><br> King and the Queen, and the manwhore <br><br>Was Suzaku anything more?</br></br></br></br>  <br> everyone blushing except Lelouche <br>And people think he isn't gay.</br></br>  <br>dat rhyme doe</br>  <br>He seems kind of asexual if anything.</br>  <br> Lelouche <br>Fuck.

Lelouch showing up was just a bonus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime characters, people?<br><br>Surely you jest.</br></br></br>  <br>Are there a lot of Knightmare fights? I know from the PV that Suzaku fights the Britannians, but are there any other fights?</br>  <br>Thats the only fight in ep 3<br>There will be a lot more action in ep 4</br></br>  <br>Alright, thanks.</br>  <br><br>Urgh, are they still using the shitty CG? Reasons why I haven't watched the OVA's in the first place</br></br>  <br>A bonus that made it worth watching Akito, at least for me.<br><br><br>Why would they change it halfway? It's not that bad, honestly. It's the music in my opinion</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Animation looks really good. What's wrong with the music? Why don't they just reuse tracks from R1 and R2?</br></br>  <br>No clue, if something was perfect with both R1 and R2 it was the soundtrack. Even with CG it would've made the fights much better</br>  <br><br>Yeah the ost is up there with Sagisu's work on NGE and Bleach.<br><br>ALL HAIL BRITANNIA!</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ykp<wbr>DQhWlrBQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br>Makes me wonder what Code Geass could've been if it didn't fall down the excessive fanservice trap. It was already good. Could have been something really amazing, top tier really.<br><br>They had to rush too much because of those fucking filler fanservice episodes and moments.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, what the fuck were they thinking when they decided to replace the soundtrack.</br>  <br>Akito's CG is technically excellent, probably up there with the most well made CG in anime.<br><br>But, I find the visual direction of it really off putting - non stop spinning around the mechs and perspective changes, it feels like it never just stops to focus on something clearly, it honestly gives me headaches. It's like their solution to the 'uncanny valley' aspect of CG was to hide it by nevr giving you time to see anything for more than a few seconds.</br></br></br>  <br>It was pretty top-tier<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TWn<wbr>0nF-PFcE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br> no Hitomi <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yzK<wbr>qIARheTA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o8L<wbr>PK6nh0rU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder if they themselves realize they created one of the best and most fitting soundtracks.<br><br><br>I really wonder why they stopped using rifles as much and stuff like Slash Harkens<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=t2t<wbr>GEiYU9KU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=apf<wbr>OHi_dC_Y</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>good soundtrack. top 3 anime tracks have to be<br><br>1. bleach<br>2. nge<br>3. code geass<br><br>death note is alright but its range is too limited</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OCH<wbr>rZ_HPXy0&amp;index=19&amp;list=PL1C5A5C8D35<wbr>2096DD</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  <br>Damn Lulu is still fabulous as fuck</br>  <br>The worst part about it is that the Jazz music makes it fucking worse.<br><br>Whatever they decide to do, a movie or whatnot, if they continue to use that shitty Jazz music it will never reach the TV series</br></br></br>  <br> You will never have a girl who wears a straitjacket around the house </br>  <br><br>I wish she would just wear nothing. C2 has that fucking perfect body, tight, fat ass, and flowing green hair.<br><br>perfection</br></br></br></br>  It feels out of place how the Euro-Britannians are complete opposite of the main islanders and are portrayed as good people. Velaines doesn't feel like he belongs in the Britannian force and definitely not a Duke of the Briannian Empire.    <br>I like the part where he's telling Kingsley how countless innocents will die if they march on Europia. As if the Imperial family hasn't already killed millions with commanders like Cornelia and Schneizel</br>  <br><br>The 3DCG is awesome. It's the same as in Majestic Prince which was also great. Of course 2D is better on paper, but if it must be CGI, I think this is one of the best alternatives in anime.</br></br>  <br>The original Geass TV show had a great soundtrack, but I like the Akito score too. It has the same composer as the Rahxephon score. The crazy jazz is pretty cool once you get into it.</br>  <br> &gt;You will never have a girl who wears a straitjacket around the house and somehow makes it look stylish as fuck <br>Fixed</br></br>  <br><br>Code Geass always had unusually acrobatic mecha at times. They just were prohibitive to move around all that much because of manpower and budget limits for a 2D anime. Remember that Lancelot and Guren could spinkick. I don't have a problem with the Akito robots since the choreography being so dynamic ties well with the camera work. I think you're mostly exaggerating with the "not allowing you to see anything" since I think the shading blends in pretty well even when the speed isn't too fast.</br></br>  <br>But they do use Slash Harkens. Lancelot has one this episode and the Gloucesters had another in the last one.</br>  <br>I know, but the TV series made use of them much more while in Akito it's mainly melee. Even if it was only for a frame or so, I like MVS and the new Blaze Luminous</br>  <br><br>I think that's why it's important to understand the setting very criticizing it. <br><br>Euro-Britannians are made up of noble houses who originally ruled in Europe.<br><br>For them, this is not like occupying Area 11 and making it a source of slaves. It's taking back their own territories. <br><br>Duke Velaines probably doesn't want to be seen as a murderous conqueror but as someone who is restoring the rightful rule of the aristocracy. <br><br>Honestly, even Schneizel in his less murderous moments would have agreed with that attitude. <br><br>Charles doesn't care and neither do most of the typical mainlained Britannian conquerors, but these are Euro nobles who are acting independently without Imperial supervision.<br><br>That's also part of why Charles is sending Julius to bring them in line. The conquest of the EU is taking too fucking long.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For the record, Schneizel was always a lot less openly murderous than Cornelia (until the final arc of R2). <br><br>He accepted Euphemia's peace plan for the Special Zone of Japan against Cornelia's objections. That was a smart idea too.<br><br>Later on, Schneizel will take only half of the EU into Britannia without gobbling up the entire nation. He even had some rhetoric to go along with that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*I think that's why it's important to understand the setting before criticizing it very much.</br>      Subs where  <br><br>There's a sub file <br><br>Either wait or do it yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a sub file posted on nyaa.</br>  Kek.

Even 0079 look better than that crap.</br>  <br>yeah, but do they have gundam transformer?<br> nice bait by the way </br></br>  <br> bait <br> implying fukuda art looks good <br>Also the only good moment in all of SEED was when Kira "died". It should have just ended there.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not bait, I genuily think anime with this kind of aesthetic (code Guess, Dai-Guard) look bad. I won't deny that there is some fairly good design in SEED but golly, does it look like shit.</br>  When Tomino BTFO'd Newtypes.  <br> gundam transformer? <br>What?</br></br>  I haven't even finished G-Reco yet. I'm at ep 15, and I hear the next one is the RAGE MODE episode.  <br>When tomino BTFO his audience by making a shit show</br>  <br>You're just too stupid to understand it.</br>    <br>It doesn't last long. Like a lot of episodes it just kinda fades to black, some indiscernable amount of time passes and then he's gotten over it.<br><br> The fight in Ep 15 was better and is one of the best in the series IMO </br></br></br>  <br> RAGE MODE <br>Not really. If you've enjoyed it that far you'll enjoy the rest.</br></br>  <br><br> He's serious <br> He also probably thinks F91 is a good movie </br></br></br>  Crossbone Gundam anime fucking when?  <br>Yeah, Unicorn was garbage overall but episode 4 was pretty good.</br>  <br>Its a pretty easy show to understand cause its exposition is obnoxiously shoved into your face, the series is just incredibly inconsistent both in its message and storytelling that its easily up there as one of the worst entries in the franchise. buts its fine the last 4 episodes were fucking hysterical, Cumpa Rusita's death is the funniest moment in all of gundam for me</br>  <br>I couldn't resist</br>  Be nice to your big sister.  <br>Unicorn goes to complete shit after episode 4.</br>  <br> f91 was bad <br>*tips rafflesia*</br></br>    <br>F91 was bad you retarded fuckwit. It was basically a 49 episode Gundam series condensed into a single movie really badly. The only good part in that whole movie was the animation and the last fight.</br>  <br>Only gets raped in the novel.</br>  <br>I think no show has impressed me as much as 0079 in the creativity department.</br>    <br>It was only the first 12 episodes you fucking bullshit spewing moron. <br>You are right about it being bad at least.</br></br>  <br>13</br>  <br>All the F91 wanking only exists because some people are obsessed with its "potential". As a movie it's a failure.</br>  <br>THE EAST IS BURNING RED</br>  When Garrodo-sama destroys the Feddie's colony laser and rescues a kidnapped Tiffa in the process.  <br>NANTOOOO?</br>  Any time Jamil got in a mobile suit was pretty fantastic.

I'll try that scenario out after I finish Garma's scenario. Red Gundam sound hilarious. I hope you can upgrade it to red Gundam with command horn.<br><br> because my former teammates didn't stop me in time <br>That was so funny. Reccoa was kinda cool at first with her whole character being someone who keep throwing herself into danger because that's the only way she know how to live, but then the whole Scirocco women thing happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but then the whole Scirocco women thing happen. <br>I felt it could have been done better if they showed more scenes of Scirocco just being a manipulative fuck with her. It feels kinda wishy washy because there are a lot more scenes with Sarah than with Reccoa and him.</br></br>  <br>Stupid sexy Scirocco</br>  <br>One part /a/ being too retarded to follow AND THIS IS NOT A NEW THING given the amount of people who had trouble following Horizon.<br><br>Second part /a/ believing in a Yaraon article that said G-Reco sold 3k in its first week which was shown to be a mistake so they couldn't use their flop meme anymore.<br><br> Third was G-Reco being better than TRY, A/Z and Cross Ange which were all more popular on /a/. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> blah blah blah is your shelter secure <br> Of course!

You also failed to actually present your points.</br></br>  <br>Was this suppose to be funny?

Fucking chills.</br>  <br>I agree that it could've been done better, for one thing I want to see when Reccoa got over Scirocco because her newtype ghost sided with Kamille instead.<br><br>He's too smooth with his newtype power. One slap at Reccoa and she can't resist coming back to him.</br></br></br>  <br> G-Reco fan complaining about a lack of an argument <br>Irony.</br></br>  <br> her newtype ghost sided with Kamille instead. <br>I think it was like with Katz where they just reach enlightenment and stop being cunts.<br><br>Scirocco's had a strong hold on Sarah though.</br></br></br></br>  I loved when this lame char clone got BTFO    <br>I know right?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d_E<wbr>O7TdqRak</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Wow a Gundam thread that's actually lasting on /a. Sure most of it is people being retarded about G-Reco but still a rare occurrence.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/2uCOpgnwHes?t=1001<wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I've always liked this scene at the end of episode 11. In better quality vids at least you get that shot of the mobile suits streaking down towards the Earth and Jerid swearing revenge. You know the next episode things are going to pick up and get heated pretty much right away, but for now all that anyone can do is just wait to touch down on Earth as the end credits are about to roll. Great way to leave off an episode and excellent set up for the next one to take the stage to Earth at last. Too bad it's a trap.</br></br></br></br>  <br> stating the observed over time is now stating a personal a blanket statement </br>  <br><br>I don't think it's a belief, it looks like just a fact. There seems to be some rule on the internet where you're not allowed to have good Gundam threads anywhere anymore.</br></br>    <br> observed over time <br><br>Your ass must be soar from all the shit you spewed in this thread.</br></br></br>  <br> Scirocco's had a strong hold on Sarah though. <br>Aye, it took ghost argument to convince her not to defend him. Though I'm kinda curious what ghost Sarah plan on doing to stop Kamille, it's not like she can stop the Zeta from flying right through her with its powerup.</br></br>  Build fighters had some pretty great fights.  Dianna &amp; Loran doing laundry.<br>The added scene in the end of the 2nd movie was also great.</br>  <br>I liked the part where the boy thought a MS was a Zaku but in reality it was no Zaku</br>  <br> /a/ <br>SEED Destiny - waifufaggotry, shitty and inconsistent <br> /m/ <br>Zeta - daddy issues, mood shifts and retarded<br> /jp/ <br>Turn A - elitist and boring <br> /v/ <br>Wing - as shitty as you can get</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The added scene in the end of the 2nd movie was also great <br>What is it?</br></br>  <br>It was few more scenes of Loran &amp; Dianna living together.</br>  <br><br>Yeah the golden autumn is definitely up there with best moments.</br></br>  Easily the part where Kamille kills Scirocco<br>That was baller as fuck</br>  <br>This one fucking scene</br>  So is Gundam actually good?<br>I've never watched it before.<br>What anime would you rank it with?</br></br>  <br> Boku no Pico </br>  <br>Yes<br>boku no pico<br> but for real the quality varies between series so it's hard to compare to other anime </br></br></br>  Just download Boku no Pico if you want a good series, it's an /a/ favourite.

I mean some grim Warhammer ripoff. I'd love to read that.</br>  <br>Cause I read synopsis and this one is just another trapped in a game story.</br>   First editions of the DVD and Blu-ray Disc will also include: a box with illustrations by original character designer so-bin, a digipack with illustration by anime character designer Takahiro Yoshimatsu, a case featuring illustrations by so-bin on three sides, a leaflet, and a character card.  <br> a box with illustrations by original character designer so-bin <br> a case featuring illustrations by so-bin on three sides <br><br><br>Not this again anon, the game is gone, dead. The world is real, totally different from game world. And the people are real, they don't know jack shit about the game or anything "game" related. Only that this world has some similarity with the game about magic, skill, items, etc. But generally people in this world are at a very low level compared to the old game world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for nothing. I got what you wrote from the synopsis. My question still stands. Is there something like Japanese Warhammer?</br>  <br><br>Thanks for sharing.<br>Is there anything else from vol.9?</br></br></br>  <br>Nearest would be Gate.</br>  <br>Ah please wait.</br>  <br> I got what you wrote from the synopsis. <br> I read synopsis and this one is just another trapped in a game story. <br>Really now.<br><br>Anyway, sorry but right now I can't recall reading any LN/manga like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's the same type of "trapped in the game" like in LH.</br>  <br>No Log Horizon is a fusion of the real world and the game world and there are game mechanics everywhere<br><br>Overlord world only has two carryovers from the game in the form of the magic system and the magical relics and both of those are because players show up at different times and the group that appeared thousands of years ago dickslapped everything into submission.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Overlord a game turned into a genuine fantasy world?</br>  <br>It's more like DnD, the most "game-esque" thing is how the players/ex-game entities can rank/scale entities to see their approximate details with magic (which you can guard against/falsify info by using defensive magic/skills).<br><br>The normal inhabitants have no idea they even have levels or classes, they just "train" them without knowing it, or so I believe. Hence the roundabout way to gauge the strength by magic tiers and adventurer classes.</br></br></br>  <br>There is no turning<br><br>It straight up pulled Ainz and his guild to a completely different pre-existing fantasy world that pretty much follows d&amp;d rules.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh that makes much more sense.<br>I guess I'll pick it up. Shit's already reminding me of the glorious lovechild of Overlord and Dungeon Keeper.</br></br>  <br>It's D&amp;Dland.</br>  <br>You can try to read the manga if you don't want to invest on the novel for quick look on how the first volume pans out.<br><br>But the novel is heaps and bounds better and does the world/character introduction with more care.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  This thread needs something to discuss so until someone dumps the early screening info so<br><br>What plot points do you want to see in the future?<br><br>Personally I hope we get Black Scripture finding out about Momon and attempting to seal him as a demon god.</br></br></br></br>  does Ainz ever figure out what the "sheep" really are?  <br>Anything by Theocracy, especially their human/dragon crossbeed "special seat". Maybe flesh out the Emprie &amp; other nations better.</br>  <br>Personally I hope the author didn't waste all that shit on the lizard men.</br>  <br><br>Characters that are on par with the Nazarick's denizen so we can see more interesting battles and not just plain curb stomping. Maybe a full scale war now that Ainz has his own nation. <br><br>Maybe see the return of a former guild mate as an enemy. And Albedo going into a frenzy trying to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the curb stomping when it's nicely done and not just over with one move. But yeah, hopefully the Dragon Lords and Dragon King know how to put up a decent fight in future.</br>  <br><br>Personally I'm hoping we see something like the Theocracy ends up going balls to the walls crazy and uses high level res magic to bring back their old heroes or releasing the stuff they sealed away hundreds of years ago to fight Ainz. For all we know they might have stuff like the Seraphim Ainz referenced as a last resort against demon gods.</br></br>  <br>yes, he even thought of it as a subspecies of what it was</br>  Wasn't there supposed to be some sort of pre-screening yesterday?  <br><br>Yes, let's hope the episode gets uploaded somewhere.</br></br>  <br>With the release of 9th vol I believe. It's not like we can expect cam record rip of 1st ep.</br>  <br>Want</br>  Caught up to the drama CD. Albedos abs of steel edition.  <br>I'm more curious about the default stats of the breeds.<br>Who knows they are on par with the Plediaes.</br></br>  <br>Her thighs must be equally hardy then.</br>  <br>Mmmm, my kind of woman</br>  More spoilers when?  <br>It's always spoilers with you guys. Can't you just have some patients and wait for the story to develop?</br>  8 days to go  <br> waiting 1 year for tls <br>Nope.With spoilers i will enjoy it more when i read it aniway.</br></br>  <br><br>Ready to be spodisappointed?</br></br>  <br>Like you have anything better to do<br><br><br>I'm going to watch it and enjoy it and there's nothing you can do to stop me.</br></br></br></br>  <br> there's nothing you can do to stop me. <br><br>I don't want to, I-I'm also going to enjoy it too!</br></br></br>  <br>We'll try our best, just like the VA's wished!</br>  Are there pictures of two Ainz Ooal Gown members like Volume 8, or just one?  So as it turns out, the prologue picks up on where Volume 7 left off.<br><br>Aura and Mare with the Emperor.</br></br>  <br>I-i have!Like fapping or.....fapping?</br>  There are spoiler pictures on Baidu, if anyone cares for them.  <br>That's Re: Monster</br>  <br><br>Fapping,  with both hands. </br></br>  <br>Link pls.Are they the ones already posted here?</br>      <br>Goblins putting in work.</br>  <br><br>Well fuck, humans are really weak in this world.</br></br>  I'm fairly sure that there should be one more chapter, but no picture for it was uploaded.  I have no idea what's going on this picture.  I'm assuming that the postscript picture is Ivileye.  <br>They really grow soft in those big walled cities of theirs, only fighting at best against other humans.</br>  <br> you will never be a goblin serving under a qt goblin general </br>  <br>Ainz's Super-Level Spell - La Shub-Niggurath<br><br>  Summons a black cyclone and kills everything in the area. The victims are sacrificed to summon monsters over level 90. "Dark Young", number of summoned dark young is proportional to the total level of sacrifices.  </br></br></br>  <br>That's a wicked spell</br>  <br>It's a spell with limited utility back in Ainz's MMO world, given how most players were essentially level 100 demi-gods. In this world, it's the apocalypse incarnate.</br>  <br>I find Ainz's brand of evil funny with how much it conflicts with his followers, criminals and literally anyone who inconveniences him is fair game but nope can't torture random villagers</br>  <br>Furthermore most had anti death equips.</br>  <br>as long as ainz doesn't know their backgrounds they all can rot in hell</br>  <br>So LH, but D&amp;D instead of MMORPG</br>  <br>Having bad flashes to sessions of Eldritch Horror gone wrong, due to this.<br><br>ONE Dark Young on the board was bad enough. Thank you for tapping into my fears, Maruyama.</br></br></br>  <br>MMORPG with D&amp;D mechanics.</br>  <br>He's very practical, but he still has a degree of 'human' morality. <br><br>However, it usually only applies if it is in his face, whether at Carne with Sebastian standing right next to him or with the kidnapped civilians after hearing the head maid and Nigredo's plea.<br><br>Demiurge seems to have caught on to it, which is why he never explicitly tells Ainz what he is doing in his "experiments."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The best way to save yourself from Lord Ainz is to blurt out your family history and background the minute you meet him. He might not care in the long run but he might spare a second to feel bad about your plight after he kills you.</br>  <br>Other way around considering the transition.</br>  So based on the PVs, can we agree that Madhouse is actually saving their budget for the fight scenes?  <br>They better make the 3rd vol duel one ep long and blow the budget there. I might even forgive them at that point.</br>  <br>That's our last hope it seems. The scenes with the Knights getting killed was a lot higher quality than most of the rest of the PV.</br>  The fight with Aura/Mare against the fire elemental seemed pretty decent too.  <br>Admittedly, while Mahouka didn't lend itself kindly to action scenes, I believe Madhouse did a tolerable job with the few purely action scenes it had (not talking about the magic animation sequences). Thankfully, Overlord has more action sequences than Mahouka ever did so outside of the CGI parts, it should be average at the least.<br><br>As for overally animation, Madhouse isn't exactly known for sakuga, you know? Sure some scenes will be good but the entire anime will probably be more average than anything.</br></br></br>  So what if shitty cgi is just for when it was a game scenes?  <br>I would consider myself rused.</br>  L.L.L. when?  <br>We can only hope they deliver at least that. The dorky heroes and the not so lucky Silian "Knights" looked pretty bad. At least the Nazarick details were nice in comparison.</br>  <br>I was hoping for designs that were more than just bucket helmets</br>  <br> how to become a Demon Lord for dummies <br>Is that, that manga being translated by rapeman?</br></br>  <br>I've been reading that. I like it. MC is my kind of dude.</br>  <br>the NPC are extremely loyal to papa bones, and hate the humans, what could happen if they found out the past of ainz or an encounter with another supreme being. It would be madness. in other case, have they ever explained the hate towards the supreme beings? it just read theories.</br>  <br>You like being fucked by an edgy rapist who is a self proclaimed maou?</br>  <br>You don't?</br>  <br>It could just be Albedo s setting.There are traps all around Nazarick because of eroge master</br>  <br>The hate thing is pretty simple<br><br>All denizens have 100% loyalty to Ainz and the supreme beings<br>110% to their creator<br>Except Albedo who is only loyal to Ainz</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the past players believed that humans could be the best powerful force and the they were, until now.</br>  <br>Ainz fucked up her setting. Instead of 100°/• it is 200.</br>  <br> 100°/• <br>nigga was that necessary? There's a fucking percentage symbol for a reason.</br></br>  <br><br> /a/utism </br></br>  <br>Only about 70% autism.</br>  So has there been any even remote hint than any of his friends or other players period ended up in that world with him?  <br>that´s i would like to know, did tabula change her setting or did she develop the hate towards the supreme beings?</br>  <br>The settings were always there in that wall of text, I thought. They didn't actually mean anything until they became real.</br>  <br>Well not that the Silian magic casters were any more graceful looking in the manga, damn diver helmets.</br>  <br>Yeah and nobody else really paid mind or read the walls of massive text the NPC's were created with, even Ainz only read them on the final day for some odd reason. And even then, skimmed through them.</br>  <br>They never were the most powerful, only thanks to the 13 Heroes stomping all monsters out and 6 Gods safeguarding Silians they managed to stay alive until this date in their walled domains when the Eight Greed Kings warred against each other.</br>  <br>that japanese stronk manga? its nothing like warhammer, not even a little</br>  <br>His "friends" hopping on his robes would just ruin it or at the very least bring unnecessary drama into it.<br><br>And no, WN had one player that was still alive from the era of 13 Heroes but said guy hasn't been introduced to the LN, as of yet afaik.</br></br></br>  Really grateful for the guys who work on translating us a chapter a week, I hope the anime gets more TLs on it so we can read it even more.<br>Any news on the manga?</br>  <br>they just released the first book for the manga, so who knows if there is a chapter this month.</br>  I want to see Aura and Mare cuddle up with Simmering Teapot.    <br>Eh but she's so creepy</br>  <br>That's not Simmering Teapot though</br>  <br>But MeroMero was already a black ooze, why do they need another slime?<br><br>That said, would be pretty amusing to hear her acting voice come from that form.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that really is Simmering Teapot.</br>  <br>So Bukubukuchagama means Simmering Teapot now?</br>  <br><br>The moon runes at the top mean simmering teapot though.</br></br>  <br> ぶくぶく茶釜 <br> Bukubuku Chagama <br> Bubble Bubble Teapot <br><br>Pls.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah ok. That makes sense now.</br>  <br><br>IS she a slime? Is there any info on what her particular race is?</br></br>  <br>Where are you getting these pictures from?</br>  <br>Probably one of the Elder X Ooze races like Herohero.</br>  <br>Implying the Elf Twins care.</br>  <br>I took a picture</br>   So in Volume 6, who is ヒルマ? And why is Mare dragging her?   <br>One of the Eight Fingers criminal organization's people, Mare was tasked to break her in so she'll be a mole for Nazarick later on.<br><br>He  threw her to Lord of Terror who made his cockroaches eat her alive from torso and Mare kept her alive be healing her. Bend? Not, back into the pit . Or something like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Mare so cute?</br>  <br><br>Ahh thanks.</br></br>  <br>She's a noble, the leader of the drug trade operations within a certain organization Nazarick opposes. Needless to say, she did not have a good time after Mare caught her...</br>  <br>Shit, we need MMOs that let you play as slimes.</br>  These cute lovebird Lizards are going to be turned into a matching pair of boots for Ainz and Albedo aren't they?  <br>Nah, they'll be fiiiiine. <br><br><br>Agreed. Or skeletons, or any monster race really. Why hasn't this been done?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, not fluffy enough to be made into morning slippers for Papa Bones as he would shuffle around his suite in the morning.</br>  <br>Stat compensation for players who CAN wear equipment or making up equipment for things that don't normally wear equipment is haaaard.</br>  <br>They made the mistake of kidnapping a human girl that Ainz personally promised to protect. I think it was also one of the few times he got really upset.<br><br>Shady human organization is no match for the might of Nazarick.</br></br></br>  <br>TERA had Aman, basically dragonkin, golems and fat animal dudes as playable races, no one picked them and instead went for human palette swaps and animal eared lolis. People that want to play quirky stuff are a minority.</br>  <br>yeah, but it's always just "slightly different humans". None of them ever take the first step and let you go full monster.</br>  <br><br>Isn't that girl the sister of some other adventurer chick? I recall Ainz saying he was repaying a debt or something.</br></br>  <br><br>DAoC. and Shadowblade had pretty much everything race wise<br>also<br> wanting to play mmos </br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Ninya's sister is different case. And not noble.</br>  <br>I liked being a walking castle while the game was still good.</br>  <br>Hey man, MMOs are the future. We're just not here yet.</br>  <br>The hetermorphic races of the old MMO had a fair amount of downsides compared to the human and demi-human races. However, they had powerful racials and transformative ability. <br><br>Humans and demi-humans had a wider selection of classes and jobs, whereas hetermorphic races were "restricted" by their racial levels. They couldn't take as many classes or jobs as humans or demi-humans could and people could PK them with little consequence.</br></br></br>  <br>Because mmo devs don't have the cajones to balance a system around undead players taking damage from healing spells and heal from harm spells.</br>  <br>You missed the golden age of mmos friend, we're entering the age of mobas, and mobile games now</br>  <br>Well, DDO kind of did it. But the game is super old by now. It needs to be redone and brought up to date.</br>  Speaking of LNs, I highly recommend Legendary Moonlight Sculptor. Been burning through it and enjoying it. Not bad for a Korean LN. <br><br>Can be read at royalroadweeds blog thing.</br></br>  <br>Basically hetermorphic races were better suited for min-maxing.</br>  <br>There was pre-WoW and post-WoW; say what you want about WoW, it massacred the diversity of the MMO market. <br><br>All these LNs and anime tend to focus on mechanics often present in pre-WoW MMOs.</br></br></br>  <br> just started the jewventures <br> didnt go through the dark times of all the translators claiming they totally weren't stopping at volume 20 and other possible translators didn't take over because muh TL community <br><br>I hate and envy you so much</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mare and Entoma go to her house.<br>Entoma eats the guards.<br>Noble chick tries to launch a sneak attack on him, sending out magic snakes.<br>Mare grabs those snakes and crushes them in his hands.<br>He then proceeds to twist her foot, causing the bones to protrude from the muscle.<br>Then he grabs her hair and drags her along, telling her to move faster.</br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>I'm sorry mate. If it's any consolation I've been through TL drama with a few other LNs.</br>  <br>Mare don't fuck around.</br>  <br>I've read a few volumes, it wasn't bad but got bored after a while. Does it get better after a certain point?</br>  <br>Dunno. I'm up to volume 14 and I'm ok with it.</br>  <br> that shield bro fiasco </br>  <br>Mare is  third best boy .</br>  <br>Who are the top two, then?</br>  <br> Demiurge and Ainz. </br>  <br> Not Pandora's Actor <br>Moderately shit taste</br></br>    <br><br><br>Ainz&gt;Sebas&gt;Demiurge&gt;The virtuous King if the forest&gt;Pandora's Actor&gt;Mare</br></br></br>    <br>How about for girls?</br>  <br> tfw I'll never get to play as a mindflayer in anything <br>Suffering.</br></br>  <br>Right? What the hell is wrong with devs?</br>  <br>Again, people that actually want to play are the minority and devs can't into balance.</br>  What would a person think when they find out a slime is the older sister of a bird?  <br><br>Tough one. Narberal&gt;Albedo&gt;Shalltear&gt;Shizu&gt;Yuk<wbr>i&gt;Wolf&gt;Slime&gt;bug</wbr></br></br>   mfw Funi is the one which will be simulcasting this.   <br>Where was this announced?</br>  <br>It's on their Twitter and their site.</br>  <br>Unfortunately, Illithids are one of the few things Wizards reserves for DnD exclusively, so it's not feasible for them to show up in anything else.</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Feasibility shouldn't matter. Just give us monster characters to play as.</br>  <br>Pretty sure I could use Mindflayers in FFT.<br><br>I'd need to get gud at RTS' first.</br></br></br>  <br>Ha, I've been trying to play that.</br>  I've been reading this and it's unbearably shit. <br>It gets good here and there, but it gets ruined quickly each time it starts to get good by some stupid shit. <br><br>The entire thing reminds me of Log Horizon, which I also hated and had the shittiest-taste fans on /a/. Even worse than Fate or Index fags, at least those turdburglars can admit that their series are shit.<br> <br>LH fags never did, they'd just try to claim you were an "IIRC troll" or some similar stupid shit and then focus the entire thread on denying the series could possibly be shit despite its glaring problems. <br>The people making these threads are almost as bad if not equal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dominions isn't an RTS. It's turn based and you don't even directly control your units. It has a faction for basically every fantasy thing you can imagine.</br>  I am interested, tell me, /a/, what genre does the LN belongs to ?  <br>Fucking Bob</br>  <br>poopoo fart butt for losers genre</br>  <br>Are you the guy who named their prophet/god Ainz and had a bazillion skeletons attacking a castle<br><br>Pretty sure I saw a picture like that</br></br></br>  So I been interested in reading this, so it is worth reading?  <br>Please be specific, I can't hear you through all the retard noises.</br>  So this guy is  Peroroncino, Shalltears Creator  no wonder where she got her armor design from  <br><br>Well fuck you too funi.</br></br>  <br>Then you won't be able to even read this series.</br>  <br>I don't care. Just tell me what genre this LN belongs to and what I should expect, the rest is my businese.</br>  <br>I already did and you're being pretty ungrateful for it.</br>  <br>or, you know, you can just read it.</br>  <br>*Business</br>  <br>That was me, the save got corrupted because too many skelletons on the world so I have to do it again.<br>I wish I had skills in pixel art so I could do a Ainz faction with the guardians as heroes and the great leaders as possible gods.<br>Though I don't know what units it can use since Nazarrick isn't just skellies</br></br></br>  <br>I already have tons of others in my backlog, knowing what this LN belongs to helps me sort out the priority.</br>  <br>Overlord should be priority one my friend</br>  <br>Adventure, MMORPG, grimdark, tits, loli, rape, anal, boobs, trap.</br>  <br> grimdark <br> loli <br> rape <br>Ok, I'm in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You would be</br>  Does anyone know how the radio show is supposed to work?  <br> radio show <br>The hell are you talking about?</br></br>  <br>http://www.onsen.ag/program/overlor<wbr>d/</wbr></br>  <br>looks like fan made</br>  <br>http://overlord-anime.com/special/</br>  So where can I download the translations so I can read this? On that LN site?      <br>LMS gets boring after about 20.<br><br>You already know what will happen in the real world with who fucks who and the game world's just a bunch of people taking games too seriously at that point.</br></br></br>  I think this is the closest Albedo pic I've found yet.
