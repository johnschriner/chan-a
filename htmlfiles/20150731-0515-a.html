He wrote a blog complaining his workplace blocked the site from their network.Despite being popular anybody who had a good work ethic basically told him to stfu, and that work is for work, not fucking around on a weeb filled figure database.

Just like pic related.</br>  <br>Some of the figures had to have already been planned before the show even aired. She probably won't have any staying power unless there's a second season, unless the LN and manga are super popular.

The figure was announced 2 years ago so who knows if it'll ever be released.</br>    <br>Dolls are cute, dude. Dollfags being autistic enough to use expensive equipment for taking pictures helps, too. I don't have one but I'd like to get one some day.</br>  <br>I don't think I could collect dolls because of the maintenance that goes into them.<br>They can be cute as fuck though.</br></br>    <br>Dolls don't fall under jointshit. For dolls, joints are half the appeal in the first place.<br><br>I'd buy one if they weren't so goddamn expensive.</br></br></br>  Who cu-poche here?    how is a neet suppose too afford this? I wouldn't think they get that much autism dollars.  <br>I regret not getting Dekacchu Wo. Wonder if they'll ever continue the line.</br>  <br>They're pretty cute, but I have no interest in buying them. although I have to say Kuroneko's cu-poche is absolutely adorable and makes me want her.</br>  <br>It isn't even that expensive.</br>  <br>Yeah, they're really cute and I find interesting how well the Madoka Cu-poches combine with the Madoka RAHs</br>     The kokeshi doll that looks like someone is exclusive <br>God fucking damn you GSC!<br> Fuck you.   ;_; </br></br>  <br>I would say they could give nendoroids a run for their money, but I highly doubt they'll take off and get as many licenses and put them out as fast as nendoroids.</br>    <br>What's wrong anon? The GSC Online Shop ships internationally you know.</br>  <br>You've caught my interest.</br>  <br><br>Please, anon. <br><br><br><br><br><br>That's basically the thing that stops me from getting one, they are around 600$~ and is not that I don't have th money, is just that it feels like it's too much just for one thing. That said I'm sure one day I'll give in and get one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They have just begun, I think that they need more time and of course they should make characters from more IPs<br>Some of the characters that they have done by now, doesn't have a nendo counterpart or any aticulated figure at all<br>Like the Dark Magician Girl or the IM@S girls or the Destroyer Div6 girls<br><br><br> according to keikaku.jpg </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its just a doll. Older exclusives were better</br>  <br><br><br>Planelegs pls go</br></br></br>  <br>Dispatched so far.</br>  <br> Planelegs <br>You lost me anon</br></br>  <br>Yeah I think it was a good choice to acquire IPs that don't have nendo counterparts to start with to set themselves apart from nendos, although they still have some characters like Aegis and the Oreimo girls that have Nendoroids too.<br>I'd love to see the line take off and give GSC some good healthy competition.</br></br>  <br>I agree with you<br>They even will release the character mascots, which I personally find really cute</br></br>  <br>Whats up with those bases though?</br>  <br><br>I feel you man, if a single dolfie did not cost more than what i earn in a month i would definitely own a couple of them.</br></br>  <br>Do you work part time, or do you just have a shit job?</br>  <br>Whats up with those bases though?<br>These figures have magnets in their feets and the base have a metal plate, so you can make stand on their own without the help of a articulated arm (they come with one anyway for flying poses)</br></br>  <br>third world country.</br>  Anyone have any of the Medicos Jojo figures? I order 2 from HobbySearch and was wondering, do the top and bottom flaps come taped up? My figures boxes look new, except that there aren't any tape on the box openings, and the bottom of one box has a little dent that looks like someone might have opened it. Also another figures foot seems to have been moved slightly to the right. Could that have happened during customs? I live in the US if that matters. Never order from Japan before so I am a bit confused. Don't want to open them and check because I am autistic about shit like this and like my figures sealed.  <br><br>Thrird world m8. My wage is actually in the top 40%.</br></br>  <br>Wow that's actually perfect in my opinion.<br>I always wished figures would do that instead of pegs and claws.<br>Wish all figures used those types, Might consider getting one now just to appreciate that magnet base.</br></br></br>  <br>which one exactly bolibia?</br>  Does anyone know why they aren't up on the ami international site?  <br>JAPAN ONLY<br><br>Elsa was available in HLJ the first time she was in PO, IDK if now will be there for PO</br></br></br>  <br>She is on HLJ but Anna isn't. I could just get her from BiJ or if I want to overpay, CdJp.</br>  <br><br>Argentina. After all the taxes the Dolfie would end up costing around USD 1200, and i earn around 1300 a month.<br><br>Not only we earn shit money, but they rape us with the taxes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Check out all the jointshit in /v/ buyfag threads.</br>  Which one?    <br><br>Right. Could be the photo and angle, but i like her face better.</br></br>  <br>I'm from there too(I earn 21K AR$), also any order above 1000 u$s can only be picked up through a customs broker.</br>  <br>Blue. Highlights her figure better and the blue/white contrast is more interesting.</br>  <br>Some figures really need to come with a yaranaika face.</br>  <br>Though I prefer the expression from the white one.</br>  <br>I've wanted them to make the Cu-poche mascots since they started using them as models for the clothes, but with no accessories or alternate hands and only one face, it's kind of a letdown.</br>  Can't wait to have this figure.  <br><br>The stuff about the broker is only if the original price is over that amount, that means pre customs taxation and does not include the 35% credit card tax. So it'd be safe to order a dolfie.<br><br>There is still the problem of them costing U$$ 1200 for us though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it includes shipping cost, not sure about how much it could be, an 1/4 is around 10K by EMS.</br>   brown hair   <br> but with no accessories or alternate hands and only one face, it's kind of a letdown. <br>Yeah, but they showed this in this past wonfes, maybe they have plans for a alternate faces set like the one made by GSC, At least that is what I think that this image means</br></br>  Found this on Amazon for $22. I say it's worth the price.    <br>i want to cum on this anime girl</br>  <br> Cu-poche Extra <br> Anne mood faces and ponytail set <br> Kirakira, depressed, "Wakya~!" faces <br>Hmm, could be interesting. Still sucks that everything has to be bought separately, yet the base figure costs about as much as other Cu-poches which come with multiple faces and accessories. The mascots seem like they're there to be marketed as mini dolls than anything else.</br></br></br></br>    <br>It's a fucking foldable plastic box that is worth maybe 20 bucks. Not 50 and definitely not 70. Anyone who pays for that is legit retarded.</br>  Guys guys I need your help, I spent the past 2 hours searching for this, used every keyword I can, "任務娘", "任務娘抱き枕カバー<br>", "zero戦", etc. and the closest thing I found was a bootleg on rakuten auctions.

Well, I don't think those versions are good either, if you mean this. Bishoujo figure with  nipples  permanently stick to the uninstallable outfit is a bad idea.

Anything happen to this?  <br>Real men don't ask, they just don't pay.</br>  <br>They sell on Amazon.co.jp now and there's little they can stop you from ordering there.<br>Didn't place any ami orders since then.<br>Amazon + forwarder allows you to undervalue as well or combine stuff across months.<br> ancient chinese secret </br></br></br></br>  <br>Amico is harmless.</br>  <br>Just don't pay your payment request.</br>  <br> do to </br>  <br>everyone knows that up to 4/5 cancellations is safe and won't get you banned.</br>  <br><br>I let a couple of orders slip by 2 years ago. And have canceled like 2-3 by email in the past. I'm living on the edge and need to be careful. <br><br>Wouldn't a forwarding service be more expensive though? Or does Amazon's cheap shipping work out to be cheaper in the long run?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, theres no fucking way im paying 90$ for pic related. I will definitely ignore payment. I really do like it, but its not worth that much. 30-40$ sure</br>  <br>Been painted and up for pre-order for a while.</br>  <br>Scrapped<br><br><br>But that's the regular price for a legit daki. Go buy a bootleg if you want a $30-40 one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Their prices on Amazon are the same or better.<br>The 500-ish yen shipping rarely is much of a factor, and combined shipping as EMS for multiple orders usually costs about the same with a forwarders as it does with Ami.<br>The real advantage is the opportunity to save customs tax.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why did you preorder it you fucking retard?<br>This is the state of seasonal waifu fags.</br></br>  <br>Better than nothing.</br>  <br>What were you thinking in the first place? Did you fall for the Hestia craze?</br>  <br>I'm glad that I didn't order any scale of her, good thing I didn't listen to James, most likely many of them are going to bin.</br>  <br>Whoa, shit. Thanks mate. Sorry for the spoonfeed request.</br>  <br>Wonderful.<br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br>nice ass, but her face is too flat.</br>  <br>RAHs are great if you can afford to invest the money. I can understand if it's one with a whole bunch of joints visible. <br>But all those accessories</br></br>  I hear there's a bilingual Japanese/English print of Devilman that Kodansha put out in 2003, is it still around/what do the covers look like? I'm digging around on eBay and there's quite a few different editions of the manga from Japan so I have no idea what I should be looking for.  <br>some look fairly shitty. not just the joints, also the faces being off.</br>  <br>Unfortunately. I've learned my lesson.</br>  <br> RAHs are great <br><br>I could never use that term to describe them.</br></br></br>  <br>Send a request to cancel you retard. Ignoring payments just increases the chance of you getting banned.</br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>He deserves to be banned.</br>  <br>Some of them look terrible. Probably not worth bothering unless it's your waifu and even then it depends on which one it is. The megukas for example look fine.</br>  <br>Okay, but stop calling me a retard. Theres no need for tha.</br>  <br>banned for just one cancellation (unless he had more than four in the past or have been warned before)? what are you smoking?</br>  <br>Oh really, which ones? The only one I remember being terrible is the Yuno Gasai one. My RAH homuhomu is probably my best figure.<br><br>Maybe I just got lucky. Also Yukari's RAH looks pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean little shit, fuck off, people make mistakes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128799037 <br> lmao <br>ayy<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a retard, how do you preorder something and only realize you don't want to pay the price afterwards?</br>  <br>I miss the days when Amiko banned people first time instead of this letting people cancel nonsense.</br>  <br> people make mistakes <br>And people need to pay for those mistakes.</br></br>  <br> cancel nonsense <br>This shit is Amiami's fault. Don't let companies fuck you in the ass. A customer should always be able to cancel a preorder.</br></br>  <br>It happened to me once.<br>I can't explain it.<br>Probably autism.</br></br></br>  <br>WITH THEIR LIFE</br>  <br>that never happened, but they were less tolerant in the past, sometimes they sent you a warning after 3 cancellations, now the norm is 5 if not more, depending of the customer.</br>  <br>No. Or conversely: if they demanded deposits up front they would have some reason top keep that if you cancel.<br>But they're nice enough to not ask for deposits.<br> I would <br>Get rekt, casual-preorderers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I once missed a payment since I completely forgot that I ordered something. Luckily they didn't ban me, but I apologized anyway. Had to order my item from N-Y, though, since it was sold out on Ami by then.</br>  <br>That's another myth spread by buyfag.</br>  <br> thinking you can get banned just that w/o having been warned first. </br>  <br><br><br>Fucking homos the lot of you. <br>Its like you work for amiami or something, defending it because im canceling one fucking item. <br>Ha- laughable man. <br>It really kills me that you fucking queers are so ready to just be plain negative any chance you get. Im simply canceling an item and you autists get triggered to the max.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would rather a deposit if it means you can get a refund and cancel if you need to. <br>I seriously think it's retarded to defend this sort of mentality. You do not gain anything from a system like this where poor buyfags must live in fear of being banned by the great tyrant Amico.</br></br>    <br> poor buyfags <br>That's your problem, buyfagging isn't for the poor.<br>They don't like cancelations because most items are made to order.</br></br></br>  <br> register <br> place pre-orders <br> don't pay them <br>You'll get banned.<br><br>It's different as a returning customer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is pretty cringy</br>  <br>My nigga got shoulders.</br>  <br> because most items are made to order <br>Err, no. But they have to tell the supplier how many they need and do some estimations of how many they will sell.<br>Alternatively the merchandise might be limited and cancellations screw with their bookkeeping.</br></br></br>  <br>I registered with my dad's name and had a combined order with three scales, I didn't pay because they wanted me to use paypal and not my credit card(I even emailed them), and didn't get banned.</br>  <br> cont. <br>Imagine they know they can get 200 of a certain exclusive item, the preorders are quickly sold out.<br>Then half of the people cancel their preorders or don't pay at last notice.<br>They just lost all those sales and have to sell the item again.<br><br>It also screws over those people who couldn't pre-order because it was 'sold out'.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant poor as in the other definition of the word. <br>I can understand why they don't like cancellations but I still think the customer should have the right to do it. Of course abuse of the system should result in a ban.<br>But anyway I think a lot of the fear may be not necessary. You don't hear about anons who are long time customers getting banned. It's just the uncertainty that's annoying. I also understand why they may be reluctant to clarify publicly, their real policy on cancelling.</br></br></br>  <br> I even emailed them <br>The reason is right there.<br> you tried <br><br>If you keep pulling that shit you're a goner, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really hope that nigger gets the 1/3 Pochaco and hotglues it to cuck all other fatty lovers.</br>  <br>I just didn't want to use Paypal, no problem with my credit card though.</br>  <br> implying being a Pochaco fag isn't punishment enough <br>Merciless, man.</br></br>  <br> fat-enablers <br> enough punishment <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>To them it's all about confidence in your orders.<br>If they think there's a bigger chance you screw it up again instead of actually buying the items you order they'll b&amp;</br></br>  <br>It's just one or two guys forcing that shit.</br>  <br>Maybe I'm some kind of humanist after all.</br>  Do the One Piece Excellent Model series figures look as good in person as they do in the photos?  <br>whoa</br>   Hand-bottled by amiami staff <br>Fuck. 7 years late on this.</br>  <br>Almost.<br><br>Not like Griffon or anything.</br></br></br>  <br>That looks hideous. Excellent model my ass.</br>  <br>It's not really their fault he looks like that.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>How the fuck can anyone hate Doflamingo's design. As for the figure set they just seem really 'solid' feeling.</br>  <br>still waiting on mine... I am so hyped</br>  <br>Hyped like on your way to McDonalds.</br>  <br><br>They might as well just start making cast off of her. She isn't even much of a character in the first place.</br></br>  <br>They look pretty good(except the older ones before 2010), plus many of them are cheap these days.</br>  <br>Fuck cast off. They should concentrate on the scale as it is not add some useless undressing feature.<br>Most of the time it looks like shit either with or without the castoffable components, depending on what they focused on.<br><br>I prefer a good looking and cheaper figure without paint transfer and shit like that.<br> or clothes I never remove/add </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> overlapping bases <br>Was that just to get them all in one shot or do you really have it like that?</br></br>  <br> overlapping bases <br>Please.<br><br>PLEASE.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish I could help you but I really never heard of this and where to get it. Is this a series or just an individuals private work?</br>  <br>You know you can use your credit card through paypal.</br>  <br>The feathers are too much, I also dislike most of One Piece's designs.</br>  <br>A doujin daki sold last C85.</br>  <br><br>Yes, I arranged them that way just for that photo.</br></br>  <br><br>Will this Nami make all the other Nami obsolete?</br></br>  <br>That's fine, but don't trash talk the figure line please.<br>They do a good job.</br></br>  <br>Each to their own I guess. Personally I like the design precisely because it's too much. <br><br>Of course, I had faith in you Anon.</br></br></br>  So did badpicsfag every post the full wonfes album on an imgur?  <br> post timeskip nami <br> shit mouth <br> dumb pose <br>No.</br></br></br></br>  Anyone have her? The Alter scale's face looks strange to me and the GSC scale is easily <br> $200 <br>now</br></br>  <br>This is worse than Porkchop.</br>  <br>The best one so far is without a doubt mugiwara v2</br>  <br>I need this</br>  <br> pre-time skip Nami <br> only shorter hair and smaller tits <br><br>Distinction without a difference<br><br> shit mouth <br><br>It is staying true to Oda's art brah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For $200 it probably isn't worth it if for any figure if you're unsure about the face.</br>  <br>Contender for worst base ever.<br>A friend has it and it's a good looking figure, but dat base, mang.<br>Not too hard to fix, though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This fig is super unimpressive.</br></br>  <br><br><br>disgusting. why is everything from one piece so hideous?</br></br></br>  <br>It's one of those times they really didn't do a great job on the promo shots (and base).</br>  <br>work on your reading comprehension</br>  <br>and how much is that prize? I wouldn't pay more than 2K for her</br>  <br><br>That's your opinion</br></br>  <br>Maybe I phrased that poorly but I what I meant to say is that I love the GSC scale but it's too expensive. The Alter scale is cheaper but I'm unsure about the face. So I'm checking for prize figures of her and I rather like this one.<br><br>Really? I thought it looked alright for a prize fig<br><br>It really is but it's cheap and probably the only thing I can get of her. <br><br>About 3K. There's a normal Hanekawa version for a little under 2K I'm considering as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Foreheads.<br><br>Also mouths.</br></br></br>  <br>Not saying prize figures ever have any good bases, but somehow her's is ill fitting and terribly contrasting.<br>The decal doesn't help.</br></br>  Is Viz's translation of All You Need Is Kill good? Edge of Tomorrow is one of my favorite movies but I still haven't read the book.  <br> her's is <br> kill me </br></br>  <br>Even though you might not like OP style or her physique, you can't dent her face looks pretty cute.</br>  <br><br>Oh whoops I'm a retard. Sorry.<br>It looks pretty fine for a 3k prize figure. <br>My advice would be to save up for the GSC scale if you really like it. In the long run it will be more satisfying to finally get your grail.</br></br></br></br>  Add to this list, 2014 figma racing Miku and Sansei Muramasa bunny ver.<br>What all is getting delayed?</br>   buying female One piece figures <br>Why? There are like two good female designs total.</br>  <br> dat August <br> inb4 you are kill in August </br></br>  <br>Yeah, I think I could set aside a little bit each paycheck for her. Like I said, I love her to death but being a college student, /a/, and /g/ fag is suffering.</br>  <br> /g/ <br>I had to check which board this is.<br><br>Explains it, though.</br></br></br></br>  Remember to always buyfag responsibly. Never put yourself in economic danger for plastic.  <br> can't into priorities <br>Work on it.</br></br>  <br>That entire thing looks awful, face included.The face is less awful than most one piece designs but a polished shit is still a shit.</br>  <br>you're shit out of luck then.</br>  <br>Check out September.

Or are all ebooks from Bookwalker like that?</br>  <br>Yeah I figured that's what you meant, the parcel would have to be like 5kg to cost that much on shipping.<br><br>Bongland customs is shit, you pay a flat rate of £15 for "handling" then 20% tax. I don't order enough to get all my stuff shipped in one go though.</br></br></br>  <br>Always makes me sad to see others are actually way bigger Nazis than the Germans these days.<br>What about muh heritage?<br><br>Mind you, we -are- Nazis still, but not on that level.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i don't have to pay anything for customs. it'll come straight to me in a few days</br>  <br>I've bought non-Japan-only ebooks from them.<br>But I'm not even getting to payment stage, as soon as I look at my cart it gives me that error.<br>Book is http://bookwalker.jp/de31f3e0f2-a6a<wbr>6-4dfa-a3c0-647d8df861ef/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>White looks awesome! Makes the small blue parts stand out more imo</br>  <br>I kinda misinterpreted it. You have nobody you need to feed, I got it now.<br>But you should also still have people that help you financially.<br> not like you should waste that on animu </br></br></br>  So there's two figures of my waifu on sale on ebay right now. <br>One costs 800 usd plus shipping, but is complete.<br>The other one costs 60 usd plus shipping, but is not assembled and is even unpainted, and I've never painted anything that's not a house wall before. <br>What do I even do?</br></br></br>  <br>You should buy the $800 one.</br>  <br>The $800 one.</br>  <br>never buy figs on ebay, they're usually bootlegs</br>  <br><br>Where are you buying it from? Consider getting it from playasia. They just go by regular airmail.</br></br>  <br>Do you mean GKs?</br>  <br>It looks like a much-less-detailed Raita.</br>  <br><br>It's that difficult to paint figures, huh? Damn.<br><br><br>I've bought all my figures on ebay, mostly because I can't get them elsewhere. I don't know if my figures are legit or not, and I don't particularly care since they look good enough for me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The $800 sounds like a tempting offer.</br>  <br>Not sure if it's "official" or not, but it sure looks like a GK.</br>  <br>It's showing up in my cart. Clear your cookies.</br>  <br>Buy the GK, go to hobby store, whine to people about muh waifu.<br>Pay close attention to the Warhammer fags.<br>Then pick one who does a good job and preferrably has airbrush and tell him you pay him $300 to build your perfect waifu.</br></br></br>  I didn't know that Tharja was at 14K, to think she went for as low as 7K for a week.  <br>She's amazingly overrated.<br>I mean, her upper portion is top notch, but the ass is nothing special.<br>Pretty mediocre, in fact.</br></br></br>  <br>I chose EMS because I wanted it fast.</br>  <br><br>Aren't our waifu figs huge compare to their little toy soldiers? Can they even do good skin tone?</br></br>    <br>There's no such shops for hours here, unfortunately.

Why the fuck should people wait 3 hours for raws when they don't have to?</br></br></br>  <br> Yugi </br>  I have to admit that I was very briefly an Amourshipper, or at the very least a Serenafag, and even to this day I don't hate Serena (I actually like her). I'm just not happy with the way things at /padt/ have gone. In the past, it was full of discussion of various topics. Sure it had lots of Amourshipping, but other topics got their time in the spotlight as well. But nowadays it's just a de-factor Amourshipping thread. It's not wrong to discuss Amour, but when it becomes the main source of discussion most of the time, along with criticizing anyone who even dares to at the very least imply Serena will leave at the end of XY or not believing that Ash and Serena will become a couple, something just doesn't feel right. Hate me all you want, whether it be though my use of a trip, my opinions, or that fetish, but it can't be denied that you guys take Amour way too seriously and are guilty of the same problems as Pokeshippers. You guys keep saying that you are "just going along for the ride" and aren't taking things seriously, but that doesn't seem to be the case if you discuss Amour *and little else* day in and day out. It's not wrong to be a shipper, but please, can't you guys stop making /padt/ a shipping thread? You guys aren't "not being serious" if you hate anyone who isn't a shipper.<br><br><br>This.</br></br></br>  JUST ENJOY THE RIDE  <br>Tl;dr</br>  <br><br>Somebody needs to chill.</br></br>  <br>Mami you seemed to have forgotten, you're a shit and no one cares about your opinons</br>  <br>Don't be a fucking whiner you fucking namefag.

I still remember the movie threads and I remember getting pissed that people were caring more about the (minimal) Amour interactions rather than the more important and more relevant stuff such as plot summaries or box-office performance. Let them discuss Amour all they want, they just need to at least chill about Amour and treat people with other opinions about Serena better. </br>  <br> your crush will never eat and enjoy your homemade dogfood </br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br>It's pretty good.<br><br> That thread has exploded with OC lately.

If no one else wants to, then deal with it. That's the state of the fanbase.</br>  <br>I was in the movie threads and no, that's not what was happening. People discussed the movie itself first. When that was done they began talking about that scene. Don't twist facts. People like you are the ultimate shitposter since you only complain and don't try to discuss anything else. Which people will do if you just bring up a topic. Besides, we had the manga adaptation for long and that was discussed a lot.

TOO CLOSE    <br>Shit this is pretty accurate, May, Rosa and Cynthia are all top tier</br>  Why is this not on /vp/?<br><br>Thats where this belongs</br></br>  <br>There was an /a/ pol but I dont have the link and Serena won there with 200+ people participated</br>  <br>its not</br>  <br>Eh It's probably not.

Is pokemon secretly a harem show for kids?!</br>  <br>After the BW disaster I guess they wanted anything that would make the audience come back for more. Pretty sure Serena's character alone drew a lot of new fans in.</br>  Is Serena the reason Ash doesn't lose every single fight this generation (in fact he wins most of them)?  <br><br>For 20 years Dat Ash will finally score.</br></br>  <br>Everybody is crazy for the Ash in this region, anon</br>  <br>God knows that I've wanted to pick this back up because Serena and OP Ash is back.</br>  <br>She's gonna get replaced next season</br>  <br>Two gym battles implied it, also Ash helping Serena on her dream</br>  <br>The battles are awfully nice too.<br><br>But then you have the mandatory insipid pokemon fillers.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn.</br>  <br> they put a lot of effort into developing her <br> even gave her a new design midway which made her more unique to her game counterpart <br><br>If ever Ash loses and makes it to next region (which could be southern to kalos or east to poke germany), he might bring Serena with him.<br><br>Or they might just end the anime on a high note of Ash winning league and Serena then reboot for next gen  with possibly son/daughter of both will be mc </br></br></br></br></br></br>  God fucking damnit, take your Amourshit back to /vp/'s anime general and stay there. Actual discussion is impossible there thanks to the amourfags.  <br>Lots of people on 2ch said they dropped the show after the fucking disaster that was BW86 (good for them, the show managed to get even worse not too long after) then came back when XY started.<br><br>The execs KNOW BW was poorly received and cost them viewers.</br></br></br>  <br> yfw Ash score an aryan QT <br> yfw you will never get to score an aryan QT, let a lone a girl </br></br>  How much anal devastation would happen if Ash x Serena becomes the real deal at the end?  <br><br>Why would there be any anal devastation? This is not fucking Naruto.</br></br>  <br>Dropped it at the start of BW, came back around XY26 when I found Ash was back at Sinnoh levels and a girl liking him.<br><br><br>Fuckton of nostalgia fags will be caught unaware over the internet, probably can cause more devastation than naruto since misty was mostly a part of their childhood</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bowl. Eggs. Etc.</br>  <br> he doesn't know nostalgiafags </br>  <br>At least be happy anon, we have been riding with him throughout our lifetime and he'll get married before we do too.</br>  <br>anime mistyfags are the worst</br>  <br>You missed out on the one good thing that came from BW</br>  <br>I watched BW after reaching XY latest, hell it was a shitty ride but it had its ups too like your pic related.</br>  <br><br>and just how many are there? 5?</br></br>  <br>There was a website dedicated to it, owner of bulbapedia is a big pokeshipper and had a cult following him. Also almost every normies you ask about the anime, they remember misty ash and brock</br>  <br>I liked her too. Man BW just shat all over its own potential.</br>  <br>Ash is such a lucky cunt</br>  <br>Bitch please, they even have their own Chatte.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Insane Narutard with delicious tears.</br>  <br>fanartist on deviantart, who can either imitate or trace their artstyle like hell<br>also insane NaruSakutard, who was salty about chapter 700</br></br>  <br>oops, this is LadyGT, who I described...</br>  <br>Some NS hambeast who created an insane theory of how the ending in genjuutsu and Kishi is gonna show the true ending soon. She have been saying this since November and every time something new is released she get BTFO.</br>  <br><br>I know who Chatte is. I was asking who is the Chatte of the Pokemon fandom</br></br>  <br>Some Mistyfag on tumblr called Suift.<br>Some retard keeps reposting his shit on /vp/ despite it always getting deleted at shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Swifty, he have been in the fandom since forever. He used to dwell in Bulbapedo forums no he has a Tumblr with in tinfoil hat theories.<br>Just look a this: http://suift-duroo.tumblr.com/tagge<wbr>d/the-bonnie-and-misty-connection</wbr></br></br>  <br>You know? Even if he is bullshitting and knows it, his friends and followers are probably impressionable kids who will think this is actually legit.</br>  <br>Is the same with Chatte actually, they know they are bullshitting but they are attention whores who like to be worshipped by 15 year old.</br>  <br>He advertises that he works on video games on his blog which is basically only about Pokémon, so honestly this theory holds quite a bit of water to me.</br>  <br>The breast still bother me.</br>  <br>oh boy</br>  Pokemon anime has always been just advertisement for the games. They'll need to ship Serena back home to make room for the next game's female character to join the party  <br>fuck</br>  <br>Suift also dates a girl who meet on Serebii (she was a Pokeshipper too) and the girl was underage when they meet and start dating so I wouldbe careful with him. He can be a predator.</br>  <br>Make that two good things.</br>  /a/ pokegirl poll results:<br><br>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1El<wbr>1f1F8zXviEONk5y0Uy2dntwVkCqrF_Hpyo5<wbr>j2yIWA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confi<wbr>rm</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Stopped wacthing pokemon after sinnoh ended and i don't regret<br>Xy have better animation but without a proper rival i can't het into it<br>Plus all the episodes repeat the same formula and are the same.

Naruto had people following it to adulthood but pokemon has mostly children audience excluding the crazy neckbeards ITT</br>  <br>Exactly my point.</br>  <br>What does self-respect have to do with anything? Are you faggot from /vp/ or something?</br>  <br> What does self-respect have to do with anything? <br> Watch a show expecting it to deliver <br> it doesnt <br> keep watching next season so it may deliver anyways <br> repeat for 18 years/6 gens <br><br>It's pretty obvious<br><br> Are you faggot from /vp/ or something? <br>I'm regular on /vp/, yeah. But /vp/ worships this show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why can't I just be having fun watching a show and hoping for something that will never happen?

The canon shipping is icing.</br></br>  <br> If I were disappointed why would I continue watching the show? <br>no self respect. You could be watching a show where shit actually happens, there's a lot of animee out there.<br><br><br> of simply understanding what I'm saying <br>You're literally saying you actively want the show to do things that you know it wont.<br>If you dont see how that's at least odd, you're retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>there's something really suggestive about the way he handles those cakes</br></br>  <br>What makes you think I'm only watching Pokemon? Is everyone from /vp/ this retarded? Listen, if you're too retarded to understand what I'm telling you then so be it. It's not my problem.</br>    <br> where shit actually happens <br><br>things happen in the show. just because he hasn't become a pokemon master doesn't mean nothing happens.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow.</br>  <br><br>underrated post</br></br>  Just started watching this, it's fucking great.<br>Let have a HnK thread</br>  Stand Proud fellow MonMusu-fags<br> "OP actually doesn't fuck up the thread title" edition. <br><br> extra clips compilation <br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br> Don't be an ignorant shit.

Roger apparently could solo Whitebeard. Luffy wants to be the new Roger, and can barely solo Doflamingo. He'd need to be a hell of a lot stronger than what he is now. If all the big bads are taken down not by singular man, but a group of weaker men, then that would mean that this generation is weak as shit.</br>  <br>Garp is grandpa Monkey, don't underestimate him.</br>  <br>It has little.</br>  <br> Whitebeard, while sick and injured and dying stood up to the top marines all at once <br><br>Maybe those three all at once, but pretty sure Kaido would shit on them 1v1.</br></br></br>  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<wbr>HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</wbr></wbr>  <br>The question is how the hell is Luffy supposed to beat him. Up till now, nothing points to the direction that Luffy can take on even a single admiral, yet he's supposed to beat Kaidou, who is arguably capable of taking on Kizaru and Akainu at the same time.</br>  <br> Roger apparently could solo Whitebeard. <br>That's never been stated.</br></br>   A kaidou   <br>  Roger apparently could solo Whitebeard. <br>No, they were equals.</br></br>  <br><br>It distinguishes the true thread and is supposed to prevent multiples like this.<br><br>Unless you want it becoming the same level as Narutofags.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not showing his eyes <br>Kaido is Doflamingo all over again.</br></br>  <br> Kaidou wants to be hardcore but Shanks won't let him </br>    <br> Two alliances Vs Kaidou <br>One can only hope. I'd definitely prefer this over Kaido/Kid/Apoo/Hawkins vs Luffy/Law/Big Mom.</br></br>  <br>He'll steal his shades</br>  <br><br>I thought the statement was that Whitebeard could at best fight Roger to a draw, but otherwise lost their battles.</br></br>  <br><br>Not while it is 'live' - but it has greater value when searching on the archives.</br></br>  <br>Luffy won't solo any Yonko until Blackbeard, for now with Kaido going suicidal again, he'll probably fight another Yonko<br><br>I would then guess the all of the Strawhats will take on the weakened victor of that battle, just like when Blackbeard's crew beat a weakened Whitebeard<br><br>Shanks will be taken out by another Supernova alliance or Blackbeard, which leaves Luffy with defeating Blackbeard alone</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off release day cancer.</br>  <br>This multiple would have happened anyway, they posted it a few seconds apart from each other.<br>Multiples are prevented simply by making it possible to find the thread in the catalog by searching for the keyword (One Piece in this case). Do you know that you can search the catalog?<br>If it's in the title or somewhere else in the OP is fucking unimportant.</br></br></br>  <br>no it was stated that ROGER could fight whitebeard to a draw<br><br>not the other way around <br><br>Whitebeard is the marker you compare everyone else to. Roger's fight style apparently has some trick to it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure when Whitebeard was introduced it said he fought Roger as equals.</br>  <br>Nah. Roger was the king due to all the conquering and sight seeing he did. Not by all he defeated.</br>  <br>It was.</br>  <br>Kid is so cute.</br>  <br><br>See;<br><br><br>I know you can search in the catalog.<br><br>However searching in the archives is a bitch as it brings up every instance of one piece if done normally - searching subject field only brings up subject field.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> of course I am <br><br>Alvida had no idea who she was talking to</br></br></br>  How hilarious that mangastream gave manga panda so much hate for translating Fujitora's conversation correctly in the previous chapter, when it was mangastream who was wrong.  <br>Roger was way older than Luffy with a lot of experience behind him, when he ruled the Grand Line.</br>  <br>Just realized, this implies that when roger and whitebeard fought, no one on white beards side ever died.</br>  Question: How the fuck did Shanks take on this beast, how strong is he? The fight would seem ridiculous because there's literally an order of magnitude between theirs respective sizes...  <br>Also buggy says without a doubt whitebeard is the strongest pirate. Kaidou fags btfo<br><br>I take buggy's word over everything</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Lao G.</br>  <br> rubber man vs quake </br>  <br>Whitebeard is dead</br>  God Usopp vs Captain Buggy fight where they're both scared shitless of each other when?  <br>Kaido has been defeated 7 times, captured, etc.<br>It is most likely a mistranslation saying he's the most durable since both panda and stream translate badly.</br></br>  <br><br>WB isn't alive anymore though.</br></br>  So does kaido know doffy is done for or not?  <br><br><br>Last thread or the one before that people were discussing creature over man which was the strongest during whitebeard's reign</br></br></br>    <br>Shanks defeated Kaido day before Marineford if Laws statement that he can't be reasoned with holds true.</br>  <br>Soon. The warlord system is closing in on dismantle. Buggy will have to go or stay in the new world.</br>  <br>Fucking western assholes! Because of them WB's badass Jolly Roger must be changed.</br>  So now that the arc is ogre, what has been the most satisfying moment in the entire arc?<br>For me it was this one</br>  Poor Doffy. Got his kingdom taken away from him, got his ass kicked, betrayed by Viola and Law, Trebol and Vergo are most likely kill, and now a suicidal,immortal giant wants to personally murder him.  <br>benbe D. man?</br>  <br><br>I don't think Kaidou is going to fight the starwhats. Luffy is strong with his new, MUH GAINS skip leg day-gear, but Kaidou appears to be an endurance fighter, while Luffy is a one pump chump.</br></br>  <br>Well shanks was able to use his conq. haki to knock out whitebeards men when he boarded their boat. Rodger probably did the same to avoid other casualties or maybe they were the only 2 that fought.</br>  <br><br> defeated <br><br>We don't know that for sure - Shanks just stopped Kaidou going to MF.<br><br>Maybe he showed him a cool place to try and suicide?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you mean lock doffy up in his rape basement until he produces a smile. Every morning he comes down and asks Doflamingo if he made another smile. Doffy says I told you I can't. Gets raped. Door slams shut. repeat<br><br>It's like a modern day prometheus</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well Luffy does have someone in his crew who matches that.<br><br> inb4 the never-ending battle of Zoro and Kaidou <br><br>10/10 would read.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What would happen if you cut up a devil fruit in half and two people ate one half each?<br>Eating the whole thing doesn't seem to be mandatory since Kaku peels his.</br>  <br>Luffy oneshot Hajrudin just fine</br>  <br>Why do I love these?</br>  <br>Oda already answered this<br><br>there will always be someone who eats one piece first. The other pieces loses it's power immediately<br><br>even if it's down to nano or picoseconds.</br></br></br></br></br>   &gt;implying Shanks &gt; Kaido   <br>I never knew I wanted this until I read this post.<br><br> Zoro learns how to cut lifeforce </br></br></br>  <br>followed up by the complete letdown of robin not even needing observation haki to stop hakuba completely. Rebecca barely dodge his shit. Hopefully kaidou fight will be much better.</br>  <br><br>Strongest Man=/=Strongest Creature. <br><br>Also, he's dead. Kaidou took on the title next.</br></br></br></br>  Kaidou's reveal did not disappoint me in the slightest. I actually love how he has a goofy side to his character.<br><br><br>maybe not the most satisfying one, but when Doflamingo activated the birdcage it was a truly 'oh shit' moment.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well either that or they both give up because they can't win.<br><br> Kaidou goes off and cries because he can't die again <br> SH continue </br></br></br></br></br>  OFFICIAL YONKOU STRENGHT RANKING<br><br>1. Kaido<br>2. Whitebeard<br>3. Blackbeard<br>4. Big Mom<br>5. Shanks</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> luffy punches the everliving shit out of him <br> he does nothing <br> 'WHY CAN'T I FUCKING DIE ALREADY' <br> they spend the whole arc together trying to figure out a way to kill Kaido </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm the one who posted that possibility when the chapter came out, it was a joke.<br>If Law's statement is true, then Shanks couldn't reason with him.<br><br>So far Kaido has not acknowledged that other people are standing near him in any way, even though they are high tier supernovas standing before him.<br><br>He's just talking to himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could Urouge beat Mihawk?</br>  <br> Shanks that low </br>  <br>don't start with this shit.<br><br><br>he's too merciful. He would never fight him in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  Maybe Kaido wanted to fight Whitebeard so he could get killed, but now that he's gone, nobody and no method can achieve Kaido's death.<br><br>Kaido is a depressed suicidal man bored with the fact that nothing threatens his mere immortal existence, so he declares a war on the whole world to finally get a challenge and his possible death.</br></br>  <br>He is handicapped, he also lost to pre devil fruit Blackbeard.</br>  <br><br>Well I was referring to Zoro - since he is also pretty durable.</br></br>  <br>that would be pretty fucking cool. Poor guy.</br>  <br> they spend the whole arc together trying to figure out a way to kill Kaido <br>I want to see this.</br></br>  <br><br> Putting someone who's dead </br></br>  BUGGY YONKOU WHEN  <br>WB lives through BB you stupid faggot.</br>  <br>Never.</br>    <br>right after Ace becomes a shichibukai</br>  Is Urouge really strong or are you guys just joking?  Kaido was just introduced and he's already my favorite villain  a rare picture of brooke actually interacting like a human being and not just making jokes  <br>His persistence since the very beginning means he'll be a big deal in the end game. If he became Shichibukai, he'll probably work his way up to Yonkou later when the existing ones have been BTFO.</br>  <br>he truly is the best pirate of them all.<br><br> no but seriously, we're joking, that doesn't change the fact that I personally love him and want to see more of him </br></br></br>  <br>He has wano samurai following him. He stronkgs</br>  <br><br> Buggy trains with Conquer's Haki <br> he becomes pic related at a Yonko level </br></br></br>  <br> being a dressrosa baby <br><br>Naruto ending brought along the cancer here.</br></br></br>  gosh I want Caesar to join so fucking much<br>his interactions with the other SH are so fucking great<br>is there any way for his DF to be written with the 2 and 9 nips letters so it fits the number theory?</br></br>  <br> he also lost to pre devil fruit Blackbeard <br><br>Nah, blackbeard managed to scar him and thats all we know. <br>Couldve been a draw, or shanks couldve kicked BBs ass and when he reached out to help his defeated foe back up BB used the opportunity to get a cheap hit in and flee.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll die before Usopp does.</br>  <br> he didn't read the Urouge Gaiden </br>  <br>Well, yeah, most people will die before God does.</br>  <br> tfw he will become horribly downleveled like Robin </br>  <br>I think he's just blind... His eyes seem closed.</br>  <br><br>look at these threads. It's nothing but shitty, old jokes and people drooling over how luffy will manage to beat Kaidou.<br><br>These threads have become unredeemable shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's evil buggy chained. Aint happening.</br>  <br>Maybe he can be the Straw Hats scallywag. Like that guy they keep locked up on board as if to say to other pirates "don't fuck with us "</br>  <br>I think his scar may have been made by WB and that's why he's cursing him at the end of this chapter<br>since he was the only one who could give him a glimpse of death</br></br>  How can Kaido have haki, if he has no will to live? Checkmate oda fags  <br>He wants to live to die.</br>  Calling it now, the reason Kaido wanted to go to the Marineford War was that he hoped Whitebeard could kill him. Before Shanks stopped him.  <br>Who said Kaido has haki?</br>   Kaido has a huge bounty <br> Whenever the crew has the need for some money Kaido lets himself get "captured" by one of his crewmen <br> they take the bounty money <br> execution fails <br> ??? <br> profit <br><br>rinse and repeat</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chopper growing balls during the Curly Hat Crew timeskip was one of my favorite bits from this chapter.</br>  <br>you're too late, see<br/></br>  All the potential end game antagonists look like chumps compared to Kaidou. Blackbeard, Akainu, Gorosei. How the fuck is this nigger not the final boss.  you guys do realize that they were absent for a day? <br>it wasn't a freaking time skip</br>  <br>Akainu &gt; every pirate</br>  <br>Kaidou will be the next Lucci. So in the way he will be the finale.</br>  <br>explain</br>  <br><br>Law will kill him.</br></br>  <br>Damn. No worries though, Luffy will punch his head off sooner or later.</br>  <br>He won't fight seriously because he legit wants to die.<br><br>Also, how in the fuck are the Gorosei potential end game?</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly, no. "Ga" and "su" aren't even numbers.</br>  <br>At the absolute least he'd have to have some sort of redemption arc first. People seem to forget he was presented as the first or second biggest asshole in the series and constantly killed his own followers. Don't get me wrong, I like him being around, but what's the worst any current strawhat has done in the past? Probably Robin for helping Crocoboy, otherwise what, Nami stealing shit? Zoro being a bounty hunter? Nothing that comes close to killing all his underlings and experimenting on children.</br>  He doesn't have a devil fruit because if he had he could simply sink himself  <br>Not him but whoa nigga, are you serious right now?</br>  <br><br>Yeah him getting his shit pushed in by a half dead WB was merely a ruse.</br></br>  <br>Nah Chopper just really hates Caesar</br>  <br>He got rekt just as hard as the rest of the rookies by Kizaru. He's in no way stronger than Apoo, X-Drake or Hawkins.</br>  Okay this has nothing to do with Kaido but reading this thread has it ever been explained how the fuck Buggy and Shanks could be on the same ship yet one becomes a total useless jobber and one becomes one of the strongest pirates in the world?<br><br>Why was Buggy even on the ship like what the fuck, he didn't even fight?</br></br>  <br>Kaido is One Piece's one punch man</br>  You know what is the weirdest thing?<br><br>Kaidou wanting to die this badly pretty much confirms he doesn't have a Devil Fruit. If he did, he could just throw himself on the sea.</br></br>  <br>Never thought about that, you might be right. Why's he called Kaido of the hundred beasts?</br>  <br><br> Talks and prays to the strongest creature in the series <br> Apoo and Hawkins just shit themselves </br></br></br>  <br> Buggy <br> Weak <br>lol</br></br></br>  <br>Buggy is after treasure and wants to do it the lazy way.</br>  <br> Implying the Gorosei would ever be last boss. <br>Just because Gandhi is always posing with a sword doesn't mean they are capable of battle.<br><br>It will be Blackbeard, Buggy, Shanks or Coby, anything else would be an asspull.</br></br></br></br>  <br> get beat by entry level Luffy <br> not weak </br></br>  <br>Who said he has haki? Assuming he does, because fucking everyone does, who says will to live is what's important rather than just will to do something? Could be will to protect his crew or will to eat all the pies, who the fuck knows.</br>  <br>maybe he has 100 zoan subordinates?</br>  <br>Who gave him that scar?</br>  <br>Potential end game battle will be against either a pirate for One Piece (Blackbeard), Marines (Akainu), or WG/CDs. People theorize the Gorosei can actually fight cause their battle scars/weapons and are pretty strong because they treated an angry Akainu like an annoying fly.</br>  <br>Shanks actually cared about being a great pirated and took his time to learn from the best. Buggy was only in it for the money.</br>  <br> Why was Buggy even on the ship like what the fuck, he didn't even fight? <br>he was still a clown at that point, right?<br>maybe Roger thought he was funny and brought him on to entertain the crew</br></br></br>  <br>Urouge=gay</br>  <br><br>Doesn't make him any less based.</br></br>  <br>this was pre timeskip<br>sure, he dont have formidable firepower but his survival skills are god like</br></br>  <br>Buggy was the Nami of Roger's crew.</br>  kek'd  <br>Because Gorosei are the most corrupt and evilest bastards in the world, more than any pirate.</br>  <br> Wants to die. <br> If he has a devil fruit he can easily drown himself. <br> If he doesn't, him being a yonko would make it easy as cake to obtain one, eat it, and then drown himself. <br><br>So, is it because of MUH DIE-IN-BATTLE WARRIOR SPIRIT, Devil Fruit users confirmed for going to hell, or  he's a water logia? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whitebeard probably</br>  <br><br>I for one think the old bastards can fight.</br></br>  Anyone else disappointed it wasn't Doflamingo that killed himself?  <br>I'm glad someone else noticed that</br>  <br>why is everyone underestimating BB? he has two of the most powerful DF in the world + he's a fucking tank + there's still something we don't know about his body + he's actually clever</br>  <br>I love Chopper and Caesar's dynamic. It's one of the few times you see Chopper treat someone like shit and get easily irritated. He's not even scared of Caesar anymore. Wanna see them butt heads more.  Why can't Caesar just join the fucking crew. </br>  <br>He just loves treasure, he doesn't really care about being the best. We've never really seen buggy duke it out 1v1 against someone though</br>  I don't want any of the 'older' characters to have gotten stronger over the timeskip. It wouldn't make sense for them to get exponentially stronger because what is two years when you're already middle aged?  <br>Imagine it, Luffy's Kinkg Kong Gun vs Kaidou's fists, it'll truly be a fight to the death based on guts and willpower. Like Lucci vs Gear 2<br><br>Unlike the shitty weakened Mingo.</br></br></br>   Kai D. Ou <br><br>Fuuuuuuuark.</br></br>  <br> Buggy </br>  <br>I've always assumed they were hilariously strong. I mean the Gandhi nigga always holds a sword and they're all scarred</br>  <br> Kaido actually went to go intercept Whitebeard because he wanted to die <br><br>How did this man become a Yonko? I wonder if wanting to die is only a recent thing for him.</br></br></br>  <br>hahahaha, thank you so much, god i have to start paying more attention..</br>  <br>it was a timeskip of a few hours<br><br><br>I know but numbers in japanese can be written in an awful lot of ways depending on the context</br></br></br></br>  <br>The first damn thing we see him do is try to commit suicide, so die-in-battle-warrior-spirit seems to be out. Unless that was him attacking the earth.</br>  <br>No, the Tenryubito are the most corrupt. They go around the Gorosei all the time with CP0 and do what they want. It's clear the only reason the WG and Marines obey their whims is because of the "secret" Doflamingo alluded to</br>  <br> Coby </br>  <br>luffyfags or idiots, don't mind them</br>  <br>Maybe. But didn't he have that name before he decided to make an army of zoans?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>While it's true that Shanks is a total useless jobber, it's mostly just that way because anything he does is seen as a major event in the overall story.</br>  <br><br> Kai D'oh! <br> Tries to suicide <br> Fails <br> D'oh! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's a fucking scumbag for sure<br>but remember that he actually didn't kill anybody with his gas (as fucking stupid as it is)<br>and also remember that crocodile was even worst but seems to become somewhat of a nice guy</br></br></br>  <br>Even King Kong Gun wouldn't do shit against him.</br>  <br>I do too. That's why I said they could be potential end game antagonists</br>  <br> We've never really seen buggy duke it out 1v1 against someone though <br>Except Luffy.</br></br>  I'm placing best right now for Kaido to have the Oni Oni No Mi.  Why doesn't kaido simply eat a devil fruit and then drown himself? Or why doesn't he eat two devil fruits and explode?  <br>He was distracted by Nami who stole his treasure</br>  <br>WG were behind the destruction of Ohara, and they are the ones who let Shichibukai do as they please. Have we ever seen Tenryubito do anything beyond abusing their slaves?</br>  <br>Buggy's crewmates hogged all the battles so he came out underleveled</br>  <br><br>For Mythical Zoan Fruit? I can see that.</br></br>  <br>I threw out the idea yesterday jokingly that he's eaten a shit load of zoan smiles trying to die. So he has "100" beast transformations inside him.</br>  <br> throw himself into the ocean <br> sink to the bottom <br> give no fucks <br> get bored and walk to the surface again </br></br></br></br>  So… How seriously screwed are Kidd and co right now?  <br>Cthulu</br>  <br>Urouge probably didn't even know it was Kaidou<br>and anyway the guy was planning on killing himself, why should he be scared?<br>on the other hand the 3 other guys see some giant falling from the sky and declaring war...</br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing his 'defeats' were against people like Roger and Whitebeard who have since passed. His suicidal tendencies are due to no-one being around who can harm him.<br><br>Which is why Shanks promising of new, strong opponents would be enough for Kaido to back off, As the thought of fighting another Roger gets his warrior juices flowing.<br><br> Isn't Shanks on his level? Why didn't he just fuck with Shanks? <br><br>Shanks probably ignores his requests for a duel, A way of keeping Kaido in check. "I won't fight you unless you avoid the war" etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder how Kaidou's crew puts up with him.<br><br>Having a sucidal captain who constantly wonders off trying new ways to kill himself isn't the best thing for morale.</br></br>  <br> drown <br>inb4 he has super lungs and never runs out of oxygen<br> two devil fruits <br>inb4 he has a special body like Teach and eating multiple fruits doesn't kill him</br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember reading a manga about a guy with a scary face. People kept misunderstanding him because of that face and shit happened all around him and he got a crew to fight people with even though he was a nice guy and never wanted to fight. Maybe he could be like that guy, a very misunderstood and strong guy who somehow got a crew to form around him by accident.</br>  <br>He ate THE devil fruit the permits him to swim.</br>  <br>He dosn't honestly look interested in then, it's more like he happened to land there.</br>  <br><br>He was not even slightly phased by falling from the sky. Luffy literally couldn't do jack shit to him.</br></br>  <br><br>Urouge was exactly the same vs. Kizaru though (Apoo was too though I guess) - even if he gets rekt he doesn't give a fuck and keeps the shit-eating grin and based personality.</br></br>  <br> Blow up this island and kill everyone because a meanie punched me! <br> Random woman, you are now my slave! Kill the husband </br></br>  <br> Coby <br> implying he won't be part of the marine's rogue league allied with the SH (along with Smoker) in the very last battle </br></br>  <br><br> Hundred beasts Kaidou <br> He ate a shitton of synthetic Zoan fruits to kill himself. </br></br></br>  <br><br>They've been around since the very beginning, with lots of character growth, both vowing to defeat Luffy. They'll be major players in the end game.</br></br>  <br>That's the other thing. He could just jump into water after eating a devil fruit to die. Oda fucked up it seems.</br>  <br><br>He's probably "Kaidou of the 100 Beasts" because he tried to kill himself by eating 100 Devil Fruits.</br></br>  <br><br>BBfags thinking Blackbeard wouldn't shit his pants and turn tail the minute he sees Kaidou's fucking mustache.</br></br>  <br>WG do evil things for what they believe is the greater good.<br>World Nobles are assholes who think they're gods and treat everyone like shit</br></br>  So Kaido and Akainu have similar tattoos.. maybe something to do with Wano? Will Wano possible be One Piece's first training arc? Will Luffy get some power up there, and a cool tat related to it?  <br><br><br>What if he ate a Sea King devil fruit?</br></br></br>  <br><br>The only thing that's fucked up is your power of compression.</br></br>  <br>I can already see it being fucking hilarious.<br>I love how Oda can have these hype monsters seem menacing, but have them have these ridiculous quirks.</br></br>  <br> yfw people actually don't see stuff like that <br>speedreaders need to leave</br></br>  <br>oda said he doesn't like to show training arcs as a part of the story and instead puts them as flashbacks and shit like that, so yeah</br>  <br>That would explain why "mundane" is the translation used for mangastream to describe the world. It makes sense that he's now bored because no one can actually defeat him now. Maybe just capture him temporarily.<br><br><br> Oda fucked it up <br><br>He could be similar to Blackbeard. But unlike BB, he's so powerful and with such a weird body that he can't even drown himself. Or maybe he views it as dishonorable to drown.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hes called the 100 beasts for a mythical devil fruit that turns him into a demon king Oni which consists of multiple different beasts into one big monster.</br>    <br>it gave him a headache stupid..lel</br>  <br>Devil fruit users are basically paralyzed when they get in water. Maybe he wouldn't die but he's just sink, no?<br><br> The only thing that's fucked up is your power of compression. <br>My tensile strength is stronger.</br></br></br></br>  <br> she didn't get fucked like the rest of the doffys <br>TRAITOR</br></br>  <br>Morale doesn't matter. They're scared of him so they don't dare complain or slack off. Even Doflamingo is terrified of him. And that's saying something.</br>  <br>but WG do that shit on the tenryuubito's orders</br>    <br> Baby 5 is finally happy <br><br>That's adorable.<br><br><br> Just sink <br><br>I've forgotten. Have we had confirmation yet if Brook would actually die by sinking?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Last week Mangastream mistranslated Fujitora's conversation with Fujitora as ending with sarcasm, that he basically told Akainu to fuck off.<br>While it is true that Fuji likes the straw hats and let them go, his words to Akainu were serious. A sincere sounding lie that he would capture them (panda) was accurate.<br>At least manga stream acknowledges it in this chapter in a translator note, but still, it shows that they translate off fanon rather than just what's there.</br></br></br>  <br>Brook is something completely different. He doesn't have any lungs to need air so I'm thinking he would just sink and make a lung joke while at it.</br>  <br>I don't believe he would. He can change into his spirit form and possibly haunt other objects/people.</br>   Law can "cure death" and grant immortality <br><br>Maybe he can do the reverse? Or maybe:<br><br> Kaidou's "immortality" is actually an affliction that Law can "cure". </br></br></br></br>  <br>okay, so just a power up, or just not showing the training.</br>  <br> she didn't get fucked <br>just see her happy face. She was fucked. A lot</br></br>  <br>So, a Devil Fruit?</br>  <br> Why doesn't kaido simply eat a devil fruit and then drown himself? <br><br> eat a devil fruit <br> throw himself into the ocean <br> sink to the bottom <br> give no fucks <br> get bored and walk to the surface again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaido shrecks Kid alliance off panel <br> "Hmm, admirable, perhaps what Red-hair said has some truth to it" <br> Flashback to Shanks/Kaido interception pre-war <br> "A new age has already begun, What you seek is in the new era that has decended upon the New World, Just give them time and you'll have your warriors death". <br> "And where's your proof?" <br> Shanks points to his missing arm "I've already placed my bet on them" <br> Back to present Kid alliance is looking up bloodied and terrified waiting to be finished off. <br> Kaido allows them to live, realising they are part of the era (supernova) he was told of. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>0 characters have defeated Blackbeard though. Saying Blackbeard didn't beat Magellan would be like saying Luffy didn't beat Croc just because he initially got wrecked</br>  <br>filtered</br>  <br> Urouge was exactly the same vs. Kizaru </br>  <br> get bored and walk to the surface again <br>Devil fruit users become immobile under water, how did you miss this?</br></br>  <br>Since Brook can eat and poop he could probably breath too.</br>  People severely underestimating Teach<br><br>In 3 Years and 2 Days<br>He went from being an old nobody on Whitebeard's Ship with a dead end pirate career<br>to Warlord then Yonko<br><br>it's like only Akainu and BB are progressing<br><br> ZEHAHAHA  faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy did beat croc.<br>But croc also beat luffy twice<br><br>BB lost fair and square in a fight to Magellan<br>get over it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they end up having a combo attack whefe Baby 5 turns into a naginata <br>Oda pls don't disappoint.</br></br>  <br>BB a Yonkou now</br>  HEY<br><br>How long has Dressrosa been under Loflumingo's rule?</br></br>  <br><br>Where the fuck is Blackbeard anyways?</br></br>  <br>You serious?</br>  <br> In 3 Years and 2 Days <br>What's with the "and 2 days" thing?</br></br>  /a/ help me pls, I-I'm slowly falling in love with urouge- C-can Urouge count as a waifu?  <br> all this pure speculation just to affirm your desire that shanks didn't beat kaido <br>It just says they were fighting the day before marineford, and then only shanks shows up.<br><br>Pretty cut and dry to someone who's not trying to force the story to be different than what it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Devil fruit users become immobile under water <br>They can move but they can't swim.</br></br>    <br>On the otherhand<br> Crew in mortal peril / opponent's about to kill a crewmember <br> Kaidou steps in to sacrifice himself to protect crew from getting hurt <br> Kaidou-sama ! !

WHITEBEARD BTFO.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Husbando, you tremendous faggot.</br>  <br>I can see Smoker defecting, but Coby is more likely to be the new admiral when all the old corrupt ones are gone.</br>  If Kaido wants to die then why doesn't he impale his heart or behead himself?  <br> Old nobody with dead end pirate career <br><br>You have it wrong. Teach has been plotting that to happen. To say he was a nobody on whitebeard's ship is just taking it at face value. He purposely gave up leadership positions.</br></br></br>  What if the scar was made when Kaidou got his heart removed?<br>What if is the same as the dead man's chest?</br>  <br>One day in Fishmen Island and one day in Punk Hazard and Dressrosa.</br>   Look at me! I'm Mr. Kaido!   <br>I'm willing to bet it was more like <br><br>than a straight up fight.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop this!</br>  <br>Within an hour after he got doused with poison, he broke Magellan.<br>Compare to Luffy who recovered for three days vs Croc and who recovered for like 5 days from Magellan.</br></br>  <br>they tried to sever his head with a fucking guillotine and the blades shattered. See where I'm going with this?</br>  <br>10 years</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's exactly like this, mostly because it happens to funny. I don't understand where people get the idea that a guy who's supposedly unkillable would be killed by something like drowning.</br>  New furry waifu, Chopper love interest, new crew member amirite? <br>Zoan?</br>  <br>Are all Kaidos suicidal or just that one?</br>  Kaido is the Wolverine of One Piece  <br>The past several years of OP have taken place over the span of 3 days.<br>That's almost Kubo tier</br></br>  <br> It just says they were fighting the day before marineford <br>nope</br></br>  <br>Urouge has been portrayed as the nicest person so far (aside from Luffy) from the worst generation.</br>  <br>Based on what? What you want the story to say despite that not being what it says?</br>  <br>B-But I don't want to be in a relationship with a man<br><br><br>HELP</br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be cool.<br><br>Who has the heart then? Kubo?</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you its another princess for the strawhats to save.</br>  <br>Then why isn't he asking Mihawk to do it? He probably could.</br>  <br>sure<br>but first he needs to fight the previous marines to form a new one</br></br>  <br>BB clenched his asshole so fucking hard hearing Akainu was on the Marine ship landing on the island they were on. He's still pussy beta faggot.</br>  <br>New princess.</br>  <br>You seem to be missing the central idea that regular rules of how one might get himself killed don't work on this guy, and there's no reason why that shouldn't include devil fruit-related shit.</br>  <br>Law</br>   Kaido is a joke character  <br><br>Well, there goes all the hype<br><br>Hope Big Mom can save the reputation of Yonkou now</br></br></br></br>  <br> heart in his abdomen <br>do you even know where the heart is in the human body anon?</br></br>  <br>Cheadle just got lost<br> obviously a kind of dog zoan </br></br>  <br>Which means: WG=Lawful Evil, CDs=Chaotic Evil.<br>Who's a better fit for the final villain role?</br></br>  <br>And a lot of shit has happened in those 3 days.</br>  <br>Pic related<br><br><br>BB not taking on Akainu is akin to him not taking on Shanks' crew. He realized it wasn't a good decision and would impede plans.</br></br></br></br>  How can you see this 'suicidal tendencies' thing to give us some great comedy?<br><br> Perona uses negative hollow in the 2nd war against Kaido <br> They all wait for it's effects <br> Kaido's expressions is completely the same <br> We haven't seen his face because <br>    it's in a non-moving state of constant sadness  <br> "It didn't work! because.. he's already the most depressed a man can be!!!" <br> Kaido - The strongest man PHYSICALLY in the world.. " <br> "...Yet his heart is said to be the weakest in the New World" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>far more interesting than a straight up ruthless motherfucker with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br><br>I assume you complain about Kizaru as well?</br></br></br>  <br>that was before the TS if I recall correctly</br>  <br>I actually like that he's a serious threat but still has a comedic edge to him.</br>  <br>Narutobabby detected</br>  <br>Actually he said<br> I don't want this fight to happen yet <br><br>Akainu was willing to chase Luffy but not willing to chase Blackbeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One day on Punk Hazard and one day in Dressrosa.<br>You know they didn't happen on the same day because of Law's demands ("If tomorrow's newspaper doesn't say you quit Shichibukai...")</br></br>  I know that the One Piece world is full of strange powers, but a macical power that protects you actively from any form of death (breaks the rope when they hang you, or breaks the guillotine when they behead you) has to be a devil fruit.<br><br>So let's say Kaido ate the immortality paramecia. Nothing can kill you, not even sinking in sea water. Remember that sea water WEAKENS df users, but does NOT deactivate the powers, so Kaido would just feel really weak at the bottom of the sea but he would not be killed by the pressure nor the water in the lungs.<br><br>Now, what's the second weakness of a DF user? Eating another DF, it makes you explode. Kaido thought this would be a good idea, so he ate 100 SMILES. But he didn't die, even though now he can transform into 100 beasts.<br><br>As for him being a yonko and wanting to die at the same time, I guess his desire to create the "biggest war ever seen" is a way to force the entire world to fight him, until there's someone actually able to land the fata blow on him. The reason he wanted to go to marineford was butting in a big war between the entire marine force, the entire whitebeard fleet with all the allies, and the whole shichibukai with the hope of getting killed by someone strong.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>go back to whatever edgy manga you beat your dick on.</br>  <br>yes, because Oda has never gone back and expanded on minor plot points and mentions and revealed them to not be what we thought they were.<br><br>idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>True. Sorry I forgot.<br><br>3 days then</br></br></br>  the important thing is now Kaido is going to kill all of super novas and take control of them.  <br><br> crew cheers for kaidou and he gains more followers <br> kaidou just wants to an hero in peace <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please happen</br>  <br> Now, what's the second weakness of a DF user? Eating another DF, it makes you explode. Kaido thought this would be a good idea, so he ate 100 SMILES. But he didn't die, even though now he can transform into 100 beasts. <br>I wouldn't mind this if it wasn't Blackbeards whole thing about being able to eat other fruits.</br></br>  What's up with the Yonkou and no ambition?<br> Kaido: just want to die <br> Wb: just want a family <br> Shanks: just want to drink <br> Big Mom: just want to eat candies </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's perfect. Not every character that is a hulking behemoth has to be characterized as a brutish world destroyer. Plus it contrasts his fan rumored reputation so perfectly, it makes him incredibly hilarious. But not in a mockery way.</br>  <br>I like it</br>  <br>It was a complicated cut.</br>  <br>yeah, nevermind that he is a fucking giant with beyond super human physical power as described by literally anyone</br>  <br>tokyo ghoul baby pls leave and stay leave</br>  <br>what about BB? He seems pretty ambitious</br>  <br>Why are you looking down on other people's ambitions?</br>  <br><br>Because it explains why no progress has been made in the NW.<br><br>They are all strong as fuck to keep anyone from progressing through the NW, but don't have enough ambition themselves to do anything. <br><br>That's why there's even more of a deadlock than first thought. <br><br>I think BB is changing this I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no ambition <br><br>Anon, they've already become rulers of the sea. Far as we know, they've already accomplished their ambitions and are just relaxing now.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything you said has sense, but I don't think Kaido's inmortality is from a devil fruit, since then he could die using sea stone.</br>  So whose pirate flag/symbol was on the belt of that dude Sanji defeated? Oars or Kaido?  <br>When you can get anything you go after what you really want. Its just those with power dont want more power it seems.</br>  <br>Tezuka as fuck.</br>  <br><br>because the yonko knows that one piece isn't worth it for them.<br><br>so they just chill and try to expand their territories as much as possible.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no ambition <br> proceed to list ambitions </br></br>  <br>Not him but Kizaru actually is a straight up ruthless character with no redeeming qualities. Getting high is not a redeeming quality.<br><br>Kaido, however; is based.</br></br></br>  <br>Now I'm imagining Marineford with the wild card of Kaidou running around causing mayhem. I wonder if it would improve Marineford but I doubt it.</br>  <br>He's the only Yonko really going after One Piece. Which is why he'll be end game antag for Luffy.</br>  <br>Almost certainly Kaido, since he was using a zoan type fruit.</br>  <br> Kaido thought this would be a good idea, so he ate 100 SMILES. But he didn't die, even though now he can transform into 100 beasts. <br><br>I like this theory the most. makes much sense given the title of the "Strongest creature" alive.</br></br></br>  <br>yes but he has a really goofy side to him. Same thing with Kaidou apparently. I wouldn't mind Kaidou being actually a nice guy and all, but after everything we've heard about him from others I have my doubts.</br>  <br> no redeeming qualities. Getting high is not a redeeming quality. <br>fuck off</br></br>  I just realized Shanks probably told Kaido<br> Listen Kaido, Whitebeard went to Marineford to die as a warrior. <br>Kaido probably shed a single tear and understood</br></br>  <br> Having depression to a point where you just want to kill yourself is a joke. <br>You what, m8?</br></br>  <br>yiff in hell</br>  <br>Kaido is truly a bro. Best yonko.</br>  <br>I believe it</br>  wait so does this mean when luffy fights kaido he'll actually kill him when he beats him? Cuz everytime luffy beats someone they either get away or are captured by the marines. and since kaido can't be executed does that mean he can only be beaten if you kill him?  I think the problem with Kaido's character is that it's so easy to have him not kill anyone now, since he has that sucidal crap going on <br><br>Kidd and friends will most certainly survive this encounter just because Kaido doesn't care</br></br>  <br>I think we need to see a bit more of Kaido before we can say for sure if he actually, desperately wants to die or if he keeps trying outlandish methods of suicide just for shits and giggles</br>  <br>I don't even think Luffy is going to defeat Kaidou alone in the first place. I don't see him winning in a 1vs1 against ANY of the yonko aside maybe from Blackbeard.<br><br>he'll probably suffer from a semi-comic defeat or something</br></br></br>  <br>They would also most certainly survive this encounter because it's One Piece where 2 people died</br>  <br>I think the most likely outcome is for him to become a future ally after Luffy beats him. They'll probably respect each other as warriors and spar 'n' stuff. I can't wait.</br>  So if Kaidou can't die despite numerous attempts, does that mean that even eating multiple devil fruits can't kill him?  <br>We know he killed off Moria's crew. Nigga can kill.</br>  <br>It would be except if he does not fear death, or even desires it, then it's highly possible he assumes others are the same and kills without hesitation.<br> confirmed already he full killed Moriah's crew <br>Also if he gave Moria those huge cross section scars then he basically cut moriah in half...<br>So I'm not too worried about it</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> people think that kaidou defeated moria's crew because he's an asshole <br> he only wanted to push moria to get stronger so he can get on his level someday and finally kill him <br><br>a yonko we don't deserve</br></br></br></br></br>    I think there really shouldn't be any doubt that that by the end of the series Teach is going to be the strongest character in the series, besides luffy that is. But we should also consider that before the timeskip blackbeard was literally one shotted by a half-dead whitebeard missing half his face, and even after gaining the quake fruit he still had no control over it, he undoubtedly got stronger during the timeskip, but we need to remember he is still gaining strenght as we speak.<br> At the moment i think it goes something like this<br><br>  pre timeskip Teach with the quake fruit is on thee same level as Doflamingo <br>  post-timeskip Teach should be at least Admiral level and possibly stronger than Big Mom </br></br></br></br>    Can big mom eat kaido  OKAY GENTLEMEN!<br><br>HOW DO WE KILL THE KAIDOU?</br></br>  <br>That could be the reason his nickname is "100 beasts".</br>  It is so obvious that the only chance the supernova have to win against Kaido is to<br>Give him a will to live.<br><br>Funny story that's what luffy already did with Robin.<br>I predict Kaido as final Nakama.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy makes Kaido see the the beauty of life, stopping the suicidal thoughts.</br>  <br>Luffy isn't going to beat Kaido by himself. We're past the point of Luffy taking on the antagonists by himself.<br><br><br>Strawhat x Blackbeard War will be one of the final arcs I bet.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>10/10</br></br>  <br>By undoing the Ope Ope no Mi procedure that made him immortal.</br>  Luffy beating Kaidou in a fist fight would be a complete asspull and you know it.  <br>Sengoku needed Garp.</br>  <br>Depending on how he does it. We never know.</br>  <br>as it would be Luffy beating Akainu in a fist fight. Your point being? There's no escaping these cliches, we all know it's going to happen.  Sadly. </br>  <br>Is this shit confirmed, though? A lot of the early villains get wrecked so hard it seems they die, also a lot of red shirts are fall in battle, or are implied to fall in battle. There's that guy who gets cut clean in half during the Skypeia arc.</br>  <br> Complete asspull <br><br>And that's why it's not going to happen. Luffy has allies now. He won't be taking on anyone by himself any longer. Unless you think Luffy beat Doffy by himself.</br></br></br>  <br> I know I will ate another fruit to explode <br> let's just eat fake ones right it's not like anything will go wrong lol </br></br>   Hawkins, Kidd and Apoo shitting themselves <br><br>kek, and these niggas wanted to take down Shanks?</br></br>  So now that we are on our way to Wano, will this character be introduced? The hair looks like Scopper's hair.  <br>Garp one shot Marco off the execution platform and Marco never tried a second time.<br><br>Kizaru had to have a VA slap seastone on Marco while he was distracted by a death thro of whitebeard, then repeatedly shoot Marco (in the back).</br></br></br>  <br>What if Kaidou joins them in taking down Shanks?</br>  <br> One of the four rulers of the sea falls into your backyard while you're sleeping <br> Not shitting yourself </br></br>  <br>I got a boner for depressed inmortal characters.</br>  <br>Also Marco bitchslapped Aokiji when he tried to kill Luffy and Aokiji never tried a second time</br>   Eat a devil fruit <br> Go to the sea <br> ????? <br> Suicide </br></br></br>  One Piece getting lead CP next issue.

They removed the silly boys hitting at Miki at the shopping mall and made Kurumi somehow super competent compare to the rest of the people that fell prey to zombie.  Animation error on the door sign at 10:33. I wonder how they missed it.  <br>yes, that's the joke, congrats on figuring it out</br>  <br>I still can't draw as well.</br>   removing every other character from the mall <br>For what purpose?</br>  What's the purpose of fucking up the timeline like this and filling almost half of the anime with flashbacks?  <br>Shovel is the tomboy, Miki is just a slutty boy.</br>  <br>But the color fading out and Kurumi becoming The One was the best part of the episode.</br>  Interesting.  <br>They finally dropped the ball and it was going so well too.</br>  <br>All it confirmed or me was that they were crazy lesbians for each other. Previously just thought they were friends.<br><br>Also this anime is making me a manga snob. Everything they change is worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Just the stream, downloading the subs.</br>    They need to stop cramming that fucking dog into everything, Jesus.  <br>Their relationship reminds me of those 2 girls from corpse party that were in a similar situation and the other girl leaves and consequently dies too.</br>  <br>But there's a reason audio is better on vinyl and it's not a technical reason, they just fuck it up on purpose on the CDs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudn<wbr>ess_war</wbr></br>  <br>That's no way to talk about Megu-nee.</br>  <br>I wouldn't talk about Megu-nee like that, I love her.</br>  <br>You can't expect every episode to be 10/10, no anime has ever done that before.</br>   Megu-nee suddenly in the car <br><br>They don't even care anymore.</br></br>    <br>I would guess because it's harder to animate and the VA are too expensive.</br>  <br>Yeah, I agree. The mall episode and the other survivors were the best thing about that entire volume.</br>  I'd let her eat my brain  <br>That's real art.</br>  <br>According to the anime timeline I thought this was taking place before she died or something?</br>  "It was like the ending of the movie we saw a long time ago."  <br> implying all the past three have been 10/10 </br>  Is the anime any good?<br>I read up to 35 the other day and I forgot the anime was airing.</br>  EP3&gt;EP2&gt;EP4=EP1<br>I still love it.</br>  <br>Its death will probably be the last episode or something.<br><br><br>This was the only good part of this episode...but it was so good.<br><br>Did anyone else think the ending was like painfully corny? The song was great but I feel no emotional connection towards 'whats her face' at all so it all felt kind of forced?

At least the cool guy (was he a medical student?) and the girl who NTRs Kei?</br>  <br>Couldn't be assed to search the archive for 36 and 37.<br>Did read 38 earlier today.</br></br>  <br>I was expecting camera to pan out while Kei slowly bends towards Miki.</br>  I keep forgetting that Miki wears garter belts. Every time I catch a glimpse of 'em I just get this ravenous surprise boner. Fuck.  Any shots of Miki's delicious garters?  <br>I wish I was as stupid as you so my raging boner occurres more often.</br>  Why is Kurumi so shit? she ruined the whole episode.  I really like the manga, but it says a lot about it when HOTD's outbreak is more realistic than this. Really? No quarantine or anything? Everything goes to shit in one fucking day?  <br>Memory of a goldfish, anon.<br>Memory of a goldfish.</br></br>  <br>Miki pls.</br>  <br>She has as little (maybe even less) dialogue in the manga, you serious?</br>  <br> everything is flashback worthy <br>That's the fucking thing though it shouldn't be a flashback. You expect me to believe a teacher would let a student to drive a car who has no experience in it?</br></br>  <br>The zombies are the worst part of this series. They stopped being relevant a long time ago, besides zombie Megu.</br>  <br> audio is better on vinyl <br>Lol. It demonstrably isn't</br></br>  <br>Her character is more fleshed out there, you can see her fall in love, you can see her overprotecting Miki. It's not all about how many lines the character has.</br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loud<wbr>ness_war</wbr> <br>It wasn't even emotional. The song felt corny as fuck. This episode is the very definition of manufactured drama.</br></br>  <br>Who said there wouldn't be any /mu/tants in Gakkou Gurashi?</br>  Ruu appears fucking everywhere, it's the tanuki all over again.  <br>That's not what I wanted to quote, damn it.</br>  Didn't anyone told those idiots to not use ELEVATORS in case of emergency?    <br>People lose common sense in panic.</br>  So I take it this episode was shit?   using an escalator in an emergency situation <br> feeding the useless dog precious supplies <br> leaving the safehouse alone and unarmed <br>this anime is still getting better and better <br> Miki best girl </br></br></br></br>  <br>It was sub par and is setting a trend of perpetual flashbacks that don't need to be flashbacks and weren't flashbacks in the manga.</br>  <br>They even get a kiss  in a dream. </br>  Why did they overdramatize Kurumi getting to the car? There is too much action in the anime.    <br>You really think that the teacher is still alive?</br>  <br><br>*elevator, sorry</br></br>  <br>It's kind of silly to have her origin flashback story in the 4th episode. They could have just not had her in the first 3 episodes and then introduced her in the 4th. The decisions they are making are so questionable. Also that fucking dog.</br>  <br>It's not that vinyl is good but CDs are made bad.</br>  that ending  <br>No, people like to exagerate.<br>Some retards even think Megu-nee is alive in the anime.</br></br>  As a filthy fucking secondary the only thing that keeps me interested in this shit is Yuki's sanity. Even the zombie gimmick has taken its course.<br><br>Man, I knew I should have just read the manga when I had the chance.</br></br>  Shovel chan a best  <br>Nah. Loved the classical touch to the ending.</br>  <br>She's Daryl if he was a cute little girl. There has to be action.</br>  <br>This is an imageboard, not a thumbnail board.<br>Stop using tumblrshit.</br></br>    <br> muh reading comprehension <br><br>No I'm saying they should've shown the bathroom scene before the outing because they're dragging it out unnecessaryly now.</br></br></br>  <br>They're blowing it.</br>  <br>Exactly, especially because they didn't give her any role whatsoever. She was even more invisible than Megu-nee. The direction is really sub-par.</br>  <br><br>Well no shit. Go read the manga.<br>Everybody knows it's superior anyway.</br></br></br>    there will be a happy ending, right?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Best girl of this season, no doubt.</br>  <br> leaving out the shovel <br><br>Nigger what are you doing.</br></br></br>  <br>I really like it how she kicked dents into the car roofs. She isn't only the best, but strong as fuck.</br>  <br>Shovel a filthy slut and worst girl.</br>  <br><br>you're right, havent noticed it when I was downloading it</br></br>  They cut out the part with the other survivors so people can't shitpost how much of a slut Miki is.  <br>Why couldn't they do that for Kurumi too? I guess they just couldn't stop every character from being a slut.</br>  <br>Instead they have her holding hands for half of her appearance and wearing garters in bed.<br><br>She's even sluttier than I thought.</br></br></br>  <br>God damn you shovel fags are annoying, and this episode isn't doing you any favors.</br>  <br>It's not slutty if they're both girls.</br>  <br>Just reread the chapters she's in. <br><br> she's concerned when her friend trips <br> they make two signs together <br> she thirsts for the leaders cock <br> she lectures her friend about drunks <br><br>She is in no way "fleshed out" and definitely not a character to feel attached to. She is just there to help Miki's backstory and in that regard I think the anime did it better. But as a whole the the manga builds the universe a lot better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> garter belts </br>   Caught up with mango after last week's ep <br> Finally feel safe in these threads <br><br>It's a good feeling</br></br></br>  I thought the episode was fine. The big problem is that they are cramming everything pre-outbreak at once and seeing a zombie outbreak from different perspective is rather boring, the show makes huge "back and forths" and the storytelling suffers from it.<br>No mall incident kinda ruined it.<br><br>I really liked the ending. I have a knack for blues and thought it summed up the episode pretty well.<br><br>So far, not disappointed. Granted, NNB2's episode 4 was superior but this was good as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zombie, please</br>  <br>You should just leave. These threads are shit.</br>  <br> Boost up Shovel's relationship implications <br> Tone down Miki's interaction with guys to nonexistent </br></br>  Disappointment of the season  Anyone else feel the CG people and zombies was jarring?  <br>Shovel is the only slut now. Where is your god now, shovelfags? Even the mangaka left her as a slut when he could've changed things.</br>  <br>They both lost their lovers in the outbreak, now they need to take each other's hands to heal their hearts.</br>  This would be a lot less forced if they all carried weapons instead of just the Rize-clone.<br>The zombies are clearly slow and brain-dead, it wouldn't take much effort to keep them away with an object more than one foot in length.</br>  <br>  NNB2' episode 4 was superior <br>Of course it was, it was episode of the year.</br></br>  <br>CG people always look jarring. Too bad they didn't take advantage of it and make the zombies uncanny as fuck.</br>  <br>Calm your tits</br>  <br>But shovel is the only athletic girl in the group. Running &gt; Fighting.</br>  <br>The lack of budget is jarring</br>  <br> twitter <br>Oh no, there goes your opinion, sailing into the trash.</br></br>  <br>The girls are to cheerful for me, I miss the difference between Yuki's illusions and the reality. Kurumi and Rii should act more serious.</br>  <br>If the girls wanted to live, they would have done good to build up enough upper body strength to swing a metal rod around.</br>  <br>It would be a lot better if they were less explicit with everything. The manga is loved by so many because of its implicit nature. And introducing Miki from the start just to have her do nothing is fucking awful. The whole idea of a club trip is something WAY more outstanding than the previous theme of the show, where they just chill at the school. All the suspense is lost by having them making it only a flashback.<br><br>And fuck Taroumaru with a rake.</br></br></br>  <br>You expect me to believe that in a zombie outbreak out their entire school only these 4 girls survived?<br><br>You expect me to believe that zombies are a real thing?<br><br>You expect me to believe these girls are actually 16 years and older?<br><br>You expect me to believe that anime isn't real?<br><br>You expect me to believe that you aren't new?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem is number, you fool. You cannot keep several zombies away with a single weapon. The other girls clearly are not as athletic as Kurumi.</br>  <br>Shovel is going to die and Yuki is going to win the Mikibowl, this episode confirm it.</br>   most likely not even a week into survival <br> the mall already looks this fucked <br>Clearly japanese buildings are not made to last</br></br>  <br>Fucking moogy, that nigger has literally single-handedly ruined at least 4 generals on /vg/ that used to be good. <br><br>He is a walking definition of shit-eating wapanese.</br></br></br>  <br> Mall completely fucked <br> Building next to it is fine </br></br>  <br>Thanks for sharing the opinion of some attention whore, that really changed my mind. Guess I'll drop the show now.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? The girls were also "cheerful" in the manga. They are playing along with Yuki. You really need to re-read the early chapters.<br><br> captcha is "Select all traffic signs" and there are no fucking signs. </br></br></br>  <br>Zombies are predisposed towards breaking windows.<br><br>See the school, where they destroyed every single window including the top ones that you need a chair or something to reach.<br><br>Zombies are serious about their window destruction.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even sure how the zombies would break the wall and crack the columns.</br>  <br><br>'Cause we all know, zombies always prey on the sweet smooth windows.</br></br>  <br><br> muh athletics muh athletics <br>Do you think the majority of people who went to war were athletic?<br>It doesn't take any effort to hold up a pointy stick and thrust it about in the air, any athletics beyond that were gained by necessity of living in a tough environment.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Go legacy bitch. </br>  <br> moogy <br>I forgot that literal fedora existed. The actual definition of elitist weeaboo, knowing some japanese won't change that.</br></br>  <br>  most like not even a week into survival <br>See this is why you don't make assumptions, they make you look retarded.</br></br>  <br><br>m8, even if this was an entire year into the situation, the mall wouldn't look that bad</br></br>  So will next episode have a short flashback during the flashback?  This has to be some kind of controlled test by Randall, otherwise the JSDF or US marines would have handled this by now  <br>Why is everything destroyed like it was bombed. Or are they flying exploding zombies around there?</br>  Why is Rii-san so sexual?  <br>Zombies just love breaking shit.</br>  <br>Unless they're all zombies too. Also, if it is widespread the army would be focusing on more important locations than some suburb or Yokohama.</br>  <br>it could not be less than a week look at all the water bottles in the room.<br>And the whole school with tables all over.<br><br>im a fan of this series but this episode was pure shit...<br> taroumaru was the dog's name from the start <br> zombies in the mall dont go home at night <br> bringing the dog from the start was a mistake , and now they also make it appear with miki in the mall <br> the ruu bear everywhere like the new tanuki thing , and the bad thing is that ruu/uni arc will not happen in the anime as far as it goes </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Still not sure why Miki was even introduced if they were gonna do the Mall anyway. It's gonna be more jarring if they adapt when Miki tries to convince Yuki to stop pretending since she was going along with it since the first episode.  <br>She whispers "ara ara" in your ear</br>  <br>Just around Yuki. There's even some disputes mentioned between Kurumi and Rii, when she isn't around.</br>  <br>The US army can storm an entire city of terrorists within a single day, they could have cleaned up Japan before lunchtime.</br>  <br>How do they break walls?</br>  <br>Very carefully.</br>   you'll never comfort a sad and afraid Miki by holding her hand as you both sleep <br><br>Why even bother trying to live anymore</br></br>  i want to fuck a zombie  <br>Tempting.</br>    <br>Not yuri they said.</br>  Lerche turned this shit into flashbacks every episode. I haven't seen directing that bad in a while.  <br>The US Army is probably at war with another major country but I don't think this series is ever going to show up who is responsible for the apocalypse.</br>   Necrophilia when?   <br>A literal retarded girl's butt is not attractive.</br>  <br>It's not. Miki's a boy.</br>  <br>It isn't Lerche fault, is the author fault.</br>  I want Miki to bully me  <br>Sure, unless they keep trying to hold back the Megu-nee thing until the end. That would be pretty bad since most people know what's up anyway.</br>  <br>I can't stop fapping to this</br>  <br>Miki pls</br>  <br> To everyone calling her a slut </br>  <br>So this season Lerche is adapting Monmusu scene for scene 2chapters an episode. But with GG we get flashbacks that aren't needed, out of order events, things cut and anime original content. WTF man.</br>   going on a super dangerous outing for 'fun' instead of needing supplies <br><br>This makes no sense</br></br>  Why did people call Miki a slut again? She didn't like the guy at the mall, Kei did.  ED release when?  What is wrong with their bodies?  <br>Isn't the author writing the script for this and doing changes? like non-slut Miki.</br>  <br>She'd let the other drunk take advantage of her if Kei wasn't there to pull her away.<br><br> It's just because of the garters </br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with them?</br>  <br>I swear you people don't inform yourselves before posting. The fact that this adaptation is full of flashbacks is the manga's author fault since he's the one in charge of the Series Composition.<br><br>Scripts =/= Series Composition</br></br></br>  <br>They are not on my dick.</br>  <br>Series composition is the one who approves anything that happens in the script.</br>  <br>Kei's raised arm is way too long, and Miki's hair is the size of her torso.</br>  <br>Turning girls non-slut sounds more like something a producer would do to me.<br> "No she can't do that people won't like her anymore and wouldn't buy the BDs." </br></br>  <br>Then why keep Kurumi a slut? Hell, they made her even sluttier.</br>  <br>She's going to die who cares</br>  Isn't the official website supposed to have changed to a darker look about an hour and a half ago for at least another hour? It looks the same as always.  <br>You could've fooled me. The writing for this episode was nowhere neat the quality of writing for the manga. "Let's go on a field trip for fun" is absolute horse shit in a zombie apocalypse whereas in the manga it made sense that tgey needed food and supplies like clothes and batteries.</br>  <br>It changes from midnight to 4am JP time, iirc.</br>  <br>They say in the episode that they need food and supplies so it's a good occasion to go out, but it's just one line so it's easy to miss</br>    <br> they need food and supplies <br>Food and supplies which were easily available in the school store as seen in EP2.</br></br>    What was that panel that Rii had when they went under the barricades? Strange they bothered putting it in for her to immediately drop it  <br>Yeah I thought it was yuki who named the dog taromaru.</br>  Does anyone else hate this pink haired retard?<br>Such a stupid, selfish liability.</br>  <br>Probably used to cover the hole they went through. They don't need more zombies sneaking into their bedroom.  Kurumi is enough </br>  <br>She isn't a retard.</br>  <br>That liability literally keeps everyone from going insane, the real hero of our generation.</br>   screaming at the dog <br>DROPPED</br>  Episode 6 onwards should be good.  <br>This. All the rearranging of events and shit is starting to backfire on them now and things are not making sense anymore. If they just left Miki in the mall instead of having her there from the beginning for no reason, things would be fine.</br>    <br>Kurumi is the hero.</br>  <br>Kurumi confirmed for male</br>  Why did they cut out other survivors from mall?  <br>I want to dick her while she sleeps.</br>  <br> Rize-clone <br>I've yet to read a post that has something like this in it without it being complete cancer. Also zombies are slow, brain-dead but strong.</br></br>  <br>Because then the whole mall arc would take 3 or more episodes. Now it should be done next week.</br>  Miki confirmed slut but only a slut for Kei and vice versa.  <br>She's a slut for Yuki now</br>  <br>I hope they don't cut out Kurumi's visit at her home.</br>  <br>They wanted to introduce miki early but it felt kind of pointless since she doesn't really do much.</br>  <br><br>It is 2:06 AM over in Japan right now though.</br></br>  <br>I've tried to find source. B-but I cant...</br>  This episode was written by Fukami Makoto who likes military staff, badass girls and military staff + badass girls (which is quite noticeable in the second half).<br>Oh and he has also written Psycho Pass (1st season and the Movie).</br>  <br> He doesn't know. </br>  <br>The manga?</br>  Why didn't the police start evacuations ahead of time? The zombies move fairly slowly, and Miki already finished shopping so they had been at the mall quite a while since the initial scene at the highway.  <br>she has good taste. Yuki is the sexiest also best waifu.</br>  Does Miki only love Kurumi becomes she fills the hole Kei left in her heart?  Why is Rii so shit? she ruined the whole episode.  <br>You forgot to mention that he also likes lesbians, hence the removal of the leader guy.</br>  <br>Why are you so shit? You ruined the whole thread</br>  I think this may have ruined one of my fetishes. I wonder how graphically they'll animate this.  Ruined, or improved?  Guild girl a cute  <br> not wanting to be dissolved by a qt slimgirl over the course of 3 days </br>  <br>She keeps telling me not to bully Narberal, so she's annoying.</br>  <br>I admit, x character is strong. But can they beat Touch Me? And I'm not talking about World Champion Class Touch Me with his Guild-Weapon tier armor equipped. I'm definitely not talking about World Champion Class Touch Me as leader of Ainz Ooal Gown, a top ten guild, equipped with full divine gear, Guild-Weapon tier armor, and capable of the special forest-destroying skill World Break. I'm talking about World Class Champion Touch Me with 100 levels in Justice Warrior, physical stats and all resistances exceeding the limits through a cheap build and P2W, with Guild-Weapon tier armor, all of the World Class weapons owned by Ainz Ooal Gown, riding the Devourer of Nine Worlds because he's a fucking Dragonoid, and support from 9 level 100 NPCs along with 40 other level 100 characters, one wielding the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown.</br>  <br>Which character is that? The little side description thing is for Shalltear but that don't look like Shalltear</br>  <br>What if Touch Me is the final boss?</br>  <br>The text on the right is the name of the LN volume.<br>Our qt nightmarish man-eating slime monster is Solution.</br></br>  <br>Solution Epsilon, a shalltearfag.</br>  <br>Not this shit again ?</br>  <br><br>Is she just a mob on Shalltear's floor? Or a real character</br></br>  <br>Yes, that shit again, in every thread until you like it.</br>  <br>Then Ainz is boned.</br>  <br>One of the Pleiades maids. You can see her in episode 1.</br>  <br>One of the maids, gotcha. Thanks</br>  <br>She's one of the Pleiades. Like Retardberal.</br>  <br>Real character, she is one of the Pleiades Battle Maids, of which Narberal Gamma is also a member. They are meant to delay any enemies on the 9th floor with Sebas so that the guild can assemble in time. So she's Sebas' underling technically.</br>  <br>Four more episodes until we get to volume three</br>  <br>No bully.</br>  <br>A Pleiades.</br>  <br>No bully pls</br>  <br>Is it true that Sebas' appearance is based on Touch Me's in real life? I can't remember where I read it, to be sincere.</br>  <br>Oh ho, that's an interesting hypothesis anon, but can he beat Lord Ainz Ooal Gown? And I'm not talking about his Dark Hero Momon persona, the one hailed as the savior of humanity. No, I'm not talking about Momonga, the one cherished as the last Supreme Being. Hell, I'm not talking about Mobonga, the literally autistic item hoarder whom every female wants a bone of either. I'm talking about the guild master and Overlord Ainz Ooal Gown with the secret Eclipse class (which is capable of the ultimate death spell capable of overcoming all resistances and immunities, The Goal of All Life is Death), his original class as a spellcaster (which grant him every D&amp;D spell imaginable like Black Hole, Call Greater Thunder, Flight, Grasp Heart, Lightning Dragon, Obsidian Sword, Reality Slash, Time Stop, True Darkness, Wall of Skeletons, Cry of the Banshee, and Shark Cyclone) and his specialized lich classes, allowing him to summon legions of Death Knights along with legendary ones like Overlord Wiseman and Grim Reaper Thanatos, armed to the teeth with divine level items and the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown (capable of instantly summoning other high level monsters), inheritor of the Treasury, his old guild mates’ ultra-high tier armor and weapons, and the World-class items within it, each possessing the power to affect the world entirely, the spell Perfect Warrior (which allows him to use arms normally beyond his scope), complete control of every inhabitant of Nazarick, his eight loyal Guardians, seven combat maids and a butler serving him, each capable of engulfing the world in darkness single-handedly if he so desired.</br>  Best meido.  <br> Race: Shoggoth <br>Oh fuck.</br></br>  <br> Implying Touch Me couldn't solo the entire guild if he felt like it </br>  <br>that maybe the case and is really neat and all but he still couldn' t beat Madara Uchiha.<br>and im not talking about just any Madara Uchiha im talking about.......</br></br>  Since Nazarick doesn't have an official demonym associated with its inhabitants, is it okay to refer to them as Nazis?  <br>Such is the power of JUSTICE.</br>  <br>She's a qt girl, I don't know what you're worried about.</br>  <br> is it okay to refer to them as Nazis <br>Well, considering Pandora's Actor...</br></br>  <br>As expected of Ainz-sama! Your razor-sharp wit knows no limit!</br>  <br>She's bigger on the inside.</br>  <br>I kinda doubt he take on the most difficult dungeon in the game all on his own.</br>  <br>He solos raid bosses regularly.</br>  <br> Ouroboros Activate! <br> What does you desire? <br> Remove all Chakra from the world please. <br>Rekt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>World Class Items a shit.</br>  <br>i rly thought people iognored that by now<br> guess people will always fall for the madara pasta even if i don`t type it out</br></br>  <br>Do we have a stats page for her?</br>    <br>Thank you.</br>  Some things faggots never tell you:<br><br>1. Ainz has almost zero sex drive. The little bit he has left appears to be a holdover from being human. And he has no sexual organs.<br><br>2. There are 41 maids. The head maid is a homoculous that has the head of a dog.<br><br>3. Shaltear was mind controlled by a world class item to go against Ainz. After being resurrected she began to mentally fell apart due to the intense guilt at having attacked Ainz. In order to heal her guilt, Ainz very relunctantly punishes her after a period of time Shaltear spends mopping around falling apart over her guilt.<br><br>4.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 4. <br>Spoopy...</br></br>  <br> 4. <br><br>???</br></br></br>  <br>Please spare upon us information concerning the sole human NPC which resides within the great Tomb of Nazarick, the elusive Lastborn.</br>  <br>you sir, must be a very good car dealer</br>  <br>shaltear repents?<br>Picked the fuck back up</br></br>  <br> Neutral Good <br>Huh, Shize-chan's actually a good kid.</br></br>  <br>I love her reaction when Papa Bones executes her sentence.<br> Hain-hamaaaaa~ </br></br>  <br>you forgot to mention his light+zero tier keikakus</br>  <br>ShallChair kinda reminds me of Kuroko somehow. I'm half expecting her to grunt in erotic excitement at Ainz, like Kuroko does at Mikoto.</br>  <br>She starts cumming nonstop once his wedgy calcium tailbone digs into her spine.<br><br>That's some bone on bone contact. Lewd as fuck.<br><br> Flesh is but a hinderance to Ainz <br> Yfw the closest you can ever get to papa bones is to touch your exposed skeleton to his, but it will never happen </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He even think this is as much punishment to him as it is to her.</br>  Just the best girl passing by.   just finished watching AnoHana <br><br>What anime makes you sad, /a/?</br></br>  Boku no pico, it was sad seeing Pico ass being destroyed    Boku no pico.  <br>Thanks for spoilers, asshole</br>  Can anyone please explain AnoHana to me? I came in there expecting to to have some emotional impact but I felt nothing. What exactly hit you?  <br>Ghost blowjobs</br>  Which universe do you prefer anons? The old 1-6 or the new 7-8+? <br><br>Also, now that Jojolion has been going for a while do you think we'll get some EoH characters/situations? Surely there's enough content there now. <br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></br></br>  Posted in the last thread. Araki interview from Viz's release of PB v3.  <br> They actually kept the "Speedwagon cooley withdrawers" line.  <br><br>I'm glad but some other lines they translated rub me the wrong way. Just too used to Ignition One's</br></br></br>  First for Shitty Crossovers  <br>The problem with the characters is that not a lot of them were really combat oriented, or traditional fighting.<br>Only one besides Josuke that could be in the game is maybe the first rock person.</br></br>  <br>Bit hard to compare them since SBR-verse only has one complete part so far. But if it manages to keep up this level of quality ill probably end up prefering the SBR-verze.</br>  I'd like to see Araki do a proper SoL with no fighting and maybe some relationship drama. Or maybe even a noir murder mystery with minimal action.  <br>everyone will still end up getting stands, except instead of the arrow or the morioh ruins in part 8 it's finding true love or having sex in a really oddly specific position</br>  <br> finding true love or having sex in a really oddly specific position <br>I'm sure Araki will have the time of his life drawing that.</br></br>  So was it Jesus or the spin that allowed Johny to walk again?  Lets play spot the difference!<br><br>Spot the difference between regular Gio and genderswapped Gio!</br></br>  <br>I still think Tsurugi and Yasuho have a chance. Paisley park can give you a choice like 「Banana Peel」 or 「Fire Hydrant」 in 3... 2... 1... Tsurugi can do the thing where he makes someone look like someone else and get the opposing team to attack each other, or even make a stage hazard look like himself, so when they try attack it, BAM, Tsurugi bus! It's not much of a stretch to give them a couple of basic attacks, like a couple of slaps or something. You could have a swarm of oragami frogs or an oragami mecha, idk.</br>  <br>It's called Part 4: Filler is Unmakeable</br>  Anyone have a picture of Jobin licking Pucci's eyeball? That'd be pretty gay.  <br>Oooooh, I got it! THERE ISN'T!</br>  <br>Bigger eyes<br>Bigger lips<br>Boobs</br></br></br>  Are they going to reprint Stardust Crusaders in the hardback format in the US? I like just finished buying the paperback books and I don't think I'll buy them again.  Does anyone have an image explaining why the current scanlation of Part 5 is garbage? I think it involved Narancia or Bucellati  <br>No confirmation yet.</br>  <br>Is this what you're on about?</br>  <br>Thank you m8</br>  <br> Why is Dio naked <br> He wanted to show off his beautiful body <br>Araki gets it.</br></br></br>  <br> Can't draw old characters in the old style anymore <br> draws a self portrait on that very page that is practically an SD old style.  <br><br>Araki, stop lying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is it crossing Jojo into everything? Even stuff like that?<br><br>  Especially the cointainmemt board has way too much of it.  </br></br></br>  <br>Female Gio has bigger eyes and lips<br>Male Gio has bigger shoulders and chest</br></br>  <br>Wasn't his excuse that he can't draw in the old style anymore because he doesn't have original references? Nigger open a book god damn</br>  Do you people think in part 9 we might be able to come back to the original line ? I mean if you can skip time enough to create a new universe you probably can rewind it to the last one  Super Aja version when?  First for best JoJo and "BroJo"  <br>Nah, he never said anything like that.<br><br>Really even amateurs can sometimes produce reasonable facsimiles, the thing with Araki is obviously that he has been done with some of these characters for up to over 25 years and if he bothered then Shueisha would ask him for drawings of his older more well known characters all the time. Remember how many hiatuses there were in 2012?</br></br></br>  <br>I hope they have the palettes from ASB<br>Caesar looks awesome in green</br></br>  <br>I said "Shitty" crossovers.<br><br>This one is shit because the art styles don't mesh at all, seriously,3DCG does not convert into Hyperreal Anime Manlyface Ever.</br></br></br>  I loved Steel Ball Run a lot, the main characters had simple powers for most of it and had to do crazy things to get out of battles.  Combine Harvest and Echoes, what do you get out of the other end?  <br>I think it's unanimously agreed SBR a best</br>  <br>This one is easy you should pick a hard one like the difference between normal girl Narnancia and gender swapped boy Narnancia.</br>  <br>I think he just doesn't want to draw them in his old style.</br>  Does SPW exist in the new universe?  <br>Yes, the SPW Foundation was a sponsor of the SBR race.</br>  Anyone here gonna get the new Gorgeous Irene doll?  <br> Can make a stone mask on it's own <br> Fails to include a stone mask accessory with the recently released PB Dio. <br><br><br> I said "Shitty" crossovers. <br> As if any crossovers are good </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mountain Tim</br>  <br><br>Is there a better pose in Jojo? Caesar and Joseph's pose game was ridiculous. Only one that comes close for me is Weather Report giving Pucci maximum sass.</br></br>  <br><br>That's not Battle Tendency.</br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with his new style except Jonathon, Joseph and Dio are scrawny. Just because it's a different drawing style doesn't mean you need to change proportions. That's what I don't get.</br>  <br> &gt;As if any crossovers are good <br>That was my point.</br></br>  <br>I feel like a lot of the love surrounding SBR comes from it being published since this site's inception. We grew alongside the part, and came to love it as a result, and I think the same is ringing true for Jojolion as well. That's probably the same reason why so many nips hold Part 5 in such a high regard, it holds a certain sense of nostalgia for them.<br><br><br> doll <br><br> nanno desu </br></br></br></br></br></br>   i hate all people that discovered JoJo after the anime aired, even if they started reading the manga <br>Help me</br>    <br> muh sekrit club </br>  <br> Help me <br>No.</br></br>  <br>Ignore them</br>  <br>Nah I marathoned part seven after Rohan at the Louvre was officially published in english. I still think it's the best because it ended up being a really nice character drama on it's own and it seemed like Araki really kicked things up a notch.</br>  <br>Did you buy Rohan at the Louvre, anon?</br>  <br>Animefag pls go<br><br><br>I don't really care for Part 8. I'll maybe like it after its finished. This mystery shit just irks me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I bought most of the NBM Louvre collection though.</br>  <br>Going by Japan's JoJonium I'd say yes.<br>JoJonim hasn't started on PartIV yet though which has me worried.<br>Even if JoJonium doesn't go into PartIV I wonder if high enough sales in the US could spur it on to get us hard cover copies.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the issue if they started reading the manga, the issue are the people who bitch about spoilers that are several years old.</br>  <br> muh sekrit club <br> again </br></br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>I don't ever plan to read the manga but the spoilers don't bother me, It's the journey that matters, not the destination</br>   tfw you will never have a simple life and kill women   http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2013/06/12-1/dress-your-infant-u<wbr>p-like-iggy-the-dog-with-latest-joj<wbr>os-bizarre-adventure-baby-rompers<br><br> implying the Jonny one isn't the best </br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>What the hell! That is not how you show respect for best BroJo!</br>  <br> No Polnareff one <br><br>0/10</br></br></br>  <br>Letting your kid's wear their outfit seems like a good way to remember them by</br>  <br><br> no king crimson rape face </br></br>   If I try, I can draw these characters to look the way they did, but they're living, breathing things. They do end up looking like completely different people when drawn in a modern style. <br><br>So it's not that he forgot how to draw them, he's just doing it on purpose.</br></br>  <br> Gio <br>Stop this right the fuck now</br></br>  <br>No thank you. We already get yearly visits to the old universe in TSRK anyway.</br>  <br>WR looks like he's giving Pucci the finger with that weird chin thing above his hand.</br>  <br>Bad Company</br>  <br><br> &gt;/v/ </br></br>  <br>I'm really planning on naming my son Jotaro so this will go great</br>  <br>Make sure you're actually participating in his life and not touring overseas so he doesn't turn autistic like Jotaro did</br>  <br>Unless you or your wife are Japanese then please don't.<br><br>Don't put him through that.</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking it'd be more of a Swarm that can land on surfaces and transform themselves into Kanji that work like Echoes Sound Master, as well as forming a larger humanoid configuration capable of speaking in sound clips picked up by the individual Units. while the Units are controlled by the user, the larger Macrobody is Automatic.</br>  <br><br> naming your son after a degenerate hoodlum instead of a true gentleman </br></br>  <br> Alright everyone raise your hands when I call your name <br> Zack <br> here <br> Danielle <br> here <br> Jow- jo- jatarou? <br> h-here <br><br>Anon's kid proceeds to get bullied for the rest of his school life  until he turns 6'5 and gains a stand </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't, the JJBA community is called "the MLP of Anime" and since aniMLPhuckers name their kids Pinkomena and other gay shit, this would put us on the literal same level.<br><br><br>Do this if you have to be autistic</br></br></br></br>  <br>You guys do realize Jotaro is a real name and not pony shit right? My sister's japanese teacher is named Jotaro</br>  <br>I'm guessing that most JJBA fans on this board are not Japanese</br>  <br>If you aren't Japanese, it's just as autistic.<br><br>.</br></br></br>  <br> spoiler </br>  <br><br>You realize that names are names? People name their children outside of their ethnicity/nationality all the time.</br></br>  <br>Yeah if you have a white boy named Jotaro that's gonna be weird and he's gonna get bullied and probably change his name to Daniel or something when he's older, only if he's Japanese it's ok</br>  <br>Yeah and the other kids are gonna make fun of his weird ass name</br>  <br> and probably change his name to Daniel <br> Post yfw the Anon's surname is Darby, or something. </br></br>  <br> I'm really planning on naming my son Jotaro </br>  <br><br><br><br>And if you managed to succeed to get a japanese wife, burn and delete all of your JJBA stuff because no sensible woman will let you name a kid after an anime character<br><br> to be fair, no sensible woman is gonna marry you either </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and it looks dumb as shit. Naming your white kid "Jotaro" is like naming him "Jydaquarius" or something</br>  <br>   to be fair, no sensible woman is gonna marry you either </br>  <br> to be fair, no sensible woman is gonna marry you either <br>Who wants to bet the woman won't be sensible?</br></br>  <br> sticking your dick in crazy <br><br>It's not like 2d anon, 3d bitches won't stab you if you cheat or anything, if you slip up they'll cheat on you and take you to the cleaners and leave  and they'll take lil jotaro too </br></br></br>  <br>What the actual concrete benefit to society of having the entire population achieve some of a mythical standard to pure?</br>  <br>If she's not sensible, then she's got problems herself. She'd probably name the kid after one of Gwyneth Paltrow's sprogs.<br><br> pick one for husbando and another for ntr on the side </br></br></br>  <br>Josuke no question about it, but I think either Okuyasu or Mikitaka for an affair.</br>  <br>Who's second from the left?</br>  <br>Yuuya, highway star guy.</br>  <br>Highway Star guy</br>  <br><br> no kira </br></br>  <br>thanks.</br>  <br>That's handy</br>  <br>Kira is villainous, and Koichi has Yukako.</br>  one more day  <br> Is there a better pose in Jojo? </br>  <br>I look like Giorno but I have brown hair</br>  <br>Giorno has black hair, remember? He's half white, 1/4 Jap and 1/4 spaghettinigger</br>  <br>prove it faggot</br>  <br>It's over anon.... Please stop reminding me of what once was ;_;</br>  <br><br>I don't like the pacing of part 5, but man it has so much visual aesthetic. I reread it just to look at the lines.</br></br>  I want to fuck Polnareff  <br><br> Hurr BT has an anime so it isn't good anymore <br><br>Pretentious fuckwit pls go.</br></br></br></br>  <br> pinkamena is also a real name, doesnt make it any better </br>  Can she beat DIO?  <br>I want you to top yourself.</br>  <br><br>Suicide is an option.</br></br>  what if Joseph was a grill?  <br>Nigga I don't want to die and have my severed hand used for gross shit</br>  <br>Not that anon, but there's nothing pretentious about admitting that BT isn't as good as a lot of people have always made it out to be. Joseph is awesome, and Wham is cool, but other than that pretty much every other aspect of the arc is mediocre.</br>  <br>Hmm, Hamon-Grilled Burgers, that's a new one.</br>  <br><br> Trying to justify this <br><br>No seriously, if you aren't Japanese and your kid isn't even half it's going to be fucking ridiculousness and he;s going to be bullied into the ground because his dad was a weeb faggot. The fact your doing it because of anime is even more tasteless.</br></br></br></br>  Hollywood JoJo movie with perfect casting, effects and budget, except they only ever do DIO's World. Yay or nay?  <br>Holly would be a stillborn due to the Zeppelli curse and the Joestar curse amplifying each other</br>  <br><br>Except it not only has the best jojo by a wide margin, but a great supporting cast, fun villains, the most iconic poses, one of the saddest deaths and no filler enemies that take up entire fucking chapters. It's an amazing part no matter which way you slice it. I'm dreading when you faggots turn against DiU the moment it's animated.</br></br>  <br>sure why not, more money means more movies</br>  <br> no filler enemies that take up entire fucking chapters <br>tarkus and rutherford or whatshisname</br></br>  <br><br><br>7&gt;5&gt;6&gt;2&gt;1&gt;4&gt;3</br></br></br>  <br><br>So at least we've established that you don't even know what part we're talking about.</br></br>  <br> fem-Joseph fucking Caeser <br><br> too lewd </br></br></br>  <br>holy shit, I'm retarded, I'm sorry</br>  <br> spaghettinigger <br>my sides</br></br>  <br>I don't think we'll turn against DiU, primarily because if we did, our best JoJo would have to either be a boring messiah slut, a useless prison slut, an asshole cripple slut and a pure wholesome waifufag slut.
