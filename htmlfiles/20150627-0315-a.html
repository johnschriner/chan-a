[ Marika  Best  I kind of liked the amnesia arc, it should have lasted longer.    Marika feeling guilty for   teasing amnesiac Raku  made me almost die from all the uuuuuuuuuuu~.       What will Y-san do after Marika is killed by Komi?  fun fact: marica is fag in spanish   Kill himself.  Marika is straight.      Marika probably will not win    At least I have this visual novel for Vita.      He isn't saying marika is a fag or something.  Just the fact that "Marika" have the same sound in spanish with c "Marica"  Marica=Fag         Three best girls in one image.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127197397  Call it determination I am amazed that her will is so strong that she wouldn't get tired at all      probably  Of course she won't. Doesn't matter, though.      probably  It's obvious she won't win. The only thing we are doing now is waiting three years more until Komi decides it's time to finish with Chitoge ending.     /a/ when Amnesia arc happens  Oh no not this cliche shit, Komi you hack   /a/ when Amnesia arc ends  Damnit normal Raku is back, why couldn't this arc be longer         SLUT   Best Girl Coming through.   Fuck you.   You guys know that character worship imagedumps aren't allowed on /a/, right?  I don't care who will win Raku bowl.  I just want Shuu and Ruri.     Marika is a goddess worthy of worship. But you are right.   Tsugumi best girl  Marika is a typical girl for yarisute.  You know, destroy her butt with your dick and throw her away.     Why would you do that?  Marika is top tier wife material.     No, it's legit just her being batshit crazy.       end up with her   her condition worsens   tragedy ensues   Why do we never see her do anything about her condition?        She went to the hospital just two or three chapters ago. She was there for a while and missed the shrine visit as a result.   SLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT   Be honest anon. You would fug her.     what episode is that?    Duh    Marika    She sure is lovely character but will never win. I can just sure.     girl is literally doing everything for you   she truly loves you   her condition might get worse  That's why I hate harem MC's. If it were me I would have taken her to marriage already and fugged her so we could at least have kids.  inb4 she dies in the labor         Nobody cares Juan.   Manga spoilers?   It takes Juan, to know Juan.    Best girl tbh    Yui is being forced into an arranged marriage.    Pls be fake.    She obviously won't have to go through with it, but it is the plot of chapter 176.    Doesn't matter, will make her my no.1 crazy waifu   So why do you like her over other girls? No reason?    plot   Nisekoi      She has the best body.    Well she is just the best girl. Other girls are not even comparable. Tsundere Gorilla. Onodecuck. Tsuguwho. Haru is cute and is a better tsundere than gorilla but w/e.   Best girl with best chapters.  God bless Marika and God bless Y-san.      Marika is ded   No she's alive.    Awh Yeah nigga.

Today and on the first of the month, I'll do my best!   It's not really a place to ask that.     Is he right?   All the manga are zipped in that worthless unreadable format I figured someone has a nice way of quickly converting them to a comic book reader readable format   なるべく諦めない！ なせば大抵なんとかなる！   Try your best to not give up! You're likely to succeed if you try!          I'm a drawfag, and recently came across this on pixiv, it looks interesting, but i cant translate it.  If anyone wants to translate this as practice, i'd appreciate it, but if not that's okay too.    He should have used anki, but his ideas are right.    It just gives tips on how to motivate yourself.  It says that you should take amphetamines.      なんでそんなこと言うの;-;     7z   worthless   unreadable  They can be extracted on any operating system/distro and both android/iphone. A direct link, so you don't get lost: <br/>       I can extract them just fine, but there isn't a single comic book reader app that can read them so they need to be converted to zip or cbr. Was hoping for something that went directly from 7z to a readable format      What "comic book reader" are you using that isn't capable of reading jpg/png?   but there isn't a single comic book reader app that can read them  See above.        It just gives tips on how to motivate yourself.  Thats kind of why I wanted to know what It says. I figured if it were translated, it might be helpful to me or other drawfags in the future.     As a drawfag you must be used to the concept of a commission, right?    Why would I want huge uncompressed folders of images on my computer and ipad when I could keep everything small and neat in zip or cbr?    "B had A do it"?    In draw threads people draw people's waifu's for free, as it is good for practicing and getting better at drawing. Since they are still learning, and arent accomplished professionals, nobody expects to be paid in draw threads.  Theres no need to be rude, I was only suggesting it.      Why would I want huge uncompressed folders of images on my computer  jpgs are already compressed and most of the content in the manga and light novel sections are compressed images. Having them zipped isn't going to reduce the file size to anything worth doing. It might save 1% or 2% total.   Extract the folders, use any program you like and archive them as zip/cbr/whatever you want.     Theres no need to be rude  This isn't a "translate shit for me" thread; it is a thread for learners of the Japanese language. People coming in here and asking stupid questions without putting any effort into finding an answer themselves, is downright arrogant.          https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yxZ<wbr>T_4HvpW8</wbr>  [ ]  She is so fucking good.  I want to make her my bride even though I've never seen her face.       "Ä had it done for them by B"    Shit man I just grind the anki deck a few hours a day I don't actually know japanese    Not him, but while you definitely should be drawing instead of just looking at guides and reading about drawing, that does not apply to languages.  You wouldn't want a beginner translating something in the first place. And once someone is proficient enough in the language to actually translate, the quality of the translation depends far more the writing skill in the target language of the translator than on how much practice he has had with translating.  Not that practice isn't important when it comes to translating, but you still can't compare that to drawing.        There are programs and applications which can open a 7z archive for the purposes of reading/viewing the images. Do a google search man or look through the links in the website linked in the OP.    or maybe more like "A allowed B to do it"  who knows, it is a mystery without further context      Honeyview handles them just fine, and I think there are others that do as well.     This was just posted last thread. Might have been two threads ago. させてもらう is to receive the favor of being allowed to do, and the simplest interpretation is that A received the favor of being allowed to do from B; i.e., A had B allow him to do it. It's not "had it done for them" (that would be してもらう) and it's not "allowed B to do it" (that would be させた or させてあげた).      This isn't a "translate shit for me" thread  I wasn't demanding anyone translate it, I was suggesting it, thinking it would be decent practice for the people in these threads. I didnt say anyone had to do it.  It's a shame this place is so rude. I didn't expect this thread to be full of bitter elitists.    Thats fine, I appreciate your insight. Thanks. I guess i'll give up on it, and these threads.          This please review what the に particle does in the causitive form.    Seems like you're right, it isn't too much of a savings for the JPG archives, but there is some.  I found a flow that works for me that isn't too time consuming  Extract to folders then drag the folder the the AU after using the settings described here http://www.b4print.com/index.php?to<wbr>pic=4742.0</wbr>         So  isn't correct either, is that right? There's some kind of nuance I can't put my finger on.      I didn't expect this thread to be full of bitter elitists.  Translation requests have been universally frowned upon for as long as these threads have existed. Framing it as a "chance to practice" or whatever is silly, both because there's no shortage of material needing translation and because those who need the practice should be reading, not translating.     "A was allowed to do it by B", or something, I've just got it backwards at .   It does seem like it has a nuance like A is of a much lower status than B.      聴けなさい！！！！！！ ったく      I guess i'll give up on it, and these threads.  These threads aren't "translate shit for people", you obnoxious fuck.     I found a flow that works for me that isn't too time consuming  Good to hear man.         in the causitive form the subject receives 受身 and the agent of the action is proceeded by the particle に. its essential grammer.     To think these greedy people are the ones who are going to be translating manga/anime in the future. theres a reason why they used to call them fan-translations, its because people enjoyed doing it, not because they wanted to extort money from people in a desperate market    No, that isn't correct either. The nuance is that A had B allow him to do it. It's not particularly complicated, it's mostly just a matter of understanding how the causative and もらう work. Here's the thing, に can mark one of three things, technically:  1) the direction of the verb する (to do to/at someone) 2) the person who is being forced/allowed to do something by the causative させる  3) the person from which a favor is received with もらう  So when you see a contextless sentence it's a matter of figuring out which is the most likely and which one is more frequently used. With the way it's phrased, 3 is the most common option. It's possible for it to be 1 (imagine a sentence like 家に帰らせてもらう, indicates a direction without meaning "be allowed to go home by house") and I guess maybe 2, though I can't even think of a contrived enough situation to where 2 makes sense. Would have to be A receiving the favor of some third party making B do it.    It does seem like it has a nuance like A is of a much lower status than B.  Not necessarily. In fact it's often the opposite, because ～させてもらう is often used by really manly men and such to indicate that they're going to do something that might offend the other person.               If you can't do anything just give it a 15 minute rest, shieet nigga.     I've seen it used with a tone of "I'll have you do...". Either way, it's meant to sound really condescending.    A received a call from B and C.　Because that is how the に particle works with passive verbs.    I'm not sure if you're just trying to stir up shit or what, but I don't think anyone here has a problem with free translations in general. They just have an issue with people asking in a learning thread.    lol no     Was also in a recent thread. It's some contrived attempt at making a confusing adversative passive sentence.     "A made B call C"?    I'd say "A was given a call by C because of B" but I might be very wrong. First time I see shit like that.    There isn't a right answer because noone would ever say that.     That's bullshit. Passives and intransitive verbs can only be fully understood within context. Whoever made this is a troll.        I wasn't demanding anyone translate it, I was suggesting it  Here is a suggestion: read the Guide link in the OP google document and learn how to translate it yourself.    Have a look at pic related. Might help with the nuance.        this isn't even the right verb ending to take two にs.    Fuck off, lazy shit. You'll find no sympathy for EOP fags here.    Not him, but if you consider yourself a non-EOP fag because English is your second language, I got news for you ESLちゃん.      First, it's wrong. Second, "there's absolutely no light".    Confirmed for retarded.    Is the Kanji the same as the Hiragana? I can read the kana but the kanjji still looks like jiberish.   Will Google Translate accurately translate simple phrases like "Brown Sugar" for me? I've never used it for nihongo before but I can translate individual words between romance languages with little issue.   You're not even rubbing orange juice on the doorknob.    RETARD :^)   Should I learn radicals before moving to RTK?   http://www.excite.co.jp/world/engli<wbr>sh_japanese/ 赤砂糖 </wbr>    It's at least partially based on machine learning from a large number of texts so occasionally you'll get weird quirks. Something will be translated in an odd way because of context, and google will pick up on this for whatever reason and decide yeah, the translation for 卵 is now ovum. If you want to look individual words up, I'd recommend a dictionary.    <br/>     の can't replace が outside subordinate clauses. Who are you trying to kid here?      なるべく諦めない！  Wherever possible you should give up?     Adjectival clauses* That's your only hint.     They're just responding ironically because they live in 2015, and that's how people talk now I guess.    No because people don't need to write kanji.    Isn't that the same shit? Look here https://www.google.com/search?q=%22<wbr>%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A3%E3%81%9F%E3%81%8<wbr>F%E5%85%89%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AA%E3%81%<wbr>84%22&amp;oq=%22%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A3%E3%8<wbr>1%9F%E3%81%8F%E5%85%89%E3%81%AE%E3%<wbr>81%AA%E3%81%84%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57<wbr>.754j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8 Where do you see まったく光のない as a main clause? </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>     On the first page of a piece of YA fiction written in the style of a graded reader. You can't even read things that are deliberately simple! Amazing!     graded reader   japanese       people don't need to be able to write  Okay.     勇者部五箇条   You missed the ない        written in the style of       If you want to write then yeah you should, but if you don't plan to write then it isn't necessary.    A is scary    Every adult needs to be able to write.    A is so cute, desu!    I'll take a wild guess that they can write, in their native language    Confirmed retard.    So you will learn to write all 5k kanji by hand? Most of them seem like you'd never be able to write them without the sharpest of sharp pencils with how many radicals they have.    RETARD     Man, this joke is really great you guys. Haha. I love it. 4chan is an awesome website.     A is scared.     I fucking hate this meme   As for A, it is B.    I'm having a blast.    the pleasure of being cummed inside    You can't learn Japanese    B is A    If you desire to use Japanese in a Japanese environment then you really should learn how to write because when you need to and can't you will regret it. Fine for those looking to do nothing but read books/manga/video games but some people are learning Japanese as a language and not a tool.    As for you, Japanese-learning is not able to be done.    Is there a good radical deck that only teaches the 48 radicals? I could only find ones that had all of them.    There literally no reason to not write out kanji a few times when you are learning them besides pure laziness.  I find that writing a kanji 40 times doesn't really help but writing it with correct stroke order 5-10 times really solidifies the kanji and makes me notice all the details       Is there any easy way to export all of the words that I'm currently learning in Anki so that I can review them separately?   Why does every thread open with "You can do it" only to be filled with anons therefore after tell people they can't do it?  I feel some people spend more times in these threads than actually learning Japanese.      Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.    Radicals exist you tard, and 5000 is Chinese, not Japanese. Any fucking excuse to stay in your comfort zone and remain lazy.   DJT likes to pretend to be gungho until something remotely difficult arises. No different from normies.      That's because most people are on Mount Stupid.    Fuck off you meme spewing faggot.    I never claimed it to be difficult I claimed it to not be for me, writing is pointless if all I want to do is just read Japanese okay. Just needlessly adding to the workload.  If people are going for the full package then they should.      You're not even rubbing orange juice on the doorknob, bruh.   For anons that live or have lived in Japan, do you write out your names in english or katakana?   Okay, i'll respond to this meme/bait.  I am okay with that, as long as I can read I am content. That is all. If you can not comprehend this, then seems you should be visiting the Daily English Thread as well.      Depends on the application. If it's something with legal consequences, like a bank account, it generally has to match your ID (which would be passport or gaijin card). But for shit like putting a name down to reserve a karaoke box, I put what the clerk will be most easily able to read.    So you're the tea-sipping faggot.   Just you being alive is enough to make me regret coming to this thread.  Go scratch a doorknob, wannabe.        English because I don't know how to spell Jack in Katakana.    Is the tea-sipping faggot really one person?        Anon, translating is not the same as drawing.  People can look at a shitty drawing and immediately know that it's shit. The only way that you can tell that a shitty translation is shit is if you don't need the translation. It's less akin to drawing a shitty picture for someone and more like offering to fix someone's faucet when you don't know the first thing about plumbing. You know, for practice. It's wandering into the realm of betrayal of confidence. Furthermore, unlike the plumbing scenario, it's not a very practical way to get better at Japanese, compared to reading, listening, and communicating with natives.  Before you even consider translating, you should be extremely confident in your skills in Japanese. "Foggy Japanese" should be a thing of the past. The only thing that you should need practice with is the creative writing portion, where you take what you know from Japanese and get the message across as accurately as possible in English.            As you should, that "not even scratching the door nob" shit needs to go.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184365  Summerfags trolling.

I have worked with illiterate adults before. It was strange.   Sounds like a good idea at least. Couldn't hurt        Well, RIP /djt/  I wonder how you are feeling right now.    If you study japanese for 5 years, will you have the skill level of a japanese 5 year old?   Yep    Depends if you actually have verbal conversations with real people or just lock yourself in your room and grind anki decks.     Unlike a baby, you already have knowledge of both human communication and how to learn things, anon. As an adult learner, you'll be building off of those.  You'll never have the sheer intuition of someone who was raised in Japan, but in regards to Japanaese comprehension and conversation skills, you should easily have that five year old beat within six months.       You can easily get a reading and writing skill above a 5 year old in a few months.   Only thing that might take you a lot longer is getting a speaking skill on that level.         alright, good. Thats actually pretty motivational.      I don't want to do my reps.   Me neither, but what the fuck is with that pic?    がんばる!   I should have been directing my hate toward summerfags not NYRs...  Jesus Christ this thread...  I mean we have Finn and makifag but even they are less obnoxious than teafahggot and the people that respond...  I think im out until December im to old for this shit. They are going to teach themselves the wrong way and just trolling but not the cool meta kind.  Im out for this summer             summerfags  This delusion, no other anon in the history of 4chan believes in summerfags. It's a made up term you use to place blame on a imaginary entity so you can feel good about yourself.       I'm with you two. The thread the last few days has been terrible. Between the tea fags, the orangepeel or w/e the fuck this door knob shit is about, and the summer fags trolling as hard as they can, there's no point to be here.  I'll be back when the kiddos go back to school.  Deuces.          Looks like usual to me.   Ive taken long unneeded breaks from /a/. Its not worth it.     This is you guys right now, see you next thread.     Is it detrimental to my learning when I am reading a book or manga and can understand the meaning of a kanji but don't know the pronunciation?   If you want to go through RTK, the radicals are included in the book. If you just want to learn radicals, you should do so, because they're helpful, but you don't need to do BOTH.     Honestly, I thought that too. But I think I'm gonna leave, too. I've been a regular here for about 3 weeks now, and I feel like I've had all you people can give me.   Someone recommended the thread on /int/ and I went there yesterday. It's absent of faggots like you. Sure, there was an annoying britfag that thought he was the shit but that's manageable. I'm out, too.   Ghost mode, nigga. Outtie 5k.          I've been a regular here for about 3 weeks now     How would that be detrimental? If you don't know something, look it up. Having a fuzzy idea of what it means isn't a bad thing. The only case in which it would be a bad thing, is if you never bothered to look up words you obviously don't know yet.    This guy is a door knob licker if I ever saw one.    You won't be able to read fluently if you don't. When you read in English you should everything out in your mind don't you after all.    Same here, but if you don't do them now, you'll have to do them later on PLUS the stuff that piles up since then...  Sometimes you just gotta grit your teeth and do it regardless of how you feel. It helps if you do small chunks, I do 30 mins at a time then some exercise or read for 5~10 minutes.      Well you just have to question yourself, what is the actual point of a DJT? The thread can't live alone on questions for help. It needs filler.    You accidently a few verbs in there, bro. But I think I know what you were trying to get at: reading things aloud in your head, aka sub-vocalization. Not everyone does it, though it is pretty common.     sub-vocalization  Yeah that's what. I find that being able to do so in Japanese helps a lot. But if you're able to read through the Japanese without stopping due to not knowing the pronunciation then it's not too bad in the end.      I've been a regular here for about 3 weeks now   I'm out  Thank you.      I would argue the opposite.   Even if you can glean the meaning from the text, I would stop and look up any words you don't -actually- know how to read. Assuming you're actively trying to learn the language, you should be looking for opportunities to improve your vocab. You can do this on a second read through if you don't want to interrupt the flow or something.      I never understood this. Just because the unique ips don't go up doesn't they don't have more time on their hands. There's WAY more Americans here than Euros.  There's definitely such thing as them. They post during school hours also but not all day       I haven't been regularly since January. It's nice seeing how this literally turned into memes and re-answering questions every thread with the occasional basic question.　バイバイ～     I haven't been regularly since January   You're not even scratching at the orange.     DON'T GIVE UP! DON'T GIVE IN! KEEP READING! BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!  Learning Japanese is a very long journey and you need to fuel your mind with the right reasons and the right fuel to sustain that journey! Everyone has a lot of energy at the start and they're very focused on their reasons for learning Japanese, but after you've been going for months then the wear and tear of the grind starts to hit you, you get caught away in the daily challenges, the ups and downs, and you focus on the speed bumps of your daily studies and you lose sight of your reasons! You have to stay focused on the reasons for why you're learning Japanese!  There was once a kid who couldn't speak even though everyone else in his class was speaking. When he was 7 then everyone was reading and talking, but he couldn't read. The teacher brought his parents in and told them that he had to go because he was slowing down the rest of the class. They didn't know what to do with him, so they put him to work and he got fired from every single job that he tried. All that he knows up until 21 years old is failure. He's never tasted success. Then one day he found his reason, he found out what he wanted, and he gave it everything he had! Day in and day out! He tried something over 1,000 times before he was finally successful!  Most people never try something more than 10 times before they throw in the towel, but he just kept trying because this was something that he cared about! As he kept pushing forward then it was all of these failures that kept bringing him closer to success! AND THEN FINALLY THE LIGHT BULB LIT! It was Thomas Edison!  He had been a failure his entire life, but every time that he hit rock bottom then he just got back up and took another step forward! We all fall down in the journey of learning Japanese, but it's our perseverance that determines if we will be successful!  REMEMBER WHAT YOU WANT IN JAPANESE AND GO AFTER IT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!             You can do it!    Is this できるちゃん？     Thomas Edison   So as long as you steal someone else's work, you'll become famous and go down in history for things you never did/accomplished?

Learning Japanese for 4 years, still can't read kanji, /a/ lied to me.     ji e ku duh       realize that after a full year of classes, even the most basic of native material is still beyond you   instead of deciding to push on and leave that bullshit program in the dust, attempt to seek more unnaturally dumbed down Japanese   Careful there! If you demonstrate anything resembling ambition, you might actually accomplish something!  I swear, this modern emphasis on classroom learning kills people's thirst to learn and improve, and makes them utterly timid around any kind of challenge, sometimes including those presented in a controlled environment.

There was a guy translating but he got v&amp; <br/>     new Ryu street fighter game  odd for nintendo  the pleasure of mario world 3 inside?  hmm  Reggie Bush top shareholder   intriguing tbh         No.    yeah i'm finding the only way I remember a kanji now is to spaced-rep write the kanji    I think that the emphasis on writing solidifies things a bit more because you're brain not only has to remember stories but must manipulate the central nervous system to write it out correctly as you recall the story.    I don't know what you're reading, but I'm parsing it like "[b]all[/b] of the white people, due to the jinn's curse were made into ghost-like figures"     white people     is it written 白の人 or 城の人 in the source    しろのひと It's a castle, though. I just wanted to mess with it.  I'm going to take the interjection of minna as one of those cases where they just throw in a word without a case marker and it means something.        with it.  with you*     want to start writing kanji since its the new trend on /djt/ and secretly everybody wants to learn it   dont want to actually grab a piece of paper and practice.   Can I just use paint or something?      it means like "all of them", or making it more than one person who was affected, without it it sounds singular:   城の人はジンの呪いによって  because of the jin's curse, the person from the castle was...  城の人はみんな、ジンの呪いによって  because of the jin's curse, ALL of the people from the castle were...         Ah. I was confused, then, solely because of the spacing this game uses.   Are there any good niconico streams?  I am tired of listening to prank calls in English    Going on hiatus from /djt/, this place is cancer. Trolling is one thing, misinformation is too far.

You can't just call him faggot anon. He can't even speak English. You have to bully him in Japanese. He is a loser who fails at doing his part-time job and will never amount to anything.    My Japanese input isn't working for that part for whatever fucking reason  Trust me calling him English names isn't my first choice      Sounds like me, except I'm a NEET.    first half of the thread filled with dumb drama  Meh, still better than /int/ at least.     I got it working now :^)    Anyone got that video of that Japanese kid who goes around picking fights with people?  だっ  how is this pronounced?     だっ    "Write" it on your desk or hand or even the air with a finger if you're that lazy.

D-Did anybody catch that ending?  I think I have been kicked from both of them      I just noticed the OP is changed This new one is shit, why can't you just put the links in the post itself instead of using that dumb slow google docs thing, it's already bad enough having to use it for the guide and cornucopia     You weren't kicked, the episode just was over. They last 30 minutes normally.    D-did you catch the ending though?  She was pronouncing when Isaid "how do you say masturbate in Japan"      Yes I did anon. Your Japanese is very cute.    :)    the most paid athlete is the world cant read or write boom    I feel like im actually learning Japanese by hanging out on niconico I wish rikai worked on it but I still listen and am interested more naturally    I don't know which country you come from but in Australia athletes often take university education in order to sustain their livelihoods aside from sports.    Anon was trying to emulate djt.みんな, which was a lot faster than going directly through a google docs page, especially on mobile devices. It didn't really work out but anyone else can host the links as you have described and post them in the OP for the next thread.   Make the next thread like this and you're halfway there to having it used in the next thread, then the next thread, etc. People might complain about the links changing but they probably wont do anything about it. It is kind of easy to highjack the OP links and alter them, before people notice it is the new standard.

Theres a video of him trying to read harry potter and he actually sounds as if he has turrets      turrets  Apparently, you don't know English.     The first Genki textbook has reading sections in the textbook and workbooks like pic related. If they have worked through the first volume they should have been taught a few hundred kanji, from memory. Genki also starts to replace words in hiragana with kanji in the 3rd chapter. What he says they did does not match up at all with the source teaching material.    Do you know how outliers are treated in statistics?          genki     rename that to "koohii logic"    RTK fags in a nutshell.    When the picture was made 2 years ago the default method for DJT was Kanji Damage for new people. I don't know if anyone remembers that now.   so, starting today, my japanese friend started addressing me with -kun, instead of -san  i don't know how i should feel    <br/>   Nice.  Depends.

Then you'll get all the bitches.     Japanese names    Japanese people would not like me. Im terrible at being a gaijin because I spent my life watching chinese cartoons, and Im terrible at being a weeb cause I have not seen or read much anime and manga to begin with. The only thing I have going for me is drawing, im still not skilled enough to post in the drawfag threads, and good luck with that while trying to keep up anime and manga, and school at the same time. Fuck it all!      I spent my life watching chinese cartoons   I have not seen or read much anime  don't tell me you mean chinese cartoons literally      池田君は三日でその本を読んでしまった。   They say that it means 池田 finished reading the book in three days, but can't you also interpret しまう in a way like "池田 ended up reading the book for three days (without intending to at first)"? Or do you have to word it in a certain way to have that other meaning?     てしまう doesn't have to specify regret or lack of intention. It is primarily for the completion of an action which happens to often naturally involve regretful situations.   今回カプコンがコナミに負けたのは俺のせいではない   Ah, so the completion is the base meaning, and whether it's regretful/unintended can be inferred from the action or by additional words. Thanks, anon.    My anonymous life.  1st-5th grade  Watch a bunch of simpsons, family guy, american dad, south park, athf, robot chicken, and general cartoons on nickelodeon and cartoon network . No anime though.  6th-8th grade  Watch a bunch of newgrounds, avgn, and nostalgia critic. Get into anime by the end of 8th grade.  9th-12th grade  Anime, anime, anime, anime, drawing the /ic/ way. begin studying japanese. holy fuck, I went my whole life not watching any movies or tv shows. panic.          install VNR for text hooking, because TA suddenly stopped working properly   RANDOM CURSOR CHANGE   IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ANYTHING EASILY THROUGH 50 THOUSAND SUBMENUS   SO KAWAII BULLSHIT EVER  This is it. This is the worst program I've ever used. I thought it was a little weird that it was about 500 times the size of TA, but I didn't pay it any mind.  If anyone can use this absolute clusterfuck of a program, you have fucking brain problems.         You're just an impatient person. If VNR didn't have as many options people would be complaining now and then too.  With that said it also bothered me and I quit after 10 minutes. I told myself I'd try to configure it properly someday but at this point I think I'd rather get near-fluent first.      The problem isn't all the options. It's that all of them are totally fucking nonsensical and pointless. TA doesn't have a problem accepting copied text from another program and running it through Mecab for me. Everything is contained in a couple of menus that don't disappear just because I'm not hovering over them.  It's totally anti-user.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sZ8<wbr>2xbK0lJM</wbr>  [ ]  Let's get motivated with Steve-sensei!     Anyone up to work on fixing the typos in the grammar guide of the website or are we going to wait for corくん to slowly fix it up while everyone uses it in the meantime?  I've downloaded the docx and had a look. Google ruins the style formatting which makes it easy to mass alter sections and it keeps freezing up when trying to do any online edits. Would anyone be interested in adding corrections as comments in a plain google spreadsheet? I've sent an email to corくん with a link to the document so he/she/they can see corrections as they are posted. Having that DoJG reference fixed up and realized would be a useful page/document/pdf for every Japanese language learner. Haven't found any errors in the first 30 pages. I can probably work through a couple of concepts a day. There are about 600 total with one person looking through one every day or two a few people could work through it in a couple of months without much effort. If corくん doesn't respond at all we can/someone can/I can add the corrections to the local copy and have that uploaded on the djt website offline grammar link with whatever file sharing site. Document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/1DgESX_cOQlCj9Ed8nu9DlLDxF48szD<wbr>_abWjaMJxlia0/edit?usp=sharing   Still no email response from corくん. Has anyone else been able to get through to the person recently?   </wbr></wbr>      If languages were operating systems, English would be Windows and Japanese would be ios   Either "B let A do it" or "B made/let [C] do it for A".    Japanese is somekind of CLI OS.   Let's start again Anki.   English is extremely derivative while Japanese is very isolated. Not really seeing how the comparison works.    I didn't at first either, but now I get it, though not like a /g/anster. Windows is used a lot more and more mainstream than ios, but ios is still expensive and special and can be seen as elite. This comparison is awful, why are we glorifying it?    Apple are giving their operating system away for free these days. If anything Windows is the most expensive OS on the market these days.  why are we glorifying it?  I'm not trying to.     談 It's like asian people knew internet would be nothing but arguments.

This shit is just sad, fuck, either grow up or fuck off to some video game boards.  Hopefully I haven't been the only one reporting every single one of your pitiful trolling attempt.      I'm starting today because I'm tired of missing out on the rich lore in my hentai games.   What made the rest of you start?      Mainly visual novels, awesome games and Skyrim mods      I'm starting today  Don't worry bud, just put it off till tomorrow. Nobody will know.     Namasensei made me start.  I watched his videos for fun because they were entertaining, and when there were no videos left I realized I had actually learned something and that Japanese was kinda cool, so I just continued.      Angel Beats.    Wish I knew about namasensei when he was making his videos. Would have sent 50 dick pics and told him to sit on it fifty fucking times. Seems like the sort of guy who would appreciate that sort of thing. There aren't enough people left on youtube related to language learning who make a complete mess of their lives for the sake of the enjoyment of onlookers. A noble cause to die for.     I'll know.     why do tomorrow what you can do today?     Sengoku Rance     Change the date to the day before the next time you wake up and you're already ahead.    Time doesn't work like that.    Time is relative.    you can't just live in your own time bubble and think everything is okay.    My nigger.    Where do you think you are?     Are there any H-doujins that use furigana? I am on my way to being able to read my doujins raw but the kanji is stopping me.    And what do you know, everything wasn't okay and Rikka was autistic.    That is what almost every person does. Their sense of time revolves around a work schedule, a school schedule; a social cycle; a pay cycle; etc.     Are there any H-doujins that use furigana?  Erotic content is sold to adults, anon, not children.        You think material aimed at 18+ would have furigana, a concept designed for 5 year old children? Are you fucking stupid?  The best you can get are a few loli characters that talk in kana to sound childish.      I like the concept.   My First Porno, by Fisher Price      かっこいいだ！     い adjectives don't take だ     Thank you, i'm still a noob you know..     Why don't adult restricted works use furigana  Best question I've seen posted in months.    もちるん what word is this? Or is it 2 words, Jisho gives me nothing. I feel like I have heard this in anime before and it means "of course" but I am not sure.    It's "sticky rice cake moving at a brisk pace".    물론    read tae kim    That's why they have to hammer mochi down; break their legs to keep them running away.    I don't speak korean.   The symbol for 安 contains 女. Really makes you wonder if not all Japanese think women are cheap sluts.  jesus christ. i just found a 16 year old with g-cups on nico.  she is even posing for the camera and stuff  http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv22<wbr>6094065</wbr>        Use google translate and go from there. You fucked up the word and this is will provide the right one. It is to save your embarrassment, trust me.     You (or somebody) just mistyped もちろん.    I hope that one day, mochi will be allowed to run free in the streets, instead of beaten to death and sold as a new year treat. Elevens are sick.   I don't have vomiting matsudoki saved, but I'd be posting it right now if I did.         Thanks, so my anime intuition was right, I read it as mochiron and don't know why I typed mochirun.      YOKETA!!!!!    Japan understands that 3D are PD.   じゃあさつそく Then at once?    Are you even trying?    Not being able to figure out when words end and start is my biggest flaw sadly. Hence why I am currently working on it.    reminds me of 謝罪しる    「さつそく」ではありません名無しくん。 「さっそく」と言います。  注意を払ってください。       「注意を払って」より「注意をして」の方が自然でしょう    そうですか。 ありがとう、知りませんでした。     そうですか、知りませんでした などを敬語にするのであれば 　”ありがとう”　も敬語で　”ありがとうございます”　にするべきです。<wbr></wbr>      Why, when is one used instead of the other?    Yeah, no.   注意を払う http://eow.alc.co.jp/search?q=%E7%B<wbr>4%B0%E5%BF%83%E3%81%AE%E6%B3%A8%E6%<wbr>84%8F%E3%82%92%E6%89%95%E3%81%86</wbr></wbr>    「注意を払って」is a literal translation.    No, 注意を払う is a set expression in Japanese       it is a literal translation, but you can still use 注意を払う, it's just more "heavy" as in "motherfucker you better pay fucking attention" but what in this case we're looking for is "be careful bud"  also, in japanese, you'll seldom hear someone say 注意を払う          If you haven't noticed, the standard mode of expression for all languages on /a/ is aggressive and over the top.    i thought djt was about learning?    ふざけるな！    あぁん？ やんのかオラー     hubakeruna isn't a word anon.     huzakeruna*     The Japanese didn't come up with those symbols anon, it was ancient Chinese sages.     てめえ。。。　日本語出来ないよ！     u make no sense    You japanese able to.    Good one. DJT is for shitposting faggots.    黙れ、ぶち殺してやがるぜ。 てめえら俺を誰と思ってやがる？！     黙れ、ぶち殺してや(noが)るぜ。 てめえら俺を誰(だhere)と思ってやがる？！     ーやがる    はいはい、 ガキはママの乳でも吸ってろ     怒りのあまりタイプミスをしてしまったのですね わかります。    みんな頑張ってるね 偉い偉い    君、やるねー   Protip: posting like /b/tards in Japanese doesn't make you any less pathetic.   At least they're trying, and other people are correcting them where they're making mistakes. If anything, they're actually learning here, the only pathetic person here is you.     No, shitposting in Japanese is still shitposting.    Are you talking about the people trying to kill each other a couple replies back or the ones posting shit like ケック?    It's just the one shitter who hates that anyone else is confident enough to post in japanese here. Just ignore him and keep posting in japanese to tickle his autism.   Anyone here use honeyview to read? I redownloaded it I cant figure how to make it so the window isnt always ontop of everything   I'm not the first guy I'm only  I'm addressing your post specifically. The idea that any posting is acceptable as long as it's in Japanese is asinine.    PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CLc<wbr>pO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]  Only eight days left until the first episode.  I need a thread to deal with the unbearable excitement until it airs.   What's Carol's goal? Destroying the moon? Calling the Custodians? Getting rid of the power of song and Symphogears?       Also Hibiki's new boots look pretty fucking sweet. I never liked her weird black G boots.   Maybe reclaiming the relics. In the PV sword doll shows up in England to attack Tsubasa, coin doll goes after Chris, and Carol tries to nuke Hibiki personally.    Hibiki seemed more like she accidentally stumbled into something which made Carol try to remove her as witness.    How many times have you guys watched the new pv?    at least 10 times. That tempo buildup.    I never counted in the first place. I think I've watched it at least twice every hour.     I lost count Nonstop since yesterday     Watched? No idea, but I listened to it a million times.    Too many times. I've also probably listened to it 3x more often than I've seen it. Symphogear is the only show that manages to get me hyped up like this.   Reminder that Maria is not useless. She is directly responsible for:  Revealing FIS to the world and putting gang on the quest to save the world. Exposing the Americans as dirty backstabbing jerks. Taking care of Shirabe and Kirika. Taking the burden of playing Fine so they could get help. Raising the Frontier. Curing Hibiki's space cancer. Giving Hibiki a new Gungnir. Satisfying the fantasies of 7 billion people by stripping both herself and Hibiki nude on life TV Saving the world by activating Arghaitlahm.             I want to  touch her hair and watch her get all flustered.     More than 40.   ONLY 1 WEEK    She's the most beautiful of them, I'd marry her.     1v1 me bitchnigga    That's not Hibiki, Shirabe, Miku or Chris   Autism General   I just realized how tight the spats in that picture are    Sorry, this is not the Naruto thread<br/>     Hibiki  A cute tomboy  Shirabe  A cute loli  Miku  A cute tomboyish wife of a cute tomboy  Chris  The cutest of all  They're all cute, but none of them is beautiful like Maria.             They're all more cute than beautiful though. Maria is the prettiest geah.   OFFICIAL GEAH POWER RANKINGS 1. Tsubasa 2. Bikki 3. Chris 4. Maria 5. Miku 6. Shirabe 7. Kirika 901.

Maria's too old to be wearing these cute girlish clothes.    alot   This Touhou big bad is really cute.   She's young in her heart so it's okay.      Man this fight is gonna look great.     Let's hope it's not like S2 where first half was amazing and then everything started falling apart.  is there a translation for the PV?   http://symphogear.blogspot.de/2015/<wbr>06/new-promotional-video-released.h<wbr>tml Song translation. </wbr></wbr>   I was hype so I drew a derpy Hibiki. Any simple requests so I can waste more time?    I hope we get to see her this smug in the show at some point. There's not enough Smugbiki.    DMJii kissu     find this thread   watch the PV   start downloading the first two seasons  How much time do I have to binge watch them and catch up for the first episode of GX?       T-too complex for me. I already suck at facial expressions.     You've got time. First airing is on July 3rd, I think it was, but subs will probably take a while.    8 days anon. Plenty of time to watch 26 episodes. Keep in mind though that it takes about 4 episodes for the first season to get interesting.      What convinced you? The punching, the explosions, the singing or the concert?    S1 is like Nanoha's, it should pick up after 6 episodes or so. On a rewatch all of it is enjoyable though.    Maria genuflecting. We'd probably get a lot of use out of it this season.     Grand so, plenty of time.   I truly appreciate the concept of punching stuff while singing        L F P  Any ideas?    Welcome to the hype train. Why did it take you so long to discover Symphogear?    Just kinda ignored it when it aired first, I've started to like mahou shoujo a bit more recently though. I always like stuff that's a bit different so I can't wait for S1 to finish downloading, honestly.    You have plenty of time, please enjoy yourself. Just a heads up, it's yuri as all hell on top of the fighting and singing.     Lesbian Fisting Punch    This just gets better and better.      What time of day is it airing? The site lists 27:10 on July 3rd which doesn't make any sense.    24+3.16 h?    27:10 simply means 3 hours and 10 minutes after 24:00, so it's 3:10 July 4th.     he doesn't use a 30 hour clock     So thats ~4:10 PM eastern on thursday right?    Never mind I'm retarded. Its on the friday.     more than half of those weren't even planed  I know it's the joke, but it's still pretty sad when it's all written down like that.     I don't care about the plot, I just want to know if there'll be more training regimes from old kungfu movies while singing hot blooded Cantonese songs.    100% guarantee    I miss that slutty edgy badass geah cape Seriously she had the best design. If only it was similar and black on Hibiki too after she stole it     The prehensile nature of that cape was fantastic.    We could have lost the scarf     slutty   cape  What? Also she only had it because she was afraid of everything and needed something to protect herself with, so Gungnir gave her a cape.  Gungnir is pretty bro.  user seems to hate heels   give her proper boots in the next version   she also seems to prefer to punch things   give her piston and revolver gauntlets    this other user wants to hide from everything   give her a giant awesome cape that can cut and grab things and turn into a tornado                Bikibutt.    Blue is the only doll for me.    Reminder that the blue doll is Miku's reanimated corpse.    I like how Aoi still remembers the lyrics to Eiyuu Eiyuu Koji. https://d.maxfile.ro/uyptxnwngi.mp3<wbr></wbr>     Did someone say HOT BLOODED CANTO SONGS?  https://<span>youtu.be/AiluIsFXxI4  [ ]       Miku's  Uhhh     Care to actually add some substance to your posts?     P   That's a thorn.      Can Miku handle Hibiki's determination to fist?    Sure. You made a fucking mistake and Miku isn't dead you stupid fuck.    What? I know she isn't dead  yet . I think you're the one who has made some kind of mistake.     Every night.    Then why would you even post a picture of a different character?    Oh, you thought I thought Serena was Miku. Yeah, no. Sorry. It was just a way of conveying my thoughts of the idea.      Carol a cute. Too bad about all that edge.  So are we going to get previews of the battle songs or not?   Witch Chino did nothing wrong.    Shooting death lasers at Hibiki seems pretty wrong    Woah    You mean like this? Somehow I think I got it all wrong.  Holy shit this was more difficult than expected. Not only is the pose really hard from any perspective but the side but Maria's gear really doesn't work in anything except a neutral pose without stabbing herself with all the metal parts.       Maria's gear really doesn't work in anything except a neutral pose without stabbing herself with all the metal parts   So she is useless even on design?      Some anon a thread or two back mentioned it meant "that which is forbidden."    The one with her stabbing herself could be funnier.    Not that anon, but it looks great to me.    I actually meant the orz pose. I just googled genuflect and I see where you got the idea. Sorry for not explaining it better. You did a nice job with that pose though!   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tQC<wbr>EVb4r5zE</wbr>  [ ] Reposting from /m/     These both look pretty great, but Bikkie's expression is a bit weird  and her bikkies are too small      what the fuck am i watching?    Looks more like Ryuko   On three days (5-6-7 July), they're going to marathon both S1, G, as well as 2013 Live on Nico. http://www.symphogear-gx.com/specia<wbr>l/special03_niconico.php</wbr>    But I'm in the middle of doing that already.    noice.    is it bad i simply want a scene of genjuro just whooping the every living shit out of either the dolls or magical girl edge-chan?     重大発表もございますのでお見逃しなく！！   Seems they will also have major announcement      The best I can imagine is a new live show, and I would be very please with that.    Can I expect a game or movie?    If they announced a game I'd shit myself.  If Platinum was making it I'd shit myself harder.     I like some of the soundtrack better than some of the songs.  https://d.maxfile.ro/wogufllati.fla<wbr>c https://d.maxfile.ro/fmfmtkejmo.fla<wbr>c</wbr> </wbr>    Hold on to your butts   Platinum don't like moe games, go ask others like Gust or even Koei.    Only if it's their A-team and not their Korra team.   That logo remains the coolest fucking shit.        7:50-8:20    My sides are going to the moon      Same. This is the best one in my opinion. http://picosong.com/YpAn/     It's so fucking good.    More like 80 days because subs where.     S1 is like Nanoha's, it should pick up after 6 episodes or so.  Are you kidding, Sympho is the first time in a while I watched the first 5 episodes of a show glued to my seat.     Same, I loved it from the start. I don't understand why people hate on the first few episodes.     implying   anon it got good when hibiki did dat training montage with genjuro so towards the end of episode 4.      I don't understand why people hate on the first few episodes.  It's because you're not allowed to like anything with a dark tone.     mostly because tsubasa's edge early on was pretty damn thick, i mean, its understandable, but god damn.   I want to fuck Kirika.   Shirabe pls.      How would people react if Hibiki died halfway through and Miku ends up inheriting her Gungnir?      probably mad as hell because hibiki is best girl.    Pretty peeved Unless its some like ghost hibiki lives in Gungnir and they share control of her body when they fight thing mite be cool     KAKU OE KOE TA SAKI NI     HAJIMARU UTA HAJIMARU KODOU     This is so unattractive, why is her underwear shaped like a heart? And her limbs are bent in ways that looked like they'll crack off. Give me  any day.    How would people react if Miku died halfway through and Hibiki'song became the song that destroys the world?     why is her underwear shaped like a heart?  Because it's following the contours of her ass and because it's sexy  And her limbs are bent in ways that looked like they'll crack off  Except that's wrong.       I'd wonder why it took them so long.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/genjuro.php Genjuro: "Since the opponents are not the Noise, it should be my turn to fight them!"  The staff knew it.   </wbr>   I'd question why it didn't happen last time she thought Miku was dead.    but her ass looks weird like her cheeks are just barely clinching together since there's so much space inbetween them    Why the fuck are they fighting each other again  I can't wait for the CDs.      Hibiki becomes gungnir-chan?     Fighting each other again   Did you even watch the PV?      That OST That Tsubasa     this is everything i wanted.   I want to get fucked by Tsubasa-senpai's sword.   I want to penetrate Bikki's Rainbow Flower.    Aww yes, there better be an entire episode dedicated to him kungfu fighting the shit out of enemies.    Looks like a senketsu color palette     Google translate   If the other party is not a noise, I will protrude ~Tsu!      I want Genjuro to move fast enough to look like he's flash-stepping while dodging Carol's danmaku shit.   And then he pulls off a SICK ASS HYPER BOMB     http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/shirabe.php  Other than Kiri-chan, I don't want anyone to see my embarrassing parts.  Welp.  </wbr>   What if Genjurou loses badly and gets hurt to show how serious things are?    Yes. In the first half of the PV there are clips of kirika/shirabe fighting and tsubasa/chris.    ...  That's just reused footage from G. Are you stupid or just acting?      GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYY<wbr>YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! they arn't even trying to hide it anymore. </wbr>    LEWD    I think you misinterpreted the question. Why are they fighting? I'm wondering why they are using those clips. Is it some kind of foreshadowing? are they going to end up fighting again?    I thought it was obvious it was just a "LAST TIME ON SYMPHOGEAR" kind of thing.    Well it's obviously part that + part something else. It came to mind since it seemed to match the music so well.    I'm sure Symphogear is at the limit of how gay a show can be before it's actually considered yuri and tanks in sales.     Why is show using clips from the climax of it's prequel to hype up the sequel?  Holy fucking shit, nigga.     That's obviously part of it, but if you've read anythign i've said i'm merely wondering if this indicates more internal conflict in the 3rd season.    Just fuck/kiss/hand-hold aggressively already   Shows don't tank in sales when they "become yuri." What extremely few examples we have (KnM off the top of my head) disprove that meme.        Shirabe and Kirika are pouting in the PV because someone is telling them "No, you two can't spend all your time fucking each other."    http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/micha.php  Mika: "People, cats and dogs in this street, I will dissect all of them."  Edgelord.  </wbr>  http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/tomosato.php  Their unison's result exceeds any numerical value!  </wbr>   I've always been of the opinion that it's not that yuri don't sell, it's just that yuri tend to be the only thing it's got going for it and the character dynamics are kind meh beyond the obligatory fanservice, thus not very good and so don't sell.    When you've got knives instead of fingers you probably develop a bit of a complex    Time to channel the power of /tv/ and spam Edward Scissorhands quotes when she starts turning up.   [x] Cool logo [x] New villains [x] Hotblooded fighting [x] LISTEN TO MY SOOOONGs [x] Genjuuro [ ] Yuri  It's so close, and yet, I feel empty.          S2CA Twin Break confirmed.   Oh god, I can't believe I'll have to go through the "subs where" again.     She will fuck Miku's shit up, I guarantee it. And the Zerbiki will tear her apart.  I cannot wait.      http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/garie.php  Roogeer! Garie is gonna do her best~☆  Guess we know this doll's personality now, huh.  </wbr>   Well shit. I was hoping for Shinku-style classiness.    What does Kirika's say though?    Is the yellow doll a slut? She looks like one.    http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/chris.php  I've always wanted this and yet... I still can't help but feel uncomfortable...    Is she talking about sex with the sword?    </wbr>  I've lost count of how many times I've listened to this. I'm not sure if I should be sad that the final song was spoiled, provided it is, but for now the hype is alive and wins.  Do we have a preview of Nana's OP yet?     She's talking about having a place to call home, and genuine friendship.  My sweet Chris. I want to protect her.       spoiler  Don't be silly; senpai doesn't know what sex is.     I'm banking for a Ononoki Yotsugi style of delivering it all in a deadpan voice.     implying Kanade would have been okay with that arrangement     http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/kirika.php  Now that you mention it, it was seriously an Aha-experience!  </wbr>    What does that even mean? And holy fuck her tits are so lewd.      Kiri's kiris are bigger than Tsurugi's tsurugis      Kanade forcing herself on Tsubasa   This pleases my penis.      http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/leiur.php  ...I don't like to be plain...  She's /fa/.  </wbr>    What about Carol? She sounds like she's pissed.    I'll take that as a yes then.   Of all the way to make Symphogear better, I didn't think they would go with adding doll joints.  It's like this whole series was created for me.    http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/phara.php  Fufu... From what I've listenined to, that song's so dull.  </wbr>   I want to fuck her so bad.  New look is nice. I'll miss her skirt, striped stockings and zr though.       What the hell is with that outfit anyway? What kind of high school girl dresses like that?         You will never see Shirabe's embarrassing parts  Also those Ogawa crackfags can leave now.    SOON   Will come out on Sunday.    Aha means Wow! I think she wanted to say it's a whole new experience.    eight days  Neat.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/phara.php  You can't do anything! Symphogeeaaaar!  </wbr>    What are you doing Symphogeaaaaaah!!    Should I expect QUALITY? Later episode of S2 were terrible.     That must either be when she's sitting on her throne or when she's about to use her danmaku shit on Bikki.     Oh, I misunderstand its meaning. this  is correct answer.     She's worst girl.    Noise look like CROWDs.    They are still better than S1. But since Satelight is also making Aquarion S3, I don't think they will have enough staff and time.     She should just go back to Gensoukyo, her moms are probably worried.      Satelight   Except impeccable animation.      You are worst taste    She has a young sister who has a nice body though.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/elfnein.php  My atonement is to deliver this heritage.  </wbr>   What does that mean? And put some goddamn pants on.    probably an asteroid-based superweapon or ancient zeppelin    I guess she fucked up something in the past and now is trying to compensate for it by delivering the box to someone/something. Carol for whatever reason doesn't lile that idea.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/hibiki.php  I... it's a miracle to be able to wear a Symphogear, I'm happy abou it!  </wbr>   No, you're the miracle Hibiki.    What are Miku's runes?     it's a miracle to be able to wear a Symphogear   got her Symphogear from Maria  Maria confirmed for miracle.      Could they make her spats any more lewd?  I mean holy shit. God damn. I want to see the back.      You don't realize how lewd they are until you realize her spats are tight enough to show her puffy vulva, check the OP    http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/ch_miku.png  Actually, letting you go back with an empty stomach would worry me more.  </wbr>    I don't mean to be crude, but I want to bury my face in that crotch.    I was hoping for something lewder.    I want her to bury her c ock  in my face    She's gonna take in some lesbian while Hibiki isn't home again.    Elfnein? And then Carol gets even more pissed off due to her sister(?) complex?    Everything with Chris is great.  Scale pajama christ, when?   I abandon any hope with gear scale already.           That tail   So is she an alien now?       Wonder where it's attached at?    Please no.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/tsubasa.php  Sorry... But that's the way we are.  Tsubasa pls, not anyone can be a sword like you.  </wbr>   She's talking about being flat-chested. Sorry, I mean being "B81" chested.     The fuck is an Aha-experience? Is that just an experience that makes you realize something(makes you go "Aha!")?  Is she talking about how S2 made her realize how much she wanted to fuck Shirabe?       Why are damaged goods always the cutest?      HibiMiku adopt Elf9   TsubaMaria adopt Carol   Genjuro gives Chris a box full of doll parts and tells her to have fun   one gattai later...          Is she talking about how S2 made her realize how much she wanted to fuck Shirabe?  Well, she uses the word 体験 (taiken) which can either mean "own experience" or "physical experience".     That just means you're not trying hard enough!     Bingo Anon here, I got rid of the remaining plausible ones, comments?   Best version so far. Though I'm not sure what the Alice + Marisa thing would actually mean.     Shit, should be a x.     Even then, what does that mean?    That Carol is confirmed the lovechild of Alice and Marisa or something like that I'm guessing. The other bingo was super easy but this one seems impossible.    I just hope that symphogear gets a tad bit more priority, logos already looks ugly as fuck even if it's onmodel so there is not much more to lose there.     See  What's so hard to understand about this?       The other bingo was super easy but this one seems impossible.   Well, people have been complaining about the first versions containing plausible things, so I got rid of them.      It's stupid and literally impossible.  The problem wasn't plausible things, but things that were already confirmed to happen.       I think you should just replace it with one of the old ones.  Training montage for example. Or maybe a good guy betrayal, like what happened with Chris in G.   I think it's got a decent balance. The fun is in the difficulty, and Symphogear always throws surprises at us.   It's not hard to understand; it just doesn't mean anything. Don't we already know that she uses magic and dolls?             Use less tumblr-ish art for the kissing. Or use that official check kiss picture that I can't seem to find right now.     It's not about getting rid of all plausible things either. Well, I guess having an extreme hard mode version on the side is alright too, I wonder who's insane enough to use it though.    You should probably change the picture for someone not gay since         Feel free to come up with your own one or edit mine, I'm out of ideas and too lazy to do any more work on this, so it's free for all now.  Font is Arial Bold.          Found it.     Other than Kiri-chan, I don't want anyone to see my embarrassing parts.   What japanese word for "parts" is used there? Does it really mean parts in the physical sense as in body parts, or does it mean the embarrassaing aspects of her character?       Can you post those 2hou pictures as well, because it looks like you down scaled them with MS paint, so the lines look aliased as fuck.    A more accurate translation would be  I don't want anyone other than Kiri-chan to see me when I'm at my weakest.      I directly copypasted them from a google image search and downscaled them in Gimp. Didn't save them.   Well, of course it is something like that. Nothing to hype here.      I mixed the most recent version with some ideas from an older one I had saved. Still pretty hard, but it got rid of some of the weird vague ones for more plausible ones.  I'm happy to take over where the other Anon left off.      nosubs should be the free space, replace it with karaoke    Seems fair. I'll replace the Genjuuro evil mastermind with something else too.    how about genjuro actually punching out a bitch?    Hibiki berserker clone. I believe in it, even if nobody else does.    i vote for that being over kirika being smart, cause god damn that bitch is dumb.    Isn't that a bit too flowery, at least without context? Just 恥ずかしいところ alone could be anything from embarrassing quirks to body parts to that. Although I'm sure that it's not relating to any actual body parts too.   Soon.    Thanks for taking over.   Zerbikki vs Hibizerker isn't even that implausible.        Just to get rid of that ugly kissing art.       Zerkbikki in the logo has giant talons   she will do roundhouse kicks while slashing with the talons instead of punching  Would be really fucking sweet.       If it's not too much of a hassle, for the nosubs one put that gif with Hibiki and Christ screaming at a computer screen with /a/ threads shoped in.      Bikkibutt  Now that's way too easy.     I think the intention is that it can be read as &gt;implying multiple things. Translating it as 'embarrassing parts' is probably best.    I like this idea.   Give her a chance. I want Kirika on there anyway, since she's such a qt.   I'm using it under the impression that it means bare naked Bikibutt. I'll clarify it on there though.             Can we get an OVA that's just 10 minutes of kissing?        If Maria can be useful then Kirika can be smart.     No, why waste an OVA on that when we could have cute comedy SoL in it instead?   What are the chances we'll see Maria sing her swan song this season? She's the last of the gears to have not sung one yet.   Bikibutt should be the free space  I'm biased towards that though      As long as by cute comedy SoL you mean them going on more training sessions, I'm willing to chuck more money at the BDs.    Either Bikibutt or no subs for free space. Heaven or Hell.     How can someone so plain looking have such a lewd aura?   My ass is clenched My dick is hard My volume is at max  Words can't describe how ready I am for GX       its probably some stupidly OP as fuck thing too, such as a bigass spear that skewers whatever the shit.    Do you remember which font you were using?    Why should it be a spear? It's not like she actually uses gungnir anymore.     my volume is at max  No, anon, please don't do that. Do you want to blast your ears out and not be able to experience the next season of Symphogear?     Real men use their heart to listen.    Anon, he wrote it in one of his posts in this very thread.    Shit, you're right. Sorry, and thanks.   Symphogear scales when?   Never, aside from Bunny Chris in all colors of the rainbow of course.   Any translations for the rest of the characters quotes?   I imagine this is a badly translated "The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts"     You sure it's not about GATTAI?    Real mean also eat, drink, watch movies and sleep.     Sorry... But that's the way we are.  Gay       誰かを信じる勇気が無かったばかりに…   What does Maria's say?   "Simply because I didn't have the courage to believe in someone..."?       No, it's meant to be a callback to a similar dialogue from before. The TL is fine for the most part, though personally go for 'the result of the union etc'.    For some reason I always see a fluffy white beard in the thumbnail    I hope there will be a moment when both parties scream "SYMPHOGEAAHHHH" at each other.     But Chris being cute and killing everyone is the best Free Space.       Put full Symphogattai on the bingo, it's the next logical step after everything that has happend so far.       Help me. I have it on repeat in background. OST and chara songs when?    I was thinking exactly the same thing. Any suggestions for an image? There's no Symphogear gattai fanart as far as I've looked.     Like the previous seasons. Character songs come out during the show, and OST/rest of the songs as BD extras.   In 13 weeks, we'll be raving for the final episode.   I can't even handle the wait for the first episode. What am I supposed to do until then?     Shoop something together, it's only like 180x180 pixels, it doesn't have to look great.  I would do it, but I'm at work.      REMOVE NOISE remove noise    Noise are already removed.    Pardon?     Haven't you watched the second season?     Yes, I was making a terrible dad joke. I'm so sorry.      As much as I want both of these things, I don't think they're going to break tradition at this point.  has it right. We'll get our silly faces and we'll like them, damn it.   This took longer to make than I thought it would.        Fuck that. I'll just put a picture of Voltron in there.    It was worth it though. Saved.    I wanted an onsen episode really badly though. And GX doesn't sound like it will have time for breather episodes.    The fact you are full of swords does not make you a sword Shirou.  It means you're a sheath.   Swords do not contain more swords.    Sheathes can contain swords.   Logic crushes you again Sheath boy.           GX needs some Tsubasa being cute.        Tsubasa's sword entering Shirou's sheath.   I guess we know what the drawfag needs to draw.      Good idea. It's too oblong though, and I've already gone with Voltron.    What would you want more, a solid story or a cliffhanger every episode?    Fine raised her well      I cringe at every western version of this but love all the japanese ones  japanese magic      Thoughts? I think it has a good balance of difficult and easy ones.     Solid story. Cliffhangers were fun episode to episode but overall G's story suffered because of it     Should be enough.     I just got it.  That was really terrible.       Cliffhangers every episode. The overarching story hasn't been good previously, so honestly I don't mind if it stays that way. The episode-to-episode "how can we top last week's madness" trainwreck is what I'm here for, and good/plentiful cliffhangers are an important part of that.    Actually I can see one or two issues. But fuck it, I'll fix them tomorrow.      Original Anon here, I think you should switch Training Montage for Character Development. And if you insist in keeping the No Subs-Free Space instead of the Chris Being Cute-Free Space, do what that anon said  Apart from that it's great.       I wasn't sure what you meant with that one. Nisio style character development?  Yeah, I'll swap the no subs image.     Do you think we'll get more crying brown people? They are in London after all.     It's a multi-level joke. 1. One of the characters has some actual development, that's plausible and has already happend. 2. One of the characters changes their hairstyle permanently. Nisio joke. 3. Kohinata Miku with Hatsune Miku's hair, name joke. But I can see that it's not easy to understand since it's not obvious that it's Miku's face.          Me again, if the character development image had Mikugear's visor it would be pretty clear, and add another layer of meaning.     Huh? What a weird request. There's no way a japanese sword could fit into a sheath for a longsword.    Oh, I couldn't even tell that her face was edited. Sasuga.  But yeah, that might be a bit too complex.  I think Nisio character development is less likely than Miku killing Hibiki. And regular old character development is guaranteed to happen.  The training montage is possible/likely, but it's not guaranteed. We need a few easy ones on there I think.          Dude, spoiler that, nsfw board!     10/10 Made my day.     Okay, fair enough.         Is this the Bikibutt or are they Bikki's bikkies?     I want to Biki all over Biki's Bikis       Anon please.   Too big, Bikki doesn't have Zenbus.       Thanks anon  Bikki may not have Zenbus but her bikkies are actually decently large. Also why would her relic necklace be around her butt?      she does now <br/>     Because thats her charm point.  Stick in between or just above her little rocket boosters.     For merchandise, they should make a 1:1 scale replica of Biki's butt and hips out of silicone, with the spats.  Just saying.       So did they take the bird idea from those fanart pictures?   swimsuit  FUCK. YES.         hips  Miku needs to put an IPS baby in there pronto     The chicken already was a thing in the manga, before all the Symphobird fanarts.    The birds originally came from the official manga, anon.     from fanart  It says in the first manga that Kanade and Hibike' hair was designed after a hen and chick      Oh yeah, I forgot about that.      That swimsuit looks like bodypaint.     I'm not a fan of those casual clothes to be honest.   I know Hibiki and Miku probably won't kiss, but I'm wondering if in this season Bikki will realize about her own feelings. I'd love to see her reaction.   Stop Miku she's passed out you'll choke her.     those hips      if in this season Bikki will realize about her own feelings  Nah, fuck that realization romance cliche. If anything, she should already know since the beginning of S1.      Best legs on top right     rip adorable shoes       Sports swimsuits make me so fucking hard    https://d.maxfile.ro/pkxopiljnd.web<wbr>m</wbr>   Sure is an odd design for a music school.  Btw, ponytail Miku's lovely.     Why is she so perfect?    She just is.     how does the hat stay on?       She's like the little sister I always wanted but never had.     Tsubasa riding the bike while Chris sits on the back to shoot enemies  and then falling off because Tsubasa's bike stunts are too crazy  when?   It's the whole thing that contrasts her with Hibiki. Maria never had the power to hold hands and bring people together because she couldn't trust anyone, that was why she had to do evil things to try and save the world. Seems like they might bring that angle up in GX since both her quote and description on the site reference the idea.    This time Maria is the double agent?  Will we get more KORT EL FES GUNGNIR?     Maria is what Hibiki would've become if Miku died.    Nah, if Miku died Hibiki would have followed her.     I'm so sorry.  I'm not.       whoa, hey guys, welcome to FIS     Hibiki won't commit suicide but she will become a living zombie as we saw in S2E9.     I'm sure Symphogear is at the limit of how gay a show can be before it's actually considered yuri and tanks in sales.   It will be as gay as Kamen Rider Gaim          She'll die from starvation, japanese cold or truck.   I'll check it out.      she looks overweight or something  maybe just deformed       She's lifting her tits up.      That artist just tends towards drawing the girls healthy, that's all.      America please    Oh god i wanna be smotherd by those Bikis.    Her bikkies are too large and saggy.     Absolutely disgusting.       I don't like this. I want Hibiki to stay a cute short haired and /fit/ tomboy.     NOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo NOT MY DIC- BOOOOOOOOMMM!!!!!...  Oh god my boner just pulled a olympus mons.        Stop. Don't be a fag.   Lurk more or go back to reddit.     DESS!    Holy fuck. I finally got around to reading a summary of Nana'ss autobiography and the tears in my heart won't stop flowing. I can't believe this is all real. Nana is fucking amazing. She needs her own anime adaption.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/next/ EP1 preview.    Why is her past so ridiculously tragic?      Best girls.    Are they not doing the thing with the preview filenames they did with G? Unless SATSURIKU is meant to be something     Um, I thought Zubababan was supposed to be on the other side of the world? Hibiki and her appear together there.     Nana should get married and have kids soon. Else she'll be too old. Fuck the people who'd be against that, she deserves real happiness after everything she went through.    Must be an old hag thing.   You say that like Tsubasa couldn't ramp a motorbike into low-earth orbit to cross the planet in the span of an episode.    She says she wants to settle down and get married eventually, but I can't imagine her abandoning her career.(Both of them.) As for people getting about seiyuu marriage, those are always a vocal minority.     I really like that new song it sounds old school.     Short summary?    Dem Bikki thighs  and fists.    We're going to see them saving the space shuttle, which happens a few months before the concert in England. You can see them standing on it clearly in the old teaser PV.    someone dies in episode 5    I'm not ready      DMJii in straitjackets  But they're harmless! Maria too!     They did kind of threaten the entire planet with the Noise. Certified terrorists.    https://haretaraiine.wordpress.com/<wbr>2011/05/07/shin-ai-summary-chapter-<wbr>1-prologue/ Prep </wbr></wbr>    Heh, they're still doing the DRAMATICALLY SHAKING SCREENSHOT thing.    I love how XTREME the site is.    Hnng!    Should of stayed locked up.    new keywords  ZOOOOOIIIID!    They did it, they actually made me feel sorry for the two idiots.   Hey there. Dumping a manga from 1976.   This series is self-titled “Fleshbomb Masterpiece.” The first chapter is full of flexing muscles, sweating, flowers, and more flexing.                 <br/>    This is already something else        Enjoy the ride.        Internet's shit at the moment, so this will go slowly.   uho~                        He looks like a fucking balloon/human hybrid.     He's having a long day.              I'd say he looks like melting ice cream.  Look at that smug. He's made of ice cream! Has to be.           At this point, I'm not gonna lie and say this is shit because I'm obviously fucking enthralled but what the fuck is even going on?       Man with muscles and amnesia wanders the world. Or, something.       [dramatic foot entrance]       man          Talk   STICKY   LEG (?) CLOSEUP!   BACK(?) CLOSEUP!   STICKY FOOT CLOSEUP   Pull back, capture that ass!   I'm having a bit of a Wiseau feeling about this thing. It's surreal.              It's a fleshbomb masterpiece.        EVEN A KID, IT DOESN'T MATTER  I swear, if this turns into shota fucking I'm gonna go do something I'll regret.                     Proteins are one hell of a drug. Is this /fit/'s bizzarre adventure?           wat     We may never know.                             What the hell is going on?                               I don't even...          Anon, first I must thank you for dumping this. Second, what the flypidity flipdegpiujdfng fuck is all that about?          This thing is like Cho Aniki turned into a surreal drama instead of surreal comedy.                             i swear to fuck araki not only wrote this series, made a drug that can get immortal vampires to trip really badly, but he took said drugs and OD'd extremely hard. this is the only possible explanation i can think of for this manga to exist.                                          What in the fuck is even happening                                                                 Why don't you like old hags, /a/?   Here I'll help you reach the exit     Literal autism.    I think her ass and my face make a great match.    This one? https://vndb.org/v5154/chars     What do you guys think about this series?   I'm excited for October.   Average story with fantastic art and cancerous fanbase.  It is possible to criticize its characters and story, but not its flow and pacing as a comic. It does everything other manga fail at making every page enjoyable, and even with its absurd concept, it is engaging. It's like an antidote to typical shonen.   the most overrated series on /a/  It started off as a parody and slowly turned into the thing it was parodying.  Story-wise it's slightly better than shit like Bleach, but probably will get worse with the upcoming filler arcs.  On the upside it has great art.          /thread    Overrated.   It's okay I guess. I like ONE's version better because looking like shit makes it more amusing.    Get out.     It's really good looking, but the plot is always going to have difficulties because of its ridiculous concept. I think the best review I've heard of it is that it's a parody yet it does really well at being a shonen manga in it's own right.    murata is really wasting his talents on this garbage     Overrated.  Wait until it gets dubed and aired in America. Fuck is it going to get worse.     Murata is known because of this "garbage" faggot.  Like who gave a fk about Eyeshield?     Still, he could be drawing something better, like HxH or berserk.    Are you retarded?   New AoT    average story     that was a stretch, it's really bad tbh   Who anime only here  Pure. Shouldn't get an anime. Let ONE work at his own pace.     Fantastic art   Clearly you're a casual reader, just quit this thread. The original is the one that got super famouse to the point of getting a remake on manga and an anime. Plus the author makes for fun, he is no pro mangaka, he doesn't get payed for his original release, only the manga remake and merchandise.        unironically arguing that ONE's turd is better than murata's remake   It's accepatable for a web series but come on, have some standards.       made me laugh and reply. fuck you  do you hate fun or is it impossible for you to experience it      And from what they seem, they're shitty, like your taste.     reading the rough draft version   come on      I am excited for the hentais.    One is a professional. He draws Mob 100.    there's no female other than tatsumaki, and she won't come until near the end of the anime. keep waiting on them doujins   I just wanna see how Saitama wrecks the loli psychic   he's not gonna let go of her hand through out the whole fight   This is going to be one of those anime were no matter how decent the anime is, the fanbase is going to complain that isn't the manga isn't it?   god its started already all the cancer that never read ones comic  its only gonna get worse with the anime goodbye old awesome opm threads       god i can't wait bout time she knows the power of his workout I just hope the cancer goes away or loses interest so we can have nice threads again.     im guessing he will show a little bit serious and she will throw a epic temper tantrum and when everything she does does nothing to him be will want to marry him or something or atleast be part of the damn he is good harem    Don't worry, anime-only people don't have the patience to wait for ONE/Murata updates once the anime ends.    This sums it up pretty good. I wish ONE would go back to the less serious times where enemies would die during their introduction and not get a 50 chapter arc.    I WOULD LIKE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT MURATAS TATSUMAKI  ONE's tatsu has a very notable mannishness and squareness to her face that murata seems to have eschewed in favor of more conventional 'qt lil girl attractiveness'  But Tatsumaki's character isn't really 'bratty little girl who has uber powers'  she tips over into a creepy, controlling nastiness and I think Murata really missed out by downplaying her somewhat uncanny appearance  thank you           What the hell are you talking about? ONE is just a shit artist. His head shapes for any given character range from potatoes to squares    believe me, tatsumaki is reliably drawn with a relatively large, square jaw for such a petite girl.  Yeah yeah, ONE's art a chicken scratch, but it really is a repeated feature for her. Like you don't see, for example, Genos with that headshape.      If ONE wasn't cool with how a character looked, Murata would change it so shut your gabber you fucker    NO    Then you'll complain about OPM being repetitive.    How do you know that? For all we know maybe ONE's the one backing down on every suggestion Murata proposes because ONE can't into art.    Are you being serious?   Fun to read. The art is unnecessarily good, and 90% of what happens is pointless. It's still nice because it isn't as tryhard as most shonen series, the art is ultimately cool to look at and the occasional comedy is satisfying.     HxH   Togashi tells him to fuck off, he's not touching his work   Berserk   Miura tells him to fuck off, he's not touching his work with worse art       Best Tatsumaki   Easily the greatest manga in the last decade.     Legal loli is best loli   Have a look at this high and mighty know it all faggot. A real fuckin manga aficionado.  THE SERIES IS GONNA STRUGGLE, GUYS.      ONE's weakest series, mostly because it's really fucking repetitive. Murata doesn't really add much more beside his art which is pretty nice but can't make the end product any better.  At least there's some good porn of it now though.       SAUCE      there are people who read murata but not ONE       Can't read a filename   Can't reverse search   Doesn't know the author   Damn, what a waste of good triples, you deserve to be teased.        nothings showing up    Literally first page of Sadpanda for One Punch Man   I see we're already at the   Onepunch-man has always been bad  phase.  Hopefully we'll loop back to sincere appreciation within a few years.        look it up   it's only six pages, with four actual content pages  wow it's like I'm really reading OPM      The only people who've been prasing OPM are the newfags who never read anything else from ONE, even MnO which is even more disjointed and fillery than OPM has much better writing and characters.   wow it's like I'm really reading OPM  It should only make your dick harder.       It was bound to happen as soon as the anime was announced. What's weird though is I could tell this manga would get an anime and a video game from the first murata chapter yet people were deluded about how much it would explode in fandom. It's like they assumed it would just stay a niche manga for all eternity despite how refreshing it is.     Berserk    Better art  Are you retarded anon?      Better than most manga. If people were actually complaining about this try to read ONE's version. It's actually gone pretty far .    Anyone has got fanarts of her ONE look ?   Honest question. If I'm not really into it after 20 chapters, will I not really enjoy the rest of the series? Is it pretty much the same or does it get better? I don't mind sticking through stuff if I know it'll get better.   Nah I loved it pretty much after the first chapter. I don't think it's for you if you don't appreciate it.    sorry I meant 30 chapters not 20.    ah alright, thanks.      Overrrated.    best thing out atm    Fuck off.    Based.   Previous thread    Chapter 5 complete and Epilogue almost complete, god bless summary anon.     Cutest and world's best imouto.    Remember:  Natsumi, Yoshino and MIku fucking lesbians   Ellen is wescott's whore   Flatori best imouto   Tohka a retard   Origami the best         So were here?    Natsumi, Yoshino and MIku fucking lesbians  No. Fuck off. Only Miku is a filthy lesbofag.     Literally 0 of those things are true     Thoka not a retard   Nigga what?       Flatori best imouto  Stay delusional, faget.     3 threads without the Houkifag shitposting.   Holy fuck, man.  DAL threads are finally saved!      Don't be tricked so easily  Try and think of one character that hasn't raped Tohka  I can't      Natsumi is gayer than Miku. And Yoshino is okay with it.     Mana     Flatori best imouto  Nothing to disagree about. Shidou already agreed, don't bother him about it.      But this entire volume was everyone raping Shidou.     The only rapey thing involving Tohka is her raping shido's mouth     I want to fuck the shit out of Kotori and make her my wife.     Get in line.    Why does she wear panties under her pajama?    Who doesn't?     I don't     - Shidou coughed. He remembered the promise with Tohka. After he captured Yoshino, Tohka said "don't kiss with anyone else but me" to him. Shidou keep quiet about it since he can't make Spirits become emotionally unstable.  - Shidou tried making an excuse. But Tohka said sorry that she made a contradict condition to him. She asked Shidou to save Spirits, yet disallow the method to do that. - However, Tohka then continued that he should have told her back then. She thought Shidou have other ways of sealing Spirit Power for all along.  - Shidou said sorry to her and lowered his head. Tohka shook her head once again and tell him she forgive him, but with a condition. Shidou widen his eyes because Tohka, while knitting her brows at the pain, climbed down from her bed and climbed up into his bed.   "Er, Tohka?" "I don't have any complains. But since Shidou violated our promise, —"  - Tohka counted off her fingers while calling the Spirit's name. Yoshino, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Miku, Natsumi, Origami. Tohka blushed and say in small voice,  "…Seven. That's the number of times you kept secret from me. I'll forgive you this time with seven kisses." "Wha…? H-hey, wait, Tohka!?" "No questions. Or you don't want to kiss with me?" "No, that's not what I meant, others are —" "Then there's no problem! Sit still. I'll be done fast." "W-Wait!"  - Tohka covered up him and pushed her lips toward Shidou's lips. Shidou feel a pleasure like his brain is burning up.  "N…chu…" "…! …!!"  - That moment,                          "Sorry to keep you waiting, Shidou. I've brought everyo —"  - The door opened. Kotori froze in front of it. Tohka widen her eyes in surprise and separate her lips away from his. Shidou's lips got pulled with her lips a little before it bounced back.  - Their lips are connected to each other with glittering thread made of saliva. With that scene, Kotori and the Spirits, and Mana rushed into the room.  "W-wait, what were you doing in this short timespan, Shidou!?" "U-um… you both just recovered, I think you…" "Ka, kaka… Tohka sure takes the cake." "Pointing out. Kaguya seems frustrated." "Kyaa! Eh? I didn't saw it properly, so could you do it again! Again please!" "UAW… you just woke up and did that… how gross." "…As expected, I can't be off guard." "Nii-sama! What are you doing!?"  - Everyone said that and surrounded Shidou's bed.  "H-hey, everyone calm down. I…"  - Shidou tried smoothing it over. However, he couldn't came up with any excuse.   "Muu…"  - Tohka is also the same. Since it came to this, Tohka then hugged Shidou. The Spirits raise up their voices "Ahh!".   "Haha…"  - In the tumult that Shidou felt it has been a long time since he heard it, he patted Tohka head while smiling bitterly.   [End]                               I WANT TO FUCK KOTORI!    this blatant favoritism     Based Tohka!    SEVEN  KISS     SUMMARY ANON WE LOVE YOU THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.   Remember Kaguya a cutie    Tohka being sly, that was great.  Also, thanks summary anon. You're too good to us. Get some sleep.       At this point, if this ends up having a harem ending it will be just an excuse to please the fans.    Time to sleep summary anon. Respects and thanks to you. Good night.      Thank you a lot, Summary Anon.      Thanks man and God bless you, splendid job with all the summaries.    Tohka BESSST  also thank you so much based summary anon. Sleep well      Afterword?    Why you dont suck a dick faggot, he do the whole volume already.        FUCK THIS RETARD FAVORITISM SHIT      Who cares about the afterword? I could probably tell you what's there.     Their lips are connected to each other with glittering thread made of saliva  Lewd. Thanks so much based summary anon    ku ku ku thank you summary anon   Tohka wins a flawless victory. Don't worry Origami, you can still be second.    Greedy retard, seriously I doubt this series will have a harem end.    Well I can't really be mad since she's got the guts to take the initiative. Night! Thanks    It will.   as long as bwaka gets her kisses      Tohka a greedy girl. Shidou belongs to everyone.    Thanks a lot, you're the real hero    Unless we  kill the Tohka.     S2 BDs never, did FFF drop it or is anyone else doing them?    and people say there is no favoritism in this novel.    Postword  - This is the first book since Tachibana's debut with a male character on the cover (total of over 20 volumes!). - The spread illustration this time is 'that thing'. If you don't know what it is, then open volume 1 page 131 (chapter 2). What a long foreshadow. Was it even a foreshadow? - New series "Itsuka Sekai wo Sukuu Tame ni -Qualidea Code-" will be released on August 18th. Illustrated by Haimura Kiyotaka. In a world that has been evaded by an enemy of grotesque looks, boys and girls are fighting to protect their country… but those boys and girl don't really care about the world being in danger or whatsoever. They just pour their love into a certain girl. It's like Origami being split into several characters. What is that how scary.  - Dragon Age 2015/09 will have Date A Live Marugoto BOOK that complies all articles from Dragon Magazine with few Tsunako illustrations that never been recollected anywhere before. - PSV Date A Live Twin Edition Rio Reincarnation out August 30. - Date A Live SS1 BDBOX coming out on August 31 with additional scenes. - Date A Live Mayuri Judgement screen August 22.  - See you again in DAL13 or Itsuka Sekai wo Sukuu Tame ni -Qualidea Code-.  - Tachibana will still continue writing DAL so don't worry.    Bed time. It was fun guys.  mfw back from Japan on August 19th   mfw movie will be screened on 22nd                     What a greedy slut  she needs a spanking from Reine     Not since volume 2.   You are the best summary anon! Thanks!   And she's even more dangerous now that she knows she loves him.   Night! Thanks       Thanks for this. http://pastebin.com/Kcm2PsAm      good to know Tachibana hasn't given up     I am, and I'm up first.    Thanks anon.    Thank you summary anon!   Movie thread next?   Thks for all your hard work, great summary Good night     Yes she is.   So now that we this  What was everyone's general thoughts of the volume?    She deserves more kisses anyway. Its only fair since he lied to her!    No she was just being retarded    3.5/5  A bit goofy. But we learned a bit more. Even if just a little.. Still enough to speculate      I don't think it was a Volume 7, but not bad. Though Tachibana sure loves to take his time with the reveals.  DAL 25 last volume?     meh it was alright all the plot happened then it was date time fallowed by main girl favoritism then it sets up for the next volume    It's a set up novel. Asked more questions than it answered and did more foreshadowing than we've had in a while.  Oh and it put Tohka at the head of the competition for the Shidobowl in case anyone had forgotten.      It was alright. And at least everyone got kisses    Probably going to have to back and reread the Phantom parts. That was a lot of info that just seemed to be out there.    Average, too much fanservice and not enough plot. Disappointed Shidou didn't do much in berserk mode.     with few Tsunako illustrations that never been recollected anywhere before.  My dick is ready.     A bit of a delay on a new spirit... Which is disappointing. But after the end I can't really complain that much    Things look bleak for the harem end, darn you Tachibana   So what do we think the last few spirits powers are?   Better than volume 5 and 6 but worse than 7. I was expecting much more.    4/5 It was ok, have a little plot and Shidou berserk was fun    Yeah, but it doesn't look like anyone is catching up to Tohka anytime soon.   No.2 spirit Next time   Inverse Kurumi when?     I wouldn't say bleak.. Note Tohka somewhat acknowledged she loves the others too. And I think she may just want some special treatment if he's gonna do stuff with the others too    Nah, still going to be a harem end. The harem will be "Tohka and all the others" though.     Once again, thanks a lot Summary Anon.   Such a bad timing indeed, Just a couple days away from the movie!        She's probably fine as long as he gives her some extra lovin. Which is kinda cute actually.    Not bad but disappointing overall, the scene where all the girls kissed Shidou was underwhelming as fuck.    WHY DID THEY CUT HER HAIR?!?    Nepgear?   Vol.20  Reine True End     I don't know if it's just the summary downplaying it or not, but I feel the same way about the dates too.    Tohka literally holds an advantage because she gets jealous  Its the ultimate weapon in harems. Kotori is waaay to discreet with her jealousy, while Tohka will literally voice how she feels. Being okay with a harem end (like miku is) doesn't actually bode that well for an individuals chances    Who the fuck is Mio    Keep in mind, we only read the summary. Translator anon, what were your thoughts?    You'll have to wait until tomorrow, he's probably long gone.    The Momo paradox in action.    Oh god my heart, she was so perfect.    Best mom deserves a good route.    I feel a bit angry to be honest, all that wait and only the last chapter is plot, some dates were weak and the scene with the girl kissing Shidou even though he was going berserk and the girls had little to no power was bland.    I think it was kinda cute. Mostly fluff in this volume. With some tiny bits here and there of plot hints   No.2 spirit Next time   Inverse Kurumi when?    Miku is worst girl   You think that the volume with Shidou on it would be more plot heavy, but apparently not. Quite a bit of setup, but otherwise just a twist to the generic DAL formula.    It was fun.    I think that's what almost everyone expected but the worst part is with Shidou going berserk this volume Tachibana can't use this plot point again for future volumes.    Moegami is best Origami.     we will never get her decently animated      Interesting slow down volume. Like the reverse take on making the Spirits take on Shidou instead of the other way around.     They aren't too far behind     That's a nepgear   This is also a nepgear.      Tohka has like 12 kisses now. Who's next, Yoshino with 4?      Maybe?... You never know with Tsunako.      Sure they can. Next time he can skip the berserk state and go straight to Inversing and raining fire and brimstone ovee the world.    Decent for a break volume but It didn't excuse the amount of time we wait for it.   Movie Thread Next?   but we need build up first and there must be a really good reason for that to happen considering Shidou didn't even go inverse this volume   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188584  I would have done her doggy style right then and there.    This may as well as be it, considering the thread is new and will be probably be here all night.

Plus now we know that Mana was actually kidnapped and something happened to Mio. However that happened four years ago, which was after Shidou was left with the Itsuka family. It's all a crazy time line.    This. Long wait, then Shidou on cover, "Itsuka Disaster", but it's just a break volume. Maybe there are some consequences for Shidou going berserk later on?    mfw tell myself I'll drop the series if the retard asks for kisses for all the spirits he's sealed   she does   It was a good run guys, dropping the series.      Shidou suddenly recalling those events, Mio and Phantom lines were the only new info we got in this volume, sadly.    I'd make her do more than sweat.    She only gave Shidou 1 extra kiss.    Ellen kills Mana in front of Shido after a whole volume of childhood establishing flashbacks.    SUFFERING SINCE KURUMI GOT NOTHING.   INB4 HER FAULT  I know. But still. It was alright. Also tohka has a frighteningly insatiable appetite for shidou kisses.      It's not a bad idea but Mana must become a spirit if she wants to get relevance for more than 1 chapter.    Not just that, but we also got info about Mana's situation. Ellen apparently was the one who captured Mana. I have to question if it was DEM or Phantom who memory wiped Mana, considering how we've only seen Phantom with the power of memory wipes. Plus it seems if Shidou does get his memory back, he's going to have real resentment against DEM.   Not only that, but we also got a better idea of Phantom's goal thanks to the explanation of Sephira crystals.      Dates were enjoyable, all the girls got kisses, setting up plot for the next arc, dealing with Kotori's killing Shidou bullshit. It was an alright bridge volume, so to call it. Too much blatant Tohka favoritism, but then again, it's Date A Tohka     I feel like the author trolled us with this volume. Anyway, it would be lame if he decides to use the "Shidou going berserk thing again" I mean the only threat he posed was being a time bomb but he wasn't destroying the city like Origami did and the girls in those very weak forms still managed to stop him.     Not just that, but we also got info about Mana's situation. Ellen apparently was the one who captured Mana  but Mana getting kidnapped by DEM wasn't anything new. We even speculate about it in older threads.     Don't worry author will reward us with Inverse Kurumi   Miku is worst girl  Any ideas what the next spirit will look like  Long hair and young looking.   another nep clone    Meant for      If she is Number 2 she may have silver/gray hair. If she is Number 6 she may be the drill/blonde high-class type girl. If she is not a Number she may refer to herself as a FREE GIRL.     Either a blonde or grey haired girl, he can also save time and just create another Nepgear.    Mayuri    Thats not Flatori    if some how he makes the movie cannon   Considering the current LN world and how it's developing, and how we pretty much got Birispirit for the movie  here's the daily prayer for Mayuri being tsuntsun   I'd say the next spirit will be some sort of sly foxy kouhai type of girl, if you know what I mean.       Grope her    What part will you grope?      (You)   What part will you grope?   this should be obvious her motherly mounds       Stop making fun of my girlfriend, asshole.    FLAT   So I just finished rewatching S1, does the novels go back and explain more about how Mana as approximately 10 years to live? Or is that something that hasn't been delved into yet since we haven't had a Mana Arc yet in the LN?   She's delicious     Natsumi's loli form still has a bigger chest than Kotori    I can't wait to gaze upon this cute creature   WIZARD MAGIC AIDS  AINT GOT SHIT TO EXPLAIN   Her body was altered in order to manipulate magic on a higher level than a normal realizer, however she's not too compatible with it or something and that fucks her up.<br/>          She'll be the first Spirit that Shido cannot save.     Yes she is.   You say that like it's a bad thing.      Her body's being destroyed by the power jammed into her     causing this much despair in a LN   in DAL of all places  lolno      Technically that was Rinne in her first end    Multiverse theory will make Mayuri cannon    Get out toriyama    What's the difference between Kotori's bra and Tohka's head?   Nothing they're both empty       I'd jam something into her alright.    Magic surgery    I want to take Mii on a dato.    movie will be a reset like utopia and remain Canon/ non canon indefinitely but will still be referenced in the main novel    but that was Kurumi    hasn't saved yet    The author never reuses the same endings, just look at Arusu.    11/10 Funniest post of the day.     Could happen. They've been hinting for a long time that when a Spirit dies it leaves a Sephira. If Mana's mostly dead and a Spirit is actually dead, the solution seems obvious.  Also, baseless speculation, but what if Mio is Shido and Mana's older sister?   Why does she have breasts.         Because she can't be saved, Shidou failed in volume 3 and there is nothing he can do about it.    I want the entire trio    but there is the problem she doesn't have a number in her name.    You can have the other two. I want to cutie with the glasses.    DAL isn't that dark and after all the origami bullshit you expect me to believe she won't be saved?    Anime breasts enhancement.   All the games are canon.   but Origami only killed her parents unlike Kurumi who has killed 10000+ people and I doubt Shidou will go back to the past again if Kurumi's plan involves killing Shidou and take his powers.      I think Mio was a friend of Shido and Mana's mother trusted before leaving for plot.  Also which are the kanjis for Mio in this novel?     I want to marry and anally ravage Tame   Except Ars Install and the third game.   Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice  Reminder that Mio is Shidou's and Mana's childhood friend who was captured by DEM along with Mana  Picture related, Mio and Tohka being sluts        Why does she have breasts.   Because she's best sister  more like only sister, fakes don't count       Cute as fuck  She's my second favorite.      Then there is a strong likely hood of the movie in some way being cannon the author dose have a hand in it after all    Too many sisters    Phantom is Rinne     too many sisters  Never     Shido is a generic nice guy he wants to save all the spirits    Glasses    Only Rinne Utopia is canon.    Tohka is pure anon    based summary anon. You tha' MVP.    and what does that have to do with saving Kurumi if he doesn't have the means to stop her?    Technically, neither does Reine. Not arguing your point, just observing.   Dunno, plus we only have her first name.      Miku is worst girl   Bwaka's can't be pure.     not liking glasses.     then neither does Shidou      Knowing the author he will come up with a solution such as Phantom sending shido back to stop her from killing the First because that doesn't fit with phantoms objective     wanting 7(SEVEN) kisses all at once   "pure"     Ratatoskr is filled with assholes, why not just hire better personal?    Doesn't love dfc Kotori  Why is awful normalfag-like taste like this allowed?     Phantom doesn't have time travel powers.   Now we have to wait for the actual translation   it's not confirmed that she doesn't have some form of it   Best Imouto  Shidou said so, don't bother him about it     Like the others aren't going to press for an equal number themselves, so status quo will be preserved.    Amusingly, he does: 五河. Five.    but that is Kotori's family name not Shidou's.     loli <br/>   Kiss count  Tohka: 5 Kotori, Yoshino: 3 Everyone else: 2  Disgusting         Tachibana would never do that considering Phantom is using Kurumi for her cause.    You're cute. Here's your reply.     he doesn't like glasses     Yoshino has 4 if you count that one in Date A Origami    Retard Favoritism    No Kotori's cute. That anon is just a shit head.    More like magnificent  If only she wasn't interrupted. Damn you Tachibana.     by the end of the series Tohka will have more than 10 kisses.    Excuse me while I vomit    dose Phantom truly want Kurumi to kill the first spirit? that is the question that would determine her action     The way it should be    She will die    He doesn't go by Takamiya though. He even thinks of himself as Itsuka.    and taken a half dozen dicks    Quit shit posting and hiding behind Tohka. No wonder no one likes her.    No, that's why I said Phantom was using Kurumi for her own cause.    Belive in the multiverse    But that's wrong.  I love her     He's still a Takamiya and Wetscott said he doesn't know anything about Itsuka Shidou but Takamiya Shidou is a different story.    That doesn't apply in the DALverse.    You're not helping her image. I liked her too, but you're leaving a bad impression.      Tohka in charge of remaining a virgin   A failed task if ever there was one      More likely because people are jelly the based Tohka, despite being a "retard" still manages to hold the lead.   Hopefully       fair enough, though I believe she will go through a hell of suffering then ultimately own up to what she has done, then and only then can she find redemption and be saved    Is there a pastebin with the entire summary?   He's taunting Shidou. What Shidou calls himself won't change even when his memories of his birth family return.    Retard.    Even a piece of shit can get the lead if the author writes it like that. Look at Oreimo    Utopia pretty much proves there is a Multiverse or at least alternate timelines    and? Shidou is still a Takamiya who was adopted by the Itsuka family.     Look at Oreimo  FUCK YOU, I ALMOST FORGOT    Serious question though, where does this rape joke come from?   What the fuck are you saying? Rinne just created a dream world. DAL only has different timelines so far.     joke      Kirino   bad  Fuck off mang.      From 4chan.     joke     Way back when volume 7 was not even translated we got spoiler with Westcott saying he wanted to steal Tohka's pride as a woman or something,    Someone thinks they're funny cause they spammed "retard" and "tohka was raped" for the past 2 years.    Volume 7 spoiler and that pic with mind boken Tohka.      Retard    Yeah, that was a thing that happened. It's legitimately creepy too, but the spammers are just spewing shit and not referencing that.    I remember all that delicious Tohko suffering.    五河士道. Five is there, but that is a red herring since that is not his birth name. So if we go with the original 崇宮士道 we get 士 from the name and 十一 put together make his real number which is 11.    It was even more surprising how some Tohkafags thought the rape jokes were real.    Eden was an alternate space the engulft the city    No     That imagesize   &gt;archive filename confirms it Holy fucking shit, it's tohka bump limit retard       After seeing it for the three hundredth time it's hard to tell if anon is failing to be funny or shitposting.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127191422  This spoiled the volume for me unironically when I came here    Not amount of suffering can save Kurumi from his fate, changing her past is the only way.     mfw all those butthurt retardfags dropping the series every thread  Hilarious     Did you enjoy all the suffering in this volume?    I was expecting Kotori suffering to be honest, now there is no chance for her to go inverse.    then that's what Tachibana will do   Color anon where?  Coloring for this when?     it was Delicious     swimsuit theighhigh combo  my dick is destroyed     I doubt he will use the same method to save Kurumi, especially when Kurumi is the one who used it on Shidou.   I want to invert Tohka's anus, if you know what I mean.   I don't follow    Personally, I found the whole thing funny with those naive Tohkafags falling for such obvious bait.     prolapse is my fetish  m-me too     Retard.    Get the fuck out, Houkifag.     I only come for summary threads .    yeah I agree with you there it will be different, but Tachibana will find away this im certain of.  much hype for those volumes       In the end that paste managed to fulfill it's purpose, drive secondaries away from 2nd season threads.   Sisters harem when?   She got two kisses and you are still complaining? That's being greedy like Tohka.   Why does DAL have no tits in it. Have you guys seen how hot Shinmai maou is? Jesus christ why was DAL so prude by comparison  So /a/, who is the lewdest DAL?   How can you have a harem with only two girls?    Instead of vaginal sex, I'll stick it in her pooper.  Eww ew, no ew. I rather stick it in a blender or Char than to touch her.      You posted her    Don't reply to anything with "houkifag"  Because DALs are not exhibitionists      Retard    Nah, episode 1 did everything. Even the subbing groups dropped DAL.    Anything with Houki in it should be an automatic trigger of any sane person.     I was actually going to say it was Shido. Just look at this filth.     Wrong audience.    If she was trying to seduce me, she just succeeded.    But she was stopped 6 short of the deserved number    and that case you should post Tohka who is always asking for holding hands.    She didn't deserve those kisses, Tohka is greedy and needs to learn some manners.    I think she prefers pats  Yoshino!     Miku is worst girl   She got lied to. I say she deserves it.  She's still a retard though: she should have asked for those when they're all alone with no possibility of anyone disturbing.      Retard    I don't even like Tohka that much, but I'd pet her head.  And water is wet. Your point?       I think she prefers pats  All the girls do. Kurumi asked for head patting as payment for fighting Miku. Well that or sucking his blood.      She got lied to  What?    Yoshino deserves more kisses!   Spoilered for your safety.    It's a pretty reasonable request actually.    what the fuck is wrong with that thumbnail?    We need at least three sisters to call it harem.     being this much of a newfag     Not really, Tohka is jealous and wants more kisses yet still demans Shidou must no kiss the others.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=i_4<wbr>SrmKaCx4</wbr>  [ ]   Shiori in beautiful astral dress when?   Retard    It's past your bed time, Tohka.    Shidou lied to Tohka    No, she actually never said he can't kiss the others. In fact she acknowledged her mistake in making an unreasonable request. As a repayment for him technically breaking their promise though the number of kisses could be equalised for her. Very reasonable request.    I wonder how he will save Kurumi because I can't think a way to save her.    When?    No idea, I saved the image a few times over in different file types to reduce the size. Posted this and got that thumbnail. I thought 4chan was fucking up, but it turns like that every time I post it.     agreed he wouldn't kiss others   did it anyway      When he didn't tell Tohka how spirits are sealed.    Are you serious? Do you even remember the reson Tohka asked for the kisses in the first place? It's because Shidou "broke" the promise with Tohka in volume 2 even though he never agreed.    Kissing her after she fails in her mission and Inverses. Shido uses Kotori's halberd to burn out City of Devouring Time while Natsumi conceals him and Origami beamspams the clones.    Also     I want her to be saved  ;_;      he never agreed  Wrong. He did agree.     but he never lied to Tohka. She saw how he kissed Kotori and Origami and knew Shidou had to kiss Yoshino to save her.     Origami beamspams the clones.  It's far easier to just impale them on ice, as seen on Vol 6 or 7, I don't remember.     He can't use the halberd so the best he could do on that front is transform the sword into the halberd.    I'm a bit surprised how initiative she is to be honest. Tohka always strikes me as the type to be more embarrassed about those things.    She's a clone murderer and deserves to die.     Very reasonable request.  She's not accounting for all the kisses the other spirits would deserve as well.     I don't think she was ever told Yoshino had to be kissed. And she never saw those two or she would have spoken up about shidou not keeping the promise he agreed to    I think you are missing the part where Shidou has to find a way to get the old Kurumi back and that's not all, he also has to convince her she can live a normal life but Kurumi doesn't even want that.    Nigga plz    Was that ever stated? I mean, it'd be a horrible idea because it turns you into a raging berserker, but it's got to happen eventually.  Plus fire is super effective against Kurumi.   Yeah probably, but Kurumi's got that shadow power, so I think Metatron's probably got a type advantage. Or maybe they'd cancel each other out. Hard to say, but while Zadkiel and Metatron are both good at crowd control Yoshino just isn't vicious enough.  Thank god. Her Inverse is going to be worse than Nightmare.           I don't think she was ever told Yoshino had to be kissed  That's the main reason she asked for a kiss in Yoshino's arc.     Oh right. My bad.  Still she acted like she didn't know the kiss was important and that he kissed all the spirits. She probably genuinely didn't know what was happening.  And so we are back to that. Shidou didn't explain that he needed to kiss them to Retard. See  trail of posts.         mfw that new OVA  Holy shit     HE the author is literally god of this universe he will make it work   I want her to be saved ;_;   me too         Thank god. Her Inverse is going to be worse than Nightmare.     but that's not lying, Shidou never denied the fact he kissed other girls, he just didn't tell Tohka and probably assumed she knew.    but he always try to find a different way to save the girls, I even thought he was saving the time travel card for Kurumi's arc.    That's where mission failure comes into the picture. If she can't kill Spirit 1, (or if doing it sets off the spacequake) she goes into despair since all the awful things she did were for nothing. See Wakfu, Nox. The difficulty after that is stopping her from suicide or cracking the world as Inverse Nightmare. The trick to that should be rooftop Kurumi's memories and getting real Kurumi to take them. Here's hoping that one of the remaining spirits has memory powers.   Something like that yes, except worse because Yoshino is cute.       The only Angel he can physically manifest is Sandalphon's Sword(since he can't manifest the chair). The rest of the Angels seems to manifest as additional abilities like Miku's Voice, Natsumi's tranformation, Yoshino's water manipulation, Twins' wind powers, Origami's light powers and Kotori's healing flame. So henceforth if he wants to use the other Angels physical forms, he has to transform Sandalphon into them. That's why I think his true Angel would be a Sword itself.    More like he danced around it and hoped she never found out  “......That promise, did you properly keep it?”    “Th, that, this is......”    Shidou did not reply, he started to stutter.    It was understandable. In order to seal the power of the spirits kissing is essential.    How would Tohka react to that, she looked over with a long face and surprised eyes.    “......This won’t do. We’ve made a promise. That......you see, if I’m here, we can do it now?”                I don't think a few of happy memories is enough to overcome the fact she has killed 10000+ people for nothing. It would be a cheap way to save Kurumi.    I feel like she will have to live with those deaths the rest of her life as payback but shido will help her cope with it    Except I remember he summoned the Kaleidostick to make himself younger during Origami's arc.  I think he summons the most obvious aspect of a given Angel to accomplish the task at hand. He COULD do the rest, but he's not at the level where he can visualize it, passive abilities notwithstanding.      Not that guy but that doesn't even prove he cannot use other weapons, it just means he only uses the word when fighting is needed.      He already did that in Origami's arc but carrying the burden of 10000+ deaths is too much for a girl who wants to live a normal life.     we can do it now?  this damn kiss slut    Hopefully this Mio girl will have a good personality, I don't want another Miku or Natsumi.   I kind of want some tsun    so then another alternative would be canceling out those deaths to were they never even happened  the more I think about it the more I wonder what the author has planned for for her sealing it an't going to be easy.      Kotori already fits that role.     Yeah, it's going to suck for her if she actually wants a redemption arc. How does anyone make up for 10,000 deaths? Is it just a matter of trying and hoping to live a good life?  I mean, I'm sure I'll be disappointed by the answer they end up giving us, but it's a fascinating question.       That would require time travel but with Kurumi going inverse they can't ask her for help.    The more tsun the better anon, tsun is always welcome    Haniel can copy any Angel.  I'm kinda curious how negative Natsumi would have to go to use it like that again though.       Another alternative is if Shidou pays the price in Kurumi's place.     Just checked the chapter that has him use Natsumi's powers for the first time. It was mental use, no kaleidostick here. I think he can only do Sword since if he summons the other Angels physically it kinda takes away the impact and uniqueness of that Angel to the spirits not to mention that the only thing that Tohka can give to him is either the Sword or the Chair and I think that the Chair is tied to Tohka herself. Same with the other physical manifestations of the Angels to Spirits themselves.    maybe she accidentally erases her own past?    Fuck no    The copy is a weaker version of the original iirc, I don't even know if he can use that.    That would be more shido's style then letting her suffer    then she would disappear like Rinne.    What if Kurumi manages to paradox all the Spirits, except her Inverse Form and Shido?  So all the Spirits are normal people who don't know Shido at all, but Kurumi's still rampaging and Shido still has the sealed power. Holy shit that would make for an amazing arc.   I also like your idea that's she's personally destroyed her own timeline.         Yeah but how big must be the price to pay for Kurumi's actions   M-Mana will become relevant right   You can have Natsumi then, she is a bit Tsun after all.    Sure    Mana must be saved so even if she doesn't become a spirit, she still will get some relevance.    No    What?    it certainly would turn everything on its head.     most of his power and sanity and all of her power but she stays Human since she has a physical body        Yes.    Hopefully fucking not. We have our imouto already      Losing his powers? I doubt that can happen but his sanity is a different story.    and is called Mana    Kotori pls    I meant like how Kurumi used the raw power inside him to power the time travel. so he doesn't lose the abilities just the fuel for them    How? Some girls were not even human.    The spirit mana inside Shidou also belongs to the girls.     Like this?     0/10 You didn't even change the mole     but it's stored within him    why would it be this    Maybe for adult Natsumi but not for Yoshino    but if anything happens to the spirit Mana the girls can feel it too.    Delusions     Plot bunny. Kurumi uses 12th bullet to make a new timeline without the Spirits, but accidentally causes a paradox. In the new timeline, she is the only Spirit, and Inverses in despair. While Shido keeps his powers and memories, the other Spirits are perfectly normal humans living in the city. This means he's still Takamiya Shido whose younger sister is Mana, Yamai is one person, Kotori doesn't know Shido, long hair Origami is still around and the original Spirits have human families. Oh and Ratatoskr doesn't exist.  BUT he wants to save Kurumi, so he allies with the AST. So it's mook girls and human with spirit powers vs. the worst Spirit gone super saiyan. I think it'd be pretty neat.    How? Some girls were not even human.  Honestly, I doubt that. I suspect that all the Spirits were human at one point. Just because of genre convention though, don't have any evidence.           then maybe they all need to work together to overcome the price with shido receiving some kind of loss of sanity   Miku is worst girl   Miku is sexy   This has been a good thread so far but it's too late over here, see you later guys.          Plot bunny. Kurumi uses 12th bullet to make a new timeline without the Spirits, but accidentally causes a paradox. In the new timeline, she is the only Spirit, and Inverses in despair. While Shido keeps his powers and memories, the other Spirits are perfectly normal humans living in the city.

I think it'd be pretty neat.   I like this theory         Shidou is the only who can save Kurumi, sadly the girls can't help with this.    Let's have one over the weekend or something.    Good Night    a bitch**    I mean as far as lending him their power    Weekend threads usually are slower though.    Then she is a sexy bitch    I take that back.  is the funniest post I've seen all day.    I gotta admit I'm impressed. I thought this thread would just die after the summary finished    If thats' really all you care about in a character then it's just sad     implying that isn't why 90% of people are here      They have always been but I was under the impression that Summary Anon will do at least two of the short stories.     It's probably tsunako actually    I honestly thought it was a Live-A-Live spinoff when I found it on BT. Still just a little bitter it isn't.    well we're pretty kill now, but it's late, so understandable. Still, very surprising     I actually expected Summary Anon to just finish it in the other thread and call it a day. But he actually went all the way to the Afterword.  A Real Hero.      Is Tohka still a retard?   She's gotten more retarded      No she's a genius kiss stealer     OK that one got me.    How can anyone hate a girl for being bisexual. W A T  Seriously these guys are messed up. Miku is perfect       She's shidosexual.     &gt;Miku is perfect.   In Ars Install? Yeah, she is. In the Novels? Not so much unfortunately.        ;_;     I hope IMS doesn't fuck this movie up  All girls are best, just Kotori is slightly a cut above the rest. (except Oragami shes fucking terrible)    The trailer does not seem very promising but they have been "recovering" so it may not be that bad.  It may be the last we see of DaL animated no mater what happens to the movie.       Same, but I don't mind Origami at all, especially the new Origami.  Miku is about the least best for me though.    Silent thread is silent.      Like this?     My flame will never die.    I want to stir up Shiori's boipussy.   Magical girl spinoff starring Kotori and Mana when?   A blonde twintail tsundere with lightning powers.    I want to believe.    She's not that bad, look at her!  She should've kept medium length hair       dat cat  Erry time.     So now that Mana is back, are we getting more imouto wars?  Or is she getting sent back to the hospital.     Yoshino deserves about 7 more kisses    I'm leaning more on the latter. Never mind the time-travel fuckery. It just reset the death timer.    Just waiting for Kurumi to join Shidou already  and give Mana her "time" back.     She already is. She took up most of the plot this volume.    She took up as much plot as she did in Volume 6, barely anything. She only really did a lot in Volumes 3 and 7.   Will Mana ever get a break?  Do you guys think Mana will ever get a volume?     I hope so. I need the lewd Mana.    She gets the plot not PLOT.    Still didn't end up doing much anyway, she just has a niche role in the story.   I want more PLOT with Mana. She's more lively than the others.        Have you read Mana Research?     Yeah, but having it in the main volumes is more meaningful somehow. Her scenes with Kotori in Vol. 3 is one of my favorites in DAL. Besides, if she stays around for PLOT we'll probably get some plot out of her anyway.     wanting PLOT from the bad Imouto     Not wanting PLOT from genki imouto.     Mana   genki  She's just a shitty tomboy-like Imouto     Is Date A Origami dead? You know, with Origami being a spirit and all now.   It ended a long time ago    Kotori pls    I believe its dead yes    She was okay in the epilogue and Managed to fight Ellen for a while, she's stronger now.    Why is Tama-chan stalking Shidou in these images?    Miku is shit and a lesbian, how see how she was mora excited about kissing Shidou after Natsumi kissed him.   Waiting for pastebin   To marry him    Dude are you a bwaka or something?   Check    or Just http://pastebin.com/Kcm2PsAm        Great, hopefully it won't be that detailed for the translator.    TL already said it was ok and he would translate the volume.    I know but he could still lose motivation if they tease him too much.    There barely a chance for Mana to become relevant unless she is a spirit.     manipulates Shidou from the shadows  Seriously, what's up with that description of Reine?     Foreshadowing. Reine is Phantom   And the self-declared winner of the Kiyoshibowl is...  i wonder what her urine must taste like   HANA Say it with me HANA     Will the anime be good?  pls be good;_;      HANA!     Utopia is slacking off again? Where the hell is ch180?     I can fap to this.  Is that the Snow White cap Chiyo had in the cover pic?      Nevermind, the tiara resembles Chiyo's though.    is that a fucking Ootsuka Reika drawing?    He is drawing a non hentai manga now.     Reika   he      she peed on him and then kissed him and yet Kiyoshi's not happy  It's over, Hanabros. There's only so much a woman can do for a man.    Kiyoshi would become the most hated MC ever.     HANA A N A        Mari.     Why is her body so thick in this picture? Not that I am complaining in the least, but she's usually seen as skinny in the manga.   I wish thick Hanna would stay.       Looks skinny as ever to me. Maybe it's the perspective that confuses you.     Dude, you can even see her ribs. Hiramoto really is a god.     Bitch stole the hips and legs from Meiko my niggah.      we'll never get a scene of Kiyoshi and Hana just cuddling, no fetishes        what is perspective?  She's as perfect as ever, no vice-prez shit.      Hana Hana bobana, banana fana fofana, fee fie momana, Hana    What the hell? My dick likes this hana very very much.    Another great porn artirst lost in battle.     He thinks it'll be good   In addition, the anime will ruin the threads, or at least make it worse than it already is.       181 Korean scans tomorrow   Still no sign of utopia     was 180 scanlated by anons? or just the in thread translation of koreans?   It's a dream for a porn drawer to have a proper manga. Look at Tosh, and his Shokugeki no Soma, it's really working.     porn drawer   drawer  eh nandatte?      An anon typeset it in the korean thread   I want to have sex with Hana!   That's what I'm talking about homie. That Ho's ready for Mandingo Thursday.    Hana will never passionately make out with you    Those lovely.....HIPS!    HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA        Her hands and forearms look weird, like they were drawn on later by someone else.    If this is what she'll look like in the wet-tshirt contest then bring it on right fucking now.    HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA    Thick lips; wide hips. Is she, secretly, Latina?  Like, damn girl.      Scans when?    Her head would need to be smaller.     yfw this, actually, happened in the manga    Shit artist can't into foreshortening and perspective.   He kinda fucked up on this cover, but as for the comic interiors he does a pretty great job.    No. She's looking down too.   what is perspective   Please.        Hana hana hana (we love you hana)     fuck off you autist  she's drawn with wide hips here       she could have just confessed and told him she liked him. that's what he wanted, he wanted this to not be a revenge-piss only, but nope, she had to be a cheeky cunt about it. she doesn't deserve the bowl.     Oh shut the fuck up with this shit its whiny shipper bullshit at this point, itll get there soon enough. 4 years later and they are still the only two with ridiculous sexual tension that is unmatched and the only two that even resemble a couple at all. This manga builds shit up for very long periods of time to have explosively good outcomes.    I like that he has to figure out with time that he doesnt like chiyo the way he thinks he does and hana is giving him clues instead of OMG I LOVE YOU crap you seem so accustomed to.     CHIYO!     HANAHANAHANA ANAHANAHANAH NAHANAHANAHA AHANAHANAHAN HANAHANAHANA ANAHANAHANAH NAHANAHANAHA AHANAHANAHAN           I'm not accustomed to it at all. Tsundere being cheeky and unclear about her interest is the common thing, not the opposite.    I want to fuck her so bad     same creative staff as Shirobako  I'm ready even if there's no budget    Daily reminder that you will never get disciplined by the vice-president.   BATMAAAAAN!   Does Hana like potatoes?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=87a<wbr>tHQpNtss</wbr>  [ ] Prison school Open song   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-<wbr>kF_6B4bQ</wbr>  [ ]  Prison school  End song       It's nice the boys are the ones singing the end.     threadly reminder, vp a sub. and I like that.     New chapter when and fuck scanlation political bullshit    not even a hanafag but she looks damn good here     vp a sub  There is nothing to like, tt's Andre's fault.    the anime is gonna be bad   tell me an anime that is actually good    NGE?     Tiny breasts  Disgusting.     Lain     NGE     not in the latest arc, you mongrel, from page 1. she's just following orders and enforcing rules. the orders require her to dominate, as mari commands, but she doesn't get a rise out of it. she's just utterly loyal and obedient to mari. and what does she do when she thinks she fails? she begs to get spanked. and gets sad when she doesn't get. she's a sub. and assertive, capable subs &gt; meek stuttering ones      Maybe she is a switch. Dom to men, sub to women?    She would have gotten a rise out of domming the boys. She didn't. She's a sub.     Unless the manga is ending soon this is not going to happen.    Armpits are the most erotic part of a body after all, more so if they are hairy.    Why must people be this stupid?    are you referring to the moron not getting perspective or the moron throwing a fit over a stranger on the internet not getting perspective?     Oh god I love Hana     Small breasts are the best.  Throwing a fit over a stranger on the internet is not wrong, that's the purpose of the internet in the first place, porn comes second.      both    Isn't that the girl that wanted to eat cum in her food?    I thought the purpose of the internet was to exchange porn with each other.    disappointed by them tits  also   Ski-bi dibby dib yo da dub dub between hana and kiyoshi when?        If her vagoo is a medusa, what will her anus be?    Herbal tea.    Charybdis.    I like the way you think. And mari's anything will be Scylla. Which literally means bitch.      resting place for kiyoshis' dick hopefully    Mari a best pure girl unlike the rest of sluts.     pure  literally the only one who has had sex so far.. plus it was almost rape     Im not really into flats, but Hana is alright.    I don't see anything wrong with that, semen is very nutrient, you're not gonna make any gains slurping coke.  Cowtitsfags are the worst.  Elysian Fields.        With a cute girl, that doesn't count.     mari   pure       cute girl  Psycho stalker.     Certainly purer than her perverted dad.    You would know, you've never fucked one.     shinji   based  I can be smart too.      doesn't have to be fucking watermelon udders you pedo.. but a little more sand in those bags wouldn't have hurt.    perversion=/=lack of purity a marifag wouldn't understand      recognising shinji is based  Ok, you can.    So when will we see Mari and Chiyo's mother?   Their mother is literally just an ass.    Meh. Big tits are good only with clothes on.  Inb4 she's brazilian.       What if she is cowtits with a flat ass?    couldn't get over her husband cheating on her with superior latina asswomen and locked herself in a monastery, becoming a nun. then, engaged in orgies with other nuns. and the occasional choir boy.       Inb4 she's brazilian.  inb4 she's tricked poor director with gigantic butt implants     Manga name: Ghost Writer     choir boy  I need this.     HANAAAAAA    Scan when ?    Hana?    Chiyo revealing that she's the real mastermind when? Chiyo revealing that she did it all so that the school would be able to compete with the infamous Penitentiary Academy for Boys and its boob-loving headmistress?    Where 180 at, you Utopia fuckers?    tfw it was her all along   tfw Mari and Kate were just pawns      holy fucking shit, I`m 10 pages in and already hate this trash. the guys are all betafaggots and the retarded fanservice is disgusting. jew noses and shit art.    Cool blog    Nice b8     betafaggots  M-types are the best guys.      Chiyo  Disgusting   self-incerting   baiting         Oh yeah    lolno  might be a moron or baiting or both, but lolno m-types might be tolerable, at least if they're only sex-m-types. socially sub types are unsightly.         implying that there's anything wrong with Chiyo in a non-romantic context  Chiyo is bro-tier.  And the fact that the man-hating USC President's little sister would be the first person to actually treat the boys like fellow humans is almost too convenient. Just like how she just happened to see Kiyoshi saving that baby crow.   She's a shit-tier contestant for the Kiyoshibowl, though, I'll give you that.        tfw omigawa chiaki didn't get to play hana.      socially sub types are unsightly.   implying you wouldn't date adorable Andre with normal proportions in 3D world       she's a shit tier contestant for the bowl  yes. but she's an awesome moving force for the kiyoshibowl. in the 69piss scene, the bast part (imo) was when they both cracked and hana showed her emotional part and that she wanted this to happen, not just for revenge -kiyoshi forgetting her crying a bit later is just bad writing-. and why did hana cry? because kiyoshi was crying and didn't want to proceed. and why was that? thingken of chiyo both as a foil to her manhating cunt of a sister, and as a bro to the boys and as a push for kiyoshi, chiyo is an excellent narrative tool. as a bowlwinner, not so much, so far. can change though.            lolno  Go back where you came from.     andre is sexually sub, not socially sub. socially, andre is assertive. he has a plan and goes through with it. pisses off vp to get her to massage him roughly. when risa tries to dom him, he tells her in her face she failed and guides her on how to do better. andre is socially dominant. or at least not an utter sub.         Depending on the ridiculousness of a post, some times, a ridiculous reply is necessary to get the message across.      Fine, fine,fair point. I retract my two "lolno"s and replace them with "no, you faggot".    WHAT'S HAPPENING    Hana   winner      wiener, wiener      H A N A     Hana is cute. Hana should win.   gotta admit Im not a fan of hanas flat chest. shes perfect otherwise   Man her tits used to be big.  I kinda miss the shorter, thicc hana but the more slender one with a tighter ass and perkier breasts is also great.      That's not the manga, idiot, it's a doujinshi, how can you fucking mistake that shitty art for Hiramoto's? She always had delicious small boobs.      new chapter fucking when?! oh. H A N A A N A         In fairness his art early on was pretty inconsistent on proportions and Hana HAS changed a lot    HANA ANAH NAHA AHAN       yes it does  as expected of marihaters, they're just bunch of cucksluts.     Next day or so should have spoilers, it didn't go on break    oh alright then, thank you based anon.     CUCKsluts  That word is being used as whatever, now.  Anyway, back to the issue, dedicated love between two people , can be pure, even if it involves kinky stuff. Whoring yourself for climbing the social ladder, that ain't pure though.       this is the happiest thread ever. I like it. and it is all thanks to Hana.    in fairness  Yeah, no. Hiramoto's art was never that shitty and Hana's body was never like that or similar. Not to mention that never happened in the manga in the first place.    HananaH   HANANAH   Why do I think that the fat boy in the group gonna end up with vice prez   vp ends with gakuto or as part of andre's domme harem   Jesus christ that hana fixes my erectile dysfunction.  Can I be hyped for the anime adaptation, or should I have low expectations?   Beyond low.    fuck... It really hurts since I'm a big fan of the manga.   waiting for the next chapter :)    181 tomorrow   Still no 180 from utopia      But that's a fetish    Someone should start scanlating them again so Utopia can get butthurt again. Thats the only thing that motivates them anyways.    180 was already done in a thread last week, just no one decided to clean, edit and typeset the raws    Once someone does that and posts it on websites Utopia will come with its anal pain over 'muh rights'    Hana saves.    HANA A N A         Goddamn... I want to fuck HAna so badly      GODDAMN HANA WHY ARE YOU SO  cuddable  AND  lovable ;_;      She looks like a whore.    Troll spotted   CHIYO H I Y O       J.C Staff, so eh. They are adapting Shokugeki no Soma right now which is actually legitimately good, you can always hope.       flat chest     It's also easy to make her pee.  Hana has the mind of a 8 year old, and a bladder control of a 8 year old. It's cute.      Mari is best girl, Mari is going to be the true winner of the Kiyoshi Bowl   You're a funny guy. As a marifag i dont even believe that.    Chiyo is obviously going to win    Mari isn't interested.   Koe wins. You heard it here first.   Joe rather.    Neither is the actual MC.    Joe wins Cake-chan's affection Gakuto sticks with Rube Goldberg-chan Shingo will get forgiven by Anzu Andre wants Vice-prez, but will fall for Risa eventually Kiyoshi will take  bestgirl  home           bestgirl  You cheeky motherfucker     HANA GA SAITA YO HANA GA HANA GA SAITA YO     So sad that there's no chapter 180 from Utopia.  What do you think will happen in chapter 181? Will the games begin or will it be Hana and team trying to practice? What about the boys team how is PBR-sama going to participate?     Team practice, Hana showing off to Chiyo more by being really close to Kiyoshi    Well, I don't know why that was spoilered, since we all know who that is   Is there anyone who reads this manga, because they actually enjoy it or all of you just like this anon: . Or do you read it for that exact purpose?   go away potato    It's fucking hilarious. The art style works to design situations that look and sound super serious but are actually tremendously stupid.   I swear. Hana is the ONLY time me and /a/ have had the same taste in best girl. Good on ya.   Kiyoshi will probably be freaked out, unfortunately.    Nice spotting. I'd like to read it now.    Some dude reviewing the manga complained that he hated the manga for that reason. The art didn't match it and he didn't find it funny.   I felt like he missed the entire point of the manga in the first place. It's the one thing that worries me about the anime.      Yeah but its a public area, he can't freak out too much.    yes    So he was to deal with Hana being all over him? Aw, poor baby...  I mean I could understand if he, genuinely, didn't like her, but he does like doing sexy stuff with her. Just not in public? He is just like her. They have so much in common. Even if Hana seems unpredictable...Kiyoshi would be just as unpredictable too, no? Maybe to us he isn't, because we can see his reasoning for doing things, but to the other characters...you never know what exactly he's up to.      hana literally traumatized Kiyoshi   delusional hanafags somehow think this means that they are now dating     spoiler]So no more Kiyoshi and Chiyo?    Wouldn't have happened had he not tried to peak at the girls in the bathroom.    its not like she has a lot of competition. Sure, there are cute girls like Cake-chan but the ones the protag is infatuated with Hana is by far the better option.     Nobody has said they are dating you stupid fuck.    this pic is shit, I went to gelbooru and there`s only cowtits pic of her.    chapter?    The anime is going to be shit. No matter what. The designs already look atrocious.    Designs are fine. It's just the shading.   Quick! What's the closest series in terms of comedy, art and atmosphere to Prison School?   Comedy and art One Punch Man I feel. Atmosphere is extremely different though.    I'm already reading this. I need something else though that fits the bill.    No Andre out of all the boys is the most dominant, he's also a dominant sub and vp is submissive dom(which is why andre "invested" so much into her). Now his new dom forget her name Risa I think is a dominant dom which is why she'd fail in making Andre happy because she was used to doing things her own way instead of being led or trained by Andre. If Andre was a true sub he'd be happy with whatever she'd dish out.    He's a masochist. That explains his behavior regardless of silly dom/sub conventions.    that's a very square ass    That goes without saying but to understand the relationship he has with vp and Risa you need to understand what kind of sub he is. Silly for you but the type of dom or sub you are plays a big role in the relationship.   Hana is the best. All other girls are irrelevant   I've started reading because of the artstyle, but wound up plowing through the chapters because of the plot. So yes, I enjoy it    Winner of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee sure     Not liking the bad redhead who can tie a cherry stem with her tongue.      What is that supposed to mean? Is it a slur or something?     It means she can  suck dicks very good      Oh really?What buy is she in the bowl for?     I could care less about who Kiyoshi wants to put a ring on.    Isn't she a lesbian? The "can tie a cherry stem with her tongue"-thing is something like a proof that a girl/guy is able to please their partner with oral sex.     Doesnt it mean a good kisser?     That means you do care. At least a little.     She just needs a warm d stuck inside her all night while cuddling, and she will become a good girl.     Doesnt it mean a good kisser?  That's what they tell the little kids in junior high. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VUt<wbr>DwWp17tM</wbr>  [ ]     Only retarded Hanafags dislike Chiyo.   But she didn't win anything.  Kiyoshi doesn't even like her     No mang, fuck Kiyoshi. The girls in the story, now that's what I care about. I'm telling you, Kate knows how to work that tongue. Man she can do you like ice cream cone.    I eagerly await 181.  I'm fucking hype for the cavalry battle.      Or possibly more filler     i find it funny you posted that because this adaption will be way better than that deformed shit that will happen to vampire-chan     &gt;Or possibly more filler <br/>    Chiyofags are actually this delusional.  Rooting for worst grill should be punishable by death.      That's why we need more varieties of fags. Any homies going for Kate?     He likes kissing her. He wants to kiss her Medusa. He thinks she's cute. Learn to read.    Subplots are NOT filler. Filler is when extra material is created in adaptions that have no bearing on the plot. Subplots have everything to do with the main plot and more.       Normies are all Chiyofags. No exceptions.    No wonder 3D life is so shit.    yfw it's another Gakuto and the boys chapter   Utopia posted 180.    yfw it's another punishment chapter    I'm the only one that think this chapter was beautiful? Perfectly done to get pass this shock state of Kiyoshi, now we can move on to the main story.   No, it was a very needed bromance after all that tension. Now we pick up the pace again.    HANA    I will now take bets on Hana's reaction to the PBR during the cavalry battle, and Chiyo's reaction to seeing Hana's panties (that were also in the boys' appartment).   Kiyoshibowl clinched.   Why is Hana best girl and why is it Hana?     Because Shipperfags.     Worst girl harder Chiyofag.     No-one's going to 'win', that's not what this Manga is about.     I see Reika cumeater grow and has magic pen to make guys cum on the spot now.    Is Hana is the best girl, explain why she isn't the president? Only president-tier girls are worthy of the best boy.     Both presidents are total bitches though. And they fucked each other.     I know, that's what makes them the best girls. Girls that love girls? Who doesn't like that?     /u/boat detected. Firing Depth Charges.    Are we ever going to get hi-res scans ;_;  hana is literally the worst girl, even worse than pre-dumbass vp   what's the background of this conversation? looks like a really touching moment    No, just no.   Why are  delicious lips  the best fetish?   I want a misandrist to kiss parts of me.    Come on he liked it, he's just in denial and can't accept it just yet    On another note Kakegurui has  delicious lips  as well.      tfw 95% of anime girls are ugly because bland lines for lips       andre is the most dominant, while being a dominant sub  yeah, that's what more or less my point was     back to /u/ with you  where's the gook chapter?   not standing up guy's cunt of a sister threw away his pegging porn. he was embarrassed and tried to move on, but standing up guy convinced him to embrace his perviness. then they spend an all nighter with standing up guy's friends to browse tons of porn and find the video sitting guy lost.         thanks anon, i never though pegging porn could generate so much drama    as in ps, it's not the ecchi itself that causes the drama, but a cheeky cunt that gets between the guy and his ecchi   I waited so long for this fucking chapter. I'm disappointed in the lack of pages. and hana.   what? is 181 out? or are you referring to utopia's translation of 180?     is the sister hot? because the artist of that manga draw some reallt sexy girls    Hana looks too skinny there  she has bigger boobs in the manga.      she has barely any screentime, so I'm not sure. iirc she's like a bratty, twintail hana, so totally not my thing. I realise lots of people here would like that type though.      that ass   Every fucking time     Fucking gooks, I'm dying from PS thirst here.   Codeename Kiyoshi   real name Koyoshi   WHAT      There is no character like Hana in Nana to Kaoru, at all. There's barely any character like her in most anime &amp; manga, which is what makes her so unique.    It's Kiyoshi, just a mistake.     Hmm...     I meant appearance wise, not mood wise.    Just use the wiki or something, they even show you the kanji+reading.    Perfection.    Such a snug fit.    And it wraps you up, heavenly.   Reminder that Chiyo is the purest and best girl and the only reason people like Hana is because they are disgusting fetishist freaks.    mangahere      It doesn't matter anon, there are so many Hana shippers that the author has no other choice but to make her win the bowl. If people feel disappointed or betrayed than they will not buy any more manga that he might create.    gooks sure are taking their sweet time today   i wish her tits were at least this size in the actual manga     It must be truly miserable that your main audience is a bunch of autists.      all this buttmad because bestgirl is most popular       y-you m-mad?   I expected more than this. Sad.       Chiyo is fine, she's cute and fun.  But she's ain't no Hana.      Who the fuck is anyone to say he didnt plan it out from the start?    Why would you expect more? Hanafags have been shitposting to hell and back lately.     that doujin needed a blowjob scene, the rest of the buttsex happening on panel, and a sequel    Let's be honest chiyo is a boring hoe with a weird liking for sumo and has made less progress with the MC then hana did! Chiyo is no longer of use and pure girls are always the boring type who ends up getting cheated on because their husbands becomes bored of them.   Which DD would you x?  Mai waifu   You mean mine.     Koneko     No, mine    Neither! Xenovia is best waifu   <br/>   Koneko doesn't have any D's though.    No....Mine.    But that's wrong     I never liked the D's in DxD they just look like implants from the 90's.     Left   We still have a thread use it.<br/>   It's correct.    Rias, Akeno and Irina at the same damn time.    Ross.   Serafall is best DxD    100 yen coin   not fine ass rias and sexy ass akeno  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ne8<wbr>DgiJdzCk</wbr>  [ ]     rias and rossweisse are best but rias is best   Silly rabbit, Akeno is for me.   Guys stop fighting over Akeno, her breasts are big enough for all of us.  I call dibs on Sona.    That's a negatory     It is fact.    This. Xenovia is best DXD.    Followed closely by Koneko.     asia for some reason.    This thread needs more Zenovia.      It's funny how they had to make Rossweisse a useless retard, so that she wouldn't steal the best girl status with that dynamite body.              You guys need to find yourselfs a new girl Akeno is mine             Anyone else waiting for BDs before they watch this for the first time?    Ophis.    Back the fuck out, m8. She stays with me    There can only be one.    Does she show up in the anime? I just started season 2. I don't know who she is but my penis is certainly familiar with her.    Posting best doujin   She does, she is in the 3rd season. I can't remember if she appears in season 2 though.    Eh, I've only ever read one ntr doujin that turned me on. Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot. HOW DO YOU ENJOY BEING FUCKED BY A TRUE MANS COCK INSTEAD OF HIS TINY LITTLE PECKER YOU FILTHY WHORE       Whatever, Issei impregnated his harem canon now.     Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot.  That one is even more hilarious considering it gets nothing right about DxD´s world, and the idea of a runt like Raizer ever being considered as leader of the underworld is just too funny to take seriously     in manga?   This one. After casting resurrection ofc.  And yes, M&amp;M Resurrection restores eradicated bodies.    Extra scene for the last episode in the Bds of S2 she shows up outside Issei´s house with Vali, its how they teased that S3 was going to happen.     Which DD would you x?   There is only one answer to that anon, all of them.  ALL OF  THEM except  ashy tits               Author confirmed on his blog.   http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/      I would like to bully Valkyrie. anyone else?   LNs   Only of bodies that matter. there is still no reason what so ever to bring back that pile of ashes back, specially considering that even asia can probably one shot her and turn her to ashes again        Stop being delusional   I'd like some Irina chan myself.   I would bully her by taking her to super expensive stores and buying her everything she sees    Usually, girls like Rias are my fetish, but for this show, I'm more interested in Koneko than all the others.   I love a show that has really.... eye catching eye catches.  What does it feels like?   bretty cruel mane.    Are you really asking what boobs feel like?  Boobs feels like a cantaloupe.      Bags of salty milk   Is this FAT TATS: the anime?   Pretty much    more like  ALL TATS: The anime.  the range of sizes is pretty good, even if the main focuse are big fat tats.       whichever one has the biggest DDs     Poor Sona looks so sad it's practically heartbreaking.    MAY DAY... MaY... daYy  THIS IS THE QUEEN XENOVIA      that view     Left is too yellow.    Its karma, Sona used to steal Ria's toys when they were small. But don worry Issei will give her a piece of the DxD from time to time to keep her happy     Small perky breasts are fine too.    I don't think Ishibumi is that cruel to Saji.  Otherwise we will see child who can control dragon water      Sona is great in threesomes because she balances out the girls she is usually paired with    I seriously hope not. Sona is a bitch for neglecting Saji.     Sona is a bitch for neglecting some one she never liked as anything but a brother    anon expecting her to like Saji is like expecting Rias to like Kiba.  And Saji neglects momo and twintails even harder, so i guess you dont want anyone to be happy.         why this season of dxd is so bad ? it feels like watching naruto fillers    Superior nordic girl    That's because it is fucking filler.    Saji tries so hard, but in the end, it doesn't even matter.   Rossweisse is not alone for C88, Rias getting another one. Can't post pictures because of lewd. http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51068763</wbr>   Loki ruined the anime. Fuck Loki.    becuase they decided to mesh together a bunch of arcs, and skip a couple others, so they could use the second half of the season for a shitty completly anime original filler arc that will have no fucking impact on the actual story because  LOL they wont remember anything that happened  but it will impact the audience becuase it steals the hype from some of the events that would happen in S4 if it ever gets made.     Would you let a horny cat suck your dick?   Dude Saji tries but in all the wrong ways, the mother fucker basically does backflips into the friendzone and then dives deeper and deeper into the otoutozone and puts weights around his feet just to be safe.  And its not like he doesnt have help, Issei tries to bring him up any time he is talking alone with Sona, but she has no interest at all in saji as anything but a member of her peerage.  Saji should have taken the two girls that are after his D and then get them to help him convert Sona, but instead he ignores them which in turn makes them plot agaisnt him ever getting together with sona and makes them shove issei more into sona's face so she will go after him.       https://jerutz.wordpress.com/slashd<wbr>og/</wbr>   Rias always gets a couple so thats no surprise.  lets hope the Ross one is good and not like the Irina one we got when S2 aired, the cover was pretty great and then it got scanned and it was shit.      Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.     Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.  and she grabs your hand with her tail to keep it there on her head     that explains everything  its not just him, overall new characters and the plot is weak hell i'm not watching this show for plot but god damn this level of story writing should be banned, even PLOT didnt deliver.   S4  After what i have just watched i'm not sure if want.  Also all girls are best girls Rias and Sona just happened to be my favorite             Well it isn´t totally bad, half of the season was good, we got neko sisters    Yes because it's her fault he keeps chasing her when she's never shown any interest.    That's not true.  What happened is a typical scene between two children.  one doesn't want to lend her toy. (Rias)   the other wants to play with it. (Sona)    In the end, the teddy bear's ear was torn off as they tugged on it and both cried:   Rias because the toy Sirzechs gave to her was damaged.   Sona because she was sorry for damaging the toy.             the level of fuck ups in the last 3 epiosodes overshadow the good things from the first half, hell not even the Oppai Dragon song took the shit taste off of the last episode.   yes at least we got Kuroka, and genki koneko out of it, and i guess a half assed soft Akeno  though that just pisses me off because there was no real build up or payoff either because of all the shit they skipped     Well at least now they are fighting over a much stronger teddy bear who can just fuck them both and keep them happy.           A cat is fine too.     Where is a japanese anime Gordon Ramsay when you need him  Someone needs to give a lesson to that studio     Ravel.   A cat is more than just fine.         Who still gives a fuck about this?     I do, because I find it funny.    I do, so?      it was annoying when i was a kid and funny as an adult      Does he just carry around little paper sacks in case he needs to rip someone's heart out?    I always assumed the clothe was part of the guy's shirt, it's the same color      I'm more bothered by the fact that we still don't have a proper, uncensored release of the Dragon Ball manga in English.         100 times better than black bar/fog censoring that is becoming popular.       I don't understand what is being censored     stop or i'll activate the spring to bonk him on the head    Where's the Zabuza on the floating handle. Come on guys.      at least it made sense. a chef shouldn't fucking smoke. Thats probably the least horrible censor that 4kids did.    Show me one canon scene in which Sanji has smoked while cooking.     Show me at least 20 scenes where he hasn't.     i mean in the sense that it ruins your taste buds.    Terraformars was shit, and that scene made me drop the manga completely because I realized what kind of series it was: lets job every fucking character to the nhojs to hype them up then run out of ideas.   that racist    The entirety of Tokyo Ghoul TV or Netflix.   kek    This can't be real...     It's funny because neither version is realistic.      I don't really mind her censorship. It only looks ridiculous in frames like this, and she's already an adorable busty fetish magnet even without the cleavage. I bet boys are discovering their weewees even with the edit.    Yeah, FT's manga is better, but I prefer other reasons...     It looked more violent when it was in the sac imo    Every Time There is always one who sees it and doesn't believe it.     why   I never understood why this happened, but Mammy is still on Tom and Jerry reruns.  People would be questioning a jelly donut that size, so they had to change it.     Aprons are racist because slavery.    This can be real    Is that QCDJ remix out yet?    I can believe it.     Believe it     Wasn't this during the 4kids run?   4kids ruined a lot of anime back when they were still around, it was almost impressive. What the fuck were they thinking?      BELIEVE IT    Considering she was actually redesigned in B2/W2, I wouldn't be surprised if the character designer didn't realize it was a racist caricature until the games released, and then voluntarily changed it.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K5U<wbr>fIRmkv28</wbr>  [ ]     I dont even understand why.    The heart is actually surrounded by a membrane which partitions it off from the rest of the human body. Most organs have it. I like to think Togashi knows a bit of anatomy and the bag is that membrane.    Him having the sac made no sense, the heart still beating in it and him putting it in the mans hands was fucking great    I remember the scene where he threatens some guy by pointing the sword at him, and in the German version he's just pointing the handle at him.  But how the hell did they deal with the sword being thrown into the tree in the first place?      Money.    Looks less like a cross i think. That's the best i can come up with.       Same reason they censored luffy's mouth     I get it, they went with the idea   we can censor it if we say its a see through water blade.          The idea's fine Though they completely screwed up the times         OH MY GOD I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT THEY FUCKING CENSORED LUFFY'S MOUTH BEING OPEN     When you start getting edits like this, it's proof that the censors have run out of actual things to censor and are just trying to fill up their 8-hour work day at this point.     I'm sorry, what?        The idea's fine  Explain it to me       Yes, now what did it look like then he threw the sword and it lodged itself in the tree?    why did they change it?      What the everlasting fuck?  WHY?      They changed Japan's 24-hour clock to the US 12-hour one. That honestly isn't so bad if you consider that American kids may not understand how Japanese clocks work.  But they screwed it up in that 19:00 should be around 8 pm.     Why? For what purpose?       French chefs smoke all the time. Sanji's supposed to be "french"      8   I meant 7, fuck     Oh god Yu-gi-oh replacing all the guns with pointing fingers was hilarious.     There are people here who don't realize that the sack came from the guy's shirt when Killua tore his arm through his chest        Japanese clocks  I live in Mexico and I always used a 24h format     My sides    That's just cruel. What if he needs to poop?  Also, speaking of cruel...       I wish someone would create a series of videos showing both the original version with subtitles but no sound and the censored localized version with audio at the same time for things like Yugi-Oh. It'd be great to compare episodes with everything side by side like that.     It's because 4kids also brings their shows to other countries. Rather than translate for every language, they just remove the text to make things easier.    Well, I just used 'japanese' because that's what the original's from. A lot of other countries use it too. But the US doesn't, so the change is necessary.        Huh, making the cigerrette look like a lollipop, thats kind of clever. Stupid and not necessary, but clever.    WHY    I thought everyone in Yu-Gi-Oh just had a spirit gun when they pointed their fingers    I... I don't get it. Why?     it's called military time or 24 hour clock   so the change is necessary   no it's not         what what why?    What was the point of that ?    why?    My god, that blue color is an eyesore.    Jews    Maybe not necessary, but it's helpful for young children. Which is the main audience.  And yes, I know what it's called.     I think most of the confusion comes from the size of the piece of cloth, given that it's big enough to hold his heart completely. Sure, some of the surrounding cloth was clearly pushed into the cavity, but it still seems a little small.   Left is original   It's not necessary, in school when they teach you how to read a clock they teach you both ways    Weren't they even called contests in that generation's games?     The fuck     I refuse to believe this is real.      They didn't teach it at my school. Then again I grew up in some country town in the middle of nowhere.     ellipses are ominous, I don't blame them    That's it...they got ran out of stuff to censor and got bored. It's the only explanation...    The former happened in the initial Japanese broadcast. The latter was changed by Japan for international and Japanese DVD releases.    Do pokeballs trigger people now? I don't get it.    The only thing I can think of with shit like this is that they weren't just censoring or localizing, they were making it full-on completely generic. Completely stripping the show of as much identity as possible so no one could possibly be offended by anything. No language, no logos, nothing.    I don't see any difference      Whats this from, some mudslime country?    Pokeball -&gt; clam -&gt; vagina -&gt; some devillish stuff. That's the way censors brains work    no wonder why i hesitated to pick up this series when it first aired    For what fucking purpose?    If I remember right, he jumps onto Pegasus' platform and demands that he give him the prize money right there.  Even as a kid, I remember thinking that scene was weird as shit. He didn't have anything to threaten him with.      My guess is that it have something to do with advertising laws. Yu-Gi-Oh can't have the back of the cards like real life because for some reason you can't advert real products in your japanese cartoons without paying royalties.     Honestly, I think the jelly donut thing was a genuine mistake. They really didn't have much to work with back then, so it was all translated up front. So they see what ends up being a rice ball, but it's filled with what looks like raspberry jelly or something, with what might be coconut shavings on the outside.   4kids comes up a lot in these threads but their edition of Zorc was on another level.  There are parts where the edit is so shitty his torso is just an indistinct dark haze with a dragon poking out     same here I was always thinking wtf was he going to do with that finger.    What, are there like licensing issues with pokeballs?  Were they worried that featuring their stylised likeness in anyway apart from actual pokeballs would contravene some condition about advertising in the show?  That I could kinda see, the networks not wanting to have the stigma of it being a full-on merchandise advertisement, so they have to cut out/edit stuff that could be construed as merchandise - change the logo and 'branded pen' becomes 'generic pen' and everything's fine.       to be honest that just looked like a huge dragon dick.    So far this is the only "done right", that is just a dragon strap on      That's pretty obviously why they did it.  It doesn't change how retarded it looks.      no he's from Boston   what about this?     This is about direct censorship, not people trying to cover their asses legally.    I'm amazed Konami even did that for Elemental Recharge.    Did they... remove her breasts?      I'll give you a hint: what's black and white and actually large enough to split between the four of them?    She wasn't supposed to look pretty in that.   In any case anime fucked up      My dick?      Wasn't this because his smaller self drank beer, but they made it orange along with him so it'd be like his thing?    Hher name in my country means "Blowjob"    No, but it is jelly-filled.    Arc-V is going to looks like shit if this happens.     And then run out of ideas   The anime was shit. However, if you're not at least keeping up with it, you're missing out.      For fucks sake Did display;none drop it or what?     Nah, Next volume release from them soon. Should catch up to just around that image before we have to wait on 14 to release in Japan.     Roaches in nice suits  Player Haters. Middle roach is Silky Johnson, Buck Nasty in the back.       DON'T CHEW WITH YOUR MOUTH OPEN KIDS      Are laser guns somehow less offensive than actual guns? Unless they're all playing a rousing game of laser tag it would kill all the same.     No bullets, no blood.     I'm thinking that's the only logical reason, but they got the rights to dub the show and there are TONS of Pokeballs in it.     To be fair, a single saltine is a lot more pathetic to be down to than a whole onigiri ball.      and that name is?    in america every family has loaded handguns in every draw. if you show characters shooting each other kids will imitate with the handgun their mother got them for christmas     The fuck am I looking at?    95% of chefs smoke like chimneys. The other 5% do coke off the prep tables where they make your food.     real footage of Robert Johnson and Son House        Tearju molestation sequence in TLR Darkness     What is this even supposed to be?    It's not.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kDy<wbr>B91YRRCQ</wbr>  [ ] 15:10       Honestly it was just a localization. In the US we count times 1-12, am or pm. We don't usually do 13:00 or higher to denote time.      WOW IT'S FUCKING NOTHING   LASER  CHAINSAW      Five Nights at Freddy's     HOW CAN I HELP YOU KING DEDEDE? I NEED A LASER CHAINSAW TO ????? THAT THERE KIRBY.     Americans are retarded  More news at 11     We had one gun in my house and my dad was pretty serious about it. I never actually saw him use it even once, he kept the gun and ammo in separate locations, and I didn't even know where the shit was. So no, all american parents aren't retarded white trash who take pictures of their babies holding guns and put them on facebook.    Man, it was awkward as fuck when suddenly all the laser guns turned into real guns and there was blood everywhere.  Those last ~5 episodes of the run were a trip and a half.      Picking this back up now    Who knows. There were a ton of action cartoons in the 90s where everyone had lasers and blasters. It blew my mind when I learned that ki effects in the Ocean dub of DBZ had laser sound effects.    your house still had a gun in it and i bet if you cared enough you could have found and loaded it how many pakistani houses have police grade batons in them do you think     I guess it was  too edgy for them     go home carlos you're drunk    Wow... they really had to get creative.    Yeah. They were doing that in the 90s, early 2000s.  Now consider that they're still incapable of doing typesetting in 2015.      Urmum        ... for nothing why     What's that blue bar?    I remember when the show debuted on toonami and in the ED which was random screenshots next to the credits, there was a shot of her with her uncensored tits. And then in the next episode her rack got cut off. Made me realized censors existed.    Covering the tip of tue penis    Toonami   not exactly a censor, but...  When Pikachu is repeatedly shocking Ash to try to bring him back to life, Misty says "Pikachu…" in the Japanese version, and "Please, no…" in the English version. A commentary revealed that the dubbers had many alternatives for this piece of dialogue, one of them being "My bike…"     The only time Gundam Seed was entertaining.      a spring loaded hammer with force behind it to fire a bullet isn't more dangerous than a Pirate era gun  the Hammer will probably crack open their head       "My bike..."  Holy shit if they used that instead I would have still cried during that scene  from laughing of course  yes I cried a bit during that scene I'll admit it        art    has art gone too far?    Why?    Some dubs like to change the name of the characters    That's because Togashi can't draw for shit.    the single saltine cracker is so much better for the comedy      They improved her.     Five Nights at freddy's   Initial release date: August 8, 2014   Death-Toy's appear in the Arc-V Anime   May 11, 2014        Everyone did. No need to be ashamed.    He just made a comparison to the recent teasers, jeez     Latest Five Nights at Freddys teaser   June 25, 2015   Death-Toy's appear in the Arc-V Anime   May 11, 2014        I didn't. Not even trying to sound edgy, I was just really fucking confused. Why did Ash think it was a good idea to run inbetween the beams?   Why did he turn to stone?      Again, just a comparison. Nobody said they were connected.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  This isn't real right?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  where do i find the uncensored version   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  dick, but no nipple     I still think it's a good idea   He make his lollipops every day.       Hey fuck you, buddy. That theme song was amazing.    What are you a puff?    Fucking dying    Fucking this, man Delicious flatchest &gt; Disgusting cowtits      Why has no one answered  Why was luffys mouth editededed       That doesn't make any sense considering they'd have to pay an homeless guy from the street to photoshop all the shit away.    putting the heart on that nigga´s hand is fucking brutal     4kids turns cigarettes into lollipops and other faggotry    "100 times better than 'please buy the BD's' broadcast censorship"  Dumbest thing I've read all week.      Naruto actually got cut so it'll run on german TV - but they didn't just cut out like alot, the dub is horrible. For example no character will use the word "kill" - they use "I want/need to beat him" instead. Bad words like "dumbass" or "son of a bitch" got replaced with "bad person" or something like that.  It's for the kids man.        That's not even the worse thing that happened. In an episode, she turned into the girl in the pink dress and had giant tits, this was NOT censored in the dub, so I have no idea what the hell was going on.       http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>6r3p4_yugioh-every-pegasus-desu_tec<wbr>h Japanese Pegasus is the gayest thing ever </wbr></wbr>       It's a mystery to everyone.     You know, this change would have at least made sense if they played up Devil Fruit user's weakness to water.  Which would have been the least problematic plot hole they'd dig.       This is why you should just wait for the Blu-Ray release   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  I think for elevens seeing a little boy dick isn't a big deal, it's like seeing a naked baby.    Oh God, I remember when the episode aired, and everyone was just lost.   We're taking away this little girls tits   But it's totally fine if she transforms into the other little girl, and has gigantic tits.        At least the BDs actually are uncensored. 4kids only released cut versions.    That did seem off to me at the time. I never knew. Same thing when Gin cut Hiyori in half.     Are there even rips of the 4kids censored versions?     Post the Erza torture scene comparison.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  Baleeted lol   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  Help! What's in this?!    bomb one is best    Sandwiches cant roll and stay together like that    Little boy cock.    Holy shit Kaoru Mori.    The 12 hour clock is disgusting and should be banned.    I like those thread: they always show clearly that localizations, especially murrican and german ones, are from the mind of the devil. People who make these will go to hell. People who say that localized versions are better will go to the extra-agonizing hell.       hello where are the burgers :DDD     So im actually better than some mangaka, impressive    id rather link it  https://www.sankakucomplex.com/2015<wbr>/06/22/fairy-tail-manga-vs-anime-di<wbr>sgracefully-undisgraceful/</wbr></wbr>       Jetix  Oh man that was my shit back in the day     It's because they're paid per edit, so if it's remotely possible to provide any justification whatsoever, no matter how ass backwards it may be, then they do it.   not really censorship just fucking comedy gold.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d8x<wbr>oTBZrzko</wbr>  [ ]   Sausookay he's really cool.        Wait a min, the 1999 ver I watched clearly had him holding the ripped out heart Did they censor it outside of japan or something?     The anime gives me a boner The manga doesn't So the anime is clearly superior      Why is a West African singing the German OP?    Even the original anime was toned down compared to the manga.    and why is more than half it in english? Nobody knows the german will always be a hilarious mystery.      HunterxHunter got remade.      A Southeast Asian country? The blurs make it look more lewd.     i thought it was his ball sack at first when i first watched it     The German version looks like he's threatening you with something he uses on Haku.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d8x<wbr>oTBZrzko</wbr>  [ ]  Believe it.       FNaF confirmed for copying the idea from YGO     proof it.   I will like to bring up the Studio Mir edits of Doraemon that aired on Disney XD US as well.   So why didn't you?       The did that with Naruto too. The accidental first kiss was censored in the anime itself, but allowed to exist in the ending credit montage.     Okay, what's the point in this? You can't show robot being hurt?    That changes the context entirely. Surely it must have been pretty fucking strange to watch something which originally preceded going through a first aid kit to eating a fucking pizza.   Hilarious.       I imagine it's probably for the same reason they tried to turn Shaoran into the MC for Cardcaptors way back when. Contest has a more feminine connotation, ie beauty contest, whereas competition sounds more athletic.     OH MY GOD    I haven't played a Pokémon game since Silver. Is there even a petrification skill in the games?     Actual dragon dildos in YuGiOh. That's fantastic.      Laser gun censorship doesn't bother me at all. Gun violence is imitable in the US, unlike in Japan. Plus, it's fucking Gundam, why not have laser guns?      Japanese clocks  It's the fucking international standard everywhere in the world except for contrarian America.     No way that is real.     I guess this just confirms the theory that 4kids can't show excessive merchandizing in a show based off merchandise.      A M E R I F A T M E R I F A T             "My bike…"  Would've been fucking amazing.     I still don't get why make a new OP... and then have lyrics in japanese in it anyway.     Not knowing about the amazing healing properties of pizza.     Looks like he's giving an invisible robot a hand job.  Except its cock isn't invisible.      that's is just being lazy as fuck    10/10    I loved that the Japanese pronunciation stayed exactly the same for shit like this.     pizza   what       Censored Doraemon   I will never understand this      The apronless version is also on the Japanese DVDs and reruns. It's not a case of the west censoring shit, she was an archaeologist so the apron made sense, Japan just didn't want people to flip their shit.     Outing him as a cheater, maybe?  Sure he was cheating too, but Pegasus was most definitely a cheater.         Togashi doesn't even have furniture except for that stool, apparently.    Why not just a burkha?    Considering he's married, I doubt it.    It was probably you can't show the kids it's ok to go through the first aid kit and treat themselves without letting their parents know    Now that I think of it, it's no wonder he's always sick. He lives like a fucking slob    I wonder if Shonen Jump fired the editor and managers who offered that lazy bum tenure?  Meanwhile, OdaKing has been working his ass off for 18+ years. If anyone has earned a rest it's him.      If One Piece wasn't absolute shite, sure.    something something inside joke something      Evolutionary deadends should just stay out of the way.      Uchiha Psycho   A limited Lemonsoda that they're selling right now   Was somone from /a/ censoring that?     things that didn't really happen     CARLOS!!    CONTEXT POST  Nobita was a vampire at this point, and the cross bandage Doraemon had caused him to get pain. Since religious references in western series is taboo, the cross was changed to a garlic pizza. CONTEXT POST       I feel bad for Arab countries, I really do. Here they are, trying to keep a tightly run, family-oriented, religious society, but they're not going to be able to keep foreign influence out; the entertainment value of glorious Indonesian cartoons, for example, is too great.  Fighting it like that is pointless. Rather than try to control what people see, they should seek to "control" how people relate to and value what they see, through education. But that will only work if you have an engaged and motivated population who value their society and culture.      Yea it's gay. Fuck US media corporations and all...  but seriously... a ball of white rice with a little piece of seaweed? That's food to Nips?      its usually filled with something, a plum, tuna, all sorts of stuff, plus the rice is soft and sweet   I had no idea of anime censorship till I got the internet back in the mid 90s. When I start surfing on geocitie DBZ fan sites. I would see comparison screen caps how much was changed. Even seeing Vegeta giving the finger.  You had no idea how dope that was as a teenager in the 90s.     That's actually a pretty funny edit.    I Like it. it seem pretty much in-universe to have that.     Nip flag to US stripe? That's about as far as my imagination can take it.    Future anime to censor  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vPz<wbr>yr4mo1c8</wbr>  [ ]     They're paid based on how much they change.    that's not so bad    How is it racist    Every cheif I've worked with has been a drunk chainsmoking drug addict.

On my first day as an apprentice, my Chef said "All Chefs are either gay or addicts, which are you?"     https://<span>youtu.be/upHaMuO4g6c?t=138  [ ] This shit gets me every time.     This post has to be a joke   censorship doesn't bother me at all      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  I'm not sure if this is real. Ash is too old by anime standards to get away with shotadick.    That whole scene in german was the epitome of autism. They literally removed all the bodies and switched out the word "killed" with "abducted" (which they always did). So this scene was Sasuke hysterically running through an empty village just to find his brother and talk with him about how he abducted every villager.

The series still running over there? i wonder what they'll do with Rebecca.     It's not real, especially the ones after the first season, since at that point they were making the anime for international audiences and they had a list of things that they were explicitly not allowed to do, nudity being one of them.

Bottom Left      What happens if you take away Momo's plush toy?   Would you an elf /a/?  I would    The source material us not enough.     6, 7, 8.   It's enough now. And considering the content, 13 episodes would not be enough.     They already adapt 5 volumes. Dropped into three is weird moves. Why do you think 3 volume is enough and the 8th volume ending is fit for the 2nd season ending?     Akihabara.    Does anybody have a version with all the fucky lines connected?  With S2 finished and the latest volume of LN newly published, it't our time to sort out these three girls into the Hachiman Standard Classification of Girls   Genuine   Fairy-tale   Replica        If anything I'd say having to cherrypick 4 shots from the same scene when they spent the entire episode on a date says that Yukino got jack shit this episode. Hell, it doesn't even look like they're getting even remotely intimate.  I'm starting to think these scenes really have nothing to do with Yukino and 8man's relationship, and are actually about showing how Yui's insecurities, lack of trust, and general negative emotions affects her perception of their interactions on a regular basis.       Marry Fuck Kill       No    Maybe    Give me your adress   A lovely cat and a lovely  Precure Thread !   Only for Souta.   Honoka is really cute.   She sure is.   It's a shame Toei rehashed so many designs from FW when they made SS. When you get past that it's pretty good and has a deal enough to set it apart from its comparative.   I'm sure if the MC and fairy designs were different then more people would give this season a chance.      The fairies looked different enough.     7 days   7 volumes   Tonight, the forgotten fight on.          And that's exactly what they did. Make two giant bakemono housing a ton of yokai in it's body. Ridiculous.         </blockquote>]
