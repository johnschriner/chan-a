[ Am I the only one who liked the first episode?<br><br> "too much nationalism" <br>lol, the only people who say that have racial hatred towards Japan.</br></br></br>  It was alright, could've been a bit better  tbh I'm only watching for the monster girls  <br>"Japan will handle it! America will assist!"<br><br>Not a chance in hell. If a portal to another dimension opened in the middle of fucking Buckingham Palace the US government would still be the only ones dealing with that shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Was pretty boring, didn't finish it.</br>  It is too nationalist. What you're seeing is a toned down version of a toned down version.  Is GATE worthy of being called SAO of the season? Danmachi turned out pretty shit.  So this is all MC guys imagination right?<br><br>He hit his head and suddenly the world is an otaku fantasy.</br></br>  <br>Just ignore the butthurt burgerfags.<br>It's pretty okay to me. And it will be 2 cour. <br>It's something to look forward every saturday morning.</br></br></br>  <br>No, this is just a JSDF recruitment propaganda.</br>  <br>If its to nationalistic then what would your answer be to an invading army from another dimension?</br>  <br>I'm still buttblasted by how so much thing happened and still felt like no development at all.</br>  <br>More like Japan has nothing to be proud of and similarly nothing to boast about as a pseudo-protectorate. When the JSDF remains an ALLOWANCE of the United States, what ground do they to stand on?<br><br>The nationalism is silly because almost any other military power on the planet would be more appropraite in this situation. The U.S. fits best if only because you'd expect shit like this at this point, with the inclusion they actually have the capacity to fuck shit up and ensure it remains their own sole resource.</br></br></br>  <br> nothing to be proud of <br><br>Wow, Americans really are retarded. I guess that's to be expected of a country with zero history.</br></br></br>  <br>Why should I watch this instead of reading Stuart Slade's Apocalypse Wars?</br>  <br>wow</br>  <br> their own sole resource <br>At least until they outsource that shit like any nation would end up doing.</br></br>  <br><br> Buttmad weeb detected </br></br>   Chinks <br> Gooks </br>  <br>Not him, but seriously what's Japan got? A declining birthrate and a fantastic suicide rate.</br>  Are we going to have this shit the entire season?  <br>Yeah, sorry about that, we just became a superpower too fast, do you want us to slow down so you can catch up?</br>  <br>Get back in line Euro!<br><br>Americans saved your asses (twice) from the Germans. We held the frontline between you and the red swarm. Today we are all that stands between you and a world where Russia fucks over Ukraine and fucks over the rest of Europe.<br><br>Unfortunately America is not doing more.<br><br>Obama is a cowardly, snivelling, appeasing socialist. Great so we have gay marriage now?<br><br>Meanwhile China wants to swamp Phillippines, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.<br><br>It's time to get tough and act tough.<br><br>Americans need to vote Rick Santorum next election then bye bye China.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The episode was entertaining.<br>But as a guy in the other thread said.<br>IT could have been so much better it leave me with a bitter taste.</br></br>  <br>Most likely</br>  <br><br><br><br>Happy Fourth of July my triple figure kg friends</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This is what retards actually believe.</br></br>    <br> too much nationalism <br><br>I don't get it, the gate opened in nipland, only natural it's their shit now.<br><br>They also only killed those invaders because they had firearms and even then they had shittons of civilian casualties prior to the military arriving.<br><br>I also didn't see any Americans die, and I didn't see any katanas. If the MC does however whip out a katana and kill an ogre or some shit one on one then I'll say it's nationalist shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not sure if serious or just American.</br></br>  <br><br> Get rekt <br> f-fatties! <br><br>noice.</br></br></br></br></br>   President of the USA speaking Japanese <br><br>Is it really that hard to have some guy read engrish and sub it? <br><br>It kills my immersion</br></br></br></br>  <br>I fully expected this back when the manga was being released. At this point, either you just shut down your brain and enjoy the ride, or just avoid the threads all-together.</br>  <br>Let's let America leave Europe.<br><br>Overnight, the Russians will be in backyard. He will be stealing your money, he will be raping your women.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and what is boasted about most in GATE? Weeb culture and the illusion that Japan is a serious contendor on the world stage. Maybe in fantasyland.</br>  <br> lol, <br><br><br> tbh <br><br>Fucking gatefags</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> taking anything said in a "Nationalism: The Anime" thread seriously <br><br>These are just lessons in advanced baiting, anon</br></br></br>  <br>I'm in the US Infantry.<br><br>I liked it. It gave me the feels as its playing with my childhood fantasies.<br><br>Though id prefer if it were muv luv beta on the other side.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> More like Japan has nothing to be proud of <br><br>And US army does?<br><br>A tremendous failure in Vietnam. A tremendous failure in Iran. A tremendous failure in Mogadishu. A pathetic pseudo victory in Afghanistan ruined by incompetence (fucking Tora Bora). A tremendous failure in Iraq. <br><br>Wow, what an amazing fighting force.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Last time America tried to do that The Master wrecked the president.</br>  <br>Basically this. I'm convinced this show is being trolled my koreans and libtards that hate anything military oriented</br>  <br>Just your average butthurt Republican. I mean, what else can they do? Donald fucking Trump is currently their second best presidential candidate. It's sad to see them end up like this.</br>   4 months to do something <br> small army force <br>Japan, wtf are you doing?</br></br>  <br> lol, the only people who say that have racial hatred towards Japan. <br>it gets worse, much much worse</br></br>  <br> Russia fucks over Ukraine and fucks over the rest of Europe <br><br>You are absolutely fucking retarded if you think that Russia can take Europe.</br></br></br>  <br> lol </br>  <br>America will wake up soon enough. They are beginning to see the disastrous results of Obama's appeasement. The Conservative Backlash is just beginning.</br>  <br> wtf <br>Where do you people come from?</br></br>  <br>This thread is 40% /int/</br>  <br>also to addon there are many weeboos in the US military and they are open about it.<br><br>You don't get hazed unless your a weak ass lazy faggot who doesn't take his job seriously.<br><br>So if anyone thinks its unreal for an "Otaku" to be in the military its not</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Total Eclipse is shit. Decent continuation of Alternative never. Long-term effects of Original Hive getting destroyed will never be shown.</br>  <br>At least we are not afraid to fight wars.<br>You win some you lose some and learn about it.</br></br>  <br><br>How bad? This thread has tickled my curiosity.</br></br>  <br> romance subplot about the god-loli and mc <br>I guess it's just as  said that she wants the D and he got no interest at all, right?</br></br>  <br>People whining about Japanase nacionalism in this are as just retarded as those who whine about nationalism in Stargate. (And I'm European BTW). <br><br>I liked first episode, need to see more if I can be sure if I will really like it.</br></br></br>  <br>From beyond the gate, newfag.</br>  <br>It's called TSFiA</br>  <br>Not unrealistic at all. Getting a unit ready for deployment takes that long.<br><br>Its all about paper work these day. What do you think we live in the USSR?</br></br></br>   whole world has to deal with retarded burger nationalism in movies <br> when real US Army can't beat fucking goat fuckers with 30 years old rifles <br><br>And you autists throw a fit when nips put some nationalism in their cartoon. <br><br>Can't wait for hot spring episode.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SAS, seals, chinese special forces fight the JSDF at the same time and the nips win</br>  <br>Not particularly bad, there dumb moments unquestionably but it's not quite as much of a political wankfest as shitposters would make you think.</br>  <br>Nice try fitting in faggot</br>  <br>Defeated the Nasties<br>Defeated the Soviet Union<br>On our way to defeating Russia, China and her cabal of lackeys.<br><br>Hong Kong and Ukraine is yearning for freedom. We will break those chains.</br></br></br></br></br>  I hear the WN is a true nippon banzai shit. Is this true? Does anyone have any summaries of them?  It is ok i think, but nothing really interesting or exciting so far except you like real military things, Gangsta still the winner of best first episode for me  <br><br>That's not what happens.</br></br>  Catgirls, bunnies and dragontits when?  <br> &gt;whole world has to deal with retarded burger nationalism in movies <br> &gt;when real US Army can't beat fucking goat fuckers with 30 years old rifles <br><br>Since your just mentioning the ARMY branch<br><br> <br>Most of the whole world doesn't care about civilian casualties.<br><br>that being said go fuck your self.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not this episode dumbfuck, the source material. Everyone hopes the full-retard nationalism gets toned down to almost nothing in the anime.</br>  <br> on our way to defeating russia, china <br><br>Claiming victory in wars that haven't even happened yet</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Jesus, why is everybody surprised about Nationalism if any other people aside from their country does it?</br>  You don't have to be American to be disgusted by this<br>Anyone who has read the manga and has gone through the terrible experience of talking with Japanese right-wingers and knows the plans of Abe's government of pushing for the remilitarization of Japan should know already</br>  <br> Can't wait for hot spring episode. <br><br>They'll probably tone it down to assassins of nondescript nationalities.</br></br></br>  I asked before, but the thread died before I got a real answer.<br>Is there any amount of romance that surpasses bitched wanting the conqueror dick?</br>  <br> Defeated the Nazis <br>Russians did 70% of the work m8</br></br>  <br> China <br>China will be dealt with by Japan once Abe tears apart Article 9 and the Japanese Navy gets their real aircraft carriers with Super Hornets on them, sold to them on discount by the USN.</br></br>  <br>Cry more, you impotent Teafaggot.</br>  <br>well the nips had a demon goth loli with a giant axe, so it was hardly fair</br>  <br> Super Hornets <br>Yes please, none of that F-35 bullshit. Even shittier than the F-16</br></br>  <br>I'm not surprised you tard, I'm wondering if the later versions are actually toned down.</br>  <br> Defeated the Nasties <br> Defeated the Soviet Union <br> On our way to defeating Russia, China and her cabal of lackeys. <br>This is bait, right? You're not actually retarded, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> fight the JSDF <br>But that's wrong you faggot, they were fighting eachother while a demi god was also slaughtering them with a giant magical axe.</br></br>  <br>I agree that wasn't any nationalism in the first episode. That's all to come. However ...<br><br>  Awful animation, obviously all the budget was spent on the military vehicles &amp; weapons. <br>  Character designs look shit. What we've seen of the girls so far is not good.  <br>  Violence was almost completely absent. The only person we actually saw killed was a nigger, everything else was a cut-away or obscured. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Clock is ticking if you have not heard.<br><br>China's economy is on the brink of collapse along with the Demographic bomb on the way. Russia has tied itself to China. We now have them in our sights.<br><br>When China falls, Democracy will be victorious, America will be victorious.<br><br>WE will stand over their bodies just as we stood over the body of the Soviet Union because democracy, capitalism and our way of life will once more be established as the only way to live.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> China will be dealt with by Japan once Abe tears apart Article 9 and the Japanese Navy gets their real aircraft carriers with Super Hornets on them, sold to them on discount by the USN. <br><br>Sounds epic. Just like a repeat of WWII. <br><br>Bunch of old men telling kids to die for their riches while fucking all the young qts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not before tearing yourself apart<br><br><br>He got an editor, so it did</br></br></br></br>  <br>.. which promptly get sunk by superior enemy submarines</br>  <br>the russians shit the bed in afghanistan too, occupying the middle east is just difficult for anyone<br>any war between major powers is going to come down to air superiority or nuke subs if shit really gets serious, and the americans have that shit on lock(for now)</br></br>  <br> Decent continuation of Alternative never. <br>All things come to an end, even the good ones.<br><br> Long-term effects of Original Hive getting destroyed will never be shown. <br>Humanity gaining another 15 years to fight on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds good but Abe needs America's help. No he needs America's help which is why he is advocating for China fucker TTP and closer relations with America. <br><br>Abe know like you should know that America is the only thing standing between you and a world dominated by China and her buddy Russia.</br></br></br>  <br> lol, the only people who say that have racial hatred towards Japan. <br>g8 b8</br></br>  <br> When China falls, Democracy will be victorious <br><br>Silly anon, the next Dynasty is just around the corner, and this time...the takeout menu would be  WONTON DESTRUCTION </br></br></br>  <br>Nice chink propaganda on those undetectable non-existent subs</br>  <br> chink subs <br> standing a chance against Japan's DDH and American RADAR systems <br>You can't even nuke Japan thanks to AEGIS.</br></br></br>  <br> and her buddy Russia <br><br>yeah<br><br><br>okay</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except how is that fair? Every nation who has assisted the U.S. in those wars got their shit kicked in as well, and the Middle East has been known for fending off invading armies for forever. It was America now, the Soviets before, etc. it's a lost cause that dumbfuck politicians and the dumbfuck population just can't seem to understand.<br><br>Vietnam I'll give you without any arguement, though.</br></br></br>   China <br> war with America <br>Ha, like they would even dare</br></br>  <br>The WN is a bit crazy. It ends on a bad note for everyone.</br>  <br>America will stand ready to fight just as it has always stood ready to fight against all the Enemies of Freedom.<br><br>With our Conservative Allies in Australia, Japan and India we will take a stand.<br><br>A Golden era of Conservatism is about to begin like the Golden Era of Thatcher-Reagan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know it's not unrealistic for NATO/JSDF, army anon the other day was telling IRL it would take them even more, but still.</br>  <br>Why 15? BETA can't send more hives onto Earth because defense system, they could just take it easy eliminating the remaining ones.</br>  <br> Japan working together with america after militarizing <br>please. if the nationalists won in japan, they'd cut all ties with the states if not outright declare war on them again</br></br>  <br> mfw this illiterate retard will never know what Bretton Woods and US Military mean to the world. <br><br>USA is basically winning constantly since 1900s.</br></br></br>  In Hollywood action movies you always get this white American (ex-)military soldier who somehow guns down an entire terrorist organization on his own (oh, and a little help from the nerd guy and the love interest who becomes a damsel in distress at the end, I guess) and no one bitches about those. Why do people only complain about a country making themselves look good in tv shows/movies when Japan does it?  I wonder what happens if the gate opens in a random third world shithole?  <br> Sounds good but Abe needs America's help. No he needs America's help which is why he is advocating for China fucker TTP and closer relations with America.  <br> Abe know like you should know that America is the only thing standing between you and a world dominated by China and her buddy Russia. <br><br> Wants to take out China for losing WWII. &gt;Asks Master America to help you.  <br> Won't start a war without America saying yes <br> Can't 1v1 China.  <br> Can't even 1v1 S.Korea <br><br>Alpha as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Investigation and making a plan.<br>It is only stupid Chinese and Russian to go to hell soon.</br></br>  <br> he doesn't know America wants Japan to be independent so that America doesn't have to send their army to defend Japan <br>Japan's self defense shit hurts America more than it hurts Japan.</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed it, it made sense, political shit, extra recruiting and training of special forces, recon/scouting and not to mention quarantining the gate and area, would all take time. Overall I'm looking forward to next weeks episode</br>    <br>Yes, why not.</br>  <br> what if there's a portal to savage medieval tribes so we fuggin strong and be enlightened  <br>The idea is too general. Just like other anime tho.</br></br>  <br>Get invaded by China claiming its their ancestral land or "assisted" by America on dealing with a foreign threat, then gets fucked over</br>  <br>Russia is China's ally. Not our friend.<br><br>They intend to destroy European freedom just as China intends to destroy the Freedom of Asia.<br><br>Which is why America now more then ever needs a Republican President and triple military spending in order to fend off the threat from Russia and China.<br><br>The world is looking to America for leadership and America has gone to it's tent like Achilles.<br><br>Then is a silver lining, eventually Achilles will come out of that tent in vengeance.<br><br>When that day comes, Russia and China better be ready.<br><br>God bless America.<br><br>Happy 4th of July.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, you are right.<br>USA would INVADE any country with a portal to another dimension.</br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to find a person who speaks proper american in Japan.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RrZ<wbr>lWw8Di10</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Burgerlanders are so damn retarded, too much nationalism? Japan doesn't have the right to be proud of themselves, only America?<br>Please, there are countless "America was the superhero of World War" shit everywhere in the global media, when they are the newfags of war, born with golden spoons up their asses.<br>Even if something were to portray them as evil as Hitler is, that would just be another depiction. The fuck do you guys even care?</br></br>   This murrican butthurt knowing everyone in the world united against them <br>Without flags no one scared of you fatties.</br>  <br>Because big Hollywood action films happened during the Cold War, and were rightfully associated with American Pride and being a mnaly man. It's ingrained into pretty much everyone that it's normal.</br>  <br> A Golden era of Conservatism is about to begin like the Golden Era of Thatcher-Reagan. <br><br> Thatcher <br><br>Surrendered Hong Kong when she didn't have to. (I'm pissed about this since I'm from HK)<br><br> Reagan <br><br>The start of backfiring Middle East politics. OBL et al. were CIA trained and equipped. <br><br>Pretty unrealistic anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean by "ends on a bad note for everyone"?</br>  <br>The world is more united against Islamofascists, Russia and China then they are against America.<br><br>America is the Shield and Sword.</br></br></br>  <br>Good attempt, I'm sure you fooled a couple people.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera<wbr>tion_Cottage</wbr></br></br>  <br>Can confirm this. Even a basic military drill causes almost a year of planning. That's why we employ game theorists and make dozens of plans for every kind of situation. Making an army move is incredibly hard without a dictatorship like command structure.</br>  <br> Without flags no one scared of you fatties. <br>What does that even mean?</br></br>  Americans think Code Geass is nationalistic too, while britains enjoy it.<br>Ignore idiots and have fun.</br>  <br>Fuck you Jap fag. God bless America.</br>  <br> As a result of the brief engagement between U.S. and Canadian forces, there were 28 American dead as well as four Canadian dead <br>rekt</br></br>  <br> Implying their main target is not murrica </br>  <br> Danmachi was built for a second season </br>  <br>We can all cherrypick various military blunders. Everybody has them and everybody has great successes.<br><br>It's like bashing the French for losing so early in WW2 but if it wasn't for their rear guard for Britain in the retreat. Britain would have also been fucked over really hard.<br><br>I say this as an American, without France we would have been fucked against Germany because Britain would have fell hard.<br><br><br><br><br>I can't even tell if it's Americans spouting the MUH NATIONALISM anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> retarded <br><br>I mean, do you see the USSR still around?<br><br>The interesting part is that while the contribution of the US military to winning WWII and the collapse of the Soviet Union is hotly debated, the contribution of the US manufacturing/economic capacity is undeniable.<br><br><br><br>Britain stood on US food, war materiel, etc. And had Britain fallen, there would have been no D-day anvil for the Soviet hammer to fall on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nips would be invaded by every country in the world if they tried to deny access to the Gate</br>  The military is actually useful: the anime.  Is here /int/?  <br>But how about the space research and development anon.<br><br>Look: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer<wbr>_Space_Treaty<br><br>and tell me this is not a fucking nationalist propaganda just because. The other world is like the outer space too, not necessarily for sharing its domination, but for world's benefit.<br><br>I guess the series just goes "it's in Japan so it's ours".</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that USSR held whole Afghanistan while fighting proxy war with USA/Emirates and was helping official government to rebuild country, while USA and their allies sit in enclaves and do nothing except killing civilians with drones.</br>  It was okay, I guess.  <br>Wait til Godzilla shows up.</br>  <br>Barring that, sanctions so bad it would cripple their economy.</br>  <br>Please respond to this question.</br>  <br>Another retard. LDP is a conservative nationalist party. They know it's better to let USA protect Japan. Those army bases alone provide incredible multiplier effect too. Japan loses nothing but gains many benefits.</br>  <br> This scene <br>I came  again </br></br>  <br>Mother fucker i live in japan, my jgsdf friends think this shit is stupid too</br>  <br> once Abe tears apart Article 9 and the Japanese Navy gets their real aircraft carriers with Super Hornets on them <br>The US government has been begging them to do that for years, but they never do. They rather be a US protectorate than have a real military because that would cost money</br></br>  <br> lol <br>Kill yourself<br><br> tbh <br>You too</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They team up <br>Pretty awesome</br></br>  <br><br>The Novel/Manga forgets about this. <br><br>Also UNSC would boycott and sanction their asses if they ever exploited the other side.<br><br>America would probably Nuke the gate due to potential dangers beyond it as per the usual protocol.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are not a smart man.<br><br>The US presence in Asia exists at the allowance of the Japanese government. The relationship between Japan and US and the balance of power in East Asia is complex, but one thing is certain: without the strong support of the Japanese government (specifically the LDP), the US would not be able to maintain its presence in Japan.<br><br>On top of that, although the JSDF is technically a defense force, it's consistently ranked among the top ten most powerful militaries on earth, and is second only to the US in technological sophistication. The JDSF is designed to rapidly scaled up, so if there were a need for Japan to have a preeminent military force, it would not take long to make it happen. <br><br>The only significant capability the JSDF lacks is a nuclear deterrent, but even that is only partially true. Japan has working modern ballistic missile technology, a stockpile of weapons grade plutonium, a major nuclear industry, and all the resources necessary to start a weapons program. There's even some reason to believe they may have already completed designs and would only need to assemble and test them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  By far we can all agree that the American army would be better in any situation thrown at them than any other country's army.  <br>Japan is too smart to get rid of all the protection they get. We fucked ourselves over by agreeing to it.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, just like countries with crazy natural resources like Iran are getting invaded right?</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> OBL et al. were CIA trained and equipped <br><br>Well, looks like the CIA did a decent job.<br><br>Americans are simple souls. They assume that if two men are fighting, and they hand one some guns or aid money, then that man will become their friend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It is too nationalist. What you're seeing is a toned down version of a toned down version. <br><br>It is not really nationalist. The problem with Gate commentary the past 2 years is that chinese nationalists hate it and have attacked it and other japanese novels featuring the japanese military. The problem with chinese nationalist attacks has gone onto wikipedia which has had a variety of clever rewritings that have wasted a lot of time of editors to refute and then remove. Consider that Russia explored the western coast of the USA before the americans, and thus regardless of whatever treaties or wars occurred, then alaska and land all the way down to northern california should be returned to russia similar to china's claim on lands in the western pacific. After all, China claims it was first to discover, thus the land belongs to them. Similarly, the usa should obey china's logic and return its continent to spain, portugal, england, france, netherlands, denmark, and russia as they discovered it first. <br><br>Japan's Senkaku Islands is but one example: <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senka<wbr>ku_islands</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Code Geass was much more neutral, the show itself could also be interpreted as anti-imperialistic. Lelouch was basically a terrorist, you know.</br>  <br>It's just retards from /int/ spilling into /a/.</br>  <br>More like the old people oppose it and Abe is scared of the backlash and getting lynched</br>  <br>Am I reading Tom Clancy right now?</br>  <br> lol, the only people who say that have racial hatred towards Japan. </br>  <br> It had a lot more bad endings for characters. <br>In the original web version the gate closes and Itami is left on Japan side unconcious with girls on the other side, separated seemingly forever.<br>Itami gets suicidal and shit, starts stabbing himself at the gate but due to his soul connection with Rory the gate opens again. <br>Princess Pina also gets short end of the stick, tries to kill Lelei, etc.<br>Over all it was a lot darker and edgy.</br></br></br></br> </br>  Why is there /int/ in my /a/?  <br> Hong Kong and Ukraine is yearning for freedom. We will break those chains. <br>Uh... what<br> did nothing to help ukraine except sanctions <br> doesn't even have an official ambassador to Taiwan because they are too scared to piss off China </br></br></br></br>  <br>Admit war cirme!<br>Admit war crime!<br>KEK</br></br></br>  It's ALWAYS the same discussion.  All this arguing is really funny when you think about the people behind the keyboard. <br><br>Hard to take military and political shit talking seriously from fucking /a/ of all people.</br></br>  Weebs who watch anime are okay but weeaboos who defend Japan as if it were their nation are the worst  <br> On top of that, although the JSDF is technically a defense force, it's consistently ranked among the top ten most powerful militaries on earth <br>ayyyyyyyyyy<br>JSDF could hold Japan for maybe 2-3 days before breaking. Succeeding in what they are formed to do: stall any invasions long enough for main force, the US, to arrive.</br></br></br>  <br>Even as a Chink, I don't think there's too much nationalism.</br>  <br> Hard to take military and political shit talking seriously from fucking /a/ of all people. <br><br>Same goes for anime and manga related topics.</br></br></br>  <br>/int/tard are most spoiled retards in 4chan.</br>  <br>Thanks. No rape though, right?</br>  <br>Bitter weeaboos who attack Japan for everything are even worse though.</br>  <br>The USAF and USN is already there.</br>  <br> without a dictatorship like command structure <br>Err, army command structure is dictatorship by definition. If your army is good and drilled not paper tiger, it will take little to none to move any part of it.</br></br>  <br>What's that supposed to show? That china has the same tech the US does but for more manpower?</br>  <br>/tg/4lyfe</br>   USA not forcefully moving japan out of the way to conquer more territories declared rightly theirs via the manifest destiny <br>Fucking japs and their pipe dreams</br>  <br>If it was in a 3rd world nation I would agree. If it was in another region of Japan I would agree again. But in Tokyo of all places it's pretty much impossible to act upon. There is no way of justifiying having foreign troops rule over a section of your fucking capital.</br>  <br>You are right boy, but I prefer the manga</br>  <br> confirmed for being an illiterate and having watching more than 2 movies <br>Get the fuck out.<br><br><br>They are older in my opinion. The whole Hollywood thing started pretty much when America decided to participate in WWII after Pearl Harbor incident. It was not just that, a lot of stars did a massive campaign to get money and so on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah good luck invading Japan with the JMSDF, which can easily take out China's poor excuse for a Navy, there.</br>  <br>But doesn't China spend less money on soldiers and citizens are forced to spend some time in the army. Thus more man power is useless if they can't even fight with skill.</br>  <br> any other people <br><br>Nah, it just feels strange from Japan, given that Germany, its partner in militaristic expansionism at the time, still has a complex about how bad it is to take the kind of pride in the country Hitler took.<br><br>It's especially jarring in a medium with a lot of early works defined by their 'war is bad and the government is corrupt/evil' ethos.<br><br>And as someone from a white western country, it feels weird to see any national pride at all, since we must all remember that anything we accomplished is built on the backs of horrible exploitation of anyone who isn't us, and we should feel guilty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> same tech the US </br>  <br>Yes, about the manufacturing/economic capacity is right and the japs Pearl Habour Admiral's thoughts on it turned out to be true (he'd actually been to the US and looked around),<br>"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve"</br></br>   ALL THESE SALTY EUROCUCKS <br> ONY MY A M E R I C A N IMAGEBOARD <br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHA<br><br>2 HOURS TILL FREEDOM DAY<br><br>WHAT ARE YOU EURORETARDS DOING HERE?<br><br>SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BOARD BY NOW SO YOU CAN TALK ABOUT YOUR EARL GRAY TEA AND "STICKIN A FAG IN A CHAV"<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA<br><br>HEY "DO IT FOR THE QUEEN" ROFL<br><br>A QUEEN<br><br>HOLY SHIT IT CAN'T GET ANY MORE PATHETIC<br><br>WHATS NEXT, YOU GONNA PUT SUM SHRIMP ON DA BARBIE?<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if you're a weeaboo<br>Hating Korea won't make you Japanese, you never will be Japanese, get over it or kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Not the main force, just detterent, a form of "fuck with these guys and you fuck with us.", same thing happening in Poland and balts with Ukraine thing right now. Essentially an excuse for war as soon as blood spills.</br>  Any time threads for an anime are comprised mostly of faggots arguing about military history you can safely assume that the show isn't worth watching  <br> american board </br>  <br>(You)</br>    Oh great, American Sniper the anime, now featuring japs<br><br>Just what we needed</br></br>  <br>I only now understand what all these July 4th posts are about.</br>  <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.</br>  <br>War has changed.</br>  I'm glad it's nationalistic.<br><br>Every country's shows should have nationalistic undertones.</br></br>  <br>Russia + China could take Europe in a day</br>  <br>Yamamoto was a hack, Japan would have won WW2 is Togo hadn't died.</br>  <br>There was always rape in Gate. Just read the manga. If you are talking about the main heroines, the webnovel version is almost completely different than the published novel. You don't have to worry too much about that.</br>   airing this on the Fourth of July <br><br>Japan pls</br></br>  <br> a day <br><br>I could understand if you said they'd win. But in a day? Are you a fucking premium retard?</br></br></br>  <br>Russia is not important. China doesn't have the discipline to do that.</br>  There is literally nothing wrong with being nationalistic. Let it be Japan or some shit hole in Africa.  <br> I mean, do you see the USSR still around? <br>I don't see Roman Empire around either, and US has nothing to do any of them.</br></br>  <br>It was July third last night</br>  lel so many military diplomacy international politics professionals here  <br>Yeah but were the main heroines raped in any of the versions?</br>  <br>War never changes.</br>  <br>But not &gt;Nippon stronk</br>  <br> sit in enclaves killing civilians with drones <br><br>Electronics cutting people off from each other, in war as in any other area.<br><br>A drone strike is war's equivalent of the family sitting around a dinner table, each playing with their own phone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But doesn't China spend less money on soldiers and citizens are forced to spend some time in the army. Thus more man power is useless if they can't even fight with skill. <br><br>There supposedly is conscription in place, but since they get so many volunteers, it hasn't been enforced for quite a while.</br></br></br>  <br>Nationalism is retarded, it's no different from religion.<br>It's no surprise that it leads to shit like Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia or fucking ISIS.</br></br>  <br> Jul 4, 2015 at 12:30am JST </br>  <br>Go back to /pol/,you retard.</br>  <br>Yeah because that worked for Korea. Without USA and NATO defending them only 3 countries from the NATOsphere would survive: Turkey, Germany and UK. Maybe France too.<br><br>Japan isn't controlling shit. They gain immense economic and military benefits but that's it. Japanase Military is currently shit. You want to know the reason? Experience. I know armchair generals like you like to check websites like globalfirepower which never show this aspect of war. A japanese person cannot even stand seeing a gun much less firing it. <br><br>Also JSDF lacks almost everything an island nation needs. Most importantly a carrier fleet. It also lacks a good and well-maintained Air Force. Technological sophistication my ass. They're still using F-4s and F-15s.<br><br>Also they can't militarize nuclear power as there are international agreements banning it. They're free to try though. They tried to fuck shit up once. That didn't end up well for them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The anti-japan faction is just using "Gate" as their excuse to attack Japan having any military. One of the key things for China is to keep Japan's military power weak and easily defeatable. With Japan weak, there is no real presence that can oppose China in the western pacific once it gets enough defensive and offensive bastions on the various islands. China has claimed land out to the even islands between Guam and the Hawaii.<br><br>As one knows, countries or territories may vote to join another country. Certainly, the USA has a great deal of guilt in its heavy-handed mathods of how it got Hawaii to become a usa territory and then a state. For the usa to deny equality for china smacks of hypocrisy.</br></br></br>  <br>He's talking about shitposting you dumbass</br>  <br>I honestly don't think you want to see what the US Military could do if they suspended their rules of engagement.<br><br>It would be a literal slaughter.</br></br></br>  <br> Nationalism is retarded, it's no different from religion. <br>Welp.</br></br>   the greatest military victories in Japanese military history are only due to having huge numerical advantage and a sneak attack <br>LMAO<br>M<br>A<br>O</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That wasn't meant as a HAIL CHINA post. I'm genuinely curious as these look pretty much the same and chinas look cooler in most instances.<br>Also, People underestimate pure manpower.<br>Germany technologically in a completely different league than the allies and still lost because of sheer manpower.</br></br></br></br>  <br>although with america its mostly losing and editing history books to make it look like anything of value was accomplished</br>  <br>Its true though<br><br>Where you are born is a stupidly arbitrary reason to pledge loyalty</br></br></br>  <br> China <br>WELL FUCKING MEMED FAG</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=A9V<wbr>IQkPH1U8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Where are your Americans now?</br></br>    American's brain can accept military show only if it's "based America save world"  <br>go back to your Hollywood movie retards.<br><br>And any chinese or koreans is not here ?</br></br></br>  <br>It really isn't. The show's only draw is modern military curbstomping on a medieval society, except that beyond the initial novelty it got pretty old fast.</br>  <br> 90% of the posts <br>he's talking about shitposts my ignorant anon</br></br>  Could a mod ban all this retards  <br>No they couldn't. Manpower doesn't matter these days, besides, China and Russia would be absolutely fucked on the morale side. Troops would flee combat, evade service calls, surrender or outright flee the country with their families. Never depend on conscription and walls of flesh as your main tactic.</br>  <br>God, is July 4th bringing out the retards out of America in full force?<br><br>Or are these some trolls pretending to be retarded Americans?</br></br></br>  <br> MAJORITY OF THE POSTS = THEY OWN IT <br><br>LMAO THATS A HOT KEK MY GENETICALLY INFERIOR FRIEND<br><br>CHECK THIS ONE OUT<br><br> I M P L Y I N G <br><br>GUESS THAT MEANS EUROPE IS OWNED BY THE MUSLIMS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MAJORITY POPULATION, HUH?<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA<br><br>AMERICA IS #1<br><br>UNDISPUTED<br><br>BACK<br><br>TO<br><br>BACK<br><br>WORLD<br><br>CHAMPIONS<br><br>OF THE UNIVERSE<br><br>EUROPE IS NOTHING<br><br>QUIT SPEAKING MY LANGUAGE KID <br><br>ISNT IT LIKE 5 AM FOR YOU?<br><br>SHOULDNT U BE TUCKED INTO YOUR RACECAR BED SO YOU AREN'T A WEE BIT SLEEPY FA TEA<br><br>MAYBE A LIL CRUMPET<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH FISH N CHIPS WEW</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This series is pretty much a wish fulfillment fantasy from some butthurt Nip Nationalist Cuck who couldn't handle that his country was Murica's bitch.  <br>because retarded Americans are so uncommon the other 364,25 days of the year</br>  China is stronk!<br>Nip is evil!<br>Gate is a nip's silly delusion!</br></br>   fantasy world <br> with modern tech <br> cute monster girls <br> MC who's really strong and smart <br>this is basically a stealth version of those shitty video game shounens like Sword Art Online</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think in a realistic scenario, that wouldn't be the case.<br><br>Japan would need technology and support for exploiting the new world, America would need the new resources. Also the over population can be somehow lessened too.<br><br><br> The only significant capability the JSDF lacks is a nuclear deterrent <br>U wot m8</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>An army command is still responsible to the authorities like National Assembly or Congress. Unless an official order made from proper channels it's impossible to act without being court martialed. Even then you have to document and do the paper work for every necessary action. This isn't some wargame you're playing with your buddies.</br>  <br>At first I was ignoring you but now I feel the need to reply to you. 4/10 Making me slightly mad.</br>  <br>http://eye.swfchan.com/flash.asp?id<wbr>=164658&amp;n=shitposting.swf<br>literally you</br></wbr></br>  <br>I wouldn't say stealth. Also this is the far older premise.</br>  Guys, please. China looks definitely cooler. Look at all those stealth paint plastered on everything. Even their guns are stealth!  <br><br>Still better than having yet another USA movie where USA single handed saves the world from terrorists/evil russians/aliens/etc</br></br>  <br>Russia has more professional soldiers than Conscripts, this isnt the 70's anymore<br><br>Chinese are sub humans but I have seen nothing that indicates they would run away besides 'lol conscripts'</br></br></br>  <br>Someone please post the one about emus</br>  <br> Nationalism <br> Soviet Russia <br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Anyone?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so. It should be noted that a few of the main heroines were not heroines in the webnovel version. Like I said before though, it's a moot point since the novel version of Gate is way better and the heroines there are all mostly pure with the exception of the dark elf who was previously married.</br>  <br> They rather be a US protectorate than have a real military because that would cost money <br><br>It's the smart Japanese voters. They know that it costs a lot of taxes to fund a military. So they are against Japan amending its Constitution and having its own military force. Make the USA pay the taxpayer dollars and the USA also keeps various naval bases on Japan which means large payments to japan for the land as well as the soldiers putting money into the economy.</br></br></br>  <br> did nothing to help ukraine except sanctions <br>Actually they send many military tech - most of them old Soviet era or the same but modernized, but there's enough other US/NATO weapons - and they helping with info from satellites and money. But due Ukrainians incompetence, corruption, and lack of motivation in army, nothing will help except direct military invasion.</br></br>  <br>China practically copies from US designs but are not similar.</br>  Why don't they just build a wall around the gate?  <br>Why would they do that ?</br>  <br><br>We have discussed these to death in /k/. <br><br>The consensus is that the Chinese work for Cobra.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright thanks for all this.</br>  <br> /a/ <br> Not /d/ + /pol/ + /u/ + /jp/ + /y/ + /gif/ + /h/ + /lit/ + /int/ + /g/ + /sci/ + /sp/ + everything else <br>Summer pls.</br></br></br>  <br>What would they build the wall out of?</br>  <br> Russia has more professional soldiers than Conscripts <br>Hahahahahahaha.<br>The "professional soldiers" are mainly corrupt friends and family of corrupt higherups. Do you really expect them to fight for interests of men in suits? Conscripts will flee, majority of "professional soldiers" will flee, there would be only a fraction of bitter loyalists remaining and those would be rolled over fairly quickly.</br></br></br>  <br>Eotena</br>  <br>Nah bro, I smell a fucking boatload of butthurt gooks in the thread</br>   we're not going to try to destroy the gate because we think another one will appear <br>What the fuck kind of logic is that? Why you would you ever think that?<br><br>Even if it did, wouldn't it be infinitely preferable to have a gate somewhere else besides the middle of a densely populated city?</br></br></br>  <br>But the Cobra dojo are weaboos</br>  There has never been another series that has depicted feelings of love more realistically than the way Yui treats 8man.  <br>I disagree<br>Hayama x 8man true OTP</br></br>  So what's wrong with that guy? Why doesn't he let that bitch stroke his hair?  Reminder to stay hydrated  <br>Why doesn't 8man understand her love? Why must he never return her feelings?</br>  <br>She overstepped her boundaries. It wouldn't be the last time either.</br>  Can't imagine season 1 with this art style.  Now that's alpha.  <br>She isn't genuinely stroking it</br>  <br>A) He does understand her feelings and wants them but can't trust his own.<br>B) He can't understand her feelings but wants to, but can't trust his own feelings.<br>C) He understands them but likes someone else.</br></br></br>  <br>This pretty much confirmed  Yukino friend end with a Yui romantic end .</br>  <br><br>Because he's not a penguin. He's a bear.</br></br>  <br>A or C. Definitely not B.</br>  <br>Probably B, considering 8man has been wrong about nearly every major character he thought he had down.</br>  <br>I thought he was a panda</br>  <br>Pandas are bears.</br>  <br>Remember 8man did the same thing to her, he realizes it after the double date with Orimoto.</br>  <br>He wanted to be a bear, but that was old 8man. Much has changed.</br>  <br>Not exactly though</br>  <br> Semantics </br>  <br>C</br>  <br>In Yukino's case it managed to make her fall out of love with him.</br>  <br>Did you forget about the infirmary scene where she did basically the same thing  and got a kiss with it </br>  <br>I don't get it, why didn't 8man kiss her against her will?</br>  <br> against her will </br>  <br> Leans in <br> Accidentally touch his wound  <br> against her will </br></br></br>  <br> realistically <br>HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA as always yaharitards are the worst fanbase onf /a/</br></br>  <br>Vol 10 is suppose to have subtle hints to the ending, and the infirmary scene was definitely not subtle.</br>  <br>I can't imagine season 2 with season 1's art style</br>  Is this really necessary?<br><br> Who Am I kidding, I have nothing else to do anyway. </br></br>   yfw pandas are just as fussy when it comes to mating as the 8man is <br><br><br>He knows that she's a nice girl and convinces himself that she's just being nice to him. Anything he picks up on is assumed to be a misunderstanding.</br></br></br>  <br>If she did fall out of love with him she wouldn't have kept telling him to stop showing up.<br>She was disappointed in him and 8man knew he had lost her, at least he tried to make things better, and did by abandoning superficiality again.</br></br>  <br>Why the most compassionate girls are always lose to generic supposedly beautiful girl, same with childhood friend?</br>  <br>Heave ho, cunts and killer, never shall we die</br>  <br>It's just Yuifags, anon. They're the most /r9k/ following here.</br>  <br>So true</br>  Irohasu~  <br> If she did fall out of love with him she wouldn't have kept telling him to stop showing up. <br>She didn't want him around, that is why she did that.</br></br>  <br> 8man mating <br><br> H-Hikigaya, h-how is this then? <br> No woman, harder <br> But- we've- I can't <br> Guess I have to do it myself huh? <br> H-huh, wait!

She didn't want around because she fell out of love with him.</br>  <br>She wanted to know more about him<br>in a platonic way</br></br>  <br> NeuronStar <br>Oh, the irony.</br></br>  <br>Yukino platonically raping 8man's lips while platonically grinds his groin doujin when?</br>  <br>She didn't want him around because he might reignite her feelings, and he did.</br>  <br>Then why was she eye raping Yui's Hikki?</br>  <br> file name <br>It's a long road, brother.</br></br>  <br>No you fuck. Yukino's reason are the same reasons why Hachiman told Yui to stop in S1E5.</br>  <br>She's sexually interested in him, but only completely platonic sex between two friends that are only interested in each other platonically</br>  <br><br>She didn't want him around because she didn't think he wanted to be around anymore.<br><br> I took the bait, just not sure which one it actually is. </br></br></br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>It all makes sense now.</br>  So by the time 8man joined the club, Yukino knew he was the boy, her car almost killed?  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Now that's beta.</br>   127544407 <br><br>this image evolves every time I see it</br></br>  <br>I have been wondering, are you the cuntkiller or just another guy?</br>  <br>That is not love.

I don’t need to hear that from you, Hikio.” <br><br> “R-Right…” <br><br> Waah… Miura-tan, you’re sooo scary… Miura glared at me for a moment, but eventually suppressed her sharp look and took another step. With a small voice as if making a rebuttal to me, she mumbled. <br><br> “It’s just… well… see, even including the annoying stuff,” said Miura, turning around as if making a spin. The hems of her coat and her glossy blonde hair lightly danced. Her body still turning in motion, she wore a slightly embarrassed grin. “I guess it’s okay, after all.” <br><br> I couldn’t help but be in awe when she said that with such a nice smile. To think you could state it so simply. It’s a pure aspiration exactly because it’s so simplistic, so concise and so straightforward. <br><br> For a short while, I watched that smile in a daze. When she noticed my gaze, Miura retracted her smile and briskly began walking in displeasure. <br><br> “Oh… with just that, it’s okay. So it was that simple…” <br><br> When I turned around to the muttering voice, Yuigahama was squeezing the bosom of her coat. Standing next to her, Yukinoshita was looking at Miura with a stunned expression. <br><br> However, it might not have been something to be surprised around. Even during the field trip, Miura had grasped Hayama and Ebina-san’s intentions. Perhaps, those soft emotions she had could even be called genuine… Don’t forget Miura-san was a holder of mother qualities, too! <br><br>Miura for genuine best girl!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still don't understand why Yukino would be at fault for this.</br>  <br>fuck commies</br>  <br>Wait, why do yo u have problems with my boy Hayama?</br>  <br>I don't know, you tell me</br>  <br>The Chinese word for "panda" can be literally translated as "giant cat bear"<br><br>So not only is it a bear, but a cat one too.

They've gotten kind of ridiculous.</br></br>  <br>I think it's kind of rude considering she told all three of them when their birthday was but only he remembered.<br>also: <br> why? <br>aren't they supposed to be friends at this point?</br></br></br></br>  <br> We hope you enjoy observing the couple's behavior  <br><br>But we are not enjoying it at all.</br></br></br>  8man will become a wolf and will get the foxy girl  <br><br>Too bad Saki and Miura don't get into it for real during that scene in vol 11.<br><br>It'd be nice to see Miura getting the absolute shit beaten out of her by Saki.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a fish so every other animal eats him</br>  <br>Miura already warmed up to Yukinoshita. Miura warming up to SakiSaki when?</br>  <br>Yui end confirmed</br>  How in the world did Hikigaya-kun grow up to become the way he is?  <br>He's a HAMA HETO SHAKU he goes sha~</br>  <br>How in the world did he grow up to be an 8/10?</br>  Why is onii-chan such a hinedere?  <br>Komachi was wrong, he's more of a kuudere</br>  <br>A series of disappointments and rejections with no relief.</br>  <br>Don't know, how did you end up here?</br>  What is the probability of Tobe winning everyone in the end?  <br>Her problem is dependancy. She has an opportunity to solve her problem by depending on someone. <br>See why that won't work out?</br></br>  <br>Including or excluding ebin?</br>   yfw when the service club disbands temporarily because of all the drama <br> Yukino becomes more independent, Yui becomes more assertive, and we don't get much of Iroha because she doesn't have an excuse to hang around 8man. <br> the club is empty (it got disbanded) <br> 8man remembers that he left one of his books in the club <br> He goes to get it and finds a familiar face <br> It's   yumiko <br> she wants to make a request regarding hayato <br> Her request is to get into a genuine relationship with hayato <br> Although reluctant at 1st, he accepts her request but states that he is going to be the only one able to help her <br> Yumiko and 8man start spending time together and they find their relationship organic and fresh due to the fact that there is no romance drama between them <br> As they get more comfortable with each other, they find that both of them have their good sides and they learn to accept each other’s flaws <br> The closer she gets to know 8man, the more she realizes that hayato is a cunt and is only using her to keep other girls away from him <br> yumiko, feed up with hayato’s BS, declares that her relationship with the cunt is the furthest thing from a genuine relationship <br> She thanks hikio for his help, and apologizes for ending her request so rapidly <br> 8man feels troubled at the sudden end of her request because he knows that they are not going to talk as much  <br>  8man says: “even if it’s not with hayama, I-I can still fulfill your… Nevermind, goodbye” <br> Yumiko couldn’t say a word due to the sudden change of 8man’s character and she sees him leave. <br> Yumiko falls out of love with the cunt and is now just friends with him <br> However, something is still prickling in her heart <br> The service club opens shop again and it seems like everyone in the club is doing better than before <br> The three girls await 8man’s arrival at the club but someone else shows up <br> yumiko formally asks the club to help her ask 8man out on a date because they are the people closest to him. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wait what was yukis request in the last episode? why the hell does it cut off like that? shit ending.  <br>It's called a cliffhanger, and yes it's shit but the alternative is even shittier</br>  <br>Her request will be to split 50 5lb packages among the three of them and throw each package into random dumpsters.</br>  <br><br>It will be to help her answer 17-down in her crossword puzzle.</br></br>  <br>Packages containing what exactly?</br>  <br>35-40 tops. Nobody in japan is that fat.</br>  <br> Her mom and Haruno <br><br><br>Shredded remnants of her Pan-san collection.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Right, can't believe I didn't think of that. </br>  <br> worst <br>They're energetic sure but if you think this is legitimately bad then you need to lurk more. There is so many terrible fanbases on /a/. If I had to pick a worst I would probably say... Yuru Yuri. Which sucks because I like that show a lot.</br></br>    <br>Mine even had a loli and a transfer student in it. Good times, eh anon?</br>  How often does the main heroine lose in a rom-com?  <br>8man will become a bear.</br>  <br>Rarely, Yukino should be safe.</br>  I am honestly drawing a blank on Yukino's request. I can think of three possibilities:<br><br>  "Let me take some time away from the group to settle myself." <br>Which will probably end up being a mistake. I can see this one if there's definitely a volume 13.<br><br>  "Give me advice on my problems." After that she relates her whole history with Haruno, her mom, and maybe Hayato.  <br>I dunno how exactly it would work out, what advice she would get, etc.<br><br>  Some sort of request that involves trying to fix her strained relationship with Haruno. Who knows how it will be phrased exactly. <br>I think even if Yukino's dependency problem is totally resolved, she will still have a bad relationship with her sister. There's definitely an air between them that needs to be cleared. Haruno's comment that she and Yukino have never really fought is foreshadowing I think (and bizarre for siblings in my experience at least). They're due for a screaming match probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Main heroine that is a main romantic love interest rarely loses<br><br>Note that sometimes main love interest(s) arent necessarily main heroines</br></br></br>  <br>Could be something that ties into Hiki's request for something genuine. Maybe she asks everybody to do some soul searching <br><br>Could be anything but I think whoever "solves" the request of both Yukino and hachiman will be the winner of Sensei Contest</br></br></br>  <br> soul searching <br>Nigga how does one do that? I'm genuinely curious</br></br>  <br>When it's the main heroine and the MC's main interest almost never, but this isn't a romcom.</br>  <br>You go looking for souls, if you watched enough anime you should know this already</br>  Irohasu~  Will Yukino ever give Hachiman her cookies/chocolates?<br><br>Fuck Watari; we gotta wait half a year to find out if that happens and what Yuki's request is</br></br>  <br><br>My guess is she's going to give him her chocolates that very day the cliffhanger ended on.<br><br>Along with some sort of qualified confession like "I think I'm love with you but I don't if I'm just using you" or "I love you but I'm afraid I could be relying on you" and asking him to hold off giving her an answer until later when she's had time to sort things out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The contest is between Yukino amd Hachiman. <br><br>But with Hachiman's request, most likely, Yukino will win. If Hiratsuka doesn't play favourites, and she told Hachiman after her evaluation in the hallway, Hachiman is her favourite.</br></br></br>  Why exactly did Yukino and Hachiman end up idealizing each other?  <br>Sexual attraction</br>  <br>No, I don't think Yukino will give Hachiman cookies. Now, that they are conscious of her dependency and her "copypasta" tendencies.<br><br>I think Watari will make Yukino give Hachiman something else that doesn't mirror Yui giving Hachiman cookies.</br></br></br>  <br>Sensei included Yui in the contest once she joined the club, so she can't be ignored anymore in regards to that, not to mention she brought it up in the final scene.<br><br>I'm thinking Hachiman will win and that will be his time to decide between the two girls.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino might win, she has the advantage of two requests given specifically to her in the contest.<br>The first being Hiratsuka's to change Hachiman, the second being to find "genuine".</br></br>  <br><br>Giving chocolates on Valentine's day is so common in Japan Yukino doesn't really have to worry about "I am just copying Yui in giving cookies to Hachiman".</br></br>  <br>Hiratsuka mentioned that she wanted Hachiman to change Yukino when she was lecturing her about being genuine, she said it didn't have to be him, but she wanted it to be him.</br>  <br>They both saw each other as loners who were in similar situations but had different worldviews. But up until Ebin confession and StuCo, Yukino's perception of him changed and when genuine happened it changed again.</br>  <br>Hiratsuka and Haruno sure are pushing Yukino and Hachiman together a lot.<br>Hiratsuka tries to be subtle about by thowing in Yui but she keeps saying that he's doing it for Yukino.</br></br>  <br> Sensei included Yui in the contest once she joined the club <br>When? Yukino brought up the contest in episode three and Yui was completely dumbfound and Yukino had to tell Yui of Hiratsuka's contest. I don't recall Hiratsuka saying Yui is a contestant when she joined nor after Yukino told her. <br><br>And Hiratsuka evaluation was more or less directed at Hachiman and Yukino, her evaluation of Yui wasn't as critical when it came to Yui but she did tried to make Yui feel something with her "And you're the glue" line.</br></br></br></br>  Arguing about whether Yui is in Sensei's vague contest is pointless. She's in it if she wants to be.<br><br>The main thing is nearly everyone is agreement it's going to be won by either Hachiman or Yukino, with Hachiman the prohibitive favorite.<br><br>Though I think it's going to be Yukino. She'll solve Sensei's first request, she'll fulfill genuine. She'll probably get credit at the end for something else and Sensei will award it to Yukino. Hachiman will realize the whole thing was humorously rigged from the beginning.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, yeah. With chocolates it is different and I can agree with you there. <br><br>Except Yukino should opt out of the cookies, if she is smart enough to realize that giving Hachiman cookies is not good only for the fact with Hachiman's internal monologues, he is always linking events together, so I feel if Yukino give him the cookies regardless, Hachiman will have an internal monologue about Yui. Is what I was getting at.</br></br></br>  What would Hayama have done if Hikigaya wasn't there at the field trip?  <br><br>Do we know they're cookies in her bag? I mean she made them at home. They could be chocolates.<br><br>I guess Hachiman could overthink her giving cookies (it's certainly his style to do so) but I tend to think he would give her the benefit of the doubt on that at least. But who knows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hilariously confess to ebina</br>  <br>We don't even know if she had cookies in the bag since the package she had for the cookies was different, she obviously had something specially made for Hachiman.</br>  <br><br>Nothing. He group would have gotten strained and probably split apart. The nucleus would have stayed with Hayama and attracted new members with him never being blamed for anything.<br><br>That kinda shit has probably been going on his entire life.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have bro time with a sad Tobe.</br>  I suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.</br></br>  <br>I wonder what Yukino thinks of Orimoto, when she saw her on the double date she refused to acknowledge her existence.</br>  Irohasu ?  <br><br>Yukino showed up after Hayama had chewed them out didn't she? At that time did she even know about her "history" with Hachiman?<br><br>Though now that she does she might be thinking about that double date again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does she know 8man asked her out in the past? She knows Orimoto has history with 8man but I'm sure if she knew 8man liked her then she would see her as competition.</br>  At any rate since Orimoto is confirmed to be giving chocolate to 8man, she needs to do it somehow where the other girls will see it. Just for more jealousy points.<br><br>Although I think she'll stop by his house and give it to him. The act of receiving them from Orimoto of all people could cause Hachiman to monologue out some self-development.</br></br>  <br>I want to kiss[/spoiler] this cu tie. </br>  <br>Cry that he couldn't prevent another of his shallow circles break apart after things get a little bit rough and go to Haruno to watch her fuck strangers while he watches as consolation.</br>  <br>How do you even fuck that up</br>  <br>Well, duh. We don't know, even still, after the the threesome date it is still a possibility she MAY give Hachiman cookies or something else.</br>  <br>Haruno is pure<br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Bullshit, I used ctrl+s</br>  IROHASU!  <br><br>It's really pathetic that he couldn't fix it on his own.<br><br>All he'd have to do is ask Miura to figure out why Ebina would reject Tobe. That would get the whole "I don't want to be with anyone right now" answer. Then he'd tell Tobe that. Since it's from the worshipped Hayama, Tobe would surely believe it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What if Orimoto, after giving 8man chocolate in front of the girls, whispers in his ear   I can see you being a boyfriend <br>It would be nice to see her join his harem and force the other girls to make a move on him</br></br>  <br>I feel sorry for you. I have zero motivation to go through these threads and they keep piling up.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but considering she's just recently told him that he's still not 'boyfriend material' I find it doubtful.</br></br>  <br>Why do you even keep them up, it's all 90% shitposting anyway<br>How much RAM do you have, having that many tabs open on Chrome kills my computer</br></br>  <br> senpaai, is it ok for me to have the strawberry? <br> then I'll take it <br><br>Typesetter-kun, it's all yours.</br></br></br></br>  <br>get a better one, or more ram</br>  <br>Get in line nigga.</br>  <br>I think her view of him changed in 2.5 months, especially since she's giving him chocolate</br>  <br>Just download more RAM, it's free</br>  I don't want yukino to win, she does not deserve it, Yui has done more for Hikki and Iroha has much better chemistry with 8man.<br>Yukino doesn't deserve to win as much as the other 2.</br>  Irohasu~  <br><br>Yeah yeah love doesn't go to the most deserving.<br><br>Besides Yukino is probably going to get credit for the fulfillment of genuineness which will shatter everything else the other girls have done in Hachiman's mind</br></br></br></br>  <br> Wahh merits and chemistry matters in relationship <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4A3<wbr>pX_shcyU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>But she'll win anyway<br> and us Yukinofags will bathe in your tears </br></br>  At this point I don't think Yui or Yukino's love for 8man is healthy.<br><br>They both need character development to be contenders. Either that, or they need to be rejected and have character development that way.<br><br>In other words, nobody will win until they change.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Irohasu~<br><br><br>Wait, cuntkiller knows moon?</br></br></br></br>  <br> They both need character development to be contenders <br> In other words, nobody will win until they change <br>congratulations on discovering the plot of volume 12.</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha is life.</br>  <br>A have loads of shit open with 8GB.</br>  <br>Not him but that's not the only problem, the main problem is 8man himself. He's still a cynical and still was a loner mindset, he's not ready for a romance yet.<br>If volume 12 is the last one, then I don't see anything but a loner end.</br></br>  <br> tfw I have 6GB RAM but the rest is shit <br>I need to upgrade my computer<br>Nice specs</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see it that way.<br><br>He has gone far in getting away from his loner mindset, and look at all the times he's thought about "stepping over the line," especially in the context of Yui. I think he's perfectly set up to decided that he wants to take the step from friendship to romance with one of the girls by the end of the next book.</br></br></br>  Why does Haruno seem happy as fuck when she's with 8man? Is he really that fun to be around?  <br>His loner mindset is long gone, he doesn't want to be that way.<br>To him the loner end is now just a risk he's willing to take to achieve "genuine" with them.</br></br>  <br>He's entertaining. Much more intersting than the usual rabble she's around.<br><br>Basically she's a high class noblewoman who takes interest in the humble peasant due to how new and outside the norm he is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well he no longer embraces the loner lifestyle.<br><br>But I don't think he's quite shed that tendency to rationalize away people's affections. He hasn't accepted yet that he's someone people are capable of loving.<br><br>Someone needs to communicate that to him. Someone that he will reject first. My money is on  Iroha_ .</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll bet on my arse she won't cry after being rejected</br>  <br> Do we know they're cookies in her bag? <br>It is a mystery. Yukino reaction could be seen as regret for not giving Hachiman the cookies, or her refraining from giving Hachiman cookies (or, chocolates, whatever was in her bag) since Yui took the first initative.<br><br><br> I mean she made them at home. They could be chocolates. <br>Yeah, could be chocolates. Although, they made chocolates at the event, so would Yukino give Hachiman chocolates again? I mean, Yukino can always convey her chocolates as different than the meaning of the event chocolates "This isn't friendship/obligation" chocolates.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Early on they were similar in a lot of respects even if on the surface they are rather different. Even Yukino drew a comparison between them.<br><br>Now she's seeing him as striving for something she's given up on and it interests her. Well all that + he's a guy hanging around her sister a lot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's stepped over the line with Yui and Iroha this volume, especially Iroha if context of their scenes is taken in consideration, but that doesn't mean he's ready for anything. He's still seeking his genuine thing and knows that it might hurt people, and that doesn't need to be a romance.<br><br><br>Genuine doesn't mean romance. He still has a long way to go. Hell, he can't even straight up say that he acknowledges the girls' feelings.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He should just do it.</br>  <br>what even happened in this episode?<br>should i just go read the LN? i've been on a binge anyway. how redundant will it be?</br></br>  <br>He is a nice guy, and fun to hang out with</br>    <br>Bu he just stands there and makes awkward and cynical comments.</br>   Yuigahama is a nice girl <br> Yukinoshita is a strong girl <br><br>What is Iroha?</br></br></br>  <br> he just stands there and makes awkward and cynical comments <br>Aren't we all anon?</br></br>  <br> He hasn't accepted yet that he's someone people are capable of loving. <br>It's more than that.<br><br>He has lived his life so long never being attached to anyone that he himself is not sure if he's capable of loving someone. It's an unexplored territory. Something mysterious and alien.<br><br>For such a thing to be possible, mutual love with another human being, it's nothing but an ideal. But what if it were possible? What if you could truly love them to the point of absolute trust and confidence? What would you call such a thing? Something not based on necessity or illusion, but based on something real. Something genuine.<br><br>It's difficult to follow his mentality, especially when the answer seems so obvious to an observer, but 8man is a highschool student who's ignorant to all of this. He's still on the path to finding his answer.<br><br><br>A cute, hardworking girl with a playful personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Use one adjective anon, no bias</br>  <br>is in love with Hayama.<br><br>PS. These are things 8man mistook about the girls.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish, I had a friend like that in HS, all I had were clowns</br>  <br>sly</br>  <br>It's worth reading, definitely.<br><br>S1 left out a lot of amusing stories like 8man's "dates" with Totsuka that Zaimokuza kept crashing, playing strip Daihinmin, and 8man and Sensei's ramen date.<br><br>Reading the LNs will really help you understand the events of S2 better though. They really started compressing things after the StuCo election, and in general you get more of 8man's internal monologues which I think Feel tried and failed to express visually through things like the blushing in the infirmary scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're not all dark, tall and handsome.</br>  <br>C</br>  <br>a cute girl</br>  <br>He's fucking autistic and an edgelord<br><br>You tell me</br></br></br>  <br>I think what autism spectrum people don't seem to quite understand is that normal people don't actually hate them or dislike being around them. People acting weird is actually pretty fun any entertaining. Someone who's far enough on the spectrum to regularly do strange, embarrassing things is actually a treasure to normal people. They're an endless source of things to talk about and reminisces about and etc. It can sometimes be more like bullying. But most of the time it's actually entirely good natured and people will think of their crazy friend and his antics with fondness.</br>  <br>After hayama.<br>8man is mistaken all the time.</br></br>  <br>With romance, it is debatable, in my eyes. Genuine itself is still ambiguous to him and the characters, so it could mean either friendship or romance. Genuine is a relationship of some sort and hopefully volume twelve clear the ambiguity and vagueness. From the final chapter of volume ten, all I know is Hachiman does not want an No Longer Human end where he is Yozo, living in isolation and self-reflectivity.</br>  <br>If anything I'm biased against Iroha. She's not my favorite and I don't want her to win, but I can still recognize why she's a likable character and what her most prominent attributes are.<br>If I had to pick a word then  is right.<br>She's a sly girl.</br></br></br>  <br>So this is way they keep me around in school?</br>  <br>Maybe his butt hurts.</br>  <br> not genuine <br> not important <br> in love with Hayama </br></br></br>  <br>I'd take a Yozo over a Hachiman anytime.</br>  <br> Intel core i5 <br> 3.40Ghz <br> 32 Celsius <br>You're not going to overclock it?</br></br></br></br>  When is Commie going to release the subs for yesterday's episode? God damn they are taking so long.  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>It's at 4.3GHz.<br><br>You guys really need to stop having these threads so frequently.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm starting to think the slyness is all one big misunderstanding by 8man.</br>  What's so bad about this woman? Does she need to feel the touch of a man?  <br><br>She's got some major 5head and triangle face going on in that scene, for starters.</br></br>  <br>her chin is too pointy and looks like an ayylium</br>  <br>K-drama antagonistic mother syndrome.</br>  <br>genuine girl</br>  <br>8man sucks at reading people beyond the most shallow masks.</br>  <br><br>How dare you, she is a Japanese beauty.</br></br>  <br>Her partner doesn't give her enough dickings.</br>  <br>So you're saying he's wrong about her being genuine, eh?</br>  <br><br>All we know is that Yukino really doesn't like her and Haruno said she's very strong-willed.<br><br>  Rumi smiled weakly in return as she gripped her digital camera. “Yeah… but my mum doesn’t get it. She’s always asking me how I’m getting along with my friends. She said, ‘Take lots of photos at the outdoor ed camp!’ and so this camera…” <br>  That was why she bought the camera, huh. Well, it made sense to create memories to last a lifetime out of a school trip or some event like that. It wasn’t so strange to get fired up and be on the lookout for opportunities. <br>  “I see… she’s a nice mum. She worries about you, Rumi-chan,” Yuigahama said with relief. <br>  But Yukinoshita’s unpleasantly cold voice immediately followed. “I wonder about that… is that not a sign she wants to manipulate you, put you under her control and own you?” Her words stirred up uneasiness, the sort of feeling you’d get from treading on thin ice. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She did nothing wrong.</br>  <br> tfw 90% don't get the referrence <br>My take is<br> Iroha is after Hayama </br></br></br>  Irohasu~  <br>Wasn't paying attention to what the lines were referring to.<br>My bad.</br></br>  <br>Can't wait for it to be revealed that Mr. Yukinoshita is/was just like Hachiman and all of the women of the household are attracted to him for that reason.</br>  <br> roughly 17 tb <br>Why do you need so much money, and how much fucking backlog worth of anime do you have?<br>Holy shit.<br><br>And i was sitting here thinking that my 2 tb was impressive.</br></br></br></br></br>  Best family.  <br> yfw that isn't the most impressive right here ITT </br>  <br>*Why do you need so much memory.</br>  <br>i want this</br>  <br><br>Hachiman as future politician you say?<br><br>How could you be a genuine politician?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cliched as fuck.</br>  <br>There's no such thing such as too much memory<br>Although you have a point, a decade from now 10TB will be a household item</br></br>  <br>Why did they kidnpap Rumi?</br>  <br>So he married Rumi and adopted Yukino, right?</br>  So that was it? Seriously? No S3 or OVA's? Are we really going to have to read the fucking LN if we want some closure?  <br>I take it you don't watch Haganai</br>  <br><br>Welcome to the world of LN anime adaptations.</br></br>  <br>Some things become cliche because they're the most genuine.</br>  <br>Why is uncle 8man playing with Hayama's daughter here?</br>  Yui is love<br>Yui is life<br><br>She is the only heroine that loves Hikki.</br></br></br>  <br>Sweet reverse NTR baby</br>  Yuifags are in for a rude awakening.  <br>So Rumi is now Hayama and Haruno's daughter?<br>I thought Rumi was basically mini 8man</br></br>  <br> Vol 10 is suppose to have subtle hints to the ending <br>man how dumb are you???<br>that is just fucking stupid...</br></br></br>  <br>He is into younger girls<br>If he doesn't get together with anyone he is gonna fuck their daughters in the future.</br></br>  <br>WW said it himself, although I agree that anon is fucking stupid</br>  I just want Yukino to be happy. Are the happiest times she has had in the series the moments she spends with Hachiman (we dont get to see YuixYukino doing things without 8man)<br><br> 8man Winning her Pan-San Plush in Vol 3 <br> Roller Coaster ride <br> Wanting to make chocolates for someone she cares about </br></br></br></br>  <br>When is Hikigaya's mother going to appear to complete this circle of milfs? I want them all to spend time together and chat about their children.</br>  <br>It's common knowledge at this point, WW said the ending is foreshadowed in vol10.</br>  <br><br>We've seen her in the manga.</br></br>  <br>People are slow as fuck if they couldn't see this but Yukino's case is kind of extreme.</br>  So we getting a s3 or nah ? I just started zoku<br><br> Also why Saki is so cute? </br></br>  <br>Try volume 6.5</br>  <br>Yahallo to that,<br>my brother.</br></br>  <br>Cute. She's the reason they wear track suits?</br>  Why was season 2 so boring and melodramatic? Even the new designs have no charm, they added a bunch of post effects too everything looks so washed out, and it's not like the animation got any better either. I am honestly disappointed.  <br>The Hikigaya trait<br>they all wear tracksuits for some unknown reason</br></br>  <br>She reminds me of someone</br>  <br>Oh my achy breaky heart</br>  <br>Same</br>  If Yukino wins we riot.  8man should just give in to his siscon fantasies and have his way with Iroha.  Hey. Dumping an ongoing scanlation (author of Love Roma). <br><br>This needs an additional editor (600dpi scans). You'd either be helping with the latest chapter that's been translated, or redoing v01 with proper editing and scans at your own pace.<br><br> The story which follows the adventure of Takeo, the most unfortunate girl of the universe. Takeo goes to school and lives alone in an inn called Hyakkisô (the manor of 100 demons).

Obviously.</br>  <br>well go ask them then</br>  <br>He said "buying the blu rays would support them" so I'm pretty sure it's coming</br>  <br>His left eye's all wonky.</br>  Are they going to release a dub trailer or what?   Liam O'Brien or Steve Bailey weren't cast as Caesar <br>I mad.</br>  <br>do they have good italian accents?</br>  https://twitter.com/SirCoward/statu<wbr>s/617075595604721664</wbr>  Looks like abra  <br>I AM MAD</br>  <br>No clue, but Liam had a nice british accent when voicing Axl Low.</br>  <br>I'm a fan of Johnny Yong Bosch but I'm not sure how to feel about him as Jonathan Joestar.</br>  <br><br>Brigadoon: Marin to Melan</br></br>  <br>The accents just really feel forced on all of them</br>  <br> No I reject my humanity <br>Bullshit</br></br>  <br>I actually really liking Jonathan, everyone sounds kinda awkward though and Dio is sounding a bit too brutish but then again, it is an intense scene.</br>  The Battle Tendency one.<br>https://twitter.com/SirCoward/statu<wbr>s/617103197417549824</wbr></br>  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br>My faith in the dub is gone. It can only be redeemed if the DVD has the original sub.

Then again, I can't really find a way to fix it since dubbing is something I'm not well versed in.</br></br>  <br>There are better reasons to hate this dub other than that it didn't include your meme quotes.<br>These accents are terrible and JYB as Jonathan is literally the worst casting choice ever.<br><br>But yes, it will obviously have subtitles you dumb fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure, the mock up DVD box says nothing about Japanese audio, got me concerned</br>  <br><br>Holy shit Joseph sounds like a smart person. wtf</br></br>  <br>I agree he should have been more punky</br>  <br> There are better reasons to hate this dub other than that it didn't include your meme quotes. <br>I didn't say it was because it doesn't have the meme quotes you retard.<br><br>And no we aren't sure yet as the DVD box mockup doesn't say it'll have Japanese audio as any other anime ever does on their box.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is literally standard practice to release with jap voice and subs.</br>  <br><br> Of course it has <br> it will obviously have <br>Please inform me where it says Japanese audio :^)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Motherfucker, it is AD 2000+15. 4kids went out of business years ago.<br>There is NO COMPANY OPERATING IN NORTH AMERICA THAT MAKES DUB-ONLY DVDs.<br><br>If it matters so much to you then maybe you should've BOUGHT THE LIMITED EDITION BLU RAYS TWO YEARS AGO WHICH HAD SUBS THAT HAD "SANTANA" AND NOT "SANTVIENTO"</br></br></br></br>  <br> Please inform me where it says Japanese audio :^) <br>It doesn't say it has English audio either so I guess the DVDs will be 100% muted :^)</br></br>  <br> That widescreen format box <br>Haven't seen that in a while.</br></br>  <br> English SDH <br> Hi I can't read </br></br>  What have you done to support JoJo today?  <br> Subtitles: English and Español <br><br>Oh boy, does that mean what I'm thinking it means???</br></br></br>  <br> English SDH <br> (Subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing-Impaired) <br>Too bad they won't have descriptive video since you are the one who is blind.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It erases everything except the positions of people.

Nothing.</br>  I still don't understand why Jotaro could fly. Was it another facet of the Stand?  <br>Not him, but seeing that box, and seeing my anime DVDs, they all say "English and Japanese" audio somewhere on the back. As that doesn't, that might be a reason to be concerned. And, this isn't Funimation, this is Warner Bros. When was the last time they did an anime DVD release?<br><br>Please prove me wrong, show me the last WB anime release and see if it has the original audio.</br></br></br>  <br>i assume so</br>  <br>Araki thought it looked cool so it happened</br>  <br>Yeah but he never flies again, when it could be insanely useful in every part, especially part 6</br>  <br>Yeah I was just thinking that. It still obviously has to be a stand power though. So maybe the flying power was attainable when Jotaro was at the peak of power of his stand (He hadn't time stopped in 10 years as stated in part 4, so maybe without practice his stands true powers weaken.) I still agree with you though, it was definitely some Araki make-the-fight-look-cool bullshit.</br>  <br>The Cell Saga was big at the time.</br>  <br>That OP is a faggot.</br>  <br>Esta mi, Dio!</br>  <br>Bought a DIO and The World SAS.</br>  <br>Picture?</br>  <br>Fui yo, Dio!<br><br>learn spanish (actually don't, it's a shitty language)</br></br></br>  <br> Please prove me wrong, show me the last WB anime release and see if it has the original audio. <br>http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/A<wbr>SIN/B004VLLWA6/<br> Dubbed: Japanese <br> Studio: Warner Home Video <br><br>http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/A<wbr>SIN/B002WCLG3Y/<br> Dubbed: Japanese, Spanish <br> Studio: Warner Home Video </br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Did some google-searching. Not sure if I'd be alarmed at this second, but there might be reason to.<br><br>WB has done some releases such as Naruto and Hunter x Hunter, but their boxes all do say English and Japanese audio somewhere. One I see that matches the Jojo box without saying it, is Bakugan, and that doesn't have the Japanese dub. But then again, that was a Cartoon Network show.<br><br>So I don't even know myself. Should we panic?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, that first one does say English and Japanese audio on the box.<br><br>But bear in mind, the Jojo box is a mockup, it probably doesn't have all the info on it.

He's Numbuh One from Codename: Kids Next Door.</br>  <br>kind of</br>  <br>I don't think Troy Baker has any reason to do animu now that he's Samevoice Mceverygame.</br>  <br> My name is Okuyasu and in case you forgot I got a Stand! </br>  <br>THE PLEASURE OF CUMMING INSIDE</br>  <br>The stardust preview was way better</br>  <br>It's kinda weird, but I usually imagine Kars being voiced by Jonathan Freeman if he were dubbed.</br>  <br> So, we don't know. <br>Das it goyim, buy the BD. I'd wager my and Kakyoin's souls that it's already in pre-production</br></br>  Went to jojo cosplay stuff at ax. Also I cant stand the narrator for the dub. And antfish is best.

I think he sounds too breathy at times, but I hope it doesn't get in the way of the Mansion fight.<br><br>Original VA nailed the Mansion Fight so fucking hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Young speedwagon sounds good. No news on the rest though</br>  <br> and reminds me of Lelouch's dub va <br><br>He IS Lelouch's dub va.</br></br></br>  <br>John is basically a man-child, though.</br>  <br> That Narancia <br>actually works, huh<br><br>Did anyone ever see a good MALE Jojo cosplay?<br><br>of any kind?<br><br>I know the muscle ones are pretty much impossible though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speedwagon has two different VAs?</br>  So isn't this proof part 4 is happening? Just waiting for announcement?  <br>It sounds alright, but it just doesn't sound like the VA are putting enough emotion into their lines, which is something that stood out to me watching JoJo subbed.<br><br> I'm still gonna watch this dub when it comes out though. </br></br></br>  <br>I was staring at this black man</br>  <br>Old Speedwagon sounded fine too.</br>  <br>They put the birthmark on Jonathan and Joseph in the first season. That didn't necessarily mean Part 3 was happening.</br>  <br>I saw a good Josuke and a very gay looking Jojolion.<br>Those were about it, though.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Where's  YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO </br></br></br>  <br>Same here.

That cosplay is S tier if her face and hair aren't bad, hard to tell from this angle.</br>  Trash bag dio and the world  <br>There was a picture some anon posted with a dude who pulled a pretty impressive cosplay. Right down to the loincloth</br>  <br><br><br>I was staring at this man , he looks confused</br></br></br>  New chapter out. <br>Yui is going to get rejected isn't she.</br>   It was all a dream   Was going to say first blood, but then I realized Marika already confessed.  So now all the bitches but Chitoge will confess and the faggot will reject them one by one.<br>Then Chitoge will come out with the classic "i loved you since the beginning" and there you go, this shit is over.</br>  The culling of the harem begins. Haru and Tsugumi are already out, and now Yui's terms is coming to an end.<br>Marika and Onodera are all that remain, and then we can be off of Komi's ride.</br>  Of course she's gonna get rejected, you think Komi's gonna let us of that easily?<br><br>My question is: is she gonna somehow be able to stay in Raku's house or this is the arc where she goes away for good?</br></br>  <br>When was Tsugumi rejected?</br>  <br>She's probably going to accept that he doesn't love her that way and marry the other guy.<br>I'd imagine she'll find out that Raku has a crush on Onodera though, as that will probably be his reason for being unable to answer her feelings.<br>That might lead to some interesting developments.<br><br>She wasn't, but she accepted Raku as a worthy man for Chitoge, which I took to mean that she was also bowing out to support their romance, despite having lingering feelings.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think that she will marry the guy. Ie is probably going to give her a more time or something along those lines.</br>  <br>So basically a "Let me think about this" from Raku? <br>It would make sense, since that's exactly how he's treating the situation with Marika.</br></br>  OP's obviously talking about OreGairu, f4gg0t5.  <br> incest </br>  <br>Yukino a shit. A SHIT!</br>  <br>I don't think WSJ will allow the incest.<br><br>They will probably forcible break her away from her little brother ;_;</br></br></br>  How far into the manga does the anime go?  <br>But its not?</br>  <br>Probably about half of the material has been animated. There's still a shit load of material left, but nothing really happens so it's fine.</br>  <br>They are not blood-related though. Also on Raku views her as a sister, Yui doesn't view him as a brother but as love interest.</br>  I think Kosaki has better genes. She's the better breeding girl.  <br>Chitoge has superior Aryan genes.</br>  <br>I can't wait to see how Komi will make it all return to nothing next week.</br>  <br>Kosaki has better blushing genes.<br><br>It allows 26% more efficient breeding than Chitoge.</br></br></br>  <br>Enjoy children with frail bones and weak muscles who are also 5 feet tall at their peak.</br>  <br> Not accepting Chitoge with Aryan master race genes </br>  <br>Fuck off tumblerfag.</br>  <br><br><br>Isn't Chitoge a halfie?</br></br></br>  <br> Liking disgusting gaijin genes. <br> Not choosing superior NIPPON genes <br><br>It's like you're trying to be a heretic</br></br></br></br>  <br>:^)</br>  <br>Even so, Adelt is Aryan while Hana is Japanese. Literally perfect</br>  <br>chapter 105 without counting skipped chapters</br>  <br>I thought Komi was going to milk this arc a lot longer. Didn't expect the confession this fast</br>  <br> Then   Onodera  will come out with the classic "i loved you since the beginning" and there you go, this shit is over.</br>  i mean, we always give crap that nothing ever happens in nisekoi, but i think in this chapter something actually happened  <br>FUCK THIS MANGA OH MY GOD! FUCK THIS SHIT.</br>  <br>Did anyone expect chitobae to lose though?</br>  Place your bets<br> it was all a dream <br> Sorry?
