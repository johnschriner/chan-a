[ Bleach 632.   I want to impregnate Gigi.      Too bad, he's a boy.   yay a whole new chapter about throwaway characters due to be killed in a couple of weeks  I want to take Liltotto to an all you can eat buffet.  NOTHING HAPPENED AGAIN WHO THE FUCK CARES FUCKING KUBO WHEN IS THIS PLOT GOING TO ADVANCE      due to be killed  I'm sure one of them survives.     Why would you put those cunts as a start up image?   Juha choose Hashbrown with a single purpose  Yhwach has the Almighty 1000 years ago    That would be neat.  Also we now know why they invaded hueeco mundo, tpo reclaim their ancient land.        they won't because the world will be different.     As an addition<br/>    Then what will happen when a person dies? where will his soul go?    All this time Aizen was searching for his other half    all those posts about Quincies being born every so many years  Did I skip a page? Panda was being weird on me tonight so I wouldn't be surprised.   So how long ago was this taking place?   One Million years.    maybe there won't be a difference anymore, souls and flesh beings will coexist, and "dying" will just happen when the soul gets destroyed.     One Million years   Are you sure? I could have sworn it was One million, four hundred and twenty three thousand, three hundred and two years ago.      so he just got fed up of looking so he decided to create it.     where will his soul go?  The Universe is still big Anon-kun and I highly doubt that the SK was strong enough to actually create the whole Universe. So perhaps it'll be revealed that the souls in Bleach were all just being blocked from the real afterlife or maybe reincarnation will just happen instantly rather being made to happen.  Did I skip a page? Panda was being weird on me tonight so I wouldn't be surprised.  No people just didn't seem to get that Bazz-B was talking about Jugram and that Incomplete Quincy like him used to be born every ten years and then those incomplete-quincy suddenly stopped being born a 100 years ago.       Bazz is talking about retarded quincies with no abilities. They appear rarely. Jugram is one of those retarded quincies   Other thread is dying, so repost.   I strongly suspect that Yhwach either consciously, or subconsciously awoke the powers of a Quincy within the people he "made whole" and thus they are "whole" Quincies. But still, Yhwach called Haschwalth his firstborn so that implies a blood relation because Jugo was not the first Quincy after Yhwach and he was not the first Sternritter either. He has only called three Quincies for his sons and those were Ichigo, Uryu and Jugo. There's also the matter of trueborn Quincies, they are a thing, Quilge was mentioned to be one and he was much more powerful than the norm on top of having a special high ranking position within Yhwach's army. Apparently Ichigo running into a "trueblood" was bad because it awoke his powers as a Quincy.       retarded quincies with no abilities  Like Ichigo     I am still intrigued by how does hell fit in all of this, because either kubo has forgotten or he just don't give a fuck and won't take it into account.    Unwhole Quincies would be a better term.     hell   yawach killing millions of people and survives waging wawr   he is part human   when a human that has done wrong dies he gets taken to hell   I think kubo will pull a door of hell appearing to stab yawach when he is defeated.          I am still intrigued by how does hell fit in all of this, because either kubo has forgotten or he just don't give a fuck and won't take it into account.  Kubo said a long time that he didn't want to include a Hell Arc as his idea was to depressing or something like that; so we likely won't ever get anything about Hell beyond the Movie or a future Databook entry. But we could always get lucky and Kubo could bring up how Hell wasn't connected to any of the Dimensions because it was made by a higher power than the SK near the end.      Yep      either kubo has forgotten  I doubt he's forgotten the time he tried to make a movie about it but they "lost" his script and made a different one.    Are the Sternritters over 1000 years old? Do they live in another dimension or something?   If we accept that Sternritter's powers come from trauma, Ichigo would fit the bill too (I want to have the power to fight destiny and save everybody because my mom died and I couldn't do shit)  So, did  inner Ywatch make  Ichigo  whole?     So, are Quincies humans? Or have we just been assuming that they were all along? Was there world decimated after the war, and the surviving members driven to the living world?  Is that why they were so fixated on being pure?     Yeah what I mean is not a hell arc, but how is all this SK stuff is affecting hell if at all.   that would be neat.       Kubo get out of this thread. I've had way too much kuboing already    Ichigo is not whole, if he doesn't have the badge to suppress his powers he will spontaneously start awakening spirit potential in those around him. The trauma also does not define his powers, his powers are a mystery aside from the fact that they act and awful lot like Yhwach's own. Complete with the passive regen, stupid high reiatsu and dual personas.   It might be possible that White is Ichigo's other half and thus he becomes whole, but they're like a jigzaw and not formally one entity. Perhaps only a complete hollowfication and permanent melding of the souls into a transcendent entity will make him whole.       bazz-b forest was burned his power is fire   as nodt was afraid to die so his power is fear.   lloyd and royd never had their own identities so they can assume other's identities.   let's theorize:  thunderbolt was electrocuted.   pepe was never loved   vaar was poisoned   gremmy was a paraplegic that couldn't do anything.   bambietta was a sex addict but she never had any orgasm so her power is to send out explosions,   gigi was surrounded by death and probably almost drowned in blood.   lintotto was a bullimic/anorexic.   opie could never control anything in his life so he got a power of ultimate control: a cage.   meninas was probably weak and delicate.   superstar was never cheered by anyone.                   I miss Candice.  Btw, is Meninas still alive?      It's a solid theory:  Quincies are its own race   Live in pre-Yama Hueco Mundo   Magic Hunters, defend against hollows   Quincies wage war against SS   Yama rekts them, holocausts Hueco Mundo, goyim remember the ten trillion skellingtons   Haschwalth flees to the Shadow Realm with braindead Ywach and the survivors of the early Sternritters   some other survivors hide on Earth   time passes   Quincy mix with humans, and get tainted by hollows, getting half-breeds   Shinigami purge quincies on Earth, Mayuri goes Mengele   Only Ishida's family remains                Maybe Final Getsuga Tensho is him temporally achieving Wholeness  Moreso considering for that he needs to fuse with InnerYwach and HollowZangetsu       how is all this SK stuff is affecting hell if at all.  Well, like I said we could get lucky if that's all you wanted. But, we'd still have to bet on Kubo's statement of not wanting show his depressing Hell, as only him not wanting to draw it and that he still thought about mentioning it later.     Lets go deeper     bambi was frigid/asexual  well that explains everything     no. liltoto would have saved her over gigi if that was the case.   Why do quincies ride horses when they can move a lot faster than any horse? Unless they are special magic horses.    even his personal guard soldiers bowed down to his reihatsu   horse didn't give a shit   Bleach final fight literally confirmed to be Horse vs Chair.       That's just a makeshift transformation, the result of his Quincy origin merging with his other half and then handing him that power. I doubt that is his final form, but an in between stage. It will probably look different now that Zangetsu is the dominant entity.    Those techniques were developed after the shinigami-quinci war    Because they are fans of Hokuto no Ken Didn't you see Bazz with the roman helmet?      those eyes.  how often do you think jugo got raped as a child?     oops wrong quote    the Horse looks like Rukia    Looking at Haschwalth I really can't blame his uncle.     &gt;pepe was never loved  we meme now     It's a bit different because Aizen was a key player in the events that lead to Ichigo's birth. It makes sense that he has kept an eye on Ichigo.    Haoushoku no Haki  BRAVO KUBO R A V O       Relevant to currrent chapter.      &gt;bambietta was a sex addict but she never had any orgasm so her power is to send out explosions,  This I like   This I can fap to  superstar was never cheered by anyone.  His biggest fan was himself          all the things that shirosaki said are the way of life of Yawach  KUBO U B O         The roar was never listened   the question never got a chance to learn/get an education   cang du was cut up   nanana was blind   robert was never chosen   niazol could never get near anyone   barro was target of an assasination   pernida was crushed by a steamroller   the robot was just an experiment   welp it can fit, there ar eprobably mistakes but three's a pattern right here, same as the espada where the espects of death, the sternritters are probably aspects of grief or loss or some shit like that.               Barro was shot because he is a nigger     When was the last time we saw her? Wasn't it when Pepe took over her and Liltot took her out? It wasn't really clear then if she died but I guess she must've later when Yhwach took everyone's powers.    do you need any more reason?    Liltotto was not aware of the holocaust and Gigi was next to her, she reacted quickly.   Wonderful.      Where are all these pre Sternritter Quincies now?   skeletons in yama's bankai    Why is she so cute?     barro was target of an assasination  How about this? A member of Barro's family or something close to him was the best shot in his hometown and Barro wanted to be just like that person but couldn't even hit a grazing Cow. Then one day he finally hit a moving target and went brag to the person he admired only to see them be executed right as he got home. He then tried to shoot the murderer but missed every shot and was then nearly beaten to death after that. Eventually he was found by Yhwach a few years later as he was dying from wounds he got while taking his revenge on the individual who killed the person he admired.     She cares for her friends and kills the rapists from the 11th division.   Two sides  of the same coin  Any hypothesis toward BG9 (The K)and Robert Accutron (The N) powers ?    yfw yawach used them to learn about yamaoto's bankai.     His flowing robes are in the form of a swastika   I don't get it. This chronicle happened before or after the war between Yama and Ywach ?   right before it. We see those living quncies now, but they later became part of Yama's bankai, which Yama used against YH 1000 years ago    so we won't see the genocide of 200 years ago    Thank. So Jugo and Bazz-B have more than 1000 y o ?     KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO confirmed for 4chan         there are whole and hollow quincy too  Kubo       liltotto nearly starved gigi suffered a lot of loss (hence the 'id be sad if u werent around Bambi' line) gremmy was stephen hawking       Gerard hoped for a miracle Xaxis  was gay  Pernida was paralysed        gremmy should have been someone uncreative or without imagination that suffered because of that, the pattern I'm guessing is that yawach granted them power out of something that damaged them.    i think its different. from what the Bambitches implied Yhwach will reward those who earn it by making their wishes come true. Thats why i think Meninas was poor and thus powerless. her Yhwach wish was a stately home     master slave dialectic   damn...      Your top 3 SR : 1)Lille Barro 2)Mdm 3)Askin     Its that damn 6 pointed star again! What does it mean!?  Another week, another shit chapter.  Wow, we learned Bazz-B attacked a soldier and Jugram met Ywach.  Holy fuck, amazing reveals.        BG9  the (loli) Kabob     im more surprised that he was a reiatsu monster. we havent seen him like that before.    keep up   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</wbr></wbr>   Just realized his Bankai outfit is Neo's from Reloaded. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sI-<wbr>Ow2nLPHI</wbr>  [ ]   Starrk was probably ranked #1 because he unconsciously reminded Aizen of himself: stupidly powerful, but also very lonely. If you notice, Aizen steps in right after Starrk dies.   That also applies to Urahara, Gin, Tousen, and his parents, but those five never said they'd eat Ichigo. Aizen's might be Urahara; the Batman to his Superman.   Maybe he picked it up from OMZ. He seems to listen to him despite their difference in power. Maybe White is the reincarnation of Bach's horse?   Pernida was an aylmao who asploded in the vacumm of space so his power is to collapse things inwards instead.   Also anyone have a good image of the Mugetsu color page cutting through time? Preferably no watermark.   Last thought: Perhaps Ichigo has another half and to defeat Bach he needs to absorb said half. Who do we know is compatible with Ichigo's reiatsu, routinely powers him up, motivates him when he's upset, has numerous parallels to him, and looks remarkably similar to Tensa Zangetsu?                          shaddap frodo    Jewish God brandishing a six-pointed star. Why indeed?     Last thought: Perhaps Ichigo has another half and to defeat Bach he needs to absorb said half.  This is where the noob from the arc's beginning comes in.      Perhaps Ichigo has another half and to defeat Bach he needs to absorb said half.  ICHIGO IS HIS OWN OTHER HALF YOU STUPID FUCKING LEVEL 0 WE ALREADY FINISHED THAT ARC       Hashbrows is blonde you fucktard       dresses like a slut   swears every 5 seconds   shouts, never speaks calmly   face stuck in a grimace, 3edgy5me   is American  Worst girl.        Can they stop with these flashbacks from irrelevant literalwho's I wanna see shit go down already. This shit is dragged out so fucking much.  Let me see Aizen in action already     Possibly to weed out those who could not withstand his reiatsu. It's a decent test of strength, his proto-Sternritter lackeys were still standing after all.    thats him hollowfied you fucknut. use your brain for a second.    ywach was never the real villain      tfw best grill is a tranny      Because they are the King and his army. Respect their fucking authoritah.     how often do you think jugo got raped as a child?  How many days are there since he was born?      black eyelashes  Nice try, but ultimately futile.       It has been said that it was young yhwach you piece of shit.     So is she dead or what?     espada and hollowsand other arrancar       Perhaps Ichigo has another half and to defeat Bach he needs to absorb said half    I already said it  <br/>        Why is Kubo so good at drawing fuckable little boys?      We know that Haschwald is talentless in Quincy techniques  We know theres a hieracrchy within the Quincy that go from 3,5,6 pointed stars  3 being the quincys that take over the human lands 5 being the quincy that take soul society 6 being the people that have penetrated heaven  We know that Yhwh was searching for Jugo and selected him as his Next in command  Haschwald while talentless could stand up to Yhwh as a child              Undead. though we're probably going to get told kyoraku asked gigi to unzombify his soldiers if they wanted a ride to wahrwelt   Weekly reminder that Ukitake's still a bloodless corpse lying in the SS floor  I'm so fucking sick of mid-battle flashbacks about characters no one gives a flying fuck about and said characters always redeeming themselves because Kubo has no balls to actually kill anyone.  Gonna drop this shit again. Someone call me when we're a few chapters away from the end.     Anyone else think these women and that man are sexy?    fuck you ;_;    shop his dead body there or a skelly    no ;_;    I want to molest little Jugo. My cute Jugo    Oh and its rare that a Quincy that cant use reishi is born and when such a quincy is born they are selected  Haschwald is one of those few Quincys that cant control reishi      A of of people say Meninas looks too much like Orihime but honestly there's a lot of sameface in this manga already so I like her more than most. I like the rest too.   Why didn't Rukia remember her first mission? What exactly was said between them when Ichigo was unconscious in chapter 1, and when he was fighting the Menos? Why did Rukia decide to leave right after that? And what about during the fullbring arc, when Urahara gave her the reiatsu sword?   And most importantly, is Inuzuri, Rukia's hometown, in Urahara's domain of Western Rukongai? Don't tell me...   Jugram a cute, fuck you         Where were when Jugo's smile had to be protected from hs rapist uncle /a/ ?    quincy is a human who uses reishi as a weapon    quincy born who cant use it    he's a shinigami          Hollow doesn't count: it's his sword and only half of it at that. According to you, Aizen's already absorbed his double and Rukia/Renji/Byakuya more or less did the same when they realized "the sword is me." Ichigo "died" after Deicide. Rukia's turn to die now.   Aizen did say he wanted to eat him before he left for SS.          Who in the hell redeemed themselves  Nnoitras flash back was him claiming to be a warrior but sneak attacking Nel  Barragan had the entirety of his army wiped out in a blink of an eye  Starrk killed almost everyone he was near just by existing           muh rookia   Back to deathberry      I feel creep out inside reading that page.    Its because of the boobs you idiot   <br/>    all shinigamies, imitation of quincies     Every other chick in this manga has huge boobs. Its the boobs, hair, and lips. She's like Orihime if Orihime could actually fight, no wonder I like her.     all humansare shinigami or quincies   school uniforms look pretty quincy-ish       Niggastream scans are out. Is it just me, or does it look like Yhwach is using his eye powers in these panels?     implying his shadow isn't controlling the new soulking at this very moment   implying he isn't the final villain  Reminder that yhwhs eyes are covered by the kamikage. Are you really sure he absorbed it?         Why is he so beautiful? I want to embrace him.  It's a shame Kubo will probably kill him off.         i thought so too    despite all the women in bleach with developed bodies and personalities, this is why I question this thread's sexuality    K probably was the Knowledge  N I have no idea.Grimaniel, his volstandig, means the Walk of God, and he teleported behind Kyoraku, so its probably some kind of movement related power.  Maybe Nimble, Nail, Needle?   Oh fuck, nice catch This chapter had 3 pointed star, 5 pointed (sternritter reveal), and 6 pointed (Ywach)            It's just you.  Btw in niggastream's scans it says "such a quincy hadn't been born in hundreds of years" not "one hundred years"      I wonder if the memories of Yhwach are where Zangetsu got the "King &amp; Horse" mentality.    It also corrects mangapanda's 10 years statement, yeah. As we assumed it was just a rushed translation job.    I'd a Jugo.     gremmy was a paraplegic that couldn't do anything  Rather  Gremmy suffered from braindamage after being reduced to one and had problems thinking  Best power ruined by being stupid.      Shingeki no kyojin thread.  The second recap movie will include a new scene at the end to make the link with season 2. https://twitter.com/anime_shingeki/<wbr>status/613880929078022144  A new trailer has been posted and includes the opening ("price of freedom") composed by Revo. Looks like they animated the flashback from chapter 44 where Annie's kicks Eren's ass and defies Mikasa. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eMF<wbr>9WkDiuCM&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ] [Embed]   </wbr>       Looks like they animated the flashback from chapter 44 where Annie's kicks Eren's ass and defies Mikasa.  That's a weird idea. The flashback was perfect where it was. Now there will be even less Annie in season 2. Still hoping to see this scene animated.      The second recap movie will include a new scene at the end to make the link with season 2.  Trying to patch up their plot holes with tiny bandages?     I'll gladly take more Annie    It looks like the flashback during Eren Titan vs Armored Titan fight.    They will probably retcon the wall revelation to make it closer to the manga. Hopefully the movie ends with the hord of titans leaving Ragako, and a little sign of Monkey Trouble's presence.   On an unrelated note, Hazuki Kanae will be drawing an LM pinup in shoujo style for Dessert magazine.  http://natalie.mu/comic/news/151703<wbr> https://twitter.com/kanaehazuki </wbr>       I can't wait till that bitch annie gets whats coming to her.    That's interesting.  What's up with these stuff lately?     What stuff?    Meant to     First the two covers, then the SM thing, not this shoujo pinup     Too successful for it's own good. I'm already SnKed out.    *Now.  captcha dick biscuit      Which covers are you talking about? The bessatsu one? Aria? Frau? Newtype? Animage? Brutus?    There's all these? I'm talking about the eye sex one and the one from the recent chapter?     the eye sex one  u wot m8      the eye sex one   Which is that?      This one.     Isn't that because their Ackerman stronk connection?    It's a joke.    Oh, I see.  I never know when LMfags are joking.  Can't wait to see what the pinup thing looks like.    I guess now that the spotlight is on the Ackermen, do you guys think there will be further onscreen discussion between LM on the topic?   Hopefully not. It should be more of a background side thing if anything.    Speak for yourself, I want to see it.    When they finally have the talk, you can be sure anons will talk a lot about it.    Yeah, it will be mainly retarded shitposting.    Few people here shitposts,  just the ones who are constantly butthurt about something     I know, but I am invested in their relationship and maybe learning more about Mikasa. Who would've thought in 2015 the most annoying shippers on /a/ would be LevixMikasa?    They're bound to discuss it, but is the spotlight really gonna be on them? I was hoping for some BRMT shenanigans but it might give away too much.     They're bound to discuss it, but is the spotlight really gonna be on them?  I'm just talking about the current controversy about the SM kiss in the live action film. Obviously the spotlight is on MT, as far as the plot is concerned.       I'm surprised it still didn't started.    And what is that link, the flashback with Annie fighting Mikasa? It doesn't make much sense and it should be much later in the series.    Finally. But why does it look like a later scene? They can't remove it from the anime, can they?     They will not erase the last scene, it will be more like a link between seasons.     Who would've thought in 2015 the most annoying shippers on /a/ would be LevixMikasa  Compared to some other shipperfags, they're really not the most annoying. LMfags are generally quiet unless something relating to the characters together comes up.  Also who uses nameXname anymore? Just say LM      That will be an improvement but it won't ease the butthurt caused by the many other things they've changed for the worse.    So damn sick of Levi and Mikasa, the most overrated characters. Wish we could get other characters in the focus for a change.    No, they are very annoying as are manletfags and Tumblrfags in general and a big part of why these threads are much worse now.    They used to be extremely obnoxious, even if nothing happened. Now they're a little bit more quiet. Anyway they're still obnoxious.    I blame the political arc.    I blame shit taste, politics arc, and continuing to make these threads when it is unneeded.     I find EMfags to be ten times more obnoxious. One even tried to make an EM thread yesterday, and they do shit like that very often. For some reason anons hardly complain about them.      For real, it's been a long time that I've seen an LMfag complaining about anything.     Mikasa is overrated but she isn't really the focus.    I think you're all annoying. EM, LM and especially Mikasa are all equally shit.    I think EHfags are by far the most obnoxious shipperfags. LMfags are pretty tame.    No, see the YHfag who has been shitting the threads for 1 year now.No one can surpass him.    EH isn't even an actual thing and no one is really an EHfag. They're just LMfags doing it to annoy the other retarded shipperfags so in the end it goes back to the Ackershit autists.    This. Although some of them are the same people.    That goes without saying, this one was by far the worst shitposter ever on /snk/.    YHfags and BRYHfags in general are so much more quieter because of the hate.    Don't tell me you're retarded enough to actually believe that.    There isn't any hate, just a vocal retard. See    Which one? YHfags have been pretty quiet.    Don't tell me you're retarded enough to believe "HELMfags" aren't just LMfags looking for more excuses to pretend that many people here care about Levi or Mikasa.    You're the one pretending that x are shitposters because you're mad at something.    Good one. Unless you've been here for a week.    Well even YHfags hated that retard.    If you think most shipperfags here aren't just shitposters then you're in denial now fuck off back to Tumblr    This.    What the hell does LM have to do with EH? How would being an EHfag be an "excuse"? How would shitposting about EH make people care about LM? If LMfags wanted to shitpost they'd do it with a ship they like. You're more delusional than EH and LM fags combined.    Not him but I rarely see YHfags here now. In fact Ymirfags and Historiafags have this weird hate for each other and hardly get along. Individually they're probably the worst characterfags here but at least they usually only attack each other.    It's to "make room" for their own delusional ship. A lot of delusional shipperfags do that    It's kind of true. I see no one claiming that it's going to happen for example.    HELMfags, retard.     they usually only attack each other   only  Sure.      Looks like you weren't here last spoiler week or is just on damage control.     or is just on damage control  Probably, Ymifags tend to cause shit all over the place in every possible place and then pretend it never happened.     You're kidding, right?    There are generally more people here for spoiler week and the most butthurt came from EMfags.    You're only talking about one or two vocal shitposters.     LMfags trying to divert the attention to Ymirfags     That's just what you think because of one or two retards.    I really think that's the other way around.    Pay more attention will you? Even /u/ is pretty tame about the situation. Most have accepted that YH has possibly sunk.    Yeah, I noticed it too.     Most have accepted that YH has possibly sunk.  Not really, they just don't care about what happened in ch70 and don't overreact.     I hate Ymir and her fags but I'll agree with you here. HELMfags are the biggest shitposters and should stop pointing finger to other fags when they are the ones derailing threads all the time.     If they added any Annie scenes it should have been the one of Annie offering to teach Eren.  The Annie/Mikasa fight should be in season 2.     I've been reading through /u/ and that's not what I saw. At least, except for one drama queen anon, they aren't whining.     WHERE IS THE TENSION?   they chose to animate a scene that happens later instead of animating the one they left out before    why.jpg        I doubt it.    As happy as I am about more Annie, this makes no sense. Are they planning to make Levi Eren's mental anchor during the AT fight?  Everything will be atoned for if it turns out her smile was included as well, though   ;_;     This confirms that S2 will have no Annie in it at all.    I miss the days when HELM was Hanji, Erwin, Levi and Mike. Best HELM.        This confirms that S2 will have no Annie in it at all.  Fuck this gay earth.     She's still in the flashbacks for B&gt;A in the 47 and 49 scenes. Those will probably be still frames so its not going to be a lot really, but she's technically in the season   The only thing I can think of is they're including the scene to tease at an Eren/Annie romantic relationship and are trying to build up a bit of a love triangle thing with Mikasa so the eventual reveal, Eren's reluctance to fight and Mikasa fighting the Female Titan has more tension behind it because there's romantic reasons as well as just Annie being an enemy Titan.   So this will be shown before or right after the scene where Mikasa asks Eren if he has feelings for Annie.    I hate Ymir and Ymirfags usually too but they're very quiet now compared to shipperfags    To be honest I think they are doing it in order to prevent people from choosing EA by lessening the impact before that part happens. When it will happen in S2 people will be like 'meh, I've seen this" and the hype will go down. Was Araki in charge of this again?     I don't care about either HELM, just wish there was less shitposting about pairings here.    I think it's to imply even further that Annie likes Eren, to increase drama for their fightning. Some people could have missed it the first time, so the fightning didn't have the same impact to them.    Hardly anyone even cares about EA. it didn't really catch on, people went for AA instead.    Only EMfags went for AA. EM and AA have a lot of fanart, while EA doesn't, its no coincidence.    Blame the anime for that.   Who LH here?   They would've chosen the scenes they left out if that was the case.   EA had very few going on in the anime. A single episode is enough for some people who have lost interest in this to like something.  Araki is going on his way to crush everything.         Didn't the anime also add a scene with Armin shouting something at Annie after she transformed?    If it weren't for /a/ I wouldn't have noticed anything romantic between EA. I still don't think there's anything romantic going on.    Is it confirmed there'll be only this new scene? But this scene serves the same purpose as that one and also links to season 2, so this is better to animate.    What makes you think EA would have caught on with a bit more focus? Eren het doesn't catch on much, aside from EM and that's the main pairing and not even his most popular pairing.    Yeah, he taunted her to try and kill him if I'm remembering correctly.    The oficial high school spinoff has Annie lusting for Eren's dick, so yeah she likes him.    The same spinoff that has Frieda lusting after Historia.    That, moe scenes with Mikasa, replaced Armin with Mikasa, etc. I was googling to find this pic of Mikasa and this came up. Lel.     The flashback scene also ties into Eren's fight with Reiner though. It sets up how Eren's able to beat him.    If animefags could have seen pic related EA would be way more popular. You can't see that smile and deny the two of them would be cute as fuck together.       And I forgot the pic    But this one is a better tease. Ans they ve throwing "who would you chose?" when it actually matters.    But it is true.    I still don't think it would have become popular. For some reason AA is what became popular.    Is that why she likes Eren now? Because he has Frieda inside him?    Japanese EMfags made AA popular, anon. They want Annie out of the way.    Other day I read that Grisha and Carla didn't adopted Mikasa, they just take care of her and they happened to live in the same house. Eren and Mikasa aren't siblings in any way or form at all.    He's also brave, charming and said he likes her.     I noticed that every time someone hates on Ymir or Ymirfags, someone always fingerpoints and someone replies this exact thing to him. Why are you so retarded and why are you so quick to jump on shitty metafaggotry?     Anniefags like it too though.    will it be a 2 minute clip of historia looking wistfully at eren?    This is true though. They aren't siblings.    Anniefags don't like AA. It's either EA or BA, EA mostly.    The fuck are you talking about fag?    They're adoptive siblings.    No. It's complete trash. Arminfags are the ones who push that shit, not Anniefags.    Anniefags all over Japan and in other places like AA. /a/ is the only place I've seen where they're so against it.     Eren   charming      Historia doesn't even interact with Eren at all during that point in time.    Exactly what I wrote. Ymirfags fingerpoint all the fucking time because they're butthurt no one else likes her. I bet they never get their fingerpointing right but they always circlejerk about how right they are.    Yes but not blood related. Grisha didn't adopt Mikasa either so you could even argue that they're not even adoptive siblings.    Arminfags tend to like JAr or EAr. It's Anniefags who like AA.    Isn't Ymir the most popular character here though, she's always the first place in polls and all anyone talks about at /u/ and the other place   I hope this finishes up soon. If I finish this, finish watching this season of Nisekoi (then read the manga for some closure) all my backlog and current shows will be done.   Eren is charming, handsome, brave and kind. Not at all like that brute Reiner.     Grisha didn't adopt Mikasa either  Grisha brought her to his house and treated her like his own daughter. That, my dear anon, is adoption.     She's not but she's not as hated as people make it out to seem.    Most Anniefags like Annie as a character  and some for themselves.     Jean pls. Stop trying to pretend EH happening will make Mikasa like you.    He took an abandoned orphan and gave her a place to live at. That's not the definition of adoption. And even so, they only lived together for 1 year. How does that make it wrong?    I would think that Anniefags would like Annie.    Jewnie gonna get REKT    EH is endgame faggot. By now is clear the Historia is perfect for Eren and they marry and become king and queen.    Araki pushed both EM and AA while undermining Eren and Annie's relationship. EA would definitely be more popular if the anime were loyal to the manga in that regard.     He took an abandoned orphan and gave her a place to live at. That's not the definition of adoption.  Really? So what's the definition of adoption to you? Because from everything I've leran that's adoption in it's root.   To take on the responsibilities as parent of (a child that is not one's biological child).        mikasa is a fucking autistic slut in any case    *Learn.    He also replaced Armin with Mikasa in several scenes.    Funny how you only take the first sentence and ignore the rest of it.   Adoption usually refers to the legal process of becoming a non-biological parent   the legal process  Mikasa was never legally adopted. She isn't signed as Grisha and Carla's adopted daughter on official papers. They simply took her in and that's it.       She's just a girl who doesn't know better. She would be happy if she made out with someone handsome like Jean.     legally adopted   On the Walled cities   Implying they even know what a layer is   Implying  This is'nt modern society.        Wow seriously? People talk about Ymir on /u/? That's shocking!    And Levi.     pin up  That's nice     Except that Historia is asexual or a lesbian.    The concept of marriage exists so it's not far fetched to think that the act of officially adopting children applies there too.    &gt;Implying they even know what a layer is  They have doctors and they have judges. Why again wouldn't there be lawyers?       I wasn't saying it like a bad thing, no need to be an autist Ymirfag    They took Mikasa into their care and no one said nothing about it. So if there is really lawyers and legal adoption, they did it.     Ymir is so popular she's all they talk about on /u/!     The concept of marriage exists since way before the medieval era.    Again being butthurt for nothing, what's so bad about saying she's popular there?    Well and Historia, which makes sense. I remember someone complaining that no one discusses other characters beside these two.    I don't get that. Why don't they just bring up what they want to talk about then? People just default to YH for obvious reasons. Well right now all they argue over is Dumblr art anyway.    Not him, but you made it sound like it's weird that they do that.    It's canon that Hanji is fucking disgusting and never washes. There is no way manlet would go near her vagina/penis or whatever smelly shit she has between her legs. Like seriously, I can see him romantically with a variety of characters from Petra to Erwin, but with Hanji I can only see them as friends, because of that.    Not really, you're just being paranoid    This is true though. Mikasa lived with them for one year and they didn't adopt her as she kept her name. You can dislike EM for tons of reasons, main one being Eren himself, but the 'incest' argument is fucking retarded.   Those new character bios for Historia and Eren were pure shipper bait.   Even while being smelly the tranny is too good for the manlet anyway.    What new character bios?    So is it true that this movie confirmed Jean and Mikasa? I think it is.    I think Mikasa is more of the problem with EM than Eren is. It's not Eren's fault he actually cares about other people aside from MA and it would be annoying to have someone the same age as you try to mother you.    probably some hetfag delusions, ignore it    The one that has Eren 'admiring Historia'    I never saw that one. When was that posted?    Nice try retconning canon EM, Isayama.    I'm not caught up but does Eren even know Historia?   I find it hard to believe that Eren could be nice to a girl or even compliment her after all we've seen him do to Mikasa.      you were implying that that makes her popular. it's not weird that people on /u/ discuss the main yuri ship    They give her food, they give her clothes, they give her a new home, they treated her like she was their own daughter, but no, they totally did not adopt her. They would need some papers for that.    And? He also admires Levi. Then again that's one of the reasons fujos ship EL.    Reiner is the Armored Titan Berthold is the Big Guy For You Titan Ymir is a Trans-African Titan Historia is royalty and her dad is the King and also a Titan       I'm not caught up either but I know they had a bit of a bonding moment where Eren said he prefered her as Historia over Krista. Still, having him admire her seems like a stretch. Far as I know she hasn't really done anything worth admiring, especially from someone like Eren.     I find it hard to believe that Eren could be nice to a girl or even compliment her after all we've seen him do to Mikasa.  He only treats Mikasa like that because he views her as his sister / family. He is very nice and calm around Historia. When he looks at Historia, he is even able to ignore Jean's agitating troll remarks.  Makes you think.....       Jean also mentioned that the two of them often "hold hands" while they're alone together.    Mostly because anyone talking about anything other than YH either gets ignored or shunned out  People are tired if that. YH is old and boring.      He didn't say often.    So you want people to talk about MA?    Anything is more interesting than YH.     The story progresses if you keep reading.     Read     I agree but if you say that on /u/ the same butthurt Ymirfags from here jump on you and start whining and fingerpointing as usual.    If people don't respond to you it's because they don't have anything to say that's of worth or because they don't like the same pairing you do. It doesn't necessarily mean that you're not allowed to talk about it. Especially the post you linked to is an indication of that, there are no Mikasa/Sasha gifs as far as I know.     I find it hard to believe that Eren could be nice to a girl or even compliment her after all we've seen him do to Mikasa  That's exactly because it was Mikasa.     Why would people talk about it though? You think it has a possibility of happening?    Holy shit, stop overreacting you retard. Calling someone popular isn't an insult. Not everyone is out to hate on Ymir    of course, YH is canon just like EM, whether Isayama likes it or not    It's more interesting.    I was talking about MA. Then again you don't even know what a bee is.    Then bring it up what you want to talk about, retard. If people are interested they will reply. You can change topics without causing butthurt or acting butthurt yourself since for the most part everyone there is chill.   What's MA? Mikasa/Armin or Mikasa/Annie?   I guess that's why you never talk about it and expect other people to start a discussion.    Eren and Historia even take naps together. Which should say they're probably more like siblings if they're comfortable enough to do that.    I bring it up but no one replies, all they talk about is yummy currrryyyy.    Why not? That scene in the trailer was nice.    Hot. Ymir and Historia bore me to death. This I can fap to all day every day.     I bring it up but no one replies  For example?     Then no one cares about it. You can't force people to care. I personally don't because I don't like yuri for the sake of yuri and that's exactly what MA is but I don't care if others want to post it.    So wht, Ymir and Historia take naps together all the time except Ymir's BBC is inside her cunt while they napping.     for the most part everyone there is chill  Joke of the month. They get butthurt all the time, even more than the Ymir thread on the other place. Ymirfags get butthurt over everything everywhere.  It was great and I hope people would talk about it more. I'm afraid that means less Annie or MA in season 2, unless they reuse the scene there. If not, it means worse pacing or more filler.       It's in previous threads    It's completely out of character, but the author has had Eren not only call Historia amazing but hold her hand as well. Historia is also always around Eren and blushing.    The tension between the two is nice to watch.    Mikasa/Armin is mostly abbreviated as AM.    So they sleepfuck?    YH is plain and boring. /u/ is for everything    What's the context of this?    All that hate fucking must be wonderful, my dick is diamonds    No one is stopping you from talking about other yuri pairings.    Then stop talking about YH. I go there and it never fails. It's either a war between Ymir and Historiafags or a boring fanart dump. Where's the delicious MA?     being this butthurt    I really hope we get a season 3 so we can get more Annie, since she'll barely be in season 2.   I'm sort of hoping they add a filler scene or two in season 2 of crystalised Annie. Maybe showing the Survey Corp attempting to get her out, or having Eren go visit her.     The funniest thing is when they claim there's no shitflinging there or at the other place, and if you look there's shitflinging only from Ymirfags in every one of these places.    What the hell. If you want to talk about something else then just bring it up, it's as simple as that. Logically not many people will be interested but there could be one or two anons out there that might have the same interest as you. No one's going to stop discussing the most relevant yuri ship just because you don't like it.    I really hope you're just pretending to be retarded.    I don't care for Ymir and the idiocy surrounding her usually but please stop fingerpointing at them over everything. It's just as annoying as they can be.    YHfags always fight among one another for no reason at all. chapter 70's release was simply hilarious    Well, I can see why that anon is bored, since the YH ship only have the muh lgbt pairing thing for them, it's not even interesting or fapable, and most of the art posted there is of tumblr with a terrible art style and a wrong representation of Ymir.    Blushing means NOTHING, NOTHING. EM/YH is canon canon canon canon!!    That was just one drama queen.    It was not YHfags fighting. It was retarded EHfags shitposting left and right while whining about YHfags.    This. Her face only got red because of the heat. She looked down because of the sun.     manga   lgbt  You wot       Blushing means NOTHING  Yeah, it doesn't mean anything when you get complimented.     That was just one anon and people told him to fuck off with the cancerous art.    Keep telling yourself that, most Ymirfags are just like that.     Sasha loves and wants to marry YH     It was YHfags whining about how the spoilers were wrong and Isayama was a sellout, and we making fun of their butthurt.    People keep claiming YHfags were butthurt when most were pretty calm meanwhile it was EMfags getting pissed.    Not really.   It's here  Oh great, character focus on girls that were never looked at    193 leechers   1 seed  I would suggest waiting about an hour       show was way too short and rushed   5 years later release useless retarded OVA  don't even gonna watch fuck them        5 years   Fuck, really? I can still vividly remember all the threads. What ever happened to that VN they announced they were making?   It looks like they're actually trying to make a full length title rather than the fanservice I expected.        Released next Friday. Part 1 of 6 planned.  Angel Beats is back, baby. Vocal hipster faggots gonna get mad but cant be helped.     That fucking CG, holy shit.   They'll clearly be getting focus in the VN    what the fuck ?       Next Friday? It's out tomorrow retard.    What kind of VN is it going to be?    Probably a nakige   So /a/, the hype created months ago literally fall flat as fuck after this shit of an ova. srsly, NGE reference.. i was waiting for the sonic prism power yell of her, fortunately she didn't. but let's keep our shit and shattered dreams back for a seccond.   to be continued   wait, what? will we get another shitty ova?         Why do you think it was bad? What were you expecting?   Ohwow. Even the first seconds were QUALITY   at least i wasn't expecting bad cgi animations and references and maybe a few otonashi x tenshi moments if you really want to know.    What`s going on in this image?    pleasure    Looking back at the last ova they released it was pretty obvious that this one was gonna be the same or even worse. The only thing to look forward to is the visual novel.   Anyone else play the demo? I'm rather liking it and the interface so far.   Would love to but I can't read moonrune. Any possibility of it being localized or released in english?    Any mini games in the demo or have they been confirmed?   So Yuri's been there for a few decades. Is she granny level?   Wait she's having a diarrhea?    well, think about the stuff, she gets fed with.    You picked lolicon right, right???    Girls don't poop.    You know it.   can we have a bathroom thread? been awhile since the last one   Get out. NOW    Good, I'll probably play it like 2 weeks after it comes out. Since i'm busy nowadays.     it's been 5 years since Angel Beats aired       They're probably trying to remind people that this series exists and to not forget to buy their VN soon.    Indeed. Time sure flies, and you regret what you did during all those years. That time I didn't have internet and leeched out on other neighbor's wifi, and it was when I hit my greatest depression phase that I thought I would never get out.    Is she going to poopoo?    I picked Phantom Killer    Explosive diarrhea.    B-but girls don't do that.    Of course not. Rest easy my friend, it's a fact.    They fart too, did you know, anon-kun?    No they don't.    Shhh, stop lying.    Yes, sekine a cute    GirlDeMo members other than Iwasawa appear in thr demo?    You can go to the GirlDeMo practice twice, I think, I went to one, I didn't go to the second one the time it gave me the choice.  They appear, but only Iwasawa has a route confirmed in first beat.     What was the point of this?   All 4 of them are    I tried to go at Iwasawa map spot during the night but the homo Hinata didnt let me. "They already finished practicing" he said, that goddamn homo.     tfw homo route  I don't know why matsuhita makes me feel the most uncomfortable about the guys, like I'd be okay with getting gay with hinata or the shota guy  and obviously TK , but matsuhita just feels wrong     Goto /e/ or /d/ if you want to have that sort of thread.    You probably have repressed bara fantasies. Also: Matsuhita naked sprite with man nipples.   Is Otonashi voiced in the VN?   No    Not in the trial, but he will have voice in certain parts during the full game. Kinda like Kotarou and Rin.      Actually you can make Otonashi go full homo on Hinata if you choose " I do " when Hinata asks if you swing that way. of course Otonashi didn't get the meaning and answered anyway.    1) To spark some interest in the first VN volume this week 2) To change the anime art style to match it for the inevitable remake/continuation     when did the first OVA get released?  I'm looking for it from BlubberSubs but I can't find it? did they not sub it?       WEAK SAUCE    threesome route with Tenshi and her twin is all but confirmed, right?   ya a vn that will be out 5 years later   Do you love the Earth?  This OVA was great. That TK. That chuuni Kana Hana.  I felt like I was in 2010 again.     you'll never meet Michael Rivas (TK) in Japan    Feels bad. All he literally does is travel around Japan taking in the sights and randomly voicing a small role once in a blue moon.    Actually Anon I beg of you to come back and seed that ep for me.     they said all SSS members are getting routes   over half of the "heroines" are male  How are they going to do later releases of this VN?      This your first Key game? They have plenty of non-remantic routes. The Sunohara route in Clannad, for example.    I think he means keep it balanced between male/female for each release.    Oh, well fair enough. They're probably just gonna do a bit of both each time, but that's kind of obvious.   Best girl.   playing demo   Theme of SSS is the title music   Hearing Crow Song again after many years   MAEDA A E D A           FLY AWAY DOKO KARA     Hinata isn't a selectable MC   Game is already 5/10.      ED is still updated for the OVA   Hah.    I never noticed that the drummer girl was voiced by Asumi Kana.  They really did get an all-star voice cast for AB.      500MB  why.jpg     It's not the top selling PA Works and Key franchise for nothing. Despite being an experiment they got high quality ingredients for it.    I must have listened to those songs hundreds of times when they came out. It feels nostalgic now.    I liked Brave Song more.   Drama CDs 1-3, translated. Other 3 still untranslated 5 years later.  https://<span>youtu.be/IkEbIgq4C0I  [ ] https://<span>youtu.be/WUY8o-dgHJo  [ ] https://<span>youtu.be/kl9ggiaFYU8  [ ]  Track Zero LN translations although you could just read the manga which is the same thing and more added to it the the LN has its charm as well (the art is definitely worth it).

Im so glad AB is a thing again.        Yukari Tamura   Yui   Anon, that's KitaEri.         It's been 5 fucking years since Angel Beats ended  That hit me hard. I remember the threads when it ended so clearly.     Is this the one where a ninja says "Coooooooot-o!"    My memory has failed me, I could have sworn when I looked it up ages back it was Yukari Tamura that VA'd her, though I would have noticed it wasn't her if I'd heard her in the OVA for more than a split second.     To be fair, their voices could be confused.  Good taste by the way, she was my favorite AB girl too.      That was the previous OVA.    Bland.   So how lewd is the VN, are any of the lewd CG's available?   Fuck you.       le hipster opinion.jpg        opinion of 92% of /a/   hipster        So will there be visible tits?      I will commend you for protecting her till the very end.  Good, why be faceless and have no personality riding on the Tenshi bandwagon? There's so many better characters in the rest of the cast and let's throw in the Little Busters crew too.       My dick      Hinata doesn't go at the same time as Yui.  I'm still disappointed.      Otonashi: “Say, Tachibana. Can I call you by your name?” Tenshi: “Why?” Otonashi: “Because we became friends.” Tenshi” “Became?” Otonashi: “We became freinds. We fished together, even cooking now.” Otonashi: “Plus, when I first heard your name I was thinking, what a pretty name…”  Otonashi: I like you, your name. Kanade means, to play a sound right?” Tenshi: If you want too, do as you like.” Otonashi: My name, Yuzuru. It means to tie the string. You can call me that.”  Kanade nodded at me. I want Kanade to stay with me forever.  Otonashi: “Say, Kanade. I want you to answer something.” Kanade: “What?” Otonashi: Stay with me and Hinata.” Kanade: “…why?” Otonashi: I don’t want you to fight anyone anymore. I want you to live happy.” Kanade: “I understand with everyone, but just you and that person?” Otonashi: No, of course with everyone. But, Hinata will be there too.” Kanade: “It’s confusing…”  I like Hinata, but I also like Kanade. Huh? What is this love triangle?  Otonashi: (Do I have to choose one…?)                              thumbnail     Iwasawa: “Where are you going?”  I continue walking silently.  Iwasawa: “Is it a date? This is the first time we walked alone together since we starting dating.” Iwasawa: “This would be our first date.” Otonashi: “Its this classroom” Iwasawa: “huh? Do you have something to do here? It just looks like an empty classroom?” Otonashi: “Say, Iwasawa.”  I walk to the center and turn towards Iwasawa.  Iwasawa: “What?” Otonashi: “Do you like me?” Iwasawa: “Of course. That’s why I’m dating you.” Otonashi: “I really like you Iwasawa.” Iwasawa: “Then, I really like you too.” Iwasawa: “It’s embarrassing…”  I reach out my hand. I touch Iwasawa’s chin with my index finger. And lift it.  Iwasawa: “Wha…”  Then, our lips touched.  Iwasawa: “nn…”  I thought that time should stop. God, please. Let us be like this forever. I will do anything.                                    You play as Otonashi in the VN  way to ruin it    What is that face for? Is she expecting something?     But he's my self insert. Buy my game.      not wanting to play as Kamiyan     Why does everyone hate him?   Ooyama and Naoi routes when?   If they didn't make you play as him they would have created a faceless self insert instead.  Be grateful you fuck.     Shiina route fucking when?   Liar and selfish.     Liar  What?   selfish  What's wrong with wanting to stay together with your waifu?        I need some context for this.    5 years later and people are still mad he ruined their pointless war   How prevalent is the toilet scene? I must know for reason. Is it a running gag or a one off? Speak it to me.   He's literally Riki.   America! Fuck yeah! Freeing the shit out of you!   Then I'll recap 2010 threads on why Otonashi is a dick.   Arrives to the new world   Gets taken in with open arms and no prejudice   Otonashi enjoys himself, even if the SSS are silly yet endearing on what they want to do (they literally just want to enjoy the highschool years they didn't have)   Gives a mini speech on how the SSS are precious friends to him and want to stick by them   Fast forward   Otonashi starts investigating Tenshi   Develops interest in her and reveals who she truly is (a good thing)   Starts to get really invested into his lolicon nature and starts to question the SSS   Decides to make everyone move on by force (good intentions start to go downhill)   Yui ep a horrible example on how low Otonashi is   During and after Shadows attacking, Otonashi decides to make everyone move on so he and Kanade can be the last to go   When they're the last ones, he changes his mind and starts to persuade Kanade to stay so they can "help" future people move on   I LOVE YOU   THANK YOU   Otonashiplayingkinect.gif   Otonashi wanting to throw away everything he believed in follows the prior Dr. Love's footsteps and decides to stay in heaven for god knows how long, in which he becomes the new student council president that you see in the short bonus episode   Probably 12475436 years of waiting for Kanade to appear again and didn't, Otonashi decides to stop being a faggot and moves on in which you see in the final minute of ep 13 where he's reunited with Kanade                     That's because Riki is Ooyama's reincarnation.  Kinniku yay yay!   I wonder if he'll meet Saya some day then.    FANSUB STILL ALIVE     Starts to get really invested into his lolicon nature and starts to question the SSS  Because he started to realize that they and Tenshi were fighting a completely pointless war when there really isn't anything to fight over.   Decides to make everyone move on by force  It's for their own good. The afterlife was meant for that purpose. Even Hinata didn't hold a grudge against him for letting Yui go.   During and after Shadows attacking, Otonashi decides to make everyone move on so he and Kanade can be the last to go  Because that is the only option. Staying any longer meant risking being devoured by the Shadow and spending the rest of existence as an NPC.   Otonashi wanting to throw away everything he believed in follows the prior Dr. Love's footsteps  What exactly is wrong with this? Staying behind and helping others to come to terms with their own regrets? He wasn't even really supposed to be in the afterlife to begin with and its possible that he was sent there for that very purpose to help others.              They were having FUN, he is nofunallowed officer.    At least he wasn't doing it for free.    no one raped npc  I'm dissapointed.    It is because this OVA fits in to the main series, that is why it says to be continued. I really doubt they are making another, though I would be ok with it.    Maybe in Angel Beats EX     No one's raping anybody   The afterlife is boring      boring  Not with Hinata around. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VTq<wbr>7xdSG1_8</wbr>  [ ]     Yui's route would be unplayable for me, fuck that.  I really want them to stay fun like this, with gun and concert and stuff.   The thing is that everyone would move on by their own eventually. What you are suggesting is self righteous in general, where it's Otonashi forcing others to do what he wants. Most of these people who have become part of the SSS are probably truly having the best time ever with each other.   Otonashi was a selfish prick who forced his own values on others and doesn't even follow through with it in the end.      Didn't get to see any of the girls get killed like the guys   I'm glad we at least got to see OP girl having diarrhoea, that was surprisingly arousing I'm ashamed to say.    It's right that the end was rushed, that could be longer and better, OVA 5 years later and pointless is unnecessary...  But fuck that, I liked it, and I'm glad to see another episode of this.    We Eva now?    The thing is that everyone would move on by their own eventually.   No they wouldn't, that was the problem. Hinata and Yui were both able to come to grips with their past but were still around cause of Yuri. Yuri's war on god had consumed them, they were not going to leave at all. They all needed someone to tell them that it was all right, that their fight was over and they should be content with the fun that they got to experience.      You have an infinite amount of time. You seriously think they will stay around forever? Not only that, but you sound really self righteous.     You seriously think they will stay around forever?  And eat nothing but school food? No, of course they wouldn't stay forever.   It said "To My Valentine" on it, it's not a birthday cake you fucking moron of a CAPTCHA.        should have been 24 fucking episodes, then we wouldnt need a fucking ova    Is this what Angel is like after eating Mapo Tofu?   HAAAAAND SONIC  can anyone make webm for this scene    Even Natsuki was embarrassed at how shit Kumiko's playing was.  the fagotts are now extremely smug   left or right?     This is my rare Kumiko, there are many like her, but this one is mine.      Seo      rare   not well cooked      Why are the girls in this show so gay.   Like pottery   /tv/ pls    Why don't we have a webm of all the times Reina says "Kumiko"?  http://cdfile.cf/f/4a861218.webm     So Reina sure seems popular with some anons. Anyone else think she's kinda uncomfortable to watch?  Maybe it works for other people but the sudden mood swings aren't doing much for me. Guess bipolar moe isn't my thing.     left fagott best fagott    But that's all the times Kumiko says Reina, ya dope.   Any ufo players here? Was that part that hard?, i play the trombone myself so i can kinda relate, but it looks medium at best    is that a jap mortar team?     reading comprehention     The speed mostly. All you need is time to practice.  But then I haven't played since highschool so who knows.      I thought It looked like she just had to play the scale up and down. Maybe it has to do with the pace.   Why the hell is this show so poorly rated on MAL? They love Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso but not this masterpiece?   is the part shoe's been strugling with hard?   Will the yuribait in Episode 12 be less, the same, or even more gay than the facestroking from Episode 11. Is that even possible at this point?   Excuse me, Episode 13    No better way to die anon   Can we all have a moment to talk about the greatest Homunculus from the FMA series?    I see, guess she needs to step her game up then.  No, not really, but he's new to the trombone right?       Not enough forced drama.    I want to be special like you.   Then I'll be even more special.   And in that moment, Kumiko realised she would never get good.     I updated your Kumiko   Yeah fired from the knee just like Thompson from third company says.  Wanna try it out?     They finally did it. Too cute.   They're probably gonna go all out with the lesbianism. Keep people hanging on for their eventual season 2/movie. It's been their main draw.    Damn it!! I meant for this to be a post!!    Are we gonna yuribait on level with that Fate spinoff now?    Original greed was better    I can only imagine it will be a lot less, maybe just normal friendship. But I thought the same after episode 10, and then 11 happened.    I like that their friendship is getting repaired.     SMUG HIM      Season 2/movie   What makes you think it'll get any of those when it's selling like garbage?         It's over yurifags. Kyoani is just messing with you. Crawl back to your hole.       I thought it was over 10k, maybe I'm thinking of something else    Tamako sold worse, still got a movie.   That jealously. Yes, yes.    over 10k    Kumiko and Shuuichi is the official and canon, romantic couple of Hibike! Euphonium created by Ayano Takeda   But it will be a gold mine   pool episode   Mizore getting screen time, maybe a friend   Natsuki in a swimsuit   band camp and non-gay shenanigans it will entail   Asuka caring enough to voice her opinion   more Kumiko    Natsuki in a swimsuit             They're gonna make up next episode with the foot stomping. It's gonna be so damn cute.     listen bitch, I could not give fewer fucks about your stupid fucking gachapon shit.     What kind of swimsuit would Natsuki wear?    It's only around 6k. KnK and Tamako sold like garbage and still got movies, so we'll see. Then again though, both of those do belong to KyoAni.   Someone please trasnlate reina's confession i'll pay you money  they told me I could be anything, so I became  /a/'s waifu   If this show doesn't end with Reina and Kumiko licking each other's pussies I will go full allahu akbar at Kyoani's HQ   She'll show off that delicious midriff with a white bikini    え、あの、携帯をー  I wish I could make this my ringtone.      Which one shows up in sukumizu?     It ain't selling because there's no bloody music 12 eps and 2 (T W O) pieces? Now i know piano boy had talking over music, but still, we got music.     Is there any official merchandise of the gachapon shit?    KyoAni show   no beach/pool/onsen episode   What happened?      I'm sure there will be.    Asuka since she's dirt poor     It ain't selling because there's no bloody music  The show is more of learning about music and how much it sucks to git gut than musical moments      implying she's not wearing it ironically.      Natsuki in a swimsuit   Natsuki in a swimsuit   dick is now diamonds   Mizore         That Shuichi face when Kumiko got cut.   Also, what was with the second chance. Did Taki forget to notify Kumiko afterwards or did he decide to give her another go when she came back for her phone?     she didn't get cut what are you talking about    Platonic friendship between boys and girls is the best.    I think he mostly just wanted to scare Kumiko. He would have told her she could get the part back sooner rather than later.   He didn't want her thinking she could away with, "yeah sensei, I'll get better" is all.      But I ship that chinese lesbian with mophead     I like how not only did she felt Reina she also felt Shuichi. This shit is actually pretty good.     Then you're not living your life correctly. One of the highlights is that they're bros.    What if he is one of us?    When will they fuck?     shipping his students  You're alright Taki sensei.      Are these some chinese comics?     I know. I've read dat shit because the art is amazing. Fucking chinese man.  I still ship them.       implying they haven't     How do you play that?     sensei, I love you!   But don't you think that Kumiko girl you hang out with is nice? You get along really well.      http://louvestudio.tumblr.com/post/<wbr>103338184126/what-is-how-do-you-pla<wbr>y-seaweed-oh-seaweed</wbr></wbr>    He ships Kumiko and Reina so he can  have Shuichi all to himself     Doujins when?     sensei is secretly a yurifag   he rejected Reina the way he did to maximize the chances of her getting with Kumiko   Fund it KyoAni.        what's this folder titled "yuri" for?   nothing        wrong image       It's okay /u/ keep trying, it might become canon.    Fucking love this guy    its the famous URSS space man you silly girl      f-flowers, I'm studying flowers!      "Here, Kousaka-san. I want you to take this flower pin that belonged to my cherished wife and give it to Oumae-san."   It's a lily      yurifag Taki  This is almost as good as abusive Kumiko.    tumblr   yuritalk  Has /u/ taken over?    Oh we're posting fan fics now? You yurifags are hilarious and desperate.  its true his wife went to the deep end?    abusive Kumiko  Taki taught her well.  tfw we will never find the rest of this       hai   Will he actually accomplish anything in the finale or will he remain an underachiever wiener?   he fucks kumiko while reina offs herself     underachiever wiener   He got gud. He's the wiener king now.       he fucks kumiko while reina gets off herself  FTFY     as long as Shuuichi is in a Taki costume   Teacher x student offers better forbidden love than female x female.    he fucks off with Kumiko gets Reina off herself  FTFY     So there's two Takis in the room? That's weird.    What is Asuka's goal in life?   For the finale I want everyone to get weiners together after school. Everyone would be there. Hazuki would finish hers in four bites, Midori would eat several since she always has room for more, Natsuki and Yuuko would have an eating contest, Asuka would be making inappropriate jokes and Mizore would be wondering why she isn't at home making reeds.   I'm going to marry Kumiko!   Be a massive bitch   Incoming smug.   Exterminate slackers.    Does giving no shits about life ring a bell?    being a hardcore psycho yandere just under the surface  mfw whens she is     He trully is the wiener of the kumiko bowl.   Reina doesn't stand a chance against Abe Froman.      Going back to nam        What about female teacher x female student?          Is she smugger than Smugdoka? This is so much smug.     does anyone know the songs that are played by the orchestra?   Is there a yuri scene in the novels during/shortly before the competition?    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rBM<wbr>E62reb5Y</wbr>  [ ]  The other one is original so there won't be any actual recordings of it until episode 13 / the OST.  And they aren't an orchestra.        I'm afraid this much smug in a few seconds of anime may create a smug black hole.            smug/10            If there's one kyoto animation has it's great screenplay and directing , they don't usually do interesting things but they make it interesting in it's own way     Kiniro Mosaic  I liked that show but it wasn't the best of that season.          True 1080p.   That sounds straight outta a monhun game gotta be honest    OK, that's all. So much smug.    I'm uncertain, although there is propbably another 'hagu' scene in the novels somewhere. Reina dedicating her solo to Kumiko comes later though. Even if there isn't one, I don't doubt that KyoAni will at least put a light one in the episode before the performance. It won't mean much though.    sliding down the posts makes it a gif   Essential.   It will mean I'm right. And you wonder if they can make it gayer than Kumiko's confession.    That's exactly why I made     meepmeep    Reminder that Reina can't help but play romantic music when she thinks of Taki   https://twitter.com/TomoyoKurosawa/<wbr>status/613874093016748032 Kurosawa plz </wbr>     Looks very interesting. Going to pick this back up now that the threads are getting less retarded.   S-someone post screencaps from the special, You know which   I'm surprised we haven't had some sort of "abandon thread" edit yet.    That's not how legs works, Natsuki.    Are you telling me that red hoops don't appear under you as you run?        UMAKU NARITAI     choosing what you watch based on the threads      GET GUD SCRUB    Why is mai waifu so adorable?   She looks funny and cute in a way.    2 minute special   30 second credits   for what purpose      That shirt is 3deep5me.    I don't know  Reina/Shuichi/Natsuki/Taki/Euphoniu<wbr>m san/Mamiko/loli Kumiko/</wbr>     Literally every single special and every single short has been like that since literally forever.    She's a washed up child actress who's turned to the dark depths of anime to pursue what little is left of her dying dream. Acting cute is all she can do at this point.    Cause otherwise it'd be a minute and a half special.    I'd say this is the best smug frame. Her mouth isn't that open as the other ones as if to show how her laugh is mocking Ribbons.    I'm partial to the subtle parting of the lips in  myself, as you can almost imagine a condescending "tsssch" sound going with it.    That's grimm as fuck man.    reminds me of Super Mario Galaxy for some reason    That running reminds me of Adachi Mitsuru for some reason.    Saved.   Can't wait to collect all the rare kumikos from the specials   Because she comes back    why the fuck do sabagebu! specials get 11 minutes then? aren't seitokai yakuindomo specials pretty lengthy too?    Well the eyebrows are superior in that one, I can tell that.    What an awful webcomic. You don't need to be a "connoisseur" to tell a difference between a bad and a good wine. Literally go to a store, buy a one dollar wine and a fifty dollar wine and try them both out. Don't justify your shit taste by pretending everyone with a working tongue is a snob.        aren't seitokai yakuindomo specials pretty lengthy too?  Those are full ovas.       I'm guessing "specials" is a catch-all terms for everything under a full episode length.    Ponytail!  in 1080p!         Hazuki has more screentime in a 2 minute special than she has in the last 4 episodes       Scat objectophilia?    it's soy sauce I swear    Don't drink so much soy sauce so you won't shit yourself then.    what a slut   Special where? Is it subbed?  Reina help, /a/ is bullying me!    Special where?  Filenames literally everywhere.   Is it subbed?  No, scrub.        Well, she needed to git gud    First time I've seen these two in the same shot    Dat armpit.   These specials are definitely things worth looking forward to.  Fuck, I'm getting tempted to buy the BDs myself.     hey jebus     salt tooth.      not only did she felt Reina she also felt Shuichi  What does this statement mean?     what's the meaning of this     not putting salt in your trumpetah     She is salty while reading /a/     asking someone to explain a joke    Why are there two bassoons but one oboe? That's like having one alto and two baritone saxes, just plain crazy.   She should just get over it, and start dating Kumiko.      i'm not the sharpest tool in the shed anon i'm sorry     they couldn't find anybody else who was crazy enough to want to play an oboe     2 oboes     Kumiko is the egg with the sunny side up symbolizing her new optimism and Reina is the salt shaker gravitating over Kumiko making her more tasty (special).  She wants to sprinkle herself all over Kumiko.      I just can't take her dumb chuuni face seriously. After episode 12, I just laugh whenever I see an image of her. She's so adorable.      Oboe is a soloist instrument.    MADMAN BAND FOR MAD PEOPLE        Who in the world would wash their euphonium with the valves still in??      show is almost over and they're not all friends yet     Asuka ain't good in the head anon    Hazuki a noob. Can't be helped    a piece of shit     yamada couldn't get over her mandatory 4-5 group of close friends and just made shit up for the ED     Will they ever? Hazuki and Opal seem to prefer to leave Kumiko and Reina alone.  Maybe they are the yurifags.      There is no problem here.     Will they ever? Hazuki and Opal seem to prefer to leave Kumiko and Reina alone.  If a friend of mine started hanging out with a weirdo that gives school stabber vibes, I too would just encourage that friend to spend more time with them instead of inviting the weirdo to our social circle.     anon, how do you get two oboes to play in tune?  shoot one      I just watched the special.  My moon isn't too great, but was it a ramen joke?        No.     Must've been, because I learned years ago you actually can't wash your instrument in a bathtub due to rust.  Hey.       Are you going to apologize for this smugness?     It was a soy and ketchup joke.    underrated    to be fair, It's Hazuki imagining Asuka naked with a euphonium. Hazuki doesn't know how to clean an instrument.   <br/>  Will the OTP appear in the last episode?    ketchup  No one mentioned ketchup.    At least Kumiko passed the audition eh eh eh.  That look on Hazuki's face when Kumiko starts playing is hilarious.   Seven years!      brass   rust.      I think it was just the lighting that made her look smug/menacing. Take that away and it was just a nice smile.    Where is that last pic from? I don't remember ever seeing it.    is Riko into age gap too? Cause Goto is definitely not 16 years old     he is dreamy AF  real life version not to bad either. allHOMO       Although I hear her say sauce but maybe that's what they call ketchup over there? who knows.     ソース     Was there any competition?    I thought sauce referred to worcester sauce    Them looking uncomfortable made me uncomfortable. It was her first time playing that part, of course it wouldn't be polished.     I want Kumiko to sit on my face.    This.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=feJ<wbr>yw6W5tP4</wbr>  [ ]   When I was little I really liked the movie perfume and I had the biggest crush on Jean Baptiste. Now I find out this is the same actor. Reina's got godtier taste.     yo fuck all the other pairings sapphire + tuba-kun is the shit     It does but not exclusively.     Not having a Reina playing the trumpet solos   The flute is too low for it      Why is she so underappreciated?    Aside from being cute, she's practically useless.   All these phone calls from Reina.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=c4m<wbr>aNMIgRH8</wbr>  [ ]   3 trombones   only 1 eupho   and that sad guy with the tambourine         Fuck you, Kazuki. You can't even sight read.     Is it strange to be turned on by this?     The flute is too low  You don't hear that one too often.    Shuichi buggering Kumiko.    making a gif     No.    I wish it had more specific time signatures than just "today"     yfw it goes in the wrong hole       <br/>         wrong hole      why did you buy the biggest one they had?       The ribbon moves.    ain't that M from skyfall?    8/10 I laughed   that cutie with the piccolo at 0:28   What's the second guy from the left supposed to be playing in pic related? he's just moving his fist.          The sound is too quiet. I don't know the actual terms   no such thing as a wrong hole       probably a shaker    As in ?   Maybe this will get a 2nd season because the staff liked the novels that's they aquired the rights to begin with     It will get something, don't worry.   That smile. Truly a miracle of the prefecture.  Is it weird to fantasize about having one of the Hibike's fall in love with you, but having to tell them that now's not the right time?  <br/>    prefecture  Nigga, that smile is going to nationals.     Call after call after call, what do you think was going through her head that whole time?    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yiL<wbr>hix_0LQ0</wbr>  [ ]    She didn't know Kumiko was with Taki at the time. She probably just called every 20 minutes or so thinking thats the socially acceptable thing to do.    She probably sat there and timed the intervals perfectly. Too bad she didn't know  she was getting cucked     Well let's see, she didn't look at it after she left practice. What time did they get out? If she left her phone unattended for three hours then Reina must have called once every thirty minutes. Imagine Reina checking the clock, checking her phone again and thinking, "okay, let's try again. She must not have heard it ringing."    I just realised if someone called me that often with no reason behind it (judging by the scene where they meet up she didn't have anything important to say) I would be terrified.   but Reina a qt so it's ok      She was probably running all over the place searching for her.    Brilliant    I wish they showed them exchanging numbers. Reina probably has no one else in her contacts list. She has a phone specifically to call Kumiko.      ok maybe she's still on the way home. I'll try again in 30 minutes   maybe she's having dinner, 30 more minutes   bath?   kumiko   she could be practicing   really?           But what did she want to talk about so badly? When Kumiko called her she didn't say anything.    literally forced drama they didn't force it too hard at least     She gets lonely sometimes.    She probably didn't have much to say, she just wanted Kumiko to talk to her.    What would be even better is if she left several voice messages where you can hear her get more anxious and agitated as time goes on.     But what did she want to talk about so badly?  She wanted to make sure her friend was okay. How is this difficult to understand.     She was probably planning to hear Kumiko's voice, breathe heavily, and make up some flimsy excuse for calling.    She was probably readying her knives right before Kumiko finally called her back. Then she got all dressed up and rode her bike down to the station in heels.    Q    Not with how she's currently playing.    And then acted like everything was no big deal. But then Kumiko told her that she was alone with Taki and she snapped.   I think we're getting S2 or a movie because I doubt that they would perform live in the season finale.    implying  Kumiko's smile game is on fire.      implying /a/ knows how friends work     yeah there's no way there could be any kind of satisfactory ending unless they did a double feature ending or went with a shitty "prease buy bru ray for ending"    She just wanted to see if she was hurt by being snubbed by sensei.    Why wouldn't they perform live? That seems like a perfect climax for the season. Neverrtheless, this is just begging for a season 2 and feels woefully incomplete without one.    But Kumiko is more pretty when she's crying.    You have a terrible personality.    I think she's very  relatable     how would a cartoon perform live?    MIku?    What mood swings? Her mood changes with the situation just like everyone else.    He was the real sensei all along.    Is that cum on her face   it's a shame that since the show is ending, we'll never know what the hell is up with Asuka   Because the show will end with "The next piece begins!" line, dimwit. In seriousness, there's no way they would participate in the contest because Kumiko has to learn to git gud first and bait us with yuri undertone moments with Reika.    yeah, but whose?    Man, /a/ will flip its shit if they don't play the last piece.     Imho KyoAni made the teardrops too big. Sure, with eyes of her Size (size half the skull, leaving little space for brain), they would be that big - but they could have sacraficed biological realism to aesthetic.  A few tears running down the cheeks is beutiful. A water pump in the eyes pumping litres of salty water - not.       Also for Shuuichi to get good as well.   Nothing. She's just in for the music and can't give a shit about drama/ not the type to handle conflict and she knows it, that's why she refused to be the president.        Imho KyoAni made the teardrops too big.   not knowing the standard KyoAni cry  Damn it, Anon. How many times do I have to tell you to stop being so new.      My guess is that the structure of the last episode will go something like:  Kumiko gits gud   Taki lets Kumiko play that part   contest begins   play Wind of Provence  -Commercial Break-  play Crescent Moon Dance   award ceremony   Kitauji gets the gold and moves on to regionals   ending scene (I don't know, more yuribait or something)             A sad Kumiko is fine too.    ending scene (I don't know, more yuribait or something)  They'll set the stage for Hibike Love Story.      &gt;Kumiko gits gud   &gt;Taki lets Kumiko play that part    create the buildup and emotional impact of last episode   start next episode with "lol okay n/m"  Why are you so bad at telling a story, Anonymous?        yfw when final episode begins with "the next piece begins" and a focus shot Oboe-chan as she faces the camera when Kumiko calls her name.   It's normal for some people     Correct me if I'm wrong, but it goes prefectural &gt; Kansai &gt; national, right? Taki said Kumiko could play that part in the Kansai competition if she got good, so she wouldn't play that part in the next episode.     Actually he is Taki's father who's watching over his son. Riko is also in on it.   Kumiko shed blood, sweat, and tears in this episode   Is that even real?     shed blood, sweat, and tears   episode ends with Kumiko still not playing the part   meanwhile Shuuichi got his trombone part down and made it in time for the two for one wiener special  git gud Kumiko      Pucker up your anus yurifags and hope there won't be any Kumiko-Shuichi hints in the final episode.   doesn't shoe get stepped on?    Is Hibike the deepest anime of the season?    I found it cute.     Yes, but because he ignored her which isn't the case anymore for the anime. I don't know they'll probably change things.     I'm a musician, not a writer. Sue me.   Yeah, I guess you're right. So I guess they're just gonna get to the competition, have some scenes there, play some musics and BOOM! Season 2 never.      I can't help it.   she felt the same things that Reina and Shuichi did, i.e. great disappointment when their middle school band didn't get the grade she wanted at the competition (Reina) and failing to be able to play a certain part (Shuichi).   That whole scene was bizarre. I like it.  all the Shuichi and Kumiko scenes were so wonderfully subtle   Crying isn't beautiful.     being this much of a faggot     I keep my loyalty to you.    More likely:   Asuka can't participate for some reason   Taki needs Kumiko play that part   Kumiko panics   Reina/Shoe to the rescue!   contest begins   etc.            That part doesn't depend on the euphoniums. If something like that were to happen, Taki would more likely have no euphs at all than have it played by someone he can't trust will play it well.    There's no time for these shenanigans in one episode. It'll open with the band setting up for the competition and she'll narrate a quick explanation. The bulk of the competition will be in the first half of the episode so the end can have room for hugging, crying, and being gay.     It's that time again. Time for another bait scene.  At least the uploader knows what's up.    Do people really think twelve whole minutes of the episode will be devoted to the music just because the band plays the music for twelve minutes at the competition?   Her tits look huge.    I think "ketchup" was the wrong translation.  They probably meant something like pic related.      I personally don't think they'll play all of Wind of Provence, but I'm expecting (read: hoping) they'll play most if not all of Crescent Moon Dance. Seems like a waste to compose a whole piece for this show only to have them not play the thing continuously.    Has KyoAni done blood in their anime before?    Does that answer your question?    KnK kind of revolved around it.  Also, Disappearance.         tumblr      subbers translating shit poorly  I'll alert the media.       I have the middle bottle one. Shit's delicious.

Cant wait for next vollume`s    How is 7k a garbage sales, you fucking /v/tard?     10% UP  They have weird sales in Japan     Try to resist the urge to respond to a 6 hour old shitpost.    They made a show about a girl with a blood sword.  The climax of one of their most acclaimed works has a girl stabbing the main character's back and retrieving the knife, spinning around with it and splattering blood around.  In Chuu2, Rikka bit on her finger to summon her weapon with her blood.  FMP.  Heck, even Tamako Market had a nosebleed. (Dera's when he sees Tamako over the onsen wall).  Nichijou showed a drop of blood when Yuuko stabbed her thumb with a mechanical pencil.  This is anime we're talking about, not Disney. They've shown a fucking horse give birth.                I forgot, the principal in Nichijou spits blood in his fight with the deer. It probably had many other instances of blood I can't remember.  Fucking Lucky Star talked about periods.

What's this?   SOMETHING definitely happen after stair scene   Calm down, Reina.   You will never break Reina's heart.   She even dropped her bottle. Was this overall just the bottle episode?    is kumiko now into taki-sensei too?    It's a shame ribbons doesn't exit left so you could get a perfect loop. You could maybe edit in the extra frames with what's there, though.    Calm down, Reina.     That's a nice butt.   Probably the standard "contains 10% more" in engrish.    Even Midori wants a piece.    She'll be replaced with another seasonal waifu by most of the faggots in this thread next month.   I've been avoiding Eupho threads but they're alright.   nope, she is memorable as character unlike  sento     Hey man, I still jack off to Sento. Weekly.    They're fine now, but for the last several weeks they were being ruined on a regular basis by excessive shippingfaggotry.  Depending on how it goes, I fear that might happen again after the final episode.     works better like that    A handful of incredibly obsessive and angry hetfags seem to be the main source of shitposting in these threads. After ep 11, the thread quality went up quite noticably because pretty much everyone of them gave up on Shuichi being relevant in this anime.  Friendship end, purely focusing on music end, status quo end or yuri-undertone end = somewhat civilized threads like they have been in the past few weeks Forced het end = endless "/u/ BTFO" shitposting       its fucking trolls dude. you are so late on this.    Yeah, no. Both sides were terrible. Most were shitposters, I'd wager. And I'm willing to bet that they'll return in full force if there is anything even vaguely romantic in the final episode. Pray for music end.     megane   why?       anything yuribait   civilized threads  You fucking wish.       angry hetfags  Both sides are equally retarded.    Is this the only time we'll get to hear Sapphire's bass? We heard plenty of trumpet, tuba, euphonium, and even trombone but we only get a single note from her.    After ep 11, the thread quality went up quite noticably  Bullshit.  And no, the yurifags were just as bad. Both sides were shit. I'd rather take the band fags blogging.        Nice try /u/ but you obnoxious faggots ruined these threads since ep 8. Off to your containment board      At this point they should just drop the bass     Forced het end  Fuck off, /u/, You're just as bad as those angry hetfags.      ;_;  I was surprised to see a bass in concert band and got excited since I used to play it. But given that it's the last episode I guess there won't be any bass service.       to be honest it felt like they just slapped the bass in    Twinkle twinkle little star.     I'd slap Sapphire's bass if you know what I mean     There was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in episode 6, and when they did solfege in episode 4.    drop the bass  kek       See this, what do?   Try to get better.    Call the Governor of California because I've got the solution to their drought.     rare   not extracted      Bully.     &gt;KyoAni show   &gt;no beach/pool/onsen episode   What happened?   OVA       Where is people downloading the subbed special?   At this point, any romance ending with Shoe would be forced as fuck. I don't see how you have to be from /u/ to think that. Just for the record, I'm not even a yurifag.   I loved Tamako Market love story for example despite the yuri ship losing, because the male lead in that show was actually interesting and they developed his relationship towards Tamako over the main course of the anime leading up to the movie. This show had nothing of that sort. Shoe was barely even a side character, he became almost a background character for the last couple of episodes.      Mophead has a girlfriend, anon.     Just want you to know I appreciate you.     Hey now, he's more than just a background character. He's a foil, an exposition dump and a connoisseur of corndogs.    Think to myself  damn they spent a lot of budget on her running animation   and I like it       Yell at her to     What's Mamiko studying/working as?   Professional skank.    So the plot twist is that fluffy gets hospitalized before the nationals and dies from some illness, right?    UHH PHOTO CREDITS  I took this pishure of you biiiitch     that pic is sad as fuck, imagine that K-ON happened on Angels Beats afterlife world, that finale would cause a massive suicide   bestsuki is the miracle of the universe   I desire to sexually molest here.      forced   Keep telling yourself that yurifag.        I want to make her happy, Bill.   Haggu    Pilot a giant robot.        You're both terrible. Kumiko x Jack for life.    OTP    Well it was all just hypothetical anyway, no reason to get your panties in a bunch. We all know there won't be any het ending. They cut Shuichi's screentime each episode for a reason. They decided early on that they won't focus on Shuichi's and Kumiko's relationship in this anime.   That dorky smile. Boy going to get stomped for yelling at Kumiko.   Kumiko's first choice: Ufo-san Second choice: Reina Third choice: Taki-sensei Fourth choice: "Geh... I guess Shoe will do."  Being Shoe is suffering.          Third choice: Taki-sensei     No matter how many times you repeat "we won because we got bait and you got tears" it will not erase an entire month you people kept spamming about anime original yuri end and everyone else telling you not to take bait seriously.  No one expected a Shuichi end since these "hetfags" you talk about are people who just don't want to listen to obnoxious shipperfags and know that anime will not drastically deviate from the novels.       No one expected a Shuichi end  You do realize you're being the pot to his kettle, right?      it will not erase an entire month you people kept spamming about anime original yuri end and everyone else telling you not to take bait seriously.   Uh, I never expected an anime orginal yuri end. Neither did the vast majority of yurifriends. But it's nice to know that this is gonna be the narrative you salty faggots are going to push after the finale.   "we won because we got bait and you got tears"   That is exactly what happened throughout this show though. We enjoyed this anime for what it was, possibly even get yet another nice "yuribait" scene at the finale and that's it. No one was expecting a yuri end because this was not a romance show. It was a show about a music club, focusing on the friendship of 2 girls with lots of yuri fanservice. It's only you hetfags who didn't understand this and were expecting something completely different from this show.          Oh, for fuck's sake, we were flooded by shitposters on both sides of the "conflict": Don't try to whitewash this nonsense, you were all terrible.   Reminder than /u/fags were BTFO yet again. How are they still holding up this far in denial?   Is oboe the hardest equipment to play? Why are they only a single oboe player?    These wars are ridiculous, both sides are terrible.   YOU MOVE LIKE OLD PEOPLE FUCK, YOU KNOW THAT PRIVATE OUMAE?     Sure, let's pretend Kumiko never felt bad when Hazuki asked Shuichi out or the fact that she kept eyeing on him or the time she snaps back to reality just by hearing his name. Kumiko is dense all she needs is to realize that she likes Shuichi. Actually the fact that she felt so butthurt by his comment before is already a huge hint. Kyoani is making up for downplaying the ship by having them run parallels to each other.      Thing is, there will be a Shuichi end if the show ever gets continued. But at the end of this season? Hell no, and really there's no point in arguing about it at this point anymore. Wait until S2/Movie confirmation and then you guys can shitpost all you want.     Yeah, this has been established repeatedly. It's good practice for learning how to mentally filter out bullshit though, so take it as a learning experience.     hardest equipment to play  Could some /mu/ fag shed some light on this in general? Are all of the occuring instruments roughly equally difficult to play or is there some gradation?       Thing is, there will be a Shuichi end if the show ever gets continued.  What makes you say that, Anon? Because it happened in the novels?  A lot of things happened in the novels. Things that never happened in the anime. And of course, vice versa.         snaps back to reality  moms spaghetti     But mostly this side:<br/>       Oboe is actually easier to play than brass, due to a completely different blowing technique. But otherwise most wind instruments are more or less the same in the difficulty department - except for the bigger deeper instruments requiring more lung capacity and therefore being inherently more difficult than the smaller.      UMAKU NARITAI     place looks a lot more depressing in real life    Can you find the bench where all the river scenes and the practicing take place? Also, the mountain viewpoint from ep 8.    /r/ing this sort of picture but with Taki or Reina (doesn't matter) fucking Kumiko as Shoeitchy can only watch them impotently. Last episode really cemented him as a failure who won't even come support his supposed love interest when she's down. Therefore, Shoeitchy is a beta cuck who doesn't deserve Kumiko and should be branded as such for all the world to know.   I agree honestly, but /u/ is still annoying.      Last episode really cemented him as a failure who won't even come support his supposed love interest when she's down   It's her fault for not gitting gud            Gotta admit it was a strange way for him to handle it. Do you think their scenes this week counts as them reconciling or will we still get the foot-stomp next week?    Buyfag thread, read this before asking questions http://buyfag.moe   Mandarake always lies about their box condition.  They say that it's damaged when it's not.     Can anyone give me a picture of what the box looks like from the back please? May have to deal with customs in the future.  Btw Noodles, do you by any chance know what's the max amount an item can cost before it is taxed in Malaysia? Also how do you avoid customs, I noticed you now own bath loli?     Shit, that's cute. Not something I would've expected to get a Nendo though, is it more popular than I think it is?      Isn't noodles in Singaporn?   Next chapter will be the ultimate ending, are you ready to be butthurt?  Also did you enjoy the gaiden?     I'm going with option 3. It's the best we can hope for really.   MODS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!   It'll be FRIENDSHIP and UNDERSTANDING and LOVE. It was fun though    Is it confirmed the next chapter is the final or you're pulling stuff out of your ass?    I'm glad Sarada is being sidelined for the movie now.  She's worthless to me now. I seriously haven't been this mad over anything 2 dimensional in a while.       It's a shame. She is adorable and had a nice entry, then she gets reduced into the depths of being a mini-Sakura.    Ahaha, and yet you were laughing at Sakurafags. This fucking irony.     Why are you guys upset at her super strength?     goddamn sakura looks so disgusting in that picture    Does it mean Hinata is back to being best girl?     goddamn sakura looks so disgusting  Fixed.     1010 has that spot. hinata can be 2nd best girl though.    They are Sakurafags.  Most people don't give a shit about Sakura. Lovers or haters, both are fans.       back to   implying it changed       western_lesbians_adopt_eleven.jpg    so what happened with salad in the last page?    i'm just glad narusara ntr wankfest is over.     wait next chapter is last chapter of gaiden?  wat      Because it might mean she will have a fighting style like that of Sakura, which has a long, long history if being ridiculously useless. Sarada deserves better than being like her stepmother. It also throws the fuck out the supposed rivalry she was to have with Bolt. I mean, come on, a prodigy mini-Naruto trained by Sasuke and Naruto v. a mini Karin with the lowest tier of Sharingans trained by Sakura. That is just sad an upsetting.       implying she ever was       her stepmother   Anon, please, the icing on this garbage cake will be that it was all a MISUNDERSTANDING. Not only will Sarada be mini-Sakura in spirit, but in blood too. Compelling character arc? OP Uzumaki genes? Who cares about that? As long as SS fangirls get what they want.       No, Hinata is Best Mum. She ceased to be best girl when she became a woman. Best girl now is Himawari.      Because it might mean she will have a fighting style like that of Sakura, which has a long, long history if being ridiculously useless.  When used by Sakura, who has no talent other than Chakra control. Sarada, as an Uchiha, has picked it up without all the years of training the Sakura required. And being an Uchiha, she will be able to mix it other techniques she picks up along the way. All it means is that enemies can't melee with her now with nothing short of a Chidori tier technique.  If anything, she's on her way to be Kakashi tier.       Nope, i think it's the last chapter of Sarada's story arc. i doubt kishi want to stop making naruto manga.     this makes more sense but Kishymoto just wants to please fans  I believe I saw identical line in NS posts after 700. Now what does that say about you?     kek'd   Karin has sakura real daughter, sasuke fucked both girls.    Kakashi tier  So a jobber, then. Good to know.     Don't fool yourself, this is Kishi we are talking about here, not someone competent. Tsunade's super punch is far too useful to be ever given proper consideration in fight scenes.      I believe I saw identical line in NS posts after 700.   Why should I care?   Now what does that say about you?   That I'm right and they were retarded.           Nobody ever faulted Sakurafags for being devoted to their waifu. They faulted Sakurafags because there waifu was shit.  Sarada was a good waifu ruined by bad writing.      I knew our time was limited but it was fun to laugh at.  Kishi still fucked up SS more though, all those fanarts and headcanons are still in garbage.     No, I'm pretty sure you're just denying any contradictory fact because of your own feelings toward characters.    Sarada focusing on super strength isn't just out of nowhere, it's the worst that could've happened if that's her focus and not the sharingan.  Kishi has the bad habit of giving his characters more powers than he can remember. They have tons of abilities but stick to their fighting style.  Naruto had the six paths and the tailed beasts? Still fights like the same Naruto from always.  Sasuke, Tobi etc get the rinnengan? Never use its powers.  Since it was unlikely she'd get the everything-proof skeleton shield at twelve, I was hoping she'd fight with the classic sharingan and fight like part I sauce.  Instead, she'll get Sakura's fighting style that in part II focused on clearing mooks nobody cared about, and spending her chakra healing mooks nobody cares about.              At this point I'm just mourning a legit interesting character who might have had neat fights in a possible future full series. But yeah, we had some fun and that's all that matters.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155408   You don't have t  Did Obito come by and warped you with his ka      Obito couldn't use the Rinnegan's powers because he didn't have both. Same with Sasuke. Just sayin'.     They're not upset over super strength. They're upset because this indicates that she probably is Sakura's (biological) daughter.  It's funny because a few days ago they were bitching about ssfags who turned on Salad as soon as it looked like she wasn't proof that their ship had boned at least once. But now that the opportunity to make jokes about Sakura being cucked is slipping away, they're doing the same thing.       So a jobber, then.  Except she has the Uchiha body like Itachi said. So she will be able to do more with less than Kakashi. The only thing really holding her back is that she will likely never have the sorrow or whatever for the Mangekyo.    Tsunade's super punch is far too useful to be ever given proper consideration in fight scenes.   You don't have to have her one shot everyone. Just keep the enemy in range, like most Ninjas do anyways until the far draws to a close.          But Obito's long de   Sarada has traits from both Sasuke and Sakura and has no traits from Karin.   KARINFAGS ON SUICIDEWATCH      And I'm pretty sure you're just making strawman arguments to sound more intelligent.      &gt;Kishi still fucked up SS more though, all those fanarts and headcanons are still in garbage.  That was true long before Sarada showed up. SS is a truly disgusting pairing.      I know you're joking, but there are actual Karin shippers on /a/? I thought most people simply despised Sakura, Sasquay, or both. And the SS shippers' tears were hilarious.     So why counter it with the same move?    You can have cool weapons, techniques like the lighning rasengan or stretchy arms McOrochimarusspawn OR a big, boring punch. It would get old fast. Kishi may like to stick to the same two attacks per character, but for relevant characters those are kept flashy and kind of interesting. The Tsunade Punch takes up a valuable slot in Sarada's repertoire.       Himawari is going to cry in the movie.      Sarada focusing on super strength isn't just out of nowhere, it's the worst that could've happened if that's her focus and not the sharingan.  She didn't focus on it though. She picked it BECAUSE of the Sharingan. She doesn't even have to train for it anymore. Not to mention if she really does have Karin genetics, she will have the Uzumaki chakra pool to spam it.   Kishi has the bad habit of giving his characters more powers than he can remember. They have tons of abilities but stick to their fighting style.  All that really means though is that this will like be Sarada's finisher. Her fighting style is still relatively unknown but she seems to be pretty mobile with the Uchiha affinity for reading attacks.        Yeah. Except the planet power and the absorption power. The robot power would be too interesting.     I'm not. You're making a false comparison because it suits the purposes of your argument.      that delicious cake made with love  Boruto is the worst villain in the franchise.     Is the next chapter the last one?    I bet she'll just look puzzled at it as Bolt rushes out, she loves her onii-chan.    Implying Sarada isn't a experiment made from Sasuke or   Madara /Karin cooked inside Sakura    What if it was all a ruse by sauce and cuck to trigger her sharingen    And being an Uchiha, she will be able to mix it other techniques she picks up along the way  Hopefully. But I wouldn't hold my breath, I suspect she'll be healing fish pretty soon too.     I thought the super focused punch and shit Sakura learned from Tsunade was taught, not genetic; Sarada could have learned the trick through passively watching because she's seen the punch several times in her life and she's an Uchiha. You know, Kishimoto's attempt at showing its nurture, not nature.   Just here for the drama; I am enjoying the banter between the Karinfags and Sakurafags.       And if Pierrot takes over series once Kishi is done with, they will definitely turn her into a Sakura 2.0, ship tease the hell out of BoruSara and take away what good of her left.    I can't believe that people think sakura can be the real mother just because sarada used her technique, r u guys serious?    She's an Uchiha, she can easily modify it with whatever elemental affinity she has.      cooked  cucked*      her sad backstory is feeling bad for Bolt whose being a shithead distances him from the people closest to him   she is determined to be a good daughter, but more than that help everyone get along   her techniques revolve around cooperation, namely summoning, in the endgame with the Tailed Beasts   her life goal is to gather all the summoning contracts in the world        But I don't the conflict and moral of the story is there and entire situation is perfectly understandable, there's no backpedalling there to please the fans, no retconing, all the evidences of Karin are easily explainable, it's a story Kishimoto decided on, yet you deny any possibility of it because you dislike the character of Sakura.     dips her fist in water   sets fire to her hand       But I wouldn't hold my breath  She's a surviving Uchiha, that's what the remaining elite + Kakashi have all done.    So is Sakura the mother?  I don't want to drag storm 4 talk on /a/ but kaguya, bolt, and sarada were confirmed for the game today <br/>     They're not upset over super strength.   Yes we fucking are. That's what so many of us were on in the last thread. Her having Sakura's super strength means she'll probably just be a Sakura clone.  Whether she's Sakura's bio-kid or not doesn't matter, she's all but stated at this point to be the most useless member of her team because Kishi, instead of giving her anything original is just going to give her Sakura's useless skills.     I am enjoying the banter between the Karinfags and Sakurafags.   Nobody on /a/ cares about Karin except for her genes and the fact that she's a tool to make Sakurafags mad. Stop trying to project shit.               all the evidences of Karin are easily explainable   explain, including the photoshopped family picture.     Think about this:  Sarada can easily heal your bruised dick after you gave it to hear the whole day so that you can continue fucking like rabbits for 2 weeks or more.    We'll find out for certain next issue.   No matter the result, Sasuke is still a deadbeat dad.     Will Bolt have access to byakugan?  I could've sworn this little bastard was gonna be a major part of the Boruto movie, but nope. Squished like a rat. Fucking kek    the conflict and moral of the story is there   the entire moral lesson is pointless if it was all a misunderstanding because it has no relevance to Sarada at all. You just don't write moral lessons into stories just because they're nice moral lessons.   all the evidences of Karin are easily explainable   no it isn't. that's the problem. Occam's Razor tells us the simplest explanation would be Sasuke fucked Karin.           Her having Sakura's super strength means she'll probably just be a Sakura clone.  Why? Because she picked up Sakura's technique without even trying. No, you're right. She and her Sharingan will do nothing else for the rest of her life but throw super punches.     no Karin to cause drama and SS tears this chapter    What photoshopped pictures? Umbillical cord can easily be Salad's, since she was probably born in that very hideout, her appearance is based mostly on Sasuke while the rest is generic look of females in Naruto, eyesight is not restricted to genes only and that's the entire extent of evidences.     Glasses   Huge chakra       No matter the result, Sasuke is still a deadbeat dad.  What are the chances of that being completely glossed over as well?     Did Kishi already forget that Naruto has two kids?    How do you know it's the last?    kek, made by the Lonely Genbu right?    Where the fuck is Karin and why is she being a worse mother than Sasuke is a father?   He already forgot that Sasuke isn't Boruto's mom    Karin being cucked by Sasuke    The photoshopped pictures is anon talking about Sakura pasting a picture of herself over Karin for their 'family photo', I imagine.  The umbilical cord is kept by the mother to symbolize a link between mother and child and it's somewhat srs bsns over there, so Karin having it wouldn't make any sense unless she was either the mother or it was her own.      No, but there is no reason to involve Himawari in this story.  She would only get panel time via Bolt, and he gets the film whereas the downfall of Sarada is the point of the Gaiden.     You know, if this weren't Naruto your sarcasm might be warranted, but you know Kishi has pulled that shit before, and he may just as easily do it again    Hima is too young to fight.     Verbal ticks and power acquired through training are genetic traits.   Body type and fashion sense isn't.  Oh you SShits.   Kishi agrees though.          the entire moral lesson is pointless if it was all a misunderstanding because it has no relevance to Sarada at all. You just don't write moral lessons into stories just because they're nice moral lessons.  Except if you can't have the moral that there's no difference between A and B without outcome being specifically A it's bullshit. Sarada felt diconnected with her parents, after thinking Sakura is not her mother she had to think back and confirm the feelings she has for her as mother.  no it isn't. that's the problem. Occam's Razor tells us the simplest explanation would be Sasuke fucked Karin.  Because you don't know how to use it, Explanation for character in shonen manga cheating on his wife would be much more complex than wrong presumption.  And unlike you I still think both outcomes are entirely possible and logical because Kishy left himself enough room for both, not just the one I prefer.        Japs tend to have a boner for genetics/nature over nurture, so I'd say Sarada's style and speech patterns being a reflection of Sakura's suggests she's going to be the mother after all.  There will probably be some contrived explanation of Sakura needing Karin's help to deliver the baby or some shit, nice little ribbon to tie it all up to status quo.   I'd hope he'd go for a "family is who cares about you, not just your blood" bit, but I don't think the Japs go for that too much.         Her Sharingan is more than likely just going to go to waste. They're not going to turn Sarada into an edgelord so it's unlikely she'll ever unlock any of the Sharingan's major powers.And the whole point is that HER AURA IS SAKURA'S. Given the fact that absolutely none of the kids have been shown to have any original skills so far, and it's unlikely Sarada will master the Sharingan on any level like that of her dad, they're most likely just going to give her Sakura's useless strength and healing and make her second class to Boruto and Mitsuki.    What photoshopped pictures?    The picture of Karin she put her face over. Are you saying it'd be good to just write this off as "oh, she didn't have any other pictures of Sasuke to use."   Umbillical cord can easily be Salad's,   the fact that you think this hi-tech paternity testing equipment couldn't recognize that the two samples are from the same individual and believe that this would be good writing is astounding.   since she was probably born in that very hideout,    If the only secret was she was born outside the village. It's stupid that none of the characters just told her that.                   throw super punches  Don't forget healing as well, like almost literally every other Naruto girl.      and believe that this would be good writing is astounding.   Are you...expecting good writing from Naruto?      Sarada has Sakura's power, which is fucking logical as she has been living with Sakura for 12 years and, I bet, was taught by her. And that alone ruined her character? Are you fucking retarded? Her power is one aspect of her character, not the whole character. And before her fighting style has never been shown. This is just ludicrious.    Boruto movie out August, manga will most likely end around end of July.   unless kishi decides to continue        All I'm saying is that all the Uchihas that Itachi didn't kill have been talented and Sarada is on pace to be pretty good.  At least until she hits the Mangekyo ceiling. But who knows, maybe Naruto can recommend her for sage training later. He does need a true successor at some point.       It is something that can be learned, and honestly I hope that's what happened. I've wanted a character that used chakra chains offensively for ages and I think if Gaiden is trying to send a message of "it's bonds and not genes that matter", it would be far more effective if Kishi didn't go back on it by making this whole thing a misunderstanding. But it wouldn't be the first that he's made a point of something only to contradict it later and shoot himself in the foot (see: Naruto vs Neji in the chuunin exams); I think we knew this was going happen eventually. Sarada having Sakura's super strength has just driven the possibility home, and now people are getting asschapped and taking it out on Salad.  I still hope Kishi will surprise us at the eleventh hour but I don't think it's going to happen.      Are you saying it'd be good to just write this off as "oh, she didn't have any other pictures of Sasuke to use."  Well if they could make it, why would they still use the old one from the middle of shippuden?     The whole cuck thing was fun, but it's really overstayed its welcome. Either:  A) Sakura is the mother after all, the not-blood-family message is kneecapped and the entire Gaiden was a waste of time. (Pic related for one the worst movies I've ever seen.)  B) karin is the mother and either doesn't know or doesn't care, Sarada accepts Sakura as her mother, and the plot was again a huge waste of time.  Sakurafags didn't want this drama, Sakura haters won't want the inevitable scene where they make up. And we couldn't just have Boruto, Sarada and Mitsuki going on some missions. Fuck.             Sakura is Tsunade's daughter      I'd be willing to bet literal thousands of dollars that Naruto is going to wind up getting the DBZ treatment.   Mangaka claims to be done with it, executives seize the label and persistently squeeze out yearly video games and spin-offs to ensure nobody shuts the fuck up about it for a dozen years, and eventually it will be completely revived and Kishimoto will be dragged out of his deathbed and into the sunlight with no idea what the fuck a "Kakashi" is supposed to be       even cc2 stopped caring about her     They're not going to turn Sarada into an edgelord so it's unlikely she'll ever unlock any of the Sharingan's major powers.  She doesn't need to go down that road. Her sharingan already makes her better than what most people will be. All she needs is time to mix and match shit she sees into her own fighting style.   it's unlikely Sarada will master the Sharingan on any level like that of her dad  She's already developing faster than dad by activating her shit outside of life and death scenarios. She will never be Sasuke/Naruto tier but she could very well develop to be a Hokage candidate like the Third.         Mangaka claims to be done with it  That may not be the case once his bank account starts running low.     No fucking shit. It's kind of a big deal Kishi wrote the screenplay for the Boruto movie. If it is not a complete mess, he may continue the franchise that way.     Sarada felt diconnected with her parents   She only felt disconnected from Sasuke, whom she knew was her biological dad. She never started feel disconnected from Sakura until she began to think Sakura wasn't her mom after finding the picture and deduced that maybe the reason her parents' marriage seemed funny was because there was something scandalous going on. Had she not discovered the picture, life would have gone on the same for her. Making her Sakura's biological daughter, you essentially make the story one where Sarada already has a good relationship with her mom, falls into doubt about her paternity, force her to learn that it's not about the blood they share but the bond that transcends blood, only for it to not matter in the end because Sarada is Sakura's biological kid so everything can just go back to way it was before without a hitch. It's lazy storytelling at its finest. Even if a moral lesson is good, you don't make characters learn it who don't need learn it or have no immediate use for it. That's just a waste of a story. Sure, it might be good for someone like Sarada to know that anyway, regardless of who her parent is, but it doesn't exactly make for good entertainment.  Not only that, but as a narrative, you have a lesson that really doesn't have any evidence to prove it. If Sarada feels a connection with a dad she's never met but is blood related to and feels connected to Sakura who she blood related to, then she can't serve as an example of this moral. A better demonstration of the moral would be Iruka and Naruto but this was supposed to be Sarada's story.          She did feel disconnected with Sakura, she questioned her attitude toward's Sasuke's abscense several times, she didn't understood how can her mother be fine with father not seeing them for 12 years.    fucking hell the autism is real.  how the fuck do you guys think sarada was going to focus on sharingan-centered techniques or combat styles if she hadn't even awakened it yet? is it really so crazy to imagine that while her father wasn't there to teach her how to use the sharingan she instead picked up the style/techniques of the one parent who was there?  besides, just because she learned to use chackra for super strength, doesn't mean it's all she has, she probably has katon or raiton, maybe both, she now has the sharingan and who knows what the fuck else she could learn?          All she needs is time to mix and match shit she sees into her own fighting style.   I doubt we'll see any of this. Her role in the Boruto movie doesn't seem to be of any significance so I doubt we'll see her doing much at all.   but she could very well develop to be a Hokage candidate like the Third.   Even if she ever does become Hokage, she'll be Tsunade-tier, which is a disgrace.            Sarada is Sasuke and Sakura's daughter   Boruto is Naruto's son       B) karin is the mother and either doesn't know or doesn't care, Sarada accepts Sakura as her mother, and the plot was again a huge waste of time.  The plot wouldn't be a waste of time because the message is that a family is only a family if they care about each other. This chapter showed that Salad, Sasuke and Sakura cared about one another. And as long as Karin gets portrayed as someone who didn't give a shit about Salad, the plot would stay cohesive.    Why did Sasuke use amaterasu on the blades?   So Shin wouldn't use them against them    He was so fucking mad at them for hurting his waifu     She did feel disconnected with Sakura, she questioned her attitude toward's Sasuke's abscense several times, she didn't understood how can her mother be fine with father not seeing them for 12 years.   That has absolutely nothing to do with feeling disconnected with Sakura. She questioned her parents' marriage because it seemed funny they weren't together and that Sasuke never seemed to contact them. THAT WAS IT. Sarada didn't feel disconnected from Sakura until the picture and DNA Test led her to believe she wasn't Sakura's daughter. In case you didn't notice, Sarada wanted Sakura to be her mother and was devastated when she found out she wasn't.  Nowhere in Chapter 1 or 2 does she say anything like "I'm not like mama at all." Has Sakura not been so terrible at answering questions and maybe gotten rid of that picture, none of this story would have happened         Even if she ever does become Hokage, she'll be Tsunade-tier, which is a disgrace.   for what reason would she be tsunade-tier? just because she learned super strength jutsu she can't learn anything else? nigger she awakened the sharingan without needing to go insane or going full DARKNESS, she may just be able to go mangekyou without it too (like kakashi did, and it wasn't even his sharingan). fuck, with daddy sasuke genes god knows what sort of OP eye power bullshit she'll get.       &gt;Sarada is Sasuke and Sakura's daughter  top lel     The real question is why he hasn't already killed cuckura with the blades, magneto-style     She's the weakest of her team.     Ah, got it. Thanks.    kishi doesn't give two shits about hinata now that she served her purpose and made a naruto clone and himawari is a mini hinata     Her role in the Boruto movie doesn't seem to be of any significance so I doubt we'll see her doing much at all.  She's in the little tournament though its unknown how much of the actual tournament will be shown before things go south.   Even if she ever does become Hokage, she'll be Tsunade-tier  Why? Tsunade is an old woman who did nothing for decades. Also, she's only still alive because of her bloodlines. There's no real comparison there.        It seems like every piece of marketing goes "Sasuke and Sakura".  SS is ppular over there, right? Is it like a coincidence, or purposeful reassurance? Wishful thinking?       How do you know? We know shit about stretch.     yeah, because we know what that white-haired faggot's powers and strengths are, right? and we've also seen what bolt knows too right?     well then if cc2 is not giving a shit about hinata i might as well give up for part 3 now.     man, I thought they liked hinata? That's almost insulting and I'm not even a Hinata fag    sad but true     yeahsorry.jpg      She's in the little tournament    which will be interrupted by aliens and all she do is probably smash stuff.   There's no real comparison there.   Sarada will have the same useless abilities.     The promotional materials refer to Boruto as a prodigy and Mitsuki as a "superior ninja" shrouded in mystery. All the promotional materials say about Sarada is that she's Sasuke and Sakura's kid. Boruto has Naruto genes and Sasuke as a teacher. Sarada has a vagina which means she'll be useless.                 doesn't Shueisha or Namco Bandai decide, what will be printed for promotion?      Yeah...sorry.    only that mitsuki has stretchy arms and bolt has some chidori/rasengan kind of move  I really just want him to have the byakugan       Sarada will have the same useless abilities.  Tsunade has a Sharingan? Since when?   The promotional materials refer to Boruto as a prodigy and Mitsuki as a "superior ninja" shrouded in mystery. All the promotional materials say about Sarada is that she's Sasuke and Sakura's kid.  Is that because both are getting no screentime at all in the manga and require some kind of hype? I mean you can clearly see that Sarada is a prodigy of her own already.         *forehead poke*      I really just want him to have the byakugan   Bolt? He won't. He will get nothing of his mother, he's basically a sn child now.

Study hard every day!     Is this whole explanation supposed to be satire? Because all it did is convince me the person writing it thinks he is a Smart Person and can do no wrong. I'd heard of the eoten bullshit but this is the first time I've seen this pastebin.   What does ちやんと mean? I see it all the time but I can't find it in the dictionary.   ちゃんと.    Haven't been following these threads closely. Why is Yuuna posted so much?       国語  She's studying it, why aren't you?       It's just a new meme. Doubt it'll last long, though. At least it's more motivating than some of the other DJT memes though, so who knows.    T-thanks...   I know i shouldn't learn kanji like this but i can't grasp an understanding of 丁.   チョウ, テイ, チン, トウ, チ, ひのと  street, ward, town, counter for guns, tools, leaves or cakes of something, even number, 4th calendar sign  i don't fucking know        It's just got a lot of meanings. You'll learn them as you come across them. Without context it's pointless to try to think of every possible context it could appear in.    Anyone up to work on fixing the typos in the grammar guide of the website or are we going to wait for corくん to slowly fix it up while everyone uses it in the meantime?    I've downloaded the docx and had a look. Google ruins the style formatting which makes it easy to mass alter sections and it keeps freezing up when trying to do any online edits. Would anyone be interested in adding corrections as comments in a plain google spreadsheet? I've sent an email to corくん with a link to the document so he/she/they can see corrections as they are posted. No email response but it was only a few hours ago. Having that DoJG reference fixed up and realized would be a useful page/document/pdf for every Japanese language learner. Haven't found any errors in the first 30 pages. I can probably work through a couple of concepts a day. There are about 600 total with one person looking through one every day or two a few people could work through it in a couple of months without much effort. If corくん doesn't respond at all we can/someone can/I can add the corrections to the local copy and have that uploaded on the djt website offline grammar link with whatever file sharing site.

Sporadic reminder that once you get going and take the basics from /djt/ you should stop coming here, as the ever present toxic atmosphere that infest this thread could be detrimental to your japanese learning!  Today I learned the words さまさま and てわけど from watching Hibike Euphonium  I've been to the /int/ japanese thread and it's full of Britain-fags pretending they're better than everyone else because they have bad teeth and can travel the entire length of their shitty country by foot in a single day.   I think I'll stick right here in the ultimate-shit-tier Japanese-learning thread on 4chins.  That is all, /blog.      What's the feeling of sentences that end with が? I usually see it with interjections or insults. For example, what's the difference between バカ vs バカが?   Top row second from the right means hole.   So, since it's summer and I'm more NEET than ever because I just dropped my job, I thought I'll go for something different. Gonna start doing 100 words each day on anki+crams before bed. If I end up finishing core2k in about 100 days from now then you cunts can stop arguing about how cramming is bad. Used to do 40-60 a day, retention rate is 75% - 80%.  Gonna have some fun frying my brains here you meme loving fucks.       I'll look forward to it. How will we know it's you?  PS. I'm on your side. I do around 60-90 words a day.       I'll do 100 cards a day   I'll finish 2,000 in 100 days  There are more important things for you to be learning right now.      You should probably use that extra time to look for another job, you lousy bum.    This is me, I think I'll really need a therapist after this shite. Good luck to all you anons here as well.     Gonna start doing 100 words each day   If I end up finishing core2k in about 100 days       It's almost like you need to see a card more than once to memorize it.     I don't understand what the problem is, there are 6000 cards in the pack, if I do 100 every day that will be 60 days which is two months or so. But if I finish the pack on the 60th day then not all cards are in a mature state, that doesn't mean to complete. Well, technically it does, but if I don't know all that shit then it's not done, so I think 100 days is just right.     Godspeed anon. May you return to us in one piece.    Ok I was reading the guide, and I know a bit. And I was wondering how to properly use Anki.    I know a bit of japanese. To be precise I am totally comfortable with the kanas and I know more or less over 200 kanji (kinda). Which isn't much.  But i feel I am stuck now that I know the simple writing and super common words. What should I do?         What should I do?  Follow this http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.p<wbr>hp?id=5322</wbr>     thanks!    ケック   Do you ever lovingly look back at hiragana charts, thinking about how much progress and happy memories you've made?    shitty meme post   DJT in a nutshell.     Moved too many times since then and have long since thrown those things out to make it easier for changing living arrangements.    You are going to try and learn all the 2000 main kanji in just 3 months?    I read Yotsubato ~3 months ago and after that started doing core6k. Haven't read anything since but it feels good when I read random manga pages posted here and can actually read them without furigana  I learnt kana like  4 years  ago so I don't have any kana charts left       download the core 2k/6k deck   read tae kim to understand how the language works   finish it   start reading native material   use DOJG for grammar   Or you could do shit like RTK and waste your time.           I guess it's a long shot to say that but I'll do my best nonetheless. I'm not an expert with that moonrune shit but if I write them down every day it might work out.     I used to do 100 cards. It wasn't that hard but anki sessions were longer though.   Every Japanese teacher (native Japanese) that I have met owns an electronic dictionary. At times they will need to check theirs for terms that they are unsure about.  So even a native Japanese teacher carries an electronic dictionary, don't you think we as 4chan students who are seriously studying Japanese have more reasons to own one?     Imagine most people here already have local dictionary apps on their phones to begin with    For people with android tablets/phones, JED is a great dictionary, it can figure out verbs if you type them in already inflected and it picks up romaji as well if you can't be arsed to type the whole thing.     I know i shouldn't learn kanji like this  There's your answer.  retentive-kun posted a lot of spreadsheet errors with the text "NOT OCRED".

If both are in the guide, there's not enough argument to prefer one to the other. Pick one and stick with it, or not. This goes for ALL "X or Y?" questions.  5b) How long does it take to learn Japanese? Several years. A few if you merely want to read manga. Twenty plus if you're aiming for post-fluencey.  5c) How do I find reading materials? Read the OP.  5c2) How do I find LEGAL, FREE reading materials? http://www.aozora.gr.jp/  5e) How do I choose which Kanji reading to use? Should I learn On-Yomi and Kun-Yomi of Kanji?

Read the guide. https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1ynwmcFwy0ccT70cVRp-G97fYlcf-GYZ86T<wbr>62SvQMDdY/pub?embedded=true#h.1ci93<wbr>xb</wbr></wbr></wbr>                      </wbr>      </wbr></wbr></wbr>           But when 本 is origin, it's pronounced "もと"     日 = Sun   日 = Day   日日 != Sunday  It's a dumb language        <br/>     Yes, yes I can!     <br/>      If you take the like 400 means of every kaji in combination with compound kanji that means you have like 160000 different meanings from a single compound kanji, this is ridiculous.     Sure, but the meaning of the sign isn't limited to the pronunciation that way, 本物 (ほんもの) means genuine or real thing, not book thing   I think dekina-chan is undoubtedly best girl. She doesnt feed me any bullshit, shes just there to motivate.     This is why the "just learn vocab" mentality exists      it's also why teaching kanji in order of simplicity is batshit insane.   おちんちん大好きと言ったって何と思ったか   Come back when you can actually write a sentence correctly.   Can I recommend the Nihongo no Mori channel to be added to the guide?  https://www.youtube.com/user/freeja<wbr>paneselessons3  They have some English videos for N5/N4 so it's easier to get into now.   I wish somebody was there in my first year to slap me in the face for trying out Kanjidamage     </wbr>    Rikai firefox addon for android should be added to the guide too.  https://github.com/ispedals/Rikacha<wbr>n-Android/releases</wbr>    も - Mo' hook.  I've been going at Core2k/6k for almost 2 months now, but I haven't bothered looking into radicals. Should I worry about that?  When I look up 無 for example it says radical 火, but I don't really know how that works or how it helps me.      When I look up 無 for example it says radical 火, but I don't really know how that works or how it helps me.  That radical has multiple forms, like 人 does.

I don't really get it, but okay    For anyone who hasn't seen it, I can second this -- the nihongonomori channel on youtube is quite entertaining. (I've really enjoyed the N3 lessons so far.) Because the channel is almost entirely in Japanese, it doubles as listening practice.  Of course, it's no substitute for reading books. But it's just one more thing out there, and it doesn't suck. it can only help.      It's really great for testing your ability to follow instructions and building your sense of context.   kento -sensei best girl     Trying to read Yotsuba now. What I understand at the bottom is "Wow! There are houses here (daddy)!" The ここいえがいっぽい line has me stuck trying to figure out the whole sentence. Any advice for what I can do when Jisho leaves me confused?   I don't really get what your problem is but you do realize the "whole sentence" is ここ、家が一杯あるな right?    She's saying いっぱい - There are a lot of houses here!    Im a beginner, but ill practice. Koko means here. Ie means houses. Ga is the indentifier. And ippai means full of x with the ga and objet left to it.    I was talking about the missing information. But the other responses have made it clear to me.     tfw mom wont let me be neet on weekdays ;_;  You don't deserve to call yourself a NEET unless you've been one for at least a year.     When 火 is on the bottom of a Kanji, it turns into those four strokes and looks like the flame of a gas burner.  Thanks RTK.     The sentence is completely non-sensical. Don't try to read it, it might harm you.   What do you use for the majority of your reading practice?  I've been studying for over a year, but I have trouble getting in a lot of hours of reading per day. Sometimes I'll get lucky and get immersed in something that really grabs my interest, but when I finish that then it's followed by a month or two of meandering about and trying to find something that interests me.   I've tried to get more into VNs, but the lack of choices and interaction in most VNs bugs me too much when I know that 80% of the development time went into the lewd scenes and everything else is essentially just filler. It feels like putting in way too much effort just to read about mundane filler.       暗闇の中、急速に小さくなっていく光。   Help me out here with this sentence, I can read the kanji fine something about inside the darkness and a light quickly getting smaller.   But I can't figure out what words these hiragana in the middle are trying to make さくなっていく and how it'll further affect the sentence.        I know that 80% of the development time went into the lewd scenes and everything else is essentially just filler.  Try picking better VNs     Light Novels, they use furigana too which is great.    Play more plot based VNs. Here I really liked this one from last year https://vndb.org/v15871     LN   furigana  What LNs are you reading?      Arifureta is what.

Oh it's because they're running up the stairs and not just going up the stairs, I get it now. Thanks   REMINDER THAT YOU NEED TO PRACTICE LISTENING IN ORDER TO LEARN JAPANESE!  Speaking of which talk radio is impossible to find. Where can I find Japanese talking to each other casually no anime stuff but little girls voices will annoy me right now.   mfw found a rare picture of /djt/        No, it's awkward but after reading a bit I don't mind it so much. Much easier than reading English vertically.    Streams on niconico    I need an email to make one and I dint have one. Sucks for me    Yeah, too bad emails cost like a million dollars to make    Wow with this much dedication I'm sure you'll master Japanese in no time!    There are actually people on the Internet in 2015 that don't have an email address...    I have about 80 of them. I make one to do one thing than I delete all of my saved passwords nd everything.    Fuck you            I just made one I feel awesome now that I have an account with an actual Japanese name.  Anybody want to troll some live camshit or whatever with broken Japanese?         Why learn japanese? All the good VNs are translated. Muramasa is just chuunishit with a shitty high school protagonist. There are no beautiful brown goddesses waiting for you. Just go read Muv Luv instead.   Why even live? You are going to die anyways so might aswell hang yourself   I feel like I am accepting virues  I have no clue whats going on with niconico but im just staring at some ugly 4/10 degeneraate bitch and some dweebs talking to her     I'm almost one month into kanjidamage. Why do you recommend against it?    Can you not.    Can I not what?  I am trying to find some cam bitches or at least something instead of a bitch smoking which I instantly turned off.

It is something, certainly.    I honestly dont know anon I hit a bunch of random screens that said yes or no in the middle of another live thing and got redirected there.     Problem is it's kinda hard to really tell what works best since you don't really want to be doing two different decks just to compare. That said I think I'm doing okay with Kanjidamage so I'll probably stick with it even if it's "bad" because I would lose so much progress if I stopped.     Yes, all uncommon opinions are bait, very smart, anon.     Plenty of mediocre VNs are translated too    I find Japanese easier to read vertically.    I needed more.    Short phrases are easier to read horizontally, long sentences are easier to read vertically    I'm more used to manga and novels so I find it easier in general. For some reason with 横書き paragraphs often find myself losing place. Like a trained form of retardation.    It literally doesn't matter whether you start with KD or Heisig because once you start reading real material, you will learn a shit ton of new kanji.  Personally I started with KD just because it was shorter and easier to copy into anki.      When did you start? There has been a great RTK deck on anki for a few years, though mentioning it now doesn't help much.    When did you start trying to read shit? Grinding Anki isn't the most fun but at the same time I can usually only understand one or two words a page max so it's pretty futile for me at the moment.     I started 3 years ago, passed N1 this year.  Basically what I did was finish all of KD, then started on yahari vol 1 (pic related: took me an hour to get through the first time). After that, I just read various VNs and added new words into a seperate deck.  For grammar, I just picked up a JLPT grammar list and added them into anki, seperating them by levels.        英語を勉強しましょう！ https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NTr<wbr>W4DsIwp4</wbr>  [ ]    Lucky I am a year in and I don't even feel like I could pass N4 despite studying extremely hard everyday.      English Explosion    Where is that DOJG deck?  I am in a hurry and everything is moved...ill post lude if you deliver     I didn't do all the JLPTs either; I did N5 for fun, then just read whatever I wanted till I finally felt confident enough to tackle N2 and N1. If you really want to pass, you could always just do practice papers.  IMO, the beginning is the hardest, so if you keep at it, you will most likely git gud very quickly.      Thanks for the inspiration Especially with heavy manual labor im doing at my job I barely even practiced today and thats just a blog but I love a good success story.  3 years really isn't even that long hopefully I end up in that boat.  Post more         The four dots along the bottom is an alternate form of the fire radical.    When I was doing heavy labour at a factory, I told all my co-workers I was studying and they would leave me be, letting me rest and study my reps during lunch. I also told them I had night classes for my Japanese (not true) so I could pretty much pick and choose my OT.  Eventually you'll get into the pattern of studying and reading Japanese everyday and will do it everyday regardless of how tired you are.      I am going to actually do that I am mostly doing listening but reading is what I want to do  Thanks       How much do you think you could of possibly cut that time down by?    When I was doing a heavy labour job as an area supervisor in a factory and people found out I was learning "Nip shit" by seeing it on my phone during smoko, people stopped talking to me and a few guys considered me a "traitor".    http://www.mediafire.com/download/a<wbr>s2ji7a668a8bb5/DJT.みんな.7z It is in this package along with the rest of what CoR-Kun made.

Right, I've got it. Imagine all your buddies all love this new alcohol, but you can't stand it. Being a normie, your entire life revolves around how other people perceive you, and you think that makes you happy. So you work at it, slowly drinking sips of this terrible crap that tastes like bleach, until you burn off enough of your taste buds that you can drink a glass without throwing up, and smile while doing so like it's no big thing.  The normies happily welcome you back into the shallow group, and you have more perceived fun because people aren't being mean to you.   While the people here might laugh at you, and think that wanting to drink bleach is the biggest, most pointless waste of time ever, the point is that it makes you happy because it stops you being ostracised by your peer group.           So Japanese is like bleach? I don't get it.    Doing something hard can be the path to happiness, the true goal of any sentient creature.     Being a normie, your entire life revolves around how other people perceive you  Posted without a scrap of self awareness. Look where we are. 4chan, on a board so insecure that people resort to renaming file names of images posted just to stop the hordes of newfags screaming about where they think it came from and judging your entire post and value accordingly.   Normies care less about what people think about them than people here think about how their posts will be received.   Take a step back and have a look at your post again.          true goal   Does that mean you have a means to support yourself financially and live independently?     If this post isn't bait you need to leave your bubble every now and then.    Neither of those really lead to happiness.   Yeah, on the site where 99% of the userbase is anonymous and anyone can jump into any conversation, how other people perceive you is everything. Having to rename images you lazily saved from Tumblr because you had to use Google to find them is such a big hassle.      Any help with this? その他は、静岡県や広島県のように全部、県です。 I just can't make much sense of it.     Rough dude, sorry.    Context? It says that the others, like shizuoka and hiroshima, are prefectures.    What's confusing you?  その他は  The rest  静岡県や広島県のように  like shizuoka prefecture and hiroshima prefecture  全部  (are) all  県です  prefectures  I'm assuming you're getting tripped up by the comma? They don't necessarily divide off subclauses the way they do in English, they're simply inserted where a logical break is. The same sentence could be written without a comma.              Nah, Australian working class in a nutshell. Could be worse; could be homeless.    Neither of those really lead to happiness.  Without them you are dependant upon others and with your own reasoning just like the normies who depend on each other for their own security. You really aren't in a position to make judgements considering you are incapable to see beyond the edge of your nose.       Are there kanji that are identical in meaning?   Yeah 一 and 二 are basically the same thing for all intensive purposes i think lol.    I just couldn't make sense of how ように was being used. My guess was, "The rest are prefectures which are whole like Shizuoka or Hiroshima" but that just didn't make much sense.     Then your problem was thinking of 静岡県や広島県のように全部 as one clause, which it isn't. 全部 refers to the volume of the others which are prefectures.    I was just wondering since 温 and 暖 seem identical in meaning, please don't bully    There's a major difference between relying on people financially, and relying on others emotionally.  Basically everyone requires some form of financial "aid". You pay 5 bucks in taxes, so does the rest of your community, and suddenly you have enough for garbage trucks to take away your waste. Without the rest of society, you'd be living in a mud hut, throwing waste into a hole behind your hut.  The real trick to happiness is in understanding that it doesn't revolve around the things you own. It's easier than ever to be happy for free.         It's clearly saying that the rest are けん prefectures as opposed to と, ふ and どう.     That made perfect sense. Thank you.     If you have a question, don't be coy, just ask it. No two kanji and no two words are going to be literally identical, there are always differences in nuance/usage/formality/etc. http://okwave.jp/qa/q1327169.html gives some explanation on 温 vs 暖 specifically, but really it's not something I'd be worried about. If you understand the difference between 暖かい and 温かい that's going to be enough.    Yeah, no one is disagreeing with that.        pic related: took me an hour to get through the first time  mein neger. that fucking page.  For me the most frustrating part about reading is forgetting words I had only just looked up minutes ago. I really can't remember words unless I drill them in anki, which makes reading new material difficult.   There are hardcore language schools that get students to N1 in 2 years. But they're actually located in japan. check out nisshinkyo.org or jasso.go.jp for information. If you're on your own, I don't know.           don't be coy      Yeah, no one is disagreeing with that.  Your translation implies that the ones references by the pronoun are not prefectures.     lol epic gif    I don't see how     Your translation implies that the ones references by the pronoun are not prefectures.  How? "the rest are prefectures". Where are you getting not prefectures, and what pronoun are you referring to?     Fucking ESLs. Stop posting if you don't even know English.      When you use the phrase その他, or "the rest ..." in English, you imply that the following statement does not apply to the the aforementioned set (unless you include も or "also" in English). When you finish the sentence by saying "prefectures" the implication is that the aforementioned set are not prefectures. That is not what the sentence is saying though, they are all prefectures. It is saying they are prefectures that use the 県 suffix.       When you use the phrase その他, or "the rest ..." in English, you imply that the following statement does not apply to the the aforementioned set (unless you include も or "also" in English).  I have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. When someone says "the rest are xxx", they mean quite simply that "the rest are xxx". I.e., the rest are part of xxx.     You will never learn English. "The rest, like..." means "the rest, including...".  Maybe you're confused by double commas? They work like this: "The rest (like x and x) are all prefectures".  Stop posting forever.        Okay thanks    "The rest" implies that there are others that are not included in the set you are talking about. You can't say "the rest" to mean "all" for example.   I wasn't even referring to the middle part of the sentence, that is irrelevant as it is just an adverb. I was referring to the その他 which implies there is some other set (references by the pronoun それ).         (references by the pronoun それ).   There is no それ in that sentence.       "The rest" implies that there are others that are not included in the set you are talking about.  Yeah, there are, and they're not a part of this sentence, having been described in some earlier sentence presumably. Neither  nor  says otherwise.     その他 makes the entire sentence contrasting with the implied previous set. That means when you translate 県 as just "prefecture" the implication is that the previous set are NOT prefectures. Do you understand what I'm saying now? The sentence in Japanese is not implying that though.    Ah, I get the point he's making now.  Here's the hypothetical complete text.  X, X, and X prefectures are exceptions, ending with と, ふ and どう respectively.  All the rest, like shizuoka-ken and hiroshima-ken, are prefectures ending in ken.   This is text explaining the differences between prefectures, the mistake being made is translating 県 to just prefecture.             Exactly.     This is why I asked for context at the very beginning:  , which was never given      その他 makes the entire sentence contrasting with the implied previous set  Yeah, just like "the rest" does in English. It's the subject of the sentence.   That means when you translate 県 as just "prefecture" the implication is that the previous set are NOT prefectures.  No, English doesn't somehow magically change because it's translated from Japanese. "All the rest are prefectures" is still an appropriate translation, because we're saying this second set (like hiroshima and shizuoka) are prefectures (unlike some other set).         the mistake being made is translating 県 to just prefecture.  If this is your problem with the sentence, it has nothing to do with "the rest" and everything to do with whether or not to translate 都道府県 to "prefecture" always.  can't explain his way out of a paper bag.     To add, there are actually 4 exceptions, both Osaka and Kyoto are fu (府) prefectures. Tokyo is -to (都), and Hokkaido is -do (道).   To be fair, the context is obvious if you know about prefectures. The mistake was just taking -ken as prefecture, when it only actually applies to 43 out of 47.   The other set are also prefectures. This is just a piece of text explaining the differences between the 47.         I understand なんか in most cases but I'm still trying to learn all the nuances of the word. How would you say it's being used in 「なんかすごそう」? Is it like "Kinda amazing"?    because we're saying this second set (like hiroshima and shizuoka) are prefectures (unlike some other set)  At least you understand what you are saying, but you need to read more if you think that translation is appropriate here. It is very obvious what the sentence is referring to. All you did was copy and paste an edict definition and I was just correcting you.   It adds emphasis.         The other set are also prefectures  No, they're not. They're 都　府　and 道. Just because the difference doesn't come out doesn't mean  and  are incorrect.   To be fair, the context is obvious if you know about prefectures.  Yeah, which is why your blathering about "the others" and sets is confusing as all hell.          It adds emphasis.   That's what I thought. Asked a Japanese guy I talk to and he said it was more like "somewhat". He probably just misunderstood.        All you did was copy and paste an edict definition and I was just correcting you.  All I did was write down a simple explanation. I lived in Osaka for a year, I know how the fucking naming system works. Don't act like you're the only one in these threads who knows something.      They're 都　府　and 道.  Those words don't exist in English. If you look up "Prefectures in Japan" on Wikipedia it will say there are 47. The word prefecture in English refers to all 47.     No, they're prefectures, you stupid sack of shit. What, you think Japan has 43 prefectures and 4 weird magical areas? 都道府県. They're 4 kinds of prefectures.    You shouldn't really read too much into it. It's a filler word, it can mean a lot of different stuff, or it can mean nothing at all. Neither emphasis nor "somewhat/kinda" is necessarily wrong. The only way to get a feel for it is to read more and encounter the word a lot.     Okay. Thanks.    You guys will argue about anything.    The guy asked for an explanation, not a translation. Given , I think he got it just fine. Then  comes along like he's proving people wrong but really he's just elaborating on what was already there.    People take a lot of pride in things they've spent thousands of hours doing.         tfw always try and argue my point based on facts and then people just call me names because they can't think of an argument       When a question is posed, it doesn't just puzzle the guy who made it. Plenty of people were confused. I almost went away thinking that "all the rest (...) are prefectures" was right.  The guy who kicked off the argument made it weirdly, but by drawing attention to the incorrect statements, he improved my knowledge of Japanese.  That's something to respect. I knew about Tokyo-to, but I didn't realise it was a substitution for the prefecture kanji. Now I know more about the language, so get fucked for crying about someone elaborating on a topic.         Not my fault some moron can't just explain what he means instead of spending 5 posts telling me I'm saying something I'm not.     Saying "the rest (...) are prefectures" is wrong. It implies the existence of earlier groups that aren't prefectures.  I'm assuming you're  here. Just because the original poster possibly understood part of your explanation because he had the additional context, that doesn't mean you were correct. At the very least, you misinformed the thread at large.     Translating short sentences in Japanese with a lot of information to English is hard without it sounding superfluous and unnatural.   He did nothing wrong faggot.    Yeah, and you spent 4 posts (   ) going on about the meaning of その他 and "the rest" without just explaining that your problem was with 都道府県 vs ”prefecture".     Not my fault some moron can't just explain what he means instead of spending 5 posts telling me I'm saying something I'm not.  It is easier to spend ten posts insulting someone than one post clearly explaining something you aren't capable of explaining.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127152120  What? Were you just having a go at anon based on that post? The fuck does that even mean?    My mistake, I misread his post.    Read first before jumping to insults. You aren't a child and this isn't /b/.    Uh, thanks? And you're not the warden of this thread, so fuck right off.    That wasn't me. Honestly, it took me 3 of those posts to even understand what he was getting at. He did it poorly, but he was vindicated in the end.  I get that you might have just simplified it down to prefecture because you just wanted to explain the grammar quickly. Let's pretend that you knew all along about the 4 types of prefecture, and just chose to be incorrect to explain it faster.  Even so, other people can read your post and be misled. In the best case scenario, you're still in the wrong for not thinking of the other ~49 people here who could also be confused by the sentence.        This is an 18+ board. If you are a child you shouldn't be posting here. Drop the attitude and grow up.    貴方様が朝廷の命で東の地へ悪魔調伏の遠征にでかけて幾年・・・  pls help  Oh, how I wonder how many years it has been since you set out on your eastern exorcist expedition with orders from the Imperial Court...         you're still in the wrong  I'm not saying my explanation was better than his, I'm saying his shitty way of being confrontational and awful at explaining is infuriating.     I wasn't confused by anything, all I learned was there were 4 types of prefectures.    What don't you understand? ~の命で would be "on orders from ~", not really "with orders from ~". "Oh, how I wonder" is also a bit grandiose.    To that, I'd say that I'll take a million "lol u suck at Japanese nub here's a cryptic way to find the real translation" over a single "yeah, that's just about correct" platitude.  Calling someone out on being wrong is a very important part of learning a language. Never tolerate bad translation work, and always strive to improve.  If the guy was having a go at you for making a minor grammatical error, fair enough. But it was a key point that changed the whole meaning of the sentence.         you're still in the wrong for not thinking of the other ~49 people here who could also be confused by the sentence.  What has that got to do with anything? Are you here to impart knowledge or act like a bitch and "win" massive internet fights?     She's writing a letter m8. Just trying to make it flow with her usual way of talking.     Never tolerate bad translation work, and always strive to improve.  I don't know why you're lecturing me on this, as I said before this isn't a translation and the problem with the original had nothing to do with the translation of 県 in any case. It's great if someone wants to point out that translating 県 that way is incorrect, but don't come in like "oh it's CLEARLY ~" as if the other people have no idea what they're talking about. If someone wasn't reading the original, they would be confused on 県/prefecture/都道府県, but that isn't what  had a problem with.     Even more reason to avoid the "oh", because then you're having her specifically write that out. It's not that strong, and it's closer to a simple "how long ~".    OK. Please give me the finished sentence. It's not for some scanlation or some crap, just personal curiosity.    This is a thread about learning Japanese. If you made an explanation based on incorrect knowledge, and I'm not saying that's what happened this time, wouldn't you want to be called out on it?  Hell, getting mad about getting owned at Japanese should motivate you to study harder so you don't get rekt next time.  Conversations here aren't 1 to 1, there are always other people reading, or waiting to butt in.   But you didn't think about everyone else reading that line out of context. "The rest are all prefectures" is an incorrect translation. Nobody would have cared if you had said "The rest all have a -ken suffix." or "the rest are all prefectures ending in -ken".  Even someone who knew about the difference would be misled if they just read your English translation.             How many years has it been since you left on your exorcist expedition to the east on orders from the imperial court...  Not very good English but the meaning is there.       Hell, getting mad about getting owned  How old are you?      But you didn't think about everyone else reading that line out of context.  My goal is to answer the question. If someone else has a better explanation to offer, fine, but don't insult my English and make me chase an explanation out of you.    is not me, by the way.        owned   rekt   Fuck off.      I considered removing the e to make the joke more obvious, but I didn't think anyone would actually bite.  I'm in my mid 20s. I think. It's been a while since I checked, the years kind of blur together.   You answered the question poorly. You can have the best intentions in the world, but language doesn't care. You're either wrong or right.          You're either wrong or right.  Horseshit, correctness in language is one of the least binary things I can think of. This is a great example of how grey it can get.     That's just sad.    The true meaning wasn't conveyed, in either a literal or figurative sense. Although it wasn't your intention, you misled people, including myself. Being corrected when that happens is only natural.     You could search OCR in the archive and see what you come up with.  I tried "OCR", "OCRED", "OCR+deck", "OCR+anki", "OCR+dojg", "OCR+dictionary", "OCR+do" and so far haven't found anything that hasn't already been fixed some time earlier in the current docx file hosted on mediafire and linked on the djt website front page. If people added relative keywords to their posts I would be able to find them easier but aren't finding anything new so I'm going to abandon the archive and instead keep going through it on my own and adding them to the spreadsheet I linked earlier, with the naive hope that other people will add their corrections anonymously.   I'll probably repost the post again in the next thread I can post in. When people teamed up together and rebuilt the djt.みんな website it made me feel like pitching in and doing something. Maybe if I keep posting it in different threads some people might feel like joining in. Anyway, thanks for the tip for the archive. Every drop in the bucket, etc.        Being corrected when that happens is only natural.  You still seem to think that I'm angry about being corrected about 県 vs prefecture, which isn't the case. Prefecture is inadequate if you're not aware of the context. The problem is that the fucker started lecturing about "the rest" in English because he instantly assumed that if I didn't bite his と　どう　ふ post () I must have some other problem. He didn't even consider the alternative, which is that I wasn't even thinking about the distinction between 都道府県 and prefecture. People don't like it when they're talked down to in regards to their native language.   There's no point to this discussion any more, there's no fundamental disagreement and just residual frustration from an argument that shouldn't have been there in the first place.      Can you name all the Todoufuken? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bDr<wbr>mxbYb_R8</wbr>  [ ]    I am 32 and you have presented yourself in a way I would have been ashamed of to do in my mid 20s. Oh well, different generations might have different ideals of appropriateness. Sage for off topic.     I wasn't even thinking about the distinction between 都道府県 and prefecture  If that's the case, then it's fine. The whole thing is a question of context. At the start of this argument, you insisted that you knew the difference, which to me meant that you willingly misled to oversimplify.  If you just didn't realise, then it's no harm, no foul. While you might have realised it from , others, including myself, didn't. The additional explanation was valuable.       That was hilarious.   I love the word for gloves, 手袋, because it's literally "hand" and "sack" and for some reason that's very cute.   Youre cute    お袋   Rikaikun is just fantastic     Japanese standup and live comedy is so much more enjoyable than most of their TV.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kbh<wbr>T8g43zQ4</wbr>  [ ]  Who can watch things like this and honestly have no interest in wanting to speak? Such an enjoyable flow.       I made another (easier) one.      A had b call c. Adversative passive. It's definitely not a sentence you're going to see very often on account of how stupid it looks and the fact that form of the passive isn't as common as you'd think given how often it comes up in learning materials.    A had b allow him to do. Could be a did to b depending on context.    People have these notions before the start learning a language that numbers like 75%, or 90% are big. To read and enjoy something without a dictionary you would need at least 99% comprehension. That means not knowing 1 in 100 words, which is quite a bit still.     Could be a did to b depending on context.  What do you mean?     One word a page is quite doable, especially since if you know a lot there's a very good chance the remaining few words are not as critical and/or will be explained by the text explicitly.    Yeah that's what I'm saying 99% can be enjoyable. Knowing 90% of the words however is not knowing a word every 1-2 sentences, but for some reason people always talk about how "6000 words accounts for 90% of the language" like it's all that impressive.    させてもらう/させていただく are often used to just mean "to do". Especially the latter. If a was getting permission from some third party, it would basically just be aがbにする.    I suppose it depends on your definition of a word, but 99 percent is usually less than one per page. 95 percent even isn't impossible. I don't want to get into a debate on exactly what percentage of vocab is necessary to read, though.    させてもらう just drops the stuff before it, it doesn't change the meaning (unless I'm not understanding correctly.)  させてもらう - I will do it (私はXに) させてもらう - I will do it       I was just talking about what can be enjoyable without a dictionary. With a dictionary you can read with far less of course.    I'm not sure what you mean by "drops the stuff before it". It's a pretty contextual phrase, and the literal meaning is to be allowed to do something. Euphemistically it's often used in the sense of simply "do". I don't know what the original post was getting at, but it's not exactly the best sentence for this sort of thing.    It is impressive in the manner how the Pareto principle takes effect and how this can be used for a wider approach to easing into reading native media. If someone is willing to learn two or six thousand of the "most frequent" (how that is complied is obvious going to change the outcome) words in a given media/genre/etc. and they have positive results it can be a powerful motivating factor for further individual learning. All about how it can be spun: having to look up one or two words every sentence to read things vs. only having to look up a word or two on average every sentence with native media.  A person could spend X amount of time looking up every word they come across and it would cover the most frequent words more or less within a few dozen pages of reading but they might not have the motivation to do so. Anything that can encourage people to put up with while progressing is impressive to me. An benign exaggeration?      Like I said, I can be translated to that, the meaning doesn't really change in Japanese though. It can be "I will be let to do that (regardless of whether he actually lets me or not)" which bad guys say a lot in shounen manga. The literal meaning doesn't change though, in the sense that the particles come before it play the same role. It could never mean A did to B, B is the one letting A to it.  Just because you can translate it in some contexts as "I will do it" does not mean that you can just replace させてもらう with する and have it mean the same thing. The particles would mark different things if that were the case.        It just seems that a lot of people have a misconception of what % of comprehension feels like. 90% is not fluently reading, 90% wouldn't even be classified as i+1 I don't think according to Stephen Krashen. You can spin it in a possitive light, most people do, but it just sort of feels like lying to do that. Reading with 90% comprehension is not very satisfying.    Ok, I'm not saying you can change it する all the time or whatever. Given the right context though, に could mark the target of する, and not もらう. All it would require is some third party to which the received permission is implied.   It's a contrived interpretation that isn't likely, the only reason I'm bringing it up is because I'm not sure what the original poster thinks is tough about the sentence.       everything i know is easy  It isn't tough if you know the grammar, it is if you don't. Causative changes the subject to に and then もらう brings it back to が.      Reading with 90% comprehension is not very satisfying.  For you maybe but for learners only having to look up 10% of words is far more satisfying than having to look up 90% of words. You are either not being very realistic, don't read much, don't read things you are interested in, or are projecting your feelings onto everyone else.   It is going to take a long time before a learner can read "fluently" and to have an attitude that it isn't going to be satisfying until you begin to approach that is pointlessly negative for a learner. It is like someone walking to lose weight being pissed off that they cannot compete in national sprinting track and field events. Perspective is important in all aspects of life.       If that aspie wants to teach people about the passive tense he should just refer them to a legitimate resource, maybe DoJG, rather than spam some sentence he dreamed up that japanese autists wouldn't use.     everything i know is easy  See, you say that, but when the guy phrases the image as some kind of challenge, you lose the ability to make this defense.     Oh is this something that's been posted before? First thing I thought of was that buffalo sentence. It's just some extreme "I am very smart" bullshit.   Everywhere I read that ある　is used for inanimate and いる　for living things.  Then why is the famous novel titled "吾輩は猫である"? Shouldn't it be いる at the end regarding that rule?     In that case it was just to keep consistency with the other pic.    である is used differently from the regular verb ある. It's a copula.    I went through all of that with Japanese already and reading and 90% comprehension is not as good as it sounds on the surface.   Perspective is important in all aspects of life.  You say that, but you are the criticizing me for having a different perspective than the norm on statistics like that.       Not that guy but missing 10 percent of words means you're basically just deciphering. That's how you get guesslation garbage like what gets posted in here pretty regularly.     To put it in perspective if I had 90% fluency in English I'd have had to look up 12 words in your post alone. What a pain in the nuts.      he should just refer them to a legitimate resource, maybe DoJG  The passive tense section in the grammar introduction of the Basic volume of the Dictionary of Japanese Grammar series was posted in response to this in one thread and people argued over the validity of that and one autist, likely the one who was posting this image initially, started an argument how the DoJG isn't reliable because it is "old", or something.  They probably aren't interested in actual discussion when posting this. Yet another troll forcing a meme.    Pic related for an explanation.    I'm criticising the attitude presented, not you personally, because it is pointlessly negative and serves no utility.   Not if you look the words up. This is why I expressly mentioned   only having to look up a word or two on average every sentence with native media  It is going to be a long time before you can stop looking up words and there is no other way around this than to keep powering on. Putting a needlessly negative spin on this only serves to make the progression feel worse than it is.     To put it in perspective if I had 90% fluency in English I'd have had to look up 12 words in your post alone  To put it in perspective if you were an English language learner having to look up 12 words in my post is better than having to look up every second word. Going from every second word to 12 words out of hundred is a vastly noticeable progression. Take some time to see how far you have come every now and then and it might not feel like such a pain. Or choose to dwell on things which aren't going to change for a long time that do nothing but make you feel negative, making it even hard to continue on.  Distance runners often develop aches and pains while running. With several kilometers to go, focusing on the pain instead of focusing on keeping in motion is admitting defeat. There is "realistic" and there is being smart. Smart people win long races.                    Is grammar easier than studying vocab or not?   How do you propose going from deciphering to fluent reading without looking things up?    Keep deciphering and studying until you get it. I don't know why that other guy is going on about "negative attitudes", being pragmatic doesn't mean being negative or cynical, nor is it meant to discourage people who know very little. Your attitude is your own.    Depends on how you look at it. There are several hundred usages of common particles and structures which are taught as 'grammar'. There are also several tens of thousands of words to learn.   If you invest time into grammar and reading the chances are the gaps in your knowledge will be vocabulary based long, long before they are structural comprehension/grammar based. On the flip side the wider you read the more unknown words you will come across. Grammar as a formal or structured approach to study is probably multitudes less involved, time wise, than the process of vocabulary acquisition. Have a balances study of both and you will see for yourself which is harder or easier for you. It is hard to give a cut and dry answer without it being misleading.       Thanks anons.      Thank you, i just finished anki reps today, i'm taking a break now and looking forward to start tae kim!     I think you missed the entire point of his posts. Otherwise the question of looking up words wouldn't have been presented, as it was mentioned in this post  right at the start   For you maybe but for learners only having to look up 10% of words is far more satisfying than having to look up 90% of words.  The response seems cynical and ignoring the points presented, as though the opinion was already formed and nothing else really mattered.     Suggest me something good you guys have read    pointlessly negative  You are being pointlessly positive though.     I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at or which response you're referring to specifically, but as I see it  seems to take issue with realistic views on what is and isn't "readable". 90 percent comprehension is going to lead to regular errors even after looking up, because at that point you're going to be missing entire clauses and be generally confused. Sure, a beginner might be happy to figure out most sentences on a page and only make a serious error every now and then, but that doesn't change the fact that it's barely good enough to even call it comprehension.   This is just how it is, and we don't need more n3 champions going around attempting to translate stuff they can't even read without looking up every tenth word. If they can't stay motivated just because of this, fuck them. I'm happy to help people but I'm not here to convince them to keep going.      are you the same memelord that posts the mount stupid thingy     Harry Potter     That sounds very hard to do in jap    It is but that's why we're learning right?    True, my end game is to finish the hole harry potter series in jap like any other anon here    That guy just has no perspective.  Everything you said is correct. 90% comprehension is only beginning to scratch the doorknob when it comes to fluency. His counter is that 90% is greater than 45% or something, which doesn't counter what you said in the least.  It's like you're trying to convince a bum that $1k is not a lot of money. Either they get it or they don't, man.         scratch the doorknob   What the fuck?      You can't learn English.     my fucking sides      Are you sure it's not you?      pointless positive   That's a real head scratcher.    This is just how it is, and we don't need more n3 champions going around attempting to translate stuff they can't even read without looking up every tenth word.   Which has nothing to do with a beginner using something like a frequency based approach to early vocab learning, such as the Core2k/6k10k programs/anki decks.   I'm happy to help people but I'm not here to convince them to keep going.  Why are you in these threads at all? All you have done is spread opinions on how people should enjoy media in a negative manner and brought up red herrings. Do you realize that these threads are entirely for the benefit of learners and supporting each other?   You might not be here to convince anyone to keep on going but by the same token you shouldn't be here convincing people of pointlessly misleading and negative things such as needing an above 90% comprehension to be able to enjoy reading. The only people who make such statements are monolinguals who have no understanding of what it is like to function in a different language. Children know far less than 90% of the words in many books they read but it doesn't stop them from reading on. These are the same children who end up reading more than others and also end up having a stronger grasp on the language as adults.   90% comprehension is 90% comprehension. This may be belong the threshold for being able to enjoy reading but for people who make a habit of acquiring multiple languages it is more than enough to keep them going and learning more. The basic message of the Guide boils down to "read as much as possible". Making this seem harder to the naive fresh off the bus beginners does nothing but instil a sense of foreboding. They don't need this. Think of it like a team; we are all working together to create a productive space highly receptive to beginners. The thread is for them first and foremost.              The path to fluency can be visualised as opening a door. 90% is like "scratching the doorknob". Not even a firm hold.  As a native English speaker, the meaning is clear. Not everything has to be a set phrase.       90% comprehension is only beginning to scratch the doorknob when it comes to fluency.  I forgot language acquisition was a binary process.   How many languages have you learned?        He means scratch the surface although substituting it for doorknob is a non-trivial error so maybe scratch the doorknob is a valid idiom his usual language.       I'm sorry, the guy is pretending to be a native speaker by defending such ridiculous things as "scratch the doorknob"   I can't stop laughing at how stupid it is.  My fucking sides are in orbit    I haven't even begun to scratch the doorknob of languages              Do you scratch a doorknob before turning it? I'd grasp it myself.   ITT: Gay couple      not these two       Video editing confirms.     that princess carry     100% confirmed     My heart's not over the Cyan and Retoree plotblock, but I absolutely love the last episode for that, at least.     Basically Makoto x anyone   What should Shuzo do?   Meant to reply      Good question. That is one pushy fuccboi, but I just don't think that that can stand up to the power of a man with a full-time job. It's best if Rom handles the pushing.     What if Shuzo pushed himself onto Rom?      Rom would just push back even harder.  Shuuzo should stick to pulling.      Pulling what exactly?    Just like in that image, pulling Rom Closer to him. He's been stalking patiently, waiting for the opportunity to strike and when he spotted Aion, he fucking leapt on it.   I have already been missing this.      No homo though  Are grils fine too?   If they're gay, they're okay    He just wanted to be helpful. ;_;    He just wanted an excuse to talk to Rom again and to hear his masculine, forceful voice.  It's okay my dear anon, they made up in the end and went on to have lots and lots of years-overdue makeup sex.  Unlike a certain other pairing       At least that pairing got an on-screen hug.    Fair enough. We couldn't get on-screen pic related, but at least we're free to imagine  and browse pixiv    Rom in a dress  This speaks to the darkness inside my boner.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127138357  D-Don't look, author-sama!

You tell me.     pic unrelated  Stop wearing your fujo glasses, they're simply family      not spoilering the lewd     Whelp, he said "no homo", so it's definitely straight as can be.    I suppose I must be a deranged pervert.      not posting the cutest   At least the /y/ hambeastening keeps itself contained to one thread.   That's generally how these things work.    Nice buzzwords, friendo    I didn't realize /y/ was this legitimately mentally retarded. Okay.     /y/ is mostly westernshit now, unfortunately.  Anyway, back to gay       Only in Killua's dreams.     ignore and report, friendo     Are you perhaps bothered by something, anon?

Maybe because they can see the amount of samefagging in this fujoshit thread in this thread with 16 unique ips.     No nipples.  Why ?       When's the last time you saw nipples on anyone, male or female, in an anime? The '00s maybe? I can't even remember. I think the Nips put nipples in their lewd laws or something.    Bahamut and Shit la Shit both had man nips      tumblr gifs      Beach episode of Ore Monogatari    Female nipples are not rare in BDs, some show up in TV, too.    Because the female love interest is actually relevant and is guaranteed to win in Owari.    This show    That isn't really gay since Enkidu is genderless.   Because they know the author and know that at some point Mika is probably going to overcome his edginess and start shipping Yuu and Shinoa.        Yuu and Shinoa.   Disgusting.       Yuu and Shinoa   Shit pair, shittiest fans.       I want baiting to fuck off and die.      l-lewd       Shinoafaggots can't keep their fucking snouts out of anything. They're the worst self-inserters on the board and take offense to anyone not treating Yuu like a blank slate that exists purely to be shipped with Shinoa. They don't even care that Yuu and Shinoa have zero chemistry whatsoever because they want to fuck Shinoa and therefore so should Yuu. Their cancer is on tumblr's level, as far as I'm concerned.    Shinofag has arrive to kill the fun, as usual.    I will eradicate them. Every last one.      The guy wrote LoLH and the manga is released in a shonen magazine. It doesn't matter what you think, the end result isn't hard to predict.      I want to disagree with you because I like Shinoa and I don't think there's anything wrong with liking her, but those threads are just so shit.     There is a thread dedicated to her when they can masturbate in peace   Somehow he felt he needed to shitpost in this istead of hiding and moving on.       They don't even care that Yuu and Shinoa have zero chemistry whatsoever because they want to fuck Shinoa and therefore so should Yuu.  Isn't the exact same true for Mikafags?        muh smug-chan hurr durr   so smugdere hurr my dick is diamonds   why is she so smug durr   Kill every last one of them.        Mika and Yuu grew up together, there's actually a fucking basis for liking them as a potential couple. Shinoa and Yuu met recently, all their interactions are forgettable and bland, and presently there is no earthly reason for Yuu to reciprocate her retarded crush other than the fact that she's cute, which means absolutely nothing in an anime series where goddamn everyone is cute. This ship is pure shit and only cancerous self-inserters would ever like it or defend it.      mad fujoshits       come into a gay thread just to shitpost  Sounds like hetfags are the ones who are mad.     Go back to tumblr, landwhale.  Only your tears can be understood by your fellow tumblr pod.      You're damn right I'm mad. I like this series and the threads for it before the anime used to be comfy, now they're just cancer-ridden Shinoa circlejerks.    Since you seem lost:     I'm sure the three other shitposters in here really appreciate how hard you're trying to fit in.    &gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/      Since you hambeasts can't seem to stick to your containment boards.        I always wonder who they think they're fooling when they show up to gay threads. We know why you're here, you don't have to hide it.    Maybe you can cry into Shinoa's bosom about it.     Says the landwhale caught samefagging in this thread hours ago.  How pathetic to not realize her pathetic imagedump thread was only kept alive by her fellow herd samefagging with just 4 people.          this thread    Funny because you fujoshits have never fit in on /a/ and constantly get pointed out and ridiculed  One look in the archive and you can seem how so many of you are incapable of reverse image searching on google and need to constantly beg for source.  I guess it is to be expected over how dumb fujoshits are.        The reason nobody responded to your post back then is because it's obvious you have no idea what samefagging is.     there's actually a fucking basis for liking them as a potential couple  What basis? Them being brothers doesn't mean that they're ever going to be gay for each other. Admittedly, Mika is probably gay, but Yuu doesn't really treat him any differently from anyone else he sees as family.   all their interactions are forgettable and bland  Their interaction are among the few non-bland and non-forgettable parts of the series.   and presently there is no earthly reason for Yuu to reciprocate her retarded crush other than the fact that she's cute  No one is saying that he has to reciprocate her feelings now. Doesn't mean he can't develop feelings for her over the course of the series. It's not hard to imagine, since they are among the few characters who have a decent dynamic going.   This ship is pure shit and only cancerous self-inserters would ever like it or defend it.  Or people who just like the banter between Yuu and Shinoa. Or those who payed attention and realized that there's no real chance of Mika winning so shipping him with Yuu is kinda pointless.              Kill all s-s-s-s- Shinoafags     Keep telling yourself that.    Why do landwhales make it so easy to identity themselves?  They still can't give up their cancerous spoiler tagging abuse in their posts.         I know why you are here and I'm going to supply you with what you're looking for.  Pic related, it's what you came into this thread for.          Their interaction are among the few non-bland and non-forgettable parts of the series.  Shinoa herself is not bland or forgettable, but her interactions with Yuu aren't anything special. She plays better off Mitsuba, in my opinion.    Were they gay?   Don't worry, I have what you need.  Do you get too embarrassed trying to look up Yuu/Mika on Pixiv? Like it'd be the final nail in your gay coffin?      The slutty one kind of flirted with Nonon that one time, but he was kinda gay with his sewing friend. I suppose he's a bifag.    No yeah, she's great, I wanna be clear. I enjoy her, it's her cult I can't fucking stand.  That said, please. Anons, instead of going to the trouble to compose a response to these glorified brick walls of edgy memes and buzzwords, isn't it easier and far less frustrating to just ignore and report? If you choke a flame it can't spread.  Enough of this gay shit, let's get back to talking about homosexual relationships or subtext in Chinese cartoons.          I like Shinoa herself too, it's her fucking fans that need to kill themselves. But you are right, there is no point in talking to them and more than enough reason to carry on with the original topic.     implying lolheroes and shone stuff ever focus on romance   implying lolheroes won't end in a threesome      I choose top left.    You fujoshits never talked about anything in the first place beside imagedumping.  Maybe you should off back to  where you belong.      The romance is never the focus, but the occasional inner monologues make the feelings of the characters pretty clear. Also,  implying Ryner won't die before that happens      You don't have to pretend anymore, it's okay.    Oh man, reading the archive is fucking amusing to see this hambeast spurging out in her fujoshit containment thread.  She acts like the equivalent of female Narutard.      And you don't have to badly pretend anymore that you aren't a fujoshit.  Your filenames make it too obvious to see that you are one of the cancerous spillover from the fujoshit thread.  https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>14Wh9B6fhksh9dP-jSKPug/</wbr>            <br/>         And you don't have to badly pretend anymore that you aren't a fujoshit.  I have never denied that.  I am here to give you what you seek. There are no closets on anonymous imageboards. Be brave.       You realize that link only returns that exact post you replied to, right?    Oh, or not. The archive hadn't updated yet and I didn't bother comparing the text because I didn't care. Never mind.    I don't care about your feud with that fujo but try reading this https://archive.moe/a/thread/127004<wbr>067/#127067087 for a while. instead. Shinoafags are equally bad because all they can do is spout bullshit and then stay silent when people bring up legit points.</wbr>     Your filenames    You mean Pixiv filenames?      Moest pair.    How new can you be if you don't even recognize pixiv filename format?    Those are pixiv filenames, you retard.   Friendly reminder that replying to bait makes cute boys cry.  Let's keep cute boys happy, okay?      Makoto x anyone = OTP Nagisa x anyone = OTP Makoto x Nagisa = _________       But it's delicious when cute boys cry.    But Mika can't be even remotely happy until Kagami finally takes pity on him.      It's especially delicious when Kerry cries because he's a terrible boy.   In the interest of evening the tides a little bit   NOTP, it's maths.     that student  Who is this demonic spirit of male ejaculate?     Jun    Girl nipples are much more common, it's just the guys getting the short end of the stick most of the time unfortunately.    BestTP   Are gay harems allowed?    Homos in the bath are comfiest    actually gay too  God damn, this fuccboi is absolutely wasted on a sensei as straight as Itoshiki.     This show. Repeatedly.    Why are these so  father and son?     Why does Barnaby have to be so shit? Kotetsu is top-tier.    I wish   It's not a stretch at all to say this is pretty much canon.   Enkidu IS technically genderless but his body is male.Narita refers to Enkidu as a "he" and his genderbent cameo in Sensha Otoko was female. I don't think it's too big of a deal to consider it gay, anon. Gil swings both ways anyhow.      Gay harems are the best.    Catching up now  God damn, it is fucking breaking my heart that I don't have a Yoichi of my own to wait patiently by my bedside for me to recover.    I wanna mindbreak him.    Gintama has some seriously talented doujinka but I don't think I can handle watching 200 episodes just to understand what's going on.   oh boy gay thread, maybe they're discussing portrayals of actual cou-  173 replies   34 posters  It's the same fujoshits that drive these threads every time. Can't you guys go to /cm/ or just circlejerk in a skype group or something? This never stops being disappointing.       Makoto  You mean Sousuke, right?     Well you don't really need to anyways. You can still enjoy the doujins without watching the series, since most of it is just episodic toilet humor.   So this is what happens when you start a gay thread with a pairing from a show with a cancerous fanbase. Fascinating.    Implying it will happen    Biggest herring ever        Having such a shit internet connection that you are as retarded as this fujoshit.       My connection's fine, the archive just hadn't scraped that post yet. And for your information, I'm here for the /u/. Not that there's much of it.  And I'm not sure why you're replying to all those other guys when they were entirely correct in calling out your retardation, anyway. They were very obviously pixiv filenames. If you can't recognize that then you probably ought to go back to MAL or whatever other worthless shithole forum you crawled out of.      What's the chance of more gay in 3+1?    Not okay.     shallow satellite character  No. Makoto and Nagisa have amazing chemistry with all of their friends instead of just one.     Kaworu is dead.    Are you retarded? You responded to a Sourin pic by saying 'basically Makoto x everyone'. If you meant to respond to OP, you fucked up, otherwise you were probably just shitposting.    For now    There is no more cancerous group of people on /a/ than the cunts obsessed with "fanbases".    Sounds like denial to me    Denial of you not being a cunt    I don't have to be obsessed with the Seraph fanbase to make the observation that all the shitposters in this thread are Seraph fans asspained by the OP ship.   Stop fighting, this thread is getting gay.   Are you mentally ill?    What part of that post did you not understand?    No really, do you not recognize a fucking Pixiv filename?     shit up a thread you don't belong in   get called cancerous   call them a cunt because they hurt your feelings       The PMS is strong in this post.    At no-one has anyone called me cancerous in this thread.   Kurocock is best cock.  Can we at least have some canonical gay couples with on-screen romance, not just shipping shit?   Yeah, only a dumbass fujoshit like yourself doesn't notice that she constantly reposts her shit fanart in this thread.  https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>WnEdIOL1uxq6NllCOBbggw/  https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>hCrBCpc3kqnWjZ3IQBlbGw/</wbr>  </wbr>     Can you fuckers take it to ghost or some shit? We're trying to talk about hot cocks and you're gaying the whole thread up with your shitfit. All of you fuck off.   Yesterday I got called out for a normal pixiv filename  not knowing how to save images   What is this new meme?       You should fuck off back to tumblr.    Here, have OTP of the season.    The uniform he designed for Dog was the lewdest so probably.     I was just doing it to keep the thread bumped while the conversation died down, I'll stop now.     Love Stage a shit. What a terrible, terrible manga.    The show was good though, well other than the shit they pulled on the lewd scenes.   RIP  vampire scum     Okay, continue ignoring everything anyone says and just insisting that all the people not shitposting with you are fujoshits. That's fine too.     this idiot assumes that all instances of the same image will come up in the archive  There is an occult secret known as 'photoshop'.     Keep telling yourself that. Maybe you should try using your oxygen starved eyes more but considering the little blood flow you get from your hammy legs, that would be quite hard to do.    Au contraire my dear friend. My legs are not as salty as your tears..    and  are the cutest couple ITT.  Stop responding to cheap bait, there are some salty as hell underage anons with weak shitposting.    Picture unrelated but cute because they are best bros     They are the best but never talked about on /a/.    ..   But how is that surprising when your legbeard ends up absorbing all the sweat from your musky forest?      owari threads   filled with MUH BOOGEYMAN FUJOSHITS   Why would anyone even care or bother?       OTP      Abusing spoiler tags  <br/>     Shinoafags don't realize the cancer is coming from inside the house.    Up there with Aldnoah threads, they have been extreme cancer in the past week.    Fujoshits like yourself don't realize they are cancer in the first place      At least we know how to stay in our own threads and recognize Pixiv filenames.           https://archive.moe/a/thread/127132<wbr>179  There I fucking gave you the link. Go suck each others dicks here, because every meta shitpost anyone makes at this point is going to be reported.  </wbr>         But you don't stay in your own threads at all much less your containment board.    Not him  her , but how about you don't go in a thread with an OP titled 'ITT: gay couple', if you hate fujos and homo so much.    Why don't you take your thread and shove it back to  if you want to compete with /u/fags as best cancer.    As close to canon without being explicitly said so.      your thread  It's not my thread, faggot. I merely took part in posting twice. I just don't understand how you ended up here in the first place. I mean the OP is as explicit as it can get.     If only not Barnaby this show might be 9/10    You can keep crying about it, but it is an /a/-related thread and the mods are obviously fine with it. Your whining won't change shit.  Now post some homo or go back to your Shinoa circlejerk threads.      That doesn't really say much with a show like Free.   Arc-V is good but I miss when YGO was gay.    Implying its /a/ related    Implying the mods are fine with it   Plenty of your fujoshit threads have been deleted in the past. Don't think your tumblrshit is welcomed on /a/.         anime characters are not /a/ related  Then report it and move on.     And yet the homothreads are a long standing tradition in the board, funny that.    It's still gay. Or it was for a little while, at least.    True, the Mas/u/mi was strong. Why'd she have to disappear? She would've been great as a lancer.     tradition   Don't kid yourself. Everyone knows its the containment thread for you fujoshits and whenever you fujoshits leak out, you get called out and sent back to where you belong.  That's why you fujoshits always cry all the time in your fujoshit thread over people ripping apart your yaoishit fantasy in other threads.         I forgot Barnaby shitters could still exist in 2k15 but seems like you guys are like furniture around here.     Agreed. It's a damn shame they decided to sideline her. I'd trade Dennis for Masumi any day.    Kek All that assbleeding.  Pic related, only Bleach pairing that is worth a damn.     LN anticipation and cute Yuushas thread. Will we get more Sequel bait or an actual announcement? Also how many girls got sacrificed during the 300 Years of Vertex Invasions? Will the VN2 ever get script translated?       Will the VN2 ever get script translated?  Try not to give up!     I was about to make a thread!  When was the release date of the LN chapter again? And I am right to assume nothing VN related has been translated since the last thread?  Does anyone else feel sorry Takashima? No matter how awesome she is, she will always be overshadowed by the perfection that Yuuki Yuuna is.  Assuming they are not the same person or something like that.          26th     26th  Shit, that soon?      I'm here with you fellow yuushabrothers     And then YuYuYu Only on the 5th. And they already have announced a YuYuYu Only II to be held in September. So interest was quite high.     She looks better in the white than in the blue. Togo is fine in the blue, but this is better for Sonoko.       Have there been any leaks as to what the new girls look like?    No, yet there is aleady fanart of Takashima.    Cute    I don't think that any girls got sacrificed between Year 1 and Year 298. Shinju's barrier was doing fine on its own, and Amaterasu was just watching for him to show signs of him losing power.  The Taisha's bumbling is a pretty good clue I think that there were no Yuusha in service at all for centuries, just a written plan to mobilize some when Shinju asked. Gin, Sonoko, and Sumi's original weapons were I think the same kind of weapons they had used in 2018, and might have been effective against stardust. If their had been more Yuusha, their weapons would have been more advanced off the bat.       Is she going to have pink hair? Or are they going to play it straight and have these early Yuusha all have normal black/brown colored hair and eyes?    They are only a year apart but this makes Karin look so much older than Itsuki.   I am so conflicted about this artist. The work itself is great but I just can't like these noses      Only Yuuna notices Gin   Will Takashima be as based as Yuuna and Gin?     I just got the second radio CD. I'm going to start ripping it right now but this may take some time because my computer is bit broken.   Get Hype! Thanks based Yuushabro       Here is the fist CD of the two. https://mega.co.nz/#!I0MBwQ6C!dCOua<wbr>yfL1khP6uDFUZCydzdldFKB94w8wA_Ybrfv<wbr>3HM</wbr></wbr>     Most of the twitter pics are pretty bad but the 2-3 that are good make my weekend everytime.     Will we get more Sequel bait or an actual announcement?  Sequel bait is pretty much confirmed. In the last Nicolive, they said the new chapter will raise up some important plot points.   27, actually, but who knows when it will be scanned. We'll probably got spoilers pretty soon, though.         And here is the second CD that has radio episodes 13-22. https://mega.co.nz/#!p41CkaoT!oEbx1<wbr>uB5V12NumUx1ltQYz1-Sp5eKG5CoGJvy4Xc<wbr>Pt8</wbr></wbr>       Thanks, I love you anon    Where do I find chapter 9 and Sonogo no Sonoko epilogue mentioned in this image? I googled yuuki yuuna pastebin and didn't find those two things in the pastebins.   This is Sonoko's after: http://pastebin.com/UX1g45js  Chapter 9 should be together with the other LN chapters.      I want to fuck Yuuna.   Which Yuuna?     thanks  didn't find a chapter 9 in the pastebins unless it's the same thing as "chapter extra"       That's it.     well, that clears up the confusion  time to start by rewatching ep 1-3       sides going "IT'S GRIMDERP!"   sides going "IT'S NOT GRIMDERP!"   my sides        I am not sure how to react to this. Yuuna is cute  as always.  but Karins armor may not be appropriate.        I am feeling a strange mix between 'God damn thats adorable' and 'Please help me I am scare'    Tougou is armored semen.    It's a natural response. You'll get used to it!    All Gyuuki Gyuuna versions are cute.   There are two or three of these we need to get caught up on.        Just two more days!     Why the nibosshi so smug? I think she needs to be bullied a bit more.        Like these?             How can one girl be so bulliable?        Don't bully a Yuusha!     Really Togo? You are the one delivering the womb punch in the last panel...    But Togo you're the biggest bully of them all    Because she is so pure she will believe anything that she is told and also believes that any enemy will behave honorably and make a open challenge before attacking.    So she's literally 1V1 ME @ JUKAI FGT U WONT personified?   except she can actually 1v5 and win      Fuck off Tougou.    Bullying Karin   Not praising kakkoi Karin-chan              better girl or Best Girl?    I want a   Can you keep up with me?  with Yuuna and Takashima as soon as her character design is revealed.    What if Takashima is Gyuuki Gyuuna?  Finished WaSuYu yesterday. Fuck Gin, Sonoko is the bravest hero.   I'll fucking cut you.     Gin forced three Vertex to retreat by herself without fairies or Mankai and with significantly weaker weapons   Sonoko needed to Mankai 20 times to force 3 Vertex back, and that was after Sumi did significant damage to one with her own Mankai  Sonocuck pls go     Threadly reminder that hair-down Karin is a miracle of the universe.     Fuck Gin  If only.  you will never make Gin the mother she so longed to be  ;_;        Feels good still getting art for YuYuYu.   I kind of like their noses, agreed on the art though   That's pretty cute.   Fight me you nerd            I like Gin but maybe we need to stop calling her the greatest hero for a while until we see what kind of shit weapons and armor the girls of 2018 had to fight with.     what kind of shit weapons and armor the girls of 2018 had to fight with     Where did this "throw udon at them" thing start?   I hope they get enough money to do the battle scenes really well in S2. I kind of imagine things like in Vividred. With well drawn JSDF weapons being used alongside the Yuusha.    Something like this maybe?  http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm250<wbr>94310</wbr>      I think Gin said it.    Yeah only better. Of course we already know that all of the JSDF and USN/USAF are going to get anhillated (well the leak implied that most of the Yuusha are wiped out too) but yeah, I still would like to see it acted out.    I'm looking forward to Cute Girls Getting Slaughtered By Cute Beta, er, Vertex.   I don't think that would really fit this series. It needs to tightly focused about the girls' lives, not about a big war drama that happens to have the girls as the main characters.     Gin thoroughly savors her Udon as she eats.   —Mmm~, so goood…   The other two nod in approval.   —I bet if the Vertex tasted Udon, they would give up on trying to destroy mankind~   —I hear they actually tried the Udon strategy once.   —Eeh? Really~?   —One of the Taisha people was half-jokingly talking about it, so I don’t think it was serious. But  since normal weapons don’t work on Vertex, they had to try all kinds of stuff.  —… So that’s when they tried Udon~   —Looking at our current situation though, it must not have worked…   —Yeah, it seems they threw Udon balls at Vertex, but it didn’t even faze them. We don’t even  know if those things eat in the first place.  —U-unfazed by Udon~   —The more we learn about them, the harder it becomes to understand them. I mean, it’s  Udon!! How can you not react at all?  Sumi and the others were very serious about this matter.   That’s how important Udon was to them.                     just first track?    There is only one track on the first CD of the two CDs that the volume 2 has.    Udon, its more than food- its serious buisness    oh thanks, and the first volume was uploaded?   I'm so hype for this new SoL LN. It'll be great to get some more light-hearted, fun antics as young, cute girls hang out and play. Hopefully it'll be as calm and relaxing as the VNs despite being about new girls.   http://www.mediafire.com/download/h<wbr>6ocdacssdt1bu1/01+Track+1.wma https://mega.co.nz/#!cp1mjB7a!k4kGB<wbr>URuW6Z_WVr7rqJgfM_y5IKWN4k60PqN-RlG<wbr>xTE</wbr></wbr> </wbr>    Thank you     &gt;Does anyone else feel sorry Takashima  Hang on, who? I've been out of the loop.     A new LN series was announced a week or two ago: Nogi Wakaba wa Yuusha de aru  It details the very first group of Heroes, back in Shinju 1. There's a group of five heroes, but the three heroes named so far are Nogi Wakaba, Takashima Yuuna and Doi Tamako.      Oh wow. Shit. Is the dream alive?      There's also a new LN chapter coming out on the 26th that takes place after Sonoko After, and it's supposed to "raise important plot points."   S2 or movie is all but guaranteed at this point      Inb4 no one translates Nowayu.   Cover of the doujin that that artist is gonna put out in Yuyuyu Only.   And then I forgot the image.    Don't worry about that, translators are always here.   What is Tougou doing to Yuuna here?   Inserting her "suppositories".      FUCKING RETARDS DELETE THIS    Bringing this crap back again?      This one is oddly blurry.   So is someone going to insert the other translated scripts to the 2nd VN? Apparently the anon who was doing it is gone.     Apparently the anon who was doing it is gone.     I wish I knew how to do that kind of shit, I have roughly two weeks of absolutely free time after tomorrow.  tfw English major     Yuu are my hero and I love yuu Yuuki Yuuna!    I love Yuuki Yuuna! I want to marry Yuuki Yuuna! I want Yuuki Yuuna to beat me up!       Tougou pls     Yunna is the cutest in Sanshuu!      Yuuki Yuuna  More like  Yucky Tuna      But all yuushas are best girl.   Togo a shit.   I don't understand this meme.   It has come to my attention that there are people in this thread posting girls other than Yuuna. In case you're not aware, this is a Yuuki Yuuna thread, as specified in the OP. Please take your Karin or Tougou images over to the local Miyoshi Karin wa Yuusha de Aru thread.    Someone needs to be give a godhand to shut their trap     Bullies should not be allowed to be heroes.   Does Togo have a closet of these questionable outfits she makes Yuuna wear?     I still don't remember what episode this is from.    The niboshii shuriken gets me every time    episode six   I want to tougou Tougou's tougous.    some anon have created this folder with the instructions to build the script if you want to try   https://www.mediafire.com/folder/67<wbr>05q59djxz5n/YuYuYuS  I Think these are the scripts that are missing to be inserted  http://pastebin.com/KGYa8RaR  http://pastebin.com/3Jn10QDg  http://pastebin.com/cGYp9HEy        </wbr>      ded   just like Gin   Tougou did nothing wrong.   Remember when we were afraid of the Death cards Itsuki pulled out? Remember when we thought Fuu was going to die at around ep5? Those were the days. I'm happy I went through this from the beginning with /yyy/       Remember when we assumed nips had no idea what the tarot represented?    To be fair there was a fair amount of people here thinking Death stands for literal death as well.     not the ep11 livewatch and following week   oh Karina finally Mank-   wait what   the hell are you doing stupid bit-   nonono enough   dear lord stop this fucking madnes-   tumblingdown.gif   WE ALL SAW YOUR AWESOME FIGHT KARIN-CHAN   next week speculation: EoE-tier bullshit and grimdark assupull  Fun times.             I was pulling an all-nighter for an assignment that night. I couldn't do anything for a solid hour after that.     I couldn't do anything for a solid week after that.    I'd never felt that combination of ridiculous hype and absolute despair at the same time   Hey Gaijin, My name is Tougou and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded waito piggus who spend every second of their day looking at dumb-ass pictures. You are everything bad in Shikoku. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any pussy? I mean, I guess it’s fun making fun of people because of your own gaijinness, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on 2ch. Don’t be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I’m pretty much perfect. I was captain of the wheelchair racing team, and starter on my shooting team. What sports do you play, other than “jack off to naked drawn Japanese people”? I also get straight A’s, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just ate me out; Shit was SO cash). You are all gaijin who should just commit sudoku. Thanks for listening. Pic Related: It’s me and my yuusha     Why is she so perfect?   Yuuna likes touching seashells doesn't she?     Why is every single one of Yuunas swimsuits so freaking cute?  Calling Yuuna prefect is an understatement. She is the best character ever!       She's gotta dress up for her Tougou-san.    Also looks good in cosplay.    Infact looks awesome in everything!    And in her Hero Suit undies.     Do you think Fuu, Togo, or Sonoko were the creators of these cosplay outfits? Also, more cosplay      Itsuki!  It's always the quite ones!      Precure Thread     Nope, they are 2 different artist. That one is this guy: https://twitter.com/w7kogane?lang=e<wbr>n  This one  is this guy: https://twitter.com/poni_taoyaka?la<wbr>ng=en</wbr>   </wbr>    I love Love even though sometimes she's a big dumb.     I love love love this theme! Too bad indeed. Artists need to go watch FW/MH again and remember just how great great great she is.    I'm checkin those out all right. Very nice.   Today is yuyusday.    Are Yuyus really dykes?    Am I seeing things or is there actually half a second of Yuzu buttcrack there?     Nope, that is indeed a yuzu crack.    I want to believe that's a buttcrack       Did she cry on him like Rebecca did?  Yep     An entire chapter where the only thing that happens is Luffy is confirmed the winner   Come the fuck on Oda. As if your pacing isn't slow enough already. Next chapter will be the party chapter, then the chapter after that is the saying goodbye chapter, then the one after that will be the talking about where they're going next chapter.  Fuck sakes.       No, he's smiling. Which means he complately understands what's going on around him.    No, the pages have already been posted, though still not sure it has real significance, it just seems weird at the moment. It's a huge cliche in movies and tv, but the way Oda has portrayed it just seems goofy.    Who is the "REBECCAFAG"? Why should we ignore him? I'm new to this thread, please explain me what you mean.   So what? This is emblematic. Why do you even say I'm idiot? You don't agree, so I'm idiot? Don't you think the reverse could be true? I'll say the same thing as you : you idiot. How does it feel to be talked to in a disrespectful way?   He can use a tripcode if he wants to, it's allowed by the rules.   Show me the picture unless you can't and I'll leave it at that because I'm alright with you being wrong, I don't want to harass you just because you can't show a picture.              Will you remember the Etotamas when they're gone?  Is desudesu shirt the only one sold out?  Original designs look pretty different.    Bottom right  ARE THOSE???     They are.     I'm glad they changed Shima tan to make her paw things into nunchucks   dat bottom right       夜空に浮かぶ星達は一人ぼっちの寂しさと巡り合う喜びを繰り返して長い時の<wbr>中をすれ違っていきます 今日の予報は流星雨。星空を見上げていると、今はまだ出会えていないどこか<wbr>のだれかの事をふと思ってしまいます その誰かも同じようにこの星空を見上げていて星達は空からそんな私達の姿を<wbr>見守っていてくれるはずです  "The stars flying in the broad night skies are crossing paths within the long passage of time after feeling lonely and joy again and again. Today's prediction is meteor shower. If you look up to the skies, you will remember of someone from somewhere you haven't yet meet. That person shall also look up into the starry skies, and the stars will watch over us from the cosmos."  Gainax, you sucked most of the time. But this show is a great parting present. See you again someday.      </wbr> </wbr> </wbr>   Fuck that scene got me. I'm actually kind of glad they went that route, anything else wouldn't feel right.      But they changed by meeting each other. How i forgetting it gonna change them    How many babies will Minato and Subaru have?  Hopefully the first step towards Gainax ascendancy again.  The second step being the release of Uru In Blue.   Do I need to watch the OVAs now? I only started watching last week.  Next episode airing in nipland reasonably soon. What do yall expect from the next episode?   It's runes.    what the hell do those mexican hieroglyphics say    That's actually really cute. え～．．．．．．。ママもヒッキーくんとお話ししたい～ absurdly cute.      Given that she is still hiding behind "senpai do you think Hayama will like this" she probably won't find the courage until it's too late    Not for me. My book arrives today, and right now I don't have anything else to do. Anyone needs translations? </blockquote>]
