A CUTE</br>    This is really short but worth the 2 pages.    <br>How the fuck can Papi fly but Lilth and Draconsa can't?</br>  <br>Cerea, Rachnera, Mero, and Smith's voices for one of these videos would be best.</br>  I wonder how Lala eats.  <br>Read the manga this is explained holy shit you people</br>  <br>her mouth</br>  <br>Probably with her head attached to her body.</br>  <br>she pours stuff down her neckhole, she shows it off.</br>  <br>Yes, I've read the manga, but the fact Papi looks like she weighs more then Lilth is bullshit.</br>  <br>I don't think I've ever seen Lala smile. The closest I've ever seen her head happy is when she tried to sit on the special chair.</br>  <br>Papi's wingspan is at least twice her height and she weights practically nothing.</br>  <br> Lala lifting her head up to see <br>How did I never notice that before.</br></br>  <br>Yet she has enough strength to fucking lift a teenage guy?</br>  <br>Lilith has tiny little shit wings. More for appearance than functionality.</br>  What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen Papi?  <br>Because you got a thick fucking skull, why dont you look at the page where is shows jut how fucking wide Papi's wing span is.<br><br>Do you understand the basics of flight or do airplanes fly by magic to you</br></br></br>  <br>Manga is not serious business. Darling should be dead and these girls should never have evolved now put a sock in it and suspend reality until the ride ends</br>  <br>Her wings are fucking huge, they can easily create enough lift to get off the ground while carrying a person.</br>  <br>Metal does suck though.</br>  <br>Japanese or American?</br>  <br>I'll slap your cock with a tire iron don't you fucking back talk me.</br>  <br> no Smith glasses </br>  <br>She's damn cute<br> please don't bully the dullahan </br></br>  <br>Back talk? Son, Im saying that right to your fucking face.</br>  <br>"Metal" is a vast genre, with many sub-genres. While I don't like most of them, a few are quite nice. Progressive Metal, for one. Pure guitar godliness, with none of that throat-growling scream-o shit.</br>  <br>Sorry, but those are from the internet. I'll try to find one in higher resolution</br>  <br>Well, wingspan sure as hell isn't the only deciding factor</br>  <br>Oh, so Cerea hasn't replaced the fucking shit she broke.</br>  <br>Kek<br>You are anonymous, thus you are no one. He can do as he pleases and your bitch ass will take it, you have no reputation to speak like that and responding just makes you look like a tit and gives him satisfaction</br></br>  <br><br> lala without ahoge <br><br>not acceptable</br></br></br></br>    <br>Dat leg</br>    <br>It's before Rachne sits on Suu</br>  <br>IT DOES WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THRUST.<br><br>LIFT<br>THRUST<br>DRAG <br>WEIGHT<br><br>Do NONE OF YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS FLY?!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But I wanna!!</br>  <br>Is there a Cerea special?</br>  Good night Lala      <br> Zombina on 4th episode </br>  <br>You could just say 'no'...</br>  <br><br>this is almost on TLRD tier</br></br>  <br>Also, for breaking the 4th wall</br>  <br>I do, and I agree that there's no way Papi can fly around carrying Kurusu. The drag created by him simply hanging there makes it impossible for the combined weight to remain in flight.<br><br>I also don't care about it, since it's cute and amusing. You should learn to not let things like this spoil something that is, by every other metric, silly and impossible to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not nearly as frustrating as trying to get one to join you in Dragon Quest 5.</br></br>  Why is Lala so cute`?  <br>Considering something like an eagle can carry off a sheep, its really not that big of a stretch.</br>  <br>Lillith and Draco have weak-ass babby wings that aren't even their primary forelimbs. That shit ain't gonna fly.</br>  Why is Cerea so unrapeable? It makes an almost perfect character bad.  <br>Didn't mean to quote. But no I don't think there is I think the only specials like that are the papi one. polt and mon</br>  <br>You mean!</br>  <br>They really tried their hardest to get us to like the fucking insect didn't they?</br>  <br>.....how could you not?</br>    <br>For the same reason the human girl hates her.</br>   adaptation starts airing <br> threads become shitpost central  <br>Jesus Christ</br></br>    <br>And your surprised by this?</br>  <br> thinking they were any better before <br>You poor, naïve young soul.</br></br>   You will never tenderly murder Miia   <br>Woah hey there!

Finished the prologue in case anybody's interested.<br><br>Basically the story is going to be a slice of life monster girl story with maybe some harem elements later in the story.

I think she's raped about 60% of the cast</br>  <br>Aww<br>Yiss<br><br>Thanks anon!</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that MC has a small dick.  <br>Darling, Smith, and MON<br>And whatever many side characters</br></br>  <br>Tio, Zombina, Smith, Manako, Dopple, Draconsa, Lilth, Yuki-Onna, Polt, Minotaur, Sheep, Kitsune.</br>  <br> Liking Polt <br> "FURRY GET AWAY <br><br> Liking Papy <br> "Good taste anon" <br><br>Go back to wherever you came from, you are trying too hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SHRINKAGE.</br>  So much is going on in this picture I don't know where it starts.  <br>why would I care?<br>im not fapping to him</br></br>  <br>That semen demon mom thought it was a good size.</br>  <br>Hey, Papi is the least furry.<br>Try again when Cereafags attack Polt.</br></br>  <br>Thats only just because he got out of the bath into the cold air, dudes probably hung like Cerea</br>  <br>Smith, MON, the bodyguard girls(C.34), Kurusu(vore no count), Luz, farm girls.<br><br>If going by those she's formally met, Kurusu, Smith, MON, bodyguard girls.</br></br></br>  <br>It's still half a bird.<br>Calling out someone has furry for liking Polt when you like whatever girl who is not Smith is plain retarded</br></br>  Reminder that liking Polt makes you a furry  <br>I WAS IN THE POOL</br>  Why is Darling so moe?  <br>Both forget the lizard and ogre bodyguards</br>  <br>No, she got one of the body guard girls.</br>  <br>polt is considered furry because of her snout though <br>if papi had a beak you'd have a point but she doesn't.</br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget that Papi has human skin for majority of her body, Polt has furs covering her entirety.</br></br>  <br>With that logic you might as well call everyone a furry<br>Idiot</br></br>  What's Zombina's origin story? Military experiment gone wrong, unlucky cop?  <br>No, it would still make Suu and Lala not furries, which is why they are best girls.</br>  <br> polt is considered furry because of her snout <br>Well fuck me for liking her /fit/ mentality then, guess I'll go fuck some deviant in a fursuit<br><br><br>Good job, you got the point</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Don't forget that Papi apparently has brain damage and is on the mental level of a 5 year old.</br></br></br>  <br>The thing is that furry is an humanoid animal, MG are the other way around, girls with monster parts. Papi beeing a half bird is completely fine. Polt in the other hand, the only thing that completelly separates her from 100% furry is the snout. And note that she actually has one, a tiny one that resembles a nose.</br>  Polt is shit<br>S H I T<br>H<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br> the mental level of a 5 year old. </br>  <br>Even better.</br>  <br>she has a fantastic ass though</br>  <br>You realize that her ass has fur too right? Her complete body does, even chest.</br>  <br>she also has like 6 nips</br>  Y'all niggas ain't worthy of best girl  <br>No she just needed to know he gets hard when fondling boob.<br><br>So, about two inches?</br></br></br>    Polt has her whole body full off fur....<br>how is she not a furry</br>  <br> , dudes probably hung like Cerea <br>but cerea is a girl...</br></br>  <br>She's also a Kobold, therefore she's still a monster girl, I don't think Kobold count as animals, well, I'm not a furry, I like Polt because of her personnality and   ass   , and it's probably the same for most Poltfag, when you like Rachne, you like her femdom traits or whatever, not because you want to fuck her spider butt, I hope.</br>  <br>nope<br>I'd like to fuck her spiderbutt</br></br>  <br>Oh well, fuck the spiderbutt then.</br>  <br>Will someone commission a picture of Polt shaving allready?</br>  <br>And how is that relevant?<br>Also, she doesn't have brain damage, she has a healthy brain for a harpy. And being like childish and innocent is a huge plus, and a huge turn on, faggot.</br></br>  <br>You only need to keep her from walking by herself and that's a problem solved</br>  <br>if I could I would</br>  <br>Dude NICE</br>  OY!<br>OY!<br>OY!</br></br>  <br>I want that, I need that.</br>  <br>Why that faggot never treats Papi as a girl while he is flustered with everyone?</br>  <br>Yeah, maybe for you, paedophile.</br>  how smart would papi bee if they confined her to a wheelchair for a week?  <br>she is 18</br>  <br>Why would that-<br>What</br></br>  <br>Papi isn't a girl, she's a child.</br>  Tiny snek  <br>see panel 3<br/></br>  <br> posting on /a/ <br> not a pedo </br></br>  <br>That is if rolling around doesn't count as steps.<br><br><br>She is not though</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you wanted to insult me, you really shouldn't have complimented me, anon.</br>  <br>Children are sexiest.</br>  <br>Gropes her tits.

Unfortunately, the way they start, I don't get much leeway for their mouths. I'll try to add more "energy" when I start MON.<br><br><br>She'll be first then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She has a snout.<br>That's where the line is. Apparently.</br></br>  <br> interesting ideas of self worth <br>Having superior taste is something to be proud of, cretin.</br></br>  <br>She is pretty much anthro. Its just that I don't care.</br>  <br>Well to be fair she is the most furry-like of the monster girls so far besides that Shrine Maiden.<br><br>It's just some guys shitposting so stop caring about what they say.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br>Your superior taste might land you in prison</br>  <br><br>The design for that dog-girl is so cool.</br></br>  <br> I was more so thinking a long the lines of same face in general  Can you link to your other uploads so I can compare? I hope you don't mind me critiquing.</br>  <br>geeee, i don't know<br>maybe because she has fur covered over her whole body and has a snout?</br></br>  <br>It isn't. To be A Furry, you need to do shit like wear fursuits, go to furry conventions, wear a tail as part of your casual outfit, have a fursona, etc.<br><br>The dick likes what it likes; wanting to fuck Polt makes you a xenophile at most.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What are the questions and options?</br></br>  <br>It's not. We got a flood of anime only shitters (actual shitters, not the people that actually are enjoying the anime) that have just been trolling everything.</br>  <br>All hail thought police?<br>Or did you think you will scare anyone by acting like a textbook moralfag?</br></br>  It has finally happened /a/<br><br>I have been Triggered<br><br>Warning for you own safety don't open.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does it even matter if no one become obnoxious about it?

How can they stop tumblr? <br>Posting lewd things like  hand-holding , clears a thread of shitposters like nobody's business.</br></br>  <br>Have you even been paying attention? Loli threads aren't what they used to be anymore.</br>  Aside from popularity and the actual company itself, what is actually wrong with Fakku products? <br><br>The releases are alright, and they use the original uncensored digital files or some shit like that. That shit is up for grabs on nyaa anyway. <br><br>What is the difference between just doing that and going with Horriblesubs even though you hate CR?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that's different. This is a news article and the discussion of the outrage. Not the owner of Fakku coming here and telling us to buy his shitty porno.</br>   this whole thread <br>I'm triggered</br>  Ok, let's sum up this thread.<br><br>1.- The woman writing that article is fucking retarded for giving a "public" tribune to something like that. It isn't "that" important, really.<br>2.- Jacob is a fucking jew, and if you don't want to buy his shit it's ok.<br>3.- Yeah, we are fine discussing this because we're here for that. Anime and Manga, remember?<br>4.- Gabriella Ekens is a tumblr scum and has been posting on /a/ for over 2 years. She's a feminist and a SJW.<br><br>Anything else?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Couldn't see the word manga or anime in your reply, that shows how related the article is.<br>Going further i'm derailing this thread easily showing that you don't have anything to discuss.</br></br>  <br>The legit main concern was that loli manga might bring unwanted attention. If Jacob does indeed have enough legal backing to deal with that shit, then practically speaking, nothing wrong really.</br>  <br>Fakku staff pls get out</br>  <br>eeeeeehhhhh poorer translation that fantranslations a lot of the time, the usual problem with quick-buck commercialization.</br>  <br> Going further i'm derailing this thread easily showing that you don't have anything to discuss <br>It also shows you've a fucking hypocrite and is just as responsible for this thread. It gets dragged on because you keep engaging him. You are just as bad as him.</br></br>  <br>I don't think staff ever recommend piracy.</br>  <br>Like many of us here, I'm pretty butt-hurt over sadpanda. Let's face it; piracy (even of Wani, Fakku works) will continue as before. However, Fakku's rise does give us a choice:<br><br>A) Our community is kept hidden from mainstream eyes as we enjoy our underground playground.<br>OR<br>B) Try to influence the broader culture, but compromise our darker/fringe interests/fetishes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> make your business through piracy <br> thrive on the content of others <br> suddenly pretend to be legitimate business <br> DMCA your competitiors <br> Remove content <br><br>Nope, nothing amoral here. <br><br>Surely the massive amounts of content from Wani artists that is now gone will appear on Fakku right? Oh wait. They just have like 8 fucking books in their shop. They never published or will publish the monthly books they file claims for. They've taken everything down, they've helped DMCA other guys that hosted more content, and they plan to charge you money for it. Fakku is a figurative cancer in the western anime community. And I know that they browse here, and I know that they shill here.<br><br>So fuck off. And to any retards that think fakku will allow loli to any serious degree:<br><br>I have a bridge to sell to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I hope things don't get to the mainstream media. I enjoy it being under the sheats where nobody judges anything. You don't like something you see, you skip it and end of the matter.</br></br>  <br>I forgot to mention, the best part about all of this is that they STILL host pirated content. But of course, in the interests of making money and having a broad appeal, the catalog is immensely limited and bland.</br>  <br> but compromise our darker/fringe interests/fetishes <br><br>What's the point then?</br></br></br>  <br>Of course they are anti-piracy now, and want to revise history that way. I think that's what ticks people off about this whole affair. Of course, evolving your views on publishing, art, etc. is fine, but Fakku already had this baggage from our community.</br>   making /v/ tier threads <br><br>fuck off</br></br>  <br>You do know Wani's the one that's been sending out the mass takedowns from the start, right? And that they started doing so before anyone was even talking about any kind of publishing deal.<br><br>FAKKU only sends out takedowns for the stuff it actually publishes.<br><br> and they plan to charge you money for it. <br><br>Yeah, FAKKU is charging you money for legitimate access to content that has always been commercial in nature legitimately. How horrible.<br><br> And to any retards that think fakku will allow loli to any serious degree <br><br>FAKKU has already legitimately published a book with a loli/shota gangbang in it, you know. X-EROS also has its share of loli content, and FAKKU will be publishing it.<br><br><br>And all of that pirated content will be gone before the end of the year.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh no, there's lesser porn to fap to! What a tragedy!</br>  <br>It kinda of is a tragedy.</br>  <br>Well, I imagine wider acceptance of doujinshi, eromanga/ero-comics in the West. Better acceptance of this type of fair use of copyrighted media. Hey, maybe we'll see more popularity and get more artists interested.</br>  <br>Oh look, baited the shill.<br><br>How are you, Daiz?</br></br></br>  <br> mfw fakku will never touch the other secret club because only 1% of /a/ knows it exists <br>Feels good man</br></br>  <br>Not really. More porn comics are still being made in Japan on a daily basis. So what if Fakku isn't releasing everything they have access to at the moment? Just fap to some other shit.</br>  <br> Well, I imagine wider acceptance of doujinshi, eromanga/ero-comics in the West. <br>You imagine wrong friend, what do you think will happen when the 99% of people in the West learn that people are getting their jollies from nip lolis?<br><br>I can tell you it wont be met with open arms.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There actually isn't less though. At all.<br>It's funny because raw releases are actually MORE stable and reliable than they were before the takedowns.</br></br>  <br>It's too bad that some of this stuff is straight up illegal in some of these countries. How does Fakku going to deal with that? You go ahead and buy a loli mag in Canada and then get arrested. Is Fakku going to have to deal with Canadian authorities?<br><br>And no one is going to suddenly be interested in making porn if they weren't already.</br></br></br>  <br>man, you're a tease</br>  <br> Looks like tumblrfags next step in their "evolution" is coming to 4chan. We had no salvation since the beginning. <br>remember that one guy who told his 7th grade class that /a/ is the place to be to discuss anime</br></br>  <br>Mass executions, considering the way things are going in the West.</br>  <br>That's the point. I was mocking the other guy for kicking up a fit over Jacob's fakku thingy. This shit really isn't a big deal. If it works out, great, more free uncensored porn. If it doesn't, Jacob loses his job and we're back to before.</br>  <br>theres a reason why some sites get taken down while others stay the same<br>we're just lucky that the owner of the site is a huge autistic hedgefund babby</br></br>  <br>And how many of them are getting upload and placed in an area that's easily accessible?</br>  <br> mfw Daiz will be one of the first to go. </br>  <br>They are already easily accessible.<br><br>Assuming you aren't retarded enough to think that sad panda is the only site to depend on.</br></br></br>  <br> reading comprehension <br><br>I was referring to the products ASIDE from the company. I already know the shit they pull.</br></br></br>  Why is he so smug?  <br>see</br>  <br>isnt that the same guy who got his dog killed and gutted just this year? Did anything ever come out of that investigation?</br>  <br> Why is he so smug? <br>Only the nose knows.</br></br>    <br>Just as you said, time to download them before it's too late.</br>  <br>I want to kill this fucking cunt.</br>  <br>If those really matter that much to you, you might be addicted to porn or masturbation. Or both.<br><br>Seek help.</br></br></br>  <br> You do know Wani's the one that's been sending out the mass takedowns from the start, right? And that they started doing so before anyone was even talking about any kind of publishing deal. <br> FAKKU only sends out takedowns for the stuff it actually publishes. <br>Yes I'm sure FAKKU stays completely passive in a massive breach of conflict of interest. No Mr. Nip man, I will pretend I don't see this money while I help you lead to websites that host your content that I also unironically steal :^)<br><br> Yeah, FAKKU is charging you money for legitimate access to content that has always been commercial in nature legitimately. How horrible. <br>I'm sure you had the same mindset in 2012 when you were posting ripped scans from other groups without giving a single shit. <br><br> X-EROS also has its share of loli content, and FAKKU will be publishing it. <br>Where are all the past x-eros issues? Kairakuten? Good job holding onto that monopoly while publishing literally nothing. The bookstore that you're trying to shill literally has 9 fucking books. None of them contain loli. All of the covers have big tittied whores. Where is the loli Daiz?<br><br> And all of that pirated content will be gone before the end of the year. <br>Why wasn't it removed the day of the Wani deal? The announcement was last fucking year.<br>Oh right, because you faggots know fully well you profit from piracy. Your community is built on it. Your customer base is built on it. <br><br>You're rolling in filth while trying to act holier than thou. I see through your bullshit. I see how you let popular scanlators host on fakku. Don't think you'll get away with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember that one guy who supposedly printed and distributed flyers at a con describing /a/ as some sort of ultimate weeaboo nirvana?</br>  <br> They are already easily accessible. <br>Today. Today they're easily accessible.<br><br><br>Because he's getting paid to do nothing.<br><br><br>Or maybe I don't want to read the same thing every night?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So what if Fakku isn't releasing everything they have access to at the moment? <br><br>The issue is that while fakku isn't releasing stuff they have access to, they also aid in taking it down from other sites. It's effectively trying to be a monopoly.</br></br></br>  <br> Don't think you'll get away with it. <br>They already did. Since the only people who supposedly cared are just a bunch of autists on /a/ who only knows how to bitch. People like you, who are all talks, for example.</br></br>  <br><br>Wow some guy selling hentai manga is going to shut down piracy! He's going to get help in accomplishing what Hollywood wasn't able to do with an army of lawyers!<br><br>I'm so fucking scared that Jacob is going to take my porn away!</br></br></br></br>  <br>daiz is the reason for everything that is wrong</br>  <br>Anon, there is no point in arguing with jews.</br>  <br> People like you, who are all talks, for example </br>  <br> Implying Hollywood didn't hurt the average consumer. <br> Implying Hollywood sells material that could get you arrested and sentenced on child porn charges. <br><br>HURRRRRRRRRRR</br></br></br></br>  <br>The demand for hentai isn't on the scale of the demand for the latest Hollywood blockbuster, the market is smaller and there are far fewer players in the piracy end of things.<br><br>He probably won't do much harm but any slimy fuck who tries to fuck over people doing the same thing as him deserves to be heckled on a board for laotian lewd literature.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, it's true. Remember the shitstorm on /a/ when jacob announced the deal? What happened in the end? Fucking nothing. He continued to sell his shit and even got fucking daiz working for him now.</br>  <br> get you arrested and sentenced on child porn charges <br>Oh look, another one starting up sensationalist claims over shit he has minimal understanding about.<br><br>I'm never paying for porn, but I applaud Jacob purely on being able to get idiots like you so angry that it's amusing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ITT: Poor people that think pirating is good.</br>  <br>If you live MA you're bound to be smug.</br>  <br> I'm not gonna address what you said, but I am going to pretend that I know more than you. </br>  <br>It's pretty good.</br>  <br> attempting to downplay position to take away from legitimacy of claim <br>Yes yes lets all just sit back while jacob helps dmca everything.</br></br>  http://pastebin.com/8HUEy9qE  <br>What's there to address? You think that Jacob is somehow going to stop you from getting your porn. I find that notion hilarious and will continue to mock it.</br>  <br> He's responsible for using "that" <br>Wow, I mean I never really look into e-celeb drama but he really went that far? What a stupid cunt.</br></br>  <br>Except I didn't say that in that post. I said that Jacob is going to make people pay for porn that will get them arrested on child porn charges.</br>   no comic lo  <br> shit selection of femdom  <br> no quixlax <br> no Ootomo Takuji  <br> all digital, no rights to actually distribute hard copies of translated works  <br>and it's still work 10 bucks a month? shit where do i sign up?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> comic lo <br> good <br>lolno is the naruto/snk of loli</br></br></br>  <br> will get them arrested on child porn charges <br>And that's why I said what I said about you knowing jack shit. Hint: it has been debated to death in previous threads about this shit. You, like many other anons will just keep spewing the same shit anyway.</br></br>  <br> "Through Dick, Unity" </br>   go on Fakku for the first time in a while <br> browse tags <br> no loli <br> no rape <br> not even forced <br><br>SONOFAFUCKINGBITCH</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the point im making is the current selection of material on fakku isnt worth 10 dollars a month</br>  <br> Jacob is going to make people pay for porn that will get them arrested on child porn charges. <br>Right, because nobody imports loli manga before he came along.</br></br>  <br>You're doing it again. You're pretending to know more than me, but not actually addressing my concern. You're deflecting super hard. I hope Fakku enjoys the CSIS knocking on their doors.<br><br><br>And people have gotten arrested for it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> you can buy loli games with dlsite <br> But the policeeE!!!1 </br></br>  Need to gather some more memory.<br>NEED 1000TB of harddrives<br><br>SAVE THE PORN!!!</br></br></br>  <br> He's still doing it. </br>  Holy god fakkufags are disgusting with their /v/ type level of speaking. You guys get fucked and get your money stealed for shit doujins you can read anytime on panda, and the most beautiful thing is, you know this and still suck Jacobs hitlercock. People like you are the reason why the internet turned into normalfag shit.  <br>I volunteer for everything by Toumasu, Uno Makoto, Shiwasu no Okina, Yamatogawa, Z-Ton, Kouin-N, Perestroika....</br>  <br> addressing my concern <br>Which isn't my concern. I know enough to know that I can have my porn without worrying like the bitch you are. I don't need to pretend to know more. I do know more because I am not the one all going 'gonna get arrested'.<br><br>As I said, keep spewing that shit. It's funny.</br></br></br></br>  <br> take my sadpanda away <br>there are other outlets anon</br></br>  <br> I'm an idiot and I don't know anything. <br><br>Good to know that you finally admitted it.</br></br></br>  <br> there are other outlets <br>All of the other outlets pull their content directly from panda.</br></br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind this stuff at all if there was loli sold by them.<br><br>Yeah, I heard that there was some loli in a recently sold Bosshi book by them, but where's Gomennasai for instance? I'm just not allowed to read anything he's published under Wani now?<br><br>Not that I have trouble getting Wani loli H, but it's the principal of the thing. I don't think it's really a bad idea to be able to buy translated porn easily, since I like some of these H artists a lot, but the fact is some H is apparently too unsavory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>as matter of fact I have found content that I have not seen in panda. <br><br>also <br> The king is dead, long live the king!  <br>if SP ever goes down, someone, somewhere will take over its work</br></br></br></br></br>   Fakku CEO Jacob Grady, says the site is in the process of removing all unlicensed in preparation of its premium launch at the end of 2015. <br><br>Fakku is dead.<br><br>No wonder almost all the old post are gone.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hi10P?

It just feels nice sharing porn with people. Much like trudging through the bowels of Comiket just so I could scan some glorious shit for /a/nons. Intense catharsis, I tell you. <br> That being said, you're not allowed to advertise other websites here. Go fuck off with your clickbait somewhere else. </br></br>  <br>so its a win/win then?<br>what's the problem<br> hur can't fap for free <br>yes you can<br>you have other doujins.<br><br><br> hur jew <br>poor people who don't know how the world work.<br>Same about faggots who think piracy is ok.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know, apparently gives Hentai artists money by running Fakku and destroying Sadpanda, so it's difficult to say.</br></br>  <br>   clickbait <br>W-what</br></br>  Normalfags ruining everything again.  <br>Fakku only recently starting hosting loli.<br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  This is the same shit that happened with Crunchyroll.  <br> shitty foreign middleman distributor <br> giving the original source money <br>Hah.</br></br></br>  Why is Daiz so bald?  <br>And then they're gonna take it away the moment the governments start knocking.</br>  <br>its a meme</br>  <br><br>what a weird creepy looking nerd, he looks precisely as you expect someone who owns an anime porn pay site to look, I mean exactly.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Same about faggots who think piracy is ok. <br>Piracy basically does nothing to anything.

I'd like to see Yumi zip around everywhere like a fucking flea.</br>  <br>yes, actually.</br>  <br>Several.</br>  Where did their nipples go?  <br>In the OVA, yes</br>  <br>She doesnt need to zip around.

Made for bullying and marriage.</br>  <br>Because she's a dirty attention-whore. Also what are those cards from and is it from the same thing as those Idom@ster cards? Is it a worthwile card game?</br>  <br><br>I don't understand how anyone can dislike any of the Crimson Squad. <br><br>They are all top tier, though my personal favorite is Hikage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno.

However, I have my share of moments when shit hit the fan so hard I couldn't help but feel sorry:<br> - Yuki breakdown<br>- Megu-nee flashback<br>- Kurumi facing Megu-nee<br>- Kurumi bitten<br>- Helicopter crash</br></br></br></br> <br>I might forget some but the whole premise delievered so hard I cannot actually find a weakness.</br></br></br>  Also, while I still think Rii is hottest, Kurumi is my favorite so far.  <br>Shovel screaming WHY THE HELL on the basement.</br>  <br>I feel more pity than sadness for pretty much all of those big scenes. The girls are just so broken. I feel bad for them, and not really sad for them. <br>If that makes sense.</br></br>  <br>I don't know Anon, Lerche has been pretty good this season. MonMus is looking great, Laplace is still giving reasons to keep watching, and aside from some quality GG has been pretty good so far as well.</br>  <br>This. But Kurumi's inevitable turning and/or death will probably top it.</br>  Reminder that Yuki is not a kid. Please no bully.  <br>Nice blog but please take that shit and fuck off back to reddit.</br>    <br>They got bathtubs though.</br>  <br>When they read Mii-kun's diary was when I felt the saddest.</br>  <br>BEST<br>EST<br>ST<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>The toilets work just fine, the school has its own water collection system.

Nor was Megu-nee.</br>  "School-Live!" is such a shit English name. The author literally just ran the title through a machine translator and slapped it on the cover. It sounds more like an idol anime like Love Live due to the homonym.  <br>That's kinda dumb, but thank you.</br>  <br>That sure turned out fine for them.</br>  <br>While bikers may be the bad guys, crossbow-kun was simply being reasonable, and when he asked them to drop everything Rii didn't drop  the bear  causing him to shoot.<br><br>I feel the main problem these girls are going to have now, is that since they've left their self sufficient collective at the school, they need to deal with the fact people aren't going to put up with their PTSD imaginary bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>Someone suggested "Living at School" or "Living at the School" as a better name earlier. Double meaning and all that.</br>  <br>I think some rural japanese dialect would fit Kurumi</br>  <br>We don't know what happened to Kei though.</br>  <br> What site is it? This looks like the result of the Manga Traders archival project and I lost track of it a while ago </br>  <br>It's intentional, to fool more unsuspecting victims.</br>  <br>Do we even know if it's even supposed to be pronounced like Love Live? Or "live" and in "liver"? The latter would be even worse.</br>  <br>He probably just thought Rii's riis were weapons. Those things are ballistic.</br>  <br>I think biker dudes are probably bad while uni girls I'm pretty suspicious .<br><br>Crossbow dude will join the group most definitely</br></br></br>  <br>Miki, pls, Kei is deader than death.</br>  <br>The panties represent their hopes.</br>  <br>Worse.

The zombies in this series are pushovers and may as well not even be a threat. The run from a fucking fire extinguisher.

For all he knew, the teddy bear could be hiding a gun.</br>  <br>He said drop everything and she didn't drop everything. It's perfectly reasonable that crossbow would be anxious and trigger happy given the situation of the town.</br>   episode 1 on Niconico got over 1 million views <br> episode 2 also has higher viewership than any other streamed show <br>O Japan.</br></br>  <br>The first episode is masterful in its execution. It's pretty decent overall, too.</br>  <br><br>want crossbow guy to join the party so I can finally self insert properly.</br></br>  <br> Being in the same group as a girl with gigantic boobs who's full delusion, a cute genki girl with a silly cat hat, a beautiful fit girl with sexy arm...things, and a cute tomboy with lewd garterbelts. <br>Muh dick.<br><br>I'd never realized how little I'd last in a group like that without raping everyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't you see all the cute girls? It doesn't get any more moeshit than this.</br>  <br>Just read the manga.</br>  <br>Not really. Even if he did shoot one of them, then what?

Or maybe even intentionally set it off for some reason?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was nervous and she wasn't listening, it's reasonable that he given his situation would fire at a stranger if they weren't listening, seeing as he may or may not have other hostile survivors around</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>What makes you think that this nervous beta was even thinking that rationally?

She's been imagining that she has legs this entire time.</br>  <br>Why is that hat so fucking cute?<br><br>Just why?<br>No silly hat should be allowed to be THAT cute.</br></br></br></br>   watching this show <br><br>Even during the slice of life moments it's sad as fuck.</br></br>  <br>I guess it's not the worst self insert, she matches the best with an outside viewpoint given the whole "wow this imaginary bullshit is weird" outlook</br>  <br>You know, in Japan  ghosts have no legs. <br><br>Yuki confirmed dead.<br>Everyone else just imagined Yuki being delusional to cope with their loneliness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are they going to get haunted by ghosts as well? Poor girls.<br>Please let there be no (more) skeletons.</br></br>  <br>It's because there's always that lingering thought, that reminder that it's all fragile and might not even last the whole day.</br>  Kaworu confirmed as having no fixed gender.  So I can fap to Kaworu and it's not gay?  What are Kaworu's pronouns?  <br>Yes, you can anon.</br>   Draw a boy <br> Call it an androgynous   descendent of Adam <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br>He uses boku because he has a bishounen form (at the moment).</br>  <br> descendant <br><br>Anon. Kaworu is Adam.</br></br></br>  <br>4.0 should be two hours of shinji fondling fem-kaworu's funbags</br>  <br>How exactly does that matter?</br>  <br>Kaworu returning as with the appearance of a woman would troll Asukafags, Reifags and Homofags.<br><br>If only Anno wasn't so gay and do this to complete the trolling circle.</br></br></br>  <br> perky pigtails <br>The fuck is this shit? Femworu would clearly have an elegant hime cut.</br></br>  <br>xer</br>  <br>They can look classy, anon.</br>  So you can say Rei doesn't have a gender either right?  <br>Gainax fucked up bad back in the 90s with that whole personified female versions of the angels.</br>  <br>Got a source?</br>  <br>He's fucking adam he doesn't need no god damn gender</br>  <br>it's from srw profile.</br>  Who /notgayafterall/ here?  <br>Rei Q/Rei is Yui's clone, but this is Rebuild Kaworu who was the first Angel, not Tabris. I think NGE Kaworu, as Tabris (not EOE Kaworu), should be considered male, but Rebuild Kaworu isn't.</br>  <br>Great, another addition to the shipping wars.</br>  <br>That because he is dead</br>  <br>Gender or sex? Regardless, dude shows up, strips down, nobody really questions the guy as male, so it's not like his alien nature is really inhibiting the homoerotic subtext of his relationship with Shinji.</br>  <br>it's not gay if it's a shapeshifter?<br><br><br>It's not so bad. I think it looks messy/cute, it depends on the artist. Short haired Kaoru would be better.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Biological sex.<br><br>Kaworu doesn't even consider himself a lilin to be classified mentally as either gender anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NGE and Manga Kaworu is male, because as Tabris he has a male vessel.<br><br>But as Adam (EoE) and Rebuild Kaworu (the Kaworu in OP pic is Rebuild Kaworu), he's not biologically male. He only shifts to take that appearance.</br></br></br>  <br>So basically I can masturbate to the movies and not be gay</br>  <br>Shinji is still a faggot.</br>  <br>That's not canon though.</br>  This is a Japanese boy detective in a dress  <br>It'll either be pandering or NTR with edgy-senpai</br>  So which character is secretly another character in disguise?  <br>nice bait, friend<br><br>maybe you should step back from the fruit of the knowledge of boypussy and fuccboi before taking a bite</br></br></br>  <br> Akechi and Kobayashi are canon lovers <br>Hashiba is going to have to settle</br></br>  <br>Post them anyway to help our new g/a/yfriends acclimate.

(laugh) <br><br>  Taniguchi: "It's not that." (laugh) "I like the fact that at the beginning she was a weakling, but due to Naruto's influence she steadily became strong." <br><br>  Kishimoto: "That's because Hinata doesn't stand at the main character's side like normal heroines*... she's the type that watches him from the shadows." <br><br>  Interviewer: "I thought the heroine was Sakura?" <br><br>  Kishimoto: "That's right. But Sakura is addicted to Sasuke." (laugh) "The reason why Hinata came to like Naruto is clear, but I've deliberately avoided writing down the reason why Sakura came to like Sasuke." (laugh) "That's because somehow, I had the feeling that it would conversely end up sounding contrived." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yurui makes a pass on Himawari <br> the Kumo killing genes deep within Burrito awaken and he ends up causing an international incident </br></br>  <br>Yes I agree. <br><br>You know I thought it was his editor since the garden started of well but before I knew it sharingans and clones and unnecessary retarded shit everywhere. <br><br>Please fucking hand it off to someone else kishi</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  boruto is the jiraiya of his generation, but witout being hopelessly in love with one woman </br>  <br> save mode stupidly powerful.  <br> nobody with a mangekyou would lose to it </br></br>  <br>I'd say it's impossible to get cucked by an animal but then I remembered the story of king Minos.<br><br>And the only time NTR is good is when it happens to someone you hate.</br></br></br>  Hey look, another tournament for Reiji to do nothing in.  <br>Fang of Critias<br><br>Shit was so fucking GOAT<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8WX<wbr>YajeP9TE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No he wasn't. Avian, Burstinatrix, Clayman and Sparkman may of had a lot of fusions together but keeping them on the field was impossible on top of that the monster you get for using them wasn't all that great either,Neos just made the problem even worse because the writers were obviously scared of him being broken with contact fusion.</br>  <br>His main deck monsters were shit but Bubbleman+PoG+Mirage of Nightmare</br>  <br> When it was used in the Kachidoki duel, it was orgasmic. <br>That moment was a really good one.
