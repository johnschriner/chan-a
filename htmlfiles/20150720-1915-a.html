For now here's Shichika and L-Elf.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Requesting a drawfriend try to give a Bankai for Senna please. Usually with Shikai the sword changes in appearance but some don't. And with Bankai the sword could change again or not all all, the user could get a costume change or not, and the power is sometimes the same as the Shikai but may be different but keeping the same concept (I.E Making ice to making more and stronger ice, having a small 2HK weapon to a massive 1HK missile, or freezing opponents to controlling temperature and freezing yourself to absolute zero and being able to move.) They also get a newish name (Zangetsu - Tesna Zangetsu, Sode no Shirayuki - Hakka no Togame, Ryujin Jakka - Zanka no Tachi) but naming Mirokumaru for Bankai isn't necessary.<br><br>Examples of Shikai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=km4<wbr>R8J_CqoU</wbr>  [ ] Senna's is at 8:30<br>Examples of Bankai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4IU<wbr>khdqLeso</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>But anything else is welcomed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128325864 <br>You are silly.</br>  Accidentally quoted, fuck my tired ass.

I don't want to ruin the chance for us both to get qt drawings, but I feel for the requester as a fellow husbando, it's a very complicated predicament. <br><br><br>I believe in you anon, I'm not the best either, but with enough time and effort you can do your waifu proud someday.

I missed most of the weekend so I wasn't optimistic that I'd get anything, and this is cute. Have a great week!</br>  <br>ΔGwaifucuteness = ΔHwaifucuteness - TΔSwaifucuteness<br><br>waifu is a process that involves a very high system entropy and ΔH of the process is negative because waifus liberate a ton of energy as cuteness<br><br>ergo waifus being cute is a spontaneous process<br><br> waifudynamics 101 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I'm sorry this isn't that great I haven't drawn much these past few months  </br>  <br>Now what are all Husbandos? Or are they just considered male Waifus by the theorem?</br>  Requesting Inaba.<br>Anything is appreciated.</br>  <br>You don't</br>  <br>Have Saber as you're waifu.</br>  <br>That's gotta sting.</br>  <br>Je t'aime.</br>  <br>Sometime before summer, I hope</br>  <br> Implying if I request her dressed as Saber you could resist drawing it </br>  Takane Shijou from Idolm@ster wearing the outfit of Milla's spirit form from Tales of Xilia.  <br>idk what im doing</br>  <br>When will you wrap my waifu in your large coiling body, tightening steadily around her, squeezing all the air from her lungs until she eventually dies of oxygen deprivation then dislocate your jaw, carefully taking all of her into your maw and slowly taking her into your gut?</br>  <br>Don't worry, it looks fine! She looks so great in the outfit, it's exactly what I wanted. 'Dem lovely thighs~<br>Thanks for doing my request, and I hope you have a great week!</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>thx bros. yeah it's freehand.<br><br>np. glad you liked it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just ask for this...<br><br>Requesting Saber drawing Boa in a cool pose, P.S. you're a cool guy Boa Senpai</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a website or something? I love your style.</br>  <br>Husbandos are included. Same formula.</br>  <br>Well its fairly easy to prove grammatically in that<br>cute= appealing or delightful<br>appealing = evoking or attracting interest, desire, curiosity, sympathy, or the like.<br>therefore the fact someone has a waifu means they find their waifu cute thus she's cute.<br><br>and here's the mathematically study in a nutshell<br>mathematically speaking we'd have to make a few assumptions <br>1. for every anime girl there is a corresponding 3 dimensional version in some universe<br>2. cuteness is a relative term referring to one or more things being more attractive than another. ie girl 1 is cute because girl 1 is more attractive than girl 2.<br><br><br>now assuming the 2 above are correct.<br>as there are presumably a finite amount of waifus (n), there is also a finite amount of corresponding 3D girls (n). <br>now there are a few assumptions we make on based on the "3dpd" study done at ASU that state that for any 3D trait the 2D representation will always be more attractive than the reality.<br><br>so based on these 2 ideas we can show a direct representation between every waifu and their 3D counterpart. However due to the fact that 2D traits will be superior to 3D counterparts we can prove that each waifu is superior to their 3D version. due to the fact there's an equal number of waifus and an equal number of 3D counterparts we can always connect a waifu to their 3D version. And since all 2D versions are cuter than their 3D version for every waifu there exists something they are cuter than, thus proving that all waifus are cute.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>10/10</br>  <br>Oooh OR here, thank you so much!

Ill be sure to umaru her as soon as I stop being a lazy fuckup.</br>  <br><br><br> goodbyes before bumplimit <br>Scum the lot of you. So easy to say goodbye after you got something</br></br></br></br>  So this is how it ends, huh?  Would you?    It's yet another battle shonen, but why is it so much better than most of them?  Got some cool characters. Art is nice. Makes me feel like if I give it time it can turn into something great, but as of now it's just pretty good.  Likeable MC like Bleach used to have, likeable side characters like Naruto used to have, realistic conversations between students, perfect pacing, amazing villains, both grotesque and cute art style depending on the character, originality in a lot of the superpowers, and Bakugo is the best bully character I've ever seen.  There's been more character development in the last 50 chapters than most shonens have over 500  TRIP ON HORIKOSHI<br>R<br>I<br>P<br><br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminds me too much of generic battle shounen shit. The dialogs are literally naruto/onepiece/bleach all over again.<br><br>I guess the main reason people like it, is because it takes place in a "modern"-esque society and its a normal person gaining power. Also its riding the OnePunch wave.</br></br>  Deku is a great MC, he prepares for every fight and studies his adversaries. I believe that apart from him only Gon has done this in a shonen.  <br> Also its riding the OnePunch wave. <br>But it's more popular</br></br>  <br>Also, we are talking about heroes, so them being silly, calling for power of friendship and sacrificing themselves for the good of others actually makes sense.</br>  <br>Hopefully they don't phase that out as he learns to control his powers more and more, because that's honestly one of my favorite parts about him, how he has to plan around his power being limited in use.</br>  <br>And the comedy is really, really good in my opinion.</br>  Because it objectifies women  <br>This. Noted, Naruto and Bleach were pretty fucking solid for their first 50 chapters as well. The next 50 chapters will show whether or not this manga's got what it takes to be great.</br>  <br>Because the MC isn't stagnating</br>  Ratman was better.  <br>Just wait until the anime comes out, people are going to tear it to pieces and suddenly it won't be cool anymore to praise it.</br>  <br>Then we just say read the manga, as usual</br>  So this happened.  I want Anna to squat like a slav on my face  <br>I get it.<br><br>It's a vagina.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think the heart means she loves having MC as her good friend.</br></br>  <br>THERE ARE FIVE HEARTS</br>  So will next episode consist of Tanukicchi in the hospital with a confused president and (hopefully) a romantically awakened Kajo?  <br>Shes losing her purity already</br>  <br>Ah Ha Ha</br>  im excited for the hijinks to ensue   Gouriki has the hots for Anna and been with her since day. <br> Here comes Okuma turning her into a slut lusting for his dick. <br>I feel sorry for Gouriki.</br></br>  Meh, her pupils are still not hearts. The hearts are only inside her pupils.  Originally I wasn't that into Anna, since she seemed like she'd be the student council president who doesn't like lewd things archetype.<br><br>Then these last two episodes showed there was more to her than that. She's so pure that she has little to no actual knowledge on anything lewd, and she may end up being very receptive to that. I hope very much to see her corruption into a pervert.<br><br>Also, I don't know what the official name is for censoring like this, but I'm actually liking this style.</br></br></br></br>  I need Hiryuu to hurry the fuck up.<br>Or is clawhammer acceptable?</br>  <br>Isnt it just HS slapped onto uncensored version?<br><br>Wait for Hiryuu</br></br></br>  you think anyone is gonna translate the manga or 8 light novels now that this show is out?  <br>it's called mormon bubbling</br>  <br>It's called bubbing. Also nice quads.</br>  <br>It's called Mormon Porn/bubbling. Nice quads.</br>  <br>But gorilla has the hots for trap okuma.</br>    Show about the stupidity of puritanism <br>  Half of the dialog are censored <br>Okay right...

As a result it's become a meme in Japan and has shown up in doujins, manga, and more recently in non-h TV shows and films.</br></br>  <br>Damn, are those rooms a common thing in Japan? Since it looks comfy as fuck to have a pool like that and I refuse to believe that the porn makers actually went through the trouble to build their own pools.</br>  <br><br>The building it's in was made back in the late 80s before the economy crumbled. It's a product of 80s excess that still endures.</br></br>  So MC is going to end up with white hair or black hair?  <br>When will the economy go back to making those?</br>  <br>It's a pool that was used in a lot of AV's.<br><br>It's part of a very expensive high rise apartment (that now, nobody can afford, but cheap porn producers can rent.)<br><br>Its nickname translates to "that pool". It's a meme in Japan because it was so common.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Black Hair. MC's don't end with the girl they have a crush on, they end with the girl they discover to love later on. It's like a law in mango/animu. Just like what Komi is doing with Nisekoi.</br>  <br> MC's don't end with the girl they have a crush on <br>Dude this happens all the time.</br></br>  <br>Name three examples.</br>  <br><br>Name 3 examples of that happening. We are talking with a Harem MC having a crush at the beggining of the animu, not getting the crush along the animu. That crush never gets canon.</br></br>  <br>We need perverts like YOU.</br>  <br> Dude this happens all the time. <br>Chew you havisfaction a singlelicious satisfact to snack that up?</br></br>  <br>anyone have the uncensored version?</br>  <br><br>Is there even an uncensored version?</br></br>  <br><br>Nourin, Baka no test, DxD?</br></br>  <br>Of the OP? No. Funi has added a couple extra censors, but a lot of them were there to begin with.</br>  <br>DxD is harem but I agree with the others.</br>  <br>Nourin MC ends up with both girls, Akihisa from Bakatest ends up with his dream girl Himeji.</br>  <br>MC here could end with both also no? The focus here is different from something like Nisekoi after all.</br>  <br>No, the situation is "MC is in love with one girl but ends up loving another one later"</br>  <br>Thanks Picard.</br>  <br> DxD is harem <br>Yeah I was iffy with that one. I also don't remember if he liked Rias before the anime started since his crush started once he saw her in the balcony I believe.</br></br>  <br>There was even a book published about that pool.<br>http://www.amazon.co.jp/例のプール-例のプール<wbr>研究会/dp/4757222750</wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh I see, yeah those only go one way.</br>  <br>White Album 2 says hi</br>  <br><br>A collection of assorted scenes shot at that pool:<br><br> http://minkchan.com/blog-entry-2432<wbr>.html</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually the situation is "MC is in love with one girl but she abducts him and wants to keep him in her closet to cultivate their love"</br>  Oh man, imagine living in a world where all the girls are sexually repressed and curious.<br><br>Goddamn.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh my, even Maria Ozawa shot some scenes there LOL</br></br>    A kiss awakens the lewd inner slut of a pure woman <br>What would happen if anon got kissed? Turn into a Yamato Nadeshiko?</br>  <br>But anon, that would mean you're sexually repressed and curious too.<br> You can rape each other in public and nobody would even realize what was going on <br><br><br>It only works one way, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Satomi Arai's character is perfect. Along with Yui Horie apparently having a character this show might actually end up decent.  <br>Her voice is so god damn annoying, but overall shes a funny fuckface.</br>  <br>And thats getting of easy, honestly</br>  <br>Sort of like Casting Couch?</br>  S.O.X.

I waiting to see kim jongu jingle ill's face when you gang rape his children and start a revolt.</br>  <br>I think the american media and right wing politicians push these ideas much harder than NK themselves.</br>  <br>Yeah this hardly ever happens. <br><br>Mukaido Manaka<br>Touma Kazusa<br>Shiragami Youko <br><br>Might be more fun listing out all the times the first crush doesn't get realized though. <br><br>Tsukamoto Tenma<br>Hanekawa Tsubasa<br>Kushieda Minori<br>Onodera Kosaki<br>Lunar Edomae (somewhat)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, probably not that far<br>Remember that the laws have only been in place for around a decade, it's not like adults in the street don't know what sex is<br>The kids in high school are the first generation to grow up with so much sexual ignorance</br></br></br>  <br>JwWw finally did it with both main love interests confessing to each other with no bullshit reset to the status quo</br>  <br>Her switch has been flipped and now she craves the dick.<br>If my doujins are to be believed.</br></br>  <br><br>Not that anon, but usually, the MC ends up with whomever he spent the most time with at the beginning. So if the romantic crush was whom the MC interacted the most with in the first couple of arcs, he ends up with her. <br><br>However, if the MC gets up to his shenanigans with another girl in an attempt to get closer to his crush, it's likely that he'll end up with that girl instead. <br><br>Unfortunately. I'm guessing either an open-ended ending, or MC+vice prez pair, gorilla/single end for president, and the scientist+artist form a doujin circle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never noticed how much Anna resembles Ajimu.</br>  Is it true that you can find protein samples in your Urin after beating it?<br>I imagine after pissing two times everything should begone.</br>  <br>This is a comedy. A comedy with a really far off absurd premise. 3p end, joke harem end, and even gay ends are more probable than people think.<br><br>I wouldn't even be surprised if this shit ended with MC becoming the prime minister.</br></br></br>  <br> 3p end, joke harem end, and even gay ends are more probable than people think. <br><br><br>If by more probably, you mean 5% chance compared to 1% chance, then maybe. <br><br>But the ratio of those ends you mentioned vs a straight male-female pairing end is probably like 1 to 20.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A straight hetero end or an open-ended conclusion. Those are common too unfortunately.</br>  <br> open-ended <br>This is like handing me a plate promising me food, but it having nothing on it so I can imagine all the tasty food that might've been there.</br></br>  <br> LOL </br>  <br>Too small of an increase.<br>I'd at least say it goes up to 6~% from .5%.<br><br>How absurd the series is dictates the chances of the other endings. Assuming a series hasn't made it blatantly obvious that it's going for a harem end, then the chances of the other aforementioned endings happening can potentially rise up to 25% versus the usual main girl or open ended shit. Omnibus endings lack data.<br><br>Source: My well-renowned ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Waiting for Hiryuu.  <br>Yeah, but they didn't give you a dish you hate the taste of so you can't rightfully complain about their cooking.</br>  <br>Couldn't find the pool in Shimoneta Ep 2</br>  <br><br> it's turning into a harem </br></br>  NTR<br><br>NTR<br><br>NTR</br></br></br></br>  Why is scientist not in the gang yet?

These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. With the May 2013 publication of the DSM-5 diagnostic manual, all autism disorders were merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD. Previously, they were recognized as distinct subtypes, including autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger syndrome. <br><br>ASD can be associated with intellectual disability, difficulties in motor coordination and attention and physical health issues such as sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances. Some persons with ASD excel in visual skills, music, math and art.<br><br>Autism appears to have its roots in very early brain development. However, the most obvious signs of autism and symptoms of autism tend to emerge between 2 and 3 years of age. Autism Speaks continues to fund research on effective methods for earlier diagnosis, as early intervention with proven behavioral therapies can improve outcomes. Increasing autism awareness is a key aspect of this work and one in which our families and volunteers play an invaluable role.<br>SO YOU ARE THE ONE AUTIST WITH YOUR IROHA PICTURES AND SCREENCAPS FUCKER!"!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SO YOU ARE THE ONE AUTIST WITH YOUR IROHA PICTURES AND SCREENCAPS FUCKER!"!! <br>How fucking angry must a human being be to actually write this.

Iroha always uses Senpai to refer to 8man, even when they are in front of Yukino and Yui</br>  <br>I know, but can we be sure about Yui noticing that?</br>  <br>Well that could've been the artist's train of thought since in the other Iroha one she calls him just "Senpai".</br>  <br>You're not always going to refer to someone the exact same way no matter how much the nips love to do it in shit like this, and with that comic I don't think 8man is there, so it makes a little more sense to be more specific.</br>   In gazing at that priceless, yet transient figure, my breath was taken away. <br> Yukinoshita released her hand from the bar and squeezed the cuff of my coat. In that instant that our hands touched, it felt as though something had taken hold of my heart. <br> Before long, I was visited with a pleasant floating sensation, a sensation as though I’d continue to fall forever. <br> “Help me someday, okay?” <br> Her soft-spoken voice dissipated along with the descending wind, making me unable to reply. <br> That may have been, I think, the very first wish that Yukinoshita Yukino had ever uttered. <br><br>How is the sensation of the drop pleasant?<br>The drops in those rides are never pleasant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is it just me or did SakiSaki only appeared for ONE FUCKING EPISODE<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br>THIS SEASON IS SHIT<br>SHIT</br></br></br></br>  <br>Third season will be the best if Saki applies to be a member of the service club.<br><br> I will personally suck Wateri's dick if that happened along with 8man's VO. </br></br></br>  <br>Watari doesn't need you, he already has Eguchi</br>  What are the chances of this guy having/getting a girlfriend?

The scales have fallen off my eyes.</br>  <br><br>STOP</br></br>  <br> Why is bitchy looking Yui best girl? <br>She was so cute. I miss Yui that had a little tsun to her. When she was less loving and gentle. Right now she has such a hardon for Hikki she is nothing but loving dere. What changed?<br><br><br> you will never have a girl who is deeply in love with you call you kimoi <br>Dang, that shouldn't hurt this much.<br><br>I wonder why she calls him disgusting even though she likes him so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This Iroha is the best Iroha.<br><br>Somehow reading this make me remember Aria from Seitokai Yakuindomo though.</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha is just the best.</br>  <br><br>Don't get me wrong I don't mind moe-blob Yui, but there's something about frowning girls that make me rock solid.<br><br>Anon pls.  you're only making me want her more </br></br></br></br>   chapter 9 <br><br>So where are the rest of them then?</br></br>  <br>Yui is always cute. Tiffed Yui is extra cute. Why doesn't she get mad and tsun at 8man anymore? It was great when she did.</br>  <br>Translate this motherfuckers</br>  <br> This was just my onii-chan skill malfunctioning!! <br>Uh huh, right.<br><br>If any of my brothers want to TL this, go ahead. I don't want to do it on a yukinofag-moderated thread.</br></br></br></br>  So /a/, if 8man wanted to conquer all of the world which of the girls would he pick?<br><br> Please note that only 1 girl is allowed. No loner or multi choices. </br></br>  <br>the only Irohafaggotry they deleted was the shitposting from the start of the thread, don't be such a crybaby.</br>  <br>Translate it pls<br>I will suck your cock in my mind</br></br>  <br>Saika. He'll make him his boytoy for 8man's new utopia.<br><br>Haruno is too risky, he'll much rather play itself and get ISIS to behead her.</br></br></br>  <br>We have different opinions on what shitposting is, then.

He boosts army morale greatly and is also very  cute .</br>  <br>I still dont know why people tried to copy the "Good Irohasu".<br>If the guy who does it almost always does it on time (which he did on this thread as well)</br></br>  Correct me if I'm wrong but 8man has 7 girls who want to fuck him right now.<br><br>1 Haruno<br>2 Yui<br>3 Yukino<br>4 Saki<br>5 Rumi<br>6 Sensei<br>7 Iroha<br><br>I wonder how Ebina and Miura feel about him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Saika.

I didn't know that those changes went live on the site.<br>Oops.</br></br>  <br>yui<br>Also, why is the captcha so much easier on strawpoll?</br></br>  <br>What the fuck /a/? You feel "Yui" about Iroha?</br>  <br>I feel that Iroha should be replaced by Yui. So there would be two Yuis.</br>  <br><br>YUI</br></br>  <br>Yui is always the answer.</br>  <br>So basically you want to ruin the entire show, huh.<br>I really don't understand you genki girl lovers.</br></br>  <br>No I meant proper Yui, tsundere Yui. Iroha isn't too bad though.</br>  <br>They feel kanji: YUI  (hiragana: suffering)  about Iroha</br>  <br> No I meant proper Yui, tsundere Yui. <br>Fucking hell, you disgust me.</br></br>  <br>Why should I care about what some Irohafag feels?</br>  <br>You shouldn't, your shit taste remains your own.</br>  <br>That's right, anon!</br>    <br>I've already cropped it and enlarged it for viewing pleasure.</br>  <br>どうも</br>  <br><br>Can she even afford a Yukata?</br></br>  <br>No, she had to borrow it from her grandmother.</br>  <br>So it's special family relic passed down from generation to generation?</br>  <br>Yes, the next one to have it will be IroHachi's daughter.</br>  What would be the personality of Hachiman's child/ren with<br><br>A)Yukino<br>B)Yui<br>C)Iroha</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaa-san, <br>   why is there blood stains on this? </br></br>  <br>Let's hope Zaimokuza's daughter doesn't take too much after her dad then, it probably isn't cheap to let out an heirloom kimono like that.</br>  <br>God damn it 8man, you just had to do it, didn't you?</br>  <br>A) Loner because they're an icy cunt<br>B) Loner because they're too happy and energetic and it creeps people out<br>C) Loner because they're poor</br></br></br>  Now that's alpha.    How would we all feel if Yui started using her Yuis to her advantage?  <br>This generals keep going.<br><br>What are mods doing? You people have already run off things to talk about and keep repeating the same shit every thread</br></br></br>  <br>Mods are actually in the threads deleting shitposts and spam regularly.</br>  <br> I feel inferior to your bad posture, weak body, ugly mug, shorter height, and shit personality <br> alpha </br></br>  <br><br>This makes me mad.<br><br>I mean it's ok you want to self-insert as an autistic faggotface that has hot chicks on your dick but don't pull that kind of shit.<br>Hayama has nothing to feel inferior against Hachiman. <br><br>He can just ignore his autistic ass and keep winning in life</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad.</br>  <br> Hayama has nothing to feel inferior against Hachiman <br>Lack of high expectations from peers? Ability to change people?</br></br>  <br> How will 8man resist final form Yukino? <br><br>Silly anon, 8man didn't even lift a finger to resist Yukino despite beauty sonnets he made. He has always been desperately grasping straws and keep his mind sane whenever Yui is around.</br></br></br>  <br>being a people-pleasing faggot is hardly "winning at life" even if you are the supposed king of the school.</br>  <br>You only say this because you were like hachiman in highschool, "intelligent, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humor", except real life girls won't even touch someone with that kind of personality, look where you are now.</br>  <br> He has always been desperately grasping straws and keep his mind sane whenever Iroha is around. <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Are you an intelligent person?</br>  Off to bed lads. Stay Yui.  <br>Be realistic. Hachiman is way more attractive than he makes it out to be, and especially with girls like Yukino who are attracted to his only physical downside, there is no way he wouldn't have ended up with a harem</br>  <br> “Say you, if you’re going out with Yui, then you should understand what the deal is with Ebina, right?” <br><br> “T-T-There’s no way we’re going out or anything…” <br><br> Being suddenly told information about my own well-being that I didn’t know, I hurriedly retorted in response. Oh gosh, what’s with this girl? What’s she saying out of the blue? I-It’s not l-like I’m going out with that girl or anything at all! <br><br> As the gross feeling of droplets of sweat trickled down my body, Miura looked at me and mocked me from the depths of her heart with a laugh. <br><br> “What exactly are you misunderstanding here? Gross. Like Yui and Hikio could be going out. That’s not the issue, you know? I’m talking about Yui once you actually talk to her. Gross.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see her vaginabones. And now I can see my dick. Thanks.</br>  Sigh, looks like I am alone again.  <br>you should at least post the higher-rez version.</br>  <br> Sigh </br>  <br> You see, as you smile more and more… (Changing world) <br>Anyone know the other things the background singers say?</br></br>  At this point, a yukino end in the next volume with no sort of time skip would be a bigger asspull than any other girl winning (except for Yui).  <br> bigger asspull than any other girl winning (except for Yui). <br>You mean that, after 11 volumes of nothing but being shit on, things will completely turn around and go as far as a romance in just one volume for Yui, and it won't be an asspull?<br>Yuifags never fail to amaze me.</br></br></br>  <br>You need to work on your reading comprehension.</br>  <br>Why hasn't that hyper fag Hikki tapped this yet? She would let him and there would be no strings attached if he did. If her and 8man did it she wouldn't look too much into it and would be cool about it.</br>  <br>8man knows better than to stick his dick in crazy.</br>  <br> *won't be a gigantic asspull? <br>Thanks for pointing that out, I was sure I had missed a word there.</br></br>  <br>Yukino would solve her identity issues then the last few chapters will be 8man's request/love triangle<br>That's where it's a toss up between Yui or Yukino or friendship end, and none are really asspull</br></br>  <br>Not really, we already know Yukino can stand up for herself, the problem is she doesn't anymore because she lacks any of that confidence she had form the start.<br><br>Yukino is a strong girl but something shook her up.</br></br></br>  <br>nice job not paying any attention to how 8man and Yui's relationship has changed over the course of the last three volumes there. But then you probably just skipped all the chapters that didn't have Iroha in them anyway, so it's to be expected.</br>  <br>Yui is an emotionally balanced good girl who would be fine with other girls dating him because she hasn't invested that much into her relationship with Hikki. She isn't a slut like Yukino who eye rapes Hikki.</br>  <br> But then you probably just skipped all the chapters that didn't have Iroha in them anyway, so it's to be expected <br>As tempting as that may be, I can't do that if I want to see what's going on with the MC.<br>At least most of us Irohafags know that our chances are very, very small. And that of Yukino's is very, very big now that she's about to get a ton of character growth.<br>Perhaps you should learn from our example, hm? And we're the delusional ones here, huh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She said it herself that she's not a nice girl.<br><br>I'm fairly certain she would abduct and/or murder any girl 8man started dating with the exception of Yukino in the hopes of getting a 3P.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't follow the conversation or anything<br>but yes, you are the delusional ones</br></br>  <br> 8man and Yui's relationship has changed over the course of the last three volumes <br>And Yukino's magically doesn't?<br>I don't know how autistic you are to skip an entire series starting with two introverts loathing each other to the point where one actively shows her care and the other emphasize her 'resigned smile'. Take your fucking waifu goggles off.</br></br></br>  <br>She still have some tsun in her.</br>  <br> She said it herself that she's not a nice girl. <br>Explain to me how she wasn't a nice girl during the end of vol 11?<br><br>She has not shown any jealousy or anger towards those sluts eye balling her Hikki.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's unfortunate that 8man is a penguin. Only one can win.</br>  <br>Reading way too much into my post there anon. Never said word one against Yukino or her chances.</br>  <br><br><br>Is she going to solver all of her problems in one volume? She has dependency issues, identity issues, and an inferiority complex (which she tries to hide by acting tough). As we have seen, Yukino is a frail girl. I'm not saying she can't change, however, fixing all of her issues in one volume is a huge asspull.<br><br>As much as I hate time skips, Watari is going to have to do one if he wants 8man to hook up with Yukino (considering that we have 1-2 volumes left). It will be nothing less than an ass pull if she ends up with him with her current problems. Her kind of problems are something that she has to gradually learn to overcome, It's not something that can be fixed in a single day. If they start dating, their relationship would be unhealthy as fuck, it will truly represent a symbiotic relationship.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that why both of them got depressed when they looked at the penguin sign?Is it because it reminded them that there is only one? <br><br> Yukino/Yui should be like Loli from Molester Man, take the loss with grace. </br></br></br>  <br>8man is a penguin? I thought he was a bear/fish/cat/bat/penguin/panda hybrid</br>  <br>Welp, I though you were </br>  <br>So essentially a penguin.</br>  <br>Yui pls</br>  <br>Okay since you still haven't caught on let me explain in a way that even you should understand.<br><br>Your message  indicated that you dislike Yuifags because you believe that it would be an "asspull" for Yui to win in volume 12.<br>You made that response because you believed that the person you were responding to excluded Yui from the "asspull" ending list.<br><br>What you failed to realize is that  actually indicated that (s)he believed that the only ending that would be more of an "asspull" than a Yukino ending would be a Yui ending.<br><br>Let me break it down for you.<br> a yukino end in the next volume with no sort of time skip would be a bigger asspull than any other girl winning <br>So in terms of "asspull" what has been indicated so far is : Yukino end &gt; all other girls<br>Then (s)he says<br> (except for Yui) <br>So now it's : Yukino end &gt; all other girls except Yui<br><br>Logically we can conclude that the "asspull" level goes as follows: Yui &gt;= Yukino &gt; all other girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of her issues are connected, and Watari isn't going to have a lot of space assuming he's going to do one volume, so in that case there's probably gonna be one challenge to face and that will "fix" her somehow. If there's 2 volumes then that's a lot of space that even a fucking Iroha end would be possible if he chooses to develop her in the 2 novels. <br><br>He wouldn't even try to make Yukino and 8man end up with each other in her moe state, I guarantee that. But a timeskip is barely something that would even develop characters for the most part and it typically ends up a shitty asspull like Usagi drop<br><br>It really depends on how Watari does it. You can't really say it's an asspull without really reading the novel, can you? If he does it well then it won't be an asspull, simple as that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So we all just got grammar-trolled by a retarded Irohafag. I feel so ashamed of myself right now.</br>  How many people would burn their books if the genki hard working girl wins instead of their first girl ice melting trope FOR ONCE?<br><br>As much as I'd love to see a Yui end,<br>I honestly don't think that Watari have the balls to pull this off.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing to worry about anon, if you wish to improve your reading comprehension the best way to do it is to have these sorts of discussions and try to figure out exactly what people are trying to say.</br>  <br>I'm a Yukinofag and honestly wouldn't mind Yui winning.</br>  <br>As a Yuifag I think Yukino is best girl and should obviously win.</br>  <br> As a Yuifag I think Yukino is best girl <br><br>What the fuck are you doing? Do you want to be tossed overboard nigga?</br></br></br>  <br>Practically nobody. Contrary to the meme, most Yukinofags aren't autistic enough to go off like that, and only a handful of Irohafags think she's got better than a snowball's chance in hell without the series going further than volume 12.</br>  <br>I wish I could feel the same way, but if I'm being honest I'd be disappointed in a Yui ending.<br>I think 8man and Yukino have a stronger understanding of each other so it would be a shame to see that connection go to waste.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with Yui though, she's a very sweet girl who's love for 8man is quite heartwarming. She could easily make 8man a very happy man and they would be a good match but the potential of their relationship is simply lesser than that of 8man and Yukion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As an Irohafag I agree, Yukino deserves to win because she is best girl, Yui is fine too after Yukino though.</br>  <br>Posting best doujin</br>  <br> indicated that you dislike Yuifags because you believe that it would be an "asspull" for Yui to win in volume 12. <br>Seems that I'm not the one with reading comprehension issues.</br></br>  <br>Can we just all agree to report this shit? I'm tired of seeing the same spam every single thread.</br>  Yuifag here, I am ranking the endings<br>1. Yui <br>2. Yukino<br>3. 3P<br>4. Open<br>5. Other girl end<br>6. Loner<br>7. Friends</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> connection go to waste <br>they can stay as platonic friends after he ends up with Yui, I'm sure she wouldn't mind</br></br>  <br>As a Irohafag I think that Iroha and Tobe are OTP.</br>  <br>Most people would've already learned their lesson by now, you know?</br>  <br>Do you not see how that would be the most awkward relationship ever?<br><br>8man and Yui as husband and wife but 8man spends all his time talking to Yukino and going on platonic dates as friends.</br></br></br>  <br>As a Harunofag I also think Yukino is best girl and deserves to win because of that.</br>  <br>I'd almost say I'd prefer 3P over Yui end myself, but first off there's just no chance it'll happen and secondly there's even less chance of it getting executed well instead of being some shitty borderline open end.</br>  <br>I apologize for the clusterfuck that my wording  has made. What I tried to say is:<br><br>Yukino ending in the next volume= biggest asspull<br><br>Any other girl end besides Yui = still an asspull but not as big as Yukino's<br><br>Yui ending = won't be an asspull, unless you are an animeonlyfag. If you carefully read the novels, you can clearly see that 8man truly cares for her and is conscious of her (up to what level, that is up to debate). However, what matters is that the flags are there and if the spoilers for volume 11 (the untranslated parts) and volume "a" are any indication, it seems like Yui gets more proper romantic flags than from any previous volume.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think 8man and Yukino have a stronger understanding of each other so it would be a shame to see that connection go to waste. <br><br>They don't need love to be together, they're the kind to stand by each others side until the end.</br></br></br>  <br> they're the kind to stand by each others side until the end <br>That's called marriage anon</br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>You're right that they're awkward, they won't even be able to talk much in front of her because they're so awkward. Yui wouldn't care much if they spent a lot of alone time together as platonic friends.<br><br>Sex is a platonic activity too, right? It's just physical activity between two friends.</br></br></br>  <br>Arrogance isn't healthy anon, especially when you're so insecure about your opinions that you feel the need discredit your opposition with petty insults.</br>  <br><br>Contrary to what your non-experience with the opposite sex has led you to believe, men and women actually can just be friends.<br><br>Yes, even if they had been together at one point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't bring up such a weird concept Anon, they aren't going to pursue something that intimate.<br><br><br>It's not like 8man and Yukino ever really functioned like normal people, Yui would probably misinterpret it while Yukino and 8man would probably wonder why she's making such a fuss about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said that they couldn't. I said that it would be awkward.<br><br>Are you trying to say that you think it's not awkward for a husband to have a deeper relationship with another woman than he does with his wife?<br><br>It would be one thing if it was his mother or Komachi but Yukino isn't family and they both clearly had feelings of greater or lesser degrees for one another during their high school days.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if Yui misinterprets their awkward actions as them being intimate  and was actually right ? <br>How would she react?</br></br>  As a Yuifag I think that 8man should end up with Yukino. Thus he will achieve hapines and girl friendship will be saved.    <br>going off into the subjective end of the pool there. 8man's relationship with Yukino isn't deeper than Yui's, it's just different.<br><br>It's been said a hundred different times in these threads, albeit in different words, but Yukino is a like mind to 8man while Yui is a pillar of support. Either is a viable foundation for a strong and lasting relationship.</br></br></br>  Seems like things haven't changed.  <br>Yep, Irohafags still like to brag that they outnumber otherfags as if it's something that matters.</br>  Tobe x Iroha OTP  How much does Yui love her Hikki? Is it a shallow crush or is it deep love?  <br> Tobe <br>I prefer Zaimokuza honestly</br></br>  <br>Why are you triggered? Nobody is bragging.</br>  Am I the only one here enthralled by the Megu Megu Megurin Megurin Power ? Not that I expect her to be relevant in the end of course  and I hope it stays that way so I can keep her for myself .  <br>Tobe x 8roha 4 lyfe.</br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  Irohasu~  <br>The only girl who was kind to 8man without any pretense, care, or ulterior motive.<br><br>Megurin is too pure for this anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Zaimokuza = Watari's self insert <br> Watari loves his kouhai <br> Zaimokuza wants to become an editor <br> Iroha wants to marry an editor </br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is Yui?</br>  <br>Not if 8man becomes one first you fucker.</br>  <br>Megurin~ a fluff. A FLUFF!!</br>  <br>He's going to be a househusband after he marries Yukino though</br>  <br>Yes but there's a difference between those two types.<br><br>From a business minded approach Yui is the obvious pick.<br>She possess social skills and perspectives that 8man does not.<br>It's more time efficient to establish a partnership where either person specializes in particular skill sets that both reap the rewards of.<br>That, by it's very nature, is quite practical which is why many relationships in the world are founded the same way.<br><br>With Yukino it's more of a philosophical ideal. To found a relationship on desire rather than need. A relationship where understanding and trust are held at paramount importance. The idea behind the relationship comes from a mental experiment. If you had everything you could possibly need, what would you want? For many the answer is to be truly understood.<br>Unfortunately such a thing is impossible. Humans are incapable of transmitting their thoughts and feelings directly to another human being. Regardless, it's an ideal people strive for, sometimes for their entire lives.<br>Imagine it like phi and the golden ratio. Phi is imperfect and the further it goes on the closer it will get to the perfection of the golden ratio. Ultimately it's futile because it will never get there. Nevertheless the journey towards that ideal is what it's all really about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you bite obvious baits?</br>  <br> Thinking Yukino and her family will tolerate her having a jobless husband <br><br>House-husband end is Saki only. Sorry pal.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino will be busy with her job 8man will probably get some job where he works from home while taking care of the kids.</br>  <br>tl;dr</br>  <br><br>I got it this time<br>8man becomes a writer and Yukino becomes a businesswoman<br>8man's first book is "My adult romantic comedy is right as expected"</br></br></br></br>  <br>The entire romcom was wrong, the romance wasn't.</br>  <br>Whose grave are they standing over?</br>  <br>Amazing how on the VN Yukino still behaves like a fucking pet.</br>  <br> Their own. </br>  <br> She twisted her ankle trying to walk Sable. </br>  <br> genki <br> hardworking <br>Who'd burn their books if it's an ORIMOTO end?<br>She does have some parallels with Chihiro, so it won't be an asspull.<br> normalest normalfag <br> got courted by the MC, but it doesn't go anywhere. <br> MC got so butthurt he turned into a cockroach. <br><br>Now we just need 8man courting her and Iroha at the same time.<br>Then have him drop Iroha because he doesn't think she's genuine.<br>8man takes Orimoto to a V-day dance collaboration between Soubu High and her high school.<br>They go to the school roof top to watch the fireworks via the secret unlocked staircase.<br>8man dumps her right before they kiss and says "Ha-ha... I tricked you. I only pretended to like you to get back at you for bullying me in junior high."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   loves 8man more than any other girl <br> supports him more than any other girl <br> understands him more than any other girl <br> cares about him more than any other girl <br> he has hurt her the most out of any girl <br> has worked the hardest for his sake <br> accepts him for what he is <br>There is no good reason why she shouldn't win.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then how did they die? </br>  <br>Saki-fag here.<br><br>Morale on the ship is low but if Orimoto inexplicably won, I'd love it purely for the ass-blasted reaction of all the other shipper-fags.</br></br></br>  <br>Both will win in the end. Yukino will win Hikigaya-kun's and independence, Yui will win a cookie man.</br>    <br>That isn't much of a choice there Gahama-san. I would pick yandere because at least I would have a shot of not dying. Icould just break up with her later. I could cheat on her anyways and it would be fine if she doesn't find out.</br>  <br>She didn't take it too well when she found out Hikki got Yukino a Pan-san and all she got was a dog collar.</br>  <br>She's not his type.</br>  <br> implying the collar won't be a regular fixture of Yui and 8man's love life. </br>  <br>I'm not sure that many people would actually be that upset by an Orimoto end.<br><br>She's really not that unlikeable.</br></br></br>  <br>What is a "type?"</br>  <br>8man doesn't have a type, he was focusing on "liking them".<br>The type didn't matter since he fell for all the previous girls for the exact same thing, they all showed him just a bit of compassion and he misunderstood that.<br><br>That aside someone make a gif of Orimoto shaking those sleeves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, I got to thinking: Did we ever find out how Yui felt about Yukino and 8man's date?</br>  <br>In the LN she never knew about the date because she saw them at the animal expo thing and Yukino asked him out after the misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Romantic chemistry and/or natural attraction.<br><br><br> 8man doesn't have a type <br>Girls like Komachi.<br><br> The type didn't matter since he fell for all the previous girls for the exact same thing, they all showed him just a bit of compassion and he misunderstood that. <br>Good job missing the entire point of the conversation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Girls like Komachi. <br>Not exactly girls like Komachi, he likes girls that can take care of him.<br><br>Komachi basically took up the roll of mom in his life since 8mom is always working or sleeping, Komachi is the one who cooks, cleans and all that for him.<br><br> I bet you think he was talking about YY with the whole quiet girl and loud girl thing. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>To elaborate, what the conversation is saying is that 8man believes his old crushes weren't "love", but he doesn't actually understand what love is.<br><br>8man and love is a lot like 8man and genuine. He can only call things non-genuine/non-romantic, but he doesn't actually understand what is genuine/romantic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not exactly girls like Komachi, he likes girls that can take care of him. <br> Komachi basically took up the roll of mom in his life since 8mom is always working or sleeping, Komachi is the one who cooks, cleans and all that for him. <br>Because Iroha takes care of 8man so very often right?<br><br>   <br>It's an allusion, not a direct referral.

I don't remember Yui minding that he and Yukinon were in the same room together.</br></br></br></br>  I'm a Yukinofag, she doesn't deserve Hikki but she needs him. I wouldn't be too sad if Hikki ends up with Yui and she ends up being a loner business woman.  Who has that image of Hachiman telling Yukino that she shouldnt change who she is during culture festival. We already probably seen final form Yukino: the one in Volume 6/early Vol 7 before shit went down with Ebina confession<br><br>Confident but goes dere around Hachiman</br></br>  <br>Nice context.</br>  Is Yukino destined to leave? Please dont go Yuki<br><br> No timeskip  <br> No giving Hachiman a hair ribbon so he always remembers her regardless if she wins the 8bowl or not <br><br>Please dont</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “Senpai, you really do like younger girls.” <br> “No, not really.” <br> Older, younger, it didn’t matter. I was the type that almightily found most people hard to deal with. <br> I brushed her off and Isshiki clicked her tongue. <br> “Then…” <br> Isshiki coughed to check her throat, sent me a single upwards glance, and immediately looked away. <br> She tightly gripped one hand at the bosom of her uniform while the other weakly trembled and adjusted her skirt. With moist eyes, the breaths she let out were hot. <br> Then, she spoke in fragments. <br> “Do you hate… younger girls?” <br> I…… do not! Yeah! If you had to ask, I absolutely loved them! <br><br>Iroha doesn't affect 8man whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Way to ignore what happened next.</br>  <br><br>So basically WW butchering his writing career?</br></br>  <br><br>+1 flag for Yukino actually.<br><br>Likes younger girls but Isshiki has no effect. <br><br>wwwwwww</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It didn't happen in the anime.</br>  <br>Are you being retarded on purpose?</br>  <br>Your post is reasonable, but I fully doubt the reason behind your post is reasonable.</br>  <br>Now that's grasping at straws.

Is Yukino smarter than Haruno? I imagine they must have had very similar genes but surely Yukino's isolation has granted her more time to expand her pool of knowledge than Haruno.  <br>They might be in the same floor. <br><br>Well Yukino might not be around but Hachiman, Yui, Komachi, and Iroha could man the service club in her absense</br></br></br>  <br><br>I dunno. I guess Yukino may have more book-learnin' but Haruno is some sort of insane unrealistic super-genius at reading people.<br><br>I mean Hachiman casually mentions "It wasn't genuine" in that phone talk with her and from that single insignificant line Haruno has gleaned the entire cosmic importance of 'genuine' to Hachiman to the point where she might as well have been sitting in the room when he gave his genuine speech.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll be a distance friendship. If the club dissolves it's more likely than not that she'd be going overseas.</br>  <br> friendship <br><br>8man makes a new and better service club with Komachi, Saki, Miura and Black Jack.<br><br>You know what forget the service club.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> in society females are becoming more masculine while males are becoming more feminine </br>  <br> people who hate on Haruno are this fucking dense <br>Have you considered she knows about genuine from Shizuka and realized that 8man picked it up from her?</br></br>  <br> autohided these many comments <br>you autohide Iroha comments too? I thought I was the only one, too bad I can't filter it or I may filter actual discussion happening</br></br>  <br>Totsuka doesn't like 8man that way.</br>  In the LN it's stated that Yukino's special class is for students preparing to go abroad or who have come back from going abroad. So technically she's not necessarily headed abroad just based being in that class since we know she's been abroad already.<br><br>Though I think she probably will end up going to a non Japanese university. It'll come down to who wants her to go abroad and why she herself may want to. If her reason for wanting to go abroad is "I've got to escape from my family" then she may decide the whole urge is unhealthy on her part.</br></br>  <br>"Genuine" was post-Orimoto date though.</br>  <br><br>  A Harunofag is this fucking insecure as to think my post was anti-Haruno <br><br>Besides even if what you say is true it's still an incredible degree of logic leaping and/or perceptiveness on her part. Though as  states the timing doesn't match up.<br><br>Remember that all Hachiman has said to her is that one fucking line. She's obviously some sort of mind reader.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I got the idea from some anon who posted it, probably you<br>Yeah you're right, I wish there was a way to identify Irohafags and filter them out, the only thing stopping me from filtering Iroha out completely is that I actually like her character, not her autistic fanbase</br></br>  <br>Or maybe she is working with Shizuka, both in some way trying to fix Yukino and Hachiman since they know how messed up both of them are.</br>  <br> Actual discussion </br>  <br>Yeah, I was slightly off base there.<br><br>It's not so much that 8man picked it up from Shizuka as it is treated as a concept that the adult characters are familiar with by default.<br><br>Speaking of which, did 8man ever bring up genuineness with Shizuka or did she also just bring it up out of hand?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah of course the author can cook some explanation up for it. But I don't think he will.<br><br>All I'm saying is that one aspect of Haruno is unrealistic. It strains credulity that she could be so clued in the significance of it to Hachiman based on that one line. Yes if the author tells us later that Sensei and Haruno are in cahoots or that Iroha told Hayama about it during her confession who then told Haruno then we'd have a reason for it.<br><br>But I seriously doubt Haruno is directly working with Sensei on this. Haruno is pretty messed up herself judging by the third memorandum in vol 10.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304388 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304395 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304417 <br>based<br><br>Irohashitters were the most cringeworthy fucks in the season threads</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah the dubs shit a while back destroyed their reputation forever.

It is a leap of logic. I'm glad you understand that.<br><br>I mean those four points do not even come close to implying some sort of active direct cooperation between Haruno and Sensei. They don't foreshadow it or even suggest it. Sensei has had many teacher-student relationships before and after Haruno. And the concept of 'genuine' is something everyone is familiar with.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best doujin coming through..</br>  <br>Haruno doesn't even know the meaning of the word.<br><br>Haruno needs to be raped repeatedly by old men before she shows any genuine emotions, and even then it would only be fear.</br></br></br>  <br> Even better </br>  <br> inaccurate, negative critique isn't hate <br>Could you be any more defensive?</br></br>  <br> yui <br> yukino <br> best anything </br></br></br>  <br>So much great findings.</br>  <br> Yuigahama briefly sighed and looked at Isshiki. “You know what, the way you’re asking really is the problem…” <br> “…Yeah, I guess.” <br> Yep, I can agree with that. Though, I was finally starting to get used to it now. Isshiki didn’t find that pleasing and looked at me with resentful eyes. <br> That attitude caused me to make a bitter smile. <br> Isshiki, her behavior, and her speech were charming, but there were several reasons why her actions didn’t affect me all that much in the present.

I'm sorry if this revelation is shocking to you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the concept of 'genuine' is something everyone is familiar with. <br>So you admit there was nothing unusual about how Haruno answered 8man. I'm glad we could settle this discussion.</br></br>  <br> top kek <br> he's not even laughing in that scene </br></br>  <br><br>The concept being familiar to everyone and Haruno knowing how utterly important it is to Hachiman in particular are rather different things you know.</br></br>  <br>I raise.</br>  <br>It wasn't stated at all but given the timing it was the only possible situation Haruno learned about it. <br><br>Isshiki already has a history of not keeping her thoughts to herself and Hayama isn't such a lapdog to go reporting about every little thing he encounters to Haruno. <br><br>Besides, even with Haruno's personality surely she would have encountered the issue of being genuine in her own experiences.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  inaccurate <br><br>Really? So far I've seen two alternative explanations for it. One is some sort of hair brained theory involving Haruno and Sensei acting as in collusion to fix Yukino and Hachiman. That has almost no evidence in favor at all unless the author inserts something about it in the next volume.<br><br>The other is the poster who said that Haruno forced it out of Iroha. But I don't remember that being stated directly in vol 10 when I read it. <br><br>So until someone does point to where it was specifically stated in vol 10 (or post genuine in vol 9 I guess) I'm going with the "Haruno somehow gleaned it all from one throwaway line from Hachiman". Which means that, yes, it was unrealistic of her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm too lazy to find the one with Tobe so you win this time<br>also <br> yui with fang, not komachi <br>vomit</br></br></br></br>  <br> yui with fang, not komachi <br> vomit <br>Good to know that I'm not the only one that vomits whenever I see Yui.</br></br></br>  <br> actually trying to guilt by association on an anonymous imageboard <br><br>Reddit please fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>I want the full scan of that one.</br>  <br>I really wish that doujin was about Tobe and Iroha, not Hikki and Yui.</br>    <br><br>And maybe you're right. It's not something we can take as gospel, but it's a possibility. I would tend to think that the author would have put something in there to let us know that's what was discussed if it were true. But I really think Wataru just didn't care enough about how realistic it was for Haruno to be keyed in on that. She already has shown an extraordinarily high degree of perceptiveness, beyond real life human beings.<br><br>Harunofags are just really insecure. You make one minor little criticism of her characterization and they get incredibly bent out of shape. I actually like Haruno. Although I don't view her motives as being as clear-cut in Yukino's best interest as some Haruno defenders believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>8man brought it up when talking about his first love. Of course it would give a big tell.<br><br>Besides, you're ignoring the fact that 8man and Haruno have had a lot of interactions both before and after to familiarize her with his personality and thought process.</br></br></br>  <br>Ikr.<br>My dick vomits precum everytime I look at Yui.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't think their prior interactions or Hachiman stating that one line are enough to establish from Haruno's PoV how important 'genuine' is to him. Only his speech to the service club in vol 9 really made that clear.<br><br>Haruno acts like she was in the room when it happened. She brings it up to Hachiman as well as in her monologue in vol 10 (the latter is understandable when you consider it's importance to her independent of Hachiman) and she beats him over the head with it in vol 11, twisting the knife using insight she should not possess.<br><br>But I'm through arguing about it. So we'll just agree to disagree on it. It's subjective to some extent anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> final form Yukino <br><br>So a full-on shapeshifter?</br></br></br>  <br>Haruno makes it her business to get info about Yukino out of Hayama whether he is willing or not.<br><br>I don't remember when Hayama says this "I can see why she worries about you."<br><br>Hayama could have heard about it from people, who worry about 8man and who might talk about 8man with him. <br><br>Yui, who is in his clique.<br>Yukino, Hayama being the only male non-relative in her phone contacts<br>Iroha via confession and he assumes 8man made her that way.<br>Shizuka, who invited his clique for extra credit camp activities<br><br>So there, he's the possible leak and Haruno is Izaya, raping people for information and rustling the blonde bishounen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But I really think Wataru just didn't care enough about how realistic it was for Haruno to be keyed in on that <br>If the basis for your argument is "I think the writing is bad" you don't have an argument.<br><br> I actually like Haruno <br> Harunofags are just really insecure <br>Just because you're insecure doesn't mean you should go generalizing anyone else who happens to like the same character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like short hair and breast implants.</br>  <br>You poor soul, that's terrible. Even 8man is trying to get her off him in that pic.</br>  <br>I want summer to leave.</br>  <br>moe + ice queen</br>  <br>It's all in her genes she doesn't need implants.</br>  <br>Yuifags aren't going anywhere, sorry.</br>  <br>They will once school is back in session.</br>  <br>But these threads will die before that.</br>  <br>If only we'd be so lucky.</br>  <br>She'll just slice off winning girl's skin and wear it as a suit a la Silence of the Lamb.</br>  <br><br><br>Nice try.<br><br>But it's well established fact that most underagefags are Yukniofags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man is probably still crushing on Yukino even into volume 11, he just doesn't think he'd ever be able to get with her.</br>  <br>Have you seen these threads? Are you sure it's not the Irohafags?</br>  Will Yahari threads reach im@s and saki levels of eternal autism or will it end before the next season?  <br> There’s just one big reason amongst them all, however, and that was simple. <br> “As long as I have my little sister, I like them either way, older or younger.” <br> “That sounds like a disease far worse than being a siscon or someone into younger girls!” <br><br>8man was so unaffected by Iroha that he announced his love for Komachi in front of the club.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd gladly take autism over this /v/ faggotry.</br>  <br>He states his love for Komachi out loud many times, even Komachi states her love for Hachiman out loud.<br><br>Neither care what anyone thinks.</br></br></br>  <br>The timing is still suspect as fuck, especially considering he specifically uses Komachi as a defense against Iroha on multiple occasions.</br>  <br>The timing is a bit weird but he has absolutely no problem saying he loves Komachi, hell he's even stated he wouldn't know what he would do if they weren't related by blood.<br>Komachi didn't even mind what would probably happen if that were the case, it creeped out Yui, Yukino and to some extent Totsuka.</br></br>  <br>Not him but given what Iroha does later on the volume, I'm sure she wasn't creeped out.<br>And the timing is not weird, Komachi really did become a scapegoat for whenever Iroha is in his lewd thoughts.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but he still has context. 8man loves Komachi but he's not always honest when it comes to Komachi. (IE him saying he just likes that she takes care of him. In reality he spoils her pretty often as well.)<br><br>8man's declaration about Komachi in that scene was a direct continuation of his internal monologue about how Iroha "doesn't affect" him, he even went as far as saying it was his biggest reason. As a result, it's undeniable that he made the statement specifically in reaction to Iroha.<br><br>And that's just following 8man's thought process, not getting into the fact he self-contradicts like 5 times in that single scene to show the reader his loss of composure.</br></br></br></br></br>  autism  <br>Would anyone actually be surprised if we got an incest end?</br>  <br><br><br>Iroha != Komachi<br><br>8man doesn't even see Iroha as a "younger girl" like Komachi.<br><br> Speaking of which, she’s a year younger, isn’t she…? It certainly didn’t feel that way because she didn’t show the least amount of regard, honor, courtesy, and respect towards me, so she didn’t feel like an underclassman at all… <br><br> “If anything, you were born in April, so you’re less than a year apart from me. So you don’t feel all that much younger than me, anyway.” <br><br> It’s only after I took a couple of steps back that I could feel the gap between us. If we’re talking about the age gap from like Komachi or Haruno-san, that was obvious. Hiratsuka-sensei, that’d be… yeah. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>I was wondering when you'd show up, denialfag.<br>Though, Iroha != Komachi is correct, I'll give you that.</br></br>  Where can i find the other chapters?  <br>GJ 8man, now will you stop making excuses as to why you're not into Iroha.</br>  Do you think Watari will ever bring up the picture Yukino bought at Destinyland again  <br>Probably with Haruno finding it in Vol12.<br><br>Although, Yui slept over at Yukino's sometime during Christmas didn't she? Yukino probably has the picture tucked away somewhere.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Welp,<br>I gave up trying to argue with Irohafags.<br><br>They are so fucking deluded they actually think 8man's love for Komachi is a indication that 8man's into Iroha.<br><br>Despite 8man outright said that he doesn't see Iroha as a yonger girl.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  <br>Nobody is stopping you from doing your thing every thread every time people try to discuss anything about Iroha, you know.<br>You might as well just not read the first half of the volume, it will be very unpleasant for you. Not volume 10,5 level unpleasant but quite close to it.<br><br><br>いろはす～</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruno is meddlesome but not Hayama. And Isshiki is the leak, you are really reaching if you think Yui or Yukino would leak such an intense and private moment to other people, least of all to Hayama.</br>  <br>Obviously you must have some sort of brain damage and be put out of you misery.<br><br>8man=teenage boy<br><br>He'd get feelings for any cute girl who'd say hello to him.<br>He's still as naive as he was with Orimoto.<br>He's just in denial that his feelings for them might not be GENUINE; therefore, he overcompensates with logic.<br><br>Cute kouhai wants him to take responsibility.<br>He'd have to be gay if his dick didn't twitch involuntarily by that notion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He'd have to be gay <br>But he is</br></br>  <br> Nobody is stopping you from doing your thing every thread every time people try to discuss anything about Iroha, you know. <br> You might as well just not read the first half of the volume, it will be very unpleasant for you. Not volume 10,5 level unpleasant but quite close to it. <br><br>No I don't hate Iroha, I just hate Irohafaggotry and how deluded they are. <br><br>Keep calling anyone who disagree with you denialfag if this makes you feel better.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're half-corrrect but I feel like you're being misleading.<br><br>Iroha doesn't "feel" like a younger girl to 8man, but he doesn't actually realize it until he's put on the spot in the club.<br><br>Prior to that he'd probably mentally labelled her as younger/kouhai simply because that's what her status was.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Hayama knew about genuine would he see 8man in a different light?</br>  Shit I fucked up twice<br><br>meant for <br><br><br><br><br>Did I say anything about 8man doesn't have feeling for Iroha?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was just saying we don't know who the "she" is in that context and that ambiguity makes Hayama a "possible" leak.<br>And that "she" seems to talk about 8man to Hayama occasionally.<br>If that "she" was one of the girls who know about "genuine", it's not much of a stretch.<br><br>A real stretch would be Yui talking about it with Yumiko and Yumiko telling Hayama how gross Hikio is.<br><br>Any who, Haruno and 8man could've talked about it on one of their secret meet ups.<br> Haruno has been 8man's un/official GF since Orimoto's appearance. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't get it, why "Irohafags" and not just "shitposters"?<br><br>All you're doing is giving /v/ what they want by subscribing to group mentality.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui talking about it with Yumiko and Yumiko telling Hayama how gross Hikio is. <br>She knows, you all know damn well she knows.</br></br>  <br>Hayama, too, would want the 8-incher if he learned of genuine.</br>  <br>Nor did anyone say "8man's love for Komachi is a indication that 8man's into Iroha", but you.<br><br>We've only been saying that he uses Komachi as an excuse and mental block for whatever feelings he has for Iroha.<br><br>Seriously go kill yourself, but I doubt you could figure out how to operate a 12gauge shotgun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure if actually stupid or just the actual denialfag.<br><br>Basically we're deluded because we don't take her scenes out of context? That's amazing.<br>We must also be deluded for knowing that Iroha's chances are very low, right? I guess you think she will win.<br><br>I'm going to miss these threads and I'm going to miss the neutron stars that post here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If being both Yukino and Yui being in love with the same guy causes problems why doesn't one of them agree to stop being in love with 8man?  <br> Iroha's chances are very low <br>Not the anon you're shitflinging with, but the girl that turned romance into a major plot point and took all of 8man's firsts (Komachi doesn't count) has low chances?</br></br>  <br>Aside from the supposed indirect kiss what firsts?</br>  <br>Not him but compared to Yui &amp; Yukino, it is pretty low.<br><br> But there, I could hear a small cough overlap with a quiet voice. <br> “Everyone… I see.” <br> “Mmm…” <br> I turned and Yukinoshita who should’ve been reading her book glanced at me. But when our eyes met, she abruptly turned her face away. On the other hand, Yuigahama who had been fiddling with her cellphone had stopped her fingers and froze with a troubled expression. <br> And again, the club room became quiet. Huh? What’s with this silence…? <br> As I sat there restlessly in the awkward mood, Isshiki removed her gaze from her compact mirror and glanced at us. She then let out a brief sigh. “…I don’t really care, but is it easy to enter a publisher?” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yumiko confessing to Hayama and getting rejected, her clique falls apart, she goes up to 8man with ruddied cheeks, running mascara, an a vendetta, she raises her fist, grabs him by the collar and tells him to take responsibility, he raises his arms up and closes his eyes, but she goes in for a kiss, when?</br>  <br>Right. Yukino should just stop being in love with 8man.</br>  <br>Date, chocolate. Bag-holding is a first of sorts too.<br><br>She might even end up being the first genuine girl if the club doesn't get their shit together soon.<br><br><br>Care to elaborate?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A) How would they decide who stops being in love<br>B) you can't fall out of love with a command.

It's just a matter of her acknowledging her feelings.</br></br>  <br>Are you saying she doesn't actually know she likes him, unlike double YY. That would be interesting once she is honest and genuine about it.</br>  <br> Misquoted again <br> Fuck it I need sleep. </br></br>  <br>I still don't get why people think the pretenses for Iroha's date were false. Just because she had multiple reasons doesn't mean she was insincere about any of them, Iroha's just really economical.</br>  I want Irohafags to go back to 9gag.  <br>At least prior to 11, I don't think she either realizes or acknowledges it. She probably teases 8man because to her it just feels natural, similarly to how 8man naturally ends up treating her similarly to Komachi, and it escalated over time without her realizing it.<br><br>11 was significant because she directly asks 8man his feelings for the first time, and gives him a proper Valentine's gift. It seems like it marks the start of her actually getting serious toward 8man, with the results of the 10.5 date as a motivator.<br><br>The idea that she's been sneakily trying to get into 8man's pants this whole time doesn't make any sense, since it directly contradicts their conversation after the Hayama rejection.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly</br>  <br>Because you can't have multiple motivations while doing one thing. If you do you're not genuine.</br>  <br>It's Sunday evening in buggerland.</br>  <br>Shipping wars and shitposting aside, I honestly like Iroha as a character. I think she is the most interesting character behind Haruno and Hayama. I really like how there are multiple ways to interpret most of her scenes and how sly she is about doing things.</br>  <br>you so called discussion mostly came from those EOP secondaries who only have shallow understand of the series.<br><br>Such quality discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>That's wrong.

Halfway there already.</br>  <br>I have bad news for you...</br>  <br>The slut that drags the teams purity down.</br>  <br><br>So we're all agreed Rii's worst, then?</br></br>  Would Rii do anal?  <br>Except for one or two delusional people, yes.</br>  <br>Uni sluts are the worst.</br>  <br>Miki is</br>  <br>she wouldn't resist</br>  <br>But look how cute she is.</br>  <br><br>Don't talk shit about glasses nigger<br>Even if she is a cannibal, still better than some crazy bitch with a  bear fetish </br></br></br>  <br>Those eyes still scare me.</br>  <br>She's cute, but damn she so boring.</br>  <br>I want to nibble her thigh too.</br>  <br>This. I don't know what game they're playing, but it ain't good. They're probably going to use our cute heroines as sacrifices to the zombies or they're going to eat them or something.</br>  <br>Yeah, hehe. "Cute".</br>  What's wrong with her thighs, though?  <br>My guess is that they are part of a bigger group where they are on the lowest rank (bed warmer), so they are giving the Gakkous to the leaders as a meal ticket to ensure their survival.</br>  Alright /a/, which  Guracho  would you  take out to mexican food and tequila?     <br><br>Miki a slut anon</br></br>  <br><br>Bromance not Yuri, ok.<br><br>This is what I agree with.</br></br></br></br>  Through the power of Christ and a plowshares turned into swords, Megu-nee will protect all the waifus from the zombies even if they bully her.  <br><br>Megu-nee is the real hero<br>Honoraburu sacrifisu</br></br></br>  so cute and pure.  Ooga Booga where are the Riis at?  <br> those cowtits on Yuki <br>What the fuck did they do?</br></br>  <br>That really should be more subtle.

Are all their panties soiled and infected from being worn too many days in a row? Did they just throw them out and decide to go commando? </br></br></br>  <br>She saw her panties.<br><br>They have lots of water.</br></br></br>  <br>They have clean, fresh water thanks to the on-site water purifier/storage tank at the school and electricity due to the solar panels on the roof.

Plus she told them about Megunee.</br>  <br>Who are you, some kind of tsundere? I love you too, just like all tsunderes. You aren't special at all :D</br>  <br>Nah she didn't try to bite them, she wasn't a zombie at all just a worst girl.</br>  So is the OP going to get more grim after every episode?  <br>What did the girls know about Megu-nee, anyway? Did they see her getting bitten? Did they know she went away by her own will?<br><br>I've always wondered how they reacted to Megu-nee just disappearing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I hope<br> I'm expecting to see Megu-nee and dog like a zombie at some point </br></br></br>  <br>They know everything. Read the manga.

Rii?</br>  <br>NOW WE'RE TALKING</br>  <br>any of them if i force them</br>    What I didn't like about the helicopter pilot incident was the glaring lack of oversight over a precious resource like a helicopter being allowed to take off from a military base without a backup pilot in attendance.<br><br>These military guys are one of the few survivors from this zombie apocalyse yet they let some faggot essentially hijack what is likely their only helicopter without anyone suddenly cussing the pilot out on radio and asking what the fuck was he doing and where the fuck is he going with their only helicopter even if the pilot had successfully gone up in the air, preventing anyone from pointing a gun at him and demanding he to come back to base.<br><br>Because prior to this, we saw the military all traveling together and wearing haz mat suits and coordinating together yet somehow this helicopter pilot managed to sneak away.<br><br>Don't military helicopters have black boxes as well?<br><br>You think they would have been alerted that a helicopter went down and then tried to do a search and rescue asap but days passed by and no sign of the JSDF going ballistic that they lost a helicopter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Miki the only person wearing garter?  <br>If the incident is contained to Japan (which it most likely is) you would also question why no other country has checked it out on satellites or whatnot, since people would ask questions if a major country went dark for months.</br>  <br>He was probably their last helicopter pilot in their last helicopter.</br>  <br>Why do you think he wasn't given permission or orders to do that? He looked calm when he first got in it. If he was doing it without permission he would have looked a lot more hurried and nervous.<br><br>Agree with all the other points, though. I really wonder what the hell he was trying to do alone, with a copilot or crewmen.</br></br></br>  <br>without a copilot or crewmen, I mean/</br>  <br>They have been stuck in school for months with no help or any military presence.<br>Radio is dead.<br>Internet is dead.<br>Telecommunication is dead.<br><br>It is either we are looking at an isolated experimental island where no one in the outside world know or the whole world is gone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The helicopter pilot should have already told the captain or any doctor on base that he had been bitten before and had taken those vaccines and such a person would never been allowed to travel alone in case he suddenly loses control of his body when the infection can't be prevented anymore from corrupting his body.<br><br>It just felt too surreal seeing him casually fly away with a helicopter and the base being so unaware about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Radio isn't dead.<br><br>Anybody with a car in the area would have been able to listen to the radio since the radio chick and her office radio building still successfully broadcasted music.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, that is what I am talking about. It was a private radio broadcast and not emergency government released broadcast telling people to evacuate to safe area, news update &amp; etc.</br>  Your face when zombies keep their old habits and go walk around to their favorite places.<br><br>In Japan, the countryside is losing a lot of young folk.<br><br>Your face when the countryside like Hokkaido would be the safest areas in Japan right now because not too many zombies will be having the habit of walking to the country..</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she's not only retarded but literally insane?</br>  <br>Electricity still works though.<br><br>The girls managed to fill up their car with gas from the local gas station if I recall.<br><br>Someone is still working at the power stations.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that faucet dick </br>  <br>This one has writing on the top panel as well.</br>  <br>Too bad about that middle child, though.</br>  <br>Why do helicopter pilots have to wear gas masks again?<br><br>Doesn't that make it a pain in the ass to respond to radio?</br></br></br>  Just watched the first ep, I knew something was off when i saw pic related, but then the rooftop scene happened and i realized something very bad was happening in this show, i was actually expecting something more like Higurashi, this was really good anyway.<br><br>/animeblog.</br></br>  <br>They might catch an airborne zombie shit and start nuking friendlies with missiles. Either that or it's supposed to be an oxygen mask though this one isn't connected to anything.<br><br>(idk)</br></br></br>  <br> like Higurashi <br>Meaning what?</br></br>  So if a zombie invasion happens to you, where would you prefer to go?<br><br>Costco or Walmart, if those are the only two choices for you.</br></br>  <br>Costco probably, build a shelter on those huge shelves they got there.</br>  <br>Out into the badlands. Everyone else will be rushing to Costco, and it will only take one infected getting in to affect everyone else.<br>After a good while, I'll go looting.</br></br>    <br>Target.</br>  <br>No guns, though.</br>  <br>Why either of those? If you have a choice at all goto lowes/homedepot. The possibility of survival and weapon making are endless.</br>  <br> wanting guns </br>  <br>Only answer is Lowe's</br>  <br>My parents have a cabin about 2 hours away from the nearest town stocked with guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Only enough food to last maybe a month, though.

Nor does the idea of tearing off her panties, bending her over said table, and slamming dick into her cunt, piercing her hymen and crashing through her cervix, appeal to you? How about piercing her uterus so ferociously that it kills her tiny womb, leaving her infertile? Ditto the idea that, through all the pain, her cunt eventually moistens to the erotic touch, no matter how violent, and the stimulation eventually causes her to have a forcible and shuddering orgasm? And what if this was all recorded and used for blackmail?

MC is for once not a betafaggot, he deserves all the girls.</br>  Why he keeps saying his ability is teleportation when it's really just hyper-speed?  <br>I'd suck a dog off regardless of gender. Still want to try anal from a Dobie or GSD or fuck one.</br>  <br>Because it sounds cooler</br>  So this this show supposed to be super depressing?  <br>You need to do some huge sacrifice to deserves all the girls. If by not being betafaggot which you means all the things he does in episode 1, then he doesn't deserves any of the girls.</br>  <br>Not yet, Maeda will have his dying girl in the snow though</br>  <br> You need to do some huge sacrifice to deserves all the girls. <br>That's not how it seems to work in most anime.<br><br>It's not like there are any good girls in this in the first place. The girl he went out with in the first episode is a boring shit, and Nao a shitty bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Definitely not self-inserting, with the MC good looks, sinister way of thinking, and wicked sense of humor. <br>It will be interesting to see all those girls falls in love with MC for no reason though, just like all those haremshow you watch.</br></br>  <br> you <br> Needing to self-insert into every anime <br><br>It's possible to like characters without self-inserting and just want them all to have good ends.</br></br></br></br>  Pixiv better deliver good porn, like with Nibutani.  <br>Still obsessed with clanAIDS, huh? That shit was years ago and no one important died in Angel Beats or Little Busters, which are more recent works. You can stop pretending Maeda is an edgemaster like butcher or okada.</br>  <br> Nibutani <br> good porn <br>I must be blind, I only saw like 3 good pieces.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Yusa one of the main characters? She didn't do shit this episode.</br>  <br> That's not how it seems to work in most anime <br>Sure, because of that, let's just follow the same logic as those all NON-shitty haremshow you watched. <br><br>Is that what you really expecting from this show? really?<br><br>I know kids in this thread is edgy and self inserting as MC, but blatantly accepting that? Holy shit, man. You must've been a chore to hanging out with.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no one important died in Angel Beats or Little Busters <br>Maeda literally came in and wrote the Saya route, where she dies in the snow, for EX. He's not an edgemaster he just likes dying girls in the snow</br></br>  <br>but everyone died in angel beats</br>  <br>Saya is not important or canon, EX in general is not canon either.</br>  <br>EX has the best route</br>  <br><br>I don't self-insert, I just really enjoy seeing characters like Light and Lelouch. I wish there were more of them in anime and fewer ugly betafaggot harem masters.<br><br>I accept a harem when someone like Light or Lelouch is at the helm</br></br></br></br>  who the fuck is charlotte?  <br>Us</br>  <br>The dog</br>  <br>Why would you personally feel cucked if someone who isn't the MC gets a girl then?</br>  <br>The big sister was better. Why must good girls die?</br>  <br>Because he's MC and the other guy is a betafaggot. How could I self insert into a Lelouch archetype? I've got more in common with the betafaggot</br>  <br>It's KEY, someone has to die</br>  <br>So based on what you said, you enjoy being cucked?</br>  <br>Did somebody mention a dog?</br>  He's gonna feel like a dick when his sister dies.  <br>What if each ED is different. Sung by various members of the cast and LIA.<br><br>Maeda doesn't actually care about writing VNs or anime anymore. He really makes them to market his albums.</br></br></br>  <br> You'll never be a little girl who gets to do lewd things with a big manly dog </br>  <br>It's not like the ED animations are going to eat up any budget, so might as well funnel that into songs instead.</br>  That dog is really  cute .  <br>Someone with some actual since... on /a/?!</br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck?</br></br></br>  <br>Like a dick who is free from her omelet rice.</br>  <br>What if she doesn't die? What if absolutely nothing bad happens to imouto?</br>  This show will have the scientist are going to mind rape imouto, which will probably have some OP ability that is found in 1 out a million users, or is a aberration of the super power gene or whatever. Imouto will be killed and MC will relate to the main girl's suffering and ends Imouto's life.<br><br>Hint: I work for Urobutcher.</br></br>  <br>Retards thinking they can predict a Maeda show are hilarious, especially when they couldnt predict the Angel Beats twist that was even in the title itself.</br>  http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_3#Part_7</wbr></wbr>  <br>His first time.</br>   She had felt he would truly leave for some place she would never be able to reach. <br>I'm afraid, Mikoto, that Touma is already heading to a place where not can reach.</br>  <br><br><br>Seems like a good deal.</br></br></br>  <br> that Touma is already heading to a place where not can reach. <br>What do you mean already? She missed that fucking bus ages ago. Ages ago to Touma, anyway.</br></br>   The stars can be plucked from the sky so easily, so why are you so desperate to reach them? It’s not even remotely logical, but humans are creatures filled with that sort of passion, aren’t they? <br><br>It would seem like Nephthys is saying that Touma is like an unreachable star to Misaka.</br></br>   you will never ride with your Robot waifu to a party   Will Gogeta finally become canon?  Am i the only one that fucking loves dragonball supers OP?  <br>It's pretty great.</br>  <br> Also, why isn't ChiChi in that picture? <br>Is that not Chichi in the wedding dress?</br></br>  <br>it's gohans wedding, that's videl.</br></blockquote>]
