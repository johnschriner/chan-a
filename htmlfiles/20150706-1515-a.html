Okay /a/, time for anime/manga discussion of this series.<br><br><br> Himouto! Umaru-chan <br> Taihei aka Umaru's big brother chapters are more interesting <br> Umaru is a piece of shit girl and Ebina the best <br> one of the few mangas that implies there will be no incestuous relationship <br><br><br>Also, Alex can NTR the fuck out of Umaru from Taihei and I wouldn't give a shit. I'm only here to see the progress of Ebina's breast development</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I take it that nobody likes this series?  <br>I hated it when I read the first couple chapters because of how much of a little shit she is, but the series grew on me, especially with the other characters. I'm still on chapter 64, though, as I've been casually going through it the past couple days.</br>  <br>Don't worry, I hate that shitty spoiled brat of a sister too. I read this manga because the brother is way more interesting.</br>  <br>Kirie best girl.</br>  <br>This, brother and his friends are the only good part of it.</br>  <br><br>Bomber a qt.</br></br>    Is this manga/anime really unpopular on /a/? I don't think there's anyone who's even willing to sub the anime.  <br>There is a thread already </br>   Ebina   <br>Isn't CR doing it?<br><br><br> page 10 <br> this thread already has more than twice the number of posts that thread has </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now shoop that face into Ebina's body.<br><br><br> hello where are the taihei's :DDDDD </br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this series about? She looks like the moefied version of bacterias you found in your teeth</br>  <br>Story is about the daily life of a spoiled sister living in with her 24-year-old brother. Minimal to non-existing character development until about a hundred chapters where shit might just get real.</br>  <br>I've just read few chapters from batoto. So she's essentially like Benio then? Perfect on the outside but useless trash when at home. Is this even a thing in real life?</br>  <br> Is this even a thing in real life? <br><br><br>Unless you're a god damn genius, this is almost fucking impossible to do in real life. You can't make a shut-in introvert to act like an alpha extrovert outside his house.</br></br></br></br>  <br>she's not an introvert she's just lazy and spoiled as fuck</br>  <br>In highscool it is if you're smart and don't have a job, after that no, you have to be consuming your time with productive activities or you'll be a failure.</br>  taihei is the best. I want some oniichan mimikaki   expecting character development from a gag manga <br>What are you doing?<br><br><br><br> mangas <br>And yeah I agree Umaru is a spoiled brat.<br>All the other characters are better, especially Sylphin and Kirie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>on that note was the umaru loli actually a 2D dating sim character that came to life</br>  Brother has an oedipus complex and only takes care of Umaru because of his mother's resemblance. Calling it now.  <br>Why else would he put up with her?</br>  <br> especially Sylphin and Kirie <br>Glad to see someone with refined taste around here.<br><br>On another note, what is up with the latest chapter? Who was that girl at the end? Are we veering into deepest lore territory?</br></br></br></br>  <br>because he's a good brother?</br>  <br>Apparently Boss's imouto according to that other thread</br>  <br> Not daiheis </br>  umaru vs hina whose  worse   <br> especially Sylphin and Kirie. <br>An applause for your great taste.</br></br>  <br>Hina is ok, Umaru is just a spoiled child because muh onii-chan.</br>  <br>hina is spoiled but she gets things through violence</br>  <br><br>There is a josei series about this, I'm inclined to think it happens but not in the exaggerated way it's shown here.</br></br>  Confirmed that Onii-chan taught this girl about stars. Her surname is Kongou so she's boss's imouto.  <br> sylphin and kirie  <br>I need more of them doing cute and akward shit</br></br>  somebody post the pv webms  <br>So does taihei go their everyday?<br>Explains why the nigga is alwaysgets home late.</br></br>  <br> Taihei aka Umaru's big brother chapters are more interesting <br>Agreed. Also Sylpin chapters pls<br>She is a miracle of the universe and not a spoiled ass brat.</br></br></br>  <br>taihei leads a second life being the oniichan of both girls</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127633631 <br>Are you enjoying shitposting on /a/? :D<br>BTW rich girl is the best girl</br></br>  <br>At least she's not Umaru.<br>Also, Anzu best girl.</br></br>  <br>Nah I think it happened in the past when Kongou and Oniichan were still at school. <br>He doesn't seem to remember teaching her though.<br><br>If we get double life oniichan being oniichan it'd be a twist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i don't know how both series are filled with so many best girls</br>   CR or Funi haven't picked it up. <br>It's going to be one of them isn't it.</br>  Oniichan is shit character as MC, better if it was a cute high school girl.  <br>That would be a good thing.</br>  <br>Fight me faggot</br>  <br>I'd be better if neither picked it up.</br>  <br>Man, i would like to know more about her and why she wants the oniichan</br>  <br>because obviously oniichan is the best character</br>  <br> Boss's imouto <br>Really? She looks very similar to Umaru</br></br>  <br>I think it's just a case of sameface, but who knows.</br>  <br><br> one of the few mangas that implies there will be no incestuous relationship <br><br>DROPPED.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are allowed to fuck her</br>  <br> especially Sylphin and Kirie. <br>You're alright, anon<br>Reread the whole thing and Sylphin really warmed up to me(used to prefer Kirie)</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah me too. I used to prefer Kirie but Sylphin made me really warm up to her and love her as the chapters went on</br>  Ebina is breast and best girl. I hope she wins the Taihei    <br> no sign of incestuous relationship at all <br> Alex and Umaru hooking up would still apparently be considered NTR </br></br>  <br>It'd be sibling stealing not NTR.</br>  FUCK<br><br>This is another Eh nandatte all over again.</br></br>  <br> no incestuous relationship <br>The fuck was you reading?<br>Also read the newest release. There's plot incoming  in the next 50 chapters </br></br></br>    <br>Brocons a cute. CUTE.</br>  <br>Why does she always have a 4chan logo in her eyes?</br>  <br>Screen burn.</br>  funposting intensifies  <br> next 50 chapters <br><br><br>Jesus fucking christ. Fujoshit mangas gets picked and scanlated within a week while this manga doesn't?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The chapters are short so are there are a lot of them in a volume. Volume 6 came out on June 19, 2015.</br>  <br>The sister does get better as the series progress. You can tell the early parts were mostly done for the sake of comedic effect. Once most of the characters have been introduced, Umaru gets her character development. She's still spoiled, but not as much, and not to be taken seriously.</br>  <br>Still, she will never be as based as Taihei. How can a big brother be a Gary Stu and a slut magnet at the same time?</br>   no incestuous relationship <br>Dropped</br>  <br> Ebina the best <br><br>You spelled Sylphin wrong</br></br></br>  /a/ only hate Umaru because they remind them of themselves<br><br>lazy fuckers who are a burden to their loved ones</br></br>  <br>She wants to be the center of her brothers world rather than incest. <br>This manga is obviously about platonic sibling relationships and how each pair treats them differently.<br><br>The new character introduced was Kongou's little sister too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirinofags please go</br>  <br>Actually, it's Kirie.</br>  <br>Why are little sisters so shit?<br><br><br>Big brother &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little sister</br></br></br></br>  <br> shitting on Sylphinford <br>Fuck you faggot she's a great imouto.<br><br>Also fuck Norway scans.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah they aren't doing a very good job but its better than nothing i guess</br></br>  <br>Speaking of Norway scans, what's the deal with the word "Norway!" inserted in several pages? What is that actually supposed to mean?</br>  <br><br>I think they are just replacing no way with norway</br></br>  <br>But in plenty of those times, even "no way" would sound awkward, and other words with different connotation would have fit better.</br>  <br><br>Yeah well i don't know what else it could be and that is just what I am interpreting it as</br></br>  <br>Actually, words often don't translate into "no way" (you can look up to the raws), they just constantly try to force their retarded joke on everyone.</br>  <br>Yep, that's what I thought. That, and the "Norwegian krone" bullshit.</br>  Heres hoping the anime is great  <br><br><br><br><br><br>First time that i see that /a/ have wonderful taste</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what people thought about Ore Imo at first as well. I remember people talking about the "platonic sibling relationship" after season 1 and "no way will it be romantic" which are fucking hilarious in hindsight.<br><br>I really wouldn't be surprised if this steers towards incest especially if it's revealed at some point that they aren't blood related.</br></br></br>  <br><br> blood related <br><br>But they aren't?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Taihei thinks Umaru looks like their mother; that suggests to me that they are blood related siblings.</br>  <br><br>So Taihei want to fuck his own mother?</br></br>  <br>Maybe he's the adopted one.</br>  <br>Taihai has shown no indication of wanting to fuck Umaru though, or anyone for that matter  sadly. </br>  <br><br>Poor Ebinas</br></br>  <br> no one is going to appreciate those Ebinas <br>Truly sad</br></br>  <br><br>Or Sylphy's hips</br></br>  Umaru a brat<br>Ebina a slut<br>Kirie a dyke<br>Sylphin a autist</br></br></br>  That chapter where Taihei had to go to a business trip and all Umaru's actions during that entire mini arc says that there's gonna be something that's gonna happen. She was obviously jealous of the other girl. There was also a scene where they went to some statue or some shit that only couples go to. But It's a 4 koma gag manga with very short chapters so I don't really expect that much of a development.  <br> Ebina a slut <br>You take that back</br></br>  <br>Why is this thing cute no matter where it is? God damn it /a/</br>  <br><br> Sylphin a autist <br><br>She is just too genki for her sake</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Truth hurts, right anon?</br></br>  <br> only befriending someone so you can fuck her brother behind her back <br> not a slut </br></br>  <br><br>You mean hamster Umaru?</br></br>  <br>Yo kirie you make me hard</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with being attracted to this stud.<br><br><br>Did she meet him before Umaru?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Getting aroused by a midget plank </br></br>  <br>I want to  brush her hair </br>  <br> tfw no oniichan fo let you be spoiled </br>  <br> That's what people thought about Ore Imo at first <br>You mean what retards thought? The title and premise all pointed toward incest, while this completely does not.<br><br>This is not OreImo. Umaru is not a love interest. Please stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ebina wants to Tahei to be her onii-chan, because her own one left her,  is shame that Ebina Onii.chan wants him too </br></br>  Who's the worst MC of all time?  Sorata was worse.  Not him you fcking faggot.  <br>Only a true faggot would think Saekano's MC wasn't a complete shit cunt.</br>  <br> Angry Tomoyafag </br>  Without a doubt.  <br><br>He was super entertaining.</br></br>  <br>he was a shit and he was unable to do anything productive with that game of his dreams, damn,</br>  <br>WA2's MC was even worse.</br>  <br> he hasn't read the LNs <br><br>See you for Season 2.</br></br></br>  WHO IS HIKARU ICHIJO FOR 1000, ALEX!  <br>OUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOO<br><br>Literally autistic.</br></br></wbr></br>  Your favorite MC.  <br><br>Would you be okay with your waifu getting NTR'd?</br></br>  <br>Sorry I didn't know you were Autistic and could relate to him.</br>  <br>At least he didn't pick that whore Minmay.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>Nope, hell even WA1 <br>was way worse than 2.</br></br>   inb4 Shinji   <br><br>Cuck</br></br>    <br>At least he chose best girl.</br>  Madoka. <br> muh wish <br>For twelve fucking episodes. If it weren't for the lesbians I'd have never put up with this crap.</br></br>  <br>more like she chose him</br>  <br>Yukimura 4ever</br>  I only ever dropped one anime because of an MC.    <br> I wish all the magical girls were no longer magical girls! <br>Dokes would have been a perfect 10 if not for Shityaka and this.</br></br>  <br>Madoka becoming a magical girl on the last episode, instead of the first, was kinda the point.</br>    <br>Yes I also thought Lelouch was an unbearable edge-tart</br>  <br>Is this why there are so many shit MCs in anime? Are they trying to recreate Shinji? Shinji only works because of his glorious harem.</br>  <br>WTF</br>  <br>I know what the point was. It still sucks.</br>  Mashiro from Nyaruko-san<br><br> Have two hot otherwordly horrors all over your dick <br> HIT THEM when they try to fuck you <br><br>Best girl won in the end though so whatever</br></br></br></br></br>   assblasted Utaha/Eriri fags   <br>The fact that you wouldn't do the same to two terrible frenchmen shows how much of a fag you are.</br>  <br><br>Let them vent, they got BTFO in yesterday's thread.</br></br>  <br> s </br>  <br>Shinji was only unbearable in the beginning.</br>  <br> Best girl won <br>The only way she could have won would be having her get over that faggot and finding someone else.</br></br>  <br>I'm a Megumifag and he sucks dongs. I feel so sad that Megumi's going to get with that loser soon.</br>   the MC sucks so my favorite girl losing is actually winning! <br><br>My favorite loser argument.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad this is the very first post in this thread, good job.<br><br><br> WTF <br>Anon, we talked about this.</br></br></br></br></br>  That annoying fag from Tenjou Tenge.<br><br>God, I hated the series because him.</br></br>  It's like they're sabotaging the project on purpose so it bombs and they can keep shitting out more Fate garbage.  Tamamo will always win  <br>You solved the puzzle. Nasu doesn't really give a shit about the remake, he just wants to get it over with so he can get back to what he really cares about.</br>  <br>Oh, please. If that were the case, it wouldn't need all these redesigns and new routes.</br>  <br>I'm a huge Arc fan and I'm ok with Arc's redesign. She looks so slim without her long skirt, and she has a cuter air to her, if possible.</br>  What went  right?   <br>improved 1000%</br>  <br>Who's this girl? She's very cute.</br>  <br>Lurk the fuck more.</br>  <br>I've gotten past Arc's redesign. I've come to terms with Ciel's redesign. I even like Akiha's redesign.<br><br>But the one thing I will not forgive are Shiki's stupid fucking glasses.</br></br></br>   I like the new Arc better   That outfit is fucking awful.  <br>Arcueid Brunestud from Tsukihmie</br>  <br>It would if he wanted to shatter the dreams of Tsukihime fans and make it so that they never want him to do something like this again.</br>  <br> miniskirt <br>why</br></br>  <br>Arcade Bumstead.</br>  <br>why would a 1000 year old combat-specialized vampire lord wear a miniskirt? It makes no sense.</br>  <br>Because it's sexier than the old granny skirt she had.</br>  <br>I don´t see the problem</br>  <br>It makes more sense than King Arthur wearing full plate armor. Why does it need to make sense?</br>  <br>I want to  marry  Arcueid !</br>  <br>Easier movility. Now Arc can effectively kick her enemies without worrying about her long skirt getting in the way.</br>  <br>It makes perfect sense. She is a woman and all women want to look cute.</br>  don't be blinded by those rose tinted glasses  How are they going to sabotage it? By making it good?  It's okay because Hisui is cute.  Identify this character  <br>Ciel  with shitty hair. </br>  Looking good  I like the new characters but I'd rather see them work on the actual Tsukihime remake instead of this original shit.  <br><br>I actually prefer this hair for her even i its a clichee "girl with glasses" hair.<br><br>But it makes my dick diamonds. But I know well never get official h-scenes anymore. And then I get sad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Complaining about an outfit not making sense <br> In a fictional work <br><br>Jesus this is top tier autism.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is looking less like a cunt than she did in the original.

That was the problem. She was more of a Bro than a Waifu.

Ruined Futabu for me.</br></br>  <br>What? <br>No, she was just takin' a piss when they got stolen by a goblin so she stayed pissed the rest of the episode.

From my rough trace, it looks like Hibiki's roight leg transfroms into a 3rd scarf.  <br>So delayed you probably can't call it a simulcast, since they say it's going to happen "after summer".</br>  <br>But summer ends on september 21st.</br>  <br><br>She's toast</br></br>  <br>Has to be her leg right?</br>  So close  <br>You guys should calm down 20+ hours with constant symphogear threads one after another is just asking for trouble.</br>  <br>It was the same past season, I dont see the problem</br>  <br>*30</br>  <br>I don't want her to die.

The JSDF is one of the best equipped armed forces in the world that rival many actual militaries. Their new Izumo class helicopter carriers can accomodate F-35b's but Japan has been very hush hush about it because they're treading a thin line between self defense force and a military with force projection.</br></br></br>  <br><br> GATE: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri <br><br> The military fantasy series begins when a gate appears in Tokyo's Ginza district sometime in the 21st century. From the gate pours out monsters, knights from middle-age Europe, and other fantasy-like beings, and they kill many of the citizens of Tokyo. This event is known as the Ginza Incident. <br><br> The government sends a small group of soldiers from the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (a replacement for Japan's military) to the alternate world beyond the gate. Led by otaku soldier Youji, they find that the villages in the world are being attacked by a dragon. An elf girl who is a survivor from the dragon's rampage joins the group in their travels across the dangerous new world. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boku Art Online</br>  <br> this new </br>  <br><br>That's right, Oni-san<br><br>Nippon's army is truly the strongest.

Like i'm getting real good vibes because it's not virtual bullshit<br><br>Of course /a/ will funpost it like every anime every season but I like funposting too so it's okay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't, you just have shit taste and also prove it by using the elf meme</br>  <br>Wrong. The Roman knights flood the streets and killed a bunch of civilians when they first come out, but as soon as they organize a counter-attack they fucking slaughter the fools.</br>  <br>it happened in middle of the city. military generally aren't ready to react to that. as bases are usually built far away</br>  <br>More like the author needed to invent an enemy with ~2 millennia worth of technological handicap so the Japs could win against something.</br>  the show later turns in self insert otaku bait like sao ? becasue i liked the concep of the first episode  Bait: Thus the anions fought there.  <br>just try some chapters of the manga and you will get what is this about.</br>  <br>No. The Gate magna is way different. It's not even that much of a harem, if it is one at all.<br><br>Goth loli is over a hundred years old and is about to "ascend". Sorcerer and him are not the least bit romantically involved. <br><br>I can kinda forgive the lack of gore and violence seeing how the first battle is more less skimmed over in the first chapter, but if they take it out all together, I'll be upset. Same if they censor the nudity, slavery aspect, and not bring up the corruption.<br><br>Other then that, I can't wait for them to bring out the fire sticks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the sluttier look the anime gave her more.</br>   pig enemies <br>By themselves</br>  <br>It matches how slutty she is in the manga, I like it too.</br>  <br>Harem?</br>  <br>Kinda. Only one of them wants to fuck him, the others are filling the roles of daughterus and/or war buddies.</br>  <br>Which one is the romantic pair. The blonde girl?</br>  <br>The goth loli. The elf kinda has a daughteru thing going.</br>   AX2015 <br> Q/A at A-1 panel <br> guy asks President and Producer if this was JSDF recruitment propoganda <br><br>which one of you fucks was this</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean she's fucking retarded and calls his dad because she's wrong in the head?<br><br>And she wants to fuck him now, the dark elf too.<br>Oh the mage also wants dick, she gets jealous when rory is alone with him</br></br></br></br>  <br> You mean she's fucking retarded and calls his dad because she's wrong in the head? <br>She got better, now she just calls him father because she got used to it.</br></br>  <br>No. It's like Apocalypse Now but with YAMATO DAMASHII instead of FREEDOM.</br>  <br>This is why I can't take all the people whining about the "nippon stronk" vibes seriously.</br>  Do they comment in the LN about how similar everything is to stuff in Earth's history?  <br><br>How the fuck is that possible to pull off?<br><br><br> my favorite anime is Evangelion <br>Huh, never thought of that. I'll keep that in mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you are confusing Japan with France</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>All of these, Don't watch it, its like that dungeon girls show from last season cept with more asshole dirtbags and rapists males with MC being the only decent guy around, even tho he's a fucking 30 plus year old virgin.</br></br></br></br></br>   One day in the 21st century, a gate opened in the middle of the Ginza district of Tokyo. Out of the gate poured soldiers and strange creatures, and they soon made Ginza look like an image of hell. The gate apparently connected Japan to another world, a world with a militant empire and many supernatural creatures. The Japanese Self-Defense Force decided to send a small group, led by a soldier who's also an otaku, into the other world on a reconnaissance mission. They're meant to learn what they can about the empire (and its plans), the world, and the people. <br><br> They're hardly in the world yet, though, when they come across a village destroyed by a giant fire-breathing dragon. The only survivor is an unconscious elven girl they find hidden in a well. Now they feel like they must warn the nearby towns about the dragon, and do what they can to help. On the way, they'll meet more magical, female companions, and learn more about this dangerous new world. <br><br> also an otaku </br></br></br></br>   tfw   you enjoyed the first episode of Gate despite its flaws and look forward to future episodes   <br>ebin meme right there.</br>  sure is /pol/ in here. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to enjoy the show alone and avoid the threads. Elf girl is best girl until a dark elf turns up.  <br>There's a dark elf you'll like if you're into literal whores</br>  How come dark elves are always slutty massive whores?<br><br>How did this become a thing? When was the unanimous vote for this?</br></br>  <br>Why does an elf wearing jeans up the hotness by like 100?</br>  it seems MC has no problems with fucking the girls from his team, he has considered multiple times in his head when others imply he has already done it.  <br> 2D elves are usually like this <br>Only because Japan forces their gyaru shit logic on everything</br></br>  <br>No<br>Also No.<br><br> Episode 1 literally chapter 1 <br><br>How will it ever last when "nothing happens", the first episode?

This is like showing a US Military briefing and cutting the US flag because a bunch of mudslimes bitch. Why can't China and Korea just fuck off with their butthurt.</br>  <br>It was clearly cropped that way by whoever took the screencap and made the image. Unless the streaming site is so stupid they even cut off their own watermark.</br>  <br>CR did.</br>  <br>But there is US Army in this series<br>You can tell because the only country with black men among their agents is America</br></br>  <br>The elf is well feed from additional protein.</br>  <br> Russia <br> China <br>Black agents</br></br></br>  <br>Because the only countries in the world are America, Russia, China, and Japan right?</br>  http://blog.livedoor.jp/kaigai_no/a<wbr>rchives/45416875.html<br> 以下、AS、MAL、Reddit、4chan、YTより引用。(CRで<wbr>公式配信中です。) </wbr> <br> not translating the shitstorms <br>What a waste.</br></br></br></wbr>  So...are we going to be seeing this in the anime?  <br>why the heck would minor powers be meddling</br>  <br> But there is US Army in this series <br>Incorrect, the only US forces shown in the series were CIA SAD Operators</br></br>  <br>Why would any other country try anything? They're the big ones.</br>  <br>I say US army, not BLACK ops</br>  <br> You can tell because the only country with black men among their agents is America <br>Yes, it may be Uganda or Nigeria, kek</br></br>  <br>Nope, CR actually cut the JSDF flag from the scene, you can see it your self. 18:31 mark on HS, 18:41 mark on the Ohys raws.</br>  <br> Watch episode 1 for the waifus <br> like 10 seconds worth of waifus <br><br>T-thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uganda or Nigeria <br> implying   they're expert enough to train some niggers to be a professional black ops </br></br>  <br><br>GB and France would meddle for sure.<br>And so would the jews, they meddle in everything.</br></br></br>  <br> the only US forces shown in the series were CIA SAD Operators <br><br>I don't mind the YAMATO DAMASHII but this fact is the one thing that makes the series full retard. Omitting the US military presence in Japan is more retarded than the premise of a magic gate to the elf-loli dimension.</br></br></br>  <br> And so would the jews <br>But America was already there</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish.<br>We knew the threads would be like that but it's getting awful.</br></br>  <br>Yes, comparing everything you don't like to something everyone shits on, has been around since forever.</br>  <br>Name? Sounds cool</br>  <br>Come on, I like story like this when the superior modern forces crush the inferior one. Then, you spout your cynical bullshit.<br>Holy shit, this is the first time I'm on this anime's thread, it really reeks of /pol/, huh.</br></br>  <br>Confirmed, new screenshot without streamshit.<br>Anybody want to take up the mantle of muxing CR subs onto Japanese raws?</br></br>  <br>What the fuck. CR isn't even streaming that show in regions offended by that flag.</br>  <br>#HeritageNotHate</br>  <br>So did the studio do this to the version they sent to CR because of the confederate flag drama or did CR do it themselves?</br>  <br>you could just download the subtitle file from somewhere.<br>thats what i did.</br></br>  <br> implying Japan even heard about the confederate bullshit happening </br>  <br>Nobody cares about the confederate flag thing outside the USA</br>  <br> confederate flag drama <br><br>It's not like that particular Japanese flag design carries particular weight with it, no sir.</br></br></br>  <br><br>More than likely they were just being extra cautious to avoid butthurt koreans and chinks in the US and Vancouver from bitching about it.<br><br><br>I'm not bothered enough by it to go through the hassle. It's still silly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If find it quite amusing that you can't wave a confederate flag in some state but a nazi flag is totally ok.<br> Not that I'm complaining </br></br>  <br>I was just gonna say, 5000 hours in GIMP</br>  <br>I don't know koreans hate Japan</br>  <br>You can still wave the Confederate flag around anywhere in America, just like the Swastika, or the Hammer and Sickle, it's you're right under the Constitution as a free citizen. The problem was that it was being flown over state government buildings by said state government, which is a problem for all sorts of reasons.</br>  <br>You didn't go to school?</br>  <br>Take the stars out, and then more people will be offended.</br>  <br> which is a problem for all sorts of reasons. <br>but its actually not.</br></br>  <br> Invaded and conquered by Japan for almost 50 years <br> During which the Japanese tried to erase their culture and committed a number of atrocities <br>Pick up a history book once in a while anon.<br><br> That said most Koreans you meet don't actually hate Japs, but there are a good number that do, and larger number that will bitch about anything that might be associated with the Japanese Empire during the 20th century. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's possibly the studio doing it.</br>  <br>My country did the same to most of Europe, yet no one is butthurt.<br>Fucking Koreans.</br></br>  <br>It is, aside from the fact that it represents slavery, oppression, and bigotry to a large amount of the population, there's also the fact that technically it can be considered a flag of rebellion against the US government as well as the flag of a foreign nation. Government buildings should not be permitted to fly it.</br>  <br> She had her chance, she choose revenge instead. She could have walked away, she did not. <br>Any chance it becomes different here in the anime? Lots of characters get to live even with the gravest of sins.</br></br>  <br>Are you a Mongol or Roman.</br>  <br>Why did they replace the JSDF flag with the French flag?</br>  <br> white flags <br>My sides.</br></br>  <br>Shut up Germany, you banned your one of your own fucking flags and an entire political ideology because everyone was so butthurt about it, and if you think Russians, and most other eastern euros aren't still mad about it you're deluding yourself.</br>  <br>Nah, it's Japan's equivalent of an American war movie.<br><br>Wanking over how cool we are and how we're totally better than everyone else and those guys are just nerds and wimps and jealous.</br></br></br>  <br>That's nothing compared to this one country. They bombed two of their cities and won the war. Yet they bitch about a chinese cartoon where they lose badly.</br>  <br>So they're french on the CR version.</br>  <br>Is there a Bait image of this yet</br>  <br>Don't poke the Germans about WW2, you know they can't respond without getting arrested for thought crimes.</br>  <br> Napoleonic Europe, but everyone forgot about it already </br>  <br>Everything pre-TV and Radio no one gives a shit about.<br><br>And really Nappy didn't go around committing genocide  unless it was his own troops </br></br></br>  <br> Invaded and conquered by Japan for almost 50 years <br><br>See, this here is the misconception that so many people see to have, and many S.Koreans seem to believe. <br><br>This NEVER happened. Japan invaded China and took over Manchuria, yes. But they did not take over Korea by force ever. <br><br>Korea was a vassal state to the Chinese, which Japan was in conflict with. The Japanese recognized Korea as a sovereign state, and convinced them to join their side and secede from China. <br>Japan fought China off to keep Korea independent, while plotting to convert them into THEIR vassal state. <br><br>So there you have it. I'm not saying Japan didn't have nefarious reasons for splitting Korea off from China, but "invaded and conquered" is a blatant lie. Historical bullshit that never actually happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This was probably aimed at the Murican audience because of all the butthurt the announcement got.</br>  <br> I like the sluttier look the anime gave her more. <br>I also like her adult slutty voice. She is suppose to orgasm when she kills people, I would look forward to her moans.</br></br>  Tyuule got her husbando, why did she have to die. Happy monster woman should be happy with husbandos<br>;_;</br>  <br> Everything pre-TV and Radio no one gives a shit about <br>Some latinos still butthurt about my country.<br> muh genocide <br> muh gold </br></br></br></br>  <br> JSDF melon tits chick &gt; Goth loli &gt; Mage Slut &gt; Elf. <br>fixed.</br></br>  <br>Wait who's the husbando?</br>  <br>Is that the bunny queen or the waitress</br>  Best waifu, move along untermensch  <br> How come dark elves are always slutty massive whores? <br><br> How did this become a thing? When was the unanimous vote for this? <br><br>They are meant to be the opposite of woodelves. There are diverse fetishes out there, wood elves aren't enough to please everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bunny Queen.<br><br> Apparently the waitress got together with the guy she tried to kill, and ended up together with him in Japan. <br>So says the novelfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it seems MC has no problems with fucking the girls from his team, he has considered multiple times in his head when others imply he has already done it. <br>That's because he is divorced and know what a vagina looks like. He just doesn't want the hassle.</br></br>  <br>She had the choice to run away  with her love Furuta, but she chose to pursue her life-long revenge instead. <br>This decision cost her life. </br> <br><br>It was sad because she just found love for the first time, was acting like a little girl from this new-found feelings, but it was too late for her.</br></br></br>  <br>hmm... i like the manga art more.</br>  <br> Not reading the /ak/ scans <br><br> Elf girl thinks the MC is her dad because she can't get over the fact that her pops is dead.  <br> The United States and China actively try to fuck things up when they return for R&amp;R.  <br> The MC is still friends with his ex-wife, who writes dojiuns. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bunny queen getting raped by duckbill prince right now.</br>  <br>Hope we get to see more of her in the manga.</br>  <br>Then who is the husbando? The prince? I know he ended falling in love with her, but he deserved to die.</br>  <br>All the stuff you're talking about is pre-1910, after the annexation treaty in 1910, Korea officially became part of Japan after which it was subject to military occupation and colonization. It may not have been a hard invasion with pitched battles, but it was an invasion.</br>  <br> /ak/ scans <br> horrible scans <br> horrible editing <br> horrible grammar </br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean high elves, typically. Wood elves are usually portrayed as brash and violent.</br>  <br>A colonization of an already puppet state is not invasion, anon. <br>I'm not saying it's any better, but the choice of words are completely wrong.</br></br>  <br>Considering that the other scans were even worse, beggars couldn't be choosers.</br>  <br> virgin <br>he's divorced anon.</br></br>  <br>No, fuck no. Not the prince. It was a JSDF.</br>  <br>The chef. Furuta. <br>The one that is now a spy at the Prince's kitchen.</br></br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br><br>Fuck, I forgot about him. I think I should read the manga again now that the series started.</br></br>  <br>Depends on how much you want to argue semantics, lots of people consider a colonization backed by military force of arms an invasion, just ask the Native Americans.</br>  <br>Not the same at all. Native Americans were slaughtered by the white men. <br>Japanese did NOT slaughter Koreans. Ever. <br><br>Treated like shit? Yes. Like a second hand citizens? Yes. Tried to educate them to become Japanese? Yes. <br>Slaughtered? No. Not even a choice of semantics, it simply did not happen. <br><br>They slaughtered the Chinese. Not the Koreans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then again, the swastika flag technically wouldn't even count as one of our flags, considering the country was basically re-founded with east and west germany being a thing for quite some time before being reunited.<br><br> And Stalin killed more of his own people than Hitler killed throughout the war, if anything they should be pissed about themself first and foremost. </br></br></br>    <br><br>And me!</br></br>  <br><br> mangafox </br></br>  <br>Amen.</br>  <br>Quads speak the truth</br>  <br>This is the part where i knew rori was going to be the worst fucking character in the manga<br> effortless beats not one, not two, but 3 fucking special forces groups like they were a bunch of boy scouts with pea shooters <br> not to mention the JSDF effortless fuck up American SF with that japan stronk shit </br></br></br>  I just wanted all bunny girls to be happy.  <br>She wouldn't be able to do shit against those who knew what to do? Spec ops were too close in range for her</br>  <br>She's a demi-goddess, what did you expect.<br><br><br>I just all the monstergirls to be happy</br></br></br></br>  <br> Stalin killed more of his own people than Hitler killed throughout the war <br>This is a myth that was spread as a part of information warfare during Cold War. It kinda stuck because US won.<br>Now, Mao did kill more chinks than nips did in Nanking.</br></br></br>  <br>Me too.</br>  Basically, <br><br> <br>Tyuule plots to antagonize Empire so Japan will get finally get their ass off the couch and hit them hard, as her goal is to bring end to the Empire. <br><br>But she gets very close with Furuta, the Chef. She even learns of him being a spy (he's pretty much incapable of lying, a horrible choice to send in as a spy) but keeps it a secret. She finds herself more and more attracted to her, and acts like a young girl in love for the first time around him. <br>Furuta also finds her attractive, and wishes her to come with him to Japan and open a restaurant together. <br><br>Ultimately her vengeance gets better of her, and rejects Fufuta's offer, and chooses to see her plan to the end. <br>The Prince finds out about her schemes at one point, beats her and rapes her, but doesn't kill her. He really can't bring himself to kill her, but as he faces ultimate defeat in the end of the conflict, she finds the chance to finally kill the prince. <br><br>She is successful, but he kills her as well. <br>As she dies, she hallucinates that Furuta, her true love, has come to take her away. <br><br>Fututa escapes to Japan as the Gate closes, and hires Deliah (the bunny girl waitress who is now Yanagida's waifu) as his waitress instead. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br>Triple dubs says it all</br>  <br>So you expect the special forces to just shoot a random goth loli holding an axe? They'd be confused as fuck m8, then that'd lead to the other people getting confused as fuck because of the radio chatter.</br>  <br>It didn't have to end like this.</br>  <br>what's wrong about it anon? you must be american hence you feel offended somehow.<br><br>You forgot to mention how Rori was actually hit several times but IS a demigod.<br><br>While I do agree it was farfetched how Japan took care of the americans, you have to realize that, the japanese knew someone would pull off something like that, also, they are at the home turf so they have the advantage, and third, the americans themselves said that the missions was thrown in too quickly and they didn't have proper intel.<br><br><br>did you forget she is a demigod? she should have been dead, but survived due to her status</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That logic is retarded. The soldiers shot her full of holes, she just didn't give a fuck because she's an immortal superhuman. Itami even walks in on her while she's showering and sees her body regenerating.</br></br>    <br>FUUUUCCCKKK</br>  <br> infuriated that a 950+ year old demigod took on your HOMEBOYS WITH GUNS and owned them <br> being this butthurt  <br><br>OOH SAY CAN YOU SEEEEEEE</br></br></br></br>  WHERE'S THE NEXT CHAPTER GODDAMN IT  <br> what did you expect <br>Oh idk, for some fucking modern day warriors to turn that little loli slut into swiss cheese. Theres no way all those years of intense training would make them that incompetent. Not to mention SOCOM wouldnt sent out any teams without proper intel on their enemy. Those guys in the manga basically went in blind.</br></br>  <br>RETCON WHERE!?!?!?</br>  <br>Damn, that's rough.</br>  <br>Exactly. There's no better scouts than the one rolling in armor.</br>  <br>SHE'S A BLOODY DEMIGOD</br>  <br><br>You have to take her out with something other than mere bullets. Explosives, stun her with flash grenades. She's too used to bullet tier pain.</br></br>  <br>holy shit you are a faggot</br>  <br>Cry more murrican</br>  <br> Gate closes <br>What's the point of joining JSDF if there are no more monster girls?</br></br>  <br>She can't die you fucking wanker bullets do nothing</br>  <br>This needs retconning</br>  <br>Can she survive  hugs? </br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>what about britain?</br>  <br>Bring her back with you. That's what some guys did.</br>  <br> One of the girls gets the ability to open the gate though it takes 4 years to find the same world again. </br>  <br>To busy dealing with muslims in there yards</br>  <br>Civil war raging through Europe, most likely.</br>  <br>There's was only one true american in that group, the one that was worried about his dead bros. There we're following orders but they deserve what they got. <br><br>I mourn for the Ruskies though.</br></br></br>    <br>i didn't know that ukrainians and/or canadians browsed /a/</br>  <br>in during pedos defending their shitty pedobait character</br>  <br><br><br>What do you think would happen if someone cut Rori's head off? Would she die then? Or would she grow another one to replace it? Or would her head keep talking while her body wanders around aimlessly trying to reattach it?</br></br></br>  They handled that last scene like shit<br><br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Eal<wbr>4fep7pK4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>She explains that any lost body part would eventually come back to her.</br>  <br>but they replaced the rising sun with your flag in </br>    <br>she has to be put back together.<br>i dont think they have mentioned what happens if you completely destroy a body part though.</br></br>  <br>What if that body part is destroyed?</br>  <br>lmao 10/10 upvoted.</br>    Prince Zorzal is responsible for: <br><br> <br>- Genocide of the Bunny girls whom he slaughtered and enslvaed as sex slaves<br>- Decieved Tyuule that he will save her people if she becomes his slave, but doesn't keep his promise<br>- Raped and enslaved Noriko, a Japanese civilian<br>- Abuses his sex slaves, bloodying them daily, dragging them in chains, etc<br>- Revoltes and takes over the Empire<br>- Sends in men to disguise themselves as JSDF and pillage and rape villages<br>- Sends in shapeshifitng monsters disguised as children to ambush JSDF from inside, killing many refugees and children in the process<br>- Have his inquisitors torture and kill nobilities involved in the peace treaty<br>- The above leads to murder of Sherry's parents, and orders his men to kill the girl as well<br>- Sends assassins to kill his own sister, in the process killing seveal named characters (Pina's girls)<br>- Kills Tyuule<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Not sure I forgot anything, I probably did. <br>Like I said in the previous thread, this guy is basically Joffery Baratheon of this series. <br>You know, "that guy" that everyone hates with passion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The surrender meme is my favorite meme of all time above pepe and doge</br>  <br>Why is everything in this story so fucking depressing?</br>  <br> This is a myth that was spread as a part of information warfare during Cold War. <br>Depends on whether you count the Holodomor and whether or not you trust the declassified Soviet document to have accurately recorded the numbers ( I really don't know why you would though), you can reasonably push Stalins number up to around the 20 million mark, while Hitler it's hard to push his numbers past 12 million.</br></br>  <br>Because war, war never changes.</br>  <br>You have me at genocide</br>  <br>War, war <br>SHIT<br>uh, War is hell</br></br></br>  <br>You're describing most of /a/.<br>It should be even easier for self insertion now.</br></br>  <br>To be honest this only makes me angry because she's a bunny girl, if she were human I wouldn't care that much.</br>  <br>Bullshit, war HAS changed.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=C2P<wbr>t-LnQ2po</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Shame. she has the best design out of the CVs.  <br> Katsuragi <br> best CV design </br></br>  <br>Daijoubu</br>  <br> Katsuragi <br> best CV design </br></br>  <br> And then I said, the Reppou would tickle down </br>  <br>Reppuu</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51211348</wbr></br>    <br>Reminds me on Heidi.</br>  The fad is dying.  <br>Are they stupid?</br>  Dayum!<br><br>Can't wait for the full picture.</br></br>  Shibafu is love, Shibafu is life.  <br>Everyone tires to copy the superior Shibafu style.

The starters aren't that much better than each other anyway. It makes sense for new players to just pick the one they like the most.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure we don't have that many Inazumafags here. I'm not denying that most people choose by the look. I clearly said "most of us", as in /a/, though.</br>  <br>If kissing counts as bullying, then yes.</br>   <br><br>Rape</br></br>  Delicious upgrade  <br>Voice?<br>Personality?<br> Statfagging? <br> Reading Wiki before choosing? <br> Going here? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm pretty sure we don't have that many Inazumafags here. <br>I've seen enough ID ship lists here to believe otherwise.</br></br>  <br> hoppo cosplaying a better abyssal </br>  <br>Don't forget the anime.</br>  <br>A lot of people here started with Inazuma, what are you talking about?<br>Her art isn't even that impressive compared to the other starters. I just thought she was cute.</br></br>  <br>What anime?</br>  <br>I'm sure people take that into account but whatever design they like the most is probably the deciding factor.</br>  <br>Didn't Gook said most of us are Kagafags or something?<br><br><br>Didn't someone bitch how you can't have Yuudachi as starter?<br><br><br>You totally misunderstood me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> believing the gook </br>  <br>Oh you!</br>  <br>And what's a shame about that, OP?</br>  <br>Why would you pay attention to anything that faggot says? He's more like a secondary than anything else.</br>  What does it mean?  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  Spyro please, go underground if you have to.

If Spyro gives up this easily it just means that Iroha end is highly likely.<br><br> Spyro's not depressed, they said </br></br></br>  Paper in my pocket, hoes on my team.  <br>Yui has orange hair, Yukino has black hair. <br>8man doesn't drink orange juice.<br>He likes his coffee black= Yukino's hair. <br><br>Yuifags btfo once again</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the delay until 2016 despite work having already started probably means they're waiting so that they can release a volume every few months</br>  <br>THIS<br>Pastebin translations/the archives/here are the best options.</br></br>  <br>cumpai!</br>  <br> Yui has orange hair <br><br>You fucking wot</br></br></br>  Please no more.

Why can't you just post the translations on /a/?</br></br>  <br><br>Sure. Make a petition to Yen saying "Please stop trying to make money off Oregairu". We'll see how it goes.</br></br>  <br>Why not jump on to reddit's subreddit for yahari (not talking about fucking /r/anime) and translate it from there. Mods there seem like ok guys.<br><br>obviously &gt;reddit it has a comment section and is rather more accessable. Cease &amp; desist 's wont matter there.</br></br></br>  It will never be as fun as before.<br><br>I'm just wasting my time here.</br></br>  The next Yahari thread will die before the bump limit.  Yo Ho, all together,<br>Hoist the replies high<br>Heave Ho, cunts and killers<br>Never shall we die.</br></br></br>  <br>Yen Press releases 4 volumes per year, one every 3 months for all their licenses and it doesn't seem like they will be increasing pace any time soon. I'd prefer it one every 2 months so 6 volumes per year. <br><br>They probably want to pace themselves so they don't catch up too quickly and become stuck with no consistent releases throughout the year. As authors releases like 2 volumes max per year in Japan. <br><br>So:<br> 2017 to get to volume 4 <br> 2018 to get to volume 8 <br> 2019 to get to volume 12 <br><br>Though within 4 years you can easily learn enough nippon to read anything you like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should have began the thread with the announcement of Yen Press license for Oregairu.</br>  <br> Yen Press releases 4 volumes per year <br><br>This applies to manga too right?</br></br></br>  The Yen Press release is only step one.<br>How long until we get an English dub?</br>  <br> Cease &amp; desist 's wont matter there. <br>It does, if reddit admins receive C&amp;D they will warn you and or shut down your sub if you don't comply. It's in their ToS.</br></br>  <br> They probably want to pace themselves so they don't catch up too quickly and become stuck with no consistent releases throughout the year. <br>Then Yen Press should take into consideration adapting the .5 volumes, also.</br></br>  <br>But it does look like puke.</br>  <br>Yes, sometimes it even 5 volumes per year for them.</br>  <br>What news? haven't visited Yahari threads for few days.</br>  <br>Yen Press is killing yahari</br>  Good Irohasu~, everyone!  <br>LN got licensed, Sypro will receive C&amp;D from Yen Press if he keeps his translations up into next year, if he doesn't comply Yen Press will shut his site down. They can do this and did this to DanMachi translator when he wouldn't give in.<br><br>So Spyro will now have to remove his translations off the blog eventually and go underground or we are stuck until 2019 to be able to read the rest of the story.<br><br>Not to mention Yen Press is going to localise Iroha's "Senpai's" and other horrifics to Mr/Miss/Mister/Mrs.<br><br>It's a sad day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally look at the last thread, it hasn't even died yet</br>  <br>Yukino's dependency issues and the club is not being genuine. They know there is a love triangle and they are too scared to confront it.</br>  <br> for few days <br><br>so close</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why not upload pdfs on nyaa?</br></br>  <br> I can earnestly type that we may not get to volume five. <br>Nah they'll keep going with this one, Yahari will sell well for them considering how well known the franchise is now amongst the community.</br></br>  <br>even when it's links to pastebins? still it might pass under the radar.<br><br>Or actually just fuck everything. I don't want to lose hope.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope ISIS will behead them.</br>  <br>There are various ways for translations to continue such as you've suggested, SAO's translation still continues to this day. It all depends on whether Spyro is willing to go underground or not, and so far he's just left a vague statement.</br>   spyro feeling down because his ship is going to sunk <br> anime says fuck you, buy the LN, leaving us in a cliffhanger. <br> watari is a hack writer, more drama, more waifu wars. <br> then jew press strike again; volume 11 in next decade, volume 12 will be history. <br> yahari fan translation is dead <br> tfw its raining outside, just like my tears falling down in my eyes. <br><br>FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK<br>Being a NEET in a third world shithole is suffering.<br>Thank you americunts for ruining anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fansubs are all underground, I don't see what's the big deal. It's not like he's translating for the e-peen right?</br></br>  <br>moderators<br> When you receive notice that there is content that violates this user agreement on subreddits you moderate, you agree to remove it. <br>If Yen Press report it then they'll have to remove it. If they don't then it'll be fine, but Reddit threads quickly turn up on Google so doubt it'll go under the radar for long considering how on edge YP is about their stuff.</br></br></br>  <br> I still haven't read the fucking LN <br>Fuuuuuuuuuck</br></br>  <br> &gt;spyro feeling down because his ship is going to sunk <br>he's quitting because you guys kept saying this<br> fuck this gay earth spyro-sama don't leave us like this </br></br></br>  Spyro can just go dark, randomly show up with a pdf/epub of Vol 11, and go back into hiding. <br><br>Rinse/Repeat for Vol 12/13</br></br>  Whoa whoa whoa I've missed a lot. <br><br>So is Spyro quitting the translating?</br></br>  <br>;(<br><br>Spyro was cool.</br></br></br>  <br>Differences is that CR/Funi don't send out C&amp;D's and DMCA's like their life depends on it. They so far haven't gone out of their way to shut fansub groups and their websites down, however Yen Press will do this.<br>CR/Funi is even aware that HS steals from them and don't really do anything about it.</br></br>  <br>you could try learning jap<br><br>it's not hard</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/89<wbr>du4zd7n3hny/Oregairu<br>Quick.</br></wbr></br>  Here's where I draw the line.<br>Between this and being practically stuck with nothing but CR and Funi this season, I've lost it.<br><br>I'm learning Japanese.<br>Starting tomorrow.</br></br></br></br>  What did Haruno mean here? Also why was Yukino looking at Hikki?  <br><br><br>Yeah gonna start learning. maybe when Vol 12 comes out I can parse basic sentences when I get ahold of a copy</br></br></br>  Fuck jew press  <br>Yukino looked to 8man for help but 8man couldn't do anything and Haruno emphasized that</br>  <br> tfw I have japanese language manuals for dummies <br> tfw losing motivation to learn because of moonrunes. </br></br>  <br>Japan is weird, they literally treat every small difference in a product as individual licenses. This is why Yen Press doesn't always do digital releases since that's another set of red tape. Also why New Testament translations can carry on hassle free despite YP picking up the series.<br><br>The .5 are most require their own licenses as well which I don't think they got so I doubt they will be releasing them.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino wanted Hikki help, Haruno said no, Yukimom invites Hikki to the party, he sees what she actually means and fucks off.</br>  Pretty much everything that YP has licensed ends up getting underground fan translations anyway. I panic every time this happens, and I'm just not going to do it this time. I'm sure Spyro or someone else will keep underground translations going here.  <br>Yukino-chan wanted to have sex in public, but as an upstanding citizen and lady of high class, Haruno intervened.</br>  <br>Just visit the /djt/ learn your kana first before you start jumping into any books whatsoever. You have 4 years, you have more than enough time.</br>  <br><br> tripfags now rearing their ugly threads <br>Well that explains why these threads have always been so shit.</br></br></br>  <br>No way was Yukino going to lose her virginity before her.</br>  <br>Mahouka isn't going underground anon, DanMachi translations have also come to a halt same with Accel World. There is an equal amount of translators that have just quit it altogether.</br>  I'm going to capture Senpai<br><br><br>Also, I've confirmed the typo in it as the author mentions it in the comments.<br><br> Where am I going to make Iroha TL's now, since I only use 4chan. I hope there will still be LN threads. </br></br></br></br></br>  Is it ever stated in the LN whether Hachiman is good at English?  <br>Well Oregairu translations basically boils down to Spyro so we'll see what he decides to do<br><br> YFW we wont even get S3/Movie/OVA to cover the remaining novels </br></br></br>  <br>DanMachi was kill<br>Spyro is the only dedicated uptodate translator, if he's gone we'll have nobody</br></br>  <br>No, his only good subject is Japanese.</br>  <br><br>He's good at history, too.<br><br>But I don't think any two subjects have ever been emphasized as strongpoints for him except for Japanese literature and history.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Am Yukinofag <br> Spyro may quit translating altogether <br> Possibly no animation for remaining novels <br><br>Fuck Yen Press. These are some dark dark times. Time to learn moonrunes<br><br>We'll have Vol 12 Spoiler thread to look forward to I guess</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought /djt/ was our home now, no use making more threads</br>  <br>Mahouka is still going on. Here's the latest volume  Accel World translations died a year before it was licensed. DanMachi is the only real example I can think of where things died because of YP.</br>  <br> being a yuifag <br> exited to read volume 11 just for yuigahamama <br> yen fucking press strike again <br><br>ARRRRGGGHHHHHH!!!</br></br></br></br></br>  If Spyro goes for it he could translate the series before 2016, assuming 12 is the last.  <br>What are you trying to make me feel anon? ;_;</br>  <br>DUDE GENUINE LMAO</br>  <br>First real episode where you get to see Yuki having girl feelings towards Hachiman when she blushed at the end (6.5 transitions into7 as well)</br>  <br>Remember when we all thought Haruno was the bad guy?</br>  <br>She may not be the bad guy, but at the very least she isn't a good guy either.</br>  <br> I'll win senpai over <br>Doesn't that sound better?</br></br>   tfw I can't post with my Yuibros because they don't know moon <br>Can we Yuipost for old times sake or if no one left. I'll post Yui biased spoilers when 12 comes out.</br>  <br>That was before we realized she was Hitler<br>Now she's our hero</br></br>  <br>  I'll get Mr. Harris's attention one way or the other! <br><br>Might as well start translating everything like YP.</br></br></br>  <br><br>My opinion of her has never really changed since the culture festival arc. She's ambivalently good. Or ambivalently evil depending on how you look at it.<br><br>She's definitely trying to help Yukino, but her way of going about it makes you realize that's not all there is to her motivations.</br></br></br></br>  8man's wet dream<br><br><br>Fuck that, please no.<br>I feel bad for the EOPs now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually yea, I was thinking a bit too much about monster hunter.<br>It's good to be bit liberal.</br></br>  <br> Mr. Harris <br>I laugh but it hurts so much<br>Spyro isn't here to save me anymore ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Only Yukinofags thought she was "bad", purely because she consistently soiled Yukino's image.</br>  <br>Oh sweet, Volume 15 is done as well then?</br>  Tsk Tsk<br>Putting such a nice Irohasu~ picture under a tag I don't check often.</br>    Why did 8man stop drinking Georgia black? is it symbolism? i was actually gonna try some but then he started drinking MAX.  no one is actually going to buy jew press' shit why are they doing this?  <br>He only drank it once when he was pining for Sensei.</br>  <br>It still needs some work, go check out the mahouka thread, the link for 15 is there, as well as several text posts with the missing parts. <br><br>I have no idea where these translations are coming from, but they get posted regularly in Mahouka thread's. I'm sure Spyro could do the same. Just throw out a google link in a yahari thread one day, then let the anons propagate it.</br></br></br>  <br>Shekels.<br>$$$$$</br></br>  <br>When he was in depression mode after StuCo arc he needed the symbolism to make genuine seem more significant</br>  <br>He's been drinking MAX since the start, he only drank BLACK when talking with sensei or when he was being a loner again.</br>  Never Forget   She's dead   RIFE ON THE PLANET. <br>Great threads though</br>  What does everyone think Keith will have to say this month?  <br>Not even legal in Japan.<br><br>Even if whatever the fuck medieval place they live in is more progressive than America a month ago, Historia still needs to fuck some dude just to keep the royal blood line going.</br></br></br>  <br>YHfag, please.</br>  <br>Why do the shipper retards here think being queen means she is going to need a king, particularly that retarded faggot Eren? She is only a queen in name anyways.</br>  <br>Okay, then she'll become the virgin mary to keep up the royal bloodline.</br>  <br>Doubt the royal bloodline will be needed once her reign is over.</br>  Chaos Dragon thread, subs never.<br>What are sub groups even doing?</br>   it's a show about submarines             3rd season when?    <br>Salt water and shrimp</br>  <br>Squid Tits</br>    <br> never ;_; </br></blockquote>]
