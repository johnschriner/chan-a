One day in a village where English soldiers are pillaging and killing, a little girl seemingly held off all the invading soldiers, saving the village. All witnesses saw apparitions of angels and the Virgin Mary intervening, protecting the village and declaring how the girl will be the savior of France. The little girl is of course, Joan of Arc.<br><br>The Catholic Church and the Pope soon got word of this but is worried that proclaiming such an event as a miracle would sour relations between the Papal States and England. Thus, the Pope decides it would be better for the miracle to be considered "Satanic" and for Joan to be killed. The villagers and the Archdiocese of the region hid her away while knights and generals train her to become a leader and inspiration for France which is losing against England. <br><br>As years go by, Joan now grows into a young woman and takes the fight to the English, being an inspiration and morale booster for France and the French Catholic Church while pissing the Vatican and English off.</br></br></br></br>  Haruhi likes her coffee  blacked .    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EsB<wbr>eKqvROZs</wbr>  [ ]  I dun geddit  <br>aya didn't take the bbc, did she?</br>  <br>tbh me neither</br>  ITT: common misconceptions you had about anime characters before you watched the anime<br><br>I'll start: I thought Holo was a catgirl</br></br>  I thought Death Note was about Light with his Death Note and L with his detective skills teaming up to find a serial killer named Kira  <br>I thought steins gate was good</br>  I thought holo wasn't a bitch  <br>This.

Also, with the emergency contact list. They give us the Randall Corporation as an emergency contact, but black out the phone number. I haven't read any Government documents like this, but it seems silly to me to black out the publicly available phone number to a business if you give out its name. And even though they give us the name of the Randall Corporation they black out the names of the army base, the air base, and the hospital, the three of which are irrelevant to the plot. It seems too inconsistent and it feels hard to understand why they blacked out certain information unless I assume they were blacked out because we as the reader aren't supposed to know.</br></br></br></br>  No way back.  <br>I didn't think it was the case but this page is making me think, maybe they DO know Yuki's sane now and it's an accepted fact. I wonder why the whole megu-nee shit and other stuff akin to delusions (from Yuki 'pretending') keeps coming up then.</br>  whats wrong with twin tails?  <br>twin braids master race here.</br>  <br>She maxed out her STR, VIT and CHR. All those extra points she put in had to come from somewhere.</br>  <br>Because he's a king and not a Tennou. They've always had that distinction. There was a really big diplomatic flap once when a well-meaning Chinese ambassador called the emperor the king of Japan.<br><br>The Sakuradas, while they are the rightful rulers of whatever their country is called, are not necessarily direct descendants of Amaterasu, are not capable of performing Imperial rites, and are not at the head of the Yamato people. Presumably they would be subordinate in some ways to the Emperor.<br><br>I would really like to see more of an exploration of this. I've only seen absolute monarchy in modern culture discussed by Kings  which was also extremely interesting for its old-school Old Testament religion but that's off topic . Not that we're sure this is an absolute monarchy. The kids could probably sustain a reign of terror with just their powers though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, where did you get these from?</br>  <br>Nothing, but twintails need glasses.<br>All hairstyles necessitate glasses.</br></br>  Kouen getting NTRd  My fear that Kougyoku’ll end up being the one literally backstabbing Kouen when Sinbad uses her is ever growing.<br><br>I don't think I'm ready for that level of suffering for her.</br></br>  And you made fun of me when I've said that everyone would be on Hakuryuu' side and that Hakuei would betray without being Arba. I also was right that Hakuei was doing negotiations with other countries and that's why she wasn't showing in any Kou meetings. If would have know about it, he would lock Hakei in the basement.  <br>Ohtaka recently forgets to draw it. It's not the first time that happens.</br>  <br>You are going to see Aladdin and Alibaba saving Hakuryuu from Kouen trying to kill him. Judar wouldn't let Kouen to kill Hakuryuu and Alibaba wouldn't let to kill Hakuryuu too. Aladdin wouldn't let to kill Hakuryuu too.</br>  <br> Alibaba joined Kou, he might appear in any minute to fight against them <br>I doubt that he would fight. Alibaba would make a diplomatic choice and save Hakuryuu and Kouen killing each other.</br></br>  Episode 280 along with early manga spoilers today.

Most professional actors are comparable in skill; an actor succeeding in Hollywood depends on many factors unrelated to acting talent or skill. A lot of it is being in the right place at the right time, having a good agent, etc.</br>  <br> While a lot of anime is over the top the seiyuu often make even serious roles sound comical. <br><br> often <br><br>Source; my 10 watched anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boy that is an unfortunate hairline.</br>  <br> animes <br><br>Such an easy slip up, now we know for sure you are a fag.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry dude I'm too busy cooking</br></blockquote>]
