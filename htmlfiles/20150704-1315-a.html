[ I finally watched this movie today after putting it off for two years now.<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? <br><br> No seriously Bravo Gen BRAVO. I actually rather enjoyed this. Homu is still best meguca....prove me wrong faggots....PROVE ME FUCKING WRONG!  </br></br></br></br>  Go away  4th movie/2nd season fucking when?  <br>Dear diary today OP was not a faggot for once in his miserable life</br>    <br>But op i cant prove what is completely true. Based op for starting thread about best girl. Give me more homu!</br>  Homuhomu  <br><br>OP Here...I'll post more Homu.</br></br>  Best    <br>Beat girl. Best legs</br>  <br> while(rebellion happened?){ <br> printf("I watched Rebellion\n"); <br> printf("wtf was that\n"); <br> } <br><br>No wonder Homu gone mad in her loop. /a/ also gone mad either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    The fun of Rebellion is that there's a lot to read into, and nearly all of the stuff that doesn't seem to sense or comes out of nowhere actually has an explanation you can assemble.  Rebellion is the End of Evangelion of anime.  Reminder that Homu did literally everything wrong.  <br>You're a sick homusexual.</br>  Rebellion ruined homu a bit for me. While still my favorite, it made her actions seem a bit stupid and out of character. I'm not complaining since it still was entertaining  Homura is worst girl along with Sayaka. Madoka,Mami and Kyoko are best.  <br> liking Mami <br> liking useless characters <br>Ok dude.</br></br></br>  <br>low tier baito</br>  Stop asking stupid questions in the OP and post Homu.  <br>Or just simply my actual opinion? I'm not even saying anything so bad, or at least explain it to me</br>    <br>Also, please remember turning into a witch drives you insane.</br>  <br><br>Great pic. I will never undestand these faggots saying she was out of character in Rebellion.</br></br>  <br>I get it, but my point of view was only that I liked the sweet&amp;sour ending of the anime, and just her remembering madoka. But true, saying it was out of character was wrong of me</br>  <br>It wasn't out of character. Sill, before the movie was out, I was hoping Homura would undergo some character growth and get over her Madoka obsession, at least enough not to go down this path. In hindsight, it was naive to expect something like that from someone like Urobuchi.</br>  <br> spend nearly a decade trying to save someone and getting to know them <br><br>Her "getting over" Madoka would be unrealistic. She felt as attached to her as she would to a family member. She did what she set out to do, protect Madoka and ensure that she can live a safe and happy life. I respect the hell out of her for that.</br></br></br>  <br> Her "getting over" Madoka would be unrealistic <br>That depends on the execution, really. It wouldn't be unrealistic if handled properly.</br></br>  Daily reminder that Homura is preventing you from fucking Madoka.  <br>I find it really funny that almost every day someone finishes watching the movie and posts a thread in a very similar format to this.</br>  <br>Maybe. I'm perfectly fine with how it turned out though.</br>  Hom-Hom  <br>I'm fine with it too, provided they don't ruin it in a sequel. Frankly, now that they drove Homura this far, I'd like things to stay like this, no matter how fucked up the world might be.<br><br>But the movie was a bit of disappointment when I first watched it, to be honest.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just their excuse to start a tripfag/image dump thread.</br>  <br>I like posting images. I just need new ones.</br>  <br>Yeah, I could easily see a sequel fucking things up if not very well.<br><br>Also<br><br> No matter how fucked up the world might be.  <br><br>What makes you say the world is "fucked up?" Aside from some weird aesthetic changes her new universe seems pretty alright.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He said might.</br>  <br>Why don't you just go on Pixiv or Danbooru?</br>  <br>*if not handled very well</br>  <br>Reasons. Don't worry about it.</br>  <br>I worded that wrong. I'm still curious as to what would give him that impression.</br>  <br>Whatever then.<br>What images are you looking to save?</br></br>  <br>Perhaps it's the way Homura handled the megucas, you know, the tea cup, the apple, Sayaka getting clapped, the ending with the half world.<br><br><br>Any really.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine.</br>        Damn. I need a PC for webms.    <br>Oh well.</br>  <br>Never fails to have me chuckle.</br>    <br> Rebellionfags </br>          <br>The half moon symbolizes the duality between Homura and Madoka iirc.<br><br>But I think I misunderstood. For some reason I thought you meant the universe itself was physically unstable. How well Homu's universe will turn out is anyones guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes I know, but I think it's fucked because the moon and the world should be whole. That's me though.<br><br> I thought you meant <br><br>I'm not the other person.</br></br></br></br></br>     homu is the best <br><br>I think you mean Sayaka. Homushit ruined everything</br></br>  <br> Homu is still best meguca....prove me wrong faggots....PROVE ME FUCKING WRONG! </br>  <br>Homura's world doesn't follow the same rules as the previous one.</br>    When the melon breaks, it creates a sweet dream.     1. Got my new Homu merch <br> 2. Listened to Kimi no Gin no Niwa <br> 3. Opened /a/(despite not going here for a while) and thinking that "if there is going to be a Homu thread on a top of the frontpage, It will be a miracle <br> mfw there was </br></br></br>  <br>Weird, I just finished doing the exact same thing.<br><br>That scene where they first all transform was frigging beautiful. When you know who's coming last, and how her music sets herself apart.</br></br></br>    <br>No. Homu best girl. You just have shit reading comprehension. Not surprising for a Sayakafag.</br>  <br>In Homu's new world Homu will make sure Mami ends up foreveralone and unable to do a single push up.</br>    <br>Mumi pls.</br>  <br>Her head is going up.</br>  <br>Raped people have no voice.</br>    <br>Ok then i'll say it. <br><br>auuugh! No fighting!</br></br></br>  <br>I liked that doujin where Homu tied Mami up with her own ribbons</br>  <br>I didn't hear anything. <br>What could it possibly mean?</br></br>  <br><br> BULLIED   CHILDREN  detected</br></br>    <br>I was never raped. Something is wrong with your ears and your dub dubs are lying to you.</br>  <br>How do you know?</br>  Homu let loose AI YO.  <br>damn this art syle looks really famliar but I cant put my tounge on it.</br>  <br/>  <br>I thought Saotome was Sayaka.</br>  <br>G-Senjou no maou reference<br><br> Get it? DEVIL on j string <br><br><br>Maybe my ears are like Oriko, if you know what I mean</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like Oriko?</br>  i love homu  <br> Ribbon magic </br>  <br>That's not even Homu you imposter.</br>  <br>Disregard that, I suck cocks.<br><br>I'm also foreveralone.</br></br></br>  Are we using Buzzclaw Phantasma?  <br>WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br><br><br>what's it doing in my Homu folder?<br>Who is it? <br>What the fuck? Is this some sort of infiltration!?<br>Who could be behind it!?<br><br><br>Yeah<br>They can hear the future</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will never be raped.</br>  <br><br> Mami-san hijack </br></br>  <br>Perhaps it could mean that he did not in fact use his voice, but his keyboard, so no voice was ever heard. I imagine it would have sounded something somewhat like a bitch nigga.</br>   Witch  meguca wud u fug?  <br> Are you implying i'm a bitch nigga? <br><br><br>I'd  h ug Ophelia.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I changed my post mid-way, but forgot to delete &gt;</br>  Mami a best    So, I got myself these awesome posters from Plamoya that exceeded expectations. So great they are, that I'm actually going to put in in frames and build and altar around it, with candles and spider lilies and figures and other items.<br><br>I mean, around Homu one, at least. I don't really care about Madokami(she came together with Homu), but I suppose I'll keep her  as a pet  and hang her upside down below or opposite Homu<br><br>What sort of frame color would be best? Also, should I chose wooden or steel?</br></br></br></br>      God this card.  <br>Shittiest doujin I've ever seen. Never fails to make me mad.</br>  ﻿Ｓａｙａｋａ ｉｓ ＪＵＳＴＩＣＥ  first pmmm thread i read on jp....a really is shit!  <br>Mad? <br>What happened, anon? You can tell me everything.</br></br>  <br>uups...this is a, i should go to sleep....</br>  <br>Neat. post pic after you put them in the place.</br>  <br>There isn't any meguca thread on /jp/, anon<br><br>Also, it's called mahou shoujo madoka magica, not "pm"</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'll go buying frames tomorrow. But for now, I will just hang them on opposite pillars in my room, and wait until I get myself red spider lilies(really don't know where to find this on this time of the year) until I'll finish the altar proper.</br>  <br>No, no comment</br>  <br><br>read my second post faggot!</br></br>  <br>No.</br>      I'm glad all the spinoff manga are finally being localized in English. Even if some of them do suck.  i wounder if homura aver had sex and when jes, when  <br>Never. Obviously. <br><br>Unless you count ripping Madokami apart.<br><br>But who knows what she does in the new world, pic related.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I never cared for anything besides Oriko</br>    <br>jeah but urubutcher is rather a pervert...</br>  <br><br>Probably not, except with Madoka in her imagination.</br></br>  <br>Naaah, give him a break<br><br> That explains Devil Homu, in a way </br></br></br>     unique posters <br> 42 </br>    <br> Bravo Gen <br> Homu is best girl <br><br> I fully agree </br></br></br></br>  <br>hmm...i think homura was raped by mami in one timeline</br>  <br>Too many isn't it?</br>  <br>We shall uncover the secrets of universe!</br>  Would you?  <br>That only happens in doujins, anon<br><br> Besides, Mami is a lolicon </br></br></br>  <br>she should study theorhetical physiks (and make it)</br>  <br>Gonna say a light shade of wood, something a little reddish to match the purple and pink.<br><br>Either that or some edgy contemporary black shit for homu and something else for dokes.</br></br></br>  <br> red bitch <br><br>not my waifu, and probably has multiple STDs</br></br></br>  <br>She's been trying to give Madoka a happy life for years. It would be weird for her to just give up and say "fuck it" in Rebellion.</br>      <br> STDs <br><br>Kyoko is a pure maiden who always uses condoms when  holding hands. </br></br></br>  hm this is a rather good madoka thread for a change  <br>stop posting kyosaya, worst pairing <br><br>kyohomu is superior</br></br></br>    <br>I always rub sunscreen on her when going to the beach.</br>  <br>She's a bum and she was literally chewing condom in the Connect<br><br>I bet she pleases old men for money</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, never.</br>  <br>Have you ever had a freeze pop? Probably not since you only drink outta condoms after you pleased old, faceless, bald men</br>  <br>HAHAHA<br><br>Mami got her prey!</br></br></br>  <br>Best feeling ever. Also double dubs checked</br>  <br>you're in denial, it was a condom and she was chewing it on the balcony, no doubt after sex</br>  <br>i succedet in having a luced dream with homura once. pic related, thats how sho looked</br>  <br>Why is homu so wide?</br>  <br> suddenly remembering my dream <br><br>F-fuck you!</br></br></br>  <br>This is, no doubt, a message of Fate to me<br><br>I don't know what that means, but for now I decided to spend more time in these threads</br></br></br>  <br>I had lucid dreams with Homu too, but it was a while ago<br><br>I don't remember much now, but I'm pretty sure these were nightmares. <br><br>Anyway, now that I have a Homu pillow(hopefully) more dreams will follow</br></br></br></br></br>  Are the Madoka recap movies good  <br>Also only a sick pervert would look at a freeze pop like if it was a condom. Must be rough since used condom are all you eat.</br>  <br>Some parts were changed, some added, some deleted. Just watch them.</br>  <br> She's been trying to give Madoka a happy life for years <br>At the end of the tv series Madoka seems happy enough with her choices. The idea that she's not, was first introduced in the movie. If they didn't introduce that plot point, instead of making Madoka happy, Homura's journey could have been about learning to accept that Madoka was already happy.<br><br>Portraying character growth properly is never easy. If done well though, it can result in some pretty awesome developments.</br></br></br></br>  Wow you guys are so perverts. Kyouko is just next to me now and she's disgusted.  <br>Sorry, but entire /a/ used to call her "condom-chan" before her character was introduced</br>    <br>They are worth watching</br>  <br>I know.</br>  <br><br>What merch ya get anon?</br></br>  <br>she just sat on my chair and looket at me with that look...i ditnt know what she would do (either she was gonna kill me or have sex with me) so i got so nervous that i woke up...</br>  <br>But letting go of something that was so important to her, would be against Homura's entire character, which was the point of the movie</br>  <br>For a first time view of the series i would say watch the 12 episodes then rebellion. Just to get the full story. Then anytime you want to re watch the show the 3 movies work well</br>  <br>Sorry bro, that's a phantom.</br>   enter thread <br> save all homu's <br> ignore everything else <br> leave </br></br></br>  <br><br>Other then aforementioned posters, I also got myself a clock, some sleeves and a 45x45 pillow with Homu<br><br>Good stuff.</br></br></br></br>    <br> the 3 movies work well <br>That's exactly what I want to do. Don't feel like watching the whole series again</br></br>    <br>She's in my bed. Just next to me, peeping my tablet's screen.</br>  <br>Gohan's a big guy.</br>  Post more lewd meguca.    <br>Hey, I do the same!</br>  <br>Poor you. She is petting my cat as we speak.</br>     &gt;Tulpa people ITT     <br>You speak as if the movie were some fanfic. It's the sequel. If it explicitly says Madoka's unhappy, she's unhappy. Regardless of what it you can infer she may have felt previously in the series.</br>      <br><br>I've got GSC's scale figure (you are not alone version) coming, hope it's worth the $210 I paid.</br></br>    <br>Homura's not a robot programed to do this no matter what. She's doing it because she has put an unreasonable value in Madoka, while lacking self-esteem herself.<br><br>It's not impossible to make her undergo character growth, and it wouldn't go against her entire character if done properly. To begin with, part of the reason Homura's so hung up on Madoka is her lack of self-esteem. A movie or tv series about Homura's character growth would of course need to tackle those issue first.</br></br></br>      <br> You speak as if the movie were some fanfic. It's the sequel. If it explicitly says Madoka's unhappy, she's unhappy. Regardless of what it you can infer she may have felt previously in the series. <br>You missed the point. Of course now that movie is out, whatever it was said there is canon. I was talking about how I would have wanted things to go before the movie was out. How I hoped the movie would have been. That kinda thing.</br></br>  I have a suspicious feeling that the events of the third movie will cause Gretchen to appear.<br>But I can't quite tell why...</br>    <br> petting my cat </br>  <br>was in tokio in april...200€ for all</br>  <br>Calm the fuck down with that yuri, there.</br>    <br>Rebellion was kind of made because Madoka was popular, the original was never intended to have a sequel. That's why they made the movie recaps, it's kind of like another loop or something. Devil Homu is interesting development, I think they want her to become a scary legend among the fan base. It feels like it puts the story at a dead end though, so it's easy to just ignore it as a non-canon what-if.</br>      Why is Kyouko best you ask? It's simple,  she just is. <br><br><br>Haha, very funny, Madokami.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Mami is a shit...she's one of the reasons Homu pretty much kept suffering the whole time. <br><br><br><br>OP Here, Glad to have been at your service. <br><br><br><br>Lick her feet? Hell Yes I would. Kyoko's my other fav. <br><br>funny enough the RECAPTCHA for this post was a birthday cake....love the little bits of irony like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Madoka is the purest, right?  <br>Fair enough.</br>  She is fun to be with. We love to play with each other all day.    <br>Never<br><br>Absolutely.</br></br></br>    Kyouko always catches me off guard with these when she wants to tease me.  Often going for my neck.   <br>That's the idea. Only the purest of souls could become the embodiment of hope for meguca.</br>      <br> plot device </br>    Playfully(?) attacks me when I wreck her highest score.  Lazing around all day which is very comfy.  <br>Rude.  That's clearly Mami </br>  <br>Kyouko petting apple's p****cat doujin when?</br>  How angry she gets when I sneak the last food. Often leading to her getting me with that spear. It's surprisingly fun, till she catches me.<br><br><br>She always pets my cat when we sit on the living room floor.</br></br></br>  <br>will madoka be the highschool bicycle like her mom?<br><br>someone post that webm, you fuckers know the one.</br></br></br>  <br> AI YO WHAT THE FUCK <br><br>Chuckled.</br></br></br>  <br>She really can't get over her madoka obsession because she's the one that caused her to make her sacrifice.</br>  <br>How about you fuck off.</br>  <br> (rebellion happened?) <br>That's not even an expression what the fuck is this</br></br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127550963 <br>based tripfriend saves the day</br>  Just looking at her is fun.

Good bye, my beautiful red head. I love you, Kyouko.  <br><br>I thought she was picking her nose in the thumbnail.</br></br>  <br>Back at ya.</br>  <br>The Universe is stable enough, it's Homura that's potentially unstable<br><br>She admits its a bubble that will one day pop when madoka gets her memories back, she can't stop it forever.<br><br>On that day Madoka will see her as an enemy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyouko night is cancelled forever, Apple.</br>  <br>red and blue is good too. but black red and blue is top tier</br>  <br>N, no.

Either someone is reverse trolling hard or reddit is here in full force.</br></br>  <br> They all have one of the same 3 formulas <br><br>Gangsta doesn't exactly have a unique formula either though.</br></br></br>  <br>It could use a bit more polish, but I'll give any show that isn't moeblob a chance.<br><br>I won't blindly defend it if it's bad, but I don't see why people go out of their way to shit on it before it came out.</br></br></br>  <br>Kekkai Sensen<br>Etotama<br>Shokugeki no Soma<br>Danmachi<br>Ore Monogatari<br>Fate<br>Gintama<br>Plastic Memories<br>Hibike Euphonium<br>Assasination Classroom<br>Death Parade<br>Rolling Girls<br>Yoru no Yatterman<br>Shinmai Maou Testament<br><br>That's it just on top of my head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'll give any show that isn't moeblob a chance. <br>Nic is a moeblob</br></br>  <br><br> Koufuku Shitfitti <br> best of anything <br>Go fuck yourself</br></br></br></br>  this is gonna be one of those shows /a/ can't talk about isn't it?

After the Sword Art Online parts are over, it gets really bad. Fuck that fairy shit.</br>  <br>You know what he he mean : sol with a full hight school girl cast.</br>  Why's everyone meme hating this? I haven't watched it but I don't think it deserves this hate <br>I read some of the manga a good while ago and I remember enjoying it <br><br><br>It was good considering the differentish art style which probably makes animation a little harder</br></br></br></br>   mc isn't a weak beta faggot that makes it fujoshit   <br> the differentish art style which probably makes animation a little harder </br>  <br>Feels like they're trying to hard to be cool</br>   That OST <br><br>I felt like I was listening to Champloo at some points, it's so fucking based,</br></br>  <br>anime in a nutshell</br>  <br>Yes, it was, yes it was.</br>  <br> 5.5/10 <br>that's incredibly generous</br></br>  <br>I like the OST on its own, but I'm not convinced it's right for this show</br>  <br>Chuunis will lick it up.</br>  <br>If you actually bothered to watch a variety of series instead of just limiting yourself to the top five /a/-approved shitposting fodder you'd realize it's fucking Pleiades, you faggot.</br>  MANIME-fags are the dudebros of anime<br><br>You can't prove this wrong</br></br>  <br><br> edgy <br> "I just noticed this anime is not a comedy or slice of life" </br></br></br>  <br>Is this a good or bad thing?</br>  <br>No, they're usually fedoratippers</br>  <br>negative connotation</br>  <br>Bara anime</br>  <br><br>cawadoody dewrito kings</br></br>  <br>Does anyone even use that term seriously?<br>Whenever I see it it seems to be bait.</br></br>  <br>No, it's always bait, usually accompanied with image.jpg and BOOYAH</br>  How many episodes are out right now? Is it worth catching up on?  I noticed some choppiness at the animation. What do you guys think of it, if you noticed?  <br>1, and no, it's shit.</br>  <br>the first episode is all thats out. <br>already staying true to the manga and its looking amazing.</br></br>  <br><br>Great, that means I'm right on time to jump the bandwagon.</br></br>  <br>Same composer</br>  <br>Manglobe and bad animation go hand in hand.</br>    Jesus fucking Christ, I can't even watch past the OP. <br>It's like they just rammed in everything possible to make it appeal to 14 year olds. Drugs, sex, wubwub, weapons. Don't even get me started on the guy dodging bullets and slicing people in half with his katana.<br>This show is the biggest piece of shit you could possibly find.</br></br>  <br> Kekkai Sensen <br> not edgy <br><br>k</br></br></br></br>  I can't believe Manglobe is still alive  <br>What is that a spoiler?</br>  <br>fuck man? spoil so hard....</br>  <br>Yaharifag please</br>  <br><br> Lmao tru <br><br> I hate reddit so much </br></br></br></br>  <br>Rumours are saying they're working on new seasons of Hayate and Zettai Karen Children.</br>  <br>Maybe because there's the manga that people have read beforehand.<br><br>It has its good points, like a few interesting character that can carry you through most of it, but the manga tries so fucking hard to be a gritty Black Lagoon x10, with rape and gore thrown in for good measure and a nauseatingly repeated hamfisted message of "oh look at them poor oppressed people". The plot and some character actions make some rather strange turns that don't make much sense on closer inspection. Less would have been more on various aspects.<br><br>But don't let me detract you from it. You can find all of this out on your own. It was an interesting enough read for the 30 available chapters I read at the time, but I don't really feel the need to dive back in.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't post that shit here faggot, fuck off.</br>  <br> implying we aren't little girls </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127540429   <br>she is alive only her arm is cut off.<br>the english scans are so freaking slow i just go to the chinese scans its up to chapter 41 now</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127540429 <br>There is no containment<br><br>http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/red<wbr>dit-users-lock-up-site-in-protest-o<wbr>ver-employee-s-firing-1.3136856</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Man, you know you're just spoiling everyone twice as much by reassuring them right?</br>  <br>Gangsta is being published by Viz in the US. <br>The scanlation was dropped a long time ago.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127540429 <br>No, you fuck off. Back to /v/, that's where you belong to, IRCdrone.</br>  <br>i do this on revenge cuz they try to spoil for others so i spoil it for them</br>  <br>cant even look in this thread anymore because of faggots like you.<br>jesus christ the spoilers...</br></br>  <br>well people are posting spoilers so i spoil it for them out of spite</br>  <br>English published is ahead of the scanlation anyway, its caught up with Japan. Someone would probably have to scan the English published version if you want it for free in English now.</br>  Why Western-bait anime is getting so popular now? First Kekkai Sensen now this.  <br>You are a faggot of the lowest tier.</br>  <br><br>How do you know you are even spoiling it for the other person? You likely aren't. You are are just as bad if not worse.</br></br>  <br>good that i got you rustled enough to call me names.</br>  <br>Because there's increasingly a focus on the western market. I thought that was obvious. Then again, you are a tripfag, so idiocy of the highest order is to be expected.</br>  <br>No, actually I'm caught up. I'm just stating the facts.</br>  <br>you know you dont have to believe what i say to begin with right?</br>  <br> first Kekkai Sensen <br> implying there haven't been a ton of others <br>Just started watching anime this year, huh?</br></br></br>  <br>your facts is wrong then because im not into men at all thereby you calling me faggot is not true</br>  If an anime having prostitutes is what makes it good for you, then you should check out Idolm@ster.  never change /a/  <br>Nope.<br>The correct suggestion is to watch Memoirs of Amorous Gentlemen.</br></br>  <br/>  Onepunch man is coming out fall guranteed anime of the year.  <br> reddit <br><br>Why the fuck are you there?<br>Why would you even know about this post?</br></br></br></br>  Any anime which isnt moeshit is above average and this is above above average<br>So its AOTS already</br>  <br>Gathering bait material. <br>Seems it was rather successful.</br></br>  Looks like edgelord bait. I'll stick to my low test slice of life for a low test beta like meself.  <br>Mute is not able to speak but hear. He's deaf, there's a part where his part fires a gun next to his ear and had to look at it to realise it was there.</br>  <br>Circumcised nigger loving bullshit.</br>  Any of you fags have a webm of Nicolas signing in the ED?  Alex and Nic are far too lewd.  I wanted to have ultra violent sex with Nicolas ever since I first started reading the manga years ago, now with the anime I realized I was totally right.  <br>Best pairing mang</br>  <br>I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did, which isn't to say much, cuz I thought I would find it disgustingly edgy for my tastes.</br>  Is this gay porn? Because it looks like gay porn.  <br>I'm sure you're an expert.</br>  <br>Is this a fear of your own sexuality?<br>Because it reads like a fear of your own sexuality.</br></br>  <br><br><br>No really, he looks delicious.</br></br></br>  I just finished the first episode and damn, this show is fun!<br><br> Good looking setting <br> Somewhat likeable protagonists <br> Deaf swordsman instead of a blind one <br> Smooth action <br><br>I guess you could describe it as Triage X if it weren't shit. Looking forward to the next episode. What day is it coming out?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   first episode only covers first chapter of the manga <br>Looks like it's not going to cover much of the material at all. Slow paced as all hell.</br>  <br>No, it's more likes Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage or Jackals. Just starting watching anime, huh?<br><br> What day is it coming out? <br>Really, anon? This is so trivial to find out, I'm not even going to spoonfeed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Summer is here</br>  <br>or Until Death Do Us Part</br>  <br> Just starting watching anime, huh? <br>Well, this is not really the genre I'm usually into. I mostly watch  shonenshit </br></br>  <br> ultra violent sex <br>He deserves to be loved tenderly.</br></br>  I disliked it. Too tryhard.<br><br>Some people here really praise anything that is edgier.</br></br>  <br> anything which isnt SoL moeshit is tryhard <br><br>Im getting sick of this meme</br></br></br>  <br> I want to not be able to walk for few days after the sex and during my recovery time we can make tender love. </br>  <br><br>The fujos are here</br></br>  <br>Are you a feminist or something? This low level of argumentation is usually only used by them.<br><br>A show can be not moe and not tryhard.</br></br></br>  <br> Nah, I'm just gay as fuck and Nicolas is perfect. </br>  <br> Are you a feminist  <br>Wat.<br>Hes clearly implying this is tryhard because it doesnt have cute highschool girls in it</br></br></br>  <br>No, not because of that, but because of the idiotic kind of argument.<br><br> You don't think we should ban magazines with women in bikinis? You are a cheetos eating neckbeard. </br></br></br>  <br>It's like he only knows how to draw exactly one face</br>  <br> That's okay, I assumed you wanted to violently dick him rather than the other way around </br>  <br>this is the worst anime to thing of when thingken of genuine</br>  12 episodes confirmed  <br>source? If that's true than it will be a masterpiece with a anime original end, I'm hyped.</br>  <br>I work for manglobe</br>  <br>Manime's so great right guys? It's great being mature.</br>  <br> I'm so new guys! </br>  <br>Oh, but did you ask the boss' dog first?<br><br><br> moe weebos and NEETS are this butthurt <br>One billion keks</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the way they did Nicholas's speech. Props to the VA.</br>  <br> What's wrong with being new? </br>  Why do these kind of anime threaten moeshiteaters so much?  <br>They're not used to anything outside of their comfort zone of daki pillows and neon colored hair.</br>  <br> keks <br><br>Reddit please leave.</br></br></br>  I really liked the episode. I dont understand why they would save a trashy whore like her, though.<br><br><br> moeshiteaters <br><br>Probably because of stuff like this. You guys act like redditors/normalfags.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is moeshit finally dying?  <br> muh moeshit <br> muh edgy manimoos </br></br>  <br>Unfortunately no.</br>  Nicolas is fucking great, When do you ever see a deaf character who is also incredibly strong, You fucking don't.<br><br>I can't wait for more.</br></br>  <br> Probably because of stuff like this. You guys act like redditors/normalfags. <br><br>Look at the first posts<br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stop pretending to belong here /v/.</br>  <br>you said "fucking" twice</br>  Is it really fujoshit or is it just a meme? I think I'll wait a little before seeing for my self since I don't like dropping anime but I don't want to watch anime aimed at girls.  <br>It's not fujoshit</br>  <br>Yes but that doesnt happen often because there aren't many shows like this. But you see people complaining about ''moeshit'' all the time. <br><br>Well, I guess both sides are at fault. So lets just hope it will calm down in the next threads.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a male duo who are manly and good looking. You don't need much for fujoshis to start doing what they do best.</br>  <br>Probably not, just look at all the Kekkai Sensen/Euphonium shitposting</br>  <br>There's really no pandering at all, just good looking male characters (which is easily enough for fujos, don't confuse anime aimed at girls with fujobait because shounen and seinen has plenty of it). Worst I can think of was Worick telling Nic he'd make a good escort.</br>  <br>That doesn't make any sense.</br>  <br> kek <br> hurr no one uses kek here on my /a/ <br>Stop being so pretentious /v/.</br></br></br>  <br>But I'm not from /v/. Just keep that shit out of here. Kek, Lel or whatever. Its cancerous as fuck. You dont see others spamming ''lol'' or stuff like that either.</br>  <br> kek = lol <br>literally how new are you? Be honest</br></br>  <br><br><br>Alright, I'll keep watching how this develops to see if it is worth picking up. Right now I'm little off put by the character designs.</br></br></br>  <br>Bara</br>  <br>I have been here since 2010. Fuck off. Its the same fucking retarded shit underage faggots spam.</br>  The word 'edgy' has lost all meaning here.  <br> 2010 <br>fuck off you newfag</br></br>  Why does modern /a/ fall so easily for false flagging? Are you genuinely retarded or is it the blazing summer heat?  <br>Haruhi S3</br>  <br>A bit of both. I feel kind of dizzy.</br>  <br>pos boring anime</br>  <br>Isn't he dead though</br>  <br>so, using your definition of the term, you're a feminist?</br>  <br>Tsutchie? no</br>  What does moe mean?  <br>sucking the dick of a little girl</br>  <br>You know what he meant anon.</br>  All anime is Moe and everyone who partakes in the enjoyment of anime, light novels, visual novels, manga and the like are all "moeshitters" Moe is love<br>Moe is life</br>  Finally a real anime. Moefags getting<br>BTFO<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy gets it.</br>  Looks like I can add Gangsta to the list of shows I watch but can never discuss.<br><br>You usually only get this much shitposting in Fate threads.</br></br>  <br>That's sad. What do you want to discuss?</br>  <br>I really liked the opening</br>  <br>You mean the ED, right?</br>  <br>It's a new season, it can't be avoided. The shitposting should die down in 2-3 weeks.</br>  <br>dull black lagoon reboot, AOY <br><br>nope. this is all types of shit rolled into one package. i'll give it a few episodes, but right now it's just a straight up mediocre wannabe black lagoon.</br></br></br>  wtf you dumb as hell  <br>Do you even know what reboot means</br>  <br>It doesnt matter what weapon you use, but it does matter how you hold it.</br>  I'm a gangster  <br><br>And hes a tripfag to boot.</br></br>  I like to think this takes place in the same universe as Black Lagoon and Jormungand.  <br>I like to think it takes place in the same universe as Seinfeld but I mean thats just me.</br>  <br>Okay?</br>  I hope there aren't any main character females that are also sluts/whores.<br><br>Are there?</br></br>  <br>It's not, but fujos are delusional and homos are happy with any 2D manly man.</br>  <br>Indeed we homos are, but dear god is Nic a fucking cute bastard about his manliness.</br>  <br>Him trying to talk just made me imagine him giving that monologue at the end of Blade Runner.</br>  <br> sluts  <br><br>this word is very problematic</br></br></br>  <br>I think its gonna be a frequently used one in these threads.</br>  T-minus 5 hours till it gets released<br><br> Who: Trigger company  <br><br>https://www.kickstarter.com/project<wbr>s/1311401276/little-witch-academia-<wbr>2/description<br><br> What : <br><br>Little Witch Academia 2 (tentative title) is the sequel to the previous title Little Witch Academia, directed by Yoh Yoshinari, and produced by studio TRIGGER. We plan to spend half a year on the scenario, and work on the storyboard and settings during the upcoming spring. We will get started with the actual production in summer and plan to finish by 2014 winter. As of now, we have the funds to produce a 20 minute episode. However, if we can receive support through the Kickstarter program, we will be able to add 15 more minutes to the running time. The episode will be subtitled in 7 different languages.<br><br> When:  <br><br>Today at 5pm pdt @ anime expo<br><br>Come take an exclusive first look at the premiere of Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade! This will be the first time Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade is screened in front of a live audience. Don’t miss out!<br><br> Where:  <br><br>/a/ as in I or another anon who backed will upload the movie ost and artbook depending on what is released in hd quality here. Movie is 100% guaranteed. <br><br>Update: I may stream both episodes on hitbox @ 830 est time<br><br> We are also aware that not everyone will be able to attend the premiere event. Therefore, we have decided to provide the digital contents as the premiere starts so all of our backers will be able to enjoy the episode at the same time!  <br><br><br>why: because more sucy and I believe</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  I might go stand in line in a bit. But why should I care?  I'll be there.  <br> artbook <br>They're releasing it in digital format?</br></br>  Wait, so you'll be getting the new movie today?<br>I thought they would screen it today and screen it later.</br>  Why can they only give out SD versions for the backer rewards?  <br> I thought they would screen it today and screen it later. <br>Shit, I meant to say screen it today and distribute it later.</br></br>  <br>fuck trigger and their jew shit</br>  <br>No anon you are the shitposting jew</br>  <br><br>if you bought the perk for the regular edition of the blu ray and up you get the movie,ost,and artbook digitally.<br><br>I would assume if they release the movie tonight they MAY release the artbook and ost also. But the only thing guaranteed is the movie.<br><br><br><br>this is for anons who didnt attend anime expo.<br><br>Hence the upload and a possible stream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HD digital version isn't getting released until they ship the BDs.</br>  <br>O-oh, so OP doesn't wanna meet some /a/nons?</br>  Anybody going to upload the digital art book?  Still 5 hours?  <br>It starts 8 est, so three hours</br>  <br>Damn, I didn't back the kickstarter but I want the artbook.<br>I wonder if they will include it in the retail version of the BD.</br></br>  <br>Fuck, I'll be sleeping. Too tired to stay awake. Let's hope it will be great.</br>  <br><br>im not flying/driving across all of america to meet anyone. Plus the line up sucks.</br></br>  Hype.<br>I'll be waiting warmly for uploads and will be there in the case of a stream.<br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br><br><br>your best bet is if they release the artbook/ost I will upload it.<br><br>I dont think they have plans to release this to retail.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  Wasn't /a/ hyped about this?<br>What the hell happened?<br>Anyway bump because I'm hyped for the uploads.</br></br>  <br>me too</br>    can't wait... but perhaps they will release the other digital goodies at a later date.  <br>Thanks, anon.<br><br>Looking forward to the stream.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember seeing her in one of the early ks updates. Did she make it in or is that just a concept?</br>    <br>don't know</br>  i wish I backed more  <br><br>I wish I did too but at least I backed 100$.</br></br>  <br>She was in the exhibit but a bunch of other concepts weren't so maybe?</br>  Fuck, still 2 hours to go. You still planning to stream LWA1?  <br>gonna need a name or link for the stream</br>  MOVIE AIRS IN 20 MINS<br><br>I can stream it if anyone wants me to when it's live</br></br>  <br>20 minutes? I thought it started at 5pm PST, no?</br>  <br>Oh okay, you're right.<br>Tattun said 4:15pm for some reason?</br></br>  I'm pretty hype for that animation quality<br><br>How jelly are you of my super-cheap trigger autograph /a/?</br></br>  <br>step up<br> dat Mako though </br></br>  how long before good quality rips come out?  Damn. Why do I only learn about this now? I'm glad I backed one of the few Kickstarter projects that actually produced something. Soon we'll need the fingers of two hands to count them.  Lucky fuckers.  <br>Whose autograph is on the bottom right?</br>  <br><br>That 4:15 referred to yesterday's panel.</br></br>  I'm not at AX but I backed the project. Are they going to send an email to see the episode or something? I'm looking at this old email that says they'll release the digital contents so we can watch the episode at the same time, but it doesn't say how to access it.  <br>Shigeto Koyama?</br>  <br>I know as much as you do. The only thing we can do is wait for it to happen. I expect them to release a new update on Kickstarter with the details around the time the panel is held.</br>   tfw in line <br> pretty packed for a short animation <br> tfw didnt go early enough to get in line <br><br> don't shoot me if you see your face in the picture. Don't even mention it so no one knows it's you  :^)   </br></br></br></br>  <br> short animation <br>Isn't it like an hour long?</br></br>  <br>Maybe, but shilling has to be involved too.</br>  <br>It's supposed to be at least an hour long since it would have been the lenght of a normal anime episode without the crowdfunding.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty jelly anon. <br><br>I would've given them the poster to sign but I didn't know they were going to be at the convention. <br><br><br><br>Kofumi's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me on the right with white hair</br>  <br>Is that Mako with the white shirt? She isn't as genki in real life as I thought she'd be.</br>  <br> mfw I was at AX last year and out of nowhere won a raffle for a Koshimizu Ami and Yuzuki Ryouka autograph <br> didn't even go this year </br></br>  <br>That was a good panel.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6R8<wbr>x5k-BheE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>No wait I'm retarded<br><br>This anon  got it right. Kofumi is the one below Akko's face</br></br></br>  TORRENT WHEN<br>I didn't back it so I won't have access to the dl copy</br>  So are backers getting a link today?<br><br>I'm so confused</br></br>   tfw faggot normie train come and we had to move over an entire row <br> tfw now we're facing backwards <br> tfw someone farted too <br><br>I fucking hate this so much</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only part I really remember is Yuzuki trying to recall the lines of Satsuki's spiel in the first episode. I resisted the faint urge to shout "MUJUN KOSO SHINRI."</br>  <br>Originally it was going to be 25 minutes, the KS was to make it 40 minutes long. It got extended further because the story they wanted to tell needed more time to be fleshed out so the final running time is 60 minutes.</br>  <br>Are those posters only available at the event?</br>  Lotte is hot  <br>They fucked up the line now, there's a loop going around our row, moving and we're not moving.</br>  <br>Really?

You mean like a gangbang?  Sorry op looks like everyone else is too busy re-watching lain today  <br>I actually did rewatch it yesterday. I'm putting together a VERY-revised final theory (I'm the anon who summarized the PSX game a couple of weeks ago) that I'll post here whenever. After having read Lain's Diary, I actually teared up at that final episode.</br>  Why do she tie her rat-tail of a hair like that? Did she think she was some special little snowflake? Goddamn insufferable  <br>Something to do with a Japanese good luck type thing having to do with left and right iirc. It's a symbol like her bear stuff.</br>  Lain is a Goddess  <br>that sounds good<br> mfw /a/ is not total shit sometimes <br>also checked</br></br></br>    <br>Ganbaru</br>  <br>Who is this "honest man", and why doesn't he understand? What is the meaning of the OP?</br>  <br>You'll have to ask Jasmine Rodgers</br>  I can dump artbook/fanbook/upload bootleg program/songs if anyone would want that  Why did Lain kill herself in the video game?  I guess I'll just post the first few pages of the artbook.  Is it wrong that I find Lain oddly sexual?  <br>yes please</br>    <br>Because she was alone in the real world. She is an introvert who has difficulty making friends. She didn't have any friends, her parents left, and the comfort she found was on the Wired. She killed herself to "connect" with everybody. I take this as her returning to her "essence" as an omnipresent being, abandoning her sentience.</br>  This is a scary person.  <br>Eriri is  third  best.</br>  <br> Eriri doesn't get the cover picture of the BD containing the climax of her arc <br><br>Explain this bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br> Eriri <br> best girl <br> compared to a literal blessing </br></br></br>  <br>Not even the anime staff likes Eriri.</br>  <br> wanting more Eririshit </br>  Because having another dead thread, sounds like a good idea.  <br>Chizuru being the best target for a crappy self-insert by the average antisocial /a/non doesn't make her better either.</br>    <br>Wow, you're really adamant about hating Chizuru<br>You should try being more yuru</br></br>  <br>Contractions are cheating, anon. <br><br> himawari a shit </br></br></br>  <br>I doubt anyone antisocial could relate to the harem that she's currently building.
