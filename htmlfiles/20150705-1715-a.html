This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

I ignored this thread for a bit because shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Names in the credits were for the $300 tier backers. Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting. This is hilarious.</br>  <br>Yeah. It was a backer listed in the credits.</br>  <br>BASED<br><br>10/10</br></br></br>  <br> We Gurren Lagann now <br><br>I'm okay with this</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't realize she had long hair.

I hope LWA3 makes them canon.  <br>When they make another Kickstarter.<br><br>Would you guys back it all over again? I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception. It actually stands for God.<br><br>Source: I'm a gangster.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't ship them, but I do like seeing them being friendly.<br><br>LWA2 gave me just enough of that to prevent a riot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko x Sucy &gt; Akko x Diana<br>Look into your heart, you know it to be true</br></br>  <br>Not like I've got a better way to spend a hundred bucks right now. (cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

Waited so long that I had pretty much forgot about it.</br></br></br>   Sticky <br><br>More Amanda now please</br></br>  HORRIBLESUBS SAVING THE DAY   not saving it for halloween   <br> Also I didn't even know the second ep had come out. <br>there were threads about it for weeks how did you not notice?</br></br>  I honesty thought the fat girl was going to go apeshit when people steal her snacks.  <br><br>Neat. At least that solves the font issue.</br></br>  <br>It makes me happy that this faggot typed all this inane bullshit out and didn't even get a reply. Hope he killed himself.</br>    WE STICKY NOW  Which tiers are the various witches in?  <br>Can't wait for the fanart of catsuit Amanda.</br>  Can we all agree that this was as delightful, if not even more, than the original?<br><br>Can we put the cynicism aside for this one?</br></br>  HORRIBLESUBS!!!  <br>Perfection</br>  <br>I love how they didn't make the characters stereotypical in all respects. A sharing fat girl who is cute, the cocky tomboyish girl who isn't a bitch, and the short helpful mechanic.</br>  <br> I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb <br>thats kind of the point for her</br></br>  <br> Two left feet </br>  <br>All S tier<br>Fat-chan is in A tier.</br></br>  <br>YABBA DABBA DOO</br>  <br>Gurl's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.</br>   Donated but didn't see my name in credits <br> Scanned through multiple times just to make sure I didn't miss it <br><br>Oh....o-okay.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris). The orchestral score was performed by the Russian State Symphony Cinema Orchestra. Pretty neat.   Vimeo <br> an hour long <br> only 550mb  <br><br>Fuck this, I'll torrent it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anything with 5 a's?</br>  <br>Torrent is a rip from vimeo, though.</br>  <br><br>Even 24min could if they throw money at it.<br><br>Look at Wizard Barristers; I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. But that first episode was money. Everything else sucked, but if you pretend like everything else doesn't exist, it's not a bad anime.<br><br> just keep throwing money at something and you get this: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=avf<wbr>28NLksxE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   01 <br> A Hour long <br><br>So onward we getting the usual 20 mins now</br></br></br>  Anyone planning on buying the BD when it comes out?   thumb-sucking like a baby <br>Just make a full TV series already.</br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Got a spare 1.5 million US dollars lying around?</br></br></br>  /av/ please<br>make it real</br>  <br>THANK YOU! It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed?

Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure.

It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/?

He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple.

Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different.

You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre. Welcome to /a/.</br>  Stop responding to the dumbass who's been trying forever to convince people to accept his retarded definition of "anime," and that the hundreds of people on /a/ who funded the show back when it had a sticky are secretly crossboarding /co/-scum.  <br>my thoughts exactly, I normally really like that type of character but it was too much</br>  <br>So Studio Pierrot isn't Japanese now?

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it.

It's easy to spot stuff that's ripping off 90s Glen Keane-core Disney (John K calls it "Cal Arts style") and LWA is not even fucking close.<br><br>It's not like they even attempted and failed, the two styles are worlds apart.</br></br></br></br>  <br> LWA The Chalice of Flames <br>Akko is mistakenly entered into an inter-school witches tournament and must battle other witches to the death.</br></br>  <br>that fucking kamina smile</br>  <br>Busterbeam stop.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about? LWA2 had an upskirt butt shot with NO panies. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;7570485 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just puffy clothes.</br>  <br>Did you forget about me?</br>  claimed  <br>Brad Bird will save western hand-drawn animation, I hope.</br>  I never watched the first one and I think KLK is mediocre.<br><br>Should I try it just for the lolis?</br></br>  <br> and "furry" is not a sexual orientation. </br>  <br>Westaboos<br><br><br>Probably</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can watch cute girls do cute things for hours. Really, I'm not that fussy about what constitutes "new", a slightly different mix of archetypes sat round a table is enough to make it fresh.<br><br>But LWA2?

Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it.

When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy.

You want "innovative" stories and "deep" characters just so you can tell everyone you're engaged in profoundly intellectual artistic pursuits and not merely entertaining yourself like some commoner. It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

They would have that unmistakable sweaty, musky butt smell; but each rear would have its own unique characteristic that makes them all worth sniffing.</br>  <br>That's because they already have Precure (for the bigfriends) and Kamen Rider (for lonely housewives).

The animation for LWA2 isn't going to break and there is no gameplay or any user input involved. We're just viewers that know the general art direction.

But yeah, she did nothing. </br>  <br>she handed out candy. And if they ever do LWA3 hope to see her doin something really important</br>  <br>But she threw candy to make the parade bystanders happy!</br>  <br>Ursula is actually the little sister of Diana's mom and a "disgrace to the family. The Cavendish family is the most reputable family in the old guard of witches but they have a very "witches-are-superior-to-muggles" ideology and believe witches should be feared. Ursula disagreed and ran away from home. Diana really loved her aunt and went to every event. The guy with Diana in the intro scene of LWA is her butler. One day Shiny Chariot's show stopped without warning because something happened that killed the Shiny Rod's power. The third movie will be parent's visit day and it will deal with this backstory.</br>  <br>i want to believe!</br>  <br>A common mexican name.</br>  If I'm a backer, where can I watch this without torrenting?<br><br>Haven't gotten any emails nor am I seeing anything on the Kickstarter site.</br></br>  <br>ok premise if they had a tv show</br>  Holy shit Akko almost made this unbearable to watch.

When you watch the first episode it becomes clear that the dresses are not designed that way.</br>  <br>It's not. You can actually see her bare butt in the episode if you happen to pause it at just the right moment.</br>  <br>Exactly when?</br>  <br>Sensory overload. <br>The wand represents my penis.</br></br>  I just naturally assumed that their school uniforms have some sort of censorship enchantment on them to prevent upskirts and panty shots  <br>A Little Witch Academia without "The Void" it's simply not Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>33:55<br><br>It's near the start of the parade, when Akko is dancing with the brooms.</br></br></br>  <br>That image is fanart.</br>      <br>Literally everyone leaves to go jerk off to Akko's ass. <br><br>Wasn't it from the trigger art book?</br></br></br>  Will Akko ever find out Ursula-sensei is her beloved Shiny Chariot?  Will they have sex?   <br>Akko is a lewd girl that likes to flaunt her booty around.</br>  <br>I bet the third movie will be about Shiny Chariot's backstory and Akko and Diana will finally see eye-to-eye in something.</br>  does anyone have a pic of the scene where Amanda does the broom dance and you can can briefly see her ass? Also, I hope this is popular enough to get made into a series    Was there color turn arounds for all the characters?<br>I need references badly.</br>  Is it me or is Diana kinda obsessed with Akko?  <br>if you look carefully, it becomes obvious that she is wearing panties</br>  <br>its you</br>  <br>Excuse the quality face.</br>  We need a TV series of this so we have more material to scour for loli witch asses.  Is Diana still voiced by the girl who voices Rias Gremory?  Best fucking $110 I ever spent. Thank you based Trigger.  Oh God, I'm super-duper excited and really want to watch it right now, but I'm dead tired.  So this isn't the BDs?    <br>is you</br>  if they are not going to do another kickstarter will they at least sell merch so I can throw money at them that way?  <br>ESPURR!<br>She reminds me of an Espurr. God, it's been bugging me since I watched it.</br></br>    <br>never ceases to amuse me</br>  <br>Yes, Yoko Hikasa.</br>  <br>Yeah, I would really love some LWA merch. I already bought the LWA1 BD off of Trigger's store, but it's not enough.</br>      Nendroid Petite LWA pack with Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Amanda, Constanze and secret Yasumineka.  <br>BEST</br>    <br>I want it!</br>      <br>Thanks nigga.</br>  <br>I want it. I want GSC to make some LWA nendos.</br>      Akko was kind of bitchy in part 2 but it's okay to have a bad day sometimes. <br>I still love you, girl.</br>    <br> that iMac on the left </br>  <br>That does make sense, as much as I don't like petites.<br><br>Gimme a Sucy scale with mushroom base.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't that bad. She got a little grating when she was being selfish about the whole parade, but she's a teenage girl and she's passionate. It happens.</br>  i want to have a ride on sensei's shiny chariot  <br>I still think they could have toned her down a bit</br>  <br>This. In the first half, it seemed almost out of character (compared to the first installment).</br>  The last moments of the episode just screamed Ooshima Michiru's work, so I wasn't surprised when I saw her name on the credits. Based Michiru, making the best soundtracks ever since SnW.   tfw I almost backed the kickstarter but an anon convinced me not to, because the business model was bad for the animation industry or something <br><br>Why was I so stupid</br></br>  <br>the one that did that folk music?</br>  <br>I wasn't able to back it because I had no money at the time. I would have gladly thrown dosh at the kickstarter for all the cool stuff if I had been able to.<br><br>Guess I'll just wait for the BD to be put up for sale.</br></br></br>  <br>Why was it stupid?<br>You got it for free.</br></br>  <br> folk music <br>What? All I know from Ooshima are these big orchestral stuff like you hear in Sora no Woto or LWA.</br></br>  <br>so what percentage of that outfit is life fibers</br>  The cutest witch.  I'm watching Enchanted parade right now. This stuff is Studio Ghibli tier in terms of story telling and near studio Ghibli tier in terms of animation.  <br>I want her to teach me how to dance.</br>  <br>So it's a convoluted mess that looks pretty?</br>  So, if they do a Kickstarter for Little Witch Academia 3, would you donate?<br><br>Assuming similar stretch goals and reward tiers, how much would you donate next time compared to what you donated this time?</br></br>  <br>She did apologize.</br>  <br>I would donate about $50</br>  <br>that fucking gif</br>  <br>I wouldn't go so far in terms of story telling, but I love the art style and it's very refreshing. Characters are also very varied and powerful. I was pleasantly surprised with everything in general. Would donate again for sure.</br>  I want her to tie me down with magic while she   insults my dick and then proceeds to rape me   Was it worth the money you put in?  <br>now that i have some money i will donate!!</br>  <br>Exceeded my expectations. <br>they should have focused on doing a series out of that instead of doing kill la kill imo. This has great potential to become a great series. A shame.</br></br>  I didn't know about this till today, the sticky made me curious and well, it was pretty good, even being that short the story and his little world envelops you, you really care for the characters even when you barely know them, I had a really good time. Is there going to be a full series about it? I would like to see that, all this have lots of potential for more.<br> Sucy best girl! </br>  <br><br><br>I was half reminded of Flash Dance with her routine and was expecting a bucket of water to be dumped on her at the end.</br></br></br>  <br>My nigro.<br>Sucy and Amanda, best girls by far.</br></br>  <br><br>My brothers!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br>I know that Luna means moon in latin, but what is Lana supposed to mean?

Do all artists have shit taste?</br>  <br>This is why trigger is one of my favorite.<br><br>They go off-model all of the time, and aren't afraid to do so.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd donate at least $50.</br>  <br><br> That old ass witch going wands akimbo </br></br>  <br>Stuck up bitches are a turn-off for me personally. Speaking as an artist. </br>  <br>I have faith about they'll make a full serie of this.<br>It was said two or three days ago that Trigger anounced a new anime original, maybe it's LWA.<br>Even if they don't make it we'll still have the Inferno Cop X LWA.</br></br></br>  <br>Lana is wool in italian and spanish, but I doubt it has any relation to it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br> not wanting Sucy's upside-down isosceles triangle body </br>  <br>Same here bro. I didn't know about this series until today either and i was completely drawn in.</br>  <br>Probably enough to get my name in the credits.</br>  <br> Yoshinari will never do a spinoff for his favorite LWA, Diana <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>I'm surprised there were people that haven't seen this yet.</br>  <br>That would be the best news in years. It has enough elements to become a very rich series with lots of stories. It could become an improved version of Shitty Potter.</br>  <br>good post<br><br><br>i commend</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Mah niggas</br></br></br>  Trigger said that they're working on 3 original things; the next original TV series (some sort of serious-looking show that has Persona-like character designs) a shorter thing for USPTime and another original that is farther on. Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 but for now fixes and retakes for the BD and theatrical release.  My personal ranking:<br><br>Sucy = Amanda &gt; Diana &gt; Akko &gt; the rest</br></br>  <br>It was everything I wanted, but even better than I expected it. Well worth it. Looking forward to the BD and the tons of extras I get with it even more now.</br>  <br>Amanda stole my heart, but that's not particularly dangerous.</br>  <br>She would be part of the main story in a third sequel; this movie set-up the seeds for her and Akko finally teaming up.</br>    <br>I'd rather draw Sucy  or lotte </br>  WIPs.<br>http://i.imgur.com/A7q6j16.png<br>http://i.imgur.com/AjoNZv3.png<br><br>Maybe do more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 <br>Really? I thought he wasn't too jazzed about LWA. IIRC he wanted to do a psychological drama thing.</br></br>  <br>He said it's still not the perfect LWA for him.</br>  <br> lewds of the LWAs <br>For what purpose</br></br>    <br>Doing God's work. Needs more Amanda and overall broom action.</br>  <br><br>Well, if LWA 3 is the Parent's Day it could have all the drama he'd want.</br></br>  <br> More Constance please. </br>  <br>Will /a/ save anime again with LWA3?</br>  <br>Funded in 3 hours or less this time.</br>  <br>Would be funny if the anime industry's western-like studios caught up with Kickstarter's possibilities by watching LWA and started competing for attention with great projects.

Trigger's track record isn't bad (KLK was a massive hit, Inou Battle was lukewarm, Ninja Slayer is a meme show on Niconico) but LWA is under most elevens' radar, so they'll have to depend on the West again if they decide to do more.</br></br>  <br>I think she  grew up .</br>  Anyone else like how Sucy is drawn without arms until she uses them for something  <br>Oh shit, you're right.</br>  <br>I really appreciate you namefagging, it's much easier to hit the button every time.<br><br><br>She matured.

Holy shit it was the best stuff I've seen in this year. Thanks everyone. Thanks based TRIGGER. <br><br>Also, LWA3 fucking when!?</br></br>  <br> or any quality Trigger content. <br>Just rewatch Kill la Kill :^)</br></br>  how long did trigger work on lwa2?  <br>2-3 years</br>   first line is an extremely subtle (to non Germans) intellectual reference <br>10000000/10 anime</br>  <br>wern't they doing other series between now and 2013?</br>  <br> implying Akko will let anyone else go after her <br>She was first and she won't move from there</br></br>  <br>After kisu.</br>  <br>Why would I do that to myself?</br>  Is it just me or the download link provided by Trigger doesn't work right now?  <br>For 2-3 years the product doesn't really show.</br>  <br> Why would I do that to myself? <br>You said you wanted quality trigger content</br></br>  <br>They weren't working on it every day for 2-3 years. The studio focused on other projects on the side.</br>  <br><br>It was way less because they were working on KLK and other animation projects for most of that time.</br></br>  <br>Not that kind of "quality"</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/BX1H948USbI?t=16  [ ]<br><br>there are also items that cause meteor showers, elemental explosions, cause floods, and in general cause natural-disaster levels of damage. atelier may be comfy but it knows when to step it up.</br></br></br>  <br>LWA is a love-letter kind of project that they can only afford to do to the side while the horridly panderish stuff like kill la kill and their other lesser products are done by word of mouth.<br><br>Watch the documentary for LWA1.<br>LWA is a project that they actually wanted to do and not one that they needed to do for the sake of having company-welfare. They had newbies work on it even.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Please, this god please.</br></br>  <br>You mean her one butler. Pause again.</br>  So /a/'s mods are Triggerfags?  Just finished watching the AotY. What a superb piece of work, and by TRIGGER no less...<br><br>I smiled, I almost cried, I was so engrossed in this OVA. <br><br>Stuff like this is why I watch anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>LWA is to Trigger as RSFWoH was to Gainax. <br><br>An all out in house production to showcase their technical abilities.</br></br></br>   know LWA3 won't be happening for at least another two years <br> already getting hype for it anyway <br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>what's it referencing</br>  <br>KLK might have seemed panderish but knowing Imaishi it was definitely heartfelt. It wasn't intended to make lots of money and they had plenty of risks associated with it.</br>  <br> lwa sequel is out <br>well fuck</br></br>  <br>who did klk pander to ?</br>   project manager <br>Confirmed for anti-NEET anime</br>  <br>More like Daicon IV.<br>Honneamise was a theatrical movie. It was a flop of a movie, but it was still more of a commercial product than the showcase of raw talent that the Daicon shorts were.</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck calls honneamaise as RSFWoH?</br>  <br>you wouldnt have given a shit about klk unless it had layers and layers of anime tiddy and all that pandering shit.<br><br>If they deployed the story in another handwriting that didnt involve some girl's ass or tits being on screen for 40% of any episode then you wouldnt have given a shit about it.</br></br></br>  <br>SJWs, normalfags, casuals, any buzzword that /a/ doesn't like this week.</br>  <br> Getting hype for show that wont come out for years. <br>It hurts just thinking about it.</br></br>  <br> GSC is the first logo we see <br> I hope you like figma </br></br>  <br>Newfags who think they need to abbreviate its full title.<br>Or NWTTNTAIFT.</br></br>  The music was too loud and too many scenes didn't have music at all. Felt kind of weird.  <br>Honestly, my opinion is that your style doesn't suite this show much at all. your anatomy is far too thick and muscly which is nothing like the film itself.</br>  <br>Royal space force sounds dumb<br>and i can't spell honeymayonnaise.</br></br>  <br>  Squid and shrimp on pizza <br>Why can't we get that at regular pizza places in the US?</br></br>  <br> too loud <br><br>Fuck meant "too low".</br></br></br>  <br>I liked KLK because it was a crazy, over-the-top parody of battle shonen with a vibrant cast of fun characters. I liked the anime breasts, but I liked them because they were comedic and made the experience even more ridiculous.</br>  Does anyone have the Inferno Cop/LWA crossover episode they showed?  KORE HA KUSO-ANIME DESU  <br>The sound itself was a little too loud.</br>  <br>Because it's disgusting.</br>  <br>Because there are many American faggots who would die if there's anything other than pepperoni on their Pizza. Hell, the best pizza I've ever had was in Normandy, had a ton of shit like potatoes and onions on it, but I haven't seen anywhere in America that would serve something like that. All we have here are the disgusting Chicago deep dish garbage.</br>  So as someone who didn't throw his shekels at the kickstarter, where can I get the blu rays of 1 and 2?  but where can i watch it  <br><br>I get a gut feeling that was whatever Imaishi wanted to do.</br></br>  <br>squid and shrimp are expensive</br>  <br>The annoying part is that even the non-chain pizza places in the US have pretty much the exact same menu as the chains. On the plus side, the chains are actually starting to branch out a bit. Pizza Hutt will put a balsamic vinegar reduction on your pizza now if you want and they even do white sauces.</br>  <br><br>Make her a mother bear-like character. Which she kind of already is.</br></br>  The whole thing was magical and I couldn't get the smile off my face the whole day. Worth every cent and I eagerly await more.  <br>The upside is that if you want to go out, you can find a decent wood fired place in pretty much any decent sized town, and they're likely to have decent specials on top of better options in general <br><br>So much of this acting like Murikka has shit food is just an ignorance of the options you have available</br></br></br>  <br> I eagerly await more <br>When asked about whether there would be a third LWA, the director said he hoped so. So nothing in the works yet.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I actually really like Papa Johns, I just wish that some more actual restaurants would branch out more with their pizzas. Even places that let you choose your own toppings don't have anything that you wouldn't find at any ordinary place.</br>  <br><br>not<br> you're gonna carry that luggage </br></br></br>  <br>my nigga that was the shit<br>as in it was shit</br></br>  <br>there's a will</br>  <br>First episode can still be bought from Trigger's online store: http://trigger-global.ecq.sc/lwa-bl<wbr>uray01.html<br><br>Second episode will probably be there as well when it is available.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>A will without kikestarter money is useless. I doubt the sponsors would be willing to give them the money to do another 50 minute OVA either.</br>  <br> The music was too loud and too many scenes didn't have music at all. Felt kind of weird. <br>They haven't finished production yet, that might be why</br></br>  <br><br>inb4 Jeff Goldblum image</br></br>  <br>All we have here are the disgusting Chicago deep dish garbag. Found your problem.<br><br>not to say I don't appreciate non-traditional pizza (goat cheese and artichoke is some 10/10 shit). But I think pep pizza is pretty damn good as it is.</br></br></br>  This was so good.<br><br>There were a few cool references thrown in, too. <br><br>I hope Trigger makes this their next project after Ninja Slayer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Futafags need to be wiped out.</br>  <br>Will have to buy that when I get a bit more shekels. The shipping kills.</br>  ANON TRIO'S JAPANESE ADVENTURE WHEN<br>ANON TRIO'S JAPANESE ADVENTURE WHEN<br>ANON TRIO'S JAPANESE ADVENTURE WHEN</br></br>  Does anyone have a link?  <br><br> Are these the eyes of mercy Akko? <br><br> You won't get any sleep tonight </br></br></br></br>  <br>I would prefer more OVAs than episodes tbh.</br>  <br><br>It's true, I looked.</br></br>  <br>I'm sure if Trigger out-right said on Kickstarter "we can make a LWA3, but it'll take $20K/minute because you guys are funding everything," they can get $1m.</br>  <br> 1 mil <br>I think that's pushing it, even for /a/'s autism.</br></br>  <br><br> not cauldron <br><br>Trigger, you had one job.</br></br></br></br>  So I guess this proves LWA takes place in the UK?

Holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything he makes is adorable. I wish I was like him.</br>  everything is good in this ep except that sausage  So just watched the EP. That was some pretty good shit. Cure Scarlet looked a whole lot better than I thought, and her legs, thighs, ears and shoulder blades are awesome. I liked the tactical beamspam too.  3DS  http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>37538</wbr>  <br>So did this have an action RPG segment that I saw?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mJY<wbr>fV4fG8SE</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Playing Doki on my 2ds. Which precure game for 3ds are the best?</br>      What are these two idiots doing?  <br> Only has the popular cures and their outfits </br>  <br>So it is basically a precure form of this</br>    Precure's CG is reaching the point of being completely indistinguishable from hand drawn animation. <br><br>The second ED is going to be fucking God like.</br></br>  <br>It looked just like the rest of the finishers i.e., shit</br>  I missed the livestream, is it going to be restreamed or up on Himado soon?<br><br>How was the episode?</br></br>  <br>To the untrained eye maybe but most of us still could tell it was CG. I showed some casual friends the first ED of GoPri and they didn't believe me when I said it was CG.</br>  <br>They can afford to put more budget into the CGI because it's stock footage they reuse every episode. If the whole show was in CGI it wouldn't be on the same level.<br><br>2D is still superior anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>shit</br>  <br>It was atsui.</br>  <br> showing your friends precure </br>  <br><br>As someone who also missed the live stream is the show down another villain ?</br></br>  <br>twilight is gone</br>  Happy 4th of July everybody. I hope you're enjoying the fireworks. It's too bad this lovely cat doesn't seem to enjoy her fireworks show. They do look kind of weird though, almost psychedelic. You didn't do anything bad, did you /pc/?  <br>I want to not salt-nagisa's licky eyebrows.</br>  GoPri subs when?  <br>This has to be one of the prettiest shots in GoPri so far.</br>  <br>Why is Twilight/Towa fanart so cute?</br>  <br>gap</br>  <br><br>Well I don't consider that a loss really. <br><br>I thought Shut or Lock were going to be taken out or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I finally looked up what that was. Now I understand.<br><br>Iona was the same way though and I don't remember her getting art/comics like this.</br></br></br>  Cutest Red.  <br>There are some big TVs in the an open area at school and I watch precure on those everyone knows I watch precure. I've even had some people come see it out of curiosity and they liked it.   Seems like my pic of me watching precure on those TVs is gone so no photo. <br><br>When I showed the ED to my friends was for my 3D modelling class was showing them what I wanted to accomplish for my project.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you live in some third world country? If you were in the US you'd become the school's rapemonkey.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  This week's action was definitely awesome, even if it wasn't visually ridiculous. That whole sequence with the out-of-stock attacks got me so hype. One echoed voice after another, feeling like they were really pulling out all the stops for it.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KNE<wbr>_aC0R5uU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>There was also less QUALITY than I would expect from an action-oriented episode. Toei seems to actually be trying to make up for HaCha.</br>  <br>I'm on her post-transform fight with Dyspear right now and it's nothing completely jawdropping but the whole sequence of her parrying the shadows was definitely cool.</br>  http://himado.in/279406  <br><br><br><br>Marry me, Towa!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  I figured Nao's spotlight episode would be about her family but I definitely wasn't expecting that to happen.  So is it likely they're going to un-corrupt someone else ?  Daww, geez. This is actually kind of cute, in a semi-suicidal kind of way. But then I suppose it's only a giant apple monster.  This shit is 2utsukushii4me.  <br><br>I love Japanese comments.</br></br>  <br>heh</br>  <br><br>So she got beat down by the Koolaid Man's cousin ?</br></br>  <br>That walk was way yasashiku</br>  Good gravy, they really ratcheted up the pain for March, didn't they. The others didn't go through anything nearly this agonizing.<br><br><br>Oh yeah!</br></br></br>  This makes the regular Precure Kick look pretty pathetic. She's not wall-to-wall superpowered or anything, but I guess she gets to have her badassed moment just like everyone else.  <br>I don't want to be edgy or anything, but Smile has some of the best despair moments in the franchise.</br>  I'm going to marry Haruharu!  <br>Oh hey I found them.</br>  I'm not sure this is a winning plan, but okay.<br><br><br>Oh yeah, Joker has largely been responsible for turning up the despair, but the leadup to midseason, his big evil episode (in that mirror world) and this were all pretty vicious.</br></br></br>   that crazy animation on cure scarlet's fight <br><br>Are the fights on this one like that all the time? Last PreCure I even tried to watch was Smile and it was awful. I watched the entirety of Fresh too and that left me with brain damage from how bad it was.</br></br>  <br><br>She looks oddly similar to Nui Harime from Kill La Kill at times.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say ALL the time, but pretty damn often.</br>  <br>I'm going to pafu Pafu's pafus!</br>  <br>GoPri has had the best fights of Precure</br>    The one who attracted more random viewers was Smile well before they remodeled the building with the new TVs so they watched from my laptop.<br><br>HaCha didn't do that well and I haven't had a chance to watch GoPri on those screens yet.</br></br>  <br><br>You don't watch Fresh for the animation.</br></br>  <br><br>Who is that ?</br></br>  <br><br>Our lord and savior.</br></br>  <br>FUCK<br><br><br>I was gonna ask if the generic monster fights were also that much exciting.<br><br>HOW THE FUCK IS THE ANIMATION SO GOOD?? Woah, I really feel like watching this. The thing with the other shows is that they barely even fought and just used their stock footage finishing move to one-hit everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't watch it for the animation, most certainly. It was just boring tbh, outside a few Cure Passion episodes. The monster of the week stuff on it was pretty bland, the villains where also not good. <br><br>I know "complaining about MOTW on precure" and all but HeartCatch was really fun.</br></br></br>  <br> HOW THE FUCK IS THE ANIMATION SO GOOD?? <br>They saved up budget from simple HaCha art and animation.</br></br>  <br> Smile! <br> awful <br>Shit taste detected.</br></br></br>  Isn't this just like Reika. Her episode, but everyone else gets upset, mindbroken, beat up and embarrassed.<br><br>I'm just kidding, of course, he's being plenty mean to her. But they definitely worked hard at playing up this psychological angle with Joker, some times are definitely better than others though.<br><br><br>Par for the course is good, there have only been a few truly unremarkable fights. But as you can probably see, when it's good, it's really, really good.<br><br><br>You watch it for the boobies?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I know "complaining about MOTW on precure" and all but HeartCatch was really fun. <br>I'll never get you people. HC had more victim of the week filler shit than any other Precure.</br></br>    <br>For the humor, story, characters, villains, and everything else.</br>  <br>The thing is that HC did it right. It was just a better show overall. The characters where all very interesting and had more unique personalities so watching them in all kinds of situations was fun. Heck, you had a girl who dresses like a boy on that. Fresh for example was extremely boring, everything on it was cliche.</br>      <br>I feel like the artstyle has a big part in why everyone sees it like that.</br>  <br>So just to give you an idea, this is the prettiest shot from an otherwise pretty typical episode. The fighting isn't always over the top, it's often quite simple, but they've done a good job of sexing up little moments. I'd say there's a webm-worthy shot like this in about half of the episodes, maybe slightly more.<br><br>The truly amazing sequences come from more important episodes. That motw looking one was the premier, the 3-on-1 was the introduction of that villain, and today was the end of the midseason climax.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So let me get this straight they're being menaced by a Death Note reject, Wallace and the thin version of Porky Minch who all summon the Koolaid Man's extended family as familiars to do their bidding ?</br></br>  <br> erika <br> itsuki <br> yuri <br> interesting </br></br></br></br>  <br> just because I don't like it, it means it's shit <br>When you can get people that usually dislike magical grl anime since they're "all the same" to watch HC and enjoy it, you know it's something special.<br><br>There's a lot of stuff in there that breaks conventions.</br></br></br></br>  This is such a distinctive style for the close-ups, with the big thick outlines (just like the earlier shot with Happy) and it seems to come up very rarely, but I remember seeing it once or twice in Suite as well. Is that the trademark of a particular director or animator or something?<br><br><br>Did we mention this was a kid's show?</br></br></br>  <br>Aside from the animation GoPri's fight choreography has been really neat too, they do a lot of little teamwork moments in most fights.</br>  <br>Anyone has the full version of this Minamin fight?</br>  Who is the best girl and why is it C^2?  Yes, yes, it was her.<br>Everyone loves her.</br>  <br>obviously C.C.<br>nobody has ever argued other wise</br></br>  <br>Man I was tired of cc threads when Geass was airing.</br>  <br>Well yeah, that's her power.</br>  I hate pizza though.  Because ass  <br>Is...<br>Is that official art?</br></br>  Anyone else here like C.C. for her personality and not her body?"]  <br>Reminds me of Yahari Oregairu threads now</br>  <br>Indeed it is</br>   C.C will never cuck you <br>Why even bother</br>  So how do you eat your pancakes /a/?<br><br> I eat mine with only butter </br></br>  <br>I eat mine with chopsticks</br>  Maple Syrup.<br>There is no other way.</br>  Not with syrup that's for sure because I'm not an amerifat that needs to cover everything with sugar  <br>Isn't the syrup supposed to cover the pancake?</br>  With semen.  <br>Plain.</br>  <br>I guess this makes sense. Seems like an odd thing to go out of your way to explain to someone though.</br>   HOTTOKEIKEE not stacked neatly <br><br>TRIGGERED</br></br>  <br>Syrup.<br>Peanut Butter is also good.</br></br>  <br>I don't because I'm not a shameless fatman</br>  I don't remember the last time I had pancakes  <br> eating makes you a fatty <br>I forgot /a/ was full of starving students and third worlders</br></br>  I don't eat breakfast.  Small amount of butter and just a little simple syrup drizzled over it them.  <br>She stacks them after giving them an even coating of syrup.<br>She's got OCD when it comes to pancakes.</br></br>  <br>Only butter... <br>You monster</br></br>  Honey.  I only eat the frozen ones, I put them in the toaster until they are crispy and eat them plain like toast.  <br>You know that's not good for you, right?</br>  Yogurt  <br>Eating pancakes with butter is fatmanfood though. <br><br>I just eat mine with strawberry jam. It's not the healthiest choice but neither are pancakes.</br></br></br>  <br>Lighly salted butter and sweet pancakes, right?</br>  <br> plain like toast <br>but you put butter on toast</br></br>  <br>Yes, I do. But I just don't have an appetite, and it's physically painful for me to eat it.</br>  <br>True, I meant more that I eat them with my hands rather than a knife and fork.</br>   putting three pancakes on top of each other <br><br>Literally retarded. I eat one pancake at a time to savor it.</br></br>  <br> physically painful <br>No it fucking isn't. Stop overexaggurating.</br></br>  <br>They put syrup on them. The point she's making is if you spread the butter across then the syrup will cover the pancakes instead of just soaking in wherever it lands.</br>  With chocolate syrup and nothing more.  This is really making me want some pancakes.  <br>I don't eat pancakes because they make you fat. Instead I eat protein milkshakes for maximum gains.</br>  With strawberry syrup and a sliced up banana.   not putting jam on your pancakes   <br> not having a bowl of steel cut oats for breakfast everyday </br>  <br>In epidemiology it's correlated with unhealthy behaviours, but there's nothing unhealthy about intermittent fasting when done properly.</br>  Melted dark chocolate, whipped cream and strawberry jam.  <br>this</br>  <br>Crepes aren't pancakes.</br>  <br> eating pancakes <br><br>It's just not worth it for the amount of calories. 440 calories for 2 small pancakes with maple syrup.</br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes I do eat steel cut oats for breakfast but most of the time I try to avoid them.

You could eat a healthy breakfast and take a walk or you could eat a dozen sugarladen pancakes and go for a run. You can't blame people for picking the first choice. <br><br>Also, it's really bad to eat sugary foods for breakfast.

And its not like Americans are the only people to eat big breakfasts.</br>  <br>Where on that site does it say anything about energy levels due to skipping breakfast? All I can see is "7. Myth: Skipping breakfast is bad and will make you fat." which is not what we where talking about here. <br><br>I can guarantee you that I have less energy in the morning before I eat breakfast and so do the people I meet in the morning.

I'm on a cut and they always make me hungry.</br>  <br>But apparently the Americans are the only people who synynoms big breakfasts with greacy shit...</br>  <br> americans </br>  <br>Few people eat pancakes every day. It's a pain to cook a full breakfast and the cleanup is annoying. <br><br>Having pancakes once every few weeks and will not destroy a diet or undo weeks of exercise.</br></br></br>  <br>No really, explain it to me. Do people think that when they have a cake after dinner that they will pick up 5kg or what? The log of shit they push out in the morning is heavier than the food they ate.</br>  <br>i don't eat pancakes. disgusting carb and sugar bombs are for fatties like OP</br>  <br>And no one claimed it did. What the fuck are you on?</br>  <br>Never seen an English breakfast?<br>Greasy as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Eating like shit with no exercise will make you fat over time, yes. Not everyone has fast metabolisms, I'd even argue that most people don't, judging by America's obesity rates.</br>  Pancakes are a "treat" here and not a staple because they are an "empty calories" type food. <br><br>I don't put syrup on them because they get soggy fast. I never liked eating anything "soggy" or with a soggy texture such as risotto, soggy pancakes, porridge, etc. I like foods to be either dry or chewy. <br><br><br> I only eat the frozen ones, I put them in the toaster until they are crispy and eat them plain like toast. <br><br>I had no idea you could do that. I lower the heat on the griddle (it has multiple heat sections) and move the pancakes over to the low heat section. That way, I toughen them up a little so they are drier and stiffer without burning. That way, the outsides are actually crispy stiff for the first minute or so off the griddle.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically every white country eats like that, I wouldn't expect a third world nigger like you to understand.<br><br>See </br></br></br>  <br> Peanut Butter is also good. <br><br>People put peanut butter on their pancakes?

Anything would be appreciated, though since it's the 4th of July weekend a drawing of Mai eating a hot dog would be fitting.

I salute you....</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's pretty shit.

She has to go be a figurehead princess.<br><br>I have no idea where the bit from the last chapter came from where a crowd of people demanded the old king take back his crown because of his devotion to pacifism. Doffy never took Dressrossa to war.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if Monet is next.And how high are the chances for that?You do the math.<br><br>Future strawhat members are always obvious or foreshadow.Even Robin during her very debut.<br><br>I am certain we'll get a new Nakama.<br>Who that'll be?<br>The one which Oda for some reason was showing with a suitcase already.<br>I'm really not a big fan of Bart.He's cool, but I can't get to really like him as long as he's fanboying so hard.Would get annoying with time if he joins.But I am certain he's top candidate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you just did<br><br>Pink Ace a delicious</br></br></br>  <br>I think they are real,I have the localized manga and there's the heart,I doubt official translators would fuck around</br>  <br>Who checks in on them though?

He's just a fan of the SHs has his own crew anyway.

Hasn't the only dude who never used the I NEED YOU shit on her been Doffy anyway?</br>  Reminder that Doffyfags got btfo<br><br>go into the archive and find a post made by a doffyfag than laugh at him for being epic BTFO</br></br>  <br>bb infiltrating a shichibukai doesn't make sense?</br>  Will Fuji give Luffy/Law time to party?  <br> Mihawk: practically adds another Admiral to the Marine forces, bad against Shanks <br> another Admiral <br><br>Not this shit again</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you think she's the only Doffy crew member who didn't get defeated?<br>Pottery, anon.</br></br>  <br>Didn't baby 5 overcome his shit with Sai? Lao G was praising her all over the fight and yet she remained faithful to her husbando.</br>  <br>Surely Mihawk is stronger than Doflamingo. And doflamingo is only just below an admiral. Mihawk has to be at the very least admiralish in strength.<br><br/></br></br>  <br> implying a big antagonist in a shounen manga wouldn't get wrecked in a big battle where everybody uses FRIENDSHIP to dogpile them <br>I mean I love me some Mingo but it was obvious Luffy/Law were gonna win from the start.</br></br>  <br>Rebecca has nothing to do with Aikido. Aikido is an actual cool fighting style that can fuck up badly your opponent , Rebecca is just "dodge and make him trip".</br>  <br>law didnt win though, he lost</br>   I won't let Strawhat and Law do as they please <br><br> meanwhile in Dressrosa <br><br><br>Oh Akainu ;-;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stronger than <br> just below <br> powerlevels faggotry <br><br>Not this shit again, pls.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Powerlevel faggotry will always be in these threads along with tumblr</br>  <br>It would depend entirely on Mihawk being able to outdo Conqueror's haki/cut the strings and Doffy being able to attach strings to him without his noticing or in such a way he can control Mihawk's swings. It'd probably come down to Mihawk's speed vs. Doffy's haki.<br><br>I don't know if they'd even fight though, they seem to have some kinda BFF club bracelets.</br></br></br>  <br>along with tripfags</br>  <br>You'll be surprised, plenty of anons thought he was going to outplay Kaidou and escape Dressrosa harmless.</br>  For being the world's best swordsman, there were a considerable number of people who could outright deflect his attacks<br><br>Hell Croc knocks the sword aside with the base of his hook. Where does that put Crocodile, powerwise?</br></br>  <br> Fuck up opponent badly <br> Fighting style focusing on protecting your opponent <br> Creator envisioned a style with the philosophy of peace,compassion and love by harmlessly redirecting the momentum <br>Anon, you crazy?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That'd be somewhat unbelievable--however, I wouldn't put it past Doffy to have switched himself out with a string clone, collapsed his birdcage to make it look like he was out and escaped, I suppose.</br>  <br>I believe Mihawk can go toe to toe with an Admiral when it comes to swordmanship alone, but at least the original trio showed way more than that, i believe they are the most complete fighters in the OP world.</br>  <br>Fuji seems like the type of guy who'd be down for relaxing if someone put a mug of beer in his hands</br>  <br>Buggy vs. Mihawk is a fight i'd like to see.</br>  <br>Just because it's focused on self defense it doesn't mean it can't hurt anyone. Did you ever see an aikido fight?</br>  <br> manga with constant battles <br> not allowed to talk about fighting <br><br>How about that ussop x nami pairing guys<br><br><br>Oda did mihawk a disservice putting him in Marineford. Or maybe that's the way he wanted it to be so when he actually does fight it looks that much spectacular. <br><br>Look at how easy the new world has been for Zoro and we KNOW Mihawk is still better than him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuji have no marine mentality of "muh justice", he judge people based on his actions precisely because before Marineford he was just some strong ass civilian.</br>  <br>?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jeW<wbr>SXuxfc7g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I think I just assumed that Issho was Blind Justice then</br>  <br>Is not that i dislike fights, but OP is more about rock paper scissors and whatever Oda feels like, Croc (entry "level" villian) did fought a serious Mihawk (end game guy) and managed to get ok from that.</br>  Man, besides Kid, I don't know what villain I'm actually looking forward to anymore.<br><br>Pretty much everyone else has been ruined already. I wish the Doffyfags had been right. He was at least fun.</br></br>  <br>Marineford did a LOT of characters no favors<br><br>I STILL can't decide whether or not Jozu was actually weak or gimped by the plot</br></br></br>  So when Doflamingo comes to how do you think he'll act?<br><br>He got his entire life's work obliterated in a day or two by a rubber dildo of a person and his own wayward protege.<br><br>On top of that all the people Sugar zapped into being toys are up and running and a lot of forgotten shit he did is now remembered, which is probably a fuckton.</br></br></br></br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  <br>Probably cracks a pun about being strung up.</br>  <br>Plot. Its almost always plot</br>  <br>Watch  Bobbin  be the hardest fight the SHs have had to endure since the timeskip<br><br> boyoyoyon~ </br></br></br>  <br><br>Jozu is/was a generic lughead character that's only good for direct smashing shit and gets played by any other character with at least half a brain.<br><br>The only interesting thing about him is his fruit.<br><br>WB had entire crews and commanders full of obvious jobbers.<br><br>Even Marco with his fancy ass fruit power managed to do fuck all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lucy! <br>His name is Luffy dammit. What captain wants a person in his crew who doesn't even remember his name??</br></br>   one piece threads are being fucked by tripfags <br>You guys did it, you're worse scum than narutards</br>  <br> covers eyes so it remains a mystery <br> FUFUFUFUFU....to imagine that brat would be able to defeat me.... <br><br>I don't think the marines will be able to keep ahold of him, somehow. He probably has a contingency plan that means what he knows about the thing in Mariejois that kept him in favour with the WG will be released if he doesn't get out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll be one of the first main support characters for an arc that won't even get asked to join.</br>  <br>Rebecca doesn't even want to fight. Her joining the Straw Hats would be retarded. Se has no reason to leave Dressrosa now that her father came back.<br><br>The next female companion needs to be a real hardass, not a crybaby. IT would be great if she was member of Kaido's crew and the only reason she joined was to kill him. I'd like her to be just sa brutal as Robin during the Alabasta days.<br><br>Also I'd be fine with Bartolomeo joining too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that a joke?</br>  <br> Strongest was an ant <br><br>I think you will find the strongest in HxH was in fact cell from dragonball Z.</br></br></br>  <br>Me neither. I miss Doffy and Croc and if Kid is going to end up a villain he's undoubtly going to get his ass kicked, too.<br> mfw Kid ends up in jail </br></br>  <br> Even Marco with his fancy ass fruit power managed to do fuck all. <br><br>hey now hey<br><br>Marco is a Tank not a DPS</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Viola is a hardass. You think they gave her that scene where she stood up to doffy for no reason?</br>  <br><br>I think it's kinda obvious that the ship carrying him to Impel will get intercepted by Kaido so we get an introduction to him and see just how much he outclasses Doffy and his captors.</br></br>  <br> So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. <br>I'm so sick of people, usually tripfags, insisting that everyone automatically agrees with their bullshit headcanon.</br></br>  Reminder that luffy is eager to recruit people in the new world  <br>Strong people<br><br>Rebecca isn't fucking strong.</br></br></br>  <br> Jozu is/was a generic lughead character <br><br>Why are all the big guys like this? Can't we get a smart giant for once? Here's hoping Jean Bart is good for more than close combat</br></br></br>  <br>Viola's gonna want to stay in Dressrosa with her family. Besides, Usopp's haki makes her a little redundant.</br>  <br><br>He already asked Kinemon's ass when he stumbled onto it to join so I'm guessing Kinemon will join after Wano is over.<br><br>Also Oda really oddly gave Kinemon an interesting fruit that's good for endless gags and such a fruit would be wasted on some disposable character so I'm guessing Kinemon will end up sailing away with strawhats once Wano is wrapped up.</br></br></br></br>  Post YFW you realized Kuina was still alive  <br>The biggest problem with Marineford is that oda would have had to reveal too much shit but he wanted to keep under raps<br><br>No one went niggamode<br><br>No one used awakened fruits(?)<br><br>The way Akainu survived an onslaught of Haki users was left ambiguous. Mihawk sat around being cool with his only real damage to anyone deflecting a buggy ball. Almost all of the top tiers should be capable of soru level speeds but they remained pretty stationary because it would hard to draw it. <br><br>It was an ambitious call to draw a high level war but it left more questions than answers. It was like a teaser for the end of series war that seems prone to happen rather than how destructive it should have been.<br><br>We've seen more high level fruit powers and terrain altering from dressrosa than we did in Marineford. Look at Birdcage and Pika's powers and that's only two people<br><br>Law sliced a Castle in half the same way Mihawk did the iceberg and he isn't nearly as capable. There should have been a shitload of pirates and marines capable of doing things like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So if Doffy is captured by the marines, Kaido would presumably attack the marines or even storm Impel Down just to kill him right?<br><br>At least that's what Oda has made it seem like.</br></br>  <br>Luffy having CoA made zoros swords redundant.</br>  Can all of you please turn their trips on? I don't like it when everyone copies me and calls himself anonymous  <br><br>Jean Bart seems like a lughead too.<br><br>Whatshisface giant supernova winged guy looks competent enough.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry but what's so bad about being a tripfag? Some of them post really good discussion topics.</br>  <br>Doffy hauled ass when challenged by aokiji and fuji, its safe to assume doffy is no where near admiral level <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127585 </br>  <br>Didn't uroge get shown losing to someone? Have we seen him since then?</br>  <br>All of the supernovas survived kizaru's warmup</br>  <br>Yes sir, you are correct, only acceptable tripfaggotry is by the OP, because the OP is already a giant faggot.</br>  <br> obligatory "hurrrrrr you worse than narutards post" </br>  <br> simply because of the zoro/kuina shippers that will probably resurface </br>    <br>That's a stupid comparison, Zoro is powerful enough to pull his own with the SH and is necessary to back Luffy up, since he can't take on big bads AND their best henchmen alone. Plus Luffy sure as hell can't cut anything. Viola is weak as fuck and her only useful power can just be filled in by Usopp's haki.</br>  <br>He was literally asking everyone in punk hazard, luffy DOES not give a fuck if his crew is all fodder he wants to protect them</br>  <br>Yah you are right, last we saw uroge was the old witch offering to sell him umbrellas on the always lightning island.</br>  <br>You just looked for an excuse to post Stannis.</br>  Why are people saying urouge is pat of blackbeards crew? We saw no interaction with urouge or BB  <br>Law mentioned kaido taking out his anger on them instead </br>  How can I become a trip?  <br>I thought Law specifically said that they couldn't kill Doffy or else Kaido would turn against them.</br>  <br>in the end he didn't gave a shit anymore <br>hence the gamma knife</br></br>  <br> That's a stupid comparison, Viola is powerful enough to pull her own with the SH and is necessary to back ussop up, since he can't take on big bads AND their best henchmen alone. Plus Luffy sure as hell can't see anything. Barto is weak as fuck and his only useful power can just be filled in by a metal shield. <br><br>I too can spout total bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>More like Viola<br><br><br> implying Luffy won't stick his dick in before Usopp can do anything </br></br></br></br>  <br> Viola is powerful enough to pull her own with the SH <br><br>I mean I like Viola but no</br></br></br>  <br>What was even the point of Gaimon and his stupid animals? Unless he somehow miraculously ties with Kaidou his arc is no different from an anime filler, which he won't since he found some pussy on the island so he ain't leaving anytime soon.</br>  <br>Nope. Luffy will ask Barto, which will send him into a coma for the rest of the series.</br>  <br>Viola beat sanji. Viola stood up to doffy, something shared with only luffy, tinsoldier, and law.</br>  (Username##password)<br><br>It's as easy as that <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think that Law thought he wouldn't be able to kill Doffy since Doffy was so powerful so the only way to truly take him down is to wreck his business which would cause Kaido to come down hard on Doffy, thus doing the job for him.<br><br>Seeing what Doffy was capable of that reasoning makes sense.<br><br>Law just didn't count on Luffy actually being so powerful.<br><br>That's also a bit contrived. Law and Luffy have an alliance and neither really knew what the other's peak power is. If both of them new beforehand they could easily bumrush Doffy, use gamma knife/shambles and G4 and take him down fast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127587702 <br>But moot isn't there anymore, so who will teleport me into the cyber world?</br>  <br>No that's using a trip, but I want to be one. I want to be a trip.</br>  Rebecca won't join. She wants to finally spend time with her father.<br><br>Viola won't join for two reasons. She's finally reunited with her family AND her power directly contradicts Strawhat's way of exploring which is stumbling around into adventure. The only role she might have in the crew is a spotter and Strawhats are too erratic to give a shit about knowing what to do exactly. They prefer to disembark and do unplanned stuff anyway.<br><br>Not to mention that Riku, Kyros, Rebecca and Viola need to stay behind to help with the rebuilding. It's not in their character to simply up and leave after the entire country has been reduced to rubble.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Start eating paint chips, but you need to make sure they were from from a place painted in the 70's or earlier.<br><br>That is the true source of trips power.</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy + Law team up isn't even fair<br><br>If they actually had any practice not sure how you beat them</br></br></br>  <br> female character beat sanji. <br>Stop the Presses!<br><br> Viola stood up to doffy <br>and...?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Something that could be said about Law+anyone. Law should be a support, not trying to be a mainline fighter. He was absolute shit, baring gamma knife, until he started counting on luffy for everything, and just doing swap tricks.</br>  <br><br>you would beat them by reacting faster to Law's disorienting shambles teleportation + having haki strong enough to tank Luffy's hits</br></br>  <br> Sanji spent 2 years on faggotland <br> thinks he doesn't have a faggot mode </br></br>  <br> headcanon instead of actual point <br><br>i'm a little insulted to be honest.

People are getting more attention than me  <br><br>Leave.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Rebecca does not strike people, Rebecca just lets people fall.

Maybe Nami, too.</br>  <br>Big Mom likes sucrose based foods mostly, just make a mud cake and her taste buds will overload.</br>  <br> O: Oops, this one‚Äôs from the same person as the last one. This is a good question though, so I‚Äôll answer it. When I drew Sanji vs Kalifa (Chapter 403), some people lauded Sanji‚Äôs stance, and some people felt sorry for him. The truth is, I didn‚Äôt really want to write those lines. Sanji doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù of not kicking women; the truth is that he actually CAN‚ÄôT kick them. He is a very proud man. I think he was really frustrated at that. I think Nami recognized that, and chose to praise him for once. It‚Äôs a scene that I hope will resonate with male readers, but everyone‚Äôs free to take it as they wish. Also, Zeff is just a man among men. <br><br>He canNOT fight women. It's not a code or choice. He canNOT</br></br></br>  <br> the only contact sanji has with women is when they beat on him <br><br><br>We have to assume this isn't taking place in shounen.<br><br>Luffy doesn't care about sex that's canon. Robin has most definitely had sex. So has franky. zoro has put everything into training but is still attracted to women. He is 50/50<br><br>Usopp probably banged whats her face at least once or experimented with her even with her sickness.<br><br>Nami has had sex even if people think she is a virgin she needed to earn money for Arlong and it would have been her best way of making berries outside of stealing.<br><br><br>Chopper, Zoro, Luffy and Sanji are the virgins. Sanji posttimeskip is no longer a virgin.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not including Luffy, the permavirgin </br>  <br> causing her to pass out from how delicious he is. <br> pass out from how delicious he is <br> delicious he is <br><br>S-sanji pls...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hancock got the Will of the D. up her VJJ?</br>  <br>I agree. Hence why it is canon and fact when I say viola beat sanji. I am not the sanji faggot, I am the one saying he got beat.</br>  <br> Sanji posttimeskip is no longer a virgin. <br>He almost died from a hug, dude is a mega virgin</br></br>  <br> his only contact with women is when they beat on him <br><br>Holy shit, I am now really sad because I realize this is absolutely true.</br></br></br>  <br>oh well in that case<br/></br>  <br>except viola</br>  <br>He meant his butt got fucked hard in Okama island.</br>  <br><br><br>Daily reminder we canonical saw Sanji give into the okamas.

They'll come to some understanding and never have a serious fight</br>  <br>Chopper and Zoro. Maybe Usopp.</br>  <br>Wait, forgot Sanji.</br>  <br>Probably, since the dressrosa outfit is kinemon magic. He'll probably have to fight a young Kuina clone too.</br>  Zoro seems like he's not a virgin, but he also seems like he's really uninterested in doing the do and would have to think about swords or concentrate the whole time to keep an erection.  <br>have you considered that maybe not everyone is as obsessed with sex as you are?</br>  <br>Zoro wrecks Kine in mere seconds.<br> one of the best fights </br></br>  <br>Rebecca can beat opponents without hurting them only because she's in a specific environment that allows her to do so,are you retarded? She can't do it in any place that isn't a ring surrounded by water and so can't Sanji with women.</br>  <br>I am convinced Kinemon has the Mythological Kitsune fruit and would put up a better fight than he lets on <br><br> epithet is fox fire </br></br></br>   Trebol survived <br> Monet and Vergo are dead <br><br>Why Oda</br></br></br>  <br>because trebol didn't took a nuke to the face</br>  <br> Maybe Usopp <br> Maybe <br><br>You have to be kidding me.

I can see him fucking Kaya.</br>  <br>They aren't, wanna bet?</br>  <br>and how the fuck does that make a difference in him fulfilling his dreams?</br>  <br> I forgot kaya exists <br><br>We can tell anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Personally I won't go into DF speculations and only work with what I have seen so far. But sure, while Zoro is figuring out how to deal with Kinemon's attacks and powers, that would take some time, but shortly after, then it's insta wreck. As far as I recall, great many of Zoro's fights were kind of like that: struggle, struggle, instant finish (I am thinking of Pica and Mr 1)</br>  <br>No, the next (and last) female to join will be from Wano.</br>  How strong do you think Sanji is at his maximum right now?<br><br>Bear in mind he's probably hiding his okama mode where he gets a huge power boost.<br><br>vice-admiral level? admiral level?<br><br>I'm guessing he's somewhere at Diamante's level or at Vergo's level if he activated his okama mode.<br>I'm also assuming hes proficient at haki hardening except we haven't seen him use it fully yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mihawk<br>Kuma<br>Crocodile<br>Doflamingo<br>Hancock<br>Jimbei<br>Moria<br><br>is my Warlord strength ranking right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doflamingo would trash Crocodile</br>  <br><br>Doubt it.<br>If anyone will join from Wano it will either be Kinemon or the little dragon-kid as a cabin boy.<br><br>Kinemon joining would offer up a variety of disguise related gags for Oda to exploit. Also he has a personality that lends itself well to overacting.<br><br>Momo joining means the crew has a mythical zoan user and also when they meet Vegapunk there's additional exposition there as Vegapunk recognizes the fruit he artificially created offering us more info on how that works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm thinking Croc and Doof are more or less equal. Croc can go sandmode but Doffy can probably fucking attach a string to each grain of sand.</br>   sanji fags have gone full circle and now take his humiliation as a powerup   <br>Crocodile was one of the weaker warlords to my understanding. What made him strong was that he always put himself at advantage by living in a desert where his powers are plentiful and his weaknesses are few.</br>  <br>Okama tend to be powerful in OP, so it's definitely gonna be a powerup. A really terrible powerup that will end up being an even worse bounty poster for him.</br>  <br><br>We can't gauge his true power.<br><br>As someone who traveled to the New World he should be proficient in haki to some extent yet he showed no demonstration of it.<br><br>His logia use is highly proficient. He had his head lopped off and it didn't even phase him.<br><br>Luffy lucked into finding his weakness which is also a rather crippling one.<br><br>Also while his logia is good for creating sandstorms, dessicating people and objects and projecting sand spikes and such it's also merely sand which in shounen terms is weak shit. Any decent combatant would deal with it easily.<br><br>What interests me more here is how powerful Croc is now that he's fully motivated. We could see his "I give no shits" attitude at Marineford so I hope he can continue being a badass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mihawk<br>Doffy/Kuma<br>Crocodile/Jinbe<br>Hancock<br>Moria<br><br>Kuma is fast but Doffy is no slowpoke either. And we've seen how easily he can manipulate strings. Kuma can't repel something unless his palms touch it.<br><br>Crocodile and Jinbe depends on the place. Desert - Croc. Anywhere with water - Jinbe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   bartolomeo's suitcase   <br><br>he had no will and no trust in his own powers<br>he probably had no control over his haki</br></br></br>  <br>I think the hallmark of strawhats is that while they are most of the time statistically weaker than their opponents, in direct comparison, they always find that extra hidden push to triumph (call it plot armor, w/e). And thus are stronger at that point then the opponent. With this in mind I would peg Sanji (no pun intended) as a vice- admiral level, although the power level of VAs varies I am sure. He probably could take down Vergo, but with much effort and sustained damage at that.</br>  <br>Literally none of the Supernova's knew about Haki when they entered the New World. Moria probably doesn't either and he fought fucking Kaido. Crocodile probably knows about it but I don't he's ever used it before. <br><br>And his head being lopped of means nothing since he's a Logia. Doffy was trying to recruit him and being playful. Without Haki or Water, no attacks can do shit to him.</br></br></br>  <br>In more ways than one.</br>  <br><br>them not knowing about haki (especially in the case of Croc and Moria) is too contrived considering even random mid-level fighters in the new world have command over it<br><br>a more likely explanation is that they never used it or used it but didn't mention it</br></br></br></br>  <br> it's got a sticker and skull on it <br> it must be Bartolomeo's </br></br>  <br><br>he knew</br></br>  <br> b-but powerups are supposed to look ridiculous </br>  <br>Do we know how far in to the New World they were though ? I mean they both got rekt pretty goddamn hard.</br>  <br>get out</br>  <br><br>We know Croc was wrecked by Whitebeard (probably personally) and Moria was wrecked by Kaido (also probably personally) and was stated to be a rival of his.<br><br>So at the very least they'd be familiar with haki and had use of it in order to even attempt to compete with the big dogs.<br><br>Bear in mind that for instance we never saw Kizaru, Akainu or Kuzan use haki explicitly (hardening or observation) yet it's 100% certain they have command over it.<br><br>It could be the same with Croc and Moria. They can use it and are aware of it but simply weren't shown to do so on-page.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, like I said, he most likely knows about it since he's one of the more knowledgeable people in the series. But I don't think he ever managed to learn it.</br>  <br>No.</br>  I'm so glad One Piece threads don't get banned like Naruto ones. That way you normalfags can stay in your containment generals  <br>haki=ambition<br>they both got destroyed both physically and mentally <br>doffy will probably go down to croc at alabasta level at this point while croc got his ambition back it seems</br></br></br>  <br>Will we see Tomoe Gozen?</br>  <br>Glad we agree.</br>  <br>Nah, if they had it, they would have used it to protect themselves. Moria just kept punching Luffy and Luffy explicitly says that, that ain't gonna fly. There's 2 possibilities. Crocodile and Moria didn't use it simply because CoA wasn't something Oda was focusing on at that point. It was in the war that Haki became prominent. <br>2nd possibility is that since CoA is a form of willpower, they both most likely list the ability to use it after their massive defeat. Like a trauma, perhaps. 2nd option is probably the way it's going to go.</br></br>  <br>Sakazuki, Kuzan, and Borsalino all explicitly used haki shown in panel in an undeniable way.</br>  <br> Nah, if they had it, they would have used it to protect themselves. <br><br>Bear in mind most OP villains are cocky assholes who refuse to take Luffy seriously until he literally pounds them into dust.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nope.<br>They only used their logia powers to dodge/block/attack so far.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree, those damn normalfags are bothering the hell out of me and are not welcome in our secret club my dear kindred spirit.</br>  <br><br> crocofags <br>There is no way croco is stronger or on par with doffy. Crocodile stayed in paradise while Doffy was doing his business in the New World. Even if they were once equal before the amount of time Doffy spent in the New World compared to Croco should give him the advantage of experience.</br></br></br>  <br>You need to reread Marineford.<br>The three of them combined their haki and stopped Whitebeard's earthquake.</br></br>  <br> strongest organism </br>  <br>That thing looks like a fuckin robot.</br>  <br> Tomoe was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors. <br><br>Fucking even beheaded a fully grown guy notorious for his strength with her bare hands by snapping his neck so severely.</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds perfect for One Piece</br>  <br>I can see it in Berserk but not in OP. Except the first sentence.</br>  <br>Said to be the cutest invertebrate.Fucking bull.</br>  <br> tardigrades can survive being heated for a few minutes to 151 ¬∞C (304 ¬∞F),[26] or being chilled for days at ‚àí200 ¬∞C (-328 ¬∞F).

Some species can also withstand pressure of 6,000 atmospheres, which is nearly six times the pressure of water in the deepest ocean trench <br> tardigrades can withstand 1,000 times more radiation than other animals <br> tardigrades are the first known animal to survive in space </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Can't wait for when Kaido inevitably underestimates Luffy and gets beaten and the flood of "re-Tard BTFO" posts.</br></br></br>  <br>Jonthan from the G-8 filler arc. That's my favorite filler arc too, the series needs more like those.</br>  <br><br>That was a rather vague application and is on par with possibly vague applications by Croc and Moria.<br><br>They never showed it directly in combat.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Robin and Chopper <br> not Robin and Franky </br></br>  <br> SH <br><br>mugiwara kaizoku dan</br></br></br>  <br>Buggy is so strong that when he jobs, he jobs against his own attack.

He had his head lopped off and it didn't even phase him. <br><br>He's automatically intangible, like all logia, but all logia have one or many weaknesses in which they lose their intangibility, like sand hardens with liquids and moisture and fire can be suffocated by magma and electricity is completely and utterly useless agaisnt rubber since rubber insulates electricity.<br><br>Even if there was a  extremely unlikely  water based logia DF, it can be frozen by ice.<br><br>Every logia has a weakness.<br><br>Crocodile's reflexes weren't that extremely attuned, he naturally became intangible once he was hit with any physical object.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Usopps lies are any indicator, it's a 100% chance she will join.</br>  <br>That's wrong. Logias have to train to be able to instinctively be able to turn into their element when hit with a sneak attack</br>  Why did Oda draw this island?  <br>Bullshit.

Since all users require to transform into their respective element voluntarily, sneak attacks are more likely to work, as the user will not be ready to avoid them.

The only one of the ones listed there that goes much beyond that is Eva and even then it's still got nothing on character brands like Anpanman, Pokemon, One Piece and the like.

Some compare him to Shakespeare (trust me, this isn't actually overselling, seeing as Shakespeare was kind of trashy all told) but I don't think their styles are terribly similar. Voltaire jabbers on a lot, is really blunt about a lot of things. and drips everything in satire. That's Nisio in a nutshell. Except Nisio is no fun, somehow it's all like shit in my mouth when I read his stuff or watch adaptations of his work.</br></br></br>  <br><br> being this retarded </br></br>  <br>Gundam 0079<br>NGE<br>Blue Submarine No.6<br>Ideon <br>Utena</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Good taste anon</br></br>  <br>I just want to say that I really like the picture you posted.</br>  I'm not really surprised, when I think about it.<br>Titanic, Avatar, and Avengers are the top grossing movies of all time too.<br>Titanic and Avatar are still in the top 5 even when adjusting for inflation.<br><br>It's really the same concept here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Dragon Ball GT outselling DBZ <br> Thinks these numbers are accurate at all </br></br>  <br><br><br>Samefag<br><br> Gundam <br> NGE <br> Fucking Ideon <br> good <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I only like Eva.<br>I didn't know Monogatari sold so well.<br>Madoka is crap...</br></br></br>  <br><br>Monogatari sales are down to something like just under 30k a pop now,it's very realistic to expect that there are things that will sell better and considering it's only 2 discs a pop now it's going to be topping out at like 55K an entry soon. It really doesn't have any other sources of revenue either since the novels are done for now and it doesn't seem like any merchandise is coming out. Shaft is practise just clinging to it now because they're locked into finishing it on account of their promise and it's still their best selling series by a wide margin but it has nothing on the likes of Love Live or Gundam or possible even idolmaster and Utapri these days even just counting disc sales. It no longer even has the record for best selling volume since Love Live 2nd season. It took a while but franchise decay has set in and eventually Shaft will have no choice but to move on one way or another.</br></br>  <br> Thinking NGE is bad </br>  <br><br>Bandai Namco does report it's sales in annual 50 page reports that are broken for stock holders sake but that's about the only one I know cause they are huge public ally traded company.</br></br>    Why is Monogatari always the main target of shitposters? Is it because of this?  <br>why do people who feel like they have to defend their taste only post older anime? Is it because they are afraid their taste will get rekt if they post something made in the last 5-10 years?</br>  <br>They think it makes them seem mature and well read.</br>  <br>Damn, Tsukimonogatari sold that well?</br>  <br><br>I kind of noticed that. I didn't mind that Oshino guy much in the first season but everyone else is obnoxious as fuck. I'll give credit to that character designer Watanabe but I could say the same for everything he's worked on porn or not and he gets to join a myriad of other character designer from Japan in terms of drawing hot girls which is sometimes I swear the only area of the industry where I'm seeing any talent anymore. Japan cannot tell a story anymore typically but boy are they good at drawing attractive females.</br></br>  <br>  602,584 </br>  <br>I think it will still sell decently (over 20k at least) for a while. They will probably finish adapting the series before we see numbers bellow the 10k mark. They have to move on to something else eventually but not any time soon. And it's not like they can't survive off of normal 5-10k sales. They've been mostly getting those numbers with everything else that isn't Madoka or Bake. Hell SZS sells average but they made like 5 seasons, same with Hidamari.</br>  <br>Because people who have seen them typically like them since they went out of their way to watch an older show and don't want to shit on something they enjoyed and everyone else hasn't seen it and can't really comment on them without sounding retarded, though I suppose that doesn't stop some people from trying.</br>  <br>Joshiraku wasn't made by SHAFT</br>  <br><br>I'm just glad I'm the only one that can't stand the dialogue in that show. I swear it's part and parcel the reason that so many shows have such inane nonsensical dialogue now. The whole banter thing only ever really worked for me in Gintama. Isin dialogue is just insufferable to me in general though. Like I'm sorry but anything he's written it's just obnoxious, can't think of any other way to put it.</br></br>  <br>Well excuse me for being 30 and not into the hip and trendy stuff the kids watch these days. <br><br>There were shows in the last 10 years I really liked, but none could weasel their way into my top spots</br></br></br>  <br>I think they're good shows and am glad that it's also the general opinion of them even if people argue that that's one of the reasons they're shit.</br>  <br><br>He seems to want to write things that people will be polarized over. Has he ever written a story that isn't just some power fantasy featuring chick's with ridiculous god like powers with a humiliation angle that the protagonist eventually triumphs over via the power of talking them to death? It seems like every female character he writes is some sort of extreme with Medaka being the most obvious.</br></br>  What weirds me out about Madoka and Monogatari is that SHAFT did not do anything knew with either. They've always down weird visuals, head tilts, fun OPs/music, text slideshows and so on. I guess all they needed was cuter girls.  <br>Maybe I'm wrong, but that sounds more like "I don't like this because other people like it" than anything else.</br>  <br><br>Reminder that the last Gundam Unicorn volume actually outsold the Madoka movie overall and that's just one volume. Eva also does like 300K+ a movie.</br></br>  <br>Shame, maybe it would've actually been good.</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>SDF Macross is better than 0079 or Ideon, Turn A is better than 0079, Utena is a self indulgent RoV, and Blue Submarine No.6? Really?</br>  <br>His writing style is very dependent on puns and various types of wordplay. The Japs love that more than anything. Not all of it can be translated properly.</br>  <br>Sorry, I was thinking in Kumeta, replace Joshiraku with Katteni kaizo</br>  <br><br>Because for the longest time people were the biggest pretentious ass holes about it until more people started to realize that it was just a wank bait franchise that caught on because of the directors visual gimmicks which have since gotten stale as fuck.</br></br>  <br> Eva also does like 300K+ a movie. <br>2.0 had 800k preorderes alone</br></br>  <br> Eva is obligatory to post /a/ <br>Not everyone likes forced 2deep4u shit</br></br>  <br>Leave.<br><br/></br></br>    <br>Obnoxious is a really good word for it. Too fucking much, I just can't be interested, it's actively repelling.</br>  <br><br>I love you man. Honestly I can't believe I'm only 30 and already going what the fuck at some of the shit that people champion nowdays. I'd be okay if it was just something like even Fate or Madoka because I can see why teenagers would be into stuff like that and they're alright, but Monogatari is the one I just can't reconcile how anyone could like beyond the character design appeal and fan service. It's just so thoroughly unlike able and unenjoyable beyond that Hitagi arc in the first season. I think I tried 3 separate times to get past the rest of the first season before giving up and tried to see the depth and nuance that others insisted it was oozing with. I'm still not convinced it's not just one big prolonged practical joke and some Michael Douglas' The Game shit going on.</br></br>    <br>Newfag detected. <br><br>Modcat's post was from when the show was airing: https://archive.moe/a/thread/273207<wbr>82/#q27386402</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> SDF Macross <br>I like it, but it relies to much on a plot-device to end it's major conflict. <br><br>I like 0079 more because the war ends because one side runs out of resources and the romance is not a prominent factor. <br><br> Turn A is better than 0079 <br>Turn A suffers from a lot of plot-induced perplexing character behaviour. People start betraying each-other for strange reasons. <br><br>Again I like it but it doesn't beat 0079 in my book. <br><br> Utena is a self indulgent RoV <br>I love Utena for the directing and surrealist elements<br><br> Blue Submarine No.6? Really? <br>I find it unique, especially the ending. The MC just has to accept that he lives in a different world now, you can't even call it a defeat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 30 years old <br> mad about other people's taste in cartoons </br></br></br>  So /a/. Why are you mad right now? <br><br>1. Shit anime sold well<br>2. Good anime sold bad<br>3. Both<br>4. Pretending mad to troll people</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not made, just puzzled. Like I said I get why most of today's shit is popular with younger audiences brought up on it like Fate and then, I just can't reconcile Monogatari.</br></br>  Monogatari is the best anime series of all time so it makes sense.    <br>Most good anime manages to sell well with the exception of those series that cater to a limited crowd, like Lain and Haibane Renmei. No reason to be mad about that unless you're a hipster faggot.</br>  <br>Was the first volume this solidly number one for this long? I'm not surprised it debuted at number one, I'm just surprised it's been that way for 5 days now.</br>  <br>Sorry I told the truth.</br>  <br><br>I thought that was Hibike Euphonium this month.</br></br>  <br>I honestly think its a combination of unorthodox visuals and dialogue that at first glance sounds complicated. So the kids think they are being "sophisticated" for sitting through two hours of circular dialogue. <br><br>It's a "The Emperor's New Clothes" kinda situation.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they understand something you don't, or vice versa. Maybe they simply have different taste and what you find obnoxious they find interesting. The fact that you feel the need to reconcile this at all, never mind criticize something as subjective as personal taste, is very immature.</br>  <br>Further confirmation that /a/ has shit taste</br>  <br>I think you feel threatened by the fact that something you don't like is highly praised by others so you feel the need to dismiss it.</br>  <br> this doesn't appeal to me, so it's shit <br><br>/a/ in a nutshell.</br></br></br>  <br> Most good anime manages to sell well </br>  <br>Literally 2deep4u</br>  <br> never mind criticize something as subjective as personal taste, is very immature. <br>Actually this "everything is subjective you can't criticize it" shtick is pretty childish. <br><br>If you have the patience you should watch <br><br>https://vimeo.com/112655231<br><br>It's quite interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you remove Mechas from Eva, you still have Evangelion.<br>If you remove cut girls from Madoka, you lose 50% of the show.<br>If you remove girls from Monogatari series, you have nothing.</br></br>  Let's be real. It's all downhill from it.  <br>your newfag is showing. there was this one tripfag (called taiga of all things) endlessly shitposting in every bake thread. I assume it was jealousy due to bake's success</br>  <br> characters are important to a show's substance <br>brilliant</br></br>  <br>Wrong. You have Kaiki. Meme and Araragi are pretty cool too.</br>  <br> if you remove girls from eva you have nothing <br> if you remove girls from madoka you have nothing <br><br>it applies to all of them you faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br> If you remove the characters from a character-driven show, you have nothing. <br>Genius.</br></br>  <br> "everything is subjective you can't criticize it" <br>That's not the issue. The issue is how concerned you are about the fact that people like something you don't, and that your complaints are entirely personal issues which, while reasonable to have, don't reflect on anyone else's enjoyment of a series. Insisting on "my taste&gt;your taste" and "there must be something wrong with these people if they like something I don't" is what makes you childish, not simply being critical of something.</br></br>  <br> remove the characters <br> you no longer have a show <br><br>Well la-di-freakin-da.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I think you feel threatened by the fact that something you don't like is highly praised <br>No not really, Monogatari is to consumerist to have a lasting impact. It's like a very good commercial band, I understand why people would like it but I am not those people.</br></br>    Ddidnz gundam sell way more?  <br>One is good<br>One is ok<br>One is shit</br></br></br>  <br>Then why do you feel the need to prove the superiority of your opinion to everyone else?</br>  <br>Two are shit. One is a masterpiece.</br>  <br>they are all good and you can suck my dick</br>  <br> If you take the characters out of a show that is 95% driven by character interaction, you have nothing <br>Whoa</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I said CUT GIRLS (forgot to right it about Monogatari, my bad). If they are older or ugly, those shows would lose 70% of the fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But what you didn't know was that I've already sucked it!</br>  <br> there must be something wrong with these people if they like something I don't <br>As I said, there are people that love Kitsch, I find it and the people that like it distastfull. <br><br>I don't think there is something wrong with you, there is nothing wrong with having bad taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And if you remove all the girls from Madoka, you have a psychopathic rabbit-cat and a cripple who never even meet each other.</br>  <br>Its a generic harem show. But its really good at being a generic harem show.<br><br>The way it is produced makes it enjoyable to watch, even when you realize it is basically everything you 'hate' in anime.</br></br></br>  <br>makes for great reaction images as well</br>  <br> Predictable, stupid plot and a good OST. <br>Sure, its predictable now that every major plot twist is common knowledge to everyone, even before they watch the show.</br></br>  <br>Are you arguing that if you removed Rei, Asuka, and  Shinji  you wouldn't lose fans?</br>  <br>You could probably make this statement about most anything, anime or otherwise.</br>  <br><br><br>DAMAGE CONTROL</br></br></br>  <br>But they are total shit</br>  <br>Nice try being smug, but 'bad' implies something wrong by definition, so you're either too stupid to speak proper English or you're bullshitting. Not to mention that you're basically admitting to being immature at this point and hiding behind "bad taste" attacks instead.</br>  <br>C'mon, they were clearly talking about strictly anime sales.<br><br>If you're throwing in merch then anpanman is the most profitable anime of all time and nobody on /a/ has ever watched it.</br></br></br>  <br> if you change the qualities of a show to something less desirable it will be less popular <br>remarkable</br></br>   NGE <br> deconstruction of mecha <br> madoka <br> deconstruction of magical girls  <br> monogatari <br> deconstruction of harems <br><br>So is the key to success making deconstructions?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice buzzword there friend.</br>  <br> &gt;madoka <br> &gt;deconstruction <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering how it's responsible for a large quantity of the waifu threads, the answer is pretty clear.</br></br>  <br>But NGE and Monogatari aren't an issue?

This is a side-effect of them cramming so much dialogue into the scene and not knowing how to deal with it. <br><br>Visual storytelling is scarce, everything is explained in expository dialogue, this is a major failing in a visual medium<br><br>The surrealist elements clash with how base the actually story about a teenager "fighting" ghost actually is. <br><br>Scene transition is extremely abrupt,a character will be in one place then transported to another location entirely in the next scene. It comes off as if you were watching storyboards and not the actual finished work. <br><br>"Camera" angels and scene composition is unimaginative and repetitive, most scene will just involve the characters standing in the middle of the scene talking. <br><br>And so on and so on. <br><br>If you actually think the above points are purely subjective and you love the show because of them, then you have bad taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>If you remove their beautiful, the show is still the same. You can't say the same thing about Monogatari or Madoka.</br></br>  <br>How do you make ugly anime girls anyway?</br>  <br> &gt;Scene transition is extremely abrupt,a character will be in one place then transported to another location entirely in the next scene. It comes off as if you were watching storyboards and not the actual finished work. <br>Not him, but quick abrupt cuts between scenes is the 'style' of the show, the same as 'black/red scene'. <br>Scenes being 'drawn out' is completely subjective. <br>The clash between elements you're talking about is doesn't exist either and is also your shitty view.<br><br> <br>There is nothing wrong with making a show with a strong drawing point being the pretty and interesting girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Make them fat, hairy, bald or mole-y.</br>  <br>This sounds like major nitpicking faggotry to me. There isn't a single show that doesn't have comparable flaws to what you've listed.</br>  <br>Draw you're waifu</br>  <br> but quick abrupt cuts between scenes is the 'style' of the show <br>And it is a bad "style" because it is jarring and goes against the principles of a visual medium. When you observe the world around you, do you see it as quick cuts between scenes or do you see it as a natural flow of progression? <br><br>A visual medium should not go against the very laws of how we perceive the world with our sight. The same way music should not strive to create a cacophony compromised by off-key sounds. <br><br><br> This sounds like major nitpicking faggotry to me. <br>It's not nitpicking when these problems persist through almost the entire show</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aku no Hana</br>  <br>Oh, and have their eyes be off. Zetman has one attractive woman, and it's mostly because everyone's eyes are shit.</br>  <br> I am responding to the anon that said personal taste can not be criticised <br>That's not what I said. What I said was that getting upset enough to criticize a stranger's personal taste (as opposed to respectfully disagreeing and leaving it at that, for example) in something as trivial as a cartoon is immature, especially when the extent of your criticism is as subjective as "I thought it was obnoxious/boring".<br> And yes I do consider my taste to be more in line with the "lege artis" of anime and as such better then the taste of other individuals.  <br>"My taste is better because I said so".<br> Scenes are generally drawn out <br>This is an opinion based on an emotional response to the scene. If you get bored, it's "too long". If you don't, it isn't. Entirely subjective.<br> Visual storytelling is scarce <br>Debatable, and too ambiguous an idea to define in any objective way. Also completely subjective in terms of how important this is to the overall quality of the work.<br><br>And so on. Every one of your criticisms are just bullshit personal taste. Which is fine, but when you start acting like that taste is better than any other taste or your opinion is in any way relevant to how much other people should like it, you come off like an absolute tool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are they eating CP?</br>  <br>It's nitpicking because they're only 'problems' to you. They don't bother other people, in fact some people think they add to the series, and it's stupid of you to think that because you have an issue with they must be bad.</br>  <br>There's clearly green peppers (and what looks like onions) on that pizza.</br>  <br>cute pic anon</br>  <br> nitpicking this hard </br>  <br> it is a bad "style" because it is jarring and goes against the principles of a visual medium <br> I subjectively feel like it goes against some stuff I arbitrarily said is important </br></br>  <br> Not mentioning the actual best seller Gundam Seed <br><br>Literal hipster</br></br></br>   ep 25, 26 of NGE TV series <br> muh symbolism <br> 2deep4u <br> it means someone's social, psychological blah blah or it can be a message for us otaku </br></br></br>  <br>These are the best loli of all time.

Why would anyone like that? <br><br>this is either high class bait or you just answered your own question and didn't realize it.</br></br></br>    <br>All you're chanting is about taste and what qualifies as 'good taste'. Just because something is jarring to you, doesn't mean it is jarring to other people, which has been shown by the fact Monogatari is one of the highest grossing series which means people find no fault in the style of the show and it is not in fact 'jarring' <br>Your criticisms are your opinion and not fact at all, and are intense nitpicking. The show has faults but your faults are nitpicking and subjective.</br></br>    <br><br>I hope you understand that all your counter-arguments are "it's subjective" and you can't actually explain what makes Monogatari good in your opinion. <br><br>And thinking that scene-composition, visual storytelling, scene length and scene transition are just nitpicking shows you have no understanding of the medium you are watching.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I used to lick my dad's all the time <br><br>what the hell</br></br></br>  <br> why is this even a rivalry again? <br>good question. <br><br>Its not much of a rivalry when one studio has a single anime series ('Monogatari) which has sold more combined BluRay, DVD, and VHS tapes then everything Kyoani ever realised in it's history. that's not even including the insane amounts of the same that madoka has sold.<br><br>it's like calling the Buffalo Bisons (AAA baseball) a rival for the NY Yankees. <br><br>call me when Kyoani releases something that passes one of those two series in sales, then we'll have a rivalry worth debating. until that happens, calling it a rivalry is giving kyoani way too much credit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then why fucking comment</br>  <br>it was a joke. Such a thing wouldn't happen, she's an innocent lady</br>  <br>How much has the Monogatari series sold overall?</br>  <br>Your arguments consist of 'it's jarring' and 'drawn out scenes' and you can't actually explain what makes Monogatari bad 'objectively'. <br><br>You're nitpicking because your treating the above as something that everyone finds bad when it is not the case. There is no correct way to compose a scene or transition between them, and it does not have to reflect reality. Sure critiquing these aspects is not nitpicking, but your specific comments are.</br></br></br>  <br>People have already explained why they like Monogatari, but even if they didn't it's not relevant because what's on trial here is your opinion not theirs. That is, they aren't trying to prove that Monogatari is good, they're trying to make you understand that you have a hyper-inflated conception of the importance and correctness of your own opinion.<br> And thinking that scene-composition, visual storytelling, scene length and scene transition are just nitpicking <br>No, what you think are problems with those things are nitpicking. Your only argument for why there's such a problem with them is "I didn't like it". Well so fucking what?<br><br> the scenes were not drawn out <br> you think the scenes were drawn out <br> therefore you have bad taste and dislike objectively good things <br>Exactly the same argument you're making.<br><br> I think we are done here. <br> keeps posting <br>Classy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Over since 2007 <br> 2012 <br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2012-06-04/2ch-forum-warns-5-site<wbr>s-against-reposting-threads<br><br>http://matome.naver.jp/odai/2133877<wbr>360013469801/2133877452313550003<br><br> 2ch is currently owned by Singaporean shell company, nobody is accountable. &gt;Affi-blogs like Yaraon continue to fabricate 2ch comments that praise series with a large tendency toward SHAFT and Aniplex shows <br> SHAFT caught fabricating Amazon.jp reviews on BDs on multiple occassions <br><br> 2ch is hit by a 'cyber attack' shortly after <br> Data leaked like crazy <br> Many suspect Hiroyuki himself as being behind it <br><br>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/2„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„Å≠<wbr>„ÇãÂÄã‰∫∫ÊÉÖÂ†±ÊµÅÂá∫‰∫ã‰ª∂<br>http://www.anonymous-japan.org/fake<wbr>2ch/#third<br><br>4chan 'shilling' conspiracies have nothing on some of the dirt that has been dug up on 2ch.

Having overly verbose, bloated dialogues in a visual medium is not the correct way. I am not overstating my taste, you are grossly overstating yours since you think you can ignore all laws that govern a visual medium by simply screaming "it's subjective" <br><br>At the end of the day this is the result of people like you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You refuse to accept the existence of "lege artis" and ma√Ætre <br>No one said that.<br> think everything is subjective <br>Not everything, but your complaints certainly are. For example:<br> Having overly verbose, bloated dialogues in a visual medium is not the correct way <br>At what point does the dialogue become overly verbose and bloated? How do you measure it (words, seconds, something else?) and what amount is too much? Is it a function of degrees, or a simple binary? How much should this dialogue influence quality of a series, in general and compared to other factors, and how is that measured? Explain the objective means of determining these things to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Will Kizumonogatari outsell End of Evangelion?</br>  <br>SHAFT cut a ton of shit from the LNs already. They tried to make it as compact as possible. If they tried to cut even more to appease nitpicking faggots like you they would get backlash for butchering the source material.</br>  <br> How do you measure it words <br>Yes that's exactly how you measure it. <br><br> and what amount is too much <br>When the characters become paralysed and no action is being taken other them talking and more talking. <br><br>When the series is unable to convey the actions transpiring on the screen without copious amounts of dialogue. <br><br>Here is an objective test. <br><br>Take any given movie/series, turn off the volume and watch it. If it's a good movie/series you can understand what is happening even without the dialogue if you can't understand what's happening then it's a bad movie/series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like all of them. Makes me happy.<br><br>3.33 completely ruined Eva for me though.</br></br></br>  <br> They tried to make it as compact as possible <br>And they failed. Not because it was impossible to succeed but because they are incompetent.</br></br>  <br> When the characters become paralysed and no action is being taken other them talking and more talking.  <br> When the series is unable to convey the actions transpiring on the screen without copious amounts of dialogue. <br>Why is that bad? How did you come up with this system?<br><br> If it's a good movie/series you can understand what is happening even without the dialogue if you can't understand what's happening then it's a bad movie/series. <br>That's nonsense, there are tons of acclaimed movies which would fail that test. Citizen Kane, Rashomon, the Godfather... all bad movies, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When the characters become paralysed and no action is being taken other them talking and more talking.  <br><br>This is only an issue in Bake in my opinion. That was mostly due to budget constraints since Shaft was still a bunch of nobodies when they made the show. It later evolved into something that only happens very occasionally and not to a extent which would hurt the scene composition like you claimed.</br></br></br>  <br> movies which would fail that test <br> Citizen Kane, Rashomon, the Godfather <br><br>No, no they wouldn't. <br><br>Even something like Stalker or Solaris could be understood with no dialogue, let alone straight-forward movies like the Godfather or Citizen Kane</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they're talking <br> now that guy's killing that other guy for some reason <br> now some other people are talking and someone is mad about something <br> 10/10 movie </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>ERP now, fags.</br></br>  <br>monogatari &amp; madoka are good. i never managed to watch past the 3rd-4th episode of evangelion and i have tried many times before. if i ever try it again i'll probably start at the 15th episode.</br>  <br> monogatari &amp; madoka are good <br>kek</br></br>  <br><br>You can reasonably make all of those statements and be allowed to have your opinion but to pretend that it doesn't have some of the best character development in anime is just fucking wrong.</br></br>  <br> some of the best character development in anime <br>Stop embellishing.</br></br>  <br><br>Does it really count as a harem if the guy picks his girl in the first couple episodes?</br></br>  <br> there's a guy <br> a bunch of girls want his dick <br><br>I like the show, but it's still a harem.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of people have wasted a lot of money on shows I don't like.</br>  <br>Alright what about shit like Legend of the Galactic Heroes, where nearly the whole thing is dialogue? Surely you can't say it's bad just because without it the show would make no sense.</br>  <br><br>Lesbian, Dead Child, Sister, Sister 2, Doll, Loli Vampire.<br><br>It's only Snake and Cat who want Araragi. Cat gets over it and Snake gets homicidal.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, modern anime fans summarized perfectly in one shitty post.</br></br>  <br>Bake really doesn't fit in.</br>  <br>You probably made that post.</br>  <br>Shinobu is in love with him in a weird platonic way, his sisters really want his dick.<br><br>You forgot crab.</br></br></br>  <br>Monogatari, k-on, and madoka magica are the top 3</br>  <br><br>I really don't feel like I am. The expository nature of Monogatari as well as the time skips and the focus on different narrators and their specific arcs lends itself really well to character development. Can look at characters like Crab, Cat, Snake and Monkey and see huge development and changes over the course of the series. It's one of my favorite parts of the show.<br><br>It may not do everything perfect but characters and character development are definitely a strong point.</br></br></br></br>  Gainex or w.e should all evangelion rights to shift. The day 4.0 could be saved  <br>His whole argument is "my taste is objective, if I found it jarring then it must be jarring to everyone". You aren't going to get any consistency out of him.</br>  <br><br>Left crab out because she won the Araragi Bowl in the second or third episode.</br></br>  <br>Bakemonogatari is a bit surprising, and Madoka probably shouldn't be there. Is this really all time? Or this decade?</br>  <br>LoGH is a bad anime, it's a great novel and a great story. But it's a bad anime. It's just talking heads and a bunch of dots firing lines at other dots.</br>  <br><br>Not him but I've been watching anime since 1996 and I still haven't sat down and watched Eva. Well except for bits and pieces over the years.<br><br>I just can't stand mecha and never have.<br><br>People just have different tastes. I didn't like Madoka either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why are new /a/utists so mad that Madoka sold so much? /a/ was absolutely crazy about the show 4 years ago. Is it- is it the famous "hipster effect" I've heard of?  <br>Yes. It's cool to shit on Madoka Magica now.</br>  <br> 4 years ago <br>Holy shit it's been 4 years since Madoka came out</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the theads were awesome. Mami's death and the fucking tsunami coinciding with walpergisnaght, shit was hype!</br>  <br> Giving a fuck about fanbases <br>Do better, anon</br></br>  <br>Are you the same retard who was shitting on Mono earlier? This settles it if yes. Your opinion is now in the trash.</br>  <br> is this really all time? Or this decade <br> NGE <br><br>I really feel like /a/ is becoming dumber every time I visit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're missing Golden Eggs. Not that anyone should really give a shit, but it technically is the best-selling show by the metric you're using.<br><br><br>You're beyond new.</br></br></br></br>  Madoka wasn't even the best show in it's season. Steins Gate was.  <br>Yes, and we know how pissy people get when something has resounding success.</br>  <br>A movie came out this decade fucknuts.</br>    <br>Redditard detected.</br>  <br>I never thought it was great, but back when it aired it made more sense to talk about it. After so long people just get sick of hearing about it and how great it supposedly is.</br>  <br>That's not how sales work, you stupid faggot.</br>  <br>It's written "series" in the OP and there's no "Rebuild" in the picture. Plug in brain next time.</br>  <br>B-but loli haet pizza</br>  <br>Backlash at something's popularity is a terrible reason to shit on it. Just don't join the discussion if you're sick of hearing about it.</br>  I find eva and madoka good even if they don't suit my taste, bakemonogatari is intelligent and well executed fanservice the first time I watched it I thought, holy fuck this is shit but it's going to sell a lot, and it did.  <br><br>LoGH is a bad anime though, it even resorts to narration at times because they don't know how to convey certain information. That's a cardinal sin for a visual medium. <br><br>The characters are great, the story is great, but it's not a good anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> caring one way or the other about lasting impact and commercial appeal <br>I, too, remember being seventeen.</br></br>  <br> I find eva and madoka good even if they don't suit my taste, bakemonogatari is intelligent and well executed fanservice the first time I watched it I thought, holy fuck this is shit but it's going to sell a lot, and it did. <br>So you don't like Madoka and Eva, but you think they're good, and you like Bake but think it's shit? I don't understand.</br></br>  <br>Considering people here shat on pretty much every one of those 3 anime, I would consider /a/'s opinion meaningless anyway. I didn't really like NGE, I loved Madoka and I enjoyed Bake but I don't shit on Eva just 'cause the "2D4U" has gotten annoying through and through.</br>  <br>Stop posting.</br>  <br>Are you finding yourself agreeing with me? <br><br>Does it scare you?</br></br></br>  <br><br>You sure showed him.</br></br>    <br> it's a great story but it's a bad anime because of reading <br>Fuck off, retard. Go watch some cinemasins or something.</br></br>  <br>They're just vocal edgy hipster kids. Those shows are still loved by the overwhelming majority of /a/.</br>  Watched Evangenlion. Didn't like it. It's pretty shit really. If it came out in this generation it wouldn't sell well at all.  <br>answering with shit like<br> Come on <br> pffft <br> yeah <br>either you are talking out your ass or this is some fucking low quality bait</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Overwhelming <br> 61 </br></br>  <br> tfw gits and lain is that low <br><br>just doesn't feel right</br></br></br>  <br>It's favorite, not liked. I'm sure both are reasonably popular, but they aren't the most accessible.</br>  <br>Look around you, dumbass. You don't even need a better sample size to realize that.</br>  <br>Eva's 1/10 and the anime with the worst fanbase, Monogatari series is 3/10 hipster bullshit, Madoka's 5/10 genericisn</br>    <br>All I see is retards like you</br>  <br> best selling anime TV series of all time  <br> hipster bullshit <br><br>I don't think you know what the word means.</br></br></br></br>  are waifus really the only thing people like about monogatari? because i wasnt interested in any of them and was bored out of my fucking mind (dropped after i finished bake, and the only reason i watched that long anyways was because of the podium people hold the series on)<br><br>like jesus at least nge and madoka were interesting</br></br>  <br> inb4 m-muh character development <br><br>then the characters should be interesting</br></br></br>  <br>Amerifats with ADHD will get bored by the series, yes.</br>  <br>No, it's got interesting plot inbetween the waifus, although waifus are definitely a major part of it.</br>  <br><br>If you don't like the characters, then obviously you aren't going to like a dialogue-heavy series about the characters interacting. Don't act like this is some unique phenomenon that only holds for shitty shows.</br></br>  Bakemonogatari may be incredibly heavy on pandering fan service but goddammit if it doesn't have a wonderful artstyle. <br>Based<br><br>S H A F T<br>H<br>A<br>F<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> *tips fedora* </br>  Gundam is the record holder by an enormous margin though.    Bake &gt; NGE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Madoka  <br> Bake &gt; NGE <br>Please</br></br>  <br>OP's using average sales, not total.</br>  <br>It would only count if it had continuity.</br>  <br>There's a streak of like five to eight episodes in the middle of NGE that just aren't very interesting. Also, I like Bake's visual style more (though NGE has better animation).</br>  <br>Neko is shit, nise and hana are great.</br>  <br>I somehow managed to watch it a few weeks ago without getting spoiled at all.</br>  <br><br>disc sales for unicorn alone still eclipsed those 3</br></br>  <br>Bakemonogatari was the most unentertaining boring crap I've ever seen.</br>  <br> haruhi getting any votes at all <br>this is how I know /a/ is retarded</br></br>  <br>Madoka was the only anime I liked from Shaft.</br>  <br> this post <br>This is how I know I should have worn a condom 14 years ago.</br></br>  <br>Fucking pleb.</br>  <br>I don't like this one because it has been sitting in my backlog since fucking forever.</br>  <br>Haruhi is mediocre at best.<br>Nothing about it was amazing.</br></br>  <br><br>Bake isn't even that fanservicey.<br><br>It's Nise that turned borderline hentai.<br><br>Bake and Second Season were pretty tame.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>xd<br>lol<br>pfft<br>:p<br>na<br>Great arguments anon</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the same but the last season and the movie changed my entire perspective on the series.</br>  <br>Same was true of  your mother. </br>  <br>bet you didn't watch every single episode of endless eight</br>   Monogatari, Madoka <br> in the three best selling series of all time <br>No, you're retarded. It's World of Golden Eggs, Evangelion, and 0079.</br></br>  <br>(2005) 139,252 The world of Golden Eggs [PLUS heads]<br>(1995) 111,559 Shin Seiki Evangelion [Gainax]<br>(2006) 100,458 The world of Golden Eggs 2nd season [PLUS heads]<br>(2009) *78,671 Bakemonogatari [Shaft]<br>(2011) *71,056 Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica [Shaft]<br>(2004) *68,732 Kidou Senshi Gundam Seed Destiny [Sunrise]<br>(2006) *61,633 Usavich [Kanaban]<br>(2012) *60,580 Nisemonogatari [Shaft]<br>(2002) *58,589 Kidou Senshi Gundam Seed [Sunrise]<br>(2007) *53,230 Usavich 2 [Kanaban]<br><br>The DVD/BDs for that weird South Park-like show were way cheaper than average though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Google says the difference is that you're counting only initial releases and I'm counting all releases, so I guess we're both right?<br><br>Anyway, yeah, World of Golden Eggs' sales don't really mean anything. It's also inarguably shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Monogatari sold over 600k in total. NGE and Madoka... I dunno, but I think they surpass any Gundam if you include their movies.</br>  <br>No, I watched the first 4 before I just said fuck it and watched the last one.</br>  SHAFT stronk. How long until the third masterpiece?  Where were you when anime was good?  <br> Wanting anime to get more mainstream <br>Just fuck off.</br></br>  <br>I'm a bit confused. That article doesn't have a single mention of shilling by any company. The article is about content aggregators stealing from 2ch and publishing false information they sourced from threads.<br><br>Your other links don't mention anything about shilling either. It sounds more like some kind of right dispute between Hiroyuki and the new owners. Really, who are you quoting?</br></br></br>  <br>  it hasn't been gaining any new fans since the decade started really <br>As someone who started watching anime in the late 2000s, let me tell you, this is a good thing. We were unbearable, and you should thank your lucky stars that that surge ended.</br></br>  <br>Honestly at this rate anon it's the lesser of two evils. Stagnate and keep getting identical boring or stupid shit year after year or hope more people start getting into it and bring demand for new types of series.</br>  <br>Nah, the new stuff won't be any better on average.</br>  <br>It's on Netflix, it's already mainstream. My retired parents watch anime now.</br>  <br>Seconding this.</br>  <br>What kind of anime do they watch? Do they have shit taste?</br>  <br>Tell them I think they're plebs for streaming.</br>  <br><br>le edgy contrarian hipsters.</br></br>  <br>My dad seems to, he liked this movie called Expelled From Paradise that looked fucking terrible. My mom likes Satoshi Kon, and Studio Ghibli stuff.</br>  <br> the last two lack setting and proper world building <br>Holy shit, this. I love both series but this is a huge flaw that is rarely acknowledged by anyone.</br></br>  <br>First of all that's not a flaw. Both of them use the real world with some modification so they don't need to do world building. <br><br>Secondly what the hell does that have to do with deconstruction?</br></br></br>  nah sorry man but i got to get this off my chest.<br><br>I don't even know where the fuck to begin...<br>Why do people like you find the whole anime shit something to sit around and jerk off to?<br>You think because you get to sit in your warm homes on a computer that you can just fuck your anime dolls and suck up our tax dollars?<br>What the actual fuck is wrong with you?<br>This issue is very serious, yet crazy assfucks like you are thinking about retarded cartoon characters all day.<br>Sick fucks, doing this shit does fucking nothing. So you want to come on an imageboard to be an asshole that wants to fuck some japanese drawings?<br>Let me tell you, you are fucking weak. You would never be useful to the world with such behavior you present.<br>Honestly why do people like you 'otakus' even exist? I bet you don't even know how to flip a burger at McDonald's.You are such disgusting people.<br>Isn't it bad enough that people go through hardships of losing their real jobs, and their real problems? Seriously what do you really find sexy about anime?<br>Stupid fuckers I'm so angry right now that I wish I can fucking punch my computer screen so that my fist can get a good hit on that asshole face of yours.<br>Sick fucks.

I hate it, just like I hate your post.</br>  I for one look forward to this season.  <br>I am the opposite. I wanted to watch almost all the show that aired today.</br>  Anyone else watching Rokka no Yuusha? I like it. It has the old school vibe of "Heroes fight a demon lord." No wacky gimmicks like the demon lord is a good guy, or the bad guy is whatever. It just seems like it's gonna be a straight up journey with some interesting characters. The MC isn't overbearing, it seems.

The same thing happened to me a while back.<br><br>Look. Regarding Classroom Crisis! Just watch the whole episode. Seriously. Have some more patience and just try and watch the entire episode of a show at least. I'm really enjoying that show.<br><br>Same with Gate. Watch the ENTIRE first episode. If Itami's character bothers you, we're in the same boat for the most part but it wont bother you for much longer. You might even like him by the end of the first episode.<br><br>Look. If you can't go into the shows with an open mind you wont be able to bring yourself to like them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a patriotic military otaku and I enjoyed gate. Itami's not even the focus of the show the entire time, so you can't even say that.<br><br>Oh also, since when did self-insert become a derogatory word? Is commander shepard a self-insert character? Do people hate him/her?<br><br>The world of gate is interesting and the way it develops is interesting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's something for everyone this season, even for nostalgia goggle fags like me (Ushio to Tora).</br>   only the first episodes have come out <br> not even for all shows <br>Can't you fuckers wait for at least 3 eps?</br></br>    lolwut? Plenty of good looking show coming up. It's just a shame fansubbing took a nosedive in the last month and a half  <br>btw, already found this season's best girl</br>  <br> being this new </br>  <br>LN</br>  <br>I've been out of the loop for a while, what happened to fansubbing? Did a bunch of groups just quit or something?</br>  But what about overlord?<br>You can't go wrong with skeleton wizards right?</br>  <br>I don't know if someone was on multiple group under different names, but it seems like a lot of groups had some people just vanish or quit all at the same time.<br><br>For what I watched, the only group that has been relatively on time was Lemonscans with Yuki-chan (which I started with caffeine before they shit the bed). Every single other group has been late for at least 2-3 weeks</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fansubbing is nearly dead.

Why don't they fucking drop shit that's 2 season late? They mention not dropping Inou Battle, but they last updated it with episode 4 in april when the show was already over for a while. What the fuck are they thinking?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Jesus. I go away for the summer and everything goes to shit.Better learn moon so I don't have to put up with this.</br></br>  <br>It's not like Fall is any better.</br>  <br><br>FFF finish what they start.

Did the author suddenly die and his retarded editor have to figure out an ending?</br>  <br>Search in the archive.</br>  <br> LoGH next episode previews.png </br>        <br>That's some attention to detail, that hole beneath her is great for clearing out waste and blood..</br>    <br>Nope, nips prefer eating shit like Kakegurui, Eighth and more fucking corpse party so his editor told him to end it in ~3 chapters he got one more and tried to cram the whole thing in those chapters.</br>  <br>Do you think Erza pissed herself during the torturing scene?</br>  <br><br>Kill yourselves</br></br>     Image searching manga pages <br>Yup. This works.</br>    <br>Yeah feels like facebook/reddit tier.</br>  <br>Gash bell had some great humor</br>  OP's page is from "Kono Bijutsubu Niwa Mondai ga Aru!" I think.     Samurai Flamenco   <br>Yeah. According to my screenshots, there were cameos in episodes 1, 4, 5 (all over the place), 7, 8, 9 and 10.</br>  <br>I don't know, man. Kurata seems like he already moved on even though he's still haunted by the ghost of shit sales.<br><br><br>Omori, on the other hand</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurata is still doing the nohomo thing at least. Maria's sales weren't too hot either. <br>Speaking of sales, v1 of Samurai Flamenco is apparently 941. It looks like Punchline's v1 will sell less than us according to stalkerpoints. We won't be the butt of sales threads for much longer! ;_;</br></br>  <br> We won't be the butt of sales threads for much longer! ;_; <br>Don't you mean the punch line?<br>I guess noitaminA also needs saving from the curse, and Ranpo Kitan doesn't strike me as a posible hit</br></br></br>  <br>Saekano sold well, but that was the most un-Noitamina-ish show ever, an adaptation, and the BDs were chock full of extras with that amazing art. Hopefully Ranpo Kitan will do decently.</br>  This is the future you choose, Oboe-chan.   play Kyoani Roulette <br> get buchou <br><br>I'm okay with this.</br></br></br>  <br>Its more like divorce parents issues. sister issues, and family stuff in general.</br>  <br><br>Ribbon a shit. A SHIT.</br></br>  <br>She's actually a really good friend, especially when she got Mizore out of panic mode.</br>  <br>man Haruka's development was really nice</br></blockquote>]
