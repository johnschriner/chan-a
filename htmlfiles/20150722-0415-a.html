[  Protip: <br>You fucking can't.</br>  Is bad-ass new-age lingo for "butthurt"?  Lucci is just a punk.  <br>Literally every Haki-using character, including Rebecca.</br>  <br>Strength isn't related to badassery.</br>  <br> implying Rob doesn't have Haki after timeskip <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be some weak-tier bullshit.<br><br> Trained all his life to be an assassin <br> Never learned to use Haki <br><br> 2 years later <br> Everyone else is using Haki <br> "Might as well join the club!" <br><br>Why didn't he learn to use it back when he was relevant?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   goofy ass face <br> goofy ass fruit ability <br> owns it while deflecting katana and cutting down buildings with his big goofy ass giraffe nose </br></br>  <br>Ask something more difficult.<br>(Low quality bait, btw)</br></br>  <br>Because he wasn't at a level to operate in the New World. With or without haki he would've been blown the fuck out. Better to focus of becoming strong enough to dominate Grand Line, and then move on to tougher shit. Besides, the Strawhats are in the same situation.</br>  <br>The dove on his shoulder.</br>  What changes would you make to Sakura (personality, backstory, route, etc.; not her looks and body of course, she's a 10) so she would be nearly as popular as the other two heroines?  <br>More worms. Can't have enough worms.</br>  Make her stop being so freaking submissive. Seriously, what the hell. That nice girl act enfuriates me.  <br> Happy Sakura <br>don't</br></br>  <br>Pare down the word count of those godawful cooking and archery club scenes.</br>  Delete her and replace her with Ilya  <br>This. The rare instances when she's silly, bitchy, smug, etc are when she's at her best.<br><br>That face she gave Shinji at the end of the UBW anime was pure gold, and we need to see more of that side of her.</br></br></br>  Make her stop tasting like worms.  <br> godawful cooking <br>You just don't get Fate, summerfag. Go back to tumblr.</br></br>  <br>Remove Shirou and Illya from her route. Like, completely. Don't even acknowledge their existence. And have Rin die early on. Leave it to Shinji, Kotomine, and Zouken to sort things out. Or even better, let Sakura be the one who fixes shit.</br>  <br>Nothing really. I like her now <br><br>Rinfags will never stop won't they?</br></br></br>  <br> Tragic backstory without being used goods. <br> Strong and independent. <br> No worms. <br> Endearing personality. <br> Doesn't fake feelings of affection. <br> Wormless. <br> Shorter. <br> Flatter. <br> Younger looking in general. <br> Lacking in worms. <br> Give her white hair. <br> Red eyes. <br> Two equally great side characters that come with her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> take away the rape thing <br> cut her skirt down to a quarter of its current length and give her ZR <br> give her twintails <br> make her another shitty generic Asuka-clone like her sister <br> Rake in grubby semen-encrusted otaku monies. <br>You asked how to make her popular. Not how to make her good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hating cooking scenes <br>I bet you like this boring shit. <br><br> still no Fate cooking wars </br></br></br></br>  <br>This ship was weirdly popular when Fate/Zero aired. Probably because some people got the wrongful impression of Kariya fighting for anyone but himself. Anyway, maybe try cashing in on this.</br>  <br>Replace her sensible-length skirt with one that doesn't even cover her ass fully and flash blue-striped panties 50 times per scene.</br>  <br>More graphic depictions of her in the basement of Casa de Worm.</br>  <br>Honestly I dislike both her regular personality and her Dark Sakura personality, and her backstory and role in HF was so unsympathetic to me that I thought killing her would be the true end when I first read it. So I don't know, the only way to fix her would be to change her completely.</br>  Why would I want Sakura to be that popular?<br><br>As it stands, I can safely ignore Sakura haters' posts and lose nothing of value. It's an excellent filter.</br></br>  <br>People liked loli Sakura. Maybe make her a loli again? Might not work since FSN already has one token loli, but that one is old and busted and sucks anyway.</br>  Should have gone with the older sister.   Show the development between her and Shirou <br> Don't make her an antagonist in her own route <br> Stop trying to make her sympathetic while everyone else gets fucked over cause of her <br> Have her actually help Shirou besides cooking for him, considering the guy gave up everything for her <br> Stop having her say "Senpai" so much <br><br>Honestly we'd be better off with just starting a new character from scratch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> popular <br>Why in God's name would you want that? The popular girl is always the most generic cardboard cutout designed to pander to the largest audience.</br></br>  <br>Make her a dude. Everything would be better if Sakura was a guy.</br>  <br>The Tohsaka sisters love that shit. See how Rin goes full dere during sex.</br>  <br><br> act <br><br>That was genuine. See her dictionary entry. She just also happens to rarely have times of extreme bluntness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And Sakura goes full slut during her ero scenes, but hardly hints at it otherwise. Rin at least has lots of cute dere moments outside the bedroom.</br>  <br>It's just Nasu who was dedicated to writing reversals for almost every character in FSN. It's all just, "This way it looks completely generic, right? Well, surprise, it's actually the other way!"</br>  <br>Make her so that she was dead before she was conceived.</br>  <br>Simple. Just convince Zouken to adopt right sister.</br>  Sakura is perfect the way she is. She doesn't need to change.  <br>Can you cowtitfags please kill yourselves?<br><br>Stop RUINING perfect bodies with your shit tier pleb taste.</br></br></br>  <br>they're literally the perfect size wtf, do you know what cowtits are</br>  <br>But dude, Sakura is actual cowtits? Officialy confirmed.</br>  <br>Calm down.</br>  <br><br>She was a person in actual trouble and a magical experiment, if you can't feel for that, you have to just admit you are a bit of an asshole. It's fine not being able to relate, but try to widen your perspective.<br><br>Ilya always heartlessly sics a mountain of muscle on Shirou from the start, and could have solved a bunch of problems early on by divulging important info about the grail system, yet people have no issue with her having a route. So arguing the antagonist angle is hypocrisy at its finest. It was hardly just on Sakura that things got fucked up in HF. Or are you really going to blame someone for having their soul and body linked to All the World's Evil against their will? <br><br>Sakura does help Shirou to her detriment a couple times, and gave every dime she had getting him a new body, what are you smoking saying she hasn't done anything for him?<br><br>If you are going to argue that she needs character inprovements, maybe first you could understand her character? That would be helpful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura has always had ridiculous cowtits. Rin is the Heroine of Balance.</br>  <br><br>As expected of flatfags. I don't have a problem with attraction androgyny, but please don't take out your closeted frustrations on people who have an attraction to actual feminine features.</br></br>  <br>Smaller body, white hair, name changed to Ilya.</br>  <br>That sounds gr-WAIT A SECOND</br>  <br>Don't forget giving her Ilya's personality. Ilya with Sakura's personality would still be a shit.</br>  <br> wanting a pedophile route </br>  <br>She's 85cm. I don't know the official designation, but cowtits was always 100cm and up to me.</br>  <br>Not just dere, but in Hollow Ataraxia she becomes completely broken and even develop blank eyes as Sakura.<br><br>Even broken Rin is still pretty lovely.</br></br></br>  <br> take away the rape thing <br><br>Oh god please, that thing was fucking retarded. I cringed through the whole route because of the whole sex worms plot.</br></br></br>  Oh boy, another Rinfag bashing Sakura topic. I'm not even that big a fan of her(Illya&gt;Seiba&gt;Rin&gt;Rider&gt;Bazett&gt;Sa<wbr>kura&gt;Caster&gt;Taiga&gt;Caren) but these topic are obnoxious and add nothing. Can't you two just get along? The characters did.</wbr>  <br> silly, bitchy, smug <br>She mostly like that with Shirou because he's the one she is most comfortable around. It just isn't as overt so people don't tend to notice in all the chatter. That and romantic development in HF is different from the others.</br></br>  <br>Sakura is confirmed E-cup.</br>  <br>Aren't the majority of her scenes like that anyway? There's more "what Sakura is being really pushy" than there is anything else about her in the VN and Hollow is nothing but that.</br>  <br>85E. That's what Taiga said. Jap E-cup is American D-cup.</br>  <br><br>If by slut you mean actually acts like she enjoys being with the one she loves instead of standard "shy maiden #999 broken into pleasure by the MC" then yeah.<br><br>Her seeing he was tired one scene and just giving him some extra service with a bj was pretty realistic given her personality of being empathetic and attentive.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, it was many time hinted that if Sakura wasn't raised by Matous and raped since childhood. Her personality would by pretty much milder version of Luvia.<br>Would you want that?</br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but Luvia is 2rude.</br>  <br>Rin gived Shirou full-blow deepthroat in Eclipse.</br>  <br><br>Wrong. Her tits are normal and not as big as the silicone abominations in the pic.</br></br>  <br><br>It's easier if you translate it to American bra size. Look up 38DD breasts on google, and you are close to what she should have. It's pretty huge.</br></br>  <br> Mild Luvia <br>That's exactly what I want from her, so yes</br></br>  <br>Of course, Luvia a best.</br>  <br>looks like a good deal if her voice can give me boners like that</br>  <br>Have you seen Ufotable version?</br>  Sakura was raped, while TOHSAKA RIN PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY.<br><br>I think we can tell which sister is more virtuous.</br></br>    <br><br>For some reason I have the feeling that Sakura and Luvia would actually get along.</br></br>  <br>i want to rape you luvia</br>  <br>No rape. Make her less Jealous. Some people may still not like her but they just want that 1st heroine they see anyway.</br>  <br>Butthurt Rinfag on board.</br>  <br>Luvia<br> finds a hobo loli <br> gives her food and shelter <br> formally adopts her <br> gives her the family name <br> offers kind and supporting words <br> gives her buckets of Prismabucks <br> buys her stuff <br> puts her in a school where she can make friends and be a kid <br><br>Rin<br> just short of threatens a 10-year-old albino loli into fighting magical monsters to the death <br> breaks the loli bedroom window <br> physically assaults her employer who gave her a job in her time of need despite Rin having verbally abused her in the past </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Luvia thinks she's a cursed burglar cat.</br>  change her seiyuu, or tell her to stop being so fucking breathy all the time it's annoying as shit  <br><br>Sakura also has a banging ass and curves, with that wild but silken hair. Not that Rin is bad, she has excellent legs and gorgeous curly hair.<br><br>Look at Aoi, it's good stock, plus Finnish touch with that Edelfelt blood. You can say what you want about the sisters, but deep in one's heart, they would have to admit they are both hot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luvia is a demon.</br>  <br>Simply get her out of Zouken influence and she will be like that.</br>    <br>I never said I couldn't feel for it, but she's not the only character to have a shitty past, but unlike the others she just waits around for someone to save her. What you said about it not just being on her is correct, but that doesn't mean it's still not her fault to a degree. She became conscious of her and the shadows killings, yet continued anyway. She also could've solved a lot of the problems in the story by letting Shirou kill her, but she didn't want to die, which is understandable, but at the same time, you have to look at what the cost of that is. Like I said, she doesn't feel any regret over the killings until Rin is finally nice to her, only then does she try to stop All Evils of the World from coming out. Also, it was for her that Shirou lost his body in the first place, and Rin was also helping.<br><br>I can see the angle people come from when they defend Sakura and whatnot, and while she does have a tragic past, that doesn't excuse everything that happens in Heaven's Feel.</br></br></br>  <br><br> doesn't feel any regret over the killings <br><br>She didn't even know it was connected to her until day 12, and the game even says in her final battle with Rin she was putting on a facade due to being cornered emotionally. Look at the second nightmare, she freaked the fuck out at even thinking she had someone's blood on her hands. And she cried over Shinji. SHINJI.<br><br>Seriously. I don't mean to be rude, but this selective memory of the route is a terrible thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"The Tohsaka family that threw me away. Nee-san, who lived without any troubles. My scary grandfather and my pitiful brother. The people living peacefully without knowing about my pain. I can't allow such things now.<br>…I know I'm just taking my anger out on others. I know it's wrong, but I still think this way.<br>Yes.<br>I wonder what kind of face the people who haven't helped me will make when they realize I exist."<br><br>"I said there's no need to hide it.<br>You are not another personality. You were swallowed by the mud and have become addicted to violence, but you are still Matou Sakura. You don't need to prepare another personality to excuse yourself. Her face stiffens. He's absolutely right."<br><br>She knows her thoughts are wrong, and she is aware of it all being connected to her at this point, she accepts that this isn't some alternate personality, and she still plans to go through with this anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura  <br> ass <br>no<br> Rin <br> Curly hair <br>no</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was already been proved in HF that Rin isn't capable on enduring what Sakura did.</br>  <br>It wasn't. Nothing actually proves this, it's just fanfiction.</br>  <br> ass <br> no <br>Ass, yes. Her whole body is slamming.</br></br></br>  <br>She is mostly breasts.</br>  <br>Check out BB's ass. She has the same measurements. She puts Rin to shame.</br>  <br>They are the assets most noted, yes.</br>  <br>They all have nice asses dumbass it's 2D. The traits highlight in-universe or author for Sakura and Rin is the point.</br>  <br> She puts Rin to shame. <br>Of course, it's practically memeshit.</br></br>  Replace her  <br>More mollusks. Everything is better with more mollusks</br>  <br>I think it's really Sakurafags just baiting at this point. Pretty sad but report and ignore.</br>   mind broken loli <br> rape by old man <br> rape by onii-chan <br> bug rape <br>stop going through my exhentai history</br></br></br></br>  <br>Worms are kinda like mollusks. We can easily get more worms in there.</br>  <br>Rin is mostly thighs.</br>  What is paizuri with Sakura like?  <br>And ass according to Nasu. It's just how it is.</br>  <br> &gt;bug rape <br>Was that the sequel to the one where the guy kidnapped an idol and tortured her with cuts and needles and stuff? You know, where the girl agrees to star in some rough porn which then goes out of control as soon as the guy shows up with the bugs and then laughs about it when they show it in court?</br></br>  <br>MHX has pretty great thighs as well. Too bad translation never</br>  Make it so that the worms manifest themselves as a cute loli who sticks with sakura all the time.<br><br>This loli should be her complete opposite while still being friendly, that is to say she is openly lewd but secretly pure, teasing and cruel at times, extremely outgoing and lazy.<br><br>This kills two birds with one stone. Now people don't consider it as being used goods since the worms are just as cute and you want to fuck them too. And this way you can circumvent her natural submissiveness by having a character that helps go out of her shell.<br><br>Imagine that demon loli that does the coffee stirring thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Rape <br><br>Unless you mean the worms she was never raped. Of course she was raped if you take as canon something that has not been canon since 2006 more or less, such as the eroge.<br><br>But I guess some people prefer headcanons, what else would I expect from /a/ shitposting general second only to /v/ and /b/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course I mean the fucking worms.</br>  <br>She is not a virgin in F/Z. She was raped by Zouken who is also the worms. Realta Nua doesn't mention anything on her not being raped by worms in fact it implies that she was.</br>  Make her not shit, so basically change everything about her.  <br>Just cyclet stuff</br>  Less worms<br>Fiercer emotions</br>  I just hated reading "Her mollusk expands, trickling love juice onto my lap" at the end of each day.  <br>Did we ever find out who this mysterious character was?</br>  <br>It's a mystery along with the identity to the elusive Kaleido Ruby.</br>  Sakura is cute! CUTE!<br><br>Staff~ Staff~</br></br>  <br> Gentlemen of fine taste spotted <br>I'd buy you a beer for not being one with the rest of the bandwagoning giant-tit-loving fags.</br></br>  <br>Worm~ Worm~</br>  <br>Kirei is technically correct because Dark Sakura is really just Sakura with her negative emotions amplified by All the Evil's and addicted to that sweet power, but remember that this is Kirei talking so there's always a self-serving motive behind it. Kirei would love for Sakura to embrace this evil as if it were simply natural to do those things, instead of separating herself into weak ordinary Sakura and strong evil Sakura. <br><br>Sakura knew what she was doing was wrong but couldn't deny her feelings anymore. That's what she has been doing to the whole time: keeping them locked up, resigning herself to fate. In a moment of weakness, she realized she didn't have to put up with this anymore and let loose and fucked the world that had fucked over her and neglected her. It's petty and selfish but reason and morality alone can't simply erase everything that's happened and how you feel.<br><br>It's not so much that Sakura turned because Rin was nice to her but that after doing the hard way what they should have done from the getgo, Rin forsook her duties and let Sakura know she did love her and she went through hardship as welll. <br><br>HF is about everyone being selfish, really. At least Sakura wants to do something instead of going mission accomplished.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/feg/ pls go</br>  <br>under rated post</br>  <br> gentlemen of fine taste <br>You're just losers trying to boost your self-esteem by being special snowflakes.

Missing out on part of what makes her an adorable and sexy kouhai.</br>  <br><br>That is simplifying it too greatly, and acting as if AM was on the level of the common cold in how it affected her. Did people forget she lost her human functions as rapidly as Iri did without the help of Avalon or any Einzbern sigils, along with a curse that fucks up the spirit of Servants and humans alike?<br><br>She had bitterness and all, but that conversation with Kirei in the forest was 90% hot air to cope with what had transpired, and her shame and grief overtaking her, and 10% frustration. Her final battle with Rin, once she vented, was just, "why did things happen this way?". And the reason we have so many nervous breakdowns is because of the mentality of dealing with trauma like that is, "eh, shit happens." Which is the worst attitude to have.<br><br>Basically, it is like saying someone who beat the shit out of an asshole who pissed on his mother's corpse at a funeral was always a violent person. Further, not accepting that Rin fucked up the chances for her and Sakura to reconcile until the very end, when Sakura was the first to actual try to repair their relationship, misses the point that BOTH sisters had flaws and exacerbated things to an extent. Add to that a tense situation of the magnitude in the route, more dirty laundry and skeletons in the closet than a locker room, and it ended up the way it did.<br><br>That is not discounting that Sakura did make errors in judgement, but it's not like AM was just some equivalent of alcohol induced anger. Nor was this her "true self", because at the end of the day, she did care, otherwise she wouldn't have taken the job as Supervisor or bothered to help restore the city post route. People who just wanted to kill everyone wouldn't freak out at their hands being covered with blood, or like I told that other guy, be so broken up from taking out a guy who was trying to humiliate and rape her. <br><br>It's why I say she is really misunderstood as a character, not noting the positive, and over blowing flaws.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is only behind Ciel by one centimeter, so it's true. Sakura actually has junk in the trunk. <br><br>Nasu even mentions in her bio that she is secretly a maneater like Jinan Tokie. He literally calls her a devilish woman with a maternal instinct, if you can imagine such a thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How many times did you read to reach such a level of understanding?</br>  <br> implying literally drowning in   disporportional as fuck  boobs is as enjoyable as ones that fight slightly and fail to squeeze past your fingers<br><br>It's like you don't even fuck girls.</br></br></br>  fuck you greentext  <br>Except Archer and Kirei noted that she's only pretending.

If we understand them, we'd be sociopaths.</br>  <br>But would she be more popular?</br>  So in HF, Shirou becomes a yandere?  <br>less people would hate her. you're puuling a shirou, dude.</br>  <br>No, Sakura is a yandere.</br>  <br>Yes, but would she be more popular? If she becomes a non-character, she would just go even further down in the polls. She needs to make top three to know that what we've done here meant something. Everyone must love Sakura!</br>  <br>she'd become a character like luvia, bazett, and taiga instead of a character who's universally despised.</br>  <br>That doesn't sound so bad.<br><br>What exactly would Sakura do to Shirou as a maneater?</br></br></br>  <br>But why is she despised? Is it because there's a rivalry between Rin and Sakura that carries over to their fans? I haven't been part of this fandom for too long, so I don't quite know the history behind people's hatred for Sakura.

HA Sakura even allows you to go on date with Rider.</br></br>  <br>Everything.</br>  <br> and even in HF we see nothing but the coating <br><br> revealed to be contrary to what she was expected to be sexually, buttfrustrating nerds <br> kept doing the opposite of what characters wanted her to do <br> becomes evil and goes on rampage <br>Really submissive.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> becomes evil and goes on rampage <br>But that wasn't Sakura, that was Angra Mainyu.  At least that's what all you Sakurafags are quick to say whenever she gets criticised for senseless murder </br></br>  <br>Not me, just calling bullshit when I see it. Sakurafags wanting it both ways doesn't mean you can have it as well.</br>  <br>In other words, keep her the way she is?</br>  <br>I want to live in Old Town</br>  <br>Replace her with Ciel.<br><br>I like her, but I like CIel better.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone likes Ciel.</br>  <br>Nah, fuck Kohaku. The fact that she kill Akiha in one of the ending makes her easily the worst Tsukihime.</br>  <br> But why is she despised? <br>She isn't though, she's routinely one of the highest ranking TM characters in the polls.</br></br>  <br><br>That's the EMIYA route.</br></br>  So this guy is, what, a dimension hopper? does that mean the one in different routes and kaleid and etc are all the same guy?  <br>he'd written 2 better Sakuras</br>  <br> &gt;Tragic backstory without being used goods. <br>Dropped here, fuck you purefag.</br></br>  <br>Loses to Iskandet<br>Loses to Arc</br></br>  <br>Can't fault her for losing to Arc, though. She's best Type Moon.</br>  Why do people keep saying realta nua overtakes the original eroge? in canon? is there a statement from the creators?  <br>It doesn't. At most RN is on equal footing to that uncensored version.</br>  <br> best <br>Even Rin beats Arc</br></br>  <br>Well Rin is the best.</br>  <br><br>But Shiki beats Rin.</br></br>  <br>Well Shiki is the best.</br>  <br><br>Arc, Saber, and Shiki are the big three of TM, saying Arc beats Sakura like it's something incredibly significant underestimates Arc. Also the poll still shows that Sakura is very far from being despised.</br></br>  <br>She got beaten by bara bait.</br>  <br> Arc <br>Replace that with Rin. <br>The New Big three is <br>Saber<br>Shiki <br>Rin</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Chibichuki guy definitely thinks Rin's main girl material.</br>  Is she just blond Ilya?<br><br> Type Venus </br></br>  <br>Popularity wise maybe, but she plays second fiddle to the Mushroom and Mr. Sameface.</br>  <br><br>we're get it. you're gay</br></br>  <br> she plays second fiddle to the Mushroom <br><br> This question is for Mr. Kinoko and Takashi: Out of all the Fate characters, who would you want as a bride? (Without worrying about gender) &lt;Ritsuka&gt; <br><br> Nasu: Rin has been at the top of my list for the last ten years, since she could totally lead such a lost cause as myself. But now, as useless as I am, I would plot to make Kitsune my someone special. <br><br> Takeuchi: With a thought like that you really are hopeless. <br><br> Nasu: And what about you? Probably Saber, right? <br><br> Takeuchi: It’s because she's a glimmering star just out of reach that she's beautiful. I couldn't call her my bride. Though for some reason I think Shielder from Grand Order would be the ideal bride. <br><br> Nasu: Really? No kidding (smirks). I guess you can look forward to the next volume of Grand Order! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so she would be nearly as popular as the other two heroines? <br>Wait until the HF movies and further into the HF manga.<br><br>Why do you people care about popularity anyway? Some people are going to like her and some aren't, I like my Sakura the way she is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> rin <br> shielder <br> ubw interview <br> fgo being release in july <br>You're not tricking me into giving you money</br></br></br></br></br>  So is the archer we see in F/SN a clone or not like the others or is he like saber in the he is the original?    <br><br><br>Tits have levels you autists. It's not one or the other. The is such a thing as the perfect balanced tits that are not disgusting oversize cowtits, but not too small.<br><br>But whatever, I'm an assman anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isnt it time to prep the bull for your wife, you cuckold?</br>  <br>loving someone despite the fact that they were raped doesn't make you a cuck.</br>  <br>The answers lie in the visual novel, my friend, specifically the UBW route.</br>  <br>Copy, the real EMIYA is stuck in the janitorial closet and forever doomed to be incapable to reach peace with himself.</br>  <br>He wants to change the fact that she was raped and you dont want that and insult him.<br>That means you like the fact that your waifu was raped and that makes you a cuckold.</br></br>  <br>The anime seems to have dropped that little plot element.</br>  <br> character was raped <br> cuck </br></br>  <br> doesnt want to change the backstory <br> likes the fact that she was raped <br> not cuck </br></br></br>  <br>Nasu went over the fact that he wanted the UBW anime to stand on its own. That's why he wrote the extended epilogue which was supposed to give proper closure to the route. He went on about how the original ending to UBW was hampered down a bit due to the fact that the player was supposed to move onto HF afterward.<br><br>I think the whole "he'll forget this" thing was added to account for that. You head to the next route, and Archer's character is essentially reset. With the anime, which just has a beginning and an ending, that whole thing isn't needed.</br></br></br>  <br>What is the reason for changing it in the first place? I don't think anyone enjoys that she was raped but, why get rid of it? To preserve some her virginity or some shit like that? Seems like a stupid reason.</br>  <br> changing her backstory to something tragic, just not rape <br> appeasing autist who care about purity <br>Congratulations she's still going to be miserable, but atleast she's a virgin.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the first guy and Sakura isn't my waifu, Manaka is. That being said, I probably wouldn't change the rape backstory as it's literally one of the only things that makes her mental breakdown and decent into madness even remotely acceptable the same goes for Kohaku and Fujino. There is nothing besides their histories of brutal sexual assault that could possible justify the actions they take and removing it from their histories just to make them more palatable a few is incredibly stupid.</br>  <br><br> Sakura with cowtits </br></br>  <br><br>lovely</br></br>  <br>they're pretty big in the manga</br>    <br>Seeing this just makes you realise how much dick worms ruin the story. They coul dhave easily gone with more believeable experiments.</br>  <br><br>She's always been the most busty of the main Heroines.</br></br>  Sakura was always SUPPOSED to have cowtits, it's just Takeuchi didn't know how to draw tits in a uniform worth a damn. her chest is closer to what it's supposed to be in the h-scenes when they're free  <br><br>Well the problem is that people just dumb it down to "rape", but it was body modification and experimentation. We got accounts from the girl herself that Zouken poisoned her, changed her very magical nature and all that, something that would kill most people or shorten their lives to a fraction of what it should be. And she survived, and tries to smile to the point most people would never know. If you end up a tortured lab rat for a decade, most people would be strung out completely or catatonic.<br><br>Well, now that the HF manga shows more of her perspective, maybe it will help show that. The next chapter is the night Zouken tries to troll her into fighting in the war by saying she can to slaves if she doesn't want to kill masters. Basically a bribe since he knows about Shirou and Rin. That scene was great because it showed how embittered she was, but and so how intelligent she was to understand how full of shit he was trying to make her fight. And she refuses his offer.</br></br></br></br>  Make her less of an annoying "pity me" character. Jesus christ, she was god awful annoying.  <br>These are not cowtits.</br>  <br>Spawning swords out of the nowhere, ancient spirits summoned to fight for a cup that does nothing, King Arthur but as a woman, etc. A pit of magic parasites the drive people insane is hardly outrageous in this series. It more likely you have a problem with them being linked with sex and being phallic shaped.</br>  <br>Considering Archer is summoned in every timeline at the same time, it's safe to assume that EMIYA only gets his answer when UBW Archer fades.</br>  <br>King Arthur being a girl is less ridiculous than being raped by worms for 10 years and still coming out as some semblance of a human being.</br>  <br>When you look at them at least they've been explained in a way that fits. Fantasy you can always give a little leeway for but the worms felt like a bad plot point as it is, with the little information about them not really validating them as part of the story.</br>  <br>And also I'm aware that Sakura was mostly extremely reserved around people who weren't Shirou.<br><br>What I'm saying is you force a 6 year old girl to experience being fucked by worms for a decade, and you'd just end up with a mumbling retard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Believable? Like a guy knocking up a one year old homunculus and letting his daughter have experiments in the womb? Or a set of twin girls adopted into a family to be sexed up to calm the blood of demon hybrids. It's as believable as you make it out to be.<br><br>About the only thing that could trip you up about Sakura is that they look like penises, but there are worm like things in real life that look like that, and in HF, Zouken has crickets and other bugs as familiars as well, they were all over the temple when Lancer fought Hassan and the Shadow. You even see those in Zero. And seriously, if you can get off to knowing a girl is getting messed up by man eating familiars who eat vomit in a pit of rotting corpses, you're a little more than a bit messed up.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Fund it. I don't know how, and frankly I don't care.  Just do it. </br>  <br><br>She wasn't "fucked" by them. They travel all through her body in between her muscles. You do know they do more than go in and out of her genital regions right? Sakura did go into detail about how they cause sensory deprivation and asphyxiation torture to her, as well as extreme pain.<br><br>We got a scene where she says her rededucation entailed the worms burrowing through her internal organs and muscles, twisting them in ways where she couldn't breathe trying to find magical energy. Nothing at all sexual about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer will get rekt. If Lancelot is summoned as a Saber he will most likely have a Excaliblast since he will not be a vengeful spirit.</br>  <br>Actually Arc got most first place voters than Rin did. Which means Arc has the largest amount of dedicated fans compared to Rin. I take that as a win.</br>  <br>What part about Zouken's training isn't explained in a way that fits. The crazy old man that seeks the grail experiments on the daughter he was given, turning her into a lesser grail and sending her to the pit so he can eventually use her to renew his decaying bloodline.</br>  <br> Sakura did go into detail about how they cause sensory deprivation and asphyxiation torture to her, as well as extreme pain. <br><br>Wow thank you anon for further proving she should probably be a drooling retard being hobbled around in a wheelchair.<br><br>Like, you see those types of stories of what happens when kids get extreme abuse? They don't exactly come out fully functioning.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They don't exactly come out fully functioning. <br>Does this look like the face of a fully functioning adolescent? She was even worse of before she met Shrou.<br><br>What do you want? For her to be a vegetable or incapacitated?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was raped by Zouken intially and repeatedly by Byakuya to prepare her for the worm pit. While only 6 years old. Unless you want to declare Fate/Zero non canon as well.</br>  <br><br>And we are shown Taiga and Shirou helped make her more cheerful. And even then, the manga, showing more of her perspective, shows us she takes things a day at a time, and is rather melancholic as long as she isn't around those two. When Shirou catches her in her thoughts alone, she has a "fuck my life" look on her face.<br><br>Her fortitude and the fact she has huge magical potential were the reasons why she doesn't end up like the other past members of the Matous. Dead or looking like a stroke victim.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole point I'm making is that the level of abuse she suffers is so over the top that it goes over the point of where I'm sympathetic and moved on to it just being practically comical. Say it was rape, say it was torture, it doesn't matter, she got her shit shoved in for 10 years and somehow isn't in a mental institution.</br>  <br> responding to bait </br>  <br>I can understand the need to implant the holy grail, and you would either need to do place them in the host via surgery or use the worms to enter the host. But the fact that the worms won't eat the female flesh and only their mental energy is odd and isn't a strong point.</br>  <br> Sakura isn't my waifu, Manaka is. <br>Can you even read Japanese or is it purely superficial?</br></br>  <br><br>Then you don't really understand abuse victims or the human condition.<br><br>There are women in real life who come out of literal rape dungeons where they are forced to ingest the flesh of their fellow captives for sport, and they can form coherent sentences and aren't drooling on the floor catatonic.<br><br>I mean fuck man, our main character himself walked through a city of burning bodies of people screaming for help at six, and he is functional to the point nobody questions his mental state until they get closer to his abnormality. The same with Sakura, Rin stalks her, and she normally looks like she doesn't give a shit about anything unless she talks with Shirou.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would make all her happy ends, Shinji ends.</br>  <br> the worms won't eat the female flesh and only their mental energy is odd and isn't a strong point. <br>They feed on the mucus membrane in the woman's vagina. What are they going to feed on in side of a man? They just eat the males flesh and blood, and if the woman runs out of magical energy she's also eaten. That's what happened to shinji's mom, and probably all of the other corpses inside the catacombs in the pit.</br></br>  <br>I don't know what to say to you if you find her past comical, but that seems like a you problem.</br>  <br> Can you even read Japanese <br>no, but I can read Chinese and I know a place were I can read Chinese translations of the LN chapters.</br></br>  <br>Shirou suffered one traumatic incident, but was then raised in a loving home by people who cared about him. He still ended up being a completely broken human being.<br><br>Sakura suffered continuous traumatic experiences for the age of 6~ to until now and was raised by her abusers. She's Shirou taken to 11 in terms of being screwed up, it's practically incomparable.<br><br><br>Saying someone got raped by worms for a decade is the start of a really dark joke.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  not her looks and body of course, she's a 10 <br> 10 <br><br>Not even close.<br><br>Dead fish eyes, ears too low down face and a dumpy look =/= a 10</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Manaka <br>As far as TM waifus go, you could do worse.</br></br>  <br><br>There is a caveat to that I think people don't get. For men or women, if you can't handle the worms, you die. That isn't male centered. They talk of mental energy, but it is all life energy. Rider takes energy from people via making a connection through dreams as well as sucking blood. But life energy is taken in all cases. Since spirits and familiars can't subsist on anything else but taking energy from the living. Zouken himself is basically a specter who can eat food, but life energy is his nourishment.</br></br>  <br><br>AH okay, life energy makes more sense and then they eat the flesh.<br>How is it that sakura then is able to live for so long? was shinji rape actually helping due to sexual release?</br></br></br>  <br>She should kill Rin in HF and not feel the least bad about that. That's the only thing I want to change about her.</br>  <br>She had incredible talent for magic, same reason why Rider was willing to let bloodfort run while Sakura was still inside of it, but instead of being sent to a house to learn she was sent to a place where her talent would be used to not die like everyone else. She eventually gets her happy end in HF so being sent to the Matou wan't entirely bad.</br>  <br><br>Shirou walked to his house for a long time, imaging walking through a house that wasn't there, and smiling at a mother who was already dead before he settled down with Kerry, and even then, just pushed down his trauma instead of dealing with it.<br><br>The point was that everyone handles trauma differently, because we are all different, that is why psychology is a trade, because people are all different.<br><br> When she talks to Shirou about the abuse, she calmly talked to him somberly about how she endured it, by flatly stating that if she couldn't endure, she would have died. <br><br>You saw her in Zero, right? Her mentality was such that she created a shield of "don't give a fuck", even when she is naturally more empathetic toward others, see Shinji. <br><br>She is far from being normal, but she is the type that more often turns inward instead of angrily lashing out, working things out by adapting to a logical tenet of rationality to cope. Shirou and Taiga broke that shield of apathy she made over the years.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do not kill The Rin.</br>  <br>Replace her with Eddie Murphy wearing a fat suit.</br>  <br>Rin is a cunt in HF and deserved the bad end where she was tortured. It really should have been part of the True End.</br>  <br><br>She already kills the cunt in the good end.</br></br>  <br>Having an ending where they don't get along or one of them kills the other would've been cool. Illya's route could've been the Hisui route to Sakura's Kohaku route.</br>  <br>Anon, there's stuff like suspension of disbelief to consider. It's much easier to come to understand and sympathize with a character who was mentally screwed up by events like having their family killed and seeing countless people die before them. It happens in catastrophes and in war torn countries and in other situations like that.<br><br>I don't think people have a proper understanding of what it must be like to be raped by worms for 10 years. That just goes beyond anything that can be rationalized, which can hurt the ability to sympathize. you may be able to sympathize with her, but look at the people who just crack jokes about her situation. It can go past the point of "wow that's sad", to being "wow that's ridiculous".</br></br></br>  <br>Then i can understand that the more magic circuits the better, and the worms help in that way but wouldn't the grail itself just be fine as is for a vessel of magic? wouldn't it have mad emore sense to put the pieces in her without the risk of the worms eating her before the time? considering the grail war was only 10 years it seems like a waste in that sense if the war had started at the proper time.</br>  <br><br>No, being sent to the Matous was bad, her father just didn't put as much thought and effort into finding a decent home. Even he thought the Makiri were a shit dying family before he suddenly got bailed out by them when he had one too many kids.<br><br>It would be ridiculous that no family would want a superchild like her if he did his research "before" she was born instead of putting himself in a crunch right after. That is what family planning is, but the parents in the Nasuverse aren't really good at the parenting thing, however much they might have cared for their kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No, being sent to the Matous was bad <br>Maybe I worded it strangely. I wasn't saying that it was a good thing. I was saying things eventually got better and she had her happy ending with Shirou. Sort of a silver lining kind of deal. Like if tragedy strikes a community, but everyone comes closer together because of it.</br></br>  <br>That's a popularity poll.<br> Popular =/= Best </br></br>  Keep her the way she is, but perhaps make her less submissive to her sister.  <br>Nobody else was living in Fuyuki, though. Her guaranteed participation in the Grailbowl takes precedence over her personal happiness and well-being.</br>  <br><br>Well, I just was making the point that stuff almost to that level happens irl, whether we accept it as real or not males no difference, but I get what you mean. Relateability is hard in some cases. <br><br>And in Zero, she did have someone die in front of her, which cemented her rationality of not disobeying. What better way to temper a five year old's possible rebellion against you then showing them someone they cared about being eaten by monstrous creatures, and keeping his familiars inside her that can end her life with a thought.<br><br>It's no worse than a mob boss shooting a kid's parents in front of them, and keeping snipers and a camera on them at all times to enforce a set of rules. In both cases it is a system of fear and control, which is perfectly understandable, at least to me.<br><br>Further we get more from her than suffering, I cite again her talk with Shirou and what she thought of the Matous magecraft. She doesn't like how it takes but doesn't give back. It shows she isn't wholly uninterested in learning magecraft, which is further proven in the endings, where she seeks out a mentor on her own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HF mentions that Zouken made a deal with her father to use her to achieve their mutual goal, whatever the means. I think it's say to say her father probably did know of kinder homes, but those home probably would give him what HE wanted.</br>  <br> to use her to achieve their mutual goal, whatever the means. <br>To reach the Root. It's all about reaching the Root.</br></br>  Post Sakura and Shirou love  <br>Why does everyone want to reach Void Shiki when Mikiya has her?</br>  <br><br>Exactly, that makes you a good magus, but a shitty parent.</br></br>        <br><br><br>More please</br></br></br>      <br>What is this saying?</br>  <br>Rin and Sakura killing each other in Illya's route is something I could get behind</br>  <br>Of course there can only be one winner, and we both know who that will be.</br>    <br><br>The only acceptable Sakura.</br></br>  I just want more of this Shirou. The whole 'burned' look is pretty neat.  <br>Would Young Sakura and Shirou be a good couple?</br>  <br><br>Is Rin jealous about not having her imouto all to herself? I know she got mad when she heard Shirou gets breakfasts made by her often, said he must think he is a king or something. And she gets pretty irritated when she and Shirou imagine all the girls in maid outfits in Hollow. When he got to Sakura, she got pretty pissed.</br></br>  <br>First panel: Staring sound effect<br>Second: Chuu (Probably insinuating a long kiss)<br>Third pannel: Kya~with hearts (probably embarrassed about what she just did)<br>バ(?)<br>Ba-something it think. Baka? maybe that's it because she's embarrassed.<br><br>Last panel: おるいだろ [Oruidaro] (Probably has something to do with Shirou waking up)<br>Huh?<br><br>I don't know japanese</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shirou is not even in a real body. No matter what it's made of, it's still more of a fake than he is.</br></br>  <br>I'd love a miniseries following up UBW by the guys who do Prisma Illya, showing Shirou, Rin, Waver etc. returning to Fuyuki and dismantling the grail. Could have Shirou achieve that status in the fight against Zouken.</br>  <br>Read Prisma.</br>  <br>I doubt we'll ever get a proper continuation of any of the routes, sadly.<br><br>I'm just super thankful we got the Clock Tower stuff with the epilogue to UBW.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The soul makes the body real, this was already explained.

He's more aware than anyone that the Grail is busted.</br>  <br>Why am I reminded of Eren and Mikasa with this?</br>      <br>Because he doesn't care about that anymore. He doesn't even remember why he wanted the Grail in the first place, he hardly even remembers who he is by the time the 5th war ends.</br>    <br> the fight against Zouken. <br>Or they could just wait a few months until the old wormgeezer croaks for good.</br></br>  <br>More kissing art please</br>  <br>I wish I knew how to clean color pages, this woulds make a half decent wallpaper.</br>  <br>Who is the artist of this?</br>  <br>https://twitter.com/geronimp00/stat<wbr>us/622702927296094208/photo/1</wbr></br>  Why didn't she save Shinji?  <br>Rin should had died in Fate.</br>  <br>RIN WILL NEVER DIE!</br>  How did Sakura and Shirou meet in the first place?

Some money making scheme.</br>  Why is Sakura so mean to Taiga?<br>All Taiga does is try and get Shirou and Sakura together.</br>  <br>Well, Nasu already gave one possible answer for this question:<br><br> TOHSAKA is a "miraculous" Heroic Spirit born in a world line in which Shirou Emiya did not become the Heroic Spirit EMIYA. <br> Because of her severe debt, she made a contract with the World to become a Heroic Spirit. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure you's be embarrassed too if Taiga was telling Shirou about your breast size and saying, "doesn't it wake you want to touch them" or "give me some of the meat".</br>  <br>Ok shitman</br>  <br>No anon, Sakura is better</br>  <br>men<br>money</br></br>  <br>Nah that's horseshit.</br>  <br>It's not like he's going to notice on his own.<br>Taiga is just trying to help.</br></br>  <br>That proportion ratio looks stupid as fuck</br>  <br>How does it feel to know that number 8 won Shirou in the true canon despite all odds?</br>  <br>It's based off this.</br>  Melty Blood HD staring Shirou, Saber, Rin and Gilgamesh!  <br>Taiga just wants Shirou to find someone nice. She's excited to see him date Rin.</br>  <br>That would be good. Sakura shouldn't have been an actual heroine, Rin deserved to get just as much focus as a heroine as Saber and Sakura.</br>  <br>So that's where Gilgamesh's coat went.</br>  <br>Kid Gil probably likes Taiga.</br>  Just like 10 more hours until the Moon Fever, are you fags ready for rapist Miia, Horsepussy and Papi?<br><br>Also, still looking for japanese raws of ch35. <br><br>If you want to see the specials here are they:<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>And if some fegets don't know where to watch the episode of tomorrow:<br>  douyutv.com/5275  </br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First for Cerea</br>  Second for the awooo~ that will never be.  Cosplay shit goes   Are the translations out yet?  <br>All hail based Rachnee, her introduction episode cannot come soon enough</br>  <br> What time does it air tomorrow?  </br>  <br>Can you read the OP retard?</br>  <br>tfw no wolf girl + human cop duo<br><br> &gt;she will never wag her tail when she's complimented on catching her first criminal </br></br></br>  <br> For fucks sake why does fucking 4chan x keep sticking on my trip. It was fine last thread. </br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, I see.</br></br>  Why does she have a navel if harpies come from eggs?  <br><br>When would they even introduce the wolf-girl partner, a one-shot or during a normal chapter?<br><br> I'd say "if only there was a way to bring this idea up to Crab", but he probably gets enough "suggestions" as it is. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Monster Girls</br>  <br> Why does she have a navel if harpies come from eggs? <br><br>What do you think chick embryos are connected to in the egg?</br></br></br>  <br><br> These fucking animeonlyfags <br><br>At least read the fucking manga you faggots, there is no wolf but a Kitsune.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I dont know that much about egg birth, but I dont think that is correct</br></br>  <br>I have read the manga, anon. Did you read the last thread at all?</br>  <br> At least read the fucking manga you faggots, there is no wolf but a Kitsune. <br><br>See  and <br><br>This is also excluding Polt, who is a "wan-wan edition Kobold."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wan wan <br><br>I keep seeing that and I still have no idea what that means.</br></br></br>  <br>That was explained long time ago.<br><br>Every girl on MonMusume world keeps the standard way of give birth, that means Miia-Papi-Mero lay eggs, Rachnee (I have no idea), Cerea just drop the shit out of her pussy. The only thing different here is about the girls can get pregnant from a normal human or someone from the same race.</br></br></br>  <br>chickens have belly buttons, why wouldn't Papi?</br>  <br>Why do Rachnera and Miia have a navels?</br>  <br><br>Wan-wan is the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound a dog makes while barking, much like the English onomatopoeia for the same sound is "woof-woof."<br><br> Fun fact, the ancient Greeks believed toads went "Brekekeke Coax Coax," we learn this from surviving records of a play featuring toads. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't try to fool people fags, that's only from the start of Monmusume and doesn't mean you know about the manga. Also if yoy really knows about it you should post some pages of the last 3 chapters translated.</br></br>  <br>Are birds in the belly button circle? Well, get this: Inside a bird's egg there is a tiny cord that connects the developing embryo to the yolk sac. When the egg cracks open, the hatchling does in fact have a miniscule residual scar where the cord was. As the nestling grows up, the scar fades. It's pretty much invisible by the time the bird takes its first giant step from the nest.<br><br>So, yes, baby birds do have a belly button. But it's more like a temporary tattoo.</br></br></br>  Can someone post the Jurassic World spoilers, you know the one with anime dinos? Please.  <br> Also if you really knows about it you should post some pages of the last 3 chapters translated. <br><br> That doesn't actually prove anything, all I'd need to do is go on Mangahere and crop some pages.<br><br>Mero is a princess, Ninetei gets off on power, lizards are dumb and Yukio is a copyright infringement.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>Spiders carry thousands of children insife of them until that all burst from the abdomen and ride the mother until they are large enough to devour her.

RIP.</br>  Monstergirl 24/7 threads back?  <br>Oh, she got ripped, alright.</br>  <br>Too soon.</br>  <br> I honestly found that whole scene kinda fucked up/a bit disturbing. Like all the other characters die kinda "Off screen", or they die in relatively "quick" scenes, but for whatever odd reason they decided to give her this really weird, gratuitous scene where the dinosaurs basically torture her and play with her for a whole two minutes before she died. Like you'd expect that for the villain, but instead they do it for this character who's not even there long enough for the audience to really learn anything about her. </br>  <br>Who ever came up with this line is the philosopher of our time.</br>  <br>I was laughing hysterically when she died. That was so fucking funny.</br>  <br><br>Mosasaur.</br></br>  <br><br>Mosasaurus, if memory serves.<br><br>I felt it kind of added realism to it when I was watching, didn't realise the shitstorm it generated online. Like "You're never 100% safe until you're off the island."</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not long enough.</br>  <br>The dinos don't really torture her willingly, they just fight over her.</br>  <br>Right, I know it's just animals fighting over food, it was just kinda torturous looking, if that makes sense, like how she was tossed around like a ragdoll and whatnot, chewed on by various dinosaurs.</br>  Cerea and papi are so fucking annoying in the anime, holy fuck.<br><br>Smith actually is best girl.</br></br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br> Cerea and papi are so fucking annoying in the anime, holy fuck. <br><br>Papi is best in design and animation but worst in voice.<br><br>I mean, the actress herself is good but "excitable little Japanese girl" is always grating.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean best?</br>  I just want Miia to insert me into herself and full body hug my close while kissing me and telling me that she loves me  <br>We've been back since anime was announced<br><br>Keep it mon musu related<br>No MGE</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's physically impossible<br>Miia has nonexistant DEEPthroat<br>she eats small meals and cooks eggs before she eats them<br>she's a Lamia not a fucking snake<br>Suu is VORE fetish</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is a snake! Not your waifu!</br></br>   Ranchera wears super-lewd swimsuit when she is alone, but puts on a shirt before going to everyone. <br>That's just too cute.</br>  This show is the worst most flagrant fanservice bullshit I've ever seen<br>but i have a fetish for lamias so i'm going to keep watching it</br>  <br>Listen, the dude started this off as a series of NSFW one-shots of monstergirls.<br>I think it's safe to say you should've known what you were getting into from day one.</br></br>  <br><br>It's even cuter if you consider she put on a shirt not because there was a crowd, but because Darling was there.<br><br>Girl is clearly interested in him, her bondage-play with him during the marriage chapter was evidence enough; when Rachnee does her BDSM thing with the monster-girls it heavily incorporates humiliation and domination, but what she does with Darling seems more mutual and "playful."</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about. <br>I meant my penis into her vagina<br>How the fuck is she supposed to hug and kiss me if I'm in her stomach</br></br></br>  <br>If Papi falls in love they'll be the memory she holds onto after everything else goes, but she did make that kinda really casual attitude about sex sound typical of harpies.<br><br>Not wanting to keep her remains fucked up.</br></br></br>  So guys. Guys. Imagine this. A NEET Dragon girl who hordes figures and other character goods as her treasure pile. Sleeps in a veritable mountain of dakimakuras. It's such an obvious archetype, so why the fuck hasn't it been made yet.  <br><br> Go doggy on Papi, push her off so she stumbles three steps forward.  <br> "Hubby! We do honeymoon tonight?" <br> Repeat <br> See dermatologist in the morning for ointment. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's such an obvious archetype, so why the fuck hasn't it been made yet. <br><br>Because we haven't seen a dragon girl yet, but /tg/ has talked about that archetype for months, and still talking about it today.</br></br></br>  <br> It's such an obvious archetype <br>That's why.</br></br>  <br>Penis in Vagina there friend, I think you need some sleep.</br>  <br>Obvious doesn't always mean bad.</br>  <br>Ok, since no kind anon answered my small request, I shall ask again: Does anyone have the picture of Rachnee being harassed by about 8 or 9 little loli spider babies?</br>  MONSTAH  Hmm... This thread lacks Suu.  Kii colors  Best day of the week already? good.  <br>I wonder why Today Suu doesn't have the visible core of Proto-Suu. <br>Not to mention she had a much more defined face. <br><br>I think only Rachne and Cerea survived with limited to no changes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The visual looks nice.

I watched NGE in the 90's and that's a fact that'll stick with me no matter what.<br><br>You enjoy the fanservice spinoffs, at least it gives you fuel to pretend Rei isn't the best.</br></br></br>  <br>Asuka. All day every day.</br>  <br> samefagging </br>  <br>You weren't even born in the '90s. Asuka had fantastic background story and really nice development. Sure, Rei started being more than an apathetic faggot at times, but her career saw a bitter end.<br><br>Not to mention I'd let Asuka step on me anytime. Happily.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretending that everyone who has a different taste than you do are just one person samefagging won't change the fact that there is someone out there with a different taste. Your AT field is in danger. Descend into madness now, my /a/utistic fellow.</br>  <br>I was born in the 80's, and Rei's background story and development is better.</br>  <br>I was born in the 60s, and I think she's just a poor man's Nadeshiko</br>  <br>Poor man's Nadeshiko &gt; Poor man's Kushana clone and otaku bait</br>  <br>You were born in the 90's and you only like Asuka because it's a fanservice character.<br><br>Rei is the superior Evangelion girl from the original and always will be.</br></br></br>  <br>Despite the same similarity in backstory, Asuka's demeanor is still unique enough to be considered her own character. Unlike Rei.</br>  <br> you only like Asuka because it's a fanservice character <br>I like Asuka because she doesn't act like a stoic cold tuna as some faggot rubs her tits. Talk about fanservice.</br></br>  <br>You like Asuka because she rubs her tits in your face and begs you for sex. Talk about fanservice.</br>  <br>Asuka's demeanor isn't unique at all, it's standard anime fare. Slapstick, bitchiness, fanservice and dere. <br>Rei is the character that's "all new" from scratch, it's also the character that inspired a new archetype and is considered the most original.<br><br>You're just into the character due to some weird feitsh like being stepped on: </br></br></br></br>  <br>You like Rei because she stands naked letting old men fondle her tits. Talk about fanservice.</br>  When does the BD come out?  <br>I like Rei because if anyone did that, they get their shit wrecked like in EoE - total humiliation and defeat. <br><br>You like Asuka because all she ever amounts to is being a little girl who'll latch onto anyone in her proximity with a dick. Talk about fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br>You like Rei because she literally let someone do that to her. Twice. Total humiliation and defeat- she lives to please and act for men. Never for her own desire or will.<br><br>You like Rei because she's just a fuckdoll for the males of the series and allows them to step all over her like a doormat as she shows her tits and vag to the entire Earth. Talk about fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br>Nadeshiko submissive fuckdoll is not a new archetype. It's the archetype of every single woman in Japan.</br>  <br>Too bad that's not Rei, if anyone is the fuckdoll it's Asuka for literally being masturbated to just lying still like a doll.</br>  <br>Because she was actually comatose. Meanwhile Rei allowed herself to be groped by Shinji and Gendo just like the ideal Japanese wife. Absolutely no respect or shame for herself. Disgusting.</br>  <br>I like Rei because she didn't let someone do that on her. It was on accident the first time and necessary/coincidental the second, the latter time revenge was served.<br><br>You like Asuka because she only lives to please and act for men. She asks Kaji to have sex with her and offers herself to Shinji, Asuka is totally easy<br><br>You like Asuka because she'll lay entirely still while some masturbates to her, accepting her role as Evangelion's official sex object for male otaku such as yourself.<br><br>I like Rei because when Asuka was busy being a sex toy, Rei saved Asuka on more than one occasion and regained her legacy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuka gets like &lt;75% of ALL eva fan art.</br>  <br>She knew he was masturbating, and she just lay there. That's how you prefer Asuka, as an object that satisfies your sexual desire. Nothing more.<br><br>Rei doesn't allow herself to be groped, they were accidents or coincidental. She isn't afraid or wimpy like Asuka is, Rei is hard, tough and unafraid. A real ideal.<br><br>Unlike Asuka, Rei doesn't fret over small things and hates herself. Because Asuka hates herself, has no respect for herself - that's her own admission.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Rei gets accidentally touched once and doesn't flip out, then kudos to Rei. It was as much her own fault.<br>The second time is part of invoking some god-ancient ritual, and Rei makes it pretty clear that Gendo doesn't control her in any way. Gendo was never as humiliated as that.<br><br>This right here is lack of self-respect.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> actually liking the Gendo's personal cumdumpster for years upon years <br>Yikes.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like Ritsuko.<br><br>But I bet you like worst girl and slut-in-training Asuka, pretty much the village bike of Tokyo-3 scheduling dates with every boy in town.</br></br></br>  Rei &gt; Aslutka.  I'll go with Rei.<br>Usually in Anime and Manga the strange colored hair symbolize a similar human color (ex: Dark Blue = Dark) with the exception of non-humans or Humans from other worlds. Only in recent years the mangaka expect that green hair is actually normal.<br>Rei is obviously an albino, and I like albinos... at least the pretty ones.<br>Asuka on the other hand has a horrible personality.</br></br></br>  Would you wear this?  <br>While driving this morning, I saw some 12-year old boy walking on the sidewalk wearing that and the green cape.<br><br>What the fuck has this world come to.</br></br></br>  It be cool to wear to a biker bar as long as nobody knew what the fuck it was.  <br>No, it's a mediocre anime and that shirt is really made for guys.</br>  If I wasn't a fat piece of shit, maybe.  <br>No, I'm not a prostitute.</br>  Have you sworn your complete and undying allegiance to Ainz-sama today, anon?<br><br>Episode 2 airs in exactly 1 hour from now.</br></br>  <br>FUCK I mean episode 3</br>  <br>Hello anon, we're from the future and episode 3 airs in one hour for us<br>Hahaha you must be mad</br></br>  <br> Episode 2 <br>Shit start OP-kun.</br></br>  so how is it?<br><br>I usually wait for ep 3 to determine /a/'s drop rate and then decide for myself.</br></br>  <br>We already have a thread. Why can't you use the catalog so we can keep our shit in one thread?</br>  <br> wanting generals <br> Wanting it to be in a thread that was created by accident and doesn't even have the title in the subject area </br></br>  I fucking love the OP. It starts of with my overlord grabbing for jewels, though it seems kind of 'cute' how he holds his flag at the end. Overlords usually have flag bearers. I also like the fact that the video got 400k clicks in 14 days.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jMo<wbr>VmSV4yA8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>3 will be the first taste of action, though it's just a sample because the second half will be about checking if his bitcoins can be used in the new world without looking like an ignoramus.</br>  <br>Episode 1 was so fucking bad, that's all I watched and all I plan in watching</br>  <br>You had one job, OP, but you decided to suck cock instead. gg, OP. gg...</br>  <br> doing a job <br> sucking cock <br><br>I know what I'd choose.</br></br></br></br>  Anyone have that slowpoke skeleton?  This anime definitely needed quite a lot more trimming in regards to the original material. Two whole episodes with absolutely nothing happening is like an invite to failure.  <br>Why do everyone seemingly miss the point of the flying scene and the world domination joke? I thought it was important, bur i dont really know if this series is properly paced as an adaption or not.</br>  Chapter 3 of volume 5 when?  <br>El psy fuckingwut</br>  definitely my show of the season so far<br><br>Im just a sucker for good guy stuck in bad guy's body. Loved it back in DBZ, love it now.<br><br>But Overlord also goes to show how people treat fantasy games differently. He roleplayed an evil overlord, but as soon as he's the real deal, he starts acting nice and polite to his underlings. It is like a big fuck you to anyone that wants to suggest violence in video games causes violence in real life.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh boy<br><br>ohhhh booooyyyy<br><br>yer in for a treat</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol best OP-kun today</br>  <br> Im just a sucker for good guy stuck in bad guy's body. <br>You and me both. It just constantly makes me curious as to how the good guy would treat being in the bad guy's body.</br></br>  Albedo best girl  who is streaming the episode?  <br>Saturday I think</br>  <br>i think you time travelled OP</br>  So whay's the exact air time in Japan? 2300?

HNG<br>DAT TOUCH-ME</br>  wow, is that the death animation in the game haha  <br>Naaaah.<br><br>His PC Avatar in whose body he's stuck made him colder. <br><br>Even he admits himself that him becoming undead made him change to some point.</br></br></br></br></br>   PAPA BONES HELPS THE VILLAGE BECAUSE HE USED TO BE GANKED WHEN HE WAS A SCRUBLORD AND SOMEONE HELPED HIM     There is just no fucking way that Ainz is less than 1,80 cm. He towers everyone.   yfw this measly lvl1 villager then becomes lvl4 villager, lvl 1 sergeant, lvl 2 General and lvl 2 commander thanks to goblin army   <br>Touch Me is such sexy bastard</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  PAPA BONE'S TIME TO.....<br><br>I am bad with bone puns</br></br>  Dang, that sucker is huge  Stupid Sexy Albedo in Armor  I want to fuck albedo in that armor  Not a single good KAAAAYYAAAAADUUUUWOOOOOOOOO CCCCCCCEEEEEEEBUUUUUUUUTSSSSSSUUUU yet  TWINKING FUCK.<br>CANCER, EVERYONE.</br>  <br><br> you will never touch him </br></br>  <br>YOU'VE GOT THE TOUCH!<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AZK<wbr>pByV5764</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  It even heals clothes!  This feels a bit rushed doesn't it. But, oh well.  THANK YOU BASED PAPA BONES    low quality desu naito  this fucking shitty chinese stream  <br>According to vol 4 he's 2,5 meters.</br>  <br>It's latter explained that those potions are literally liquid magic made using alchemy something.</br>  Desu knight actually doesn't look so bad in motion.  Desu Knighto is fucking spoopy  I think he's dead already  <br>My. He's fit to be a basketball player.</br>  That was fucking brutal.  <br>use this <br/></br>  TELL ME ABOUT BONES<br>WH DOES HE WEAR THE MASK</br>  <br>There's no such thing as overkill for those Theocracy bastards.</br>  They're not skipping anything important. <br><br>I'm pleased.</br></br>  why does he wear the mask?  they didn't explain the mask properly <br><br>fuckinng ehhh</br></br>  <br>LOTTA LOYALTY FOR A SUMMONED NPC</br>  <br>Didn't Ainz do a memory wipe of the two initial girls in the LN? I don't know jap so I don't know if they skipped that here.</br>    <br>I heard Christmas Eve mentioned at the very least.</br>  WE HAVE A MAP. I REPEAT, WE HAVE A MAP.  <br>scarington 2 spoopy</br>  SLAINE?  <br>He did it before returning them to the Village irc.</br>  <br>He said he got the mask from a christmas eve event.</br>  <br>The problem is the anime doesn't really make the world domination joke come across as a joke, like the manga and novels do. If I had only watched the anime, I would have thought he was being completely serious.</br>  <br>He didn't</br>    <br>Slane.</br>   mfw heart grasp   <br>Nah, he gives them a goblin summoning horn to protect the village with.</br>  <br>FINALLY A MAP</br>  <br>Just said it's a item that you auto get during christmas eve, didn't go into too much details.</br>  <br>Theocracy, I'm Ainz Ooal Gown</br>  I do not like that armor   NEXT EPISODE WITH PAPA BONES FUCKIN UP ANGELS   <br><br>But he does memory wipe them. He even mentions the exorbitant amounts of mana it takes for even the short time he erased.</br></br>  <br>  Curb-stomping ensues <br><br><br>The ending to this battle will be priceless.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is it just me or the Angels from the manga look a lot like the angels from DMC4?</br></br>  <br>Albedo's, I like it.</br>  <br>Superior KAYAAAAADOUUUU CCCCCCCEEEEEEBUUUUTSUUUU incoming</br>  Gazef a handsome  <br>nah, her old stuff was much better</br>  <br>Like the Angelos? Kinda. Although less bulky.</br>  <br>Wait, they didn't even get to the curbstomping yet? How many episodes does this have again?</br>  The lack of censors automatically makes this at least an 8/10.  Into the trash angels will go next episode.  Not bad, not bad. The death knight scene was fucking brutal. A head came off. And you saw it come off. Based Madhouse for not censoring shit.  <br>It will be a slam dunk</br>  <br>Same here. What's it about?</br>  <br>He used controlled amnesia so they won't have nightmares and just remember the good papa bones healer of lolis.</br>  Boobplate will never be as sexy as the manga version.  <br>I agree with this. In the LN people didn't knew that she was a woman. <br><br><br>Will we see Painkiller like in the manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>every four episodes should be the climax of a volume. Episode 4 this time being the climax of volume one.</br>  <br>They'll do the curbstomping up to Gazef leaving the village next ep.<br>12 or 13 episodes and no season 2 ever.<br>I have no idea how they plan to do the Bloody Valkyrie fight  Except if the OP is lying. Then again, the OP shows Cocytus soloing the lizards as well. </br></br></br>  <br>OR MAYBE HE'S WONDERING...<br>WHY WOULD SOMEBODY STAB A MAN, BEFORE TURNING HIM INTO UNDEAD.</br></br>  <br> GANKED </br>  <br>Still missing the kite shield.</br>  <br> 12 or 13 episodes and no season 2 ever. <br><br>The LN is fairly popular, and if it sells well... It's better ending having Momon become a hero after fighting with  Demiurge  for a second season than  Shalltear fight <br><br>A man can dream.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, ganked, that is the proper word for it</br>  <br>Unless they plan to do the rest of the series with book two I don't see why they won't do BV</br>    <br>They show 8 fingers in OP too<br>But not gonna get my hopes up</br></br>  <br>Episode 3: Battle of Carne Village<br>Episode 4: Ruler of Death<br>Episode 5: The Two Adventurers<br><br>Ainz vs Angels will happen in the next chapter. <br><br><br>I don't know why they had to spoil Shalltear's battle in the OP. Was a nice twist (although predictable) to see the absolutely loyal minion turn against her master.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fuck off Albedo, i am trying to find new bitches to bone.Stop trying to kill them all. </br>   My Little chair Can't be This Treasonous! : The Animes   <br>What do you know, some friends of mine didn't notice that the woman in red was actually a chair.</br>  <br> papa bones fighting Shalltear <br>HOLD<br>THE<br>FUCK<br>UP</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no it's not you pleb</br>  <br>Yep.

She dead.</br>  <br><br> It is a word commonly used in online video games, usualy used in an MMORPG.  <br/></br></br>  <br> She gets murdered super hard.  Don't worry, she gets better.  </br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>She dies, dude. Sorry.</br>  Where can I watch raws?  <br>And? They are talking about the in-setting MMO, which means ganked is in fact the appropriate term.</br>  <br>There is no common sense in your post.</br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>14468</wbr></br>  <br>This is an anime about an MMORPG. Are you retarded, onii-chan?</br>  So-bins armor is much better  <br>That's Valk Shalltear not Bedo.</br>  <br>Holy shit are you even watching the anime</br>  <br>I know who it is dingus.</br>  <br>So-bin never draws armor for Albedo<br>But boobsplate is sexy as fuck</br></br>  <br>Dude. The moment the clock turned 0:00 was when it stopped to be MMORPG and turned into an actual fantasy world.</br>  <br>Boobplate is never sexy. Get eyes.</br>  <br>no , actually<br>just came here to shitpost</br></br>  <br>that makes sense<br><br><br>also<br><br><br>SUBS FUCKING WHEN?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, so Shalltear is killed off for real?</br>  <br>35 minutes</br>  <br>No need to be shy anon, I know why you really came here.<br><br> Cute lizardwomen. </br></br></br>  <br>  Boobplate <br>  Not sexy as fuck <br>I think we have a serve case of shit taste here.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> But then they use money to bring her back. <br><br>Remember kids: Money is always the solution to all your problems. So, if you play a P2W game, remember to buy as much as you can in case that you get stuck in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I'd like to think of this episode's resurrection rod as a beacon of hope. </br></br>  <br>Yes anon. Killed for real. Like, super hard.</br>  <br>Thursday<br><br>also i like how everything ainz did in the guild was about his friends, the mausoleum, pandora's actor, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Momon is a fucking P2W scrub<br>Then again, using P2W in PvP was allowed. Yggdrasil AN UNBALANCED SHIT</br></br>  <br>FUTURE OF MMOS EVERYBODY</br>  <br>Nigga logged in on Christmas Eve because he was Mr. Lonely. Why do you think he wears that mask?</br>  <br>Have to admit, she's cute looking.</br>  <br>Yes, but the exact moment they are talking about is a flashback to the MMO.</br>  <br><br>So what actual skills do you need to be good at those kinds of mmo's? Aren't they just point, click, and face roll?</br></br>  <br>From that post I understood that they think Overlord is like Log Horizon or SAO, which is only for a couple of minutes.</br>  <br>Because he's a big guy?</br>  <br>Daily remember that Touch Me was a rich and old bastard with a wife and kids and had nothing better to do that spend his whole day inside the game, spending as much money as he can on it. <br><br><br>For a warrior you needed to actually fight, and for a magic caster or alchemist you needed to know your shits, there were no macros in the game with a spell list longer than D&amp;D and all its expansion put together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The entire conversation was about the scene where Touch Me saves Momonga from gankers. Although that one poster you replied to might have been an idiot, in which case carry on.</br>  <br>Who knows, Dive MMO don't exist yet. Good PvP requires good reactions and positioning, good PvE requires situational awareness and improv skills.</br>  <br>Yeah. Some people will always go and bitch about details instead of talking about the actual thing.</br>   There is a scary monster here! Master--! Master--! <br><br>The king is too cute</br></br>  <br>Yeah, only one weird censor out of nowhere.</br>  <br>So, was Touch Me a human character? It's weird since Ainz was a monster guild, but he certainly looks human.</br>  <br>dragon-kin. Supposedly he looks exactly like Sebas.</br>  <br>Dragonkin</br>   you will never fuck   Mare <br><br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br>Didn't Sebas looked like the real Touch me?</br>  Are there any other subs than HS funirips?  <br>Yes.</br>  HS is out, fellow non-moon speakers.  <br>No just go with 1080p and it'll be fine<br>only the first episode is fucked</br></br>  <br> rome total war </br>  <br>Every saturday</br>  Hey there. Dumping a medieval fantasy series, by the author of Tokyo Girls Destruction, Girl Friend, etc.). This got a brief English publication by CPM, but then they died.<br><br> Medieval adventure with a modern twist! Bright-eyed Prince Star left the comfortable life of his father's castle behind in order to search the lands for thrills and adventure. Of course, he should've been more careful for what he wished for, because the young Prince soon finds himself surrounded by a slew of unsavory characters, and perhaps a cute girl or two. </br></br>  <br>Cute art style.</br>        <br><br>It looks fun.</br></br>    I've heard good things about Ashita Dorobou, but I have not read it yet.                                                        <br>I've read Girl Friend and I really adore the art.

It's gonna get better.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lYX<wbr>vo3w4_YE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> EVERYTHING WAS PLANNED. <br>Yeah, now that I think about it.<br><br> Geji-nee in C;H <br> time warps in the infamous essay in C;H <br> S;G uses VR Tech <br> R;N uses cast members of C;H and S;G as well as technologies of it <br> C;C is a direct continuation and those fucking Rikishi-Seals have been in Shibuya since 2009 in the real world. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was really, really slow and responded to that without looking at anything else in the thread.<br>ARG stands for Alternate Reality Game, by the way.</br></br>  <br> that much spare cash <br>They'd both be coming out on Vita and/or PS3. You can get either of those second-hand for cheaper than $50 now. It'd probably cost more for both games than it would a console to play them on.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit wait, Geji-Nee in C;H? The same one from R;N? I vaguely remember reading something about Geji-Nee, but it didn't seem all that important.</br></br>  <br>Are you unable to read the picutere?<br>Silverfish-sis -&gt; Geji-nee.<br><br>It was all planned from the start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Silverfish-sis", as seen in that anon's screencap, is a mistranslation of "Geji-nee".</br>  <br>Onoe naked in fetal position is something I need more of.<br><br><br>I wonder, how long will it take for Chaos;Child to get as much attention as Steins;Gate?<br>Or will it be forgotten like Chaos;Head?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some threads ago someone hint about di-swords' form factor.<br>Could they assume another form that is not a sword?<br>As I know, without having played C;C, is a result of an accelerated biorythm, usually originated from really bad situations and a sword is a form to hurt</br></br></br>  <br><br> It was all planned from the start. <br><br>For what purpose? Or does C;C explain it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you think smelled like an ARG?</br>  <br>Well, Rimi's Di-Swords look like an angel's wings.<br><br>So there might be some variation but it will always form a sword.<br><br> For what purpose? <br> To make money for 5pb. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaos;Head anime is still loved by casuals who know no different, and was pretty big for a while after it aired. Hopefully, Noah's official release will revive its brief popularity, thus shining light on C;C.</br>  <br><br>I wasn't aware that they could have other forms in the first place. Is that a fact or just speculation?</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but it's speculation, every Di-Sword we have seen thus far was, well, a sword.<br><br>With the exception of Rimi's, whose sword look like an angel's wings, as described by Taku.<br><br>He describes each sword in detail, and you can guess a lot of the character by the description of the sword.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just speculation.<br>If one can violently change biorythm by other means than torture, mental stress, trauma.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I figured that much. If Di-Swords are direct projections of the subconscious, then they'd reflect the wielder. I just wasn't really sure how much I could pull from the sword designs. Take Taku's for example, it could mean anything from being 1 dimensional and focused to not having any embellishments. Designed for a single purpose maybe?</br></br>  <br>It's unimportant now. Just a misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Imagine a Gigalomaniac, who is sexually aroused to the max, about to fuck his girlfriend, unable to find a condom.<br>In his excited and aroused state of mind, he sees something at the edge of his vision.<br>He tries to grab it, and pulls out a  Dirac-Condom .</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what I should think about his straight and long Di-Sword.<br>I really have no idea what it could possibly mean, yet I'd like to think that it's the simplicity that makes it the best.<br>Maybe I can agree on your "single purpose" statement.</br></br></br>  Time travel exists, in that time dilation exists due to excess of gravity. Unfortunately you can't go back (from our current understanding of physics) but only forward from the present, you just age at a slower rate in the form of seconds to minutes.  <br> not   Dira-Condom </br>  <br><br>It's a sad limitation. What about light from stars and that sort of thing? Aren't they reaching us from the past?</br></br>  <br>Di-Sword is short for Dirac-Sword.<br>So, it should be  Di-Condom. </br></br>  <br><br>You're speaking of the Doppler effect. It's a good read, I suggest checking out the wiki page for if. It's technically not a form of time travel, just radial perspective as we move from the relative source.</br></br>  Anime onlyfag here. Hated Chaos;Head but loved Steins;Gate. Should I watch Robotic;Notes and wait for Chaos;Child anime?  <br>Chaos;Head anime was horseshit. Read the VN.</br>  <br>You should forget everything you know about Chaos;Head, then read the VN, hell read the VN either way.</br>  <br><br>You mean this?</br></br>  <br>Animeonlyfag reporting in.<br><br>R;N started off pretty good but it slipped up near the end. It won't be nearly as good as S;G but it might still be entertaining for you.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed here, Chaos;Head's VN was a wild ride.</br>    <br><br>I thought the Doppler effect was related to sound? Or is it for anything wave based?</br></br>  <br><br>Please for your own sake read the VN. The anime adaptation of C;H is awful. The R;N anime was mediocre. Not great, but it ties some things together for Sci;Adv later on in the future so it's good to know about.</br></br>  <br>I think he means the name of a book</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppl<wbr>er_effect<br><br>Pretty sure it's this.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> giant Upa <br>Mayuri must be behind this.</br></br>  I fucking swear S;G fans have got to be even more autistic than any long running shounen. Fact  <br>How?<br>Purely talking about on 4chan of course, almost all anime fans anywhere else are autismo maximi.</br></br>  <br>how mad do you have to be to post this</br>  <br>Welcome to the sciADV thread, shiposter-kun!<br>Now get the fuck out</br></br>   I'd get infected if it meant living in bliss forever, who wouldn't?     <br>Shit, meant to quote </br>  <br><br>At least this roleplaying feels nostalgic</br></br>  I don't even like Rimi, but that goofy-ass smile she has here melts my heart.  <br>He knew what an IBM 5100 was used for before really anyone else did I think<br>But other than that his predictions were wrong, unless, by telling us what was going to happen he prevented the events he said were going to take place.<br>Who knows, its probably all bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>I love Rimi, she is the best girl.</br>  <br>Yeah, definitely watch Robotics;Notes. Just don't expect anything as amazing as Steins;Gate, but in the end you should enjoy it anyway.</br>  <br>Would you fuck Rimi? If so, how? This is a very important question pertaining to how much you really love her.</br>  <br> fucking your waifu <br>This has to be a trick question.</br></br>  <br>Of course the only way to fuck Rimi is to   give her a good tender hand holding.  </br>  I watched this anime and never knew the john titor thing was real. But this makes this post even more mind boggling   <br>I don't seem to get it, nothing of it will happen, what do you mean by that?</br>  <br>I just googled John titor, its a real thing. What the hell; I never realized those were real things. Welp, fuck. I thought you were just sitting me</br>  <br>The whole idea behind SciADV is taking real unexplained events/theories/tales and weaving them into a story.</br>   timeline stuff   <br><br> Not knowing about John Titor <br> Not knowing about the IBN5100 <br> Not knowing about C/SERN <br> Not knowing about Lifters <br><br>What have you been doing with your life?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see you're from @channel.</br>     making signs for Japanese city level in a game <br> typing random shit into google translate <br> start using anime references <br> "Did you mean: El Psy Kongoo ? <br><br>THIS IS THE WILL OF STEINS GATE!</br></br></br></br></br>  As expected of the Committee.

All it depends on is how willing a reader is willing to accept magical delusion swords as a plot point.</br>  <br><br>No kidding. Limited to particles though.<br><br><br><br>Because the anime adaptation is shit. When people talk about C;H here, they're talking about the VN.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I meant the majority of discussions I've seen involving ranking have had C;H &gt; S;G. If you look at it from a self-insert point of view, it makes sense.</br></br>  <br>Anime was legitimate trash. Most adaptations almost never capture enough of the source material to live up to it, but the C;H anime takes that to another level. It removes entire scenes that are important to the plot, and then goes and adds anime original scenes that go against the tone of the entire VN. On top of that, the animation and art quality are fucking trash.<br><br>The VN is great, but most people on MAL only watch the anime and write off the entire series based on that.</br></br></br>    <br>It hurts to live</br>  <br><br>Dear god, I didn't think the animation could be that fucking hideous. This is a delusion right? I'm dreaming right?</br></br>  <br>There was no animation of C;H. It doesn't exist.

What if they were hoping to release Noah with PQube but PQube decided on a newer game like Robotics;Notes and put the Noah translation on the backburner for a future release?</br>  <br>What warp are you talking about?</br>  <br>Then I would know how to feel. Disappointed.</br>  <br>What if it was Zero?</br>  <br>Zero is getting localized eventually. I want to finally read C;H if it's possible.</br>  <br>Guess we'll just have to wait and see. I'd like to see Noah as well but you know how companies are, we're probably a minority.</br>  For something I read only once at least three years ago, I'm surprised at how much I can still remember of C;H. I guess it just left that strong an impression with gold like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ca4<wbr>FCo3QtS4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Still haven't read S;G though, trying to let my memories of the anime fade a bit more before starting so it's more fresh.</br></br>  <br>This, along with his most recent tweet about the Chaos World, most likely means that the localization will be for C;C, rather than C;H.<br><br>Which I'll be immensely disappointed about if true.</br></br></br>  <br>If anything's getting localized, Chaos;Child would be least likely. It's the newest but it requires understanding of a previous title to fully appreciate, it would be an unwise business decision.</br>  <br>Like releasing it Xbux only?

Still emits the same feeling, and makes me feel comfy as fuck. You are the minority in this situation anon.</br>  <br>I kind of agree. There seems to be more focus on comedy this season which I've never really found NNB to be that good at. The comfyness is still there though so I don't mind too much.</br>  Non Non Biyori?

I can't remember.   she feels your dick   <br>Yuru Yuri?<br>Yuyushiki?<br><br>It is either one of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>not to mention her voice is pure sex</br></br>  <br>How is that a fucking question? I'd even move in an tolerate Ren-chon's autistic manner.</br>  <br>I kinda feel like it was older, but I honestly can't remember any more. I know even the personality of the girl trying to do it was similar. <br><br>Now it's gonna bug me.</br></br></br>   That Komari test <br> mfw I only got half the questions right <br>Science sure is hard.</br></br>  <br>That's a cute nickname for her.</br>   did I go too far?<br/>   <br>This kind of wordplay trick that kids play on each other is a really old, commonly-used trope, anon.

She was always my favorite but I loved her in this one.  <br> She was always my favorite <br>Why? She seems like the least popular. Just curious.</br></br>  <br> But I'm sure she'll grow into a fine adult, and I'd probably marry her then. <br>She's still going to have that Osaka-like adorable eccentricity but she's also a genius. Adult Renge will be amazing.</br></br>  <br>Not the trick itself, I'm talking about fucking up specifically and pointing to the knee instead of the elbow when asking the other person. <br><br>Also I googled it and while Yuyushiki had a gag about it, it wasn't the one I was thinking of.<br><br>Maybe I'm just imagining things since I can't find other results. I want to say Azumanga but it's so popular someone would remember it. <br><br>I used to dislike her for most of the second season but then this happened. I can't dislike girls who love their brothers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Baka hentai siscon. </br>  <br><br>Natsumi is always the best girl.</br></br>  <br>I'm lazy as fuck too.</br>  <br>I like it a bunch more than S1. Maybe it's because I've kind of forgotten about the stuff that happened in S1, or because I love the comfy comedy a lot more or because Hotarun is way better in this season.</br>  <br>Do you think she could function at all in the city?<br><br>Anyway, I would love to live in the sticks with her and the other biyoris like that and live off of growing rice or tea.<br><br> Of course, I'm fully aware that real life is nothing like my animus </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ren-chon remembers Mỹ Lai <br> Her crew had to open fire on the 2nd Platoon just to stop the massacre <br> She could not believe that her own people would commit such atrocities <br> She was never the same after that. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is her mouth an anus?</br>  <br>delete this</br>  <br>You wouldn't a lemon.</br>  <br> on the front page </br>  What kind of a girl name is Kazuho anyway?

I thought this was supposed to be good. I thought after I made it through endless8 I would be rewarded with something interesting (but instead  i forgot my homework ). I'm at episode 23 and nothing has happened. The show is just an endless series a bunch of kids doing tedious tasks and pretending it is dramatic. They keep adding tiny little flickers of sci-fi and then just forget about it the next episode. Is this maybe an anime where the ending makes up for everything? please tell me it is.Is there an endgame?  <br>Haruhi was good for what it was, a SoL with a lot people doing fun things, and a interesting sci-fi twist. <br><br><br> S3 when <br><br><br>I agree the show was decent and fun and the movie was better, but  Haruhi is still my waifu and is best girl </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go watch Haruhi-chan or Churuya if you want.</br>  The movie nigger the movie. Everytime there's a thread like the OPs never watch the movie.

The series was ok.

I bet you can already sense these awkwards "えぇ？”. You should just block her and move on already, it's for the best.</br>  Anime when?  Shit doesn't get animated.  <br>Both of them become gods</br>  In retrospect, Shield was a gary stu of the worst kind.  This is beyond shit though.  <br>When we lost all hope.</br></blockquote>]
