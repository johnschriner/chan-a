[ So far, what show(s) are you most enjoying this season, /a/?  It's all shit. Literally watching nothing.  Shirayuki is probably the best 20 minutes of my week for now  <br>I could listen to Hayamin talk for the rest of my life.</br>  NNB, Gatchaman, and surprisingly enough Charlotte. <br><br>Durarara, Gangsta, Gakkou Gurashi, and Rokka no Yuusha aren't bad either.</br></br>  Gangsta<br>Overlord<br>G-g-g-g-g-gatchamaaaaan<br>MonMusume<br>SYMPHOGEAH<br><br>I missed the first two weeks because of family business interfering with my NEETdom so I've been meaning to make a thread asking what else is worth watching.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I've been meaning to make a thread asking what else is worth watching <br><br>Don't<br><br>Also watch Gakkou Gurashi</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Himouto<br>Gangsta<br>Dandelion<br>Wakaba Girl<br>Shimoneta<br>Gatchaman<br>Charlotte<br>Wakako-zake<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br><br>I'm dling Classroom Crisis but that name make me not want to watch it. And I'm anxiously waiting for Venus Project subs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gangsta<br>Ranpo Kidan<br>Monster Musume<br>Prison School<br><br>Waiting until other shows are a couple episodes in so I can lurk and see what else is worth picking up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shit mostly <br><br> havent seen any anime in a few months so im kind of lost. <br><br>Kekkon sensen and arslan, are the only 2 i have enjoyed . <br><br>seen the first few of umaru and gangsta.<br><br>Still looking for an anime this season that has enough moe mixed with adventure to truly enjoy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Still looking for an anime this season that has enough moe mixed with adventure to truly enjoy. <br>You might like Overlord; the premise is kind of generic (MC-kun falls asleep in VR vidya, game becomes real) but it's actually pretty damn fun in the vein of MMY and the MC is a skellington that actually looks a lot like Nito.</br></br>  <br> skellington <br>As in an actual bone skeleton or skeleton as in just somebody who has opinions that differ from those of /v/ and /pol/?<br><br>Fine either way, just curious.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>thats exactly why I'm repulsed by it . i simply detest any virtual reality/MMO Anime.<br><br>But i might give it a shot Simply because you are being a bro.<br><br>It's just that i already got my list lurking here.<br><br>I love these type of hidden recomendation threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I love these type of hidden recommendation threads <br><br>That actually wasn't the intention, more just a personal little survey. If I wanted some recommendations, I'd just look up some bloggers I liked. I actually have too big of a backlog to watch a lot of shows seasonally.<br><br>But yeah, I figured somebody might benefit from the rec thread aspect.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>An actual 2spoopy bone-on-bone skellington who's already the most powerful being in the game and has his own fortress of doom, guardians for said fortress and an artifact-tier weapon.<br><br><br>If you liked MMY then you'll probably like Overlord; it's pretty much MMY but with Dungeon Keeper instead of capitalism, ho!. But don't take my word for it; people have been translating the light novels and you can read them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gangsta<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br>Gate<br>Akagami<br>Classroom Crisis<br>Maybe I'll watch God Eater too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm enjoying:<br>Charlotte<br>Shirayuki<br>Gakkou Gurashi<br>Sore ga Seiyuu<br>Overlord<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa<br>Wakaba Girl<br>NNB<br><br>As well as a few second cours<br><br>I'm hoping these get good at some point because the premise seems fun:<br>Classroom Crisis<br>Shimoneta<br>Gangsta<br>Ranpo Kitan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but the name makes me not want to watch it <br><br>I've been enjoying it so far.

I tend to be really bad at actually discerning if I'm enjoying a show until I'm far enough removed from it.<br><br>Probably gonna wait out this next week or two and then make third episode cuts. Considering dropping Prison School until BDs since from what I've seen it's heavily censored. Lack of tits and ass and all isn't a deal-breaker, but the screencaps seemed really obnoxious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Non Non Biyori Repeat<br>Working!!!<br>Okusama ga Seito Kaichou!<br>Joukamachi no Dandelion<br>Wakaba*Girl<br>Charlotte<br>Shimoneta<br>Wakako-zake<br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa<br>Sore ga Seiyuu!<br>Himouto!

I like to marathon true stuff or atleast finish it in a week or so.</br></br>  <br>Classroom Crisis should surely get better now that they've shoved all the information they possibly could into episode 2. Now the plot should actually start.</br>  <br><br> I'm trying really hard to like Classroom Crisis since I love the premise, but it's making it difficult with how sloppy the execution has been so far. <br><br>Dropped after episode 1. It was a trainwreck, and If they can't even get the most important episode (in terms of sales) right then it's gonna be a trainwreck of a series.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't enjoy bunny slut and skeletal squirrel </br>  <br>Do you not watch much anime? There are plenty of series with meh first episodes.

I'll go watch Working tomorrow!<br><br>(At least it wasn't a sad Chiyo or I'd be unable to sleep.)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I'll go watch Working tomorrow! <br><br>I'm going to kind of sort of half-spoil something for you right now, but trust me, it's really for the best. Yes, Inami, the redhead, eventually improves. Don't let her ruin the show for you. Poplar and Yamada are miracles of the universe. It's one of the better, more well-executed comedy/SoLs; if you can tolerate Inami I'm sure you'll like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the warning, stuff like that isn't really a spoiler IMO, and knowing the people who like it have issues with an early episode tends to gain a show an extra few episodes of patience.<br><br>Is Poplar voiced by Koma-chan-senpai?

Until these two faggots showed up.  Based Okada  Hey now Nagai has worked on great mecha shows like Idolmaster Xenogl...<br><br>HA HA HA HA HA HA</br></br>  Delusional genfags on suicide watch  YOU WERE WARNED VIA STAFF LEAK, BUT NOBODY BELIEVED IT. WELL WHO'S LAUGHING NOW.<br><br>" Not me </br></br>  Dropped  Picked up.    Man how quick do people think the fanart machine is going to start going with this?  <br>Not really that well. It's a sausage fest, but character designs isn't exactly what Fujos want. and also manlet army.</br>  PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Idd<wbr>xplDVGw8</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Idd<wbr>xplDVGw8</wbr>  [ ]  <br> manlet army. <br><br>Levi is a manlet too just to let you know.</br></br></br>  Confirmed higher sales than g-rekto and age.    <br> Okada <br><br>Wure, why not.</br></br></br>  <br>Xeno was great.</br>   everyone assumes Gen will write new gundam <br> instead it's the only person who could possibly fuck it up worse </br>  They should let Aoki Ei direct gundam.  Okada is making a gundam?<br><br>And there are shotas involved. Have they been warned about Okada?</br></br>  <br> AGE <br><br>Not much of a feat.</br></br></br>  Polygon time?   there are people posting on this board, right now, that will defend this after it's shittier than people already expect   <br>So basically they are hashing Valvrave + MS 08th + Gundam X + 00. Wonderful.<br><br>Just bring back Seed. Jesus said he's be back right?</br></br></br>  <br>This is what we get for not buying more G-Reco BDs. I miss Tomino already ;_;</br>  <br>I should have supported Try more instead of shitposting that it's not as good as GBF. REGRET</br>  <br>From the PV, it doesn't look bad. The Mobile Suit designs are cool (except maybe the piston waists), the characters look look alright and the setting doesn't seem too out of the ordinary.<br><br>It's all left up to Nagai and Okada. Which sure, no one has faith in them, but we can cross our fingers and hope.</br></br></br>  <br>You know I wouldn't have cared, but since they showed us the PV before I got all hyped because it looks and feels like a good Gundam series. Even the main Gundam looks great. But then they announce these two and I know they're going to throw all that potential down the drain. I hope I'm wrong though.</br>  <br><br>M3 was great.</br></br>  <br> M3 was great </br>  <br>Sure thing.</br>  I'll summarize the story synopsis:<br> It's 300 years after the last great war <br> old governments destroyed, new governing parties on earth <br> there is a colony on Mars and a girl named Cordelia Aina Vaughnstein (?) wants to have it self governed <br> manlet is part of a civilian security company (CGS) and gets tasked to escort the girl <br> CGS gets attacked by Galhorn(?) whose purpose is to prevent the revolt <br> CGS uses the iron-blooded orphans as decoys to escape <br> the leader Orga gets pissed at the company and decides on a coup d'etat <br> manlet is tasked with driving away Galhorn and takes the mobile suit serving as CGS' power core (It's the Gundam) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please.</br>  <br>It wasn't, but I like Okada's general style.</br>  <br>Better than Taniguchi+Butcher tbh</br>  <br>you and maybe 5 other people think that</br>  <br>Olga is the leader of the kid's, not the company. I'm tired, there's probably more mistakes.</br>   Okada   <br><br>Gundam Cycled</br></br>  <br> Confirmed higher sales than g-rekto and age. <br> M3 <br> WIXOSS <br> Nagi </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was entertained by the series, I guess I like it too.</br>  <br>Yeah, nope. I'd rather take Butcher's 'fuck seigi no mikata' drama over Okada's drama. Since it's Gundam, you can be confirmed that Butcher will at least chuck in some kool operator shit.</br>  <br>I don't.<br>Tomino and G-Reco can fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Except you're dead wrong.<br><br>This is Nagai + Okada. Therefore it will sell. Plus the bishonens getting all hot blooded for fujobucks.</br></br></br>  <br> anohana <br> toradora </br></br>  <br> Okada career is finally dying <br> now she gets the mega job </br></br>  <br><br>We need fujobucks to fund the next Tomino Gundam.</br></br>  <br>I feel like Okada can do a beginning well. There's always interesting setups. After that, it's a complete mess. There's often too many things trying to be resolved at once and they're usually done improperly or not at all.<br><br>Perhaps it's due to others on the staff or other constraints but it always seems to go this way from the anime she's worked on, at least the ones I've seen.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There are people that will have also shitposted it to death long before it even airs so it all balances out.</br></br>   We'll never see Tomino, Okada,and Kawamori working on the same project   <br><br> This is Nagai + Okada. Therefore it will sell </br></br>  <br> What is Toradora? <br> What is AnoHana? </br></br>   inb4 one episode worth of battles <br> the rest is just high school girl drama <br><br>Yes. YES!</br></br></br>  <br>Anohana is her only original to break 10k. But who knows how this would sell.</br>  <br> What is Toradora? <br>Sold less than G-Reco retard. Also a shitty drama is different from mecha</br></br>  I for one look forward to Okada saving anime.  <br>It's not just the height. They're too 00s for fujos. Not pretty enough.</br>  <br>It's already got a boost with the Gundam brand name attached.</br>  <br><br> M3 <br> Xenoglossia <br><br>You've already lost</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the fucking point idiot. I'm talking about it selling and Toradora sold 10.3k which is more than G-Reco. Do your research.</br>  After this Okada will be a household name and the Wixoss movie will sell millions  <br> angry manlet MC <br><br>Reminds me of Shingeki.<br><br>In a bad way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Xenoglossia was Nagai<br><br>M3 was Okada<br><br>This is Nagai + Okada. All the anime they've done together have made over 10k.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is actually the best thing to happen in my life.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br> I'm talking about it selling and Toradora sold 10.3k <br>Wrong again dumbfuck</br></br>  <br>Geez that's guy-heavy</br>  To be fair the new Gundam setting feels a bit like Mad Max.   Director: Nagai Tatsuyuki <br> Series Composition: Okada Mari <br> Character Design: Chiba Michinori <br> Music: Yokoyama Masaru </br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind the character designs, except maybe the silver haired guy in the back. The characters that were shown outside of this crew seemed decent enough too. The Mobile Suit designs all seem slick as well.

You don't even need extra edge to Gundam shows. Usually, a huge number of characters die off anyway</br>  <br>Truth hurts huh?</br>   Nagai and Okada have a new movie soon   Is there anything on the site if you're set to JST, like character info or anything? Is that where people got the name of the Gundam?  <br>Are those some kind of implants poking out through his spine?</br>  <br><br>Because Gundam has been getting shitposted to death since the days of Gundam Seed Destiny.

Make it happen Okada!  <br> But G-reco was suppose to be MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA </br>  What are your thoughts on the revealed design of the Gundam Barbatos? As well as the one grunt revealed so far? Now we know the waist pistons are meant to be like that.<br><br>If it does end up getting redesigned throughout the series, that would be cool. Personally, I think it looks very good besides that one detail. It's a unique design. A Core Fighter would have been acceptable, if not just armor there.</br></br>  <br> G-reco was suppose to be MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA </br>  <br> reminding me of Katejina <br>I'm suddenly seeing red and shaking in rage</br></br>  <br>Fucking saved.</br>  Fuck this. Where is G Reco season 2  <br>I will miss the G-Reco hatedom. Their constant stupidity and their lost in touch on reality was a sight to see..</br>  <br>Too cresty.</br>  <br>At least with Okada we have a guaranteed's backstory and if she wills it good characterization.</br>  <br>Why did Menma want the kids to build a giant rocket again?</br>  If it is based on Tekketsu Kinnotai, the "Iron and Blood Corps" then it would be edge and dark underaged animefags surely will love it  <br>Both look pretty cool, I guess.<br><br>What really gets me excited is the difference between the two traditional-style MS that have been revealed and those Metal Gear-esque grunts.<br>There's potential for some pretty neat fight scenes there.</br></br></br></br>  <br> G-reco was suppose to be MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA </br>  <br>I like Okada because she'll make sure the cast suffers, but there probably won't be many deaths, because okada hates killing her characters permanently for some reason.<br><br><br>I wonder what that grunt suit has in terms of thrusters. Will thrusters pop out of those heel flaps like the God Gundam?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do your research retard.<br><br>The only anime they've done together are:<br><br>Toradora - sold 10.3k and 21k BD-Box<br><br>AnoHana - sold 34k, made 1 billion yen at box office, movie sold 20k on BD<br><br>Gundam - Probably will sell over 10k</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's potential for some pretty neat fight scenes there. <br>Watch the Railgun S filler and kill your hope before its too late.</br></br>  <br>  I can't fucking wait to see Okada's Katejina Loos <br><br>You're shitting me, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Because they wanted Jinta's mom to be happy, hence they decided to build a rocket from looking at a festival poster.</br>  <br>It will be so shitty I can't wait to see everyone's reaction.</br>  <br>I'm liking the design, the pauldrons, lance and shield gives it a cool knightly look</br>     The Aquarian EVOL of Gundam with the Aldnoah Zero setting     <br> not this psycho </br>  <br>Bro every Sunrise mecha is a rehash of original Gundam. When will you realize this?</br>  <br> What are your thoughts on the revealed design of the Gundam Barbatos? <br><br>It's literally a cheap knockoff of an FSS Mortar Headd. Even the Nips are saying as much on Twitter. Unlike a Mortar Headd though, the Gundam isn't elegant at all.</br></br></br>    <br>You can continue to be in denial I suppose. I just hope you don't kill yourself when vol 1 comes out and sells over 10k.</br>  <br>Is the pilot seat in the head of the Gundam? I can't unsee it as being right above the V-fin.<br><br><br>Really digging the lance. Melee weapons like that and the Gundam Hammer are always nice to see.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Even the Nips are saying as much on Twitter. <br>Cool bullshit bro. Nobody gives a shit about FSS</br></br>  OK OK hold on a fucking second, somebody answer me this: I have no idea who Okada is, but I know that he worked on 00, and I thought it was a commercial success?<br><br>Why are some anons here calling it a flop?<br><br>No I'm not defending it. Just genuiely confused.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If it is based on Tekketsu Kinnotai, the "Iron and Blood Corps" then it would be edge and dark underaged animefags surely will love it <br><br>Please elaborate on that work</br></br></br>  <br> But G-reco was suppose to be MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA <br>This is your brain on drugs</br></br>  <br> I'm saying this based on absolutely nothing.  <br><br>Okay</br></br></br>  <br>Okada like Mari Okada.<br><br>A woman.<br><br>A woman who can't write for shit because she inserts cheap unbelievable drama into everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By Okada they mean Mari Okada, who specializes in drama, suffering, and occasional shotabutts.</br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/enc<wbr>yclopedia/people.php?id=39695<br><br>Scroll down and see if you recognize any of the anime she has worked on.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> Okada <br> he <br> worked on 00 </br></br></br>  <br>The white plate on the chest looks too much like a pilot hatch for me to agree with you.</br>  <br>I'm saying this based on the Gundam brand name and the Nagai+Okada brand name. You're literally retarded and know nothing about sales trends if you think they won't factor into the BD sales somehow.</br>  <br> Nobody gives a shit about FSS <br><br>Except Japan, where opinions actually matter, especially compared to filthy gaijins who haven't watched any Gundam that wasn't Wing or BF.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh oh OK, sorry, OP's pic related got me confused.<br>Yeah, I get the hate now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping that's the case. On that note, the crests all over the Gundam take away from the design. The ones on the shoulders would be fine if not for the ones also on the knees and chest. Makes it look busier than it needs to be.</br>  <br> I'm saying this based on the Gundam brand name <br>Yep because AGE was a success right?<br><br> and the Nagai+Okada brand name <br><br>There is no name brand, they made two successful anime that were 3 years apart by chance the former was based a popular source of material already. Both aren't ad prolific or popular anymore since you keep ignoring their recent flops.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What? It's what I was told by the fans when I said I couldn't understand shit and didn't like it, along with the usual "you're too retarded, go watch a/z like the kiddy you are"</br></br>   Nagai <br><br> inb4 Saten makes a cameo and beats up everyone with a baseballbat </br></br>  <br> Except Japan <br>That;s why Gothicamade was a huge success and why everyone is anticipating the new FSS volume right?</br></br>  <br>No need to make up bullshit.</br>  <br>Those power-symbol looking things are going to be part of some kind of Trans-Am/Moonlight Butterfly/NTD/etc. super system that gets unlocked by something they find partway through the show.<br><br>Calling it right now.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Nagai <br> &gt;inb4 Saten makes a cameo and beats up everyone with a baseballbat <br><br>Cordelia, the one the guys are escorting, could be a badass</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is /a/ ready for Gundam EVOL?</br>  <br> their recent flops. <br><br>you forgot to add "individual" I can guarantee you their new movie "Heart of the Anthem" will sell well as well as this Gundam.<br><br>AGE had good preorders just like G-Reco but most people cancelled them when the show started airing. Before the show starts airing it will get a lot of preorders because it's Gundam. Look at G-Reco, it got 10k before airing. After airing it went down. It's possible with this one but I doubt it based on the staff. They're clearly aiming for this one to sell.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the gundam seems to be looting a baseball bat in its future, so...</br>  <br> AGE had good preorders </br>  <br> everyone is anticipating the new FSS volume right? <br><br>Yes. <br><br>https://twitter.com/search?q=%E6%B0<wbr>%B8%E9%87%8E%20%E8%AD%B7&amp;src=typd&amp;v<wbr>ertical=default&amp;f=tweets<br><br> Gothicamade was a huge success <br><br>Wait, you actually think Gothicmade was made for a profit?

It doesn't appear to have them in the final scene where the MC walks away from the Gundam, though that may just be due to the angle or lack of necessity of drawing them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> With no BD release in sight <br>Stop reminding me.</br></br>   Nagai like Tatsuyuki Nagai <br> not Go Nagai </br>  <br>They should have forced studio 8 to work with more Mai Hime since LoveLive is done for now<br><br>Mai Hime should become the Gundam for female mary sue MC's</br></br></br>  <br>Fascinating</br>  <br> you forgot to add "individual" I can guarantee you their new movie "Heart of the Anthem" will sell well as well as this Gundam. <br>Yeah you keep being stupid<br><br> AGE had good preorders just like G-Reco but most people cancelled them when the show started airing. <br><br>Nope AGE was out of the top 1000 before it even aired. G-Reco had already aired in theaters hence the high volume turnout but Amazon fucked up the first volume number.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Does Studio 8 have anything planned?</br></br>  <br>True,Mai HiME sold well with merchandise and we still haven't got a 3rd Mai-series since 2008.</br>  <br> https://twitter.com/search?q=%E6%B<wbr>0%B8%E9%87%8E%20%E8%AD%B7&amp;src=typd&amp;<wbr>vertical=default&amp;f=tweets</wbr></wbr> <br>You just literally made a fucking search without reading any of teh comments dumbass<br><br> Wait, you actually think Gothicmade was made for a profit? You do know literally only 4 people worked on it in what was an attic right? With no BD release in sight? <br><br>The movie was released in theaters and flopped. You're the same stupid Nagano fag from /m/ thinking anyone gives a shit about that hack.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Which Gundam do you think Mari Okada liked the most?  <br>Just don't kill yourself when both are a success.</br>  <br>well it's a toss up on Horizon,Mai-HiME or another original Sunrise series.</br>  <br>SEED/Destiny.</br>   “the cast will feature a diverse cast of characters, such as girls who fall in love with the main character”     <br>G-Reco for the incest potential</br>  Am I the only one that liked G-Reco?<br><br>Also, what timeline is Iron Blooded Orphans?</br></br>  <br>New AU</br>  <br>Looking at the setting she probably never watched a single Gundam episode.</br>  <br>Victory Gundam.</br>  <br>I liked it.<br>Currently unknown I think, but I'd say AU</br></br>  <br>I liked G-Reco. One of the most beautiful TV anime I've gotten to see while airing. The plot could have used about 3 fewer factions, but it was good.</br>  <br>Kamen Rider Ryuki was done by a woman who never made Kamen Rider before and it turned out to be amazing. Why Okada can't do something similar? <br> inb4 she is a hack </br></br>  <br> &gt;“the cast will feature a diverse cast of characters, such as girls who fall in love with the main character” <br><br>Where did you get that?</br></br></br>  <br> Am I the only one that liked G-Reco? <br>Lots of people did including Urobuchi. The haters are just more vocal and retarded</br></br>  <br> Am I the only one that liked G-Reco? <br>Nope, I loved it.</br></br>  <br>What about that setting seems atypical of a Gundam series? They're all over the place in each of the series.</br>  <br>I liked it, but it really did feel like they crammed 50 episodes into 26, especially after they got into space.</br>  <br>No, you aren't the only retard.</br>  <br><br> “the cast will feature a diverse cast of characters, such as girls who fall in love with the main character” <br><br>It wouldn't be an Okada show without a love do-decagon</br></br></br></br>  <br>A dude from the staff during the event.</br>  <br>Why is so hard start to watch it?</br>  <br>Tons of flaws aside, I like it.</br>  <br> You just literally made a fucking search without reading any of teh comments dumbass <br><br>Neither did you apparently, since they were mostly retweets from the Amazon webpage for volume 13. The rest of the comments were about how the new Gundam designs is a Nagano copycat. <br><br> The movie was released in theaters and flopped.  <br><br>Sauce? You know movies recoup their costs with BD releases right? And Gothicmade, despite being out for 3 years, still doesn't have one. Also, I'm pretty damn sure it made some profit considering it was made with no more cash than that one movie Shinkai made by himself. That is, literally fucking nothing.<br><br> You're the same stupid Nagano fag from /m/ thinking anyone gives a shit about that hack. <br><br>Yeah, because the FSS threads are all just me samefagging and tricking the post counter. And all the recent comments posted about the Gundam design on /m/ looking like Nagano are all mine. I definitely put in that kind of effort just to fuck with you, anon.<br><br>Stay delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A dude from the staff during the event. <br><br>I know Okada can pull something a lot better than making the girls just mere love interests</br></br></br>  <br> Gundam: <br>Kids aren't really soldiers but they do fight because they want to survive<br> Okada Gundam: <br>There is a special unit especially for kids<br><br> Gundam: <br>Zeon are the ones looking like royals <br> Okada Gundam: <br>Feds are the royals and the kids are martians</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now I'm imagining that gif of the child having its head shot off with a laser beam, but with the love interest.</br>  <br>CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.</br>  <br>Have you not seen any Gundam series produced after 1979?<br><br>Both of those things have been done to death. If anything, she's not being original enough.</br></br></br>  I wish they would make a Gundam with a decent budget and stray away from the rounded corners cartoon style they have going - I get that it's a throwback, but the sharper style is more modern and personally I think it looks better.<br><br>Also getting rid of the MC who always looks/is 11 years old - seriously look at this shit, everyone else looks halfway decent (Except for chubbs, but he's probabaly a comedic character anyway) and then you have an 11 year old kid who is wearing a jacket that is wider than he is tall and looks like he's going to have an asperger's attack any second. Do they have to shoehorn the extremely young MC into every fucking show?<br><br>inb4 it's for toys/gunpla etc. - Do you really think kids are the main people buying gundam kits nowadays?<br><br>A new Gundam comes out every so often and it always ends up being a shitty cash grab, I wish time and budget would go into a decent show one of these days; there really hasn't been a good Gundam show since 00.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Gundam: <br> Kids aren't really soldiers but they do fight because they want to survive <br>sounds like m3</br></br></br>  <br>if it is dark gundam, they won't life for too long</br>  <br>Because you're fucking stupid. Luckily this new Gundam series will be dumb enough for you.</br>  <br>I liked it</br>  <br> there really hasn't been a good Gundam show since 00. <br>00 wasn't good. It was just a lot of newfags first Gundam</br></br>  <br>  Okada working on 00 <br>  Okada a he <br><br>Looks like someone didn't do his research...</br></br></br></br>   g-reco   <br> if it is dark gundam, they won't life for too long <br><br>I seriously doubt Mari Okada would waste female characters like that<br><br>Making suffer, maybe</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This kills the Gundam.</br>  <br>I think they are a good diverse characters, are you a faggot complaning about character designs?</br>  <br> hurr <br><br>So you're literally a fucking liar who can't speak moon.<br><br> durr <br><br>So you're literally a retard who doesn't know what he's talking about.<br><br><br> Yeah, because the FSS threads are all just me samefagging and tricking the post counter.

Too stupid to follow a mecha anime?</br>  <br>The lance looks great but almost everything about this Gundam seems unwieldy. The incomplete/empty torso, the end heavy lance, the huge shoulders. If it could support it's own weight, football tackles could be a viable method of attack.</br>  <br> So you're literally a fucking liar who can't speak moon. <br><br>I don't need to speak moon to see a book cover with an Amazon link on it over and over again on the same page.<br><br> So you're literally a retard who doesn't know what he's talking about. <br><br>Great script anon, it's definitely helping you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Projecting your insecurities? Keep eating shit.</br>  <br>Xeno was ok, not great.<br><br>And he had Jukki Hanada not fucking Okada.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how they're going to get the gunpla kits to stand up on their own.</br>  <br>I agree with you about the character designs. I really dislike this style. It just feels really half-assed and all everyone looks like either a gimmick. Tough guy. Fat guy. Expert guy. Friendly guy. No one builds out the world or feel of the show at all.</br>  <br>So, who is Char/Mask-kun in this one?</br>  <br> You will never have a cute anime-scriptwriter wife </br>  <br> Gen <br> Doing anything right <br>He is a hack.

Araki doesn't have a problem with breaking continuity if it results in something cool, like Jotaro putting magnets on DIO despite the fact he didn't know he could move in frozen time when he first fights DIO, or when it makes no sense how DIO stole Jonathons body, got into the coffin, and then Erina climbed got in. There's a lot inconsistancy. But then, then manga has been going on for over 20 years now, so if Araki followed *every* rule and detail to the letter, it would just hinder him. Also, Araki has aquired a sameface problem.</br></br>  <br>they get extended dumbass, he's a vampire he can pull it off.</br>  <br>they don't bloody widen</br>  <br>aw shit yeah</br>  <br>vampire power, dude.

She just kidnapped a kid because she had always wanted that to happen to her. Didn't even demand ransom and got 7 years. Then Plankton murders you and steals your body. Being Etra is suffering.</br></br>  <br><br>Literally the opposite of what that post is saying.</br></br>  <br>No, Dio sucks blood FROM your capillaries with his fingers. <br><br>And given that an erection is like 99% blood, that's an opportunity for him to feed really well.</br></br></br>    <br>Pretty sure cutting your hair doesn't weaken your ability to use the Ripple.</br>  <br>DIO would never suck a dick.</br>  <br>In which sense?</br>  Excited to finally start part 7. <br> All these cowboys <br> none will take the place of Hol Horse in my heart </br></br>  <br>you should be hype as fucking hell but leave here know unless you wanna get spoiled</br>  <br> Liking Job Horse </br>    <br>So much underaged ass.</br>  <br><br> you will never smoke sigars and watch some fanservice loli anime with Forever <br>Why fucking live.</br></br></br>  <br>the only thing i can really think of is sometimes he likes to tell and not show<br>it's never much bothered me but other people have made me realize it</br></br>    <br>You say that like it's a problem.</br>  <br>what was the point of her anyway?</br>  <br> wanting to watch sick shit with a fat smelly orangutan who will probably start licking his monkey dick halfway through <br>Bleh.<br>Still, would probably be more entertaining than doing anything with Jotaro.</br></br></br>  <br>Higher-ups wanted Araki to add a younger kid character to the story so young readers would identify with someone or something.<br>He did, but managed to get rid of her before she got any real importance.</br></br>  <br>Dunno, what was the point of 90% of the characters in SC?

And parts 7/8 take place in their own set of universes?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, pretty much.</br>    <br>You're not trying hard enough. Even hardcore fans can admit there are big flaws in Araki's writing.</br>  <br>He obviously hasn't read any manga</br>  What's your villain rankings?<br><br>6&gt;4&gt;7&gt;5&gt;3&gt;1&gt;2<br><br> Yeah many people gonna kill me and yell "shit taste" at me because I put Diavolo better than Dio and Kars, why? , because he only appears like 10 (?) chapters doesn't mean he is shit, look , I always hated generic shit, example : protagonist winning and happy end.<br>Jonathan dead was the reason why I got into JoJo. Now what happen is that almost all villans in the series have they "followers" (Part 1 Vampires created by Dio, Part 2 maybe a exception but still there Santana,Whammu and AC/DC, Part 3, DIO's cock suckers, Part 4, People who got penetrated by the arrow and helped Kira and his Father, Part 6, Pucci followers and Dio sons, Part 7, People who worked for the president (Part 7 is my favorite part so this is a exception because how Hot Pants and Diego attacked Valentine when they din't teamed Johnny and Gyro)), now the topic is that yes, the mafia is attacking the protagonist gang, but it isn't to defend Diavolo, It's to know who he is, Other strong point is the Metallica fight, It amazed me, the fact that how the fight developed and that it was the villain fighting someone that wasn't the protagonist (i don't know if im explaining well), also the Doppio and Diavolo is a cool touch, Diavolo taking over Doppio body noticing the change in the eyes (Diavolo Eyes are shattered), Diavolo may look like a dumbass but when he is in battle he takes shit seriusly.</br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Dio &gt; Valentine &gt; Kira &gt; Pucci &gt; Diavolo &gt; Kars<br><br> Who doesn't have a Dio boner? </br></br></br>  <br>Dio Brando or DIO?</br>  <br>Does it really matter?

Shit's mildly confusing.  <br>You can skip the first 2 parts if you want but most don't since they're pretty great</br>  <br>which is better - anime or manga? and isn't there like a remake of the anime or something?</br>  <br>Read all of the manga parts in order then watch the anime</br>  <br>Watch JoJo 2012 then Stardust then read the manga</br>  <br>You can read Part 2 for the art only, i really liked it.</br>  <br>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) (anime)<br>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3 Stardust Crusaders (manga)<br>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3 Stardust Crusaders (manga)<br>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4 Diamond is Unbreakble (manga)<br>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 5 Vento Aureo (manga)<br>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6 Stone Ocean (manga)<br>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 7 Steel Ball Run (manga)<br>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 8 Jojolion (manga)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think watching the anime then rereading the manga or continuing on with the manga is a better option. The animation itself may not be great, but there are great colors and still panels. If you favor TV over using your own imagination to a certain extent, watch the anime.</br></br>  <br>That seems like a pretty comprehensive list to follow, thanks anon.<br><br><br>I heard the anime was pretty good - the 2012 one, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Anime is much better if you've read the manga previously, especially since the manga does every single fight better</br>  It's work as a excuse to shitpost that the thread is dying?  <br>what?</br>  Where can I download part 4, and are there any color scans?    <br> What is the pastebin </br>  <br>The Mangaka, Rohan Kishibe dies.<br>Rohan dies.<br>Jotaro dies<br>Jotaro has a daughter<br>She dies</br></br></br></br></br>  How is Mista completely fine seemingly a few hours after the train fight? He shot himself in the collar bone and got a more severe looking Avdol treatment. He could at least look like he's in pain or something.  <br> Reading it for a second time again fagboi :^) </br>  <br> second time again </br>  <br>Giorno</br>  There was a similar discussion sometime last week, but any misconceptions that you guys had before reading JoJo's?<br> Thought that Part 5 was a spinoff manga <br> Thought that   the alternate Diego was Dio pulled in due to alternate universe shenanigans. </br></br>  All right, so I just finished Part 6.<br><br>How does Emporio activate Weather Report when it's explicitly stated multiple times in the same part that each person can only have one ability at a time? Am I missing something, or is it Araki being Araki again?</br></br>  <br>part 5 might as well be spinoff</br>  <br>I'm still not understanding. I thought Giorno's ability doesn't actually heal, it just makes you think you're feeling better right?</br>  JUST  <br>Pretty sure it actively heals wounds</br>  <br>read the manga</br>  <br>I thought it was the exact opposite. It heals, but because of the way it works, it hurts like hell.</br>  <br>Stand discs bypass this rule.</br>  <br>if you are saying why Emporio have 2 stands it because he doesnt hve 2, pucci retrieved burning down the house and that lead the patch to emporio putting the weather report disc</br>  <br>it replaces all lost tissue, blood, and such<br>you are healed but it hurts like a bitch</br></br>  <br>It's worse with Sticky Fingers since it's not healing in the traditional way like with Gold Experience or Crazy Diamond.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks, I must have missed that.</br></br></br>  <br>it depends, I can't really be sure though since I haven't and can't experience both sides. I like being surprised when i watch things, knowing what's going to happen kind of ruins the experience (only a little though!) <br>I'm someone who watched Part 1, 2, and 3 up to partway through the D'arby the gamer fight, but couldn't wait for the show so finished part 3 with the manga, and i still loved Dio's fight. I'm not sure haha I'd say since the anime is pretty good and the manga is good pick the form you like best</br></br>  <br>No they don't. They even specifically said that they don't.<br><br><br>When did that happen? Pucci didn't even have the ability to take discs any more, he had a completely different stand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah but he could still take   DICKS HAHAHA  </br>    fresh off of /v/  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br> has the chance to make a space reference <br> doesn't use Cars <br><br>You read the fucking manga</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because Araki didn't want Pucci to win.</br>  <br>I thought that just replacing the tissue was Crazy Diamond's thing, while Gold Experience either accelerated the natural healing process or did its whole "transmute nonliving matter into living matter" schtick.</br>  <br> Cars is in the anime </br>  <br>I thought for some reason it wasn't emporio controlling it. It just went mad in the death of it's master and punched pucci dick so hard the universe reset again</br>  Guys, Rock Lobster is gonna be the Ed for Part 6  <br> Thinks a boring Cars reference is better than Jotaro's sides being at Kennedy Space Center <br>Why don't you  read the manga? </br></br>  <br> thinking either of us are serious <br> both of us are serious <br> johnny dies ;) </br></br></br>  <br> the reference doesn't make sense <br>the kennedy space center isn't in space hurr<br><br>fuck i hate arguing over stupid shit no one wins except maybe you, but still fuck you</br></br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't controlling it, but it manifested after the disc was pushed into his head.</br>  <br>still one of the most satisfying moments in the manga, Pucci was really pissing me off</br>  <br>No, Kars was</br>  All JoJo endings<br><br>Part 4- Killer Queen<br>Part 5- Everybody wants to rule the world<br>Part 6- Hybrid moments<br>Part 7- house of the rising sun<br>Part 8- Get back</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>This is my fetish. I'm re-watching Always Sunny as I browse</br></br></br>  <br>part 7 isn't even a jojo part....</br>  <br>read the manga, then kill yourself</br>  What would Jonathan and Erina's life have been like if he lived?  <br>crazy diamond restores what you've lost painlessly out of nothing<br>giorno has to have something to turn into the lost tissue</br></br>  <br>Part 8- We're no strangers to love<br><br>On that thought, what would a stand of that name do? make someone fall in love with you, and something about strict rules they must follow or what? they must follow rules or fall mindlessly in love with you and the user can control you</br></br></br>  <br> implying you've read the manga <br><br>maybe you're just a super retard<br><br><br>gentlemanly stuff and lotsa kids</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well originally he would have been generating the Ripple along the length of his hair using a technique similar to Bruford. I'm not really sure he was aware of the other techniques for generating it at the time, and he just subconsciously slipped into Ripple Breathing.</br>  <br> the kennedy space center isn't in space hurr <br>Read the manga.</br></br>  <br> your humor sucks <br>I have read the manga,  Diego lives </br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  Which is harder to understand, King Crimson's abilities or magnets?  Lewd<br><br>Anyone else following this?</br></br>  <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Holy shit, that was bad. Thanks for the webm, nigga. At least I know now what I should avoid.</br>  <br>The MC is pretty decent but the layout for most of the episode was typical cliche generic shit. I'm still giving it 2 more episodes since the main protag doesn't give a fuck about the girls.</br>   Typical tsundere shit <br><br>Will definitely not watch.</br></br>  <br>Not even for the Umi-clone?</br>    <br><br> I'm the sexiest </br></br>  This shit makes Chaos Dragon look like a masterpiece  <br> implying implications <br>Worst of the season so far are easily that and Shit Eater.</br></br>  <br>And by that I mean Chaos Dragon and Shit-Eater.</br>  <br>thanks for clearing that up</br>  <br>Did you just want to bump the thread from 404ing?</br>  <br>If that girl is the main girl, this will not be watched. I like harem anime, but this would be far too terrible for me to enjoy.</br>  <br>Which girl? Red head? Twin-tails? Blondie? The eccentric hime? The Not-Hyouki? None of them are MCs going by the first episode, the dude/trainer is.</br>  <br> Lewd <br>If doesn't have anything else except for lewd, then no.</br></br>  <br>It has a deadpan protagonist who doesn't fall for normal abuse from girls? That's something decent going for him besides his deadpan apathy with these girls constantly calling him a pervert.</br>  <br>yes i like it. it seems light hearted story or in otherword a comfy anime. it could be the comfiest anime this season imo</br>  <br>It's not lewd at all not even the steam exist. is that bad ?</br>  <br>Nobody even knows what this is.</br>  I'm watching it, no strong feelings about it either way though. The only thing that bothered me was everyone acting like he had cooties or something.  <br>It reminds me a bit of Nanoha<br><br> magic <br> bunch of girls flying around fighting monsters <br>Sans the female MC being used instead with a male one. I do like a few of the girls' designs and the blue hime type's personality.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he is sick but doesn't want everybody to know.</br>  Did Diomedea make a pact with the devil to make shitty magic school LN adaptations in exchange of being the ones doing Kancolle?<br>I sweat to god, they did like 3 in one season 2 seasons ago and now this.<br>Where's the good Diomedea show?</br></br>  <br><br> He attempts to sacrifice himself to save his friends and innocents from alien invasion <br> Survives but "ruins a mission" because he had to save everyone else in the first place <br> They blame him regardless for everything that went wrong <br>They are asses to the poor guy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What makes this shitty compare to kancolle?<br>You're not making sense.</br></br>  <br>That anon thinks because Kancolle anime was terrible, it still SOLD a fuck ton, over 23k or 24k for the first two volumes iirc. So its more of, they exchanged their "integrity" to make a pandering anime highly successful in exchange for making shitty anime adaptions after that.</br>  <br>No no, I didn't think that. But Kancolle is a cash cow, so I don't think Diomedea got it for free.</br>  <br>I don't doubt it but end game was, Kancolle anime made a fuck ton for Diomedea, and the show was literally Diomedea half-assing it most of the time. Kouhosei looks at least halfway decent unlike the Kancolle anime.</br>  Of course. I need my terrible harem chuuni show.<br>Last season I only had UBW after the 5 battle harems during the winter so I felt blueballed.</br>  <br>I do disagree with that. I thought Kancolle looked really pretty outside of the CG and sparse QUALITY.</br>  <br> sparse QUALITY <br>QUALITY was everywhere in the Kancolle anime, even outside of CGI sequences after episode 7.<br><br><br> chuuni show <br>How is it chuuni?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wo was literally the only character drawn without quality consistently in the anime. She's the exception, not the rule.</br>  <br>I still think it looked pretty.</br>  Still watching and will not drop.  <br>Too bad the animation was shit, the story was shit, the MC was shit, and the final battle was even more shit.<br><br>But yes sometimes it looked decent and was fun during SoL parts. Like the K-ONGOU sisters episode or Des Div 6 antics episode with the curry cookoff.</br></br></br>  <br> the story was shit, the MC was shit, and the final battle was even more shit. <br>The entire show should've been a comedy SoL. But I guess fans demanded battles.</br></br>  I just up Diomedea spends a bit more into the show's budget, it has a lot of potential to have better looking action sequences considering the shekels they made from the KanColle anime.  <br>Most of that money went to Kadokawa.</br>  <br>The red haired girl is cute<br>The blonde is too shy but she's still cute<br>The blue haired girl needs to be tossed off the island or sold to merchants so they can afford a bigger budget or something</br></br></br>  <br> Another red haired tsundere main heroine in a highschool battle harem <br>I really don't understand why Japan likes this.</br></br>  <br> he thinks redshit is the best <br>Goodluck in today's thread</br></br>  <br>Try to calm down your autistic hate and put on your glasses, it clearly says "cute" there</br>  <br>They didn't. Harada made the anime as stupid and dsyfunctional because of his writing and direction for the anime.<br><br>The few good episodes was by the one script lead from Sabagebu like the Kongou sisters and Akatsuki sisters episodes.</br></br></br>  <br> he thinks redshit is cute <br>My point still stands</br></br>  The MC is the reason I watch this, all the girls are trash so far but I have a feeling that black will be the best  <br>They have to pay the studio money for the actual budget. They have to pay a studio money a profit and Diomedea is getting a cut on any figurines derived from the anime.<br><br>Considering how little Diomedea used in it, they'll probably take in a LOT more then what they put in even if Kadokawa gets the lion share of the profit.<br><br><br>Which blue? There's twin tail tsundere, the weird hime, and the Not-Hyouki clone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you just kill yourself already?<br><br>Your whole life revolves around hating red haired characters</br></br></br>  Does MC's face and hair not remind anyone of Black Rock Shooter a bit? Its just a weird vibe I get from him.  <br>The annoying one that think she's a goddess and probably masturbates to her own reflection</br>  Waiting for next season for an actual good redhead heroine based off a battle academy LN  I'd fuck purple Not-Hyouki  <br> Your whole life revolves around hating red haired characters <br>What?<br>There are plenty of good red haired characters, just not in this show</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, its been 1 episode. Give her a chance at least before you write her off as generic or awful.</br>  <br>You didn't know? Hating red haired characters is a hot meme and you even have some guy that comes to every thread with a red haired girl to autistically shitpost about here. He's guaranteed to show up if the girl has red hair and is a tsundere.</br>  <br>I like her</br>  <br>Wait, when did this shitposting happen?</br>  <br>It's not a meme, it's just that red haired characters in a harem are usually the most annoying one.</br>  <br>She needs to be taken down from that pedestal</br>  <br>Who knows, but its a fact.<br>Just go into a thread about a show with a red haired tsundere and you'll see it.</br></br>  <br>But she's the prettiest one.<br><br><br>How long has this been going on for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Unfortunately</br>  <br>Gakusen or Rakudai?</br>  <br>Rakudai.<br>She's a tsundere done right and actually turns dere and isn't an abusive cunt.<br>She  wins  and wants nothing more than to be with her husbando. She's a good fighter too, and is a qt with a rockin' bod.</br></br></br>   http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-07-08/berserk-manga-confirm<wbr>ed-to-resume-as-monthly-series-this<wbr>-month/.90187</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Where were you when Miura raised from the ashes?</br></br>  Yeah, can't wait for 3-4 chapters and then another hiatus  <br>you have to believe.</br>  <br> Where were you when Miura raised from the ashes? <br>Dead.</br></br>  <br> There are people who died while waiting for berserk <br>;-;</br></br>  <br>I refuse to believe this.</br>  <br>At the very least Guts will get out of that fucking boat, should be fun to see how he'll different he'll look at the end of his ride</br>  I'll draw anything Griffith x Casca related, so request!  Sorry, I'm not a drawfag but I tried  <br>How old is Guts?</br>  <br> I'm not a drawfag  <br>I can tell.</br></br>  <br>Look at it this way,when the actual drawfag isn't doing shit, you gotta man up and try.</br>  <br>Have this.  [Griffith hair is a little bitch/spoiler]<br><br> Implying I'd ever draw Griffith getting fucked by a man. <br>Miura already did it.</br></br></br> </br>  <br>You should make a doujin</br>  I want to read up on the series.<br>What sites did you guys use to read it?</br>  <br>Nig that's good, too bad your taste is shit</br>  <br><br>Thank you a lot. I don't care if I'm the only one in the world who takes them seriously, as long as I can drew them however I please I'm the happiest.</br></br>  <br>Damn, guts sure got handsome.</br>  <br>Caska shoving a sword through Griffith's midsection.</br>  To the drawfag who said he was going to draw us something. Here, take my request.<br><br>Can you draw Griffith getting fucked in the ass by Casca making the Guts face? Can you draw Puck coming out of her ass hole?<br><br>This is the guts face I was talking about</br></br></br></br>  Why can't I hold all these sacrifices?  <br>I already posted what I drew and I did it thinking about you.<br><br><br>Also, this anon already completed your request you sickfuck.<br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>That drawing is shit though</br>  <br><br>I requested Puck coming out of Casca's anus...</br></br>  <br>I don't want to be rude to the anon, but I can try to fix Casca's face in this drawing<br><br>. <br>I'm not touching Griffith though.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah griffith is fine, I just want to see Puck coming out of her asshole with like a cute face.</br>  <br> I don't want to be rude to the anon <br>Don't worry, I know it's shit</br></br>  <br>Meh, it doesn't look *that* bad.<br>Not bad enough for Guts to scream to Casca not to look.<br><br>I was expecting his face to be entirely deformed, his nose to be cut off completely, his skin to be mostly peeled off with huge infection bubbles and puss coming out of hit, his hair completely cut, his ears entirely removed only showing the inner entrance.<br>A complete destruction of his face except for his eyes.<br><br>That image just makes it look like the torturer simply peeled a bit of his skin. <br>Personally I don't understand why he didn't simply pluck both of his eyes but I guess they were needed for further suffering before the Eclipse. Griffith needs eyes to see how much he's lost.<br><br><br>Niiiice. I love it.<br><br><br> yaoi shit <br>Boring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok! I'll work on it then.</br>  <br>Go fuck yourself name.</br>  <br> go fuck yourself <br>Shoving stuff in your anus is more in your department.</br></br>  I don't get new griffeth is he evil or not?<br><br>becuz on one had his crew is all apostles and he has a division with just demons but on the other hand he did kill that muslim wizard could king and drove all of them from his land and built a utopia, <br><br>imo tbh guts is the bad guy here for wanting to kill him for personal reasons</br></br></br></br>  <br>grif is fag imho</br>  <br>I can't believe that's a real link.</br>    <br>The involvement of the entire God Hand during the creation of Falconia, and the fact that there is a huge fucking stadium full of monsters inside Falconia, seems pretty fucking ominous.</br>  <br>He's the same Griffith he always was. The only difference is as a member of the God Hand he's incapable of feeling remorse for his actions.</br>  <br> becuz <br> imo <br> tbh <br><br>Why?<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All Apostles are evil, stop being dense.<br><br> he has a division with just demons but on the other hand he did kill that muslim wizard could king and drove all of them from his land <br>They were invaders, that doesn't make him evil but it wall all according to keikaku so that the astral could be merged.<br><br> build a utopia <br>At the cost of making everywhere else toxic and inhabitable. Yeah, sure. The God Hand basically just caged the entire human race in a single location to be slaughtered. Truly a good person would do something like that.<br><br> guts is the bad guy here for wanting to kill him for personal reasons <br>How is killing for personal reasons bad if they are justified? Is killing Griffith going to stop Falconia from functioning? <br>That reasoning is flawed and false.<br><br><br>Haha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it does but maybe the new society is for demons and humans to live 2gether? <br><br><br>I did get a lot fo homo vibes from him and he did get fugged by that one rich guy I think he's bi at least <br><br>new griff doesn't seem gay at all</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh? So wanting gay shit to be drawn, being attracted to a shota isn't gay and not in your department?<br><br>I'm pretty sure you're half way from fucking yourself already.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the god hand giraffe and new Griffith are seperate entities how can he be in two places at once?</br>  <br>i think he was legit gay back when he was younger, at least bi like you said, im pretty sure he wanted guts</br>  <br> Is killing Griffith going to stop Falconia from functioning?  <br> That reasoning is flawed and false. <br><br>it's not like it's some self automating system bruh you need a strong goverment to make sure it doesn't go to shit if guts does make his way back he will fuck up a lot of shit and ruins potentially everything</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like things up my ass. I'm a top.</br>  <br>Falconia is a monarchy system.<br><br><br>Please, you're a little bitch and even Puck would be on top of you.</br></br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/8phqA2gkkRc  [ ]  <br>right and I'm pretty sure that system would go to shit if the king and most of his nights were killed imo</br>  <br>You need to brush up on your history. Griffith is not king. And even if he died, the bloodline still resides with Charlotte.<br><br>If Griffith died, sure, there might be some riots but someone will eventually take his place.</br></br></br>  <br> If Griffith died, sure, there might be some riots but someone will eventually take his place. <br>He's migt not be king, but he's their leader and worshipped as a god. If he dies everything will go to shi.</br></br>  <br>guts will most likely kill charlotte too imo<br><br>plus like  said ppl worship griff as a god remember in real history when jesus died the spanish inquisition was the result</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off. Go punch your mother.<br><br><br>Is this put together well?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's important, sure, but you're overestimating how much shit would happpen if Griffith were to vanish. It wouldn't be that bad.<br><br><br> guts will most likely kill Charlotte <br>Maybe, we'll see. He has no real reason to kill her honestly.<br>I still predict that Griffith will consummate the marriage with her and  mind break her like he did with Casca. <br><br><br>You should go punch one of your two fathers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was sat at home drinking brain fluid</br>  <br>If she's pregs with his child you can be sure guts will slay her</br>  <br>Griffith has no need of an heir.</br>  <br>He does, Guts gun kill him</br>  Griffith was so innocent pre eclipse. Guts leaving really fucked him up bad.  <br>this a pretty fucking awesome game with an amazing ost.</br>  <br>Yes and no. The voice acting for ishdoro or whatever is pretty annoying. It doesnt match him at all. Pretty sure they fucked up bot having Rickert on the Hill of Swords too. Gameplay seems really tight. It could use a remake to be honest.</br>  <br> innocent </br>  <br> so innocent <br>Not as much as you'd think he was.<br>He has his cute innocent side and his serious as fuck side.</br></br></br>  <br>is*</br>  <br> sold his ass virginity to fund his warband <br> innocent </br></br>  <br> You should go punch one of your two fathers. <br>That doesn't even make any sense. <br><br><br> Griffith was so innocent <br>So Guts should have just submitted and became his tool?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that Casca?  Kinda looks like me </br>  <br>I'm calling you gay, faggot.</br>  <br>yea telling guts to kill that old man who tried to kill him and his kid that was real innocent<br><br>also raping a child (princess Charlotte)</br></br></br>  <br><br>can you two fags leave the thread already?<br>everything was going so well with one cancerous tripfag gone, please don't ruin this</br></br></br>  <br>You can just ignore it.</br>  <br>No faggot, I didn't say that. It was good that Guts left and went onto pursue his dream. But in the end, it sort of was the reason why Griffith acted so weird and fucked Charlotte and got his ass tortured.</br>  <br>You look like an ugly mexican.<br><br><br>So if I have two fathers, I'm gay? No. I just like sweet b!p.<br><br><br>You must be new. How're the threads treating you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Tane should go fuck himself and fuck off.<br><br><br> So if I have two fathers, I'm gay? <br>It's a stereotype faglord, don't think too hard on it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You look like an ugly mexican. <br>I know that, I just said it.</br></br>  was that preacher bruh a apostle or did he turn apostle last min? tbh it was really confusing but he looked so fucking strange when I 1st saw him I was like dis nigga apostle for sure, but then he had that stupid excuse that he slams his face into the ground every day to give him that freaky ass blockface look and I don no what to think anymore  <br>It's hard for morons to ignore literally retarded random irrelevant shitposters and it's hard especially for the literal retards who suck their dicks.</br>  <br>I love how you think you're superior. How comical. Consider suicide.<br><br><br>That must suck. Sorry to hear that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I-I tried!</br>  <br>I ship it</br>  <br>tripfags &gt; image.jpg</br>  It's been so long since I caught up, where's the story even at? Why are they on the boat again?  <br>I don't need to think to recognize the obvious.<br>Consider being anally raped and getting AIDS.</br></br>  <br>I think they're destroying Enemy U-Boats right now</br>  <br>to get on another boat</br>  <br>fuck lol</br>  <br>to go to fairy island so casca can be cured which is stupid imo guts just needs to focus on killing griffith</br>  <br>Nice, you're amazing, please teach me, anon senpai!<br> K.DS <br>Do you have a  tumblr  or something like that?
