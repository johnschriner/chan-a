How does no one have Saber cards yet  moonlanguage  <br>What is the question it ask you sometimes when you start up the game again?<br><br>It gives you two options.</br></br></br>  <br>Not when we have animated material.</br>  So who is that clowny caster?  <br>You have to make an offering with delicious food for her to be your servant</br>  <br>Mephisto</br>  <br>Mephistopheles</br>  I tried to download it but it said my devices were not compatible.<br><br>Just a samsung tablet.<br><br>Don't know if it's really not supported, or i'm doing something wrong because i'm a retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FemShirou is cute but I went with MaleRin this time.<br><br>Will she dethrone Hakuno?</br></br></br>  Has anyone managed to get a Sasaki Shonen card yet?  <br>Then it becomes a slippery slope.</br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/Nsg98EEf</br>  <br>It is. <br/></br>   Bought a new phone a month ago <br> Old phone would not have supported this <br><br>Thank you based Zenfone 2.</br></br></br>  <br> too poor to buy a new phone <br>Whatever I guess.</br></br>  <br>Just let it go for now, it was just released. Any future threads after today should go to /vg/ though</br>  <br><br>Can expect no less from a game developed by Aniplex, purveyors of superior products to the competition in their own words. That's a pretty huge error though to go to launch with.</br></br>  I wonder which servant would be the biggest shitposter.  <br>Everyone already agreed on this<br>Gawain</br></br>  FateGO is already achieving status of KUSOGE among japanese players  <br>This.<br><br>When I read "aniplex" in the logo screen, I knew something would go wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>So, what do you think about the confirmed Grand Order Arturia's design?</br>  <br>Get Moto X Style when it comes out. It's only $399 and has top-tier specs. /g/-approved budget phone.</br>  <br>She looks like four boobs are ready to burst free.</br>  <br>Of course<br><br>It is something new from TM itself, not a developer.<br><br>This is going to be huge and blow up. Hell I give it 5 days until we see a huge Pixiv explosion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mobage are kusoge by definition, so no worries about that. They're complaining about the cache issue, which is basically not accepting your shitty Servant.</br>  <br>Looks fat</br>  <br>Actual KAMIGE confirmed.</br>  <br>Why is she using the Moonlight Greatsword√¨?</br>  <br>The mid and breast part are drawn really bad. Make her look like a fatty.</br>  <br>They are overreacting because of the cache thing. Just a bunch of whiners.</br>  I am in awe of Gaius Julius Caesar.<br><br>He's a fat fuck and yet I am drawn to his self-confidence.</br></br>  <br>Because the mushroom is a huge Dark Souls fan</br>    <br>Because this game is going to work in as many dark souls references as possible</br>  So how does it fuck up your game exactly.  <br>Nah they're bitching about the cache thing. I got Mata Hari and I'm not complaining.<br><br>Accept your destiny, befriend your Servant.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are the designs for the female servants so fucking shitty?</br>    <br>I wonder what From thinks of it.</br>  <br>Is his hero jacket fused with his shirt?</br>  <br>That's not from the game though.</br>  <br>He has traits that the likely player audience identify with (you know what) and traits they want but will likely never have. He is truly perfection</br>  <br><br>He was drawn by Wada Arco?</br></br>  <br>I think it deletes your progression. No biggy since you're just starting.</br>  <br>Caesar is glorious.</br>  <br> PRAISE THE SUN </br>    <br>That's fanart.</br>  <br>What the fuck.</br>  <br>Pretty gar tbh.</br>  <br> totally not Robin Hood </br>  <br> (you know what) <br>But Japanese people are barely fat. A lot of them are like beanstalks, because they save money for the next waifu product.</br></br>  <br>The hell is this?</br>    <br>Romulus of Astora</br>  <br>Romulus.</br>  <br><br>Good fuck Aniplex and Iwakami. Their whole mobage division seems pretty ill-conceived in the first place between this and that home appliances game. It's bad enough they can't even come up with their own franchises and have to rely on Type/Moon and Nitroplus all the time nowadays, they clearly can't even properly develop a simple cell phone game and get it out at launch in working order. There will almost assuredly be patches, but I would be concerned about getting the game just yet if you have any long term plans with it.</br></br>      <br>This isn't even his final form.</br>  What's her actual identity called? I she one of the other tails?  <br>that guy who sucks wolf titties.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=94f<wbr>Q_f95g-I</wbr>  [ ]  <br>The rest of the jacket is waving behind him.</br>  <br>GAR as fuck.</br>    <br>Tamamo Cat</br>  <br>His hero jacket was blown to behind</br>    When is the game coming out??  <br>Leonidas is pretty cool.</br>  How was this not made Lancer's final design? His official get-up is so lame.<br><br><br><br>So is this game like Adventure Quest for mobile platforms? How does it work?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgive me for being ignorant, but KUSOGE?</br>  <br>Bestserker,  save for Jack .</br>  <br>Now.</br>  Guys, is the game working for you at the moment? Any more information on that server maintenance?    <br>Prototype Lancer best Lancer</br>  <br>go design &gt;proto</br>  <br>That design was confirmed to be in the game ages ago.</br>  <br>Shit game</br>  So....<br> What are the prices for the gems? </br>  <br>Stupid sexy Shirou.</br>  <br>Its one of his forms, it was in the trailer.<br><br>This stil gives me hope for berserker cu</br></br></br>  I installed it through qooapp or w/e, I start it and it goes to a screen and I think I get an error 88- 1438278512 then it closes.  <br><br>I meant for the official VN.</br></br>  <br>So, he is like Gilgamesh, no? The same tattoo</br>  So anybody not in Japan have this game yet?  Best Seiba.  Here's the pastebin from /fgo/ on how to get the game working in case you're a newfag<br><br> http://pastebin.com/Nsg98EEf </br></br>  <br>Goddamn, Shirou and Sakura are perfection itself, I must have more of this!</br>  <br>We were playing it when the servers went manteinance.</br>  <br>It's different hero. Like SaberLily. His first slightly armorless form was teased in first trailers.</br>      <br>Yup. Just deleted everything since I've wasted an hour on it with no success.</br>  <br><br>I love how they went for the arm cloth and japanese motif for both of them.</br></br>  <br>Oppai Rin &gt; Japanese Sakura</br>  <br>I like Sakura's haircut. It gives her more personality</br>  <br>I don't get why he's dressed some two thousand years out of style.</br>  So anyone get out of the burning Fuyuki map before maintenance came down? Where do you go next?  <br>Thank you, anon.</br>  <br><br>It's under maintenance.</br></br>  AMERICA FUCK YEAH  <br>That's a server maintenance notification</br>  <br>Best design Takeuchi made in a while. I love it.</br>  <br>What's this? Early adult Sakura?</br>  <br>If you have garbage taste, sure.</br>  <br>They even got his name right, as opposed to 300.</br>  <br>Same reason Nero is a little girl</br>  <br>Shirou's arm shirt is a reference from HF and Sakuras arm shit is from her future design.</br>  <br>He's dressed a lot like Nero, if you look at his top and bottom parts you'll notice its very Rome.<br><br>Nero also has that business thing.</br></br></br>  <br> liking wormslut </br>  <br>First time I legit liked the way Sakura looked.</br>    <br>Who is this?</br>  <br> liking rhinos </br>  Why do they keep milking this shit franchise?  <br>Calamity Jane</br>  <br>Calamity Jane apparently.</br>  <br>Guys, you do realise we might see this design animated in the epilogue of the HF movie, right?</br>  <br>Who is the artist? For *slurp* future references</br>  <br>In F/SN Sakura is 15, here she is probably 17-18</br>  <br>Fortunately I'm not an anime only ufo cocksucker.</br>  <br>How do we go from this to that?</br>  <br>epic anime meme dude doesnt change the fact that she in the VN a wormslut</br>  <br> *slurp* <br>That's my dick you're slurping there, faggot.<br><br>Don't stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is just me or Sakura goes full CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT here?</br>  <br>Of course they are going to say that. They don't want you to keep rerolling for 5* for free after all.</br>  <br>Her "character" was always pretty "developed".</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>That is fake, you guys have no sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet they added that "feature" after the last maintenance.</br>  <br>That would require short hair. This, however, is clearly not.</br>  <br>The FATTEST Seibah.<br><br> Arturia got her looks from Nero <br> she got her appetite from Julius </br></br></br></br>  <br>All makes sense now.</br>   Caesar has B rank Agility   <br>Why, it's true.</br>  How many times can you reroll?  <br>Euralie, I take it?</br>  <br>Stheno.</br>  <br>Stheno.</br>  <br>Sutenno. The heck?</br>    <br>Stheno, learn to read</br>  where is the OP, no one has it yet?  <br>Is that her endurance and magic being ex-rank?</br>  <br/>  <br><br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Sorry, I didn't put much Talent Points in nipspeech.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's an acrofat</br>  <br>Now seriously, both of them have the japanese style and arm cloth thing. You are just being desperate here.</br>  <br>Not really. I wasn't baiting anyone.</br>  <br>Old and busted<br><br><br>New hotness</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bitch looks like Timmy Williams from Whitest Kids You Know.</br>  <br>It's Luck and Magic Resistance.</br>  <br>Magic and Luck</br>  <br>I had it loaded in one tab, but couldn't copy it from the cache. I got bored of watching it with no sound so I closed it.<br><br>I posted all those screenshots in this and the old thread.</br></br></br>  <br>He is just calling bait to random stuff he doesn't like or something like that.</br>  <br>Only thing they got in common is the japanese outfit retardo.</br>  <br> Stheno <br> Servant <br> Assassin <br>Jesus Christ, how is it even possible?</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying wormslut isn't a meme <br><br><br>Yeah you gotta justify that shit taste somehow don't you?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Takeuchi <br>Nakahara, the artist for prototype, made it. Unless you're talking about Shirou's design?</br></br>  <br><br>so thats means lancer is also the same </br></br>  <br>Yes, and that is what I said? The Rin, Sakura and Shirou cards are supposed to be a set, you retard.</br>  <br> EX Luck <br>Oh boy, you don't need anything else with fucking EX luck.</br></br>  <br>He lacks the japanese motif. Also, he is not a support card.</br>  <br>What's the different between 4star shirou and 5star shirou? Also I don't think the 5 star shirou's name is written Emiya Shirou at all.</br>  <br>Not happening</br>  <br>Different effect. They are not character cards, they are support cards.</br>  NASUUUUUUUUU  <br>Attack</br>  <br>I mean this one</br>  <br>They're stat increases for your servant. Not servants.</br>  <br>That didn't help Drake tho.<br><br>So the Mona Lisa is a self portrait in the Nasuverse.</br></br></br>   meme <br>it's like you even didn't play the VN<br> please shinji fuck me because muh worms </br></br>  <br>Apparently the Mona Lisa was a self-portrait</br>   all these people caring about a mobage in japanese   <br>What thought process do you think Nasu goes through to decide which historical figure gets genderbent?</br>  <br> Mona Lisa is a self portrait <br>Clever</br></br>  <br>I don't understand why anybody would have a problem with genderbent characters. It's better to make them women.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind the hair cut showing up in the epilouge.</br>  <br>meant for </br>  <br>He compares how cool the are as a male to how cute/sexy they would be as a female.</br>  <br> rape means she's a slut <br><br>Sasuga anon-kun</br></br></br>  Any one got the APK?    <br> Reads legend. <br> If he gets a boner in that period it gets genderbend. <br>But since one of the theories concerning abou the Mona Lisa was that it was Leonardo in drag Nasu probably rolled with it.</br></br></br>  <br>Why the cutest didn't get bent?</br>  <br>Nothing given that the designs and the Servant itself is made by other people.</br>  <br>The name is Marie. It even says so in clear katakana.</br>  <br>What does she ride?</br>  Can you start with Avenger?  <br>Beautiful. But what does she ride?

Seems people were able to get in in between, so I guess that's good.<br><br>Still, you'd think Aniplex and their Scrooge McDuck piles of money would be able to make something a little less broken.</br></br>  <br>muh dick</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#!VQBlCKZZ!9nm7H<wbr>iAt0gtokVcC2M5OwxruAKF5RQ3PQxBLQXHQ<wbr>oI0</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>The arm sleeves made me think of their combined attack from BMW.</br></br>  <br>Haven't got them yet, but they're supposed to.</br>  <br>Another semen demon to the list.<br><br>Yep.</br></br></br>  <br>nasu is the guy who approved the design <br><br>this is from nobunga the fool</br></br></br>  <br>You're supposed to be emailed a code for that.

Doctors who examined d'√âon's body after d'√âon's death discovered that d'√âon would have actually been assigned male at birth. <br><br>Well ok then.<br>You win this time Nasu.</br></br></br></br>  <br> d'√âon de Beaumont <br>This is actually what gets me more. It's so silly.</br></br>  <br>The Chevalier d'√âon, a real life crossdresser and spy.<br><br>No idea if they made him a girl.</br></br></br>  Does it still say maintenance for anybody right now? Is anybody playing with an android at the moment?  <br>Cheers</br>  <br>Is there Pablo Diego Jos√© Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Mar√≠a de los Remedios Cipriano de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad Martyr Patricio Clito Ru√≠z y Picasso too?</br>  <br>Fitting for someone who pleases old men for money.</br>  <br> I like how they have the same color scheme. </br>  What specs does it require?<br><br>I'm on gingerbread and my phone is relatively weak.</br></br>  <br>Blame rich old men.</br>  <br>Yeah, still say maintenance for me.</br>  It's not maintenance. They're banning all the filthy gaijin who got into the game.  <br>Like Caesar?</br>  <br>Minimum of Android 4.1 and 2GB of RAM</br>  <br>Because 19th century whorehouses had the best fashion.</br>  <br>Rin would totally fuck Caesar for money</br>  <br>If this is true, I literally can't understand why. Japs seem like the only ones who hate getting more players and potential customers for their shit.</br>  <br><br> wormslutfags still don't know that, this meme make no sense because she doesn't even need money <br><br>Q: How does Tohsaka Rin pay for her living expenses when she is performing sorcery using such valuable jewels? Is she eating up her parents‚Äô inheritance? Has she taken up a part-time job like Shirou? Or has she turned her hand to some other trade?<br><br> A: The Tohsaka family is still relatively wealthy because it receives royalties from magical patents (theories and rituals used at the Clock Tower. Like real-life patents.), and as a result their income is surprisingly high. Even without any additional revenue, annual income is roughly #0,000,000 yen. ...Although, Rin feels a bit ashamed of this since it's all thanks to the work of previous generations. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of the future versions of RIn become sluts. Look at TOHSAKA.</br>  <br>It isn't. There's literally a post on the GO site saying it's because of people deleting their cache.</br>  <br>NTR Fatman as a Servant when?</br>  <br> she doesn't even need money <br>So she does it for free?</br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>thought so, point still stands, nips are fucking autists when it comes to region locking.</br>  <br>The strongest Lancer.</br>  <br>Not soon enough.<br><br>I hope future NTR doujins in Fate will feature Fat Caesar being smug as hell instead of faceless fat men.</br></br></br>  <br> meme <br> upset for a long running joke <br> hurdur my pure waifu <br> implying it's not saberfag propaganda <br>As much I like Rin, it doesn't really bother me that much.<br> Saber a shit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wormslut fags trying this hard </br>    <br>ÔΩâÔΩî„ÄÄÔΩÉÔΩÅÔΩíÔΩíÔΩâÔΩÖÔΩì„ÄÄÔΩèÔΩïÔΩî„ÄÄÔΩÅÔΩéÔΩÑ„ÄÄÔΩâÔΩì„ÄÄÔΩó</br>  <br>That's because of finicky business laws. Europeans trying to buy things from America because the Euro branch of something hasn't worked on it get treated similarly.</br>  <br> OLD MEN <br> GEMS </br></br>  <br>As soon as Shirou leaves to play hero in the sand, she jumps on Luvia's dick and works as a prostitute with Luvia as her pimp.</br>  <br>Can't handle the banter mate?</br>  What's this  None of the Strange Fake guys in the game, then?  <br>you're reaching really far right now anon.</br>  <br>Still no Lancelot or Gilgamesh? Are they 5 stars or something? Why so hard to get?</br>  <br>Servers down.</br>  <br>It's not funny though<br><br>Well, it may have been at first but like all good jokes 4chinz beats it to death</br></br></br>  <br>This is Fate GO screwing up on the first day.</br>  <br>Means it's under maintenance.</br>  remove ANIPLEX  <br>You first step into learning Japanese. Good luck.</br>  <br>Get over yourself.</br>  How long is this maintenance going to fucking take? If they're planning on fixing the cache exploit in one go, I can't see it coming back up before tomorrow.    <br>Previous one apparently lasted 5 hours.</br>  Still no Russian Servant, I presume?

He doesn't count.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not because I like /a/ more <br><br>Is what you meant to say, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu would find a way to make him a Saber clone.</br>  <br><br>He'd be pretty useless in a fight</br></br>  <br>because he failed</br>  <br>We already have one WW1 era servant.

He only said Rin was the closest thing to a heroine in the story.</br>  <br>strongest<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Would Nasu be willing to bite the bullet and take the controversy?</br>  Is Vlad popular? I wonder why he would ever be a five star otherwise.  What do you guys think about Boudica's design?  <br>So did Jing Ke, but here she is.</br>  <br>He's under contract. Not even a proper hero. Unless Rasputin is secretly assassinating a time traveling interdimensional assassin contracted to the same nebulous magical weirdness that EMIYA is, Rasputin doesn't get the same perks.</br>  <br>It's shit, even if there're some nice callbacks to Arturia's own design.</br>  acutally hitler appeard in Koha Ace even it's comedy manga  <br> *slurp* <br><br>Why are typemoon fags the fucking worst posters?<br><br>Seriously, this shit ain't even /a/ related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The funny thing is I'm pretty sure they wanted this game out to promote the UBW anime and even with all the development time and that having ended over a month ago it still has problems.</br></br>  Someone please tell me they got Gawain.  <br>  In the Rin route, an equal relationship with a woman who's become stronger than men is depicted. Rin and Shirou mend each other's weaknesses with their own unique strengths, and I think it makes for a very nice relationship. </br>  Is Jeanne in the game?  <br>This is his third incarnation as a Servant. I guess he must be popular.</br>  <br>who cares about that fag</br>    <br>gil pls</br>  <br>It's one post in the whole thread. Just ignore or report you autist.</br>  <br>yeah she is a five star.</br>  How much space does this shit require?  <br>Shhh go back to bed Nero</br>  <br>Or a timetravelling demon-summoning robot.</br>  <br>Does that mean she's fucking impossible to get?</br>  <br>This franchise seems to have less of a balance between gar dudes and moe waifus with each successive iteration.</br>  <br>Pretty sure that in Strange Fake Caster suggest that his Master should have summoned Elmyr de Hory (1906-1976).</br>  <br>2GB, I think? Though it apparently can run with less.</br>  <br><br> Those eyes <br><br>It might just be the camera but they're pretty terrifying, it's like staring into an abyss</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure he gets servant power-up just like Shakespeare, Da Vinci and all the non fighting historical figures.</br>  <br><br>try to agree on one at least, but the truth is that no one likes Gawain, so I understand why it'd be hard</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Is she Bismarck?</br>  <br>But you liked that Scathach's suit straight from Taimanin games, right?</br>  <br>Kill yourself shitskin</br>  <br>not liking the best saber</br>  iOS version when?  <br>There is no controversy in Japan<br><br>Hitler shows up in plenty of Japanese video games and manga. Hell, in Jojo there's a nazi soldier and he's one of the good guys.<br><br>Don't forget that Japan was allied with Nazi Germany in WW2.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Gawain pls</br></br>  <br> rider hitler <br> rides his nazi limousine <br> can summon the luftwaffe and whermacht <br> his ultimate attack is placing his opponent in a gas chamber </br></br></br></br>  What is this?

Otherwise it was pretty good.  <br>Apparently it was the longest volume yet, according to Eusth. I agree that it felt shorter than the preceding volumes, though.

The confession was as far as he ever got. And anytime he became aware of the loop he'd start on trying to break out.</br>  <br>You mean Mogi, or the wall? In Mogi's case, not even once. The loop cut off before it could go anywhere.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I'm sure one time in that loop Kazuki did this on Mogi<br><br> ‚ÄîBang, bang! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why do westerners suck at anime art?</br>  <br>In the end did aya or the wall got pregnant from all that banging?</br>  <br>He mindbroke both the wall and Aya.</br>  <br>I think it's pretty good</br>  <br>I wish someone can translate OP and ED so I can understand the lyrics. Eus</br>  The ending wasn't perfect, but it was pretty good nonetheless.<br>It was a happy ending overall with no cop outs, although i was hopping for more psyco Kazuki rather than zombie Kazuki.</br>  I feel bad for Kazuki. It didn't seem like he was around in either Daiya's or Yanagi's dream worlds. It's like their perfect lives have no place for him.  <br>Why do you want a crazy lunatic in your dream world?</br>  <br> You're everything that's wrong with the industry. <br>What's wrong?<br><br>The execution is what's matter, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Madly" is the key word here.</br>  So could Aya actually predict the future or was the flashback distorted and she was a normal human (albeit sharp and manipulating) with Maria's brain reinterpreting events and utterances?  <br> anime never <br>And it better stay that way.</br></br>  <br>Seems to me like she was just very manipulative.</br>  <br>I think it's the latter. but I don't think she's a 'normal' human though</br>  <br>Wasn't that the entire point? That she wasn't some monster or superhuman, in the end she was just a child, albeit a very exceptional one.</br>  From 1-10, How much you rated this LN? 9 for me. it's a bit weak at vol.2 and vol.4 and some twist seems a bit forced. but how the Author wrote this series, build up and ending is just too great.  <br>7.8/10</br>  <br> vol 2 <br>6/10<br> vol 3 &amp; 4 <br>7/10<br> everything else <br>10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It definitely was a bit weak on those vols, but the build up and character development is worth.<br>So all in all i would say 8.5, with vol 6 being the best rating at 10.</br></br>  <br>90% of LNs unfortunately.</br>  <br>I think the facts are all true. Maria's interpretations were just very distorted.<br><br>E.g. the "predictions" were actually minor things that could be made with some observation or by causing them.</br></br></br>  <br>8/10 <br>i really hate that volume about kazuki getting possessed by weird girl</br></br>  It was far from being the best book in the series, but a very good ending.<br>I loved some parts, like everything about Maria. Half of the book being the epilogue kinda hurt it though, I wish it had more stuff from vegetable Kazuki's viewpoint.<br>Not as bombastic a the rest of the series, but the mood was much more gloomier.</br></br>  <br>It was definitely the weakest arc of the series. Many people dropped this series because vol. 2 is so weak</br>  <br>I actually love the final volume the best. It's true that there's no great twist like the previous, but the narration, the build up to the epilogue is great. And the way the ending plays out with no cop outs or Deus Ex machina, that's just perfect</br>  <br>I'm not sure if the original writing's the best, because I can't read moon, but Eusth's translation work is at its finest.</br>  <br>He didn't have to be. For the longest time everyone knew him they thought he was stupidly ordinary. I still like that, though. Because it hammers in that he really does need Maria.</br>  Vol. 7 &gt; Vol. 1 &gt; Vol. 6 &gt; Vol. 5 &gt; Vol. 3 &gt; Vol. 4 &gt; Vol. 2  <br>I'd switch places between 3 and 4, but otherwise it looks solid.</br>  <br>Yeah I still don't get some of that</br>  <br>I can't stop listening to the ED either.</br>  I was hoping we'd get to see more Empty Box shenanigans, but oh well. Seeing O give up was also weird.  Who gave maria her box?<br> if O is created by maria box</br>  <br>No idea. Maybe she made it herself. Doesn't really matter.</br>  <br> anime never <br>for good</br></br>  <br>How does a middle-school Japanese girl construct a box that grants wishes?<br><br>I suppose the easiest way to explain is it is that Maria made the "I want to grant everyone's wishes" wish and it somehow came true.<br><br>Or maybe Aya had a box that gave her those manipulation powers, and it passed down to Maria after Aya died and it changed due to their personalities. <br><br>I guess Eiji left it vague on purpose? Idk.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My interpretation is that magic or esper abilities or whatever you want to call it exist. Aya was able to predict the future so maybe it was running in the family. Maria's ability took shape in the boxes and O but she was always the source and the origin.</br>  <br>O is Flawed Bliss and Kazuki ripped it apart from the inside.</br>  <br>Volume 5:<br>  O: "Not quite. Hm... let's take a large pool as an example. Pretend that the water is 'me'. Now take a cup and scoop some of the water into it. That's 'O'. The cup that's used to shape me is the direction known as 'O'." <br><br>Volume 7:<br> <br>  Suddenly, I sensed a soft stream of air that corresponded to my movements. However, I could see no point in controlling the breeze and prepared myself to disappear from this world. <br>  Ah, but wait. <br>  There's something I have to do. <br>  I must "make everyone in the world happy." <br>  Although I was supposed to be empty, there was still a direction for me to go in. All at once, the stream of air acquired a direction and started to gather around me. <br/></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>The rest is up to your imagination and doesn't really matter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eusth-sama, thank you for all your hard work.</br>  So wait, was "I want to be needed" the actual wish Maria put into her box, or was it just the reason behind her wish of "I want to make everyone happy"?  Should I even bother reading vol 7 right now if I don't remember the details from the first six? I don't want to ruin the experience for myself.  <br>Wasn't it that the wish she put in was "I want to make everyone happy", and the reason it was so flawed was because what she actually wanted was to be needed?</br>  <br>Do you remember the end of volume 6, and roughly the events of volume 1? If so, you can pretty much just dive into this. I think it adds a lot to be able to keep in mind how far the characters have come, but you're not really snubbed out of any important plot details if you can't clearly remember everything about the previous volumes.</br>  <br>My take from Vol. 5 and 7 is that the power that grants people wishes has always been there. It's just that it's a formless power, uncontrolled by and doesn't belong to any normal person. Maria probably isn't the only one whose wish(es) was granted either.<br><br>However, it's only because of Maria's wish that the power and the wishes it grants take forms ('O' and the boxes). Why did the original power choose to grant Maria's wish? We don't know, maybe it choose people who were in despair, maybe Maria was special, or maybe God just played dice and choose Maria randomly. It doesn't matter to the story.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I figured, I just got confused because she was talking about her true wish, and then there were the bits about her memory being distorted, so I didn't feel sure I got it right.</br>  <br>Well, I guess "I want to be needed" would at least explain the reason that O took its form. O provided boxes that granted wishes in a flawed manner. Most everyone that wished upon them needed saving, and in comes Maria to crush their boxes and give them flawed happiness.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, yeah, anon. LN's are garbage, I know you're only read REAL literature. Now stay away from this thread.</br></br>  <br>Thank you mate.</br>  So what's next for the author? I head he already started something  <br>To be honest Zero no Maria is one of the few LNs that are actually good.<br><br>The vast majority of them are terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>He's taking a break from LNs at least</br>  The only thing Krillin ever accomplished in Dragon Ball Z was having sex with an android  <br>thats more than you did</br>  <br>Well she was the 2D sex dream of an entire generation, and he fucked her.</br>  <br>She fucked him.</br>  <br>Living proof that it doesn't take much to be a great man.</br>  <br>truly a hero</br>  <br>He accomplished more than Yamcha</br>    He became the strongest human.  <br><br>True</br></br>  <br>cute</br>  <br>He was able to get to the semi-finals in two of the tournaments. <br><br>He was also able to kill the most saibamen. <br><br>Can't think of anything else</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Tien is the strongest human. He was stronger than krillen throughout dragon ball, and in Z he has king kai training, held off 2nd stage cell, and is always off training while krillen chills out with roshi. <br><br>Don't give me that triclops shit either. It doesn't matter why he has 3 eyes he's still human species even if he's a different race or has a mutation or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br>He also killed Cell.</br>  <br> Tien is the strongest human. <br>Not according to Toriyama and SJump</br></br>  <br>I know right. He was laughing pretty hard when krillen showed up to the games.</br>  <br>so the animal mans are also humans ?</br>  <br>Krillin is stronger, but Tien is an alien.</br>  Krillin repeatedly saved other Z-fighters. Gohan would be dead, Goku would be double dead for the second time, Piccolo would be dead again, etc.<br><br>Although he never really beat anyone he was far more use than practically anyone else.</br></br>  i read tien is human but a hybrid from third-eye-clan  <br>Fuck what toriyama says. He's played it fast and loose since day one. If he said puar was stronger than god goku tomorrow that might make it canon but it still would make no sense in the actual context of the work and story mechanics established. And superman can lift 200 quintillion tons with one arm and the flash has attosecond reaction time too, right.</br>  <br>Fucker could grow extra arms<br>That ain't human<br>No fucking way Chiaotzu is human either<br>Freaks of a feather flock together I guess</br></br></br></br>  <br>and Goku would never have become a super saiyan without krillin  or at least not for a while, assuming he somehow survived the fight with Frieza without going SSJ </br>  <br> Not according to Toriyama and SJump <br>Toriyama has never said that Kuririn is stronger than Tenshinhan. He did once in an interview casually go along after someone else said that Kuririn is the strongest human, but come on, Tenshinhan is a minor character that easily might not have been in his mind.<br><br>Look at his actual work. Most recently, Kuririn almost gets killed by Freeza's soldiers during the forest part of the battle in RoF, beaten up and thrown on the ground, and had to be rescued by Gohan, while Tenshinhan had no problem at all during the battle in spite of getting tired towards the ending.</br></br></br></br>  found this http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Th<wbr>e_Top_Earthling_Tournament</wbr>  <br>I don't have words for such stupidity. Take a remedial biology class, faggot.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Go watch/read Dragonball, fagets. Tien is human. Not even animal-man. Just human.<br><br>Toriyama said Krillin was stronger though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>krillin is so virile he impregnated a robot</br></br>  <br>Show me where it says he's alien or anything other than a human with 3 eyes.</br>  <br> Using the Japanese names </br>  <br>do you think krillin ever kicks out roshi for the night when him and 18 are having sex. i bet he'll be playing with his dick</br>  <br> Tien is human <br>But all evidence implies the contrary.</br></br>  <br> I can't grow extra arms. <br>Not enough training anon. Do you even lift?</br></br>  <br>Oh, but all that flying and shit was normal human behavior for videl, krillen, etc. It's called a technique and there's all sorts of whacky shit that happens in dragonball chalked up to a special move.</br>  <br> Go watch/read Dragonball, fagets. Tien is human. Not even animal-man. Just human. <br>The Tenshinhan is descendant from the three eye race thing comes from the Daizenshuu. Most of the extra backstory information in the Daizenshuu came from Toriyama, although that bit specifically isn't outright said to come from him. Still, it sounds way too random to have been made up by Daizenshuu's editors.</br></br>  <br>I'm not North American, those are the names used by my county's dub too.</br>  <br>Chi focus vs some reptilian like/equivalent limb growing thing<br><br>Care to try again?</br></br></br>  <br>Flying is caused by Chi.<br><br>Can Chi turn into solid matter and make arms?</br></br></br>  <br> it turns out Puar is a god of creation or something but got severe amnesia and forgot how to pack a punch <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Just to get this straight, are we considering Tien human or not? Although the dividing line for what a species is can be hand wavy, we need to pick some dividing line and saw whether or not he's human. At first I figured he could probably breed with humans and have kids that are potent, but Saiyans can do that too so we can't use that logic  plus Tien will never have kids .<br><br>Can we all agree that Tien and Krillin are in 1st or 2nd or 2nd and 1st place for strongest human-looking thing that lives on Earth that isn't a Saiyan? We could also go by merit, right? Krillin got an essentially no work powerup on Namek, did Tien ever get one of those? Or did he just work himself? That isn't to say that Krillin wouldn't do the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Krillin is human.<br><br>Krillin can split into multiple people.</br></br></br>  <br>Krillin and Tien are probably the two strongest not-saiyans born on Earth.</br>  <br>Tien is definitely human. Krillen vs. Tien is up for debate, but Tien is and always has been human.</br>  <br> Can we all agree that Tien and Krillin are in 1st or 2nd or 2nd and 1st place for strongest human-looking thing that lives on Earth that isn't a Saiyan? <br>There's still Piccolo and the Androids.</br></br>  Soon.

Then get let down by HANATE MONSUTAH but it'll grow on you. Have you gotten to the LDS Trio yet?</br>  <br>Go to Toys R Us or Target.<br><br>Also, should I go to the preview event on the first? I just recently got back into the game and have a tradtional/unlimited format Blue Eyes Ultimate deck, and I want to make a Red Eyes deck and a Toon deck. I pulled Lord of the Red's ritual and my friend pulled LotR, and wanted to trade for my comic hand, but I want to build a toon deck too.<br><br>Also, should I buy the new Gold Series?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He didnt watch the OVA with the rocket </br>  How would you all feel if when the dub makes to heartland, academia and the city they throw in all these ridiculous referances to the old series like the Obelisk Force talking about Aster,Zane or Alexis or Shun and Yuto using some form of Yuma's catchphrase or Jack and Crow make quips about Yusei missing or something? They already made a reference to Yugi being the king of games in the arc-v dub so far.  <br> let down by HANATE MONSUTAH <br>It grew on me, but song would have been better if the singer's voice were a bit stronger.</br></br>  <br>If you're collecting, you should ALWAYS go to the sneak peek. The pull rates are typically better than from regular boxes.<br><br>Just fair warning, Black Stone and Flare Metal are both Secret Rare, so building Red Eyes is going to be expensive and difficult.<br><br>If you're looking to play seriously, invest in something either cheap and relatively strong (U.A. or Yosenju) or genuinely successful in the meta game (Burning Abyss, Shaddolls, Nekroz).<br><br>Be prepared to buy Singles. Collecting 3 of a specific Secret Rare can take more than an entire CASE, but Black Stone and Flare Metal are going to be relatively cheap as singles because the competitive market is largely going to ignore them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, while I do want to collect I do want to play too. I'll go if I have enough cash to spare since I'm a bit broke atm. <br><br>Another card I want is Mirror Force dragon, but it's already up to ~$50, so I feel like it'll be better to just buy packs and hope to pull it. Problem is Fang of Critias is the same rarity, so I'd need to get lucky enough to pull that too.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, I just started episode 1. I like the idea of all these duel schools kinda like cram schools in Japan. It's interesting. One thing I'm wondering is, with all this solid technology that Arc-V has, can the monsters actually hurt the players when they attack directly?</br>  <br>I actually like Hanate since the Jack v Yuya was the first episode I ever saw. It's subtle but it's got a nice rhythm to it and I like the singer's voice.</br>  In Neo Domino City, Dr. Fudo's prodigy son, Yusei, is finishing his third engineering doctorate, this time with the thesis worked upon conjointly with his fiance, Izayoi Aki, by looking into bio-engineering and how technology can better be manipulated with the Momentum Drive. Young Yusei tends to get too caught up in his work, and Ms. Aki takes it upon herself to interrupt his studies to check his vitals every so often, generally recommending the two go out for a night in Tops, either watching Duel Chasers hunt down dirty hungry Commons, or visiting the skating rink. (This reporter notes that Ms. Aki is terrible at skating, as something about her seems to keep her perpetually off-balance.)  <br>Yes, players do, on occasion, get injured by the monsters. It's also implied pretty early on that Solid Vision with Mass can kill people. In most duels, direct attacks are softened, and when the little kids duel, the action field is softened like a bounce-house to keep them from getting hurt.</br>  <br> so I feel like it'll be better to just buy packs and hope to pull it <br>Thats retard gambler logic. Its that much money for a reason, your chances of pulling some junk rare instead are astronomically higher. Save if you want it that much, or buy something cheaper, trying to cut costs by buying packs never works. The house always wins</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x-5<wbr>xY6ClVeU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I hate these endings. They basically end the show as different people, since they have no recollection of prior events</br>  <br>Honestly, give up on Critias. The pull-rate was throttled to a ridiculous level, and you will spend WAY more than $50 trying to pull him, meanwhile you won't get anything of value from DRL2, and Mirror Force Dragon is going to drop to $5-10 in another month or two.<br><br>Also, Gold Series Return of the Bling is shit. You don't want it. If you got the urge to buy packs, either wait a week for CORE, or pick up some DUEA, NECH and SECE. DUEA in particular, as Dante is one of, if not the most expensive card on the competitive scene right now, and people will trade through the nose to get him.</br></br></br>  <br>Idk, there's some cards in there I like, Paladin of Dark Dragon for one, and the other Legendary Knight/Dragon cards. I already pulled Tyrant Wing though, so that's good.<br><br>I might go to the preview for CORE.</br></br></br>  <br>Paladin of Dark Dragon is VERY easy to pull. So is pretty much everything that isn't Tarotrei, Mimicat or the Dragons, none of which are worth the trouble you will go through trying to get them.<br><br>Unless you are completely unable to go to the sneak peek, GO TO THE SNEAK PEEK! GODDAMN. If you don't get a sneak peek kit, but you buy packs from that set, you are throwing your money away. It shouldn't even be a question you should have to ask. If you play the TCG, you need to go to sneak peeks.<br><br>You might meet some new friends too. The event itself is a lot of fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you play the TCG, you need to go to sneak peeks <br>I wouldnt say that, going to the sneak peek with the intent of making money is dumb, unless you know you'll be able to unload the cards for pre release hype prices. Go if you think it seems fun, not with the expectation of going plus</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I've already got one friend who will most likely go with me. Too bad I probably won't get the mat though. But at least I'll get the preview packs and card.</br>  <br>The mat is a crapshoot, dude. Everyone is on a mostly even playing field, so if you pull one good piece of tech, you can easy-mode your way to the top. They also give one away as a door prize. You've got the same odds as everyone else.</br>  New information about upcoming episodes when?  <br>Well I'll have to modify my deck to be tourney legal, since I play traditional with my friends. Damn shame since I have Chaos Emperor in there.</br>  <br>Unless your shop is weird, you're only supposed to play with the cards you pull from the Sneak packs. You don't need a deck, and you can't use any cards except for what you get in your packs.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Still though, need a tourney deck.</br>  One of these 5 is not like the others.  <br>The one with the clones, or the one with the D-Wheel as a spirit partner substitute?</br>  <br>It's Yusei, his counterpart isn't even alive.</br>  <br>Stat with Cyborg Ninja Baseball. You can build the whole deck for about $20.</br>  <br>I could just find some cards to replace my forbidden cards, but my BEU deck might not really be the best against modern ones.</br>  <br>You'll get blown out of the water. Power Creep is intense in Yugioh. If you want to see how crazy the game is, ccopy a topping Burning Abyss, Qliphort, Nekroz, Ritual Beast, Tellarknight or Shaddoll build, and play it on DN or YGOPro, even just against the AI. Getting up the speed will really help.<br><br>If you want a real life deck that can scrape some wins, then start with U.A. or Yosenju. They're both very reasonably priced, and can snatch wins from the rest of the meta, just not frequently enough to be Tier-1/2 on their own.<br><br>After you get used to where the game is at, then you can start playing pet-decks, because you'll have a better idea of how to handle common problems.<br><br>I still play Fabled, LV and (occasionally) Aliens, but making them playable now is a ton of work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's his bike tho</br>  <br>No Yubel or crimson dragon?</br>  <br>Yeah, I noticed, I played my friend's Masked Hero tourney deck, he killed me on his second turn.</br>  Based Japan<br>http://www.dlsite.com/maniax/work/=<wbr>/product_id/RJ159607.html</wbr></br>  <br>OTKs used to be a big deal, now they're everywhere, and nobody seems to care. The only thing keeping everybody from rushing OTKs on one-another is the fact that you're expected to stop them, counter them, and OTK on your following turn. Pretty much everyone CAN OTK, but they're still very rare because they're suicidally dangerous.</br>  <br>Ruris are not for lewd.</br>  <br>Well the new pack's Red Eyes support should make a deck more viable. Maybe I'll get a starter deck and modify it. I just don't want to sink in a whole ton of money, and I do still enjoy pulling cards from packs.</br>  <br>It's Judai. All the other characters are with their spirit guides, but Yubel got left out for some reason.</br>  <br>July isn't even over yet dude, you're not getting anything until the 7th at the earliest.</br>  Jack's duel with Yuya<br>Yuya- Pre Red Nova Jack<br>Jack- Post Red Nova Jack</br></br>  <br>Red Scar-Right Nova Dragon with Double Synchro Tuning Summon when?</br>  <br>Sound Duel 4 when</br>  I'm holding my penis in front of my monitor as I post this image.  <br> you will never fuck Yugo and scream BANANA as you cum </br>  <br> you will never rip and tear apart the Ruri's assholes </br>  <br> you will never make love with R  eira </br>  <br>Kuri kuri did more as a helpful spirit guide than Yubel ever did. He's also more marketable than a demonic hermaphrodite.</br>  <br> you will never cuddle with Ruri <br><br>Just banish me to the shadow realm already.</br></br></br>  <br>Well Yubel was never helpful at all, she did want to destroy and rule everything because her childhood crush had long been dead and the reincarnated one had forgotten about her.</br>  <br> you will never rip and tear apart   Y uri's asshole</br>  <br> dat Bloody Tears-like intro </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128787951 <br>I see nothing wrong with this image. Fusion scum should be put in their place.</br>  What actually bothers me the most about Synchro is how the Lancers spend so much time walled off from each other. They have this motley crew of contrasting personalities and egos of varying sizes, but they literally put them in solitary cells away from each other. Even a few of them don't have character motivations that extend that far, like Sawatari, there's potential gold in them simply interacting more. If the Lancers have to keep separate from Yuzu and Yugo for plot reasons, why couldn't those 2 be put in different buildings or floors so the Lancers could still see each other? <br><br>There's still some of what I'm talking about, like with Gon straightmanning for Dennis and Sawatari, and Yuya and Reiji butting heads again next episode. But I'd be a lot more forgiving of whatever other issues Synchro has if they simply did more with all these characters they went through the trouble of establishing and defining. In a previous thread someone said that Jack was like Yuya's Reiji for this arc, but why can't Reiji be his Reiji? There's a lot more there than with some guy Yuya's known for ~15 minutes.<br><br>Sorry if this is blogging</br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely agreed. Fucking filth.</br>  <br>Doujins  soon </br>  <br>Yuya and Reiji are the absolute Yugi and Kaiba clones of the entire series. He may not really be the truest rival for Yuya but he's a definite foil. Sawatari is more in line for being a rival Entertainment Duel wise, they both specialize in it. Jack is for fan service and him sparring with Yuya is because Yuya is a Yusei stand-in. He's probably going to lose to Yuri in someway anyhows.</br>  <br>I want to bully Yuri while Yuto and Shun laugh in the distance. Also, his dragon is horrible.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128787951 <br><br>i also agree, and i would not look at them while im at it after im done i'll just walk out after getting dress and never call the next day.</br></br>  <br>I want to bully Yuri  with my dick. </br>  <br>don't bully the shota</br>  <br>Well that's not what it actually looks like, Yugo's was like that too, it was all glowy white and shit.</br>  <br>Fusion scum most likely have micro dicks. Only superior XYZ Duelists are capable of pleasing their female comrades.  He will never be able to give Ruri the D she deserves. </br>  <br> tfw Yuto will never get all the lewd art he deserves because of   EGAO </br>  <br><br>His hair was made to be pulled and I'm going to pull it.</br></br>  <br>That dragon is pretty lewd.<br> sharp blades and claws <br> long xenomorph head <br> two pronged tail <br>It's a walking death and sex machine. Truly perfect.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I hope you will never get separated again from tomato, Yuzu.  Thanks for the night, though. </br>  Why is Shun so shit? He ruined the whole episode.  Cannot wait until Reiji BTFOs his dad in style during the fusion dimension arc.  <br>Stop posting Sora, we know it's you.</br>  <br>Only after Reiji flips his shit at Reira betraying him for Leo and then Leo whips his ass with D/D/Ds. <br><br>Remember Serena was surprised to see Reiji use them, so it's likely Leo uses them as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Seeing what Reiji says in  could it be that Reiji is training Yuya in facing D/D/Ds because Leo is using them?</br>  <br>Maybe, or he's just fucking with him, whichever. I mean he also did say in their second duel he wasn't even at full strength yet.</br>  <br>I can't wait till everyone shoves Reiji to the ground and just kicks the shit out of him for his terrible plans.</br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br>Reijihaters have no taste</br>  <br>I don't hate him but his plans are awful and he's probably on the edge of going full damage control</br>  <br>The only people that dare defy Reiji are Sawatari and Serena.</br>  <br>Mirror Force dragon wont drop. Look at Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight and Eye of Timaeus</br>  <br> I don't hate him but his plans are awful <br><br>His plans consist of him sitting back and doing nothing for 90% for the time, and later stepping in and claiming everything went according his keikaku.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget it always works in the end.<br><br>I want to know what the fuck he did in Synchro, did he just kick the door to the Council down, push up his glasses, and say keikaku and that was it?</br></br></br>  <br> hey fags your home is gonna get carded we can help. <br> why should we believe you fucking hipster? <br> BECAUSE KEIKAKU THAT'S WHY! </br></br></br>   be head of security <br> working to subjugate the filthy commons <br> every time you try to enact keikaku, your troops either ignore your keikaku, or you get fucked over by your superiors <br> some random strangers suddenly show up, using never before seen summoning mechanics <br> including one guy who won't stop talking about a 'Ruri' while using a deck revolving around carpet-bombing your city <br> try and take them in <br> your superiors insist they be allowed to play in the friendship cup, even ruining your attempts to recapture them <br> you have no way to enact keikaku with the filthy commons and these strange intruders because of your superiors <br>being jean-michel is suffering.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  how things really work in the synchro dimension<br> the king controls nothing <br> the "king" cant change anything <br> King is a empty title <br> the 1% controls everything i.e the corporations do <br> headed by a "council of elders" <br> has an loyal army that takes people away <br> clams that their "friends" with the lower class but its really a sham <br>  force "buy blackwings" to the masses <br>  the only reporter who can do anything is too blind to see the truth <br> the fusion is their ally and they tasked the council to weaken the lancers <br> Reiji really doesnt have a plan. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw I have the same glasses as reiji they're just a little more rounded <br><br>It's time, who wants to join my duel school?</br></br></br>  <br>I think Yugi figured out that the King of Games title is fucking worthless. Only Kaiba, Judai, Jack, and a bunch of idiots give a crap about it.</br>  <br>Too bad Jack isn't a Signer despite Scar-Right technically still being a servant of the Crimson Dragon. Maybe he could've used RDA to punch a hole in the corrupt society of Synchro but MUH KINGU is more important.</br>  <br>Me. XYZ scum here.</br>  <br>Crimson Dragon doesn't exist in Synchro, Clear Wing has taken it's place, it even warps too.</br>  <br>Good, gooood.</br>  you're a resident of the Arc-V world. which dimension do you hail from, which deck do you use, and are there any cards you'd have in your archetype that don't exist yet? how would your boss be improved to fit more as a boss?<br><br> xyz dimension <br> using Inzektors <br> have a RUM to turn Exa-stag into Exa-Beetle <br> Exa-stag gets the full atk bonus from equipping monsters, not just half <br> exa-beetle doesn't need to pitch your own faceup card to pop an opponent's faceup card </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh god, I was listening to the Padme Funeral music from ep. 3 when I opened this, it fits too well.</br>  <br> Fusion  <br> Masked HEROs <br> Dark Law <br> I don't need to fix Dark Law  <br><br>If I could make any deck though, I'd do Standard and a Gundam or Star Wars theme.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HEROes(even masked HEROes) are already used by someone.</br>  <br>Masked Heroes were never in the anime, nor does it matter two shits about Arc-V, Judai doesn't exist.</br>  <br>masked HEROes were in the manga.</br>  <br> Standard <br> Red-Eyes (Jonoichi's wasn't Red-eyes) <br> Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon <br> I think being immune to card effects and inflicting 500 LP of damage every time they activate an effect is enough of a boss </br></br></br></br>  <br>Jack caring about being King was more of a personal thing to him. I think he wanted to be his own King, one that people can look up to and one with good values as a human being. Not the fake Goodwin King shit where he was an asshole that didn't care about his opponents. Him wanting to be the best in the world at Riding Duels at the end of 5D's was him prepping himself to be a true opponent for Yusei somewhere down the line. Also, he's an entertainer like Yuya but with way more of an ego streak. I still don't understand why Jack has the right to trash-talk Yuya's style when ARC-V Jack is pretty much Fortune Cup Jack IE being an asshole who likes to humiliate opponents and stroke his dick. Yusei and Carly not existing fucked his shit up.</br>  <br> Standard Dimension <br> Madolche Deck <br> Madolche Tordiva (Normal summon to special summon a level 4 madolche from deck) <br> Madolche Mocha-Icevoker (Rank 3 2 monsters, literally just madolche flavored flavored MX-Saber Invoker) <br> Madolche Nights and Tea Break negate and destroy instead of bouncing, work with Choco-a-la-mode <br> Choco-a-la-mode's effect works even on CXYZ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know they were, manga is irrelevant.

Yuzu lost to Masumi, Dennis and shat her pants to Yuri.</br>  <br>Judai is the hardest protagonist to beat in tag force special. If he's not fusion summoning via poly he's mask changing</br>  <br>But he could have easily won if he didn't give Crow time to get his shit together, and then there was that time where he depleted his hand just to give Shun, the guy who shits out his hand in one turn, some Pendulum cards.</br>  <br>Yuya has two pretty cool decks he can use right now. Performapals are great for beatdown players and Magicians are insane right now.</br>  <br> But he could have easily won if he didn't give Crow time to get his shit together <br>Seriously, all of you are like a broken record. In the end it doesn't matter if Crow talks about his sob story and Gon attacks regardless or whatever. Gon loses because the writers want him to lose. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br>Such a shame. He and Jaden have new cards I would love to hear them voice those cards.</br>  <br><br>And Crow could would have had no trouble at all if he put his monsters in defense position.<br>What other what if scenarios are we gonna go through?</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya might still have a chance if Pendulum Wizard was anything to go by.</br>  <br>What new cards does Judai have?</br>  <br> But he could have easily won if he didn't give Crow time to get his shit together <br>That happens in every single Action Duels where somebody gets saved by a last minute Action Card<br><br> and then there was that time where he depleted his hand just to give Shun, the guy who shits out his hand in one turn, some Pendulum cards <br> Everybody has to step back so Shun can look cool in Tag Duels <br>That isnt unique to Gon</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Serena will be revealed to have a little brother, screen cap this.<br><br> He will be Sora. And then Serena and Shun will be paired, so will be Sora and Ruri. </br></br></br>  <br> Serena and Shun <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>Try Mieru, she uses Nekroz.</br>  <br> Ruining the sanctity of Ruriraptors with Crowscum faggotry </br>  <br> That happens in every single Action Duels where somebody gets saved by a last minute Action Card <br><br>Except for Sora the first time he dueled Shun, he had no time, it was set the action card and the duel keep going with you knocked out, or get knocked out and lose.</br></br></br>  <br> Sora with a Ruri <br>sick fuck</br></br>  <br><br>Shun and Crow tag duel FUCKING WHEN</br></br>  <br>Hopefully never.</br>  <br>I don't think Shun does tag duels. He prefers to be out numbered.</br>  <br>He used to tag duel.<br><br>Yuto/Shun vs. Ruri/Shun, yes, he had two duel disks and two decks. Whoever won got to pick what they do. <br><br>Ruri/Shun always won so they got to go watch birds in the park. Yuto never did get to play D&amp;D with them.</br></br></br></br></br>  will best girl  make her first appearance?   <br>Actually wait I take that back he has jumped into a lot of battle royales and has jumped in to help his new comrades so technically it's possible.</br>  Is Yuma the MC with more defeats?  Is there a reason why monosubs didn't release ep.65 and proceeded to ep.66?  <br>She already did. <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>He probably forgot thanks to EVO and thinks he's uploaded it and nobody has told him.</br>  <br>I want to impregnate that Ruri!  And take responsibility.  </br>  <br>Don't we all.</br>  <br>His masked hero cards and the six elemental attribute heroes. Sad thing is, the only cards he actually has a line for are Elemental HEROes Flame Wingman and Thunder Giant and the spell card, Skyscraper. No Neos, Yubel, or Winged Kuriboh. As a result you'll only hear basic lines in duels with him compared to the other main characters.</br>  <br>Where do babies come from? Do you have to summon them?</br>  <br>yep</br>  <br>Yes. The professor sets Yuri upon an orphanage and then sometime later, Yuri brings them all back as cards claiming that was how he found them. Then the professor rolls his eyes and activates the cards on his Duel Disk (or maybe it's a coat-disk like what Chronos has), summoning them onto the field of life.<br> yfw it turns out to be true </br></br>  https://twitter.com/yugioh_anime/st<wbr>atus/626595334177751040<br>„ÄêARC-V„Äë The characters of Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V will deliver ‚Äúenthusiastic information‚Äù on the ALTAvision in Shinuku from 10h 17min 15sec on the 31st of July (Friday) on!! The screenings are every hour at 17min 15sec!! (‚ÄªScreening time changes can occur) And if you happen to drop by for a visit in Shinjuku, please by all means check it out<br>Translation from  tumblr. <br><br>So, what are they going to say? Buy more cards?</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br> BUY RAIDRAPTORS </br>  <br>I hope it's more  EGAO </br>  <br> Buy BLACKWINGS </br>  What do you guys think of the New Odd-Eyes cards?  Why doesn't Reiji enter? His previous excuse was that it was a junior youth tourney, now he has no reason not to participate.  <br>Anything with access to Naturia Beast shits on npc Nekroz</br>  <br>Where can I get this alternate artwork? For research purposes of course.</br>  <br>THE FUN HAS JUST BEGUN!<br>WITH THESE NEW BOOSTERS THAT YOU SHOULD BUY!</br></br>  <br>He's far too potent to participate. Since his skill level is so beyond what anyone else could bring, if he were to enter the tournament, the end result would be Neo Domino thinking he's coming to subjugate the masses, especially after de-throning their King.</br>  Does a guide (like the one for Zexal) exist for DM, GX, and 5D's? I'm planning to binge rewatch everything during August but I wouldn't mind skipping a few of the most useless episodes.  <br> <br>http://i.imgur.com/JcqBvIA.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/epr4l2G.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/JEuWpPP.jpg<br/></br></br></br> </br>  <br>I see Nakajima posts here when the Akabas are out.</br>  I bet Reiji is going to recruit Jack by giving him an endless supply of cup ramen. According to keikaku.  <br>Thanks have some Ruris in return.</br>  <br>Would it still be Red Demons Ramen?</br>  <br>Probably</br>  <br>Please be them bringing hype for Yuya vs Yugo by showing Odd Eyes something dragon shadowed just like they did with Odd Rebellion way back when we thought it was some unholy abomination.</br>  So the card Yuya got from that kid is likely a Tuner right? Do you think he'll want it back when he realizes that it's actually a good card?  <br>This. Also, something like "The synchro arc is coming to an end."  That's not happening soon, right? ;_;  </br>  <br>He's not getting it back if it ever turns into a Pendulum. The fact that it's part of Yuya's major archetypes is quite indicative that it won't be leaving Yuya's hands at all.</br>  Watching Zexal II for the first time here. Is Hope Ray Victory the final form of this card or will there be more?  <br>Is it an EM? I didn't see it in the name.</br>  <br>It's a magician, with the same naming scheme as the gazers and the thesis magicians.</br>  <br>You're a funny guy. There's never enough Hopu.</br>  <br>I hope you like dragons.</br>  In Gon vs Crow did we get to see the actual card of Gon's Synchro?  <br>3 more. 2 with Astral's power and 1 with Yuma's</br>  <br>The wikia is a thing, but no, we didn't.</br>  <br><br><br>I do like Dragons.</br></br></br>  <br>So Deskbots?</br>  <br>I dont care what people say, RECONTRACT UNIVERSE and NUMERON FORCE were hype as mother fucking shit</br>  <br>How could it be hype when it's straight-up bullshit?</br>  <br>Deskbots are a pretty decent counter to Nekroz. They can get over monsters without special summoning pretty easily, have Naturia Synchro, and can whip out Infinity pretty consistently.</br>  <br>Stay mad pleb</br>  <br>Rank 4 babbie</br>  Am I going fast enough yet?  <br>Victorys Rank 5 though</br>  <br>Clear Wing Looked like trash with it's silhouette also, it's just a rough concept to tease us with forever.</br>  <br>Reminder they did the silhouette thing with OEPD in the Arc-V trailer.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4H5<wbr>XRk_gE3I</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Wow, you're right.</br></br></br>  I miss the  D R A G O N S  format.  <br>Damn, back then Odd-Eyes looked different, and as if it had wings<br> inb4 this was all a huge foreshadowing and that dragon is actually upgraded Odd-Eyes </br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Interesting. Did Dark Rebellion xyz dragon have one as well? It's been a long time and I mostly forgot about Uto</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If there was no banlist, how would they fare?</br>  <br>Easily T1.</br>  <br>I was going to say Yata Lock, but all cards in your grave is not a bad thing anymore these days.</br>  <br>also, rulers don't give a shit about not having their draw phase when they have card destruction and super rejuvenation.</br>  <br>You'd still need cards in your hand for that, the Yata lock empties your hand and field and prevents you from drawing. It's a dick move.<br>There's also a pretty consistent Exchange of the Spirit FTK, but I forgot how it works.</br></br>  <br>exchange of the spirit doesn't work anymore as an ftk because of the errata.</br>  <br>Well shit. But I'm still pretty sure there would be decks more degenerate than Rulers. Frogs had some bullshit with Mass Driver and I'm pretty sure you could do some shit with Exodia.</br>  <br><br>If there was no banlist the tier 0 decks would be Exchange of spirit, but with the errata thats no longer possible. Exodia ftk would be the tier 0 deck, but Dragons wouldn't be relevant as the entire meta is based around ftk's.</br></br>  <br>oh yeah, without a doubt. but as far as degenerate decks go, yata is pretty low.</br>  Will Arc-V end with Yuzu becoming Yuyas new Dragon card? Or a maiden of Odd Eyes card?  <br><br>Badly, this guy ruins any hope of there of a duel lasting more then 1 turn. The game turns into competitive dice rolling to see who goes first game 1, the duel is more of a formality at that point.</br></br>  <br>So, MTG?</br>  <br>The new errata on old forbidden cards literally made the cards useless.<br>What's even the point of making them legal if they're going to not be used anyway?</br></br>  <br>keeping the banlist short and letting collectors and vintage players use their old retarded cards.</br>  <br> letting collectors and vintage players use their old retarded cards <br>But they're not the old cards, they're watered down versions that have no use in today's decks.<br>You still can't use the originals.</br></br></br>  <br>it's the same reason card of sanctity came out like this.<br><br>animu fags will eat up and use anything shat out for them.</br></br></br>  <br>I want my CED and DMoC back.</br>  <br>Is there somewhere I can see all the changed erratas?</br>  <br>yugioh.wikia.com</br>  <br>You know what I mean you cheeky faggot.<br>There's no list of all changed cards I can find.</br></br>  <br>Ring of Destruction is still good.</br>  <br>look harder.<br>http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Catego<wbr>ry:Card_Errata</wbr></br></br>  <br>Did you even look at what you linked?</br>  <br>yes, because do you realize what constitutes an errata? a fuckton of errata's are just updating PSCT.</br>  <br>That is literally a list of changed cards. I don't think you know what you're looking for or can't write what you mean.</br>  <br>So is that tonight or tomorrow?</br>  <br>Do you have problems understanding I was asking for a list of cards who's erratas were changed recently to make them go from forbidden to legal?</br>  <br>you specifically asked for a list of changed erratas. I gave you a list of changed erratas. don't be a faggot.</br>  <br> What is context? <br>Do you have brain problems?</br></br>  <br>do you fucking know what an errata is?</br>  <br>I don't think even anime fans would use that card for Yugi.dek. They fucked that up badly.</br>  <br> Is there somewhere I can see all the changed erratas? <br> no this is not what I'm looking for, this is a list with all the changed erratas <br>Don't be a Commons and admit you fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think you know what the word errata means.</br>  <br>Tonight, in around 6 hours.</br>  <br> Errata are changes to a card's description or effect wording, usually to make the card rulings easier to understand for the players. On rare occasions, an erratum will correct other things such as ATK or Attribute.  <br>Yes I'm pretty sure I know, the context of the erratas I was asking for were the ones for the cards that were recently taken from forbidden to limited, not for all the cards in the game.<br><br><br>I suggest you learn what context is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the anime twitter is reporting on it does that mean there will be an anime preview of what's to come?</br>  <br>even in context, that page has all the errata'd cards with changed effects, so I really don't know what you were looking for.</br>  <br> needing to look up errata on the wiki to learn what it means <br>KEK.</br></br>    power is "he can't die" <br><br>So just a typical One Piece character, huh?<br><br>Did he really think concrete would kill him? Motherfuckers go through solid walls all the time in this series.</br></br></br></br>  Hey, what if Kaido is from the same race/family as Oars and Oars Jr (we've pointed out physical similarities and shit) and this is Oda's pun magic at work because the Japanese say the "Oars" name like "Oz"<br><br>Kaido/Oar's species-family/Oz<br>Kidd/Tin Man<br>Apoo/Roar of the Sea/Cowardly Lion<br>Hawkins/Scarecrow<br><br>All that's left is Bonny/Dorothy and maybe a dog. And the enemies will be wicked witch Big Mom or some shit I don't know So there you go: the Oz Alliance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> oni oni theory <br>thats not a landwhale<br>this is a landwhale</br></br></br>  <br> tumblr cunt <br>You triggered me, now I won't feel well unless I post my newest gay pictures.</br></br>   oni island <br><br>look familiar?</br></br>  <br>Did you hacked a tumblr user to find one of her personal pics?</br>  RIP in peace Marika  Oh hey, this subplot still exists.

They had no choice but to kill her.<br><br>The real shame is that Kosaki is going to die a foreveralone permavirgin and she doesn't even know it yet.</br></br>  <br>She's masturbating, right?</br>  What do Fanbooks even inside?  <br>Aaaaand another one out.<br>[x] Yui<br>[x] Marika<br>[ ] Kosaki<br>[ ] Chitoge</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ÊÑõ„Å´Êø°„Çå <br>Lewd.</br></br>    <br>Did that bitch poison her?</br>  I managed to drop this, finally.<br>First, we know who's going to win (from the start).<br>Second, winning is losing because raku a shit.<br>But (third), losing is losing because I feel bad for marika losing (a bit too for the others).<br>Fourth, ruri and sunohara is a terrible consolation prize because I dislike shoe (I'm alone in this, probably).<br><br>That said, it's sad seeing Marika carry on with her one sided love doomed to fail. She should get her own spin off and find a good man.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  well she knows (thinks?) that Raku loves Onodera? Every other character has already understood that he loves Chitoge, even Yui nee and Shuu LOL  <br> I managed to drop this, finally. </br>  <br>But noooo, shitsaki had her own spin-off. <br><br>Marika is too good for this shitshow, I see at daily basis /a/ bitching about how the indecisive osananjimi loses to new bitch because she didn't had the guts to confess first, and when a straightforward like Matika appears everyone calls her a creep. <br><br>Fuck that shit.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Every other character has already understood that he loves Chitoge <br>Except Raku. And Chitoge.</br></br>  It's like on Baka-Test, best girl never wins.  <br>Shittoge is not bad, is just that everyone is better  except for Onodera she is Haruna Sairenji tier of shittiness.  </br>   Marika is kill <br>Komi doesn't have the guts.</br>  <br> it was all a lie <br> again </br></br>  <br>WAX<br>THAT<br>ASS</br></br></br>  <br>  Marika is killed <br>  subplot that goes SOMEWHERE <br>Im tired of this bait to make people still caring about this shit</br></br></br>  <br>See you next week!</br>   mfw this animated in january <br>Who will voice Yui?</br>  <br>Not this time anon, i've finally dropped this shit, i only come here to have a summary of the chapter</br>  <br>Marika either win or die. The former is never happening.</br>  <br> dropped <br> still cares about summary </br></br>    <br>This is like KNIM all over again, you can't drop it no matter how hard you try, you can only find rest on death.</br>  So what exactly is a post-evangelion biter?  you're favorite anime  <br>Forced pandering.</br>  People who only watch mature anime for mature anime viewers such as themselves.  No idea but Kirino best girl.  <br>Kirino best girl when paired with Kyousuke. <br> I guess she's insulting them because they didn't like anime before eva? Like people who shit on old anime. </br></br>  <br>That sounds more descriptive of Kirino than Kusoneko, though.</br>  <br>But why is she so perfect, /a/?</br>  <br>Why? Kirino likes anime with cute girls so probably mahou shoujo and SoL. She's more into VNs anyway. Maybe she said that because Kuroneko is into overly deep anime and people consider Eva really deep.</br>  <br><br>2nd best girl mentioned Evangelion and I missed it, damn.</br></br>   little kids calling each other out for being newfags and casuals <br>she would fit right in on /a/</br>  <br><br> implying she isn't already shitposting anonymously </br></br>  <br> uses buzzwords  <br> comes over as pretentious <br> other person calls her out for liking moeshit, while also coming over as pretentious  <br>Wow it's like I'm on /a/</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Kirino the type of girl to shitpost?</br>  <br>Weird, I know. It's almost like it was intentionally designed to mimic the typical anime fans' "discussion" or something.</br>  <br><br>imagine her going rampant in a Maschera thread or if someone insults Meruru</br></br>  <br>I think Neko's taste in anime is shit.</br>  <br><br>she's a teenage girl, what do you expect? magical girls are even worse</br></br>  <br>Idunno; from what we see of it her favorite show looks like it has some nice atmosphere.</br>   biter <br><br>Context check.</br></br>   Mods keep deleting imouto threads <br>Hell, the last one only had a little blogshit, so what the fuck</br>  <br>The one yesterday was really blog heavy.</br>  <br>There was only one blogshitter by the time i left, and people were yelling at him.

They don't bother learning about gods or magic. Essentially they just want to go in and mine shit like complete morons. You could teach electromagnetism to a mage and have rail gun snipers fucking up japs.</br>  <br>Wait, so he used the flat end of a fucking bullet as a hammer? And they are sure he wasn't purposefully injuring himself to get out and get paid?</br>  <br><br> He said he didn't have the shoulders to take on his philosophical works, ever.  And that even if he was wrong so often, he actually thought about so much shit it's impressive </br></br>  How can someone be so delusional?<br>Is it like a form of PTSD?</br>  Since she mentally can't handle the situation she's in, her brain makes up one that she can handle.  <br>There was no breaking of her mind in the flashback. It looked more like she fluently went from "everything's nice and normal" to "everything's nice and normal".<br>So yes, you could try to explain her psyche that way, but the way is depicted is simply wrong.</br></br>  <br> How can someone be so delusional? <br>Where do you think you are?</br></br>  <br>The qualities that she shows are all positive schizophrenic symptoms. She most likely has a form of undifferentiated-type schizophrenia, and the symptoms were triggered by a traumatic event that occurred at some point after the apocalypse started.</br>  <br>It'll probably come up later in the anime but in the manga   she's all depressed for a few days, but then Megu-nee tells her she should form a club, and that's when she goes delusional.  <br>  Megu-nee even says that she's the reason 'her time stopped'  </br></br>  I think this may have ruined one of my fetishes.
