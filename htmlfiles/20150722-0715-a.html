Gilgamesh<br>2. Herakles<br>3. Arturia<br>4. Cu Chulainn <br>5. Lancelot<br>6. Medusa<br>7. EMIYA<br>8. Iskander<br>9. Medea<br>10. Diarmuid<br>11. Gilles<br>12. True Assassin<br>13. False Assassin<br>14. Zero Assassin<br><br>Note that:<br>- Compatibility and certain circumstances mean that theoretically any matchup can go either way, this ranking just indicates raw power. For example, EMIYA gets trounced by Herakles but under optimal conditions is able to kill Gilgamesh.<br>- Positions 4&amp;5, 6&amp;7, and 11&amp;12 are arguably swappable and the relevant pairs should be considered relatively close in power - though due to compatibility, once again, directly contrasting them in a fight is difficult.<br><br><br> Guarenteed replies </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, bullshit, but because belief matters in nasu land the heroic spirits get boosted because of that. It's the only sane interpretation.</br>  <br>Has anyone ever picked up who the mentioned "only one hero from the last century was produced"<br><br>Curious as to who it was.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad if you try that nowadays it won't work, the Nanaya's were at it for thousands of years.<br> you will never see Shiki's actual blood sister </br></br>  <br>Dude that doesn't indicate that your fan fiction is right. Have you read NLBW? He uses reinforcement to match Berserker.</br>  <br>0. Shirou</br>  <br> no archer herc <br><br>Also you know, odds are none berserker herc is just the best overall in every way. He'd probably just break Enkidu if he could actually use his strength intelligently.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah.<br>1.Archer<br>99999999999999. Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>Archer or Saber Herc would have been based as fuck</br>    unlike every other hero <br>What? Every hero was hardworking as fuck</br>  <br>Oi dun bash muh superhero</br>  <br>Probably Hitler.</br>  <br>It still pisses me off that Saber at her strongest only ever really had a proper fight versus False Assassin.<br><br>Even Dark Saber got better fights, but she had shit agility and instinct and mostly just beamspammed and swang Excaliber wildly as a result</br></br></br>  <br> Alexander under EMIYA </br>  <br>Hitler.</br>  <br>Could have been Nixon.</br>  People completely miss the fucking point that Archer attained that strength through hard work and utilizing his power at it's limits. Not because of some stupid contract with Alaya that was a one time thing and he wasn't even himself there.  <br>In HF he got Archer arm which boosted his power. Nowhere it say that he could pull that out without it</br>  <br>Its hitler</br>  <br>As much as people argue about this ranking, I find it pretty fucking accurate. Only ones I'd definitely switch are TA and Bluebeard, but that's even mentioned in the note.</br>  <br>Where was that mentioned?</br>  <br>Switch Lancelot with Cu and we are golden.</br>  <br><br><br>Class? NP?</br></br></br>  <br>In HF Archer's arm broke and he reinforced it to keep up. Archer's fully trained arm is obviously fucking better than his shitty human arm. Nothing ever states that the strength he has is because of Alaya.</br>  <br> Implying EMIYA wouldn't win 9/10 versus Iskander </br>  <br><br>The arm even glows as in reinforced like the UBW anime showed.</br></br>  Who was a bigger monster, Adolf Hitler or Alexander the Great?  <br>For a non-joke answer it'd have to be someone considered a legend for their combat prowess and skill.<br><br>So my money is on Bruce Lee.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't explicitly remember, to be honest. But I'm pretty sure it was mentioned in-game (be it Extra or /stay night).</br>  <br>Perhaps some occult guy as Caster</br>  <br>Classes? NP?</br>  <br>That's Day 9 A Story of a Knight.<br> "Let me make a contract. I shall give you my life after my death. I would like the compensation now." <br><br> He weaves the words of contract. <br> After that, he changed as though possessed by something and saved people who could not normally be saved. <br> …Oh, so this must be how he became a "heroic spirit". <br>That part was unclear as Shirou got superpower and did stuffs he couldn't before, for example when someone's near death he could possibly outrun a wolf. In this case it's more like Rin was guessing what happened to Shirou.<br>Also if that was an one-time only then Shirou would have died faster, the powerup lasted until his death and followed him when he became CG, otherwise he wouldn't make more miracles.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aleister Crowley.<br>Caster.</br></br>  <br>Class? Probably Assassin, I can't think of any weapons he's strongly associated with.<br><br>NP? Probably some technique or trait of his body, like the Hassan's/Extra Assassin get.</br></br></br>  <br> Indeed. It is amazing that you jumped from that height without using any magic. Are you suicidal? The two stare at me. <br> Setting Ilya aside for the moment, Kotomine's comment makes me forget about the pain. <br> Shut up! I had to do it because you jumped! I don't want to do this ever again! You'd normally break your leg, and I almost fainted right when I started the jump! <br> But you have no injuries. You have no right to complain… But it is certainly a surprise. Why did you even consider jumping from that height? <br> Even a magus would not think about jumping from that height without using a spell." <br> Well, I was left behind, and since Kotomine jumped with Ilya, I thought I'd look bad if I didn't do it too <br> It's not Shirou's fault. Archer's influencing his mind as well as his body. <br> That's why his body's so tough. He thought he could handle that drop the way Archer could. <br> …Eh? What does that mean, Ilya? <br> I see, that is reliable. Please demonstrate that strong attitude during battles. Here's your sword. He throws me the sword I left here. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So did they ever go into detail on how one even makes a contract with the world?<br><br>Is it common knowledge? Can any old jackass do it? Like just say I'll sell my soul and satan shows up to collect?<br><br>Or is it the world showing up to him and offering? Like it saw potential in him and wanted a new counter guardian.</br></br></br></br>  <br> birth of a hero <br> how he became a "heroic spirit". <br>You do know this is basically explaining that he became a counter guardian after the contract which is what he became. The power up was only for that scene for those people that's why he is only possessed there.<br><br><br> Shirou would have died faster <br>Citation.<br> the powerup lasted until his death and followed him when he became CG <br>Citation.<br><br>This fanfiction has overstayed it's welcome. Even UBW anime Shirou proves it wrong, it's never made clear and Saber even hints that Shirou will become as strong as Archer if he trains.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't believe its ever clarified.<br><br>I personally think its probably an offer Alaya makes to those who are strong enough when they're begging for a miracle, though. You can't choose to accept the contract unless she chooses you first.</br></br></br>  <br>You need to be strong that's why Alaya grants a contract to Saber and Emiya. At least that's what is implied.</br>  <br> Counter Force <br> 抑止力 - Yokushiryoku <br><br> Of course, since it's just formless power, it can't just appear out of nowhere and curse somebody to death. It usually has to act through agents. Most often, a "normal person" will be pushed by the Counter Forces into wiping out that factor of destruction. These generally are the rare sort of "receptors" among humans that can function as a medium for the Counter Force to live in. In these cases, the person may suddenly change in personality, as if possessed by some other force. The person will be given enough power to eliminate the target, but nothing more. The result: that person will be treated like a hero. The human that becomes a hero by the Counter Force will be incorporated in Alaya after death. It's an even deal. In return for fame and glory, that hero has to perform servitude for the power that invested in him. This would be the pact that a person makes with the world. </br></br></br></br>  <br>What doesn't make clear is it never stated if he lost the powerup or not, all you got is just Rin seeing and guessing what happened to Shirou and considering this is Nasu he would make it more shit to cover his plot holes.<br> fanfiction <br>The entire UBW is already fanfic tier with tons of plot armor</br></br></br>  What was it about fate/stay night that made it as memorable and remembered fondly after all these years?  <br>As much as I am impartial about that topic, I'd say Saber.</br>  <br>The translated porn.</br>  Hey, /a/...  <br>Saber.<br>To a less extent Archer and Rin.</br></br>  <br>Saber literally telling Shirou that he can reach his strength and swordsmanship if he trains. I mean holy shit Nasu wrote Saber telling him that, this is Nasu talking.<br><br> all you got is just Rin seeing and guessing <br>Just fucking stop, nothing validates your fanfiction. Rin guessing? She is Nasu's mouthpiece for shit dumbass.<br><br>When you have two heroines saying something that completely contradicts your shitty fanfiction then all you have is just some shitty fanfiction.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anti-archers don't say he's weak. They say he's a bullshit asshole and is shitty.<br>His superpower is "shonen protagonist." It doesn't mean he won't win his fights. It means he's a terrible person and boring. He lucked into magic powers that make him OP, and earned nothing of his story. So we get he's "determined" and that somehow means he's working, even though "determined" is mostly told not actually shown.<br> but we see him get fucked up, he's injured! <br>bullshit. superficial wounds. He doesn't spend years in physical therapy trying to recover from these injuries when the battle is over. He didn't play through the pain. There simply was no serious pain.<br><br>Told not shown is a recurring thing. We don't see what he actually does to become a Heroic Spirit. Just "he does something in the future." We're told "tracing is hard work, that's why his hair turns white" but that's just what we're told, but it appears effortless as he does it and there are no real consequences to that "work."<br><br>He lucked into the power to have all powers, born different and better, a secret to everyone. <br><br>And that's why he's king of the chuunis.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B-but anon, that's bait of babylon.</br>    <br>Remember that chuunis are loved by most, anon. And for a reason.</br>  <br> Being nearly cut in half is a superficial wound </br>    <br>Thanks for sharing, I love it.</br>  <br>Archer lucked into his Reality Marble, but 90% of his fights he uses his own powers, his swordsmanship he developed himself for Kanshou and Bakuya, and his archery, which he honed over years and years.<br><br>All his projections and copy amount to very little.<br>They are more helpful to Shirou then Archer.<br><br>The most useful things his RM gives him are NP's that he in turns alters to fit his own needs by turning them into BP arrows.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if he's up walking around the next day and received no medical attention? yeah. Yeah it is.</br>  <br>Why are the Tsukihime girls so superior to the Fate whores?</br>  <br> possessed <br> as if possessed <br><br>That's them saying he had this new energy and drive that he didn't have before.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Archer either got his power from the contract or as a benefit of becoming a Heroic Spirit. Even a freak like Kotomine can only get to slight superhuman level. No way in hell Shirou surpasses that like five times on his own.</br>  <br>I'm guessing either archer(due to him being a soldier during wwi and this is accustomed to find) or Berserker(due to accounts of his instability towards end of war)<br><br>His NP may be related to his charismatic nature abd oratory skills, something like he's able to mentally manipulate those who hear him to do a command, like mental suggestion, though this may be offsetted by him being a weaker servant(due to him being an average soldier with no outstanding feats and his eye sight is degraded due to mustard gas).</br></br></br>    <br>That's the same for every other servant though, none of them have to spend years in physical therapy. After being cut in half he spends the rest of the war healing and being unable to fight, then he dies to berserker.<br><br>Saber gets badly injured in her fight with berserker but she's fine to move around the next day. She gets stabbed by gae bolg and proceeds to go cut archer in half/get stopped by shirou. <br>Caster gets fucked up by caladbolg but is perfectly fine to move around a few moments after</br></br></br></br>  <br> Saber literally telling Shirou that he can reach his strength and swordsmanship if he trains. I mean holy shit Nasu wrote Saber telling him that, this is Nasu talking. <br><br> Day 6 Faker Fall down your mind <br> "Humph. What are you saying? His technique is nothing. He couldn't kill me even when he attacked me by surprise. How can he call himself a Servant like that?" <br> "It is because you have talent as well, Shirou. You should be able to be as good as Archer if you train for a long time." <br> …Anyway, it seems Saber approves of Archer's technique. <br> "Saber. You said I have talent, right?" <br> "Yes. You will be a good fighter if you train for a long time." <br> No mention of strength, speed, stamina, durability <br> Only skill and technique </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer didn't share a scene with Ilya</br>  <br> You should be able to be as good as Archer if you train for a long time. <br> "Yes. You will be a good fighter if you train for a long time. <br><br>Wow thanks you proved yourself wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm still surprised that Nasu and his friend came up with this story in such a young age. Despite the problems fate/stay night has it has a fascinating world filled to the brim with interesting lore and memorable characters. I just wish there was a more official continuation of this universe in a bigger form instead of books and such. I know Nasu is probably done with fate but I hope some project that continues in the universe in some fashion happens again. There is a lot of side stories the explore it but I'd like for it to be something bigger like expanding on Rin and Waiver going back to Fuyuki 10 years later or something.</br>  <br>No mention of strength, all Saber said is related to fighting style aka skill and technique.</br>  <br>but lancer always killed themselves before doing anything significant</br>  <br>"It is not arousing with her armour."<br>"If she is an untainted virgin, she should be in pure white when she falls."<br>"Lovely toy".<br>"Then she should make her into a virgin that drowns in pleasure."</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, learn to read. Shirou asks him why Archer being a servant and all that shit couldn't beat him which she responds that he is good too and might reach him with training.<br><br>Why are you so desperate to validate that dumb fanfiction that has no citation backing it?</br></br></br>  <br>the only OP archer here is golden boy. You know EMIYA is just better than he looks and he is no where near OP level</br>  <br>Does it in less than two weeks</br>  <br>Bazett beat Archer in Ataraxia as well, just not on screen.</br>    <br> unlike every other hero <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>Doesn't she show up to find him dead?</br>  <br> Why are you so desperate to validate that dumb fanfiction that has no citation backing it? <br>More like we don't have info on what happened to Archer after that fiasco, did he keep that power or not, what is the meaning of 'possessed', did Alaya possessed him or it's a metaphor of getting powerup and did what he couldn't before. And give me citation where Saber said Shirou could reach Archer as Servant strength, speed and stamina, that dialogue when he asked her to train him is all about skill and technique, otherwise she would advise him to push up or some other shit besides getting beaten by her.<br>I find it how funny for Shirou continued to blab about 'risk of dead' yet he fucking inserted iron rod into his back for fucking 7-8 years and didn't die. <br>Yeah and Kerry gave him fucking Avalon while other children became food for Gil, did Shirou do something to earn it? By ignoring everyone he got it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We know there have been multiple heroes in the early parts of the 1900's, but its like the very early parts of it.<br><br>Li Shuwen for example.</br></br></br>  <br>This, so much this.</br>  <br>Guy died in the 1930's or 40's even</br>  Who would win in a close quarters fight: 4th Lancer or 5th Archer?  <br>Shirou is basically a human that reached the level of Heroic Spirits only with training and perseverance.<br><br>He isn't an Age of Gods bullshit power-up, the son of a God, a King nor anything.<br><br>HE IS JUST A FUCKING HUMAN BEING THAT TRAINED HARD AS FUCK TO ACHIEVE HIS GOAL.<br><br>And he can even clean the house and cook, goddamn.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Kotomine standing in front of the grail in the final of Heaven's Feel  </br>  <br>There is no way in hell Shirou would ever reach that level of strength on his own. He's not going to gain twenty times the strength and thirty times the speed he possesses in a little over a decade. He's base human in ability, and even with Archer's arm can barely keep up with old Kotomine who is far from Servant level.</br>  <br>With stats like this</br>  <br>So close but so far.</br>  <br>You could say the same and more about Li Shuwen<br><br>No blessings, he just created a technique that broke reality and several other skills through nothing but effort.<br><br>Shirou isn't as special as you think if you think he's the one that was normal but trained up to battle legends, and that's his game. There are probably a handful of servants like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't Fate/Extra have an Archer that didn't even make the contract? Is he weak there?<br><br>Archer stats are shit anyways, him being able to reach that with reinforcement+training isn't farfetched. Especially when Rin with reinforcement alone was able to beat Caster.<br><br> And give me citation where Saber said Shirou could reach Archer as Servant strength <br>It's right there, why do you keep asking for something so specific. Like the only way for you to accept something heavily implied is for it to be spelled out.<br> otherwise she would advise him to push up or some other shit besides getting beaten by her. <br>Shirou already trains his body.<br><br>Next you are going to tell me that Kirei can run that fast because he made a contract with Alaya.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> unlike every other hero <br>Wut?</br></br>  <br>Archer in Extra managed to become a proper heroic spirit it seems.<br><br>His CG activities are still noted in the data book. Nasu is playing loose how this all fits together, but in one interpretation he made a contract with the Mooncell rather than Alaya here.</br></br></br>  <br> Doesn't Fate/Extra have an Archer that didn't even make the contract? <br>He did, just with Mooncell not Alaya</br></br>  What the fuck is Shiki Tohno's problem?  <br> Alexander that low <br><br>Lancelot should not be placed that high. He is just a soft counter to Gil (and Saber, due to history), but against most others he's weak as shit. Iskander had thousands of Servants (although not necessarily A rank) in his Reality Marble, and could overwhelm most single servants. <br><br>Lancelot vs Alexander is Alexander, Alexander vs Arturia is a draw (probably). The only two above him that would be trouble are Medusa (who can just freeze his army) or EMIYA (which is unknowable, since both need their Reality Marble to win, and that depends on who has a stronger will.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There is no way in hell Shirou would ever reach that level of strength on his own. <br>You do know he is a mage and has a body made of swords right? His projections boost his strength too.<br><br>Did Kirei make a contract with Alaya too?</br></br></br></br>    <br> Taiga: Is it correct to say that Moon Cell Servants aren't summoned from the counter force, but are instead reproduced copies like NPCs? <br> Sakura: Yes, that's right. To be more precise, they are perfectly reproduced from the Moon Cell's records of human history. However, that human history is connected to the throne of heroes in multiple ways, so they can't be called copies as a rule. In short, the Moon Cell consciously creates its own history of humanity, but that history is the exact same as the throne of heroes, so it's like they overlap in multiple ways as the same existences. <br> Taiga: While we're at it, the counter force is a different thing altogether. Archer-san is a counter force heroic spirit, but Archer-san in EXTRA was summoned from the throne of heroes, so he's not a slave of the counter force this time. <br> Caster: I see, so the reason he has a few differences from the original Fate is also because of that state. </br></br></br></br>  <br>When does Shirou become Luvia's butler?</br>  <br>EMIYA SHIROU PLEASES YOUNG FINNS FOR MONEY.</br>  <br>Yet in his Extra material bio page it still mentions he's a guardian<br><br> Cool-headedness and also cynical, nevertheless he is a butler-based Servant that has a habit of caring. The source of this Heroic Spirit differs to others, it can not be said that this Heroic Spirit is legitimate. <br>This Heroic Spirit is intended to be call the path of guardian, something like a defense system created by humanity's "ought to survive" unconsciousness.<br><br> "If the harm to accelerate the destruction of the humanity appeared, I will erase all of the elements to establish this" that is Guardian appeared purpose, to do the job. <br><br> To see why this Heroic Spirit may or become part of the guardian, see this in EXTRA volume. <br><br>and<br><br> While many people prate about the justice and equality, he actually went out of his way to be an "Ally of Justice", often at the expense of his own freedom. When faced with a potential disaster that was beyond his power to prevent, he willingly sold his soul to the Moon Cell in return for a miracle. Now, instead of playing the part of the hero, he willing plays that of a Servant instead. <br><br> As for the human he once was, no traces of that person exist. Instead, he is now the personification of what most people would imagine one who holds the title of "Ally of Justice" to be.  <br><br>Its like he's trying to have it both ways, even when the information conflicts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was chosed by god, what else does she need?</br>  <br>Chris Kyle<br>The Strongest Sniper.<br><br> actually a self-aggrandizing faggot, but he'd fit right in with Gil. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If Shirou can get Servant stats with reinforcement then Ciel should have A++ stats</br>  <br>Represents repressed gaijin hate.</br>  <br> It's right there, why do you keep asking for something so specific. Like the only way for you to accept something heavily implied is for it to be spelled out. <br>Yes it is, because this is Nasu who gave you a bunch of rules to memorize then threw them away, without FHA we would never see Gae Bolg actually killed someone with its curse, then Shirou telling me Berserker had mountain breaking swings yet he had trouble with fucking gravestone, then Gil used no fucking armor despite being shit at melee and used it in Fate against both Shirou and Saber, then Kojirou got triple slashes with pure skills, then Archer lasted longer than Gil, Nasu made tons of those in his own story so unless you want me to take his shit give me specific citation.<br> Shirou already trains his body. <br>Is that enough to fight Archer without skill stealing? No, did he have 6 pack like Archer yet? No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought they go around fucking up Dead Apostles and Fallen Ancestors and so on?</br>  <br>Neither of those mean anything. He's not constantly walking around all swordy. That would kill him. He's also not constantly using strengthening on himself, or would any boost from projections count as his parameters (else he would be like Enkidu with widely variable stats).</br>  <br>Bajiquan is a hell of a drug.</br>  So if I had the grail, would I be able to summon bruce lee?  <br>Watery tarts, scimitars, etc.</br>  <br> Neither of those mean anything. He's not constantly walking around all swordy. <br>Yeah that's why Rider couldn't kill him immediately in fate. It does mean everything and it does apply. Humans in the Nasuverse always seem to break what humans are supposed to do.</br></br>  <br> So if I had the grail, would I be able to summon bruce lee? <br><br>If you had the grail you wouldn't need to summon Bruce Lee. You've already won.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt anyone alive anywhere near the information age could get the required recognition.</br>  <br>Saber was predestined via prophecy to become king.</br>  <br> Servant stats with reinforcement <br>More like shitty servant stats</br></br>  <br>Which kills him if it goes slightly wrong. That's also a result of Avalon healing him. He wouldn't swordify otherwise (short of UBW invading him like in HF).</br>   Gilgamesh set up to be the most powerful <br> kills assassin <br><br>Sounds about right</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I could be paid to please Luvia.</br>  <br>Twenty times is still twenty times. Even Caster's 100x better reinforcement can only give E-rank.</br>  So, if Archer is the Red Man<br>Why don't we call Gilgamesh Ubisoft.</br>  <br> That's also a result of Avalon healing him. <br>The swording in Fate has nothing to do with Avalon.<br>UBW invaded him in HF because Archer world's is different from his and it made it go haywire.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish luvia would pay to please me.</br>  <br>But how can I win if I don't have brucee lee. a cute female version of bruce lee.</br>  <br>So you rather jump to some shitty fanfiction that has literally no citation. Fine by me, keep being wrong.</br>  <br>Swordifying is the result of weird self-healing to mend wounds. The only way he can mend wounds that quickly is through Avalon.</br>  <br> Even Caster's 100x better reinforcement can only give E-rank. <br>Citation.</br></br>  <br>Good point.

Aside from his fists being strengthened by Caster, are the rest his own strength, or did Caster strengthen other parts of his body as well? &lt;Soujuurou of the Hill&gt;<br>Nasu: In the anime version, his entire body is strengthened. When the excessively worrying Caster buffed him to ten times that of a normal human, since Kuzuki's base strength is higher than a normal human, he became even more ridiculous, and did the unthinkable during his fight with Saber. Caster was surprised herself: "What the? Isn't my Master a little too strong?!"<br>Takeuchi: On a side note, it was also thanks to Caster's help that Kuzuki was able to move inside to Rider barrier.</br></br></br>  <br> Swordifying is the result of weird self-healing to mend wounds. <br>No, that's UBW protecting him. Avalon just heals him fast nothing with swords.</br></br>  <br>So it's not E ranked. The stronger the base is the stronger the reinforcement is. Check Archer's strength it's just D.</br>  <br>  At that time, Shirou’s self-healing had already begun, but the nature of his regeneration was really quite indirect, “changing his muscles into blades in order to knit his wounds with swords.” That is actually what happened, regardless of what you saw during the scene in Saber’s route where Gilgamesh dealt him a mortal wound and Shirou appeared to have “masses of blades shaped like muscle fibers” in his body. So, Shirou’s innards are extremely durable. During the fight with Rider, she was able to injure Shirou with her stakes but it would have been more difficult and troublesome to fatally wound him, so she decided to kick him out the window instead.  <br><br> Shirou gets hurt <br> Avalon heals him <br> His self healing is fucked up <br> Swords </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? No, it's ten times + Kuzuki being freakish = stronger than ten times. And that is Caster's reinforcement, which like everything about her magic is way better than conventional magic.</br>  <br>Yet its noted like getting 10x is really a marvel in the interviews, like that's her really giving him a lot and showing her skill.<br><br>If anyone could reach that level with strengthening then servants wouldn't be as tough. Turns out reinforcement is typically pretty weak stuff, you'd probably be lucky to normally get 2x.<br><br>Though no one ever said that Medea's buffs were godly in canon, people just assumed that to rationlize how a guy could beat Saber or whatever. She's someone skilled in most magics, so one could say she can do it quite well for sure, but in the story itself it was never said she's the best buffer ever or anything even close to that. You can realize when its the fans and when its the series.<br><br>Andersen might be better since he can buff a True Demon level being to be even stronger on the fly in battle.

Like Ilya being a better magus than Rin, minus sign means that a stat is a lesser version of that stat which is closer to the previous letter grade in some ways, Sakura would have stopped Shinji if she knew about blood fort in the school, and how Rider's conceptual barrier works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why couldn't Archer defeat Berserker?  <br>Your quote has nothing saying that Avalon does that.</br>  <br>Yeah but Shirou base was completely average for the human. I would understand if we're talking about Shiki but Shirou workout hard every day and didn't get far</br>  <br>Because he's a piece of shit just like all Fate characters</br>  <br>because bersercar inserted enough tokens to get 12 lives</br>  <br>No matter how many straight years we go over this question, few times a year ever since 06, it never seems to sink in much.<br><br>Its not that he couldn't, its just very unlikely.<br><br>Berserker has to hit Archer once to crippled him and win, Archer has to score twelve death blows, while charging up BP, and dodging someone far faster than himself to win. Used to I could go more in depth on this, but that's basically how it works.<br><br>Its far more likely Archer will die before winning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wouldn't this mean Li Shuwen is superior to Shirou by miles? I mean Shirou is a magus, that authomatically makes him stronger than normal humans. While Li Shuwen is just a martial artist.</br></br>  <br>What heals him is Avalon. Shirou does not have regeneration like Saber. That's the whole plot point of Fate.</br>  <br>He also hated Tatari, and photographs.</br>  <br>Why can Shirou defeat Berserker without a sweat?</br>  <br>Are you even reading the damn shit you post?<br> since Kuzuki's base strength is higher than a normal human, he became even more ridiculous <br><br><br> If anyone <br>Shirou is not anyone he is the damn MC.<br> Turns out reinforcement is typically pretty weak stuff <br>Like where is this said?<br><br>This fanbase is truly autistic for taking some literal fanfiction as more factual than shit implied in the damn novel just because it doesn't fit head canons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer is the most tactical Heroic Spirit, though?</br>  <br>That Berserker had been flayed and blinded by the Shadow and even then it would had killed him if Illya hadn't been there.</br>  <br>no he can't<br>unless you're talking about HF's black berserker, that thing is a piece of shit and Shirou almost dies by removing the shroud from his arm</br></br>  <br>Swords are a type of self healing, when even Avalon was having trouble patching him up when he was cut in half by Gilgamesh, it was his swords that started stitching him back together.<br><br>They are his body's natural defense; they protected him from Rider, they protected him against Archer, they are always inside of him protecting and healing him in a haphazard and sometimes much more dangerous than helpful way.<br><br>Typically they disappear once the job is done, but in HF they kept thinking "We're under attack, keep throwing more swords out, we'll help" and his body kept getting fucked up by it. Its like if someones origin was bees, so anyone he was cut bees rushed out of the wounds and attacked people, including himself at times.<br><br>Normally bee or sword healing does help depending on the situation, but it can just as easily kill him at times, like in one Fate route ending when he fell off the school and his internal swords panicked.<br><br>They always stitch him back together when he's broken. When he was cut in half he notes the swords are in his worlds trying to link together, rather than it just being Avalon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said he had her regen. Just that swording is his thing his defense.</br>  <br>Wrong Archer</br>  <br>I wish I could pay Luvia to please her.</br>  <br> that thing is a piece of shit <br><br>It was still Berserker, and it was still seconds away from killing Shirou even when blind and without skin if not for Heracles seeing Ilya in that moment and holding back his last strike.<br><br>Even with his power brought down that much he was still about to kill Shirou without fail.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah but Shirou base was completely average for the human. <br>No he has talent directly said from Saber. He is still a kid he grows a whole lot later in life which greatly improves him.</br></br>  Why couldn't Berserker beat Gilgamesh?  <br>Caster boosts him ten times, and because he's stronger than a normal human, he's more ridiculous than if he was just a regular human. Nothing shocking there. And Shirou is not stronger than a regular human and shows no potential to be stronger than one despite all his daily training, so that doesn't apply to him anyway.</br>  <br>Because he was protecting ilya</br>  <br>Wrong Berserker, I meant this guy.</br>  <br>One man cannot fight against war itself, unless he's an entire battalion as well.<br><br>As Shirou notes in UBW when talking about why other heroes can't beat Gil.</br></br></br>  <br> Pay luvia <br>She doesn't need your money. You're better off going to rin to do that.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Self made man, earned his powers through hard work unlike every other hero <br>Origin was turned into swords because dad put legendary sheath inside him, allowing UBW to exist.<br>Dad bequeathed a lot of money so instead of thinking about exams or eking out a living working a lot instead, uses a lot of free time to hone one's body.<br>Dad left a fucking summoning circle in his house for one of the strongest Servants in myth.<br>Rin had to open circuits up because otherwise, killing oneself.<br>Saber had to teach proper swordsmanship basics because shit.<br>Failed in being a hero so had to ask the World of Humanity to have the power to become a hero in exchange for being an eternal janitor.<br><br>Did I miss anything?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Illya. Can't blame him.</br>  <br>Being bisected by Gil is entirely Avalon. Avalon facilites self-healing. Shirou's self-healing is swords. It's not a crazy concept. And HF was specifically UBW invading him with swords, not healing.</br>  <br> Its like if someones origin was bees, so anyone he was cut bees rushed out of the wounds and attacked people, including himself at times. </br>  <br>It does apply to him because Saber says he has talent and he grows much more later in life. Saber trained with the knights of the round table she should know if someone has talent.</br>  <br>Oh lancelot<br>He's kind of a soft counter to GoB. Eventually he would be overwhelmed like anyone else, especially if Gil kept opening the gate more.</br></br>  <br>Talent for sword fighting. You can't jump over your biological limits. Shiki and Soujuurou are much strong physically than Shirou at the same age</br>  <br>He doesn't have the MC modifier to make the strongest heroic spirit jobs.</br>  <br>A lot of Servants can't beat Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh beat all the Servants put in front of him in Fate/Extra CCC.</br>  <br> Self made man, earned his powers through hard work <br>and being given avalon by an amoral murderer</br></br>  <br>To correct one thing: he already "works" at school fixing things because of his magical analysis skills and works part-time in the Copenhagen where he lifts things.

You will be a good fighter if you train for a long time." <br> Good fighter <br>At least read.</br></br></br>  <br>One does not jump twenty times in strength because of puberty. Kirei, a freak, has been fighting as an Executor since he was a kid. That means he displayed at least some of his full potential early on. Shirou is human level always and never goes beyond that without his swords.</br>  How and why was Saber able to keep up with Gilgamesh, the King of all Heroes?  <br> ask world to help save people because can't do it on your own <br>Yes. FAILED so asked for help and became le eternal janitor.</br></br>  <br>Because she'd been quite strong in her life thanks to her dragon core, and she's been handling a sword all her life basically, so she got skill.</br>  <br>I can be good fighter if I practise martial arts.

Which is why her strethening which was known to be excessively worrying and top class still just got 10x, no Rin isn't getting close to that. <br><br>Only way Rin could compete with Caster even a bit was by making it something outside of a magic contest.

Kuzuki was trained as a Nanaya since birth except he didn't lose his training one day, and it wasn't just "Potentially you might be better than me one day". Kuzuki is still better than Tohno by some marks, and was buffed by Caster so he could compete.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's a lot of fucking help.</br>  <br> Swords and reinforcement do not count towards the strength stat <br>Citation, because Saber only has A rank strength thanks for her skills.<br> else he'd have it as a specific skill like Saber. <br>He has his magecraft skill.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sentiments that occasionally go around saying Rin is almost as good of a magus as Caster get pretty stupid. <br>What?</br></br>   Q: If Bazett and Kuzuki got in a hand-to-hand fight against each other, who would win? <br><br> A: If it's the first fight, then Kuzuki will win. If it's the second fight, then Bazett would pretty much completely win. Kuzuki could even drive Saber into a corner as long as his trick was kept hidden, but Bazett is also an expert at hand-to-hand combat thought of and developed by human beings. There's the possibility that she might adapt to Kuzuki's "snake" quicker than the Servants, who are more emphasized by their talent. However, since she might underestimate Kuzuki-sensei as being a normal person, Bazett could be beaten pretty simply.  <br><br> Q: Between Kotomine, Bazett, Kuzuki, Melty Blood’s Miyako, and Kishima Kouma, who’d be the top 3 in a purely hand to hand fight with no weapons or magecraft? <br><br> A: I’m excluding Kouma since his existence itself has become a mystery. <br> And even if he didn’t have that nature, he’s like an athlete caught by drug testing. <br> Out of the four left, the winner in pure strength is Bazett. <br> If it’s limited to one match and a surprise attack, then it’s Kuzuki. <br> And if it’s the Kotomine from ten years ago, he’s stronger than Bazett overall.  <br><br> Kuzuki's fighting technique was not something granted by Caster, but his own skills entirely. <br> Just like Caster appreciated Kuzuki, Kuzuki found something in Caster. <br> The reason which drove this husk of a man to fight, in a sense, was similar to that which drove Emiya Shirou. <br> He was a member of an assassination organization similar to the Nanayas in Tsukihime. <br> If there is a sequel, Kuzuki is number one on the list of characters I want to further explore. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bazett is like three times better than Tohno for sure <br>Dunno, year after Tsukihime Shiki already wiped the floor with Forte who apparently is close to Ciel tier</br></br>  <br>1.

Because if he was trained by the Nanaya and never stopped training, he'd be dead already due to a certain event eight years before the 5th Holy Grail War.<br><br>Kuzuki is only better than Bazett by surprise and after the first encounter, if Bazett lives or when she sees the technique, Kuzuki gets ramrodded by Bazett all times after.<br><br>Bazett being better than Tohno when he's "on" is debatable. When Tohno is "on" even a DAA is unable to touch him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> computer isn't a weapon </br>  <br>Originally she supposed to be Ciel rival so probably around her level</br>  <br>He's jobber strong. Basically strong enough to be recognized as really fucking strong, but not strong enough to tank an Excaliblast.</br>  <br> he'd be dead already due to a certain event eight years before the 5th Holy Grail War. </br>  <br> posting fanfiction <br> while missing   <br> a member of an assassination organization similar to the Nanayas in Tsukihime. <br> similar but not the Nanayas </br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck are you babbling about?</br>  <br>But you can't smack people with a compu... Oh wait nevermind.</br>  <br>Kuzuki was said to be trained by a clan similar to the Nanaya.

The fucking VN illustrates how fucking privileged the dumb fucker was.</br>  <br>not him, but i did go through the VN and still have no idea what you mean by priviledged</br>  <br>No. <br> a member of an assassination organization similar to the Nanaya <br>does not mean<br> equal in skill and power to the Nanaya <br>Iga ninjas are similar to the Nanaya. They weren't bred to kill fucking demon hybrids or had the same abilities and pedigree.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Lancelot didn't have such a huge Saber Boner and a better Master than Kariya then sure.

Sending Lancelot in the first battle field with other servants with no game plan is a stupid movie.</br>  <br>Let us remember him as a protector and not the one who gave us... this. As our savior, and not our betrayer!</br>  <br>Yeah. It's called the field of Killinglogy 408.</br>  <br> movie <br>move</br></br>  <br>You mean destroying motherfucking demon hybrids? Yes and that's better than being just assassin for humans</br>  How come Archers don't use bows in this series?    <br>?</br>  <br>You mean Demon Slaying 304.</br>  <br>They do. Are you retarded or blind?</br>  <br>Poor Medusa was treated like shit in the anime tho.</br>  <br> What is Robin, Chiron, Atalanta, Towel Archer, Arjuna.  <br>EMIYA uses it a lot too.</br></br>  <br>Oh look, after three hours of fighting with swords he shoots a single arrow.</br>  <br>But it is rare, unlike his namesake.</br>  <br> Towel Archer </br>  <br><br><br>This ...is this what you wanted?

It happens that a lot of them would use a bow, but that's not the qualifying point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have long dreamt of this day, Sir Lancelot.</br>  <br>Isn't that Artoria? And Launcelot? And Gawain? Seriously, is the Round Table a mary sue club or something?</br>  <br>I dunno. You could make an argument that having Avalon for a decade gave him his powers (not really qualifying as self-made).<br><br>After all, Avalon allegedly forced both his element AND affinity to "SWORD."</br></br></br>  <br>He had TWO Excaliclones? Is this all in GoA?</br>  <br>Probably Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg then.</br>  <br> /vng/ <br>That's not a thing.</br></br>  <br>So why not just call the class "Ranger"?</br>  <br>but it is<br>/visual novel general/</br></br>  <br> , is the Round Table a mary sue club or something? <br><br> Basically<br><br>New writers came along and said "No, this is the real best guy" as they made new characters.<br><br>Its kind of like current comics; but Galahad tops off the chart with Mary Sue levels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zelretch is still alive and he existed far before the 1990's.</br>  <br>Zelretch is still alive, if the only 1 hero refers to ascending to the throne of heroes then it can't be him.</br>  <br>I thought fuckboy was a tumblr thing, I'd never expect 4chan of all places to use it.</br>  Speaking of KotR, Sir Kay is awesome. Saber was apparently superior to him, and yet she never bested him in a fight.  <br> you will never see Shiki's actual blood sister <br>Maybe remake will have some retrospection to Shiki past with Nanayas</br></br>  <br> 1990 <br>1900*</br></br>  <br> Why doesn't Ranger ever Range anything <br><br>Because there's no winning</br></br></br>  <br>Lets see </br>  <br>Yes<br><br> Gareth and Gaheris have twin Excaliswords <br> Gawain has Galatine <br> Lancelot has Arondight <br> Tristan wasn't present but Gawain gave him his bow that never misses and doesn't look like a bow <br> Kay gets a Excalisword <br> Bedivere gets a Excalisword <br> Agravain and Mordred are evil so fairies didn't give them one <br> Galahad gets two Excaliswords because he's cheery and pure <br> Percival was late so he got a spear </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Galahad was a colossal mary sue to begin with.</br>  Why didn't Archer give a shit about Sakura?  <br>Well, even in Nasuverse, Galahad is known as the perfect knight and was supposed to inherit the leadership of the next generation of KotRs. <br><br>Problem is he went and gone to Heaven because he was too perfect for the world.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he's an ilyafag</br>  <br>fine, it's /vn/, not /vng/. Point still stands</br>  <br>What do you mean by "his", you gonna tell me Archer (the one on OP's pic) is female?</br>  <br>He is a shota, but no way he is a "fuccboi", also, stop using that Tumblr word.</br>  <br>Simo Häyhä</br>  <br>He does, stop asking for attention<br><br>She's listed in the data book as one of the three girls that's still his weakness, and he mentions her in CCC.<br><br>Post hidden</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you give us more information on this?<br>And Galahad literally defeated Arthuria and that caused her to go to Rome? Why?</br></br>  <br>All shotas and /ss/ in general are fuccbois, sorry dude</br>  <br>Have at me Sir Gawain let's see you can beat me this time.</br>  <br>Threads get nuked regularly because of how shitty they are.

The point I was making was that it's /vn/, not /vng/.</br>   /a/ still thinks Karen is pure   <br>i backlogged this show and forgot about it.</br>  <br>That boy is pretty pure though.

Maybe this will fix the weird high pitch noise I get sometimes when e.g. clothing rustling, some voices starting.</br></br></br>  <br> Kajou is actually a likable character who isn't a slut, nor a hypocrite, and has a very positive, healthy outlook on sex as more than just bumping uglies </br>  <br>no, you just hate actual fun</br>  <br>Is Gouriki a 45 year old in disguise?</br>  Not really.<br>Just meh.</br>  How does goriki not get expelled for his constant violent screaming outbursts<br>I'd be terrified to be in school with him</br>  <br>Nope, prison school is way more funnier than this shit. I like both of them though.</br>  No, it's good but Wakaba girl has better comedy  So Funi's double censor rip is the only choice for this show?  <br><br>Ah, ended up not fixing it. Guess that problem is elsewhere. <br><br>Also getting some frame jitter. Any idea how to fix that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you select to high on the performance question?</br>  <br>I'm surprised, I actually like it more with each episode.</br>  <br> glasses a shit <br>Nice homosexuality anon.</br></br>  <br>I liked this part.</br>  <br>It was either medium or high, don't remember lol.<br><br>Actually it seems like the stuttering only happens when my current window is something else, so probably just not allocating enough resources.</br></br></br>  <br>High settings use a lot of resources try lowering the setting.</br>  <br>4U</br>  <br>Yeah I'll do that. My pleb eyes probably aren't gonna notice any upscaling interpolation differences anyway.</br>  <br>RIP that pool</br>  <br>Ya I was pretty shocked by that as well.</br>  <br>She is a bit, but she's hot and hilarious, so it's ok, particularly on account of being hot. Doesn't work as well for that Charlotte bitch.</br>  <br>Feminism.</br>  <br>Wait, is there an uncensored version? Am I an even bigger faggot than I had thought for using HorribleSubs?</br>  <br>Hiryuu seems to release 4-5 days after airing, if you want to wait.</br>  Why's J.C. Staff so lewd lately?  <br>where is the gunkata then? chekmate atheist</br>  Isnt it hilarious how a show about censoring got censored to hell and back?   'you need to be this japanese to understand'-puns <br> lol sex, dirty jokes, sex lol, did i mentioned SEX???? <br><br> funny <br><br>Are there only 13 year old virgins on this board?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For a moment I thought I was in a seitokai yakuindomo thread.</br>    How do I know if a subbed torrent uses either the censored or the less censored version?  <br>I didn't know SZS was for thirteen-year-olds. Hang on a sec, I'll go kill myself.</br>  <br>Those who rip from streaming sites like HS are usually censored.</br>  <br>You can literally hear the wordplay yourself like 3/4ths of the time, I have no idea why people have problems with shows that do this</br>    <br>It's not really a problem here, but half the jokes in the SYD manga went right over my head. Luckily, the puns weren't what I was reading for, anyway.</br>  <br>Cock-a-doodle-pussy -- doesn't sound natural<br><br>Cock-a-doodle-dick -- better, but you lost the pussy reference.<br><br>Maybe it should be Cunt-a-doodle-dick, but cunt sounds much ruder than pussy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Either way. I have an incredibly uncivilized desire to wear some panties on my face. I might go get a pair and answer the door in them. We get a lot of mormons.</br>  <br>Cock a doo vagoo?</br>  <br>Prison school</br>  <br>I want to fuck her in her normal school girl form while she wears her delectable glasses and is being lecherous.<br>She really turns me on in that state!</br></br>  <br>too much lowbrow americanized humor in this show</br>  <br>Muffa doodle dick</br>  <br>Great since "vagoo" comes from censorship itself, but I think it's just a meme, not used IRL<br><br>"Cock-a-doo-vagOOO" works in subs but only subs cause you wonder what she said.</br></br></br>  <br>Penes pichulas y sapos hediondos.</br>    How long til the pussy cookies?  <br> pussy cookies <br>This requires further explanation.</br></br>  <br>no it really doesn't</br>  <br><br> judging from CD only <br>just gtfo</br></br></br>  The sex jokes are something I would hear a grade school spew out. Simply replacing words in a regular sentence with sex related terms and screaming sex related stuff at the top of your lungs isn't my idea of funny, in fact it's obnoxious and juvenile<br><br> I bet your humor must be so mature <br><br>No, sex humor can be funny if it's done correctly. I think this anime handles it poorly to the point it's exasperating and hard to watch.<br><br>I'm going to have to strongly disagree with you, OP but I'm rather surprised and a bit disappointed at the fact many will agree with you. As disappointing as this anime is I still can't drop it out of morbid curiosity though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh Shit, this is a comedy? Why is it so unfunny then?</br>  <br>because your a humorless cunt?</br>   penis penis vagina vagina <br> best comedy of the season <br>Looks like this season is fucked</br></br>  <br>man the fuck up and drop it if you don't like it faggot. no one is holding a gun to your head and making you watch it. don't be a bitch.</br>  <br>Because I don't laugh when you put dick and vagina in a sentence? God, it must be sad watching the same shit for 12 episodes and pretending joke is funny after 100'th time.</br>  <br> not having a hearty laugh while fapping <br>2sad4me</br></br>  <br>Oh wow you've changed my mind you so nailed down what it's all about just dick and vagina jokes......oh wait IT FUCKING isn't. I don't think you've watched it at all. Why don't you go fucking work for a shit site like ANN you sound like one of those pretentious "highbrow" twats.</br>  It's a bit early to tell, but with all the shitposting going on in these threads, this show is looking a strong contender for AOTS  Actually what makes me laugh is the behaviour of chertain character rather than the sex jokes themselves  <br>Fapping to what? Literally everything is censored.</br>  <br><br>Spewing curse words unnecessarily just like the anime, funny man. Besides I'm still interested in some scenes I've seen in LN and manga screen captures. I also hear there's drama from one poster but it may be just a rumor. I don't see this kind of series getting serious though.<br><br><br>Disagreeing =! shitposting. OP asked that to /a/ as collective if they agreed which means fans of the series and not. This isn't a circlejerk thread is it?<br><br><br>Laugh while fapping to someone yelling expletives? I don't find this sexually appealing but whatever floats your boat, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's basically all it has to offer when it comes to shit that hasn't been done may times in bad comedies, so yeah, it's all about terrible sex jokes. Besides, why do you sound so offended? Is Ayame you new waifu or something?</br>  <br> Spewing curse words unnecessarily just like the anime <br>How much of a faggot can you be<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for proving my point even further. I'll leave you with this out of fear I may be responding to bait at this point, funny man.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128381765 <br><br>which was the point I made and why his obvious posts aren't worth responding to anymore.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128381765 <br>Why would you give a shit about that faggot, more so since it types like hes a MALtard. In-fact, why are you even giving the fuckwit the attention he wants? The anon I was replying to is a obvious crossborder, and should fuck off</br>  Op here. I just have to say I am severely disappointed about all this senseless drama and the even more alarming lack of lewd screen caps.  DUDE SEX LMAO<br>Yeah, comedy gold right here</br>   still no Hiryuu   <br>Yes you're right. <br><br>The correct answer is Chaos Dragon. It's shitty it's hilarious</br></br></br>    <br> those crotch shot scenes. <br>the ugly sleep deprived bags under her eyes<br>Why is this so fucking hot?</br></br></br>  <br> The sex jokes are something I would hear a grade school spew out. <br><br>You do realize that's exactly the point right? Or you're too much of a retarded faggot to notice?<br> That time comedy LN was 2deep4u </br></br></br></br>  <br>I would really love to satisfy her curiosity</br>  <br> You do realize that's exactly the point right <br>How does it change anything he said?<br>It's still boring cringe garbage</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128382566 <br>Oh hello, worst tripfag. It's no surprise that your taste a shit as always</br>  <br>Too bad you're the one with shit taste here this time</br>  <br>Yeah yeah your favorite anime is shit I know, I know</br>  <br>Yes!<br>Thanks our based god that gave Charlotte to people with wicked and mature sense of humor like us!</br></br>  <br>what a bitch.</br>  <br> strawmanning this hard </br>  <br>What does Chatlotte have to do with this?<br>You're getting desperate at defending this shit</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128381765 <br> &gt;o noes my poor bitch faggot eyes are hurt by the naughty words </br>  so many sad people in this thread  <br>More like on this board<br>No one here likes pepe and feels even though they're so much fun.</br></br>  <br>I don't watch this serie, but CUNT A DICKLE DOO</br>  <br>so many underage people in this thread</br>  <br>seriously what's up with this meme pool?<br>I see it in every other anime that takes place in tokyo</br></br>  <br>Today's morning edition</br>  <br>it can't hold a candle to prison school though</br>  <br>You mean Light-ray School</br>  <br>even in light-ray mode it's way superior</br>  looks kinda hot, i'll just wait till the doujins come out though  Seriously how braindead are you people that you find a girl shouting "SEX SEX PENIS PENIS" funny? The comedy in this anime is targeted at retards, cant believe people are hyping this shit up.  <br>I like it even though i usually stay away from these kinds of shows, maybe.</br>  <br>Is this show actually censored? I thought that was the whole joke that they put censors over everything.</br>  She pretty much carries this  <br>What's wrong with her belly?</br>  <br>It's the japanese porn pool. Kinda the equivalent to this thing.</br>  <br>absolutely nothing</br>  I didn't get what the mirror truck was  <br>used for 'public' fucking</br>  just give me the lewd webms of Kajou already  <br>Instead of gunkata they use lewdkata.</br>  <br>iku iku</br>  <br>I'll watching this for the lewd slav president. I hope it's worth it.</br>  <br>Love honey anon</br>  I'm hyped for the next episode even just because of the cookie scene  <br>I don't find it funny, its dumb. What I do find funny is the setting and how awful it is.</br>    <br>I can get behind that. I've been looking forward to more episodes of it than anything else even. Really the premise is just spot on. I can't see anyone fucking this up so it should be a bunch of fun.</br>   people unironically like this trash <br><br>Explain yourselves.</br></br>  <br> Matsuki Miyu and Arai Satomi in one anime both voicing cock hungry sluts <br> not one of the best anime of the season </br></br>  <br> Targeted towards teen audience <br> Implying 13 year olds aren't teens </br></br>  <br> implying all the teens are 13yo </br>  <br>Like Fafner?</br>  <br>Navel, anon.

You don't have to actually want to have sex to joke about it, just like you don't have to actually want to murder babies to think dead baby jokes are funny.</br>  <br> Explain the funny <br>Implying that doesnt ruin the joke its funny that you think people think this part of the show is funny what she says doesnt matter its the premise thats hilarious saying this in another setting would be idiotic.</br></br>  <br>This is one step away from going full PP anyway, why not go the extra limb and go freedom fighter</br>  <br><br>She totally doesn't, a shame I didn't save that picture of her blushing and averting her eyes from Tanukichi's raging boner.</br></br>  <br>because 3DPD.</br>  This is literally the Family Guy of anime.  <br><br>Why is Kajo so unsexy?</br></br>  <br>Do you prefer formal Kajo?</br>  <br><br>She's top grade hand-holding material trying to forcefully act as a huge slut, this consumes all of her sex appeal.<br><br>Hence why she's at her best when using long skirt, braided hair and megane, it all enhances her inner pure waifuness.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I would also like to know where this is from for reasons.</br></br>   you will never make dirty jokes with your 2D waifu   And the silver hair girl is a pure slut that can take 10 dicks at once made pure by sheer ignorance.<br>Impressive.</br>  <br>I guess if you are 10.</br>  <br>if you like trash like seitokai yakuindomo, then this is your kind of show.</br>  <br>I know it's only a few episodes in, but I already find this a lot less repetitive than SYD (which I still enjoyed). It's really well-made, too. You can tell the whole staff had a lot of fun.</br>  <br> Formal Kajo <br>Thar formal design was tainted, and not so pure now.</br></br>  <br>Where is this from.</br>  <br>she looks fat</br>  <br>Busty, healthy girl.</br>  <br>where the fuck did that condom come from?<br>Wasn't that a pen at first?</br></br>  <br>Edit by a separate request.

Maybe some kissing, too. </br></br>  <br>Going by this illustration and the show's OP, it seems like she's just shy against actual face-to-face sexuality.

What if a host and an interspecies both like eachother as friends, but aren't interested in marriage? Also, don't host families have no idea what kind of interspecies to expect when they agree to house one? Like, that family was surprised when they got Rachnee.</br>  <br>She is a predator, afterall. Papi knows when prey is resisting... you just have to TAKE IT!</br>  It seems that they will skip a chapter next week to have two chapters of Suu.<br><br>I wonder if they have the Miia shedding later or if they just skip it totally.</br></br>  <br>sporty horse girl is the best.</br>  <br> I wonder if they have the Miia shedding later or if they just skip it totally <br>Saving it for OVA?</br></br>  <br>she meant that they can't stop it if romance develops so they need to create provisions for it in the law to avoid civil discord.</br>  <br> Skip a chapter <br><br>I don't think so, Lerche doesn't need to do that just put an introduction of suu and keep the 2ch per episode rule.</br></br></br>  Miia in yandere mode when?  <br> Cerea is the shittiest variaton of centaur </br>  <br>Did you even watch the episode?</br>  <br>the preview was for Suu introduction, and the one where they play with the children, they are skiping the shedding</br>  <br>She wasn't implying that host families had to marry their extra species charges.</br>  Daily birdness.  Centorea confirmed for Jojo crossover  <br>This is how she expressed it in the manga.<br><br>The interspecies relations are already a thing, but they are not official part of the bill.<br>The host thing is temporary system to slowly integrate non-humans to human society and assumedly such system would later be removed for normal freedom for non-humans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Avian &gt; Harpy.</br>  <br>She said interspecies relationships, not just as part of their little exchange program you trog. Get some reading comprehension.</br>  English version.  <br>NEW CHAPTER WHEN<br>I wanna see more of Owlnee-san</br></br>  <br><br> Shedding on OVA <br><br>I don't see the problem.</br></br></br></br>  This is kind of like the op video of yatterman  <br>No need to be a cunt m8.</br>  <br>Nigger, I don't want to be an asshole but at least use Shop and edit that shit.</br>    <br>that was fast</br>  <br> I'm sorry it's taken long; I've got to take a look at the translation.

Mammary glands are usually the same size.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Higher budget, 40 minute episodes.</br>  <br><br>we all know there will never be any horse/snake/slime sex in official capacity in Monster Musume.</br></br>  <br>or like Nano and Hakase</br>  <br><br><br><br> All these retards replying to obvious bait. <br><br>Sasuga /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Diary breed </br>  <br>I personally think that would detract from the series. The sex that is.</br>  <br>Wow that's really interesting, where are your sources regarding evolutionary biological studies on centaur tits in a fantasy harem manga world?</br>  <br>Lightweight is basically horse Wanko?</br>  <br>An actual answer, Papi calling the MC Husband.</br>  <br>What about mutual masturbation?</br>  <br>Are these subspecies canon or just an anime-only thing? They're interesting (same for the harpy and lamia ones) but I've never seen them in the manga.</br>   Shedding chapter skipped <br><br>Anime ruined</br></br>  <br><br>would you drink diary breed's milk, anon?</br></br>  <br><br>Dont you mean boss? Where you guys getting the husband from<br><br><br>Im cool with that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the top half is human and the bottom is horse. So I'm gonna go ahead and reference human biology for anything regarding her top half.</br>  <br>Are you really this /v/irgin faggot?</br>  <br>How do you know it was from mlp?</br>  <br>I would have her bathe me in it. Though I'd sooner prefer the cow girl because I don't like horses.</br>  <br>They're canon.</br>  <br>Considering Crabman drew them and wrote them all, its definitely going to be canon.<br><br><br>We only know they're focusing on Suu's introduction next issue. Remember, the first half could still be the shedding and establishing Miia's failure at cooling.<br><br>Remember, Suu is introduced appearing out of one of Miia's cooking pots after consuming her failure.<br><br>But they might move the shedding to later so the trash bag of Miia's shed scales isn't out of place when Mr. Asshole Exploiter shows up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The top half is centaur and the bottom half is centaur.</br>  <br>straight out of the tit</br>  <br> Considering Crabman drew them and wrote them all <br>Is that so? That's pretty fucking neat.</br></br>  <br>I hope so, I don't remember this either</br>  <br>this this this<br>holy shit I've found my waifu</br></br>  I haven't read the manga since it was first hot shit here on /a/, but spoider lady is showing up soon, right? Wash slime girl down the drain.  <br> Not from the clean, pasteurized bottle. </br>  How is it even possible for a Japanese man to have sex with a centaur? isn't she's too tall for them?  <br><br>Mmmm... A good morning. Watched Overlord. Watched this. Fapped to centaur mating and doujin on exhentai and centaur girl in mgq scene and had a wonderful orgasm, and now eating chocolate.<br><br>Yep. Tuesdays are going to be fucking awesome from now on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rachnera is showing up on episode 8.</br>  <br>I'm still confused on how centaur sex can even seem erotic. Just thinking about it, it seems really silly looking. You can only fuck them in one position really.</br>  <br>they would probably have stools specifically marketed for this. I would brush up on my carpentry skills just to make and market them.</br>  <br><br> All these secondaries <br><br>Those subspecies comes from the manga you massive retards, the thing is you faggots never going to know when we got that since those were posted here long time ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no pegasus or unicorn girl by Crabman <br>DISAPPOINTMENT.  I hope it's the first and the last one. </br></br>  <br>A stool? or she could sit down. Try fucking a taller girl and you will find out.</br>  <br><br>Why would she wear her hair like that. She blocks 2 of her eyes. That makes no sense.</br></br>  I want Papi to lay my eggs.   Friendly reminder that this whole full moon faisco is all Smith's fault, and if she hadn't been so lazy and forgetful, Darling wouldn't have to deal with three horny girls trying to kill him.   <br>how's the taste? is it better than cow's milk? is it sweeter than sheep's?</br>  <br>That's pretty crushing news. Oh well, I'll still keep watching.</br>  <br> Hurr durr I are leet manga reader. <br>Why don't you go find a Yahrai thread to shitpost in.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KGe<wbr>9F7kPmG0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Waiting for someone to do it properly, I'm too lazy  <br>Human beings wear their hair in ways that they block one of their only two eyes. I don't think it's such a big deal for her.</br>   no Papi lewd <br> make her clothes baggy <br>Perfect episode my ass.<br>They really only care for big breasts with this adaptation.</br></br></br>   <br>I dunno, chapter 25 seems like a better fit for OVA than shedding chapter.</br>  <br><br>Get out</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but if the show started airing and sales bumped up out of nowhere... (ex: they weren't advertising more or anything)<br>It's probably the show</br></br>  <br> Stepstool <br> Ladder <br> Her lying on the bed and you standing. <br> You lying down she ontop of you <br> She on her back, you ontop of her. <br><br><br>Its the action of the pussy, anon. Centaur mares have loose pussies, yes. But there are very powerful muscles around them. The effect is like going from an incredibly hot, wet fleshy passage, to suddenly virgin tightness squezing pulsing around you. Also their pussies are warm, like steaming on cold days warm. All of their real erogenous zones are right at the opening, so a human dick would pleasure them to orgasm just fine. Stallion dick isn't about pleasuring the female, its about ramming the seed into her womb and making sure it stays there. Which is why they usually only take 10 seconds to cum.<br><br>So a human, standing behind a centaur, would have the underside of his cock rubbed by her clitoris as the muscular action contracts her pussy around his cock in an intense milking sensation. Coupled with her pinning you to the wall and her hips shaking and pumping you in and out, with her cries in the air and her calling out her love for you and how good it feels...<br><br>Yeah, it would be pretty erotic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck yeah old jackie chan movies are awesome<br><br>to more relevant things though<br><br>spider a best but I approve of all your choices</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm pretty sure it's mentioned somewhere in the manga that she also has bad eyesight, so it's not as much of a problem</br>  Are you sure? I've read the entire manga, and I've never seen any of these subspecies. I thought they were just a new interesting lore drop at the end of each new anime episode.  <br>Dude. I was following it from issue 1. Stop crying. I'm just spoonfeeding the secondaries because its my hobby.</br>  <br>Sounds ike someone is speaking from experience here.</br>  <br>meant for<br><br>sorry.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Source: my ass.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, guess I'm a freak.

Rachnera is introduced on issue 14 in a little shadowy corner after she ties up and calls the cops on asshole exploiter. Then on 15 she kidnaps Darling and joins the Harem. On 16 she tries to rape Darling repeatedly but gets pussyblocked by Cerea then they make up and make friends.<br><br>So according to the schedule of INTELLIGENT THOUGHT... Rachnera will be seen in the shadows at the end of episode 7, then her whole episode devoted to her on 8.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did people react to the first episode? I missed it.  <br>We've seen the harpie subspecies before.</br>  <br>In other words those things are special content coming from the Manga not included in the actual translations.<br><br>Now fuck off animeonlyfags.</br></br></br>  Was it rape?  <br>Secondaryfag confirmed for not reading the manga, being an seasonal casual and the very thing he shitposts about.</br>  the cutest  Why do people refer to the mangaka by Crabman?  <br> "HURR DURR SECONDARIES I MAEK POST" <br>Actually, I think you need to understand what "reading comprehension" is.</br></br>  <br>Anon both loved it and hated it.

I don't even mind if they do a few original episodes as long as they are approved by Crabman.<br><br>But if they continue the 2 chapters per episode theme, they're going to get to Lala's introduction on Episode 12. That would be a good place to end the season on, for now.<br><br>Maybe they could continue to 16 and get up to the mother chapters, which would be cute and fun.

What's more, Kyouko and Sayaka bring out the best in each other. Before Sayaka met Kyouko she was a slacker in school, but later she strived to improve herself so she could push Kyouko to do the same, as well as teach Sayaka how to fight for her ideals without losing herself to them. And Sayaka helped Kyouko to remember her true self and got her to open up to people by showing her that are still good people in the world worth fighting for.<br><br>There you go.

Then again him wording it like this seems weird. Also he didn´t move an inch before she agreed.</br>  <br>Wait the manga is done already? Or is it just the current chapter?</br>  <br> Or is it just the current chapter? <br>only the current available ones are done then.

I'd probably like it now if I went back and listened to it.</br></br>  Not me. I like Kokone but<br> I want Yuu back </br>  And before I was able to pretty much start this episode, I creamed my everything.  I've been listening to Love Like Caramelize nonstop for the last few days. I think it's my favourite song this season.<br><br>Granted, that isn't much of an achievement - the songs this season aren't very good.</br></br>    They aren't sad for Yuu when she leaves though.  Hey /a/, can we talk about delinquent manga?<br>What's your favorite series? Are there any good newer manga out right now or is it a dead genre? Why are pompadours objectively great?</br>  <br>That one show about the inner workings of the Yakuza.<br><br> Protip: You won't find it </br></br></br>  I really should get back to watching the rest of uh...<br>Something something westgate park</br>  I don't read much of the... genre?

I wish it was, there is a drastic lack of Yakuza anime</br>  http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>472642</wbr>  Damn so we will still be stuck on that boat for maybe half a year or more now huh?

Although him fighting Rakshas is nice, I fear their match will end inconclusively. Anyway a new Berserk chapter really made my day. Can't contain my excitement for the next issue next year.  <br>For now</br>   tfw you got slapped and you liked it   <br>Except Knightbro, or did I miss him?</br>  <br><br>What the shit is it happening already?</br></br>  <br>He is part of Guts' crew. Or are you talking about Luca's lover Jerome?</br>  <br>What the bitch.</br>  Why did you idiots think we were getting off the boat soon anyway?  Can't understand korean, why is the seaweed hair moonlight knight crushing the balcony with his fist?  Silat will die before the story is over.  <br> RECKTert says how it is into Griffith's face <br> his fagboys try to kill him straight away <br><br>Griffith is a shit waifu and his fagboys are mindless otaku.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Probably because of Rickert.</br>  <br>They're just optimistic morons.</br>  I want Rickert to get gangbanged in front of the girl.  Rickert couldn't stop staring at Guts, huh. If only he had been mature enough to understand the universal language.  <br> it's actually young Guts and not old Guts head copy-pasted onto a smaller body </br>   Silat saves Rickert <br> not Skull Knight <br><br>Oh come on nigga.<br>It would've been perfect.<br><br>"You are either very brave or very stupid, young man.Your time is still yet to come."<br><br> slashes Rakshas and grabs Rickert </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Skull Knight probably killed himself in shame. I would have.</br>  <br> the Bākiraka are back <br>It was worth the wait</br></br>  Rickert is my favourite character at this point, If he dies I am dropping Berserk.  <br>Didn't mean to quote</br>  <br>I hate Korean language it's unreadable for Asian people.</br>   still no Jerome <br>Am I really the only one worried about him??<br>He was a bro, come on...</br></br>  <br> miura is reading your post right now </br>  <br> Or are you talking about Luca's lover Jerome? <br>Yes, this one.<br>Why did the whores leave him?</br></br></br>   Korean before JP raws <br><br>Someone explain how the fuck is this even possible?</br></br>   Griffith amassing a crapton of weapons <br> Rickert almost assassinated shortly after he slapped Griffith <br><br>Oh god, this is happening.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, he was a noble. I think he just gave them money or something and left them.</br>   oh...cool chapter is out <br> skim through <br> lots of words, no action, and Guts and co nowhere to be seen <br> .... <br><br>I feel that the hiatus killed what little I feeling I had left for this series</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Skull Knight might still be able to work it out somehow. After all, now all of the God Hand are manifested in the new merged world. Using dimension-slashing swordstrikes are not a good idea against space-and-gravity manipulating demon lords like Femto (and most likely Void). Now the Skull Knight knows. <br><br>Back to the drawing board.</br></br></br>  <br>I suspect Griffiths gutslust is re manifesting itself in the form of a massive invasion to steal back both his husbando and brown fuckdoll</br>  So Falconia isn't exactly a utopia. I wonder if Griffith was involved in this assassination attempt. It's possible that Griffith will be oblivious to the plans and schemes of his apostle generals.  looks like raksas is about to get fucked up. I'm keen.  <br>BASED<br>A<br>S<br>D<br><br>KOREAN<br>O<br>R<br>E<br>A<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This always happen with a lot of series.

He'll just claim to not have taken part in it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Griffith is a Jesus, he knows everything.<br><br>Not only that he is a petty fuccboi.</br></br></br>  Isn't Rakshas appearing on an old, decapitated statue (probably Gaiseric dredged up with Falconia) suspish as fuck?<br><br>RAKSHAS = SKULLY<br>A<br>K<br>S<br>H<br>A<br>S<br><br>=<br><br>S<br>K<br>U<br>L<br>L<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he can read in mind. It's the reason why he has Sonia.</br>  Where is the boat, I need to get off it.  <br>nips don't care about berserk</br>  <br>The Korea manga mafia was funded by Cascafags.</br>  <br>He doesn't get to choose, though. The Sword of Resonance has a will of its own. If it feels like slashing through dimensions, it will change forms.</br>  <br>I liked that. It's probably Gaiseric statue. We still haven't seen his face.</br>  <br>That's because it's Guts' face. Skull Knight is Guts from the future.</br>  <br>why would Guts pick up an entirely different fighting style, weapon combination and speaking style?</br>  <br><br>I don't think that Griffith ordered to kill Rickert, because if he did Rickert would be already dead. I think it's Locus or Rakshas is working by himself.<br><br>On the other hand does the Bakiraka group even stand a chance against Rakshas?</br></br></br></br>  Based Kebab team but are they really any challenge for Raksha who is an apostle?<br><br>Silat got rekt by Guts.</br></br>   Ops leak is in korean <br> Good, coherent, and well written english translations wont be out in a while <br><br>I just want to see casca become unretarded.</br></br></br>  <br> Locus ordered this <br> Griffith finds out <br> his gay party around him <br> "Did you try to kill Rickert, Locus? <br> "Yes but he-. <br> Griffith beheads him on the spot <br><br>It will to be to show that there is NO tolerance for such actions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>we all we know is he is super hard to hit</br></br>  <br>Subscribed.</br>  <br>He got 1000 times more powerful from standing against Guts twice and living. You don't give a bunch of jobbers a big panel.</br>  <br><br>Actually it would be interesting.<br><br>Griffith is so ambigious right now...<br><br>Who knows maybe Miura plan on doing something similar to Star Wars. Griffith = Vader, Guts = Luke</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, Guts managed to defeat some apostles, and Silat's not alone. The bakirakas however probably won't really try to kill Rakshas, just keep him occupied long enough to fend him off once enough onlookers appear to see Kushans fighting against some kind of black shadow demon. The general populace of Falconia might have accepted that many in the Band of the Falcon are some kind of weird monster, but that doesn't meant that they want to see that all the time. The apostles probably all have the order to stay in their human form as much as possible to not freak out the normies/blind sheep.</br>  Welp, see you in 10 months  <br><br>Nope, Berserk will be a monthly series now. Next chap is on August 28</br></br>  <br><br>Just have patience. I think it's better to show Falconia right now and not just skiping to Guts. I don't waznt Miura to rush the story.</br></br>  <br><br> they do not leave the boat in 10 chapters </br></br>  anyone else surprised at what a   big guy   Raksas is? Only just realised we've only ever seen him alongside other big things like the tapasa and apostles.  Anyone else can't open OP's link?  All I need is her, nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>Well maybe some Shierke butt would be nice too.</br></br>  <br> That a man's jaw <br>That's a man.</br></br>  <br>They block adblock. Pause it.</br>  Raksa says pretty lcearly this is for "ruining" Griffith's image.<br><br>Griffith was slapped by a young man without any repercussions and explanations.<br>This is more or less to end the discussion as to why Griffith let him go.<br><br>Definitely not Griffith's order, probably Locus.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Oh ok thanks.</br>  <br>someone dump it instead</br>  <br><br>If my sauce informed me correctly, it's gonna be monthly only for another 4 Episode.</br></br>  <br><br>I hope you're joking.</br></br>  <br> if my sauce informed me correctly <br>fuck off</br></br>  What reason could Griffith possibly have to amass weapons? What's left to conquer, does he intend to go around killing dragons and other magical creatures just for shits and giggles, or does he intend something like going against the other god hand now that they're apparently in the physical world?  <br> the chin <br>can't unsee</br></br>  remove kebab  <br>brilliant</br>  <br> 4 chapters <br> one year break <br>And repeat. I don't think I could handle it anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>We know he's hunting down magic users so probably Elfhelm.</br>  <br>Are you jealous of him?</br>  <br>Nope, I requested further explanation, they only posted this image, for now.<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/r2JAi5h.jpg</br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't get to choose, though. <br><br>He does get to choose. Skull Knight was either coming for the Emperor or Femto. Femto just had to make sure he struck the Emperor.<br><br>Why do people think Skully was fixated so strongly on striking down Femto? That's an angle GUTS would take, but really Skully needed to slash somebody who was twice reincarnated. (Femto and Emp fill this role and allow him to open the gate)</br></br></br></br></br>  What if Rickert is Archer?  <br>I waited 8 months to watch Rickert dick around in Falconia.</br>  <br> You don't give a bunch of jobbers a big panel. <br><br>Sure gave a lot of big panels to the original band of the hawk</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that is why Rickert is questioning the amount.<br><br>What can he possible conquer with that?</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is going to be one of those fights that are irrelevant to the main plot, but the hype and resolution is going to be orgasmically good.<br><br>Imagine Mashiba vs Kimura (Hajime no Ippo) or Sugano vs that posessed judo girl (Tenjo Tenge)</br></br></br></br>  <br>You say that, but if Berserk was quarterly yet consistent that would be better than what we've been getting so far.</br>  <br>What is Guts is Berserker?</br>  <br><br><br>He's going to shove all the spears, swords and clubs in the kingdom up his butt because he's a giant homo<br><br>he'll do it for free too</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>T-thanks, anon-kun.</br>  <br>I don't think there will be a fight. I think Bakiraka will run away taking Rickert with them.</br>  <br>Better than FUCKING MERMAIDS.</br>  <br>holy shit that looks bad</br>    <br>Maybe it says that there will be a new chapter every 4 weeks now. Technically Berserk is a biweekly series.</br>  I wonder how Griffith's Kelly Family would react if they knew he was taking old cocks up his bum and sacrificed his squad.  <br> better that fucking mermaids <br>I don't know about that</br></br>  <br>Knowing how unhinged Raksas is he could have meant "ruining his image" literally by defiling his face with his inferior human palm. He was pretty caught up with taking Griffith's "pretty little head" when they first met.</br>  <br><br>You guys are dumb.</br></br>   yfw raksas isn't even an apostle   <br> not liking mermaids tities </br>  <br>I realy Hope so.<br>I asked a friend of mine for the traduction, i will let you know.</br></br>  translations fucking when  <br>Most of his Kelly Family were there at the ritual and ate his squad.</br>  Is Jill really dead or what?<br><br>I saw some comparison image in one of these threads.</br></br>  <br>We will never know.</br>  <br> sand ningas are back <br>I dare hope.</br></br>  <br>I'd like to see her again, but Falconia is likely the last place she'd be, considering the lesson she learnt in the end was literally "there's no paradise for you to escape to".<br><br>As far as the comparison pic goes, yeah i think she probably was the plague stricken girl laban rescued, doesn't mean she's dead but it'll be a miracle if she survived all this time since then.</br></br></br>  <br>It says the last 4 chapters are republished.</br>  <br>This. What fucking Apostle just goes around shanking people?</br>  <br>So we are saved.<br><br>Thank God, and thank you, anon, for the translation.</br></br></br>  <br>wtf<br>was that her</br></br>  <br>Why would you link to an image when you're on a bloody imageboard?</br>  I wonder if Daiba will be relevant again. Of all the mages shown so far his abilities are by far the most entertaining and he's as hard to take down as Apostle.  <br>Not improbable, but I don't think that was she. Just a same-face. Even Miura draws them. There was a guy during the battle between the black dog knights and the fugitive Hawks where one of the Hawks literally looked like Guts with a bandana. There's only so many variations of people that even Miura can draw. <br>Rickert for example actually looks like Farnese.</br></br>  <br>He's a farmer now anon</br>  <br>What's also interesting is if he's half as good as any other magic user we've seen he should know that Griffith is the Hawk of Darkness and everything that entails. I wonder what he's hoping to gain from sticking around.</br>   The muscles are allies now <br><br>What a twist in events.</br></br>  <br> Daiba knows about the secret of Griffith <br> he also knows about the last place Guts was seen <br> encounters Rickert and his new friends, tells them everything they know <br> they figure out the plan of Griffith to probably assault the Elfhelm, sneak on one of his warships and end up reuniting with Guts on Elfhelm <br> huge arc of Elfhelm was <br> &gt;Miura dies </br></br></br></br></br></br>  ulp, his art seems to have worsen a little bit but I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe i should re-read the last chapters again  <br> was <br>*war</br></br>  Why did cloaked kebab want to murder Rickert and why did muslce kebab with boomerang kebab save him  <br>I'm putting it down to the fact that Falconia is pure white and full of light which doesn't give a lot of opportunities for shading, making the first few pages seem kind of flat.</br>  <br> Miura dies </br>  <br>because he slapped griffith</br>  Wonder if the Koreanbro who does Prison School can help out with this.  <br>Because fuck Griffith's dogs, that's why, they are too gay for him.</br>  <br>how can they run away from something like that? only way would be for 1 of lumpy brothers to stay behind and hold him off.</br>  <br>Bagzerk edit now</br>  <br>So that cloaked kebab guy was just went tsundere for Griffith when he said he will cut Griffith's head off.</br>  <br>i cant figure out rakshas mask face. are the 2 black dots a nose and mouth? or is the mouth supposed to be the jaggies at the bottom?</br>  Rakshas is not an apostle, right?  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  <br>it's three eyes and the spikes at the bottom are jagged teeth like Ganishka's old demon soldiers.</br>  <br><br>oh wait the two black dots, i see it as stylised tears of blood or something.</br></br>  <br>He might not be, he was definitely human at one point. He is missing that weird connection the apostles have with Griffith even the cloud guy felt it went he met him the first time but rakshas doesn't seem to care at all.</br>   berserk is still a thing <br> there are still people who care <br><br>You guys really don't know when to drop something.</br></br></br>   dat smugstitute  <br>Her name is Pepe, right?</br>  What happened to Nina?  Miura forgot how to fucking draw Luca.  <br>like this</br>  <br>Go watch your idol matter shit.</br>  <br>Those spikes are his beard then, I take it?</br>  <br>nice trips</br>  <br> http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives<wbr>/472642</wbr> <br><br>I can´t open the fucking link, am i the only one?</br></br></br>  <br> Dropping things <br>I'm sure you dropped life too.</br></br>  <br> everything looks nice but something feels a bit off and I can't put ny finger on it.  <br>That's how Falconia is supposed to be.</br></br>   SUMMARY <br><br>http://www.skullknight.net/forum/in<wbr>dex.php?PHPSESSID=dhpdrv3nc5487uc4b<wbr>0o6uun256&amp;topic=14709.msg235643#msg<wbr>235643</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Seriously, look at this shit. The difference is tremendous. She looks 10 years younger than what she's supposed to be now.</br>  <br>Falconia distorts character designs?</br>  <br>bravo miura</br>  <br>i see the spikes as a representation of the same oversized teeth ganishka's experiments have. which would make the two tear drop shapes either a nose or just an icon on the mask, maybe showing blood dripping from the eyes.</br>  <br>Well that answers where Jerome went.</br>  <br><br> The girls are fawning: "Ah you are great Luca. Don't you regret about Jerome?" <br>Luca: "His wife is too fierce. I couldn't fool her, and I'm not that type of woman."<br><br>http://www.skullknight.net/forum/in<wbr>dex.php?PHPSESSID=dhpdrv3nc5487uc4b<wbr>0o6uun256&amp;topic=14709.msg235643#msg<wbr>235643</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can anyone post the chapter here? I can't open the link. Please be a bro.</br>  <br><br>the problem for me is that i cant UNSEE the nose and mouth thing</br></br>    <br><br><br>i tried with chrome and it didnt work. tried with firefox and it did work.</br></br></br>  <br> Griffith's single line is great. <br> speech between Rickert and Luca sounds amazing <br> Rakshas' lines are so much creepier than i imagined <br> FUCKING SILAT MOST AWKWARD AS SHIT WORDING WHOLE SCENE LOSES ALL DRAMA. </br></br></br></br>   it's a Rickert chapter   <br>NOOOOOOOOOOOO I'M STILL FINISHING TO READ IT <br><br>DELETE</br></br></br>  <br>no you kidding?<br><br>holy shit I'm going to kill Miura I swear</br></br></br>  <br>  "Ah, that's too bad..." <br> "Separation with your family, it's so hard and lonely, but you don't have to worry." <br> "Even if you disappear, your family will be taken good care of under the protection of the Falcon in this city." <br> "Your family will live without any problem." <br> "So, please go without having any regrets." </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see </br>  <br>Meant for </br>  fuck yes. Silat and Rickert team up, will eventually team up with Guts and crew. Now we just need a few more cute girls to join them.<br><br>What should Guts' new crew be called?</br></br>  <br>Band of the Wolf.</br>  <br>and then they all die. <br>In a brutal way in front of guts. Can't have to many happy moments in berserk.</br></br>  <br>Feels good to have a large dick and have manga characters stare at in awe.</br>  <br><br>Thanks brahs. I´m so hyped holy shit.</br></br>  <br> Naming your band after your own personal demons </br>   Trying to read this shit on a messy korean website in korean <br><br>Just be patient you morons. You cant be that eager to read the next chapter. Its like buying a console game on day one.</br></br>  So Griffith didn't even give a fuck he was slapped. He was just amused over the type of man Rickert has become.  <br> guts personal demon is a wolf <br>Nigga.</br></br>  <br>Its depicted as a bloodthirsty wolf-beast anon. Its not just the armor, guts is half mad.</br>  <br>Griffith a best</br>  <br>Its a hellhound, its been stated in the manga several times, in the DH translations.</br>   moeshit the manga   <br>Miraculous magic, son.</br>  <br> waiting that long just to get disappointed <br><br>Nothing very relevant happens anyway and the art looks shittier than the previous chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>Miura is really overusing these silly faces as of late.</br>  <br>I really hope that's Erica protecting her meat.</br>   guts steps off boat <br> shit, felt like that ride lasted 10 years. </br>  <br>Literally could not be more wrong.</br>  guts' spirit animal isn't a wolf, it's a dog. Difference  <br>Miura's true calling is a comedy manga.</br>  How long have they been on that boat now, anyway?<br>Ive honestly forgotten what it's like to have Berserk plot progress.</br>  <br>In our time or in manga time? Cause it's been probably a a few months by now. for Guts.</br>  <br>It's been about 8 years since they've gotten on the boat.</br>  How long did Miura take to release chapters on average before he started getting lazy?  <br>Fuck me we still get more of this bullshit. There is no stopping the boat.</br>  <br> lazy <br><br>He worked himself sick before. It's not out of laziness but for the good of his own health. Though I admit, with all the assistants he probably has now, there really isn't an excuse not to have at least 1 chapter every 1-2 months.<br><br>Berserk used to be a weekly series when it started.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it is</br>  Rickert is going to be so fucking hot when he gets older.  <br>Bullshit the chapter that shows them sailing was published on november 2009. So it was "only" 5+ years</br>  <br>He already is.</br>  <br>goddamn man, show some respect. Thats like saying a terminal cancer kid will look better when hes older.<br><br>it just aint happening any way you look at it</br></br></br>  <br>Erica is a lucky whore</br>  <br>Yes, 5 years ago.<br>In America.<br><br>The Episode was published in 2007 in Japan.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Rickert's voice in the anime </br>  <br> bloodthirsty wolf-beast anon <br>It's just a dog bro</br></br>  <br>He definitely attractive now, but he's still a bit on the effeminate side cause he's still a teenager. When he's more around 18~20 he'll be at his prime.</br>  <br><br><br>Fuck off fags. Stay in your containment threads.</br></br></br>  <br>Who woulda thought</br>  <br>such as?</br>  <br>If fags can wank over Griffith in every thread, I can enjoy Rickert.</br>  <br>The fuck you're talking about nigger? he's gorgeous.</br>  <br>The daily fujoshit/fag general.</br>   not arrived Elf Island <br>fuck</br>  <br>THANK YOU BASED KIMICHI</br>  <br>/a/ consists of fags and little girls. In general, we all love the cock, so how about you fuck off to your containment board?</br>  <br> Implying I'm not a little girl </br>    <br>No. You are just a loud minority just like the faggots in real life. <br><br>Don't complain about people bitching about you when you post your shit outside of your containment threads. It's the price you pay for having a cancerous general.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Its just a drawn character guys. It cant get older, only have a new model.</br></br>  <br>He's implying that Rickert is going to die, retard.</br>  <br>But he won't.</br>  <br> gender <br> other [15] </br></br>  <br>When everything is said and done and only death and destruction remains. Rickert will still be there, narrating how shitty everything is. He's essential.</br>  <br>I think Rickert has been my favorite character since taking over for Godo.</br>  <br>Those polls are probably made by the mods themselves. It's no secret that they're massive tumblrinas.</br>  <br> posting statistics <br><br>Get a load of this /v/irgin.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Miura's line weight is dead.</br></br>  <br>Well his mask is pretty similar to a skull, I'd be surprised if he's not related somehow.</br>  <br>Berserk is a slow manga. <br> and the art looks shittier than the previous chapters <br>It's exactly the same. It looks messy because of the scans. Miura's art style has been evolving. The characters look more cute and it's not only Luca.</br></br></br>  <br>It's been looking like this since volume 22.</br>  <br>Silat and the Bakiraka wouldn't have survived the war if they sucked, also Rakshas can seemingly just slink away whenever he wants to evade death.</br>  <br>I was surprised to see how big the cloak gets, it's like he's some amorphous shape-shifter.</br>  Where's the fucking boat.  <br>Is he an Apostle or not? Judging by , he seems to be more of an experiment of Ganishka's than anything else.</br>  <br> evolving <br><br>*devolving<br><br>Guts also looks worse now. He has a short stubby nose and no jaw.</br></br></br></br></br>  Jesus fuck that last page. So many things tried to be pressed into one small chapter.<br><br>Also, what a big art style change.</br></br>  <br>He's the wild card clearly, plans on killing Griffith at some point too.</br>  <br>I thought Silat was the wild card.</br>  <br>I don't see the problem. There were always panels that looked awkward.</br>  <br> Silat: "Is it the order of the Falcon himself, or is it a trick of that knight, Locus or whatever? Anyway, that boy seems to know the secret of the Falcon..." </br>  How do you feel about the fact that there will never be another arc as good as Tower of Conviction?  <br>Still on falconia SOL and looks like next month too<br><br>it will never ends</br></br></br>  <br>probably the same magazine is published in corea too, so they got it first and rip it without thinking about it too much</br>  <br>Honestly that is one of the coolest panels weave seen in while</br>  <br>I just want to know how it ends.</br>  <br> it ends <br>kek</br></br>  <br>Storys not over yet and theres still alot of interesting stuff to go through.</br>  <br>I'm too sad and tired to post reaction image.</br>  <br>HE'S NOT DEAD<br><br>His art seems to be getting worse though...</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's just the eyes, she looks like she has make up-</br></br>  What do anons do in their lives other than wait for new Berserk chapters?  <br>She had a longer and more defined face before.</br>  Can the tapasa beat lower level apostles?  <br>Nothing. Berserk is the reason I haven't killed myself yet.</br>  why the fuck is buying licensed berserk manga so expensive? Are they OOP?  <br> Rickert for example actually looks like Farnese. <br>I always wanted to fuck them both, this explains it.</br></br>  <br>Did she spawn from the eclipse?<br>Because she is such a  moral apostle </br></br>  <br> There was a guy during the battle between the black dog knights and the fugitive Hawks where one of the Hawks literally looked like Guts with a bandana <br><br>I think that was an error.</br></br></br>  <br>I like this arc. Everything Griffith related is good.</br>  <br>nigga</br>  <br>I derive pleasure from reading pleb level manga such as Attack on Titan and Seraph of the End.</br>  <br>I never liked how it looks in scans. I prefer Berserk with soft lines, not everything sharpened like that. It doesn't look like that in the actual volume, which is usually pretty small. <br>Those big scans actually do Berserk a disservice.</br></br>  <br>When he's 40 he will have the most magnificent mustache in all Midland and the greatest mane of hair known to man</br>  <br>I<br>T<br>'S<br><br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She just looks like that in this panel. Probably because of the angle.</br>  Hmmm...now that I am reading it properly Raksha seems pretty sketchy here.<br><br>Like he wants something from Rickert.</br></br>  WHY  <br>she got foxier<br><br>nice quads</br></br></br>  <br> pretty sketchy <br><br>HES GOT A FUCKIN KNIFE TO HIS THROAT<br><br>He said he wouldn't let any man harm Griffith, he's probably got to kill Rickert now or something to regain his honour.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her slutiness has leveled up to a whole new level.</br>  Why isn't the link working for me?  Enjoy Bagzerk while it lasts friends.  What in tarnashen was this shit? So fucking short. Does Miura know what monthly means?   He dropped Jerome <br><br>Yeah fuck you too Miura.</br></br>  <br>Moeshit killed Berserk.</br>   100 pages   <br>At least we won't see him die horribly.</br>  <br>new game+</br>  Has Miura ever explained why he's never drawn a map of his world?  <br>I would love to have this as my job.</br>  <br><br>Anyone else can't wait until Guts starts hacking every fucking arrogant piece of shit Apostle to pieces?<br><br>It's all I'm waiting for.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His art is at top what the fuck is wrong with all of you?</br>  <br>No, that's boring.</br>  <br>And yet he was drawing her on model last year.</br>  <br>It's a tradeoff. He has gotten better at drawing architecture but worse at drawing people.</br>  <br> He has gotten better at drawing boats <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Treason's the worst of all sins since it's what the Devil did.</br>  <br>that panel of locus looked pretty shit</br>  <br><br><br>so this is the best japan has to offer in terms of artists?<br><br>this is pathetic. The average Cal Arts student here can do this level. <br><br>Jap art has a long way to go, I see</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about the count's daughter ?</br>  <br>I go into cryogenic camera and sleep until the next chapter is out.</br>  <br>So can you recommend a comic with art and amount of content on par with Berserk?<br>I'd love to check it out.</br></br>  <br>Bait harder, retard.</br>  I don't get it, she looks the same as always. The whole group of prostitutes actually.  <br>Nah the best japs have to offer is probably Vagabond. <br><br>Anyway there's a big difference between drawing like 50 scenes minimum in a week/month and drawing a single scene in a week</br></br></br>  I ship them.   Berserk is now Digimon  <br>I hate this. When will the old good Berserk come back?</br>  <br>It's probably the problem with recent scans, but nowadays Vagabond looks pretty mediocre.</br>  <br>Actually I notice that Miura isn't drawing with as much detail throughout a chapter like he used to.<br><br>I'm not saying his art has degraded, I'm just under the impression that he saves his effort for more important panels as of late.<br><br>He's also drawing everyone with bigger eyes and rounder features.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>literally any superhero comic<br><br>are you fucking blind?</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are definitely some chapters with less detail, I agree. This one for example. Miura loves his architecture and landscapes and this chapter was very human focused.</br>  <br>Same. There's that one doujin where they fuck, though its only one small part.

They would spend it but it would keep coming back to them and they wouldn't really think anything of it. They'd keep spending it over and over, distracting themselves from their goals with services and things.
