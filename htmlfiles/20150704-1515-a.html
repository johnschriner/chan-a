[ What is it with this show that seems to attract so many fujoshis?<br><br>I didn't notice any real undertones that would illicit such a reaction. Is it just projection?<br><br>It's a good series though.</br></br></br></br>  Male characters.<br>Every show with male characters is a fujoshi show, just like every show with female characters is a yuri show, no matter how much non-shippers don't want to accept it.<br><br>You don't need "undertones," you literally just need characters. That's what shipping is about, characters' personalities, not whether or not the series they are in has any romantic or sexual themes at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Because while you and I see Kircheis as Reinhard's bro for life, the fujoshi see him as Reinhard's fucboi. <br>Some people just like gay guys.</br></br>  Handsome men doing handsome things.  I finally watched this movie today after putting it off for two years now.<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? <br><br> No seriously Bravo Gen BRAVO. I actually rather enjoyed this. Homu is still best meguca....prove me wrong faggots....PROVE ME FUCKING WRONG!  </br></br></br></br>  Go away  4th movie/2nd season fucking when?  <br>Dear diary today OP was not a faggot for once in his miserable life</br>    <br>But op i cant prove what is completely true. Based op for starting thread about best girl. Give me more homu!</br>  Homuhomu  <br><br>OP Here...I'll post more Homu.</br></br>  Best    <br>Beat girl. Best legs</br>  <br> while(rebellion happened?){ <br> printf("I watched Rebellion\n"); <br> printf("wtf was that\n"); <br> } <br><br>No wonder Homu gone mad in her loop. /a/ also gone mad either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    The fun of Rebellion is that there's a lot to read into, and nearly all of the stuff that doesn't seem to sense or comes out of nowhere actually has an explanation you can assemble.  Rebellion is the End of Evangelion of anime.  Reminder that Homu did literally everything wrong.  <br>You're a sick homusexual.</br>  Rebellion ruined homu a bit for me. While still my favorite, it made her actions seem a bit stupid and out of character. I'm not complaining since it still was entertaining  Homura is worst girl along with Sayaka. Madoka,Mami and Kyoko are best.  <br> liking Mami <br> liking useless characters <br>Ok dude.</br></br></br>  <br>low tier baito</br>  Stop asking stupid questions in the OP and post Homu.  <br>Or just simply my actual opinion? I'm not even saying anything so bad, or at least explain it to me</br>    <br>Also, please remember turning into a witch drives you insane.</br>  <br><br>Great pic. I will never undestand these faggots saying she was out of character in Rebellion.</br></br>  <br>I get it, but my point of view was only that I liked the sweet&amp;sour ending of the anime, and just her remembering madoka. But true, saying it was out of character was wrong of me</br>  <br>It wasn't out of character. Sill, before the movie was out, I was hoping Homura would undergo some character growth and get over her Madoka obsession, at least enough not to go down this path. In hindsight, it was naive to expect something like that from someone like Urobuchi.</br>  <br> spend nearly a decade trying to save someone and getting to know them <br><br>Her "getting over" Madoka would be unrealistic. She felt as attached to her as she would to a family member. She did what she set out to do, protect Madoka and ensure that she can live a safe and happy life. I respect the hell out of her for that.</br></br></br>  <br> Her "getting over" Madoka would be unrealistic <br>That depends on the execution, really. It wouldn't be unrealistic if handled properly.</br></br>  Daily reminder that Homura is preventing you from fucking Madoka.  <br>I find it really funny that almost every day someone finishes watching the movie and posts a thread in a very similar format to this.</br>  <br>Maybe. I'm perfectly fine with how it turned out though.</br>  Hom-Hom  <br>I'm fine with it too, provided they don't ruin it in a sequel. Frankly, now that they drove Homura this far, I'd like things to stay like this, no matter how fucked up the world might be.<br><br>But the movie was a bit of disappointment when I first watched it, to be honest.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just their excuse to start a tripfag/image dump thread.</br>  <br>I like posting images. I just need new ones.</br>  <br>Yeah, I could easily see a sequel fucking things up if not very well.<br><br>Also<br><br> No matter how fucked up the world might be.  <br><br>What makes you say the world is "fucked up?" Aside from some weird aesthetic changes her new universe seems pretty alright.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He said might.</br>  <br>Why don't you just go on Pixiv or Danbooru?</br>  <br>*if not handled very well</br>  <br>Reasons. Don't worry about it.</br>  <br>I worded that wrong. I'm still curious as to what would give him that impression.</br>  <br>Whatever then.<br>What images are you looking to save?</br></br>  <br>Perhaps it's the way Homura handled the megucas, you know, the tea cup, the apple, Sayaka getting clapped, the ending with the half world.<br><br><br>Any really.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine.</br>        Damn. I need a PC for webms.    <br>Oh well.</br>  <br>Never fails to have me chuckle.</br>    <br> Rebellionfags </br>          <br>The half moon symbolizes the duality between Homura and Madoka iirc.<br><br>But I think I misunderstood. For some reason I thought you meant the universe itself was physically unstable. How well Homu's universe will turn out is anyones guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes I know, but I think it's fucked because the moon and the world should be whole. That's me though.<br><br> I thought you meant <br><br>I'm not the other person.</br></br></br></br></br>     homu is the best <br><br>I think you mean Sayaka. Homushit ruined everything</br></br>  <br> Homu is still best meguca....prove me wrong faggots....PROVE ME FUCKING WRONG! </br>  <br>Homura's world doesn't follow the same rules as the previous one.</br>    When the melon breaks, it creates a sweet dream.     1. Got my new Homu merch <br> 2. Listened to Kimi no Gin no Niwa <br> 3. Opened /a/(despite not going here for a while) and thinking that "if there is going to be a Homu thread on a top of the frontpage, It will be a miracle <br> mfw there was </br></br></br>  <br>Weird, I just finished doing the exact same thing.<br><br>That scene where they first all transform was frigging beautiful. When you know who's coming last, and how her music sets herself apart.</br></br></br>    <br>No. Homu best girl. You just have shit reading comprehension. Not surprising for a Sayakafag.</br>  <br>In Homu's new world Homu will make sure Mami ends up foreveralone and unable to do a single push up.</br>    <br>Mumi pls.</br>  <br>Her head is going up.</br>  <br>Raped people have no voice.</br>    <br>Ok then i'll say it. <br><br>auuugh! No fighting!</br></br></br>  <br>I liked that doujin where Homu tied Mami up with her own ribbons</br>  <br>I didn't hear anything. <br>What could it possibly mean?</br></br>  <br><br> BULLIED   CHILDREN  detected</br></br>    <br>I was never raped. Something is wrong with your ears and your dub dubs are lying to you.</br>  <br>How do you know?</br>  Homu let loose AI YO.  <br>damn this art syle looks really famliar but I cant put my tounge on it.</br>  <br/>  <br>I thought Saotome was Sayaka.</br>  <br>G-Senjou no maou reference<br><br> Get it?

I imagine it would have sounded something somewhat like a bitch nigga.</br>   Witch  meguca wud u fug?  <br> Are you implying i'm a bitch nigga? <br><br><br>I'd  h ug Ophelia.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I changed my post mid-way, but forgot to delete &gt;</br>  Mami a best    So, I got myself these awesome posters from Plamoya that exceeded expectations. So great they are, that I'm actually going to put in in frames and build and altar around it, with candles and spider lilies and figures and other items.<br><br>I mean, around Homu one, at least. I don't really care about Madokami(she came together with Homu), but I suppose I'll keep her  as a pet  and hang her upside down below or opposite Homu<br><br>What sort of frame color would be best? Also, should I chose wooden or steel?</br></br></br></br>      God this card.  <br>Shittiest doujin I've ever seen.

Also double dubs checked</br>  <br>you're in denial, it was a condom and she was chewing it on the balcony, no doubt after sex</br>  <br>i succedet in having a luced dream with homura once. pic related, thats how sho looked</br>  <br>Why is homu so wide?</br>  <br> suddenly remembering my dream <br><br>F-fuck you!</br></br></br>  <br>This is, no doubt, a message of Fate to me<br><br>I don't know what that means, but for now I decided to spend more time in these threads</br></br></br>  <br>I had lucid dreams with Homu too, but it was a while ago<br><br>I don't remember much now, but I'm pretty sure these were nightmares. <br><br>Anyway, now that I have a Homu pillow(hopefully) more dreams will follow</br></br></br></br></br>  Are the Madoka recap movies good  <br>Also only a sick pervert would look at a freeze pop like if it was a condom. Must be rough since used condom are all you eat.</br>  <br>Some parts were changed, some added, some deleted. Just watch them.</br>  <br> She's been trying to give Madoka a happy life for years <br>At the end of the tv series Madoka seems happy enough with her choices. The idea that she's not, was first introduced in the movie. If they didn't introduce that plot point, instead of making Madoka happy, Homura's journey could have been about learning to accept that Madoka was already happy.<br><br>Portraying character growth properly is never easy. If done well though, it can result in some pretty awesome developments.</br></br></br></br>  Wow you guys are so perverts. Kyouko is just next to me now and she's disgusted.  <br>Sorry, but entire /a/ used to call her "condom-chan" before her character was introduced</br>    <br>They are worth watching</br>  <br>I know.</br>  <br><br>What merch ya get anon?</br></br>  <br>she just sat on my chair and looket at me with that look...i ditnt know what she would do (either she was gonna kill me or have sex with me) so i got so nervous that i woke up...</br>  <br>But letting go of something that was so important to her, would be against Homura's entire character, which was the point of the movie</br>  <br>For a first time view of the series i would say watch the 12 episodes then rebellion. Just to get the full story. Then anytime you want to re watch the show the 3 movies work well</br>  <br>Sorry bro, that's a phantom.</br>   enter thread <br> save all homu's <br> ignore everything else <br> leave </br></br></br>  <br><br>Other then aforementioned posters, I also got myself a clock, some sleeves and a 45x45 pillow with Homu<br><br>Good stuff.</br></br></br></br>    <br> the 3 movies work well <br>That's exactly what I want to do. Don't feel like watching the whole series again</br></br>    <br>She's in my bed. Just next to me, peeping my tablet's screen.</br>  <br>Gohan's a big guy.</br>  Post more lewd meguca.    <br>Hey, I do the same!</br>  <br>Poor you. She is petting my cat as we speak.</br>     &gt;Tulpa people ITT     <br>You speak as if the movie were some fanfic. It's the sequel. If it explicitly says Madoka's unhappy, she's unhappy. Regardless of what it you can infer she may have felt previously in the series.</br>      <br><br>I've got GSC's scale figure (you are not alone version) coming, hope it's worth the $210 I paid.</br></br>    <br>Homura's not a robot programed to do this no matter what. She's doing it because she has put an unreasonable value in Madoka, while lacking self-esteem herself.<br><br>It's not impossible to make her undergo character growth, and it wouldn't go against her entire character if done properly. To begin with, part of the reason Homura's so hung up on Madoka is her lack of self-esteem. A movie or tv series about Homura's character growth would of course need to tackle those issue first.</br></br></br>      <br> You speak as if the movie were some fanfic. It's the sequel. If it explicitly says Madoka's unhappy, she's unhappy. Regardless of what it you can infer she may have felt previously in the series. <br>You missed the point. Of course now that movie is out, whatever it was said there is canon. I was talking about how I would have wanted things to go before the movie was out. How I hoped the movie would have been. That kinda thing.</br></br>  I have a suspicious feeling that the events of the third movie will cause Gretchen to appear.<br>But I can't quite tell why...</br>    <br> petting my cat </br>  <br>was in tokio in april...200€ for all</br>  <br>Calm the fuck down with that yuri, there.</br>    <br>Rebellion was kind of made because Madoka was popular, the original was never intended to have a sequel. That's why they made the movie recaps, it's kind of like another loop or something. Devil Homu is interesting development, I think they want her to become a scary legend among the fan base. It feels like it puts the story at a dead end though, so it's easy to just ignore it as a non-canon what-if.</br>      Why is Kyouko best you ask? It's simple,  she just is. <br><br><br>Haha, very funny, Madokami.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Mami is a shit...she's one of the reasons Homu pretty much kept suffering the whole time. <br><br><br><br>OP Here, Glad to have been at your service. <br><br><br><br>Lick her feet?

Is the movie worth watching, and is AO worth watching? I've heard people didn't like AO that much.  absolutely, Fleur a cute   movie <br> AO <br>These don't exist.</br></br>  Just be content with the first series and get out while you can. All that awaits you further down this path is despair.  <br>Movie's iffy; you'll either think it was okay or walk away disappointed.<br><br>There is no sequel, though.</br></br></br>  <br>I loved the movie more than the first series, but YMMV. It is a bit different &amp; many felt that it was a betrayal of the series. And I thought AO was a trainwreck.</br>  The movie is decent but is fluff crap that has little to do with the plot, AO shits on the original plot  <br> I just finished Eureka Seven and really enjoyed it <br>I can only bring myself to believe this if you watched it with Japanese audio.</br></br>  The movie is alright but don't watch AO.<br>E7 is one of my favorite series. <br>I've heard such bad things about AO that I don't want to take any chances.</br></br>  <br>I actually watched the dub since there was dual audio but no subtitles and I couldn't be assed to find them. It was a good dub.</br>  <br>...Whatever you say<br><br>Well, anything and everything you ever loved about E7 whatsoever is destroyed before your very eyes. I'll leave it at that.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was good as well.<br>I've watched both the dub and sub, I can't see why people hate the dub so much unless they're just shitposting.</br></br>  <br> I can't see why people hate the dub so much <br>For the same reason as any dub ever: any emotion in the voices is either sucked right out or forced right in.</br></br>  <br><br> mfw AO <br><br>you have no idea what it is like going from E7's ending to AO, It is a good thing you didn't end up watching AO like me... The only way to wash down AO was to rewatch E7 and force myself to believe it is not canon. Do not make my mistake.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They did a good job though.</br>  <br>Happens in another universe. Not canon at all. Renton and Eureka and lots and lots of kids and the next series should have been a high school comedy with Anemone's and Eureka's kids in high school.</br>  E7 is actually a terrible franchise full of awful things, but the main show itself is superb.<br><br>Resist the temptation to watch the movie/sequel/read the manga, it's not worth it. Trust me.</br></br>  <br>Shamploo, this, and The Big O are really the only dubs I can stand, with the latter actually being more preferable in English.<br><br>How shit is my taste?</br></br></br>  <br><br>AO is not canon in the slightest, it's just a shitty Captain Earth prototype (which was also terrible) with E7 characters slapped on - the original spirit and atmosphere of Psalms is completely absent so it may as well just not exist at all.<br><br>It is an affront and a violation and nobody should even acknowledge it's existence.</br></br></br></br>  AO is abdolute trash  <br> it's just a shitty Captain Earth prototype <br>I am convinced that Bones had another show in mind when they made AO.</br></br>  <br>Same, I'm too scared to watch that thig. But I read some things on the wiki and oh my god.</br>  <br><br>They clearly did because E7 and Captain Earth are similar in two many areas to count.<br><br>If anybody truly wanted an E7 sequel they would found out what people liked about it and replicated that again, people might have called it a rehash but compared to the retarded shit in its place, that would have been ideal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Champloo has a great dub, I didn't watch Big O so no comment, I hated E7's dub, so I'd say you're a mixed bag.</br>  <br>I wonder how the sex went. I imagine Anemone likes it rough.</br>  <br> I said Shamploo and uou didn't call me a faggot for messing up <br>Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br> the next series should have been a high school comedy with Anemone's and Eureka's kids in high school <br>Bravo shipper</br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with shipping m8, they're canon.</br>  <br>I thought you did that intentionally. Shampoo? Champloo? That joke isn't rare.</br>  Just finished watching E7 myself, thought it was great. No one seems to discuss the show itself beyond it was good-masterpiece and rather just complains about the shit sequels.<br><br>From searching the archives I decided that watching anything other than the main series will ruin it, so fuck that.</br></br>  <br>You don't know the pain of having an OTP that was canon for like five minutes until somebody had the nerve to die.</br>  I honestly thought the manga wasn't that bad.  New chapter out. <br>Yui is going to get rejected isn't she.</br>   It was all a dream   Was going to say first blood, but then I realized Marika already confessed.  So now all the bitches but Chitoge will confess and the faggot will reject them one by one.<br>Then Chitoge will come out with the classic "i loved you since the beginning" and there you go, this shit is over.</br>  The culling of the harem begins. Haru and Tsugumi are already out, and now Yui's terms is coming to an end.<br>Marika and Onodera are all that remain, and then we can be off of Komi's ride.</br>  Of course she's gonna get rejected, you think Komi's gonna let us of that easily?<br><br>My question is: is she gonna somehow be able to stay in Raku's house or this is the arc where she goes away for good?</br></br>  <br>When was Tsugumi rejected?</br>  <br>She's probably going to accept that he doesn't love her that way and marry the other guy.<br>I'd imagine she'll find out that Raku has a crush on Onodera though, as that will probably be his reason for being unable to answer her feelings.<br>That might lead to some interesting developments.<br><br>She wasn't, but she accepted Raku as a worthy man for Chitoge, which I took to mean that she was also bowing out to support their romance, despite having lingering feelings.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think that she will marry the guy. Ie is probably going to give her a more time or something along those lines.</br>  <br>So basically a "Let me think about this" from Raku? <br>It would make sense, since that's exactly how he's treating the situation with Marika.</br></br>  OP's obviously talking about OreGairu, f4gg0t5.  <br> incest </br>  <br>Yukino a shit. A SHIT!</br>  <br>I don't think WSJ will allow the incest.<br><br>They will probably forcible break her away from her little brother ;_;</br></br></br>  How far into the manga does the anime go?  <br>But its not?</br>  <br>Probably about half of the material has been animated. There's still a shit load of material left, but nothing really happens so it's fine.</br>  <br>They are not blood-related though. Also on Raku views her as a sister, Yui doesn't view him as a brother but as love interest.</br>  I think Kosaki has better genes. She's the better breeding girl.  <br>Chitoge has superior Aryan genes.</br>  <br>I can't wait to see how Komi will make it all return to nothing next week.</br>  <br>Kosaki has better blushing genes.<br><br>It allows 26% more efficient breeding than Chitoge.</br></br></br>  <br>Enjoy children with frail bones and weak muscles who are also 5 feet tall at their peak.</br>  <br> Not accepting Chitoge with Aryan master race genes </br>  <br>Fuck off tumblerfag.</br>  <br><br><br>Isn't Chitoge a halfie?</br></br></br>  <br> Liking disgusting gaijin genes. <br> Not choosing superior NIPPON genes <br><br>It's like you're trying to be a heretic</br></br></br></br>  <br>:^)</br>  <br>Even so, Adelt is Aryan while Hana is Japanese. Literally perfect</br>  <br>chapter 105 without counting skipped chapters</br>  <br>I thought Komi was going to milk this arc a lot longer. Didn't expect the confession this fast</br>  <br> Then   Onodera  will come out with the classic "i loved you since the beginning" and there you go, this shit is over.</br>  i mean, we always give crap that nothing ever happens in nisekoi, but i think in this chapter something actually happened  <br>FUCK THIS MANGA OH MY GOD! FUCK THIS SHIT.</br>  <br>Did anyone expect chitobae to lose though?</br>  Place your bets<br> it was all a dream <br> Sorry? Could you repeat that? <br> raku thinks she's using him to get out of her other marriage offer <br> raku loses his memory somehow </br></br></br></br>  <br>See you next week, nice quads btw faggot<br><br/></br></br>    <br> The wedding arrangements somehow get cancelled <br> it was a lie all along; Ie only tried to force Yui to make a move <br> back to status quo like this arc never happened <br> this series will never progress </br></br></br></br>  Is this actual progression in Nisekoi? Or will we get an it was all in her mind scene next week?  <br>I came.</br>  <br>Remember the date with Onodera with the Christmas tree and imminent danger of the locket getting trashed? How'd that turn out?<br> No progress. </br></br>  <br>I won't be surprised if this happened to the letter but Yui already confessed. I want to know what happens with Raku.</br>   Nanchatte   Yui is going to be rejected.<br>There's just no way around that.</br>  <br>I'm going for a ''give me time to think''.</br>  These last several chapters feels like the author is beginning to finally stop dicking around and beginning to to move shit forward. <br><br>Raku is realizing his feeling for Chitoge<br>Raku is realizing he's using Marika and need to respond to her feelings<br>Girls with the least chance of winning starting to confess (gotta get them out of the way first)<br><br>Assuming this isn't "Lol everything reverts back to the status quo in the next chapter" I see the manga ending sometime early next year.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would agree since he already wants to give Marika an honest answer but the problem is that she has a 7 day deadline. This is forcing Raku to actually think about each girls' feelings carefully rather than putting it off like he always has.<br><br>My bet is for <br><br> Anyone want any transparencies/crops made from this chapter? If not then I'm going to just catch up on Summer season. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get the feeling he's aiming to end on Chapter 200.</br>  <br>I would call bullshit but with the way chitoge was thinking about how she needs to grow up I think what is going to happen is that it will actually get to an end guessing 200 chapters</br>  <br>He'll have fallen asleep standing up with his eyes open and not have heard her.</br>  <br>200 is too soon. i'd say 250</br>  How to breed 2 animals 101:<br>Step 1: Put them in the same cage.<br>Step 2: Wait.<br><br>This is effectively what happened with Raku and Chitoge. Their parents wanted them to get together so they just put them in a situation where they have to spend nearly all of their time together.<br><br>Now it's only a matter of time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Genetically speaking Chitoge truly is the superior girl.</br></br>  <br>Wrong. You mean Kosaki.</br>  <br>But what about that effect that people keep bringing up in those incest threads. The one that says people who grow up spending all their time together never view each other sexually.</br>  <br>obviously</br>  <br>Raku has no recollections of the 10 years ago thing. Therefor that is a moot point.<br><br>At this point they are two hormone empowered teenagers that are both physically attracted to each other and spending all of their time together. It's a ticking time bomb.</br></br></br>  <br><br>nah, have a look at THESE genes</br></br>  Season 3!  <br><br> Not wanting your offspring to be an olympian level athlete with valedictorian tier academic ratings <br><br>nah</br></br></br></br>  Let's all come together and love Lain.  You mean like a gangbang?  Sorry op looks like everyone else is too busy re-watching lain today  <br>I actually did rewatch it yesterday. I'm putting together a VERY-revised final theory (I'm the anon who summarized the PSX game a couple of weeks ago) that I'll post here whenever. After having read Lain's Diary, I actually teared up at that final episode.</br>  Why do she tie her rat-tail of a hair like that? Did she think she was some special little snowflake? Goddamn insufferable  <br>Something to do with a Japanese good luck type thing having to do with left and right iirc. It's a symbol like her bear stuff.</br>  Lain is a Goddess  <br>that sounds good<br> mfw /a/ is not total shit sometimes <br>also checked</br></br></br>    <br>Ganbaru</br>  <br>Who is this "honest man", and why doesn't he understand? What is the meaning of the OP?</br>  <br>You'll have to ask Jasmine Rodgers</br>  I can dump artbook/fanbook/upload bootleg program/songs if anyone would want that  Why did Lain kill herself in the video game?  I guess I'll just post the first few pages of the artbook.  Is it wrong that I find Lain oddly sexual?  <br>yes please</br>    <br>Because she was alone in the real world. She is an introvert who has difficulty making friends. She didn't have any friends, her parents left, and the comfort she found was on the Wired. She killed herself to "connect" with everybody. I take this as her returning to her "essence" as an omnipresent being, abandoning her sentience.</br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>Though considering she's omnipresent on the internet, she's probably watched you masturbate more times that she can count.</br></br></br>  <br>Anything in particular you want? I am working on an upload of bootlegs disk for some friends, so I guess I will post the link once that's done. The artbook is 50mb and the fan guide is 500mb<br>The game from bootleg is fairly small and I can probably upload that after the disk if people just want that and not the music</br></br>  <br> more times that she can count <br> she <br>I don't think anyone has masturbated that much ever.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you by any chance figured out how to run the minigame on disk 2 of BOOTLEG without the actual disk?</br>  Despera when?  <br>Is that fan guide the one that's on the internet already or the english (I assume) one that came with the limited bluray box (It's called Serial Experiments Lain Inside, or something like that).</br>  <br>I always thought it was Lain talking to the viewer, although I wouldn't put it past them to have just put the OP as some western song for the fuck of it without a reason.</br>  <br>I have the actual disk, so I have the game extracted, I have sent it to some friends and it worked for them I think. The game is pretty cool, you can dress lain up and shoot kumas, which I am doing now.<br><br>I'm not sure, I believe it was already on the internet, if you have a link I can tell you if it's the same or not. I think I downloaded this from thewired.info (that's what one of the pages says).<br><br>I can upload a few pages if you want</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>iirc Ueda said at Otakon 2000 that it was a combo of them liking the music and the lyrics being relevant. The album came out about a year earlier - it wasn't written for Lain. I'd recommend it by the way - Twilight by Boa</br>  <br>It'd be cool if you could upload what you've extracted of the game and I can see if it works. The BOOTLEG torrent I got with the stuff won't let me install without the disk.</br>    <br>Oh I know the song wasn't written for Lain, I was just alluding to the idea that maybe the creators of Lain used it as the OP to take the direction that it's Lain talking to us.</br>  <br>You haven't tried hard enough.</br>  <br>Uploading now</br>    <br><br>Yes, Lain is pure.<br><br> PURE, PURE! </br></br></br></br>    ETA is too long (file 260MB), I am going to just upload the game folder, hope that it works.<br><br>BOOTLEG folder is only going to take 10 minutes. I hope it works. Hopefully you don't get my data with it, because you are meant to unlock things</br></br>    <br>Alright, thanks for doing this</br>  <br>Hasn't worked yet. Not sure if it will, missing movie files and mp3's as well as screensavers and wallpapers which the game might need to use</br>    PRESENT TIME  Oh my, you can turn lain into an alien in the minigame. This made me jump for some reason<br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/w<wbr>mb0b4w3733fd8l/Bootleg.rar<br>Here is the file. I know downloading things linked on 4chan is a bad idea but I don't really have any way of showing that it's not a trick</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>And that's sexy.</br>    Also don't leave the face-counter thing open when playing kuma shoot because points will go down instead of up. Also if you open the "theater" thing that is default set to a classroom, you click the clock-bar thing to change scenes. If you have any other questions just ask.    <br>Oh goddamnit. I didn't realize you ran the game from the clock. I would have been able to do it had I known. Thank you for the upload though.</br>  <br>Haha, no problem. Have fun clicking kumas for ages</br>          <br><br> those feels </br></br>  <br> That part in the last episode where Yasuo says she doesn't need the bear suit for security anymore and she just breaks down into tears </br>  <br>Going to upload the comic just for you.</br>            <br>YOOO WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>I JUST STARTED IT YESTERDAY OUT OF CURIOSITY AND THIS THE FIRST TIME I EVER SEEN A THREAD FOR IT</br></br></br>    I watched all of Lain for the first time in one sitting earlier today. All I can say is that it was an experience. Had me thinking though, are we inching closer and closer to the wired?    <br>https://mebious.neocities.org/publi<wbr>c_html/matrix.html</wbr></br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck is happening?</br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean?</br>  <br>I kind of want a remake based on the video game</br>  <br>Spooky. I was looking up lain stuff yesterday too, which is what made me look for a thread.<br><br>Anyway. Back to artbook.</br></br></br>  <br> Had me thinking though, are we inching closer and closer to the wired? <br>It's already beginning, anon. The real world and the Internet are now analogous to one another. Who you are online is now who you are outside. As the integration of communicative technologies continues to progress at the rate it is now, humanity will only come closer together, if still physically separated.<br><br> PRESENT DAY. </br></br></br></br>  I want this art book, never really looked into Lain beyond the series and the OST / mix albums<br><br>that site, oh boy what am I doing</br></br>  So the opening just started playing in theater mode.... My points reset to 0 too, but I still have the sweater... Not sure if I should do it all again or not  <br>all these people watching and rewatching lain at once. what brought this about?</br>  <br>After you view the final location, the points all reset. I don't think there's anything else.</br>  <br>The collective desire to understand Lain<br><br>We all "[came] together and [loved] Lain" - hopefully that is.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, neat. I guess I'll keep going and see if it just repeats or if nothing happens.</br>  <br>Ah, scrap that, putting the school outfit on erased the sweater.</br>          What does Mika keep seeing in Lain's room?  http://fauux.neocities.org/login.ht<wbr>ml<br><br>is there even a way to get in, or is it just for show?</br></br></wbr>  <br>Do you mean her constant peeking? I noted that down on my rewatch as really suspicious, thinking she might be taking watch as part of her parents' job, but later on, it seemed very much apparent that Mika was totally confused about what was going on and likely only knew that Lain was going to be her new "sister". I'm thinking she was just cold to her because she had to live with her, and later, was weirded out and curious about Lain's new behavior.</br>  <br>Just show.<br><br>http://fauux.neocities.org/test.htm<wbr>l</wbr></br></br></br>    <br><br>And as for post-telephone Mika, Ueda said at Otakon 2000 that she went into the Wired and got stuck in a nether area between the real and Wired with the "help" of the Knights, so the beepy Mika is just a body and isn't her real self. It's possible the Knights used her as a spy.</br></br>    <br>I remember in the second episode, she notes she thought she saw Lain's imaginary friend in Lain's room, and then walks away. She was looking to the left. Later on in the same episode when Yasuo sets up Lain's new NAVI, she's seen again looking at the same spot in Lain's room. She's confronted by Yasuo and ignores him and walks away. This is never explored later on in the series and is just left as some random narrative anomaly.</br>    yeah, like a gangbang  <br>The Knights must have used her. I mean they forcibly tell her to "fulfill the prophecy" before her consciousness is taken from her physical body.</br>  <br>I think she might have just been mocking Lain's talking to her Navi since Lain is introverted. The second time looking at the same spot I never noticed. Might just be a coincidence.</br>  <br>is Lain a lesbian?</br>        <br>Oh man, just realized this is from Lain's diaries where she notices her gums are bleeding. Pretty cool that this illustrates some of the game's stuff. Never managed to really look through this artbook.</br>    <br> I think she might have just been mocking Lain's talking to her Navi since Lain is introverted <br>Ok that would make sense. I'm bad at picking up those sort of cues and tend to take things literally.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully some time before never.</br>    <br>It's a really hard series to do that with on an initial watch. It's a good idea to go through and take notes about specific little things after you've seen the whole thing first.</br>  ¿Lain? ¿a lesbian? hell no bruh    <br>I don't think so. That Alice stuff in the last episodes never seemed sexual to me. Her diaries show us that she had a crush on a boy at her school in the game's timeline.</br>  I watched lain last year and understood jackshit. Can someone spoonfeed me?   late night rewatch of Lain <br>Why is this somewhat relaxing? It gives me those old late night Yume Nikki vibes.</br>  Fan book is too large to upload so I'm making them smaller, hopefully this doesn't fuck the quality  <br>I agree, it definitely takes multiple viewings to full appreciate.</br>    <br>is the game canon?</br>    <br>Does the game add a lot to the show? Enough to warrant playing it?</br>          I found artbook in danbooru<br><br>https://danbooru.donmai.us/pools/15<wbr>55?page=1</wbr></br></br>  <br>Ok, here's a rough idea of what's going on. I'm still in process of writing a really detailed final conclusion. Ask about specifics if needed<br><br>Lain was some sort of force of the collective consciousness of all humans, either than or a software that Eiri created to be used to dissolve the border between the wired and real worlds (I tend to believe the former). Eiri makes her sentient somehow, and Tachibana takes her and gives her to her parents to watch over - they don't want Eiri's plan of worldwide connection to happen. The Knights and Eiri consistently try and make Lain believe that she is not needed in the real world so that she will initiate the final stage of Protocol 7 by rejecting her sentience. Eiri along with her introverted nature make her so lonely that she accepts herself as a program, and desires to connect to everyone abstractly. In the end, Alice convinces her that her sentience isn't bad, and she realizes and appreciates that though she wasn't originally human, she is now. Alice freaks the fuck out and Lain removes her memory from reality so that she never caused any of the trouble to happen. She becomes a spectator despite needing human connection, and gets really upset until she makes herself more comfortable by understanding that she can still visit other people because all memories exist at the same time rather than linearly. To love Lain is to understand her struggle as both a force and a human, and her bravery in becoming a spectator.<br><br><br>Yes, but it's a different timeline, with a different plot and outcome, though the behind the scenes happenings would seem to be the same (though they aren't mentioned hardly - the game is more about Lain as a human) - the info about Lain's personality and qualities I take as canon.<br><br><br>Yes. It'll make you understand and appreciate Lain's struggle more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nakamura is gone. It's not going to happen.</br>  <br>They got a new director.</br>  <br>Oh, that reminds me I have more pages from a seperate thing in another folder. I guess I'll post them after this</br>  <br>Unless people want me to post them first</br>  <br> Alice convinces her that her sentience isn't bad <br><br>Eck, that was worded weirdly.

I don’t need to hear that from you, Hikio.” <br><br> “R-Right…” <br><br> Waah… Miura-tan, you’re sooo scary… Miura glared at me for a moment, but eventually suppressed her sharp look and took another step. With a small voice as if making a rebuttal to me, she mumbled. <br><br> “It’s just… well… see, even including the annoying stuff,” said Miura, turning around as if making a spin. The hems of her coat and her glossy blonde hair lightly danced. Her body still turning in motion, she wore a slightly embarrassed grin. “I guess it’s okay, after all.” <br><br> I couldn’t help but be in awe when she said that with such a nice smile. To think you could state it so simply. It’s a pure aspiration exactly because it’s so simplistic, so concise and so straightforward. <br><br> For a short while, I watched that smile in a daze. When she noticed my gaze, Miura retracted her smile and briskly began walking in displeasure. <br><br> “Oh… with just that, it’s okay. So it was that simple…” <br><br> When I turned around to the muttering voice, Yuigahama was squeezing the bosom of her coat. Standing next to her, Yukinoshita was looking at Miura with a stunned expression. <br><br> However, it might not have been something to be surprised around. Even during the field trip, Miura had grasped Hayama and Ebina-san’s intentions. Perhaps, those soft emotions she had could even be called genuine… Don’t forget Miura-san was a holder of mother qualities, too! <br><br>Miura for genuine best girl!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still don't understand why Yukino would be at fault for this.</br>  <br>fuck commies</br>  <br>Wait, why do yo u have problems with my boy Hayama?</br>  <br>I don't know, you tell me</br>  <br>The Chinese word for "panda" can be literally translated as "giant cat bear"<br><br>So not only is it a bear, but a cat one too.

There is so many terrible fanbases on /a/. If I had to pick a worst I would probably say... Yuru Yuri. Which sucks because I like that show a lot.</br></br>    <br>Mine even had a loli and a transfer student in it. Good times, eh anon?</br>  How often does the main heroine lose in a rom-com?  <br>8man will become a bear.</br>  <br>Rarely, Yukino should be safe.</br>  I am honestly drawing a blank on Yukino's request. I can think of three possibilities:<br><br>  "Let me take some time away from the group to settle myself." <br>Which will probably end up being a mistake. I can see this one if there's definitely a volume 13.<br><br>  "Give me advice on my problems." After that she relates her whole history with Haruno, her mom, and maybe Hayato.  <br>I dunno how exactly it would work out, what advice she would get, etc.<br><br>  Some sort of request that involves trying to fix her strained relationship with Haruno. Who knows how it will be phrased exactly. <br>I think even if Yukino's dependency problem is totally resolved, she will still have a bad relationship with her sister. There's definitely an air between them that needs to be cleared. Haruno's comment that she and Yukino have never really fought is foreshadowing I think (and bizarre for siblings in my experience at least). They're due for a screaming match probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Main heroine that is a main romantic love interest rarely loses<br><br>Note that sometimes main love interest(s) arent necessarily main heroines</br></br></br>  <br>Could be something that ties into Hiki's request for something genuine. Maybe she asks everybody to do some soul searching <br><br>Could be anything but I think whoever "solves" the request of both Yukino and hachiman will be the winner of Sensei Contest</br></br></br>  <br> soul searching <br>Nigga how does one do that? I'm genuinely curious</br></br>  <br>When it's the main heroine and the MC's main interest almost never, but this isn't a romcom.</br>  <br>You go looking for souls, if you watched enough anime you should know this already</br>  Irohasu~  Will Yukino ever give Hachiman her cookies/chocolates?<br><br>Fuck Watari; we gotta wait half a year to find out if that happens and what Yuki's request is</br></br>  <br><br>My guess is she's going to give him her chocolates that very day the cliffhanger ended on.<br><br>Along with some sort of qualified confession like "I think I'm love with you but I don't if I'm just using you" or "I love you but I'm afraid I could be relying on you" and asking him to hold off giving her an answer until later when she's had time to sort things out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The contest is between Yukino amd Hachiman. <br><br>But with Hachiman's request, most likely, Yukino will win. If Hiratsuka doesn't play favourites, and she told Hachiman after her evaluation in the hallway, Hachiman is her favourite.</br></br></br>  Why exactly did Yukino and Hachiman end up idealizing each other?  <br>Sexual attraction</br>  <br>No, I don't think Yukino will give Hachiman cookies. Now, that they are conscious of her dependency and her "copypasta" tendencies.<br><br>I think Watari will make Yukino give Hachiman something else that doesn't mirror Yui giving Hachiman cookies.</br></br></br>  <br>Sensei included Yui in the contest once she joined the club, so she can't be ignored anymore in regards to that, not to mention she brought it up in the final scene.<br><br>I'm thinking Hachiman will win and that will be his time to decide between the two girls.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino might win, she has the advantage of two requests given specifically to her in the contest.<br>The first being Hiratsuka's to change Hachiman, the second being to find "genuine".</br></br>  <br><br>Giving chocolates on Valentine's day is so common in Japan Yukino doesn't really have to worry about "I am just copying Yui in giving cookies to Hachiman".</br></br>  <br>Hiratsuka mentioned that she wanted Hachiman to change Yukino when she was lecturing her about being genuine, she said it didn't have to be him, but she wanted it to be him.</br>  <br>They both saw each other as loners who were in similar situations but had different worldviews. But up until Ebin confession and StuCo, Yukino's perception of him changed and when genuine happened it changed again.</br>  <br>Hiratsuka and Haruno sure are pushing Yukino and Hachiman together a lot.<br>Hiratsuka tries to be subtle about by thowing in Yui but she keeps saying that he's doing it for Yukino.</br></br>  <br> Sensei included Yui in the contest once she joined the club <br>When? Yukino brought up the contest in episode three and Yui was completely dumbfound and Yukino had to tell Yui of Hiratsuka's contest. I don't recall Hiratsuka saying Yui is a contestant when she joined nor after Yukino told her. <br><br>And Hiratsuka evaluation was more or less directed at Hachiman and Yukino, her evaluation of Yui wasn't as critical when it came to Yui but she did tried to make Yui feel something with her "And you're the glue" line.</br></br></br></br>  Arguing about whether Yui is in Sensei's vague contest is pointless. She's in it if she wants to be.<br><br>The main thing is nearly everyone is agreement it's going to be won by either Hachiman or Yukino, with Hachiman the prohibitive favorite.<br><br>Though I think it's going to be Yukino. She'll solve Sensei's first request, she'll fulfill genuine. She'll probably get credit at the end for something else and Sensei will award it to Yukino. Hachiman will realize the whole thing was humorously rigged from the beginning.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, yeah. With chocolates it is different and I can agree with you there. <br><br>Except Yukino should opt out of the cookies, if she is smart enough to realize that giving Hachiman cookies is not good only for the fact with Hachiman's internal monologues, he is always linking events together, so I feel if Yukino give him the cookies regardless, Hachiman will have an internal monologue about Yui. Is what I was getting at.</br></br></br>  What would Hayama have done if Hikigaya wasn't there at the field trip?  <br><br>Do we know they're cookies in her bag? I mean she made them at home. They could be chocolates.<br><br>I guess Hachiman could overthink her giving cookies (it's certainly his style to do so) but I tend to think he would give her the benefit of the doubt on that at least. But who knows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hilariously confess to ebina</br>  <br>We don't even know if she had cookies in the bag since the package she had for the cookies was different, she obviously had something specially made for Hachiman.</br>  <br><br>Nothing. He group would have gotten strained and probably split apart. The nucleus would have stayed with Hayama and attracted new members with him never being blamed for anything.<br><br>That kinda shit has probably been going on his entire life.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have bro time with a sad Tobe.</br>  I suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.</br></br>  <br>I wonder what Yukino thinks of Orimoto, when she saw her on the double date she refused to acknowledge her existence.</br>  Irohasu ?  <br><br>Yukino showed up after Hayama had chewed them out didn't she? At that time did she even know about her "history" with Hachiman?<br><br>Though now that she does she might be thinking about that double date again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does she know 8man asked her out in the past? She knows Orimoto has history with 8man but I'm sure if she knew 8man liked her then she would see her as competition.</br>  At any rate since Orimoto is confirmed to be giving chocolate to 8man, she needs to do it somehow where the other girls will see it. Just for more jealousy points.<br><br>Although I think she'll stop by his house and give it to him. The act of receiving them from Orimoto of all people could cause Hachiman to monologue out some self-development.</br></br>  <br>I want to kiss[/spoiler] this cu tie. </br>  <br>Cry that he couldn't prevent another of his shallow circles break apart after things get a little bit rough and go to Haruno to watch her fuck strangers while he watches as consolation.</br>  <br>How do you even fuck that up</br>  <br>Well, duh. We don't know, even still, after the the threesome date it is still a possibility she MAY give Hachiman cookies or something else.</br>  <br>Haruno is pure<br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Bullshit, I used ctrl+s</br>  IROHASU!  <br><br>It's really pathetic that he couldn't fix it on his own.<br><br>All he'd have to do is ask Miura to figure out why Ebina would reject Tobe. That would get the whole "I don't want to be with anyone right now" answer. Then he'd tell Tobe that. Since it's from the worshipped Hayama, Tobe would surely believe it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What if Orimoto, after giving 8man chocolate in front of the girls, whispers in his ear   I can see you being a boyfriend <br>It would be nice to see her join his harem and force the other girls to make a move on him</br></br>  <br>I feel sorry for you. I have zero motivation to go through these threads and they keep piling up.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but considering she's just recently told him that he's still not 'boyfriend material' I find it doubtful.</br></br>  <br>Why do you even keep them up, it's all 90% shitposting anyway<br>How much RAM do you have, having that many tabs open on Chrome kills my computer</br></br>  <br> senpaai, is it ok for me to have the strawberry? <br> then I'll take it <br><br>Typesetter-kun, it's all yours.</br></br></br></br>  <br>get a better one, or more ram</br>  <br>Get in line nigga.</br>  <br>I think her view of him changed in 2.5 months, especially since she's giving him chocolate</br>  <br>Just download more RAM, it's free</br>  I don't want yukino to win, she does not deserve it, Yui has done more for Hikki and Iroha has much better chemistry with 8man.<br>Yukino doesn't deserve to win as much as the other 2.</br>  Irohasu~  <br><br>Yeah yeah love doesn't go to the most deserving.<br><br>Besides Yukino is probably going to get credit for the fulfillment of genuineness which will shatter everything else the other girls have done in Hachiman's mind</br></br></br></br>  <br> Wahh merits and chemistry matters in relationship <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4A3<wbr>pX_shcyU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>But she'll win anyway<br> and us Yukinofags will bathe in your tears </br></br>  At this point I don't think Yui or Yukino's love for 8man is healthy.<br><br>They both need character development to be contenders. Either that, or they need to be rejected and have character development that way.<br><br>In other words, nobody will win until they change.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Irohasu~<br><br><br>Wait, cuntkiller knows moon?</br></br></br></br>  <br> They both need character development to be contenders <br> In other words, nobody will win until they change <br>congratulations on discovering the plot of volume 12.</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha is life.</br>  <br>A have loads of shit open with 8GB.</br>  <br>Not him but that's not the only problem, the main problem is 8man himself. He's still a cynical and still was a loner mindset, he's not ready for a romance yet.<br>If volume 12 is the last one, then I don't see anything but a loner end.</br></br>  <br> tfw I have 6GB RAM but the rest is shit <br>I need to upgrade my computer<br>Nice specs</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see it that way.<br><br>He has gone far in getting away from his loner mindset, and look at all the times he's thought about "stepping over the line," especially in the context of Yui. I think he's perfectly set up to decided that he wants to take the step from friendship to romance with one of the girls by the end of the next book.</br></br></br>  Why does Haruno seem happy as fuck when she's with 8man? Is he really that fun to be around?  <br>His loner mindset is long gone, he doesn't want to be that way.<br>To him the loner end is now just a risk he's willing to take to achieve "genuine" with them.</br></br>  <br>He's entertaining. Much more intersting than the usual rabble she's around.<br><br>Basically she's a high class noblewoman who takes interest in the humble peasant due to how new and outside the norm he is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well he no longer embraces the loner lifestyle.<br><br>But I don't think he's quite shed that tendency to rationalize away people's affections. He hasn't accepted yet that he's someone people are capable of loving.<br><br>Someone needs to communicate that to him. Someone that he will reject first. My money is on  Iroha_ .</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll bet on my arse she won't cry after being rejected</br>  <br> Do we know they're cookies in her bag? <br>It is a mystery. Yukino reaction could be seen as regret for not giving Hachiman the cookies, or her refraining from giving Hachiman cookies (or, chocolates, whatever was in her bag) since Yui took the first initative.<br><br><br> I mean she made them at home. They could be chocolates. <br>Yeah, could be chocolates. Although, they made chocolates at the event, so would Yukino give Hachiman chocolates again? I mean, Yukino can always convey her chocolates as different than the meaning of the event chocolates "This isn't friendship/obligation" chocolates.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Early on they were similar in a lot of respects even if on the surface they are rather different. Even Yukino drew a comparison between them.<br><br>Now she's seeing him as striving for something she's given up on and it interests her. Well all that + he's a guy hanging around her sister a lot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's stepped over the line with Yui and Iroha this volume, especially Iroha if context of their scenes is taken in consideration, but that doesn't mean he's ready for anything. He's still seeking his genuine thing and knows that it might hurt people, and that doesn't need to be a romance.<br><br><br>Genuine doesn't mean romance. He still has a long way to go. Hell, he can't even straight up say that he acknowledges the girls' feelings.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He should just do it.</br>  <br>what even happened in this episode?<br>should i just go read the LN? i've been on a binge anyway. how redundant will it be?</br></br>  <br>He is a nice guy, and fun to hang out with</br>    <br>Bu he just stands there and makes awkward and cynical comments.</br>   Yuigahama is a nice girl <br> Yukinoshita is a strong girl <br><br>What is Iroha?</br></br></br>  <br> he just stands there and makes awkward and cynical comments <br>Aren't we all anon?</br></br>  <br> He hasn't accepted yet that he's someone people are capable of loving. <br>It's more than that.<br><br>He has lived his life so long never being attached to anyone that he himself is not sure if he's capable of loving someone. It's an unexplored territory. Something mysterious and alien.<br><br>For such a thing to be possible, mutual love with another human being, it's nothing but an ideal. But what if it were possible? What if you could truly love them to the point of absolute trust and confidence? What would you call such a thing? Something not based on necessity or illusion, but based on something real. Something genuine.<br><br>It's difficult to follow his mentality, especially when the answer seems so obvious to an observer, but 8man is a highschool student who's ignorant to all of this. He's still on the path to finding his answer.<br><br><br>A cute, hardworking girl with a playful personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Use one adjective anon, no bias</br>  <br>is in love with Hayama.<br><br>PS. These are things 8man mistook about the girls.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish, I had a friend like that in HS, all I had were clowns</br>  <br>sly</br>  <br>It's worth reading, definitely.<br><br>S1 left out a lot of amusing stories like 8man's "dates" with Totsuka that Zaimokuza kept crashing, playing strip Daihinmin, and 8man and Sensei's ramen date.<br><br>Reading the LNs will really help you understand the events of S2 better though. They really started compressing things after the StuCo election, and in general you get more of 8man's internal monologues which I think Feel tried and failed to express visually through things like the blushing in the infirmary scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're not all dark, tall and handsome.</br>  <br>C</br>  <br>a cute girl</br>  <br>He's fucking autistic and an edgelord<br><br>You tell me</br></br></br>  <br>I think what autism spectrum people don't seem to quite understand is that normal people don't actually hate them or dislike being around them. People acting weird is actually pretty fun any entertaining. Someone who's far enough on the spectrum to regularly do strange, embarrassing things is actually a treasure to normal people. They're an endless source of things to talk about and reminisces about and etc. It can sometimes be more like bullying. But most of the time it's actually entirely good natured and people will think of their crazy friend and his antics with fondness.</br>  <br>After hayama.<br>8man is mistaken all the time.</br></br>  <br>With romance, it is debatable, in my eyes. Genuine itself is still ambiguous to him and the characters, so it could mean either friendship or romance. Genuine is a relationship of some sort and hopefully volume twelve clear the ambiguity and vagueness. From the final chapter of volume ten, all I know is Hachiman does not want an No Longer Human end where he is Yozo, living in isolation and self-reflectivity.</br>  <br>If anything I'm biased against Iroha. She's not my favorite and I don't want her to win, but I can still recognize why she's a likable character and what her most prominent attributes are.<br>If I had to pick a word then  is right.<br>She's a sly girl.</br></br></br>  <br>So this is way they keep me around in school?</br>  <br>Maybe his butt hurts.</br>  <br> not genuine <br> not important <br> in love with Hayama </br></br></br>  <br>I'd take a Yozo over a Hachiman anytime.</br>  <br> Intel core i5 <br> 3.40Ghz <br> 32 Celsius <br>You're not going to overclock it?</br></br></br></br>  When is Commie going to release the subs for yesterday's episode? God damn they are taking so long.  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>It's at 4.3GHz.<br><br>You guys really need to stop having these threads so frequently.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm starting to think the slyness is all one big misunderstanding by 8man.</br>  What's so bad about this woman? Does she need to feel the touch of a man?  <br><br>She's got some major 5head and triangle face going on in that scene, for starters.</br></br>  <br>her chin is too pointy and looks like an ayylium</br>  <br>K-drama antagonistic mother syndrome.</br>  <br>genuine girl</br>  <br>8man sucks at reading people beyond the most shallow masks.</br>  <br><br>How dare you, she is a Japanese beauty.</br></br>  <br>Her partner doesn't give her enough dickings.</br>  <br>So you're saying he's wrong about her being genuine, eh?</br>  <br><br>All we know is that Yukino really doesn't like her and Haruno said she's very strong-willed.<br><br>  Rumi smiled weakly in return as she gripped her digital camera. “Yeah… but my mum doesn’t get it. She’s always asking me how I’m getting along with my friends. She said, ‘Take lots of photos at the outdoor ed camp!’ and so this camera…” <br>  That was why she bought the camera, huh. Well, it made sense to create memories to last a lifetime out of a school trip or some event like that. It wasn’t so strange to get fired up and be on the lookout for opportunities. <br>  “I see… she’s a nice mum. She worries about you, Rumi-chan,” Yuigahama said with relief. <br>  But Yukinoshita’s unpleasantly cold voice immediately followed. “I wonder about that… is that not a sign she wants to manipulate you, put you under her control and own you?” Her words stirred up uneasiness, the sort of feeling you’d get from treading on thin ice. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She did nothing wrong.</br>  <br> tfw 90% don't get the referrence <br>My take is<br> Iroha is after Hayama </br></br></br>  Irohasu~  <br>Wasn't paying attention to what the lines were referring to.<br>My bad.</br></br>  <br>Can't wait for it to be revealed that Mr. Yukinoshita is/was just like Hachiman and all of the women of the household are attracted to him for that reason.</br>  <br> roughly 17 tb <br>Why do you need so much money, and how much fucking backlog worth of anime do you have?<br>Holy shit.<br><br>And i was sitting here thinking that my 2 tb was impressive.</br></br></br></br></br>  Best family.  <br> yfw that isn't the most impressive right here ITT </br>  <br>*Why do you need so much memory.</br>  <br>i want this</br>  <br><br>Hachiman as future politician you say?<br><br>How could you be a genuine politician?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cliched as fuck.</br>  <br>There's no such thing such as too much memory<br>Although you have a point, a decade from now 10TB will be a household item</br></br>  <br>Why did they kidnpap Rumi?</br>  <br>So he married Rumi and adopted Yukino, right?</br>  So that was it? Seriously? No S3 or OVA's? Are we really going to have to read the fucking LN if we want some closure?  <br>I take it you don't watch Haganai</br>  <br><br>Welcome to the world of LN anime adaptations.</br></br>  <br>Some things become cliche because they're the most genuine.</br>  <br>Why is uncle 8man playing with Hayama's daughter here?</br>  Yui is love<br>Yui is life<br><br>She is the only heroine that loves Hikki.</br></br></br>  <br>Sweet reverse NTR baby</br>  Yuifags are in for a rude awakening.  <br>So Rumi is now Hayama and Haruno's daughter?<br>I thought Rumi was basically mini 8man</br></br>  <br> Vol 10 is suppose to have subtle hints to the ending <br>man how dumb are you???<br>that is just fucking stupid...</br></br></br>  <br>He is into younger girls<br>If he doesn't get together with anyone he is gonna fuck their daughters in the future.</br></br>  <br>WW said it himself, although I agree that anon is fucking stupid</br>  I just want Yukino to be happy. Are the happiest times she has had in the series the moments she spends with Hachiman (we dont get to see YuixYukino doing things without 8man)<br><br> 8man Winning her Pan-San Plush in Vol 3 <br> Roller Coaster ride <br> Wanting to make chocolates for someone she cares about </br></br></br></br>  <br>When is Hikigaya's mother going to appear to complete this circle of milfs? I want them all to spend time together and chat about their children.</br>  <br>It's common knowledge at this point, WW said the ending is foreshadowed in vol10.</br>  <br><br>We've seen her in the manga.</br></br>  <br>People are slow as fuck if they couldn't see this but Yukino's case is kind of extreme.</br>  So we getting a s3 or nah ? I just started zoku<br><br> Also why Saki is so cute? </br></br>  <br>Try volume 6.5</br>  <br>Yahallo to that,<br>my brother.</br></br>  <br>Cute. She's the reason they wear track suits?</br>  Why was season 2 so boring and melodramatic? Even the new designs have no charm, they added a bunch of post effects too everything looks so washed out, and it's not like the animation got any better either. I am honestly disappointed.  <br>The Hikigaya trait<br>they all wear tracksuits for some unknown reason</br></br>  <br>She reminds me of someone</br>  <br>Oh my achy breaky heart</br>  <br>Same</br>  If Yukino wins we riot.  8man should just give in to his siscon fantasies and have his way with Iroha.  It would be very harsh if the author went for a Yukino end. Her family is shit. <br><br>Yui is a nice girl with a nice family and little drama.</br></br>  <br>They're probably half slav.</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br><br>Hayama knew. Even Ebina ask him stop Tobe.</br></br>  <br>Is it time to Yuipost? <br><br>When she called that fish disgusting that was the best line of the episode.</br></br></br>  <br><br>8man hates fake girls, and that's what Iroha is. Completely fake and fabricated.</br></br>  <br>Would he take responsibility?</br>  <br> maymay bait of burgerland </br>  <br>How would having a family that treats her like nothing be a harsh end if he chooses her?<br>That would mean he genuinely likes her despite every flaw she has.</br></br>  <br>Fake? Yes<br>Completely? No</br></br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br>8man isn't into special needs girls.</br>  Apparently they skipped out most of vol10 in the anime, is everyone referring to the charm switching as the hints to the end or are there more?  <br>Are you sure about that?</br>  <br>The whole volume is a foreboding to the ending</br>  <br>Oh yes indeed.</br>  <br>I've never seen 8man squatting so I'm not so sure about that</br>  Who is this strong, kind girl who has entered the lives of these two disgruntled youth?  If it causes Yui/Yukino pain to be in love with 8man why don't they stop being in love?  <br>He stands and walks the way he does because of conflicting genes.</br>  <br>Stop treating love like something rational. It makes no sense, follows no rules, and is different for every person.<br><br>Basically it's completely and utterly irrational.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuigahama "Not a nice girl" Yui</br>  <br>Those mental gymnastics are impressive.</br>  <br>Hormones.</br>  <br>Can be overcome by will.<br><br><br>I am sure if they stopped thinking about him and starting focusing on other things they would fall out of love. It shouldn't be hard.<br><br>They could of picked a different person to be in love with.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino doesn't love Hachiman though.</br>  <br>Is 8man a nice guy?</br>  <br>Her platonic feelings of friendship for him make me feel all warm inside.</br>  <br>8man needs more Iroha in his life, not more drama.</br>  <br>I bet she wants to rape him in a platonic way<br>She has sure deep platonic feelings for him</br></br>    <br>I'd rather it reveal that Komachi/Iroha acts just like his mother and 8man actually has an oedipus complex rather than a sister complex.<br><br>It would explain why he seemingly both has an imouto complex and a big-breasted onee-san complex.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, he helps people for free</br>  <br>So does the janitor and no one thinks he is a nice guy.</br>  <br>And yet he chooses a more difficult path for reasons unknown.<br><br>Free will is a funny thing, isn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>She's infatuated with him just as she was with Haruna. She's just a clingy copycat.</br>  <br>My brother from another mother.</br>  <br>She clings to him platonically<br>She just intends to be really really good platonic friends with him</br></br>  <br> janitors <br> helping people <br>Good one m8.</br></br></br>  <br>He's not exactly choosing, it's being forced upon him by two certain girls that can't get their shit straight.</br>  <br>Weird, I do really have a half brother I have never meet</br>  <br> forced upon him <br> They begin to choose the easy way out <br> He says fuck that shit <br>It's his own choice, he chooses to suffer for them, no one is forcing him to do anything.</br></br></br></br>  Yukino's going to win. Gotta rip that bandage off now, it'll hurt less.  <br>Please explain to me again why having two top tier beautiful girls, who happen to be friends, being in love with you is somehow suffering.</br>  <br>It's his own decision, anon. He could leave them both behind and never talk to them. He doesn't. He chooses to stick by their side.</br>  <br>Exactly, he was forced to act to avoid bullshit.</br>  <br>Those bitches could have easily chosen the genuine path by themselves.</br>  <br>Nobody is forcing him to do anything. Why can't you see that every single action he has taken in the entire series has been his own choice.</br>  <br>He doesn't want to hurt either of them but he knows he will, he also knows he's going to get hurt.<br><br>What he's looking for is something deeper than friendship, companionship, or even love.</br></br></br>  <br>Would you have him accept what Yui proposed then? We all know he'd never allow it, and Yui knew it too.<br>No wonder she did what she did.</br></br>  So when did Yukino start wanting the 8man?<br>Do LNs explain where it starts better?<br>Because the end of s1 was more that they were m8s, then s2 just drops the romance tones immediately.<br>I mean it was clear as day that she would eventually, I just don't remember where.</br></br></br>  <br>8man only ever does what he wants to do. He values his relationship with Yui and Yukino. If he didn't then he wouldn't bother with either of them.</br>  <br> He doesn't want to hurt either <br>He won't hurt them, thanks to vol 11 neither of them will be hurt if he chooses one of them over the other.</br></br>  Guys I'm going to miss watching Yahari every week with /a/. Season 3 is also unlikely.   IT HURTS    <br>Volume 3, seeing through Haruno's façade<br>Or volume 4, first time he openly did a 8man</br></br>  <br>End of volume 6 (which is where the s1 ended). She started to have some "feelings" for him but she was unconscious of them hence her line of "I don't know why your social suicide bothers me so much" in ep. 2.<br>She fell for him hard after genuine speech.</br></br>  <br>He cares about them, it can't be helped.<br>He doesn't want fake shit, also can't be helped.<br>Yui forces fake shit, he is cornered. What do you think this is? Did he ask for that to happen just so he could refuse it?<br>Seriously, it's not that hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You've got to be kidding if you don't think that 8man choosing one of them won't hurt the other at all.</br>  <br>She grew interested in him after the mall date.<br>Became conscious of him during the school festival.<br>Some feelings for him during the trip to Kyoto.<br>Tried to break away from hose feelings after being disappointed in him after the Ebina confession and the StuCo arc.<br>Then finally completely falls for him after "genuine".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd take responsibility any day.</br>  <br>An ideal sillier than Shirou's.</br>  <br>By that logic he has no free will at all and every action he has ever taken as predetermined the moment he was born.<br><br>The reality of the situation is that he could at any time choose to sever a bond, ignore someone's request, or simply stonewall a person entirely.<br><br>He chooses not to. Nobody is mind controlling him, nobody is chaining him up and dragging him places, everything he does is his own action.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, let's throw the entire story progression by having him say fuck it to his friends all of the sudden just because.<br> neutronstar.jpg <br>I'm done.</br></br></br>  <br>Yui is prepared for it so it won't hurt her to see him with Yukino.<br><br>Yukino doesn't know she loves him so it wouldn't hurt her to see him with Yui.<br><br>Neither will be hurt by it much.

They are friends so it will be easier to deal with. <br>Just cause they are friends doesn't mean they won't be hurt by it much.

Arcueid and Ciel appear in their full roles, meaning it can't be an early Near Side route. Akiha's power is well known as well as Kohaku's unhinged mind. That implies the full knowledge of the Far Side routes is revealed. Nero Chaos is dead, Roa is dead, Satsuki is alive as the tenth Dead Apostle Ancestor if they want her to be. Arcueid and Ciel are both still hanging around, but Shiki hasn't chosen either one.

Nothing.</br>  I still don't understand why Jotaro could fly. Was it another facet of the Stand?  <br>Not him, but seeing that box, and seeing my anime DVDs, they all say "English and Japanese" audio somewhere on the back. As that doesn't, that might be a reason to be concerned. And, this isn't Funimation, this is Warner Bros. When was the last time they did an anime DVD release?<br><br>Please prove me wrong, show me the last WB anime release and see if it has the original audio.</br></br></br>  <br>i assume so</br>  <br>Araki thought it looked cool so it happened</br>  <br>Yeah but he never flies again, when it could be insanely useful in every part, especially part 6</br>  <br>Yeah I was just thinking that. It still obviously has to be a stand power though. So maybe the flying power was attainable when Jotaro was at the peak of power of his stand (He hadn't time stopped in 10 years as stated in part 4, so maybe without practice his stands true powers weaken.) I still agree with you though, it was definitely some Araki make-the-fight-look-cool bullshit.</br>  <br>The Cell Saga was big at the time.</br>  <br>That OP is a faggot.</br>  <br>Esta mi, Dio!</br>  <br>Bought a DIO and The World SAS.</br>  <br>Picture?</br>  <br>Fui yo, Dio!<br><br>learn spanish (actually don't, it's a shitty language)</br></br></br>  <br> Please prove me wrong, show me the last WB anime release and see if it has the original audio. <br>http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/A<wbr>SIN/B004VLLWA6/<br> Dubbed: Japanese <br> Studio: Warner Home Video <br><br>http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/A<wbr>SIN/B002WCLG3Y/<br> Dubbed: Japanese, Spanish <br> Studio: Warner Home Video </br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Did some google-searching.

One I see that matches the Jojo box without saying it, is Bakugan, and that doesn't have the Japanese dub. But then again, that was a Cartoon Network show.<br><br>So I don't even know myself. Should we panic?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, that first one does say English and Japanese audio on the box.<br><br>But bear in mind, the Jojo box is a mockup, it probably doesn't have all the info on it.

Elena?</br>  <br>Tecnically recap is going to be 14.5</br>  <br>It'll be. Did you miss the stream? Only the CR version has the preview for episode 16.</br>  <br>Were these shown in the episode or on the official page?</br>  <br> not watching FURA FURA every week. <br><br>You are living your life wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop skipping the ED.</br>    <br> I want to FUCKING MURDER HER <br> with my dick </br></br>  <br>yep</br>  <br> exposing yourself as a faggoty ED-skipper </br>  <br>meat is supposed to be  BEATS IN BEATS IN BEATS<br>BEATS IN BEATS IN BEATS</br> <br> BEATS IN YO HEAAAD </br></br>  So I'm an anime-only fag and I have a serious question here...<br><br>Do the students of Totsuki ever actually LEARN anything? So far it seems like it's just one test after another to whittle down their numbers.</br></br>  <br>Erina was made to GUNUNU</br>  <br> its universally accepted that no one liked the karaage arc <br>The karaage arc was my favorite arc before the Stagaire arc happened<br><br><br>It really is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BEST GRILLL HAS ARRIVED</br>  <br> Skipping the Karage arc what the fuck? <br>They tweeted a while back for an event where they had the karaage roll, and they mentioned that it would be appearing in the anime.<br><br>You should assume that they are changing the order of events. Of course this means they probably have to cut out mentions of Eizan until then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but most of their "basic" (read: incredibly advanced and arduously difficult) education was taken care of in the Middle School division of the academy. In the High School division of Tootsuki they still have lectures, but it is also where their practical skills are developed through rigorous and highly selective cooking classes and events. <br><br>You see Souma and Erina attending a lecture or two in the manga, but the most important part of their High School education is the practicum, the actual cooking they are made to do. It's also why the High School division is encouraged to make Shokugeki challenges, because it only hones their skills further.</br></br></br>  <br> 666 <br>Erina confirmed for Satan.</br></br>  <br>Alice really looks pale next to Aldinis, I like it. You can't really see her supposed paleness in manga.</br>  <br>Yes, they learn almost everything in middle school. But they have classes in high school too.</br>  <br>yeah, they have cooking classes. the have regular subject classes (we see Souma walking out of English class at one point) and they have PE. Picture related.</br>  <br> be an amazing chef <br> fail school because suck at PE <br>I hope Aldini's bro will be OK.</br></br></br>  <br>inb4 Shokugeki no Souma is a cooking manga</br>  <br>Tootsuki academy has a middle school and a high school. Babby classes where you learn in a classroom are done in middle school, they don't actually start cooking regularly til High School, when their teachers decide they are fit to be allowed in a kitchen. Souma is irregular because he transferred in at the high school level, without ever having to go through the middle school curriculum. Somebody who manages to do that would have to satisfy the teachers despite never having received their instruction. That, combined with the fact that his tester was Nakiri Erina, and also his ballsy speech, is why everybody wants a piece of him.</br>  <br>does Erina have good ball control?</br>  <br>Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga.</br>  <br>It's a cooking manga and THAT'S the best sexual pun you can come up with?</br>  <br>Yes, a cooking manga.</br>  <br>look at all of this cooking</br>  <br>in regards to the related image, it's the first thing that came to mind. I'm sorry. I'll sodoku.</br>  <br>Yes, Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga.</br>  <br> Actually skipping the ED <br><br>I'm really surprised</br></br></br>  <br> katana <br> No wonder why Soma lost the tournament </br></br>  <br>you would fuck satan would you?</br>  <br>yes, being a master chef means amazing timing taste and hand eye coordination</br>  <br>They have normal classes about cooking but the question is if a reader would want to read all that theory and there's no way a normal writer could know all that unless he himself studied it at some time in his life.</br>  <br> a reader would want to read all that theory <br>I would.</br></br>  <br>Plus scenes like that are ultimately just filler considering the content that people want out of this series, especially at this point. <br><br>It's enough that he implies there are lectures and that Souma et.al. attend them using a couple panels now and then.</br></br></br>   200 plates <br> make them eat ALL the eggs </br>  <br>Nice meme bro!</br>  In the name of fuck why the hell the loli didnt splushed or went naked like the rest of the females. <br>one job<br>ONE JOB</br></br>  <br>Then go to cooking school. Pu would need to know a temperature in a magzine for food. <br><br>Exactly</br></br></br>   buffet style challenge <br> choose a shit meal that deflates after 10 minutes <br>He seriously didn't think of this beforehand?</br></br>  <br>he didn't have any experience<br><br>the problem I see with that for Souma in the long run, is the lack of ability to think things through by placing himself in a situation. he's GREAT at thinking on his toes once he's in a dilemma... just not so great at planning in advance. it's happened several times already</br></br></br>  <br> not watching fura fura <br><br>Dude I skip all endings but this one grew on me so much that even the dumb animations of the character grew on me.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she's a loli and Shokugeki no Soma is a WSJ manga. All of them don't have foodgasms.</br>  <br>Alice &gt; Turtle killer &gt; Shinomiya &gt; Hinako &gt; the rest</br>  <br>same, the song is just awesome. Last ending I always watched was the one from tamako market, really relaxing, they give me a warm feeling</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> she still gives a hidden blowjob <br>sounds like they could at least given us SOMETHING for the loli</br></br>  I just wanted to say fuck you guys, I've been reading "Hishoko" so much I've started to call her that mentally.   Erina eating pleb food will never get animated. <br><br> The other two will never get translated </br></br>  <br>From what series is that loli from?</br>  <br>That's okay though, most people in-universe call her that too now.<br><br>Hell, there's hardly anyone that calls meat "ikumi" anymore except in official context</br></br></br>  <br>World Trigger.</br>  <br>world trigger</br>  I miss Nene already.<br>Where are you Nene?<br>Daisuki, Nene-chan.</br></br>  <br>Souma is the red man</br>  <br>busy planning on how to prevent isshiki from usurping her head start to the #1 seat next year</br>  Hey guys what was the name of Sword-kun again? I forgot it already.  <br>My eyes.</br>  <br>Why can't you just call him Sword-kun like everyone else?</br>  <br>Saitou Soumei.</br>  <br>wait really? wouldn't that make him related to one of the buttbros then?</br>  <br>No, that's Sato.</br>  <br>No.<br>Buttbro is 佐藤 昭二 (Satou Shouji)<br>Sword-kun is 斎藤 綜明 (Saitou Soumei)</br></br></br>  <br>Doujima's foodgasms scares me...</br>  <br>He has Chrollo earrings. Are these a thing irl?</br>  <br>Sword-kun and Fililpinbro keep just overlapping in my head.</br>  <br> maybe they are the previous generation's buttbros </br>  <br> learned about honey alternative to pineapple tenderizing <br> learned about vinegar to whiten califlower <br> learned about onion/tenderized budget steak </br></br></br>  How did Souma make that omelette look like a hot cake?  What's that red shit he put on the eggs?  <br>Tomato sauce.</br>  <br>Whipping the egg whites.</br>  So I'm guessing not every meal will be grounded in reality? This seems impossible to make.  <br>it's possible<br><br>seems really tricky though</br></br></br>  <br>i don`t know we are scary good at making shit with molecular gastronomy</br>  <br>It's possible, it's molecular gastronomy after all. The tankobon has the recipe for the milkshake.</br>  <br>You can do it, you need to be a professional with specific equipment but you can do it<br><br>Also the fish egg thing wont look like the anime version all that much</br></br></br>  <br>It's just a bunch of food shaped to look like other food. The fish eggs are the only annoying part since the others are literally a drink inside an eggshell and two pastes stuck together.</br>  <br>In the first season of Mind of a Chef Wylie Dufrene makes a dish really similar to this</br>  <br> Satou Shouji <br>He has same name of the mangaka who drew HOTD and Triage X as well many doujins. Dunno if that character was tribute to him.</br></br>  Whats the name of that guy that always hangs around Alice? I can't remember  <br>Kurokiba Ryou.</br>  Post yfw this was the last episode with fura fura  <br>I think she didn't actually mind the fact it was takoyaki, either, it was just the ingredients that were too pleb.</br>  <br>It just struck me. Rindou should be voiced by  Shizuka Itou .</br>  that fluffy omelet seems nice and cheap to try making<br>the manga isn't very specific and i'm a complete amateur, also i think i'll fuck up trying to flip them<br><br>is there any recipe like  for it? <br><br>i have everything but the cream</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, there is. But it isn't translated.</br>  <br>You basically just make a savory souffle, probably beating the whites a bit less so they don't get overly fluffy and pour into the pans easily.</br>  <br>You need cream to make the eggs fluffy</br>  Who doesn't want to fuck Soma at the end of episode 14?<br> cousins crave his meat <br> rival craves his meat <br> every friend of his craves his meat </br></br></br>  why are there so many upskirt shots of megumi in the manga  Fighting game when  <br>yeah, it's pretty lucky that his long term plan basically being "I'll wing it the whole way" was actually a way to deal with Mimasaka.</br>    <br> Fililpinbro <br><br>Peruvian.</br></br></br>  <br> why are there so many upskirt shots of megumi in the manga <br>Megumi does provide the most panty shots, yes.</br></br>  <br><br> Fililpinbro <br><br>explain yourself</br></br></br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDER ERINA!  <br>I want to take Erina to Subway</br>  OST when? Souma's theme is godly.  <br>Alice doesn't want Soma's D.<br>This isn't some shitty harem where every girl loves him. The only possible contenders are childhood friend, meat, Megumi and Erina</br></br>  <br>July 28th.</br>  <br>What is this supposed to be?<br><br>Street Fighter?</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the info anon.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br><br> 4 girls <br><br>sounds like a harem to me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>out of that group, only one actually has shown feelings for him.</br>  <br>Two anon. Both Meat and Kurase. Megumi and Erina are inevitable, but you are correct that they have not.<br><br>And yes, thankfully Tsukuda doesn't want to make every girl fall for Souma.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Wait a second.<br><br>Then who is Meat supposed to be?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah yeah, I forgot about Kurase. My mistake<br><br>But she's pretty much a non-character at this point</br></br></br>  <br>i want erina to berate my poorly prepared cum</br>  <br>They gotta work with a set number of episodes, and S2 is not guaranteed. Can't risk getting people bored.</br>  <br>enjoy your shitty harem</br>  <br>Elena</br>  <br><br><br>I thought Megumi had a little talk at one point with Nikumi where she hinted at her also having feelings for Souma. Maybe not strong ones, but something was there.</br></br></br>  <br> romance <br> shoujoshit <br><br>Really? I agree with all the other ones, but this feels weird</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is in the thin line between admiration and love.</br>  <br><br>lets all laugh at the dumb fuck nigger in denial that souma has a harem</br></br>  Why? Why do people always delude themselves that there's no harem? Do they enjoy the feeling of being wrong again and again?  <br>Better idea. Lets all tell the shitposting secondary to fuck off</br>  They better keep the foodgasms with the new ED I will straight cut a bitch if there isn't an Asura foodgasm.  <br>To be fair to that anon, right now there isn't. Unless you want to be funny and count Takumi. Of course, there will be one as soon as Megumi really falls for him. She obviously will before Erina, so she's the one who'll push it to 3 girls, making it a harem.</br>  <br> 628 Students passed <br> 200 Plates each  <br><br>628 x 200 = 125.600 plates of Egg,<br><br>how many fucking guest did they had for that test?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Molecular gastronomy can make this, I'm sure they can make jelly that looks like raw egg.</br>    <br>Purest girl gets the pantyshots</br>  <br>What about  Shinomiya? </br>  <br>its possible<br>and for molecular gastronomy this is insertion lvl.<br><br>hell asparagus mouse is just egg, heavy cream and asparagus, then blend em.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are those whole fish, or is it a dish cleverly designed to look like it contains whole fish?</br>    <br>This 'egg' is made out of coconut jelly and mango.</br>  This show is actually so fucking good. I hope it makes it to the point where Erina and Souma fuck regularly.  <br>Souma would be part of his harem, not the other way around.</br>  <br>See for yourself<br>http://www.ohiseered.com/2013/04/go<wbr>ldfish-in-my-consomme.html</wbr></br></br>  <br>for the soma plate the white is sea weed jelly and the yolk is salmon egg and coloring</br>  <br>Looks good</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centu<wbr>ry_egg<br><br>I have no idea what they taste like, but they look pretty.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Totsuki's a fucking empire, they've got a lot of employees</br>  <br>Goddammit China. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgi<wbr>n_boy_egg</wbr></br>  <br>Aldini's bro is fucking bearfat.
