Someone post the spoiler pics I'm to lazy to do it myself  I want the one we have not seen  <br>EMAA is best love square</br>  <br>elaborate please</br>  So what I learned from this chapter is that Ymir a shit and EH is canon. Oh and that young Carla is a qt.  <br>Nice shitposting</br>  <br>What I learned is that everyone is a cuck</br>  Repostan.  <br>I wonder if Grisha ever touched Eren inappropriately since he looked a lot like his mother when she was young.</br>  <br>New version of everyone's a Titan?</br>  <br>There is fanart of it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723446 <br>Holy shit you're right</br>  <br>Already?

They have mutual repect for one another.</br>  <br>And young Frieda looks like crossdressing Eren.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723546 <br>EH isn't BTFO yet if anything it was confirmed last chapter. I wish Isayama would stop with these retarded love triangles though he is clearly holding a grudge about something.</br>      <br>Isayama a shit. EA a best.</br>    <br>He was chased because he could cure the plague and which goes against MT plans to destroy humanity. There could be this indication: during Utgard he transformed the Ragako village into titan. It’s the opposite of what he did with Sannes “illness”, which I presume it was a titan outbreak he cured.</br>  <br>what if he was lying</br>  <br>Nah, at least SnK hasn't had Idolm@ster induced hiatuses. Yet.</br>    <br>Splatoon hiatus soon.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723625 <br>When was Grisha revealed as a Reiss? If anything that just makes EH distant cousins. Also the movie isn't canon and that's not even Historia in it.</br>    <br>Isayama was in a love triangle when he was younger and lost now he expresses it through drawing</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723625 <br> The AoT movie also says Eren and Historia are sisters. <br><br> sisters <br><br>I knew YHfags were retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  That's it for now  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723625 <br>Grisha wasn't revaled a Reiss, this was just fujos expeculation, there's nothing about this in the chapter, now calm your titties.</br>  <br>You are not any better by replying to bait.</br>  <br>They're also retarded because Historia isn't in the movie.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723625 <br> Historia and eren are sisters <br>Since when was eren a girl</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723694 <br>He asked when in this chapter, anon.</br>  <br>Where does he say that? Because he writes A-&gt;E into all of his side stories</br>  <br><br> Maybe this.</br></br>  <br>Mutual respect is a good foundation to build a relationship on. Certainly better than a lot of the other ships.</br>  <br>This.

It's even worse now.</br>  I don't know why you guys need to bring up EH/YH when the chapter hasn't mentioned them at all so far.  <br> Why are you guys so obsessed with cucking? <br>Welcome to 4chan.</br></br>  <br>bcause Keith is a bro who wont betray Grisha</br>  <br>Why is Isayama so obsessed with it?</br>  <br>It's underage beta faggots who want to self insert.</br>  <br>Because Bimbongfags.</br>  <br>Because Isayama comes on 4chan to participate in cucking threads then steal our ideas</br>  http://mangakansou.com/%E3%80%90%E3<wbr>%83%8D%E3%82%BF%E3%83%90%E3%83%AC%E<wbr>3%80%91%E9%80%B2%E6%92%83%E3%81%AE%<wbr>E5%B7%A8%E4%BA%BA%E3%80%8071%E3%80%<wbr>80%E6%84%9F%E6%83%B3%E3%80%90%E6%B3<wbr>%A8%E6%84%8F%E3%80%91/<br><br>FUCKING SOMEONE TRANSLATE THIS ALREADY</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723936 <br> The spoilers don't mention anything about Keith and Carla having a thing. It's one-sided by Keith. <br>But it does have Grisha telling Keith that Eren is not his son.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723936 <br>Betaville population: Keith and Jean</br>  Is Grisha from BRA village? That'd make some interesting conflicts with Eren since he wants to kill them so bad.  <br>Were is translator kun</br>  <br>It would explain why he's an MT like shifter, now that we know that MT is from the warrior village.</br>  <br>Because Isayama is unoriginal and a bad writer. Expect more kidnapping this arc.</br>  <br>You forgot Bort, Reiner and Mikucksa.</br>  <br>You forgot Nigmir</br>  <br>Alphaville population: Grisha and MT.</br>  <br>No. Grisha was the one saying "He's my son, not yours".</br>   ITT: People misusing the word cuck   <br>It's just you guys assuming any character interacting with another character means romance is happening so you see it everywhere.</br>  <br>Tha't's what I just said</br>  <br>Grisha cuck Keith</br>  <br>Hello newfag.</br>  <br>I think he is and ran away from MT, since he shared technology and information favoring the humans and the cure to counter the titan serum.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724108 <br>Jean is a beta cuck and will die along with Sasha and Connie.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724108 <br>Jean is one of the biggest beta in snk and also the first cuck.</br>  <br>Ymir's not beta</br>  Cuckold commanded titans to kill Carla, because he was forever mad at her.  <br>Sure, that's why this is playing out exactly like it's a stupid romance drama. I'm sure Keith just really missed his bestest buddy Carla when she got married.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724146 <br>Reiner pls. Don't you have to pleasure some monkey genitals somewhere?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724146 <br>MT is going the cuck historia by killing Ymir in front of her</br>  <br>Your formulation<br>  Grisha telling Keith that Eren is not his son. <br>was ambiguous</br></br></br>  Grisha is best boy  Another month of waiting for nothing. Thanks Isayama, Shingeki no Cuck is awesome.  <br> wants to kill them so bad <br> what is reading comprehension </br></br>  <br>Grisha kills children and drugs his own son.</br>  <br>Look how sad historia is when she realise that Eren is going to kill everyone in her harem</br>  <br> he's an MT like shifter <br><br>Mt is hairy, is way way bigger and has monkey arms.<br>how is him anything like MT?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same shit.</br>  Why is Keith even telling him this stuff? This information doesn't appear to have relevance to what Eren is looking for  <br>Rick and Shane reference?</br>  <br> Mikucksa <br> Cuckeith <br> Cuckyrmin <br> Cuckannie <br> Cuckenny <br><br>I think Isayama might be a /tv/ poster</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm wondering the same. What's the point of this?</br>  <br>More content --&gt; more money for Isayama --&gt; more instant ramen for his tummy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724392 <br>Fine he can have Mikasa</br>  <br>Isayama likes to stall. And Keith probably doesn't know much about the topic in the first place.<br><br>Also, I think Grisha being from outside of the wall is pretty damn relevant.</br></br></br>  <br>Eren asked him to tell him everything he knows after Keith told him that he looked like his mother but had his father's eyes.</br>  Grisha's saying that Eren is different from Keith because he is Grisha's son, therefore Eren is special.  <br>We Harry Potter now? It mentions a chosen one in the spoilers.</br>  <br>Does Levi kill Dumbledore?</br>  <br>Eren is the son of a shifter or whatever Grisha is, of course he's going to be different.</br>  <br>Sure, Grisha being from the outside makes sense, but that could have been inferred from everything we knows so far, so no need to spend this much panel time on Shadis/Carla/Grisha stuff for one measly piece of info we already strongly suspected.</br>  <br>I think it's more likely that Grisha was some sort of leader and Eren is his only heir.</br>   Inb4 Grisha is royalty from outside the Walls.   <br>Stalling. Remember when we all thought Historia would give answers about the wall titans and all we got was a sad backstory.</br>  <br>Wall Titans seem to be forgotten in general.</br>  This chapter looks well drawed for once.  <br>True, the way Nick worded stuff, it sounded like Historia actually knew shit but I guess not. (Maybe that was a retcon to drag out the series.)</br>  <br>We did get some sort of answers on them though.</br>  <br>Is that Carla sitting next to Grisha? Did they just get married?</br>  <br>Grisha is a faggot with his special snowflake son.</br>  <br> This information doesn't appear to have relevance to what Eren is looking for <br>Eren told Grisha and Keith that Carla has been eaten. After exchanging a few words with Grisha, sad Keith leaves the scene. Then he heard the titan transformation (but doesn't know what it was). He comes back and find Eren, and takes him back to a shelter.</br></br>  <br>But I mean no one seems to be concerned of them currently. And now are they going to learn more about them now? Or was that little moment all Isayama is going to say until they wake up?</br>  <br>Seems like it. Probably a typical wedding for middle class peopl who live within the walls.</br>  <br>I'm just so fucking glad they're back.</br>  あだなは「ベルトル」<br>by諫山先生<br><br>ワロタ<br><br>Apparently Isayama gave Bert a nickname. I think it was for the Giants game, but it could be for the Bessatsu. There's a special feature in it this time where fans were able to submit nicknames for everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically Isayama wasted a chapter on a irrelevant flashback <br>Why am I not surprised</br></br>  <br> well-drawn </br>  <br>What's everyone else's nickname?</br>  <br>He's trying to drag out the story.</br>  <br> we could have had the start of the next expedition in this chapter <br><br>Feels bad, man.</br></br></br>    <br>Why can't isayama draw babies? He just looks like a fat manlet.</br>  So this could have been a chapter where we could potentially have gotten answers, but instead Isayama just drags the story out with a retarded Keith-Grisha-Carla love triangle and no answers.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127724207 <br>Kek alpha beta shit doesn't apply to women, neckbeard.<br>It's just men that misbehave like dogs.</br></br>  <br>Pointy ears, buff build, beard, badass overall look, even the human forms look similar.</br>  <br>Heh.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723694 <br> &gt;When was Grisha revealed as a Reiss? <br> THIS chapter <br><br>No.<br><br><br>Ymir-sama</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  To be fair this is not the whole chapter is it? Where is the rest. Has anyone read it so far?  <br>Unless they can read moon, probably not.</br>  <br>They only wanted to know the wall secrets so they can seal it the hole for now. They'll probably wake up later.</br>  <br>Flashback is around 20 pages.</br>  <br>And the rest is?</br>  <br>I hope it's not. I still need to see MEN</br>  <br>Talking between HLEMSAJK</br>  Center Field - Eren<br>Shortstop - Connie<br>Third Base - Reiner<br>Designated Hitter - Levi<br>Right Field - Jean<br>First Base - Bertholt<br>Catcher - Ymir<br>Second Base - Sasha<br>Left Field - Annie<br>Pitcher - Mikasa<br><br> Designated Hitter <br> Hitler </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's most of it. There's a little HEL but that's it.</br>  <br>Wasn't this old news? Bertl has been around for a while.<br><br><br>He's done it before.</br></br></br></br>  So could next chapter be about Erwin plan for the next expedition and then chapter 73 will be about everyone interacting with each before they leave.<br>Then chapter 74 the expedition starts</br>  <br>I think Isayama just brought up the nickname Bertl again. Bert's full first name is ベルトルト. There's not any mention of anyone else.</br>  <br>interview where he said they were friends.</br>  <br> Marlo? </br>  <br> Ymir is Grisha's illegitimate child  <br> Ymir is Eren's sister </br></br>  <br>H=Hanji<br>L=Levi<br>E=Erwin<br>M=Mikasa<br>S=Sasha<br>A=Armin<br>J=Jean(?)<br>K=Keith</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but since this isn't a romance manga, and ANnie has been stuck in a rock since 33, it more likely that the relationship will never develop.</br>  <br>Dude, isn't Ymir like way too old to be Grisha's child</br>  <br>That's optimistic. They probably won't leave within this year</br>  <br>Isayama just brought it up again. It's the first time he's brought up himself.</br>  <br>It could be just more flashbacks and Eren getting kidnapped by angry wall people again.</br>  <br>Considering the pacing of this series I wouldn't be surprised.</br>  <br>E = Eren<br>J = Jean<br>Everything else is right.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck are translators? Are they sleeping or something?  I need to know whether cuckodry is real in this chapter.   <br>Nah</br>  <br>gtfo and see ya next month</br>  <br>On a related note, you can hear the seiyuus in character cheering up the players on a baseball game here:<br>https://twitter.com/afuafuafu/statu<wbr>s/618382711091138560</wbr></br></br>  Why do all the shingekis look like their moms?  <br>Would you rather that they look like their dads?</br>  <br>Only Erwin looks like his dad.</br>  <br>Why Eren's mother here looks like Historia?<br><br> Eren has mother complex. EH confirmed. </br></br></br>  <br>It's baseball season huh</br>  <br>Historia looks more like her dad</br>  <br>What are they talking about?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127725027 <br>It would be cool if some characters end up separated from the rest and we follow different groups. I assumed we will start with Levi squad 2 together since Levi picked them for the purpose of making Eren desperate.</br>   Are you going to commit yourself to that child? <br>Keith is MAD that Carla had a son with Grisha</br>  <br>Levi wanting to make Eren desperate never made sense to me. <br>Eren's shown to be a competent soldier who follows orders. Why would Levi want Eren to lose his shit and potentially fuck things up?</br></br>  <br>Maybe he also fears that Grisha will return to his true home beyond the walls one day.</br>  <br> GIANTS </br>  <br>There's no mention of them in the spoilers. I thought it was obvious by now that Mike wasn't Erwin and Nile's friend?</br>  <br>If Eren is Keith's son, Grisha's the cuck.</br>  <br>Because last time Eren saw someone he cared about die and then was in mortal danger with Mikasa, he awakened the coordinate power and even controlled it briefly.<br><br>Levi probably hopes that this will happen again if Eren sees one of his friends in danger.</br></br></br>  <br> Eren: Why were you in my father's flashback and memories? <br> Keith: It was over 20 years ago when I first saw your mother, Carla.... <br> Eren: I'm asking about my dad! <br> Keith: God, was I madly in love. <br><br>Is he senile?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that was a plot device Isayama ended up dropping. JSC mutiny bowl was enough.</br>  <br>Because it makes manlet look too bad?</br>   Still waiting for translation   <br>Don't blame Keith for Isayama's shit storytelling skills.</br>  <br>Is Keith the Snape of SnK?</br>  <br> mutinybowl <br>Good times.</br></br>  I like that we get more background on Grisha and Keith but it sucks that it's for a love triangle thing.  Did Keith know that Eren ate his father or not? He should have seen Grisha's corpse right?  <br>If you mean that little blip in his blog then all he said was that Eren didn't have romantic feelings. In the same way that Marlo cares about Hitch. Or Mikasa's relationship with Jean. Like pretty much all romances being one sided. So caring seriously about shipping is pointless in this series</br>  <br>Yeah, the triangle seems like unnecessary repetition. We get it, SL men are always cucks against non-SL men.</br>  WTF, where are the spoilers? Can anyone tell me?  <br>A lot of people died and the only thing left of Grisha were his lower half.</br>  Keith was actually mad for not getting Grisha.  <br>Annie is the best</br>  <br>Mangakansou. Also this thread.</br>  Keith messed with Eren';s belt to confirm that he was a special snowflake.  Keith looked really old in the flashback, and Carla looked really young. How old was he when he fucked her?  <br>Everywhere, just no translators around.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, I owe you one</br></br>  <br>He never did, he is beta as fuck</br>  <br>If he didn't dick her then Grisha wouldn't need to reiterate to him that he's his son, not Keith's.</br>  <br>Grisha was saying that Eren is special because he's his son.</br>  Why are the parents in SnK so shitty?  <br>Grisha probably knew Keith was in love with Carla and he didn't like him getting close to his family.</br>  <br>Because MUH DRAMA.</br>  in snk all characters look exactly like their mothers. except for Erwin  <br>they lived in a shitty world</br>  <br>They are the catalysts for everything that goes wrong it seems.</br>  <br>Kenny wasn't shitty at all but he wasn't really a parent, just a crazy uncle.</br>  <br>Neither do Historia and Jean.</br>  <br>Didn't look to me like Keith held any ill feelings towards Grisha despite getting cucked by him.</br>  <br>Or maybe Nick thought the whole royal family inherited the ancient knowledge genetically.</br>  <br>Erwin's dad was okay, and maybe Annie's.</br>  <br>Jean's mom probably spoils him rotten considering how Jean treats her like shit.</br>  <br>Or Isayama fucked up.</br>  <br>Mikasa's parents, Armin's parents, Connie's parents, Sasha's dad and Jean's mum were all fine though.</br>  <br>Given how things happened, I assume he meant she could make the decision to have the information about the titans be made public.</br>  Reiss and Jeager looks too much alike to be a coincidence.  <br>or he know that if historia ate the corridnate she would get all the information</br>  <br>Manlet's mom<br>Erwin's dad<br>Eren's mom</br></br></br>  <br>jean mom doesn't exist.</br>  <br>Or maybe this was before Isayama expanded the story.</br>  <br> Armin's parents <br>We never saw Armin's parents.</br></br>  <br>Anon mikasa parent were terrible <br>They made her live a life without mikasa realising the danger inside the wall.<br>And because of that Mikasa almost became a slave for those criminal</br></br></br>  <br>What's so bad about not telling a child that the world is actually a shitty place</br>  Chinkfag here, got the chapter, but my scanner is on fire, can you wait until next month?  <br>I just noticed Levi didn't eat anything.</br>  Scanner here, Chinkfag is on fire.  <br>ebin</br>  <br>first chapter in a new volume, start of a new arc, come one anon, it was bound to happen.</br>  <br>How? They are still waiting a month to get ready? unless you want another time skip. each arc is generally 16 chapter. 4 chapters to set up the basement make sense.</br>  <br>Mikasa is picky.</br>  <br>They become naive about the world they live in<br>Remember Mikasa's words<br> The world is a cruel place.but also beautiful  <br>When mikasa lived.with her parents they made her think the world.was a nice place</br></br></br></br>  Why do we hate her again?  I don't, she's a qt. <br><br>It's like /a/ always wants to hate someone.</br></br>  <br>Probably something about being a violent bitch and fucking with loli imouto, but I wasn't following the threads.</br>  <br>I also don't get the hate. Anons dislike her because no fun allowed.</br>  <br>Because she's a slut!<br><br>SLLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!</br></br></br>  <br>Because if I like her, she'll get KeyAIDS and die.</br>  <br>Because /a/ irrationally hates characters for stupid reasons.</br>  Probably because she's going to make the MC stop being an asshole and they probably enjoy MC as an asshole.  <br>The little sister was set up for getting the KeyAIDS though, I think others are fine as long as she's alive.</br>  Manipulative bitch   anime name is charlotte <br> none of the characters is named charlotte <br><br>ok</br></br></br>  Has she done something wrong?  <br> Implying Charlotte isn't the childhood friend that became bitter because NotLelouch forgot her </br>  <br>She's very pretty. I wonder if she'd like anal sex.</br>  <br>This is anime. The title relating to the content of the show in any way - or even making any kind of sense - is entirely optional.</br>  <br>A few things, yes. <br>But it was just now confirmed she's shit tier.</br></br>  <br>Ruined Kanye's entire life, although she'll probably blow him to make up for it.</br>  <br>Ruined our edgy MC dreams in less than 10 minutes then stole his imouto right in front of him</br>  <br>I love her voice.</br>  <br>Ghost blowjob?</br>  <br>She ruined the show. Nothing good if she around mc.</br>  BEcause she is a cunt bigger then the MC but she can get away with it because she has a vagina  <br>He ruined it by himself for cheating, or do you think he would have made the test?</br>  <br>I dont hate dead people.</br>  <br> because she has a vagina <br><br>This hasn't been confirmed. If the MC of Ranpo Kitan is a boy then I am not feeling safe until we see some full frontal nudity.</br></br></br>  So how long do you think before the whole government lab rats and the secret facility shows up in the plot?  <br>Edgy mc kinda rekt her when he said if she was going to play that she had to leave. The imouto is a qt3.14 and the white haired invisibility chick, forgot her name is still pretty good</br>  <br> interrupts the moeblob train <br> introduces characters with superpowers <br>This is OK. At least it feels like the KeyAIDS train has been delayed.</br></br></br>  <br> although she'll probably blow him to make up for it. <br>not until inevitable VN is released</br></br>  <br>So much this.</br>  <br>Her breasts.<br> inb4 pads <br>Also this isn't fujoshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she hasn't had any consequences for her actions yet while MC-kun has.<br><br>MC-kun has also not retaliated against her beatdown while earlier he was shown making trucks crash. Seemingly because she's a cute girl that should get away with everything.</br></br></br>  <br> watching fujoshit </br>  <br>Ranpo Kitan MC is canonically master of disguise and crossdressing as young woman. He`ll be able to disguise himself as woman even totally naked.</br>  <br>Or because it looks like a girl<br>Same thing</br></br>  <br>He didnt mention Gangsta, what are you on about?</br>  <br>I don't remember them being that big tbh<br><br><br>To be fair I went in knowing nothing except it was a mystery of some kind<br><br><br>I think we've all tried to master the "look like you have a vagina" technique</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She caused property and financial damage that created more cons in real life than outing MC's secret.<br><br>That flower shop, all those bicycle owners, etc got their property wrecked by that teleporting faggot tailing MC on bitch's orders.</br></br></br>  She's a goody goody, no fun allowed.<br>Basically the Azusa of the series.</br>  <br>And Kanye crashed a truck because he was horny, not because he was trying to capture someone with super powers.</br>  The long haired cunt is better  <br>Azusa was lovely.</br>   mc can't wreck invisibility moralfag <br>what a weak ass faggomaster</br>  She shot down Hachiman  <br> no fun allowed, unless I do it* </br>   female with dominant personality <br> messes with "muh based MC" <br>Do you really have to ask, OP?</br></br>  Because she ruined the chance that the show was just going to be about MC being a cool guy going about his day to day life as a badass  <br> Why is she so perfect? </br>  Because it showed how much of a pussy beta fag the MC really is.<br>He should refuse to go to that new school and posses that bitch girl and then kill her</br>  <br> take hold of Sonic <br> speed kick her into oblivion <br>is that easy</br></br></br>  <br>Could he even use another person's power? <br>Not just "Can he use it while he's in another person's body?", but also, "Would he even know how to activate their powers?"</br></br>  <br>She and Torpedoman destroyed the MC´s perfect school life.<br>Ok, he was a douche, but he was the viewer´s self-insert.</br></br>  But wouldnt it be easier to get a girl to like you to posses her and then have her hold your hand or something and then pretend it was her the one who did it?  <br>Do we?</br>  <br>It really bothers me that it seems as though you're not joking at all.</br>  <br>1. Take over her body<br>2. Strip yourself naked in 5 seconds<br>3. Run away<br><br>There.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would I be? Dont you know how anime girls work?<br>She would get confused and then think she actually must like him if she is doing all these lewd things unconsciously</br></br>  <br> he was the viewer´s self-insert <br>The real reason people hate her, and I hope we all know that self-inserting is only for the lowest kind of faggot.</br></br>  <br> not self-inserting </br>  <br>It really bothers me that it seems as though you're not joking at all.</br>  <br> not killing your ego and becoming one with the whole anime <br>Get on my level, faggot</br></br>  <br>Guilty of excessive smugness.</br>  <br> he enjoys watching women being dominant <br> calls others faggots. </br></br>  I want to insert into Ayumi repeatedly and hear her moan "Yuu onii chan".  <br>There is something off about her.<br>Her conductions were pretty annoying.</br></br>  <br>Because she's a moralfag. She doesn't have the authority/right/whatever to tell MC to fuck off. She's completely unrelated to MC, not part of that school student council.<br><br>She just stopped him because<br> People with powers should behave well, okay? <br><br>Basically a FemShirou<br><br>Disregarding all that, what matters is how many doujins will she get.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm still trying to figure out Pumpkin Scissors and Bleach.</br>  <br>Pumpkin Scissors is explained in the show - if the corruption endemic in the military is the hard skin of a pumpkin, their squad is the scissors used to cut it open.<br><br>As for Bleach, the leading theory is just that Kubo liked the Nirvana album so decided to call his manga that.</br></br></br>  <br>It may be the name of the monster.</br>  <br> Nirvana </br>  I like her.<br><br>I hate the faggot MC.</br></br>  Give me all your swets, you virgin scum!  <br>good show<br>8/10</br></br>  <br>I'm glad you like it, anon.</br>  <br>same, best show so far, gotta check the manga later</br>    No one talks about this show. Is it good?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127701234 <br> Also, learn to check the catalogue, there is already a thread <br><br>I hate generals. I hate the consolidation of fanbases.</br></br></br>  <br>There , ruined by an anon trying to fit in by being mad at anime only watchers.</br>   /a/ thinks this is a good show <br><br>will watch with extremely low expectations, got it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, threads after an episode came are such cancer.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127701234 <br> learn to check the catalogue <br> "&gt;MC has 3(THREE) male friends Has science gone too far?" <br>It's their fault.</br></br></br>  soiled it  isn't this the show people were super-pissed about when it got announced? because the art deviated from the source material?    <br>Yes.<br>People are so easily pissed.<br>It's fun to watch them.</br></br></br>  <br>if  is any indication then I'm really glad the art style changed</br>  <br>That's earlier art style. It gets better later. Not that I dislike the anime art.</br>  <br>Unless they do the principal's face right I refuse to watch it.</br>  <br><br>This shit is already out?</br></br>  <br>Yes<br><br>It's happening.</br></br></br>    So why doesn't Akari just clone three Asahis?  BEST GIRL WHEN  <br>Cause cool kids drink Kirin.</br>  <br>She's into NTR.</br>  <br>They got the reaction faces right, and at the end of the day, that's the best part of jitsu wa.</br>  <br> That shitty voice in the animu <br><br>RUINED</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Hestia?</br>  <br>I imagined alium with a stronger voice.</br>  <br>All of their voices are really light to me. But it was the first episode, so I'll give them time to work themselves into the role.</br>  <br>Well, it's much stronger than how the Seiyuu normally sounds anyway. I don't know how much further she can go.</br>  I was more worried for this than anything else this season. I actually don't mind the art anywhere nearly as much as I thought I would. Also Shiragami is illegally cute. <br><br>I am among the anons that have been participating in jitsu wa threads since forever. I despaired at seeing the concept art with you guys a while back, but I don't think you other guys will mind it much either.<br><br>Expressions are pretty good so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They greatly improved the artstyle since the original picture.</br>  <br>At least it wasn't her El Dorito voice</br>  <br>I kinda feel if she's to...cute. Cute in the moe since. We need more of her goofy expressions, which makes her how cute she really is</br>  <br>Hope to see that in the next episodes</br>  <br>M-maybe it'll be like the Katteni Kaizou adaptation and the art style will evolve every episode, mirroring how the art style in the source material changes.</br>  <br>Yes, this.<br><br>I don't blame them for not having it this episode, because this was before the artstyle change.<br><br>But goofy is what this series needs the most of.</br></br></br></br></br>  Who ED here?  <br>i liked it</br>  <br><br>Speaking of voices, I can't help but imagine Asahi talking about eggs.<br><br> I SAY CRYYYYY </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not bad, not bad at all.</br>  <br> Speaking of voices <br>Remember when the guy was singing the OP and Shirgami was mouthing the words? That was gross.</br></br>  <br><br>I can't look at the lower-right panel without laughing help</br></br>  <br>It was ok, but I would have preferred a female vocalist. Same goes for the OP.</br>  <br>I felt she was somewhat too cute too.<br><br>I think they took her being as cute as she is in the current mango and then moved it back so she would be that cute from the beginning.</br></br></br>  <br>Karen the cutest</br>  Some parts of the current OP animation are pretty dull, hopefully they'll be altered as secrets are uncovered.  <br>It's alright, but it really does not fit.</br>  <br>She's not Marina Inoue.<br><br>Seriously though, that's who I always imagined Alium to sound like.</br></br></br>  <br>OP &gt; ED<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/kgebiuhlrr.mp3<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>   Dumon ;-;   <br>They'll do the doteyes right, at least.</br>  are vampire girls fertile?<br><br>can i cum inside them without any fear?</br></br>  <br>That's what I like about it. More anime need random R&amp;B EDs.</br>  I'm not entirely sure why people rag on this show so much. True, the art isn't as good and it doesn't seem to have the pace of the manga, but I feel like everyone is forgetting that it takes about 5 chapters (until the introductions are done) for it to get the pace and the tone the manga generally has. I willing to wait and see if the anime ever lets itself go crazy.  <br>If her pure-blooded vampire dad was fertile then so is she.</br>  <br>It's not like the manga art didn't suck at first.<br><br>Maybe it will get better or grow on us like the manga did.</br></br></br>  <br>i liked it, it's not the best, but its definitely refreshing, glad they tried something different this time.</br>    <br>Why do the skirts in the anime look so shit compared to the ones in the manga?</br>  <br>Reminder:<br><br>Jitsu threads before <br> mangafags <br> love shit happening <br> dumpire winning  <br> everyone was happy <br><br>Jitsu threads after the announcement and designs<br> Fucking garbage <br> terrible designs not equal to the manga <br> blasphemy! <br><br>Jitsu threads after the first episode<br> animeonlyfags trying to fit <br> people defending the actual adaptation with no arguments <br> Mangafags leaving these threads until this shit ends <br><br>/a/ confirmed for worst board. <br><br>Also the adaptation is terrible, and everyone who likes this is a fucking retarded ANIMEONLYFAG.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The art is technically good, though. Which is the real issue people are having with it, it doesn't match up to the manga's (current) overly stylized look. J.C. Staff did a really good job adapting a similarly stylized style while making it more suited for animation just a couple of seasons ago.</br>  This chapter was fun.<br>I kinda avoided the manga because the art looked terrible tbh but the anime looks good. Does the art improve in the manga? Or is still the same?</br>  <br>Maybe you just need to learn to enjoy things and not be so bitter. I for one love the new anime art style, it's miles above the manga and actually makes dumbpire look and sound cute.</br>  <br>You've posted this like three times today. Fuck off with your copy pasta.</br>  <br>More detail</br>  <br>You're just instigating shit by posting this.</br>  <br>(Not that I necessarily dislike how the anime looks standalone, but it is quite a difference from the manga art. Another example would be Level E; though I feel the anime designs are a significant improvement over the manga art, I'm sure there are people who prefer Togashi's originals.)</br>  <br> Enjoy bad designs <br> Enjoy awful VA <br> Enjoy QUALITY <br> Enjoy how a good manga is ruined <br><br>Are you really trying?<br><br><br>Stay mad animeonlyfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Try reading this chapter http://bato.to/read/_/263183/jitsu-<wbr>wa-watashi-wa_v4_ch28_by_underdog-s<wbr>cans</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> implying you're not an animeonlyfag falseflagging to make the mangaonlyfags look bad </br>  <br><br>Please, stop.</br></br>  <br> Enjoy bad designs <br>See my post. I disagree. The new designs look cute actually enjoyable.<br> Enjoy awful VA <br>Again, I disagree. Dumbpire and MC's voice were pretty good and fitted the characters well.<br> Enjoy QUALITY <br>Haven't seen any yet, nor does it matter. After reading the disaster that is HxH for years, I'm used to shit art.<br> Enjoy how a good manga is ruined <br> Implying </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Enjoy how a good manga is ruined <br><br>I don't get this<br><br>How the fuck can a bad anime ruin a good manga?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was sort of surprised by the girl's VAs. I sort of expected Mikan's and Shiragami's voices to be lower. We'll see if it ends up screwing to much with the work.</br>  <br><br>It is going to be awful when animefags try to start Dumpire v. Alium. Our broship is not meant to falter.<br><br>Besides<br>Pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here you go. Chapter 1 of the manga was pretty awful, at least compared to everything that came after it. And  is absolutely right, chapter 28 is the best chapter to read if you're trying to decide whether or not to pick up the manga.</br>  <br>Anime is generally a way to revitalize a flagging manga. If the anime is good, it boosts sales of the tanks, which tells the magazines the manga is worth a damn. A bad anime can turn off people on the fence about starting a new manga, and can attach a stink to the name (think Kampfer).</br>   alium is being voiced by the same seiyuu as pic related <br>It just seems so weird.</br>  Fat chance in hell but I'm hopingthat the change the artstyle like the manga happens. <br>But already the VA's are dog-shit. And this thing breaks of low budget. The art is generic as it gets. Part of the attraction for the manga is the art. Everyone has this shit-eating stupid look on their face by default.</br>  <br>Man look at this kid trying to fit in with the Mangafags</br>   no chance in hell we'll get the school trip animated and see Dumpire having fun and being uncomfortable in moving water at the same time <br>Uwow~</br>  MC has THE most punchable face I have ever seen in anime.  <br>  Mikan's <br>How much lower do you want it? I don't think the VA could have gone much lower when she got pissed at the boys.</br></br>  <br>Karen chapter soon.</br>  <br>Well Mikan is pic related.</br>  <br>She went low went talking to the boys, but i meant her general talking voice seemed high (i was expecting altos from most of the cast, but most seem sopranos).</br>  <br>Did she even get any lines outside of that scene?</br>  <br>Would you happen to know how soon?</br>  <br>You can find out for yourself on senmanga.</br>  <br>I don't think she did, but her first lines were in a seemingly normal voice, I believe.</br>  Just so we are on the same page, the manga will still have it's own threads devoid of anime faggotry right?<br><br>It's too far and animeonlyfags will get spoiled, and nobody reading the manga would attempt at discussing the anime over there, right?<br><br>Can we agree on this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It will happen all the damn time. Just look how pissed fatefags get when they try to discuss the vn and not the UBW adaptation.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>The manga didn't get good until the girls were somewhat established and all the characters started interacting with each other.</br>  I still have my hopes up for this anime.  <br>Are they trying to save up on ink by drawing really tiny noses? The best thing in this manga is the noses </br>  <br>I thought the best things were the giant crazy eyes and cheeky toothy smiles</br>  This art is terrible. What new studio is doing this shit ?  <br><br>The only thing you have up is your dick anon.</br></br>  Quiet animeonlyfag here. I wanted to ask why that girl has a screw on her head but you people are too scary, I guess I'd better ignore the threads unless something stitch-wrothy happen.<br>And don't worry about that animeonlyfag status, if I enjoy the show enough until the season ends I'll pick the manga up. <br>Now be nice to each other.</br></br>  <br>I imagined something along Rukias voice from Bleach</br>  <br>Just like Youko is a vampire, Aizawa is a frankenstein.</br>  <br>She has a monster secret. You'll find out in a week or two.</br>  Why was the animation of her bobbing up and down here so awkward?<br><br><br>Read the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait never mind being catty about it, they showed her in the cockpit right at the end of the first episode.<br> AIZAWA NAGISA = AYY LMAO </br></br>  <br>Are you saying you came in here and asked a question before finishing the episode?</br>  <br>I cannot get over Alien's design. There is something blatantly wrong with it.</br>  <br>No on both accounts. I'm not the asker, and I'd forgotten about that stinger until I was in the middle of posting something unhelpful.</br>  <br>It's the eyes.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/iwggfofooj.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Jitsu Wa: Speed Force version.</br>  <br><br>Funny, I gave it the same rating. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, and while it does have some quality issues(And we were all expecting that), it hit all the right notes and most importantly, kept the Kansai-ben.<br><br>Chapter 85 is going to be a little late because everyone was gone at Anime Expo. As soon as it's proofed and the last page is redrawn I'll typeset it and send it out. Sorry for the delay.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I... I'm OKAY</br></br>  Shiragami seemed a lot bustier in the manga  <br>So, can we just have a show about the these three dudes? Seriously, they're more entertaining than the main characters.</br>  So, will the anime get to the point where Mikan stops being a terrible person?  It was so sweet and moe it gave me diabetese.  <br>Pretty much the only part of this manga that isn't complete trash</br>  <br>Insufficient levels of :&lt;</br>  <br>What other shit shows have you watched in order for this to be the best one, it was a horrible first episode. Just setting it up to be harem shit with romance that goes no where.<br><br>Want to talk about a romance with a good first episode look at Akagami.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Out of the whole cast Mikan and Sakura sound the worst.</br></br>  I liked the episode<br><br>Then I heard it was going to be a harem. Fucking hell Japan stop ruining everything, not everything needs multiple girls on one dick.</br></br>  <br>But only around three girls are actively hunting the MC's dick (until Durriken comes in). All the rest either will take any dick, are related to him, are actually men, or have horns.</br>  <br><br>Wait, was Teekyuu out already?</br></br>  I like that the male lead is very straightforward and makes solid, well-reasoned decisions all the time only to have the female lead be a dense moron. Interesting reversal on the classic formula.  <br>I also like how he kept making good decisions and they kept having even better outcomes, like how he accidentally used the word "friend" and that made her fall in love with him when using "couple" wouldn't've because of her constant insecurity about not having friends specifically.</br>  This is just like a sign of things to come for OPM. Threads aren't typically that huge for the manga, but the roaring sea of anime only cancer new friends is going to be horrific.  Holy shit. It's like they just made everything as moe as possible.<br><br>Also when the fuck are we ever going to catch up in terms of translations?</br></br>  <br><br>Never. Like I have said before, we're not going to catch up. Tank raws are much easier to work with than magazine raws. If we run out of tank chapters(Which we won't if we keep a chapter a week), we will stop scanlation until the next one comes out. We will never catch up.</br></br>   all these fucking series I was supposed to watch this season <br> nope, they're all shit <br><br>Gakkou Gurashi damn better deliver so I can watch something.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a week tomorrow. Will I see a new chapter?</br>  <br/>  <br>Welp. I couldn't go to Anime Expo and I can't read Jitsu. Might as well kill myself.<br><br>Thanks for the redirect.</br></br></br>  <br>TMS, there aren't new</br>  <br>Don't worry tripfag, everything will be daijobu.</br>  <br> horns <br> sweater <br> necktie <br> loves sweets <br><br>Best girl spotted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  they knocked it out of the park with Shiragami, she's cute as fuck, however I'm not a fan of Alien's VA. Her voice sounds nothing like what I'd pictured beforehand. Sensei and mikan are good too.  <br>The  Old woman[/spolier] is even more kawaii than in the manga </br>  <br>Didn't even watch the anime and i see this green hair shit <br>Im disgusted ruined her</br></br>  <br> /a/ confirmed for worst board <br> go to /v/ <br> literally just Reddit spilled all over <br> people using emoticons and acronyms unironically <br> unironic shitposting constantly <br> 8/10 threads nothing to do with video games, thread talking about pewdiepie and markiplier <br> very obviously an open underage scourge community attached to the board <br><br>And that's without even bringing up /b/ and /x/.

Yes, I know there is Madokami but I don't have an account there and I've no intention to go through the hassle of doing it just to read manga.</br>  <br><br>She'll always be one in my heart.</br></br>  Why he can't lie?  I'm really liking this series. For the first time, I like the main heroine, and this first episode was really fun. AOTS-tier for me.  <br>The reason why nowadays threads are shit is you.<br><br> Also the adaptation is terrible, and everyone who likes this is a fucking retarded ANIMEONLYFAG </br></br></br>  <br>Best options are Batoto, downloading from the scanlator's site, or reading a physical copy. That guy was just being a sperg.</br>  <br>Will the anime ruin the manga for me?</br>  <br>But VNs go to /jp/.</br>  <br>He wears his feelings on his shoulder.</br>    <br>Heh, what a sperg</br>  <br>Actually this is one of those few cases where harem isn't complete shit.</br>  i hope animeonlyfag don't ruin our usual peaceful manga thread  <br>He's a nice guy, so it works for him.</br>  <br>i bet 15 bucks you guys get the yahari threatment.</br>  <br><br>And the harem aspect only REALLY came into play in the manga pretty recently, as well, once all the plot-important girls realized they wanted Asahi's dick. For the most part though, it's just a romcom with monster girls.</br></br>  <br>just make sure your OP's are manga pages, and anime only's will mostly stay clear. Although the amount you're complaining about how it might happen is going to attract shitposters pretending to be animeonlyfags.</br>  I want her to grin at my dick  <br>Best options are almost always physical, scanlator site, batoto, in that order.

The OVA would have been better if they have kept Mikono and Amata bullshit out of it. I was irritated their 'spat' distracted from the plot.   TFW you watched EVOL to the shitastic end and feel like picking this up too <br> yet still haven't watched Genesis or any of the OVAs </br>  <br>Genesis was pretty great, but since you've already seen EVOL it's probably ruined for you, so no need to bother with it.<br><br>Serves you right for not watching in production order.</br></br></br>  <br>Genesis is even worse than Evol if you don't count the final episodes of the last.</br>  <br>Genesis was meh, but had great characters and a nice OST/Insert Songs.</br>  What with this show about romance, apocalypse and mechs?  <br>Crisis on Infinite Aquarions?</br>  <br>Gen made Genesis pretty alright. Always looked forward to his nonsensical training</br>    <br>Genesis was just very average throughout. Had maybe one standout episode for me (cosplay), and while it did get better as it went on, it still never rose above mediocre.<br><br>The first 2/3 of EVOL was much, much better than Genesis for me. Even if it went downhill hard, and ended on a really shitty note, I'd still call EVOL better as a whole.</br></br></br>    Never watched Aquarion but decided to check this out because I read it's a new story.

The notion that anyone else in the franchise is reincarnated is all just fanwank constantly guessing X is the reincarnation of Y.</br>  Is it physically possible to watch this without having seen the previous seasons?  <br>Ahh okay. That makes sense.</br>  <br> Implying Fudo died <br>Top kek</br></br>  <br>Good, nobody messes with Zessica reincarnation<br><br>The worst</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much. The notion that people are watching this to see Zessica get a good end is hilarious because there's no indication that any of these characters are reincarnation of EVOL characters especially when all of them died in content so they wouldn't reincarnate again. You're just wasting your time.</br>  <br>I don't recommend you watch this or the previous seasons at all.</br>  <br>Are you dumb? Yunoha and Jin's reious lives died content and they still reincarnated to become Yunoha and Jin.</br>  <br>*previous</br>  <br> Can I watch X without watching the previous series/seasons? <br>That's a retarded question about any show, doubly so about Aquarion.<br><br>Anyway, we're only one episode in so it's a bit early to call it, but Logos seems like complete shit so far, and the boring kind of shit. On the otherhand, the original Aquarion is great and EVOL is the incredibly enjoyable kind of shit.

I mean, fuck, even in series both casts were absolutely terrible at guessing who was who.</br></br></br>  <br> wanting anything directed by Kawamori post-Macross Plus </br>  <br> OVA starts in an alternate universe <br> its their past lives <br><br>You're an idiot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Where's it say it was an alternate universe? Oh wait. That's just you fanwanking.</br>  <br> Where's it say it was in the past? Oh wait. That's just you fanwanking. </br>  <br>They never actually state it was in the past though so I don't know what you're getting it</br>  <br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/enc<wbr>yclopedia/anime.php?id=16903<br><br>Read the summary. Shin and Yunoha's past life are from 1996.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>*1966</br>  <br>Considering all the kanji stuff, I doubt any fansubber will touch it.</br>  Is there anything in this show that isn't CG it all looks so disgusting. Fucking CG mechs are the worst thing ever.  I'm definitely not keeping my hopes up since Zessica can never have nice things, but I will have a laugh if Maia turns out to be related to her somehow. Even more if she's confirmed to be her reincarnation.<br><br>But yeah, so far she has everything to be reincarnated: unrequited love, treated like shit by all the cast, and on top of that being possessed by a shadow angel. She's got everything to come back and try again.</br></br>  <br> ANN </br>  <br> ANN <br><br>No thanks! Besides I already watched the OVA and they never stated they were their past lives and given how Aquarion works backwards in regards to this stuff they would be breaking their own rules yet again.</br></br></br>  <br>different robots mean different universe</br>  <br><br>These anons confirmed to be idots who like to samefag.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't Pollon previously rejected by Celiane in the ova or something? Conveniently they never showed Celiane's reaction to being tricked by her beloved into fucking the dog she previously rejected.</br>  I spent the entire first episode repeatedly saying "This is so stupid"<br><br>Granted, that's applied to every episode of Aquarion, but it was always a good thing until now.<br><br> Gattai with just two vectors <br> Horrid character designs <br> No AKINO OP <br> Set in modern Japan <br> Deava is based in an otaku cafe <br> Texting everywhere <br> The fight is just a game of Scrabble <br> MC does the dumb hand-to-the-sky cliche four times in one episode <br> "I'm the savior" <br> First gattai of the series is pretty damn creepy <br><br><br>I think I may have to drop this immediately, simply on the grounds that I don't think I could handle any of these shitters being reincarnations of characters I actually liked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ANN <br>It says right at the beginning of the OVA it's 1966.<br><br><br>But do Aquarion and EVOL take place in the future, past, or entirely outside the setting of the real world?</br></br></br></br></br>  How did MIX get her breasts back  <br>EVOL started out with a different Aquarion.<br><br> But I do hope it's a different continuity/universe so I can just ignore Logos and pretend it never happened </br></br></br>  <br> and Yunoha clearly still had issues with being kept apart from him by his death. <br>The whole graveyard arc was about Yunoha moving on. She supposedly had accepted Yin's death but because they got popular they kept shoehorning them in the rest of the show, even though they weren't relevant anymore. And that's proven by how Jin was turned into the frog out of nowhere in the director's cut. It was all pandering after the graveyard arc, but she supposedly had accepted his death already.</br></br>  <br> Okada's a hack, how she manages to be one of the few anime screenwriters with any degree of name recognition is beyond my comprehension. <br><br>I can name maybe five anime screenwriters, and the only one of those who isn't a hack is Konaka.</br></br></br>  <br> past lives <br> getting "flashbacks" of their Evol lives </br></br>  You all forget none of the reincarnation rules matter because they will somehow retcon the whole shit to whatever they feel like.  Zessica reincarnated with her true soulmate, Kagura, who wanted to be a hero this time. Because he got over Mikono and Sylvia, he didn't need his smell power anymore to find her. <br><br>The OVA is basis for first episode because it foreshadows them.</br></br>  <br><br> "past lives" having flashbacks to their current lives <br>B</br></br></br>  <br>It's one thing to accept that his death, it's another to want to be with him again to such a degree that her soul is destined to meet his again in 12000 years.</br>  Zessica's going to turn out to be Alisia's reincarnation, Apollonnius' and Ceilaine's daughter, in love with her dog.  <br> Konaka not a hack just for the TV versions of Hellsing and Giant Robo </br>  <br><br>checked</br></br>  <br> Zessica reincarnated with her true soulmate, Kagura <br> who wanted to be a hero this time <br>4/10 here's your pity reply</br></br></br>  <br><br> They didn't watch the OVA. </br></br>  This went to shit fast.  <br><br>You seem in denial, anon-kun. AmataxMikono are once more solidified as a OTP in episode 0 of this.</br></br>  <br>  this is what delusional shippers believe </br>  <br>But I'm not shipping AmataxZessica or MikonoxKagura.</br>  <br> But I'm not shipping AmataxZessica or MikonoxKagura. <br>Forgot to mention KaguraxZessica there, retarded shipper.</br></br>  <br>It's a valid pairing, butthurt-kun. Are you mad about what they ship tease for real and present as healthy rather than obsessive and destructive "love" like Zessica's one sided feelings and Kagura's brainwashed affection?<br><br>Plus it rustles the tumblr landwhales and fat otaku waifushits. It's a great couple.</br></br></br>  <br>God, I wish Big Bang got more OVA screentime</br>  <br>Andy and MIX needed more screentime.</br>  <br> It's a valid pairing, butthurt-kun <br>As valid as pairing Sazanka with Andy. Last minute damage control bullshit deserves to be treated as such.<br><br> and present as healthy <br>  two fags that tried to kill each other before  <br>  pushed against each other at the last minute because plot demands it <br>  healthy <br>Thanks for the laugh. Shippers are truly cancer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   MC and FeMC are both autist <br>Oh boy.</br>  <br>MC isn't autistic, he's the savior. Get it right you pleb.</br>  <br>So, is he like the reincarnation of Onii-sama?</br>  I already expected this to be shit with those character designs and no Akino  and the fact that its Aquarion , but fuck if this doesn't look to surpass even my incredibly low expectations. And I doubt the threads will even be half as enjoyable as EVOL's were. What a blunder, I just want to go listen to Gekkou Symphonia now.  <br> all this butthurt <br><br>Your tears are delicious.</br></br></br>  <br>  le butthurt meme because I can't argue back <br>thanks, faggot</br></br>    I like it.    <br><br>I don't need to "argue." The reason behind everyone's affection was stupid. But at least this one isn't as bad written as Zessica's "love" for Amata which made her the pathetic buttmonkey of the show.</br></br>  <br>Well, to be honest, Zessica and Kagura have specifically that one card from the card game, one cover of the manga and novels and there's confirmed nothing happens between them there so... that image doesn't say much.<br><br>Zessica and Kagura still lust after Amata and Mikono in the rest of the merchandise, though.</br></br></br>  <br> But at least this one isn't as bad written <br>A last minute cop out is as badly written as the rest of the romance of the show. You just don't have any problem with it because it allows you to ship a retarded couple. But for anyone that isn't a retarded shipper and actually cares about good writing and good characterization (none of which this show had anyways), is just as bad if not worse than the rest of the shit the show came up with.</br></br>  <br>Zessica was a pathetic buttmonkey because Okada is the queen of melodrama. Honestly you're talking like the whole fiasco was the character's fault when you should know the writers were just incompetent and clearly had no idea of what they were doing, and it shows characters suffered for this.</br>  <br>You do realize is not Zessica's fault her heartbreak was dragged out until she looked pathetic, right? Okada admitted she overdid it. Characters are not at fault for what the writers decide to do with them.</br>  Logos is so shit.<br>I had to listen to EVOL OP2 just to cleanse the bad taste out of my mouth.<br>https://vimeo.com/80681958</br></br>  Seems like everyone went into this with expectations too high. I recall thinking EVOL had a pretty shit and contrived first episode too. It was frustratingly cringe-y and it kinda got worse from there. At least so far this show seems to be mildly self-aware of how ridiculous it is.<br> The male lead goes on about how he's the savior and other react with reasonable disregard. <br> The base is in the middle of the city in a stupid cafe and uses a park as a launch point. <br> Kanji is some sort of mystical power and infecting word characters has a powerful albeit absurd affect on the world. <br><br>At least in this regard it's laughable enough to be enjoyable despite what's likely going to be a mess of a plot.<br><br>On the other hand, the animation is pretty shit and the vaguely 80s/90s anime throwback design decisions don't really work that well. And the music sucks, or at least is pretty unmemorable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> s and there's confirmed nothing happens between them there <br><br>That's wrong. The manga is very different too, Zessica turned into a guy.</br></br></br>  00/the OVA was fantastic. I wasn't ecstatic about EVOL after the mishap that was the entire second half but the music and silliness made it work well.<br><br>Logos seems really lackluster. The characters aren't compelling, the concept of kanji seems limited (especially with how it was displayed in this episode with the enemy design) and the music isn't appealing. Maybe May'n is the only thing making the OP feel unique but it also wasn't particularly good. It and the ED were mediocre.<br><br><br>Somehow even after EVOL, I had high expectations. It has the Aquarion name but not the staff or features that made the series enjoyable. It's only the first episode so who knows where it will go from there but the episode wasn't very gripping. Especially not after the Genesis x EVOL stuff.<br><br>At least the Aquarion design is neat. A bit jarring when put into perspective with the others but nonetheless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, the manga and LN have nothing to happen between Kagura and Zessica. They don't even talk in the volume that features them in the cover.</br>  <br><br><br>She looked pathetic because she came out as a shallow cunt who fell for a guy for no reason and had her entire life orbiting around him even to destroy her self worth.<br><br><br> last minute cop out <br> implying they got together there <br><br>No, the ending just sets the roots for a positive, teasing and equal relationship that can happen in the future. <br><br><br><br> Zessica and Kagura still lust after Amata and Mikono in the rest of the merchandise, though. <br><br>That's not true? Only the outdated merch they do, like the one you posted. And the LN does have Kagura/Zessica content. I dropped the manga after Zessica turned ZessY, but Kagura's 'fixation' on Mikono is downplayed. Kagura's even said he was over Mikono by the guy who was actually in the project. Isn't this OVA even plain to you he doesn't give a fuck about her anymore?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I mean, the manga and LN have nothing to happen between Kagura and Zessica. <br><br>The LN ends up with more romantic hints between them. Kagura is attracted to her scent when he frees her. It expands the ending, I don't know if I'll call it love, but there's obvious attraction.<br><br>Did you read the manga? The last volume? All the covers are mean to portray the couples. You can argue it's good or bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Seems like everyone went into this with expectations too high <br>Not even remotely. It always looked like it'd be the shits.<br> I recall thinking EVOL had a pretty shit and contrived first episode too. <br>On the contrary, I thought it did a much better job in that it took its time to show you the setting and the two main characters, letting you get to know them some so that you'd be a bit more invested when the shit hit the fan immediately after. With Logos we don't know a damn thing about our mains other than one can barely squeak out two words, and the other is Captain fucking Autismo: Savior of the Universe.<br> At least so far this show seems to be mildly self-aware of how ridiculous it is. <br>Oh god, lets not. Aquarion has always been intentionally hammy, but I'm not about to let this pile off the hook by saying its only being bad "ironically".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She looked pathetic because she came out as a shallow cunt who fell for a guy for no reason and had her entire life orbiting around him even to destroy her self worth. <br>Zessica is a fictional character. She doesn't have a say in what happens to her. She looked pathetic because the writers were incompetent at handling her character. You're talking like she decided to become pathetic on her own.<br><br> No, the ending just sets the roots for a positive, teasing and equal relationship that can happen in the future.  <br>It's a cop out. Kagura and Zessica have never interacted in the entirety of the show, neither have showed interest in each other until they made Kagura give up and Zessica to accept she got rejected for real. It's a cop out at its finest.<br><br>  Only the outdated merch they do, like the one you posted. <br>No? Recent merch has Kagura screaming his typical Kuso-onna. The booklet also has them saying lines to Amata and Mikono respectively. Zessica I don't know, I haven't seen much of her.<br><br> but Kagura's 'fixation' on Mikono is downplayed.  <br>More like Kagura gets even less screentime. Most of his scenes are cut off and he's more of a background character. But he's just as obsessed as he was in the anime. He just doesn't get enough screentime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hurr muh development <br> huurr they tried to kill each other <br> hurr they fought! <br><br>Like Kawamori gives a fuck: Miriya and Max had no development.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kagura is attracted to her scent when he frees her. <br>That was a fake spoiler by 2ch, I think.<br><br> Did you read the manga? The last volume? All the covers are mean to portray the couples. You can argue it's good or bad. <br>Yeah and in that regard is the same as the anime. Kagura and Zessica never interact until the last minute, and they're at best, friends. There's no romantic interactions between them. And the cover of the second volume, in which they have Kagura and Zessica, has no interactions between them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Seems like everyone went into this with expectations too high <br>Really? Most of the posts I see are people expecting more bestiality jokes and gleefully waiting for how this one will fuck up worse than evol.</br></br>  <br> No? Recent merch has Kagura screaming his typical Kuso-onna. <br><br>Because he's pre-finale Kagura. Like your pic related. Kagura no longer gives a fuck about Mikono. This is official and canon. You have an entire OVA of him around Mikono and not acknowledging her presence. Wake up and smell the fact Kagura was brainwashed into giving a fuck about Mikono by Mykage.<br><br>Mikono/Kagura shippers are the worse. Even Kawamori stated his feelings weren't real love when he discussed Amata's and Kagura's feelings for Mikono.<br><br> Zessica is a fictional character. She doesn't have a say in what happens to her <br><br>We judge her as she's portrayed. We conclude easily her relationship with Amata was negative and poisonous. While her relationship with Kagura is postive and proactive. That's how is portrayed on screen. Take the shipping goggles aside and just consider it platonic on both cases. <br><br> Kagura and Zessica have never interacted in the entirety of the show, <br><br>So what, they can interact now and they have in this OVA. Accept it and move on.<br><br> More like Kagura gets even less screentime. <br><br>Everyone gets less screentime. But no, because he has an additional scene when he thinks back about how some other woman (Zessica) smells. But the ZessY bullshit made me drop it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mangaka likes Zessica more than Mikono, and even included Zessica going on a pseudo-date with Amata, with Amata actually giving a fuck about her. She wasn't very fond of Kagura and Zessica as a couple.</br></br>  <br> That was a fake spoiler by 2ch, I think. <br>Huh? It wasn't a fake.<br><br> eah and in that regard is the same as the anime. <br>They have more interaction. Why are you bringing the second volume? I'm asking about the fifth. And the covers are sill meant to portray the official couples according to the mangaka.<br><br>You can argue it's canon in mangaverse but not the anime, because the events played up differently as I said. But one thing is certain: the staff is trying to expand on Kagura and Zessica as couple in Evol. If was a finished story, it means we'll consider their future, but this is still an ongoing franchise with a focus on reincarnations. I'll just be cautious with your way of thinking.<br><br>Last OVA drew a direct comparison of Kagura and Zessica with Apollo and Sylvia in their dynamics which wasn't innocent on their part and this is by the staff now working on Logos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  aquarion LOVE reminded me of how shit amata and mikono were  <br> Because he's pre-finale Kagura. Like your pic related. Kagura no longer gives a fuck about Mikono. <br>Merch is still merch. Kagura is still sold as Mikono's stalker. Like it or not.<br><br> Kagura was brainwashed into giving a fuck about Mikono by Mykage. <br>And now you're making up shit like this?<br><br> We judge her as she's portrayed. <br>No, you're talking like she decided to become pathetic. I'm judging her from what the writers decided to make with her. It isn't her fault she was made to cling to Amata until she was barely a shadow of her former self. It isn't Kagura's fault either he was forced to act out of character because they needed him out of the way. It isn't Amata's fault either he was made into a retarded white knight for Mikono until he looked like an asshole.<br><br>You're talking like Zessica's pathetic development is a natural consequence of her love for Amata, when it's just the writers being incompetent. I should say, you're the one who should take the shipping googles off.<br><br> they can interact now and they have in this OVA <br>So, you admit you don't give a fuck about characterization and consistency as long as you get to ship whatever you'd like? Thanks for confirming your retarded logic. I mean, I don't give a shit if you want to delude yourself that this is any good, but don't go around saying it makes perfect sense and is somehow positive for both of them as characters.<br><br>  because he has an additional scene when he thinks back about how some other woman (Zessica) smells. <br>Which is the very basis of what drove him towards Mikono. Same shit, different woman. Wow.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> I'm asking about the fifth. <br>Yeah, and? They don't interact much, Mention one interaction, then. If anything, Zessica gets more scenes and even goes on a date with Amata. You keep saying they interact more without bringing anything in specific.</br></br>  <br>Ohhh, that game in which Kagura and Zessica barely talk outside battle? And where their only interactions are when everyone are being lovey dovey with each other and Zessica needs to be sweet with someone? The game where Zessica is almost paired up with Kira? I see. Nice example you got there.</br>  <br>  Everyone forgot about Kagura, Jin and Crea and so they joined much later <br>You aren't helping yourself here.</br></br>  <br> Merch is still merch. Kagura is still sold as Mikono's stalker. Like it or not. <br><br>Of course he is anon. <br><br> And now you're making up shit like this? <br><br>Because it's true, if you actually paid attention to his character instead of parroting that he was out of character last episode. He was only obsessed with shit woman because Mykage emotionally manipulated and brainwashed him into thinking only she could give a fuck about him in a planet full of men. He couldn't give a damn after realizing he was wrong.<br><br>Are you one of the tumblr landwhales who is convinced he really loved her and are buttmad because he no longer cares?<br><br> No, you're talking like she decided to become pathetic. <br>She did. Grant her character agency. Her "love" for Amata was meant to be unhealthy and destroy her.<br><br> It isn't Amata's fault either he was made into a retarded white knight for Mikono until he looked like an asshole. <br><br><br>He never endangered people like Zessica did with MIX when she went full retard out of her self pity.<br><br> So, you admit you don't give a fuck about characterization and consistency  <br><br>They do. Time has passed, Zessica and Kagura moved on. Unlike you, they aren't hung over shit characters like Amata or Mikono anymore. <br><br> Which is the very basis of what drove him towards Mikono. Same shit, different woman. Wow. <br><br>It just means he's possibly attracted, while in case of Mikono, her smell was special because Mykage brainwashed him to track her like a dog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would never imply something is bad "ironically" and if it even were, I would never imply that's a reason to let it off the hook. I'm saying that this show is not necessarily a lost cause just because it's so far silly. Those awful things might be what makes it worthwhile. There's a reason so many of us watched VVV despite it's many shortcomings. These sorts of absurd, over-the-top, 1-D characters put into certain situations can be entertaining enough. Of course, there's no guarantee that will happen.<br><br>And while the first episode of EVOL tried to invest you in the characters a little, it was still a really sudden attraction while not knowing a whole lot about anyone. Stutter girl gets as much characterization because we see her walking old people to the bus stop and she makes her own straps.<br><br><br>I mean to say people are expecting as much of a ride from the start-gate as EVOL. When you start watching EVOL you don't have the same feelings about it as you do at the end, especially after watching Genesis. EVOL has collectively lowered the expectations that Aquarion is good, but it heightened the sense that the series is poorly written and leads to zaniness, even more so than the weirdness of the first series. People expected this to be a shit first episode, but they also expected to get that same pleasure from the first episode here as they did from the entire season of EVOL.<br><br>Though looking back through the thread, there are really only a few people legitimately complaining. I guess the above applies to those guys. The rest seem to be eagerly anticipating the possibilities or are just bitching about kaguraxzessica.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because it's true, <br>Nowhere is said Mykage brainwashed Kagura into liking Mikono. Kagura being attracted to Mikono because of her smell was something he did on his own. You're making shit out of what you think happened without providing any quote or screenshot on it.<br><br> He was only obsessed with shit woman because Mykage emotionally manipulated and brainwashed him into thinking only she could give a fuck about him in a planet full of men. <br>This is sure consistent with how he was wishing Mykage would wake up and stop Izumo from bullying him in the beginning, and how he called Mykage Mykage-sama. Because Mykage's relationship with Kagura is very consistent throughout the show.<br><br> Grant her character agency. <br>She has none. She's a fictional character, dude.<br><br> Her "love" for Amata was meant to be unhealthy and destroy her. <br>Stop making shit up. Okada herself admitted she overdid it. It wasn't meant to look like that. You keep ignoring this.<br><br> They do. <br>You sure don't. Who cares about consistent characterization and good writing when I can be a retarded shipper over these characters that have never interacted in the entirety of the show until the writers needed them out fo the way? This is how stupid you sound.<br><br> It just means he's possibly attracted, while in case of Mikono, her smell was special because Mykage brainwashed him to track her like a dog. <br>He never did, and there's nowhere in the show they said this. You're making shit up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Of course he is anon. <br>I like how you ignore the new stamps of Kagura screaming kuso-onna. Those that came out at anime expo.</br></br>  <br> Grant her character agency <br>That assumes you think the writer was actually writing a character, and not just stringing events along until things happen.<br> Unlike you, they aren't hung over shit characters like Amata or Mikono anymore. <br>They also aren't people. Again, this isn't about "character agency" since they aren't alive. They are written to fit whatever the writer wanted them to fit. The worse the writing the harder you have to force things to fit.<br><br>Seriously, "agency?" Do characters in poorly written fanfics also have agency? Do I suddenly have to make sense out the incomprehensible relationships in "My Immortal" because I clearly don't understand the complex relationships of Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way?<br><br> because Mykage emotionally manipulated and brainwashed him <br>Did you also forget the part where he's Amato's other half and that both were destined to be at silvie's side once again? That he was naturally attracted to her in much the same way Amato was?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nowhere is said Mykage brainwashed Kagura into liking Mikono. <br><br>Did you skip the last episodes? It shows clearly Mykage thorning and caging a young Kagura into his track dog to lure him to Sylvia incarnation, purposefully planting in his head how nobody will love him but her. That's why Kawamori stated Kagura never loved her. I suggest you to rewatch and to look at the interviews Kawamori gave about the difference of Amata's and Kagura's feelings.<br><br>Kagura was never into Mikono, he was only chasing after the idea of being loved and he realized, after meeting Zessica, that he could be loved by other women because this woman liked his other self, Amata. That's also in the commentaries of the episode by the staff. Zessica broke the spell Mykage had placed on Kagura which weighted his soul and Kagura broke the spell on Zessica. So Mykage threw them out because he couldn't longer control them.<br><br>I thought the episode had been very direct with this, but I guess I was wrong. This doesn't mean the writing wasn't a disaster sometimes.<br><br> his is sure consistent with how he was wishing Mykage would wake up and stop Izumo from bullying him in the beginning, and how he called Mykage Mykage-sama. <br><br>Are you that unfamiliar with Stockholm Syndrome? He was brought up as a child by Mykage and he had no idea Izumo was his father.<br><br> Stop making shit up. Okada herself admitted she overdid it. It wasn't meant to look like that. You keep ignoring this. <br><br>You keep ignoring it keeps happening in other media which have nothing to do with Okada, like LN, manga, superobot works and manga used Kawamori's idea that Zessica, not MIX would turn male (and thank fuck the anime didn't have that).<br><br> Who cares about consistent characterization and good writing <br><br>Which was never in Aquarion to begin with?<br><br> You're making shit up. <br><br>I'm not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Also the second half of this was horribly drab. So, Logos is about a bunch of faggots with shitty haircuts are fighting an evil wizard who can destroy the world by using MOONRUNES? And Aquarion seems like an afterthought added because the basic premise was so poor that the only way to get traction was to try to arbitrarily hitch it to a different IP and hope it would sell that way? I like how he totally force-gattai'd with that slut, though, and it made her moist. The thick fluffy wimp girl is already losing.  <br> You keep ignoring it keeps happening in other media which have nothing to do with Okada <br>How does this have to do with Zessica's pathetic heartbreak being Okada's fault and not hers?<br><br> Are you that unfamiliar with Stockholm Syndrome? He was brought up as a child by Mykage and he had no idea Izumo was his father. <br>  It shows clearly Mykage thorning and caging a young Kagura into his track dog to lure him to Sylvia incarnation, purposefully planting in his head how nobody will love him but her.  <br>This is a show were they made up shit along the way. You may not know this but Mykage and Kagura's relationship was never truly defined and they kept contradicting themselves a lot. Hell, Kagura and Amata ahd the same conversation about Kagura's upbringing with Mykage twice and Kagura only mentions the abuse towards the final episode. You're not trying to make look an inconsistent relationship like this something planned from the start, because it obviously wasn't. There was never a stockholm syndrome, just the writers making shit along the way.<br><br> That's why Kawamori stated Kagura never loved her. I suggest you to rewatch and to look at the interviews Kawamori gave about the difference of Amata's and Kagura's feelings. <br>Oh, so we're taking the word from the guy that was so biased towards his favorite characters he forced them even though everyone told him it was a bad idea? Yeah, no.<br><br> That's also in the commentaries of the episode by the staff. Zessica broke the spell Mykage had placed on Kagura which weighted his soul and Kagura broke the spell on Zessica. <br>Ah, yes, the spell that we've never heard off in the entirety of the show and that conveniently shows up at the last minute, in the staff comments! Another great example you got there.<br><br> Which was never in Aquarion to begin with? <br>It doesn't give you a free pass into being stupid.<br><br> I'm not. <br>Yeah? You're twisting things to your convenience and ignoring what they're not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be quite the bait and switch for white to "win" (if you can even call it that) the savior. I mean, what's her name is plastered all over the fucking ED. Gee that kinda pissed me off.</br>  <br>Did you watch the show when it was airing?</br>  <br>You seem to be stuck in the idea that characters have control over what happens to them and that it's their fault the consequences of their actions.<br><br>They're fictional characters. They're written by people. These people are responsible for what happens to them.<br><br>Also it seems you think everything was planned from the start. Did you watch this in one sit through or what? It was pretty apparent to anyone watching it when it was airing that they were making shit up as they went. They admitted they had only planned out the first half, IIRC. Everything after the finale is just damage control.</br></br></br></br></br>  I am so fucking confused right now.  <br> He was brought up as a child by Mykage and he had no idea Izumo was his father. <br>Izumo being Amata and Kagura's dad was made up, though. He was hinted to have kindapped Alicia and stolen her from Amata's real dad. A guy with the exact same hair as Amata was one of Izumo's subordinates. Though that was dropped and Izumo was made to be Amata's real dad.<br><br> superobot works <br>top kek<br>Also, as far as I know Zessica doesn't turn into a guy in super robot wars. Unless I missed something, and I'm sure I didn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  Well I just watched the whole thing and nothing made any sense.  <br>Vectors are made - belongs to the old dude while cafe uses the launching mechanism that reminds of angels technology. Old duded was happy that MC was successful. So most likely the old dude isn't even evil.</br>  <br> That's also in the commentaries of the episode by the staff. Zessica broke the spell Mykage had placed on Kagura which weighted his soul and Kagura broke the spell on Zessica. <br>Most of the things you're mentioning along with what happens in the manga and LN are just afterthoughts, though. If you read the interviews, nowhere was mentioned nothing about Kagura being attracted to Zessica or something. Everything came after the finale to make it look convincing. Is not really supporting your arguments that you're bringing only afterthoughts to what happened after the show ended, which are intentionally made to be lined up to what happened in the finale, like the staff comments or merchandise, for example.<br><br>And EVOL is a show where the writing staff was full retard, so most things coming from them (SPECIALLY kawamori) can't be trusted because they're biased and are trying to cover up the fact that they didn't really knew what kind of direction the show would take. Kawamori being away and Okada too, it becomes apparent the writing staff didn't knew what to do, and it shows.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If you read the interviews <br>*if you read the interviews before the finale<br>In case you think I'm trying to start shit up.</br></br></br>  <br> Old duded was happy that MC was successful. So most likely the old dude isn't even evil. <br><br>I don't know, something about the twisters, people being choked to near death and highway damage makes me think otherwise. Though they did mention there were no casualties so maybe this was all a part of the plan.</br></br></br>  I Want loli to have lots of sex.  <br> If you read the interviews, nowhere was mentioned nothing about Kagura being attracted to Zessica or something <br><br>Not that anon, but the director, not Kawamori, the person who was left behind to do the job, brings up Kagura is impressed and smitten by Zessica after the last episode. And that they have a "good atmosphere" there (this is what elevens use for 'romantic chemistry'). Zessica's feelings are a lot more ambiguous, but Kagura is talking reverse for Zessica which is what he does for the girl he fancies. I think Aquarion Love continues on it. It doesn't mean Zessica likes him back.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I'm  I agree, before the finale, but after it, I'm not sure they make a secret that Kagura has taken a liking to Zessica. I would disagree they are a canon couple because we aren't sure what she feels about it.</br>  So Logos is its own series? I thought it was just an OVA?  <br>operation</br>   villain has superpowers that only affect Eastern Asia <br> the rest of the world doesn't even give a fuck while China and Japan grapple with their crazy kanji problems </br>  <br> 7 worlds <br>this series is gonna be another hell of a trainwreck, isn't it</br></br>  <br>But they were already together, Jin was the frog.</br>  <br>It means we have another ten years of this shit to put up with.</br>  Is this continuation of something or original?  <br>Don't you mean 12,000 years?</br>  <br>That already makes her better than mikono.</br>  <br> implying <br>She has the whole ED for her<br>Also she's the very first girl.</br></br></br>  So we'll never have a peaceful Logos thread without Zessicafuckers shitting it?  <br>That's because her VA is a singer. Maia has the OP, merchandise and first Gattai.</br>  <br>The kanji powers affect everything relating to the word/concept. Why they didn't use it on person, I have no idea.</br>  <br>Because then everybody dies, including Kotomine.</br>  <br>If years of mecha anime has taught me anything, it's because of something something about the wills of humanity being worth more than words can describe.</br>  how fucked am I if not even Zessica could hold me to the ending of EVOL?<br><br>or should I not even bother since no kawamori's wild ride?</br></br>  the ending of evol was just bad<br><br>not only that, it also paints a portrait of Fudo as not a badass mentor who has transcended time and space, but rather a cosmic troll who is honestly a huge fucking dick. EVOL only happened because he shit on the big gay angel so hard 12,000 years ago by tricking him into becoming a dogfucker. Or something like that. Mikono and Amata also bust out some love and peace newtype rainbow faggotry in there, too, because their hippy shit was stronger than HOTBLOODED INFINITE PUNCHING.</br></br>  <br>Because it was a last minute decision.</br>  <br> I'd still call EVOL better as a whole <br>I'd rather have a generic burger than one with both caviar and dog feces.  Also you're a faggot making your opinion objectively wrong by default. </br></br>  <br>Because they're desperate for her to be relevant.</br>  <br> Rewatch Nichijou. </br>  <br>Maybe old dude is Fudo and he is preparing the cast to fight against the real enemy on the 2nd half?</br>  <br>Well apparently they'll do it, not sure if under Commie's tag and not sure how they are going to pull it off with all the kanji but hopefully they deliver some toaster breaking typesetting.</br>   Jack enemy Vector to GATTAI <br> Also override the pilot's control of their own body <br> muh savior <br>This MC is amusing. At least he is weird and silly enough for an Aquarion MC.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if it is something to the effect of "preparing/testing" the cast, but the part about endangering everyone is what makes me uncertain.

It's an alternative to the way you've seen. I'm surprised you've not seen it sooner.</br>  <br> Is this そ? <br>Yes.<br> If so (pun not intended), how often does it look like this and why? <br>Just a stylistic choice, I guess. I see it quite often.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it's そ. It's a font variation that's pretty common.</br>  <br>Faggot</br>    <br>Terrible</br>  <br>It's 朝から, so that means that he's been saying strange things since morning.</br>  <br>Actually, 朝から here doesn't really imply that. It's kind of an idiomatic use and just refers to the instant that they're talking about. I.e., it's "in the morning" and not "since morning". <br><br>http://gogen-allguide.com/a/asappar<wbr>a.html talks a little bit about this usage.<br><br> 「朝っぱらから～」の形で、朝早くするのにふさわしくないことを非難した<wbr>り、からかったりする時に用いる。</wbr> <br>It works the same way for 朝から.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127698590 <br> that spit bubble at the end <br>Yuck.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127698590 <br>I feel bad for you, man. Idol otaku are basically the most pathetic lifeforms to exist, tapeworms are a real step above you.</br>  <br>It just shows how well lubricated her mouth is to receive your cock.</br>  <br>Oh, the more you know I guess. Thanks for correcting me on that.<br>So going by that, it would be "You've been saying weird things all morning", right?</br></br>    <br>You can put it that way depending on context (there's nothing literally implying "all"). Exact changes in tense between Japanese and English are kind of tough because they just don't use the the same ones in the same situations.</br>  <br>Well technically it does still mean "since morning", it just implies that it is still that morning. "since morning" is of course a bad translation though as you described<br><br><br>It's a rhetorical question, not a statement. Like "What do you think you're doing (already) saying such weird things"</br></br></br></br>  <br>朝っぱらから is not the same as 朝から</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127698905 <br>You're going nuts for something mass-produced by normies, starring normies.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127698905 <br>Stop shitposting<br><br>You're not even disguising off topic discussion</br></br></br>  <br> Well technically it does still mean "since morning" <br>I mean, if you wouldn't translate it as that then how can you say it means that? It's not like there's a law that says から=since.<br><br><br>Care to offer some evidence? Of course it's not literally the same, but the meaning is similar. They're not saying that they've been saying things like this for a period of time since morning, and are (likely) just referring to a single utterance from the listener. <br><br>Of course, if there's some specific context where they have been constantly saying this stuff, it could mean that, but the way it's used here certainly shouldn't call that to mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it was morning in context so thats why i said that</br>  <br><br><br>Please, don't respond to him. When we ignore him he stops with the idol bullshit. If you keep responding, he'll keep posting. <br><br>Don't feed the troll.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could you post the whole thing where you got that, I'm guessing it's a manga or something. It would help on the context since some people are having trouble here.</br>  <br> I mean, if you wouldn't translate it as that then how can you say it means that <br>Because literal and actual meaning and all that.<br>朝から literally means "from morning"<br>"since" is wrong I suppose because it specifically implies that time has passed, but it's not that far off.<br><br>Say you're transating an easy kotowaza like 蛙の子は蛙. You could say that it means "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree" or you could translate it as "A frog's child is also a frog" and explain that it's a metaphor. Whether you translate the metaphor or not is kind of up to preference.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off normie</br>  <br>I still don't really get it, these idols are basically like Miss America, or something? Asian girls caking on tons of makeup and walking around saying vapid things trying to attain admiration and validation from old men?</br>  fug, I wish I had a kindle. reading LNs might actually be fun then, because lookups doesn't seem much of a hassle  <br>I think that's kind of a false analogy. You can explain a Japanese idiom and it will make sense, it's not like you're changing the meaning of the individual concepts (frog still means frog, etc). It's just that we don't have that particular saying in English.<br><br>With 朝から v "since morning", the actual meaning of the words is different. "Since" and "from" mean time has passed, but 朝から doesn't. It's not about literal vs figurative, it's just wrong. <br><br>Saying "since morning is technically right" misses the entire point of translation. There aren't really direct equivalencies. It sounds to me like you think of 朝から as "since morning", and then do some mental gymnastics to remember "since morning can really just mean morning in Japanese in some situations". Why is that better/easier than just accepting there can be times when から does not mean "since", in any sense of the word?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is the girl on the right so goddamn slow? Is being a retard her  fake  personality?</br>  <br>Kind of, but combine it with a culture that fetishizes purity and you wind up with dozens of vapid whores acting as cute and innocent as possible 5 minutes after fucking producers.</br>  <br>No it's basically girls pretending to be anime characters. The approach is pretty different than Western "idols".</br>  anon, using a Kindle won't fix shitty 中二 writing  <br/>  <br>Please don't be that faggot who equates certain chuuni light novels with all light novels. That's fucking embarrassing.</br>  <br><br>Why do people do this. The whole point of the thread is to get help learning Japanese, and that is exactly what op was asking for. This happens almost every time some one asks for help. <br><br>I mean its not a big deal, because usually someone does give an informative post, but it just so strange to me. It's not even a fun way of shit posting. Its just being retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hm, I'm seeing some faults in my own logic here, though. 朝から certainly conjures up a different mental image from simply 朝, so there's some meaning attributed to the から but I'm not sure how to express it. I'm just going to bow out from this, because I'm not sure what I'm trying to debate.</br>  <br>Translations are never perfect, if you translate it as "in the morning" you implicitly requiring some knowledge about why it would be bad to say such things in the morning.<br><br>Going back to the Japanese, the implication is that it is bad to say inappropriate things early just because that implies you will be saying them for longer. If you're starting to say inappropriate things in the morning, and continue saying such things all day, that is obviously worse than only saying them at night. For this reason, "In the morning" is also a very flawed translation, because the problem is not really that they are saying them in the morning - if they said them in the morning and stopped, it would be no different really than if they only said them at some other time of day.<br><br>So basically, the から is actually important, and realizing that it means "starting in the morning and not stopping" is important to the nuance. I disagree that "from" always implies time has passed, but either way I think it isn't really worse than just translating it to "in the morning". Both lose some of the meaning.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind people liking 3D things but all the girls look the same and he's absolutely not even talking about the hobby and how it relates to studying Japanese.<br>Asians all look the same.</br></br>  <br>kek, are you harry potter autist</br>  <br> Care to offer some evidence? <br>I can't quite link some hard evidence because it's not a set expression like you say, it's just 朝 with the particle から but there's literally no sentence involving 朝から that has the "in the morning" meaning you say it has.<br>http://jisho.org/search/%E6%9C%9D%E<wbr>3%81%8B%E3%82%89%20%23sentences<br><br>The thing is like  said, the closest translation is "from morning" which alone is not natural English and unfortunately "since morning" has a nuance that the morning has already passed and から doesn't have that nuance at all.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Because people make fun of dumb or dumbly phrased questions. Also mentioning "translation" in this thread triggers people.<br><br>If he had posted the sentence and asked if it meant something like such and such then he probably would have gotten a better response.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the guy comes off like he's joking. It's a silly sentence and he doesn't explain what his issue is with his own understanding. Put in shitty question, get out shitty answers. And he got helpful responses nevertheless.</br>  <br>I read the question wrong. I thought he made the sentence and asked if he said it right.</br>  Is it impossible to find Yukio Mishima's books online? Both Google and DuckDuckGo give nothing of value.  <br> The thing is like  (You) said, the closest translation is "from morning" which alone is not natural English and unfortunately "since morning" has a nuance that the morning has already passed and から doesn't have that nuance at all. <br>朝っぱらから has the same nuance as 朝から, it's really just an emphasized version.</br></br>  <br>That's only because you aren't used to seeing them. I thought a similar thing when I started watching idol variety shows, but now I can tell them apart just as well as I can tell white people apart. You just need to get used to it.</br>  <br>Yeah, I agree (see ). I really just took issue with the notion that "since morning is technically right", because there is no "technically right" here.</br>  <br>Alright ill bite since you like this hobby. <br><br>What's a good show or whatever that I should watch? Is it good Japanese listening practice? I would imagine so.</br></br></br>  I don't think 朝から is the same as 朝の終わりから. The point of start is during the morning, I think, not after.  <br>Who are you disagreeing with here? I don't think anyone has argued that it meant that.</br>  <br>Adding: I mean compared to 朝から used in this relevant situation. Certainly 朝から can be used in a more normal way.</br>  <br>Just buy ebook versions off amazon.</br>  <br>Sorry, it seemed like they were.</br>  <br>Most people start with AKBINGO.

I guess you can translate it as "in the morning" but only if the context is still in the morning.</br>  <br>As one of the guys who was originally debating this I'm surprised this didn't turn into a shitfest. It's nice to see language arguments without the vitriol.</br>  <br>Shouldn't you be on a boat or something?</br>  <br>Not him, but I feel something along the lines of "saying such strange things so early [in the morning]" would be a little more accurate, but who really cares at this point</br>   Firefox update now requires some bullshit that ruins rikaisama <br>Well, finally have an excuse to dump fireshit at least</br>  <br>thanks for the warning m8</br>  <br>Elaborate?

Either way, context would help, because we can't exactly tell you what makes sense if we don't know what's going on. が can have a possessive meaning, which is what I would think it means here. It looks to me like "the remains of the dream(s) of soldiers and summer grass".</br>  <br>Then I don't really see the big deal with the extension signing thing. The FAQ seems to indicate the corporation itself will distribute these special builds too, so it'll be the same as Firefox except with another name and the signing requirement turned off.</br>  <br>It's nit-picky, but is it necessarily only from the beginning of the morning? I'd say it's just ambiguously putting the start (から) somewhere during the morning.</br>   download an episode of AKBingo because idolfag will literally not shut the fuck up about it <br> watch it <br> want to kill self now <br><br>Thanks idolfag-kun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's hardly the end of the world, but I'd prefer to remain on Mozilla's track if possible and it just represents another company deciding that it's easier to lock down the user experience than try to fix all the fringe cases that come about otherwise.</br>  <br>you're right, it is ambigious</br>  <br>You're right, and the same is true with "since" because it's not like the morning has a definite end.</br>  Does the なんと here mean anything, or is it just a filler word?<br>怒ったよくばりじいさんは、なんと、シロを殴り殺してしまったのです。</br>  <br>It means something like "would you believe it", just an interjection to show that the following thing is surprising or unexpected.</br>  Why does rikai sometimes give stuff with completely different kanji Is there a way to prevent this?  <br>Sounds like a problem with epwing?

Did you, once you reached a good level in Japanese, wanted to be able to write them and, if yes, how hard was it ?</br></br></br>  <br>I got a pretty strong desire to learn to write them while I was on study abroad. My level was sort of half decent (couldn't really read large paragraphs at the time but I was in advanced classes lel) and I found heisig to help a lot. Not to start a huge argument over RTK, but it really does make it an awful lot easier to produce them from nothing, and it improved my writing abilities even as someone who'd already been learning for a couple years.</br>  <br>it's a lot of work today then tomorrow you can write the stupid thing by memory it's magic</br>  <br>It definitely gets easier the longer you wait. You can tell things look wrong even if you don't know the right way to do it.<br><br>But if you really do want to learn to write in the near future, and are willing to keep up with it (as in, practice writing frequency so you don't just lose everything) then it definitely is worth doing RTK. Just make sure to do vocab and grammar at the same time so that you at least learn something if you stop. Also, don't expect to remember how to write all the kanji forever just from doing RTK.</br></br></br>   (66.3% correct) <br>fuck</br>  How do I clear the suggestion history for Windows IME?<br><br>Accidentally made typos a couple of times and now those typos keep appearing when I try to type the words every single time, it pisses me off!</br></br>  <br> ! <br>Take it easy. hot head.</br></br>  <br> studied 1139 cards 74.4% correct <br>I did 100 new cards today</br></br>  <br>and 100 the day before too</br>  <br>I'm in the same boat.

Or more likely a generic "one's self"? 自分 seems fuck-useless to me because it's so vague, (welcome to Japanese hurr hurr) but I'm probably just not understanding how it's used.   watching some animus <br> sign with text on it so decide to pause and read it <br> mfw these subs </br></br>  <br>It would help if you posted a specific example rather than a vague description. 自分 can be used as a first person pronoun (it's common with military types) but it can also be a second person pronoun (especially in 関西弁). It's also "self".</br>  <br>Good luck. Don't ever skip a day.</br>  <br>Well, I don't really have specific example, I'm mostly just thinking of a general construct I've seen a couple times. To rephrase, if the speaker has already established both first person (俺) and second person (テメー) pronouns in the conversation, is it generally safe to assume that 自分 is being used as a third person pronoun like "one," or "they"?</br>  <br>Yeah, usually.</br>  <br>What's the issue?</br>  I have a Core 2k/6k deck in Anki. I've picked up some words like 運命 already but I don't want to wait several thousand cards for them to enter rotation. How do I add them early?  Any tips for reading a visual novel for the first time? it goes really slowly  <br>I obviously need glasses. Read mates as males</br>  <br>Hah, yea I actually did at first as well.</br>  <br> Increasing the total number of seen cards by 10% in a single day <br> not a complete beginner <br>wow you sure proved me wrong ;-)</br></br></br>  <br>Skip non-dialogue parts entirely or find an easier VN.</br>  <br>you can't learn  math </br>   finished reps with 20 new cards <br> read for an hour or so <br> listening for about thirty minutes or so <br> went to work today also <br><br>This is a adult life</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just got to stick with it. It was discouraging for me at first since I was reading so slow that I just wanted to quit and go back and  grind anki  but I stuck with it and turned out fine.</br>  <br>For me it's exhausting doing more then 10 lines at a time, Did that happen to you? how long did it take you to get used to it</br>  <br> I will never be able to read Hartshorne comfortably </br>  <br><br>I get 70% every day, whether I do 10 new cards or 50. Don't feel bad.</br></br>  Are you replaying うたわれるもの in Japanese in anticipation for 偽りの仮面, anons?  <br>Neah, since the first was mediocre enough to drop the second probably will be too</br>  <br>All-ages game that is not going to be released on the PC so nope.</br>  Trying to translate "sliding on cool evening shadows" into Japanese. <br><br>Context: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zfc<wbr>3I8IyrX0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The best I can come up with is「夕の涼しげな影で滑走する」<br><br>涼しげな because "cool" implies refreshing.<br>で because the situation is the cool evening shadows.<br><br>Is this sensible?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>夕暮れの冷涼たる蔭に滑りて</br>  I'm going to japan for 6 years to study, starting 2017. Should I start over and learn kanji while writing them on paper? (I guess shouldn't be that difficult since I can read kanji pretty well, do not like the idea of re-studying 5k~ kanji tho) I feel like college there would be shit if I can't physically write.  <br>I would practice handwriting actual sentences<br> 5k~ kanji <br>lel</br></br></br>  <br>I've thought about it, only because Hakuoro is voiced. If I ever did, I wouldn't suffer through playing on Hard 3 again.</br>  <br>Thanks for the input, guess I have a whole year and a half to practice handwriting. All I do is study and watch animu anyways.</br>  <br>you know 5000 kanji?</br>  <br>What the fuck, I could've sworn I wrote 2000. Lol not even close to 5000 anon, I'm sorry.</br>  <br>Man, I even fucked up on the particle. Thanks. <br><br>Why would 冷涼たる be preferable over 涼しげな?<br><br>Is it because 冷涼たる conveys "refreshingly cool"?</br></br></br></br></br>  Can't really come up with any translation of these lines in the box that make sense in context:<br><br> She was master's first magical slave (and her first partner) <br> That's why she's so clingy you know? It's only natural <br> Though we were captured together, (not sure how to interpet 場合によっちゃ here given the definitions at http://thesaurus.weblio.jp/content/<wbr>場合によっちゃ )</wbr> <br> I might've been master's first though... <br><br>Think I'm missing something here, any ideas?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just 中二ed it up, don't think too hard about it.</br>  How useful do you think production is at the beginner levels? I know I should be reading, but I'm basically addicted to this chatting app.  <br>Have you not practised them much at all?<br>There are patterns in them that allow you to distinguish stroke order just by looking at them.<br><br>I've been picking up kanji as words on anki, but each new kanji I write out ~50 times in my notebook. A good chunk of the kanji I'm picking up now, I can write them properly without checking stroke order.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We were captured together and depending on how things are/could be I may have been his first. She's saying she's not actually sure whether or not the other person is the first one, I guess.</br>  <br>Oops, meant for . Also note the ブツブツ on the side, she's obviously whining about something.</br>  <br>場合によっては If things had been (slightly) different...<br><br> あの通りべったり甘々だろ？可愛がられて当然だよな <br>And she's super attached and 甘えん坊ish. It's only natural that he would treat her preciously.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's obviously whining about the fact that she could have been the first to get the D</br>  <br>here, I think  has it more correct, for the record.</br>  <br><br> 場合によっては If things had been (slightly) different... <br><br>Oh it basically should be part of the next bubble right, I'm an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, of course. You don't generally just trail off for no reason.</br>  <br> 場合によっては If things had been (slightly) different... <br>I don't think so. I think it saying that in some cases she was the master's first. <br><br>Sou Matome N3 has a note about this. によっては and によって mean different things.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't think so. I think it saying that in some cases she was the master's first.  <br>That makes absolutely no sense.</br></br>  <br> Sou Matome N3 has a note about this. によっては and によって mean different things. <br>Not that guy but this doesn't have anything to do with that. It's a hypothetical, and the past tense after it is "might have been". Also </br></br>  <br>Yea I guess you're right. I thought only ば and たら could be hypothetical.</br>  "実にや"という単語の意味を知りたいです。  <br>You should try looking at the right side of your image</br>  When you went through your first visual novel, did you look up grammar you didn't understand even if you still got the gist of it and are able to follow the dialogue and narration? Or do you just keep going despite not really understanding the grammar completely?  <br><br>I play it with a text hooker that allows me to look up the definition of any words I don't understand instantly.<br><br> And there's one like every sentence, everything takes 5x longer than it should to play. ;_; </br></br></br></br>  <br>I mostly kept going, but if you don't understand it by the 4th or 5th time you should probably look it up.<br><br>Just like vocabulary - you can learn a lot just by reading and not doing SRS, but if you add the things you fail to read several times to SRS it will save you a lot of time in the long run.</br></br></br>  I can't learn Japanese. All these months of learning comes to nothing. Fucking nips. God damn them. <br><br>It's all over. I'll never rub orange juice on the doorknob. <br><br>Life is kill.</br></br></br></br>  What font does djt use?  <br>The default one.</br>  <br><br>The default.<br><br>I switched to some other font once, which did look nice, but it fucked with English fonts.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> three months <br><br>Look it's fucking nothing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In Firefox you can specify fonts for a language, so your English fonts will be unaffected by your better aliased Japanese fonts.</br>  <br> these months <br> read as "three months" <br><br> youcantlearnenglish.jpg </br></br></br></br>  <br>Measuring your learning in months, and lamenting your time wasted still results in the same joke -- that you thought it wouldn't take you years.</br>  I've been studying for a couple of years but my production is so bad from doing nothing but reading. I make at least one error per sentence.

I can quickly pick up the meaning of new vocab in anki, but all the homophones are killing me.  必ず僕らは出会うだろう<br>I saw this phrase when I was googling around, from what looks like a Japanese twitter. How come 必ず and だろう are used together? Don't they indicate very different probabilities?</br>  <br>Don't think about it too hard. We have that in English too. "We will probably meet them for sure" isn't something anyone would think twice about when they hear.<br><br>For example, in this case is it likely that the actual probability is as implied by だろう, but 必ず was added as a "reassurance", for example to calm someone down if they are worried about not meeting them, even though it may not be true.</br></br></br>  <br> Don't think about it too hard. <br>Strangely reassuring. <br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  Who here decided to grind vocab by translating a whole game for himself after finishing taekim's stuff?<br><br>I know I did. This fucker was one hell of a ride but I fucking did it.

YES.<br><br> translating a whole game <br><br>NO. That's "mount stupid" overconfidence. First, get a grip of how Japanese works, inmerse yourself in it, but don'r try to look for equivalents that soon. It cripples your reading comprehension.<br><br> after finishing taekim's stuff <br><br>Eh, well, Tae Kim kinda is basic-basic (even the so called Advanced stuff he writes is kid basic knowledge) so I would not jump into media until at least having read a real grammar book, like DOBJG.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>O look its that mount stupid meme again. <br>Just fuck off with your forced maymays</br></br>  <br>He says the screen works fine.<br><br>He's not mad or anything.</br></br></br>  <br>It's something along the lines of<br>Thank you for your inquiry,<br>The screen is functioning properly so I hope you're open for further discussion</br></br></br>  <br>How much is there in DOBJG that isn't in Tae Kim honestly.</br>  <br>For starters, particles. Tae Kim is like "this particle is for x and y uses, that's it lmao". DOJG, just the first, basic one, gives you 7 entries just for に.<br><br>The Notes and Related Expressions for each entry also serve to show how wide is the scope of the language. Tae Kim gives a half assed paragraph to explain a concept and calls it a day.<br><br>Don't take me wrong, I think it's a great casual and initial approach. But people should be aware of how lacking it is and don't get ahead of themselves too much, that soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot.</br>  しかしとでもとがとけれどもとけれどとけどは同じですか？  <br>Jesus christ what a hard sentence to parse. Change the words between the と's to katakana or something next time.<br><br>And no they are not identical. I'm sure you can find differences by googling it or looking at a synonym dictionary.</br></br></br>  <br>There's an app that I've been using a whole lot lately. It might not be your thing but it would help with production. <br><br>It's called ひまチャット. I have it on Android. It's basically kik for Japanese people from what I've experienced.<br><br>That said I'm still a beginner so take my advice lightly but I'm addicted to this app.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it possible to work through DOJG like Tae Kim? I hear it's quite lengthy and difficult to stomach, though I imagine the added explanations are very helpful. Perhaps it would be better to try JFE or Genki.</br>   騎士さなるつうて田舎とび出してきたっつうてに <br>I'm certain the first part is 騎士になる, but what dialect or slang is this?

You'd be better off finding an actual intermediate textbook or other resource, like AIATIJ, nihongonomori, Kanzen master, etc.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks a lot for clearing that up. And I'll look up the stuff you recommended.<br><br>How about things like JFE or Genki, can they take you up to the same level as Kanzen master could?</br></br></br>  <br>Have no experience with JFE, but not Genki, those are beginner books like Tae Kim</br>  <br>Your prior post in this thread about the app actually made me write that lang8 entry.

Then the MCC announcement, which looked like it was going to be my biggest video game wish turned into reality, until it released and was the most disappointing thing I've ever bought. MCC being unplayable for months and having absolute shit features destroyed any hope of a big resurgence in the old Halo community.<br><br>Now they're gonna bait me into getting excited for Halo 5 by including Chief's squad.

Sucks we wont ever get to see Kurt animated. Heres to hoping we get some sort of movie or series based off Ghost of Onyx. Kurt is based as fuck. Most bad ass Spartan of them all.</br>  <br>Linda was always described as a Red head anon, although she shouldn't have that man face.</br>  <br>Its the opposite for me. Sure, they're finally in a game, but half the game won't even be about them, it'll be about Locke's squad that no one gives a shit about except for Buck. And knowing 343 they could very well end up killing some or all of blue team by the end of it.<br><br>I'd seriously consider getting an xbone for blue team, but not for THIS.</br></br></br>  <br>We'll always have our memories anon. And each other.<br><br><br>Lore may have been utterly fucked in that game but damn if it wasn't a fun as hell game. Hell, even in the quasi clusterfuck of balancing in the beta it was still shitloads of fun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>On the plus side Nathan Fillion is a damn good actor and him being Buck should have enough Charisma to easily carry all of the Locke missions. I hope they cast properly for Kelly, Fred, and Linda's voices.</br>  <br>If those bastards kill off a Blue Team member they better make sure they go out like a total hard ass. They have some big shoes to fill in order to top Kurt and Sam's deaths.</br>  <br>Even though it was a clusterfuck of a story and messed up a ton of the lore it still managed to really capture the hopelessness of Reach. Seeing your team slowly getting picked off one after the other as the Covenant only got bigger and bigger was really well done. The scene where the spartan two in your team died sacrificing himself only to have dozens of more ships appear was extremely impactful and nailed the theme of Reach.</br>  <br><br><br>Honestly, I never cared for the story in any of the games all that much. I was always in it for the split-screen LAN multiplayer with my buddies, whether it was playing 4v4 CTF in Halo 1, 2, 3 or running an 8 man big team battle squad into matchmaking on Reach, the fun has always been in local multiplayer.<br><br>I and all my friends thought that Halo 4 had terrible multiplayer in all aspects (and shitty framerates in split screen) so we skipped it.<br><br>Halo 5 Multiplayer Beta got all of us excited for Halo again, because the combat felt a lot more like Halo than Halo 4 (kill-cams and iron sights aside) and the added movement options and promised forge enhancements added a lot to the game and promised lots of fun in multiplayer.<br><br>Then they announced that they'd be sacrificing split-screen to the graphics gods, and that pretty much killed Halo 5 for us.<br><br>As for Halo: Legends, it was alright in places (and pretty bad in other places) but overall it would have been better if it was a little less anime and a little more Halo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wow, im actually seeing a full on Halo thread on /a/. This board really does have great taste. I actually always thought that Halo has an extremely well written and deep lore. Probably one of the best ones ive seen in a video game franchise. Glad to see im not the only one on here who thinks so.  Eric Nylund, please come back.  Can anyone explain just what the fuck the Flood is?  <br>I gained a lot more appreciation for Reach after Halo 4 came out. God damn I miss the days of old Bungie. Bnet was my internet home before 4chan, I browsed those forums every day and read all of the weekly updates. Now new Bungie is disgusting and their website has become an abomination.</br>  <br>Obligatory space zombie/parasites</br>  <br>A parasitic organism that takes over the hosts body. Sort of a hivemind as it is controlled and lead by the gravemind.</br>  <br> Now new Bungie is disgusting and their website has become an abomination. <br>Destiny had so much potential, too. It could have been as good as the original Planetside, but instead they made a shitty PSO with a Call of Duty-ish multiplayer tacked on.</br></br>  <br> PAN UP PAN UP PAN UP <br><br>LRN2DIRECTION TBH</br></br></br>  <br>The Halo franchise has the best lore of any well-known sci-fi franchise since Star Wars IMO.</br>  <br>Bungie's version<br> An extragalactic threat that waged war with the Forerunners. It infects organic hosts and takes over their nervous system. <br>343 version<br> the precursors liquified themselves and turned into the flood to test the forerunners and the ancient humans and the ancient humans were the ones who passed the test, not the forerunners so the didact destroyed them but our lore is so fucked up we have to make two didacts now xD </br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally nothing wrong with the expanded version; now that the Flood isn't just another generic hivemind</br>  <br>Starcraft was really popular when Halo: CE was developed. It's basically Bungie's version of the Zerg.</br>   tfw no qt 3.14 Spartan waifu   <br>That is some damn good taste you got there anon. I completely agree. Halo is a universe that is just begging for stuff to be made about it. Heres to hopefully getting a movie of The Fall of Reach.</br>  <br>Probably a pretty accurate analysis, seeing how Halo started life as an RTS.</br>  <br>Originally they were some threat that came from another Galaxy. In the current lore they're the remnants of a race called the Precursors. the precursors went around raising up budding civilizations and seeding worlds and followed what they called The Mantle of protection which basically was to protect the Galaxy and their creations. The forernners and Humanity were both uplifted by them. The forerunners were Daddy's favorite child for a while and were supposed to inherit the Mantle but the Precursors saw their bullshit and how they treated other races and decided humanity would get it. The Forerunners said Fuck You and killed them all. Some escaped and turned themselves into a powder that would reform into themselves later and spread outside the Galaxy. the rage and fear pent up in the race that never expected it however, turned this powder into a parasite. Eventually space humans find the powder and use it to domesticate animals until shit starts going wrong. They run from the flood into forerunner space and dont tell them about it. Forerunners once again say fuck you and fight humanity because humanity glasses one planet and doesn't tell them about the flood. Humanity gets rofl stomped and devolved back to earth, then split into races to prevent us from going back to space. We don't tell them about the flood and they reappear to destroy forerunners and such.</br>  <br>You mean, the Zerg and the Flood are just ripoffs of the Tyranids</br>  <br>Except humans didn't pass the test, and it wasn't a test but a revenge. The precursors that went mad were jerks, while the forerunners were arrogant space elves.</br>  <br>Star Wars is an awfully low bar to set.<br><br>Star Wars media was best when it stepped away from the established lore.</br></br></br>  <br>I knew this was going to pop up as soon as I read .</br>   there will never be a 12/24/50 episode Halo series following a Spartan II and his progression from abducted child to super soldier <br><br>I'd give it to Kyoani with as much budget as they could possibly use.</br></br>  <br>Aren't tyranids just ripoffs of the arachnids from Starship Troopers? Like how the humanity-zerg-protoss trio is the same ripoff of the novel's races.</br>  <br>More like the Zerg and the Tyranids ripped off the Xenomorphs and the Bugs and each other over several iterations. Original Tyranids are markedly different from current day Tyranids and the Starcraft II Zerg have more than a few art choices inspired by the newer Tyranids that were absent in their original incarnation (most notably, they're a lot more purple and spikey).<br><br>It's never as simple as it seems.</br></br></br>  <br>Pre-343 lore, it was left vague and implied they might be extragalactic.<br><br>Post-343... There were super advanced aliens called Precursors that went around playing god. They made humans and forerunners, and picked humans to inherent the galaxy. This caused the forerunners to chimp out and genocide them. Some survived by turning themselves into powder. Ancient humans found the powder and put on their pets, which turned into the first flood outbreak. Turns out staying in powdermode for so long turned them into crazy assholes that just want all their creations to suffer as one big flesh blob.</br></br></br>  <br>What are the odds of us ever getting a full 24 episode anime series based around The Fall of Reach being done by a competent animation studio? Inb4 0%</br>  <br>Actually 2nd from the left  is supposed to be a waifu. And the reason the Dub for Persona Dancing has a different Rise.</br>  <br> you'll never be a strong alpha spartan with a tsundere ODST gf <br> you'll never tease her that she can't even lift a brute shot <br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>The Fall of Reach would work perfectly as a movie. There's no reason not to go through with it. A Halo movie has been teased and talked about for like 8 years now, they should just do it. <br><br>Most video game franchises would suck as movies, but Halo has enough lore and source material for it to be good.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah 0%<br><br>And as we draw ever closer to October I suspect we won't get that live action Spielberg series that is supposedly still in the works. Only with nothing to show for it.</br></br></br>  <br>0%</br>  <br>Wasn't that Nightfall? I didn't watch it.</br>  <br>I don't really mind 343i's additions to the prehistoric Halo lore, they had to add a lot of detail that Bungie simply omitted, and if it was Bungie adding that detail, they would have probably done something similar. When universes grow, part of it inevitably get stupid and confusing.<br><br>On the other hand what I can't stand about 343i is their art direction, Bungie's aesthetic was clean and utilitarian, and alien stuff looked alien and ornamental but still clean and pleasing to the eye. 343 on the other hand went overboard with tiny details and stuffing their models full of normal maps and glowy bits and shit, and their aliens are just generic "look at me I'm so alien even my shit glows orange," and it's all really busy and garish and taxing to the eye particularly in combat.</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully 0% for kyoani animating it</br>  <br>No, Nightfall was Ridley I think. And it was fucking trash as expected. Had so little to do with anything Halo that you could have changed a few names, removed verbal references, etc, and nobody would even know it was related.</br>  <br>If you were a Spartan then chances are that you'd become asexual.</br>  <br>While I agree that Halo is the new hotness and that Star Wars' EU lore is amazing, what about 40k?</br>  <br>I haven't been keeping up, are Spartan-II's still impotent from all the strength treatments and the sex-drive suppression drugs, or did 343i retcon that out?</br>  <br>I'd be okay with Kyoani doing it if they spent the amount of detail they did with those hibike webms on ODST and Spartan armors instead. My dick would explode to see some high quality Mark IV or V</br>  <br> KyoAni SoL set on Reach shortly before the Covenant invade <br>I never knew I wanted this so much</br></br>  <br>Honestly the fact that we somehow havent gotten a movie of Fall of Reach with how solid the source material is yet is just down right saddening. Halo is one of the few video game franchises that is literally begging to have movies made of it due to how tight and good the source material is.</br>  <br>Still the worst shit fanbase.</br>  Off-topic threads on /a/ are the best.  <br>After seeing what KyoAni can do in the action scenes from Kyoukai no Kanata I would donate money to get them to make a Halo series.<br> KyoAni adds in Slice of Life elements because it's KyoAni. <br> SoL of the Spartan IIs hanging out and training together. <br>Would actually be really entertaining.<br><br><br>Japan would have to care about Halo first, and since the Japanese hate Xbox none of them care about Halo. So yeah I'm gonna go with 0%.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still like that, although Spartan II's have been able to decommission them selves and have their implants removed since the Graphic novel and that one guy in Nightfall.</br>  <br>40k isn't really sci-fi (well, neither is Star Wars, but whatever) and it's not particularly interesting lore-wise. Everything is really predictable and samey (aside from details) and there's basically two archetypes, once-glorious civilization struggling to survive or unfathomable horrors from the depths of space that would fuck up everybody if only they just got their shit together.</br>  <br>To my knowledge I believe so. I know that most of the remaining Spartan-II's arent actually that old since they had multiple treatments done to rapidly induce growth. Its been awhile though since I read the books so I could be off.</br>  <br> has a real animu made by elevens <br> off-topic <br><br>You wut m8?<br><br><br>Kyoani could nail it. They still have enough mecha capability to make the armor look fantastic. And yeah some SoL elements to break up the horrendous suffering would be good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There were never any "sex-drive suppression" drugs. That was just a possible side effect from one of the augmentations that didn't necessarily happen to all (if any) of them.<br><br>Their upbringing probably curbed their sex life more than the enhancements.</br></br></br>  <br> aren't that old <br>Isn't John like 50-60 now, not including time spent in slipspace/cryo?</br></br>  <br>Nigga what are you talking about?<br>Halo is basically the only game they actually like out of the xbox line up, not counting those timed exclusive Idolmasters and Tales of Vesperia.<br>They actually took the time to write the OVAs for it. They could of said no you know?</br></br></br>  <br> There were never any "sex-drive suppression" drugs <br>IIRC, it was specifically mentioned in one of the books that their sex drive was suppressed (although I don't recall if they said anything about drugs or mental conditioning or plain old education) to make them better warriors, but I could be wrong since Halo 3 was still new when I read any of the Halo books.</br></br>  <br>Mid 40s</br>  <br><br>deus ex machina</br></br>   spartan IIs fucking <br>It would be an aggressive pile of muscle, with skin as white as milk and crisscrossed with scars.</br>  <br>Wasn't it a side effect of the pituitary augments or whatever?</br>  <br>Don't see whats so off-topic about discussing Halo in a thread on the Halo anime shorts.</br>  <br>He's 46 years old not including cryo. With it I think his body is just reaching 40.</br>  <br>Yeah true I guess I'm retarded. I need to watch Halo Legends. I forgot that it even existed until this thread reminded me. Gonna download it now.<br><br>I raise my odds to 2%.</br></br></br>  <br>They were paid by the gaijins to do it, they didn't want to make it</br>  <br>Maybe, the two factoids I remember from that time is that all active Spartan-IIs were impotent and that the women were indistinguishable from the men when wearing armor (any armor, not just MJOLNIR).</br>  <br>I don't think so, since they artificially induced puberty they had to also repress sex drive with other drugs.<br><br><br>You just reminded me I really want to see spartan smile and that i'm mad 343 makes it easy for you to tell the women from the men in their armors.</br></br></br></br>   tfw Halo peaked in popularity back in 2008 and no movie was made. <br> tfw it is now 2015 and Halo isn't the king anymore, meaning that with every passing year the chance of a Halo movie being made grows smaller and smaller. Especially since 343 keeps fucking up and destroying the franchise. </br>  <br>Nigga of course they got paid for it, but they could of declined.<br>Time used making the OVAs could be used to be paid making something else, they were all well known directors and writers after all.</br></br>  <br>God, if they made a well-animated Halo anime series and put in the Spartan-smile I'd be so goddamn happy.</br>  <br>with 343 trying to focus on the expanded universe we better at least get an Oly Oly Oxen Free too.</br>    <br><br>I dont remember much about the Spartan-ll's augments but I do remember that the Spartan 3's got fucked over and were given some extremely brutal and fucked up augments.The only thing I remember about the Spartan-ll's treatments where that they were really nasty and had a terribly low survival chance. If I recall even some of the people who did survive came out fucked up in some way or another.</br></br>  <br>Japs referenced Halo in To love ru which is mad popular.</br>  <br>Wasn't the fact you couldn't tell them apart because of the unisex focus of the armor?<br>Anyway it was bungie that started the trend anyway with Reach and those spartan "ASSets"<br>In Halo 3 it kept with the lore and choosing female would just change the spartan's voice.</br></br></br>  <br> spartan IVs.jpg </br>    <br>No, Spartan-II women were all huge and manly due to all the augments they went through to make them more effective combatants.</br>  <br> there will never be a movie  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/1_5csXHegb0  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Spartan II was the brutal under the knife type of augs.<br>Spartan III where the streamlined version that did away with that granting a 100% success rate but a shorter and weaker result, still miles ahead of a regular human though.</br></br>  <br>I think I remember hearing somewhere that Halo is actually pretty popular in Japan. Its one of the few Xbox titles that Japan really likes. If I recall a few of the directors working on Halo Legends actually liked Halo's story. Though I could be wrong. Its been awhile since I heard that.</br>  <br>Really? I've never seen that series but I'm curious, what was the reference?</br>  <br>Technicacally Cat was a III not a II and didn't receive the same enhancements that the IIs did which was one reason she wasnt 7ft tall like Jorge.</br>   343 Industries.   <br>It was in ep 5 of the first series iirc. It was two shots, one with MC posing with the assault rifle, the other one was a space battle around High Charity.</br>  <br>To call the Spartan lll augments streamlined isnt necessarily true. When Kurt saw some of the augments and chemicals they were pumping into the Spartan lll's he was visibly bothered by it and even commented asking why they were using those. The Spartan lll's were made faster and instead of being augmented to be super soldiers that were hard to kill, they pumped them with chemicals and augments that forcefully kept them alive even after sustaining lethal damage until the adrenaline wore off. They were designed to be suicide soldiers. They sent hundreds of them on suicide attacks with almost zero chance of survival. They werent even given proper armor. They were given shitty SPI armor that couldnt even take a single plasma pistol shot.</br>  <br>Spartan 3 augmentations were much safer than the II augmentations, and almost as good. What really fucked some of them over was an extra drug that let them out-berserk brutes.</br>  <br>Didn't the spartan-II Maria from the first Graphic Novel look pretty normal despite the armor? Hell, hadn't she retired?<br><br>Hell, speaking of the original Graphic Novel, is all of that canon?</br></br></br>  <br> Spartan 3 augmentations were much safer than the II <br>This part is true<br> almost as good <br>This part isn't, or at least wasn't in the Ghosts of Onyx and Halo: Reach, I dunno if 343 changed it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didnt Kurt get really disturbed and pissed off when he found out that they made the Spartan-lll's to keep going after taking lethal damage? I remember the scene when one of his team members gets hit by a needler round and after the fight is over said he thinks he got hit and then dies instantly and Kurt checks the wound and comments that his entire left side was blown away and he as missing most of his ribs and organs.</br>  <br><br>Here you go<br>https://<span>youtu.be/y44v663W-F0  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> female spartan lls gangbanging the ODST manlet <br>This is too much for my weak dick.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Kurt is the one who ordered and signed off on those enhancements. I think it''s mentioned when he's watching Beta company while they go in for surgery or to Halsey later in the book. He angry at himself for having to do that , but, like Halsey, want to keep his people alive.</br>  <br> Maria <br>Wasn't she the same size as Master Chief?<br><br>Anyway, the original books made some strong assertions about the Spartan-IIs and then subsequent media has been weakening them little by little.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and it's not particularly interesting lore-wise. <br>40k lore is bigger and richer than both Hola and SW though, even if it's sci-fantasy. Any person who has read even a little bit of proper sci-fi will tell you that Halo's lore is as generic as it can get (and Marathon is still millions of times better), and whoever calls SW EU's lore amazing is seriously insane, like if you know about even a small chunk of the EU you can't possibly praise it, it's a clusterfuck of unprecedented proportions that gets more and more stupid as you read on.<br><br> once-glorious civilization struggling to survive or unfathomable horrors from the depths of space that would fuck up everybody if only they just got their shit together. <br>Shows that you're talking without any knowledge about the setting really. The first of those archetypes pertains only to Eldar, the second one partially pertains to Chaos. All the other races are completely different.<br><br> Everything is really predictable and samey <br>Like what?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair the Spartan-lll's were equipped and built to be suicide troops. They were given less training, shitty armor, and sent in on insane missions that even Spartan-ll's would struggle in. They knew that since they could mass produce them that they could just throw them at the enemies in mass suicide missions and be able to easily replace the casualties.</br>  <br>I remember him signing off on it but if I recall didnt they keep some of the enhancements secret from him? I remember him being really bothered after finding out they gave them berserk enhancements that forced them to survive after taking lethal damage.</br>  <br>Okay how the fuck did I miss that?</br>  <br>The armor isn't exact but whatever</br>  <br>Boobs.</br>  <br>Noice</br>  <br>Wow</br>  <br>This why people don't like you w40k fags. Of course it has bigger lore, they are writing it for like 50 years. You don't have to go into threads and shout that everything ripped off w40k that it is high literature while everything else is shit.</br>  <br><br><br>From my understanding he knew what the enhancements were, there was the whole thing with the splinter-AI warning him before it died, only for him to do nothing since from my understanding the writing implied he knew already since he had ordered those mods added in.<br><br>Him growing unnerved/disturbed after that S-III died IMO was just supposed to be him trying to come to terms to what he'd really done to his recruits by giving them those modifications. Like he was detached from what it would mean for them to be that resistant to injury before killing over like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't start this shit here</br></br>  <br>He was bothered that the thousand kids he trained died. Only Gamma company got the rage augmentations because Kurt was tired of seeing them die. Halsey was the one bothered by I think. I havn't read the book in a while so I might be wrong.</br>  <br>I mean the augmentations, not the spartans themselves. IIIs had worse training and didn't screen for absolutely perfect genes, which is half of what made the IIs so amazing, but the augmentations weren't that much worse.</br>  <br> 40k lore is bigger and richer <br>It's might be bigger (in sheer volume, if you count all that was retconned anyway) but it's definitely not richer. It's all the same boring stuff throughout, and it almost has to be that way to keep the table top game going and making money. The older stuff was a bit more varied and tongue-in-cheek and fun, but modern 40k is universally terrible.<br><br> The first of those archetypes pertains only to Eldar <br>And the Imperium and the Newcrons.<br><br> the second one partially pertains to Chaos <br>And the Necrons (see also first archetype as of the Newcrons), the Tyranids, and the Orkz. They're all a bit different flavor-wise, but they're still horrors from deep space.<br><br>The only one that's a bit different is the Tau.<br><br>And I'm not praising neither SW nor the SW:EU (most of it is garbage with one or two decent things), nor am I really praising Halo lore, but 40k isn't any better than either of those.<br><br>As an avid reader of sci-fi, I dislike all three, but modern 40k is the worst of the lot. Also the fanbase is annoying and tends to think that 40k invented all the cliches (instead of just copying whatever was popular at the time) and is the bestest thing ever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So whose eyes should it be above him?</br></br>  <br> You don't have to go into threads and shout that everything ripped off w40k that it is high literature while everything else is shit. <br>I never said that though. Relax son, no one's trying to bully you.</br></br>  <br><br>Was the case? Its been so long since I read the books so I could have mistaken. I mostly remember the Spartan-lll's being used as shock troopers that got sent in on suicide missions. I think only 2 of the kids Kurt trained survived the first mission and one of them was so traumatized that they just stopped talking completely. Actually, what was so special about Kurt? I remember that every member of Chiefs team had a unique specialty but for the life of me I cant remember what Kurt's was.</br></br>  Man fuck this thread. Fuck it to hell, and fuck you guys especially about reminding me about this shit. Fuck. You.<br><br> It hurts, anons ;_; I miss Halo, I miss its lore, I miss dicking around in the game, but after Reach, I just couldn't go any further. It hurts ;_; I miss it, but I know it's dead </br></br>  <br> I never said that though <br>This whole 40k thing started because every time someone mentions the Zerg a 40kfag is summoned to tell everyone how the Zerg are a rip-off of the Tyranids, even if it's in no way relevant to the discussion at hand.</br></br>  <br>Close anon. Kurt replaced Sam and was recognized as being a people person among the Spartan II's. He was the most sociable. All of Alpha died and 2 survived from Beta's suicide mission because Kurt trained them harder to help them survive. One of them did stop talking but fucking Karen Travis made her talk again because someone was bullying an engineer in front of her.</br>  <br>The two survivors were from the second wave, Beta company. Nobody made it out of Alpha.<br><br>As for Kurt, if memory serves he was notable in that he was the most like a normal person and would socialize the most with regular people. Not much of a distincition at first, but I think they said it showed he though differently than the Spartan-IIs, though like a normal peprson might and thus brought a new perspective to the team by notixing things they wouldn't have. Best example of that is when he noticed something was up during the nuke snatch-and-grab operation where the rebels nearly killed Blue Team when he saw all the ammo was AP, meanwhile the rest of the team hadn't noticed anything at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Also Kurt was supposed to have really good intuition with sensing traps.</br>  <br>Hey at least you didn't touch 4</br>  <br>Kilo 5 better get fucking retconned soon, it was full of awful shit like that</br>  <br> Karen Traviss <br>I thought her Republic Commando shit was okay/enjoyable enough to read for fun but holy shit when I read that change shit with Lucy's voice I wanted to clock her in the jaw.<br><br>The mute one's name was Lucy, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasnt Kurt described as being a good leader like Master Chief? The only difference between them was Chief was naturally lucky and Kurt wasnt. Man, I always loved how every Spartan-ll had a unique thing about them. I love how Chief is actually considered rather average for a Spartan-ll. His only specialty was inspiring troops and his stupidly good luck.</br>  <br> tfw even though the Master Chief Collection exists and I can go play the original trilogy online whenever I want it will never, ever be like it used to be. Especially because of how hard 343 managed to fuck it up. <br> tfw all my old friends, both online and in real life, have moved on from Halo and I will never spend hours in full lobby custom games messing around with them ever again. </br></br>  <br>That's because there aren't many Japanese people who are still alive to understand what war was like.</br>  <br>Hey, at least you and your friends didn't all buy Xbones and MCC specifically to relive the glory days on Halo 3 LAN parties.<br><br>Man, was that a disappointment.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's not the same when you know it gets shitty <br><br> I played a little of it. I know how it turns out <br><br><br>343 fucking piss me the fuck off. Once again proving that you can't hand off an IP to someone who isn't the original creator, and think it'll somehow work. <br><br>RIP Halo. I loved you, and know you loved us, but it's best you just lie there and pretend you don't exist. What adds insult to injury is shit like Microsoft naming their Siri counterpart "Cortana". What the fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How could humans produce something like Spartans, which were much stronger than any soldier the Covenant had, despite being technologically inferior?  <br>Yeah, Kurt was one of the most proficient leaders in the II's even though he made some of them uncomfortable because of the amount of time he would spend making friends outside of missions. I really wish we had seen him pt on the MJOLNIR at the end of Onyx rather than the SPI to truly fuck up those covies before he nuked them. One of my favorite things is how chief considers Linda the best II. At least I think it was Linda.</br>  <br> I wanted to clock her in the jaw. <br><br>Its funny because the mute spartan clocks Halsey in the jaw.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Lucy-B091. She was one of the shortest Spartan III's.</br>  <br>"Jackie's nose sure is big"</br>  <br>The thing about 4 that angered me the most, aside from the general lore raping that comes from forced milking of a franchise that ended perfectly, was the Spartan IVs.<br>What the fuck where they thinking?<br>Spartans are now consenting adults already in the army? What the fuck?<br>Took the entire mysticism out of the Spartans when every jarhead can just sign up for it, might as well not even call them Spartans now that anything that remotely resembles the ancient ones is gone. Not to mention they would still get their asses kicked by a real one easily, yet they still go about like they are the hottest shit.<br>Also the armor designs, Jesus Christ, are they absolute shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The worst part is that he was  killed by a fucking terrorist and not a covenant </br>  <br>Any other Halo references in anime?<br><br><br>That's what happens when you start learning, the war would've been more different if the grunts were tiny spartans instead of just a reskinned contemporary Marine</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck this shit</br>  <br>Good bait. Try to get familiar with Halo lore. Humans are not inferior technologically, and the elite elites are better than Spartan lls.</br>  <br>Don't forget that  Mickey then joins said terrorist. Fuck I hate him so much now. </br>  <br>  but it's definitely not richer. It's all the same boring stuff throughout <br> 4u <br>It is richer in terms of content though, that's a fact and has nothing to do with quality. The same "boring stuff throughout" argument can be made for pretty much every single sci-fi universe that is big enough. Go ahead and name a single one that is immune to this if it isn't the case.<br> And the Imperium  <br>The Imperium is, in the global view of things, a "glorious" civilization currently. It's just facing existential threats despite that. Of course it's a shit civilization compared to the apex of pre-Imperium mankind, but compared to pre-Great Crusade mankind they're really quite glorious.<br> and the Newcrons. <br>While you can say that they're the remnants of an old glorious civilization, they're not struggling to survive and are one of if not the most comfortable race in 40k right now.<br> And the Necrons (see also first archetype as of the Newcrons),  <br>The old Necrons fit the second archetype, the Newcrons don't. Old Necrons are irrelevant unless you count the ones that are still supposed to be there under the C'Tan, but those are far from the threat old Necrons were.<br> the Tyranids,  <br>They're fathomable horrors from outer space that are actually fucking everybody up, their shit is already together as much as it can be.<br> and the Orkz.  <br>Not unfathomable horrors, just green-skinned savages. It's true that they would rek everyone if they were ever united, but that's not their objective in the first place, they're already doing very well in their current state.<br> The only one that's a bit different is the Tau. <br>And that one remaining race that you forgot about.<br><br>There are many legit reasons to dislike 40k, but being ignorant of the setting and trying to twist things to fit your narrow and outright false views isn't one of them.<br><br><br>Who cares? It has nothing to do with the issue here.<br><br><br>And this is different from other Western nations how?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love just how much detail is put into the halo books and lore man. Seriously the scene were they sent all of Alpha and Beta on the suicide mission was so graphic and detailed. I loved how they described just how ineffective the SPI armor was at defending against covenant weapons when they describe how a single grazed shot from a plasma pistol melted all the way through the guys armor and his chest like it wasnt even there.</br>  <br>I'm not familiar with Halo lore, that's why I'm asking. I spent like 30 minutes reading the Halo Nation wiki because of this thread and I couldn't find the answer. The wiki stated humans were technologically inferior and I just assumed Spartans were the best because the Covenant apparently feared them and called them Demons and Master Chief smashed everything like it was nothing.</br>  The only one i didnt like was the one with the Arbiter and ps1 cutscene graphics  <br>Linda is a hard ass so it would make sense. She had ungodly accuracy. I dont remember exactly how they described her accuracy but I remember a scene in Onyx when she took out several sentinals with one ricochet shot from her sniper. She also shouldnt even be alive considering she got lit up by multiple plasma rifles and pistols while her shields were down.</br>  <br>It's modern military, UNSC embrace shameless 80s aesthetic, except with FTL that is.<br><br>Of course they changed quite far in few decades but hey.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the package was the worst</br>  <br>My favorite scene with Linda is from First Strike when she's sniping elites out of there Banshees while hanging upside down.</br>  <br>What's weird is that I pictured her the same way even though she was never described as such.</br>  <br>The package was entertaining when they started the run towards the command room<br><br>Arbiter one was just eyecancer</br></br></br>  <br>The covenant pretty much just copies Forerunner tech, and barely makes any of their own. Since it's against their religion to tamper with it, they don't even bother improving it much. So when humans finally get hold of forerunner tech, they make shit like the Infinity which solos entire covenant fleets. Spartan armor isn't forerunner, but it does incorporate some of the covenant shield tech derived from forerunner shields and improves upon them a little. Spartans still drop like flies vs the covenant though, it's just the chief and a few others that are lucky enough to survive.</br>  <br>at least the scene when he fights the army and the hunter was cool</br>  <br>The Spartan-ll's were made to battle the rebels originally. It just so happened that while they were being made the covenant showed up. The UNSC and the Covenant are sort of both equal to each other in terms of weaponry. Due to how the Covenant shields and ships were designed with defending against energy weapons the UNSC's kinetic based guns and tech have an edge against them if I recall. The MAC guns are extremely effective against the Covenant ships. Though the plasma weaponry is also extremely effective against the UNSC ships and soldiers due to them designing around dealing with kinetic weapons so the armor doesnt do much to stop the plasma.</br>  <br>The UNSC are extremely outmatched compared to Covenant technology. While the MAC guns are effective the UNSC still lose like 3 to 1 in every ship to ship fight. The place they excel compared to the covenant was on ground.</br>  <br> It is richer in terms of content though <br>It's bigger in terms of content, but it's not richer because it lacks variety. It's also not richer a lot of the stuff that actually made it richer in the past has been retconned out.<br><br> Go ahead and name a single one that is immune to this if it isn't the case <br>Pretty much any universe that's not constrained to games and has a single author (Asimovs Robot and Foundation universe, for instance)<br><br>I'm not going to go through each of your arguments for the races because you're focusing on specific flavors, while ignoring that the two archetypes of "race that was better in the past" and "horror from deep space" are still predominant. They're all vehicles for justifying the color of little plastic army men, and that makes them pretty limited in what freedoms the writers had, because they have to balance lore with gameplay to a large extent.<br><br> And that one remaining race that you forgot about. <br>What would that be? The Squats?<br><br>I'm not as ignorant of the setting as you'd like to believe. I may not be as educated as a dedicated fan and because I don't play the game, but that means I'm not blinded to its flaws either. I considered playing (and immersing myself into the lore of) 40k in the past mainly because of evangelizing 40k playing friends of mine who kept telling me that it's the best thing since sliced bread, so I studied up on it and decided that it was not for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks, sounds like it makes sense.</br></br>  <br>The Spartan-ll's were never really designed to be used as front line troops if I recall. Their specialty was hit and run guerrilla warfare tactics. They would send it a team and run assassination missions and other missions like that. The reason Reach was such a complete slaughter was because in a front line battle the Spartan-ll's arent that effective. They are only around as strong as the Elites. I think they only advantage they really have over them is their super enhanced reflexes.</br>  <br><br>Covies got most of their tech from copying forerunner relics, and weren't very good at inventing new stuff or even optimizing what they had. Cortana was able to vastly improve their plasma weapons and do crazy shit with their slipspace drives just by tweaking the settings. Plus their culture didn't really need a supersoldier program. Elites were fine with their natural strength and wouldn't want the other races having something like that.<br><br>Or you could go with the 343 explanation: Augmenting people and sticking them in powered suits is actually a genetic imperative implanted by a forerunner when humans were still cavemen.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What they said. Read the First Strike and the short story compilation. Covenant doesn't know how to use forerunner tech, ut is revealed when Cortana gets into a flagship and realizes that the covies use about 1% of its potential. Also there's a story where a group of spartans are slaughtered by some elite specops that watched them to gather info. Elites and brutes are still stronger than spartans.</br></br>  <br> Spartan armor isn't forerunner <br>HAHA, TIME FOR 343<br> The designs for spartan armor were implanted in humanity's genes by the librarian so that when the MC, the chosen one that was also implanted into humanity's genes and is immune to some forerunner weapons because of his special implanted genes, was born he could wear it. Also MC's luck was the forerunners too </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that could be right. I remember the battle with Keys where they described how brutally effective the plasma was against their ships. I believe it was described as once a UNSC ship was hit it was almost always a fatal hit since it literally would just melt through the entire ship.</br>  <br>At the outbreak of the war, Covie tech was leagues ahead of Human tech due to Covies basically just ripping and re-using Forerunner tech.<br><br>The Prophets deemed tinkering too much with Forerunner stuff to be heresy, so they never expanded upon what they unearthed and simply sought to maintain their equipment with the help of the Huragok, artificial lifeforms that basically served as janitors, engineers, and servants of the Forerunners.<br><br>Humanity could barely dent the Covenant, and a 3:1 ratio of Human ships to Covenant ships was considered an equal fight. On the ground things were a bit better, as regular Marines could hold their own against Grunts and Jackals, but Elites would still fuck everyone up.<br><br>The Spartan II program was initially created to deal with the Rebel Insurrection, but was hastily repurposed with borrowed and improved upon Covenant tech so that Spartans could regularly and reliably win in ground ops.<br><br>Despite this, Humanity consistently lost space battles, and only the actions of badasses and things like the Cole Protocol, as well as the sheer number of Human colonies, kept them alive long enough to survive the war.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes they are technologically inferior.<br>But this is still 2500s.<br>They have both the resources and the tech to grab a human child, train them, strengthen them beyond human limit while also making an armor that not only plays to their new found strength but further increases it while jacking up their survivability with energy shields reverse engineered from the covenant.<br>In the end it just serves to actually make a human be able to go toe to toe with the elites which are naturally at that level.<br>Not all Spartans are at the level of the Chief though.<br>The only reason the Covenant lost the war, aside from Humanity plot armor, was because they had some really backwards logic, honor and religious in fighting.<br>Don't tamper with existing tech for one, making them unable to better themselves against the human condition of always seeking more.<br>Then there was also the way things were done in their ranks and retarded honor bound shit like Elites that would rather die during battle than actually pick up a human weapon when they were out of ammo, and denouncing any that actually did it.<br>I just wish 343 actually explored the lore by making spin offs rather than raping it by making a new trilogy to continue the one that ended perfectly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This will never not make me mad.<br>Who the fuck though it would be a good idea to make Captain King the Chosen One? Not only does it make Halo 4 look like a joke of a game, it retroactively cheapens the plots of EVERY OTHER HALO GAME.<br>Fuck it, I'm frogposting, I'm still fucking mad</br></br></br>  <br>If I remember correctly, the new lore additions started during the forerunner trilogy novels.<br>I had previously read some of Greg Bear's stuff (Darwin's Radio and Blood Music) and really liked it, so when I heard that he was going to do Halo stuff, I got pretty excited. Ultimately I was pretty satisfied with what I got.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that was during the Keye's Loop section which was badass as hell.<br><br><br><br> the geass and Black team getting slaughtered <br>343!!!!!! I will find a way to have my revenge.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Spartan-ll's had an advantage against the Elites in speed and reflexes still I believe due to their AI implants. However strength wise they were just barely equal to the Elites and pathetically outmatched by the Brutes. Plus the Brutes were insanely hard to kill due to their berserk mode that meant you literally had to kill them multiple times. I remember it taking Fred, Linda, and Kelly together to take down one Brute and Fred had to put an entire clip of his rifle into its head before it actually died.</br>  <br>Spartans II's were specialized in small-unit tactics simply because they were small in number. The average Spartan II was quite a bit more effective than the average Elite (there were, at max, 30-ish active Spartan IIs during the Human-Covenant War).<br><br>The reason the Spartans lost at reach was because they got absolutely overwhelmed (we're talking tens of thousands of Covenant here), and because Covenant Capital ships started to bombard them.</br></br></br>  <br>Halo books and Halo games are pretty different in terms of Spartan strength.<br><br>In the books, Covenant weapons go through Spartans like a plasma knife through butter.<br><br><br><br><br> 3:1 ratio of Human ships to Covenant <br><br>It was also stated that Elite shipmasters were very, very good at space combat (and combat in general, I guess), and even if humanity and covie tech was on par, they still wouldn't have a clear win.<br><br>It is a common theme throughout some books and some games (2 and 3) that if the Covie civil war hadn't happened and the prophets hadn't replaced Elites with Brutes, humanity would be screwed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget that actually fully equipping a spartan was expensive as all hell.<br>It actually cost as much as a small starship.</br></br>  <br>The Headhunter team was a two-man Spartan III element.<br><br>They were deep behind enemy lines with another Headhunter team, and got ambushed by basically the very very best Spec Ops elites with enhanced active camo and overpowered Red Energy Swords.<br><br>Despite that, they managed a stalemate (everyone died).<br><br>III's are quite a bit inferior to II's.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's stated somewhere that Humanity only had a few months left at most before the schism happened after the Battle of Earth</br>  <br>Actually the Chief was one of the most average Spartan-ll's as far as combat stats. What made him special was his silly ass luck. A better comparison would be not all Spartans are like Sam who without even having the Mark 1 stood at around 9 feet tall and was able to hold out against an entire Covenant ship filled with Elites while the rest of Blue Team escaped and the bomb detonated.</br>  <br> chosen one in 4 <br> humans were the bad guys all along xD in 5 <br>God I hate 343</br></br></br>  <br>Chief was also stated to be a natural leader by Halsey, and by Cortana at the start of Halo 3.</br>  <br> Spartans II's were specialized in small-unit tactics simply because they were small in number <br>Spartans II's were designed and trained before the Covenant were known to humanity and participated in "anti-terrorism" missions.<br><br> The average Spartan II was quite a bit more effective than the average Elite <br>That's probably true, but when you consider that the average Elite was a run-of-the-mill soldier (Blue, in terms of gameplay) while the average Spartan II was the best of the best. When you start looking at more experienced Elites like the Arbiter, the spec-ops or any of the higher ranked ones (Elites promoted based on combat prowess and number of kills), then the Spartans were pretty much out-matched in a straight up fight. The only way they could win against those foes was through ambush and guerrilla tactics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I stopped caring for this series after 4 was announced.<br>Wasn't Captain King designated as "Hyper Lethal"? He also took out a group of highly trained ODSTs when he was still a kid.<br>I figured that luck was just the tip of the already deadly spear.</br></br></br>  <br> old ass ship could still fight with 70% of its decks pierced by plasma shots <br> UNSC used newer ships that got wrecked from a single hit <br>Why were they so damedame?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, for every one spartan-ll that died another 100 Elites took their place. Reach was just a complete slaughter. The MAC guns took out countless Covenant ships but they literally just keep pouring in by the thousands. The Fall of Reach was a unwinnable battle. Especially once they started glassing the planet. Once the Orbital Super MAC guns fell it was over.</br>  <br> 9 feet tall <br>I think you mean 8</br></br>  <br>At least they learned. After the war ended the UNSC commissioned a new Heavy Cruiser class called Autumn classes based off of the Halcyon design and The Pillar of Autumns upgrades.</br>  <br> humans were the bad guys all along xD in 5 <br>Why can't we have a full game through the side of the covenant?<br>Most of the best parts in two was playing "Arbiter special forces"<br>Then again with 343 at the helm they would fuck it up somehow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Any Spartan-ll could do that. It was actually only one too. He was in the training area and he was commenting on how the weights felt like they weighed nothing. After seeing a pin fall to the ground he described it was if it was falling in zero gravity due to his senses being so heightened. He ended up sparing a veteran ODST and commented on how he seemed to move in slow motion. When he went to hit him he kicked him in the side and completely shattered his entire pelvis and killed him instantly. Spartan-ll's were miles ahead of humans in every way imaginable even without the armor.</br>  <br> Pretty much any universe that's not constrained to games and has a single author (Asimovs Robot and Foundation universe, for instance) <br>True, I should have said sci-fi universes in stories that are mainly concerned with or heavily involved with warfare.<br> ignoring that the two archetypes of "race that was better in the past" and "horror from deep space" are still predominant. <br>Notice that you're moving the goalposts. The archetypes were more complex than that just a post ago, and now they're suddenly broader and all-inclusive.<br>If we go further down this road, we can say that in sci-fi involving space civilizations (or just aliens really) we can find only 4 archetypes at most: young new races, races that were better in the past, horrors from deep space and races that became better than the past. Even for a "hard sci-fi" book like Blindsight this is true. If we go even further, you can break everything down in terms of tropes and archetypes, we don't need to say anything more on this as there's an entire well-known website devoted to doing this. The flavors are what makes things varied and fresh in EVERYTHING, from the buildup of individual characters to the background of the universe to the actual stories. So you can't say "this doesn't count because it's just flavors on top of archetypes" because fiction works that way, everything is and will always be based on archetypes and tropes.<br> What would that be? The Squats? <br>No, the Hellraisers in space.<br><br> so I studied up on it and decided that it was not for me. <br>That's your choice and is of course a perfectly valid one, I shouldn't even be saying this. But nevertheless, criticism has to be made correctly and accurately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hyper Lethal <br>That's just Bungie speak for "player character." <br><br>That and Master Chiefs "luck" and some other things I can't remember right now seem to be allusions to the fact that they are the main player character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah wasnt Sam described as being a head taller then Chief? So 8 feet should be the right height. Man imagine if Sam had lived long enough to get his armor. Jesus he would have been a monster.</br>  <br>And even then they were nothing compared to the Elites without their armor and AI implants. It really shows just how outclassed Humans really were in comparison to the Covenants. One Elite would kill somewhere around 5 to 10 Marines I believe for every one Elite killed I think was the statistic?</br>  <br> Spartans II's were designed and trained before the Covenant were known to humanity and participated in "anti-terrorism" missions. <br><br>So? If they created more of them, they would've, but they were hamstrung by the ridiculous cost and restrictive gene pool. Mjolnir armor was not developed in response to the Covenant, it was already underway by the time the Human-Covenant war started.<br><br>They were trained to operate in any environment and by any means, from hit-and-run, to vehicular combat, to front-line combat. They were even cross-trained to operate bridge stations on Human Ships.<br><br> That's probably true, but when you consider that the average Elite was a run-of-the-mill soldier (Blue, in terms of gameplay) while the average Spartan II was the best of the best. When you start looking at more experienced Elites like the Arbiter, the spec-ops or any of the higher ranked ones (Elites promoted based on combat prowess and number of kills), then the Spartans were pretty much out-matched in a straight up fight. The only way they could win against those foes was through ambush and guerrilla tactics. <br><br>When I said quite a bit, I meant quite a bit. By the time of the events of the first Halo game, Spartan II's were active for nearly 30 years against the Covenant (1st contact at Harvest was 2525, Reach feel in 2552). <br><br>30 years of continuous combat against the Covenant,and they still managed to pull 30 Spartans out of the original 33 or so to Reach.<br><br>You are vastly underestimating how effective they were. They always won on the ground, but their fights usually didn't matter because the Covenant would fuck the USNC up in space and then glass the planet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats one of the main reasons they started the Spartan-lll program so that they could send in waves upon waves of suicide shock troopers while the remaining Spartan-ll's continued their spec ops missions.</br>  <br>He did get the armor, only it was the first iteration and not designed to deal with covenant small arms . if he had made it to the shielded MarkV he would have been the greatest.</br>  <br>The Pillar of Autumn was originally considered a failure by the UNSC because it had a ridiculously overcomplicated and over-redundant damage control and hull reinforcement system. It was simply to costly to make an effective class of ship, so the Halcyon class of cruisers was mothballed.<br><br>Cortana picked it and ONI loaded it up with a crazy amount of fancy gizmos and gadgets to make it probably the single most capable ship in the entire Navy at the time.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw you realize that the MC's "luck" and "precognitive sense" was just the respawning mechanic all along. </br>  <br>Honestly, if you go by book descriptions, Fred was the greatest Spartan.<br><br>He took 2nd place in everything all the time, and John theorizes it's because he never wanted to be first.<br><br>That means he's at least the 2nd fastest, the 2nd best shot, the 2nd strongest, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based on the opening to Halo:CE it has the best KD of any NSC ship. It kills 4 battle cruisers in the opening cutscene.</br>  <br><br><br>Spartans are sterile and have zero sex drive. They're taken before puberty, and their endocrine system is fucked with such that instead of producing reproductive hormones, it only produces strength and muscle building hormones. One female spartan attempted to have sex out of curiosity, but got bored and walked out in the middle of the act. <br><br>All of this technically means that Spartans are effectively eunuchs. Male spartans should have high pitched voices, and females should have narrow hips and no bust at all. They would be extremely androgynous even without the armor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They started out with around 150 Spartan-ll's and ended up at around 30ish I believe. They were extremely effective yeah, the problem was that there was countless Covenant forces and no matter how many successful ops they ran it almost never mattered due to the Covenant just wiping the UNSC out in space combat and glassing the planet anyways. However they still struggled to best the Elites in CQC and were only barely stronger them. They were damn good at their job but still outmatched a good bit.</br>  <br>They only had 75 Spartans before the augmentations and only 33 survived them and retained combat capability.</br>  <br>They also all looked really messed up. Spartan-ll's were described as looking really augmented and almost unhuman on top of being unnaturally pale and having messed up facial features. Master Chief is noted as having a messed up face due to the multiple times his nose has been broken if I recall.</br>  <br> You are vastly underestimating how effective they were <br>No, you're vastly overestimating how effective they could be in front-line combat. Spartan-IIs were only effective when they were deployed correctly and the circumstances were best suited to play to the Spartan's strengths as special forces trained for infiltration and destruction of key targets. Since there were so few of them (and to make it more interesting) they were deployed very carefully by the UNSC command and thus the conditions were always in their favor (which was a pretty smart move by UNSC commanders).<br><br>In a straight up front-line fight, the Spartans couldn't hold out because the enemy weapons went straight through them (even the shielded armor wasn't all that great at stopping covenant fire) and higher ranked Elites were straight up stronger than any of them, this was repeatedly shown in the books, every time a Spartan engaged an Elite up close they end up seriously wounded and survive either through luck or superior experience.<br><br>A Spartan placed on the front lines of a battle would be no more effective than 10 regular marines and would get creamed pretty quickly regardless of skill because of all the heavy ordnance flying out there, thus USNC made sure not to place them anywhere near such situations and made sure they were able to play to their strengths.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fred as also an extremely good leader. He was only second best to John as far as leadership went . He was also extremely gifted at Close Quarters Combat and I believe he was being noted as being able to take on Elites in CQC which is something not many Spartans were able to do.</br>  <br>That's not quite right. She didn't implant the exact designs (it would've been ridiculously overpowered if she did) or a specific chosen one, she just rigged it so humans would eventually mimic the forerunners by augmenting themselves and living in fancy armor. MC was immune because Librarian fiddled with his genes again so the composer wouldn't ping him as human, just like it couldn't work on Didact after his attempted flood vaccines. The spartan program as a whole is "the chosen one", not MC specifically.<br><br>Still retarded, but a different kind of retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they did not struggle to beat Elites in CQC.<br><br>Heck, even Spartan III's could fuck elites up in CQC no problem.<br><br>Spartan II's would chew through Minors and Majors, and presumably had a good record against even higher level elites because, as I said, after 30 years of continuous ground operations against the Covenant, they lost around 3 Spartan IIs.<br><br>It was made a point several times that Spartan II's rarely, if ever lost on the ground. If that somehow translates to "they struggled to best the Elites in CQC", we're speaking two totally different languages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Their shields could only stop a single Plasma Pistol round I believe before being knocked out. Most plasma rounds went straight through them if their shields werent up. The video games make you believe Spartan-ll's are tanks that can absorb tons of plasma shots and damage but in the lore they are lucky to survive a few. I believe one Spartan-ll lost his entire arm in a fight against a Hunter from just being grazed by one of its fusion rounds.</br>  <br> are sterile <br>Didn't they test it by Impregnating female Spartan?<br>IIRC It turned out that they couldn't naturally birth the child because their bone strengthening augmentations made them rigid and unable to widen to allow the baby passage.</br></br></br>  <br>while that was before they got their shielded armors, you are correct that they would still get melted pretty badly without them up</br>  <br>The discussion isn't about how effective they would be against the combined might of the Covenant, it's about how effective they would be against Elites, even higher ranked, more veteran Elites.<br><br>Yeah Spartans would probably (and did) get buttfucked by masses of enemy troops supported by vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft, but the fact of the matter is Spartan IIs consistently win against Elites.<br><br>There are very few examples of Spartan IIs getting dominated by Elites, especially by only Elites. There are even fewer examples of Spartan IIs losing to only Elites.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i think chief was the one who is unnaturally pale since he does not always takes out his armor, i dont know about the nose though</br>  <br>Thats because they used stealth tactics and guerrilla warfare strategies to take them on. The Spartan-lll's only took on the Elites in CQC because there was hundreds of them and they were designed to keep fighting even after receiving fatal damage. The higher up Elites were masters of CQC. They were stronger and better trained then the Spartans were in it. Also a good few Spartan-ll's got killed throughout the war. The main advantage the Spartan-ll's had was their AI implants boosted their already insane reflexes to even higher levels and gave them really insane combat readings and allowed them to outsmart the enemy.</br>  <br> One female spartan attempted to have sex out of curiosity, but got bored and walked out in the middle of the act.  <br><br>Which book(?) was that in?</br></br></br>  <br>If anything the Spartan-ll's struggled the most at taking on the Brutes. Brutes were noted as being insanely hard to actually kill and they were way stronger then the Spartan-ll's were. It took 3 members of Blue Team to take out a single Brute and that was after Fred shot the damn thing in the head multiple times.</br>  <br> Even Spartan III's could fuck elites up in CQC no problem <br> no problem <br>Every time a Spartan (II or III) was forced to fight a high-ranked Elite in CQC (instead of stealthily assassinating it) in the books it was treated like a super big deal and survival was treated as a matter of luck or friends coming to the rescue.<br><br>Spartans beat Elites mostly in ranged engagements from superior positions and the instances where they actually had to fight up close were few and far between (the video games aside) and Spartans spent a lot of their time in the books running away from unfavorable positions to a better position.<br><br> the fact of the matter is Spartan IIs consistently win against Elites. <br>No, Spartan IIs consistently win against Covenant battle groups containing Elite leaders. The instances where a Spartan engaged in actual close combat against a high-ranked Elite were few and far between and never favorable for the Spartan and always ended mostly due to plot armor (luck, friends coming to the rescue, convenient weapons lying around) and they always came out of it heavily wounded.<br><br>Fact of the matter is, fighting Elites was always treated like a big fucking deal in the books, and it was implied many times that without proper preparation and an advantageous position, it was a losing proposition.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was in Fall of Reach I think. They were talking about how most Spartan-ll's avoided social interactions with people and kept to themselves I think. I could be wrong though.</br>  <br> That was in Fall of Reach I think <br>i dont think so, but your right about the social interactions</br></br>  <br>Spartan-ll's had the advantage against the Elites in ranged combat due human weapons being extremely effective at dealing with the covenant since their shields are terrible at defending against them. However in actual upclose combat they almost never came out of it unscathed. Normally only barely surviving or being extremely lucky. Higher tier Elites were monsters in close combat and easily out classed the Spartans in almost every regard aside from reflexes I believe.</br>  <br>Spartans were terrible at Social interaction since almost all of them were almost completely insane. The augmentations and chemicals messed with their mental health quite a bit if I recall. They also were all really young children that kidnapped from their families and thrown into extremely harsh training and brutal experimentation.</br>  <br> Spartans were terrible at Social interaction since almost all of them were almost completely insane <br>I hate that all those facts about Spartans being instane, ugly, impotent machines of war is slowly getting retconned out in favor of more audience-friendly Spartans that are attractive badasses in power armor.</br></br>  <br>Their training also taught them to not trust anyone else, not even Halsey. It's no surprise they were antisocial.</br>  <br><br>It's clear you two aren't going to be convinced by any evidence or reasoning, despite numerous examples and your own words contradicting your position.<br><br>I can think of, and quote, numerous instances where Spartans engaged in front-line combat, as well as single combat against Elites and won, a handful where they won with assistance, and a very very few where they outright lost.<br><br><br>You're not remembering that incident correctly. I suggest you go back and re-read Ghosts of Onyx.<br><br>That being said, they did struggle the most against Brutes, but they were fairly confident they could handle them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If I recall wasnt it stated that the Spartan-1's were actually stronger and better then the Spartan-ll's? Wasnt it due to having a insanely low survival and success rate and being far more expensive that they dropped it?  <br>but chief and blue team were actually close</br>  <br>I remember MC getting wrecked by one so badly his armor's shield generator broke (or maybe he got wrecked that hard because it was already broken, I forgot) in First Strike. He only survived because he managed to shove it into an escape pod.</br>  Why haven't they shut down 343 yet? We keep on seeing them fuck everything up, story and gameplay-wise.  <br>It is very possible that im not remembering that instance correctly. As its been quite awhile since I last read Ghosts of Onyx. I just remember them struggling quite a bit with taking out the Brute.</br>  <br>Thats because they went through Boot Camp together and immediately clicked. They were together through the entire process. So the trust was already built up.</br>  <br> It's clear you two aren't going to be convinced by any evidence <br>If you could present some, that would be cool.<br><br>Recall that one time in First Strike where Master Chief had to fight in a Covie ship on the bridge, and how that Elite almost ended him and left him with a pretty gruesome wound and broken armor (fixed later by an engineer, IIRC). Almost every up close interaction between Elites and Spartans in the books is either a desperate fight for survival in close quarters or a successful ambush/firefight from superior position.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, the gist of the incident was that Fred's motion tracker was messed up and he discovered that the Brutes were about to leave with the warheads, so he rushed the cart, killing two of the three Brutes in there.<br><br>The 2nd one collapsed on him due to the close quarters of the elevator cart, and the third was about to pop his head with a grenade when Linda sniped it.<br><br>That being said the 3-man Blue Team in that incident killed roughly 12 Brutes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember much but the whole genetic selection and the power armor thing was started with the lls. It was said that they needed the adamantium skeltons because the LCD armor broke the bones of a normal human.</br>  <br>http://minionsmakememes.tumblr.com/<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>ORION was dropped because the augmentations weren't as effective as they hoped (this is the big reason II used kids, it just didn't work as well on adults) and a lot of them developed mental/physical issues over the years. Johnson was one of them.<br><br>The II program is the one that got dropped because of low success rates and huge cost.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, the first and most obvious one would be the whole Package sequence from legends.<br><br>Fred apparently solos two elites using only knives.<br><br>Chief gets saved by random bullshit, but if you want to count this one as a "loss", you need to count all the Chief's stories as "wins".<br><br>They kill god knows how many elites on the way in and out.<br><br>Next is from Dirt, where Gage is saved on the Inner Colony of Skopje by an unnamed Spartan II that, and I quote:<br><br> shrugged off Grunts like they were annoying mosquitoes, tackled Brutes face on, and was an equal match for any Elite <br><br>During First Strike, there were two incidents where cloaked Elites were attempting to ambush Spartan II teams, once in CASTLE while the Spartans were attempting to escape with Halsey, and later on Ascendant Justice when the Spartans were attempting to repair the busted engine plasma conduit.<br><br>Also during First Strike, when they were fighting from their dropship to the bridge of Ascendant Justice, they ran into a 5-man Elite fire team where John and some Marines absolutely dumped on the elites. This was shortly before the bridge incident you mention.<br><br>I'd think of more but this is getting pretty long-winded already.<br><br>The tl;dr of it is that you have to understand, of the Spartan IIs that are confirmed dead, few, if any, are killed by Elites regardless of circumstance. 1v1s, ambushes, giant battles, whatever, Elites rarely killed Spartan II's.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quantum immortality</br>  <br>Shit I'm so tired I forgot to mention Naomi doing her shit in the more recent books, basically consistently fucking up Elites in all sorts of situations.<br><br>Now, find me an example where an Elite overpowers and kills a Spartan II.</br></br></br>  <br>Spartan-ll's needed metal enforced bones and hyper strengthened muscles because the Armor would have turned their bones and insides to dust otherwise. They tried testing the Mjolnir armor on a human soldier the moment he twitched it broke every bone in his body.</br>  <br>You have to realize the elites are different too. They don't wear white or golden armor for fashion reasons. Of course the spartans could drop the average ones easily but specops were highly trained in CQC apart from being naturally stronger.</br>  <br>Its also stated literally in the prologue of Fall of Reach that Spartans never lost on the ground but couldnt take the fight to space where the UNSC always got wrecked terribly. So the minor ground victories meant nothing once the Covenant started glassing the planet.</br>  <br>see <br><br> Now, find me an example where an Elite overpowers and kills a Spartan II. <br><br>Might be hard seeing as the number of Spartans lost prior to Reach is in the single digits, and the reasons for quite a few of them are known (spoiler: they didn't die to Elites).<br><br>You can theorycraft as much as you want, I'm just going to keep on responding with facts.<br><br><br>Yes, I know. I mentioned this here </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Spartans are now consenting adults already in the army? What the fuck? <br>Isn't that how the Spartan I were?</br></br>  <br>yeah but it was a failed project that didnt give the results they were hoping for. It was far too expensive for what the results yielded.</br>  <br>Tsutomu Nihei is a Halo Fanboy, he even made a short comic with Sgt Johnson that was published in some Halo anthology.</br>  <br>actually many nips were mad when they replaced chief's voice in halo 4</br>  <br>I think it was very uncreatively titled Halo Graphic Novel.<br><br>I can't find my copy, but it was pretty solid; Nihei's part didn't have any dialogue but it looked great.</br></br></br>  <br>yep it was about the flood</br>  <br> Nihei's part didn't have any dialogue <br><br>Classic Nihei.</br></br></br>   why mods delete those Zelda thread while this HALO thread isn't?   <br>Yes, which is part of the reason it failed. And people only started calling them spartans retroactively. Spartan II was the first spartan program, Halsey just called it II out of respect.<br><br>IVs would be slightly less annoying if they were called ORION II instead.

The two nights HQ was almost destroyed by Komui-inventions were the best.  <br>With quarterly schedule, properly never again<br>But there is instagram</br></br>  <br>Yea, she will probably be in a rush to finish the manga properly and no time for hijinks. <br><br>Still 4 chapters a year is better than no chapters a year I guess</br></br></br>  <br>It's been a while since I read it, but that hitler guy isn't exactly evil right?</br>  <br>I don't mean that but I doubt anyone would want an comedic relief filler arc that lasts entire year<br><br>Tankoubon omake is nice however</br></br></br>  <br> She'll be in a rush to finish the manga <br>The male cast having sexual tension takes priority, then after that it may accidentally end.</br></br>  <br>We have been through this before, D.grayman is a cleverly disguised reverse harem with Lenalee as her self-insert.</br>  <br>Yes. He only acts as if he is evil.<br>I mean, come on. He bakes cakes and cookies. What could possibly go wrong</br></br>  <br>Except Lenalee friendzoned and familyzoned every one.</br>  <br>Overcook his macaroons and they turn up too hard instead of cheewy.</br>  Miranda a best, by far.  <br> Saying that the High and Mighty Inspector of Central Agency Malcom C.Lvellie would overcook his macaroons </br>  <br>Link, please go</br>  <br> Miranda is Hoshino self-insert <br><br>She won't die, right?  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure it's Lenalee.<br><br>Anyway I'm glad D.grayman started many years ago. /a/ would have called it edgyshit if it began serializing now.</br></br></br>  <br>source me faggot</br>  <br> Pretty sure it's Lenalee. <br>He right, Miranda is Hoshino self insert, she explicitly says that she made Miranda's initially goofy and hopeless character after herself and  hoped she would find happiness with Allen and the others .<br>It's all in the extra pages at the end of the chapters in the volumes, I don't know if niggerstream have it since I bought the manga back in the day.</br></br></br>    <br><br>This explains why she was so great. Hoshino is cute as hell already</br></br>  <br>But it's edgy<br><br> Shitting on nakama power <br> Nea related <br> Road </br></br></br></br></br>  Damn it Hoshino  <br><br> resemble me <br> hurr author's self-insert </br></br></br>  <br>define self-insert</br>  Does Allen's Cursed Eye still allow other people in the vicinity to also see Akuma souls? I'm surprised other characters who team up with Allen (especially for the first time) don't react.  <br>i'm going to say Hosino forgot about that point or two, the other exorcists just don't care. Lavi made a point about it but it was never mentioned again. (by other characters)</br>  Time for the end of arc party and heavy exposition chapters.  <br>Think about it. Violet never really befriended anyone in the crew, he saw Baby 5 as a sister and Jora is too old. <br><br>Her being Doffy,s lover is not far fetched at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Out of all those gladiators who are supposedly big names in the new world only the Rebecca had it? Super fucking common right?</br>  <br>Whitebeard is dead though.</br>  <br> Her love Doffy </br>     You live your entire life as a criminal in a desert.  <br> The only companionship you have a talking cat.  <br> One day, desperate for something of worth in your dirt-ridden existence, you try to rob a teenage girl, a pig, and a small boy.  <br> The small boy kicks your teeth out after seeing a girl makes you bashful and embarrassed, and peeping a titty makes you pass out. <br> When confronted with the possibility of having any wish granted by a magical dragon, your wish would be "I don't want to drop spaghetti while looking at a lady" <br> You then spend days creeping on these folks, watching for a way to achieve this lofty goal, you are forced to hit a little girl (one of your few [only?] victories) and then hit on her. <br> Eventually you are captured and saved only when the little kid turns into a giant monkey. &gt;The pig does more than you to save the day. <br> But it's okay, right? You finally got a girlfriend. &gt;Well, kind of. You don't really see each other that often. <br> You decide to show the world your stuff and enter into the Tenkaichi Budokai, the greatest martial arts tournament of all time.  <br> You are immediately eliminated in the quarter finals by an old man nobody's heard of before. &gt;You embarrass and humiliate yourself by insisting that it's a different old man in disguise before being proven a fool. <br> The next time you hear from Goku, he's taking on terrorist Nazis or some crazy shit.  <br> So you gear up to raid the Hydra base and... you're not needed at all.  <br> You get a sinking feeling in your heart, like this won't be getting old soon. <br> You help Goku fight the fortune teller's fighters.  <br> An invisible man beats you up and you barely win when your girlfriend's boobs are gawked at by an old man. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127703594#p127703594">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/<wbr>zesceyrNPds" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</wbr>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kHP<wbr>VDXwMxiA</wbr>  [ ]</br>    <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br> yes </br>  Is her voice this bad in the manga?
