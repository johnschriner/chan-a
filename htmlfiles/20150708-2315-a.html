That is, if we're ever going to see it animated. How big is the chance that the entire manga will be animated, anyway?</br>  <br>What did Keith do?</br>  <br>  You are now reading a spoiler. Hello.  </br>  <br>10/10. If not, fujos will riot.</br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>Annie a reason to live<br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek why did you photoshop her nose</br>  <br>MT and BR were back for two whole pages, but now we're back to the usual.</br>  <br>Why would I ever do something like that? That's the original picture. The artist chose to have her nose emphasized by its shadow instead of a curved line. I think it looks quite nice.</br>  <br>I just want more MT.I don't care about boring BR.</br>  <br>Same, but over all I'm glad that Ymir wasn't with them, I hate her the most out of BRY.</br>  I dont get why authors do this. The problem isnt that its a flashback. Nor that its the flashback of a side character. Its that nothing of actual value was revealed. You can make a chapter like this worthwhile by simply laying a few breadcrumbs. Or at least some implications about future events. But I guess Isayama is planning that far ahead. At least give people something<br><br> when I found Grisha he mumbled something about a mission, but he didnt know what it was <br>There you fucking go. Chapter now has an actual purpose and drives the plot forward. Also leaves people with something to talk about. Is it that hard?</br></br></br>  <br>I guess Keith could've just told how Grisha found Eren, brought Eren to the forest, and then disappear. The stuff about Grisha was from outside the walls stuff and him marrying Carla could've been answered with whatever was in the basement or a flashback.<br><br>But I guess Isayama needed to remind everyone about how life sucks and doesn't always go as planned no matter how hard you try with Keith because that's one of the themes of the entire series.</br></br></br>  <br> Also Lost girls gets Manga adaptation. <br>If they picked an Ereri doujinka to do ACWNR I hope they choose Pandaniku to do this one.</br></br>  <br> Its that nothing of actual value was revealed <br>Yeah it's not like we learned that Grisha was from outside and probably related to MT. The whole chapter was to make the story more coherent and give more information about events and characters. Not advancing the plot doesn't make it a bad chapter.</br></br>  <br>Does it look like his art?</br>  <br>she supposed to have a big jew nose</br>  <br>He confirmed EM and YH as the canon ships.</br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br>What was the Lost Girls VN about anyway?</br>  <br>I s this real life</br>  <br>You sound like a bumrustled EHfag.</br>  Any info about the new high school spin off chapter?  <br>Yea they suk</br>  <br>They aren't that bad anymore, after reading some translated chapters.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up they suk</br>  <br>It's decent though. I didn't like it much because anons were claiming it was out of character, but everyone is pretty damn in character in the translated chapters I read. I couldn't tell before because it was in nip.</br>  <br> The magazine also notes that there will be an "important announcement" regarding Saki Nakagawa's Attack on Titan: Junior High comedy spinoff <br>Their voices in the spinoff would sound awkward as fuck, especially Annie's.</br></br>  <br>So is LM confirmed or BTFO?</br>  <br>Depends on the art stle. Is it gonna be in the same shitty style as chuugakkou? Is it gonna be like the chibi versions? Or is it going to be like the actual anime? <br>Chuu wasn't even funny so the only reason I'd bother to watch it is if it looks aesthetically pleasing.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>I liked some chapters so I don't care about the style. If it's going to be an anime, then I guess it will keep the same style. If they made it as anime BR specials they could do it in the usual chibi style.</br>  <br> Annie playing the tsundere with a deep voice </br>  <br>Why? It didn't really bother me in the anime specials.</br>  <br>Because she was in character in the specials.<br>In the spinoff the only thing they have in common is the name.</br></br>  <br>Annie isn't tsundere in the spinoff, she just has a crush on Eren and is indifferent about everything else, slowly warming up to Bert but nothing romantic so far. I don't know why people keep calling her a tsundere.</br>  <br>Not really, she's pretty much herself. Unless you're in denial about her crush on Eren.</br>  Season 2 never.  <br><br> Annie isn't tsundere in the spinoff <br> she's pretty much herself <br>Okay. I honestly see no resemblance, neither in appearance or character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't even have her beautiful nose.</br>  I'm looking forward to the chuugakkou anime if that's what the announcement really is. I hope they do something with Spoof too. Maybe they could make them the new specials for season 2 or something  <br>Nice cherrypicking, I can do that too to prove the opposite.</br>  <br>That's not what tsundere means but I agree that she's looks pretty out of character there.</br>  <br>This looks more like the author making fun of the fanbase. The gorilla joke was also started by fans.</br>  So, can we agree that The Norns = MRS?<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norns<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I don't mind Chuugakkou Annie either, I can see her acting like that in a universe where she hadn't been raised to be an assassin who treats the world as her enemy. Characters' personalities are often shaped by their environment, past or experiences. This is especially true for Annie.<br><br>I am angry about her nose not being represented properly, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Why were the walls named after Mario, Rose, and Sina if only one ancient titan built them?</br>  I like the titans this chapter.  <br>Yeah the designs are more generic but I don't really care about the looks in a comedic spinoff. It isn't as out of character as some anons claim though.</br>  <br>This is not a good example of tsundere behavior.</br>  <br>Every thread until you like it?</br>  <br>It sold shitloads, it will be animated, and with a bigger budget for that matter.</br>      <br>Under normal circumstances I'd share your sentiments, but Annie's nose is a sacred thing.</br>  <br>Post yummy curry instead to celebrate YH/EM's confirmation in ch71.</br>  The rarest.  <br>Read this chapter. And the volleyball one</br>  <br> dat Annie </br>  The spinoff doesn't do a good job at keeping them in character. I think the author tried too hard to exaggerate one of their character traits to the point that some of them are not themselves anymore.  I was looking some pages up and this showed.<br>Is it just me or he resembles  Kichiro Moto  a bit?</br>    <br>What the fuck is wrong with his eyebrows?</br>  <br>You're thinking too much into it, for a parody it's just fine.</br>  <br>Not at all. He's supposed to be this guy I think.</br>  <br>Not really, at least the hair doesn't look similar.</br>  I don't like the way the spinoff forces shipping into it. Most of the ships are absolute crack  <br>The best kind of curry.</br>  <br>That curry actually looks pretty gross.</br>  <br>I like to imagine that the spinoff is making fun of the fandom for doing the same thing and you shouldn't take it so seriously.</br>  <br> Mikasa&gt;Eren <br> Annie&gt;Eren <br> Bert&gt;Annie <br> Ymir&gt;Historia <br> crack <br>You what.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which ones? YH, EM, BA, and RH are all taken from canon, you can make the argument that EA is as well. Those are the ones it usually uses more than others and none of those are crack.</br>  <br> Annie&gt;Eren <br> not complete delusion <br>I can mention a couple more like how ErwL gets teased, Frieda having a thing for her sister and Hitch being a slut for Annie.</br></br></br>  <br>There is some teasing for joke ships, but the ships that get the main pandering make sense.</br>  <br>It's debatable, but not crack.</br>  <br>Annie&gt;Eren isn't delusion, Eren just doesn't like her. ErwL doesn't get teased, contrary to popular belief, and Frieda finds Historia too cute, she doesn't have a thing for her. Stop pretending to be retarded. I agree about Hitch but Hitch being a slut is a thing almost everywhere, in Spoof and the VNs included.</br>  <br> Annie&gt;Eren isn't delusion, Eren just doesn't like her. <br>They used to be good friends, that's all.<br>Whether Annie liked him or not is another story.</br></br></br>  <br>It's about time the spinoff started including Historia &gt; Eren and some rivalry between Mikasa and Historia.</br>  <br> Whether Annie liked him or not is another story. <br>It's not another story, it's the point. It's not going to happen in the manga or the spinoff since Eren is on one hand oblivious and on the other hand he doesn't like her in a romantic way. But Annie liking him is hard to deny.</br></br>  <br>In the Valentine and Frieda chapters it's heavily implied that YH are a couple.</br>  <br> Annie&gt;Eren isn't delusion <br>Except that it is. She never gave any signs that she liked him in that way. I saw nothing but admiration and respect going from Annie to Eren and vice versa.</br></br>  <br>Eren is too retarded to like anyone so that spinoff author takes advantage of it.</br>  <br>Isayama is giving the author a lot of ideas and is supervising the manga. He seems to be fine with Annie&gt;Eren</br>  <br> I saw nothing but admiration and respect going from Annie to Eren and vice versa. <br>Yeah okay, but you should read the manga for a change<br> learn how to talk to girls </br></br></br>  <br>She was telling him to pay stop being oblivious about Mikasa.</br>  <br>She probably has his porn book and is threatening him she'll post them if he complains about anything.<br>On a serious note, I doubt Isayama cares.</br></br>    <br>Yeah. Sure. Whatever you say.</br>  <br>Disgusting. How can people eat this shit?</br>  <br>Who knows. The manga is still mostly pandering to the main ships besides some teasing for joke ships. Hitch/Annie felt more like a joke for example, since it only happened in one chapter. In the Valentine chapter Hitch actually gave Marlo chocolate, which makes sense.</br>  <br>Fuck off and die EHfag. Historia hates and resents Eren and is no competition for MIkasa.</br>  <br>Like the sauce looks like shit, literally. The piece of cheese stuck in the second bowl is pretty out of place. The meat is black like rotten hrse meat. And there's menstrual blood in the other half of each bowl.<br><br>The rice is nice though.</br></br></br>  <br> blushes when he compliments her <br> she hates and resents him <br><br> is no competition <br> "you're an amazing person Historia" <br> "I like you just the way you are" <br>Kek<br><br>I would start worrying about Mikasa being the next Keith</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Good one.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if there's a chapter with EH shenanigans in it. I'm hoping for a chapter with Uncle Troubles bullying Reiner next though.</br>  <br>She likes him like a brother, she doesn't hate him.</br>  Next Chuugakkou is probably going to be about Keith getting cucked since it's the most obvious choice.  <br>So she wants to fuck her brother?</br>  <br>That would be hilarious actually. The manga chapter was already funny as is.</br>  <br>God, you sure are mad, go take some pills.</br>  <br>That's retarded. Annie is neither a matchmaker nor an altruist, she had no reason whatsoever to bring them together and was shown to ignite a rivalry with Mikasa two pages after.</br>  Speculation time<br> Grisha was a spy from an outside faction  <br> his heart softened and he became empathetic for the walled people and the SL's cause <br> he ended up betraying his faction <br><br>Grisha is what BRA could have been had they given in to their growing attachment to humanity. The question is, did Grisha know about the attacks? If he knew then how come he allowed his family to live in Shiganshina? Unles he needed to be in shiganshina for x reason. It's even possible that Grisha never stopped being a spy, his loyalty was always with whichever faction he was allied to. <br> steal coordinate from the evil Reiss <br> give it to his son <br><br>What kind of predictament does this put Eren in? Grisha could have been one of the leaders of the warrior village, making Eren a possible heir. How will Eren react to finding out that he has an affiliation to the very people who destroyed his family and killed his comrades? Will he take pity on them or will he mercy kill them. I can see BR siding with Eren against MT, I can't see how Eren can take MT on one-on-one. <br><br>Or Grisha could have been from Ymir's faction, however I don't see this as likely considering Grisha and MT look like they could be blood related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Sasha a titan?  <br>He seemed surprised and vengeful at Carla dying. I don't think he knew it was coming since it didn't look like he was in a hurry.</br>  <br>We still don't know where Ymir's faction is on it, MT could even be the actual ruler of them, or someone who decended from them. I don't much similarities between him and Grisha besides maybe the glasses.</br>  What is this Lost Girls anyway? Any summaries?  <br>I don't think Grisha is from BRA's village.<br>I doubt he was on a mission, but rather fleeing from somewhere, judging by the bruises.</br></br>  I want to abuse the Young Grisha.   Mikasa &amp; Annie &amp; Historia &gt; Eren <br> Reiner &amp; Ymir &gt; Historia <br> Jean &gt; Mikasa <br> Bert &gt; Annie <br> Ouruo &gt; Petra <br> Erwin &gt; Marie <br><br>Does Isayama like to add one-sided romances because it makes his characters more flawed and pitiable? Or does he add it for the sole purpose of suffering?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Frieda &gt; Historia</br>  <br><br>And Keith &gt; Carla &gt; Grisha<br>and  Kenny &gt; Uri </br></br></br>  <br>He adds it for the  cuck </br>  <br>You know I wouldn't call Annie &gt; Eren so one sided though.</br>  <br>And Marco &amp; Armin &gt; Jean</br>  <br> Kenny &gt; Uri <br>He seemed to have more of a thing for NotAnnie to be honest. He was just close to Uri in the BR kind of way.</br></br>  <br>Isayama said Eren doesn't see her that way. Actually he said there's just mutual respect, so it kinda sinks the ship from Annie's side too.</br>  <br>Historia &gt; Hanji is missing</br>  <br>Isayama seems to really have a thing for loyalty. Keith still liked Carla after almost 20 years. Sames goes for Kenny still being loyal to Uri after he died.</br>  <br>You forgot Eren -&gt; Mikasa and Historia -&gt; Ymir. and you made a mistake with Historia-&gt; Eren.</br>  <br>It's time to let it go.</br>  <br>for you</br>  Who will be the next cuck and why is it Levi?  <br>When things comes to romance authors will never be truthful and in your place I wouldn't take his words too seriously. <br><br>For me personally the way it was depicted in manga it didn't felt one sided at all. And overall this ship is very subtle.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not fooling anyone Isayama.</br>  <br> not posting CR </br>  <br>Eren still doesn't like her.</br>  <br> it didn't felt one sided at all <br>This. He even blushes because of her </br></br>  <br>I'd rather believe Isayama's words and my opinion than yours. To me Annie x Eren is a crackship as much as Historia x Eren.</br>  <br> author denies the ship <br> h-he's lying! <br>Come on.</br></br></br>  <br> Historia x Eren. <br>I can give you EA being crack but Isayama is obviously going for EH.</br></br>  <br> obviously <br>Not really.</br></br>  wasted chapter. That flashback with Eren's mom could be summarized for 2 pages. Isayama missed a chance to involved Mikasa. Her keeping a damning secret would add depth to her boring character.  <br>We still have to wait for more chapters and development for a confirmation.</br>  <br>This. Nobody would love a Jewgirl, only uggos like Bertl. Especially when Eren has Mikasa already.<br><br><br>It is.<br><br><br>Ahahah. Even Eren x Annie is more canon than the delusional crackship that is EH.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's blushing because he is being nearly suffocated. I think it's very possible that Annie had a thing for Eren, but there's no reason to believe it was reciprocated.</br>    <br>Fucking this. Perfect explanation. Same thing happened to Historia when she "blushed" for Eren (she was just being embarrassed from Mikasa choking her using her Darth Vader powers).</br>  <br>He's obviously blushing because of her comment and her wanting to teach him how to talk to girls.</br>  <br>For how long will you be in damage control? I though you said you would drop out of butthurt.</br>  <br>All shipping aside, I hope we get a flashback scene showing her actually trying to teach him that and him just being horrible at it.</br>  <br>He can't breathe there, he eve says it, stop being so delusional.</br>  <br>In all seriousness, Historia is probably developing feelings for Eren. She acted like the typical girl that just got complimented by her crush. She also sensed the jealous aura around Mikasa and looked terrified by it.</br>  <br>He might leave when Jean finally dies. Hopefully MT will do the job, since obviously one or all of JSC are going to die.</br>  <br>You forgot Jean</br>  <br> third panel </br>  <br> being this delusional </br>  <br>What does Jean have to do with loving Yummy curry? You sound like a deluded reverse shitposter.</br>  <br>This. Frieda had the same reaction when Historia told her she was a nice person.</br>  <br>And also Eren was the first one to say he liked her by what she is besides her best friend, and he was willing to give his life for her.</br>  <br>Why is Annie there?</br>  Reminder that Historia is the worst girl.  <br>JSC will be the only ones left in the end</br>  <br> give his life for her <br>That's not exactly how it was.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>This</br>  <br>Finally some good poster for a change.<br><br><br><br>People like you should be put in a mental asylum.<br> expecting hetshit in a LGBT manga like Attack on Titan <br>Titan = cishetwhite patriarchy<br>Attack on = ^</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does Mikasa look so pissed at Armin after he smiled and waved at her</br>  <br>This. It obviously wasn't for humanities sake. He just wanted to save Historia.</br>  <br>Nah, second place after Mikasa.</br>  <br>She probably started developing feelings for him right after he told her that he liked her just the way she was. There's this panel in the political arc where she's staring at him with such intensity that you'd think she was raping him with her eyes.</br>  <br>He wanted to give his life to her so she could save humanity, that's how it was.</br>  PaniPoniDash<br><br><br>Can we talk about PaniPoniDash anon?</br></br></br>  Subtle Pani poni dash thread then?

Her father loved the cloth that she wove and so she worked very hard every day to weave it. However, Orihime was sad that because of her hard work she could never meet and fall in love with anyone. Concerned about his daughter, Tentei arranged for her to meet Hikoboshi who lived and worked on the other side of the Amanogawa. When the two met, they fell instantly in love with each other and married shortly thereafter. However, once married, Orihime no longer would weave cloth for Tentei and Hikoboshi allowed his cows to stray all over Heaven. In anger, Tentei separated the two lovers across the Amanogawa and forbade them to meet. Orihime became despondent at the loss of her husband and asked her father to let them meet again. Tentei was moved by his daughterâ€™s tears and allowed the two to meet on the 7th day of the 7th month if she worked hard and finished her weaving. <br><br>Requesting Tanabata art of the Weaving Princess.</br></br>    The hell that isn't a new drawing, why did you pick that.<br>Requesting lewds of these two please</br>  I would appreciate anything of Kurumi. For example, wearing an evening dress sitting on a bed's edge, or at a bar or sorts. If you want a specific outfit, a classy dress fashioned after her Astral Dress.  Can I get lewds of the two silver haired girls from Strike the Blood? Together, solo/staight, or like /u/ whatever is okay.  <br><br>I don't really understand the festival, so have this.

Very well done.</br>  <br>He better not request this weekend</br>  Requesting Tamamo showing off her underboob.  <br>Whether you understood it or not, you still created something lovely for it. Thank you very much, I hope your week is just as lovely.</br>  These two girls getting roughly dicked for the first time forgetting about their yuri love beside eachother, or one done and the other mid-. and/or kissing  <br>You know he will like the fag he is<br><br>That's your weekend delivery</br></br></br>  A drawing of this please  <br>requesting nice things to these two</br>  Someone draw Leon, the protag of GARO anime, killing a non-human girl, demon would be best.  Rough lewds<br>Anything lewd and being done roughly</br>  <br>Wait did someone draw this for me like they did ? I honestly wasn't expecting that after I found out about the Megumi one and that I'd skipped over it. Thanks, drawfriend.</br>  requesting tamamo lying in bed pov similar to this<br>Maybe with a fang showing</br>  Requesting Megumi masturbating and curling her toes.

I would love a mecha-girl dog-girl of a BuCue from Gundam please  Requesting Sawyer sitting on a chair, shoes off, in a pose a lot like this one: <br><br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2756923<br><br>Perhaps holding her UltraVoice to her neck/throat.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Jesus, watching that gave me a hardon.<br>That said, I don't know why anyone would want to draw what you're requesting.</br></br>  <br><br>ycake is that you? Because it certainly isn't me.  I like it </br></br>  <br> That's your weekend delivery <br><br> He better not request this weekend <br><br>not him but is there a general rule against requesting on the weekend if youve been delivered to during the week? because its tuesday.<br>i suppose its just another "fuck (insertcharacter)fag" but even then why wouldnt he be able to request on the weekend?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just Lolyfag spilling his autism, ignore it and I hope the OR does too.</br>  <br> got two deliveries in the weekend <br> requested again like a greedy fuck <br> requesting right when the weekend just finished <br> got another delivery <br> will try and request again this weekend <br>Sounds like a case of being a greedy asshole.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>while there's no actual rules regarding this, the WWDs exist as a sort of containment thread to keep the waifu requests out of the general drawthreads, which is why normally you wouldn't request your waifu in the regular drawthread during the week.</br>  Just by the name, I assume the waifu drawthread happens on weekends, but does it start on Friday or Saturday?  <br>At the moment it starts on friday, early in the morning american time, but it seems to be getting earlier every week.<br>It lasts until the sunday is over, again, american time, but as long as the final thread is alive, it'll last into monday as well.</br></br>  <br>Exactly. Spamming your waifu getting drawn in both the weekend and weekday is selfish as fuck. Not that it can't be done, but seriously don't expect shit the rest of the week<br>He doesn't even draw. Just vultures in streams</br></br>  Requesting Junko Enoshima and Ikusaba Mukuro in this exact position except instead of Junko Holding up fried chicken she's holding up the earth.  <br>And is the biggest crybaby this side of faggot town.</br>  <br>Never saw any rules about it.</br>  Requesting Mato Kuroi and Black Rock Shooter from the BRS series in the kitchen trying to cook something but ultimately failing or having a hard time at it, please!<br><br>Thanks if you pick this up!</br></br>  <br>shit if its true i dont know how i didnt notice this since i was there<br><br><br>like i said then<br><br><br>i suppose so<br>but because its an overflow of waifu i suppose  husbandos are ok to request during the week <br>since theyre far and few in between<br><br><br>12:00am 4chan time (EST) and ends sunday night when the last thread dies<br>although it seems that anons are ignoring the start and just making it hours earlier like this last one<br>4 hours early i think<br><br><br>i tend to treat the WWD and the general as two separate beasts<br>as in if i get a delivery in WWD i can request an entirely separate pic when monday comes around and vise versa with the general,<br>but if thats not advised, whats the general rule on wait times until you can request again?<br>i always though around a week would be good<br>again, NOT for re-requesting, for an entirely different request</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Maki from love live starting at a clock with a worried expression almost on the verge of tears because husbando-kun hasn't been home in days, please.  ;_;   <br>pls</br>  <br>You can have a million requests in the general and no one would know, unless you stick to the same characters or your waifu, making it obvious. If you want something similar, just wait few days, maybe 2-3 threads, should be fine.<br><br>Waifu requests in the general should be only something that wouldn't get drawn in WWD (interaction with other characters, overly complicated scenarios), but the more you request, the more you risk someone complaining about it.</br></br></br>  <br>I see, so that makes it pretty early in the "weekend"<br><br><br>I'm new to the waifu drawthreads but I feel like I shouldn't involve her until the weekend comes.<br><br>Thanks for the info</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no rule. Just intuition that you're milking drawings for you for free.<br>Tone it down, or request something that isn't so "draw my waifu"y</br></br>  Requesting this drawing of Birdy with colors please. <br>She is wearing jean shorts not too sure on the top colors, so I'll leave that to colorfag. <br>http://imgur.com/a/cmY90#0<br>Thank you~</br></br></br>  <br>i usually only request my husbando in both the general and the WWD but i keep it the requests really simple so i guess i should be fine by that logic<br><br><br> all of my requests are draw X(pic) but with Y(husbando) <br>fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Diegofag please.</br>  <br> spoiler <br>Then how come I still hardly ever see husbandos in here?<br>I get tired of drawing waifus sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>Requesting Maki from love live starting at a cock with a worried expression almost on the verge of tears because its so much bigger than her husbando-kuns, and shes trying so hard to resist.</br>  [Sniff lolibutt]<br><br>Requesting her on all four please.</br></br>  Lolyfag please fucking stop.  <br> kitty.jpg <br>you had one job anon</br></br>  <br> Kitty <br>That's a dog, you scum.</br></br>  Reposting my request from a few threads back, lost track of the threads for a bit.<br><br>Requesting Rias Gremory in a dunk tank please.

Post it.</br>  <br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48385</wbr></br>  So what shows have you dropped based on their first episodes?<br>pic related.</br>  <br>The fuck were you expecting?</br>  It was just so dull.  <br>A comedy series. I wasn't expecting the male-targeted version of Diabolik Lovers. <br>Have you dropped any series yet this season?</br></br>    <br>Fucking anime only fag</br>  Elven Lied, especially after the piss scene.  <br> muh source material <br>It still sucks</br></br>  <br> dropping the show thats going to get the most talkback threads on /a/ this season <br><br>do you hate fun?</br></br></br>  <br>holy shit you're lucky, i watched that entire shitstain before realizing it was garbage</br>  <br>well doll tits ... is way better than a pink flash like to love...<br><br>to love = BD<br><br>monster i will keep going.</br></br></br></br></br>  The only show I've ever dropped on episode 1 was Hyouka. maybe ill try it again.  I dropped Chaos Dragon because the frames hurt my eyes. It also seemed way too shounen for my tastes.  <br>A male MC who's basically powerless and is constantly physically abused by women isn't fun for everyone, masochistfag.</br>  I dropped Gangsta cuz its so fucking gay.  <br>You just have shit tastes son.</br>   male mc with a bunch of girls <br>Why even give it a chance</br>  <br>But there are a lot of betafags and Taigafags around here.</br>  <br>I read manga and I dropped anime before finishing first episode.</br>  <br> le gangsta gay summer meme </br>  <br>Yes and this is softcore porn for them. What's your point?</br>    <br>You forgot to say he punches two humans who were talking shit of the girl in this very chapter.</br>  <br> benis </br>  <br>The designs in Gangsta wouldn't look out of place in a bara series.</br>  <br>Gangsta is really gay</br>  <br> b-but muh haremshit circlejerks <br>This is probably the worst reason ever to watch a shitty show.</br></br>  <br> female writer <br> yaoi hands </br></br>  <br>Those designs are better than the gangsta ones.</br>  <br>I remembered liking the manga (haven't read it in a while), but I forgot just how contrived and shitty the writing is.<br><br>I know it's just a dumb comedy series, but it's still pretty bad.</br></br></br>  What good shit there's this season? I'm feeling like picking up something.  <br>The monsters shit you mention OP<br>Gangsta<br>Chaos Dragon<br>Bikini Warriors</br></br></br></br>   masturbating the snake monster <br><br>dropped, subtle if you don't know where the snake cloacas are though</br></br>  <br>forgot, also the royal family with powers thingie</br>  <br>Same. Not to mention that ridiculous edgy shit end. <br><br>This coming from a guy that never drops a show. Literally 2 out of the 600+ I've seen.</br></br></br>  Chaos Dragon<br>Joukamachi no Dandelion<br>Charlotte<br>Wakaba*Girl<br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu<br>Ushio to Tora<br>Okusama ga Seitokaichou!<br>Shimoneta</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   dropping shows <br>Not like I have anything better to do, besides I'm pretty good at picking out shows I know I'll like. <br><br>If I did drop anything it would probably be Gate though.</br></br></br>  <br>Some anime try<br>some anime fail<br>others Isuca</br></br></br>  <br>time to get a job.</br>  <br>Most of them. I drop 3 shows for every one I continue watching and I'm being generous.</br>  <br>Dropped that too, though for different reasons.<br><br> breast upgrade for Papi <br> retarded small wings <br> not avian looking legs <br> small talons <br>In short, giving DFC/Papi fans the middle finger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dropped, only to be picked up again once BDs are out.</br>  <br><br> dropping something because it's vaguely homoerotic <br><br>top pleb</br></br></br></br>  <br>sup LRD</br>  <br> dropping monster musume <br>are you gay or something?</br></br>   a-am i fitting in yet? : the thread   <br> Bawwwww some people don't like my harem shit of the year </br>   I can judge a whole show from 20 minutes!   <br><br> muh 3 episode rule </br></br>  <br> anime is such a complex medium that you have to spend at least 60 minutes watching it before making a judgement </br>  <br>Your still not fitting in, anon, try harder</br>  You guys are just as contrarian as ever.  <br><br>To be fair, it's not uncommon for good shows to have really weak starts, so the three episode rule is a good way of cementing an opinion.<br><br> In this case however, you really just need to read the manga to know if you'll like the show </br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you marathoned it?</br>  <br> So what shows have you dropped based on their first episodes <br>None, because:<br><br>a) I am not a huge fucking faggot<br>b) I don't claim to drop shows based on their first episode on anonymous image boards only to pose as an attention whore<br>c) the show is exactly what i expected<br>d) go fuck yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And this show caters to my fetish, too. What a bland and stupid premise, even by anime standards.</br></br>  <br> being this mad </br>  Nothing from this season but I havent properly decided what to check out yet.<br><br>Last series I instantly dropped was Love Lab. Also only saw one episode of Plastic Memories but I may still give it a watch.</br></br>  That shimoneta show. It got boring quickly  <br> gangstafags desperately defending his shit </br>  <br>calm down anon, your new is showing</br>  <br>Based google image search giving me nothing.</br>  <br>Dropped it before I picked it up. I read the manga when it first started serialization. Got up to chapter 14 before I couldn't stomach it anymore.<br><br>With how arrogant and stuck-up the fanbase is acting, I really hope this attracts all of the shitposters for the season.</br></br></br>  <br> "only to pose as an attention whore" <br> posts a blog </br></br>  <br>fuckoff tripfag</br>  If you're dropping a show from the first episode you could have just read a summary of the premise before watching and realize you wouldn't like it in the first place.  Shows I finished and dropped on episode 1:<br>Classroom<br>Laplace<br>Overlord<br>Chaos Dragon<br><br>Shows I didn't even make it to the end of episode 1:<br>DBS<br>Shinometa<br><br>So far this season has been complete shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   /a/ and other places constantly shit on mlp and furries <br> unironically jerk off to snake pussy <br><br>you people</br></br></br>  <br>Really?<br>You were really expecting this to be JUST a comedy?</br></br>  <br>What's this?

I'm not gonna greet someone and then say "I jacked it to snake pussy a few minutes ago. Don't you love monster girls? It gets good after a while when you get used to it, I promise"<br><br>tl;dr - it's the cringy fans that are the issue; not so much the content</br></br></br>   mangafags have been hyping Jitsu wa and Monster Girl for months, even years <br> turns out both shows are just another generic haremshit <br>Every fucking time<br>Is Prison School going to share the same fate?</br></br></br>  <br> defending shit </br>  <br>Nice to see someone on /a/ isn't dumb enough to follow the fucking crowd. Literally the shittiest harem pandering shit to come out this year and since this is a coummity of mostly fapping men who never seen the likes of a real chick we'll get more threads about this than fucking Naruto ever did. <br><br>tl;dr...cancer.</br></br></br>  <br> manga adaptation was a mistake </br>  <br>Jitsu Wa was hyped? I didn't know it existed until this season.<br>Prison School's anime is inevitably going to be absolute shit. The comedy timing and art of the manga won't work in an animated format.</br></br>  <br>Plus J.C staff.</br>  <br>jc staff has been pretty good lately</br>  <br> shit <br>typical /a/ - every day for 4 months now all i saw was monster musume hype threads and now that it's finally here, first episode barely just got out, and people are already shitting on it. And i don't get why...it'e exactly what it was supposed to be. <br><br>I don't defend shit - i defend anything that does what it's supposed to do, whether it's shit or not. Not to mention that judging it after just 1 episode is retarded. <br><br>So yeah, as i said...go fuck yourselves and don't watch it if you don't like it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nothing, because it's one fucking episode.

I don't know if it's always been this way.  <br>but leddit love fanservice</br>   tfw every show I'm watching this season has been great   <br> I'm not gonna greet someone and then say "I jacked it to snake pussy a few minutes ago.

Are you mostly liking and watching diabolik to compare it</br>  Does Gintama get good? I watched the first few episodes and hated it so I'm about to drop it.  Was about to drop Chaos Dragon but then battle started and OP song kicked in and I got interested in what will happen next week.  <br>reason?<br>You mostly dissapointed on danmachi because you are harem hater and shitposter. It's good enjoyable adaptation. It's obvious from the start how's the story goes.</br></br>   Monstergirl fags are now back in force after we managed to finally get rid of them <br>God dammit</br>  Gate. The direction was weird. All this crazy shit is happening and apparently we're supposed to care, yet MC doesn't give a shit in the midst of it because he didn't get to buy his porn. Why should I care if MC doesn't.<br><br>I would've dropped Monmusu but MC punching the faggot for making fun of his waifu makes me think there's at least some potential.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127752047 <br> No Supah <br>GAY<br>A<br>Y<br><br><br>hope this means MGQ ovas are on the works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You give no good reason before so your post just pure insult and not critic.</br>  <br>DBS thread is mostly has the same atmosphere in shounen fags fujoshi threads. i wonder why.</br>   everyone and their mother recommends it <br> it's so boring one 22 minute episode felt like two hours. </br>  I dropped your favorite anime this season. I didn't even make it to the opening.  <br> implying you ever truly drove them off </br>  <br>You just dont deserve Lain...</br>  So this is shitpost general then? I want /v/ scum to leave. I can smell the cross boarding from here.  <br>But I love [my favorite anime], you must just have shit taste</br>  <br>Who the fuck are you?</br>  <br> /v/ even attempting to watch a fetish harem show <br>good one</br></br>  <br>Everyone is entitled to their how opinion.<br>Except you, shitlord.<br><br>This is just a bait thread. <br>Sage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And you don't seem to understand.</br>  <br>It was  fun . I really don't like the fact that Kana Hanazawa is voicing the MC, but I like the rest of it so far. I just wish we had subs that weren't funi-shit (it's bad funi, too. several fucked up lines and flat out missing words in the first ep).</br>  <br>A shame you seemed an honest man.</br>  <br>This shit right here, I mean the first half of the episode was 10/10 then the second half basically took it all and made it complete shit pulling all the fucking shit tropes<br><br> Parents are overseas <br> teleports behind you <br> MC that can control minds can't do it to escape because plot <br> I have to live with my little sister </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Alex main girl <br> nina, erica, veronica, constans, ojou, and more appear <br> yaoi <br>Top fucking summer.</br></br></br></br>  <br> ... <br> questioning fictional pedophilia on /a/ <br> likening fictional loli to real life  <br/></br></br></br>  <br>takes around 20 episodes for shit to get real but gintama is a ride that once it gets going, it is near impossible to stop</br>   Sore ga Seiyuu <br> Story by the girl who play Risa in Hayate no Gotoku and drawn by Hata himself <br> anime looks nothing like his artstyle </br></br>  <br>Thats cause it's animated by gonzo.<br>Also, it looks like his art style.</br></br>  <br>maybe they'll subvert them later but yeah I'm not really keeping my fingers crossed</br>  <br> fictional pedophilia <br>This is how it starts</br></br>  <br>At least it gave me 0 minutes of fun unlike Plastic memories where gary stu and moeblob waifu was established in the first 56 seconds</br>  <br>No it doesn't.

The first episodes of all of these suck ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someday you'll learn that good taste and low standards are the same thing.</br>   All the animeonly fags flooding in and giving their worthless two cents.  <br><br>We knew it was coming and it still sucks.</br></br>  <br>This season:<br><br>I dropped Monmusu too, the entire thing could use some more common sense, and I should've never picked it up in the first place because harem. Dat ED though.<br><br>Dropped Laplace and Classroom Crisis because it's rather dull.<br><br>Dropped Gangsta because it tries WAY too hard at doing that entire grimy life shtick.<br><br>Still holding on: Chaos Dragon, GATE, Gatchaman Crowds Insight<br><br>Actually impressed me: Shimoneta, LWA Enchanted Parade, NNB Repeat, Charlotte</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Spice and Wolf is good if you like atmosphere. It does a great job of making different towns feel alive and giving an impression that there's a whole world of them out there interacting with each other.</br>  I dropped Chaos Dragon for sure.  <br>If child soldiers, child murder, rape, almost rape, pogroms, betrayal, and mindbreak are your kind of thing then you should keep up with Gangsta.<br><br>Assuming they don't censor any of it there's all that in store for the first season and for reference the first episode of the anime was more graphic than the first chapter of the manga.<br><br>Also you're gonna miss out on best girl of the season, Loretta.<br><br> Tfw no mafioso's headstrong daughter waifu </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, in spite of the shitloads of competition from the aspies, retards and faggots that infest /a/, I believe we've finally found the dumbest fucker yet.<br>Congratulations.</br></br>  <br> Spice and Wolf <br>This series has some selling points, namely: Medieval setting and its economy lectures, and the banter between Holo and Lawrence. If that two doesn't sell the series for you, I'm afraid it's not for you.<br><br> Blue Steel <br>It's like an anime Michael Bay movie, with ship lasers and predictable plot twists and tear jerkers. It has that campy feel to it, but nonetheless an entertaining ride for the execution alone. Unless you dislike the CG, of course.<br><br> FMA Brotherhood <br>Seriously? Brotherhood is a completely different take on the story and is a definite classic for how much better it was from the orginal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> literally a child </br>  <br>What about  child rape? </br>  <br> Just tender holding </br>  <br>Are you actually retarded?</br>  <br><br>Zeta Gundam</br></br>    <br>Yeah. I'm gonna follow the three episode rule for this one but it's probably going to be a drop. The MC getting kicked around pissed me off for some reason.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>I feel sorry for you</br>  <br> Charlotte <br> Somehow impressing <br><br>I see now, you are impressed by stupid imoutos and bad written characters</br></br></br></br>  I try not to drop shows. I may leave them for a while, but I come to finish. I figure if I'm gonna sit and criticize it or laud it, I'll have to watch it through. Pic related, hated almost every part but stuck with it till the end.  <br>From a purely technical standpoint, Charlotte looks better than half the season's other offerings because Aniplex bux and Kyoani-lite. The protagonist basically Kanye, which is a good thing in my book. Added to that, Jun Maeda wrote this, which means I'll be sticking around no matter what at least until the big reveal.</br>  Does it get good?  <br>Fuck off you retard. Different people have different tastes, the fuck do you think you are?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I rarely drop a show right away, but there are a few.<br><br>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure<br>Mikakunin de Shinkoukei (Don't even remember what this was)<br>Natsume Yuujinchou (Same with this)<br>The Tatami Galaxy<br>Sorcerer Hunters<br><br><br>Spice and Wolf improves a lot once they get moving. The first episode does suck hard though. I cringed through most of it.<br><br>Black Lagoon is pretty much the same thing all the way through but with more action.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He didn't get to the school festival arc <br><br>casul</br></br></br>  <br><br>Alright. I'll try to pick it up. Pacing seems slow though.</br></br>  I haven't dropped anything yet because I have yet to pick anything up. Shit season is shit.  Aquarion Logos  <br> tfw I love shit seasons so I don't stress about keeping up with shows <br><br> this season <br> still have 9 shows I'm watching  <br><br>GOD DAMMIT JAPAN!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Darker than Black <br>What didn't you liked about it? I just liked the show so much I'm asking. The night city atmosphere felt so good and two-faced MC was cool and entertaining.<br><br> Haganai <br>It will get more serious and "realistic".<br> Spice and Wolf <br>It'll improve a little but still there were too much economic shit happening I was not interested about.<br><br>Same here. But that's mostly because I didn't like Hajime and all that light-hearted atmosphere.<br><br> Natsume Yuujinchou <br>But it is so heart warming, kind and comfy.<br><br> The Tatami Galaxy <br>MC's speech will get slower.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are me. But I'm usually following 30 shows per season and stressing about not having time to watch backlog and other media. <br>This season is literally summer break for me.</br></br>  Deadman Wonderland, it feels like whoever wrote it never talked to anyone in his life  <br>If you're not into high school SOL, KyoAni or "mystery" then you're probably better off not finishing it. Still, you'll never know unless you watch it.</br>  <br> didn't watch anything and didn't give anything a chance but still think your opinion matters <br> "I-it's just a shit season, guys!" </br></br>  <br> Nigga I'm all about SoL and Kyoani.  It's just that I missed the series when it aired because of studies. I heard good stories about it and tried watching the first episode, but I kinda skipped it midway. <br><br>I'll pick it up again.</br></br></br>  <br>Watch more anime.<br>When you'll get a higher power level you'll be able to tell what the show is going to be about and how it would be according on its information and pvs. <br>Look at this pathetic scum who couldn't predict Monster Musume to be a haremshit and now butthurted about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Even assuming that's actually accurate and you not just being a picky motherfucker, if there's NOTHING this season that even slightly interests you enough to pick up, then it's probably time to stop watching anime and do something else with that time. Generally my favorites end up being the ones I give the benefit of the doubt and try anyways despite not looking very interesting.</br>  Another one I dropped. I was kinda hoping for some kind of major plot turn around mid series, but it never came, and felt like a generic mecha story. Only watched 6-7 episodes I think. Shit also had like 50 episodes, so it was too much of a commitment.  <br>  I was kinda hoping for some kind of major plot turn around mid series, <br> but it never came <br> Only watched 6-7 episodes I think. <br> like 50 episodes <br><br>You consider 6 episodes into a 50 episode series to be "mid-series"?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't blame you. I loved it, but it's definitely not for everyone.</br>  <br>Wow, just when I had already forgotten about it, your drag it up out of the ground again. It was literally "Every Bad Stereotype About Anime: The Anime"</br>  <br> But it is so heart warming, kind and comfy. <br>Had to look it up again. Yeah, the atmosphere was nice. I'll give it that. I think at the time I felt it was too simple and wanted something more engaging.<br><br> MC's speech will get slower. <br>That's a relief. I've been thinking of giving it another chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  tatami galaxy  <br>That was dumb of me. But I guess it just wasn't for me. Anyway, the songs are nice though.</br>  Charlotte and Monster Musume  <br> cheap <br> easy <br> enjoyable while you consume it even though you feel deep shame afterwards <br><br>And since I'm a fucking degenerate who feels no shame, there's no downside!</br></br></br></br></br>  Only shit I haven't dropped on the first episode this season has been:<br><br> Overlord <br> Monster <br> Aquarion <br> GATE <br> Rokka <br> Gangsta <br> Ushio to Tora <br><br> Hell, most of the other shit I didn't even get past half an episode on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The only show I have EVER dropped. I just could not stand those fucking eyes. Are they alien or sum shit? One of them even has alien antennas!  <br> version of Diabolik Lovers <br>Are you telling me Diabolik Lovers wasn't comedy?</br></br>  <br> dropping Symphogear after that hype first episode <br>anon pls</br></br>  <br>He probably hasn't watched Symphogear, anon. I hope they didn't blow all the budget on that first ep like last time, though.</br>  Oh? This one. <br><br>Empty , Fluffy , Overly happy tone of this show make me cringe harder than a gore video.<br><br>I pick the BD up later and skimming for fanservice parts though.<br><br>Quote : "Suddenly, Tits in a kiddy show."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This retarded fucking shit.  <br> not liking tomboys <br>The only way this could be better is if it had Momoka instead of the MC.<br><br> sabagebu s2 never ;_; </br></br></br></br>  Kekkai Sensen  <br>Damnit anon, I miss that show so fucking much. We need more MCs like Momoka.</br>  <br> kiddy show <br> Based on an eroge <br>Ok.</br></br></br>  I don't even know how I survived the first episode. I cringed the whole time. They destryed all of my favourite characters with the most inappropriate voice actors for the roles.<br><br>The only person to get aget a good VA was Lilith but who the fuck likes Lilith anyway? I couldn't care about her less.</br></br>  <br> Spoiler <br> The name is on the filename <br>Why do retards keep doing this?</br></br></br>  <br>I dropped it because it was so grimderp even in the first episode.</br>    <br><br>Just watch and see it for yourself.</br></br>  The last thing you see before your death.  <br>Logos.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  If you want quality stories don't watch anime.<br> He watches anime for the plot </br>  <br> gary stu and moeblob <br>What a fucking retard</br></br>  <br> muh power level is j-just higher than yours <br>Or you're just a faggot that comes to /a/ just to shitpost and not actually watch anime.

It was a great comedy and then it wasn't.  <br>Well, since a lot of the relatively underrated ones that don't receive much attention/hype at first end up becoming some of my favorites, I've pretty much adopted the mindset of just being open-minded and trying out pretty much everything, and just dropping what doesn't really interest me as the first few weeks of the season go on. Once an anime is past ep 3 rule, I'm pretty much going to finish it even if it becomes shit.</br>   Vividred Operation <br>A knock off of a knock of that physically gave me a headache in the seven minutes and thirty seconds I've watched it.

She is the girl's alternate universe counterpart, who has fallen in love with the MC's own AU self, who too is blissfully unaware of her crush.<br><br>Hijinks ensue as the two strike up a deal to give each other their darkest, most private secrets in order to equip the other with the weapons they need to conquer the heart of their other selves.
