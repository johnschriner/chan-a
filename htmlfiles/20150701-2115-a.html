Guts is one handsome motherfucker during that part.</br>  <br><br>Agree. I think it has something to do with the fact that Miura suddenly decided to start outlining his upper lip somewhere around volume 27 and his jaw stretching out from a more stylize manga proportions to more realistic (ugly) proportions as previously stated.</br></br>  Last chapters Crafty spoilers (so that the suspense stays) are out. The ride will be over im hours.<br><br>What are yout bets, people?</br></br>  <br>He was raughing when he said that.</br>  <br><br><br>That doesn't mean he was liying so if he said that that's canon in a way</br></br></br>  <br>He also said that if you swallowed Suigetsu you would get diarrhea. He was just fucking around with the questions.</br>  <br>Yet we have constant Yahari threads.

I'm only seeing two characters.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, sorry, Rabbit is not really a character, and Dog and Monkey are the same.</br></br>    <br><br>at least Horse got a great episode. That's something <br><br> no cart racing game </br></br></br></br>    Again, someone is getting fired for forgetting to colour that pinky-hook-thingamajig.<br><br> Yes, this is water bottle guy. </br></br>  <br>I will punch anyone who says Yuuko is shit now. She is the best friend you could ask for.</br>  <br>  So Mizore finally can talk to Nozomi without freaking out and confronts her on why she left her behind. Nozomi never thought of it as leaving Mizore behind, infact Nozomi didn't want Mizore to lose her chance to play in the tournament by forcing her to leave just because Nozomi had a beef with the seniors. She wanted Mizore to keep playing because she knew Mizore loved music, whether or not Mizore realized that yet herself but she does now thanks to Yuuko. Nozomi wants to apologize for making Mizore feel like crap up until now but Mizore tells her everything is diejoebu. Nozomi then reveals that she went to the concert to see her, that Nozomi has always loved the sound of Mizore's oboe. Also that she'll be at the Kansai tournament tomorrow too. Then Mizore asks Nozomi if she wants to hear her practice her solo and those two leave together. In the end, Nozomi doesn't come back to the club because Asuka still thinks its better safe than sorry just in case Mizore freaks out again. MIzore dedicates her solo to Nozomi and everything ends out great <br><br>the end  except I skipped most of the actual earlier details like how Kumiko talked to Nozomi at the pool, and how she talked to Mizore at night at band camp but you ge the idea </br></br></br>  <br>She's just going to bed, anon.</br>  <br>Missed your other posts, I don't mind a yes or a no. Does the Rikka girl get more screen time in the future?</br>  <br>Maybe she's in the JSDF, and that's when she always wakes up.</br>  ITT: Anime characters who had hard lives.   ;_;   <br> Lived in a lab for what appears to be a good portion of his childhood. <br> Was freed by a cat and sent to live in a church with his siblings under the care of a Sister. Was happy for a while. <br> The church is burned to the ground, the Sister is killed, his brother betrays him, his sister gets kidnapped and his arm gets chopped off. <br> His arm is replaced by a magical artifact which, in exchange for power, devours the souls of the people around him, making it difficult for him to be around anyone for too long. <br> Swears revenge on the people who took everything from him. <br> Goes around destroying branches of the world government. <br> Half the characters in the series have nothing but scathing insults for him. <br> He's finally reunited with his brother, who just wants to kill him. <br> A clone of his sister loves him so much that she wants to die together with him. <br> One of the strongest warriors in the world also wants to kill him. <br> When he finally finds the guy who ruined his life, he's unable to beat him. <br> Another clone of his sister shows up and sacrifices herself for him, to his chagrin.

So he tries his best to avoid having to make that kind of choice.</br></br></br></br>  Why doesn't this have a harem tag?  The first episode is delayed.
