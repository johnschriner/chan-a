[ Because jacking it to Symphogear is more fun than watching fireworks.<br><br>Also, some anon at the end of the last thread asked for a webm of Hibiki's transformation, so here it is, chock full of bloat: https://d.maxfile.ro/gtcevjepxy.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br>  I watched the first four episodes of S1 today. Got bored to fucking death.  <br>I'm sorry but you seem to have chronic case of hating fun.</br>  <br>Watch two more. It starts getting good by that point.<br>Arc-V took 7 episodes to get good.</br></br>  <br>I actually thought S1 was the best at what symphogear does.</br>  Chris better sing the ED next episode and it better be better than next Destination.  Post an image of an anime you really fucking hate<br><br>Let's see how others react to what you posted.</br></br>  <br> You have to like every anime you pick up <br> You can't express hate for an anime even though it's natural if you really don't like it </br></br>  <br>I said read it before responding. It's not even that long.</br>  <br>Don't post in this thread, I guess</br>  <br>Then why would you come to the thread? Fuck off.</br>  <br>Lain. <br>I don't exactly hate it but I fell asleep multiple times while watching it, I think it's boring as fuck and it puzzles me why to this day it still gets a vocal (and annoying) fanbase.</br></br>  Praise Hana: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bHU<wbr>-QbRHS_Q</wbr>  [ ]  <br>how do the designs looks bad?</br>   Hana Kana <br><br>Her voice just stands out so much now. I don't even hear a character anymore, I just hear Hana Kana standing behind a mic.</br></br>  <br> BotI's adaptation <br>Fuck, I had already forgot that exists.</br></br>  <br>Are you a faggot? I wish every character in existence was voiced by HanaKana.</br>  <br>Really? I actually hate her in every role she's had other than kuragehime and nisekoi, but I think she fits both of those perfectly. <br><br>I know it's kind of mainstream as well but I can totally see her being voiced by Yu Kobayashi using a very neutral tone into her batshit insane voice for the shifts.</br></br></br>  S≈çma is the red man.<br> Alice is best girl </br>  <br>Thanks.<br><br> This guy </br></br></br>    im so sad that takumi lost actually holy shit what a cunt that guy is    http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/656<wbr>02<br><br>Additional cast is announced. <br><br>Akira Hayama: Junichi Suwabe<br>Nao Sadatsuka: Saori Goto<br>Miyoko Hojo: Asami Seto</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>As an antagonist, Yugi &gt; Eizan.</br>  STILL NO SCAN OF THE ONSEN PIC WHY  What does /a/ think of Charlotte, AOTS?  <br>They'd have other ways to make sure he doesn't misuse his powers.</br>  <br>The video was to show the government what his power was, and act as a threat to him.<br><br>It had nothing to do with the cheating, they just used that as verification when bringing him in.</br></br></br>  <br>Go watch the new Death Note live action series instead. It's on right now.</br>  who?  <br>Yes, and I'm with this anon <br>This is gonna be Inou battle with more drama<br>I don't see there are gonna be battles with the powers like in Absolute Duo, World Break and that other Diomedea show this season with gunblades.<br>I think the school stuff is more like a way to keep every power user in check, because the existence of powers itself is a secret</br></br></br></br>  First the anime and now this.<br><br>Why does Umineko suffer so much?</br></br>  <br>I'm mentally broken because I believe the headmaster sprite is comparatively better than other R07 sprites?</br>  <br><br>It looks nice. Why would you hate? Just because the old was looking differently it doesn't mean that the new will be worse.</br></br>  <br>When I look at the photo backgrounds, I see Hinamizawa. The new backgrounds don't carry the same associations with them for obvious reasons. While the drawn backgrounds are superior in a technical sense, for me polished doesn't necessarily mean better. Call it autism or whatever I don't give a fuck.</br>  <br>What, did I hurt your feelings by pointing out your leeching living style and your inane belief in some internet forum's not-written posting etiquette?<br><br>Sorry.<br><br><br>Yes, period.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Berg Katze is so lucky. I wish I could be trapped inside that ribbon and spend all day resting against Hajime-chan's boobs.  Good start.  Why does Utsutsu wear a slutty bikini?  <br>It'd be extremely painful if she took it off.</br>  <br>Less to replicate.</br>  <br>Painful for my dick.</br>  Is it a fact that the strongest Nasu protagonist is Shirou Emiya? He becomes a  servant  later in life and even takes down a Servant on his own.  <br> professional training <br> years of experience <br> huge arsenal of weapons <br>Tohno can't even come CLOSE.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He would be closer to Archer or be Archer level.</br>  <br>No, he was talking about Tsukihime Shiki and F/sn Shirou using their powers to the limit. "Zenkai" means they just going all out</br>  <br>Are you trolling or you seriously this new? It's one of the most common things cited in typemoon threads.</br>  ITT: Shiki self inserts vs Shirou self inserts the thread  What do you think of Fall 2015 so far?  <br>Well, that looks like utter shit.<br><br>I never thought I'd say this, but as it stands Fall 2015 will be my first backlog season.</br></br></br>  Noragami, the rest looks shit.  <br>Thanks for the input, fujo.</br>   All this haremshit <br>Delicious.</br>  Fafner will be AotY.  Would you like a 2nd season of Ben-To?  <br>At every opportunity and the fact she tried to muff dive into muscle cop and later Shaga a lot. I didnt see her trying to rape guys.</br>  <br>She didn't take part in the bento fights and on how many guys did the story focus on anyway?</br>  <br>Well she diidnt signal that she might want dick<br><br>Is Sen a lesbian if she didnt get an ending.</br></br></br>  <br>No, she couldn't get together with MC because of the order of the gangs or something like that.</br>  <br>That's a kick in the balls to Senfags. Ume, Kyou, Oshiroi, who else?</br>  SOON.  <br>Shun saving his NAKAMA was nice.</br>  <br>QUALITY Shun always looks so moe for some reason.</br>  <br><br><br>Their making him too OP</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh my fucking Z-ONE.</br></br>  <br> Their making him too OP <br>People should stop special summoning.</br></br>  I'm never letting this die  JESUS CHRIST LET ME LEAVE<br>WHAT IS THE POINT OF NEVER ENDING THREADS? GENERALS SUCK THE FUN OUT OF EVERYTHING, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?</br>  Let's do this one more time, niggas.  I want to punch yukino  <br>Why was Yukinon eye raping Hikki?</br>  <br> S-senpai, not there~ </br>   Anime July 7th!! <br> New manga when? <br> ____Get hype!____ </br></br>  <br>it's definitely not one chapter per episode. Some things are probably going to be cut</br>  Fuck, i want 24 episodes, no 12 fucking episodes, 1 chapter is long 30/35 pages... 1 chapter= 1 episode...It is the logical choice to do  <br>THE RIDE NEVER ENDS.</br>    I want a slime to love me.  Which Character will join the Strawhats next, and why is it Hajrudin?  <br>kekko</br>  <br>it's cannon that Usopp nose fucked her</br>  <br>Baby 5.</br>  bellamy  It's either Barto or Rebecca, and both are shit.  Look kids, the SDF is cool! And you can use the money for your weaboo hobbies! Join now!  <br>Oh shit, we got a political analyst here boys.<br><br>Having some down time from your work at the think tank?</br></br></br>  <br>Hello Chinese friend.<br><br>Getting invaded on an ongoing basis generally stirs up interests in military matters.</br></br></br>  <br> Political analyst <br><br>I study Political Theory and International Relations because i decided i don't want to actually work after university and fuck around with an Arts Degree so i can be unemployed to masturbate to Animu girls forever.<br><br>So no, i'm not at all a Political Analyst at all, just another faggot posting on a board about 2D chinese cartoons who happens to know a subject.<br><br>I'm sure you know some stuff too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Put another way, the legal restrictions on the SDF's use prevented them from being dragged into conflicts that had nothing to do with them, this is part of why they are wary of easing off to allow them to fight alongside the US more, because they don't want to be pulled into e.g. another Iraq war.</br>  <br> Political Theory and International Relations <br>What are the job prospects? You know apart from being an analyst in a news agency, becoming a politician or doing something for the UN? Or teaching(bleh)?</br></br></blockquote>]
