He is burning in hell and killed most likely by ararai himself. since he was a unreliable narrator and would thus lie about mixing truth and lie to benifit himself, thus you dont trust a conman. he is dead.</br>  <br>/bɑ/ /keɪ/ /ˈmɑn/ /oʊ/ /ɡə/ /tɑr/ /rɪ/<br><br>/bɑkeɪˈmɑnoʊɡətɑrrɪ/</br></br></br>  <br>Middle school-kun, please go.</br>  <br>Karen-chan, have you brushed your teeth today?</br>  you are all EXTREMELY biased... minus one  <br>lel stay mad pleb</br>  <br>I guess, rather than Araragi, this anon is the real moralfag.</br>  lol  <br>Your name is EXTREME TRUTH...+1</br>  <br>U 2</br>  <br>go back to staying dead.<br><br><br>Thats you for being against killing his family in revenge (and justifiable so) since he should expect that, since he did go after someone else family member.</br></br></br></br>    what's their favorite beatles song?  <br>I didn't say that though.

I heard she knows about Shinobu though.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Tsukihi is mentioned as helping her work on the manga. I want a story focused on them with the plot being Karen dragging her into some Fire Sister justice that ends up involving an oddity.</br>  <br><br>But she explicitly told him it was ok to cheat, not only kiss and grope.</br></br>  <br>How would araragi get a harem end?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Z6X<wbr>iO0o2R7M</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Snake's song</br></br>  <br>What a open minded girlfriend.</br>  <br>it would be very cute<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QFA<wbr>8V9SlZZM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I made it a gif a while back.</br>  bawk (like a chicken) mono (like the disease) gattai (like Aquarion) re (like in an email)  <br>Sounds like something delicious.</br>  <br>By cheat, you only mean fuck, not an actual relationship, right?

She's achieved trex mode.</br>  <br>Digging the thickness.</br>  <br>I'll rework on the skirt for the lineart anyway, not satisfied of some stuffs already when looking at it, but won't have the occasion to continue working on it 'till tuesday anyway. Even with the wide hips and thighs intended, the legs could be a bit thinner for example.</br>  <br>Glad you like it.<br><br>I don't use a name.</br></br></br>  <br>Well the thick thighs are a matter of preference but the skirt is just not acting like a skirt. <br>I get that you did volume work under there that you want to show off but sometimes you just have to hide all of it.</br></br>  <br>Will you do Rika and Satoko?</br>  <br>I look forward to this.</br>  <br> I don't use a name <br>You. I like you.</br></br>  <br>oh I see do you have an art blog?</br>  <br>Neither, I don't like my stuff enough to post it.</br>  <br>No, that's not planned for now. after cleaning and coloring this one I intended to do at least one pose variation (same position as the original), and I wanted to make the casual clothes versions as well for Rena and Mion.<br><br>And besides her "official" sprite expressions, I always felt like she was lacking some others, mainly when being serious, I think I'll try that too.<br><br>And after that, the next character I want to draw is  Takano </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like you as much</br>  <br>I'm sorry. I'll get better and more confident.</br>  <br>Deliverin', it's finally done!<br>Thanks to all the anons who helped me along the way.<br>I'm never underestimating backgrounds again<br>I actually finished this morning, but the thread was auto-saging and I passed out before the new thread was made.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good job, drawfag</br>  <br>This is really good.</br>  <br>Nice job, I enjoyed watching that progress.</br>  <br>Aside from what another anon said about the skirt fabric, those hands are way too small in relation to her head (or maybe it's just that her head is a bit too big for her body). There's also something off about her head's placement in relation to her neck. They don't look connected.</br>  <br>Great job drawamigo, that looks wonderful! And seeing the progress sure was interesting, great great.<br>Thank you a lot! Way more than I expected</br></br>  <br>Is she a mini-GTS or is that just a really small torpedo?</br>  <br>Is there any specific height difference between these two?</br>  coloring delivery! only for 1 out of 2 pics though  going to go sleep now<br>i can't link back drawthread 1534 for some reason, it's deleted, i guess. ayamefag didn't post request for the last 2 threads too</br>  <br>Neither character's height is discussed in canon, but I believe Reco is about 5 inches taller than Reimu.</br>  <br>Thanks, I'm still sketching so this might take a while.</br>  I wish Smurf would quit posting his WIP that aren't related to general drawthread's requests. Didn't you try to fish for responses in /ic/ already?  <br>I don't see a problem, drawfags should be about the art, not bending to requester's whims.</br>  <br>But we have a board for that.</br>  Posting the collage pastebin list on request from the WWD thread.<br><br>http://pastebin.com/YrDDnzK2<br><br>Subject to change.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this?</br>  <br>heh, didn't even have to request her for her to be on her, I guess that's just how perfect my waifu is</br>  <br> sample <br> artifacts </br></br>  <br>Remove Oora</br>  <br> oora! <br>haha</br></br>  <br>I'm not entirely sure if I want to see her in there or not.</br>  <br>Do not remove Oora.</br>  <br><br>I'm not ycake so can't edit it, but I'm sure he's around the threads somewhere. Either that or he's working on requests for the WWD.</br></br>  <br><br> It can't be that bad, right </br></br>  <br>How was my waifu picked for this exactly?</br>  So, WWD is kill?  <br>No  ? </br>  <br>What, are you not down with Hulkamania?</br>  <br>If whoever made this could please remove kurome from that list, thanks.</br>  <br><br>Tried to access from phone but the catalog doesn't show the drawthread though</br></br>  <br>What are the contents for this collage?</br>  <br>Because some retarded faggot put the title in the name field.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>That's because the idiot who made it didn't put anything in the subject field, search for weekend</br>  <br><br>Ah, thanks a lot!</br></br>  <br>Nice, but I think you missed her tongue</br>  <br>So what's the practical difference between these threads and the WWD threads?</br>  <br>  There isn't really. </br>  <br>WWD has more WWE superstars.</br>  <br>WWD has become somewhat of a spectacle as desperate anons beg for deliveries and start flinging dung at everything that can hold a pencil in its hand</br>  <br> soak-a-slut <br><br> everything is complete </br></br></br>  <br>I'm mostly finished with the sketch now, <br>Is there anything I should change? <br>I'd appreciate it if someone could point out any mistakes, I'm pretty bad at noticing things like that.<br><br><br>From a drawfag perspective, WWD has more general requests, this one often has very specific ones.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WOW! thank you so much!<br>this looks great so far!<br>Can you have reimu looking up at Reco instead of looking into her shoulder like you have it?<br>Thanks!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not anymore it doesn't, janitors just cleaned fucking house.</br>  <br>Sure, I'm glad you like it so far</br>  <br>so, is a over the whole holding hands thing or are people still upset about that stuff?</br>  <br>It's an old meme anon. Holding hands is the most lewd thing imaginable.<br><br>Better handholding that watching a waifu get dicked by some other bloke.</br></br></br>  <br>Which Akari is that? ARIA?<br>If so remove her please.</br></br>  Requesting Frenda as a magical girl fending off a tentacle monster, but losing badly.<br> Or losing on purpose. </br>  Any hardcore or brutal fucking requests?

OP didn't put waifu or WWD anywhere in the entry post.</br>  <br>Remove Rias Gremory from this, please. I do not want her included because some sack of shit wants to double dip between here and the WWD with his requests, even more so because this is a stupid fetish in the first place.<br><br>Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess 4chanx searches the name field as well as the rest of the OP.</br>  <br>I didn't request in the WWD, friend. If you'd read the whole post, specifically didn't request in the WWD, I was wishing others well in their own request hunts.<br><br>Moreover, didn't we already have a whole convo about this two threads back? Even the non-dunkfags thought you were being an aspie about it trying to shoot down anyone but you requesting Rias pics for anything, dunk or not.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay good, will probably finish the linework+hatching before the threads done.</br>  <br>I haven't stepped foot into the these threads specifically and solely since I wanted to avoid you because you completely disgust me. Believe it or not, more than one person in the entire world does not like you.<br><br>Do me the personal favor and stay in here. You can request whatever stupid fetishized garbage in here and apparently nobody gives a shit, you'll even get into a collage. Thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>I love you too anon. Your single-minded devotion to filling my womb with your surging hatred makes me doki doki.</br>  <br>You want a mind-broken pregnancy edit or a holy-shit-my-brain-just-broke-from-<wbr>cumming-too-many-times face edit with a close-up impregnation window?</wbr></br>  <br>the second one</br>  <br>Oi fuck off</br>  <br> Marika not on the list </br>  <br>Marika getting pounded in the ass while being pressed against a glass window.</br>   (Cross-thread)<br/>  <br><br>If only those two could be combined...but the world is not ready.</br></br>  <br>OR here, thanks a bunch!</br>  <br>Without any other context, I might have enjoyed seeing Kaede in a dunk tank scenario (certainly not one labeled "soak-a-slut", of course). However, I don't feel comfortable knowing that people proposing the hypothetical collage and its target audience are a group that fetishizes this kind of thing.

Is there a method to getting motivated to draw? Its super fun learning different things and seeing slight improvements from nothing but the actual act of drawing leaves me horribly empty.  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1436383382250.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1436383382250<wbr>.webm</wbr></a><br> Draw what really happens, what they couldn't air.

It's kind of the feeling of: "I'm going to get better if I just keep going, so I'll just keep drawing until I finish this art notebook too."</br>  <br><br>My life is so shitty that the only refuge I can afford is drawing and masturbating to 2D girls.</br></br>  <br>You could try to pump yourself up, or set a reward for a goal.</br>  Requesting Paladin holding Fighter down and lustfully tonguing her navel, saliva dripping from her mouth and a sense of sexual pleasure on her face as Fighter squirms at her appendage probing her umbilicus.

I just guessed speculars because they are very faint now and look glassy.<br><br>I see that the eyes are in shadow which is why you made them dark but I find that eyes are a place you can ignore regular shading rules and make them lighter than they should be, especially in a more stylized style like anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>omg</br>  <br>It's foul like Nergels rot.

She can get off at your cock, despite not being the size her pussy was designed for, is able to hit her largest and most intense pleasure nerves including clit and just inside the vaginal canal and vaginal mouth.<br><br>You can bring her to orgasm with her screaming your name... then collapse together and kiss and cuddle.<br><br>You can't to that with a horse, even if she has the same parts Cerea has.

She's not the best but average. <br><br>Cerea is great, loyal and even more mature than Miia but still lacking something.<br><br>Suu is well... a jellypot with really amazing rape tendences.<br><br>Mero is... a fish.<br><br>But then, you have Rachnee, she's mature, loyal, lovely and cute. She's one of those girls who supports the MC from the shadows but she helps Darling constantly without asking anything in return, only love. <br><br>Definelly Rachnee is the best girl here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She felt Darling squeezing her titty.</br>  I heard horse pussy has some pretty crazy muscle structure that act as a super milking device each time it contracts around your cock.

She's pretty maternal, at least. She got serious when she was protecting Suu and Kii.</br>  <br>Please don't make me want to fuck a horse</br>  You know I find it amazing that a Pixiv artist managed to create such a successful series  <br>At least someone likes her, good for you</br>  <br>Fuck you Grover nobody ever loved you.</br>  <br> If she stops talking like Thor </br>  So far everything but this was shit, bad season  <br>she is a bit stupid i will not deny that, but she is also a very cheerful, happy energetic girl, i just can`t imagine her having a bad day or feeling down. some of us need a girl like that, a happy simple minded girl who lift your spirit and make you smile, as simple as that, and thats why papi is best girl</br>  <br>They all have their upsides.<br><br>I mean, fuck, if I was in Darling's position? I don't know what I'd do.</br></br></br>  <br>But Zombina feels no pain and gets shot at her job, which Lala would feel.<br> Are you trying to bully her? </br></br>    <br>Have you ever seen the contraction of a horse clitoris before Anon?<br><br>It's fucking amazing, look up a video sometime. They easily make men cum like mad almost instantaneously after a few rubbings.</br></br></br>  <br>I like her too.</br>  <br> If she stops talking like Thor </br>  <br><br>Mah nigguh.</br></br>  <br>I respect your shit taste, brah.</br>  <br>I'm a spiderfag but I can agree mia is beautiful.</br>  <br>Here you are anon, i also cropped the black lines.</br>  <br>Miia a best</br>  <br>Don't worry, it was clearly rigged, the Cereafags always do this but are a bit more subtle about it this time, whereas in the past they would do something silly like add 700 votes to Cerea in a best girl poll, look at how the poll changed within what was roughly a ten minute timespan (I had to screenshot again a few times since I accidentally overwrote clipboard data, so time changed), the votes for the other girls did not change at all, yet the votes for Miia (the ultimate enemy of Cereafags) went up 13 votes, meaning that in the time between these two screencaps, every single person who voted on the poll would have had to have voted for Miia or Mero, which is unlikely given the scale of the poll. Mero's number going up is to be expected as she is commonly considered worst girl here, and it only went up a bit. While Miia's saw a dramatic increase over time.<br><br>This would not be suspicious had every other girl's votes remained the same.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br> haremshit <br> picking one <br>conformists</br></br></br>  <br>I voted the centaur girl and she got 18 points, she wasn't even in the lead so why are you paranoid?</br>  <br> Monster Musume <br> Haremshit <br><br>The problem most people have with harems isn't the fact that the guy has several girls after his dick, it's the nigh-inescapable conventions of the genre. The beta MC, the main girl being the worst girl, the "accidents" and the girls inevitably resorting to intentional physical violence in retaliation, the shitty tsunderes.<br><br>Monster Musume doesn't really have any of that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> be scrolling through the archive of that thread <br> Everyone's bickering and arguing about the cleaning and the translating <br> a random tripfag appears out of nowhere are posts the link to the cleaned, translated version <br>I dont know man, this is archive is making me feel something, deep in my chest<br>What is it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her big rump also makes her hips have huge girth making it easy to clamp onto.<br><br>It would sort of count as huge wide hips for me.</br></br></br>  You think there's an underground bikini monster girl wrestling group?  <br>i guess that means no anal</br>  <br>Cuddling a horse doesn't work well anon, I think you misunderstand how horribly awkward a horses legs are, which just make them uncomfortable to be around in any situation. Plus Cerea is too big for a true cuddle, you would effectively only be cuddling a small part of her mass, while a huge portion of her body goes uncuddled. This is a problem shared only by Rachnee, and it isnt as bad in that case, as her body is more flexible, allowing her to get closer into a cuddle and wrap her legs around you, whereas Cerea is stuck in that awkward L shape.</br>  What did you guys think of the first episode? I was pleasantly surprised at how well done it was.  <br> every single person who voted on the poll would have had to have voted for Miia or Mero <br> the two most hated girls from the series <br> it must be a conspiracy <br>You guys are crazy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually I wonder how the government in the manga would handle multiple marriages as the law protects the culture of the girls. Lamias and Centaurs are races who are shown to have poligamy. Mero is royalty so she can do what she wants. Ranchnea don't give a damn. Papi is stupid and free spirited so she will do what she wants. and the law doesn't apply to Suu as slimes are not covered under the law (according to smith at least).</br>  People think Cerea will win Marriage bowl lawl  <br>Mi moreno</br>  <br>I doubt it, but that doesn't change the fact that horse pussy is amazing.</br>  <br>you know what the admin of here should do <br>4chan polls<br>only those with 4chan passes can vote.</br></br></br>  Discuss boats  <br>Time for shipposting?</br>  <br> boats <br>Do you want the thread to be spammed that much or are you just retarded?</br></br>  <br> boats </br>  Why doesn't anybody like Fubuki?  <br>Getting strapped with the MC position in that shitty anime didn't help with her popularity. Neither did the waifuing the director unleashed with those tweets and cringe worthy wedding scene.</br>   /ai/ - Idle Activities  as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection.
