[ I'll keep the question simple, Overlord or GATE?  Overlord  Both are shit  <br>GATE. Overlord is another SAO tryhard with bad animation and characters.</br>  <br>How much screen time does this semen demon get? Really makes or breaks if I pick this up</br>  <br> source material <br>GATE<br><br> anime adaptation <br>Overlord</br></br></br></br></br>  man, Overlord sure is slow as fuck  easily gate  <br>Both are pretty mediocre. Overlord though has superior waifus.<br><br>A-1 also fucked up character designs for Gate. Can these fuckers do anything right?</br></br></br>  GATE was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism, but the start was better than anything in Overlord (I've read the first 3 volumes).   Gate: 24 eps <br> Overlord: 13 eps <br><br>Nuff said</br></br></br>  <br>More.</br>  <br>Overlord. <br><br>GATE gets retarded with a 40 chapter drama bullshit with the Elf going crazy.</br></br></br>  <br> 3eps already fucked up for nothing </br>  <br> was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism  <br>You have no right to have this opinion if you're an Amerifat.</br></br>  <br>I'm not and I find American jingoism more tolerable because they actually have the power to back it up. Japan does not.</br>  <br>but a broken elf is best elf.</br>  <br> American jingoism more tolerable <br> says the 'murrican while pretending to be not american </br></br>  <br>The difference is that America is actually a military superpower, while Japan doesn't even have an existing army</br>  <br>Why would I lie? My point still stands. America has the most powerful military in the world whereas Japan is America's bitch.</br>  What if the only reason GATE exists is to encourage jingoism and radical nationalism in Japan among otaku?  <br>Doesn't matter. It's still fiction and you're retarded if you can tolerate the American one but not the Japanese one.</br>  <br>Only thirteen eps, so not much and the most of it will be her wearing a full suit of armor.</br>  <br>Right now, Overlord. Maybe because i read Gate and did not Overlord LNs.<br><br>Gate i am looking forward to few moments being animated, but not very hype though enjoying it. Overlord for now is fresh, and unlike Gate does not gear gore.</br></br></br>  <br>And? Just because its fiction its based on reality, which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk<br><br>It's be like watching the Lord of the Rings and the halflings conquered the world from the shire, with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it</br></br></br>  <br>What if you are a butthurt ameri/k/unt?</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Melkor. Always bet on Melkor.</br></br>  <br>tojo plz leave</br>  <br>But thats not just gate. It goes decades ago, and passes through many stages.<br><br>From "anti-war" (in reality preparing children to fact that war is hell, but they`ll have to fight to survive even if their goverment is shit) Gundams, mecha in general, Night Raid, SnK, recently AirSoft to wake interest in guns and now Gate and reairing Grave of Fireflies in prime time.<br><br>Its all part of the plan. Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. War and nationalism propaganda was its core for long time, but there are other trends too - like recently attempts to fix the birth rates by propagating marriage and milfs or shows about work to make NEETs think work is actually fun and full of waifus.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'll keep the answer simple, Overlord.  <br>The one with Albedo.  Both shows suck anyway. </br>  GATE manga &gt; Overlord anime &gt; Overlord manga &gt; GATE anime<br><br> reading light novels <br>Hahaha oh wow.</br></br></br>  <br>The only one that sucks here is  your mom .</br>  <br> &gt;Overlord manga <br>Never knew it existed, huh.</br></br>  <br> overlord manga <br><br>Not really fair, since its only 5 chapters in, you should be comparing to the light novel</br></br></br>  <br> Reading period <br>You should be ashamed.</br></br>  The one that is not a rushed one cour with original ending. Also loving these new meme about faggots pretending overshit is good  <br>GATE all the way.</br>   Overlord <br> Protagonist is supposedly Lawful Evil <br> First thing he does is Chaotic Good </br></br>  <br>Just because it isn't called an army, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</br>  <br>He didn't care about the village, but felt indebted to help them because based Touch Me rubbing off on Sebas</br>  <br> Overlord or Gate? <br><br>Which one has the better art?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better female cast?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better mc?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has a better opening or closing?<br> Overlord <br><br>That wasn't difficult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Overlord, duh.<br>The only reason why people like the GATE anime is goth loli.</br></br>  <br>Foolish anon. He is extreme evil.<br>Every act of kindness towards humans is a carefully crafted deception.</br></br>  <br><br> /a/ says it's shit <br>Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>Will ever the assburgers stop shiting threads?<br><br>Gate<br><br>I dont like edge lord MCs, and this is too much power fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not adhering to /a/core <br>Enjoy your SAO clone.</br></br>  <br> edge lord <br>Now there's that word again.</br></br>  <br><br>i will, thanks ;)</br></br>  Overlord<br>Got to give it some points for evil lich MC</br>  <br>Gate. I haven't saw the third episode of Overlord yet but nothing happen in the first two episode. Gate doesn't have pacing issue and it's really satisfying to see modern military not jobbing for once. Also it's 24 episodes instead of 12.</br>  <br>I'm with this guy. Too bad Overlord isn't two cours.</br>  Both are shit. Just watch Rokka no Yuusha  <br> not trusting the collective of /a/nons judgement <br> hownewru.jpg.tiff <br>GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation. Overlord is just a generic battle shonen with an edgy dumbass MC who gets the dick for doing nothing, not to mention it being an mmo shit.</br></br></br>  <br>What if the only reason you're acting like that is because you're actually nationalistic at heart and refuse to want to see other countries do it?</br>  <br>It's like you didn't watch anyone of it.</br>  I've watched and read both.<br><br>Gate is about a middle aged guy trying to survive in the fantasy world.<br><br>Overlord is about a middle aged guy whose age stops mattering as the story goes on since it's the NPCs who run the story not him.</br></br></br></br>  Both dropped  <br>Worry not. He will become chaotic evil in no time.</br>  <br>look as a human Ainz was a good guy, but as time goes on the Extreme Evil that was his Lich will change his out look. he already doesn't care about human life</br>  <br> Gate <br> Source material <br> Not shit <br>It's a decent premise ruined by virtue of being little more than a vehicle for the author's fringe political views.</br></br></br></br>  <br>GATE because I'm not American</br>  <br>Nah you're just as right wing as he is, Amerifat.</br>  <br> I'm actually a pretty hard left by American standards. Not quite tumblr-SJW, but far enough. </br>  <br> implying you're not american <br> implying anyone is 'Murica's bitch. <br>Invading 3rd world shit places is all America can do, aside from humanitarians no one really gives a fuck about poor people being massacred. USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country.</br></br></br>  <br> USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country. <br>Because first world countries are, by definition, America and her allies. What country in their right mind would invade an ally?</br></br>  <br> China <br> Russia </br></br>  <br>overlord<br><br>are you 13?<br><br>overlord is edgy because the mc is an overdesigned skeleton?<br><br> first world countries </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are by definition Second World countries</br>  <br>Are second world countries, which are by definition the (former now) USSR and her allies.<br><br>Dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm having a lot of fun with both.<br>Maybe GATE though because Overlord seems to be moving along at a glacial pace.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Gonna be first world before long. America's just lying to herself</br></br></br>  <br>You need to get out of that cold war mentality, brah.</br>  <br>The terms first, second and third world were created by the US during the cold war to describe the alliances.<br>They are not objective measurements of the development of a nation.</br></br>  <br>You're the one throwing around outdated terms like "first world."</br>  <br><br><br> letting someone dictate what is good and what is bad <br><br>What a bunch of retarded sheep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. </br>  Gate for action and watching military ass-rape roman armies, Overlord for being pretty interesting and wanting to see my childhood edgy online rpg fantasies come to realization.  <br>Overlord just got past the... know what? I'll make a list I guess<br><br>Overlord<br>Pros:<br>* I love the LN and like the manga<br>* Is not being censored as retardedly as GATE<br>* Is not about NIPPON STRONK<br>* Nice character designs, even if Albedo's armor bothers me<br>* Narberal Gamma (best girl)<br>Cons:<br>* The anime is being too slow by like 3 minutes each chapter. Or perhaps 3 minutes too short per chapter. It was late by 3 minutes, then 6, and now by 9. Makes me worried about ep4 being super rushed and skipping important stuff. This may or may not be valid depending on how it turns out. Maybe they will skip the intro and ED to compensate?<br><br>Not a lot of bad things, but it is stacking up on every episode. Let's see how bad it is by the end of ep4<br><br>GATE<br>Pros<br>* They improved Rori<br>* Just getting to the parts I love the most.<br>* Decent music so far. I hope for some sweet Ride of the Valkyries<br>* I liked Rerei's outfit more than the manga's<br><br>Cons<br>* Retarded censorship means they skipped the dragon attack on the elven village. We never got to see it eat elves and villagers, will probably not get to see most of the action scenes because of that<br>* Cute-ified characters. Even the fucking empeor got a facial lift-off and looks 10 years younger. Everyone looks 10 years younger- Not as bad as moeblobs, but dangerously close<br><br>Is really too soon to tell. Must wait for ep5 of each series, apparently</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are his views? I just saw it will probably have some anti-american propaganda, but that's rather common in anime.</br>  <br>Really? I like the OVERLOR LNs more than the GATE one. Unless you are thinking of the manga</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Food, alcohol, pipe-weed. Within a century of the end of Return of the King, the world will secretly be ruled from the Shire.</br></br>  <br>I liked ep3 tho, but it was still too slow.<br><br>They should have started like the manga did, with the battle at Carne, and then do a flashback explaining how they got there</br></br></br>  Gate.<br><br>Overlord really surprised me during the first two episodes and the idea is really cool. Problem is, it gets wasted as soon as the actions start.<br><br>I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil.<br>I wanted Momonga to start a fucking kingdom not<br><br> hurr durr let's be adventurers </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Animation is also a big point. Gate &gt; Overlord on that</br>  <br> which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk <br>It's not. It's just pissed off right wing Amerifats like you who can't take it, and there's a lot.</br></br>  <br>Anime, Overlord<br>Manga wise, Gate<br>shield hero anime when?</br></br></br>  <br>Everybody is evil, I mean everyfriggin body</br>  <br>That reminds me of when someone asked "if you could be reborn in this very world right now, would you rather be reborn as a guy or a girl?" and i answered "it depends on location. Western first world country? girl. Give me easy mode on life for once. Anywhere else? guy, I dont wanna get shat on" and someone said that was retarded because women were suffering on India so why did I say life in wester 1st world countries was easy for women?<br><br> India <br> Western First World Country <br><br>Since fucking when?<br><br>China and Russia are 2nd world countries, by definition. Even if China is now the world's greatest economy, it is still a 2nd world country. Look up what 2nd world country actually means, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sebas-chan isnt</br>  <br>Im gonna assume you think "1st world" means "developed"<br><br>During the cold war, the americans and their allies thought the world was divided thus:<br><br>One side was america and its allies,<br>The other was russia and its allies<br><br>Thus, you had "two separate worlds" of politics and ideologies. 1st world, just means "america and its allies" and 2nd world just means "russia and its allies" but they were all considered modern and advanced countries to live in.<br><br>You are confusing politics with economics/sociology, and seem to think 1st world means "premium quality" or something like that. Its just a geographical and political division, that's all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is too much "how it worked in the game" sequence in Overlord for my taste.<br><br>On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. Or as anything.</br></br></br>  <br> war is hell </br>  <br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br>Gate is not manga adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Both are absolute shit.<br>But Gate &gt; Overlord.<br>MMO anime is always worst in any comparison.</br></br></br>  <br> glacial pace <br>Its about four episodes per volume, if I'm lead to believe. The first volume was heavily laden with setting shit up, getting you interested in the cast and the situation, and ended on a huge note of  lich overlord killing the fuck out of angels </br></br>  <br> GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation <br>It's not. It's just an excuse to pit /k/ against fantasy for shits and giggles and that's great. Being an idiot is alright, being pretentious as well is just obnoxious.</br></br>  <br> what if the sky is blue </br>  <br>Diplomacy &gt; all, no man left behind etc, just obnoxious nazi bullshit like that<br><br>they should just nuke those filthy savage slavers. For humanitarian reasons, you know</br></br></br>  <br> I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. <br>In the new world they are in, no one would get past the first damn floor. Even back in YGGDRASIL, 1500 players and NPCs raided Nazarick and were stopped dead at the 8th floor<br>  I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil. <br>Ainz plans to do that in the second volume, he starts working as an adventurer in an attempt to create a heroic reputation, then drop the charade and give all credit to his true identity, thus spreading the name Ainz Ooal Gown far and wide. He's not looking to be an evil tyrant, he just wants to try and find other players in the new world. Also the other countries aren't evil, they have yet to be shown that way, they have some evil people inside, usually nobles and such, but the countries themselves aren't evil</br></br></br></br>   The story begins with Yggdrasil, a popular online game <br><br> however, the protagonist Momonga decides to not log out. Momonga is then transformed into the image of a skeleton as "the most powerful wizard <br><br> Even SAO tards laugh at this </br></br></br></br>  <br> Gate <br> pretentious <br>it's like you never watched or read it</br></br></br>  <br> no mention of lelei being ruined </br>  <br>Yeah, you are right, but I wasnt weighting one against the other, I was saying what I liked and disliked of each series individually. <br>If you want a "vs" point of view, let me see<br><br>Animation Gate++ (the dragon in the dirt cloud was simple but much better than the 3D stuff in OVERLORD(<br>Music Gate+<br>History Overlord++<br>Dialogue Overlord<br>Pacing Gate++<br>Character Designs Overlord+<br><br>So lets see...<br>Gate+++ total<br>Overlord++++ total<br><br>Dialogue went to overlord but by so small a margin I didnt really gave it a +<br><br>I would say overlord is slightly better than gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is not about NIPPON STRONK <br>I do not understand why do so many people get butthurt over this.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about you, not gate. Or did you think I called gate an idiot? Come on, there's gotta be a limit to how dumb you can get.</br>  Which episode does Gate start showing the waifu's?  <br>Overlord, obviously.</br>  <br>I didnt think she was ruined. I know, shocking, right? someone has a different opnion than you!<br><br>Well, Im used to having different opinions on tastes, because tastes are like assholes. Everyone has one and thinks everyone ELSE's stinks but his.<br><br>That's why I never really go to war over "my tastes &gt; your tastes" comments. Im not saying your opinion is shit, im just saying I don't care about your taste because tastes are personal.<br><br>Maybe you don't like lemon pie.<br>I fucking love lemon pie<br><br>Would I get into an argument about lemon pie's greatness? <br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Character Designs Overlord+ <br>I disagree. Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. Meanwhile the B team working on Overlord can't decide on Albedo's proper proportions it threw me off. Also, it highlighted the bad thing about directly copying LN art.</br></br>  <br>All I know is that the MC is a fucking otaku which pretty much removes any credibility it could have had from the show.<br>You can't take it seriously if the MC is constantly surrounded by girls, is an otaku and still supposed to be some kind of soldier. It doesn't work well together.</br></br>  <br>All those things you want to happen? they all happen later in the novels. All of them</br>  <br> pretending to be above arguing taste <br> after writing that diatribe about taste <br> and already saying rori was improved <br>Of fucking course I love lemon pie, and my hand's reeked every time I've scratched my ass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People naturally recognize political agendas, but they become bothered when those agendas don't line up with their preferences or the status.</br>  <br><br>noice, no way they're gonna get animated though, right?</br></br>  <br>There are many otaku in the army anon. Hop over to /k/ and see how many answer you.<br><br>It's also not being brought up as much in the series, not like he's a hikkineet bastard.</br></br></br>  <br> Preferring a bunch of uninteresting looking human people to a cast of interesting and unique looking characters rarely presented as a main cast in an anime. </br>  <br>Might progress a chapter, maybe one and a half before it's all over at this pace.</br>  <br> shield hero anime when? <br>It has slavery, so never</br></br>  <br>It's 4 episodes per volume and the 1st volume was a glorified intro.</br>  <br>did you screw up your post?</br>  <br> Preferring well-animated tasteful designs over characters who suffer from animation deficiency due to canon material accuracy <br>Let me remind you what happened to Log Horizon<br> pic related <br>She looked so much better in S1 and that's with anime designs</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gate, better pasing, better girls, it's just better overall, it's a shame seeing how every gate thread it's ruined with amerifats</br>  <br>The anime is going to end at the end of volume 3, so in these 12-13 or so episodes we'll get<br> &gt;Ainz murdering the fuck out of angels<br> Ainz and Narberal becoming adventurers along with a group of no-names <br> Ainz and Narberal breezing through adventuring, slaughtering ogres and goblins with ease <br> Ainz and Narberal vs a necromancer and a crazy chick in a graveyard full of undead, which will include Narberal vs two skeleton dragons and Papa Bones giving someone a big warm hug <br> Spooky vampire slaughterfest <br> Ainz vs Shallchair <br> Possibly a cliffhanger concerning Ainz's plan to wipe out the Lizardmen </br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  WHEN DO THE GIRLS APPEAR IN GATE!  <br> Need to repay a debt <br> Might as well test my killing spells, too <br> I could easily resurrect the half of the village that was killed, but that would just be a hassle in the future <br><br>Truly a paragon of altruism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll take shitty animation quality over dull as fuck character designs.</br>  <br>Sebajii believes there's good, don't mean he aren't gonna wreck yer shet</br>  I havent seen gate but overlord has been good.  <br> &gt;Ainz vs Shallchair <br>never gonna make it there, parts will be skipped and rushed like there's no tomorrow</br></br>  <br> The entire climax of volume 3 <br> In the fucking intro, not even just a small glimpse, but a big chunk of animation <br> Will be the climax to the anime itself <br>You are delusional if you think they'll skip or rush over it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>...<br><br><br>you real?<br><br><br>Gate is a LN adaptation, and it was cutified to death. If you read tvtropes, I would say it was spikified to death.<br><br>Gore is 97% gone<br>Mature characters? 100% gone<br>Violence? 90% gone<br><br>The problem with that is not "hurr durr not enough blood" but that by hiding some scenes completely, they had to cut out large chunks that were actually relevant to the story.<br><br>Have you seen people on youtube and their "live reaction" videos? I honestly enjoy watching those, I think they're hilarious. All my friends are into GATE manga, so I cant expect them to surprised or anything. The youtubers... they all hate reading, so they have fresh reactions, and they are all confused as fuck over a lot of things, because they were never shown or explained in the anime<br><br>Arrow on the dragon's eye? their comment was "did that elf chick shoot out its eye?"<br><br>Rori? "Oh my god she's an apostle of a dark god! she's gonna be the villain of the series! she's just luring them into a false sense of security"<br><br>Its really fun to watch, but also a little sad. The anime is doing a very poor job of telling the story because its skipping too many bits or it in order to hide its most violent parts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mate, we get to see stuff like Cocytus vs. the lizardman chiefs, I doubt we'll get to there.</br>  <br>No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing. They're falling behind at a constant pace, so they've obviously taken a big chunk out at some point.</br>  <br>We're basically in the last part of volume 1 now, the only thing left is papa Bones chokeslamming angels and we're done with vol 1, we're getting 3 volumes at this pace.</br>  <br> No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing <br>That was what volume one was made of, majorly though. The battle at the village was near the end of the volume, and didn't involve much beyond Ainz shit stomping the soldiers and angels.</br></br>  <br>Again, I said it wasn't just a glimpse. It was a whole animated part, the reason they included Cocytus vs the lizardmen was because they needed a cool scene for him to be in, and till then he didn't have any scenes in the LNs. The anime will cover till the end of volume 3, thus it will cover Shalltear vs Ainz.</br>  <br>Hey your call man.<br><br><br>I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. If you really wanted uncensored Gate then you also better want the US getting bitchslapped every which way. You can't have one without the other. Japan did this for your own good and your ungrateful ass is complaining.<br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>I agree with the other things but this is wrong. Unless you're talking about character design, which I could give fuck all about. 18 year olds looked like 30s in Space Battleship Yamato, didn't stop me from enjoying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How did he even manage to pump strength as spooky wizard? Can players grind stats after hitting the cap in Yggdrasil?</br>  <br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>lmao.<br>Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>He's level 100 while they're like level 20, he can just punch them to death due to level difference.</br>  <br>Hes at the level cap, and even spell casters in YGGDRASIL, at level cap, had substantial strength, which translates even harder when put into the new world.</br>  <br> I disagree. Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. <br>That is true, which is why I gave Gate a ++ on animation.<br><br>Its characters ARE better animated, but that is not the same as "better designs".<br><br>The character designs in GATE are just moeblob humans, while the character designs in Overlord are interesting and unique creatures, with a few jokes thrown in that most people didnt notice.<br><br>Aura and Mare being a trap and a reverse trap makes me smirk<br>Demiurge wearing a swagger-full powersuit in a medioeval world<br>Shalltear name is basically "I shall tear you apart" but people don't seem to notice.<br><br>Plus, they are all "evil guys" which you usually don't get to see as the protagonists of anything. It reminds me of playing Dungeon Keeper and thats a big plus on my book<br><br>So I really have to give Overlord the edge on character designs.<br><br>You want to say "oh but they are better ANIMATED in Gate"? I agree, but that's animation, not character designs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation. <br>Would have saved it even more if they animated soldier dialog with more kyaaaaa and naniiiiii comedic reactions. Instead we get happy soldier banter which none of our non-/k/ friends get and call it boring.</br></br>  <br>Because it breaks my suspension of disbelief too hard. And this comes from a fantasy novels author</br>  <br>Man if only character designs were animated well too.<br><br>I brought up Log Horizon by DEEN in another post which proves my point. It doesn't matter to me if the design in the adaptation has been taken artistic liberty with, all it matters to me is that it moves seamlessly.<br><br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime yet the animation might as well be stickmen in a flipbook. That's just how I roll.<br><br>I also didn't agree with dialog going to Overlord fwiw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you can't believe that japanese soldiers can't be competent and americans can be villains?<br>widen your worldview fatty</br></br>  <br>That sounds like a bullshit excuse to me anon.</br>  I feel like the two of them are completely different in themes but share a common design with the "Fantasy world" thing.<br><br>But both of them are looking like solid contenders for AOTS so far. I'll enjoy both.</br></br>  <br>3<br><br>I am saying "I like Rori" and also "but my taste is mine and yours is yours, and im not going to argue about my preferences being better than yours or yours being better than mine, because there is no such thing as better when it comes to taste"<br><br>Hell, I enjoy classic music, and still havent gotten over a punk kid going into my hobby shop, buying a manga and asking me with a straight face "aren't you ashamed of listening to fag american music?" while I was playing some Mozart on the audio system.<br><br>He enjoyed rap<br><br>I like Rori. You dont like Rori? ask me if I care<br>But I can say "I like X" and also say "I dont care enough to argue over it" in the same post<br><br>Im not arguing about if X character is better or not, btw, im arguing that, indeed, i dont argue about "my tastes are better".<br><br>You like red soda? i like green soda. Am I gonna argue about which one is superior? no<br><br> Implying green soda isnt so much better <br><br>That was a joke, btw. Im explaining that because you dont seem very fast or very good at reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime<br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br> calling Overlord an SAO clone because there was kinda sort of a MMO setting in the first act and never again <br><br>god I hate this meme</br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying it's not? Top tier aesthetics and character designs, all larger than life<br><br>The villains shtick you praise Overlord for, One Piece already did for 19 years.</br></br></br>  <br> another wall of text <br>hope you proofread it, because no one else will bother slugging through it</br></br>  <br> wall of text <br>Best be trolling.</br></br>  <br>One Piece... really? well, they're at least original, I'll give you that.<br><br>And about moving seamlessly... are you watching the RAWs? because I am, and they move fine. If you are watching it on Funimation, you should know that Funi fucked up the drame rate and Overlord looks like shit through them, and through the groups that ripped their eps from them.<br><br>Check out the episodes you saw. Do they say "Funimation" at the beginning? if so, go and watch the RAWs. They look so much better on that sense.<br><br>But the reason im giving the animation point to gate is because while watching both RAWs, I just think the 3D in overlord doesnot blend seamlessly enough with the traditional style.<br><br>The staff of Ainz Oal Gown bothers me a lot. It clearly stands out of place. The Death Knight blended in nicely, though, so maybe it was on purpose to make its power stand out? if that's the case, it was a decision I would have voted no against.<br><br>But seriously, see if the eps you watched have "funimation" at the beginning. Funi is fucking overlord, big time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hey<br><br>you<br><br>stop<br><br><br>it<br><br>every<br><br>word<br><br>doesn't need<br><br>its<br><br>own <br>line</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>All I see is "I have no arguments so now I will fling shit and hope you give up and go away"</br></br></br>  <br>You still watch Pokemon, do you?</br>  <br>Idiot confusing evil alignments with Chaotic Stupid. Evil characters are not suddenly barred from committing acts that aren't genocide.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>You did say Overlord had interesting and unique creatures which is the point of One Piece character designs. And they're also original as fuck even if you don't like it.<br><br>I do watch both RAW and Funimation. I'd still give animation to Gate.<br><br>Now, what's the reason you give dialog to Overlord as well? I didn't think it was any different to most light novels out there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, apparently we are getting up to volume 4 and those things happen from volume 5 of the light novel and onward.Maybe a 2nd season?<br><br>In b4<br> madhouse <br> 2nd season <br>jokes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad to see you fixed your enter key.</br>  <br>they already did</br>  One is about Papa Bones<br><br>The other isn't</br></br>  <br>Why not both? <br>It's not like your time is valuable anyway.</br></br>  <br> I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. <br><br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br> Gate is not manga adaptation. <br><br>Because gate IS an adaptation, and your post made it look like you did not know the LN or the manga already exist.<br><br>Someone else said "Gate failed as an adaptation"<br>You said "Gate is not an adaptation"<br><br>It comes from either the LN or the manga (I would say the LN) but either way, its an adaptation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for your own good <br>Im Chilean, I dont give a fuck if USA gets bitchslapped. In fact, I would point and laugh</br></br>  <br> anime adaptation <br> Overlord <br> The trap brown elf raping some slut will never be show in anime adaptation <br>JUST</br></br></br></br>  <br>I <br><br>dis<br><br>a <br><br>gree</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did those bastards just made a knot to her scarf? the rascals!</br>  <br>No, I said what I meant I said. Gate is not a manga adaptation. It's a light novel adaptation.<br><br>It was me telling people to stop expecting things out of the manga to be in the anime, it ain't happening.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;They improved Rori <br> Rori has cat ears <br> improved </br></br></br>  <br>Its explained in the LN that he's at level cap and he couldnt keep pumping int or spellcasting any higher, so he raised str with all his unused bonus points. <br><br>So yes, hes incredibly strong</br></br></br>  <br>They'll show a brown elf taking an adventurer clubbing.</br>  <br> you can't believe that japanese soldiers can't be competent and americans can be villains? <br>Oh I believe all of that<br><br>PS: Your shitty grammar fucked your argument. Read it over and over until you spot the problem</br></br></br></br>  <br>All skills get a couple of levels on levelup, so even a pure STR warrior will have somewhat good stack of INT and such. Rest of the power comes from the armor and the weapons that are summons and even take slice of their power from INT.</br>  <br>You clearly don't know what "wall of text" means.</br>  <br>Its all trash, but at least Overlord is mildly enjoyable</br>  <br>You are exaggerating and using hyperbole. Does that mean you ran out of real arguments?</br>   Overlord <br> GATE <br> Monster Musu me <br><br>You can't fool me, Japan<br>Stop trying to give me a monster girl fetish</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> widen your worldview fatty <br>this must have struck a chord</br></br>  <br> Stop trying to give me a monster girl fetish <br>Just accept it anon, the grass is a lot greener on this side</br></br>  <br>Your loss nigga. <br><br>Goddamn I want to fuck an elf.</br></br></br>  <br>Look at that and tell me she isn't asking for it</br>  <br>I also gave the animation to GATE. Did you pay attention? are you arguing because somehow you thought I gave animation to Overlord?<br><br>I gave designs to overlord, and animation to Gate<br><br>I gave dialogue to Overlord because I read both LNs.<br><br>I wonder if they will have "oh look these unidentified commando troops must be american because they're black. Everyone knows only americans have black people" in the Gate anime as it did on the LN and the manga. It would make me piss my pants laughing<br><br>You just cant defend the dialogue of something with a line like that. May as well try ti defend the dialogue in 50 Shades of Grey, Holy Cow!<br><br>Seriously, there's puns and subtle jokes in overlord, which you may have missed, while there's lines so retarded in gate, that thinking about them may lower your IQ by 10 points or so<br><br>I smiled at tje otaku references, but a reference is not wit, its just pandering to the masses and having them go "oh he said waifu lololololol"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rori has cat ears <br><br>Those are ribbons</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you like grass you cowfucker.</br>  <br>Ribbons that simulate catears.</br>    <br>Your loss man, cows are good.</br>  <br>I own both novel series, and like them both.<br>But I have to say Gate is a lot more entertaining in the long run, Overlord kinda lost its steam after the "lol kill all these adventurers aren't I edgy :DDDD" volume 7.<br>Gate kinda lost its steam with the Gaidens, but the last volume (not counting Gaiden +) gives us hope that season 2 will be a good read.<br><br>Anime? I can't say, I think Gate has a better start, but Overlord hasn't even gotten to the good shit yet. I'll decide once the season is over.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, alright. Your grammar just made it impossible to understand that out of your post, though.<br><br>By the way<br>  I said what I meant I said <br>makes no fucking sense either.<br><br>I'm not a grammar nazi, but at some point, you have to draw a line. When your post is impossible to understand, you clearly crossed that line. May as well have written "I climb up down to the same floor" because that doesn't has a lick of sense either</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*shrug*</br>  <br>I don't get why people get so worked up about that line. Sure it had funny delivery but it's not like it's wrong. Pretty unlikely they'd be chinese or russian special forces.</br>  <br>But I like her stocking and skirt more now than before, so to me they improved her.<br><br>Since I dont care about the ribbons, its a PLUS and a "whatever" so it comes out as a PLUS</br></br></br>  <br>what, is the whole doujin in full color?</br>  <br>Getting there but not quite. Some people are coloring it.</br>  <br>It's not that she isn't asking for it, it's that you don't plan on marrying her afterwards.</br>  About the same, but<br><br> Overlord: total sales 400k <br> Gate: total sales 2,400k <br><br>I would say Gate on the sheer fact it's more likely to keep on going and get new seasons than Overlord.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> doujin <br><br>It's not a doujin.</br></br></br>  <br>Also at the Current pace overlord would need several more seasons to cover all the content.<br><br>I'd be surprised if it gets another season, but three seasons? There's a time to keep your head in the cloud and a time to wake up.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you mad that you fucked yourself, and yet too ameriretard to spot where it happened?<br><br>Realy, until you point out where it happened, I can't take you seriously anymore because if your words make no sense, how could I possibly take you seriously?</br></br></br>  <br> I gave dialogue to Overlord because I read both LNs. <br>You fucking liar.<br><br> I wonder if they will have "oh look these unidentified commando troops must be american because they're black. Everyone knows only americans have black people" in the Gate anime as it did on the LN and the manga. It would make me piss my pants laughing <br>No, I think it just pissed you off.<br><br>That line makes sense in context since Japan only considered 3 countries to attack them which is Russia, China, and USA. Unless black people are somehow popular now in Russian and Chinese SF (not saying they're not everywhere, just that these countries aren't US level of heterogeneity) it's an acceptable if not racist conclusion.<br> You just cant defend the dialogue of something with a line like that. <br>I can? Just because your american sensibilities can't take it doesn't mean it's indefensible<br><br>Stop criticizing Gate it's clear you know shit about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Albedo vs Shalltear: Who would win?  <br>At this pacing how many episodes would be necessary to cover the entire series?<br>It's kinda crazy to imagine it even happening.</br></br>  <br>Shallchair on the virtue of her lifedraining abilities.<br><br>Albedo is all defense</br></br></br>  Web originated novel sales (M = million copies)<br>Only listing the ones that got anime adaptations. <br><br>Sword Art online 14M<br>Mahouka koukou no Rettousei 5.6M<br>Gate JSDF 2.4M<br>Log Horizon 1M<br>Overlord 0.4M<br>RE:Zero less than 0.1M</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shalltear hands down.</br>  <br>At the pacing it's going it should have had 24 eps.</br>  <br>But as a defensive character doesn't Albedo have the equivalent of rM++++ though?<br><br>Not that Shalltear is a one-trick pony or anything but if she can't gimp Albedo then I see Albedo fucking her up bigtime.</br></br></br>  <br> You fucking liar. <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/s<wbr>ag6vj0hzt67l5e/JSDF+001.odt<br><br>There you go, the GATE Light Novel. Be warned that its somewhat butchered because I was using cut to get parts to translate instead of copy for a while, without noticing.<br><br> No, I think it just pissed you off. <br>No, it made me laugh a lot. Im Chilean, not amerifat<br><br> That line makes sense in context since Japan only considered 3 countries to attack them which is Russia, China, and USA <br><br>No, if they thought only 3 countries were attacking, and one force was full of russians while the other was full of asians, the third may as well be aliens and they would still have had to arrive at the conclusion that they were americans, simply by default<br><br>Oh look, I have these three cards.

It was hilarious<br><br> american sensibilities <br>Sorry, not amerifat. It was hilarious to people from everywhere, man<br><br> know shit about it <br>I know who I am NOT going to ever give a copy of the novel I worked so hard to translate, to.

I've been searching for the web version but couldn't find it anywhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Americunts thinking Japan doesnt have a military. JSDF is actually in the top 10 militaries in the world and 2 (maby not anymore but sitll near the very top) economic power. <br>About Otaku in the military JSDF launched the while idol campaign to lure them in. It increased the number of recruits by 20%.</br></br>  <br> It increased the number of recruits by 20%. <br>I refuse to believe this. They can't be that stupid.</br></br>  <br>Well for an Otaku with no perspectives is actually a pretty comfy and secure job. I would sign up too lol.</br>  <br>No, im really sorry but like I said, I had been using cut instead of copy for a while and accidentally erased a fair bit while doing that, Im really sorry<br><br>I -may- have a virgin copy somewhere in my HD but if so, its somewhere really deep and forgotten and im much too blind to look for it, literally, sorry man<br><br>Do you have a text copy of the LN?npt a ´hysical copy. Im too blind for reading paper anymore. Need to ctrl+mousewheel to be able to read anything these days</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>iono, they get plenty of down times and the moeny aren't bad</br>  <br>Isn't America nudging Japan to have better military so they can help keep China in check? And of course China is politely threatening them to keep docile or else.</br>  <br>Gate had the absolute worst first episode I've ever seen. Stay far away.</br>  <br> machine translations <br>You're as bad as the guy who's translating Knights and Magic with shit grammar. Just stop, certain nuances will never get picked up with Bing and GT. Just wait until someone picks it up.<br> Im Chilean <br>So why are you mad over just that one line?<br> retarded analogy <br>If you fucking really read the novels, you'd know Japan expected only Russia and China.<br>They didn't expect the US and immediately stopped fighting when they realized they killed an ally.<br>The line was spur of the moment.<br>It was stupid, but it's not entirely unrealistic since people are racist.<br>How you equated that to 50 shades of unrealistic S&amp;M is beyond me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, unfortunately my collection is all physical. <br>I'm skimming through your file, and yeah, it seems completely out of order. <br><br>But I'm more amazed at how different it is... almost nothing stayed the same, the novel edition is pretty much a complete re-write. Other than the Flame Dragon encounter, everything else is completely different, might as well consider them separate books. <br><br>It's kinda fascinating to see the original, it's almost like reading a draft or storyboard of a manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> reading the web novel version <br> completely different from the published novel version, manga, and light novel <br>No the text copy of the LN is not available anywhere on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>It worked for the air force with TOP GUN</br>  <br> No the text copy of the LN is not available anywhere on the internet. <br><br>It took me 5 seconds of search to find it. <br>Anon did you even try looking<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?%20%20page=sear<wbr>ch&amp;cats=2_13&amp;filter=0&amp;term=%E3%82%B<wbr>2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%20%E8%87%AA%E8%<wbr>A1%9B%E9%9A%8A%E5%BD%BC%E3%81%AE%E5<wbr>%9C%B0%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A6%E3%80%81%E<wbr>6%96%AF%E3%81%8F%E6%88%A6%E3%81%88%<wbr>E3%82%8A</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> machine translations <br>whats wrong with checking for words here and there? its how yiou learn shit.<br><br><br> So why are you mad over just that one line? <br> Mad <br>Ive said multiple times that I am not. I think its hilarious<br><br><br> If you fucking really read the novels, you'd know Japan expected only Russia and China. <br>You just said they expected 3 countries, russia, china and america. This is a text board, I can scroll up and check your post, you cant just take back shit you said and pretend you did not say it. Sorry<br><br>And yes, the racism oozing out of it made me laugh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh sorry, "text" you say. Didn't realize you can't read moon at all.  Why would hate it? Why wish it out of existence? Best girl lives in that universe.  <br>yes</br>  Her character design was cute but she was goddamn useless both to the plot and as a fighter.  <br>what the fuck, is this actually from GT? My gut says no</br>  <br>I'm sure they'll work her into whatever comes after Super.</br>  <br> Why would hate it? Why wish it out of existence? <br><br>Not only because GT, as a series, is shit, it's because GT fanfags are the most ignorant fucks when it come to Dragon Ball fans.<br><br>That you seriously don't remember the fact that Pan was originally introduced at the end of DBZ is sad enough, but that you seriously like that abomination that is GT Pan is a testament to how shitty and cancerous GTfags are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> GT </br></br></br>  <br> GT </br>  <br>honestly it was okay, I mean the whole intergalactic space travel and new worlds and stuff was kinda cool</br>  <br>Because<br> Goku got changed into a kid again, and didn't even get into any wacky kid shenanigans like in Dragon Ball. Everyone just underestimated him all the time. <br> Power-down for Goku, where Super Saiyan 2 is irrelevant, Super Saiyan 3 is pointless, and Super Saiyan 4 is used so much it makes you wonder why he ever was a kid again to begin with. <br> Pan and Trunks being partnered with Goku, instead of a more interesting trio that would better represent GT, like Pan, Uub, and Bra. Even Vegeta and Goku in space would have been more interesting. <br> Uub just totally shits the bed. <br> Shitty characterization for Trunks, who was just some meek office guy. I understand growing out of the brat phase and not being as interesting as Future Trunks, but they could have at least made him something more than the pathetic excuse for a man he was. <br> Bad characterization for Pan, who they just made into what Videl was originally like. <br><br>To elaborate further on that last point and the Pan/Uub/Bra thing, imagine if they stopped focusing on Goku for a bit, and they made it like the Namek arc, where Pan is Gohan (newbie with a lot of potential), Uub is Krillin (experienced fighter), and Bra is Bulma (mechanical genius). They could have made Pan more like Goku or Gohan, something that makes her more positive and a potential leader in the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  GT was fantastic until they came back to earth.  <br>its from opening, you could see this scene EVERY SINGLE TIME new episode aired</br>  <br>But GT Trunks was straight up future Trunks without all the panicking and screaming.</br>  <br>At least Future Trunks had an interesting backstory.</br>  <br>I don't "hate" it, I just find it irrelevant now.<br><br>Hating anything fictional is for retards. And children.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, it's not in the opening. But it is a scene from one of the episodes.</br></br>  <br><br> Elsewhere, Pan is exploring the hospital grounds when she finds and starts playing with a young deer. She calls the deer cute, and is then shocked when the deer finds and starts sucking her breast. She is then approached by the Green Boy, who explains that the deer is sucking Pan's breasts because it thinks she is its mom. He then prepares to attack Pan when Goku and Trunks show up. They reveal that the fish was horrible tasting, and that the doctor is looking for the boy. </br></br>  Pan is my most shameful fap  Great ideas, terrible execution.  <br><br>I guess that was censurate in my country.</br></br>  <br><br> mfw all the Pan porn gives her giant disgusting cow tits when she's supposed to be glorious DFC <br><br>I hate this fanbase.</br></br></br></br>   2015 <br> Not liking Pan <br><br>GT characterisation for most of the cast was great however the execution wasn't.</br></br></br>  <br>How? She's flat as a board!</br>    <br>Post more</br>      <br><br><br>That butt is surprisingly round.</br></br></br>    <br>I no longer know what the original throwing-up-girl is.</br>    <br>3mature5me</br>  <br><br>Good ideas but bad execution. <br><br>- horrible pacing<br>- the colors don't match well<br>- sub-par animation most of the time<br>- humor was too forced</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The final saga validates it alone. It's like the anime was wrapping up the story for good. Fuck what anyone says about non-canon or whatever else, watch it and form YOUR own opinion on it. I think it could have been executed better, but otherwise, an interesting take on the series.<br><br>And you posted the wrong girl.</br></br></br>  <br> Kill off Goku &amp; Co. <br> Reset powerlevels <br><br>Then you can have a story about adventure and shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you don't mean the corrupted dragonballs arc, it was by far the worst one.</br>  <br>Not even. A way of telling off the author for introducing a dues es machina that can fix any problem that comes abroad seems like a good premise to me. All the times they used the Dragon Balls and it finally bites them back in the ass? C'mon, everyone who hated Z for this had to have liked it. It showed actual consequences and it made the Earth rely on not having to use them anymore.<br><br>Again, a nice way to close the book.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad the actual dragons and fights to purify the balls were a joke.</br>  Please read the guide before asking anything silly:<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br> tfw handegg pochaco should arrive tomorrow or friday </br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>   Chris bunny black version finally arrived <br> really want to take her out of the box and display her <br> I'm moving in five days and really need to pack my figures already </br></br>  Post your rooms.  <br>Does anyone have better picture of this design?</br>  Painted Nico soon apparently.

It's fucking weird. They don't like it. Walk up during airing day and ask for a LL ticket and tell me you couldn't feel the stares.</br></br>  <br>Are you going to a screening? Then you will realize I was right. Its going to be full of normalfags/girls. <br><br>Why would I even lie about this?</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Of my love to best live</br>  <br> Its going to be full of girls and landwhales <br>FTFY.<br><br>You're not lying, you're just ignorant. Of all anime, you believe LL is the one that's going to be more accepted. Can you imagine a jockfag/club rat or whatever else walking into a screening? Probably not. I can see him walking into a DBZ/Naruto/SnK screening though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is this any worse?</br>  So /a/ meets up and goes to love live desu?  <br>Well, believe whatever you want. I hope you have the balls to apologize in a thread after you went to a screening.</br>  <br>Why are they posing in a parking garage of all places?</br>  <br>ikr? Its the worst place for a cosplay picture. Especially for an idol cosplay.</br>  <br>Well, admittedly, I was more aloof about the fact that anime had a pretty big stigma, but highschool girls dancing is indeed worse than highschool girls fighting, even if it is in frilly dresses and with magic.<br><br><br>I would but I'm not going to the screening. Too big a pussy. We wouldn't be in the same thread anyway . Different country = different air time and different thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None of the Madoka movies went well, why would this?</br>  <br> None of the Madoka movies went well, <br>What do you mean?</br></br>  <br> Kotori's line <br>Unforgivable.</br></br>  <br>Have you seen the pictures?<br><br>Think it was the NY one but they went for dinner sometime before/after the movie. They looked fucking disgusting, especially what looked like some balding guy in his 30s wearing a wifebeater.</br></br></br>  <br>Love Live is very big in Asia because school girl dancing is more acceptable. It is a mainstream anime there.<br>Lower your headphone volume for this one.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OCb<wbr>NGeGnuM4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>How is that not going well?

The front and back look like an international letter. Most of it is just the love lives expressing their gratitude for supporting them.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-4U<wbr>MNX81fBE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>im jelous anon-san</br>  <br>Was the movie good?</br>  <br>I thought it was pretty good. Each girl gets a decent amount of screen time. They end up traveling to New York for a bit, my hometown, so I was incredibly excited (still sour about not getting the Keions). I don't want to spoil anything for anyone though.</br>  <br>Which Raibu besides Honoka got a lot of screentime?</br>  <br> I don't want to spoil anything for anyone though. <br>How long have you been here on 4chan? We literally had a thread full of spoilers(two in fact) on release day.</br></br>  <br>It was mostly even if you ask me. Hanayo obviously gets a lot of time to whine or shout out that there's a problem. Nico got a lot of time. Rin, too. Honoka is the only one who had a disproportionate amount of screen time. They know how much people love their favorite characters so they try to give every love live a chance.</br>  <br>I'm just not an asshole. Doesn't mean I'm exactly new. It's also possible that some people have managed to avoid them.</br>  <br> You failed to answer my question. <br>Dude, in the two threads I mentioned practically everyone was *asking* for spoilers. I'll even link to them if you want. And besides, from the way you posted, it appeared you were unaware of the release day threads.</br></br>  <br>I hope Umi got alot of screentime too.</br>  Just got this today. Way bigger than I expected.  <br>No, I haven't been on /a/ since I've been in Japan. I actually saw the movie on release, it's just that I haven't been home until today.<br><br> 4 years </br></br></br>  <br><br>Also, you're on 4chan. People generally don't care about being spoiled here unless they're new or frequent sites like ANN or Reddit.</br></br>  <br>Not him but you can search for spoiler on the internet.</br>  <br> Way bigger than I expected. </br>  <br> Honoka is the only one who had a disproportionate amount of screen time <br>Good thing I'm not going to bother seeing the movie then. Worst girl has already ruined it.</br></br>  <br> Rin Hanayo Honoka and Rin <br>Jeez, all my least favorites too.</br></br>  <br>Honoka is the catalyst of LL's story so no wonder she gets the most screen time.</br>  I wanted to fucking punch Honoka like 90% of the show.    <br>So about that  Akiba Dome,  I hope things turn out like the movie for the 6th Live.</br>  This place needs better bird  Postin' more bird     "Hey anon you should check out Love Live.

This thread is cancer.</br>  <br>Man I wished I have as much dollar as your projection.</br>  <br>This. Rin and Maki have the best singing voices imho. See Beat In Angel.</br>  <br>Those chicks are kinda hot (for 3D that is). Reminds me of something horrible. There was this small convention in a town in my country and there was some cosplay competition and on it's intermission there was a show where a Love Live-themed cosplay group did a few acts. I barfed due to the shittiness of the show. The choreography was totally off, the cosplay didn't match at all and 6/8 of the involved girls were MORBIDLY obese (which didn't really help to make the dancing look more graceful). Didn't they show their performance to someone before the con and the person could have told them that it was SHIT. I understand they were enjoying myself while I'm an angry dude raging on a nerd image board but the show made me angry even though I'm not even an idolfag.<br><br>I hate fat cosplay whores.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm really in love with Honk's solo voice</br>  For a hyper and cat-like girl like Rin to have the most calm voice is really surprising.  <br>You need to see good cosplay then. <br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5HArz<wbr>eDaWQY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Which Rabu Raibu has the best navel?<br>Which Rabu Raibu navel would you lick?<br>Which Rabu Raibu would lick her fellow Rabu Raibus' navels for money?</br></br>  <br> Which Rabu Raibu would lick her fellow Rabu Raibus' navels for money? <br>Kotori would lick Honkers' for free.</br></br>  Lads, I'm bored, lets talk about our favorite Mongol-slaughtering redhead.  <br>I did like the idea of settling it in an oil wrestling match between Arslan an Yurul though.</br>  <br>Where are the drawfags when you need them?</br>  <br>yurul would definitely kick arslan's ass. he was a mongolian after all</br>  Bumping for Hot Tanguts!!  <br>How'd you react when sudou spared her then?</br>  I just finished NGE and EoE for the first time.<br>What's all this about people not being able to understand it?<br>Indeed, it's fucked up TONS, but EoE does a great job explaining episodes 25 and 26. I'm pretty sure I understood most of it.<br>It lost me a little from this scene (pic related) onward, but it came back to me again.<br>Should I go watch the Rebuild now? Is it worth it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime fans are generally retarded and stupid. NGE/EoE is pretty straightforward if you use your brain, but most Anime fans aren't even capable of that apparently.<br><br> Should I go watch the Rebuild now? Is it worth it? <br>It depends on how much Evangelion means to you. If you enjoyed the original series and would prefer it untarnished and soiled, then don't watch Rebuild. <br>If you're really starved for more Eva and are that curious, then go for it at your own risk. <br>But keep your expectations low, it's nothing more than fanservice and Anno's way of funding his new studio by milking the franchise.<br><br>Also, congratulations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Watch rebuild 1 and 2. Pretend 3 never happened.  <br><br>Thank you.<br>I guess I'll go watch it. This anime has easily blown itself into my #1 favorite show of all time.<br>I'm starving for more.<br>Also, I really like Rei, I hope I'll at least get some Rei fanservice</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you like Rei, then out of your best interest I recommend you skip the Rebuilds or just don't watch 3.0. <br>Alternatively read the manga but stop about 10 chapters before the ending.<br>Rei gets relentlessly and unfairly shit on in both endings, and you're better off not acknowledging or witnessing their existences.</br></br></br>  <br>The first time I saw it, I was 8 and I didn't bother re-watching it until I was 16 or so. The reason it was "hard to understand" is because the people saying that watched it when it originally aired or when it was only a couple of years old, and weren't already in their late teens when they watched it. Because of this, things like basic existential philosophy haven't been introduced to them and they are caught up in the religious imagery. That's the entire reason. You're late to the game, have definitely already had shit spoiled for you, and have probably been educated to a high-school level which is why it's not confusing to you.<br><br>Or, alternatively, you could simply pay attention to the story and not all the extraneous shit that isn't the story, like the giant robots or weird references and allusions to slightly esoteric philosophy and theology.<br><br><br><br>Or you could not be a massive nostalgia faggot and realize it's a different story that's different on purpose and appreciate it for what it is. Just saying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Read the manga. imo it really reinforces what the ideas of the anime wanted to convey if you didnt get it. The endings different but it gives similar closure to EoE. <br><br>You could watch the series again and pickup on some of the tidbits that are hidden throughout the scenes.</br></br>  <br>What i had done wrong was that i marathoned the whole thing and after one point lost it completly</br>  <br>I marathoned the first half, the next day the second half and EoE and it was pretty good</br>  ITT: Anime that feature 2deep4you plots combined with messy plot elements<br><br>Examples for series featuring this criteria:<br><br>Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere<br>Samurai Flamenco<br>Punchline (pic related)<br>Anything by Ikuhara</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really miss him /a/<br>Like really really miss him.

How honored you feel that you are allowed to speak to them? How much they means to you?<br>You think they care?<br>You think they haven't heard it all before, by pretty girls in skimpy outfits?<br><br>Unless you have an actual topic to discuss with them, I don't see a reason to want to discuss anything with them, and if you have an actual topic that needs discussing, odds are, there's a better place to discuss it than an interview with some celebrity.<br><br>Some people are even worse. Some people feel awed when they stand on a graveyard in front of a stone with the name of somebody whose work they really dig.<br>What the fuck?<br>I got nothing. Nothing at all. I have no words to describe how silly that seems to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch that edge, son</br>  <br> Replying to a pasta </br>  <br>  He was saving anime and bringing mainstream respect to it <br>Kon's great, but mainstream respect isn't particularly important, and he was always going to be one of those "I don't like anime except for" names, anyway.</br></br>  <br> bringing mainstream respect to it. <br>That's what Miyazaki did.<br>Also, why the fuck should you bother with mainstream respect? Are you really afraid to tell people you watch chinese cartoons or something?</br></br></br>  Was he Otomo's assistant, right?  <br> mainstream respect isn't particularly important <br>It kind of is, if we want anime to remain a significant thing in the long term. Without at least some measure of mainstream respect for and acceptance of anime, no-one new becomes a fan. If no new fans come in, the fandom - and therefore market to be worth making stuff for - just grows smaller and smaller as fans either get sick of it and move on or die.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry. I'm sure kickstarter anime will save anime in his stead because they don't have to pander to shitty nip taste.</br>  <br>At least pandering to shitty jap taste gives us something different from pandering to shitty yank taste.</br>  <br><br>Oh man, I can't wait for "Under the Knot" and "Dad's Legacy".</br></br>    Get ready to  cry ;_;   <br>Are you 14?<br>Do you truly believe what you just wrote?<br>According to your reasoning, the market of antiques and generally old stuff and jewelry should have died but it's now more florid than ever.<br>Not to talk about old videogames or classical music.<br><br>Mainstream respect means nothing but more money, niche things and hobbies hardly die because of a fanbase that is extremely dedicated by nature and the few people that are into niche things usually do not stop caring until they die while most of the mainstream fanbases are fickle and stop caring for things as soon as the trends end.<br>Why do you think people like Mamoru Nagano are still in the anime industry?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> According to your reasoning, the market of antiques and generally old stuff and jewelry should have died but it's now more florid than ever. <br> Not to talk about old videogames or classical music. <br>Hard to imagine anything more mainstream than some of those examples. Antiques for instance - once you reach a certain age, new things cease to have any particular attraction, and you gain an appreciation for things that are old and well-crafted.<br><br>Jewellery? Shiny decorations are always going to be popular.<br><br>"Old" video games? It's just an extension of video games, which is about as mainstream as it's possible to be. Those who become serious gaming fans will tend to check out older games as well as playing new ones... much like how serious anime fans will watch older titles. I sure as hell wouldn't have wound up watching stuff like the original Mobile Suit Gundam and Urusei Yatsura or Aim for the Ace had I not watched something mainstream and current (at the time) such as Evangelion which drew me in to anime fandom.<br><br>Classical music? The least mainstream of your examples, but still certainly mainstream enough. Taught in school, used in movie and TV score, etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's just an extension of video games, which is about as mainstream as it's possible to be. <br><br>That's exactly why they're shit. There is no need for anime to become mainstream. That would actually bring more negative effects with it. <br>Maybe you should start thinking about the poor fucking animators instead? They do not give two fucks whether or not anime is mainstream. They'd just like to get paid and do their work. <br><br>You don't honestly believe that Kon was trying to bring anime into the mainstream right? He didn't care about that, just like any other creator. What you want is something that no one gives a fuck about, and for good reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a faggot and that was a faggot post. You should kill yourself. <br><br>But Kon is a pretty good director</br></br></br>  <br>You mentioned video games. Which means you're aware of the industry. Which means you should know how poisonous mainstream growth is.</br>  <br> doll <br> more or less means "rad" in my language </br></br>  Plebs.  <br>is it already miyazaki time again?</br>   Kon <br><br> When asked about his interest in female characters, Kon stated that female characters were easier to write because he is not able to know the character in the same way as a male character, and "can project my obsession onto the characters and expand the aspects I want to describe."[32] With a frame of reference up to Tokyo Godfathers, Susan J. Napier notes that while the theme of performance is the one obvious commonality in his works, she finds that the concept of the male gaze is the more important topic for discussion. Napier shows the evolution of Kon's use of the gaze from its restrictive and negative aspects in Magnetic Rose and Perfect Blue, to a collaborative gaze in Millennium Actress before arriving at a new type of gaze in Tokyo Godfathers which revels in uncertainty and illusion.[32] <br><br><br> meanwhile Miyazaki <br><br> Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of progressive themes, such as environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, and the absence of villains. His films are also frequently concerned with childhood transition and a marked preoccupation with flight.[j] <br><br> Miyazaki's narratives are notable for not pitting a hero against an unsympathetic antagonist. In Spirited Away, Miyazaki states "the heroine [is] thrown into a place where the good and bad dwell together. [...] She manages not because she has destroyed the 'evil', but because she has acquired the ability to survive."[53] Even though Miyazaki sometimes feels pessimistic about the world, he prefers to show children a positive world view instead, and rejects simplistic stereotypes of good and evil.[54] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   more on Miyazaki <br><br> Miyazaki's films often emphasize environmentalism and the Earth's fragility.[55] In an interview with The New Yorker, Margaret Talbot stated that Miyazaki believes much of modern culture is "thin and shallow and fake", and he "not entirely jokingly" looked forward to "a time when Tokyo is submerged by the ocean and the NTV tower becomes an island, when the human population plummets and there are no more high-rises."[56] Growing up in the Shōwa period was an unhappy time for him because "nature – the mountains and rivers – was being destroyed in the name of economic progress."[57] Miyazaki is critical of capitalism, globalization, and their impacts on modern life.[58] Commenting on the 1954 Animal Farm animated film, he has said that "exploitation is not only found in communism, capitalism is a system just like that. I believe a company is common property of the people that work there. But that is a socialistic idea."[59] Nonetheless, he suggests that adults should not "impose their vision of the world on children."[60] <br><br> Nausicaä, Princess Mononoke and Howl's Moving Castle feature anti-war themes. In 2003, when Spirited Away won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, Miyazaki did not attend the awards show personally. He later explained that it was because he "didn't want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq".[61] <br><br> Miyazaki has been called a feminist by Studio Ghibli President Toshio Suzuki, in reference to his attitude to female workers.[62] This is evident in the all-female factories of Porco Rosso and Princess Mononoke, as well as the matriarchal bath-house of Spirited Away. Many of Miyazaki's films are populated by strong female protagonists that go against gender roles common in Japanese animation and fiction.[63] </br></br></br></br></br></br>   even more on Miyazaki <br><br> For the release of his 2013 film The Wind Rises, Miyazaki and other Studio Ghibli staff members renewed criticism of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's policies, and the proposed Constitutional amendment to Article 96, a clause that stipulates procedures needed for revisions, which would allow Abe to revise Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, which outlaws war as a means to settle international disputes.[37][38][39] After the release of the film he received approval as well as negative criticism online for his anti-war message. Some online critics have labeled his film, as well as his expressed opinions, as "Anti-Japanese" and have called Miyazaki a "traitor".[40][41][42] This is due to the film's subject, a young man who designs planes during World War II. Among the planes used in the film is the Mitsubishi A5M, a predecessor of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Since he was young, Miyazaki has had a fascination with planes, in part, due to his father's line of work on A6M Zero fighter planes during the Second World War.[43] This fascination is made obvious by the recurring use of planes in his films; from Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind to Porco Rosso and beyond. This film, however, is Miyazaki's first to be inspired by a historical figure. Despite the unexpected backlash from political viewers, The Wind Rises had the biggest opening of the year in Japan, taking in 960 million yen, or $9.78 million. </br></br>   even even more on Miyazaki <br><br> Miyazaki has expressed his opinion on politics several times in the past, including a disapproval in the discussion of the revision of the Japanese constitution, and Abe's denial of Japanese World War II crimes. Part of the controversy over The Wind Rises stems from his statement that proper compensation should be given to comfort women. While some were critical of his remarks, they were welcomed by others.[40][44] This is not his only instance of controversy. In 2003, Miyazaki won an Oscar for his film Spirited Away but did not attend the 75th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles in protest of the United States' involvement in the Iraq War, later stating that "I didn't want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq." He did not publicly express this opinion at the request of his producer until 2009, when he lifted his boycott and attended the San Diego Comic Con International as a favor to his friend John Lasseter.[45] <br><br> Miyazaki also expressed his opinion about the terrorist attack at the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and gave his opinion about the magazine's decision to publish the content cited as the trigger for the incident. He said, "I think it's a mistake to caricaturize the figures venerated by another culture. You shouldn't do it." He asserts, "Instead of doing something like that, you should first make caricatures of your own country's politicians."[46][47] <br><br> In a 2014 interview, Miyazaki criticized the current state of anime, saying that the industry was catering too much to otaku (young, unemployed or minimum wage-earning men) and producing an excess of lolicon-themed shows (anime centered around female children and teenagers, often with sexual undertones). He also argued that most current anime had shallow, one-dimensional characters, saying that "Great anime and manga are produced by observing real people in action. That is not the case today because the industry is full of otaku."[48] </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> feminism, <br><br>I'm absolutely disgusted that these fucking cunts mark everything as feministic, that includes a decent female lead. In their eyes of course. It's like feminists just like to put a stamp on everything that they consider to be acceptable and then declare it to be a feministic work of art.<br><br>The fact that they make it such a special thing, is a thousand times more sexist than anything they dislike.</br></br></br></br></br>  At least we still have susumu hirasawa  <br> This is evident in the all-female factories of Porco Rosso and Princess Mononoke <br>this is just stupid. of course there are only female workers, it's both set during war times after all</br></br>  <br> someone actually went through the trouble of pressing ctrl+v to paste some shit about "male gaze" <br>why</br></br>  <br>Go back to /v/, /pol/, /r9k/, /r/mensrights, or where ever the fuck you came from.<br><br>Miyazaki is pretty fucking obviously a feminist. Get over your cognitive dissonance.<br><br><br>I think if you read the whole paragraph it tries to say that it's evident from the content of the scenes showing those factories, not the simple fact that the factories contain female workers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss his work, his work can be repeated by another guy. Get over it, nerd.</br>  <br> in reference to his attitude to female workers <br>Of course. You're a feminist if you don't act like an autistic retard during any kind of interaction with the opposing sex.</br></br>  <br>Blame Wikipedia, if you need to blame someone. That was most of the content of the Satoshi Kon article's "Themes" section.<br><br>Of course /a/ being absolutely ignorant on everything regarding feminism, you probably remain willfully ignorant on what "male gaze" means and will just deny its existence.</br></br></br>  <br> where ever the fuck you came from. <br><br>/a/ but let's ignore that for a second. Show me how he's a feminist.</br></br></br>  <br>Looking at the way most  white young males  behave on the Internet and often outside it, that actually sounds like a fairly OK definition of feminism:<br><br>"Just don't be a fucking retard when it comes to the female gender."</br></br></br>  <br> Many of Miyazaki's films are populated by strong female protagonists that go against gender roles common in Japanese animation and fiction.[63] <br><br>That's basically radical feminist ideology.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> politics, politics, and more politics <br>please go</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> politics of one of the most famous anime directors and his works, i.e. anime <br>Please stay.</br></br>  <br>I don't care. I don't want to hear it. Please fuck off.</br>  <br> niche things and hobbies hardly die because of a fanbase that is extremely dedicated by nature and the few people that are into niche things usually do not stop caring until they die <br><br>I just came from /tg/ to tell you you're retarded. We regularly have entire threads dedicated to games that have died. Everyone in the thread might love that game, but the economic cost cannot be borne by so small a community, no matter how much they love it, and new content will cease to be a thing.<br>And for those passionate niches that happen to be robust enough to remain solvent, it hampers the creativity of the producers, because all it takes is one decision that alienates a substantial subset of the fandom and suddenly they're no longer solvent. Do you have any idea how terrifying that is for creators? how stifling?<br><br>Nerds are great. They keep a fandom thriving and often drive secondary content creation which makes the fandom more enjoyable. But casuals are what make it survive.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't like what you post even though it's on-topic so fuck off! </br>  <br>Yeah, anime director. Not politician. Known and appreciated for his works. Not politics. It wouldn't be any worse if you came spamming the thread with his dietary habits.</br>  <br> I can't handle intellectual discussion <br>please go</br></br>  <br>No, this basically you making shit up. <br>Am I a feminist for writing decent female characters? Fuck no. <br><br>Miyazaki is clearly interested in the emotional representation and growing up phase of kids. It's even stated in the posts above.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really Miyazaki is just a vehicle for you to spout your retarded dogma. Why don't you fuck off to tumblr, maybe they'll appreciate your rambling there?</br>  <br> OP misses Kon <br> better copy-paste five paragraphs about Miyazaki from Wikipedia <br>Yeah, no, fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br> I think a creator's political motives with regards to their work is irrelevant <br>Do you think we should only talk about the favorite colors of anime directors, since they're just pretty swirls of color with no themes?</br></br>  <br>/a/ - politics and gossip</br>  <br>I don't see your point.</br>  <br>what's so intellectual about dumping wikipedia articles?</br>  <br>Autism</br>  Millennium Actress &gt; Perfect Blue &gt; Tokyo Godfathers &gt; Paprika &gt; Paranoia Agent  <br>That's just as well.</br>  <br> Dream Machine &gt; all </br>  <br>Better analogy: if we discussed how his dietary habits affect the anime he makes, it would be on-topic.<br><br><br> Part of the controversy over The Wind Rises stems from his statement that proper compensation should be given to comfort women. <br><br>Also please understand that environmentalism, pacifism, and absence of villains are all things that go along with radical feminism.<br> environment <br>Many radfems are very critical of environmental damaging caused by a  patriarchal  economic system that holds personal power over common health.<br> pacifism <br>War is generally male business.<br> absence of villains <br>The idea of a stark contrast between good and evil is one of the most basic tools of the  patriarchy  in brainwashing individuals. Masculine and active men are good, passive feminine blobs are good, passive feminine men are weak faggots, active and powerful women are witches.<br><br>So Miyazaki's themes and ideas go perfectly well together with radical feminism. He supports radical feminist ideals regardless of whether he explicitly identifies as one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not just any politics.

I support environmentalism because I like the nature. No war is clearly a better solution for most people, there is a good argument that can be discussed regarding technological advancements during war time but this isn't relevant in modern times.

Because you had a point. <br><br><br>Wow anon I'm sorry I didn't realize.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  so what does miyazaki's political views have to do with kon?  <br>You are a fucking retard</br>  <br>Kon was scum compared to Miyazaki.</br>  <br>something something filthy fascist go back to /pol/ if you want to talk anime we're discussing feminism here</br>  <br>I don't know, apparently we needed a lecture to show that he was more feminist than Kon.</br>  <br>so? he did good work</br>  <br><br><br><br>Samefag or what?<br>There was nothing unusual about that anons post. It made complete sense. You didn't have a relationship with kon, he was never a presence in your life for you to now miss that he's gone. You just liked the animus he made, that's it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was excessively inflammatory for what it wanted to say.</br>  <br>Why are the two men even being compared. They made completely separate works, both of which were good.</br>  <br>I guess, but this is a website where we call eachother faggots and suggest suicide to eachother constantly. Surely people have thicker skin by now.</br>  Yeah sure Miyazaki is a feminist obviously cool<br><br>What does this have to do with Kon, who also inserted strong female characters into his works?</br></br>  <br> not evaluating art solely on its political usefulness <br>wow feel free to fuck off anytime shitlord</br></br>  <br>The behavior you describe is just cancer.<br><br><br>Ask the anti-feminists who got triggered. Initially there was just a dump of everything about Miyazaki's themes, and feminism just happened to be part of it. Then someone immediately got triggered:<br><br><br>I keep telling, the "muh feminist boogeywomen" idiots are who always ruin threads. It's not feminists, however few there are on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, isn't it your responsibility not to trigger us? I'm pretty sure the onus is on you, since the sort of behavior you're engaging in is what's to blame for our trauma to begin with.</br>  <br>I would argue that most people on /a/ are feminists without realising it. Anyone who legitimately doesn't want equality between the two sexes is a retard. Feminism isn't just internet morons like anita sarkeesian. Why would it even bother you to be on equal footing with others.</br>  <br>I would argue that most people on /a/ probably don't care.</br>  <br> No, you don't. <br> You miss his work. There is a difference. <br><br>You should have stopped here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought that was tumblr mentality that you hate so much?<br><br><br> internet morons like Anita Sarkeesian <br>And now if you stopped listening to 4chin brainwashing you would also notice that even Sarkeesian is a perfectly intelligent person with valid points about video games.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. I don't care either, let women have equal rights it doesn't affect me in any way. I.e i'm probably a feminist because I don't resent women and don't particularly want to discriminate against them.</br>  <br> I thought that was tumblr mentality that you hate so much? <br>Keep assuming things about me.<br><br>Also, even if I hated it, why would that matter? If you believe a thing, you should abide by it regardless of whether the person you're talking to believes in it, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>just stop replying to it</br>  <br> If you believe a thing, you should abide by it regardless of whether the person you're talking to believes in it, right? <br>Well no, that'd be pretty close minded. If they make good points and my belief was wrong i'll change my mind like a reasonable person.</br></br>  <br> I keep telling, the "muh feminist boogeywomen" idiots are who always ruin threads. It's not feminists, however few there are on /a/. <br>There's a board for politics. This isn't it.</br></br>  <br> And now if you stopped listening to 4chin brainwashing you would also notice that even Sarkeesian is a perfectly intelligent person with valid points about video games. <br><br>Anon no, don't exaggerate your point.<br>The only thing she's right is that in videogames there are too many shitty tropes, videogamers don't care about them, but on /a/ for example people don't like them in anime.</br></br></br></br>   Is this PA's Haruhi? <br> This is what Haruhi would be if it was released now. <br> Tomari Nao=Suzumiya Haruhi. </br></br>  <br>Is Nao a bitch?</br>  I want to cum inside Nao-chan.  <br>If anything, Angel Beats is their Haruhi, not Charlotte.</br>  <br>I wish Haruhi got punched in the face though</br>  Breeding material + femlae key bro    <br>What's what people were saying about Angel Beats too.</br>  <br>I'll rip your dick off first</br>  I don't know who her voice actress is, but I'm in love with her.  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>Nao is perfect wife material.</br>    <br>That's because she actually looks like Haruhi</br>  <br>Take your glasses fanboy<br>Nagase Iore 2.0<br>Tomboy Yankee<br>Haruhi not had multiple personalities, she was not lying and not hide things.<br>She not wore multiple personalities for every occasion.<br>Naofag are already pasando the limits with their delirium and hallucinations.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>  Is this PA's Iore? <br>  This is what Nagase Iore would be if it was released now. <br>  Tomari Nao=Nagase Iore. <br><br><br>Harushi always acted with his true personality.<br>She never hid behind multiple personality.<br><br>Nao Tomori = Nagase Iore 2.0</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>is the bitch that did this man's voice in Ova.<br>Haruto Kirishima</br></br>  <br>She voiced Cocoa and the useless inspector from Psycho Pass</br>  <br><br>I want to remind naofag, that the Japanese hate Tomori<br>for them is a woman Yankee, annoying and violent.<br>Japanese consider disrespectful eat on the bus and lack of education.<br><br>友利が何か性格悪いな<br><br>だがこのアニメに出てくる主要な女の子って妹以外は暴力自慢キャラなんだよ<wbr>な・・・<br>ソコが残念だわ、女の子が暴力行為を自慢できるキャラ設定ってありきたりだ<wbr>し、ナンだか新鮮味がないわ <br><br> 暴力はナレたけど口悪い女はいただけない</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this show sucks so far. the comic relief is consistently terrible. the ep3 drama was a slog to get through. <br><br>general rule is that if you're trying to have a heavy drama scene for a character i've met for the very first time 10 minutes prior, i am going to struggle to give any fucks. you would figure an anime original would not have a pacing issue like that.</br></br>  <br> Haruhi <br>you make use of drugs or narcotics.</br></br>  Tomori looks like a cartoon character Scooby Doo  <br> Gives you 8 episodes to care about a character before her drama begins <br> Forced drama hurr durr played with my feelings  <br> Gives you 10 minutes to care about a character before her drama begins <br> pacing hurr don't care about her <br>Jun can't catch a break with you faggots can't he?<br><br>Mods please re ban this fucker.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Angel Beats was nothing like huruhi.

She has no friends at school (as stated by megane-kun in <br>ep1), along with her tragic backstory she's almost ready to completely break as a person.<br><br> →<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128417643#p128431043">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Well that's a fucking dedication, man. I'll call you again if the poster came to this thread, translator /a/non.</br>  Weird. I thought I would miss Yuu's ex after she was written off, but seems now I like Nao more. She's just too cute to resist.  Tomoko deserves friends and love just like you.<br><br>Why is Japan so mean?</br></br>  She brought it onto herself  Rotten garbage deserves no compassion  <br>a massively thick throbbing monster cock in a daily basis is another story though</br>  <br><br>Well Anime is fantasy where everything is cute and beatiful, but in real life Tomoko would be very ugly and you all would hate her.</br></br>  <br>It is her own fault.</br>  poor girl, fuck society  <br> Why is Japan so mean? <br>At least nobody is bullying her.</br></br>  <br>A good dicking is something we all need really.</br>  <br>I don't</br>  <br> just like you <br>Sorry, but I don't have any friends</br></br>  <br>You do, you just don't realize it.</br>  <br> friends and love just like you </br>  <br><br>I'm your friend</br></br>  <br> Tomoko deserves friends and love just like you <br> implying I have   or deserve  any of these</br></br>  <br> /a/ is my friend </br>  i have hundreds of friends on my 14 year old girl alter ego's kik account<br> and only one in real life </br>  <br>It's her fault</br>   watashit   <br>Holy shit fuck off</br>  <br>you only realize you need it once you get it</br>  If she were real she would've suicided due to cyberbullying and the whole town would be crying for new laws to protect poor, unfortunate, innocent girls like her. <br>In reality though, she's a terrible bitch.</br>  <br>Everyone deserves love and friendship</br>  <br>it's entertainment man</br>  <br>Japan isn't suburban America. The PTA cares more about getting the blood and sex out of Jump than eliminating bullying. <br><br>Suicide? Can't he helped</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently she used to be bullied in middle school.</br>  <br>I don't think that's true</br>  <br>Even Hitler?</br>  <br>I've checked and I'm fairly certain I'm unlovable.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>You guys really need a hug</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But do we deserve a hug?</br>  <br>I-I don't know if I deserve one.</br>  <br>I'd hug you anyway if you would watch Pretty Cure with me.</br>  <br>pls no  I didn't had hugs for years </br>  <br>I don't remember how to receive hugs.<br>What are you supposed to do with your arms?</br></br>  <br> What are you supposed to do with your arms? <br>Something to do down there? What you usually do?</br></br>  <br> implying ww2 would have happened if Hitler had friends </br>  what the fuck is this thread  <br>Too close to home, anon.</br>  <br>Well when someone hugs me they trap my arms with theirs so I can't do a thing.<br>I usually just start pushing them away since I don't like being touched.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off. We need our weekly allowance of self-pitying.</br>  <br>Not her, she shits on people that are nice to her or try to help her. It's her fault she gets no love.</br>  <br>The most I surprised about is that I never even felt suicidal for once. Maybe I just really don't want any love and shit</br>  <br><br> :'( </br></br>  <br>I would befriend and love Tomoko</br>  <br> I never even felt suicidal for once <br>Neither did I, but I guess I just like to be alive. Shit still hurts, though.</br></br>  <br>no, you wouldnt.<br>she reeks.</br></br>  I would bully tomoko  <br>I'd just have to help her take a bath then.</br>  History repeats itself  <br>Nothing new here.</br>  <br>wouldn't be surprised if the creators wholesale copied it.<br><br>it was kinda Gainax's thing so it could be passed down to trigger.</br></br></br>  Imaishi is a hack, regardless of whether KLK rips off something else or not.<br><br>The show is just underage garbage just like TTGL.</br></br>  It's intentional, both EDs are taken from other series. <br>Pic related for ED1 and ED2 is from Urusei Yatsura e.g. the cast flowing through the stars:<br>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>041ge_klk-ed2_tech <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=b2J<wbr>iic05C0M</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Kill la Kill is shite but it isn't plagiarism, series is straight up full of homages for things the creators loved. It's not like, say, Mass Effect 3 literally copying Deus Ex in its production notes and fucking it up entirely because that is ten times worse.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> Kill la Kill is shite <br>Why hyperbolize things as such?</br></br>  Would you /a/?  <br>Female centaurs, like Cerea?</br>  <br>You'll get Cerea.</br>  <br>We're capable of eating many different types of food, but meat is still the primary food source.</br>  <br>Kangaroos are weirder. They have 3 vaginas. They can keep a fetus in suspended animation in each vagina, until they're ready to be born.</br>  <br> actually believing the human race eats more meat than grain/rice/wheat etc. <br>what an ignorant fag you are</br></br>  Has there ever been an anime adaptation that butchered the source material's cast worse than the Tsukihime anime did?<br><br>Kohaku: Basically Kohaku if she were never energetic, playful, intellectual, batshit, or anything else that makes Kohaku awesome (AKA generic well mannered meido; at least they didn't give her a manface)<br><br>Akiha: vague satellite character up until the last few episodes; still lacks her charm<br><br>Ciel: Does some shit that makes her VN self seem restrained (in particular, when she almost put a black key through Shiki's head in the early episodes)<br><br>Hisui and Sacchin seem pretty much consistently in-character, but Hisui gets minimal screentime and Sacchin never gets drawn into the combat and therefor never gets to be badass.<br><br>This is what happens when you try to strip a quirky cast of its quirkiness in order to try to make a story seem more grimdark.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what? why? we love CP</br>  <br>Chaos;Head.<br><br>Umineko was pretty bad too but not worse than Tsukihime.</br></br></br>  <br>You might want to reword that.</br>    <br>Mods are asleep.<br>Post CP.</br></br>  Reminder that the author's previous work featured a morally bankrupt, non virgin, traitorous main heroine.  <br>No point killing him this early in the game.<br><br>Her planl is to kill half the heroes without dirtying her hands.</br></br></br>    <br>Believe it</br>  <br>Can the strongest man in the world beat accelerator?</br>  The pacing is shit. Nothing interesting happens, fights are boring. No intrigue and anything to hook viewer at all.<br><br>The only thing that keeps the show from dropping are all the spoilers posted, so one still waits "when the interesting stuff actually begins?".<br><br>Considering its only one cour, with current pacing likely never.</br></br></br></br>  Episode 3 airs in 3 hours and still no thread? Sasuga /a/.<br>Who's ready for the best  and only  shoujo this season?</br>  This reminds me a bit of IT'S A TENDER RAIN with some Atelier mixed in, it's pretty enjoyable even if it's slow. I'm feeling really lazy this season but I think I'll watch it to the end.<br>I'll try catching the thread earlier next episode.</br>  <br>Judging by her performance on Gangsta and Nanoha Vivid, I'd say Hayami sounds more like Noto than the real Noto at this point.</br>  <br>There are occasional action scenes, but it's usually not about that. Nobody wants to attack the prince, his regular bodyguards and the pet ninja who outclasses all of them. The second cour will have a bit more because of a longish story arc with a few fight scenes in it.</br>  is it just me, or does this not feel like a Bones show?<br>Granted, I didn't watch Chaika(which I surprisingly found out, was in fact a Bones production as well), but this just doesn't feel like anything they would produce.<br><br>Neither good nor bad, just, there's a certain je ne sais quoi missing.<br>Maybe it needs more time, but the soundtrack thus far has been unnoticable for me(of which I'm very keen to notice tracks because it's one of the few things Bones does right).<br>And while it certainly is a good looking anime, I've been underwhelmed, or more, maybe the source material has left much to be desired in terms of dynamic animation that Bones makes a living off of.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you're just not into shoujo.<br><br>The soundtracks have been very beautiful so far it gives shoujo vibes</br></br></br></blockquote>]
