[ Read the guide before asking questions buyfag.moe  bump because principles and /a/ being full on gay    I'm actually glad most of the announcements have been boring.<br>Closed wallet season won't hurt.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Holy shit have I been broke past couple of weeks.</br></br></br>  The thing that got me hyped was the sakamoto figma. <br><br> I don't even like jointshit too </br></br>  Another bump because fuck fatties.  ded thred<br>ded wonfes</br>  <br>I dunno I'm pretty hype on account of GSC</br>  I don't understand why people post in Pochaco threads. It's like they see the "Buyfag thread" and the link to the guide and think "Oh, this must be the buyfag thread', and completely ignore the fact that it's a fucking Pochaco thread. Does /a/ even have any mods, how do those threads not get banned instantly?  Did they show off Celty's figma?  <br> Believe in Vomit Dog </br>  <br>Nope. Just the announcement picture.</br>  Mako nendoroid up on the GSC online shop.  Anyone have a picture of the GSC wall of figs, just woke up and missed everything else.    <br>http://whl4u.jp/wh22/exhibit/galler<wbr>y/</wbr></br>  <br><br> Nendoroid Hotaru and Nendoroid Yui. </br></br>    No new Rin figure? <br><br>Obviously they'd make a Saber one, but I really expected some new Rin stuff after UBW</br></br>  Stupid sexy Ricchan.  <br>So much meh. Should have made that a proper flexible cape somehow.</br>  <br>Okay then... I might buy my first figma.<br> fuck </br></br>      I'm not that into figurines and stuff but I saw this one... so beautiful.  <br>That's all kinda self explanatory then.</br>  <br> worst saenai <br> beautiful <br>Anon I got news for you.</br></br></br>  <br>Did mfc compile a list yet</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>At least it does not have a shitty face like the one you posted.</br>  Feria 【フェリア】 from Comet Lucifer 『コメット・ルシファー』.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/P57C-Io44dA  [ ]</br></br>  I'm glad I waited.  <br><br/></br>  Say something GSC  <br>the PV isn't telling me anything, but it sure looks pretty</br>  <br>Right, because having 1 figma and around 50 ordinary anime figures makes me a /tv/isionist.</br>  <br>She keeps getting stuff of her in alternative outfits, its really annoying. Is it just too much to ask for a scale in her regular clothes?</br>  <br>the part of your brain responsible for figmas goes there. the rest can stay .</br>  <br>I get the art style and all but this shit just looks lazy as fuck.</br>  <br>I'd rather get a lobotomy to remove that part.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>331765</wbr>  <br>I'm reserving judgement until I see the final product. If he looks like that when he's up for order I can't see him being over 3k, which would be something.</br>  <br>as you wish, onii-chan.</br>  I didn't have a lot of faith in this but it looks pretty good.  he better come with 4 arms and legs  <br>Everything else is good but the tiddy just looks so bad.</br>  <br><br>Myhipsaremovingontheirown</br></br>  <br>They look like two beach balls stapled to her chest.</br>  <br>R;N is dead and buried.</br>  <br> voiced by hashi <br>Will watch.</br></br>  Should have known GSC is gonna milk it dry  Time to take a nap before Wonfest 2nd broadcast happens. The figure talk portion.   no pochaco nendo <br><br>You had ONE JOB, GSC.</br></br>  What's wrong with  FREEing ?  <br>No one would buy a 12,000 jpy nendo of some hambeast</br>  <br> looking at her face <br>Are you gay? Serious question.</br></br>  <br> a ball with 4 other balls attached to it to represent tits and ass <br>Wow, it's fucking nothing  just like every porkchaco. </br></br>  <br> someone cares about something other than butts and boobies <br> they must be gay <br>When will this meme end?</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing if their bunny line is concerned, otherwise a little pricey. They're okay overall</br>  <br>When everyone in society is gay. So, pretty soon, maybe.</br>  <br>I'm fine with that instead of continuing it by beating a dead horse like S;G 0.</br>  <br>Their paintjobs are pretty flawed. I don't own any of their figures yet, but this WonFes made them my heroes. Three must-buys.</br>  <br> Nozomi's tail <br>errytime lmao</br></br>  <br>I see. Well, that's fine, no price whatsoever will keep me from my waifu,  not even fabric clothing. <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287872<br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287880</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I think you may be confused with figma R Ichirou.</br>  I see no one posted OSs Tsukiumi.  <br>No, he's not.</br>  <br>Looks shit.</br>  <br>Oh my, I missed him. This is nice too. But it's not a figma. It's by UC, so is it even an action figure?</br>  <br>That fedora.</br>  <br>He won't look like that once he's out. They have a bad record with realistic faces. But at least he comes with a helmet.</br>  <br>Vulcanlog is Union Creative's poseable line apparently.</br>  <br>I imagine that most people who buy him are just going to use the body for headswaps.</br>   summer wonfes 2015 <br>If you don't love boatshit, swordshit or idolshit, you're fucked.</br>  Next DickFes, right?  <br>This, at least we don't have shit taste brah</br>  <br><br>Cry more. The tears, they are delicious.</br></br>  <br><br>Satori and Koishi made it worth it.</br></br>  <br> summer wonfes 2015 <br>You mean every wonfes since 2013.</br></br>  <br>I see. I remember seeing an image for half of the Vulcanlog stuff, was wondering what that was. Not sure where UC is getting the money for these licenses when their figures look meh, but I'm glad they've been trying.</br>  <br>Congrats, you're at least the tenth person to post this exact comment.</br>  Shitfes.   nervousness intensifies   <br>Waiting for preorder, I've been into her since they shown the sculpt. Also getting , already preordered.<br><br>Jesus fuck, I'm afraid of the moment all those announcements hit preorders, it will be bad for my mental health. Already have 7 scales till the end of 2015 with average of 18kY per month each month. This is hell.</br></br></br>  Anyone got a good picture of the wall?  <br> you're fucked <br>At least my wallet is safe from Japan's horrid taste.</br></br>  <br>Well, Union Creative owns Revoltech and Kaiyodo, so they've got experience with poseables. I think Vulcanlog was originally made for Monster Hunter poseables, but they saw the profit figma was bringing in and widened their options.</br>  <br>Yeah, but I can't blame them, I don't barely watch anime anymore. The only figure I cared for this entire wonfes is a damn nendoroid.</br>  <br> no new chitoge <br><br>FUCK</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off back to twitter and tumblr</br>  <br>I know, right, not a single Giganigga announced. Fucking anime killed all chances of getting more.</br>  <br>There were some figures that got me mildly interested. but nothing exciting.</br>  <br>It';s the anime that made them release it in the first place.</br>  <br>Not like you need, she has dozens. <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/searc<wbr>h.php?character_strict=1&amp;character_<wbr>id=42743</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, cry more.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, man, we could be getting more of those top-notch sins, pochaco and sonico figures, amirite?</br>  What are you going to spend your money on instead of figures since there was nothing good at Wonfes?  <br>Wow, then they're banking. I had thought Kaiyodo was the owner of Revoltech and owned themselves.</br>   not a single Shit la Shit figure <br>Damn, it sure feels good being right.</br>  <br>Books and their buttrape ship rates just like every year.</br>  <br> You had ONE JOB, GSC. <br>Yeah, their job is not to make nendos out of shity characters</br></br>  <br>Well, Kaiyodo technically owns Revoltech, but Union Creative owns Kaiyodo and is putting them to work on their new Vulcanlog line.</br>  How are you guys keeping up on Wonfes news? I was out for the last two days and wanna catch up on what's new.  <br>Guess I'm finally going to save up for a scalped Mark Sein</br>  <br> liking Shitoge <br>She has enough figures already faggot. If there were to be any more nisekoi shit i'd want Marika but the whole series would be better off just dying at this point.</br></br>  <br>Browse through all the threads. Check MFC for your favorite tags. Done.</br>  <br>Companies really fucked up with the anime related content, mainly because of idolshit. The only things I'm interested are fucking /v/ and /co/ related.</br>  <br>I just wanted a prototype this wonfes.</br>  <br><br><br> S2 just ended  <br> No Onodera figures  <br>Always Winter WonFes, right guys?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Right about what? Even fans didn't expect any new figures this wonfes.</br>  <br> mainly because of idolshit <br>Was there really that much? There was way more boatshit  and I'm immensely sad I can't really afford them all. </br></br>  Is this a joke?<br><br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287732</wbr></br></br>  <br>My dick.</br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/<wbr>22995<br>Lurk more next time friend</br></wbr></br>  <br>It wasn't that different from past wonfeses, lots of announcements, maybe a few things that I will actually order. I was hoping to see Purple Heart's prototype the most this wonfes but a Sento scale by Alter is more than enough for me.</br>  <br>https://twitter.com/BadDragonNews/s<wbr>tatus/623669293847162880</wbr></br>  The love is alive and well.  I'm on the Shinkansen. <br><br>So, my report on this WonFes.<br><br>- Boatsluts everywhere<br>- That new tanned submarine loli got the spotlight<br>- Literally no Touhous. I have a sad<br>- More monster stands compared to last winter<br>- More generic figures selling stands compared to last winter<br>- Griffon only had a stand about Jurassic Park (?)<br>- Not many figures that were also being shown last winter<br>- Practically no Gakkou Gurashi besides 1 unpainted figure<br>- There was a Gakkou Gurashi show at 1:30 pm but I missed it ;_;<br>- Lots of Fate as usual</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh damn, I've actually been thinking about buying them</br>  <br><br>thx</br></br>  <br> hating chitoge <br><br>DUDE</br></br></br>  <br>They should at least give us rainbowslut</br>  <br><br>  - Literally no Touhous. I have a sad <br><br>I thought they got nendos?</br></br></br></br>  Somewhat relevant, but<br>Should I sculpt my own figure digitally then print it<br>Or get whatever material they use to sculpt and do it traditionally<br><br>What material is it even</br></br></br></br>  <br>He musn't have seen them.</br>  Did griffon not announce anything? I thought they had a booth there?  <br>I looked through the list on MFC and idols took up the entirety of two companies announcements. I didn't even notice many boats or Saber. I've been going through everything on my phone, though, so I could have easily spaced them out.</br>  <br><br>Spotted a couple of nendos. Still too few</br></br>  <br> thx <br>Motherfuck.</br></br>  <br>Actually the only must-buy for me is none of those, so I'm pretty content.</br>  Weak wonfes for me, but my wallet can rets easy for a whi-<br><br> 20K~ish Erza <br>FUCK</br></br></br>   waiting for Saitama figure <br> the first ones are both jointshit <br> anime will probably be shit so minimum figures will be made <br>Life is injustice.

No San?</br>  <br>The new Erza from X-Plus is great news, but what the fuck GSC, are you ever going to tell us what happened to your planned Erza?</br>  Quick preview. A pic of a pic   letting kotobukiya have hotarumaru <br>why did you let them do this GSC</br>  <br>Who are those in the back row?</br>  Base bodies for FAGs?  <br>I love idols but I didn't see anything worth getting at all.</br>  MAI WAIFU  So they did two Nicos in the same pose.  <br><br>That's a present I want to unwrap.</br></br>  <br>Maybe I'll finally buy Kino</br>   Pirate Sento <br> Ludger <br> That cute as fuck Kirby <br><br>Even though a lot of this was boats and Love Live, I'm pretty okay with the other stuff they showed. That Ramlethal was also cool as fuck, but she's a GG character I don't care too much about.</br></br></br></br>  Hard mode: No reposts.

I want to get into it and I wish there was an anime because the VN is too dated for me.  <br>An anime about me and how I am awesome and have super powers and everyone loves me and I'm not dying alone and unloved without a soul who cares for me.</br>  <br>If I were to make an anime, I'm going to make it about Oreos. The main character is going to be a highschool student obsessed with Oreos. He has an addiction to these delicious cookies. The main love interest is a Tsundere girl that takes away his Oreos to help him, while the rival is a Yandere girl that gives him free Oreos. The two girls fight each other arguing what's best for the main character. The Tsundere girl wants to help curb his addiction, seeing it as too much. The Yandere girl believes he's entitled to do what he enjoys, and nobody should tell him any different.<br><br>His addiction eventually consumes him and soon others want him to stop. The only person that doesn't is the Yandere girl. He will secretly hide Oreos from his family and eat them when nobody is around. He spends a lot of money on the Oreos and this causes strife between himself and his friends. He would rather eat Oreos than be with them.<br><br>Eventually action takes place. Almost everyone hides his Oreos. He struggles to quit the Oreos, due to the nice Yandere girl, as she provides him Oreors as another source. The Tsundere girl finds out about the Oreos from the Yandere and gets insanely jealous. She decides to dress up as an Oreo and cover herself with cream.<br><br>The boy then falls in love with the Tsundere girl. Not to be outdo, the Yandere girl also covers herself in cream.<br><br>This is the main character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Cute girls playing pen-and-paper RPGs.  <br>Dragon Ball prequel about a young Master Roshi.</br>  Sword Art Online<br><br>Beating everyone to it right here and fucking now.</br></br>  <br>Nadia remake.</br>  <br>An Oreimo anime that actually follows the source.</br>  <br> My High-School Crush Wants To Kill Me, But I Only Witnessed Her Assasinating A Famous Mobster?! <br><br>Getting caught by a mob boss, the MC is about to be killed, however after a few shots all he sees is a beautiful girl with long blue hair and a desert eagle approach him and aim the gun at him. A voice in her earpiece urges her to kill him, leaving no witnesses. However, she is unable to bring herself to shoot, and has to escape before she is found.<br><br>The next day at school, a beautiful transfer student appears at MC's class. Cornering our hero after school, she points her gun at him claiming that "yesterday was a mistake", and "it won't happen again". However before she could execute her threats, the boy's childhood friend appears, revealing that she is an agent of Japan's Special Forces and that the other girl is a British spy, which she was sent to eliminate.<br><br>The MC lives through wacky school adventures with the two girls closely escorting the guy wherever he goes, going on cover-up dates, doing club activities, school festival events, etc. The British agent slowly falls in love with our hero and becomes increasingly tsundere.<br><br>The MC's loli half-American half-Japanese loli step-sister becomes increasingly suspicious/jealous of their relationship, and it is revealed that she too is a spy, activated by the US to dispatch the other two girls. <br><br>Cue cute girls aiming various weapons at each other, holding the MC at knifepoint, threatening MC with guns in public and gradually falling for him more and more.

They have cute girls doing every other NEET hobby, now they just need cute girls rolling dice.</br>  <br>As a teenager, a girl falls in love with a boy who runs with a bad crowd. He does stupid things, but to her, he's perfect - they're absolutely in love, the both of them, head over heels.<br><br>Then he does something really stupid and gets arrested and goes to jail for a long time. The girl doesn't tell him she's gotten pregnant by him, because she doesn't want him to hurt for knowing it.<br><br>The girl becomes a woman, and her daughter grows. Seventeen years later, the boy, now a man, is released from prison. They arrange to meet, because that love has lasted, and because the woman feels so terribly guilty about all the things she never told him.<br><br>He goes to visit the girl - because she's still that girl, in his mind. At her home, the daughter answers the door, as the mother is still out on errands. The daughter is the spitting image of her mother, seventeen years earlier - so perfect that the man looks at her and thinks it's *her*.<br><br>He kisses her, and seventeen years of repressed lust and love come through in the kiss. She's never had sex before - barely even kissed anyone, she's a shy, bookish lass - and as his hands run up her chest and thighs she climaxes right there pressed up against the doorframe.<br><br>She's too shocked at first to protest, and then too dazed by the post-orgasmic glow, and he continues, and she orgasms over and over at his ministrations, and they fuck against the couch, and the kitchen counter, and up against the wall, and finally on her mother's bed, over and over, until the both of them are exhausted and fall asleep cuddled together.<br><br>Then the mother gets home.<br><br> The extra-kinky version would be if the mother doesn't look all that older than her daughter (either from particularly good genetics, or something /tg/-esque like magic or being an elf), and so she and her daughter end up both in the role of 'his girls'. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Betamoto Fagazaki is your ordinary high school boy who just wants to live normal high school life. That means he has no hobbies and no interest in anything, especially girls. He just wants to go to school, listen to teacher, go home, study and sleep. <br> But one day while he is coming back from school a girl falls from the sky on top of our poor, ordinary Betamoto. First she slaps him but then immediately falls in love with him because he asked if she needs help because this is really one special trait, being polite. <br> Betamoto brings girl home and childhood friend (who spends a lot of time in Betamoto house, wakes him up and makes him meals because his parents are working overseas and left their teenage son to live alone) and Betamoto's imouto get jelly in a second. But never mind that, the special girl, childhood friend and imouto despite their big jealousy towards each other still act very friendly and grope each other's boobs when they go to the hot springs. <br> During the next few episodes the class tsundere, the student council president and the tomboy also start to become interested in Betamoto and when asked why they reply: "He is kind." <br> The series end by Betamoto being beta and choosing no one. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No aliens, no transforming mech planes. <br>You say that as though those things would make Ace Combat any weirder than it already is.</br></br>  <br>Is this the new skateboarding lolis?</br>  Just replace every character with a loli.

She only has one friend - a male classmate who on the other hand is secretely in love with her. Her upperclassman is the exact opposite of her, she's beautiful, acts pretty arrogant and almost every boy in school wants her as his gf. Since she knows she's very likely to never get her she doesn't intend to actually approach her, but suffers from her desire every day. One day another mysterious, beautiful girl is transferred to her class, however unlike her love interest she's very kind and she befriends her, however it also happens that she befriends MCs love interest. Now MCs love interest falls in love with MCs new female friend. Now said upperclassman approaches MC and asks her to mediate between her friend and her since she has fallen in love with her friend. MC is so shocked that she agrees. So with this the four start to do stuff together and thus MC and her love interest get to know each other better. Love interest still acts kinda arrogant but it turns out she's not such a bad person. MC suffers all the time from her dilemma of loving her senpai but also having promised to bring her together with her friend. One day her friend asks her why she seems so down lately, and she tells her everything. Now her friend says that she never loved that senpai anyway and that she will help MC get together with her. From here on we get SoL mixed with drama between the girls. In this time, MC slowly starts to realize how nice and good looking her female friend is and starts to fall in love with her instead, without really noticing.  <br> Meguru <br>If we could get an Endo anime, I'd rather they give us Eden.</br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>If you change Oreos for something less crazy you have a decent but generic romcom.</br>  <br>Would watch, great concept that doesn't include shitty tropes.</br>  <br>The Oreos are a thin metaphor for drugs, most romcoms don't roll that way.

The remaining boys who are unaffected by the spells are scared shitless and slowly give in to paranoia. MC doesn't give two fucks since she's raking in money. She sits back and enjoy the chaos of girls dominating guys in her school. <br><br>Unfortunately, a sneaky boy attempts to steal a bottle of her love potion at her house but in an attempt to escape, he slipped and spilled the potion all over himself. Now he becomes lovestruck towards MC and tries to woo her everyday, acting like boys in K dramas to get her attention. And she accepts, he thus becomes MC's familiar and they both go on magical adventures in alternate mystical realms while evading the Inquisition which clamps down on magicians who use spells to manipulate and control the minds of others. <br><br>Over the course of the series, the boy slowly becomes aware that his "love" for MC is merely a mere effect of a drug rather than real. Not wanting to disappoint MC, he keeps the ruse up while she slowly falls for him. Eventually, the boy had no choice but to spill the beans on his real feelings as MC confesses to him. Angered by his rejection, MC force feed him more of her love potion, turning him into a love slave once more. This would go on for several times until the boy becomes desensitized to the potion that he turns against MC out of anger and fear, using the knowledge of the arcane arts she taught him and eventually overpowering her. Feeling lustful, he also rapes the MC before killing himself out of guilt and insanity from the constant barrage of MC's love potions that messed up his psyche.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mad scientist gets transported to a magical fantasy world by an experiment gone wrong.<br><br>After seeing the way the people are being treated cruelly by the kingdom, he now sets out to create a tech/magic empire through use of his knowledge of his old world as well as the help of a magic princess who is being hunted down by the kingdom due to her brothers</br></br></br>  <br>Samurai Flamenco Season 2</br>  <br>I need this.

Because he has the knowledge of a middle-aged man, by the age of two, he has already become a magical prodigy and possesses power unthinkable for anyone his age and even older.

If you like oppai, then it's likely your human object might have giant breasts.<br><br>How the object is chosen is completely random. It could be the priceless family heirloom that you've carried in your pocket since you were born, it could end up being the receipt that you threw out now turned into a loli and asking you if you are her master.<br><br>Generally women end up with male objects and males end up with female objects. This can change however and you might up with a bro instead of a waifu if fate just so happens to be fucky that day.<br><br>The important thing about this however is that the object always desires to be used for their original function, and can in fact do so efficiently. A journal turned human might have super memory to remember everything written on her skin, a gun turned human might be able to precisely and efficiently launch bullets.<br><br>Most people have at least one Human object by the time they reach college.

Basically, there's this detective who's been working a serial killer case for exactly five years. The serial killer has been killing a different person every month since the first murder, and ever since he got put on the case, the detective has been having horrible, surreal nightmares for five years. He shows up to work exactly five years since the murders began, only to be taken off the investigation because he's been working on it too long with no result. <br><br>He gets drunk at work and heads home early in a drunken stupor and passes out, yet again having those horrible nightmares, but this time they're giving him clues as to who the killer is. He sets off on his own to find out who the killer is, all the while being haunted/guided by hallucinations and nightmares, blurring the line between what's real and what isn't, which only intensify as he gets closer and closer to solving the mystery.<br><br> The killer is actually the detective from the future who uses his crime solving skills to create hard to solve crimes, time-traveling to ensure that his past self becomes him. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Ender's Game pretty much IS an anime in book form already.

Reluctantly he accepts only because it has a special interest in him. Arriving at the scene is a gruesome sight. Blood is smeared everywhere and there's not a trace of body besides little bits of smashed bone. Inspecting the scene the detective notes that it's similar too other killings by a famed serial killer he has tangled with before, however nobody knows what they look like and there on the wall in victims blood is the message, "Come play with me, onii-chan!". Taking a cigarette and smiling the detective replies with that he's glad that his partner phones him out of bed as this case is just too interesting to go back to sleep</br>  <br>A generic harem plot with stupid MC, but his friend who gets the best girl questions the logic and reasoning for the harem MC is in.

It would have cute white girls (which are everywhere in anime these days) and kaiju, and superheroes, and some great teen romance/drama, what could go wrong?

For example, a broomstick will fly, at the cost of disabling a working helicopter and exchanging its mobility with the broom. Or you can fly yourself if you imitate the helicopter, spinning around making chopper noises, and you have some scrap metal that was once part of one, but then you will need someone to pilot you.

They are using this to isolate everyone in their own personal beliefs, so they may fill these victims with loneliness and despair.

Around every corner is a mysterious exchange student to run into and take you on a wild adventure, every delinquent is actually a super strong warrior, every student council is an army, every school is full of magical girls, ancient heroes in disguise, chosen ones of legend, every old man is a master fighter, evil sorcerers, fiendish organizations and mad scientists are a dime a dozen, and practically every alley is filled with young girls being accosted by thugs, just waiting to be saved. This is the nature of the world, this is normalcy. However, there is one person in this world that does not follow the flow, the one sore thumb. A young lad with a very strange power, even in such a world. He has the "Eyes of Meta", allowing him to view the world for it's truth, every event flag, every character designation, every route and set up, every plot point, it's all in his sight, and with this knowledge he has tried his entire life to avoid being caught up in the madness of such a world. However, a mighty force seems to have focused in on his existence, the author, the god of this world, aims to throw him head first into the main character spot, for the entire world. <br><br> Personally I think it would work better as a manga, since it would be easier to use sight gags later down the line, such as attacking with sound effects, interacting with speech bubbles, and eventually messing with the panel lay out as well, as the MC begins to take advantage of his meta knowledge </br></br>  <br>I would read/watch the shit out of this.</br>  <br>That already exists.

Enjoy!    Just ordered annoda volume, up to 16  Just me huh? Just like my life!  Don't make the same thread more than once.  Do you know offhand how much the vhs for ranma is worth?? I just got a bunch today  <br>I can't see them being any more than five dollars a piece. VHS tapes aren't really something anyone wants these days so they aren't usually going to go for a high price.</br>  Haha that'd fine,I got ten for two dollars    The best, also where is the lum fag, he is usually here by now.  I still enjoy her stuff even if she hasn't made anything in the last few years I actually keep up with.<br><br>I'm more of a fan of Araki and Karino Takatsu nowadays though,</br></br>  <br>Dunno.</br>  <br>I've been reading Rinne. It isn't the greatest thing ever but it's still pretty decent.</br>  <br>Watching it's been pretty great.</br>  <br>Pretty much her entire career in a nutshell. Well, it's great if you want 70/80s style of storytelling. The one thing Takahashi's done is remain pretty consistent throughout her career, mostly. Not extraordinary but with moments of greatness.<br><br>Maison Ikkoku is probably her best work. Just the right length and decent handling of all the characters. It always makes me wonder how someone who wrote Maison could write about Naraku in Inu Yasha.</br></br></br>  <br> my entire life can be measured in Takahashi works </br>  <br>I'll never get to have grilled squid on a sick ;_;</br>  <br>To be honest, I think Inuyasha might have benefited if Naraku had been treated like a villain in most other shounen fighting manga. Relevant to maybe one saga but they eventually defeat him and move on.</br>  <br>Inu Yasha had plenty of those as well. I actually like the big bad guy being introduced relatively early and sticking all the way through to the end. Not a lot of those around anymore.<br><br>The problem with Inu Yasha is just that it was simply too long. Way, way too long. The moment they end an arc and you'd think they made some progress, Naraku introduces a new group of villains; it was ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a few that do that, a lot more like to do the turnaround revolving door villain thing more though.<br><br>Jojo did that with Dio twice and did that with a few other arcs as well. There's a market and it can be done well if written to be done so from the start.</br></br></br>   Takahashi continuing to shovel in characters and antagonists as long as possible <br><br>Sounds like her usual flair to me.</br></br>  <br>ok, I kek'd. Is the humor in this pretty good?</br>  <br>With JoJo it definitely helps that Dio is used sparingly and the protagonists change every couple of years. It prevents everything from going stale.</br>  <br>I think so. Some people have said it's a little outdated but that's fine by me. Most other recent anime isn't really that funny to me.</br>  <br>It's comfy as fuck, and they've accelerated things in the anime so that the pacing's not terrible. So far, no character is an unspeakable cancer (at least to me, others may disagree).</br>    <br>There really is no character I dislike. It's kind of a strange sensation since there usually is at least one character that I just don't like.</br>  <br>I know, I keep waiting for that other shoe to drop and it just hasn't. Even Rinne's dickhead dad is awesome.</br>  <br>I do wonder if the lack of anything to be particularly vitriolic about is why conversations about it tend to be really slow.</br>  <br>After the Thirty Years-War of Ranma 1/2 and Inuyasha, it's kind of nice not having threads full of pointless bickering and shitposting.</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong. I don't want hundreds of posts worth of autists arguing about incorrectly terminology in Rinne fanfiction or long ramblings about why Mamiya Sakura is a shit.</br>  <br>Mamiya Sakura could never be shit. Even Rinne's cat loves her, and cats love nobody.</br>  <br>  cats love nobody <br><br>That's not true and you know it.</br></br></br>  <br>I know nothing of the sort, the little bastards are demonseed that care only about themselves.

I'm just wondering if an author or someone said it wasn't canon?</br>  <br>Guess what, the first replay wasn't me<br><br>I would never say that I don't care about the franchise that is all my life</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just going to give you a copy and paste answer. <br><br>The term canon means what is true within a fictional setting. And the only way you can prove something is true is to support it with facts. There is nothing in the main story (e.g. The movies or anime) that supports the events that took place in TDS. Thus you have no proof to support the fact the events from TDS are true in the same fictional setting as the anime/movies. You can Google the word canon to confirm the definition. Canon is about story narrative, which is why stories that don't connect in some way are not part of the same canon, and why everything is canon to itself. Also, just sharing characters and location is not enough to "connect" them, because in that case fan work would be canon as well.<br><br>If you want examples of series where side content is canon look at Nanoha or Raildex. Both of those stories have events that happened in side content referenced in the main setting.<br><br>Also note that TDS or the CD drama it's based on was not written by Gen, but Masaki Hiramatsu. A person who is not on the anime production staff.<br>http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Masaki_<wbr>Hiramatsu<br><br>The definition of canon says it's not canon. hat the author says is irrelevant.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm Abe Lincoln and I would never tell a lie </br></br>  <br> There is nothing in the main story (e.g. The movies or anime) that supports the events that took place in TDS. <br>Oh, so there's no real argument for one side or the other.<br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And Hella Homu</br>  <br>let's make this a Homu thread!</br>  Mmmm, mami-san.

Now we know how his Benkei moment is pulled off.</br>  <br>Anime was a mistake.</br>  <br>I like Blackwings.<br><br>Neutral towards Crow.<br><br><br>People actually believe Crow not existing would make fodder like Rua better make me laugh.<br><br>Crow isn't well written but losers stay losers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BUY BLACKWING KIDS</br>  <br>"All the spin-offs were a mistake." - Kazuki Takahashi</br>  <br>I sure am glad we are getting mire Blackwings no other characters should have there cards printed. I am also looking forward to Crow beating Yuri.</br>  <br>"It all went downhill after the demon penis." - Kazuki Takahashi</br>  <br>BUY BLACKWINGS AND RED DEMON'S DRAGONS</br>  <br> actually think Gon will win </br>  <br> Implying Gon does relevant things in card games <br><br><br>Turkeys are cool.</br></br></br></br>  <br>History literally repeating itself, everything after 64 is shit.</br>   there were people who seriously expected Gon to defeat Crow "BUY BLACKWINGS" Hogan <br><br>You really only have yourselves to blame.</br></br>  <br> Took Sawatari's Yosenjus away and gave him TRASH cards <br> Also gave Gongenzaka TRASH Pendulums <br>WILL SOMEONE STOP THIS MADMAN?</br></br></br>  Holy shit this is hilarious<br><br>Anyone who thought Gongenzaka even had a spic of a chance at winning is retarded<br><br>Anyone who legitimately hates Arc-V Crow is retarded<br><br>Anyone not satisfied with that based as fuck duel, probably one of the bet duel of Synchro arc, is literally and inherently retarded<br><br>Cry more as your precious samurai is sent off to dig his own grave, literally</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>5d's actually more interesting since Crow appear.</br>  Maybe it's just because I'm tired, but I actually don't care that Gon lost, even though I thought I would. He's dueled for a good bit up to this point, and we all know others are going to eventually fetch him from wherever he's sent (or he escapes on his own).  <br> probably one of the best duels of Synchro arc <br>That's because all the duels in the Synchro Arc have been shit. The only good duel since Yuya vs. Reiji was against Chojiro.</br></br>  <br>I agree, especially direct sequels. Yes, I'm talking about GX, Fuck GX!</br>  <br>I hope Crow replaces Gon as a lancer that would be good.</br>  <br> Crow is more important to the current plot <br>How so? I haven't started the Syncro World arc yet.</br></br>  <br>He's basically a shit commander. Once the Lancers fall apart, he's probably going to bargain Serena/Yuzu to R/Leo to keep Standard safe.</br>  <br>lel Gongenzaka gets new card shilled every duel. You guys are the reason we still don't have Yuto, Serena, or Funky Comedian cards</br>  <br>He's a genius, not a shit commander. He's intentionally fucking over certain characters to get a specific reaction out of other people. He's even manipulating his own brother just to get to Yuya.</br>  <br> M-muh Steadfast dueling <br> D-dont need Action card </br></br>  <br>Then watch and find out for yourself</br>  <br>If Konami wanted to print them, they would, no matter what a bunch of gaijin manchildren say.<br><br>They don't, so they're not.</br></br></br>   All these crowfags in this thread. <br>I can believe such shit taste, /Arc-V/ used to be better.</br>  <br>Blame the delusional faggots who liked gay Transformers knockoffs and toy dragons.<br><br>Boipussy lust stronk. Especially if its shota pussy</br></br></br>  <br>No man only based Blackwings deserve to be printed. I can't wait for Crow to become Yuyas new best friend.</br>  <br>He got to show off more SHS and that's all that really mattered. He was the most important character that Crow could beat, anyone more important would bullshit a win somehow even if they're "weaker." The only characters left Crow has to beat are whoever wins between Shinji/Tsukikage, Tokumatsu, fodder, Sawatari if he isn't fed to strongu, and possibly Serena but that one's not going to happen anyway.</br>  <br>Does Reiji know that Dennis is from Fusion?</br>  <br>watch it dumbass</br>   people unironically liking Crow in any capacity   <br>We will be getting Yuto's cards printed soon with the reveal of the XYZ booster set. Serena will get her cards printed in the next Fusion oriented booster set alongside the Ancient Gear support. Sawatari's Underworld Trope would probably be printed in a set like the Secret Forces.</br>  <br> People still mad over Crow </br>  <br> Steadfast duel <br> already riding on a D-Wheel <br>fucker should have just picked up the action card</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>This is bullshit. Every card Gongenzaka has used thus far bar this duel has been released. It's turning into BUY SUPERHEAVIES at this point.<br><br>Where the fuck are Serena's cards? Where are Sawatari's? Where the fuck are Reiras?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everything after 64 is shit <br>Kek, if that happens people won't have Yoshida to blame this time.</br></br>  <br>Why would Reiji want to extend Yuya's list of strikes against himself?</br>  <br>I'm not even mad that Gon lost, I even knew it was going to happen, I'm just mad that people are being absolutely fucking obnoxious about it right now.</br>  <br>ITS PART OF KEIKAKU</br>  <br>It's like pottery.</br>  <br><br>Fine. Be stingy about it.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you ask Konami?</br>  <br>I don't mind Crow, but that is wrong as shit.</br>  <br><br>Fusion special pack like HSR and Wings raider</br></br>  <br>Because Reiji gets a sadomasochistic surge out of toeing the line of danger by walking on the edge, whether it's making barters he can't fulfill or putting himself in the way of self-harm.<br><br>Hence, D/D/D.</br></br></br>  <br>Moonlights are just Tenki + Allure targets. What do they do that is more exciting than Fluffals?<br><br>Sawatari's new deck is just Dart Shooters all over again.<br><br><br> Faggots buttblasted over their Sora 0.5 job slut </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jack is successful and he isn't. <br><br>That's pretty much his relevancy.</br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Gonfag. This happens every time duels like this take place.</br>  <br> Implying they wouldn't give some non-answer <br>You know damn well we cant' ask any soulless corporation about anything and get a straight answer.</br></br>  <br>I don't feel nearly as frustrated as I was with 5D's, though</br>  <br>Crow's Yusei?</br>  <br>At least it's not a shitty filler arc like pre-WRGP</br>  <br>I once emailed them and asked them when they were going to make NK actually good, and they just told me to keep buying their stuff.</br>  <br>Might as well be Synchro's Yusei instead of Yugo.</br>   Crow Riding Duel <br>Previous thread explode to 600+ posts.<br>Best part of that episode is Crow stunt with Blackbird grabbing Action Card</br></br>  <br>It would have been the same had Gongenzaka won, except more people would be talking shit about Crow and spamming DONT BUY BLACKWINGs</br>  It's okay guys, Crow is simply better than Gon<br> Just like how Reiji was better than Yuya </br>  <br>I'm not mad about Gon losing neither, but more about Crow winning. You could replace Gon with Sawatari, Dennis, Ninja, or even with ENJOY, and I would be still mad. Crow has no impact to the plot, nor any emotional involvement with any of the Lancers, so I don't know why he is still in the tournament.</br>  <br>What you think is irrelevant. They will get released sooner or later anyway. ;)</br>  <br>Would've been better if he started flying instead with those wings</br>  <br><br>So this is the curse of Synchro summoning, isn't it?</br></br>  What even   Under the command of Akaba Leo, he is trying to kidnap Yuzu and Serena away to the Fusion Dimension <br> and Serena </br>  <br> tfw Reiji, Sawatari, and Shun become the new cool kids and spend their time running through academia halls disrupting class shouting Serena and Ruri </br>  <br>I once asked if they could name the card artist for Laundsallyn, and they replied that they wish they knew, but have no idea. And that they hope I can find out somehow on my own.<br><br>Who else besides Konami am I supposed to ask?</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt he's strong enough to carry 2 girls at the same time.<br>Also, Fusion arc pls hurry.</br></br>  <br>I'm more expecting Yuzu to go around screaming Serena.mp3 to every faceless mook she sees after Serena gets kidnapped in place of Yuzu.</br>  Reminder that Synchro was a mistake  <br>This is pretty much a shitty pre-Academia filler arc, though.</br>  I fucking hate Crow. I hate his design. I hate his monsters's design except one or two. Even so i knew that he was most likely to win because him winning would create infighting between the Lancers and make the plot more interesting.<br>If Gon won what would happen. Crow entrusts Yuya with showing them Tops like every shounen hero?</br>  <br>Dennis will take Serena with him while Yuri takes Yuzu.</br>  <br>Its boring bur the Crow hatedom would rather have something that simple than more turkeybirds filling packs.</br>   being too inept to eat ice cream   WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?
