She's gay as fuck.</br></br></br>    Wait. when did a Ducky fig get announced? This is the first I've heard of it.  <br>And you are just a large maggot with limbs.</br>  <br>Proofs?</br>  <br>What are you so angry  boat? </br>  <br>No, but Mutsu is.</br>  <br>Noooo shut up its not canon yettt</br>  <br>The captain of the ship was gay.</br>    <br>It's made by FunnyKnights.</br>  <br>Are you serious?</br>  <br>The anime doesn't count for anything</br>  <br> No  </br>  <br>That's not how you spell kaga. Ill never get why people even ship NagaMutsu.</br>  <br>Nope, glorious Tanaka shall mandate Fubuki, Fubuki and Fubuki. Because god forbid that any other MC does not match up with Yoshika and Miho for the GuP x SW x Kancolle crossover</br>  <br>Just mindbreak her, it's way easier.</br>  <br>If he wanted to match with them he'd use a Fumikane ship.</br>  <br>She's cute in the apron I admit but she wouldn't love me and I don't have the nerve</br>  <br>Kaga isn't either.<br>Why don't yurifags stick to the actual yuri characters?</br></br>  <br> Ill never get why people even ship NagaMutsu. <br><br>I don´t like Nagato much, but fuck me if Mutsu isn`t retardedly hot.</br></br></br>  <br>Who would be a better MC?<br>I like the idea of Yukikaze as one.</br></br>  <br> Kaga isn't either. <br><br>did you even  watch the show </br></br></br>  <br>Kagerou, Zuihou, Akiduki, Shigure, Yukikaze, Zuikaku, Ooshio.</br>  <br> the show <br>laughing_dragons.jpg</br></br>  <br>The anime isn't canon.</br>  <br>Yes, and it was terrible. Good thing it's not canon.</br>  <br> What is Akaga tag <br><br>I never doubted that, Im just talking any ingame lines to back up their homo behaviour in fanart, and they even forced it in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Fanart is what it is.</br>  <br>I bet you think Kirishima doesn't need glasses either.</br>  <br> Good thing it's not canon. <br><br>Is there even canon to this?</br></br></br>  <br>Game lines.</br>  <br>The game.</br>  <br>So are we in a imaginary world where ingame lines are not canon and only kagawife fanart is canon? Ok.</br>  <br>Fanart isn't always based on game lines. The case of NagaMutsu is one of those.</br>  <br>We're in the world were Kaga says 私…感情表現が…その…。提督…私…これでも今、とっても幸せなのですけれ<wbr>ど… when you marry her.</wbr></br>  <br>I never said any fanart is canon at all.<br>There's nothing implying Kaga wants to fuck Akagi at all. Akagi doesn't even mention Kaga outside of seasonal lines. The reason she worries about Akagi is because she was Akagi's escort ship.</br></br>  <br>Technically Nowacchi was Akagi's escort ship.</br>  <br>Both of them filled that role.</br>  <br>Don't call her Nowacchi.</br>  <br> - Maybe Teitoku actually appearing <br>why does this matter so much? the anime ruined everything it touched, do you want TTK to suffer the same destiny?</br></br>  <br>So that means I can waifu her, yes?</br>  <br>Did you link the wrong post?</br>  <br>Why did they turn her into a Pokemon?</br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  Guys what day is it? Its  Nenohi day   <br>Of course you can, only takes 1 million exp.</br>    <br><br>yes, it was meant for </br></br>  <br>Not really. While Japanese carriers were often grouped together in a strategic sense, they operated separately in the fleet itself. At Midway for example most of the carriers were typically several kilometers separated from each other. They were too far apart to be escorting any of the other carriers.</br>  <br>So all of her charming personality relies on that one line? Ok.</br>  <br>To be fair, the anime TTK seemed to be a bonafide kuso TTK anyway</br>  <br>He's saying that she can't possibly be "gay as fuck" if she says a line like that.</br>  <br> make terrible decisions <br> make even worse decisions <br> keep making bad decisions <br> all because you had a dream where you got to wife Fubuki <br>The most kuso</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why Fubuki<br>Just why Fubuki<br>I don't understand</br></br></br>  <br>Fubuki is not just a starter ship, but plain enough to be the MC.</br>  <br>Lost Kisaragi, lost Shouhou, separated Ooi and KTKM.<br><br>Full Indo. Never go full Indo.</br></br></br>    <br>At this point /a/ has sunk more ships than them.<br>Sinking ships makes you a kuso, unless it's Naka or a girl you dislike, then it's a-ok!</br></br>  <br>I can't even see how it's possible to sink a ship unless you're playing the game while you're half asleep or something.</br>  <br> separated Ooi and KTKM <br>But that's a good thing.</br></br>  <br>It became ridiculous the second she became flagship</br>  <br>Power leveling, we've all done it before.</br>  <br>You know it was because he wanted to bang Bucky</br>  <br>Yeah but we didn't yet know about it then.</br>  Do you like her swimsut, /a/  <br>I'd have liked it better if the show was about Fubuki eventually leading a ragtag fleet of boats to victory. And it was that, for one just episode. Writers didn't even know what their show was supposed to be about. Such garbage.<br><br>I loved Atago though. All thirty seconds she was in.</br></br></br>  <br> boats </br>  <br>Well, I never implied that she was Ooi CV version. But are we actually forgetting all of the other lines? There's no way with such lines she's 100% straight. Also where's the waifu trait that everyone sees? She literally gives you the time of the day, tells you that the food is ready (not that it was handmade from her), and some Akagi's stuff. Dont get me wrong, I dont hate her, just neutral, but she's just a tryhard that probably respect his superior, that's all.</br>  <br>Also, Murasame.</br>  <br>I'd hai hai her hai hais.</br>  <br>What does she hold in her mouth in the new official art? Also if she appears again, maybe Ill keep her this time, I promised myself If we had swimsuit sprites I would buy a new dock expansion.</br>  <br>I like Bono.</br>  <br> What does she hold in her mouth in the new official art? <br><br>:P</br></br></br>  <br>Can you tell me how having lines mentioning Akagi means she's a lesbian? Close friends are a thing that exist.</br>  <br> What does she hold in her mouth <br> hold in her mouth <br> hold <br>Its her tongue.<br><br>cute</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why's her tongue orange then? Too much nicotine? No wonder I scrapped her.</br></br>  <br>Look, you may not like it, but Kancolle was practically a yuri show. Some of the girls in this were pretty gay in this, including Kaga and Akagi.<br><br> N-not canon <br><br>It had the creators blessing, and if it didn´t, he obviously didnt care enough to object.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> glasses </br>  I like to think that shipgirls on the sea and below would held a big party when the event end.  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>Fix your monitor, it's pink on mine.</br>  <br> Kancolle <br> small c </br></br>  <br>Those hips, they could bear the child that will someday rise up against you, and fight you to the death.</br>  <br>literally who cares</br>    <br>While I agree the anime is pure shit, he is right in that there was some direction from the game's devs, or so the anime devs said there was when everyone turned against them.</br>  <br>laughing_dragons.jpg</br>  <br>Oh look, people trying to pass the blame for making a shit product unto someone else.</br>  <br><br>He's not wrong tough, wasnt the animation supervised by the game's staff?<br>I mean, most of the characters were accurately animated. For example,kaga was kaga, how would a "canon" version look then?</br></br></br>  <br> For example,kaga was kaga, how would a "canon" version look then? <br><br>Not gushing every time Akagi hit on her, obviously.</br></br></br>  Didn't Mutsuki's artist say that you should disregard the anime on her twitter?  <br><br>Everything was invalidated when the midway hime transformation happened</br></br>  <br>Yes, yes she did.</br>  <br>Akagi wouldn't even hit on her.<br>Seriously, she mentions Kaga literally twice in all of her lines.</br></br>  <br>She drew cute girls so I trust her ideas more.</br>  <br>When are the other drewships getting kai ni. I need revamped Akeboner and dank-chan and crab girl in my life.</br>  <br>Why though? Why is the idea that the Abyss doesn't evolve into stronger forms? Look at the original Anchorage and Seaport demons, and the newest ones from this event.</br>  <br>Listen to all of them, 7 times including seasonal ones, and admiral 4 times only. Akagi doesnt care, its obviously onesided.</br>  <br><br><br> Kancolle <br> small c <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> boat </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She hit on her once in the bathhouse whatever IIRC. Mutsu hit on Nagato all the time.</br>  <br/>  <br>Because they're supposed to represent an area.</br>  I want to make a child with daijoubu  <br>Airfield Hime is supposed to be the Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, not the Airfield at Midway that would also be named Henderson field after the Battle of Midway.</br>  remember to treat your hardworking destroyers to the gift of motherhood.  <br>Assuming you're talking about Kaga here, none of the lines imply she's lesbian for Akagi, it's not like Tatsuta or Ooi<br>Unless you're going to say that visiting a friend that you just said doesn't care means they're fucking</br></br>  Currently working on /g/796992/56de71c097/<br><br>I'm going to work on /g/827103/243cf4822d/ next, which is by same artist as Fubuki to Hajimeru<br><br>Dumping won't be done until  3 weeks from now </br></br></br></br>  <br>After Darwin now suddenly appears at Sri Lanka I don't even know anymore.</br>  <br>so you hate the anime because you can't self-insert rather than the horrid CGI animation or things like , ok got it, you're cancer.</br>  <br> wanting S2 to ruin all those girls <br> implying S2 will show the TTK <br>They'll continue with the "TTK = viewer" bullshit. They may have recognised the anime was underwhelming, but they won't learn a lesson. They won't change a thing.<br><br><br>You don't expect much from retards.<br><br><br> It had the creators blessing <br>And that was exactly the problem with it.<br><br>Tanaka just forced his fantasies on the viewers. He also obviously didn't think enough of us players to think that we'd even be half as incompetent as anime TTK.<br><br><br>Sure, but their personalities were anything but accurate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So I dont know shit about Kancolle but theres a few I liked. Shimakaze, Nenohi, and that 18 submarine. What are some good Kancolle who are loud, angry, and obnoxious that I would love?  <br> Kancolle </br>  <br>Eugen and Hiei comes to mind.</br>  <br>When the fuck did I say any of those things? What the hell? I happen to DO hate it for those reasons. I don't want a self insert character, either.<br>I just it was out of character. I can dislike that too, you know.<br>Stop strawmanning.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaga and Shiranui</br>  <br>Its a widely accepted abbreviation stop sperging out at people.</br>  cute?  <br> Kancolle <br> small c </br></br>  <br> Nenohi <br><br>That's a first.</br></br></br>  <br> loud, angry, and obnoxious <br>Sendai,  It feels great to marry her <br><br>Kagafag plz</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but it is not an accepted terminology for the characters.</br>  <br><br> using the name of the franchise to refer to the girls <br> implying it's acceptable here <br>'no'</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuu.</br>  <br>literally how did you get all those assumptions from that post</br>  <br>It's the opposite. We were forced to self-insert as the admiral.</br>  <br> Fubuki: wait, that's not my pantsu </br>  <br> Sure, but their personalities were anything but accurate. <br>Weren't some of the girl's lines changed to correlate with the anime though?</br></br>  <br><br>Im not following what in the world you mean.</br></br>  How many images have you saved from Pixiv today /a/? I'm at 551 right now.  <br> Yuu <br> Not superior tanned </br></br>  <br>I certainly didn't feel forced to do so at all.<br>Stop assuming that everybody is a loser like you, when we are really all of us many different kinds of losers.</br></br>  <br><br>I rarely save images anymore. Mostly due to there being too many created and myself being satisfied with my collection.</br></br>  <br> Weren't some of the girl's lines changed to correlate with the anime though? <br>I'm sure you meant anime's lines were changed to correlate with the game. The word you're looking for is "added".<br><br><br>You mean we were forced to see from Tanaka's point of the view. Or are you just simply new here?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> who are loud, angry, and obnoxious <br>All the best ships are</br></br>  <br>Ooi went full psycho lesbian</br>  <br>In  the poster said "What are some good Kancolle." In this instance he used to word "Kancolle" as a way of referring to the characters, which is typically frowned upon in /a/ Kancolle threads. This prompted these responses   pointing what those posters took issue with, the use of "Kancolle" to refer to the characters instead of "Kanmusu".</br>  <br>Only some of the girls, and only some of their lines. For example, CL Ooi is still the same as before.<br><br><br><br> You mean we were forced to see from Tanaka's point of the view. <br>Preety much this. It wouldn't have been bad enough by itself, but they had to go on to say "the admiral is the viewer".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the flying fuck would a guy who just said he knows nothing about it know that term and use it? Plenty of people say "Who is your favorite SHOW TITLE/GAME TITLE?" in sentences here.</br>  <br> the use of "Kancolle" to refer to the characters instead of "Kanmusu". <br>That autism though.</br></br>  <br>Well, they're the fleet collection, though. It's not wrong, per se, just not the best choice of autism.</br>  <br>I will do it for her. She will see my dedication then, yes?</br>  <br>How big is your collection if you are satisfied with it?</br>  <br>You're not really dedicated unless you're like that one Hagurofag.</br>  <br/>   Finally got Kumano <br>I have the five bears, I no longer need this life.</br>  <br><br>Who's he and what did he do</br></br>  <br>Use them for next event then.</br>  <br>Can you not tell? He married 6 pages worth of Haguros.</br>  <br>6 Pages at 100 plus an unremodeled Haguro, a Kai Haguro, and a Kai Ni Haguro at 150 I recall.</br>  I did it.  <br>25 times now. What's it like having 25 kids?</br>  <br>Perfect.</br>  Arashio.  Is Yukikaze a beaver or a hamster  <br><br>Sexiest loli ship.</br></br>  Is it me or does Wo really love her yogurt?  Sieg heil.  <br>What happened in the image?</br>  <br>A pantless retard.</br>  <br><br>Well that describes it a little better. Is that considered poligamy or just a continuity error?</br></br>  <br>Is it agreed that the best Bismarck doujinshi are the ones where she pisses herself?</br>  <br><br>1583 images. <br><br>This was the first image of my collection. ‎July ‎02, ‎2013, ‏‎11:40:45 PM. It's almost been 2 years to the day that I first really found out about KanColle.</br></br></br></br>  <br> best <br> pisses <br>No</br></br></br>  <br>It's because she's pantless that she's great, Anon.</br>  <br>do not sexualize the beaver</br>  <br>You're right, NTR is better.</br>  <br>I'm at 13564 images.</br>  <br>How can you say you love her if you won't drink her pee?</br>  <br>Not possible.</br>  <br>Yes.<br><br><br> he doesn't enjoy omorashi </br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Rules of Autism.</br>  <br>That's a fine lady you got there.</br>  <br>whats she gonna do with that anchor</br>  <br><br>do I win?</br></br>  <br>551 today? or in total<br>I don't even know how many I have.</br></br>  <br>I hope you saved those manually. <br><br>Yes, 551 saved today.</br></br></br>  <br>That isn't a lady though.</br>  <br> 5355 folders </br>  <br> no folder name </br>  <br><br>Why so many folders? I only have a folder separating H and Non-H?</br></br>  <br> 5,355 folders </br>  <br><br><br><br>Those are PixivUtil, I'll admit.

Serena's next on-screen duel will result into a loss, then it will be followed by more. That's always YGO tradition.</br>  <br>Either way she still has the most wins out of any female duelist in the series already.</br>  <br>Sawatari a best, Serena a cute, Tokumatsu a bro, this episode a good</br>  <br>Personally, I prefer the moxen since they're still worth something if they're not in your opening hand.</br>  <br> Serena will never get to lead her pet dog Sawatari around on a leash  <br> Dennis will kidnap her <br> Sawatari will get carded trying to save her <br> Yuya vs. Yugo will get Yugo poofed by Yuzu to Fusion where Yuri will eat him <br> Yuzu will then get kidnapped <br> Dennis destroys all of them and escapes with the Ruris <br> Sawatari and Ninja are carded and out now <br> Reiji shows up and is like JUST AS PLANNED WE FOUND THE TRAITOR, LETS GO GANG </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When the ruris don't get a daily dose of being crude and strong they pout.</br>  <br><br>Anzu literally never lost a duel</br></br>  <br>She's probably just upset she hasn't had her sweets or Sawatari to yell at.</br>  <br>I can't wait to see Gon and Shun's beautiful combo next week.</br>  <br>Neither has Serena, also Anzu only dueled 3 times. She may be undefeated but almost every other YGO female has more wins than that because they actually got to duel more than 3 times.</br>  <br>Where is Aki in her benchwarmer outfit?</br>  <br>Gon comes out with strangely situational cards and uses up his hand to make it easier for Shun to bring out Rise Falcon. Rise Falcon uses an overlay unit and brave claw revolutions. Enemy's LP hits 0.</br>    <br>Will Ebina's love for Ruris at least make it a well animated duel, with new Moonlights?</br>  <br> new Moonlights </br>  <br>I hope to God, I'm tired of seeing Moonlight Cat Dancer and Moonlight Blue Cat and then her opponent losers. The more Moonlight cards the better chance we have of actually seeing the cards come out.</br>  <br> Shun mercilessly beating Synchro Nico Smiley </br>    <br>She needs a new level 4 Moonlight monster so she can  OVERLAY  them.</br>  <br>She would never do something so disgusting.</br>   her face when she has to ride bikes now whether she wants to or not <br>CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES, YUZU<br>CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she and everyone else in the Lancers should Pendulum Summon since they're part of the Sawatari Generation</br>  <br> What Shun sees when he looks at Yuzu </br>  <br>Fucking bird hair</br>  <br>She would if Kurosaki-sensei taught her how.</br>   Yuzu will finally stop wearing her Nazi outfit.   <br>She should keep wearing that shorts+sleeveless shirt combo.<br><br>And her riding suit should have no sleeves too.

They seem to have the potential to be quite fun.  <br>What is this?</br>  <br>BAD END CONFIRMED</br>  <br><br><br>Ruri~</br></br></br>  <br>Chances are we'll get it when Sawatari tries to save everybody, comes close to winning, and ends up carded. Like Jonouchi's Shadow Realm duel with Marik. <br><br>I'm gonna guess he stays in EGAO mode once Yuzu gets mad at him for eating Yugo.</br></br></br>  <br>W H E N</br>  <br>You've got it backwards. You won't be seeing any more Moonlights, unless the cards are coming out.</br>    <br>Yuzu is going to be leg locking and telling Yuya to come inside so much when they reunite that their kid will probably be able to take over by Arc V 2</br>  <br> The more Moonlight cards the better chance we have of actually seeing the cards come out <br>Cookmates say otherwise</br></br>  <br> Cookmates have enough cards to fill out a deck. <br> Print Aqua Actress' instead. <br><br>Ironically this is what gives me hope that anything can be printed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Arc V writers are a bunch of waifufags, which means Serenas cards will probably be printed</br>  <br>Your Tomato knows how to ride a motorcycle, why can't you?</br>  <br>Free token cards from the official Konami girls-only Yugioh meetup they have every month or so</br>  <br>Not how that works, they rarely push cards that come out before they do in the anime. It's why I'm baffled seeing people assume Ryo or Jonouchi are coming back solely because they're pushing Cyber Dragons and Red Eyes cards.<br><br>A few archetypes say otherwise, like the Dinosaurs from GX. Either way he is right, the more cards you see in the anime the better chance they have of coming out at least a little bit. <br><br>I really don't understand why they bothered with that card honestly, especially when we have so many other more deserving cards that need to be printed, and not just in Arc-V, we still have tons of cards from the other series that need to be printed, let alone about half of the archetypes in Arc-V. Konami really needs to try and start producing more cards instead of focusing on the Entermates, there are a ridiculous number of them already, or trying to push older cards that half of them don't even fit into any decks people even use anymore, even with some of the new supports.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What?</br></br>  <br> I really don't understand why they bothered with that card honestly <br>Because they had to print SOMETHING for Arc-V.</br></br>  Yuya may be the cutest and most perfect looking and sounding and acting and everyt- <br>Just answer the question<br>http://strawpoll.me/4770619</br></br>  <br> there are a ridiculous number of them already <br>Is the number of Entermates Blackwing level yet?</br></br>  <br> No Yusei <br> Dub Judai name </br></br>  <br>Could have printed a lot of different shit instead.<br><br>It's getting there. I feel with how much Shun gets pushed in the anime, BUY RAID RAPTORS is gonna be the new one along with BUY ENTERMATES and BUY ODD-EYES.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuya and Yuzu fuck the multiverse up bad  <br> both go their own separate ways <br> miraculously save child individuals that reminds them of their former selves and raise them. <br> 10 year timeskip Yuya becomes an Archer-tier EdgeLord and Yuzu becomes morally grey. <br> Try to travel back in time to change what they did wrong but multi-verse theory happens meaning no matter how hard they try it won't affect their recent world. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you forgot that blonde girl with glasses on the first Yugioh, you know the one who actually kissed Yugi.</br>  <br>If you count anime only, there totals around 40 Entermate monsters.</br>  <br>Does Yuya really get more cards printed than other protags did? Most of his cards stick to an archetype (hence, Entermates and Magicians) since in the past the MC's deck would be more mish mash.</br>  <br>Yuzu confirmed MC for Part 2.<br><br> Gongenzaka  confirmed MC for Part 3.</br></br></br>  <br> no yusei <br>i know he would get all the votes, but come on.</br></br>  <br> Does Yuya really get more cards printed than other protags did? <br>I cant imagine he comes anywhere close to all the garbage Hero cards Judai had printed</br></br>  <br> 40 Entermate monsters already and we're not even halfway through the show <br><br>For what purpose</br></br></br>  <br> Meanwhile Reiji is time traveling with Yliaster and Paradox trying to save the worlds from utter destruction <br> yfw the Domino City Paradox comes from is Synchro Dimension after Fusion is done with it <br><br>Elemental Heroes got a lot, but for the most part, yeah Yuya is getting tons of cards printed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's his time to shine</br>  <br><br>Judai probably will forever hold that record.<br>Yusei and Yugi probably have similar amount of cards printed, but it's harder to keep track of the number of their released cards because they don't stick to a specific archetype that much</br></br></br>  <br>Arc-V 2? Incoming Yuzu taking the spotlight. Which makes me ponder just what exactly they are gonna do to Yuya to take him out of action for a good chunk of the season. I mean, it's not like Judai got a replacement during his time as the supreme king</br>  <br><br>No</br></br>  <br> there are people here RIGHT NOW dumb enough to take that post seriously <br>You guys are not often the brightest, even for 4chan</br></br>  <br><br>More like 30</br></br>  <br>Yusei had nearly all of his cards printed didn't he?<br>All the Synchrons, Warriors, Effect Veiler, Ghost Gardna, the Stardusts, Armory Arm, Quillbolt, Level Eater<br>Fuck, what didn't get printed?</br></br></br>  <br>Yugi at first didn't have many at all, by now he probably does yeah. But solely because they re-release cards, they've added tons of supports for older cards the past year or two with DM cards, they've been trying to give them Synchro/Xyz shit and everything. <br><br>From a straight show base I believe it goes.<br><br> Judai <br> Crow <br> Yuya <br> Yugi <br> Yusei/Yuma <br><br>I'm not even sure if we can count Yugi as the OCG/TCG was just coming out so of course they'd get cards printed. <br><br>Chances are it'll have something to do with Yugo getting nom'd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Eita won't be the new protag </br>  <br>I know right<br> There are people who dont know Arc V 2 will follow Neo New Sawataris revolution </br></br>  <br><br>Yusei was pretty prone to using the same cards over and over again though</br></br>  <br> Implying Nega Neo New Sawatari won't be the final villain </br>  I'll be the new protag, I've already stolen Yuzu, and I'm going to steal the spotlight when I beat Jack instead of Yuya. <br><br>What would you guys think if Yugo was the one that ate Yuya instead? Just hypothetical because it's obviously not happening.</br></br>  <br> Speed Warrior wa shokan! <br><br><br>Later on they start missing a few cards, I was watching the ZONE duel the other day and they never printed some of the cards he used there, like Clear Effector. All his Syncro monsters did get printed though</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if I would like Yugo as the main, even if I like him as he is right now. Baka hotheaded shounen MC is less cute when it's the main thing.</br>  <br>Hey man, I like BAD ENDS. I really, really like BAD ENDS</br>  <br> Baka hotheaded shounen MC is less cute when it's the main thing. <br>This. exactly hotheaded idiots are good if they're just a secondary character they're tolerable that way. Them being in the lead makes it cringe worthy</br></br>  <br>Why? Every character I like just dies or get replaced. Now with the MC too? Fuck this gay earth.</br>  <br>HYPE'S DEAD<br><br>NO BAD END<br><br>POST IS FROM 2014<br><br>BUT TRUE DETECTIVE JUST PULLED A FAST ONE<br>https://twitter.com/justfal516/stat<wbr>us/523801862579843074</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It probably would work great for an extreme shocker nobody ever thought was gonna happen, then be interesting for a bunch of episodes but ultimately be extremely shit and will probably make me drop the series. <br><br>Especially because Yugo is the kind of guy who is extremely awesome in doses but if the focus is too much on him his personality and wouls get old pretty fast. Arc-V would basically turn into the equivalent of the a spinoff of a popular character of a series and those are alway shit.</br></br></br></br>  crotchal region status: hurt.  <br>That sounds fucking terrible.</br>  <br><br>This</br></br>  <br>The poster is from 2014. Yuya's staying as MC.<br><br>If they were to have him go full EDGE the best move would to have Yuzu be the MC due to the show's mythology arc, but, as I said, the poster is from 2014. Probably just some gayass promo card where you insert yourself in the card.</br></br></br>   yfw Yusho is the EGAO in Yuya because Yuya ate him too   <br>KNOWLEDGE IS NUMBER 1!</br>  <br> insert yourself <br><br>RED HAT ANIME CONFIRMED</br></br></br>  <br>It's this <br>The blank token card is for a photo of your choice</br></br>  <br>THE CORRECT ANSWER IS ONLY 1!</br>  <br>Is a picture of giveaway tokens and some moonspeak really all that's needed to fool /a/rc-v?<br><br>You guys are so dumb sometimes, holy shit</br></br></br>  <br>Aww. I wanted Yuya to go insane, and then Yuzu to be MC, and for her to go insane too, forcing Gongenzaka to be the MC to stop them. Why won't Konami indulge my edginess?</br>  <br> Yusho kept hypnotizing Yuya trying to draw out his untapped power until he went too far and Yuya accidentally absorbed him <br> the evil force inside Yuya's head was actually Sky Magician all along </br></br>  <br><br>Oh look the anti fun police has arrived</br></br>  <br>Is it really so bad to want SUFFERING?</br>  <br>We're just trying to have FUN</br>  <br>sora is cute too.</br>  Post Manzai Serena  <br>if yuya dies i stop watching</br>  <br>Who?</br>    So this is the perfect opportunity for Dennis to kidnap Serena and take her back to Academia. If he doesn't take it now he's either a bigger fuckup than Sora or a quadruple agent.  <br>Manzai Serena  :&gt; </br>  <br> a quadruple agent <br>I've been saying that from the start.</br></br>  <br>How many days has it been since the Battle Royale ended? How many injections has Sora had since then?</br>  <br>He doesn't have either of their duel disks with them to teleport, so I don't think he can.</br>  <br> Sora comes back SWOLE as fuck because of all the injections </br>  <br>I'm looking through past sets and Yusei and Yuma seemed to get around 4-7 cards per set, which is the same for Yuya.</br>  <br>Don't tell me what to do.</br>  <br>fixed<br>http://strawpoll.me/4770863</br></br>  What was Serena pouting about?  Yugo is fucking retarded. He knows he's a wanted criminal amd still wants to enter the friendship cup. Like JM said that's just him serving himself on the silver plate while also serving as a warning for all commons  <br>No sweets or people to punch. <br><br>I don't think Yugo cares as long as he can beat people in duels.</br></br></br>  <br>Bored as fuck. The same as her entire life in Academia.</br>  <br>Say goodbye to Yuyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</br>  <br>She missed the manzai with Sawatari-san this week</br>  How relevant is Yuzu to the plot?  <br> my body is ready to take down xyz scum </br>  <br>Yuzu IS the plot.<br><br>Look at all that plot.</br></br></br>  <br>she's a great  self insert </br>  <br>She was a window through which we saw most of the plot at the start of the show, now she's Yuyas main motivation. Reasonably so</br>  <br>Eye Duel 3 when?</br>  The animation quality in this episode seemed better than usual. They got Ebina, didn't they?    <br>no it was ufotable</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Do you think that they are going to combine Speed World - Neo and Cross Over?<br><br>Maybe by materializing ramps they could use those ramps to jump on the platforms that float in the air, and they could get action card by grabbing them while the are drving. past them.</br></br>  <br>Yuya would have no chance of performing motorcycle stunts, even on AUTOPILOT. Now Jack, on the other hand...<br> STANDBY </br></br>  <br>Jack with kids is always adorable for some reason. I really wanted him and Carly to have kids for that reason alone.</br>  <br> that shun <br>Every goddamn time</br></br>  i'm on episode 13 right now<br> yuya's face when reiji pendulum's 3 monsters into play <br>mega kek</br></br>  <br>Even Ebina knows that Yuzu is still the best. Hope he animates her first duel in the tournament.</br>  <br> b-but only I can pendulum <br> im da mc!! <br>It was great.</br></br></br>  <br>Is there any kind of picture that can't get better by adding Shun in it?</br>  HEY GUYS I FOUND YUZU!  Sora would have won this duel, his hand was closer.  Is that time anon.<br> Your cardfu/huscardo <br> Say something nice of her/him <br> Be fully autistic or chuuni to write something related to her/him   Hard Mode: Writefag on </br></br></br>  <br> implying it wasn't an Action Trap </br>  <br>Go to bed Yuya holy shit.</br>  <br>Is this what Ruri finale~ looks like?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4za<wbr>HLhj8jjA#t=2m22s</wbr>  [ ]  <br> Action Trap: Mirror Force </br>  <br>Hopefully Kamishiro writes her duel. That other guy sucks.</br>  Who's Yu-Gi-Oh's smartest duelist, heart of the cards aside? Kaiba or Jack?  <br>Reiji.</br>    <br>Kaiba is easily smarter than Jack.</br>  <br> Jack <br>Fuck no<br> Kaiba  <br>FUCK NO<br><br>Honestly, it's Reiji, since he understands Card Advantage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well Kaiba cheated half the time, especially early on. <br><br>Honestly for as dumb as Judai is and forgetting the rules half the time, he's one of the few that actually tries to set up strategy and shit. <br><br>If we're talking straight up just how good they are at dueling, then it'd be Yusei, Shun, Serena, Jack, or Judai, likely Yusei.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon please leave. Nobody will post monster if they are not Ruri herself.</br>  <br>Reiji, he's pretty much Pegasus, Kaiba, Atem, Jack, and Yusei all put into one. Dude understands shit way too easily. <br><br>If there was a meta in the anime, he'd be Super Nekroz.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuzu <br> Sawatari <br> Shun <br> That fucking hippo <br>Ebina confirmed for Arc-V poster</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A shame Reiji isn't as popular as Kaito, Kaiba, Jack, et al. Crazy Imouto Man and Crab Girl stealing his thunder.</br>  <br>Shun go away.</br>  <br>Shun sees visions of Yuto.<br><br>It's Yuya who hallucinates Yuzu.</br></br></br>  I hope we get a Yugo teaching Yuzu how to Motorcycle episode.<br><br>Kinda bored with everyone just knowing how to Motorcycle.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if Reiji did more than sit in his NEET cave and spy on people and figure out prep time like Batman. <br><br>The animators seem to love him though considering how broken he is and how many themes he has though.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh. After seeing this I guess Yuzu's hair isn't as unnatural as it seems to be.</br>  <br>They have an auto-pilot mode for that very reason. Kaiba wasn't about to have card games on motorcycles without a backup plan, he doesn't want to get sued.</br>  <br>I love how animators on this show are<br> the script writers <br> monster and card designers <br> AND music composers <br>Amazing that they have all these anime Da Vincis on board.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> principal pissing yuya off directly after a tiring battle <br>not fair</br></br>  <br> butthurt failed AOTS non-virgin detected </br>  <br>Hey, Shuzo died to teach Yuya an important lesson. Have some respect.</br>  <br>It's a joke on how it's only in the Arc-V threads that people seem to think animators have anything to do with all major parts of a series' production other than drawing frames for the show.</br>  Yuya a thirsty mofo. Beginning to show signs of scurvy. Someone throw him a bottle of orange juice.  <br>Sora had the inside track, but Yuya has longer and presumably stronger arms. He could've grabbed it too and probably would've won a tug-of-war.</br>  <br> the principal is pendulum summoning <br>holy shit yuya's going to be so butthurt<br>if i wasn't in love with him i'd be laughing my ass off</br></br></br>  <br>Shuzo cemented himself as best dad simply by being there as a father figure and reaching out. Yusho will probably end up being nothing but trouble when he finally shows up.</br>  <br><br>Oh you know what he meant. <br><br>If that happened Yuya would probably just let him have it so the duel would continue, chances are all it would have done was destroy Odd-Eyes Rebellion, Yuya still wouldn't have lost.</br></br></br></br>  Yugo confusing Yuzu for Rin after her shower gets me every time. What an adorable dumbass.  <br>The harisen seems like a powerful tool for keeping Yuyas in line.  Why didn't she just use it on Yuri when he was chasing her? </br>  <br> I hope we get a Yugo teaching Yuzu how to Motorcycle episode. <br>That would actually feel pretty pointless after showing that first timers have no trouble picking it up because of auto pilot.</br></br>  <br>Makes me wonder how close and intimate Yugo is with Rin.</br>  <br>Yusei and Jack were incredibly intelligent duelists who had seriously fucking next-level ability to read their opponents and predict their moves. Jack's flaw was that he let his emotions get the better of him, which is why Yusei beat him the second time. <br><br>Shun's good at this too, but he's a cocky little shit, which is why Sora outlasted and eventually trashed him the second time. It seems like he's really good at preparing for bad scenarios, but not necessarily adapting to them as they come. <br><br>Yugi was an incredibly smart duelist too, but his strength was less in strategy and more in being able to come up with ridiculous combos in the moment and being able to play all sorts of bullshit mindgames with his opponent (see: the time he eyefucked Mai into not attacking him). <br><br>I'd say Yusei, then Reiji, then Yugi, Kaiba and Jack probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, unless she reacts the same way whenever he does stuff like that (which he obviously is used to doing, otherwise he wouldn't have reacted that way) I'd say they can almost be considered couple-close  though, for the sake of argument and purity, stick with as close as siblings. </br>  <br> Yuzu hits Yuri with a harisen <br> Yuri rubs his head  <br> "W-what is this feeling...I-I remember this...? Huh?" <br> "What did you do to me, Hiiragi Yuz-ouch" </br></br></br></br>  Will Jack summon all 3 Red Demons in one turn??  <br>Shun's deal is his deck is made specifically to counter the special summons of Fusion Duelists, which in turn just sort of fucks everything up as far as the current game goes since everything important is a special summon. <br><br>And Reiji doesn't even need to read his opponents he's just overwhelming and has the same Atem mindfuck speeches going on with him too. He did make a point to Yuya that emotions will cause you to lose. <br><br>Reiji and Yusei are pretty much on the same level, maybe Reiji is even beyond just because of his ability to fuck with people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Odd-Eyes Rebelliion went down, Yuya was pretty screwed since he didn't summon any wall monsters with his last Pendulum Summon (seriously, he could've at last summoned Stargazer in DEF so he could revive OERD if it WAS destroyed)<br><br>Sabre Tiger would've attacked him directly and that would've been it. Although Sora probably would've just gone "lol, 1-1 now faggot" and left anyway when the cavalry arrived instead of carding him.</br></br></br>  <br> Crow and Jack appear in Arc-V <br> Arc-V has the best side cast <br> New Protagonist    Even Though It's 99% BULLSHIT  <br><br>Being Yuya is Suffering, they don't even give him a chance to show off like other MC's did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd imagine Yuya had a card in his hand to set or would have looked for an Action Card in that scenario. Standard would get absolutely fucked in Synchro and Fusion if it wasn't for Reiji's Action Magic, they rely too much on them. <br><br>But yeah you are right, Sora wouldn't have cared, just bit his lollipop and walked off while Yuya screamed about having fun. Shame we wont get to see him ever smile or duel Yuya again since Shun is probably going to fucking kill him the next time they meet.</br></br></br>  <br>If there was no action cards Yuya could've won because Sora used them to reduce the amount of life points he'll lose whereas Yuya used them just to gain his attacks</br>  <br>Pretty much. Shun's deck is made with the expectation that you'll keep throwing big SSes at him and he'll just turn it against you over and over. <br><br>Problem with that is that, apparently Sora just rope-a-doped him and outlasted his OTK. When a card came up that could just wipe Shun's field instantly, he had NO answer for it. <br><br>Although he seems to have wised up a bit, since he used Raptor's Ultimate Mace to counter the potential of his monster getting rekt against Dennis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even worse when you realize that Yuya's overall dueling record is barely above Yuma's who has the worst record as far as the MC goes. Though if we aren't counting the duels before the show began where he was under 60% then he's a pretty good duelist.</br>  <br> Standard would get absolutely fucked in Synchro and Fusion if it wasn't for Reiji's Action Magic, they rely too much on them. <br>It's hilarious that this is true for the most part, but in the specific case of Sora, he'd be such a fucking joke without Action Cards. Shun would've embarrassed him even harder than he did and Yuya would've destroyed him.</br></br>  <br>Damn Yuya is likeable So I feel sympathy for him losing a lot of screenime as a MC, However if Yuma was in his position I'd choose the side cast characters anyday</br>  <br>Yep, he's good at adapting. I'd imagine someone like Kaiba though whose deck mostly relies on tribute summoning barring the couple of fusions he has would be able to overwhelm Shun, since Kaiba was able to get three Blue Eyes out all the damn time like it was nothing. Makes me excited to see what cards he has in the new movie. Imagine Kaiba with Azure Eyes and Pendulum Summoning and shit.</br>  <br>True SYNCHRO doesn't use auto-pilot, though.</br>  <br><br>Yeah Sora is weird considering he's supposed to be the best duelist from Fusion as far as the Slifer, Ra, and Obelisks go. But so far all we've really seen him do is beat scrubs and Shun once. Especially considering Serena and Yuri both (though I don't know if Yuri counts) have so far been the better duelists by far, hell Dennis too. Not sure if he counts either. I'd imagine Yuri and Dennis were Obelisks as well though.</br></br>  <br>Off-screen duels don't count, Sora.<br><br>And Yuya is good because of the sidecast.</br></br></br>  <br>Use it as an excuse to teach Yuzu Synchro or something, I dunno. <br><br>Yugo and Yuzu need more screentime. Definitely the best part of this arc, along with ENJOY man.</br></br></br>  <br> Yeah Sora is weird considering he's supposed to be the best duelist from Fusion <br>Neh. Yuri's obviously stronger than him for one, as Yuri shitcanned Yuzu and Yuzu's one of the stronger duelists in the series. Serena's probably stronger than him too. <br><br>He might be one of the strongest STUDENTS at Academia, but there's probably all sorts of absurdly powerful adults there.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And Yuya is good because of the sidecast <br><br>Not really even if the sidecast weren't good, he's like Judai 2.0, although the relationship between him and Yuzu makes him more likeable</br></br></br>  <br>He might just be the strongest Obelisk then at least from what we've seen. But yeah it's clear that Yuri, Serena, and Dennis are better duelists than him, at least so far.</br>  <br> Dennis <br>Pshhh, what are you talking about, he's just some LDS scrub.</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah right. I'm really hoping he is some sort of Triple Agent or some shit, the Ocelot of the series.<br><br>I'm curious though, I'd assume that his Xyz summons don't give off the readings like Yuto/Shun's did, which is why he's able to infiltrate Standard so well and doesn't bother using Fusion, but I wonder why the other dimensions only have aptitude for certain ones. Like is Shun and Dennis' pendulum summoning also babby tier energy wise compared to Yuya, Reiji, Sawatari, etc.?</br></br></br>  Dennis the __________  <br>Bennis</br>  <br/>  <br>Are Serena's Serenas big enough for Bennis' Bennis?</br>  <br> since Kaiba was able to get three Blue Eyes out all the damn time like it was nothing <br><br>No kidding, you ever play against him in Tag force special? You'll always hear "Ore no prido, Sosti ore no tamashi, Ideyo, Blue Eyzu Whito Drogon!!" by the second turn. The only way to truly get rid of those fuckers is to banish them. Kaiba has no answer for that in his deck</br></br></br>  <br> KOURIN SEYO, WAGA TAMASHII </br>   That Laugh   <br>And now we'll likely get Blue Eyes Pendulum Dragons that go to the Extra Deck and can just be summoned every turn and Overlayed and Tuned and all sorts of shit. At least I'm hoping. <br><br>Also unfortunately no I haven't go to play TFS, I don't understand enough to get what's going on and I can't read Japanese worth a shit, mostly because I'm lazy and wont bother practicing and the translation for it are good, but the story translations are just Abridged Tier, some of it is straight ripped off. <br><br>We get a trailer for that movie come the 9-12 at San Diego Comic Con don't we?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably got Yuki Usagi didn't he alongside the Yang Zing. At least his deck got a boost.</br>  <br> Yuya loses to Jack <br> Disappears for half the arc <br> Yugo takes over as MC for awhile  <br> Yuya comes back this time he ditches the entermates and uses DRAGONS and Magicians </br></br></br></br>  1st Panel<br> Serena: Hey Sawatari! <br> It seems like I am a 'les' and I seem to be doing 'yuri' with Yuzu... <br> What does that mean? <br><br> Sawatari: Eh? Well―, <br> It means that it's girls that are really getting along and are really best friends. <br><br> Serena: Hmmm... <br> Below first panel: Wonder what's that box in front of her? <br><br>2nd Panel<br> Serena: I want to play with Yuzu... <br> Ah! Yuzu! <br><br> Yuzu: Serena? What's up? <br><br> Serena: You see! The truth is I am a 'les'! <br><br> Yuzu: HUH? <br><br> Serena: I wanna hurry up and do 'yuri yuri' with Yuzu! <br> Do you have time!? <br><br> bgsfx: intense breathing <br><br>3rd Panel<br> Yuzu: Serena, <br> Let go of me. <br><br> Serena: What!? Why!? <br><br> Yuzu: You're pretty close, <br> a bit. <br><br>4th Panel<br> Serena: Yuya! What should I do!? <br> I said something to Yuzu that Sawatari told me and she hated it! <br><br> Yuya: Well, you see! <br> Just by all means, stop believing whatever Sawatari says, got it!? <br><br>5th Panel<br> Masumi: What!? <br> Yuzu isn't a Lesbian!? <br><br> Yaiba: You're too noisy, Masumi! <br> You're saying such a thing with a loud voice! <br><br> Box: The person who received the most damage. <br><br>Man, this 5D's artist's favorite in Arc-V really is Serena. His latest comics are all about her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't need pendulums, they need an xyz.</br>  <br>Best part is that if they want, Serena can be a main stay in the cast due to her being voiced by Yuzu's actor as well. Now wouldn't that be strange if they got into a tag duel together?</br>  <br>He does now.</br>  <br>Whose isn't besides Ebina? <br><br>Well Dark Magician does have one, it's banned though. I'd imagine Yugi gets Xyz and Kaiba gets Synchro and they both get Pendulum.</br></br></br>  <br> Well Dark Magician does have one, it's banned though. <br>No it isn't.</br></br>  <br>Legendary Magician of Dark can't be used in duels.</br>  <br> Hippo Taking Yuyas Place <br><br>Ebina is not fond of Yuya is he?</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the Xyz Dark Magician. That's a Match Winner.<br><br>And it's technically not banned, it's illegal. There's a difference.</br></br></br>  <br>Ebon Illusion Magician.</br>  <br>A good number of his Arc-V sketches on twipple are of Yuya</br>  <br><br>I completely forgot about that card, my bad then.</br></br>  Can we discuss why this guy is the best secondary character ever introduced in the entire YGO franchise?  <br>He's really not. I don't think a lot of the staff likes Yuya very much at all considering there was an interview about why Yuya is no where near as balsy or hardcore as previous protagonist. The guy is a soft little dude with issues and gets very emotional.</br>  <br>Ebina is a fan of Serena too. He changed his profile pic, when the high res of her default manzai face was released on the anime's official twitter.<br><br>He changed it back to Hippo again though.</br></br></br>  <br>He's a total bro to Yuya, he's like Synchro Gongenzaka</br>  <br>He also changed it to Kurosaki once his icon was released on the anime twitter. No surprise that the best regular animation director on the team also has impeccable taste.</br>  <br>I read that producer interview and all they said is that they wanted to try something different with Yuya. Is saying that<br> our new MC is not a total badass gary stu <br>now equivalent to hating your own creation?</br></br></br>  <br> The guy is a soft little dude with issues and gets very emotional. <br><br>I want him to finally snap and make him be a baddass character for an entire arc</br></br></br>  <br>Ebina just loves all Ruris.</br>  <br>Why do you wanna bully the tomato?</br>  <br>Really? A shame since he's pretty much a good character that actually develops and is down-to-earth compared to previous protagonists.<br><br>He's my favorite compared to previous protagonists.</br></br></br>  <br> boyshorts confirmed </br>  <br>This makes me feel sorry for him his Soo much potiential but fortunately arc-v was blessed with a good side cast</br>  <br>So he likes Yuya?</br>  <br>It's quite obvious that his favorites are Shun and Ruris.</br>  <br>Yuya could've been serious but his family and friends stop him it's like there sealing away his real personality (not including edgemode)</br>  <br>Judai was pretty down to earth and not badass until Season 3 at least. In fact didn't Judai forget the fucking rules to duel monsters sometimes?</br>  <br>Enough to spend money he makes working for Yugioh to on Yugioh merch</br>  <br>Isn't that just most of Japan?</br>  <br> No where near as ballsy <br><br>Dude he was about fucking leave his friends in order to save Yuzu even Crow had to call him out, Fucking Crow. If that's not called determination I don't know what is</br></br></br>  <br>Sad too considering Reiji called him out on that shit too.</br>  <br> The guy is a soft little dude with issues and gets very emotional. <br><br>Ha top kek, still the straightest protag</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, yeah, he did say Yuya was being awfully focused on Yuzu despite claming he was avenging the fallen. God, Yuya would be been an annoying edgelord if he had come to Synchro without Yoko doing some parenting. especially after what those little bastard kids said.</br>  <br>Ruris &gt; friends</br>  <br>Yep, just rewatched the episode actually, he says something along the lines of "You only care about Hiragi Yuzu, but what of the other people who were turned into cards."</br>  <br>Nothing wrong to save your most loved one by sacrificing other lives</br>  <br>If Yoko hadn't dueled Yuya, he would have become an edgelord.<br><br>During Security's duel, he would have been put in isolation.<br><br>ENJOY Duel wouldn't have happened, and everyone would be out of half their decks.<br><br>Serena would have been "interrogated" by Jean-Michel.<br><br>So the Yoko duel WAS actually relevant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Inb4 Ebina is a Yuzufag and payed Ono Kensho to say this</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, he lost his shit over a bunch of knight nerds he didn't even know</br>  <br>Yuto's PTSD was fucking his mind though</br>  <br>More like Yuya would of edgelord'd out and beat them all using Odd Rebellion, scaring the fuck out of Serena,Sawatari and Reira in the process, Then, in his edgy state he ranks up Odd Rebellion into a destructive monster that creates such a problem that Jean sends in Jack Atlus after him.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It's like Yuya's almost close to Season 3 Judai when all he thought about was Johan, granted his friends pretty much wanted to help Judai.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I blame Yuto more for that. Yuya cares, just not when his Citrus is with another Fruit.</br>  <br> all he thought about was Johan </br>  <br> granted his friends pretty much wanted to help Judai. <br><br>Then he told them to fuck off and not to come because it too dangerous, then they wind up cursing his existance when it turns out to be too dangerous and flat out distancing themselves from him in season 4 because they were by their own admittance scared of Judai now. I still remember them instantly mad at him for dueling Fubuki in the abandoned dorm to draw out Darkness again even through it was Fubuki's idea.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, at the end of the day, when he heard news of Yuzu missing, he just forgot about those people and kept doing Yuzu.flac.<br><br>He mentions about those fallen ones a bit, but eventually, everything just went "MUH YUZU".</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if he'll ever drop the entertainment stuff</br>  <br>As expected for someone who cherishes their key person</br>  <br>Yeah, but it's not like you can do anything more for Michio or Teppei, while Yuzu's still out there somewhere.</br>  <br>That's a given</br>  <br>It's like you didn't watch the first part of Reiji vs Yuya's 2nd duel.<br><br>Everyone thought Yuzu was carded until at the end of that episode, where Reiji says that Yuya can still save Yuzu.</br></br></br>  <br>Juudai's normie friends were all kinda assholes in the end. He was better off journeying the world with Yubel, the cat and Daitokuji's ghost.</br>  <br>He's AU Himuro.</br>  <br>Yuya sometimes gets tunnel visioned like Judai did with Johan, but the difference is that he has friends and others around him who are actually effective in reminding him or keeping him in check.</br>  <br>So will he be irrelevant after episode 64?</br>  <br>Where else were they supposed to fit in a Yuzu.wav monologue?</br>  <br>To this day I still wonder what people's thoughts were when they first saw this.</br>  <br> Holy Shit a first every Straight Yugioh a Protagonist! </br>  <br>Wonder how the dub's gonna fuck this one up.</br>  <br>When you need to ally with someone, it's probably better to let them keep thinking they have the upper hand, rather than making them worry about how you're a potential threat.<br><br><br>People say that they were surprised, and I guess I was a little by how much of it there was. But at the same time, Yuya had literally only 2 friends his own age when the show first began.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? I first knew he was straight when this happened</br>  <br> Mieru's face as she realizes she never had a chance.  <br> Sticks by Yuya anyway and even almost jumps into the duel against Reiji. </br></br>  <br>Are you talking about this? The one where one of the producers call him one of their favorites?<br>http://ygorganization.com/arcvprodu<wbr>cerinterview/<br><br>Uchida： Eh!? Please tell us more!<br><br>Sanematsu： He’s a gentle child who is usually very quiet, unlike most heroes. He doesn’t use ‘だぜ！’ (a very brazen young male way of speaking) when he speaks. Instead of providing leadership for those around him, or reading the atmosphere, he’s a boy who gets involved with others. Those watching will be able to say to themselves “He’s just like me”, that he’s a boy without a lot of confidence, just like them, wondering how he will grow and change. I want those watching to see how he grows, and cheer him on as he does.<br><br>Hirayama： I myself am very sympathetic with Yuya’s weaker side and his sense of humanity, both good and bad. I love the entire cast as far as favorite characters go, but I really want to cheer Yuya on.<br><br>Kasai： I see. After asking you both, the show’s strong points seem even clearer! I’ll be able to enjoy watching the series even more now!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> You'll never have a loli with accurate fortunetelling powers who's extremely devoted to you. </br>  <br>Kasai： Could you tell us if there’s any characters you like best among the cast?<br>Sanematsu： I’d say mine is the hero of the story, Yuya. Usually, the hero is someone everyone loves the best, but Yuya is different form those sort of heroes, as you’re not expected to like him the same way as the normal run-of-the-mill hero.<br><br>They like him ;)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a reason why she didn't become a Lancer? Like, how is it not a good idea to have a person with occult powers like fortune telling and people sensing around on a mission where you're going to be, primarily, searching for people that can help you? HURR HURR RITUAL SCUM but Sibyllas are still good as fuck and Reiji could've given her Pendulums and Pot of Taboos.</br>  I can't wait for yuri to come back a take Yuzu away  <br> Protagonist hair style was based by a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. </br>  <br>Voiced by Aoi Yuki, leaving her being too expensive and apparently people aren't much fans of rituals. Regardless her deck as a ton of potential.</br>  Makes me wonder if they realized how much people fucking hated Yuma and the endless dick sucking he got for his stupid ass catchphrase/ life mantra. He's also likely to destroy the other protagonists in a duel now thanks to all the Utopia upgrades he's got.  <br>She doesn't really add anything to the group that's not already there. Sawatari has comic relief covered.</br>  <br>Well, at least she got her cards printed.</br>  <br>Pretty surprised that it is an outright confirmation of Citrus thirst.<br><br>That wasn't really enough though.<br><br>With his comment of not wanting to have a strong crude girl as a girlfriend, and how they're separate most of the time in Part 1, and how he doesn't think much of her during that time, it's not hard to think that Yuya thinks of Yuzu as just a friend.<br><br>But thanks to that episode, it's revealed that Yuya did took Yuzu for granted. Now that he lost her, he's pretty much desperate to go looking for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the children of Nippon loved Zexal and Yuma.<br><br>Regardless, I appreciate that in Arc-V that not everyone else in the cast relies on the MC (it's often the other way around), and that he's not always in the right or successful 100% of the time.</br></br></br>  <br>her VA costs a shit ton of money probably, also we already have Pink Ruri and Blue Ruri to fill the female roles.</br>  <br>Hopefully not. I liked Himuro, Yabagi, and Saiga. They were fucking great. I want to see Himuro perhaps go back to pro dueling, Yabagi continuing his traveling the world for rare artifacts, and Saiga reconciling with his former tag partner.</br>  <br>Yuri won't do it. They'll be separated again through some other, more tragic means.</br>  I need Raid Ruris. After Shun's antics I need a decklist. <br><br> tfw not /fit/ enough to be as badass as Shun </br></br>  <br>I'll never watch this. Anything after GX was pure utter Garbage. I thought 5D's would have been the nail in the coffin for watchers of the animes.<br><br>I guess "Heart of the Cards" is meaningless now, Yu-Gi-Oh was never about fan service, and we only had a handful of females in each fucking edition. <br><br>But now that they see that the cards ain't beating Pokemon anytime soon they're giving us Service, Moeshit and MUH EXTREMELY COLORED HAIR.<br><br>Fuck this shit, anyone with a brain wouldn't dare watch this if they had respect for the game. Literally I bet half of us in this thread don't even play anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We really don't care.</br>  <br>It's sad Yuto had to get eaten during his first meeting with Yuya. I kinda hoped they would have had more interactions</br>  <br>Not even worthy of the baitfish.</br>  <br>ok.</br>    Y'know what I think is a nice touch. When Sora and Yuzu Fusion Summon, they do the "clap your hands together" shit. <br><br>Reiji, Yuya and Masumi, who didn't learn to Fusion Summon from Academia, don't do the clapping thing and all have their own unique poses. Ryozanpaku does the clap, suggesting they have some connection to Academia.</br></br>  <br>Stay shit kiddo.</br>  <br>Why were Yugi's clothes during the dungeon dice monsters arc so much better than his other sets?</br>  <br>How do plan on fighting for the Resistance if you can't even make your own RR deck?</br>  <br> Ryozanpaku does the clap <br>They do? I remember Kachidoki doing kung fu poses.</br></br>    <br> tfw she uses Nekroz in Tag Force Special <br><br>The absolute horror.<br><br>DM had plenty of fanservice and Heart of the Cards is just Destiny Drawing which still exists. Also YGO is beating Pokemon in the TCG by miles. YGO and MTG are still kings.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But now that they see that the cards ain't beating Pokemon anytime soon <br>Yu-Gi-Oh kicks the shit out of Pokemon and MtG. It's been the best selling card game for a while now. <br><br>The rest of your post is just nonsense that doesn't even deserve to be dignified with a response but I felt that part needed to be actually corrected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuzu does it too, granted she learned from Sora, but it's interesting to note that she doesn't have to do it and she knows it.</br>  <br>Because back then, he didn't dress like a metrosexual and an outlet for the author's weird fashion sense. I still want to know what the fuck was he thinking about when he made the final boss of the series a monster with a demon dragon dick. At least Tragodeia, wasn't as offensive even he flushed 5 thousand years down the toilet against two teenagers.</br>  <br>Cause this keeps getting in the way of my deckbuilding.</br>  <br>It's not beating MtG, except in Japan.<br><br>And Pokemon is coming back somewhat, but it's definitely behind Magic and Yugioh.</br></br></br>  <br>He does this, but I don't think its really a clap?<br>He just does kung fu poses.</br></br>  <br> what the fuck was he thinking about when he made the final boss of the series a monster with a demon dragon dick <br>He said that he was ill and under a lot of stress at the time, and regrets that design choice. It was changed for the tankobon.</br></br>  <br>Yuma of all people has the strongest deck of the protagonists, his monsters shit on everything all 4 of them can bring out and then some.<br><br>Where's the justice?</br></br></br>  <br>Embrace the degeneracy, anon. You know you want to.</br>  <br>Have you completely forgotten what Yugi wore in Duelist Kingdom?

How would it have that if it's not beating Magic?</br>  Is there any canon het couple on the YGO franchise?<br>I think the only one is YugixAnzu and only for an interview where Takahashi mentioned Anzu eventually settle down with Yugi after the manga end</br>  <br>I wouldn't go that far, his Xyz are certainly something, but half of the protagonists don't even have updated decks.</br>  <br>YGO had it at one point but Magic overtook it.</br>  <br>Tea looks like she's gonna commit a homicide.</br>  <br> Is there any canon het couple on the YGO franchise? <br>Parents of characters? Yuma and Kotori is probably the 2nd closest you can get.</br></br>  <br>YGO has best selling while MTG has most played. YGO sells way more cards than MTG by quite a lot, but more people do not play it. <br><br>Either way they're still #1 and #2. Hell I think even Hearthstone has passed the Pokemon TCG now.</br></br></br>  <br>Yugioh zexal there was a heteral couple at episode 93 I think,   Also Hopefully Yuya and Yuzu get married  </br>  <br>Yugi doesn't. Judai has Elemental Masked as his deck, Neos will forever be shit, Yusei will have a shit load of stardust stuff and synchron warrior stuff from last year and Yuma is Utopia cancer and gagaga's. He's fine, Yugi fucking needs something, maybe retrained Silent Magician and Swordsman will be enough.</br>  <br>Hetero*</br>  <br>I'm most offended by Yugi being attached to your shitpost</br>  <br>Pokemon is still healthy as a TCG, but it's definitely never going to get to the level of popularity that it had during Gen 1 again.</br>  <br>Do Yusei and his bike and Kaiba and his Blue Eyes count? Because vehicles are usually given female names and Blue Eyes was a girl at one point.</br>  <br> Had a Base 1 Charizard <br> It got stolen </br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, it's healthy, but it's certainly not more popular than YGO like that Anon shitposted about.<br><br>Just wait for the movie, he'll get more.</br></br></br>  <br>It was probably worthless because you were a kid and didn't take care of it anyway.</br>   No hair down Yuzu with Yuya scene <br><br>Why Arc-V?</br></br>  So we've acknowledged that Miyazaki is a giant pedophile, right?<br><br>Pic related is one of the concept sketches from Kiki's Delivery Service.</br></br>  <br>I see nothing wrong with this.</br>  <br>Who cares?</br>  Are you telling me that there are pedophiles in the anime industry?

Now that the season is pretty much over, which series have been the worst and most disappointing for you?  <br>Easy to say Nagato for me. Not like I expected ANYTHING from it, but goddamn there was like 4 cute faces per episode worth watching. The Disappearance arc was suprisingly good, and more of what I wanted.<br><br> I don't know how I made it that far. </br></br></br>  I had high hopes for Yahari. Like I enjoyed the first season a lot. But then this season just fell to pieces.  yahari was just awful  <br><br>definitely dissapointing, but I wouldn't say it's the worst this season</br></br>  <br>True, but it's really the only thing this season I had high hopes for. That and Hibike, and hibike isn't disappointing.</br>  Owari no seraph<br>Yahari<br>FSN s2</br></br>  <br>Punchline and Ninja Slayer. Everyone saying owari no seraph was a disappointment has no one but themselves to blame for not reading the manga first and realizing how much of a trainwreck it would be</br>  <br>2nd cour is going to be even better<br><br> I took 3 pills so I can die and not save anyone <br> lol jk monsters in my veins <br> here I go! <br> Just kidding teammates knocked me out </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> FSN s2 <br>What? The adaption is pretty much perfect.<br>Unless you didn't like the VN itself, but then how would you have expectation in the first place?</br></br></br>  punchline<br>kekkai<br>euphonium</br></br>  <br>every show was disappointing.</br>  Every show seemed to be disappointing one way or another.<br><br>Except for Teekyuu, that was wonderful, as expected.</br></br>  Houkago no Pleiades  <br>sasuga /a/<br><br>No but seriously, the heroic tale of Arslan disappointed me quite a bit, along with Owari No Seraph. I don't know why they made it so... fujobait.<br>OH! That and Hibike Euphonium. Damn Euphonium dropped the ball... hard! Visuals were nice but 90% of my show had me basically yelling at the screen "TALK" but when they did they didn't actually "SAY" anything most of the time. That coupled with some of the weakest drama I've seen in anime. Seriously... Naruto drama was better, and my utter lack of empathy for musicians made that show terrible.</br></br></br></br>  Worst was Denpa Kyoushi without a shadow of a doubt.<br><br>Disappointment is hard. The only ones I came in with any kind of expectation for were second seasons and Plastic Memories. Nisekoi was disappointing compared to season 1 but I already knew that was going to happen. Plastic Memories was flat for a lot of the middle but the ending was fantastic.<br><br>Unlike most of /a/ I really liked Oregairu throughout, the final was a decent lead in to the next volume and I look forward to reading it in LN form.<br><br>I guess I could say I was disappointed in the first parts of Nagato, I liked the Disappearance arc so its more of a retroactive disappointment.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>10 out of fucking 10 im actually triggered</br>  There was a lot of moeblob and female homosexuality this season, so I didn't watch much, but Punchline went all gender-bender on me so late in the anime, so that really killed the show for me.<br><br>I also wanted to watch Mikagura because it seemed like it'd have a lot of awesome action, I liked the design and it seemed wacky so I thought I'd love it. It was just full of yuri undertones, the action wasn't all that good, and it tried to take itself waaaaaay too seriously by ep 3+ so that was also a huge disappointment.</br></br>  Conversely, anons, which show from this season was your favorite? <br><br>If you believe the entire season was terrible, then change that to "most bearable."</br></br>   ore monogatari and soma were AOTS <br><br>I did not expect that.<br><br>I agree that Arslan Senki is a disappointment. The pacing is shit and its boring.</br></br></br></br>   It certainly is a small world <br><br>Who the hell is this guy?</br></br>  <br>I think that's Rin's older brother.</br>   not recognizing adult Waver.

He had perhaps read up on him a bit, not because of Kiritsugu, rather because of Rin, but he only started to see him as something of note after meeting him briefly.<br><br>He could read that Shirou didn't have real talent as a magus after observing him once(This is accurate, Shirou will never be a real magus, he can only be a spell user), that this didn't suit him, so why did he pursue this path of the magus life style.<br><br>All he observed was another fool who challenged the world, like Alexander.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   not recognizing Namikawa Daisuke's voice   <br>I can tell you who it's NOT - Waver.

Not that she ever loved him to begin with, and their team wasn't called Team NTR for no reason, but the part where she tortured him is probably what made most people think of her as kind of a terrible person.</br>  <br>Yup, the manga is guts in cooperated.</br>  <br>Seems fun. <br><br><br> fate primates don't know about the original source </br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean beyond always giving him the cold shoulder and wanting to cut his fucking arm so she could cuck him freely?<br>Also, always being a bitch to him when he complained to Lancer.</br></br>  <br>So what was his legit reason for being with her in the first place?

He raped Sakura and stole Rider to use in the war?<br><br>Okay, let's get this straight. He never fucking raped Sakura. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He fucked Sakura.<br><br>Let me ask you this. WHO IN THE GAME DIDN'T FUCK SAKURA? You can't even name one fucking character who hasn't plugged her loose cunt! She is the kind of bitch who will act like she doesn't want it when she really does. She'll say No! while having multiple orgasms. Shinji knew this, he's a fucking ladies man. He knows what filthy whores like Sakura want.<br><br>And there's this other big bitch you guys have with him. He supposedly stole Rider and used her in the war for his own greed.<br><br>Objection! He was worried about his one and only precious sister. Is keeping your loved ones from a brutal war so wrong? When Shirou does the same thing to Saber it's like 'oh he's so manly', but when Shinji does it it's wrong? He just wanted to protect Sakura. He probably was going to use his Holy Grail wish to tighten her cunt back up or cure her syphilis or something.<br><br>The story was written to make that faggot Shirou look good. Objectively, Shinji is a far better character than Shirou. At least he has the balls to take action decisively instead of dicking around like Shirou, and if he weren't stuck with the weak ass servant Rider and no plothax he probably would have won the war.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> brow beating your rapist into accepting your tender care <br>Best girl.</br></br>    <br> Let me ask you this. WHO IN THE GAME DIDN'T FUCK SAKURA? <br><br>Every time</br></br></br>  <br>I love it.</br>  <br>It's possible if Gilgamesh doesn't take him seriously. Gilgamesh has a real track record for this shit if he underestimates the enemy.<br><br>He's the King of Failures when he doesn't take it seriously, and it was noted Alexander was a strong servant in most rights. Nasu even says he feels like the type of guy that could make for a good rival for the guy that owns everything. After all it was said in the novel he filled the grail when there were still three servants outside of the grail, which led to it interrupting Saber and Archer's fight.<br><br>To be fair though, Gilgamesh also filled the grail in HF when there were still five servants outside of the grail. So he's worth almost twice as much.<br><br>High tier servants are worth the mana of a few servants on their own. A King for a King, because Gilgamesh respected Alexander's will he took the fight seriously, and because of this it was over in seconds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And what's funnier is that it's a legitimate point. Sakura has sex with Shirou, Issei, and Shinji - all the important male characters in her age bracket.</br>  <br><br>The Niconico stream was so much fucking fun</br></br>  <br> Issei <br>Wait, what?</br></br>  <br>Rider was the best servant in zero</br>  <br>Close enough</br>  <br>I knew this would happen as soon as I saw that screenshot.</br>  <br> Issei <br>Nigga what?</br></br>  <br>It gets pretty stupid when people legitimately say these things rather than it just being a joke.<br><br>Issei is gay, he never slept with Sakura, for starters.</br></br></br>  Catching up now. Why is this show so great?  <br> Shirou <br>only in her route, which is what everybody else did too.<br> Issei <br>u wot m8<br> Shinji <br>rape, black mail, etc...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  It would be a shame if Twice and Shirou never did meet in life. They're the same level of broken, went through basically the same thing, but reached a very different answer at the end.  <br>really gay girls</br>    <br><br><br>It's easy to miss since it's glossed over very briefly and Heaven's Feel is so long, but Sakura has sex with Issei shortly before she befriends Shirou (not the long jump incident, I mean two summers ago when she first shows up at his house). She wanted some genuine affection given the terrible abuse Shinji and Zouken heaped upon her, and Issei's a nice guy who she respected and admired. Giving herself to him did nothing but ramp up her self-loathing, though, because it made her feel easy.</br></br></br>    <br>I don't remember this from the game, and I am positive I would remember this.<br><br>When and where is this mentioned?</br></br></br>  <br>It's bad translation-san.<br><br>"This place is small for that".<br><br>He said that the Association wasn't the right place for Shirou to achieve his dream.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop spouting bullshit.</br>  <br> you have to eat all the eggs </br>  <br>Damn, what a slut</br>  <br>Dude what</br>  How did she reach his face?  <br>Killing magus. Raping english maids<br><br>Why not? he's the best</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's the start of the Issei route.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you lying?<br>On the internet? <br><br>Issei is pure as fuck and Sakura only loves Shirou. She got raped the other times. <br><br>Unless you're saying Issei(best boy) is a rapist?<br>FUCK OFF then</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic<br>dont need to explain<br>etc</br></br></br>  <br>So UBW threads were better then?<br> implying memes are a good thing </br></br>  <br>Like this you dumb shit.</br>  <br>She's obviously sitting down as she does it, you can tell by the shoulders and how she's resting on her hand.</br>  <br>But can Rider out-ride JETS?</br>  <br>She clearly wqnted the D</br>  <br>She went to the worm pit that night.</br>  <br>lmao</br>  <br><br> Implying Rider wouldn't rekt his weak-ass shit </br></br>  <br>This will NEVER become a thing, lancelot</br>  <br>This is reaching Milhouse levels of meme.</br>  <br>I dunno, as much as I hate it I think there's a certain threshold beyond which it has officially become a thing</br>  <br> 2 and a half years later <br> Shirou still hasn't figured out I'm Hassan </br></br>    <br>lmao</br>  <br>I nominate Lu Bu for next meme</br>  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br>She just used the Kaleido Stick.</br>    <br>lmao I can't stop giggling at this</br>  <br>Couldn't resist.</br>  <br> Issei <br> Wanting sex from anyone besides Shirou <br>I call rape.</br></br></br>  I can't be the only one who liked Sola, no?  <br>Is SakuraXShinji the best side couple yet, or is that IsseiXAyako?</br>  <br>this is kind of endearing</br>  <br>I'm in love with Sakura so I think Sakura x Shinji is better</br>  <br>She was cute.</br>  <br><br>They need to fix that table.</br></br>  <br>Anyone retarded enough to believe that they're a better king than Uncle Arthur shouldn't be able to operate a blanket, let alone defeat any Knight of the Round Table.<br><br>I nominate Gawain.<br><br> For  ___  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ayako isn't even into men.</br>  <br>She was a pretty capable woman when she wasnt being a complete bitch due to being in love with Lancer.<br>Her entire character was made to bring misery to both Fastwheels and Lancer.

And Shinji never "beat" or "raped" Sakura. Stop spouting memes.</br>  <br>How did she die in the VN again?<br><br>I know he doesn't kill her in the VN.</br></br></br>  <br> VN <br><br>oh you</br></br></br>  Were there ever any fat people in Japan? Is Ufotable perhaps implying something here?  <br>Worm rape is better too.</br>  <br>Kuuru antics were waterd down quite a lot in the anime</br>  <br>There's no VN of Fate/Zero.</br>  <br> VN describes him raping her <br> all these secondaries saying that never happened </br></br>  <br>ufotable is staying true to Takeuchi's old style.</br>  <br>Okay, let's get this straight. He never fucking raped Sakura. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He never did it. He fucked Sakura.</br>  <br>Sakura admits to Shirou that she can't live without the semen of a magus. Shinji was doing her a favour by having sex with her. If he refused to, Zouken would have brought home hairy old mages to fuck Sakura instead.</br>  <br>Because OC was mixed with the baiting so it often got fatefags angry.</br>  So what is the best order to finish the Fate/Stay Night VN and what other material (besides light novels) are there that expand on the story?  <br> fuck without consent <br> not rape <br><br> urobutcher using FSN's bullshit excuse for sex scenes to have sakura be forcefucked to fulfill his sufferingboner <br> not rape </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he raped sakura chan many times and tried to do a highschool massacre and allowed gil to kill a loli and rip her heart out (?).<br>and tried to kill hakuno.</br></br>  <br> Implying people don't truly like Gawain <br>He is best Saber.</br></br>  <br> and tried to kill hakuno <br>Wrong Shinji.</br></br>  <br>Is that from the manga too?? holy fuck.</br>  <br>Fate/Stay Night is linear, so there's no choosing what route you take the orders in. Aside from the main VN, there's also Hollow/Ataraxia (a sequel VN), the Prisa Illya spinoff manga, and a couple of handheld RPGs.</br>  <br>She made it for nine years without Shinji doing anything, it was never necessarily. She never said that she needed it, just that her body yearned for it due to the worms.<br><br>Also Shinji isn't a magus anything, so she's never had magus semen before.<br><br>He has no mana to give her, he has no real anything, he's not and can't be a magus and has no magic. Maybe it was just a very weird pick up line considering she apparently has never had magus semen before.<br><br>"Sempai, I happen to like magus semen, and you seem to be a magus. So.. hint hint".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is from the manga.</br>  <br>alternate reality shinji is still a filthy rapist deep inside.</br>  <br>No, its directly called rape in the story.<br><br>Are you stupid or just reaching? We even have an event in the game where she's fighting back as he's trying to rape her.</br></br></br>  <br> VN describes him raping her <br>Not in RN m8.</br></br>  <br>It's cultural enrichment。</br>  <br>There's only one order:<br>Fate &gt; UBW &gt; HF<br>As for the second question HA and the material should do.<br><br>Well he's just a kid anon. He thought it was a game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think I figured it out</br>  <br>Talking about Sakura sure makes everyone go full retard in every direction.<br><br>It was entirely rape, and he's a rapist, even in RN.</br></br></br>  <br> rape <br> sakura <br>Do I have to bring out the copypasta m8?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Kariya is such a stupid mongoloid, he should have confronted Tokiomi or Aoi about their daughter getting rape by dickworms instead of just vague harping about MUH ENVY</br></br>  <br>Nope not in RN.</br>  <br> RN <br> FSN with the sex parts cut out so people don't scream at the shit story crammed in an eroge <br> worth anything <br><br>"The sight of fakes disgust me."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Talking about Sakura sure makes everyone go full retard in every direction. <br><br>Yeah because she gives us all boners and it makes it hard to concentrate lol</br></br></br>  <br>He wanted to feel like a hero, he thought doing it that way would somehow make Aoi love him.</br>  <br><br>u can turn them on or off as far as I know.</br></br>  <br>Kariya would've avoided this if he didn't abandoned his magus duties in the first place.</br>  <br><br> quoting someone who got BTFO by a faker <br><br>Not the best reference, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>20/20 hindsight anon</br>  <br>Shinji has no active MCs so he can't do magic. But they say in UBW that he does have dormant ones being from a great magus family and all, otherwise he could not be used as the vessel.</br>  <br>How does this even work?</br>  <br>Gawain a shit. His uncle agrees don't bother her about it.</br>  <br>Already posted.</br>  <br>Oh I'm sure getting yourself raped by worms would solve everything.</br>    <br>To be fair, he did seem to take a fancy to Saber.</br>  <br>It would have been a less painful process if he had just gotten wormraped as a child.</br>  <br>seiba  ;_;7 </br>  <br>Sakura wouldn't have been raped by those same worms.</br>  The only time Shinji tried to rape Sakura was the time she killed him. The other times they had sex Sakura allowed it out of pity and to satisfy her wormlust.  <br>Gawain is perfect knight, Arthur agrees</br>  <br> He has no mana to give her, <br><br>WRRROOOOONNNG<br><br>EVERY human has an odic force. That means every human can supply Prana/maryoku in the form of Od. That's why Medea and Dark Sakura drained people at all. It's also how Akiha's plundering and SHIKI's version of the MEoDP work.<br><br>In the VN, it's mentioned how the techniques of the Kamasutra have legitimate thaumaturgical uses as an esoteric text. Sex is powerful and allows bonds to be formed between individuals by which prana can be transferred. Obviously the bodily fluids and whatnot of a Mage have much more to offer than a regular human for all the obvious reasons, but it doesn't mean mundanes have nothing to offer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I always thought it was because he felt like what was happening to Sakura was all his fault (and it was), so he wanted to make things right by himself. That and being exposed to penisworms corrupted him in a way. <br><br>Why does everyone make him sound like some beta cuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is this show so great? <br><br>You just posted the answer</br></br></br>  <br>He could've called the cops but he didn't.</br>  <br><br>That's bullshit but I believe it.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>So other than this, what OC do we have for UBW? I remember several for F/Z like the worm pit and Lancer stealing Gil's weapons, but I don't think we have much for UBW.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter. In RN he doesn't rape her that's all.</br>  <br>He is somewhere out there in the normal universe, and in this world line he probably didn't die in 1999 since the disaster didn't happen this time around.</br>  <br><br>There's Saber watching UBW twitter series.</br></br>  <br>Well in UWB there is a meme past around that Gil could use a  hand . So, there's that.</br>  <br>Dr. Gilgamesh becoming a thing once more.</br>  <br>Shitposting became a very big meme during UBW.</br>  <br><br>But anon, that's UFO's table.<br>Of course it's magical.</br></br></br>    Rhinos were a meme.  <br>How do you pronounce ufotable?</br>  <br>Yūfōtēburu.</br>  <br>ufoteraburu</br>  <br>You foe table.</br>  <br>Do this glaring mistakes get fixed with UFO or not?</br>  <br>You-foe-tabel</br>  <br>it just made me like shinji more</br>  <br> I am the only one who feels like she is enjoying that in some twisted way?</br>  <br>In case you never read the visual novel or HA<br> She is enjoying it. </br></br>  <br>Why? Shinji is fucking awesome, and post UBW he's going to be just like the hilarious Shinji from HA.</br>  <br>She is. <br><br>With how fucked up her self perception was, she never actually hated him. She just saw him going nuts and violent on her as just another piece of the inevitable parade of suffering that is living with Grandpa Zouken (which is not really inaccurate.) It was only after she got a piece of happiness with Shirou that the thought of "Wait, maybe I DON'T have to suffer all this bullshit" arose inside her, so she fought back when Shinji tried to rape her and her pity for him turned into hate for the things that he had done.<br><br>With Shinji having simmered the fuck down after having his pride smashed to bit, Sakura would likely just shrug off their history and just be happy he's back to being the kind of guy he used to be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no respect for anyone (even gil had) <br> thinks he's the best despite not even knowing how to into magus <br> rapes his sister and lets her be raped by worms <br> servant dies early because he's an incompetent fuck (more than everyone else in Cooking/School Night) <br> "fucking awesome" <br>Go to bed, Shinji.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously meant to reply to this </br>  <br>You should read HA.</br>  <br>The scene you are quoting is from UBW RN, where Sakura didn't get raped. Please stop being such a fucking secondary.</br>  <br>Why are you considering RN as a different game? It's just a dumbed down FSN for normalfags.</br>  <br>Because RN is a completely different story from F/SN.</br>  <br> It certainly is a small world <br>He said "this place is certainly too small for that"<br>fucking crunchyroll man</br></br></br>  <br> Shinji Brushing <br> Not "My Shinji Teeth and Me" </br></br>  <br>RN is not the same story, it's a separate canon and It applies to the anime in full force.</br>  <br><br>He looks like Riritsugu with long hair so i would say:<br><br>a) Kiritsugu (even if he is young remember. Magic duh)<br>b) Kiritsugu's real son (because drama)<br>c) Kiritsugu's spirit/ servant/ heroic spirit/ some some other fanfiction shit like that<br><br>But definitely Kiri related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Retard.</br>  <br>Oh shit, it's male Rin?</br>  <br>I can't even tell who's baiting who anymore.</br>  <br>Leave him alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There's nothing wrong with looking into your heart and mind to come up with theories like that!</br>  <br>After seeing how they didn't censor Sakura in F/Z, I'm inclined to believe ufotable is going the movie route to avoid censoring her route.</br>  <br> She made it for nine years without Shinji doing anything, it was never necessarily. <br><br>Byakuya was the one "training" her before Shinji took over. Every man in the Matou household has tasted her at some point. She lost her virginity at 6 years old and has been absorbing cum ever since.</br></br></br>  <br>I was wondering what the fuck he meant by that small world shit<br>That whole conversations seemed weird and just not well-written<br>Waver was being a douchebag  inb4 he's a mage  and it's not like Shirou to just walk off especially to someone the whole association is in love with</br></br></br>  <br> it's not like Shirou to just walk off especially to someone the whole association is in love with <br>That's actually just like him seeing how Kiritsugu didn't really like the association and neither did Archer.</br></br>  <br> Waver was being a douchebag <br>Why were you even under this impression?</br></br>  <br>Yes so what? UBW is based on the RN story.</br>    <br>How far can they go with a movie though?</br>  <br> Waver meant that the Clock Tower was too small for Shirou's ambitions.</br>  <br>They announced it as a "theatrical anime", the same as KnK.</br>  <br>Full Shinji rape with moans.</br>  <br>As far as they want. Have you ever wondered why are OVAs and movies so much more violent than TV anime? <br>I still remember Hellsing Ultimate OVA VII when  they raped Seras' mom's dead corpse. </br></br>  <br>No censoring at all aside from showing genitals. It wouldn't be a first for ufotable either, they showed Fujino's rape already.</br>  <br>Shirou has nothing against magi and no negative view of them. It's Kiritsugu who hated magi, but he largely kept it to himself.</br>  I realy can't wait until the movie comes out and people realise they're adapting RN.<br>The denial is so much stronger than UBW's</br>  <br>On the positive side, we'll have much quicker confirmation than we did with UBW</br>   tsukihime remake <br>is this real life?</br>  <br>Forget about RN, the shitshow that would go down if they only confirmed one move would be unparalleled.</br>  <br>I rewatched it the other morning and caught that, it seemed to deliberate to not be him.</br>  <br>Is this just fantasy?</br>  <br>caught in a landslide</br>  <br>No escape from reality.</br>  <br>RN's HF is utter shit though. Seeing as they're going with theatrical releases instead of another TV series it's likely they'll be doing ACTUAL Heaven's Feel as it was intended by Urobuchi, since they can push it as far as they want with movies/OVAs.</br>  <br> Heaven's Feel as it was intended by Urobuchi <br>You disgust me.</br></br>  <br><br>Didn't Apocrypha end already? Why would it be news about it?   m-maybe there is an anime after all  </br></br>  <br> urobuchi <br>Jesus fucking christ can you go kill yourself already?</br></br>  <br>Maybe they will be talking about how it ended and stuff.</br>  <br>I could honestly see them sorta connecting about both being used for the grail.</br>  <br><br>Sasuga Urobutcher<br><br>Causing such disgust in anons.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cry all you want, you know it's true. I highly dislike Urobuchi, but I dislike RN babbies even more as they pretend the game's story suddenly isn't shit because it's not a porn game anymore. Unfortunately Heaven's Feel reeks of Saya no Uta, as he had just finished doing that when Nasu sucked his dick for help since he can't write for shit.</br></br>  <br>Urobochi didn't write the original HF. What are you talking about?</br>  <br><br>I mean LN.</br></br>  <br><br> Butcherfags </br></br>  <br>Nasu and Urobuchi have been friends forever so he's probably implying that Urobuchi wrote it all and Nasu took credit for it<br>Either way he's an idiot.</br></br>  <br>HF was 100% written by Nasu.</br>  <br> swords guy <br>fuck you anon my sides can't take that kind of punishment.</br></br>  <br> RN babbies pretend the game's story suddenly isn't shit because it's not a porn game anymore. <br>You are fucking delusional<br>No such people exist</br></br></br>  <br><br>IIRC, a lot of the ideas for it were suggested/set up by him, as he was Nasu's buddy during that time. Either that or Sakura's life, I remember it being in some interview in a magazine but I honestly can't remember which and I'm almost falling asleep on my computer, which doesn't help.<br><br>Nasu's a retard but I'd never imply he steals people's credits.</br></br></br></br>  <br> RN babbies even more as they pretend the game's story suddenly isn't shit because it's not a porn game anymore <br><br>Actually it was better with the porn.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about? F/Z came out almost 2 years after F/SN and that was only the first volume. He wasn't involved in F/SN. If you are talking about Lovecraftian horror, KnK written in the late 90s already had elements of that.<br><br>Not to mention Nasu has clearly a better understanding of what makes Lovecraft horror stories work as well as they do.</br></br></br>  <br>There are people who specifically chose RN just because it has no porn materials? What the shit?</br>  <br>You remember wrong.</br>  How do they managed to fit an entire magical university into the Parliament Building?<br><br>If they have frat parties, do they annoy the PM?</br></br>  <br>Bounded field.</br>  <br><br><br>At first I was like, "lol look at this silly faggot he made a mistake"<br><br>and then I remembered that Romeo's Cross+Channel, Urobuchi's Saya no Uta, and Nasu's Heaven's Feel ALL got their inspiration from Meteo's Kusarihime ~Euthanasia~, and all of these artists were in contact with one another during this time.<br><br>It's not impossible for Nasu and Urobuchi to have spoken in great depth during this time, especially considering they were already doing interviews together...<br><br>But naw, HF's prose still reeks of Nasu, even in the original Japanese. Urobuchi could have very well had an influence, though, especially since he FUCKING LOVES RAPE (what a hero).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what fucked up shit you somked but in an interview after the fact Uro asked what Nasu was going for in terms of romance and the development of the heroines in HF and how it tied to the thematic elemens of F/SN as a whole. He wouldn't ask that if he gave him the ideas.</br>  <br>He doesn't love rape more than he loves suffering and having purity and innocence taken away from you tops the chart of suffering.</br>  <br>But he implied that Urobutcher wrote it.<br>See:<br>Especially this bit right here:<br> they'll be doing ACTUAL Heaven's Feel as it was intended by Urobuchi <br>That implies much more than brainstorming ideas.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In that very same interview they say "oh we got inspired by the same thing without knowing!" So no, that's pretty much out of the question.</br>  <br>You know he probably can do magic now actually since his circuits got opened by the grail.<br><br>So he can go to the worm room now, shit sakura's happy that he now has to go through that when he gets back</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit. I'm gonna have to give this a Fucking Seriously/10 because of everyone who actually got caught.</br></br>  <br>Fuck, this was it. I couldn't remember the relations or something. I know there definitely was an interview where Nasu and Gen talked about Heaven's Feel and they both agreed on fucking up Sakura. There's another one way later where Nasu says Gen fucked her up more in FZ also.<br><br><br>I implied too much, that's true. It's really late and the fact that it has so much in common with SnU AND both Nasu and Gen worked together always makes gets me confused.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That would work if he had any circuits to begin with.</br>  <br> Shinji <br> rape <br>???</br></br></br>  <br>It was explicitly stated in the anime, and Nasu is in charge of the anime.</br>  <br>Did you miss that the grail needed circuits in the first place, so it used shinji's dormant ones</br>  <br>You're still wrong though, they never talked about Sakura during development of HF. <br><br>The interviews before and after imply they were working on their own and got surprised at how much they got inspired by the same VN.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never hate Nasu so much that you would be in denial about Nasu writing his own works because you actually enjoyed it <br><br>Feels good.</br></br></br>  <br> But he implied that Urobutcher wrote it. <br><br>Yeah, I still think that's fucking wrong. I was just saying there's a place they could have gotten it from.<br><br><br><br>Oh? I don't recall that specificity. Could you point the line out to me?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've come to post twintails and to announce today's update. Also, I recommend preparing heart medication for next week's update.   /a/ doesn't love twintails anymore <br><br>How are threads on /m/?</br></br>  b-but, as long as we love twintails...    <br>I had made the last handful of them on /m/ but haven't since the last one I made got deleted, no one else has since.</br>  <br>rip<br><br>Are there any volumes completely translated other than Vol.1?</br></br></br>  a pouting tail red is good too  <br>Can't be helped. There's not going to be much discussion material for the threads until I reach the latter half of the first chapter either though I suspect that what happens in the next part might trigger a few threads.<br><br><br>Nein and it'll be a while till there's going to be another.</br></br></br></br>  Best girl  <br> being that deluded </br>  <br> having a different opinion </br>  Threadly reminder that there's such a thing as TOO flat and Aika was it.  <br>You're gonna get splatted son</br>  <br>Too flat is perfection.</br>   "Oh no~ Summer vacation starting tomorrow has been on my mind so much that I completely forgot to wear panties today... Ah, excuse me Souji-sama but I seem to accidentally dropped my eraser under the table!" <br><br>I miss these people.
