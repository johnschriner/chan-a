Ending was satisfactory, but the overall show was still shit.   ignored the show since day 1, because fuck "hurr an ep every 2 weeks" <br> now can watch through it in one go </br>  I'm amazed you made it through the end. Congratulations.   Chibi Usa goes off to help Sailor Moon <br> Other senshi mention that they should probably go with her <br> Queen just shakes her head "no" <br><br>Inner senshi get shafted yet again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm amazed myself. I wanted to drop it halfway through the first cour, I stuck with it because I wanted to fully see how the adaptation would turn out. <br><br> "We got close to a perfect adaptation of the manga so what is there to complain about?" <br><br> I fucking hate MAL.</br></br></br></br></br>    Knew when I saw ep 1 it would be a pale shadow of the original. Both openers have exactly the same plot but direction/cinematography of the original is miles ahead.      <br>Now that Crystal has ended, maybe in another 20 years we will get the reboot that Sailor Moon deserves. It can still follow the manga plot but with some elements or allusions to the 1992 anime plus the seramyu and tokusatsu which in itself was following the manga plot but differed later on.</br>      <br> another 20 years <br><br>Everything about that would be fine but I just don't want to wait another 20 years for it.</br></br></br>      <br>Rejoice, at least your children can watch it.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br>        <br>If it did happen, by the time it came out my children would probably be too old to give a shit.</br>      why did this turn out so shit but dragon ball super turned out good?  <br>No idea. Toei dropped the ball on this and Saint Seiya.</br>  <br><br>Because Toei doesn't give a shit about any properties other than Dragon Ball.</br></br>  <br>That's why Tri will fail. I already lost all hope for it when it turned from tv series to movie series.</br>  What arcs did the anime cover, put the show on hold around ep 10 because the directing got very bad and the pacing got shit on hard.  <br>Dark Kingdom and Black Moon. Don't bother watching the rest though.</br>  <br> It's finally over. <br>There is a "See you soon" at the end and a planed announcement though</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Hey, were these characters in the show? Cool.</br></br></br></br>  At least the Black Moon arc was better as a whole. Black Lady is still best girl.  <br>Crystal is an ONA. It has a lower budget. DBS is on tv with a higher budget.</br>  <br>When is this announcement supposed to be?</br>  <br><br>They haven't said. It'll probably be a few weeks or months.</br></br>  I don't get it. The director, producer, and composer had all done great things before (and even together, with Suite Precure.)<br><br>It has to have been some sort of higher-up decision to make the show the way it was. Probably the same people who decided to make Tri into a handful of movies and give DBS a hundred fucking episodes.</br></br>  <br>This man. I liked it, and it made me like Chibiusa more than I did before from watching the old show and reading the manga</br>  Venus and Tuxedo Mask were literally the only likable characters in this mess.  <br>they got shafted the whole time in this show<br><br>not even the 90s show did that as bad as crystal</br></br></br>  <br>Missed out on the announcement of a planned announcement, but yes I was aware of the "see you soon" at the end. When I said "it's finally over" I was referring to the fact that this travesty of a show was over...for now and whether a second season was coming was up in the air based on what I had read earlier. The rumor I read that a second season was in the works was called a mistake at the time. I guess that is not the case now.</br>  <br> ONA <br> Lower budget <br><br>No excuse. There are other ONAs that were produced in the past that look way better than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think toei is focusing on DBS so their budget has to shift <br>when they finish that you can bet sailor moon crystal s will come</br></br>  Were there any songs at all other than the OP and ED?<br><br>By this time in the original series, we had insert songs like Ai no Senshi, Eien no Melody, Koibito ni Hanarenai Kedo, etc.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much just run of mill background music and for more dramatic moments they played a children's choir.</br>  My dream would be to see a 90's style Sailor V anime.<br>I think expanding the story would work as well as it did with the 90's anime.</br>  <br>why was the background in crystal so lame and unispirsing <br><br>the original series upbeat 90s jazz and pop sounding music were great <br><br>why couldnt they hire back that composer?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he's dead</br>  but he is a skull in every other iteration    Finally the show which don't exist ended.  <br>Doubt it. It seemed as if Toei didn't even want this remake. They probably hoped fans would forget about the anime and shat out the cheapest possible series to calm them down at the end. Toei only cares about currently hyped endless series, sadly.</br>  <br>the constant delays should have tipped us off really</br>  <br>Does it even make sense for them to do s2? I guess s1 sold like 50 BDs or something. Or did the ONA have high ratings?</br>  <br>It had more than 2k preorders before the show even came out. They didn't lose money on it, but yeah there really is no reason to make an S2.</br>  <br><br><br>If Toei put more work into it, by the time they got to Stars, people would be asking them to adapt the musicals, Sailor V, or new story arcs.<br>They really goofed on what could have been their greatest cash cow of the decade.<br>I still hope Toei finishes it though. It would be more of a disappointment to end after the Black Moon arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  i only watched the first 13, was the show in its entirety worse than the original sailor moon?  <br>It's supposed to be more like the manga.</br>  <br>Oh God. Oh God what is that. <br>This is a frame from Crystal? Jesus Christ I'm so glad I dropped it early.</br></br>  <br>yeah i know i read the manga but its not necessarily better</br>  <br><br>All Crystal did was show just how flawed the manga really is. The shittenou got an even worse treatment in it.</br></br>  <br>Fuckin' joke's on you, mate</br>    lor<br> All Crystal did was show just how flawed the manga really is. <br><br>Thank you. This, right fucking here. Naoko Takeuchi and her publishers were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.</br></br></br>  <br>If Sailor Moon Crystal had been released today without the history of the 90's anime, the manga, and all the nostalgia that goes along with it to back it up, it would have came and went with barely a blip on anyone's radar.</br>  <br><br>I posted both of these, I just had more to add.</br></br>  <br>Ayyy</br>  Which Sailor Senshi takes it in the ass the best?  <br>Toei just wanted the keep the rights to the Sailor Moon anime which was in danger of expiring.</br>  <br>Mars.</br>  <br>Do you really have to ask.</br>  <br> no La Soldier <br> Act 26: shit <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KDy<wbr>59hBJ-Cw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you for making me want to read more Black Dog doujins. <br/></br>  Did  Luna's human form  show up again since that episode?  <br>Not in anime, but in manga during Dream arc (Super S of original anime) all cats show up in their human forms.</br>  They even gave her the wrong brooch.

Quit spouting it everywhere.</br></br>  <br><br>Heartcasuals please go.</br></br>  <br>I think it was because the Crystal anime was trying to see if they can do something with it but decided in the end to trash it because it would take a lot of rewriting and they don't have the time and budget for it. Takeuchi always said that there were plotlines she wanted to do but wasn't able to do due to time constraints with the manga. The SeraMyu musicals did play with some of the plotlines I heard. <br><br>Maybe if Toei didn't treat the franchise like a red-headed stepcousin and gave it the SM franchise the treatment it deserved, we wouldn't regret how bland Crystal turned out to be.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He is half right that Toei did want to prevent losing the IP property of the anime because they were still making bank from memorabilia and re-releases of the 1992-96 anime. Takeuchi would probably on the verge of suing them until they threw a little bit of money for the budget to keep her happy and not cut into their funds. They weren't interested in marketing it to anyone other than the 25-35 year old women who grew up on PSSM.</br></br>  Wait, why did they only made classic, R and no S onwards.  Crystal looked so bad honestly. Liked I know it's based more off the manga but I read the damn manga and in my opinion it was drawn very cute and pretty. Usagi was willowy not a bug eyed spaghetti beast. Crystal seriously took whatever life was in Sailor Moon and sucked it out with shit animation , shit pacing , and shit characterization. Compared to the 90's anime I'm aware the manga wasn't as fleshed out but still it had more vitality than this crap. I honestly wouldn't have minded if it looked more like pic related. At least that looks like it could be fun.   No outer senshi <br><br>okay</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0Cu<wbr>A1ov1-Pk</wbr>  [ ]  <br> wanting the outer senshi to be desecrated in Crystal too <br>Thank god they were saved by not appearing in the first two arcs.</br></br>  <br>If you were nearly 1000 years old, you would have a hard time remembering everything you did as a teenager.</br>  <br>True.

NQS and King Endymion seem to act like the stuff with the Black Moon and future villains never happened to them UNTIL it happen in the main time line... (ie. The events of the original series -&gt; time jump of peace -&gt; crystal tokyo with no events of R, S, SuperS or Stars happening) almost like they're from an alternate future and yet events in the past (current manga time) directly affect the future.<br><br>Like with NQS's weapon, she only just gets the Spiral Heart Moon Rod there at the end of Black Moon and yet if her future followed the direct timeline of the entire manga, she should already have her Eternal Tiare from the end of Stars.<br><br>Basically, Naoko made it up as she went along and didn't look that far into the future with properly connecting the past-future.</br></br></br></br></br>  Which senshi has best butt?  <br>I like how there's different music depending on who's singing and they're dancing to their own "theme" at the beginning.</br>    <br> exclusive at hhtp://shitty hentai sitedotcom <br><br>Why is this still a thing?</br></br></br>  <br>This is the kind of thing Crystal could have explained better.<br><br>There are a lot of "mysteries" in the manga.<br>One is what the "Pets" are in Sailor V. I think they're from Mau and other animal planets, but there's no evidence of that. They get 3 chapters and it's never explained where they're from or why they're collecting energy. They're probably connected with Stars somehow, since Naoko wrote the chapters at the same time.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> both parents have blue eyes <br> mother is a blonde <br> father has black hair <br> grandmother has blue hair <br> grandfather and uncle have light brown looking hair <br> come out with pink hair and red eyes </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Queen Serenity and Neo Queen Serenity are different people, and Pluto dying from stopping time is probably the same as Usagi dying if she uses the power of the Silver Crystal too much.</br></br>  <br> not a single lewd leg or ass cheek shot of her unlike the others <br>Prude apologetic shit, that's what Crystal is.</br></br>  <br>considering that they were fucking with us for 2 fucking years before they actually started the damn thing and showed that damn image, yeaaaaaaah i dont see a continuation anytime sooner.<br><br>this was a fuckolossal disaster</br></br></br>  <br>All for a rabbit pun</br>  <br>Usagi </br>    <br><br><br>On those lines, if the originally planned Sailor V anime had been made, the exact same thing would apply.<br><br>The only reason Sailor Moon as such exists is because Toei wanted to create their own sentai maigcal girl show and took the opportunity to ride on the back of the name of Takeuchi's Sailor V when its anime never panned out. While Naoko's manga technically came first, it was never the reason for the genesis of the series proper or the success of the original show, which would have been spawned in an alternate form anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Oh god it would be such a delicious trainwreck if it had come to fruition. I would seriously pay cash to get the pilot to show up somewhere.</br>    <br>You should give the new musicals a go.</br>  Did ShitennouxSenshi happen?  So it's pretty much confirmed that the original &gt; crystal right?  <br>Been that way since like episode 6.</br>    I know the art made it terrible, but it was much more than that. What do you think it was that bad it shit?  I can not get enough of these Babies and manchildren who thought sailor moon crystal is bad. Stop being such a bitter nerd that you have to loudly profess your dislike for something that, by the way, doesn't affect your life at all???? wow whoa???? Keep crying tears about how this series pales to the ~original~, I've taken off my rose-tinted glasses long ago and look ahead towards what the future holds.    <br> It can still follow the manga plot but with some elements or allusions to the 1992 anime plus the seramyu and tokusatsu <br><br>You have no idea how hard my boner is for that idea. I cum buckets just thinking about how awesome something like that actually being made would be. It would BTFO of all other anime pretty much by default.</br></br></br>  So this was supposed to follow the manga but then the show only ends half way through it? What the fuck bullshit! I was waiting to see Chibi Chibi and Sailor Cosmos.   the animation was never this   good <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lXh<wbr>-u9MuEmE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>So the abomination is finally dead. Rest in peace once more, Sailor Moon. Now to focus our energy on forgetting this ever happened, just like Drunker than Hobo.</br>  I cant' wait for the fixed designs in the BDs. Because they will be fixed, right?  Wait, is Pluto dead and not coming back? I wanted a happy ending.  <br>watching sailor shit.</br>  Second part was much better than the first at least. <br><br><br><br>Well it's very dated and hasn't aged well.</br></br></br></br>    <br> It seemed as if Toei didn't even want this remake <br>Gee I couldn't tell with this WONDERFUL animation quality</br></br>  <br>Honestly, only having to see it raped a couple times a month was better. I bet you drop it after episode 4 trying to marathon it.</br>     Hotaru is waifu since forever <br> just want to see her animated and an animated transformation <br><br>Game transformation doesn't count.<br><br>Was there a reason the old anime didn't animate Hotaru properly? They cut her out of SuperS and other things then just had her back for a moment in Stars.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The staff literally didn't know what was going on during SuperS for a schedule problem so Ikuhara and the team improvised, what mean more sexual innuendo, surreal imaginery, bizarre humor and other shit Ikuhara loves. Stars was mess from the beginning to the end and nobody mattered except for Usagi and the starlights, especially Seiya</br>  So there's really only 26 total episodes in Crystal and covers both the Dark Kingdom and Black Moon arcs? I'm watching the original and there's about 90 episodes between the two arcs. What gives? Is there no character development at all?  <br>It took a few months to make a new manga chapter, so there were a lot of episodes in between. Crystal is one episode per chapter.</br>  <br>They had to make a lot of filler while waiting for the manga to move. That filler is so damn worth it though as you are probably seeing already since it really helps really establish the characters and the anime staff managed to have subplots and such going on.<br><br> Is there no character development at all? <br><br>For anyone not named Usagi, Mamoru, and Chibiusa (with Pluto getting some focus), pretty much. The other 4 girls basically lose all their character after becoming guardians.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> still no Sailor V animu <br> no Super/SuperS/Stars remake <br>disappointment.jpg</br></br></br>  <br>Sailor V needs an anime.</br>  <br><br>There is a Sailor V anime though.</br></br>    Who /dropped/ here.<br><br>I stopped watching as soon as mars hit the building and never looked back.<br><br>I got best senshi and that was good enough for me.</br></br></br></br>  How do I get through Sailor Moon R? I want to enjoy it but it's somehow not nearly as entertaining as the first season.<br><br>Maybe the 9 month break since I last saw an episode will help.</br></br>  <br> I got best senshi <br>She's not showing up for quite a few more episodes.</br></br>   tfw the original sailor moon is still better, even if it looks like shit   <br>looks better than crystal</br>    <br>Dropped mid episode 2. I couldn't take the soulless animation. Even the manga had goofy faces, why couldn't SMC have any??</br>  <br>It got some during the Black Moon arc. They looked really out of place though.</br>  <br>Nah, this is done. Sailor Moon goes back to sleep probably for good. If they couldn't attract a new audience, why bother?</br>  <br>Stick with it, it picks up after the alien arc, then you have the God tier S to look forward to</br>  <br>Pretty fucking much.</br>  I think Toei will surprise us.  <br>Surprise us with a quality presentation for S, SuperS, and Stars arcs? I would love to see that. <br><br>I would even forgive them for giving Sailor Saturn an actual transformation sequence as well.</br></br></br>  <br>please no more</br>      PRUDE SHIT<br>R<br>U<br>D<br>E</br></br></br></br>    <br>Yes and it was terrible.</br>  can shiki kill sailor moon  <br> over <br>didn't they announce another 2 cour?</br></br>  <br>They meant the Black Moon arc would be on TV.<br>I hope Toei finishes the next 3 arcs and Sailor V too.</br></br>  I liked it okay, I just wish the animation didn't jump around from alright to pure shit.<br><br>The very last episode ends with "See you soon" and they've announced that they're making an announcement. So it may yet be continued. If it is I hope like hell they do a better job on the next season. So much wasted potential.</br></br>  <br> Sailor V <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Ugh yes.</br>  <br>Definitely.<br><br>Crystal is a nice little treat. I mean as shitty as it was in spots I still appreciate that it was made. But it can in no way be compared to the original series.</br></br></br>  <br>-the horrible animation<br>-the stupid 1 episode ever 2 to 3 weeks<br>-the fact that they only spent one 22 minute episode per entire manga chapter so that the story had to be rushed through so fast you barely have time to comprehend what the fuck just happened<br>-the fact that they damn near don't even let them fight because the budget is just too tight for all that animation<br>-the fact that they lose virtually every fight<br>-the fact that they decided to shoehorn in a stupid "MARS MERCURY VENUS AND JUPITER WERE IN LOVE WITH JAEDITE, NEPHRITE, ZOISITE AND KUNZITE" subplot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh man I didn't even realize the show was being made the same time the manga was. I see why there was so much filler now but yeah definitely worth it. I love all the characters' personalities and personal stories.</br></br>  <br> announced that they're making an announcement <br>I love when they do this. I hope the announcement will be  about how they're going to make an announcement later, because yo dawg I herd u like announcements </br></br>    <br>Aha I just watched that episode. I actually liked the alien arc but it's become almost tedious to watch during the Black Moon arc. As  mentioned, I at least have S to look forward to!</br>  Just a reminder that the toku did a better job with the story than Crystal<br><br> No seriously, if you haven't watched it, you should. It's really damn good. </br></br>  <br>why didn't the toku get a second season :( they would've done such a good job with R</br>  <br>Didn't it kind of totally end? It had like two epilogues or something. It was going in a different direction in the manga anyway</br>  Can I just say that Crystal's version of Jupiter is fucking awful.<br><br>I mean, I know most of them are bad but it hurts especially with Makoto</br></br>  <br>what?</br>  <br><br><br>the chick that played usagi was really uncute</br></br></br>    Remember when the first images of this crap series came out and looked like shit, and every SailorFags defend it like "No! it will look good when animated!". Where are they now?  <br>I thought the first key visual looked really nice but only as a pretty key visual. I didn't think it would actually look like that in the series and man did it not work</br>  <br> How do I get through Sailor Moon R? I want to enjoy it but it's somehow not nearly as entertaining as the first season. <br><br>R is the one season where I'd honesty recommend just skipping half the episodes, you can come back later if you are really curious. The show picks up several episodes from now and gets progressively better as you get through S, which ends up surpassing everything else so far.<br><br> Maybe the 9 month break since I last saw an episode will help. <br>I understand. I did the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought the first key visual looked really nice <br><br>Same here, that actually got my hopes up.</br></br></br>    <br>Crystal did get the long hyperextended fingers correct.</br>    <br> It's finally over. <br><br>I've still got 12 episodes to watch  soon. </br></br></br>  I'm a bit surprised to see this thread still alive.  <br>The previous Sailor Moon general was up for a few days. Both have lasted longer than a majority of the threads I watch on /a/.</br>  <br> Great moments in Sailor Moon Crystal </br>  <br> There was a lottery for tickets to a Sailor Moon concert <br> Theatre full of little girls <br> "Hey, do you want to appear on one episode of Sailor Moon?" <br> Little girls see Minako fainting, probably dying <br>Sasuga Toei</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss the good ol' fanservice of the 90's</br>  K-On on motorcicles. Last season KyoAni was sponsored by Yamaha, next by Suzuki.

They won't announce anything at that day. I'll continue dying on the inside.</br>  Fucking Hamster  Gainax makes a deal with Subaru. They make a show that is better than TTGL in hype and madoka in story. Noone gives a shit, calls it a car commercial.<br>Kyoani does the same and produces garbage.

Jesus Christ /a/, and you say Nips have shit taste.</br>  <br>Pleiades was shit and boring as fuck.</br>  <br> They make a show that is better than TTGL in hype and madoka in story <br>They out-edged the urobotcher?<br> Noone gives a shit <br>Good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I thought too. I can't really read moon yet but there was no mention of a studio whatsoever.</br>  <br>this</br>  Rolling Girls is cuter though  ITT: people will actually defend the making of another show they've seen 100 times, with the same 3 girls doing slightly different things from last time.<br><br><br>because warping through space and parallel universes is shitty compared to your Kyoanus recycled shows<br><br> only watched ova <br> try and comment on the show <br>Also putting motorbikes in your show just makes the advertising worse.<br><br> implying another fucking kyoani show is going to be any better or worse than the last <br> implying gainex didn't outdo all of their old works with Pleiades. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what a sad fuck you are.</br>  <br>I watched 3 episodes, and it was random cute Magical Girl, it didn't really have anything special. To compare it with Madoka or even TTGL is an insult to those two.<br><br>Now go back to your shit taste lair.</br></br></br>  <br>This show is months from airing and you're already jealous and crying about how you think it'll be more well liked and popular than your show is.<br><br>Insecure much?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they killed the girls off in fourth episode. Would easily top madoka.</br>  <br>I think Pleiades is better understood as part of a campaign to get girls into STEM than as a car commercial.<br><br>All the magic is physics. The show could have been a segment in the reboot of Cosmos with Neil DeGrasse Tyson.<br><br>I'm not saying Subaru wouldn't mind selling some cars. But I'm pretty sure they wrote off the show as "educational outreach" not advertising.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Didn't really have anything special <br><br>How is Magical Girls in outer space not special?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's like saying 'I watched 3 episode or TTGL and it was just the same stupid mech bullshit you always see, what the fuck it wasn't as hype as you guise said.'</br>  <br> complain people are shitting on Pleiades without having watched it <br> proceeds to shit on Bakuon without having read it <br><br>hue</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Madoka was all about killing cute girls with cute magical things <br>That's why /a/ will always remain a shit hole.</br></br>  <br>I marathoned it after seeing this pic in a thread a few days ago and it was incredibly boring, the only thing worthy was the beach episode.</br>  <br> They out-edged the urobotcher? <br>has edgy still a meaning or are people shouting it at every occasion as a general word for something they do not like?</br></br>  <br>No that's stupid. TTGL was clearly different from the start and all. I personally think its fame is overblown but by no means I would consider it lower than a CMGDCMT. <br><br><br> episode 3 <br> lewds everywhere <br>At least, they know their viewers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No it was obviously a magical girl nukige adaptation with the porn cut out, with goethe's quote written on the wall, so deep</br>  <br>This is the headline:<br> アニメ化も決定してる漫画『ばくおん！！』仕様の公式痛バイクが発売決定<wbr>！　</wbr> <br> An anime for the "Bakuon!!" manga has been green-lit!! An itasha-bike has also been announced! <br><br> 京アニが作れば <br> If KyoAni made this... <br><br> 京アニ待ってるぞ <br> KyoAni, I'm waiting <br><br> 京アニでやれ <br> I want KyoAni to do it <br><br> 京アニだと信じている <br> I believe KyoAni's got this. <br><br> 京アニとか言ってる奴寒いな <br> People who are saying "KyoAni's got this" are cold </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hipster(s) upset because neither /a/ nor japan gave a single damn about their shitty show   <br>You are right here, and I shouldn't have directly my shitposting towards the show specially because it hasn't even aired, and I have't read the manga.<br>My problem is with /a/ who hops on the kyoanus bus no matter what is made, and even when using the same advertising/collaboration methods, they won't bat an eye at kyo but not even gainax is allowed to do this without being shit on. It just proves again that /a/ has shit taste.</br></br>  <br><br>Well maybe it wasn't for you then, I thought the space stuff was amazing. Seeing them go further and further every episode was great and the final with the last fragment in a black hole was great.</br></br>  <br>Everybody has shit taste but me.</br>  Who Rin here?  <br> 京アニが作れば <br> 京アニ待ってるぞ <br> 京アニだと信じている <br>Thanks anon but I hadn't read the comments, and I can at least understand that much without the need for translation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So just changing the place where a series takes place is enough for it to be original? So if K-On was to be remade in outer space while maintaining the same plot you would appreciate it? What a shitty opinion anon.</br>  Also, the main reason nobody gives a shit about pleiades is because it's het.  <br> The Bakuon storyboards are fake <br> Kyoani is going to make the VEG anime <br>What I'm supposed to believe?</br></br></br>  How many chapter are translated?<br>I couldn't found up to 16.</br>  Protip: kyoanus ain't going to animate bakuon, the manga actually has some action.  <br>most will go for sex hair</br>  <br><br>You really should relax anon. I liked HnP, but trying to force it on people who probably won't like it, on top of shitting on a show that isn't even out yet is completely retarded. <br>HnP is just a straight magical girls show and it's good at what it does, but not everyone like that genre.</br></br></br>   One person posts b8 <br> Entire thread is thrown off track <br> No one talking about cute girls or motorcycles <br>As expected of a Kyoani thread. Also, the article doesn't even confirm that they're making this, people in the comments are just speculating that they'll be behind the adaptation.<br><br><br>Sex hair is best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying KyoAni can't animate whatever they want. <br>And honestly if you think Baku-On had hard action scenes outside of the racing chapter then you're a shitposter who hasn't read the manga.</br></br>  <br><br>Onsa is fine too.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>The comparison with Madoka is apt inasmuch as Pleiades is a show which uses a mahou shoujo settai to tell a story which is unfamiliar to the genre. Madoka is about young girl's grief. Pleiades is about a young girl's casual encounters with science.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sex hair <br> :&gt; <br>  some /ss/ action <br>Best girl confirmed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>TTGL wasn't different at the start, it had nothing that made me want to keep going past episode 2. And I'll never watch it knowing how stupidly over the top it goes without a good enough explanation. At least Pleiades will explain the laws of physics, before they breaks those laws with magic.<br><br>It just bothers me that people shit on Pleaides for being a 'car commercial' without trying it, but will love any Kyoani show, no matter how recycled it is.</br></br></br>  Will this be like a good version of Rolling Girls?  <br>I'd prefer an anime about the Top Gear crew roadtripping Japan, meeting all kinds of strange anime shit along the way.</br>  <br>But people shit on HnP because it is uninspiring. It's a rehash of an old formula that /a/ doesn't really like outside of few notable exceptions. On the other hand /a/ loves SoLs and guess what KyoAni is great at? Many people really wanted a Gainax revival with HnP but they are still dead and they should be for their uninspiring rehashes.</br>  <br> It just bothers me that people shit on Pleaides for being a 'car commercial' without trying it, but will love any Kyoani show, no matter how recycled it is. <br><br>And you're doing the same thing with a show that isn't even out and might not even be done by Kyoani.<br><br>Just fuck off, nobody likes a hypocrite</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>was riding motorcycles actually relevant in Rolling Girls?</br>  <br>We've already established that this is the standard mode of discourse. Maybe you're the one who should bow out.</br>  <br>I have watched plenty of Kyoani shows to know what he makes is generally shit. I already stated that I was specifically not talking about this show, but Kyoani in general.</br>  <br>It's still shit</br>  <br>Sexhair is sex, but Rin is the cutest.</br>  <br>I heard that the Kyoani storyboard image for this was fake, but where was that confirmed?</br>  <br>Please don't shitpost using HnP.</br>  <br>Funnily enough, that was what HnP inspired me: boredom. It was the moeblob girls doing magical things while not defending against a big bad guys who somehow outsmarts them everytime. <br>I won't tell you TTGL is a super great anime, because it clearly went off tracks after the stupid as fuck timeskip, but it was a very fun ride from episode 1 to Genome's defeat. And they did some explanation in TTGL too. Just a little late tho.<br><br><br>Madoka is about young girls trapped by the cruelty of a world that is beyond them, and their desperate struggle against fate itself. It used magic in a very unique way: the "once you go black, you can never go back" way. Every element of PMMM served to maintain a carefully thought-out vicious circle with no laws whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This thread isn't even about KyoAni shitposter-kun. KyoAni aren't going to animate this. Chances are it's either Satelight or Dogakobo.<br>And on the topic of KyoAni they didn't do a single bad show and they have sold more BD copies than your favorite studio ever will (Unless you're a Sunrise and Gainax fag at the same and then you're just pure cancer).</br></br>  When will get an anime about cute girls starting a kart racing team and working their way to F1 like Capeta but all girls?  <br> K-on on motorcycles <br>Rolling girls S2?</br></br>  <br>well they used them to get from A to B</br>  <br> KyoAni aren't going to animate this. <br>What makes you think that?<br>There have been rumors going on for a while now that Kyoani is going to anime this, before the anime adaptation was even announced.<br><br>Aren't they the most likely studio to anime this based on the information we have?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> My problem is with /a/ who hops on the kyoanus bus <br><br>God, kill yourself faggot. <br>You're talking as if you have the right to tell other people what they have to like or talk about.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   inb4 a bunch of weebs crash and die on their ninja 300s <br><br>Educate yourself on motorcycle safety before making the decision to buy a bike. MSF courses are fun and cheap!<br><br>-love /o/</br></br></br></br>  <br>The 'rumors' were largely jokes because of the tank covers resembling K-on's.</br>  Have some delicious fake storyboards.<br> Reminder that the key to kyoani magic is scheduling and not budget. </br>  <br>Because something like Bakuon doesn't require a full staff to not do anything but work on it for more than 5 months in a row. And their next anime required that from the guys and gals in AnimeDo. So yeah I'm ruling KyoAni out of it because they really can't do multiple projects at the same time.</br>  KyoAni found a way yet again  <br>Kyoani can't animate something this lewd.</br>  <br>Obviously the stakes in PMMM are higher than they are in HnP. Once you get past that, they are really very similar shows. They each have a similarly unified design and thorough execution.</br>  Last shitpost, sorry for the derail.<br><br>Pleaides was an extremely fun ride from the start, but I supposed you have to be into the genre first to be able to really get into it. Mecha has never been my thing and any 'explanation' of various parts in Gurran Laggan just sound ridiculous and make me not want to watch it.<br><br>OP started with Kyoani, I'll shitpost about Kyoani if I want, but I did assume they would make it.  I hope Godakobo doesn't pick this up. <br>And are you implying that sales means everything? The popularity just means that it's target audience is big and that it hits it's target audience. Kyoani doesn't take chances and instead just remakes the same show with cute girls doing _blank_ things because they know it will sell time and time again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've already animated the lewdest thing ever.<br>They can do that for sure.</br></br>  <br>God I hope you actually rot in hell for using a cite show like HnP for shitposting.<br><br>What's full nudity in Amagi Brilliant Park?</br></br></br>  If the first season covers the first 3 volumes then we won't get to see Azusa 2.0  <br> There will be people who will complain about K-On sameface when Bakuon airs if it is done by KyoAni. </br>  Lewdest show since Amagi tbh  <br><br>Jesus Christ, look at that Faggot.</br></br>    <br>Blame kyoani for using key looking faces since then.</br>    <br>What the fuck disgusting.</br>  <br>They really don't use Key eyes and faces though. The face started with K-On and spread to Haruhi and then the rest of their shows until Hyouka/Hibike.</br>  <br> moeshit <br/></br>  <br>sex hair thinks its her own drool, suzuki's fanboyism infects her, hence </br>  Favorite girl?  <br> The face started with K-On and spread to Haruhi and then the rest of their shows until Hyouka/Hibike. <br>This just shows how much of a newfag you are.<br>K-On aired years after Haruhi.<br>I'm a kyoani fag myself, so I'm not trying to shit on them, but they did start with "moe" faces with Key adaptations. They have been making them less retarded as the years go by though, and thankfully, since the old style didn't age well in my opinion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it started with Kannagi.</br>  <br>cager detected</br>  <br>The slutty one.</br>  <br>Jeremy Clarkson</br>  <br>The fucking K-On face started with K-On. Their Key adaptations were a 1:1 clones of the VNs. And I'm talking about the late Haruhi not the 06 Haruhi.</br>  <br> Azusa 2.0 <br>Holy shit.</br></br>  <br> Azusa returns <br><br>Thank you Based KyoAni</br></br></br>  Oh fuck, my  wife  is a suzuki fangirl. Pretty much grins like a fucking loon every time she sees a Jimny.<br><br>She's going to go fucking mental for this series, isn't she?</br></br>  <br>Number of people who care about it:</br>  So this is just a K-On parody about motorcycles right?  <br>I want to buy a Suzuki just for Rin!</br>  <br><br>She's pretty much Azusa except she's not very skilled with driving and is afraid of motorcycles but she wants to get better. She's also a bit more awkward.</br></br>  <br>It's like a mixture of K-on and Top Gear with bikes.</br>  DAMN  Does anyone know if it will have my bikefu, the Kawasaki EX250?  <br>So she's not Azusa?</br>  <br>She's still Azusa in the sense that she's an annoying little tryhard.</br>  <br>Female Stig rides a Kawasaki.</br>  <br> except she's not very skilled <br><br>Faker.</br></br></br>    Is Azusa 2.0 bicurious?   Motocycle fun for Fall <br> Hibike S2 for Spring 2016? <br>One can only hope<br><br>Still, lewd motorcycles by Koyani is going to be fun</br></br></br></br>  <br>And the fact that there is yuri baiting between her and Yui2.0</br>  I hope they hire someone to work on animating Ritsu 2.0's sex hair specifically, like they did with Free's water.  <br> Hibike S2 <br>HAHAHAHA no</br></br>    <br>Isn't this series too lewd for Kyoani?</br>  <br>KyoAni wants to. Lantis want to it too. They only need Yamaha to give them the confirmation and the project is a go.</br>  <br> a show that's not out yet is overpraised garbage <br>Nice time travel.</br></br>  <br> &gt;cg bikes <br>Just like they used cg instruments for Hibike, right?</br></br>    are they really confirmed? if so fuck everything no more good threads (ever since the rumor threads have been shit anyway and will get even worse with more kyoanifags and animeonlyfags)  this will probably be the last episode of the first season  <br>But there are no Bakuon threads since Christmas. And the scalnation staled since that time. So yeah shit threads are better than no threads and no scalnation at all.</br>    <br>look at this thread, is already a kyoani thread</br>   there are really people in this thread comparing k-on to bakuon  <br>jesus fucking christ why cant we ever have nice things</br>  <br> there are really people in this thread comparing k-on to bakuon <br>There's a reason for that you retard.</br></br>  <br> People comparing a manga to its parody <br>How dare they. Fucking cunts the bunch of em.</br></br>  There is no mention of KyoAni. I don't see why they would be jumping on this either. They're clearly trying to work with their model. <br><br>KyoAni isn't desperate for money either. The only reason why people are linking them with this is because Bakuon is apparently similar to K-On. That has nothing to do with KyoAni and I don't think they're interested.</br></br>  <br> But there are no Bakuon threads since Christmas. And the scalnation staled since that time. <br><br>not sure if serious</br></br></br>  <br> The only reason why people are linking them with this is because Bakuon is apparently similar to K-On.  <br><br>Its the same stupidity that makes anons say Soranowoto was similar to K-On.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm really serious. I didn't see any Bakuon thread since the Christmas gift that anons gave us. And the scalnations are stalled for a while now on Vol 2 and isn't even localized in France. So yeah any anime traction this gets is a chance for the scalnations to move forward.</br>  <br>I want to believe.<br><br> Reunite the roller girls </br></br></br>  Please no. KyoAni don't animate this shit.  <br> KyoAni <br> loli anime <br>Confirmed for never already.</br></br></br>  <br> KyoAni wants to <br>Bullshit. They want to do something with male staff already, and that's why they're saving their marketing and enthusiasm with these low profile projects.<br>Brace yourself for Free's shota prequel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why haven't we gotten a girls' rhythmic gymnastic TV series recently?<br><br>It's like easy fanservice just like Free!</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, this is a stupid series about a horrible topic, with generic shit girls.<br>I hope they won't get better than DEEN or A-1 for it.</br></br>  <br>Their AniDo project is nearly done though. And no it's not the Free movie either because that one is alredy over. So yeah the main company is doing nothing until next year.</br>  <br>There is L I T E R A L L Y N O T H I N G in this article that confirms it being made by KyoAni. Fuck off.</br>  <br>you too</br>  <br> Not wanting to watch glorious Yamahas and Suzukis in anime <br>Confirmed for a faggot.</br></br>  <br>The stig.</br>  <br>Have fun polluting earth needlessly and causing many accidents, retard.</br>  <br>You wot.<br>Yeah we've been slow recently due to reasons, but we released the rest of volume 2 after the hitches in January and February.<br>We're gonna get 2 chapters out soon-ish, before the third week of August for sure since the TS is moving, after that I don't know. To be frank, I don't have all that much interest or motivation left for this shit, I haven't translated anything related to it since the first few months of 2015 and all I've been doing is cleaning/redrawing/typesetting which are things I 100% do not enjoy. I'll keep going, sure, but I'm still hoping for it to get an official translation so I can move on to other things. Or if someone else wants to pick it up I will gladly throw staff and scans at you, hell maybe some hosting too while we're at it.</br></br></br>  I'm still excited for it, regardless of who's making it. However I'll feel like a traitor unless I at least pretend Honda-chan is best girl.  <br>I love the magical girl genre and I don't think HnP is that good.</br>  <br><br>HnP turned to shit because the shota fetishization crap episode.</br></br>  <br><br>At a glance I thought this was Futachuat first.</br></br>  <br>LEWD</br>  OP YOU LYING FUCK  <br>You mean this http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/374<wbr>23 and this http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/857<wbr>285 ?<br>Latter is better</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>a post this shit actually got over 10 replies</br>  <br>this girl is quite clearly the best</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I might actually have to pick up a kyoani show for once.</br>  NO FUCK YOU KYOANI FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT ITS BEEN 5 YEARS AND THE FUCKING SPIN OFF BY SATELIGHT WAS MORE BORING THAN HYOUKA YOU FUCKING FUCK UPS GOONS  <br>Don't they have a short girl or something?</br>  <br>What does Satelight's latest series have to do with KyoAni at all?<br>KyoAni never made a call.</br></br>  <br> SATELIGHT WAS MORE BORING THAN HYOUKA <br><br>How is this relevant?</br></br></br>  <br>Please, leave Pleiades out of your shitposting.</br>  <br> VEG anime <br>I wish</br></br>  <br>too bad she's horrible at riding a motorcycle</br>  <br>but that's every one of them</br>  <br>Hopefully this will be better and more memorable than The Rolling Girls.</br>  <br> KyoAni <br><br>I died with Amagi and now this?<br>R.I.P</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shouldn't be hard</br>  <br>She's probably staring at the suzuki logo on her ass</br>  <br> The next stop on our road trip is the historic city of Tokyo <br> But isn't that the place we just left? <br> No, that Tokyo had a bunch of ghouls in it. This is a different Tokyo. <br> Well what's so different about this place? <br> I'm not sure, but apparently there are a number of Extra Special Power users there. <br> ... <br> Skip? <br> Skip. <br> Maybe we can get the producers to include a Tokyo with Ravens sometime. <br> Ravens and miniskirts <br><br> But I liked Tokyo ESP... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nothing points to KyoAni <br> not even mentioned <br> just a rumor based on the fact that it's similar to K-On <br> can't even read the thread <br><br>KyoAni isn't dead you stupid faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   you never get a K-ON on motorcycles where they fight villains with their instruments <br><br>KyoAni, if you're out there listening, please make this happen.</br></br>  <br>Died because the anime was great.<br><br>Back to you, retard.</br></br></br>  <br>What are you even saying?

Why didn't they just call this Circle Jerk - The Anime?<br><br>I'm getting tired of all the dick sucking in this show.</br></br>  <br>Rather have a pumpkin all to myself than a velvet cushion and be forced to share.</br>  <br>Blame the translators for that one, prose is the first thing that dies in translation, I'm still having fun though. Compared to most other TLs I've seen the translation of Overlord is a masterpiece.</br>  <br>I'd agree but only on Climb's part. Everybody else were relatively interesting and sort of likable but holy shit is Climb one of the most grating characters I've had the displeasure of mildly giving a fuck about. At least show more of the dysfunctional princess instead of that poor little fucker.</br>  Is this the first time they talk about Saoru's work/life before becoming Ainz?<br>If it is, the way this is introduced felt kind of sudden. Were there other mentions of the previous life I've missed?</br>  <br><br>But that's the thing tho, I don't and never did. The books are clearly centered around Papa Bones and his staff. So when a lot of time is spent on characters that aren't them, I stop caring. Some characters, extend the story or world, but others lead no where. They are a narrative dead end. It feels like time spent was wasted, when they die or fuck off never to be seen again.<br><br>It's too repetitive, too often. As a reader, we don't need to be on the backs of these side characters to understand them or feel for them. Why not have spies follow them, or why not have Momon act as a vehicle for these side characters. In a story, there are many ways to introduce side characters. It's just so fucking monotonous to be forced on these characters, that aren't part of the main crew. Just by that fact alone, "that they aren't the main crew", gives me cognitive dissonance. I know not to trust these fucks or put my heart into them. There is only ever 2 out comes for these characters too. They die or fuck off to be a reference.</br></br></br></br>  Let's have it /a/, it's been 3 episodes now:<br><br>-What are you watching?<br>-What is your favorite show so far?<br>-What's your' least favorite show so far?<br>-What have you already dropped?<br>-Did you pick up anything due to a thread on /a/?

I think Fate is overall bad and the anime did a good job making the series interesting to watch, better than the VNs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ok I will correct myself.<br><br>They actually made a shitty Porn VN into an Ok Anime. And no I'm no secondary I actually made the mistake to listen to /a/ once again and sat through this shit.</br></br></br></br>  Unrelated but this thread seems TM enough to ask. Am I better off reading KnK then watching it or just watching it? The movies change up some parts of it don't they? Are there just parts that are explicitly changed that I could just go and read to see the differences?  <br> Am I better off reading KnK then watching it or just watching it? <br>Read it then if you like it enough then watch it.</br></br>  <br> Porn VN </br>  <br>UBW was terrible, or at least the second season certainly was.</br>    Silly anon, they are waiting for the remake to come out, obviously.  <br>  shitty <br> Porn VN <br> Ok Anime <br>They made an awful adaptation of a great story focused VN.</br></br></br></br>  <br> UBW <br> amazing <br>haha no</br></br></br>  <br><br>I actually enjoyed it.</br></br>  <br> a great story focused VN. </br>  <br> there are actually people in the world right now who believe that any VN can have any literary credit, and that VNs can be compared on that basis </br>  <br> implying altrough is a loli </br>  <br>There isn't a single western fantasy novel that can even compare to Fate so yes, it's pretty damn great.</br>  <br>Fuck off /lit/, VNs are the pinnacle of literature and everything else is worthless trash.</br>  Because ufotable still has a lot of things to animate and TM probably doesn't want to be their own concurrent considering the remake should come out soon(tm).  <br>THE LOLIS</br>  <br><br>This. They want people who never played the original to buy the remake, not for people to just watch an anime. Anime will probably come a few years after the remake comes out.</br></br>  <br>Even the Game of Thrones novels are better. I've read tons of fantasy books and most of them were better.</br>  Sure is /lit/ in here.  Prisma is good for selling merch and driving manga sales.  <br> There isn't a single western fantasy novel that can even compare to Fate </br>  Prisma Illya currently has manga, and anime is advertising it.<br>Tsukihime has not gotten new material in ages. It will get an anime when the game comes out.</br>  <br>JESUS FUCKING CHRIST</br>  there absolutely will be one once the remake comes out. Whenever that is.    Convince me to read Tsukihime.  Tsukihime's anime exists, it's good no matter what you say or think.<br>You're just the 1000th faggot who repeats the most retarded meme you probably know nothing about or why people didn't like the anime back then.<br>Now fuck off</br></br>  <br><br>Maids get raped.</br></br>  <br>It has the best TM waifus.</br>  <br>its a bad adaption and the art direction is terrible. its okay on its own but its aged terribly.</br>  <br>THIS CHAIR</br>  Reason Tsukihime is actually a good anime<br><br>-Non of the moe garbage you get in CP<br>-Doesn't pander to illya fags who made of Type-moon novels a pedo fest<br>-Absolutely god tier soundtrack<br>-Better written than the VN itself<br>-Best depiction of Arcueid so far<br><br>The only downside is the lazy art and animation and the fact they had to shorten most of the main arc leaving some gaps and unclear stuff.<br><br><br>How exactly did it age terribly?<br>If you like moe, then you have CP now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just want Melty Blood to hit stateside as digital downloads so I can play it more than just the handful of times I have at random anime cons.   https://archive.moe/a/thread/11292<wbr>5027</wbr> <br> https://archive.moe/a/thread/12818<wbr>7237</wbr> <br><br>Reminder that the ANN staff is constantly shitting up Fate threads.</br></br></br>  <br>picked up</br>  <br> the only downside in my animated story is that the animation sucks and the story has tons of plotholes and is really confusing </br>  <br> illya fags who made of Type-moon novels a pedo fest <br>You might want to go back 2 years before F/SN.</br></br>  <br> moe garbage <br>Jesus do you even know what moe means.

You should also check out the fan disc and Kagetsu Tohya afterwards.<br><br> Also, after having just finished those myself, should I read the Melty Blood manga or just track down each version of the game and play them?</br></br></br>  <br>Play the games then read the manga.</br>  <br>Don't. It's a shitty amateur doujin-tier work with poor art and no voice acting, and it runs on an outdated engine.

I read the original years ago, and it was good, but I want the remake already.<br><br>I also never touched the sequel with the Groundhog Day Loop scenario, mainly because I hate clicking every time a line of text appears and I heard that the sequel didn't add that like Fate and it's sequel did. I enjoyed Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, is Tsukihime's sequel something I'd like?</br></br>  <br>They weren't in the original, why would they be in an adaptation?<br><br>We won't even get calico Ren, don't get your hopes up.</br></br></br>  <br>I suck at fighting games and don't enjoy them enough to get good, is there someone on jewtube that did a playthrough of MB for people who just want the story?</br>  <br>Can you sourcefags leave this board please? It's obvious you guys don't even like anime.</br>  <br>We don't need another Endless Eight.</br>  <br>Because Tsukihime honestly sucks shit and is only popular because nostalgiafags can't let go of the first VN they ever played</br>  <br><br>to be announced at heaven's feel premiere  with god eater animation </br></br>  <br>From my understanding, there's a manga adaptation. I was considering reading that but decided to read F/HA instead for now since I blitzed through half of Tsukihime, the fan disc, and KT over the past week. Gotta take a break and read some Fate stuff.<br><br><br>Ren was in the first VN. I don't think she was ever in her humanoid form, but she was definitely involved in the Arc and Ciel routes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes we're getting a remake, all the other projects that were distracting Nasu are winding down so we finally got a progress report in the latest Type-Moon Ace. It'll still be another year minimum before it's released, and another 3-5 before it gets translated.<br><br>KT's a cool read, but if you're an idiot you'll just get stuck and hate it. And you're probably an idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>Good choice with F/HA, I loved it. The only problem I had with it is that Caren is in it, but I felt like she never really did much until the very end, and even then I felt like they didn't need her.<br><br>You can count non-human Ren if you want, but I don't see the point in that.</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of F/HA, I just started and got to the scene change right after the beginning one at the temple. Is this some really heavy foreshadowing I'm feeling with it being said outright that  dead people can't revive the dead / make wishes? <br><br><br>There's a handy flowchart posted earlier in the thread that helps with finding out how to trigger events and progress in the story, plus the place I got it from included it in the files.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, ufotable will get to it once they exhaust the "serious" fate material.</br>  <br>3-5, really? I understood the long wait for Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, but shouldn't a Tsukihime remake be quicker to translate? From what I know we're getting best girl's route added, but besides that we have decent translations for a lot of it already, so the translators don't have to do everything from scratch. The harder decisions like calling all-caps-kun SHIKI and deciding how to handle names are already done.</br>  <br>Nasu's rewriting it and changing much more than just adding a new route. Hopefully he doesn't take out all of the rape. Tsukihime would not be the same without the rape.</br>  <br>That's foreshadowing, but you've already seen much bigger foreshadowing, even if you're only a few scenes in. Do you already know about the characters that appear in F/HA but not F/SN? <br><br>I'd stay out of these threads for now either way, there is one particular spoiler that changes every scene from the temple scene up until you almost reach the ending.</br></br></br>  <br>I still laugh whenever I think about the scene where Shiki is talking to Ciel and basically says "Bring me to her or I'll rape you right here" and Ciel's like "No thanks".<br><br>I never liked Shirou, but Shiki is a cool guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I accidentally learned the identities of who's appearing in this scene from browsing the wiki looking at other characters. Plus the advertisements for the rerelease pretty much told me who this shadowy guy is.</br>  <br>Yeah, you've had enough spoilers to lose most of the good foreshadowing then, but it's still worth reading for sure. I like the silly extra scenes a lot too, people seem to love Carnival Phantasm but I felt like F/HA handled the concept of silly joke skits better. CP turned everyone into cardboard cutouts (not that that is too terrible for the Fate cast) while F/HA is generally OK at leaving enough of the original character intact.</br>  <br> Explain to me why Prisma Illya is in it's 3rd season <br><br>Is a miracle.</br></br></br>  <br>I love CP mainly for the Tsukihime parts. It's the closest thing we have to a good Tsukihime anime, plus that Arc is too cute.</br>  <br>I genuinely enjoyed it. Though I do think that a remake needs to be made thats legit loyal to the  _good_  ending.<br><br>  Fucking true doesn't make sense when good does "oh hey, I can just wait it out until I get enough power back to control myself, then spend the rest of my days with my husbando" vs "aw shit, nope, imma eat you, I can't do this, I can't sit and wait for the willpower to do this, im out nigga." </br></br></br>  <br>That image misses Rin.<br>She easily gives the most info-dumps in F/SN</br></br>  <br>The "translation" is cokesato's fanfiction</br>  <br> I wish Satsuki Yumizuka had a bit more. A lot of the joke skits turned out well and really deserved to be made, like the one where Nero (!?) says and spells his name out, something I wondered about since the first time I read Tsukihime. <br><br>Some of the gags just seemed like they lasted too long or had too many repeats, I never liked the magical girl Arc segments that seemed to be copy pasted over and over. I usually liked the repeating gags once, and never again. I loved the Calico Ren x5 joke, but not the other variations, for example. <br><br>I never understood the girl that kept saying "This is within my calculations", I wanted them to do ANYTHING different with her, but it was the same joke every single time. The whole "Flanderize everyone" thing worked well for some characters, but poor Hisui is the quiet type so they gave her that weird hypnosis thing and nothing else. Wasn't that gag started from a typo or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Arc is first and best. Good ending the only ending. Shiki takes hits like avalon shirou. Is basically a prerequisite to watching Carnival Phantasm if you ain't a fag. Go man. Only bitches complain about it's age.</br>  <br>Was it a typo? I remember Hisui using that weird attack in Imogirisou(?) in KT, and she also had that as a move in Melty Blood. The "This is within my calculations" girl is Sion, also from Melty Blood. Not really sure about the story in that yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if she just says that a lot or something. Also, about Satsuki not being in many skits, it's because she isn't a main heroine  yet. </br>  <br>Please don't. I don't want them to ruin Tsukihime's character designs too.</br>  <br>UBW was not good</br>  <br>It's the good end that doesn't make sense, not the True End</br>  <br>If I remember correctly Hisui accused someone of being a murderer, but a typo made her say "You, Become the murderer" or something.<br><br>I have no clue, and don't know the source material of anything past Tsukihime and KT. Is there a recording of someone playing Melty Blood so people who don't know shit about fighting games can learn the story?</br></br></br>  <br>Harry Potter?<br>LOTR?<br>And those are just popular ones</br></br></br>  <br>We DEFINITELY do. Shit was hype as fuck</br>  <br>I love Endless Eight as a concept, but actually watching it is a different thing. I've always loved Groundhog Day stories but E8 took it a bit too far.</br>  <br>What? How? The only difference between the two is that after killing Roa, in the good end she just waited it out after getting her other piece of power back from him, recuperated, and then met up with Shiki again. <br><br>In true, she got it back, but was unable to suppress her urged so decided to distance herself from him. Why not wait longer and get the power to control yourself, then go back to the man you love?<br><br>I just don't see it anon. You gotta enlighten me here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> other ultra-long VNs are having their translations released the same year as they were initially released in Japan, nowadays <br> Mirror Moon still takes over 3 years to release theirs </br></br>  <br>*urges fucking christ</br>  <br>Please don't show your age when you post, it makes everyone feel uncomfortable.<br><br><br>To be honest, the remake has a lot of ground to till if they want to make Tsukihime good. After coming off a second read, you see a LOT of problems, such as repetition, poor style, and poor theming interlaced with the VN. I really hope Nasu does a shit ton of rewrites along with just redraws and voice acting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The best version of Arc is in the manga.</br>  <br>Why can't Nanaya be able to hanlde seeing death if their family are Supernatural Assassins?</br>  <br> such as repetition, poor style <br>I wonder how much of it can be blamed on the translation and editing. If it was "that" bad it wouldn't have been a success in Japan, right?</br></br>  <br>Because Shiki failed to SAVE EVERYONE.</br>  <br>Because he wasn't born with the MEoDP. Of course his Nanaya blood let him have the potential, but that doesn't mean he was perfectly suited for them.</br>  <br>The repetition was pretty bad in some parts, especially Ciel's route. It only got interesting after the false end.</br>  <br> Game of Thrones novels are better <br><br> I've read tons of fantasy books <br><br>gtfo underage fag</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They've been working on this remake since at least 2008, so I'd hope they do some work with it.<br><br>Anyway, The Type Moon Collection Nendo Petit figures has a Arc that comes with a bunch of snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about the other projects, but the guy who did F/SN is fucking garbage. Spends entire years putting out awkward translations. They better get a better translator than him.</br>  <br>We posting screenshots now? Also, is there a voice patch for HA or is that still a thing being worked on? I'm fine without, but it was nice hearing them in F/SN.</br>  Which one did you guys choose?  <br>Newfag here, have just downloaded by haven't started tsukihime. What are the two big lines before and in the middle of speech for? Are they a translation thing?</br>  <br> anything but glasses </br>  <br>I'm not really sure myself since I don't recall them in other Type Moon VNs, but I imagine they're like pauses or line breaks.</br>  <br>That's where spaces are supposed to be.<br>Some versions of the VN are fucked up and have || instead</br></br>  <br>I think she looks much better without the glasses because with glasses, she reminds me too much of Anthy from Utena.</br>  <br><br>Who?</br></br>  <br><br>Ah, thanks.</br></br>  <br>I'm realy not sure about the remake design</br>  <br>Ilyia is more fun</br>    <br>To be fair, he looked weird in the original, but his design grew on me. They're going a little too hard with the "bad boy" stereotype here, but it might look better without the chain.</br>  <br>The problems I had with it were mostly technical.<br><br>There's no real way to get around the fact you have to click to move the text along, right? I tried an auto-clicker but it doesn't like scenes with things like THIS CHAIR.</br></br></br>  <br>Christ, not even /r9k/ is capable of this.</br>  <br>I just recline in my chair pressing one of the enter buttons or space bar, but it would have been nice to be able to watch in my bed instead. That's another feature I'll be looking forward to when the remake comes out.</br>  <br>Zero was ok, but tried too hard to be some sort of philosophical masterpiece. UBW was disappointing 1st season, and went to complete shit in the second with the only redeeming thing being the epilogue.</br>  <br><br> tfw read it on my tablet <br><br>It was really easy to skim through with each finger tap counting as a click.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no earings <br><br>Why didn't they just do the kind thing and put him out of his misery?</br></br></br>  <br>Wait the fucking minute sec, that's the art of anneherbe guy. Why is the plot going on that page became serious? What's the sauce?</br>  <br>Ryougi was not born with the MEoDP either.<br><br>The reason Ryougi mastered MEoDP faster is that she had no choice but to have the eyes active since her accident due to the coma.<br><br>Tohno could not master his eyes the way Ryougi could because he kept blunting its natural growth and he keeps using it to learn death at a far harsher curve than Ryougi did.<br><br>That's why Ryougi told Tohno he needs three more years before his eyes reach her eye's level.<br><br>The MEoDP only fucks Tohno up because when he uses it in Tsukihime, he starts using it at prolonged periods and against really high-tier targets (Ryougi just had to deal with natural things during coma), while his body is ragged from lifeforce draining.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I use a gamepad for VNs. Map that shit out in AHK and live the dream. The buttons are made for clicking! And I don't feel like I'm wearing out my touchpad/keyboard.</br>  <br>That makes sense. I haven't read or watched the KnK stuff yet, but I remember hearing that her eyes are different because her power comes from the source itself or something, or that she is basically their power's origin's avatar moreso than Shiki, and that's why I thought she was able to master her eyes better than Shiki, or be more powerful.</br>  <br>Yeah, KnK Shiki is weird because she's kind of connected to the world, but Tsukihime Shiki just seems to have special eyes. <br><br>I might remember it wrong because it's been a while, but KnK Shiki cut a bomb's connection to the detonator or something, right? Tohno never tried anything like that, outside of people he broke locks and the floor a few times, and not too much else.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say the most impressive thing he did with his power was killing poisons in the bloodstream during the Far Side routes.</br>  <br>I wouldn't really call that a big success. Didn't he completely destroy Kohaku's ability to remember things on accident when he did that? He might be able to do it, but not well.<br><br>But yeah, he did cut the red hairs from Akiha too I guess, that's pretty neat.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still not sure if her losing her memory was because of the poison or him.</br>    <br>Yeah, why did that Arcueid come with snakes? Does she summon them in Melty Blood or something? I played all of Tsukihime waiting for snakes to appear.</br>  <br>Most of Nasu's success in my opinion stems from an interesting setting and good (endearing) characters. That can get you pretty far even if the work isn't that good (K ON anyone?) <br><br>I'm sure a lot can be blamed on the translation, but from quite a lot of sources i've seen (on this site and other places) people say the style in the VN isn't good either.<br><br>Personally, what I would really love to see is a change in plot in a few arcs. About 3/5 of the routes' main focus is "Shiki going insane". It would be cool to see something more than that in the remake, although I doubt that will happen. <br><br>My ideal changes:<br> 1) A Ciel route that is more independent of Arc's route<br>2) A divergence of the routes 1/5 of the way through the story for all routes (currently, both Kohaku's and Hisui's route requires half the story (in days) to be skipped for each)<br>3)A Sacchin route where Shiki protects her from Arc and Ciel<br>4) the Far Side routes having more depth to them, rather than just filling in information about the Tohno family<br>5) Better writing</br></br></br></br> <br><br>If all of these happen, the remake will be amazing, though I doubt most off it will happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> apprehend <br>Internet lesson of the day, folks; Don't use words when you don't know what they mean. This is especially important when calling other people stupid.</br></br>  <br>To be fair "X goes crazy" was about as good as you could expect in Visual Novel format back then, I mean fight scenes all used the same exact "slash" and "blood splatter" screen every time. Making an interesting story focusing on the characters and taking full advantage of a 1st person perspective are important. <br><br>My favorite route was Hisui, just because the "X goes crazy" plot was well done, and that route had the biggest and most powerful ending to me, without needing to end it with just a big fight.<br><br>Maybe the remake will do those things, it would be interesting to see what they'll do with the budget. The art we've seen so far shows they have some time and money put into it, they even gave us a great shot of the mansion .</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this series had more mc x heroine sex than fate adaptations though</br>  <br>Personally, I really liked Shiki going crazy: it's what made Tsukihime fun to read. Also, regarding style, I think a fan translation might not be a good basis for criticizing a writer's work. For those that can read the original, then have it. I'm definitely behind having more variety in routes, though, since Ciel's route didn't really seem to start after the false ending. Maybe Nasu will try to redo the whole thing as he originally intended with 120 hours of content spanning I think it was a month?</br>  <br>Although I originally liked Kohaku's the most, on the second run Hisui's route really shined. I just wish it were a bit longer. For one thing, Kohaku  did not have much foreshadowing in the earlier routes. I understand that the Far Side routes are supposed to be isolated from the Near Side, but the way it is now, by the end the Near Side routes feel 'tacked on' in terms of plot development when they take the bulk of the time! <br><br>I'm really looking forward to it as well. I just want more than a new coat of paint.</br></br></br>  <br>Ciel's route didn't really seem to start until after the false ending*</br>  <br>Why are people on /a/ spouting Beast lair meme ?<br><br>We /reddit/ now?<br><br>Fuck off, Tsukihime anime was loved on /b/ and was what made lots and lots of anons interested enough to try the VN and other TM franchises.<br>Then BL started spouting memes about it and normalfaggots along with newfags started parroting</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I didn''t have a problem with Shiki going crazy, I just wish it didn't take up so much space in the story. <br>A month's length would probably be ideal. I'd love to see the story possibly extended so that the Near Side characters have to deal with Kohaku/Akiha having to deal with Arc.</br></br></br>  <br>MirrorMoon will go faster now, maybe.<br><br>We're not in early 2000 anymore</br></br></br>   four days until prisma   <br>Glasses. The dream scene already had her without glasses</br>  <br>I completely agree with you, the reasoning here. I think the reason Hisui's route felt shorter for me is that there was that long stretch of time without any choices, which means no alternate scenes or dead ends for a while. Since the way I read the VN (the preferred way) had Hisui 4th and Kohaku 5th, Hisui's route got me REALLY hyped to instantly start the next route, even though I was losing steam before that. <br><br>The ending of Hisui's route was great, I liked how on a second read there are things that pop up as foreshadowing. <br><br>The names on the wall were huge foreshadowing, but the instant they revealed that twist I was like "oh, the names on the wall thing!", and it was cool that the Hisui ending had much more subtle foreshadowing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How often did Hisui and Kohaku switch places? I only know about the time when Shiki let her suck him off. </br>  <br> Each time Hisui gives 'medicine' to Shiki, it is Kohaku. I believe the best way to tell is the Hisui sprite with no pupils. I sort of hope they make it clearer in the remake, making it so that the fake Hisui always only has one ring in her eye instead of two. <br><br><br>I felt the same way going into Kohaku's route My favorite part of Kohaku's route is when you finally see a new sprite  during the after party scene, where he brings up the ribbon to her  after 4 routes of the same 5.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Tsukihime anime had the exact same problem the DEEN FSN anime had, only worse. It was pretty decent on its own, but it failed to stand up to even the weakest route of the VN. Not to mention how it completely butchers the characters' personality and characterization.</br>  <br>They're not; they're an incompatibility thing created by if you downloaded fuwanovel. If you actually install Tsuki, they lines will disappear.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, if I remember correctly all the routes have at least one "switch", the 2nd post is right about when it happens. The other way to tell is in how they talk, but it might differ in translations. In my copy (I think most are the same) the characters refer to others in specific ways, for example Akiha almost never really calls Shiki by his name, only Niisan. Akiha says SHIKI's name sometimes, and almost never calls him "niisan". With the twins, one way to tell is that they use different terms, it's been a long time but I think Hisui only calls Kohaku Neesan, and not by her name. If Hisui doesn't call her sister Neesan, something is probably different.<br><br>Seeing new sprites later on is a great thing, I can't wait until we get (hopefully) dozens for everyone in the remake. I LOVED how they used Sepia Tone for the flashbacks, to hide that other spoiler detail. They didn't have much art to work with, but they did a lot with what they had.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Fsz <br>What is that even referring to? You ran two titles together</br></br>  <br>wait, theres a 3rd season going on right now?</br>  http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_3#Part_7</wbr></wbr>  NICE TRY FAGG-<br> It's real <br>BASED LOLI06</br></br>  Is it happening again?  NYANG-NYANG A SLUT  <br>This guy's art is great.</br>  <br>It's sad that there's not much of his shit scanlated.</br>  Akikawa Mie is my new favorite girl.  Are Mikotofags BTFO yet?  <br>Fuck off Mugino</br>  <br> implying that's not Misaki </br>   Misaka can hack fucking computers with electricity <br> Can't confidently charge a damn battery </br>  <br>Hitomaru<br>Mochi<br>Wazakita<br><br>What are some other artists who draw great monster girl porn?</br></br></br></br></br>  I love Misaka, I really really do.<br>But I need to admit that it's pretty stupid that an esper like her, with the control she has over her power, CAN'T CHARGE A FUCKING BATTERY.<br>I MEAN, SERIOUSLY?<br><br>YOU CAN CONTROL ELECTRICITY SO DAMN WELL YOU CAN FORM WINGS OUT OF HYDROGEN AND HACK INTO ANY KIND OF ELECTRONICS.<br><br>AND YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT ENOUGH TO CHARGE A BATTERY?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Misaki doesn't browse /a/, she plays vidya.</br>  <br>Oh right, there's also AHOBAKA and Erdelied/Nenemaru.</br>  <br><br>That was more like Kamachi fucking up.</br></br>  <br><br>S-She's afraid of melting it!</br></br>   “Misaaaka, can you try putting this plug in your mouth?” <br> in your mouth?” <br> mouth <br>So how about those electric blowjobs?</br></br></br>  <br>You try charging a battery with your mouth while riding an acrobike and fleeing from a rampaging Buddhist mummy.</br>   the nerf spell alreadt destroyed their power and they can't get it back <br>So basically it is the same thing as the fairy spell but somehow less effective despite all the effort.</br>  I want a bonus chapter where Accelerator gets jobbed by Uiharu, or that criminal that gave slow moving marbles infinite inertia.   “Ah ha ha! Sorry, sorry. You sure were traumatized by that business with Othinus, Kamijou-chan!!”  <br>That's evil.</br>   “Ah ha ha! Sorry, sorry. You sure were traumatized by that business with Othinus, Kamijou-chan!!” <br>Also the symbolism with the "put this in your mouth misaka!"<br>Goddamn this novel is great.</br></br>  <br>They should break him even more, I want to see the result.</br>  <br>He's already become massively inventive about ways to kill someone, you want him to start applying that to normal people now?</br>  <br>Yes so there's an excuse to kill him</br>  <br>  symbolism <br>I don't think that was the intent given Misaka's rejection regarded her ability to safely charge the battery in that manner.</br></br>  <br>Mikotofags no but Misaka did get BTFO hard</br>  <br>Yeah I was just joking. Looks like Mikoto got herself 2 more rivals though.<br> But only if we receive that prayer from our cute little Kamijou-chan. </br></br>  <br>  2 <br> Not for long </br></br>  <br>Does she physically hurt at all? <br><br>That's what's so bullshit and infuriating about her.</br></br></br>  How long before Nephshippers show up  <br> Implying she's not going to plop back into this world, nude, with her crotch straight onto touma's face. </br>  <br>of course not, but she gets her feelings hurt. nyang attack her but the spears or whatever had a delayed and unknown effect that touma stopped before it started.</br>  <br>Fairy spell lets them continue doing all their bullshit at full power with the 100% failure trick and only becomes a problem when its on the verge of killing them. Nerf spell actually weakens them.</br>  <br> implying she would even care about Touma after she pretty much orgasmed as Kamisato fingered her. </br>  <br>Yeah, so we can see him reflect his own actions and whispers "what have I done?".</br>  <br>I mean the original intent of the fairy spell. Olly didn't think that shit would kill othinus, he thought it would weaken her to the point of being harmless. That is sorta what this spell does but they are far from harmless. However like the actual result of the fairy spell the gods like othinus can't regain their lost power even with ib.</br>   “Her… That girl with the short brown hair and the headband… Come to think of it, who is she!? I feel like she’s been nonchalantly showing up everywhere I go!!”  <br><br>Kamachi is having too much fun with this.</br></br>  Can't wait for Mikoto's tears.  <br>I really want this to get animated just to see her retroactively added to various scenes, even if it's just for index-tan.</br>   “Misaaaka, can you try putting this plug in your mouth?”  <br><br>I'm getting turned on.</br></br>  <br> That is sorta what this spell does but they are far from harmless. <br>They're harmless to Aleister and Noukan, aside from some relatively minor property damage.</br></br>   “Ksssshhhhh!! …The signal in your area is too crowded, so the number you have called cannot be-…” <br><br> “What the hell? There’s an interfering signal? Wait, don’t tell me… Misakaaaaaa!!” <br>I'm enjoying this shit too much.</br></br></br>  <br>What a sad life you must have</br>  Ooh, so Touma's taking advantage of "that".<br><br>Even if Magic Gods are omnipotent, they're not omniscient. Even if he could destroy the entire universe on a whim, even he would have a hard time finding a single 0.05m bit of gold in in a beach.</br></br>  <br>What a frustrated life you must have. Can't wait to lick your tears too.</br>  <br>My tears? You're assuming I'll cry if Mikoto cries? You've got that wrong. I'd love to see her move away from Touma and do something actually meaningful</br>  <br>I think they can know if they have their power and are looking. The gods kept track of all the shit on earth despite being in another dimension with no sense of time or distance. Othinus knew what happened during the fight with touma and ollerus despite not being their and not having her full power.</br>  <br> touma and ollerus <br>I mean touma and fiamma</br></br>  <br>Think again.<br><br>If she charges it Touma might make a call to a girl!!!</br></br></br>  I feel so bad for Misaka that I don't even feel like shitposting or complaining about her anymore this volume. Being Misaka is pure suffering. To think it only gets worse from here on out.  <br>Still much less suffering than Misaki.</br>  <br>I really wonder what would happen if Misaki tried to read Touma's memories and caught a glimpse of the infinite hells.</br>  <br> Mikoto  <br> doing something meaningful <br>How many more volumes are you willing to wait for it?</br></br></br>  Anyone who thinks Mikoto will shake this off and get stronger is delusional. She'll either do her own thing and accept its over with Touma or just be irrelevant and stop appearing, with the first option being the most likely  <br>No, Misaka has it worse this time and its through her whole volume. Misaki just had one bad scene at the end and thats it.</br>  <br>She might end jumping on him to give him a lot of feel hugs.</br>  <br>It can happen once the shitty crush is over which is this volume</br>  <br>Mentally stronger. Somewhat likely.<br>Power wise. Never.</br></br>  <br>Only because the narrative didn't show it, but not being acknowledged by Touma in any way is infinitely worse suffering than whatever Mikoto goes through in this volume.</br>  <br>Speaking of delusions.</br>   “The stars can be plucked from the sky so easily, but you humans feel such passion for such unimportant things.” <br><br>Nuit ? Nuit.</br></br>  <br>What delusions</br>  <br> implying Dengeki Bunko/Miki will allow this to happen. </br>  <br> She had felt he would truly leave for some place she would never be able to reach. <br><br> So she did not care how pathetic it was. She did not care if everyone treated her like a weed or stone on the side of the road, if her pride as Tokiwadai Middle School’s Ace was torn to shreds, or if Academy City’s #3 was entirely useless in the face of a “true conflict”. <br><br> Magic? Magic God? <br><br> She did not understand the words everyone else was using. She could not share in their meaning, she could not imagine what they were talking about, and she could not keep up. That fact was a powerful blow. <br><br> But she could put all of that off until later. <br><br> She could go through it all bit by bit based on what she did understand. <br>This volume is really opening up plot for Mikoto to become stronger in the future. What else is there besides Mikoto getting her awakened wings? Perhaps being Aleister's favorite toy will amount to something.<br><br> Niang-Niang <br>Best new Magic God that should be the one to live with Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your projections of your desires of course.</br>  <br>It's already happened unless the spoilers are wrong</br>  <br> Nuitfag is back </br>  <br>Misaki was still given hope that Touma would remember and one day have a sweet talk, Misaka character is just being destroyed and probably remade in future volumes. Anything she understood is all shattering before her eyes.</br>  <br> Misaka has it worse <br>To this point the only thing that has happened is she realized how she weak is compared to touma's current threats and how little she knows about anything. Misaki has the love of her life will never remember her, and this has been going for over a year. She doesn't even have option of trying harder like mikoto.</br></br>  <br> Best new Magic God that should be the one to live with Touma. <br>She dies like a bitch and it serves her right.</br></br>  <br>Theres evidence of what I suggested happening</br>  <br>js06 has already said the spoilers were wrong on many things</br>  <br>If they are, fine. But if they are not my point stands</br>  <br> Misaki was still given hope <br>When? She wasn't given any indication that it would change, she just hopes it might.</br></br>  <br> there is evidence for what I am saying if you misinterpret things in the manner I laid out </br>  <br> Misaka makes starts  <br> Magic gods pluck them out like nothing  <br><br>Seriously, it seems more like referencing Misaka can be thrown out at any time because she is irrelevant and humans which is us feel passion for such an unimportant character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is the beauty of an anon board, you can pretend you never said anything.</br>  <br>Niang Niang shat all over Mikoto and she died. Neph was nice to her and she lived.<br><br>It's a no-brainer who is the one that deserves to live and should be with Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>Based Jsbro.</br>  <br>Granted, we have to admit that Misaki's the most tragic heroine in the Toumabowl, something that she never have a part of in the first place.</br>  <br>Mikoto knows her chances with Touma are over. Get over it. She'll move on to better things</br>  <br> She'll move on to better things <br>Like Kuroko?</br></br>  <br>Misaki can try harder its just she is too irrelevant to be put in the story.</br>  <br>Fuck no. Like being an actual part of the story.</br>  <br>Just like Misaki.</br>  <br> that pic again <br>You need a life</br></br>  <br>But Kuroko's already moved on.</br>  Uho hoiii  <br> MIsaki <br> Seria <br> Mikoto <br> Index <br> Tsukuyomi <br> Agnese <br> Ursula <br><br>Well, there's only Kanzaki, Itsuwa, and a few others left.<br>So who else are withdrawing from Toumabowl?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Misaka being aware of Misaki feelings for Touma, is she even aware that she's not the only girls who love him?</br>  <br> Misaki <br> Not Index <br>Anon, just one volume was enough to make you think this but given the testimonies from Index's former friends I think she still tops all of them haremettes so far.<br><br>When Touma mentioned her hair fragance. Misaki was startled, perhaps she saw hope or baseless Hope that however is open too the future.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Othinus survives this arc and returns to her normal size then the Toumabowl is over.</br>  <br>Go away.<br><br><br>Don't exaggerate, anon. Besides, Nephthys also paid Mikoto no heed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but Index's feeling for Touma is more of a filial, platonic friendship not differing from the one she had for Styl, Kaori, or even that alchemist.</br>  <br>Othinus is shit deserves to die. Toums along with her.</br>  <br>She knows 10032 and the clones crush on him, at least. Maybe Index too.</br>  <br>You're shit.</br>  <br>I love reading anons who are so deep in their mantra they have to no choice but to dig the hole deeper.</br>  <br>Oh wow you totally showed me</br>  <br>Can't wait to read some Magic goddesses interactions if there's any in the next volume.</br>  <br>So far she thinks Misaki wants to mess with Touma because he is acquaintance of Mikoto.<br>Mikoto is as clueless about Misaki's past with Touma as much as she is with magic.<br><br><br>Let's not start with that BS shrug off from the typical nay sayer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing she probably suspects Seria at this point.</br>  <br>That would be such a beautiful scene where Touma and Othinus die together while in love taking their last breaths as they move on to a better place.</br>  <br>Quality reply for a quality post alright.</br>  Horrible things happen to people who were on the verge of winning the T.<br><br>One got prison-zoned, one got amnesia-zoned, and the last got fairy-zoned.</br></br>  What do we know about Anti-Touma so far?  <br>No girl will be any different</br>  <br> One got prison-zoned, one got amnesia-zoned, and the last got fairy-zoned. <br><br>Not sure if I remember the former two.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no exaggeration though. Mikoto would have been killed if Touma wasn't there to stop the attack. It's also better to ignore than shit on someone. That's why Niang Niang dies.</br>  <br>  last got fairy-zoned <br>Still going strong winning the Toumabowl where none of the other girls can compare.</br></br>  <br>She did show up in Index II during the class hotpot party, iirc.</br>  <br>He's got straight hair.</br>  Where is Thor?  <br>Itsuwa and Misaki obviously. I guess index may also count as amnesia-zoned.<br><br> And itsuwa isn't really in jail. </br></br></br>  <br>Kamachi better deliver.</br>  <br>I'm guessing prison-zoned is Itsuwa and amnesia-zoned is Misaki.<br><br><br>It's time to stop posting, Mugino.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Killed a loli</br>  <br> delusional <br><br>No girl is winning or will win the Toumabowl.</br></br></br>   She shook her head and forced down the phrase that was rising from her throat. <br>I'm a little confused by this phrase. Is she basically on the verge of confessing?</br>  <br>The only one of those three that were "close to winning the T" is living in his house now.</br>  <br><br><br> Itsuwa <br><br>Must've been that SS then.<br><br>Also<br><br><br>I thought Mugino hates male characters to care about anyone winning the T-bowl and would rather see Kuroko winning her Onee-sama. Or  Kamachi reviving Frenda and getting it on with Mugino </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Kamachi killing off lolis but putting shotas in the spotlight?</br>  When will Chimera come back?  Being a haremette is true suffering.  <br> being this new </br>   faggots still thinking any girl was close to winning Touma or will ever be close to winning Touma   <br> Must've been that SS then. <br><br>Its a forced meme that she killed Tatemiya while doing sword catching.</br></br></br>  <br>It seems you forgot about Othinus</br>  <br><br>Might as well say I don't know there's a thing called the T-bowl.  And that there was such as thing as Raildex generals. <br><br><br>Shit, I remember now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems you're one of the faggots I was talking about</br>  <br>Fuck off with the false flagging<br> posting the same pics </br></br>  Can't wait for this iteration of Touma to die so we can get Touma 4.0.  So was nyang going to kill mikoto? i don't know anything about her religion to know what the special swords do.  <br>Not even a shipper but Othinus was pretty close in NT10. I mean, if Kamachi decided to go full romance with her it would have made sense.</br>  <br>I can't feel bad for her, its her own fault if she can't get closer to him after this. All she has to do is say "By the way, where can I learn about this 'magic' stuff you kept talking about?" and he'd hook her up with Index/Othinus. Hell, he can give a decent explanation himself. She could even use it as an excuse to take him out for lunch or something.<br><br>Accel and Mugino are better at interacting like normal human beings than she is at this point.</br></br></br>  <br> Shit, I remember now <br>I'm sure you do.</br></br>  <br> I'm not a shipperfag but I ship this thing!!! </br>  <br> deflection </br>  <br>Magic Gods don't even see humans as anything but a pebble on the road. Niang Niang's reacting out wasn't done out of contempt or for any other purpose than swatting a bug out of the way. That's how Magic Gods roll.</br>  <br> Accel and Mugino are better at interacting like normal human beings than she is at this point. <br> Mugino <br>Until Hamazura enters the scene, that is.<br><br><br>Is that seriously what you got out of that post?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's not that bad.</br></br>  <br> being a filthy shipperfag </br>  <br>And that's why she died. Karma is a bitch. You don't touch the most plot armored girl in the series.</br>  <br>Yes, if Touma didn't destroy the weapons she would be kill.</br>  <br> being a broken recorder </br>  <br>This. Mikoto brings on her own suffering. She doesn't deserve to win. <br><br>In fact, she deserves to lose hard like this other tsundere.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a nice subtle way of telling her to shut the fuck up</br>  <br>THK pls go.</br>  I cannot wait for all shipperfags to eat their own diarrhea when all the ships sink and its revealed shippingshit was only in this novel to help it sell more  One does not simply kill a Misaka.  <br>Accelerator would like a word or 10031 with you</br>  <br> Best girl losing as usual.jpg </br>  <br>I can't wait to see your face when Index wins.</br>  <br>I meant it in meta. Fans would riot.</br>  <br>She fired her railgun at Touma's ass and school because he was wearing a stupid outfit during a stupid event. She is that bad.<br><br>Accel wouldn't endanger people like that and Mugino at least waits for smartass remarks or threats before she lasers shit now.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd laugh tbh</br>  <br>I would actually be pretty happy</br>  <br> Any girl being close to wining. </br>  <br>Misaka's inner thoughts and her interactions with Touma have been great so far.

Would anyone be happy about that?  Shippers ever simply have fun with reading ?<br>this is great volume.</br>  <br> mouths off to a god <br>gets upset when she almost gets killed<br> tries to fight a person who touma told her they had no shot against <br>gets upset when she loses<br><br>Mikoto started it both times.

Right, we get it.</br></br>  <br>I literally despise most of (if not all) of Touma and Mikoto's interactions. I love Mikoto as a character but she has god awful chemistry with Touma.

She knows full well the kind of monster High Priest was after the first time. It's not a matter of intelligence, but pride for her. But most important, is not losing Touma to them hence her small outburst to stop Touma.</br>  <br> if other girls do it <br>Like who? How many times they did?</br></br>  Best Mummy won't appear.  <br> She knows full well the kind of monster High Priest was after the first time. <br>kek</br></br>  <br>I think she was implying that the battery being used to do tricks at the same time as her charging it would cause it to overheat.</br>  <br>Other girls haven't fired artillery at his fucking school.

You just have to read her fight with Gensei to realize that.</br>  <br> taking gag comedy scenes literally <br><br>anon, you might have issues</br></br></br>  <br>Othinus literally killed Touma millions of times.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>rcL-FqGhEpV5p0OQWwA5Ww/<br>Haha oh wow.</br></wbr></br>  <br> comparing a six inch girl, a little girl, and fukiyose to the railgun <br>Don't try to bring in NT9, Othinus was his enemy at the time. Misaka has now reason to attack touma.</br></br>  <br>It's okay. She said she was sorry.</br>  <br>As his enemy, not a goddamn love interest.</br>  <br>Every girl in his harem has comedyhurt him. except itsuwa, she made him lunch.</br>  <br> now reason <br>damn it<br>No reason</br></br></br>  <br>When did she say that?</br>  <br>If she hasn't, then she's a fucking bitch.</br>  <br>Railguns are comedymurder.</br>  <br>Even if it's Touma's responsibility that she lives? Okay.</br>  <br>  With all the chaos in Denmark finally over, Kamijou took a deep breath and talked with Othinus, who was still trying to avoid Sphinx's wild hunt <br> " I must say, you were quite a bitch for putting me through so much shit for such a retarded reason" <br> Without even looking at him, the former Magic God replied <br> " Yeah, sorry" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Let it go, dude, it was just shit writing. Her using multiple railguns on toumas butt goes her entire character.</br>   People defend the Othinus cop out at the end of NT10 because "Touma will need someone to give him advice on magic gods" <br> Fairy Othinus is only present when St. Germain appears, then fucks off with the headcrab. <br> When actual magic gods appear, they themselves are the ones giving advice to Touma. <br><br>God fucking dammit, she could have gone out with a bang.</br></br></br></br>  <br> except itsuwa, she made him lunch. <br>Objectively best girl for Touma.<br><br>She is the only one that can give Touma some relief from all the violent whores surrounding him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Othinus is shit and will always be shit until she dies at which point she will be a dead shit.</br>  <br>A Railgun is slower than her usual lightning spears, you know. And it's slapstick comedy. You're not supposed to take it seriously when the whole mood and lighthearted tone is being shoved in your face.<br><br><br>Are you retarded? That wasn't comedy at all. It was serious and plot related. Comparison is invalid.<br><br><br>Slapstick violence is always harmless in comedy. Bites that should kill a person, punches that sends people flying away, and lighting blasts that are lethal, they're harmless when it matters in comedy. Mikoto's Railgun is no different. Stop grasping at straws.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Romance <br> In TAMNI </br>  <br><br> "Yeah, sorry" <br><br>Oh. Alright then.</br></br></br></br>  <br> this mad Mikotofag <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>Itsuwa is boring shit.</br>  <br>I agree with most of you said but you're trying too hard, also consider this is /a/.

These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. With the May 2013 publication of the DSM-5 diagnostic manual, all autism disorders were merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD. Previously, they were recognized as distinct subtypes, including autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger syndrome. <br><br>ASD can be associated with intellectual disability, difficulties in motor coordination and attention and physical health issues such as sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances. Some persons with ASD excel in visual skills, music, math and art.<br><br>Autism appears to have its roots in very early brain development. However, the most obvious signs of autism and symptoms of autism tend to emerge between 2 and 3 years of age. Autism Speaks continues to fund research on effective methods for earlier diagnosis, as early intervention with proven behavioral therapies can improve outcomes. Increasing autism awareness is a key aspect of this work and one in which our families and volunteers play an invaluable role.<br>SO YOU ARE THE ONE AUTIST WITH YOUR IROHA PICTURES AND SCREENCAPS FUCKER!"!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SO YOU ARE THE ONE AUTIST WITH YOUR IROHA PICTURES AND SCREENCAPS FUCKER!"!! <br>How fucking angry must a human being be to actually write this.

He'll make him his boytoy for 8man's new utopia.<br><br>Haruno is too risky, he'll much rather play itself and get ISIS to behead her.</br></br></br>  <br>We have different opinions on what shitposting is, then. Speaking of which, there's plenty of obvious shitposting on this threads that hasn't been deleted.<br>Though, three different anons posting the same image within the minute was quite interesting.<br><br>Oh, and have a silly Ebina.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Totsuka. He boosts army morale greatly and is also very  cute .</br>  <br>I still dont know why people tried to copy the "Good Irohasu".<br>If the guy who does it almost always does it on time (which he did on this thread as well)</br></br>  Correct me if I'm wrong but 8man has 7 girls who want to fuck him right now.<br><br>1 Haruno<br>2 Yui<br>3 Yukino<br>4 Saki<br>5 Rumi<br>6 Sensei<br>7 Iroha<br><br>I wonder how Ebina and Miura feel about him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Saika. He'll make him his boytoy for 8man's new utopia.<br><br>Haruno is too risky, he'll much rather play it safe and get ISIS to behead her.</br></br>  <br>Miura still finds him creepy, Ebina likes him in a friendly way.</br>  <br>Ebina masturbates to HayaHachi. Miura only wants to fuck Hayama.</br>  So /a/, how do you feel about Iroha?<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4969787</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313922 <br>Fuck, never mind my stupidity. I didn't know that those changes went live on the site.<br>Oops.</br></br>  <br>yui<br>Also, why is the captcha so much easier on strawpoll?</br></br>  <br>What the fuck /a/? You feel "Yui" about Iroha?</br>  <br>I feel that Iroha should be replaced by Yui. So there would be two Yuis.</br>  <br><br>YUI</br></br>  <br>Yui is always the answer.</br>  <br>So basically you want to ruin the entire show, huh.<br>I really don't understand you genki girl lovers.</br></br>  <br>No I meant proper Yui, tsundere Yui. Iroha isn't too bad though.</br>  <br>They feel kanji: YUI  (hiragana: suffering)  about Iroha</br>  <br> No I meant proper Yui, tsundere Yui. <br>Fucking hell, you disgust me.</br></br>  <br>Why should I care about what some Irohafag feels?</br>  <br>You shouldn't, your shit taste remains your own.</br>  <br>That's right, anon!</br>    <br>I've already cropped it and enlarged it for viewing pleasure.</br>  <br>どうも</br>  <br><br>Can she even afford a Yukata?</br></br>  <br>No, she had to borrow it from her grandmother.</br>  <br>So it's special family relic passed down from generation to generation?</br>  <br>Yes, the next one to have it will be IroHachi's daughter.</br>  What would be the personality of Hachiman's child/ren with<br><br>A)Yukino<br>B)Yui<br>C)Iroha</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaa-san, <br>   why is there blood stains on this? </br></br>  <br>Let's hope Zaimokuza's daughter doesn't take too much after her dad then, it probably isn't cheap to let out an heirloom kimono like that.</br>  <br>God damn it 8man, you just had to do it, didn't you?</br>  <br>A) Loner because they're an icy cunt<br>B) Loner because they're too happy and energetic and it creeps people out<br>C) Loner because they're poor</br></br></br>  Now that's alpha.    How would we all feel if Yui started using her Yuis to her advantage?  <br>This generals keep going.<br><br>What are mods doing? You people have already run off things to talk about and keep repeating the same shit every thread</br></br></br>  <br>Mods are actually in the threads deleting shitposts and spam regularly.</br>  <br> I feel inferior to your bad posture, weak body, ugly mug, shorter height, and shit personality <br> alpha </br></br>  <br><br>This makes me mad.<br><br>I mean it's ok you want to self-insert as an autistic faggotface that has hot chicks on your dick but don't pull that kind of shit.<br>Hayama has nothing to feel inferior against Hachiman. <br><br>He can just ignore his autistic ass and keep winning in life</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad.</br>  <br> Hayama has nothing to feel inferior against Hachiman <br>Lack of high expectations from peers? Ability to change people?</br></br>  <br> How will 8man resist final form Yukino? <br><br>Silly anon, 8man didn't even lift a finger to resist Yukino despite beauty sonnets he made. He has always been desperately grasping straws and keep his mind sane whenever Yui is around.</br></br></br>  <br>being a people-pleasing faggot is hardly "winning at life" even if you are the supposed king of the school.</br>  <br>You only say this because you were like hachiman in highschool, "intelligent, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humor", except real life girls won't even touch someone with that kind of personality, look where you are now.</br>  <br> He has always been desperately grasping straws and keep his mind sane whenever Iroha is around. <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Are you an intelligent person?</br>  Off to bed lads. Stay Yui.  <br>Be realistic. Hachiman is way more attractive than he makes it out to be, and especially with girls like Yukino who are attracted to his only physical downside, there is no way he wouldn't have ended up with a harem</br>  <br>cancer cancer cancer</br>  <br> “Say you, if you’re going out with Yui, then you should understand what the deal is with Ebina, right?” <br><br> “T-T-There’s no way we’re going out or anything…” <br><br> Being suddenly told information about my own well-being that I didn’t know, I hurriedly retorted in response. Oh gosh, what’s with this girl? What’s she saying out of the blue? I-It’s not l-like I’m going out with that girl or anything at all! <br><br> As the gross feeling of droplets of sweat trickled down my body, Miura looked at me and mocked me from the depths of her heart with a laugh. <br><br> “What exactly are you misunderstanding here? Gross. Like Yui and Hikio could be going out. That’s not the issue, you know? I’m talking about Yui once you actually talk to her. Gross.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see her vaginabones. And now I can see my dick. Thanks.</br>  Sigh, looks like I am alone again.  <br>you should at least post the higher-rez version.</br>  <br> Sigh </br>  <br> You see, as you smile more and more… (Changing world) <br>Anyone know the other things the background singers say?</br></br>  At this point, a yukino end in the next volume with no sort of time skip would be a bigger asspull than any other girl winning (except for Yui).  <br> bigger asspull than any other girl winning (except for Yui). <br>You mean that, after 11 volumes of nothing but being shit on, things will completely turn around and go as far as a romance in just one volume for Yui, and it won't be an asspull?<br>Yuifags never fail to amaze me.</br></br></br>  <br>You need to work on your reading comprehension.</br>  <br>Why hasn't that hyper fag Hikki tapped this yet? She would let him and there would be no strings attached if he did. If her and 8man did it she wouldn't look too much into it and would be cool about it.</br>  <br>8man knows better than to stick his dick in crazy.</br>  <br> *won't be a gigantic asspull? <br>Thanks for pointing that out, I was sure I had missed a word there.</br></br>  <br>Yukino would solve her identity issues then the last few chapters will be 8man's request/love triangle<br>That's where it's a toss up between Yui or Yukino or friendship end, and none are really asspull</br></br>  <br>Not really, we already know Yukino can stand up for herself, the problem is she doesn't anymore because she lacks any of that confidence she had form the start.<br><br>Yukino is a strong girl but something shook her up.</br></br></br>  <br>nice job not paying any attention to how 8man and Yui's relationship has changed over the course of the last three volumes there. But then you probably just skipped all the chapters that didn't have Iroha in them anyway, so it's to be expected.</br>  <br>Yui is an emotionally balanced good girl who would be fine with other girls dating him because she hasn't invested that much into her relationship with Hikki. She isn't a slut like Yukino who eye rapes Hikki.</br>  <br> But then you probably just skipped all the chapters that didn't have Iroha in them anyway, so it's to be expected <br>As tempting as that may be, I can't do that if I want to see what's going on with the MC.<br>At least most of us Irohafags know that our chances are very, very small. And that of Yukino's is very, very big now that she's about to get a ton of character growth.<br>Perhaps you should learn from our example, hm? And we're the delusional ones here, huh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She said it herself that she's not a nice girl.<br><br>I'm fairly certain she would abduct and/or murder any girl 8man started dating with the exception of Yukino in the hopes of getting a 3P.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't follow the conversation or anything<br>but yes, you are the delusional ones</br></br>  <br> 8man and Yui's relationship has changed over the course of the last three volumes <br>And Yukino's magically doesn't?<br>I don't know how autistic you are to skip an entire series starting with two introverts loathing each other to the point where one actively shows her care and the other emphasize her 'resigned smile'. Take your fucking waifu goggles off.</br></br></br>  <br>She still have some tsun in her.</br>  <br> She said it herself that she's not a nice girl. <br>Explain to me how she wasn't a nice girl during the end of vol 11?<br><br>She has not shown any jealousy or anger towards those sluts eye balling her Hikki.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's unfortunate that 8man is a penguin. Only one can win.</br>  <br>Reading way too much into my post there anon. Never said word one against Yukino or her chances.</br>  <br><br><br>Is she going to solver all of her problems in one volume? She has dependency issues, identity issues, and an inferiority complex (which she tries to hide by acting tough). As we have seen, Yukino is a frail girl. I'm not saying she can't change, however, fixing all of her issues in one volume is a huge asspull.<br><br>As much as I hate time skips, Watari is going to have to do one if he wants 8man to hook up with Yukino (considering that we have 1-2 volumes left). It will be nothing less than an ass pull if she ends up with him with her current problems. Her kind of problems are something that she has to gradually learn to overcome, It's not something that can be fixed in a single day. If they start dating, their relationship would be unhealthy as fuck, it will truly represent a symbiotic relationship.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that why both of them got depressed when they looked at the penguin sign?Is it because it reminded them that there is only one? <br><br> Yukino/Yui should be like Loli from Molester Man, take the loss with grace. </br></br></br>  <br>8man is a penguin? I thought he was a bear/fish/cat/bat/penguin/panda hybrid</br>  <br>Welp, I though you were </br>  <br>So essentially a penguin.</br>  <br>Yui pls</br>  <br>Okay since you still haven't caught on let me explain in a way that even you should understand.<br><br>Your message  indicated that you dislike Yuifags because you believe that it would be an "asspull" for Yui to win in volume 12.<br>You made that response because you believed that the person you were responding to excluded Yui from the "asspull" ending list.<br><br>What you failed to realize is that  actually indicated that (s)he believed that the only ending that would be more of an "asspull" than a Yukino ending would be a Yui ending.<br><br>Let me break it down for you.<br> a yukino end in the next volume with no sort of time skip would be a bigger asspull than any other girl winning <br>So in terms of "asspull" what has been indicated so far is : Yukino end &gt; all other girls<br>Then (s)he says<br> (except for Yui) <br>So now it's : Yukino end &gt; all other girls except Yui<br><br>Logically we can conclude that the "asspull" level goes as follows: Yui &gt;= Yukino &gt; all other girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of her issues are connected, and Watari isn't going to have a lot of space assuming he's going to do one volume, so in that case there's probably gonna be one challenge to face and that will "fix" her somehow. If there's 2 volumes then that's a lot of space that even a fucking Iroha end would be possible if he chooses to develop her in the 2 novels. <br><br>He wouldn't even try to make Yukino and 8man end up with each other in her moe state, I guarantee that. But a timeskip is barely something that would even develop characters for the most part and it typically ends up a shitty asspull like Usagi drop<br><br>It really depends on how Watari does it. You can't really say it's an asspull without really reading the novel, can you? If he does it well then it won't be an asspull, simple as that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So we all just got grammar-trolled by a retarded Irohafag. I feel so ashamed of myself right now.</br>  How many people would burn their books if the genki hard working girl wins instead of their first girl ice melting trope FOR ONCE?<br><br>As much as I'd love to see a Yui end,<br>I honestly don't think that Watari have the balls to pull this off.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing to worry about anon, if you wish to improve your reading comprehension the best way to do it is to have these sorts of discussions and try to figure out exactly what people are trying to say.</br>  <br>I'm a Yukinofag and honestly wouldn't mind Yui winning.</br>  <br>As a Yuifag I think Yukino is best girl and should obviously win.</br>  <br> As a Yuifag I think Yukino is best girl <br><br>What the fuck are you doing? Do you want to be tossed overboard nigga?</br></br></br>  <br>Practically nobody. Contrary to the meme, most Yukinofags aren't autistic enough to go off like that, and only a handful of Irohafags think she's got better than a snowball's chance in hell without the series going further than volume 12.</br>  <br>I wish I could feel the same way, but if I'm being honest I'd be disappointed in a Yui ending.<br>I think 8man and Yukino have a stronger understanding of each other so it would be a shame to see that connection go to waste.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with Yui though, she's a very sweet girl who's love for 8man is quite heartwarming. She could easily make 8man a very happy man and they would be a good match but the potential of their relationship is simply lesser than that of 8man and Yukion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As an Irohafag I agree, Yukino deserves to win because she is best girl, Yui is fine too after Yukino though.</br>  <br>Posting best doujin</br>  <br> indicated that you dislike Yuifags because you believe that it would be an "asspull" for Yui to win in volume 12. <br>Seems that I'm not the one with reading comprehension issues.</br></br>  <br>Can we just all agree to report this shit? I'm tired of seeing the same spam every single thread.</br>  Yuifag here, I am ranking the endings<br>1. Yui <br>2. Yukino<br>3. 3P<br>4. Open<br>5. Other girl end<br>6. Loner<br>7. Friends</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> connection go to waste <br>they can stay as platonic friends after he ends up with Yui, I'm sure she wouldn't mind</br></br>  <br>As a Irohafag I think that Iroha and Tobe are OTP.</br>  <br>Most people would've already learned their lesson by now, you know?</br>  <br>Do you not see how that would be the most awkward relationship ever?<br><br>8man and Yui as husband and wife but 8man spends all his time talking to Yukino and going on platonic dates as friends.</br></br></br>  <br>As a Harunofag I also think Yukino is best girl and deserves to win because of that.</br>  <br>I'd almost say I'd prefer 3P over Yui end myself, but first off there's just no chance it'll happen and secondly there's even less chance of it getting executed well instead of being some shitty borderline open end.</br>  <br>I apologize for the clusterfuck that my wording  has made. What I tried to say is:<br><br>Yukino ending in the next volume= biggest asspull<br><br>Any other girl end besides Yui = still an asspull but not as big as Yukino's<br><br>Yui ending = won't be an asspull, unless you are an animeonlyfag. If you carefully read the novels, you can clearly see that 8man truly cares for her and is conscious of her (up to what level, that is up to debate). However, what matters is that the flags are there and if the spoilers for volume 11 (the untranslated parts) and volume "a" are any indication, it seems like Yui gets more proper romantic flags than from any previous volume.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think 8man and Yukino have a stronger understanding of each other so it would be a shame to see that connection go to waste. <br><br>They don't need love to be together, they're the kind to stand by each others side until the end.</br></br></br>  <br> they're the kind to stand by each others side until the end <br>That's called marriage anon</br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>You're right that they're awkward, they won't even be able to talk much in front of her because they're so awkward. Yui wouldn't care much if they spent a lot of alone time together as platonic friends.<br><br>Sex is a platonic activity too, right? It's just physical activity between two friends.</br></br></br>  <br>Arrogance isn't healthy anon, especially when you're so insecure about your opinions that you feel the need discredit your opposition with petty insults.</br>  <br><br>Contrary to what your non-experience with the opposite sex has led you to believe, men and women actually can just be friends.<br><br>Yes, even if they had been together at one point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't bring up such a weird concept Anon, they aren't going to pursue something that intimate.<br><br><br>It's not like 8man and Yukino ever really functioned like normal people, Yui would probably misinterpret it while Yukino and 8man would probably wonder why she's making such a fuss about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said that they couldn't. I said that it would be awkward.<br><br>Are you trying to say that you think it's not awkward for a husband to have a deeper relationship with another woman than he does with his wife?<br><br>It would be one thing if it was his mother or Komachi but Yukino isn't family and they both clearly had feelings of greater or lesser degrees for one another during their high school days.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if Yui misinterprets their awkward actions as them being intimate  and was actually right ? <br>How would she react?</br></br>  As a Yuifag I think that 8man should end up with Yukino. Thus he will achieve hapines and girl friendship will be saved.    <br>going off into the subjective end of the pool there. 8man's relationship with Yukino isn't deeper than Yui's, it's just different.<br><br>It's been said a hundred different times in these threads, albeit in different words, but Yukino is a like mind to 8man while Yui is a pillar of support. Either is a viable foundation for a strong and lasting relationship.</br></br></br>  Seems like things haven't changed.  <br>Yep, Irohafags still like to brag that they outnumber otherfags as if it's something that matters.</br>  Tobe x Iroha OTP  How much does Yui love her Hikki? Is it a shallow crush or is it deep love?  <br> Tobe <br>I prefer Zaimokuza honestly</br></br>  <br>Why are you triggered? Nobody is bragging.</br>  Am I the only one here enthralled by the Megu Megu Megurin Megurin Power ? Not that I expect her to be relevant in the end of course  and I hope it stays that way so I can keep her for myself .  <br>Tobe x 8roha 4 lyfe.</br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  Irohasu~  <br>The only girl who was kind to 8man without any pretense, care, or ulterior motive.<br><br>Megurin is too pure for this anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Zaimokuza = Watari's self insert <br> Watari loves his kouhai <br> Zaimokuza wants to become an editor <br> Iroha wants to marry an editor </br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is Yui?</br>  <br>Not if 8man becomes one first you fucker.</br>  <br>Megurin~ a fluff. A FLUFF!!</br>  <br>He's going to be a househusband after he marries Yukino though</br>  <br>Yes but there's a difference between those two types.<br><br>From a business minded approach Yui is the obvious pick.<br>She possess social skills and perspectives that 8man does not.<br>It's more time efficient to establish a partnership where either person specializes in particular skill sets that both reap the rewards of.<br>That, by it's very nature, is quite practical which is why many relationships in the world are founded the same way.<br><br>With Yukino it's more of a philosophical ideal. To found a relationship on desire rather than need. A relationship where understanding and trust are held at paramount importance. The idea behind the relationship comes from a mental experiment. If you had everything you could possibly need, what would you want? For many the answer is to be truly understood.<br>Unfortunately such a thing is impossible. Humans are incapable of transmitting their thoughts and feelings directly to another human being. Regardless, it's an ideal people strive for, sometimes for their entire lives.<br>Imagine it like phi and the golden ratio. Phi is imperfect and the further it goes on the closer it will get to the perfection of the golden ratio. Ultimately it's futile because it will never get there. Nevertheless the journey towards that ideal is what it's all really about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you bite obvious baits?</br>  <br> Thinking Yukino and her family will tolerate her having a jobless husband <br><br>House-husband end is Saki only. Sorry pal.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino will be busy with her job 8man will probably get some job where he works from home while taking care of the kids.</br>  <br>tl;dr</br>  <br><br>I got it this time<br>8man becomes a writer and Yukino becomes a businesswoman<br>8man's first book is "My adult romantic comedy is right as expected"</br></br></br></br>  <br>The entire romcom was wrong, the romance wasn't.</br>  <br>Whose grave are they standing over?</br>  <br>Amazing how on the VN Yukino still behaves like a fucking pet.</br>  <br> Their own. </br>  <br> She twisted her ankle trying to walk Sable. </br>  <br> genki <br> hardworking <br>Who'd burn their books if it's an ORIMOTO end?<br>She does have some parallels with Chihiro, so it won't be an asspull.<br> normalest normalfag <br> got courted by the MC, but it doesn't go anywhere. <br> MC got so butthurt he turned into a cockroach. <br><br>Now we just need 8man courting her and Iroha at the same time.<br>Then have him drop Iroha because he doesn't think she's genuine.<br>8man takes Orimoto to a V-day dance collaboration between Soubu High and her high school.<br>They go to the school roof top to watch the fireworks via the secret unlocked staircase.<br>8man dumps her right before they kiss and says "Ha-ha... I tricked you. I only pretended to like you to get back at you for bullying me in junior high."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   loves 8man more than any other girl <br> supports him more than any other girl <br> understands him more than any other girl <br> cares about him more than any other girl <br> he has hurt her the most out of any girl <br> has worked the hardest for his sake <br> accepts him for what he is <br>There is no good reason why she shouldn't win.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then how did they die? </br>  <br>Saki-fag here.<br><br>Morale on the ship is low but if Orimoto inexplicably won, I'd love it purely for the ass-blasted reaction of all the other shipper-fags.</br></br></br>  <br>Both will win in the end. Yukino will win Hikigaya-kun's and independence, Yui will win a cookie man.</br>    <br>That isn't much of a choice there Gahama-san. I would pick yandere because at least I would have a shot of not dying. Icould just break up with her later. I could cheat on her anyways and it would be fine if she doesn't find out.</br>  <br>She didn't take it too well when she found out Hikki got Yukino a Pan-san and all she got was a dog collar.</br>  <br>She's not his type.</br>  <br> implying the collar won't be a regular fixture of Yui and 8man's love life. </br>  <br>I'm not sure that many people would actually be that upset by an Orimoto end.<br><br>She's really not that unlikeable.</br></br></br>  <br>What is a "type?"</br>  <br>8man doesn't have a type, he was focusing on "liking them".<br>The type didn't matter since he fell for all the previous girls for the exact same thing, they all showed him just a bit of compassion and he misunderstood that.<br><br>That aside someone make a gif of Orimoto shaking those sleeves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, I got to thinking: Did we ever find out how Yui felt about Yukino and 8man's date?</br>  <br>In the LN she never knew about the date because she saw them at the animal expo thing and Yukino asked him out after the misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Romantic chemistry and/or natural attraction.<br><br><br> 8man doesn't have a type <br>Girls like Komachi.<br><br> The type didn't matter since he fell for all the previous girls for the exact same thing, they all showed him just a bit of compassion and he misunderstood that. <br>Good job missing the entire point of the conversation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Girls like Komachi. <br>Not exactly girls like Komachi, he likes girls that can take care of him.<br><br>Komachi basically took up the roll of mom in his life since 8mom is always working or sleeping, Komachi is the one who cooks, cleans and all that for him.<br><br> I bet you think he was talking about YY with the whole quiet girl and loud girl thing. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>To elaborate, what the conversation is saying is that 8man believes his old crushes weren't "love", but he doesn't actually understand what love is.<br><br>8man and love is a lot like 8man and genuine.

Is Yukino smarter than Haruno? I imagine they must have had very similar genes but surely Yukino's isolation has granted her more time to expand her pool of knowledge than Haruno.  <br>They might be in the same floor. <br><br>Well Yukino might not be around but Hachiman, Yui, Komachi, and Iroha could man the service club in her absense</br></br></br>  <br><br>I dunno. I guess Yukino may have more book-learnin' but Haruno is some sort of insane unrealistic super-genius at reading people.<br><br>I mean Hachiman casually mentions "It wasn't genuine" in that phone talk with her and from that single insignificant line Haruno has gleaned the entire cosmic importance of 'genuine' to Hachiman to the point where she might as well have been sitting in the room when he gave his genuine speech.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll be a distance friendship.

I thought I was the only one, too bad I can't filter it or I may filter actual discussion happening</br></br>  <br>Totsuka doesn't like 8man that way.</br>  In the LN it's stated that Yukino's special class is for students preparing to go abroad or who have come back from going abroad. So technically she's not necessarily headed abroad just based being in that class since we know she's been abroad already.<br><br>Though I think she probably will end up going to a non Japanese university. It'll come down to who wants her to go abroad and why she herself may want to. If her reason for wanting to go abroad is "I've got to escape from my family" then she may decide the whole urge is unhealthy on her part.</br></br>  <br>"Genuine" was post-Orimoto date though.</br>  <br><br>  A Harunofag is this fucking insecure as to think my post was anti-Haruno <br><br>Besides even if what you say is true it's still an incredible degree of logic leaping and/or perceptiveness on her part. Though as  states the timing doesn't match up.<br><br>Remember that all Hachiman has said to her is that one fucking line. She's obviously some sort of mind reader.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I got the idea from some anon who posted it, probably you<br>Yeah you're right, I wish there was a way to identify Irohafags and filter them out, the only thing stopping me from filtering Iroha out completely is that I actually like her character, not her autistic fanbase</br></br>  <br>Or maybe she is working with Shizuka, both in some way trying to fix Yukino and Hachiman since they know how messed up both of them are.</br>  <br> Actual discussion </br>  <br>Yeah, I was slightly off base there.<br><br>It's not so much that 8man picked it up from Shizuka as it is treated as a concept that the adult characters are familiar with by default.<br><br>Speaking of which, did 8man ever bring up genuineness with Shizuka or did she also just bring it up out of hand?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah of course the author can cook some explanation up for it. But I don't think he will.<br><br>All I'm saying is that one aspect of Haruno is unrealistic. It strains credulity that she could be so clued in the significance of it to Hachiman based on that one line. Yes if the author tells us later that Sensei and Haruno are in cahoots or that Iroha told Hayama about it during her confession who then told Haruno then we'd have a reason for it.<br><br>But I seriously doubt Haruno is directly working with Sensei on this. Haruno is pretty messed up herself judging by the third memorandum in vol 10.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304388 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304395 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304417 <br>based<br><br>Irohashitters were the most cringeworthy fucks in the season threads</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah the dubs shit a while back destroyed their reputation forever.

That poster accused me of hating on Haruno. That is untrue. Critiquing their characterization is another matter. <br><br><br><br>I have read the LNs. I don't remember it being directly stated that Haruno got Iroha to tell her about Hachiman's genuine speech. Maybe it was indirectly stated and I missed it. That is quite possible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sensei is clearly familiar with the concept before 8man. <br> Haruno is clearly familiar with the concept before 8man. <br> Sensei and Haruno have had a teacher-student relationship in the past. <br> Sensei and 8man have a teacher-student relationship in the present. <br><br>Wow, such a leap of logic taking place here.<br><br><br> reputation <br>So fucking reddit it hurts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God why is Iroha such a shit?

It is a leap of logic. I'm glad you understand that.<br><br>I mean those four points do not even come close to implying some sort of active direct cooperation between Haruno and Sensei. They don't foreshadow it or even suggest it. Sensei has had many teacher-student relationships before and after Haruno.

Though, I was finally starting to get used to it now. Isshiki didn’t find that pleasing and looked at me with resentful eyes. <br> That attitude caused me to make a bitter smile. <br> Isshiki, her behavior, and her speech were charming, but there were several reasons why her actions didn’t affect me all that much in the present. Had I been myself from long ago, I’d lose my wits within the instant, no doubt about it. <br><br>Keep grasping at straws Irohafags.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> posts Gintama </br>  <br>She'll know the meaning of genuine when 8man is done pounding it into her.<br><br>And he'll make sure to remind her every night.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This will probably be devastating for you to learn about, but since you're apparently new to this website I'll go ahead and fill you in on it.<br><br>You see, just because an individual anonymous poster doesn't have to worry about their reputation on this site does not mean that group of posters acting in common don't have to worry about it. So when you participate in dubsfaggotry and everyone knows it's Irohafags that were responsible for the majority of it, it does destroy their reputation. Forever. I'm sorry if this revelation is shocking to you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the concept of 'genuine' is something everyone is familiar with. <br>So you admit there was nothing unusual about how Haruno answered 8man. I'm glad we could settle this discussion.</br></br>  <br> top kek <br> he's not even laughing in that scene </br></br>  <br><br>The concept being familiar to everyone and Haruno knowing how utterly important it is to Hachiman in particular are rather different things you know.</br></br>  <br>I raise.</br>  <br>It wasn't stated at all but given the timing it was the only possible situation Haruno learned about it. <br><br>Isshiki already has a history of not keeping her thoughts to herself and Hayama isn't such a lapdog to go reporting about every little thing he encounters to Haruno. <br><br>Besides, even with Haruno's personality surely she would have encountered the issue of being genuine in her own experiences.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  inaccurate <br><br>Really? So far I've seen two alternative explanations for it. One is some sort of hair brained theory involving Haruno and Sensei acting as in collusion to fix Yukino and Hachiman. That has almost no evidence in favor at all unless the author inserts something about it in the next volume.<br><br>The other is the poster who said that Haruno forced it out of Iroha. But I don't remember that being stated directly in vol 10 when I read it. <br><br>So until someone does point to where it was specifically stated in vol 10 (or post genuine in vol 9 I guess) I'm going with the "Haruno somehow gleaned it all from one throwaway line from Hachiman". Which means that, yes, it was unrealistic of her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm too lazy to find the one with Tobe so you win this time<br>also <br> yui with fang, not komachi <br>vomit</br></br></br></br>  <br> yui with fang, not komachi <br> vomit <br>Good to know that I'm not the only one that vomits whenever I see Yui.</br></br></br>  <br> actually trying to guilt by association on an anonymous imageboard <br><br>Reddit please fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>I want the full scan of that one.</br>  <br>I really wish that doujin was about Tobe and Iroha, not Hikki and Yui.</br>    <br><br>And maybe you're right. It's not something we can take as gospel, but it's a possibility. I would tend to think that the author would have put something in there to let us know that's what was discussed if it were true. But I really think Wataru just didn't care enough about how realistic it was for Haruno to be keyed in on that. She already has shown an extraordinarily high degree of perceptiveness, beyond real life human beings.<br><br>Harunofags are just really insecure. You make one minor little criticism of her characterization and they get incredibly bent out of shape. I actually like Haruno. Although I don't view her motives as being as clear-cut in Yukino's best interest as some Haruno defenders believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>8man brought it up when talking about his first love. Of course it would give a big tell.<br><br>Besides, you're ignoring the fact that 8man and Haruno have had a lot of interactions both before and after to familiarize her with his personality and thought process.</br></br></br>  <br>Ikr.<br>My dick vomits precum everytime I look at Yui.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't think their prior interactions or Hachiman stating that one line are enough to establish from Haruno's PoV how important 'genuine' is to him. Only his speech to the service club in vol 9 really made that clear.<br><br>Haruno acts like she was in the room when it happened. She brings it up to Hachiman as well as in her monologue in vol 10 (the latter is understandable when you consider it's importance to her independent of Hachiman) and she beats him over the head with it in vol 11, twisting the knife using insight she should not possess.<br><br>But I'm through arguing about it. So we'll just agree to disagree on it. It's subjective to some extent anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> final form Yukino <br><br>So a full-on shapeshifter?</br></br></br>  <br>Haruno makes it her business to get info about Yukino out of Hayama whether he is willing or not.<br><br>I don't remember when Hayama says this "I can see why she worries about you."<br><br>Hayama could have heard about it from people, who worry about 8man and who might talk about 8man with him. <br><br>Yui, who is in his clique.<br>Yukino, Hayama being the only male non-relative in her phone contacts<br>Iroha via confession and he assumes 8man made her that way.<br>Shizuka, who invited his clique for extra credit camp activities<br><br>So there, he's the possible leak and Haruno is Izaya, raping people for information and rustling the blonde bishounen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But I really think Wataru just didn't care enough about how realistic it was for Haruno to be keyed in on that <br>If the basis for your argument is "I think the writing is bad" you don't have an argument.<br><br> I actually like Haruno <br> Harunofags are just really insecure <br>Just because you're insecure doesn't mean you should go generalizing anyone else who happens to like the same character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like short hair and breast implants.</br>  <br>You poor soul, that's terrible. Even 8man is trying to get her off him in that pic.</br>  <br>I want summer to leave.</br>  <br>moe + ice queen</br>  <br>It's all in her genes she doesn't need implants.</br>  <br>Yuifags aren't going anywhere, sorry.</br>  <br>They will once school is back in session.</br>  <br>But these threads will die before that.</br>  <br>If only we'd be so lucky.</br>  <br>She'll just slice off winning girl's skin and wear it as a suit a la Silence of the Lamb.</br>  <br><br><br>Nice try.<br><br>But it's well established fact that most underagefags are Yukniofags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man is probably still crushing on Yukino even into volume 11, he just doesn't think he'd ever be able to get with her.</br>  <br>Have you seen these threads? Are you sure it's not the Irohafags?</br>  Will Yahari threads reach im@s and saki levels of eternal autism or will it end before the next season?  <br> There’s just one big reason amongst them all, however, and that was simple. <br> “As long as I have my little sister, I like them either way, older or younger.” <br> “That sounds like a disease far worse than being a siscon or someone into younger girls!” <br><br>8man was so unaffected by Iroha that he announced his love for Komachi in front of the club.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd gladly take autism over this /v/ faggotry.</br>  <br>He states his love for Komachi out loud many times, even Komachi states her love for Hachiman out loud.<br><br>Neither care what anyone thinks.</br></br></br>  <br>The timing is still suspect as fuck, especially considering he specifically uses Komachi as a defense against Iroha on multiple occasions.</br>  <br>The timing is a bit weird but he has absolutely no problem saying he loves Komachi, hell he's even stated he wouldn't know what he would do if they weren't related by blood.<br>Komachi didn't even mind what would probably happen if that were the case, it creeped out Yui, Yukino and to some extent Totsuka.</br></br>  <br>Not him but given what Iroha does later on the volume, I'm sure she wasn't creeped out.<br>And the timing is not weird, Komachi really did become a scapegoat for whenever Iroha is in his lewd thoughts.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but he still has context. 8man loves Komachi but he's not always honest when it comes to Komachi. (IE him saying he just likes that she takes care of him. In reality he spoils her pretty often as well.)<br><br>8man's declaration about Komachi in that scene was a direct continuation of his internal monologue about how Iroha "doesn't affect" him, he even went as far as saying it was his biggest reason. As a result, it's undeniable that he made the statement specifically in reaction to Iroha.<br><br>And that's just following 8man's thought process, not getting into the fact he self-contradicts like 5 times in that single scene to show the reader his loss of composure.</br></br></br></br></br>  autism  <br>Would anyone actually be surprised if we got an incest end?</br>  <br><br><br>Iroha != Komachi<br><br>8man doesn't even see Iroha as a "younger girl" like Komachi.<br><br> Speaking of which, she’s a year younger, isn’t she…? It certainly didn’t feel that way because she didn’t show the least amount of regard, honor, courtesy, and respect towards me, so she didn’t feel like an underclassman at all… <br><br> “If anything, you were born in April, so you’re less than a year apart from me. So you don’t feel all that much younger than me, anyway.” <br><br> It’s only after I took a couple of steps back that I could feel the gap between us. If we’re talking about the age gap from like Komachi or Haruno-san, that was obvious. Hiratsuka-sensei, that’d be… yeah. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>I was wondering when you'd show up, denialfag.<br>Though, Iroha != Komachi is correct, I'll give you that.</br></br>  Where can i find the other chapters?  <br>GJ 8man, now will you stop making excuses as to why you're not into Iroha.</br>  Do you think Watari will ever bring up the picture Yukino bought at Destinyland again  <br>Probably with Haruno finding it in Vol12.<br><br>Although, Yui slept over at Yukino's sometime during Christmas didn't she? Yukino probably has the picture tucked away somewhere.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Welp,<br>I gave up trying to argue with Irohafags.<br><br>They are so fucking deluded they actually think 8man's love for Komachi is a indication that 8man's into Iroha.<br><br>Despite 8man outright said that he doesn't see Iroha as a yonger girl.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  <br>Nobody is stopping you from doing your thing every thread every time people try to discuss anything about Iroha, you know.<br>You might as well just not read the first half of the volume, it will be very unpleasant for you.

Not volume 10,5 level unpleasant but quite close to it. <br><br>No I don't hate Iroha, I just hate Irohafaggotry and how deluded they are. <br><br>Keep calling anyone who disagree with you denialfag if this makes you feel better.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're half-corrrect but I feel like you're being misleading.<br><br>Iroha doesn't "feel" like a younger girl to 8man, but he doesn't actually realize it until he's put on the spot in the club.<br><br>Prior to that he'd probably mentally labelled her as younger/kouhai simply because that's what her status was.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Hayama knew about genuine would he see 8man in a different light?</br>  Shit I fucked up twice<br><br>meant for <br><br><br><br><br>Did I say anything about 8man doesn't have feeling for Iroha?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was just saying we don't know who the "she" is in that context and that ambiguity makes Hayama a "possible" leak.<br>And that "she" seems to talk about 8man to Hayama occasionally.<br>If that "she" was one of the girls who know about "genuine", it's not much of a stretch.<br><br>A real stretch would be Yui talking about it with Yumiko and Yumiko telling Hayama how gross Hikio is.<br><br>Any who, Haruno and 8man could've talked about it on one of their secret meet ups.<br> Haruno has been 8man's un/official GF since Orimoto's appearance. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't get it, why "Irohafags" and not just "shitposters"?<br><br>All you're doing is giving /v/ what they want by subscribing to group mentality.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui talking about it with Yumiko and Yumiko telling Hayama how gross Hikio is. <br>She knows, you all know damn well she knows.</br></br>  <br>Hayama, too, would want the 8-incher if he learned of genuine.</br>  <br>Nor did anyone say "8man's love for Komachi is a indication that 8man's into Iroha", but you.<br><br>We've only been saying that he uses Komachi as an excuse and mental block for whatever feelings he has for Iroha.<br><br>Seriously go kill yourself, but I doubt you could figure out how to operate a 12gauge shotgun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure if actually stupid or just the actual denialfag.<br><br>Basically we're deluded because we don't take her scenes out of context? That's amazing.<br>We must also be deluded for knowing that Iroha's chances are very low, right? I guess you think she will win.<br><br>I'm going to miss these threads and I'm going to miss the neutron stars that post here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do they manage to fuck it up this bad in Logos? I know it's popular to hate Aquarion, but it was never boring. Where is<br><br> GO TIGHT <br><br>Where is<br><br> OSORE <br><br>???</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How is last season and Logos? Saw the original series back when I was an entry-level babby but really liked it and not sure if watching the new series are worth it. The production value looks good at least  <br>EVOL is pretty good if you're aware of the whole Zessica thing going in (romance shit that made people angry).</br>  <br> EVOL is pretty good </br>  This should be illegal.  <br>EVOL is shit, worse than Sousei.<br><br>LOGOS is shit so far<br><br>Honestly you should drop this franchise after the OVA, that's the only decent entry in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  if you're aware of the whole Zessica thing <br>I'm not, what?<br><br><br>Well what exactly is so bad about it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The main leads are insufferable.<br><br>The mecha battle takes a backseat for the really bad drama <br><br>Cast is a downgrade<br><br>It pretty much shits on Sousei<br><br>In short its just not fun despite the good visuals and great soundtrack.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a love triangle, and /a/ and /m/ were really butthurt that the best girl  _won . If you ever saw Korra, the first series of Korra and Aquarion EVOL aired at the same time, on the same day, so it got known as NTR weekends because both had similarly annoying love triangles.<br><br>It has better animation, pretty good music, the 2 new OPs are as good as the first 2, I would recommend it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure as hell better than Genesis, fuckers.</br></br>  <br>Not even close.</br>  <br>I liked Zessica as a character, but at no point in the series I ever believed there was literally even 1% chance that she might win. It was obvious who the main love interest is since the very first episode, and that Zessica is just there for the drama and that she has no chance of winning.<br><br>I don't understand where the butthurt comes from. She was just a character introduced to suffer, like Reika in Genesis.</br></br></br>  <br>Ignore this faggot <br><br><br>He's shitposting. People don't hate EVOL mainly for the romance people hate it mainly because the cast was shit and it wasn't as fun as Sousei.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering I found Genesis' characters stupidly dull, yes. <br>EVOL &gt; Genesis<br>That being said: Logos is last at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>No, fuck you.<br>She was as garbage as the rest of the cast. People only like her because they pity her.</br></br>  <br>So shit taste? Gotcha</br>  <br>It's not so much romance as much as it is the woof woof retcon.</br>  <br>The cast is usually considered one thing it's better at, but mainly it's side cast, since the main 3 and Kagura people don't like/think they're bland, but people seem to like the hole digger guy, mix, yunoha, jin, this brown girl etc.<br><br>All though the original characters are liked as well, just seems people say EVOL had better side characters.</br></br></br>  <br>YES, you DO have a serious case of shit taste.</br>  <br> but people seem to like the hole digger guy, mix, yunoha, jin </br>  <br>Sounds like they tried to make it more like Eva but failed poorly<br><br><br> NTR <br><br><br><br>I don't know who to believe now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not exactly, the original was more Evaish. EVOL is more like Aldnoah or Cross Ange or G-Reco or whatever other post 2010's mecha you're familiar with.</br>  <br> Pierre &gt; Andy <br> Reika &gt; MIX <br> Those two nerds &gt; Yunoha and Jin <br> Rena &gt; Crea <br> Gen &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ZEN <br><br>Though pic related was nice mainly because they didn't focus much on her along with Shrade.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Final question. How do you feel about Gen from Sousei?</br>  <br>Andy became an outright douche in the second half, people only cared about Mix's tits, Yunoha became a JIN-KUN talking machine and I don't have anything negative to say about fujoshit mainly because they didn't give her much screentime.</br>  <br>What? Sorry, like I said I watched the original series a long time ago when I was still an anime babby</br>  <br>Eh...go on ahead and watch it. You probably won't care much at all.</br>    <br> How do they manage to fuck it up this bad in Logos? <br>Easy, just look at the opening credits. 11 people on planning, 11 producers and a ridiculously large production committee. Logos is the product of possibly once of the biggest tug-of-wars the industry has ever seen.</br></br>  <br> it was never boring. <br>Sugoi monogatari aniki.</br></br>  <br>EVOL had terrible writing, dumb love triangles aside. But people love to bitch about how the only reason people hate EVOL is because Zessica lost, because obviously no one in their right mind could actually care about character development or plot progression, oh no.<br><br><br>The butthurt comes in that it wasn't fair to make Mikono win when she did absolutely nothing to deserve Amata's love. Forget about Zessica, that useless bitch deserved nothing but rejection or being kidnapped away forever by Kagura.<br><br><br>I never cared about her, but I'd pick ANY girl over Mikono.<br><br><br> I liked Kagura , but dear god is so clear the writers don't give a shit about him.<br><br><br>Yunoha was the most popular female character, remember? Followed by MIX and Zessica, though I'm not sure in which order. And japanese fans hated when Jin died, so he was popular too.<br><br><br>Look, anyone that says Mikono is remotely good beyond her looks is shitposting. Even the japanese hate her guts. Probably one of the few things both japanese and western fans agree on. Only a few selected ones unironically like her, and you'll spot them right on because usually they make shit up to make her look good. Just ignore them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Correction, Zessica wasn't made to suffer. She was made to be rejected. But the whole shit rain that fell on her on the second half that made her go from pitiful to pathetic was a mistake by the writers, specifically Okada.<br><br>And I don't know about you, but I liked Zessica when she was a fun tomboy that liked to tease Amata out of fun and had actually some confidence in herself before she became a pathetic Mikono wannabe in the second half.</br></br></br>   I know it's popular to hate Aquarion <br><br>I like how my immediate dislike for Aquarion from episode one of the first season is essentially reduced to "oh, you hate x because it's simply popular to do so"<br><br>Whatever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2chan is not the general opinion. Episode 15 won second best episode and episode 13 won first. KaguraxMikono was the second most popular pairing next to Jin and Yunoha.</br>  <br> Well what exactly is so bad about it? <br><br>Characterization: Everyone are plot devices, MC suffers hard from Designated Protagonist Syndrome.<br><br>Storyline: They just seem to forget what happened in earlier episodes. Best example: "Oh, Zessica, you're alive!"<br><br>The main heroine gets a disproportionate amount of attention and importance that not even Amata, the fucking MC, gets. She's central to a story she doesn't contribute absolutely nothing to. By making everything about her and not developing her character in a positive way it drags an unnecessarily stupid and long love triangle that makes every fucking episode psychically painful to watch.<br><br>Side characters gets more development than main ones. Some of the main character (special mention to Zessica) doesn't even have a backstory to round their character.<br><br>They have no clue of what they're doing, characters suddenly act to the plot demands regardless of the way they were established in the beginning. Special mention: Pod!Kagura.<br><br>The villain is stupidly overpowered. He can do anything he wants, he has no obstacles. If he was so pissed off he could have killed everyone in a single blow if he wanted to.<br><br>Drama and portrayal of relationship is stupid as fuck. Obviously if the girl you like wets her panties for a hunk you must scream her name a thousand times and crawl on the floor so she'll notice you! Also, never do anything to earn someone's trust and affection, everyone will love you regardless of how stupid your actions are, that always works! And if you have green hair you're fucked.<br><br>The right way to fight destiny is going along with it. By Amata Sora.<br><br>The dog thing is brought up solely for the justification of the villain's existence, aside from that it it doesn't serve any purpose. It makes S1 full of plot holes and nonsensical shit, and makes Apollonius AKA Fudo look like a total asshole.<br><br>If your parents are a piece of shit and abandon you, it's always your fault. Now get up and clean their mess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2chan is not the general opinion <br>You're right, even the voice actors hated her.<br>Episode 15 is popular because it has a lot of Kagura in it. And episode 13 is the same for Jin (and Yunoha). But I don't get why you'd bring this up when I was never arguing against this.</br></br></br>      <br><br>Mikono main plot was to improve herself. She wasn't fully interested in romance and at some point she avoided it because she felt conflicted with Kagura vs Amata and Zessica's suffering. In all honesty she just wanted to protect everyone (even Kagura) but she didn't know how because she has a seemingly useless power. So she basically decided to kill herself by sacrificing herself at the end because the perfect opportunity presented itself to use her connection powers. That and the fact that Fudo was manipulating her to become an hero which she was fully aware of it (as shown by her dislike towards Fudo at the beginning) but she accepted it because she might as well make herself useful. She didn't die because she used the power of aquarion love that was fueled with Amata's love she didn't have to die.</br></br>  <br>Are you that one mikonofag that also ruined the aquarion thread at /m/? If so, please fuck off, people already told you you're delusional.</br>  The show was shit but at least the threads were fun.  <br>I don't go to /m/. You are just too fucking stupid to realize that just because an heroine is not all over MC's cock doesn't mean she is useless. She end up saving the world. Nice comeback by the way.</br>  <br>It wasn't Okada, it was Kawamori, he is the one that decided since the beginning that she was going to win no matter what, even if every writer (Okada included) liked Zessica better and wanted her to succeed.</br>    <br> She end up saving the world </br>  <br>I said Okada is the one that made Zessica look pathetic by accident, and she herself admitted it in an interview. I don't know about Kawamori.</br>  <br> She end up saving the world. </br>        <br> just because an heroine is not all over MC's cock doesn't mean she is useless. <br>  MIKONO-SAN <br>  MIKONO-SAN <br>  MIKONO-SAN <br>Repeat while Mikono sucks Kagura's dick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  this whole post </br>  <br> Spicy Onii-chan at 2 <br> 4 side characters beating out main girl in popularity <br><br>Yup, this sounds like the EVOL I remember.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get why Cayenne was popular, he was basically a homo brocon that didn't got much screentime.</br>  <br>*siscon, I mean</br>  <br> implying that Mikono has no personality <br>Please. Amata said that she's a good girl, deal with it.</br></br>   come into thread expecting naked loli discussion <br> get EVOL bitching </br>  Mikono is my waifu, fucking deal with it.  <br>I liked his relationship with Shrade. The homo teasing was annoying but Shrade pissing him off was fun.</br>  <br>Amata's opinion is not the most reliable one.</br>  <br>Kawamori pls go and stay go.</br>  <br>Who gives a shit about her, Crea is better.</br>  <br>It all makes sense now.</br>  <br>Talking about Logos bro</br>  <br>Crea &gt; Karan<br>This is an objective fact.</br></br>  <br>Did Crea ever show her vagina-bones? Yeah I thought not.</br>  <br>Crea was partially at fault of the Evol mess. Why did she wait until the last episode to confront Fudo? As soon as Mykage entered the scene she should have told Fudo to man up and face his ex and stop being a pussy.</br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>Kawamori thinks Fudo did nothing wrong. Just like Mikono, no one is allowed to criticize Fudo's actions.</br>    <br>So Kagura and Amata are in a homo relationship?</br>  <br>So Amagura is a thing now?</br>  <br><br>Mikono was such a shit girl they "fused" back again, if you catch my meaning.</br></br>  <br>So yeah as you can tell from the thread, there's no real consensus over whether evol or genesis is better or even what really went wrong with evol beyond agreeing it trainwrecked. <br><br>I would say the first half of evol is consistently better and more fun than Genesis. The second half Kawamori and Okada I think as well said in interviews they were trying to "challenge shallow love" which was a good idea in theory but the execution came off like trolling. Andy and Mix is about the only relationship that a lot of people seemed to like in the end. The animation and soundtrack are fantastic though, I'll give it that. <br><br>As it stands I think if you look at Evol as Kawamori fucking with anime cliches it's enjoyable, but if you get attached to any of the characters you'll end up unleashing rivers of butthurt like half the people in this thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Japanese are still mad over the dog thing.<br><br>And most people would agree the biggest problems in EVOL were Mikono being a terrible heroine, the pointless plot twists and the melodrama. EVOL as a show has too many flaws to count, but those are the ones people are mostly mad about.</br></br></br>  <br>Some more flaws: Amata was a terrible main character too. Kagura was pretty bad too. Zessica turned into a joke with her Amata obsession. Amata`'s parents story is a nonsense, why would anyone abandon a 6 years old kid. Shrade's death was ridiculous. Mikono and Cayenne never interacted, they are siblings for gods sake. Fudo is an asshole but he was never punished.</br>  <br> How is last season and Logos? <br><br>Since I am apparently the only person in the thread who watched Logos. I like it, the MC is refreshing boldly proclaiming he is "the saviour" that will save the world. It's still quite early but the Jungian/Gnostic stuff that's apparently at the core of the story is interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>Most of the flaws come from that the writers didn't plan ahead what they wanted to do with the show. They kept changing things on the go regardless of whether it was coherent with what they presented before. When you watch the second half it looks like none of the things that happened in the first were relevant at all.<br><br>For example, MIX and Zessica were supposed to be friends, but we never see them interacting much and MIX gives no fucks when Zessica goes into depression. Andy does the same to Amata in the second half where he kind of forgets he exists until MIX is in danger. Same goes for Jin and Kagura, which was dropped as early as the first episodes. The friendship relationships that were supposed to develop characters outside their love interests were completely forgotten.<br><br>Izumo being Amata's dad made no sense with what we saw of him in the first half, neither Alicia's explanation is coherent with Amata's flashbacks. The flashbacks of Alicia being eaten by the Aquarion were never explained too. The whole thing with Donar's girlfriend was forgotten, we never saw what happened to her. Kagura's whole character never made sense, and the show shamelessly reduced him to a plot device using Mykage to excuse him of everything. Not to mention that just like Amata, he has barely any character outside being a Mikono fanboy. The Aquarion going berserk over love confessions was also forgotten.<br><br>I mean, is not wrong if a writer changes their mind about what they want to do with a story, but holy shit not only the writers changed their mind over and over again about what they wanted to do, they also didn't cared about making it consistent with what they have been doing so far with the show, resulting in a mess of characters whose actions were completely detached from their motivations, a convoluted plot where we have no idea of what is supposed to happen and overall a bad story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been avoiding the threads until now, but I'm surprised that people hate Logos. The one real crime is that the show is missing missing an AKINO/bless4 insert song for the fights and the OP.<br><br>The current OP is fine; there is no Apollinious around to troll the cast with his bullshit; the cast and their interactions are fun to watch; and the MC and his autism are driving the show forward.</br></br></br>  <br>They also kept changing Cayenne's visions to whatever it was convenient. First it was Kagura and Mikono's wedding, then it was Kagura and Mikono's wedding besides the Aquarion, then it was Mykage marrying Mikono. I mean jesus fuck it was so obvious they were making shit up as they went it wasn't even funny.<br><br>Also it was pathetic Amata was always beaten by Kagura outside the Aquarion with no chance of fighting back. And all of his wings power ups were useless. Basically he always got saved when something interrupted them but never got to win by his own against him.</br></br></br>    <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>No black haired girl is best girl.</br>  <br>They really need Kana Ishida and Kurahana back.</br>  I had such low expectations for Aquarion Logos, but it just manages to keep getting better and better every episode.  not sure if autistic or alpha  <br>Holy shit why are they so ugly who the fuck thought this was a goo idea, I can't stop laughing</br>  <br>Well they're not mutually exclusive.</br>  <br> has no friends <br> muh savior complex <br>  that chuuni hand gesture  <br> shit talks a 9 years old little girl </br></br></br></br>  <br>The character designs can be initially jarring at first, but you get used to it fairly quickly.</br>  <br>Ditto, It really grew on me</br>  <br> shit talks a 9 years old little girl <br>She was threatening his savior duties, she had it coming.</br></br>  <br>Poor sylvia, but that's pretty funny Mikono ties with someone from a different show</br>  congratulations zessica  Why are little girls the best?  Just started watching Logos. There's something about the Chu2 MC that rubs me the wrong way.  <br>That's because he's  Apollonius .</br>  <br>Savior man will make her feel better after all these years, don't worry.</br>  <br>Apollonius will now fuck Zessica? Guy can't keep it in his pants!</br>  <br>Not  Pollon ?</br>  So much whining about Zessica losing and now that she got her own show and will probably get a better end nobody cares. Is kind of sad.  <br>I'm not a lolicon but something about her makes me want to commit a crime</br>  <br>  cats <br>guess who was cat too</br></br>  <br>Even if Maia is Zessica (I doubt it), they are completely different.</br>    <br><br>So is this literally going to be Sousei no Zessica: The Sequel: The NTRing?</br></br>  <br>Y-You shut u-up!</br>  <br> Yunoha was the most popular female character, remember? Followed by MIX and Zessica <br>Not quite. But I do remember Yunoha being the only character to be ranked outside the biglobe poll (in the June edition of Newtype) and was popular enough to grace the cover of the album cover with Jin and of course was the star in the OVA alongside Jin. At this oint she's pretty much the most popular character in the franchise.....which shows how very little people give a shit about it.</br></br>    Loved EVOL from episode 1. <br>  Detest Logos from the first second. <br><br>Jesus christ, no music, no good fights, no Fudou, shit setting, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, nobody gave a shit about Sousei aside from the OP song and pachinko games. EVOL had a fanbase but Jin died and people raged, plus the rest of the show ended up being terrible, so there's that.</br>    <br>  Wanting more Fudo after the dog shit </br>  <br><br> Zessica is cat <br>Truly best girl.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This image is infinitely funnier now that I know the It's Always Sunny reference.</br></br>  <br>More like Buddy Complex 2.</br>  <br> thinking silver hair isn't Mikono </br>  <br>I think you mean  Apollo </br>  <br>If anything she's Touma.</br>  <br>Get out, Kawamori.</br>   all this noise <br>Keep it down or Beargguy will steal your food and nom it!</br>  <br>She's not. Silver hair a shit while Mikono wasn't. Which means silver hair is Zessica.</br>  He's so damn upfront about things. I love it.<br><br>Also<br> the previous two seasons are anime in Logos </br></br></br>  <br>EVOL is good as long as you don't give a shit about the first Aquarion and aren't a shipperfag</br>  <br>I'm really hoping that Logos will be the Digimon Tamers of Aquarion.</br>  <br>I hope this has good side character like evol and genesis. And a not shit waifu like genesis, and better powers like gensis, and homo vibes like genesis.<br><br>Basically I hope this is like genesis with evolve secondary character added.</br></br></br>  Did Crea ever get a gattai scene?  <br>Punch her in the face? Steel her shit? Pimp her vector without asking?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>    <br>Anyone got a screenshot?</br>  <br>Nope. She got to be in Aquarion but she never got a gattai/orgasm scene.  is lying to you.</br>  Why do I find Logos so underwhelming?   making a little girl orgasm <br>Sasuga Saviour-kun. There's no end to his depravity.</br>  I don't understand why the designs suck so much for Logos, it's the same character designer for Outbreak Company and those girls look good. Here, only this girl looks cute throughout  Mark my words anons!<br>MC is New Apollonious (He acts like an autistic smart-ass just like Gen/Zen)<br>Not!Zessica is New Touma (Her featherish hairstyle is kind like Touma's and, well, she's fated to fall in love for MC/Apollonius)<br>Not!Mikono is New Celiane (I don't know why. I just want that bitch eat a taste of their own medicine. And I don't have any problem with Celiane herself but with her reincarnations Sirius and Mikono).</br></br></br>    <br><br>She did. Look for screenshots of last episode.</br></br>  <br> Her featherish hairstyle is kind like Touma's <br>I think it's just the art style that makes it look feather-ish. Other characters also have hair like that.</br></br>  <br>Oh she only got one in the director's cut. Never mind then.</br>  As far as I can tell, LOGOS is just Aquarion in name. No legends about 12000 years ago or anything. 2 man gattai. No angels, completely different mythos. In Gundam terms, this is an AU.<br><br>Also no Akino/Bless4 opening.</br></br>  Sousei was hilarious<br>EVOL was hilariously bad<br>Logos is just bad</br></br>  <br>All of them are bad to me.</br>  So judging from this thread, there's no point to watching this after EVOL  <br>Worst girl won.</br>  <br>No worst girl lost.</br>  Bad news, there is no japanese raws yet so we need to wait for tomorrow or when TF get her own copy of the chapter.<br><br>For now we have:<br> Instead of "D" we have "O" <br> Mero's mother dat MILF <br> Darling is the top chef <br> Rachnee best swimsuit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The current link seems to be fine, too.</br>  <br><br> do their bites provide us spider powers? <br><br>Only if we irradiate them first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My god</br>  <br>I like how they showed the 3 step thong on the second episode.</br>  <br><br> I'm talking about the D on Miia's head. <br><br>They are meant to be an allusion to a pair of snake-eyes.<br><br>It's even more obvious when she wears a hat.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This shit is flopping hard  <br>Keep in mind that good stuff doesn't do really well in japan, mainly shit with overdone tropes.</br>  <br>You are the retard who says sales mean quality</br>  <br><br>I enjoy both and nisekoi do have better art, but one particular thing that possibly will make me lean on Jitsu wa, Relationship upgrade.<br><br>Nisekoi<br> 176 chapter no actual relationship upgrade <br>I doubt there will be a relationship upgrade even till chapter 300.<br><br>Jitsu wa <br>  chapter 86, confirmed dating.  <br>Now, if then this manga progress to 100+ chapter while retaining both humor and relationship status, this will be the manga i've been waiting for.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> opinion I disagree with is bait <br> Using a F/SN bait image. <br>I don't know why I expected more from Jitsu wa fans but this is plain embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh look trope overdosed shit.</br>  Watching second episode of 3rd season right now. I never thought I'd say this, but Souma is actually a true bro. I didn't have any disliking towards him in previous seasons, but I always thought he was a weird character. But now he's actually being an awesome dude.<br><br>btw, third season plot about the staff relatonship is promissing so far. I'm fucking hyped</br></br>  Jesus, now this is just turning into a blog.<br>See you in a week when we get a new episode and something to discuss.</br>  <br>Sorry</br>  <br>That's why Japanese love ntr so much. Of course. It was all there all along</br>  <br>I could write a book about my drug expieriences. But this episode of Working though. It was really good. Pure enjoyment through and through.</br>  <br> You bought drugs online? <br> You're a faggot. <br>Seriously getting sick of stupid people like you. If you have so many friends and do so many things outside then you shouldn't even be watching anime let alone be allowed to browse /a/ because you just dont belong here. I know you won't leave but people like you are what bring this board way down because you just can't relate and we can't function together as a board because we always just fight over "ohh ur a normie, blah blah" It just doesnt work and this board was practically built on losers who would be the type of people to Order drugs online which is why you have to be the odd one out. Sorry but you really just don't help contribute to the board with who you are.</br></br></br>  List of shit that needs to be purged from the board but the mods are too much of pussy fags to actually do it:<br><br>Jojo generals<br>HxH generals<br>One Piece generals<br>Yuru Yuri generals<br>Yuyushiki generals<br>GuP generals<br>Love Live generals<br>Madoka tripfag circlejerks<br>Hibike generals<br>Yahari generals<br>Kantai Collection generals<br>Fujoshit circlejerks<br>Miuna Monday<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128330827#p128330827">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Interesting, I haven't been coming on /a/ much lately because of how shitty it is but when I do Hidamari Threads are normally nice.</br>  <br> doesn't include whining threads about generals <br><br>Look in the mirror OP. You are the cancer.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who uses this logic when it comes to generals being allowed is a massive retard.</br>  <br> shitposts on anime board  <br> demands that shitposting be purged from said anime board <br><br><br>Did babby get lost on his way to /b/?</br></br></br></br></br>  Didn't see a thread.  <br>This is best pair.</br>  <br>When the anime hadn't started aired the waifuwars and husbandolust were at the same level. I miss those threads.</br>  best girl is knaifu  <br>she is a bitch. luckily she also has the capacity for change. it's very hopeful. you will see. keep watching/reading. go erina.</br>  <br><br>yes they have some of the sexiest bodies ive seen in a while. not weirdly drawn either.</br></br></blockquote>]
