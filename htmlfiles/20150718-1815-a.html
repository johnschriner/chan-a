[ Did you like the new opening and ending songs?  No and no  The first ending was great, it managed to get me hyped for the next episode every time. This one is just "fine"  ED visulas were saved thanks to based Nao.  Its decent but I loved the old ED especially the ending of it.  Opening is better but ending song is alright.  SHIT they changed the OP and ED?<br><br>I accidently conditioned myself to eat a specific meal while watching this show. <br><br>I freak out if i dont watch the Op while eating.</br></br></br></br>  The OP is really good<br>Especially the part where Megumi orgasms while tomatoes are raining</br>  I feel the new OP fits really well for all the stuff that's going to happen soon.  Not nearly as much as the previous OP/ED. Good episode though, I'm hyped as shit for next one  <br> being this autistic </br>  <br>Didn't like the songs for either, but liked the visuals of the new ED.</br>   They replaced the glorious first opening with this shit. <br>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.</br>  They're really good. The last ED was overrated as hell, the only good part of it was the changing faces every episode.  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  I've never watched the entire OP for this show  <br> First opening <br> Glorious <br>It was shit</br></br></br>  I don't understand how anyone could possible prefer the first OP over this one.  Spot the  otp   Full color chapter is out.<br>http://imgur.com/a/8jmzj<br>Shit scans never.</br></br>  <br>If the characters in the ladle indeed change, I figure Isami will be visible then and these guys will be turned around.</br>    <br>All I can see is Hisako's butt and that slutty look on her face like she desperately wants some cock.</br>  I like the new OP, it's kinda spoily for Animeonlyfags tho.    <br>why the fuck is meat in there<br>that makes me mad as fuck</br></br>  <br>Souma's dad beat you to it.</br>  <br>This.<br>Ibusaki and Marui got even a higher score than her.</br></br>  Souma reaching top 5 and Erina moving to the polar star when?  I want Kanon to appear in the festival.<br>A maid cafe would be good too.</br>  <br>she's the love interest</br>  <br>Both OP are ok, but the first one is glorious and for comparision this one is shit.</br>  <br> I want Kanon to appear in the festival. <br><br> Kanon visits Soma's booth <br> Soma and Megumi offer her their food <br> she's all happy seeing them again and eating their food <br> Soma sees Erina passing by <br> "Oi, Nakiri!" <br> Erina and Kanon respond   "Nani?" <br> everyon'es face when </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the irrelevant one.</br>   There are people that don't pick Yuki   <br>They literally could not have picked a worse ending song. I didn't think i'd be able to hate vocals that bad in an OP/ED song since fear and loathing in Las Vegas</br>  <br><br> no more fuwa fuwa <br><br>Fucking dropped</br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck that voice on whoever sings the ED, what the fuck she sounds pretty annoying  It's the nasally vocals that put people off from the new OP, right? You guys probably don't like Nano Ripe, either.<br><br>I can see why it's a bit of an acquired taste, but I like it.</br></br>  <br>It's better than the last OP, not that that means much</br>  I TOLD YOU ALL<br>I TOLD YOU ERINA AND SOMA ARE SIBLINGS<br>YOU DIDN'T LISTEN</br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags </br>  <br>is anime your autism medicine</br>  <br>animeonlyfags, everybody</br>  <br>They aren't.</br>  <br>are you fucking retarded</br>  <br>ED's not that bad, but the OP is tragic.</br>  <br> Erina <br> living in some dorm like a commoner <br><br>I'd like to see grandpa slap the shit out of her with an eviction to Polar Star</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has her own money. Has a job that pays extremely well. Has connections and high level of business acumen.<br><br>In short order she would buy, remodel, and stock the polar star dorm with servants without even needing her family's money.</br></br></br>  オオオオオオ lives on.  Did they add a lot of anime only scenes or was it just me  Does the new OP mean were going to end at the end of the Autumn Election? Looks like it from the moon. <br>Either way, I'm fucking hype.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3i_<wbr>0j4vFnUk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I dig the ED. You just have to listen to it a few more times.</br></br>  <br>No, we'll get only the preliminaries. Gigga Nigga wasn't even in the OP.</br>  Casanova is out.  <br>Finally.</br>  <br>http://casanovascans.com/read/shoku<wbr>geki_no_soma/en/0/127/page/1<br><br>wow how come so fast compared to last week?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Because Jump came out early this week for some reason.</br>  <br><br>Was wondering how they would have pulled off like 50chapters, but alright, I'm down. I want the Election to be thoroughly adapted, so let's hope for S2.</br></br>   surstroming  <br><br>jesus christ</br></br>   he does it for free   <br>These lyrics are fucking weird.</br>  <br>The Alice trio scene was great.<br><br>Also, Nao a cute.</br></br></br>  So Ryou with his flattering is like a bad influence for Alice.  What Souma is planning? God damn it, I really want to know. <br>I can't wait for the next chapter.</br>  <br>I just like how he's basically saying "hey, you don't have to mean it, just do it".</br>  why doesn't casanova just put the translations in the full color pages  <br>We still need to know whom he gave a key to and why, along with what's happened with Eizan and Rindou.</br>  <br>Because it's far harder to clean.</br>  <br>It's hell to redraw color pages.</br>  They were both shit. The ending specially so.  <br>I don't know much about that process but I figure redraws are harder?</br>  <br>Yeah. The first OP is one of the worst I ever seen (sound wise)</br>  <br>Hand was mysterious girl from chapter 117.</br>  <br>Probably a man's hand. It was the same size as Souma's and notably larger than Megumi's on the same page.</br>  <br>how do you tell</br>  <br>She was the only background character that wasn't full colored in the color chapter. Same with Yugi and Nene.</br>  So is Souma gonna be able to marry Erina knowing that everytime they fuck, she's gonna be thinking of his dad?  So they skipped the introduction of the AE which means half of the dialogue is going to be original. Gonna be wierd.  I like this OP more. Builds anticipation for the tournament really nicely.<br><br>The ED is okay I guess, but it's no Fura Fura~ and it will take some time for me to stop missing that ED. <br><br>I do like that they featured stalker-chan in it though.</br></br></br></br>   tfw jc staff are doing 2 other shows this season   <br>His goal has always been to beat his old man. On every front.</br>  <br>What if the punishment includes grandpa using HIS connections to get her temporarily blacklisted by her usual clients?</br>  <br>The loli master strikes again</br>  <br><br>Thank you, someone else who can see her charm. It's the same charm as Tomoko, but useful.</br></br>  I only liked the old OP when Soma was singing it drunk.  Hinako and Donato a best.  This series has provided the most lighthearted enjoyment out of any series from at least the last 5 years, if not the last 10.<br><br>It's great, relaxing, interesting, and fun to watch. I love it.</br></br>  I see we got scans of the recipe book's SS today, I'll get started on them right away.  <br>Yeah there's few shows I don't procrastinate on anymore, but even after catching up on the manga I still look forward to new episodes of this.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  I like the new OP and how it shows everyone's dishes (I'm sure Ryo's will also be revealed later). The ED is sexy but nowhere near as fun as fura fura. Also, /u/ overload.  <br>I want to make Souma a little half-sister.</br>  Neither songs for OP or ED feel particularly good.<br><br>Visually the OP is pretty nice but I feel like there is too much emphasis on Hayama being the top rival.</br></br>  <br>I think that might only seem the case for mangafags. <br><br>Should ask animefags the impression they got from it.</br></br></br>  <br> Same with Yugi and Nene. <br><br>Maybe that was a rejected design for Rindou.</br></br></br>  How did Ryou get from<br> talk shit after you have more wins against me <br> as usual, your cooking is too pretty but lacking taste <br> you lost because you're too casual <br>to<br> hey currybro, you gotta compliment her first  <br>? <br>And all the first three was said by unbandanaed Ryo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not seeing how that's incompatible.<br>They're competitive, but live together and have to work together, so he learns to grease her wheels when he needs to, so to speak.</br></br>  <br>We know that he is quite competitive so it's no surprise for him to trash-talk in the situation he was in. On the other hand he is quite docile when in butler mode.</br>  <br>He realized the reason his father's recipe loses to Yugi's is because the guy deliberately made it milder since they run a special of the day restaurant. <br><br>Hence there is a way to "complete" the recipe for full spice.</br></br></br>  How do we go from this  <br>to THIS?</br>  <br><br>I don't know but I'm not complaining, that shit was hilarious.</br></br>  <br>I really liked this scene, J.C. Staff did a good job.</br>  I really like how Souma can get along with just about everybody.<br><br>The thought never came to mind about these two meeting but their interactions are pretty funny and has great potential.</br></br>  <br>wait, is the new issue translated? I just caught up and dont remember reading this</br>  <br/>  <br> not yukihihihihihihihihira </br>  <br>thank you friend</br>  <br>I wish she smiled more.</br>  <br>So the bandannas do nothing?</br>  <br>They lower the salt content of the dishes.</br>  <br>It's just his full gear.</br>  <br>looking fey there, Donato</br>  Would you cut your vegetables on this chopping board?  seriously, I thought by this far in Souma would have already made the elite 10. I suppose its more interesting to have him struggle some, but how long can they keep it going?  <br>He'll probably get in in his second year.</br>  <br>the first year will end soon, the top 5 E10 will graduate and there will be 5 spots open.<br>being top 3 Souma will get into E10 easily.</br></br>  <br>What if skill is not the prime requirement and instead it is influence? You win Shokugekis, increase your resources and then when you have the pull, you get into the E10?</br>  I'm really hoping they have a new ED every week focusing on another character/relationship from the Elections. <br><br> Hayama's Oedipus complex <br> Alice/Ryou childhood Shokugekis <br> Takumi/Meat 'Tsundere off' <br> Giganigga    version of Spice where he replaces every character  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then he will also get into the E10 easily.</br>  <br> I thought by this far in Souma would have already made the elite 10. <br>why? You did notice that except for the freak of nature that is Erina, that they are all upperclassmen right?</br></br>  <br> new ED every week <br>That's a tall order, bub.<br>Do you want a full new themed song every week, too?</br></br></br>  <br>well one of the purpose of the the autumn election is to rank the first year students.<br>but there will surely be an arc about selecting the new E10, there will only be speculations until then.</br></br>  <br>Bleach did that shit for all 13 divisions back in season two or something.<br>It is rare but we can always have hope.</br></br>  <br> Takumi with some slut he just talked like two times. <br> Not his fucking brother. <br><br>Anon pls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the first year will end soon <br><br>Not really, the training camp was just some weeks after the start of the school year, the Autumn election was almost immediately after that and now we're in the Moon Banquet, the last event of said Autumn.<br>Sometimes I wonder if the series is even going to cover the second year.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it has only been about 6 months then? <br>I am retarded.</br></br>  We don't know how the rankings are done. Is it all through Shokugekis for position? Then the higher ranked would never have a reason to accept a challenge with a lower rank unless the lower rank gambled something so risky that getting a higher rank wouldn't be worth it. It would still happen that way, but it would be less frequent, and losing would cost your seat at least.<br><br>It's probably ranked primarily off regular events like the election.</br></br>  <br>Should be early november, since that's when these festivals take place. The leaf viewing a few weeks back in Oct.<br><br>School year wraps up in early March with 3rd years graduating. Before then, there's also winter break for a couple of weeks.<br><br>There's around 4 months left for the school year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also SHAFT just did it for Nisekoi.</br></br>  <br>DEEP LORE</br>  <br>How? He doesn't really have much to offer. Sure, he's beaten a lot of people in Shokugekis, but all he took was knowledge. For groups willing to give their assistance, all I can think of is the Don RS and the Polar Star Dorm. Compare the current E10 that we know of.<br><br>Isshiki has a company and is more or less the defacto student for the Polar Star Dorm. Eizan has ihs businesses and his groupies and Kuga has won enough Shokugekis to become in charge of one of the biggest RS in the academy. Then you have Erina with all fo her own personal cooking facilities and her money from God Tongue.</br></br></br>  <br> Not putting the tsundere's together <br><br>No anon, you pls.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I'm all aboard putting two tsunderes together!</br></br>  <br>He gains reputation, which seems like a pretty good kind of currency to have in Tootsuki since everyone worth a shit is out for glory and recognition. Then he can get challenges just for having a good record and get stuff that way. I'm sure you're not absolutely REQUIRED to have an outside business going or something of the sort to be in the elite 10.</br>  <br> Since Takumi is aware of girls I wonder what is the type he likes </br>  <br><br>That's better than I could've imagined myself, it's things like this that justify watching the anime adaptation.</br></br>  Did Alice change her mind because of what Ryou said (she became aware of his consideration for her all this time) or what Hayama said (finally someone tells it to her like it is)? The big panel of her serious expression before Ryou starts speaking seem to indicate the latter.  <br>Pretty sure it was because of Hayama.</br>  <br>I just didnt think they would put so many challenges between him and the goal, since early on he seems so gifted I was surprised when they introduced so many people in the frist years besides Erina who could challenge him. I thought he would quickly reach her level.</br>  <br>I can see it happening, especially when she's rich and enrolled in a class handled by a 7th seat</br>  <br>She's not stupid.</br>  <br>Anyone who his nii-chan approves probably.</br>   Tadokoro, I'm sorry, but we might be sleeping a bit less from today on. <br>L-lewd.</br>  <br>So will she also be in the elite 10 or will she use her newly discovered skills to follow him around like an assistant?</br>  <br> since early on he seems so gifted <br>We already know that's not the case. It's gonna cost him some blood to reach the top.</br></br>  <br>yeah we knew that later on when his dad explained it, we didnt know it if the first few chapters</br>  <br>I like to think it was because of both.</br>  So with J.C Staff skipping the Karrage arc in the anime entirely, how will they show Soma's conflict with Eizen?  <br><br>Am I seeing a potential new ship?</br></br>  <br> mangapanda </br>  <br>Probably will get OVA'd</br>  <br> inb4 Gigganigga doesn't exists, they replace him with Nikumi. </br>  <br>I just want to know how the ending of the anime will ruin everything</br>  <br>I will fucking laugh if Hayama wins the Alicebowl.</br>  is next chapter going to be the final day of the moon festival? I remember reading it would last only 3 days, but I might be wrong  <br>Maybe, but then what hope is there for a second season if they're skipping manga content? <br><br>Episode 15 ends at Chapter 41. With 127 chapters out as of today, there's more than enough for 3 seasons already (If it were to ever get more than 1)</br></br></br>  <br>5 days.</br>  <br>I think that is the problem with the current 12-24 season set up. They have to chop the series up in a way that doesn't always work. anime original ending usually suck too</br>  <br>Hayama. Mind you it's not like what he's saying would be new to her, but rather it's reminding her that she's been doing all of this for the wrong reasons.<br><br>After all, Alice wasn't even planning to take part in the festival in the first place. Which is why she ended up having to talk her way into Hayama's booth. She just decided to do so on a whim because "Yukihira was getting all the attention" with his challenge against Kuga. Even in this chapter, we can see that she was trying to craft a dish to make a splash, rather than one that made financial sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he'll use Pacific Saury, like they did in the final.<br>Or he'll use some ideas from Ryou and Hayama from their last dish in the election.<br><br>Or it's the Mezzaluna used in some way.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hayama wins the Alicebowl. <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger the anime already explains that the head of the school is Erina's father so it isn't an animeonlyfaggot, he's just a fucking retard like you guys.</br></br>  <br>It'll happen anon, Kurokiba is just a beta orbiter white knight. She'll obviously choose the alpha black man who treats her like shit in the end.</br>  <br>Meant to say grandfather</br>  <br> calling them fucking retards <br> he thinks that Senzaemon is Erina's father </br></br>  <br>/r9k/ pls go</br>  <br> the anime already explains that the head of the school is Erina's father <br><br>no anon, you are the retard</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Kurokiba can get with  Hisako </br>  but who was mum?  <br> dirtying Hisako with curry <br>Disgusting faggot.</br></br>  Why does the anime make me like Yoshinon and Ryoko so much more than when I read the manga?  <br>I say Kurokiba faggot.</br>  SA<br>CHAN<br>SEKSHY CURRYYYYYYYYYYYY</br></br>  <br>But he already tried going all out with spiciness in his experiments.</br>  <br>My apologies<br> dirtying Hisako with a disgusting Scandinavian ricenigger </br></br>  Reminder Megumi and the other two girls from polar will crave for Souma's dick at the end of the series  <br>Ryoko x Smoke is pretty much canon</br>  Feels like NTR almost.  <br><br>I already corrected myself here  faggots.</br></br>  <br>Is Megumi not thinking lewd thoughts?</br>  Holy fuck how many seasons will the anime need to catch up to the manga?  <br>3</br>  <br><br><br>Honestly, this is one of the best adaptations I have ever seen. I love it entirely. Stuff like this is amazing.</br></br></br>  <br> 3 <br><br>Fuck, I wonder how long that'll take to finish</br></br></br>  <br>Around 3. <br><br>Episode 15 ended with Chapter 41.</br></br></br>  <br>they could do it in 2 if they really butchered it</br>  <br>The anime is doing a better job fleshing them out earlier and keeping them involved/relevant</br>  <br>a certain website told me its full of alot of fanservice which really takes away from it</br>  <br>They already butchered it by skipping out on an arc.<br><br><br> Full of fanservice <br>Have you not even read the fucking manga?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which arc was that? The one where soma goes back to his restrurant for summer? Or is that following up?</br>  <br><br>the early chapters were full of fanservice that brought everyone into it.

The anime adaption has literally cut out Chapters 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 and meshed Episode 15 together by adapting Chapters 34 and 41.<br><br>I can understand why it was cut because it's just showing what Soma and Nakiri got up to during their summer holiday. The problem is it introduces Eizan where he plans to crush Soma later down the line. <br><br>The question is, why bother skipping an arc when;<br><br>a). There's more than enough manga material to create at least 3, 2-cour seasons.<br><br>b). There was only 10 episodes left after episode 14 which wouldn't even cover all the preliminary's of the Autumn Election meaning it would of been left on a cliffhanger ending anyway.<br><br>An anime-only opening is literally possible at this point, which I don't think anyone wants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Souma: Either’s fine, she said. // I guess I look good in a jacket OR blazer! <br><br>That selective hearing.</br></br></br>  <br>They might just be moving it.

Also many thanks to the anon who either scanned or found it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you haven't noticed, Souma has a big ego</br>  <br>I have the feeling they're gonna butcher the elections quite hard. No preliminary round, no Giga Nigga, matches out of camera and such.</br>  The only way to redeem the new OP is the episode after Giganigga is revealed(or his mimicry) they also reveal that the meat in the OP was him all along.  <br> An anime-only opening is literally possible at this point, which I don't think anyone wants <br><br>Let's hope this anon's cousin <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127207137  wasn't trolling.</br></br></br>  <br>The new OP is fine<br>That ED on the other hand...</br></br>  OP 2 &gt; OP 1<br>ED1 &gt; ED2</br>  <br><br>what I meant to say is that I don't think they'll omit the arc entirely. They'll just move the karaage arc right after jouichiro's arc, around the end of chapter 46 (the short break before the election)</br></br>  <br>I just can't look at meat in the top 9. It disgusts me.</br>  <br>The new Opening does the manga justice. <br><br>The manga had that serious tension during the Autumn Election arc and it was pretty cool to see it animated in the opening. <br><br><br>The new opening hinted at Soma vs Kurokiba vs Hayama with the moon visible in the stadium so Giganiga must be in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  You have 10 seconds to justify your love for tsunderes and to prove that that aren't the shittiest, most annoying, most overused archetype of characters in anime.<br><br>Protip: YOU FUCKING CAN'T.</br></br>  I like what I like<br>Do you seek justification for why you like french fries? No, they just taste good.</br>  2 words<br> best   girl </br>  <br> not liking the greatest tsundere of all time </br>  <br>Misora a shit. A SHIT.</br>  dimensional, multi-faceted characters  Not that tsundere is my one and only love, but things are interesting if they have a rocky start as opposed to going perfectly. This is why tsundere is a standout archetype among others.  <br>Are there any tsunderes voiced by Sawashiro? If so, I might need to watch that anime for research purposes.</br>  <br> french fries <br>Enjoy your cholesterol and acne you fatfuck.</br></br>  <br>But asuka is love<br>Asuka is life</br></br>  <br>Asuka is an exception. She's one of the very few good tsunderes.</br>  Tsundere girls done well are amazing, the issue is that it's really easy to mess them up. Really easy.  <br>Enjoy your horribly boring life</br>  <br> having a healthy diet makes my life boring <br>Sasuga Amerifats.</br></br>  <br>Name 10 tsunderes done right.</br>  <br>Being so terrified of any food deemed "unhealthy" that you lash out at random people for thinking it tastes good is a pretty good indicator that you either 1. are fat yourself, or 2. have a really boring diet that you believe you must maintain to stay in shape (you don't)</br>  <br>Or maybe I just choose to eat healthy food and get plenty of exercise so that I don't become a fatass like you.</br>   implying tsunderes are not best girls   <br> Hana <br> tsundere  <br>You retarded m8?</br></br></br>    <br>1</br>  <br>Crab isn't a tsundere. She's a kuudere.</br>      <br>Isn't she?<br> it's not like I'm exchanging urine with you because I like you or anything, it's for revenge, I swear! </br></br>  <br> Tsunderes are shit! I-it's not like I secretly love them or anything. B-baka! </br>  <br>1</br>  <br>Then Kurisu because she's also a genius with some awkwardness.</br>  implying u wouldnt a louise  I like tsunderes which are dishonest to their feelings and slowly warm up with the guy they like.<br><br>However, violent aggressive bitches like Taiga are shit and ruining the tsundere archtype. Fuck those kind of girls and everyone who loves them.</br></br>  <br>Too complex of a character to be classified as something as tsundere stereotype. She's more distrubed than just dishonest about her feelings like typical tsuns. I sense that her inevitable flashback will have some fucked up shit going on.</br>  <br>Tsundere is the most adorable archetype and consists of characters that almost universally care more about the subject of their affection than any other archetype. Also Taiga is only a partial example of a tsundere considering her behavior at various points towards Kitamura and Ryuuji.<br><br>Took over 10 seconds if you count me Googling Kitamura's name to make sure I got it right.</br></br></br>  There are quite a few that are shitty<br>most of them are quite annoying <br>and the archetype is overused as fuck (though not most overused, lot of other archetypes were ran deeper into the ground). <br><br>But there are some tsun worth the dere</br></br></br></br>  Is Taiga even tsundere. I mean, she's not violent because she's ashamed of her feelings towards MC, she's just a vile bitch in general towards everyone.  <br>that's a kuudere<br><br><br>that's just a shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm relatively new to this specific type of classification of personality types (but I'm educated in psychology).<br>Anyone have an image explaining the Japanese archetypes or something?</br></br>  <br>basically <br><br>a kuudere is a COOLdere</br></br></br>  <br> Anyone have an image explaining the Japanese archetypes <br><br>Yeah, google has.<br><br>Now fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Fuck you.<br>The information I got there was conflicting, and there's a lack of consistency of structure here, as shown in .</br></br>  <br>why is Rin a shit tsundere again<br><br>I mean her first act was reviving the MC</br></br></br>  <br>Improve your research and analysis skills, buddy.</br>  <br> try to skip the heavy analysis part by asking if there's something relatively more definitive on /a/ <br> Anon: I'm going to post without saying anything useful. </br></br>  <br>Not him.<br><br>The only one who not only didn't post anything useful, but also demanded things is you.<br><br>Fuck off already.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you get fat from french fries you just have an issue</br>  <br> demand <br> implying <br><br>I tried to contribute to the discussion, then decided that I required more substantial information to do so.<br>I then asked for something on /a/, so that I may acquire the knowledge, and use it to contribute to the thread.<br><br>You fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Follow the instructions in pic related and you will learn all the archetypes, don't listen to these faggots telling you to "use your brain" or "look it up on google" or "fucking lurk more you piece of shit."</br>  <br>they make my dick hard</br>  <br>That exact explanation you just gave would apply equally well if you were asking us to tell you what this "anime" thing was and what some good shows to start off with were, but you'd still get told to fuck off.</br>  <br>Fun Fact: Modern Helium tanks in developed nations contain oxygen so people can't kill themselves, faggot.<br>I'm not the one here posting about French fries, and I'm using my brain to be more efficient, while you guys are being faggots.</br></br>  <br> Modern Helium tanks in developed nations contain oxygen so people can't kill themselves <br>How do you know?<br><br>Did you test it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, fine, here's an updated character archetype list.</br>    I appreciate people who are emotionally guarded to the point of being callous or cold with other people.<br>It's a special feeling to be able to get past a person's defenses and gain their trust.</br>  <br>This. <br>It's a reward to watch it happen.</br></br>  <br>Whoever made this has WAY too much time on his hands and places WAY too little value on human life. Sounds like your typical rich person.</br>  <br>Let me get this straight. You choose to spend your free time talking to a bunch of people who call you a faggot and tell you to kill yourself near-constantly but somehow still also choose to spend their free time talking to you, but you claim you don't like tsundere?</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YgH<wbr>NtzxO0y8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Gap.</br>  <br><br> THK thread <br>I don't even have to wonder how the rest of the thread turned out.</br></br></br>  <br>I use it whenever I expect that I might have to answer a reply.

Many people comment on coming for the fetish and staying for the story. The battle system is sort of fun.

It has a whole slew of artists working on it, some doing more traditional monster girls, some doing unspeakable abominations better not shown in here, and some that are basically just draw animals with a naked female torso with a head slapped on top of it. The good monster girls make the bad ones endurable, for the most part.<br><br>As for the plot, it's pretty good for an H-game at the very least. The protagonist is more beta than Shinji, though. Thank god he's way more Alpha in Paradox.</br></br></br>  <br> Likewise, Luz and Polt shouldn't have had to have been Furries. <br><br>To be fair, Luz is a shapeshifter and Polt is a Kobold, we've seen dog girls and wolf girls in the universe and they're clearly Kenomimi's.</br></br></br>  <br>It became a blogging front though <br>so apples and oranges <br>KS was good though</br></br></br>  <br> Centaur <br> liking horse pussy <br><br><br>The correct order is<br>zombie &gt; slime &gt; shapeshifter &gt; ms smith &gt; polt &gt; anyone else (make it up, i don't really care about the others that much) &gt; centaur</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the only eroge I actually flapped to</br>  <br>A Suu body pillow could be revolutionary if a great mind would work on it.</br>  <br> Cerea last.  <br>Anon, fite me.</br></br>  <br>How can one person have so much shit taste?</br>  <br><br>Yeah, all of them are worse than Snek.</br></br>  <br><br>The evil in men's hearts.</br></br>   Monster Musume airs <br> Suddenly a VN featuring a cyclops girls pops up and gets interest despite noone gave a fuck before. </br>  <br>I understand not liking horse pussy<br>but why the hell are all your top picks so close to the regular human sex experience?<br>Do you not want Miia to coil around you and fuck for 8 hours without stopping?<br>She won't get tired you know, snake muscles are strong, she will keep milking you dry.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a joke, right?

It hurts to read this.</br>  <br>I'm beginning to think the Miia dakimakura is a joke, Anon.

Fucking a centaur would be literally fucking a horse. At least the other girls have human like genitals. You wouldn't even be able to play with a centaur's human parts when you're porking her because you wouldn't be able to reach.

It's time to get swole anon.<br>Time to bust down that snake pussy and bend her in half like the filthy snake whore she is.</br></br>  <br>HAHAHAHAHA i want this shit</br>  An Ogre body pillow would actually be a mattress.  <br> Not taking yoga classes with your centaur waifu. <br> Not meeting Dhalsim and learning the secrets of limb-stretching. <br>No anon, the shit tier is you.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Imagine having both and sleeping between them. </br></br>  I wish you guys would stop waifu bashing and just enjoy the show.

With how the girls are designed it will horribly stand out if they cheap out on shit.</br>  Daily reminder that if Lamias determine you to be a worthy male, they abscond with you to their village where you are repeatedly made love to by a harem of beautiful, loving, passionate snake-women and kept as an adored communal concubine in an opulent desert palace.<br><br>If Centaurs determine you to be a worthy male, you get the privilege of literally sharing the bed with the woman you love, as she is railed by her brutish husband while you watch. If you are LUCKY, the two of you get to have your own affair where you cuckold an innocent Centaur man and get to live a secret relationship based on adultery and shame. Oh, and what sex you do get is Horse Pussy sex.</br></br>  <br> If you are LUCKY, the two of you get to have your own affair where you cuckold an innocent Centaur man <br><br>More like ALL THE TIME.

I haven't seen the personalitys much yet though, which is where it really counts.</br></br></br></br></br>  So is hobidas the only place you will be able to order these goods or will we be able to do order from other sites?  <br>Isn't this the one from where that weird guy that "bought" rachnee and went to darling's house to film them in their natural daily lives?</br>  <br> &gt;Implying that in Centaur society "Teaser" human males are not bought to secret orgies by high-class Centaur women every night. </br>  <br>They're too high-class for that. They just engage in marathon sex with their favorite teaser, pausing only to put their husbands back to sleep.<br><br>I got to thinking about Cerea though. That bra video, as well as other evidence, suggests she's only 103I when she exhales. Her mother is a "mere" 110J(K?). Would that mean Cerea is already as big as her mom, and could in fact, get even bigger after pregnancy?</br></br></br>  <br> allies <br>allies? you fuckers took over CoC, why would I consider you allies?</br></br>  <br> &gt;Implying that you don't in anyway want the gratification of seeing the Centaur Mare who hired you as a teaser fall in love with you to the point where she divorces her "alpha" horse-dicked husband. <br> &gt;Knowing that she chose you out of love and appreciation for your deeper human qualities. </br></br>  <br>Nah, some weird special they're doing with the series. Kinda like the mundane parts of their lives.<br><br> Kinda wanna see the director chapter animated just to see his face get fucking blasted </br></br></br>  <br>I can't cuck Goku,<br>I don't think I would want a Centaur waifu.</br></br>   some guy runs up to your monster daughter <br> whispers in her ear <br>Baba Booey.<br>and runs away<br>How do you react?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't Arachne make bras for all her well endowed compatriots?<br>She can literally shit out enough cute bras for them.</br></br>  <br>maybey they degrade eaily</br>  <br>You are a fucking genius! Crabman, if you are reading this, DO IT!</br>  Did the whole slime thing in Japan (and elsewhere) start with Dragon Quest back in the day? Or was there something else before that?  <br>its Dragonquest <br>there is not mythology I can think of involving slimes</br></br>  <br><br> horse orgy <br><br>Holy shit, not only would it be awkward and probably dangerous due to the imminent possibility of being stepped-on or tripped-over, but it would probably smell like ass to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mero is like a maritime ero Eros of my "mer d'amour"</br>  <br>Why do they make lamias with human asses?

They must be really confident about the show´s success, or the manga itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What if they added actual furries?  <br>BURN IT</br>  <br>well now it does, because of you guys.</br>  <br>Then we send the third nuke over.</br>  <br>Do not want.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Look what two nukes did, what makes you think a third will solve anything?</br>  What if it were poorly drawn by a filthy gaijin?  <br>ive seen worse</br>  <br>Keep calling me furfag, maybe it'll motivate me to be one jackass. Contribute or shut up.<br><br><br>Not much would change. We allready have Polt and she's rather furry. Japan doesn't even have a furry fandom.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i can roll with this</br>  <br>I figured nukes worked on Flintstones-head-trauma logic, and the next one would knock them back into sense.</br>  <br>Oh god, no. Good thing that Polt appears so little time and Luz Ninetei is a one-chapter character</br>  Are the anime shorts compiled somewhere? Fuck  <br>That's not from the manga, that has to be fan shit.

If he doesn’t use any cheap tricks, then I could-…!!” <br><br> “Misaka.” <br><br> Touma's face when misaka still thinks she can win </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"What exactly were they supposed to do?”<br><br>“Honestly, you really are hopeless.”<br><br>Suddenly, he heard a male voice, or something like it, and he turned toward it. He found a sort of red paper airplane flying alongside the acrobike.<br><br>The spiky-haired boy initially put up his guard, thinking it was some kind of tracking device sent by the High Priest, but…<br><br>“Have you forgotten who I am? I am one of the four corners supporting the world and the member of God’s Right Seat corresponding to red and the right. That should be enough to tell you who I am.”<br><br>“Fiamma?” muttered Kamijou.<br><br><br>touma BTFO by the biggest asshole in the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Fiamma's back <br><br>my nigga</br></br>  <br>What is up with that AI? What did it send Hamazura?<br><br>Also, HP Best Troll.</br></br></br>  <br>Random shit so he and Fremea wouldn't get run over by the Acrobike chase from what I can understand</br>   “Misaka. If we do find an environment where we can fight without getting anyone else involved, do you really think we can beat that High Priest?” <br> “Of course! If he doesn’t use any cheap tricks, then I could-…!!” <br> “Misaka.” </br></br>  <br> even touma knows shes a completely useless shit in this situation </br>   Fiamma is back <br>I know he's just going to job, but still.</br>  <br>It's Fiamma, not Ollerus</br>  <br>Mikoto stronk.</br>  Seems like everything  will be all right .  <br>Mikoto a useless burden.</br>  “Misaka.”<br><br>He called her name again and she groaned behind him.<br><br>She then spoke as if confessing her guilt.<br><br>“I can’t know until I try. I will admit he isn’t someone I can optimistically say we have a 100% chance of beating.”<br><br>That was an admirable thing for someone so full of self-confidence to admit.<br><br>Kamijou made a suggestion as he pedaled.<br><br>“We can’t randomly attack him until we pull our odds up to 100%. As you’ve seen, his morals give no thought whatsoever to human life. He isn’t going to spare you just because you beg for your life.”<br><br>“I know that, but that brings us back to square one. How exactly are we supposed to have 100% odds of defeating that monster? Throw him in a garbage disposal plant’s incinerator? Run him through a print shop’s rotary press to crush him flat? Tear him to pieces with the giant lawnmowers used on American farms? I can picture him coming back from all of those with a smile on his face.”<br><br>“U-ugh. You sure can come up with some surprisingly gruesome ideas, Misaka.”<br><br>“D-don’t act so disturbed!! I only gave you those examples because you asked!! Mumble, mumble (Huh!? Was it a mistake to watch all those zombie movies yesterday!?)”<br><br> “I can’t know until I try. I will admit he isn’t someone I can optimistically say we have a 100% chance of beating.” <br> That was an admirable thing for someone so full of self-confidence to admit <br>Cute ad ever so full of confidence. That's my Misaka.<br> zombie movies <br>I never figured Misaka was into zombie genre.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fiamma <br>Our new red useless jobber. Touma and Mikoto being hopeless against High Priest is one thing, but Fiamma being useless in the end too? Only Touma can save us.</br></br>  testing  <br> Only ANTI-Touma* <br><br>I meant.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a gamer. Probably played arcade shooters with zombies in them.</br>  <br> I never figured Misaka was into zombie genre. <br>you're are probably too used to nagai mikoto who is always trying to be cute and buy frilly shit. Mikoto is a straight up tomboy in index and the only girl thing about her is the gekota love.</br></br>  <br>Eh, I see plenty of her tomboy side in the manga and Index Nagai's Mikoto does bother me since he downplays her ability and makes her suffer from CSI a bit.</br>  Reminder that the Aikawa girl gets raped after the thugs find out she just led them to a wild goose chase.  <br>Oh yeah, I sometimes forget that Mikoto is fond of playing arcade games too. She always have those coins.</br>  Holy shit Touma's support is useless, this was obviously not the time for her to have the spotlight and be the heroine when facing a magic god. She cant give relief to Touma, cant offer any ideas to help the situation. Misaka is still very ignorant even to magic itself so it must be hard to open up to her and explain everything properly. She is more concerned about riding a bike with a boy while her feeling are welling up inside and hardly notices how much Touma is suffering. Fuck man bring in Index or Othinus as support, hell even accel would be doing a better job at least Touma can explain to him whats happening. She is only giving Touma more problems than actually helping, it must be fukou da at work here to make him suffer as much as possible. Hopefully Misaka can make a comeback by the end of the novel and do something meaningful while having the spotlight this volume.  <br>  index will never be relevant again as support <br>This is probably one thing that she was actually good for,</br></br>  <br> Hopefully Misaka can make a comeback by the end of the novel and do something meaningful while having the spotlight this volume. <br>Top kek</br></br>  <br>I was actually wondering myself why Othinus never crossed his mind when he was wracking his brains trying to figure out how to beat a Magic God, there's literally no one better to ask</br>  <br>Getting to her would be too difficult at the time and chances are if he did HP would start doing things a bit more seriously. Not much else better to crush his spirits than harming the girl he fought the world to protect.</br>  <br>He already asked Othinus how to beat a Magic God during the whole St. Germaine stuff. She basically just said loldunno.</br>  <br>Litteraly Touma can go home, pick her up and stuff Othinus in his pocket while on the acrobike. Or it could have been an Index and Othinus team up to take down a magic god like in NT12. I am truly baffled that Misaka is the heroine of this volume. She better at least learn or even have little understanding of the concept of magic or this volume truly fails and would make me wonder what he wants to do with her character.<br><br><br>All of AC and the world are in danger from Touma's view point. When comparing a magic god to the strength of the world Touma thinks magic god will always win. Othinus is in danger either way at home or next to him.<br><br><br>Index and Othinus were both going to analyze and come up with a way to take down a magic god without negotiation. Dont know why kamachi wouldnt use that here in this situation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no rest for Touma.</br>  <br>Misaka wasn't useless in other battles in NT. This time the enemy is a Magic God, so it's not going to go well no matter. So why are you riding her hard so much? While outmatched in every way, I'd say she handled herself quite well against a monster like High Priest. She managed to saved those people in the buildings he threw at her, and that's something only she was able to do because of her ability.<br><br>We already know from spoilers that this volume basically lets Misaka see there's a gap between her to help Touma against Magic Gods. She realizes it and that obviously with open up sub-plots for her to develop and become stronger so she can be more useful to Touma. Theories of Nuit of awakened wings from last thread might just come true in future volumes.</br></br></br>  <br> Hopefully Misaka can make a comeback by the end of the novel and do something meaningful while having the spotlight this volume. <br>She doesn't.</br></br>  <br><br>That's half the point of this volume. By the end she gets that Touma's messes are way out of her league. Hopefully that will lead to her either improving herself so she can be useful or backing off next time.<br><br>Hopefully. I wouldn't be surprised if she just goes "Ima help him anyway!" and doesn't develop at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Theories of Nuit of awakened wings from last thread might just come true in future volumes. <br>Nuit is never going to come true, just move on.</br></br>   She's shit blah blah because she isn't able to deal with a Magic God <br><br>I guess you-know-who came early this time.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off there isn't any shitposting here.</br>  <br> She knows she's completely useless to Touma and that means she will get a power up soon! <br><br>Not like Mikotofags are any better.</br></br></br>  <br> replying to it </br>  Biri biri is giving me second hand embarrassment when reading her parts.  <br>We're actually having a civil discussion for once so fuck off.</br>  <br> can't discuss mikoto in anything but a positive light and must seek out a silver lining no matter the scenario <br>looks like you-know-who is here</br></br>  <br> Speculating typical plot and tropes is now a bad thing <br>You can't be serious.</br></br>  <br>How isn't that better than shitposting?</br>  <br>Where's the shitposting?</br>  <br>Because it's just delusions form faggots who seem to forget that Misaka cannot handle that much power.</br>  Every goddamn fucking time without fail.  <br>No one would turn away criticisms if they are valid. Senseless hate that tries to turn every angle into something negative and throw reasonably out the window can hardly be considered criticism, much less valid.</br>  <br> Thinking she can do anything <br><br>Is she still that much of a doofus?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Like fucking clockwork.</br></br>  <br> Senseless hate <br>Where?</br></br>  <br>In her defense, Touma still hasn't actually explained jack shit to her.<br>And against her, every time she's going to ask him about things, she goes tsundere and attacks him.</br></br>  <br> Senseless hate <br>I don't see any hate in this thread, fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much just people laughing at her current situation it isn't any worse than fiamma getting called a jobber and the new stiyl. you are over reacting.</br>  So ignoring the shitposters, how will things go after the magic gods either get doge'd or fisted? I'm honestly surprised that Touma hasn't tried to make a more organized group for dealing with all of the bullshit that pops up around him. If the Kamijou Faction finally gets officially formed, I'd really like to see how the different characters could work together to bring their strengths forward instead of being so spread out, but then that would also take out a lot of the challenge in many of the situations.<br>Also, since Touma has been getting a lot more brutal in his actions lately, how long until he is actually branded as a "villain"?</br>  <br>The "Hero" is already here so it's only a matter of a few volumes.</br>  <br>IT is funny how he keeps saying that is a magic god and asking her how she plans to stop a magic god without telling her what the hell a magic god is.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128195<wbr>732/#q128200494<br><br>Don't play dumb.<br><br><br>It doesn't have to be Nuit, idiot. Even if it was Nuit or some form of it, any plot development that goes down that road will make it work. Speculation of that form is way better than the shitposting "that" guy does.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>The plot will probably shift to Laura and England. Kamachi already said that.</br>  <br>I don't see any shitposting here besides you trying to start shit.</br>  <br>He's obviously asking where the shitposting is in this thread retard</br>  <br>Why are you bringing shit from another thread? The other post in here is a perfectly valid opinion/criticism/complaint/whateve<wbr>r.</wbr></br>  <br>Thelemic deities are going to be relevant eventually, its just a question of whether it comes up as a powerup or another crisis for Touma to solve.<br><br>Kamachi's science is a mess but hell if he doesn't do his homework on the occult. No way the obvious resemblance to Nuit was an accident.</br></br></br>  Purple is my way of life.  <br><br> Denying it <br>Oh right, of course you would.<br><br><br>And the second link is from this thread. The first link is him trying that shit again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma is fucking done when misaka thinks they can win.i</br>   Reacting to THK <br>Fail. We did a decent job at ignoring him last night, but so much for that.</br>  <br>That's not shitposting you retarded piece of shit. On any other thread that would be considered legitimate criticism but apparently to you it's just shitposting.</br>  <br><br>You faggots are just trying to derail and destroy another thread again.</br></br>  Bringing this from the the other thread in archive.moe<br><br> about High Priest being who had killed Aleister's daughter.<br> This is most likely true. There is no direct indication on what really happened, but hints are every where. High Priest's past was revealed during the interlude. He was a monk who was trying to attain Buddhahood to bring salvation onto humanity and make the world a better place. But after he completes all process to become a magic god, he was not recognized as a Buddha due to the political matter of the time. Thus, High Priest taken that as the world's answer to him, that the world wants to be saved by a monk who can't throw away his earthly desire and failed to achieve the enlightenment. Ever since, he has behaved as such, as he means to save this world. <br>Now, when Kihara Dog finished High Priest off, he said the following:<br>"This is a message from the ghost (Aleister)."<br>"Do you still remember? ...To make the world a better place, to save every single one of the humanity. The name of my daughter who has been trample over and her life taken away by such a childish gear of destiny."<br><br> And High Priest's last ward that couldn't reach Aleister is "I am sorry." <br><br> So yeah, even High Priest didn't personally killed Aleister's daughter, he is definitely related to her death. <br><br>In regards to Kihara Noukan's magic god killing power suit.<br> "Anti-Art Attachment, Set Up." <br>"7th School District Central, connection to Aleister has been confirmed."<br> Also, the process of Noukan annihilating the High Priest is being described as delivering Aleister's "power of will". <br>It is been hinted that Anti-Art Attachment is so broken because it is borrowing Aleister's power.<br> BTW, Aleister noticed something is wrong after he finds out all the magic gods are gone, when Noukan only killed off Zombie and High Priest. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br> Purple </br>  <br>Why are you spoiling shit on an LN thread where everyone has already read every volume?</br>  <br> Trying hard to shit on her because she can't beat a Magic God and say she's a bad heroine for this arc that the author intends for a reason just because she isn't as useful as Othinus or Index <br> Not subtle shitposting and implication "THK" has done many times before <br>Just go.</br></br></br>  <br><br>MAGIC GOD should give a hint.</br></br>  Cont.<br><br> About Neph<br> She use the term "exile" to describe World Rejector's power. She met up with Touma after her encounter with Kamisato. She asks Touma to side with her by telling that Othinus might be Kamisato's next target. Unlike High Priest, she is not that concerned about making Touma their arbiter and actually is pretty fond of the Academy city. </br> </br></br>  <br>Refer to<br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>Anon nobody gives a shit about spoiling here.</br></br>  <br>So Neph might be trolling or mistaken? Or completely right</br>  <br> Hints are everywhere <br> Aleister straight up accuses him <br>That's a hell of a hint</br></br></br>  Sadpanda thread, MILFs edition:<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/832302/7b24b2<wbr>822f/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/791606/be14ec<wbr>36f7/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/790909/e11cbd<wbr>baeb/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/782987/553e3b<wbr>0b08/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/565440/787d2c<wbr>0980/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/499658/02173a<wbr>0660/<br><br>also /r/ing some info.
