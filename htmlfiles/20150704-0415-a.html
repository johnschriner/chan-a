Remember when Gundam wasn't about glowing robot with wings but pseudo-realism?<br><br>Yeah, I don't either</br></br>  <br>It's very much wish fulfillment of the author, but it's also just gratifying to see modern military used against a Roman empire stand-in.</br>  Our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Yamato.  <br>It's a chinky stream, so it's probably not going to be shut down. This guy loves SEED though.</br>  Goddamn Nip an his mecha fetish.  <br><br>All those unlawable puns.</br></br>   Front page of CR has a livestream of their booth at AX <br><br>This fucking Mushi-uta cosplayer looks lost as fuck.</br></br>  <br><br> Mushi-Uta <br><br>Fuck, I meant Mushishi.

It's well known that the CIA has been responsible for the rise in fall of governments in South America and the Middle East for decades. Meanwhile despite their hypernationalism, the reality is that Japan's SDF is completely untested.<br><br>Again though this is during the Bush era, and the only special forces operations in recent memory are disasters like Black Hawk Down and the attempted hostage rescue in Iran.<br><br>Before the assassination of Bin Laden, the general public didn't really have a concrete idea of how thorough our special forces are in preparation.</br></br></br></br></br>  dat loli<br><br>pls dun die</br></br>  All that rape incoming  GOSH RORI?!?!

Anyone have the right one?  When will the raw come out ? I can't watch the stream at the moment, fuck.  What Itami's psychic?   seeing visions   HABBENING  AMERICA WOULD'VE STOPPED THEM ALREADY  god damn itami is hard core  <br>http://vaughnlive.tv/neetball</br>    FUCK I MISSED THE OP AND JUST TUNED IN.<br><br>Did this have op on first ep?</br></br>   Dragon Riders <br>WHAT</br>  top kek Japan  Anime original story turn confirmed: instead of opening portal into another world, now JDF is trapped into MMO. MC is Kirito  dammit stream, catch the fuck up   That pig roll <br><br>What the fuck?</br></br>    Lame, they're jumpcutting all the violence.  <br>Yes by kishida kyoudan</br>  Half of this shit didn't happen in the manga  <br>That was fantastic.</br>  Oh boy I'm ready for overkill.  FUCKING AIRSUPPORT BITCHES  Damn, that was a nice shot police officer  otaku prowess   That Hero police officer <br>o7 SALUT!</br>  Nippon Banzai    lag on OP stream is real   JSDF IS HARD-CORE!!!!!   damn nigga got straight up shanked  Itami just broke dat niggas nech haha  NIPPON BANZAI  <br>He's a soldier though</br>    TIME FOR WAR BITCHES   All this violence removed <br><br>Better be uncensored as fuck in the BDs.</br></br>  CALL THE RIOT POLICE   going NIPPON STRONK on way weaker army <br>That's kinda pathetic.</br>  Seems like the military is still fairly Roman, at least.  <br>That rape face.</br>  SONY WINS  All you had to do was follow the manga dammit   Bullet impacts <br> No blood <br>YES, BLESS THE CENSORSHIP</br></br>  PROMOTION  <br>Yeah, better wait till the invaders slaughter the civilians.</br>  The thing I miss the most from the manga is his catface.  Wasn't it just the riot police that beat the first wave or did I remember it wrong?   you only saved one person <br> YOU ARE NOW A MEMBER OF THE JSDF </br>  <br> Before the assassination of Bin Laden, the general public didn't really have a concrete idea of how thorough our special forces are in preparation. <br><br>The funny part of that being that they bagged Bin Laden essentially unopposed. Current best-supported version of events is that they were able to bribe the right people to essentially barge in, shoot every male adult before they could mount serious resistance, and sit around waiting for their ride without having to worry about the police or fire department showing up. Preparation, sure, but of a different kind.</br></br></br>    <br> I'm not gonna pay the damn NHK.  <br><br>Dude, you just tell them to fuck off.</br></br></br>  I'm sure CR will air it uncensored. They've done it before.  <br>he already was a member of the JSDF.</br>  ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN MANGA  <br>Are you retarded</br>   Air support arrives <br>My warboner has risen</br>  OH SHIT! Godzilla game.  that wasn't bad  <br><br> implying he doesn't go full catface when he meets Persia </br></br>    <br><br>He was already JSDF, he was just on leave that day.</br></br>  <br> Being a secondary </br>  <br>He's already a member. A special forces member to boot</br>  <br>No, the military actions are correct.<br>I mean the whole plot of this show.</br></br>  <br>He was just going to comiket. He was already a soldier.</br>  No hill battle first episode, I guess  <br>The source is LN though. It is worse than manga, but Gate is shit regardless so who cares. Just shut your brain off and enjoy the ride.</br>  <br>That was their old-school MO when the westernization first began.<br> Nippon can only win against a foe that has absolutely no chance against them <br> With borrowed equipment from the West </br></br></br>  <br><br>I see nothing wrong with adding new stuff as long as it doesn't diverge from the main story.</br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags </br>  TERRORISTS!<br><br>IT'S JAPAN'S DUBBYA</br></br>  was that a real picture they just snuck in there?  The split screens are weird.  I WANT SLAUGHTER AT ALNUS HILL NOW. <br><br>Please don't save it for episode two</br></br>  <br>Congrats, for getting so many replies.</br>  All these yaoi vibes  <br>yeah, that threw me of. I thought that was MX doing it.</br>  MC VA is Junichi Suwabe right?  <br>THERE'S NO TIME</br>  <br>Its Archer's Seiyuu.<br><br>Its why its rather imperfect... but it still works.</br></br></br>   japanese imperial flag   IT'S MOTHERFUCKING KOIZUMI  <br>(You)</br>  <br><br>Yes. Archer is the bone of his rifle.</br></br>  The only positive about this adoptation - i am sure it`ll be huge hit in China, and China will make its own version of Gate as response: which would be awesome. Live action with 3DCGI jacky chan as not-Itami.  <br>I DON'T WANT MY WARBONER TO DISAPPEAR UNFULFILLED</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Shut up, it's legal now.</br>  <br>That's just how Nips are.</br>  <br>That's still the flag of the navy. Not so sure about the army though.</br>   three months <br> implying they'd actually let three months pass </br>  This is shit. Oh well at least it'll turn into a entertaining trainwreak.  IT'S HAPPENING  Loli no ;_;  JSDF BANZAI  TIME TO FUCK SOME ROMAN LEGION SHIT UP  <br>So is being retarded, you're still here.</br>  AW SHIT. ALNUS BATTLE IS ON.    FUCK THIS SHIT   cliffhanger <br>HAHAHAHAHA</br>  So its a show about Japan gathering all their air-soft otaku, naming them JDF and sending them through the gate to death in alternate world, so that Japan`s economy would suffer not so much with those neet fatases?  <br>he doesn't even really sound like aoimine or archer either</br>   dat choir   We Disco Hummvee now?  Huh, so that's how the gate transition goes. Always wondered about that.  I want to join the JSDF now.  Who fapping to Tank gas just now?  This ED is somehow good  Is this an attempt of the Japanese government to get shut-ins to go outside and join the army?  <br> japan <br> having tanks of worth <br>i laugthed</br></br></br>     Do you think we'll find cat girls? <br><br>Oh you bet you will</br></br>  It was alright, I guess. Should've ended the episode with Alnus, but since they have 24 episodes I guess they're taking it slowly.  <br>inb4 the little girls parents are on the other side of the gate and all the interesting scenes are switched with a stupid subplot where he saves them from the dragon and fade to black for season 2 never.<br><br>well at least theres another 12 eps of die walkurie and rabbit rape goth loli goodness.<br><br>if they dont animate the dogfight i will lose my shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah liked the additions for that first chapter</br>  <br>No its about the JSDF killing dragons and orcs<br>Were you even watching</br></br>  <br>And reconquer asia with former neets? Yes.</br>  [ /k/ intensifies ]  Welp so much for &gt;Self Defence   Next episode will only show the aftermath <br>Please no.</br>  FUUUUCK    <br>Type 90 is pretty good. That ain't one though.</br>   CLIFFHANGER <br>WHY MUST YOU LEAVE ME HANGING FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK</br>  <br>At least our godess is still cute.</br>  Not a bad first episode. But the anime only story kind of worries me.  So, the simulcast is in 1 hour, right?   Magic Humvee ED   <br><br>Never heard of the Type 74 before? <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_<wbr>74</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>how far back are you guys</br></br>  FUCK THIS SHIT<br>SUFFERING FOR 1 WEEK</br>  <br> JSDF <br> killing anyone <br>You must be joking. Even Germany has better army and Germany`s army is laugthing stock.</br></br></br>  what a qtpie   Didn't show the firefight at the beginning. <br> Didn't show the firefight at the end. <br><br>Well that was almost an entire waste of an episode.</br></br></br>  Working anon here, I cried a little.   ONE WEEK <br>ONE WEEK<br> ONE WEEK <br>ONE WEEK<br>  ONE WEEK <br>ONE WEEK<br> ONE WEEK <br>ONE WEEK<br>  ONE WEEK <br>ONE WEEK<br> ONE WEEK <br>ONE WEEK<br>  ONE WEEK <br>ONE WEEK<br> ONE WEEK <br>ONE WEEK</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rory in the OP was cute.  <br>Who the fuck is that. Don't tell me that's the tiny big breasted woman ?</br>  <br>Yup, that's why everyone has screenshots already.</br>  how to resolution  <br>It probably wont even show that actually.<br>We'll know what happened when they talk about what happened which is probably in 4 episodes.</br></br>  <br>better than french</br>  ED is cute.  Welp, shows over folks. Go back to your holes.  <br>The medic of 3rd squad.</br>  <br><br><br>what are those tanks? they look too small. like theyre not even worth 1/2 a "proper tank"<br><br>idfk even. ive always thought of tanks as glorfied APCs.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>ok</br>  <br><br>This is streaming anon, I feel you working anon.</br></br>   Post yfw cliffhanger and no Alnus rape this episode   <br>EVERYONES DIFFERENT!</br>  <br>Its shit.</br>  <br> anime only story </br>  So is this series supposed to be objectively shit with bullshit politics? <br><br>So is it good just for the trainwreak factor and just a turn of your brain type of show?</br></br>  <br> they look too small <br>What ?</br></br>    <br>That's Kurokawa</br>  Anyone got a shot of the dragon getting rekt?  Are the LN's translated?  <br>No. Our army is a fucking joke compared to the frogs</br>  <br>It is. Unless you're agreeing with me.</br>  <br>Confirmed for being a loli. Not so much a fan of the cat ears things but Rori's anime design is fine. Now, her voice.</br>  <br><br>It's in the fucking novel.<br>The manga is not a complete adaptation.</br></br></br>  to be fair the alnus battle was like 5 pages in the manga at most. I'm sure we'll get something  <br>It's meant to be serious in terms of politics, but the writer is a complete retard and can't write for shit. It's best to just look past the complications and watch the cute girls make people go boom.</br>  <br>Yes, I'm hoping it will become the SAO of this season.</br>  I hope they drop the whole bullshit language barrier thing from the manga<br>That shit made no sense</br>  <br><br> ive always thought of tanks as glorfied APCs. </br></br>  <br>Type-74 "Nana"<br>It's a '70 tank</br></br>  dammit, I missed it. anyone care to upload to Mega?  <br>I couldn't see like 5 minutes when the romans got NIPPON'd because my boss came</br>  <br>you telling me he had the "Mysterious visions of mysterious girls" in the novel?</br>  <br>I don't how long, just show those soldiers and orcs and dragons getting destroyed by superior firepower</br>  <br>Wait for the raw if not subs on nyaa like everyone.</br>  <br><br>What did they do to the booby monster. <br><br>WHERE'S MY TITTY MONSTER, I'VE BEEN PROMISED A KILLER-MACHINE TITTY MONSTER</br></br></br></br>  <br>are you implying that the language barrier shouldn't exist, and that the romans should speak japanese?</br>  <br>But even no one want LecRekt</br>  <br>Its objectively shit series, with objectively great moments.</br>  Beautiful.  <br><br>Did he jizz all over you screen?</br></br>  <br><br><br>lmfao <br> not american <br>does it shoot bullets or is it airsoft?<br>but seriously, how does it stack up? can u summerise the specs of the differnt tanks in the world?<br>please /k ill pretend /pol is right for a whole week just tell me this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>UNF. MEDIC.</br>  <br>it isn't that small</br>  The scene where the gateworlders 'rampaged' through Ginza was fucking weak.<br><br>What's the point of an anime about war and battles if there's absolutely no gore or destruction?</br></br>  So is this /k/ the anime?  I bet this show will make us know Love Live director actually has no direct skill.  <br>SOILED IT!</br>  <br>Because Gate is representative of real world politics right? Fuck off, you can't even blow past the legalities of the situation.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>yes and /pol/</br>  <br>the large amounts of /k/ in this thread should prove that to you</br>  Goddamit Gate Twitter stop blowing up my notifications  <br>That might be anime original. I don't know. But the manga didn't expand on the whole story before the entrance to the gate.</br>  Please tell me well get to the part where the army fucks up those two dragons  Thanks obama  <br>Whats that? Lawn-mower?</br>  this is the A/Z, SAO, AoT, of the season?  <br>White Obama is my waifu</br>  <br>Yes and he took a shit on my keyboard too</br>  Remember that in this, Japan:<br><br> offered a full cessation of hostilities and a return of valuable PoWs without the usual slave taking and crap, making the Empire think they will be merciful <br> in their very next sentence demanded reparations worth more than all the gold in the Empire, a sum that the Empire could never possibly pay back. <br><br> demanded and gained access to tracts of land that are rich in diamonds, signing an agreement to share the diamonds with the locals, as well as gold and silver. <br> didn't tell the local government about all the other valuable minerals that they could find there besides gold and silver, which could be worth billions back on Earth, so they could scam then out of it all without paying the locals a penny <br><br> after the negotiations and official cessation of hostilities, stumbled on some captured Japanese citizens in captivity, who they somehow they didn't already know were still unaccounted for and they never bothered to ask the Empire before then. <br> responded by bombing the Imperial Senate with JASDF fighters as a show of force with no warning, rather than going through diplomatic channels <br><br> when a prince hostile to the Japanese launched a coup, gave support to a princess who they had more leverage over and would be less of an enemy to Japan <br> even though the JSDF cannot be legally used overseas in the role of collective self defense of an ally, and the public is against Abe's attempts to reinterpret the Japanese Constitution to make it legal to fight alongside the USA in matters not directly related to Japanese national defense </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but you just said it's in the fucking novel. Are you lying to us?</br>  Pros:<br>Itami going HAM<br>The animation for the most part<br><br>Cons:<br>Slow pacing<br>Gore shy<br><br>Also, left: Gate right: Total Eclipse</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's Japan's version of the M60, but with a lower profile because of that adjustable suspension height. It's comparable to the Leopard 1 and French AMX 30, as well as carrying the same gun as the first generation M1 Abrams.</br></br>  How was it?  <br>No battle of Alnus/10</br>  <br>The whole thing in general was not in the manga. <br>The novel said the defense was about a week.<br>But as for the visions I'm not sure so it might be anime original.</br></br></br>  <br>Better than the M60.</br>  <br>Average.</br>  <br>I hope when Schwarzesmarken rolls around they give us some nicer animation for commie hardware.</br>  <br> A/Z <br>That's the other show<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>You would almost think they are a government with their own interests instead of a charity organisation.</br>  <br>well then don't say it's in the fucking novel if it's not.</br>  <br>They got into the gate. That's it. There's this constant pace that feels like they are trying to fill the first episode with constant meaningless shit.</br>  if this show gets a second season<br> expect blurred bunny bush</br>  <br>They are not. Some have planned to "translate them" however... nobody was serious enough to translate them.</br>  IIRC in the manga wasn't the Tokyo Metropolitan Police riot squads with small arms and tear gas sufficient to blunt and repel the initial assault? Tanks and air support seems overkill.  <br><br>Shame then.<br><br>I'll just read the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You said nothing about the goddamn vision only<br> le ebin anime only story meme <br>How was I supposed to know?</br></br></br>  <br>Stop forcing this retarded bullshit. It's not even mecha</br>  <br>How is she in the ln?</br>  <br>Yes. But manga didn't have dragon riders flying over Tokyo.</br>  <br>They sent air support in the manga. No way riot police can handle that many invaders even with tear gas and a few guns</br>  <br>In the manga they used tanks/helicopters as well.<br><br>On that note, can we shut the fuck up about the manga in regards to the anime? This is not an adaptation of the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, but it's the manga what counts.</br>  <br>Tear gassing 100,000 people? Don't think there's enough for that.</br>  <br>The Empire started the war without doing any kind of intel and Japan annihilated them thanks to superior tech.<br>They can demand whatever they want</br></br>  <br> The animation for the most part <br><br>It have bunch of stills and it just episode 1</br></br></br>  If Japan is maintaining the legal fiction that the Gate world is Japanese soil, doesn't that make its pacification a police matter rather than a military one?

Yugi doesn't give a fuck about Souma, nor does he have an obligation to ensure his failure wouldn't get him expelled.<br><br>The only logical conclusion is that consensus reached, based on (obvious) clues in the recent chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she was never good?</br>  <br>If Yugi wanted Souma as his underling, this would be a logical conclusion but Yugi doesn't respect or care about Souma and wouldn't mind if he got expelled. Sorry Anon.</br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!    <br>Now now,anon. Don't make me cut you.</br>  <br>If anything he would want Houjou as an underling from the looks of things. But he also seems just fine letting her go off on her own.</br>  <br>She's cuter,but less smug. That's why.</br>  <br> An egg for you, /a/? <br>You must eat all the eggs</br></br>  <br>That's a no-brainer, considering her specialty, &amp; her arguably being the best in her year, in it.<br><br>Bottom-line, Yugi doesn't really give a fuck about Souma, nor the other 1st years. He has his eyes set on the higher seats, period.</br></br></br>  <br>Who has medium size breasts? Why is every girl either tiny or huge?</br>  <br>Maybe Hisako?</br>  <br>*nippons*</br>  <br> Who has medium size breasts? <br>Hisako?</br></br>  <br>Hisako is absolutely average, hair, boobs, height...<br>That's her charm.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Isn't she tiny too?</br></br></br>  <br>Just like her.</br>  <br>Average japanese height, tiny would be Yuki.</br>  <br>And they are both perfect.</br>  <br> tiny </br>  <br>Houjou aka stealth waifu</br>  <br>Or Yugi.</br>  <br>simplest answer would be whoever wins gets Shokugeki rights<br><br>but  and  are intriguing</br></br></br>  <br>He's a manlet, but he should still be taller than some girls.</br>  <br>Houjou is stacked like most of them, she just has a bigger body to match.</br>  <br>Why would it be even be intriguing?

There's no way a volume can solve so many unresolved conflicts</br></br>  So I have these theories about Iroha an Yukino. <br><br>Iroha likes Hayama but she seems more interested in what 8man's preference in chocolate is than Hayama's. It is odd to base your chocolate around who you're giving obligation chocolate to instead of the one you really want it for. She also seemed to stop what she was doing when Orimoto started talking to 8man, which is a move that other girls who like 8man did.<br><br>I have a suspicion that Iroha likes 8man and it using her "crush" on Hayama as a way to get close to 8man without triggering him and to bypass Yui's/Yukinon's anti-hussy sensors. She even forced an indirect kiss on him.<br><br>I suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.<br><br>Does anyone have any theories on Yui?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ie why there won't be time to develop the romance if it does end. at best yukino and hikki's problems end up coinciding.<br><br>Hopeful for more though since vol 11 afterword suggests vol 12 is the climax, not the finale.</br></br></br>  <br> Watari won't follow Yomi's path and make Hachiman fal in love with Totsuka <br> "Ah, um, okay." <br> The end <br>Moreover, this is a light novel, even if it does conclude at twelve, expect asspulls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui is secretly a lesbian and only using 8man as a pretext to get closer to Yukino.</br>  <br>This is not a Fate thread.</br>  <br>Excuse me, Yui doesn't have any problem with a harem. Yukino will be her wife and 8man her mistress.</br>  Why are you Oregairufags still around? Your poor man's Haganai is over. <br><br>Totsuka will win, like Yukimura.</br></br>  <br>so its bisexual instead of lesbian. Sasuga Yuigahara-san.</br>  <br><br> 122,607 copies Vol.11  <br> 12k BD volume 1 <br> Ending at Vol. 12 <br><br>It's like you guys don't know how this industry works</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> 8man her mistress </br>  <br>Abnormally shit taste.</br>  <br>No, I don't think you know. At best, the 13th novel is the final volume but purportedly Watari's contract stated 12 volumes.</br>  Only way irohafags can stay relevant is spamming a thread everyday after the show ends. Pathetic.  <br>I don't know why there are so many people obsessed with their ship's more popular than others, it's a fucking taiwanese cartoon character's romance for fuck's sake; the fact that it came from Facebook isn't helping it either</br>  <br>Did they realize they are not /u/ enough to ship? Pretty sure only /a/ knows the LN spoilers right?</br>   have a 11/10 gorgeous long, black haired girl that loves you <br> have a very cute and very sweet girl who has a 10/10 body that loves you <br> they accept who you are <br> they are friends so no drama if you choose on over the other <br> people keep acting like this is a bad thing <br>8man has it made. There is no way this can go wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pretty sure only /a/ knows the LN spoilers right? <br>As if people care<br><br>/u/fags secured their foothold in /a/, even more than /v/ did.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people like Yui? I'm honestly asking. Is it that she sympathizes with 8man? Her tits?  <br>Why would you dislike Yui?<br>No autism, no pretense, only lack of spine at worst.</br></br>  <br> Her tits? <br><br>you just answer it yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>dumb and easier to put the penis in  theoretically  if you were self-inserting</br>  <br>If there's someone who can fuck it up, it's 8man.</br>  <br>It's not that I dislike her. I just don't see much appeal in her aside from her ti- character design. But I see so many people praising her as best girl. Which confuses me despite me being aware of this board's shit taste.</br>  <br><br><br>i'm normally one for dfc i just like how genki she is</br></br></br>  <br> purportedly Watari's contract stated 12 volumes. <br>You don't even know the exact terms of their agreement or the possibility of its extension. Saying that this ends at volume 12 is just dumb</br></br>  <br>That's why i asked the reason why their rank keep down though. Oh well i filtered most /u/ related thread anyway, it's amazing to see my catalog page looks so empty these days.</br>  <br><br>This is exactly how I feel except about Yukino.<br><br>She's just such a boring, derivative, generic character. It is utterly baffling to me that someone could  genuinely  prefer her to a more interesting girl like Iroha or even one of the side girls. And yet apparently she has multiple people who think she's the best girl. So fucking confusing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Liking Yui is not a shit taste<br><br>Liking Whoruno on the other hand, is.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel the same. Which is why I prefer Iroha and Sensei.</br>  <br>She is a good girl. She is more loving and accepting than most of the heroines I have seen in chinese cartoons. <br><br><br>The only way he can screw it up is by not making a decision or rejecting both in a hurtful manner.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is a side girl </br>  <br> le meme bait </br>    Well? No Yuiposting?<br>Are the YuiBros dead?</br>  <br>Don't know about the others but I became a Yuikinofag before S1 aired because of Yukino &amp; 8man's 'Hachiman points' banter in volume 4</br>  <br>Yes, I am alive. I might be the only one.</br>  <br>I have a feeling you were baiting, but I will bite.<br><br>Normally the strong, smart, independent girl like Yukino is my type of heroine (okay, the "strong" and "independent" parts are in question for now, but that was how she was in first half). Yui only has her genki character to go with - that was my impression on the first volume.<br><br>Eventually, though, seeing her continuously chase after 8man even with all the suffering she got just kind of moved me.

Yet, as Hiratsuka told Hachiman<br> It really doesn’t have to be you. Someday, Yukinoshita will change and she might even meet someone that can understand her. There might be someone who can take the extra step for her. The same could be said of Yuigahama as well. <br><br>Their friendship is debatable. If you want to firmly believe the themes of Oregairu, then their friendship will remain intact. If you want to opt for something realistic, then no.

We really need a /kirara/ thread, not a general itself (because then it would be 24/7 cancer) but once a week would be nice to discuss all Kirara works in a single place.</br>  <br>Why are their heads so big?</br>  <br>NNB fags wouldn't allow that since they are retards who shit up any kind of conversation.</br>  <br>But this was supposed to be a gochiusa thread and I hated kiniro</br>  <br>It'd hit bump and image limit within a day.</br>  <br><br>NNB is not Kirara. Neither is Yuri Yuri thankfully.</br></br>  <br>Damn evil Karen.  You just remembered me of that anon who always bitch about the pissing in one of the Sonohana games. </br>  <br>Karenfags are as delusional as Honkers.<br>Karen even hit honkers, she is probably just bullying Honkers for being a lesbian, Karen is just a spoiled bitch.</br></br>  <br>This.

Honoka is into that stuff.</br>  <br>Choke him on a pile of dicks.</br>  <br>I came to this thread to post this.</br>  <br>I don't think so, if anything, they would post the occasional NNB or YRYR but not enough to derail or cause a shitstorm, like in their own threads.<br><br>What I would be worried about in a /kirara/ is about Karenfags and the YYS threads ERPers.</br></br></br>  <br>Where is the gif of Honkers honking? You know the one.</br>  Reminder that Sharo is gayer than anyone in Kinmoza. For example, in this comic, while everyone is trying to get a photo of something else, she is literally taking a pic of Rize's ass. This is noticed by Aoyama who compliments her shot.<br><br>(although I can see Honoka doing something like that too)</br></br>    <br>I wanted to buy one those coffee makers but I would have never used it.</br>  Lolis making coffee should be a thing.  <br><br>I imagined the one from the OP.</br></br>  <br>Please, sharo is not even gayest of her own show.<br><br>And call me when Sharo puts a wig on someone for being separated from Rize.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to lick Sharo's gayness out of her.</br>  <br><br> all those time signature changes in Chiya's song </br></br>  <br><br>The difference is that putting a wig, or stroking somebody's hair can be construed as platonic, whereas Sharo is clearly not.</br></br>  <br>That's not the point.<br><br>The point is that Sharo isn't nearly as crazy and obsessive as half of the characters of Kinmoza, she worries more about being poor than Rize.</br></br></br>  <br>i want to be gay for Rize</br>    <br><br>It's almost like she's an actual not-one-dimensional character.<br><br><br><br>Who wouldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know she isn't, but in a discussion about who's the gayest the more one-dimensional you are, the better.<br><br><br>Cocoa won't let Chino-chan sleep tonight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice, a new Cocoa's song</br>  <br> who's the gayest <br>You're beating a dead horse here.</br></br>  <br><br>Karen = Honoka &gt; Sharo &gt; Ayaya = Cocoa &gt; Chino = Rize &gt; Inokuma &gt; Chiya &gt; Alice &gt; Shinobu</br></br>  This show is like a playground for my penis.  <br>Where the fuck is Syaro touching?</br>  <br>Ayayanimal magnetism you know.</br>  <br>She's thristy.</br>  Anyone else watching Gakkou Gurashi for Shovel Rize?  <br>It looks human!</br>  <br>Yes.

The bank didn't take my money</br>  <br>I'd CQC her bumhole.</br>   Still no volume 4 of the manga <br>Even though I'm living in Japan, I don't want to buy a monthly magazine just for one short chapter of one manga</br>  What show is this?  <br>Grin tea.</br>  <br>yuru yuri.</br>  <br><br>It's a pain in the ass and I don't even live in Japan. However the magazines include 2 color pages, which is not reproduced in tankobons. And Gochiusa pretty much always gets a color page now.</br></br>  <br>The magazines themselves are pretty neat though.i used to buy compitiq a time back and it includes all sorts of useful info on upcoming games I didn't care to look for online interviews with vs VAs and creators and a bunch of somewhat interesting manga among which lucky star which I was mainly getting it for.<br><br>As I was also into gook games at the time it was pretty cool. I guess you do need to be somewhat able to read jap to get anything out of it. Not that I know if kirara is anything like that though .</br></br></br>  <br>is there more than one gochu app? I remember one that said "not available in your region"</br>  <br>I don't know but I bought that exact same app. Not sure about region locking since I'm using Japanese app store</br>  <br>Herbal teas for relaxing, black coffee for everything else.</br>  <br><br>Well, Kirara MAX has no articles (or ads, except for other Houbunsha stuff), just pages and pages of various 4koma manga. I'm not able to read much (I have to look up every other word so I pretty much only read Gochiusa and a few others), but the quality of the artwork is rather impressive (compared to earlier series like K-On which would've probably been outshined if it started now). Gochiusa color illustrations are always so pretty, it's really a shame they convert them to grayscale for tankobons.</br></br>  <br>Why are they so erotic?</br>  <br>what's so max about it? can't it just be plain kirara, why it gotta be different man?</br>  <br>Friend of mine speculated September, before the S2 hits October.<br><br>Also, Cocoa had the weakest song on the new Character Song CD.</br></br></br>  Is Kirararara the best moe manga magazine around?<br>Are there others?</br>  Gochiusa is nice but NNB is a better SoL.  <br>Pff Barakamon is the better country bumpkin title</br>  <br>Woah, this looks really nice.<br>Is there one of Cocoa?</br></br>  <br>Probably. This was fan art of the April Fool's prank on the website, though.<br><br>Anyway, PV when?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, the first Manga Time Kirara was a spin-off of Manga Time, specifically for "moe" manga. Later they spinned off Kirara Carat and then Kirara MAX. And then a few others, because more magazines = more sales. MAX has the motto "dokidokivisual to the max" and its thing was promotion of new artists from pixiv, doujinshi scene and so on, so it was kind of viewed as a stepping stone to Carat and main Kirara. It also had a reputation of the most "hentai" magazine with such manga as "R18" about AV industry. Since the success of Kinmoza and Gochiusa it became more mainstream, so there's not much difference anymore.</br>  <br>That's not fanart, it's the original picture by Koi. By the way Koi illustrated some magical girl LN, I'd post some pictures if I was at home right now.</br>  Would you an old hag?  <br>Yes because she gets drunk right next to sleeping underage girls.</br>  <br>YES</br>  <br>How good are they at chess?</br>    <br><br> You will never be so poor to use a paperbag with your own image just because you got it for free at the restaurant you work at. </br></br>  Which usagi likes it in the butt?  <br><br> Tippy </br></br>  My wife became a magical girl.<br><br><br>Cocoa is actually my sister-in-law.</br></br></br>  <br>You can't fool me.<br>Cocoa wouldn't let anyone steal her little sister.</br></br>      <br>Hario bonmac syphon coffee maker.<br><br>Looks impressive but middling results. Also a huge pain in the ass to use a small burner like that.</br></br></br>  <br>average gochiusa fan can't afford a 1000 dollar chair</br>  She doesn't look happy.  These captchas are getting ridiculous. There's no fucking tea, goddamnit. Even the middle one is actually cacao.  <br>Holy mother of god.</br>  <br>Another year of wretched poverty to look forward to.</br>  <br>Why is it written "Syaro" if it's pronounced "Sharo"?</br>  I hope Vergo and Monet will comeback to save Doffy for the claws of evil marines.  <br> cobra/crocodile <br>Pics ?<br>That reminds me, people actually crack shipped Doflamingo and Law back in Sabaody, before it was cool. Damn.</br></br></br>  <br> little girl  <br>She's In her 20's you speed reading cunt</br></br>  <br> &gt;pointing out how stupid it is to do so <br>that's where we disagree.<br>And I'm saying it's not that stupid to complain since other posts that are similar to fujo posts without the gay get shit on too. Rebeccafag, stupid theory posters. People complain because, to them, fujoposts are just baseless headcannons. And honestly it is. So when a thread is derailed because of things like that ofcourse there are some people that'll get annoyed. Shit theory posters post shit because they think it's fun too. I've seen a bunch of fujoshit posters reply back to complainers with more gay shit and jokes. They at least acknowledge or know what they're doing.<br><br>Unless, ofcourse, you really do truly believe your gay ships are real or whatver and have canon proof. Then I can see why you think your posts are being treated unfairly. But I hope you dont think that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shachi is pure</br>  <br>Only one I have at present is NSFW<br><br>it's a really old ship</br></br></br>  Finally /a/. I've watched hundreds of anime series looking for something like this. Mousou Dairinin is one of if not the best anime I've ever seen. It managed to be deep without being pretentious. The art style, OP and ED complemented the theme perfectly. The characters were fascinating and unique. And most importantly the ending was satisfying and explained all the mystery, without resorting to asspulls or nonsense. Not only that but it serves as a scarily accurate depiction of modern Japanese culture. Of a society who is paralysed by escapism, hiding from reality because they aren't strong enough to face it. This is a honestly a masterpiece. 10/10 Does anything else even come close?  You're a newfag if you think that shit is good.  <br>You're honestly an idiot if you think it isn't. And i'm not new at all dickweasel, but nobody ever talks about this show here. I've never seen a thread on it here ever.</br>  <br> nobody ever talks about this show here <br>You are new.</br></br>  <br>keep telling yourself that. You also haven't listed anything that you think is better, which makes it harder for me to criticize your taste.</br>  Samurai Flamenco.  <br>What did you like about it anon?</br>  OP is a fag.  It pales in comparison to his movies, and the terrible videogame episode alone stops it from being a 10/10.  <br>Anyone pulling a "nobody ever talks about it" "never seen a thread about it" whine is new.</br>  <br>What was wrong with that episode?<br><br>Irrelevant, even if it was true. Stop shitposting.</br></br></br>  <br>Not irrelevant at all in the past year the show has been mentioned over 1000 times on /a/ and had 74 threads mention it in the OP since the archive existed it has been mentioned over 14000 times.</br>  <br>It broke the mood that every other episode before it set and destroyed most of the sense of mystery. That, and it was just plain not as fun to watch.</br>  <br>Well fuck. I honestly hadn't seen these threads.

Thank God for that, I was honestly worried since we didn't have a reference point until now.</br>  <br><br>How does she look like a loli?</br></br>  <br> pink panties <br>slut</br></br>  <br>I don't mind the new design. I'm glad her appearance is at least as she should be, that is, 13 years old. <br><br>Also, Rori is best Gate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's much smaller than the elf.</br></br>  <br>Are you blind? She looks like a little girl.</br>  <br>I she now? I'm not really seeing it, but whatever.<br>This is just a magazine illustration, and what we had so far was her official anime character design.<br>I will stop worrying when she will appear small in the naime.</br></br></br>  <br>No, she does not.<br><br> 13 <br>You mean 18.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> LolisRDead doing "that" again <br>Fuck off.

She was basically settling down with Itami as her companion for the rest of her natural life as a mortal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>961 years old I mean.</br>  <br><br>Balls deep in dat butt.</br></br>  <br>she voice like a middle age slut<br>not a 961 years old demigod loli</br></br>  <br> she voice like a middle age slut <br>That is what I meant.

The weakest part of the story. I rather they fast forward it a bit and don't spend more than two episodes.</br></br>  <br> What? The anime is airing in a little under 13 hours... <br>I thought it wasn't till the 7th.

The anime at least looks good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with this.<br><br>In fact, the hair color change makes me wonder if they weren't trying to make her look like Tabitha.</br></br></br>  <br>Old<br><br>Hag</br></br></br>  <br>Oh.<br><br>still, that specific shade of blue should have been avoided. It's too jarring.</br></br></br>  that doesn't look loli at all<br> fuckin blind faggots</br>  <br>How much rape does this have?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Nah they're gonna do the entire season 1. <br><br>Episode 1-13 = From start to slaying of the dragon<br>Episode 14-19 = Prince Zorzal's rebellion<br>Episode 19-26 = Defeats of Zorzal and closing of the Gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enough to fill an Indian bus.</br>  <br>Any proof it's two cours?</br>  <br>Read the thread</br>  <br>Left, I really like rori</br>  <br>I think at one point group of bandits raped a girl, killed her, and threw her naked, decapitated used body towards her husband<br><br>I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though</br></br></br>  <br> I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though <br>The body actually flew in the manga?</br></br>  <br><br>CIA in full force. Fuck yeah.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty hardcore</br>  <br> filename </br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if they did that. It is certainly possible, especially since they want to promote the upcoming novel sequel and they NEED to finish the main story in the anime for that. Guess it wouldn't be that impossible with 2 cour.</br>  <br>Search by MD5, retard.</br>  <br>Honestly there's a lot of padding in the novel, and in an animated medium it would feel too dragged out if they stick to it. Only reason manga is tolerable at the pace is because it's still a printed medium. <br><br>I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br>I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br> I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist. <br>Seriously, 2 cour was far more than I was expecting and as such I can't really complain.</br></br></br>  Yeah, if they can condense 5 volumes of Log Horizon in 2 cours, I can see 5 volumes of GATE in 2 cours.  <br>Unlike others here I'm not really surprised with the 2 cours. <br>GATE is Alphapolis's biggest title, this is their "make or break" moment. It's natural they'll put as much effort as they can on their big break.</br></br>   24 episodes <br><br>It's been a while since I read gate<br><br>What are the chances we'll see itami  punch the prince? </br></br></br></br>  <br>i thought shortstack chick did that?</br>  Gundam Seed Destiny of our generation.  <br>Itami punched him first, then when Prince retaliated he pulled the gun out.</br>  <br>I just hope they don't rush anything.</br>  This is a relatively peaceful thread so far.  <br>Can't believe I am looking forward to this.</br>  Can anyone improve on this image? I can put the text in a pastebin  <br>The only way you can improve on it is by deleting it from the internet. Sadly it has already been posted so you fucked it up permanently.</br>  I don't feel very excited for this. What are some A1 adaptations that are actually really good?  <br>Someone's sensitive</br>  <br>Stop projecting. That image will only fuel shitposting and you should know that.</br>  <br>Someone's affected</br>  <br>Yeah, make the damn text readable against the background.</br>  someone mentioned being unable to find gates original webnovel version in one of the previous threads.<br>i managed to find it on my computer today.<br><br>www.mediafire.com/download/zriujpo8<wbr>mqtfn2n/gate.zip</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot the biggest thing; "Gate is a work of fiction, so any and all arguments regarding the current state of the real nation of Japan (it's armed forces, relationships with other countries etc) have no relevance to the fictional universe in which Gate takes place."<br>And that comparatively to the majority of American films it hardly qualifies as a 'power fantasy'.<br><br>Also yeah, green text is completely unreadable, and links on images is stupid unless you use a link shortener.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> But they are unbeatable! <br><br>Daily reminder that flips has one of the best special forces that could outperform special forces from developed countries even with shit equipment</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I'm in Japanese locale.</br>  <br>I have the same problem, but notepad seems to work.</br>  <br>Well, that solves it for me as well, thanks.</br>  <br>there are multiple japanese locales.<br>thats what i get when i set webbrowser to western locale.<br><br>$ file Gate.html<br>Gate.html: HTML document, UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines, with CRLF line terminators</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except they're like... double the size?</br>  <br>Wouldn't that be too fast?</br>  <br>Step up, senpai.</br>  <br>Haha.<br><br>But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes  like this guy's saying. This isn't your typical LN adaption.</br></br></br>  <br>But that's nearly two hours of screen time per book which is more than what they actually got and I seriously doubt the GATE novel is that long.</br>  <br>Also, it's a fucking web novel so I'm sure there's some form of dumb bullshit they could cut and nobody would give a fuck.</br>  <br>certainly bigger, but not double</br>  <br>Remember that in this, Japan:<br><br> offered a full cessation of hostilities and a return of valuable PoWs without the usual slave taking and crap, making the Empire think they will be merciful <br> in their very next sentence demanded reparations worth more than all the gold in the Empire, a sum that the Empire could never possibly pay back. <br><br> demanded and gained access to tracts of land that are rich in diamonds, signing an agreement to share the diamonds with the locals, as well as gold and silver. <br> didn't tell the local government about all the other valuable minerals that they could find there besides gold and silver, which could be worth billions back on Earth, so they could scam then out of it all without paying the locals a penny <br><br> after the negotiations and official cessation of hostilities, stumbled on some captured Japanese citizens in captivity, who they somehow they didn't already know were still unaccounted for and they never bothered to ask the Empire before then. <br> responded by bombing the Imperial Senate with JASDF fighters as a show of force with no warning, rather than going through diplomatic channels <br><br> when a prince hostile to the Japanese launched a coup, gave support to a princess who they had more leverage over and would be less of an enemy to Japan <br> even though the JSDF cannot be legally used overseas in the role of collective self defense of an ally, and the public is protesting against Abe's attempts to reinterpret the Japanese Constitution to make it legal to fight alongside the USA overseas <br><br>REMEMBER <br><br>JAPANESE PUBLIC OPINION IRL IS HEAVILY AGAINST LIBERALLY REINTERPRETING THE SDF CHARTER WHICH THEIR PM HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people thinking A-1 won't fuck up   <br>Is 2 hours per arc enough? I think that 2:30 hours is the ideal length of a movie for me.</br>  <br>Fuck up is relative. <br>I for one don't think A-1 fucked up SAO. That was shit from the source.</br></br>  <br>I know a lot of mangafags complained about Nanatsu no Taizai. It was also a complete QUALITY fest in the second half, as expected of A-1.</br>  <br>Seven sins was fine. <br>sourcefags will complain no matter what.</br></br>  This is going to be a war strategies/political anime? B-boring.  <br>Let them complain. It's nothing compared to the turd anime One Piece had become.</br>  <br>Neither was Log Horizon.</br>  <br>LH was a light novel. I meant the format in that post. <br>but basing on the anime it seems like they will adapt the light novel?</br></br>  <br> But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes <br><br>Stop and think about what you're saying here. <br><br>They adapted first 5 Harry Potter novels in to 5 movies, 157 minutes each. That's 785 minutes including the long credits. <br><br>24 episodes of anime is 600 minutes, including OP/ED.<br><br>It's not as outrageous a difference as you seem to think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>You see those 9 colorful books on the top shelf? That's Log Horizon. <br>Log Horizon is most definitely NOT small books. <br><br>Now see the shelf below it. <br>The tiny little books on the left side are the GATE light novels, two of those equal one of the GATE books the large books you see to the right of the manga adaptation on the same shelf)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oops, off by one.. I meant see </br>    <br>What you haven't ever made simple mistakes, Sigmund?</br>  <br> Oops, off by one <br>Yeah, I see that.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it's because they streamlined and cut content from the novel version. It doesn't really tell me anything. As for LH are they really that big? It seemed like Haruhi and Spice was longer than those.</br>  <br>My point is that you did not make a mistake.</br>  <br>The adaptation itself being really good? Hasn't really happened.<br>Stuff like Silver Spoon was serviceable, but simply because of the source's story,.<br>So while it won't be visually amazing, with at least the blessing of 2 cour, it'll be passable and cover new material. All we could really ask for.</br></br></br>  <br>Which episodes will be QUALITY?</br>  <br>I'll help out by marking them</br>  <br><br>But SIlver Spoon was really nicely animated throughout. A-1 vary massively. <br>My guess is that they put a lot of money into this so it should look pretty good like SAO, Shigatsu etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks but I know what's what. <br>I just didn't know those blue books were counted too.<br><br>I'm not confident enough in 5 novels for 24 eps.<br>There was a lot of material skipped for LH as well and it didn't seem long to me when I read it.<br><br>And judging by the art of the anime I think it's the light novels that will get adapted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm reading the mushoku manga, but it's hella slow. How the fuck does he manages to marry the 3 girls, the fuck? (childhood friend, royalty brat, and sensei)</br>  <br>Through years of hardships and impotence.</br>  <br>Got separated from the childhood friend by his dad to prevent crippling dependence by childhood friend<br><br>Traveled the world with ojousama and gave each other their virginities then ojousama left to go train in a cave for years (he thought she was dumping him because she's really bad at explanations and just disappeared one morning)<br><br>Decided to pursue higher education, reunited with childhood friend at college and got married. <br><br>Went on a quest to rescue his mom (leaving his pregnant wife behind) but some people died and he ended up depressed, sensei who he rescued "comforted" him and they ended up calling a shotgun wedding<br><br>Much later ojousama finally returns after having achieved maximum powerlevel just in time to rescue him from being killed by the Act 2 final boss, she marries him and basically rapes him on their wedding night</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a timeskip, or is this loli sex?</br>  <br>What the fuck, I haven't read so far but what. How the fuck are the other 2 okay of him having 3 wives.</br>  <br>Obviously a time skip retard.</br>  <br>juve period &gt;youth period&gt; young man period. Like 3 timeskips.</br>  <br>Osananajimi has her own self esteem issues (even though she's like a crack secret service agent and shit)<br><br>Sensei is just happy to share<br><br>Ojousama is confident in the security of their relationship even if he is married three times, (she also tries to get him to fuck the catgirl maid but he just throws the maid out of the room)<br><br>It's not like he just marries everyone he meets, he doesn't fuck his half imouto maid or the catgirl maid for example</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's kinda sad knowing Rudeus should be more mature than Itami since he's lived a longer life, but isn't.  <br>It could be that he settled down to his new world age and stopped thinking like an old man.</br>  <br> mfw eris gives rudeus erectile disfunction </br>  <br><br>Or you know <br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's been married, went through boot camps, commands a squad of trained soldiers, and a trained ranger <br><br>As opposed to<br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's never held a job in his life, parasytes off his parents, and never dated a girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>elf ass</br>  <br>The point was that pre incarnation Rudeus was a complete manchild who never really grew up, instead running away from reality into eroge and light novels and japanese animes. Hence why in spite of his supposed greater experience a lot of the stuff he says and thinks during Childhood and Juvenile periods exposes his immaturity. And why getting a second life grants him the opportunity to develop in a way that he did not in his previous life. <br><br>By comparison, Itami is a world weary soldier who went through a messy relationship that ended in divorce by mutual consent, animu and mangos is how he finds entertainment not how he evades engaging with society and work.</br></br></br>  <br>Were they divorced? I thought they were just separated.</br>  <br>They're legally divorced. <br>Although the manage to stay friends.</br></br>  <br> brown elf <br><br>are you telling me there's chocolate in this?</br></br></br>  <br>So Rudeus is one of us while Itami is a normalfag</br>  <br>Yes, used and slutty one at that.</br>  <br>even better<br><br>will she be present early?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how far they're gonna go. <br>If they're gonna do the entire First Season you'll see her fairly early on, like ep 10 or so.<br>If they're only gonna do up to the Fire Dragon Arc, you won't see her till well after the first cour.</br></br></br>  <br> pic? </br>  <br> One of those bitches are dead </br>      <br>holy shit fuck yes<br><br>thank you</br></br></br>   Pina doesn't wear extreme boobplate armor <br>I like it.</br>  <br>  pic <br>What is this?</br></br>  <br>Announcement that Crunchyroll picked it up for simulcast. <br>And it also revealed that this will be 2 cours.</br></br>  <br>tnx</br>  <br>Rudeus is who we are, Itami is who we wish we were.</br>  <br>Can't find this without the text. Help?</br>  <br> that pic <br>I feel bad for laughing.</br></br>  <br>That looks greatly more medieval or renaissance than roman. I am disappoint.</br>  <br>You also have to consider the format, it's not like a pocket light novel. Also, the light novel version, which is 10 volumes, is practically 400 pages each volume.</br>  <br>No it's not. It's under 270 pages. I just opened them to see. <br><br>Log horizon is about 350 pages, so Gate is significantly bigger, but not double. Like I said. <br><br>I actually own these books, dude.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's not just shadow </br>  where is chapter 47? what's those lazy fuckers doing?  <br>How do you know about it? Currently manga translation status is the end of slaying of the dragon.</br>  <br>Her wife looks like a landwhale anyway, good riddance.</br>  I kinda want to try to read through this again, but I kinda remember all the scanlations being piss poor. Are they still shit?  <br>the soldier chick?</br>  <br>The LN?</br>  Test test  <br>OK, cool, it give a possible that anime would go further than manga</br>  <br> That blonde drill hair <br><br>She'll be getting that JSDF dick in the end.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do they want the diamonds?

Like harem or what?</br>  <br>She gets dicked by someone from Itami's squard and he got her pregnant</br>  <br>Who will end up with MC?</br>  <br><br>In the end...<br>MC's main harem are still fighting over his dick, it will never be resolved<br><br>One of the soldier from MC squad marries the blonde drill hair and get her pregnant<br><br>Another from MC's squad who has a monster girl fetish gets together with a catgirl maid<br><br>Japanese Foreign Minister marries a Nobleman's loli</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Japanese Foreign Minister marries a Nobleman's loli <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br> inb4 he got back together with his wife in Japan and discard the fantasy bitches </br>  hour and a half until it airs. <br>Getting ready.</br>  <br> fujoshit ex-wife <br><br>Why would you want that to happen?</br></br></br>  <br>That's the safest choice since he's going back to Japan when the gate is closed anyway.</br>   Stream<br><br>http://www.douyutv.com/meizhi</br></br>   <br>My body is ready<br> I will watch it from work </br></br>  <br><br>I've not been so hyped in ages.

They want oil, lithium, and other conflict resources that are only useful with modern industry. Also just the arable land. Japan has a very real issue with how much it can import into it's tiny island nation via sea. Routinely there are huge strikes by overworked laborers at the docks.</br>  Crunchyroll doesn't even have their Gate page up yet.  <br>You could probably drive up the value higher by calling them magic otherworld diamonds.

Episode 1 finished. <br><br>They removed a lot of politic talks, it seems the anime is going to play safe and take out as much of that as possible.
