[ Just watched the new episode for Shimoneta and saw this beautiful shot of Anna's feet.  Joukamachi no Dandelion  To love-ru has alot of good feet shots.  Why are footfags so insufferable?  <br>well, sorry for being a footfag ok?</br>  more  <br>Cause they make insufferable fags like you pop up</br>  <br>This tbh</br>  <br>Fuck off cancer.</br>  Plastic memories  Footfag genocide best day of my life.  <br>Nourin. MC has a foot fetish. <br><br><br><br>It ain't any worse than the daily "what grill's butt would you sniff" threads and the like. stop sperging</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're literal imagedumps, and they belong on /c/ or /h/.</br>  <br>Shieet.. I gotta watch this show then.</br>  I noticed that the new idolm@ster promo art has a lot feet, does the anime too?  6/10  <br>No. Now fuck off, we don't need you to ruin im@s threads any further than they already are.</br>  <br><br>I don't find them insufferable, just strange.<br>LIke, why not appreciate the whole body? What is even erogenous about feet? I just don't understand.</br></br></br>  <br>How can you not find people spamming their entry-level fetish on every board and trying to force it as normal insufferable?</br>  <br><br>Those threads are awful too to be honest. <br>If it were up to me they all would be purged from /a/. Only anime and manga discussion would be allowed.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't even go to im@s threads, I just like feet.</br>  <br>Fuck off of /a/ regardless. We don't need you subhumans here.</br>  <br> muh circlejerk </br>  <br><br> He likes something I don't like = He's subhuman </br></br>  <br>Now here is your extra edge to accompany your edge</br>   footfags <br> not the Bronies of fetishism </br>  <br>Because waifufags and lolicons are so much better. Is an anime imageboard, go back to reddit if you can't handle it.</br>  <br>yes.</br>  <br>They are.</br>  <br>Heres hoping the 2nd season has more feet shots =P</br>  <br>Cry me a river samefaggot</br>  <br><br>is that a manga or something?</br></br>  <br>How are you footfags so retarded to not use google?</br>  <br>No, is from a pixiv artist who really likes feet.</br>  <br><br>Nice timing</br></br>  <br>You too.</br>  <br>That's a nice foot.</br>  I'm hoping for anime screen caps but you guys are just here posting unofficial artwork lol...  So you're telling me...you wouldn't admire this girls feet while they're resting on your shoulders, as you fuck her? I feel sorry for you, you must be so boring in the bedroom (that is if you've ever even been laid).  <br>Needs more webms.</br>  <br> lol... <br><br> you must be so boring in the bedroom (that is if you've ever even been laid). <br>When will summer leave, and can they take the footfags with them?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes because we have lives, we move forward while you continue your meaningless existence on 4chan posting edgy stuff.</br></br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <br>They're concealed most of the time, so they have a weird appeal to them when you're able to see their shape. They're soft, cute and sensitive. Bare feet on a girl gives off a certain aura of comfort and relaxation. <br>Of course you're not appreciating the feet by themselves, just giving them a little more focus than usual when looking at the whole girl.<br><br>And this part is really important: Like everything else, 2D feet are in an entirely different dimension than 3D. I would think that goes without saying but the fascinations seems to get mixed up a lot. Anime girl feet are soft delicate flowers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Problem is there's not many anime focused on this subject, i suggest sticking to the few mentioned on the thread<br><br><br>When you're old enough to browse</br></br></br></br>  <br>But 4chan's traffic doesn't even increase that much in summer. It barely increases at all.<br><br>You fucking doughnut</br></br></br>  <br> believing Moot's lies </br>  <br>Misusing greentext, and samefag shitposting is forbidden</br>    <br><br>The only anime I know of that has detailed feet scenes is the monogatari series and it does hint of the fetish but that's it really.<br><br><br><br>I don't actually browse tumblr I saved this pic from google. But like I said, keep your 4chan 'edge' because you have nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats completely unrelated to the topic though. As long as theres a good feet shot in an anime you're watching then its all good.</br>  <br>Making threads that belong on other boards is forbidden, as well. But don't worry, it's okay when footfags do it.</br>  <br>see<br> &gt;Recent ANIME you watched with nice feet service</br></br>  <br> thinking that justifies your imagedump <br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Would actually be more /e/ than /h/. So why the crusade against feet? You were bothered enough to bitch in the archives, and I figured I'd find you here.</br>  <br>Cause i am a huge faggot that enjoys gobbling on cocks please feed me cocks i just can't stop being a huge faggot</br>  <br>Why would this belong in /h/? and I don't get why it would be in /c/ either lmao. They're actual screen caps from anime here. Just how there are smug face threads and ass sniffing threads.</br>  <br> why the crusade against feet? <br>They get more than enough service shots handed to them on a silver platter and still whine when you don't give them seconds. They're greedy and need to be taught that no one cares.<br><br>Nice timestamps.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not buying it. For something to make you this butthurt there's more to it.</br>  <br> No one cares <br>Except for 13 other posters, thanks for your contribution faggot.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128688878 <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Yeah, it does.</br>  <br> Except for 13 other posters <br>And those 13 posters should fuck off to all the imagedump boards.</br></br>  <br>Or you can fuck off to /v/ cause you're nothing but a nuisance</br>  Amagami ss has this nail clipping scene that is quite hot.  Does anyone have this without the text? Its muse from amagi brilliant.  <br>it also has a nice foot massage scene.</br>    <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WWc<wbr>Ts3Vxbsc</wbr>  [ ]<br>forgot link</br></br>   foot fetish   <br>gif of that please?<br><br>Also, any good feet-related doujinishi?</br></br></br>  <br> gif <br> footfags will actually take this over webms </br></br>    <br>Sorry, it's an habit, a webm would be even better, thanks.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot about that and it was great too. I just made these gifs just now.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> gif </br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> upscales </br></br>  <br>Oh shit, you have one that is smaller size. I have a webm one but the size is too big to upload.</br>  Not sure why this specific scene turned me on alot.    <br>Hmm... I'd say anything from Magoroku is really good stuff.</br>  <br>Because you have a mental illness, perhaps?</br>  <br>Well, I wouldn't say having a fetish would mean you have a mental illness but thanks anyways.</br>  <br>How much feet shots do you think Nourin has? Are there alot of moments with the mc showing that he has a foot fetish?</br>  <br>He's tricking you, that's the only shot. It's not even that long.</br>  <br>It also had this scene.<br>But yeah aside from this and that image there isn't much more.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gzz<wbr>nDtHYXco</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Well, at least theres this guy which has a long scene.</br>  <br>Doesn't seem like hes enjoying it though lol.</br>  <br>God damn, what a lucky bastard.</br>  I came across this scene from Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!        <br>He wanted the girl to be the beautiful, famous Idol he's been lusting after forever who transferred to his school and instead he got a fat fucking cow. So yeah, he wasn't very happy.</br>  <br>Shes still hot though.</br>  Saten feet.  <br> fat <br> hot </br></br>        <br> toes gripping that stand <br><br>This conjures up so many lewd images.</br></br></br>  <br> using sandals outdoors <br>I guess /a/ was right by calling her a slut</br></br>  I was surprised nnb had a nice scene last week. Delicious nee-san feet.  I'm curious but does anyone want an anime screen cap collection which has 2000 pics?  <br>shes the ultimate footslut</br>  <br>I'd be into this. Do you have one lying around?</br>    <br>I'm going to agree with <br>She has slutty feet.</br></br>  <br>I didn't like the blobby shape of the foot here, but the way they drew the toenails there was unique and aesthetically pleasing.</br>  <br>yes, here it is. Its not really my collection so, thank the person who downloaded it all. Its on exhentai I think. Heres the download link for 2000 feet screenshots from anime.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#!r00DGCSa!xyY82<wbr>-otHHqLK5QQaWy7NMQmScwteUhGGN80qJ5I<wbr>kh8</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>For me its the opposite. The toenail doesn't really look very nice for me. It looks a bit like a guy's feet.</br>    <br>Thanks anon.</br>      Shaft draws some really nice feet.  <br>That's not how ankles work. Is he licking a dead body?</br>  <br>Those are legit monkey toes.</br>  <br>So cute</br>  <br>feetfags are cancer</br>  <br> those toes <br><br>They fucking knew what that would do to footfags. They fucking knew.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the problem with using sandals outdoors?</br>  <br>Uppotes are lewd</br>  <br>Now that you pointed it out lol... yeah it does look weird.</br>  <br> putting on a foot clinic for footfags all around the world <br> not slutty </br></br>  Anyone got the gif or webm for this?    <br><br>Trapfags are 10x worse honestly.</br></br>        <br>The japanese are damn smart, teaching girls to sit like that since forever. It's literaly the best position to showcase the feet. Shame no western can hold that position at all. Shit must be practiced.</br>  <br>literally perfect.</br>      <br>Yeah, I love that position too. I'll try to find more pics of it.</br>      <br><br>MORE</br></br>              <br>Fetishes don't need an explanation, but if I had to give one, It would be the same as <br><br>That said, it's not like we like ALL types of feet. I mean, who could like feet that have some disease?.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Have some more saten's feet.</br></br></br>  <br> Drawing Greek feet <br>Why is this allowed?<br>I know that it's accurate but they should always draw Egyptian feet.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ those are horrifying.</br>  <br>Just how most guys are born to like tits and ass. I am born to like feet. I have no idea why I like them. I just find them sexually appealing. I mean, there are people who like small breasts and others who like big ones. Why is that?</br>  <br>Lmao, yeah. That feet's toenail looks horrifying.</br>  <br> feet <br>disgusting-distasteful, dirty and not in the good way</br></br>  <br>k, thanks for leaving your opinion :) I really care about people's opinion.</br>  <br>Thanks!. Be sure to try harder next time :)</br>    <br>I'm not a foot fetishist, but I would really like to massage a woman's delicate feet like this</br>  <br><br>Obligatory copypasta response:<br><br>- Men are evolutionarily wired to seek mates with small feet as it's a sign of high estrogen production and therefore fertility. We're hard-wired to look at, notice and appreciate cute little girlfeets.<br>- Many scientists think sexual orientations and fetishes can form when the "cabling" of the brain fucks up and accidentally "wires" sex to something it shouldn't be "wired" to. The parts of the brain responsible for feet and sex are right next to each other so this could possibly make this "miscabling" easy.<br>- Feet are very curvy, complex body parts. Curves are generally aesthetically pleasing.<br>- The cute, dainty, tiny, hairless female foot is a sexy feminine contrast to the big-ass hairy manfoot.<br>- The feet and the armpits are the two body parts which secrete the most pheremones. There's something sexy about inhaling the essence of a woman, so the smell can be sexy even if it's "bad."<br>- The feet are very sensitive and a woman's reactions to having them touched can be exquisite.<br>- The appeal to the masochist/submissive of "worshiping" feet, the lowest part of the body, a body part which is often dirty and/or smelly, should be obvious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br><br>go kill yourself memelord</br></br>  <br> memelord <br><br>Careful there. The edge is gonna cut you.</br></br></br>  <br>I love this.<br>It's not often that you see feet worship in anime.</br></br>  I love this one  <br><br>Is it weird that I find the feet closeup on Fuko-chans intro kinda hot?</br></br>  <br>Yes, since they aren't very good.</br>  <br>google gives me nothing.<br><br>sauce?</br></br></br>  <br> this nigga </br>      KOTOMINE CHILD BASEMENT CONFIRMED FOR BD'S!  <br>Is this a edit I'm not aware of?</br>  <br>This is shit, of all they could have added they added the child basement? Where is the Bazett flashback damn it?</br>  <br>They fucked it up. Those kids look healthy, albeit uncomfortable. They're supposed to be mutilated husks that barely resemble human beings anymore.</br>  <br>They fucked something in FSN? Why this doesn't surprise me?</br>  <br>It's a tv show. Even on the BDs it would be hard to get away with showing mutilated corpses that look barely human. I still agree though because thry could have atvleast made them skinny or something.</br>  <br>That's an extremely bad photoshop. <br><br>Look at that shit. The lighting on Kirei. The inside of the coffins.</br></br></br>    <br>Is that Miyu? What exactly am I looking at here?</br>    <br>Chapter raws have been out for awhile<br><br>Learning the dread history of this family and what happened to them that lead up to this moment.</br></br></br>  Mind of Steel is in full swing in a bad way with this Kerry.  More Kotomine is always a good thing, but they could fuck off and give us the movies already. Which have, you know - the most Kotomine.     Kiritsugu planning to sacrifice Miyu to finally see his dream realized<br><br>Shirou has to make a hard choice here one way or another. Not that we don't know where he ended up on the scale in the end already.</br></br>     <br>I don't like that smile that Shirou's smiling in the next to last panel there.</br>  <br>Everything is turning on its head, he's breaking, he can't do it. Hearing what Kiritsugu was planning to do soon.<br><br>Its a lot of pressure for the guy from both sides.</br></br></br>  <br> Dad, why is there a little girl in the backseat? <br> Not now, Shirou. This Prisma NTR Miyu Doujin is getting good.  <br> But Dad, NTR is for faggots. </br></br></br>  <br>Does the chapter come out and say how Kerry died in that timeline? Because I'm starting to suspect that maybe Miyuverse Shirou isn't as close to HF Shirou's mentality as we all thought he was. I'm starting to suspect he takes HF Shirou's goals but goes Mind of Steel with them.</br>  <br>You don't really know what HF is if you think that's how it works.<br><br>Image related<br><br>It isn't MoS, rather its the natural outcome of someone deciding to protect someone no matter what. This is an entirely HF action, not a MoS action.<br><br>MoS is "I'm dead inside, all kill everyone that gets in the way of saving the majority. No more hesitation, people must die in order for the majority to survive".<br><br>HF is "I'll save you, because I love you and I want you to live. I'll bare the sins the come with that no matter what it takes"<br><br>Both of those paths are just fine with killing in some situations if necessary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who is so retard to buy those BD directed by an hack</br>  <br>Japaneses</br>  Damn you're slow anon, those pics have been out for over a day. <br>Still looking forward to seeing that shit animated though, I wonder how where they're even gonna fit the scene. At the beggining of the 2nd cour, Caster has already taken over the church.</br>  <br>It's the I want to help Sakura option, not Mind Steel. If were Mind Steel, he would agree with Kerry.<br><br>Miyu = Sakura parallel was pushed very hard since 3rei began.</br></br></br>  <br> that feel when the difference between F/SN and prisma illya is this shit with miyu and shirou overall saying fuck it and going full HF on dealing with kiritsugu. </br>  <br>I never thought Shirou considered Servants to really be alive, because if he does then that's a conflict with his ideals that the VN never even acknowledges, let alone addresses. Because no version of Shirou goes even attempts to save a Servant that isn't Saber.</br>  <br>Yeah<br><br>All of the paths of Prism have lined up with Fate so far, to the point that the author probably doesn't know what to do after this arc.<br><br>1rei(?) is Fate route, simple but effective<br><br>2wei is UBW route, with full on Archer and Gilgamesh stuff<br><br>3rei is HF, in a heavily lampshaded way.<br><br>Kiritsugu represents MoS, Shirou represents HF<br><br>Ilya represents "Fuck that shit, I'll just save everyone, using magic and miracles".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now you're starting to understand his hypocrisy</br>  Weren't they kids who survived the blast in zero?<br><br>if this happens 10 years later shouldn't they be adults by now?</br></br>  <br> Miyu = Sakura parallel was pushed very hard since 3rei began. <br><br>except you know, Miyu isn't a filthy wormslut that only screws everyone who gives a shit over to the point of death, or a complete psycho.</br></br></br>  <br>We're trying to have a reasonable discussion here, so please take that shitflinging elsewhere.<br><br>Not even a Sakurafag. Best FSN is Rider, best TM is Aoko.</br></br></br>  <br>Difference between Prism main world and F/SN is Kiritsugu going "Fuck it" and going full HF instead, and saving everyone<br><br>Holy shit</br></br></br>  <br> truth=shitposting now <br>i smell a sakurafag.</br></br>  <br>Kerry is the man and he's out there everyday still trying to save people.</br>    <br>Post your face when Kuro gets heart surgery by the good doctor.</br>  <br>She's not that kind of grail, she's not a fake human where the heart stays alive after removing so much.<br><br>She's a human who just happened to have the same function as a grail, due to being an error that the world gave birth to by chance.</br></br></br>  <br>This is just one of many scenes supposedly confirmed for the BDs. The first three episodes alone, from the info we've been given from the time they were aired at that con, had 7+ minutes of material cut from them.<br><br>We also have confirmation that stuff was cut from episodes 16, 24, and 25. I'm guessing this scene though fits somewhere between that.</br></br></br>  <br>The movie isn't going until at least 2017 I'm guessing. Ufotable's still got 10 episodes of that shitheap that is God Eater to blow through, and after that they've got a Tales of anime scheduled for 2016.</br>  <br>We don't know that it was HF. If Kiritsugu had known the Grail was bullshit from the start, Zero would have happened differently.<br><br>The Prisma situation with cards is so different that who knows what happened.</br></br></br>  <br>Episode 13: A scene where Shirou wanders around the city injured, and a scene where Saber gets groped. This really could amount to just a few seconds though.<br>Episode 14: Supposedly a whopping 7 minutes will be added to Caster's backstory, with emphasis on how her master wanted her to summon a dragon. The maid's deaths also are supposed to be uncensored, from what I understand.<br>Episode 15: Ilya's eyes getting slashed will be shown.<br>Episode 16: 5 minutes was cut, with a conversation involving Kuzuki and Archer being expanded on.<br>Episode 24: An opening scene before the credits was cut. Confirmed by viewers who saw a private screening with Ufotable staff<br>Episode 25: Nasu mentioned extra content involving Luvia was written for this episode and will be added on the BDs.<br><br>And now we have a scene showing off Kirei's basement to add to the mix.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We don't know that it was HF <br><br>Read the image more<br><br> To save the many, he chose to sacrifice the few. That's the kind of hero he tried to be <br> But for just one person, he threw it all away. Even though he knew it was wrong <br> He chose to walk the path of a human, rather than a champion of justice. <br><br>That's not indictive of "Well this grail is fucked, but it was just this one only, I'll just destroy it and move on".<br><br>That's a man who "He tried to be a hero, but for one person, even though he knew it was wrong, he threw it all the way to become a human again"<br><br>Tell me how that isn't HF?<br><br>That's not "Well this grail wasn't anything, but I'm not done heroing and I'll immediately move on to the next hero thing to sacrifice the few for the man. This was just a minor thing, but I'll move on to the next thing now"<br><br>That is literally "I threw it away to save her, and I became human again".<br><br>That alone should tell you something important towards what I'm saying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ilya went UBW.  <br>Hm, that's true, I'd forgotten that bit. A bit disappointing, but it can't be helped.<br><br>Though if we're being picky, HF would mean letting innocents be killed by an Angra-bonded Irisviel and risked Angra getting loose on the world. At the least, Prisma Kiri wasn't that shitty.</br></br></br>  So when is Illya going to install the Berserker card?<br>I want my topless muscle loli already.</br>  <br>I'd call Ilya silly but Miyu and Kuro/Ilya are like a pair of wish granting machines running around. Wouldn't surprise me at all if they pulled off some world salvation.</br>  <br>The thing people have to remember is that Prisma is still a magical girl series. No one really gets killed, and in the end, everything will end up okay.<br><br>If there's one universe where "saving everyone" is possible, it's this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Cool costume</br>  <br>That's not what it means at all, that's just kind of what you want it to mean, as you mentioned "You're disappointed". This is what HF means to you apparently as an ideal of evil far above killing thousands to save a bit more than thousands. You're showing your hand entirely, you hate that idea.<br><br>What HF really means is that one will try to save those he loves; no matter the risk, no matter how he has to stain his hands, he will save them because he loves them. If Kiritsugu had taken a chance to save his mother rather than shooting down her plane for example, that would be HF. The possibility exists that bees might get out and it would be bad, but the possibility also exists that he can save her without that happening. Its a hard choice, but if it meant that much to him it is a choice.<br><br>It doesn't mean "I'll try to kill the world and the innocents", and it never meant that. Its kind of warped that this is what it means to you. It just means you don't simply kill the minority for the majority, rather even if its a risk at times you want to save your loved ones. Shirou still tried to protect the town in HF route and saved the world from Angya, he never tried to kill innocents for Sakura, he tried to have it both ways at times, he ended Angya himself, but if it came down to a choice he still can't accept an outcome where she dies since he swore he'd save her.<br><br>HF forced priorities upon Shirou, when he couldn't judge the weight of lives before.<br><br>Save Sakura &gt; Save self(to save Sakura) &gt; Save people if they are in trouble &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Save no one<br><br>He will save who he can, as long as it does not conflict with the first two pieces on the list. As long as he doesn't have to sacrifice his loved ones or self in order to help people he finds. Someone is lying dying on the road, he will help them as long as it doesn't mean he has to stab his love in the heart to do it.<br><br>So he was reborn as a human, with more normal priories.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now I want to see Kiritsugu meet Kuro. After she saved the world with Ilya and Miyu.<br><br>I want to see the face he has upon hearing that his kids achieved world salvation. Maybe not some magic happy world, but still, damn.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou thought about killing Sakura, but let her live and expected the Shadow to kill innocents through her. Although I don't remember it coming up, I think he may have also accepted the increased risk of Angra Manyu being born into the world (with everything that implies).<br><br>HF wasn't just about saving a loved one. What that loved one was--what Sakura was--changed it to more than just that. That's why I said an Angra-bonded Irisviel.</br></br></br>  <br> Thinking this is UBW <br><br>Seriously? No that's not it at all<br><br>UBW Shirou acknowledge his limits and that he could not do it, at all. He would still try to save those he could, but he would kill some to save the many if there was no other choice, just like Archer in a way, he flat out says there will probably be comprimises but he still won't be broken by it. The idea was beautiful, he would still aim for it, he admits its impossible, but he'd still try. He had already compromised a few times and had to realize some hard things, this isn't really the realization he made there at all.<br><br>Ilya says fuck that, there won't be compromises, I will save them both. Which is not even close to UBW Shirou. The closest UBW Shirou got was "Its not a mistake".<br><br>You want it to be UBW because you like that one a lot more and find it to have more meaning, so its gotta be that one surely that you like, the main character surely represents the one you want. This is Fate route however for sure, because that's the route when Shirou was going to save everyone with no compromises, and didn't realize it was impossible, nor would he admit it. He simply went full autist to the point of reaching a miracle.<br><br>Ilya is Fate route, the route of ideals and lack of personal introspection beyond a certain point as he just doubles down "I'll save them all!" until he reached Avalon. Kuro is closer to being UBW, but even then still not really. No route of Shirou reached anywhere near what Ilya is currently stating however entirely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but I think you yourself are missing part of the thing Prisma's doing. It's having these characters make choices built around saying individuals, the "grounded" "realistic" choice, but Prisma was never about realism. It's a magical girl series.<br><br>I mean one of the themes in the first story line was about doing what's impossible. Look at the whole learning to fly bit that happened between Ilya and Miyu.<br><br>You have all these characters saying something is impossible, you can't save everyone, but Ilya is a magical girl, and she will prove them wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Prisma is still a magical girl series. No one really gets killed, and in the end, everything will end up okay. <br>I bet you think Madoka was revolutionary for the MG genre. No, bad things happen there all the time. It's an unprecedented level of trolling the fans by killing Illya off here.</br></br>  <br>In the seven plus years that Prisma's ran, no one has died on screen. If you think people are just gonna start getting murdered and dying, I think you have a core misunderstanding of the series.</br>  <br> You want it to be UBW because you like that one a lot more and find it to have more meaning, so its gotta be that one surely that you like, the main character surely represents the one you want <br><br>You sure do like to write a lot of words, and you sure do like to psychoanalyze posts that were literally one sentence long.<br><br>Also Fate Shirou still committed murder, so right off the bat he's in a worse off state of "saving everyone" than UBW Shirou.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Incorrect. He accepted the responsibility of the worst happening, but planned to do something about helping her and everyone else, it why he took off to get answers from Kirei when he realized something fishy was going on and didn't just mope or whine about his circumstances.<br><br>Killing Sakura would have only been doing what Zouken wanted him to do at that point, the guy confesses to trolling Shirou hours later.<br><br>So yeah, you missed the point.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zouken didn't want Sakura dead then. At best he wanted Shirou to "betray" her.<br><br>And while I might be wrong about the Angra thing, I'm certainly not wrong about the Shadow. It's clearly spelled out around the Happy End Dead End. He goes to kill Sakura because he thinks the Shadow will go active that night, but then he chooses Sakura anyway.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You have to remember that Zouken's plan is to eat her brain as soon as she flatlines after fully becoming the Shadow. Her being betrayed and killed by Shirou will negate what little of Sakura there was left, and she'll succumb, he says himself that the guilt of killing Shinji only did half the job. It was his plan of course, and he said at the beginning of the route Sakura dying didn't matter to him, so you are wrong there too.<br><br>And in that scene you posted, he accepts the possibility, because it is the reality, but still wants to try. Which enables him to find the clarity of mind to question Zouken and Kotomine, when he was at his wits end (you see the screen turn red because the dude is crying without even realizing it). Happy end was again, him thinking that he had to do that, because he didn't know the Shadow doesn't come out if Sakura is unconscious. In fact, he knows little beyond "the Shadow is eating people" and the spoonfed misinformation Kirei and Zouken tell him. That is the point.<br><br>The very clear message of the route is to not rashly make decisions. Killing Sakura would inevitably, upon finding the truth, show Shirou how wrong he was about everything. So it ends up being a waste of her life either way. There was no worthwhile sacrifice here like some try to spin it.<br><br>More to the point, even if he tried, she would just regen outside of her will, so it was pointless. She had her head cut off the previous night, so no quick stab from him was gonna do the job.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump  How many minutes of content do you think the BDs will add? There are a lot of promised scenes .  <br><br>Kerry never actually appear on Prism, yet whenever he mentioned, referenced, silhouetted, or make badass backview he always make reader orgasm. Just like Kirei did.<br><br>Holy shit/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He appears heavily in the most recent chapter<br><br>Its evil Kerry though, the hero Kerry.</br></br></br>  <br> Kerry never actually appear on Prism <br>Are you sure? I have a faint memory of him showing up for a split second with Iri before setting out again.</br></br>  <br>So what is this?<br><br>Kerry a kiddie diddler?</br></br></br>  <br>I presume Miyuverse Einzbern didn't summon Avenger / Ruler and didn't hire Kerry, yet he win all the way (I guess he summon Assassin or Caster) then Einzbern Grail give birth to Ainsworth Grail a.k.a Miyu?<br><br>Kerry want to sacrifice Miyu to gain world peace, Shirou refused then backstab Kerry. Am I got that right?<br><br><br>Yeah, smoking on a hill with his Benz behind him. Count that as badass backview.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Is he still voiced by Kira here?</br>  <br>What would've happened if Kerry knew the Grail was bullshit from the start?</br>  <br>They save that for Hollow Ataraxia.</br>  <br> Am I got that right? <br><br>Not even close</br></br></br>  <br>Okay, please explain it. I'm not too bright, I hope you can make it simple.</br>  <br>5 years and 9 months ago, Kiritsugu and Shirou arrived at Fuyuki City to investigate the Cult/Belief/Religion of the "Child of God" but was iterrupted by a black fog enveloping the city, though shortly It dissapered and Shirou found Miyu in the house of Sayutsuki.<br><br>Kiritsugu understood that the "Child of God" has the ability to grant wishes and alter the present without limitation.<br><br>With this, Kiritsugu decided to adopt the child and bought a house in the city to start his research.<br><br>Shirou wanted to celebrate Miyu's 6th birthday, but Kiritsugu forbade him from doing so, as he wanted to use the child of god to save humanity and end his long journey.<br><br>As a 12 year old child, Shirou is now facing the Emiya family dilemma of choice.<br><br>"Save the world" or "Save Miyu"?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But what will they play</br>  <br>Naked doctor</br>  <br>How do you play that game Anon-kun?</br>  <br>Rikiya Koyama</br>  <br> They save that for Hollow Ataraxia. <br>Oh give it a rest that won't be adapted. It's a fucking fandisk.</br></br>  <br>So, were Miyu Shirou and Kerry basically Kerry and Natalia, or is Shirou his actual biological son this time?</br>  <br>When is Mind of steel ever good? Shirou broke from it, Kerry fucked shit up from it. Iri and IIya both paid a horrific price for it.</br>  <br>Neither, perhaps<br><br>He still found Shirou after a disaster, but it might not have been the fire in the exact same way. He pulled Shirou out of the rubble of the house, rather than finding him mostly dead and jamming Avalon in him. Doesn't seem like Shirou wandered around the burned city listening to everyone moaning for help and being forced to ignore them, so far at least. Can't say I'm sure, but it seems like he was trapped under a house this time but was saved. Shirou was certainly traveling around with him a bit however before they found Miyu.</br></br></br>  <br>That's really sad when you realize that Sakura really is not worth this man. Miyu however IS worth doing shit for and I hate Prisma IIya.</br>  <br> but he would kill some to save the many if there was no other choice, just like Archer in a way <br>no</br></br>  <br> Doesn't seem like Shirou wandered around the burned city listening to everyone moaning for help and being forced to ignore them, so far at least. <br><br>That seems like a pretty big change.</br></br></br>  <br> Sakura will commit crimes she does not want to commit <br> It's not Sakura's fault <br><br>BULL FUCKING SHIT! All of this is her fucking fault, Ever since she fucking made that goddamn contract with angry manjew she bares the responsibility for what happens after it. Just like when she made the book for Shinji in the Fate route and just like when Rider attacks Shirou in all routes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura was like family, she was always there for Shirou supporting him in the small things on a daily basis. Even he admits she's saved him many times just being there, and helped him get over Kiritsugu's dead. Her daily presence was a simple yet big help for the kid to open up in some ways, while it also helped her in numerous ways.<br><br>Some players really don't like her so they miss out on a lot of this, but to him she was almost as important as Fujinee, or it was comparable in some ways.<br><br>There's a reason that this is the only route that's referred to as love rather than romance. Because the fact that she means a lot and has meant a lot to him for a long time is in no question here.<br><br>People don't get it; saying "She screwed him over, laughing about it, she wasn't worth it whore slut bitch" as they lose sight more. Shirou says it best himself in a way you can understand. He does not regret breaking his ideals for her at all, the only thing he regrets is that he couldn't help her sooner. Someone so close to him that meant so much, was suffering all this time so close to him, he blames himself to his own ignorance even if Rin says that of course Sakura wouldn't want him to know.<br><br>Sakura was the one who said he would regret it, he cast that aside saying he only regrets his own inaction up to now.<br><br>No its not sad, he wanted to save the ones he loved and had supported him up to now while suffering in silence for years. Even Archer talks about how he never was able to save someone like this when he was alive. Never able to save someone like he was saved. It was one of his dreams.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, it's not even apart of any events. All the characters are fucking out character and Bazett and Caren are in Carnival Phantasm and Prisma IIya that's more than even enough. Neither one of them have a role in FSN so they'll never be alluded to.</br>  <br> Uro: There's yet another different type of love depicted in the Sakura route. It really expresses the dark sides that all women have, but how men can accept that and love women regardless. Something akin to the "dignity of men" comes across. <br><br> Nasu: "Romance" is something where a couple blindly pursue each other's ideals. "Love," on the other hand, is something where two people accept each other, including the painful reality that comes with it. There are no ideals to be found there. It's just about coming to terms with reality. They don't even have time to dream... but you can't just keep pushing harsh realities over the hopes and dreams of young people. Let's talk about something more fun! <br><br>---<br><br> Nasu: He's the kind of guy who goes "Whew, that was dangerous" after he gets shot in the head. (Laughs) Getting back on track, I think Fate/stay night does lack that "battle royale" atmosphere, but I really wanted to make it a work that would make the users want to get to know Saber and Rin better, or cuddle with Sakura. Saber and Rin respresent the fun and sweetness of romance. But I wanted to express the tragic nature of love with Sakura. <br><br> Uro: I see. You really did separate "romance" and "love" with your heroines. I was swoon most by Dark Sakura, so I guess I'll never be able to make a proper romance work... (laughs) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally why? I don;t think anybody really cared about this scene,</br>  <br>When shit needs to get done no matter the sacrifice.</br>  <br>Was it even a scene in the VN?</br>  when is grand order coming out<br>that "late july" release date is nearing expiration</br>  <br>Pretty sure that the basement battery orphans only appear in the Fate.</br>  <br>The big problem with Sakura is you don't really see what makes her likable. She's uninvolved for most of the VN, and then HF comes and she's at her worst. You can say she was there for Shirou, but you don't see that.<br><br>There's very little reason for the player to be invested in her.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I'm aware it's in Fate, but I don't remember anything about them in UBW, which is what makes it kind of interesting.</br>  <br>It was one week last I checked.</br>  <br> The big problem with Sakura is you don't really see what makes her likable. <br><br>Oh my god, This so much. You can't just take a minor character, tell us all this bad shit about her life, bench the character even more by bed ridding her and turn her into a murdering psychopath that just wines about how nobody cared about her at all and expect us to give a shit. There's a reason she's not in any spin offs, has next to merc and only got one episode of focus in Carnival Phantasma while Rin and Saber appeared in nearly all of them. She's a flat character only given personality by how much annoying she was.</br></br></br>  <br>Should the Heaven's Feel movies add scenes for that then?</br>  <br>It's one of the bigger faults in the story I think. The narrative tells you that Shirou and Sakura are really close. They've technically known each other for years at this point, but she's by far the least developed heroine.<br><br>Ask yourself, if Heaven's Feel placed Saber or Rin in Sakura's position, would you feel more invested? I know I would, because I would have previously spent the last two routes with those characters, so obviously I'd want to help them when they're at their lowest. Sakura was kind of gone in Fate and UBW, so all you had to see was her in HF, and for some, that's not enough.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the manga is aiming to do that, which I think is good, there are too many questions with how the movies will be structured to get into that though.</br>  <br>Not enough time.</br>  <br>What if, and bare with me here, because I know that'll never happen:<br><br>We get 4 2 hour movies.<br><br>Would it be enough time then?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, I don't know why so many people think that HF Shirou is "I only care about Sakura, fuck the rest of world", that's just wrong.</br>  <br>Yeah whatever man.</br>  <br> more fucking OHOHO in the BDs <br><br>Oh fuck off</br></br></br>  <br> many people think that HF Shirou is "I only care about Sakura, fuck the rest of world" <br>Read the VN there's a scene with that. If you would have read it then you would know.</br></br>  <br>So, he basically became Vash?</br>  <br> implying that's more important than all the money they can make from HA adaptation </br>  <br>I began by thinking that #25's script was "mostly original, so I should write this as a side story to the original [the VN] story."<br>And so I, Kinoko, was at my wits end trying to write something approximating a screenplay.<br><br>That's right. You know what I mean. In other words, I bit off more than I could chew again. Fuck!<br><br>Thus we drastically cut the parts that weren't needed for an anime... but the generous people at Aniplex said, "It would be a waste if all of your Nasu-san's work was cut, so let's include it as a special in the second box set."<br>Those of you interested in what was cut (Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine, etc.) should check out the second box set.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Someone turned them into Koreans!<br><br>What spell is this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>50 million Koreans and none is browsing this thread, what is Shirou saying in the last panel?</br>  <br>Thing is, the story is a fragmented mess of random ass slice of life scenes. How do they turn that into a single lined series that's interesting enough to watch? Who would watch a whole episode of the little sister contest? Who would watch anything with the track team girls or shit, episodes where it's just multiple shots of Bazett getting brutally murdered by Breserker and other servants til she figures out their weaknesses?</br>  <br> Who would watch <br>Well, isn't Prisma Illya basically that? A bunch of SoL with a serious battle once in a while? The last episode was entirely about little girls buying swimsuits and people seem to have enjoy it quite a lot.</br></br>  <br>Prisma isn't really a super hot seller. It does okay, but it's not breaking records.<br><br>And Prisma has the benefits of being a linear story. HA isn't.</br></br></br>  I'm the night.  <br>You're not Batman.</br>  <br>More like<br><br>you are a blight</br></br></br>  <br><br>Staynight-verse, Prism-verse, Miyu-verse, EMIYA-verse...<br>Shirou's biological family doomed to dead in every version (we know). The world and Akasha itself hate them. <br><br>Thanks for the explanation by the way, I really appreciate it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do Arc and Shiki hate Shirou's family so much?</br>  <br>Well that's a nice addition.</br>  <br>I don't know. What's the point of adding a scene like that if it's probably not going to lead to anything?</br>  <br>We don't know the context fully yet. It could relate to Gil. Maybe it'll be a put that Caster destroyed the bodies, and Gil was starting to run out of juice or something.</br>  <br><br><br>What prompted this Kerry to save Shirou though?<br><br>FSN Kerry saved Shirou because Angry Manjew had basically just mindfucked him to hell and back and he had pretty much given up on his whole utilitarian schtick and regressed back to his naive childhood ideals.<br><br>This Kerry on the other hand comes off as even more extremist than FSN Kerry. FSN Kerry at least cared about Iri and Illya, this Kerry has nobody. So why the hell would he save this random ginger kid trapped under some rubble and go through the trouble of raising him even though he'd probably just get in the way of the whole saving humanity thing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Those of you interested in what was cut (Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine and Luvia's turn to shine, etc.) should check out the second box set. <br>OH HO HO HO LUVIA PLEASES GREASY OTAKU FOR SCREENTIME OH HO HO HO HO</br></br>  <br>He's still apparently dying, so its assumed some shit went down and he lost Iri and Ilya.<br><br>Uses a cane in one scene</br></br></br>  <br>Now Saberfags can finally deal with the fact their route will be never readapted by Ufotable?</br>  <br>Speaking of Iri, how do you explain her origin in Prisma Illya?<br><br>In F/Z she was created solely to be the grail for the 4th war. But in Prisma Illya, Illya ended up taking that role instead. So why was Iri around?</br></br></br>  <br>We don't know what caused the dead of MiyuShirou's parents yet, maybe they died out of something caused by Kerry again. Fuck, we don't even know what happened to PrismaShirou either, Kiritsugu probably kill them accidentally too while he was killing the Tohsakas and Zouken or something.</br>  <br>Why were Sella and Leysritt around?<br><br>Yeah I know they have their uses, but maybe you get the meaning. They built a lot of homunculus here and there in the Einzabern fortress. Its just that Iri wasn't the one created to be a grail, she was created for something else, or in order to give birth to a grail or to be Kerry's wife as a bargaining point.</br></br></br>  <br>There was no previous wars in the Prisma universe, but the Einzbern did try to create the grail for a few centuries on their own.</br>  <br>Retards won't give a fuck.<br><br>I don't know why you're replying to them, Rinfags will always try to shit on Sakura.<br><br>The thing is that waifufaggots hate her because she makes Shirou go against the 2 previous heroines, he chooses her over the other two and then he even kills Saber.<br><br>Waifufags are waifufags</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You really think there aren't legitimate complaints about how Sakura was handled? It all comes down to waifu bullshit?</br>  <br> Kiritsugu probably kill them accidentally too while he was killing the Tohsakas and Zouken or something. <br>Fuck, that just brings up even more questions. Why is Zouken still clinging to life even though his main reason for living in FSN was to see his waifu's pet grail project completed? Did Justicia still get turned into the Greater Grail and it just took a lot, LOT longer for the three families to figure out just how to work it? And how did the grail war even get off the ground with a retard like Tokiomi as one of the collaborators?</br></br>  <br> Why is Zouken still clinging to life even though his main reason for living in FSN was to see his waifu's pet grail project completed? <br>I always took that as bullshit, Zouken would had just found another excuse to become immortal.<br>And how did the grail war even get off the ground with a retard like Tokiomi as one of the collaborators?<br>Its not like Nagato was prodigy.<br> He was a mediocre, cold, bipolar, and much like his descendant, Rin Tohsaka, a goof-up, who could even make Zelretch exclaim "Hey, are you crazy or something?" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Woah, Gil is weak fags btfo<br> Gil is based fags btfo as well, because that would mean he was using the bodies in the Heaven's Feel route and still got rekt by the shadow </br></br>  <br>He doesn't need mana to stay materialized at all since he's incarnated, and GoB is super cheap in terms of usage.<br><br>Only thing he really needs to charge up for is probably Ea. He spent the entire time between the war in child mode seeing the world a bit. He doesn't really use up mana in that form so much. However right before the war he changed back, and in all routes he likely stocked up a bit on mana like this in case he needed some power.<br><br>Though a bit of a digression, the basement orphans really were more of Kotomine's spare project than they were really about giving Gilgamesh mana. That was more of a way to make it productive, when really Kotomine was just having fun with it. Its doubtful Gil really knew about it since he spent ten years in child form, and his child form is a real moral fag compared to his older self.<br><br>Ten years pass by and Kotomine approaches Gilgamesh saying "You'll never guess what I have down in the basement. But seriously, try to guess".<br><br>They probably showed the orphans in UBW route, because they're never doing a Fate route adaption. So they need to acknowledge it here even if it doesn't entirely tie in, since it still sort of ties in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That bastard.</br>  <br>Yeah, that was a perfectly good meal he destroyed there.</br>  <br> no proper Shirou vs Archer fight <br><br>Still shit. Couldnt care less for edgemine and his edgy basement</br></br></br>  <br>People are being too hard on him, saying that billions of lives are more important than one is not evil or crazy.</br>  <br>The problem is that HF rushed the relationship and expected you to buy into the pretense that Shirou is inches away from fucking Sakura raw. It doesn't help that their relationship in HF starts from lust and sex rather than a natural build up like in other routes.<br><br> and for some, that's not enough. <br>Try most.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They did it great though.</br>  <br>Nah, it was underwhelming at best.</br>  <br>World isn't even in trouble here, he's just decided that it should be far more peaceful than it is so he's going to take away all free will from everyone in the process so no killing can happen anymore.<br><br>SMT Law ending<br><br>The means by how he'll do this are by killing and killing more, while exonerating himself that its in the name of the greater good and altruism, that it'll be worth it in the end.<br><br>Killing a six year old as well<br><br>Meanwhile in a world where he fucked off and decided to save his own family and instill decent values in them, his daughter grows up to save far more than he ever tried to do sucessfully, and his son also saves far more.<br><br>Saving those close to you isn't evil or crazy either even though hundreds on this board would condemn it as objectively incorrect. Raising up children properly got him far better results than meaningless death and more death, that only resulted in a fuckload of death without meaning in the end.<br><br>The world hates those kind of people who say "The end justifies the means" and go on a killing spree it seems, as it causes irony to hit them especially hard as the result is often worse off for a reason. There is meaning in that, there is meaning in saying that just going fuck between the lines and saying its all worth it if the outcome works out can really fuck yuo over. Kind of like that guy in Wakfu I assume, though I didn't entirely watch that one. Literally the only way the fourth war could have gone worse is if Kotomine won, but he was only competing in the first place because he became fascinated with this Emiya fellow.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 20 completely surpassed my expectations.</br>  <br>And 21 was eh. They even did the DEEN swords.</br>  <br>21 was fine. There was hardly anything left to the fight. Watching 20 to 21 back to back it works.</br>  <br>I'm not going to bother reading the rest of your post since it's presumptuous as fuck, but I want to point out Kerry probably didn't intend to take everyone's will away. He wasn't thinking of the process to achieve his dream - he was desperate and was banking on it being the perfect answer to his life's dilemma. <br><br>Honestly, I could see him thinking it would just do something like increase everyone's empathy to achieve world peace.</br></br></br>  <br> There was hardly anything left to the fight. <br>And what was left was bad.<br>Poor animation and DEEN swords really killed it for me.<br><br>But you're right, if you take it as a whole it's brety gud.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hardly anything left to the fight. <br>Except the climax of the battle which also was the part that got fucked up harder</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry, what are "DEEN swords"?<br><br><br>The climax, at least in the anime, was Shirou getting back up after Avalon healed him. The run up was still great though.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=T9G<wbr>Ee9xDCwM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> slow mo running <br> those giant swords <br><br>vomit.jpg. ufo failed because Shirou looked like a weak pussy compared to Archer the entire time and it was not supposed to be that way. They nailed it vs Gil though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I realize you're trying to bait, but then you go and say Shirou vs Gil was good when it completely missed the point of the VN.</br>  <br> Shirou looked like a weak pussy compared to Archer the entire time <br><br>That's how it was in the novel though, dude. Don't let the DEEN movie fool you. Shirou was a fucking mess at the end of the fight. He was using raw will to keep going, and Archer could have won at any time. Shirou only won a moral victory there.<br><br>And the giant swords are a problem? Really?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> World isn't even in trouble <br>I can't read Korean, so I don't know if there was a new revelation, but I thought that the Miyu World was about to be destroyed, at least according to Julian. That already seems like something more reasonable than Zero Kerry, that wanted to kill his wife and bunch of other people to make a more peaceful world.</br></br>  <br>We mocked the giant sword when DEEN did it, and we'll mark the giant swords when ufo does it.</br>   Giant sword autism <br><br>Of all the fucking things to become a meme it's this.<br><br>He always had them you cunts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are they a problem.<br><br>No, explain to me how a guy in a fantasy setting having giant swords is a problem. Berserker has a giant sword, and no one says a word about that.</br></br></br>  <br>Nagato's daughter was mainly involved with the grail creation<br>Also you massively missunderstand Zouken</br></br>  <br>Doesn't mean they weren't always wrong</br>  ITT girls you want to hug     Am I cute?     <br>especially during the "totally not a PTSD horrorfest ,I'm 100% fine don't worry about me please have fun at your festival and enjoy your innocent youth." fun time</br>    <br>Oh yeah, I'd fug Saori, she has a great ass.<br><br>Oh, you mean hug...<br><br>Of course I'd hug Saori too, she's just so soft.</br></br></br></br></br>  This is a Light Novel thread. So, /a/, what are you reading and why isn't it My imouto thinks he's otouto.  This isn't an LN board. I don't get why LNs are any popular in the west to begin with, if you want Japanese prose just read classic stories like New Rashomon or Futaro Yamada's stuff  <br>I have never heard of MITHO.<br><br>Is it about a masculine little sister?</br></br></br>  <br>That's not its actual name. And she isn't that masculine, just thinks she's a boy.<br>Kind of like Yukimura from Haganai.</br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone reads Light novels looking for good literature.</br>  <br> I don't get why LNs are any popular in the west to begin with <br>More LNs are getting adapted to anime, that naturally raises interest. Then there's webnovel, who are free on the internet and makes it easier for "translators" to edit whatever the fuck google translate spits out. Needless to say, there are also some legitimate translations from people who most likely enjoy and want other people to enjoy reading LNs, so basically:<br><br>Increased interest plus easy access are making more people read them and some like it enough to make threads on /a/.</br></br></br></br>  Reading cute mahou shoujo spider, Kumo desu ga, nani ka?  <br>Damn, second volume already?</br>  <br> This shit again. <br>I don't care about prose nor god tier stuff, that's why I watch anime and read manga you fucking faggot.</br></br>   Reading poorly translated LN's   There's not much to read as of late, at least for me.<br><br>I've gone through my backlog and started binge reading wuxia a lot to make up for the hole of light novels and web novels. <br><br>Nothing to do. Kill me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tried Kumo Desu Ga, Tensei Shitara Slime or Kuro no Maou? All three of those are getting daily updates.</br>  <br>This _is_ an LN board. We want to leisurely read about OP protags and cute girls. It's not difficult to understand.</br>  <br> I don't care about prose nor god tier stuff <br>Then you should definitely take his advice and read Futaro Yamada.</br></br>  <br>Catching up with the Korean Zombie translation. For someone who lets himself get pushed around by the girls so easily, Ayumu sure got his priorities straight.</br>  <br> This _is_ an LN board. <br>It's not, fuckface.</br></br>  <br>Ayumu ended up with a pretty happy harem so he ended up better than a lot of LN protagonists.</br>  <br>Futaro Yamada's pretty cool. His novels are the stuff that birthed a lot of things that are characteristically "shonen" today and he pretty much invented ninja fiction, but reading it feels much more like reading wuxia, most definitely a good thing because wuxia's balls-to-the-walls insane and doesn't let up.<br><br>This is an anime and manga board, in fact. /jp/'s the LN board so go bother them, though the userbase is identical nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>So harem end? I don't see any other way to make them all happy.</br>  <br> Reading poorly translated manga <br> Watching poorly translated anime </br></br>  <br> though the userbase is identical nowadays. <br>Not quite. I'd never go to /jp/ talk about anything.</br></br>  <br> reading <br>Nerds</br></br>  <br> I post all my Japan/General stuff on /a/ because "/jp/ is too weird". <br>Hilarious. Even mods support this idea nowadays.<br><br>Quoting your fucktarded inner thoughts by the way, in case you were wondering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Manga and anime get by with visuals which don't need translation, whereas LNs can very easily be ruined by poor translation. If you ever, ever see a sentence like "even if you say that" just close the document immediately, you won't regret it.<br><br>Compare the shittiest threads on both boards (monsterfaggots on /jp/ and on /a/ those roleplay threads where the OP writes 3 incredibly thick paragraphs into which he inserts whichever anime babe he feels like and addresses the entire board like we're all playing a VN) and you literally won't see a difference. All of /jp/'s old guard has left to IRC and spinoff boards and what's left spouts unfunny warosu memes, and the same situation's pretty much played out here as well.</br></br></br>  <br>The anime make him more of a passive personnage than he really is. He didn't stole his reputation as a pervert in the LN, always tell dirty joke to sella, try to take by surprise Haruna when she's changing and so on. <br><br><br>Not an official one but that's pretty much it.</br></br></br></br>  This was a nice surprise, I thought I would get some localized bullshit like most fansubbers did.<br>And Izuna isn't bad as well.</br>  I can't believe no one has read this one.<br><br><br> I Can't Believe I Feel in Love with the Alternate World Version of My Crush After I Got Her Number in a Deus ex Machina Way While Never Minding the Strange Area Code!? </br></br></br>  <br>Do you have to shit up LN threads? They've been allowed on /a/ for ages so why not just get over it? <br><br>Finally got around to catching up to Altina translations. Volume 3 was pretty good but it seems like Volume 4 is going to be about Altina's brother and his love interest instead of Regis and Altina. They seem like they'll be an interesting act to follow but I really want to know what's going on with Regis and Altina too.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that MG threads were literally picked up off of /a/ and moved to /jp/</br>  Last things I finished up were Shimoneta volume 1, ARIEL volume 1, and Altina volume 8.<br><br>Going to take a break from reading for a little bit so I can focus more on work though. Plus Altina is the only currently running series that I actually care for and I've only got one volume left before I'm caught up, so it'll be nice to let it pad out for a minute.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't that just some plot someone made up in the previous discussion thread?</br>  <br>Every. Fucking. Time.</br>  <br>Yes, they and "weaponized /a/" basically killed the board, but even before that the board was slowly dying and turning into a dedicated space for people dumping kancolle and touhou images they found by sorting by score on danbooru. <br><br>Plus, what does that say about a general if it's so bad that no board would accept it and it literally got forcefully inserted into a dying board with a small userbase?</br></br></br>  Has anyone read C³? Do they actually explain properly what the fuck was going on in that mess of anime?  <br>Stop making Keit-ai into a thing. It's never going to be a thing.</br>  <br>It speaks more about /a/ than anything</br>  I kind of want to read the LN version of Tensei Slime after seeing the LN images. Looks like Milim's visit got basically stretched out for an entire volume or something.  <br><br>I run through them daily and then I go through everything else I know of and I have quite a bit of sites bookmarked.<br><br>Kuro no Maou is slow as fuck too and simply put it's too fucking slow. <br><br>It doesn't have to be one with a godmode MC that moves the plot fast as hell, but not a fucking snail's pace like Kuro no Maou.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Does Altina ever grow enough balls to take her bookworm husbando or is she still just acting like a jealous girl when another girl flirts with MC?</br></br>  <br>Yeah Kuro no Maou is really slow paced but I guess it's to be expected with how small all the chapters are, plus how the author loves to jump to other characters for different view points.</br>  <br>At least as of translated chapters, I think Altina is still too innocent to realize she likes Regis.</br>  <br><br>It's just mindbogglingly grating reading Kuro no Maou, in the beginning things were going at a fantastic pace but once Kurono met his Fairy wife it just hit a fucking wall.</br></br>  <br><br>If we're talking about the translated chapters then yeah, she definitely obvious to her own feelings but anon said he read Vol.8 so I hoped Altina made some progress.</br></br>  <br>I don't think the beginning was all that fast paced. It was just Kurono getting mentally and physically fucked up by the experiments. About 6 or 7 chapters of that and then a few chapters of him escaping. I mean it could have taken a whole lot longer if Sariel had actually felt inclined to chase him but she didn't.</br>  I'm reading "I don't Like My Oniichan at All!" It's pretty great so far.  <br>tensei slime is enjoyable so far. the translations are still very lacking at times, but not as bad as before.<br><br><br>i honestly would rather read the LN version as well. can anyone make comparisons?<br>the art doesn't fit that well though, at least in terms of the fantasy aspect.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the author wants to try to develop as many characters as possible for the readers to care about what happens to the side characters and to hate the crusaders even more. I think he takes it a little too far though.</br>  <br><br>I mean as in development, MC gets summoned and slave collared, he learns magic and fights in experiments, and then runs the fuck out due to the accident.<br><br>Things were happening, but once he reaches the village, MC just settles in and does nothing much in regards to plot. Just SoL for 20 fucking chapters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well isn't that understandable though? I mean his entire reasoning for smuggling himself off the continent to another continent was because he wanted to get as far away from the crusaders as possible and hopefully live a peaceful life. <br><br>It's just that wasn't to be.</br></br></br>  <br>I think for Tensei Slime the overall story is the same, just that stuff got more fleshed out like usual for LN versions.</br>  <br><br>I just can't handle it man, Wordmaster has these short and sweet tidbits of SoL between the plot instead of the SoL taking the limelight.</br></br>  <br><br>it already got an anime adaptation...</br></br>  <br>As of volume 8 there's still no real romantic development. I actually think it's kind of cute; it's not like she's full on generic tsundere, and she is still practically a kid (though I think around volume 6 or so she turns 15 which is their age of majority).<br><br>I'm not so much mad at her for not getting it, just that the author is clearly jerking the readers around. Regis gets called away from their army for a while and the night before he leaves she:<br> Has a conversation with Regis where he mentions a political marriage between her and her half brother, and forces him to admit that he actually has a purely personal interest in that not happening <br> Hugs him <br> Tells him to stay with her until the morning and that he can sleep in her bed if he wants to <br><br>At this point, unless the author is a total dick, the writing on the wall is clear enough that even Altina has to realize how she feels eventually. At which point it will obviously just be Regis being a fucking putz that shuts it down instead.<br><br>It's hard for me to be mad about it because despite the fact that Regis is a pussy magnet the series itself stays away from the generic harem stuff most of the time, and if it didn't I'm sure I'd just fucking complain about it turning into generic harem crap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The SoL there was part of the plot though. Kurono was trying to settle down in a peaceful place.</br>  Found out it ended so started reading Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria  <br><br>I wish there was a better translator, or at least more of them. I have to end up reading the translations from BakaTsuki and some of it is grammatically wrong, And it's not finished. I wish could read Chinese. (It was only in Chinese at the website I was trying to buy it at)</br></br>  What happens when Japan runs out "good" LNs to adapt into anime?  <br>Enjoy your endless magic highschool harems</br>  <br>They might finally hop over to adapt the more popular manga and visual novels.</br>  <br>But they're not even adapting the good ones</br>  <br>That will likely never happen.</br>  <br>When that happens, they will go back to adapting the popular stuff.</br>  <br>Sequels.<br>Sequels everywhere</br></br>  <br> Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria <br>i couldn't really get into it for some reason. didn't even finish the first volume though.</br></br>  <br>That design gave me a boner. Please tell me the translations are updated regularly.</br>  Reading Log Horizon 1 from a convention bargain bin. Got it used for 3 dollars despite it being released earlier this year.  <br>It's baby first edgy LN, you didn't miss that much.</br>  <br>They'd have to start adapting them first.</br>  I'm currently reading Kono Subarashi Sekai e Shukufuku wo and Shomin Sample. I've tried reading Yahari, but it is way to Japanesey to understand what the nerd is saying.  <br>It's over on Sky's site so decently frequently? Translation is going through volume 3 now.</br>  I never knew reading something I already saw in the anime would be so enjoyable  <br>My first thought was that it's about a sister that's a trans, but after remember it's a LN, this probably isn't the case, is it?</br>  <br>Someone already explained it like two posts in.</br>  I never thought it would actually happen, but the entire series is almost done.  Currently reading hikkikomori-tachi ni ore no sheishun ga etc.<br> All that references <br>Also for an LN with lewd dialogues, illustrations itself aren't lewd at all.</br></br>  Fuck off back to /jp/, fucking LN shitters nobody wants you.  <br> It's over on Sky's site so decently frequently? <br>Didn't he drop it?</br></br>  <br>Translation of volume 3 started so I would assume not?</br>  <br>mad</br>  <br> Not localized Shiritori <br>Seems like not all hope is lost for professional translations.</br></br>  <br><br>Synopsis for this reminded me of Fire Emblem</br></br>  Rakudai is getting an anime next season, right?<br><br>How much is it covering?</br></br>  <br>Hopefully enough for me to see this semen demon getting a good dicking</br>  <br>It will probably just be the standard 2-4 volumes in one cour.</br>  I'm really enjoying "Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?"<br><br>Anyone else reading that?</br></br>  <br>Can't remember all the details, but here's some.<br><br> Milim follows Rimuru around and does mischief, not sure if Charybdis was awakened in the WN version but it causes a lot of problem for the people of Tempest. Took all of them a shitload of time to reduce Charybdis' hp by 30%.  But Milim oneshotted it for them. </br></br></br>  Any moon reading friends wanna tell me how the Ookami San LNs end?  <br>Sounds fun, as expected of one of the oldest Demon Lords.</br>  <br>I really like the series' artwork. Doesn't feel anything like a typical LN</br>  <br>A lot of people. I'll probably pick it up too, I'm running out of things to read.</br>  <br>Seems like the LN version added more "SoL" moments. Looking forward to it even though I'm already done reading the WN.</br>  Anyone else reading this? Pretty nice fantasy series.  <br>I'm enjoying it. I really, really want Kumoko's story chapters to connect up to the Side Story chapters but that still ages away.</br>  <br>I'm fine with it since it looks like it gave us a bunch more adorable Milim.</br>  <br> Threadly reminder that you should stop posting that because it's a thing. <br><br> https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3206<wbr>139/1/</wbr> </br></br></br>  Kino no Tabi.<br>It's okay, I guess.</br>  <br><br>What exactly happened at the end in the WN version? I'm not sure I understand. Did he just go back?</br></br>    <br><br>Same poster huh?</br></br>  <br> He did since one of those sliders from the Empire stayed behind in Tempest and discovered how to travel between worlds, so Rimuru split himself into 2, sending one part back to modern day Japan with a certain devil accompanying him. Seem like Rimuru could switch consciousness between his 2 selves. </br>  After reading chapter 62 it seems odd that the kids don't react at all to the comment about Rimuru being friends with a Demon Lord but maybe they were still more in shock about his one shot of the golem.  Should I stick to the LN translations of Regarding Reincarnated to Slime or should I read ahead the WN version?  <br>There's people translating the LN version?</br>  <br>I'm reading both, but the WN translation is much further ahead and much faster.</br>  <br>The same group translating the manga is doing the LN too but they're only at when Rimuru met the goblins.</br>  Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is some good shit. Just finished Volume 4  <br>Fug, I remembered wrongly and now I can't delete this post. Here's the correction.<br><br> He did since one of those sliders from the Empire stayed behind in Tempest and discovered how to travel between worlds. Rimuru traveled back to modern day Japan and heals his old self with potion and sent a certain devil as his bodyguard. Seem like Rimuru could switch consciousness between his 2 selves and he tells his colleague about 'regarding reincarnated to slime'. </br></br></br>  <br>Is this translated by chance?</br>  So, /a/, why haven't you written your own shitty self-insert fantasy novel yet? Do you really think you're worse than the shit getting published right now?  <br>I've started and scratched a lot of worlds in a lot of settings myself, but never went past worldbuilding. Not a single paragraph.</br>  <br>Gotta write shitty self-insert fanfiction first, then step up to the next level.</br>  <br>But I already am. <br><br>It's just that I'm a hack, so despite having the middle and end already thought up of, I can't write filler/the beginning. <br>Stuck at creating the mid-bosses and plot for the begin; already have the setting, world building, technology and cast. <br><br>Not planning to do things half-heartedly or leave plot-holes, so I've been mainly editing for now. <br><br> /blog </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not politely saging for blogshit </br>  I know I am reading shitty LNs. Mahouka and Rokka no Yuusha. I finished reading Gifting a month ago and honestly found it enjoyable.  Can someone help me with finding out the reference of the cover images of Kono Subarashii Sekai? <br><br>I know the 1st one, but after that it's a blur. The 6th one seems really familiar but I can't put my finger on what it is.</br></br>  <br> s-sorry, forgot </br>  Question for moonreaders, how do I get good enough to read LN?  <br>I hope Volume 17 doesn't disappoint.</br>  <br>You  visit the daily threads and  _____________git gud  </br>  <br><br>I'd like to know too.</br></br>  <br>Reading Rokujyouma, damn Kyoutarou is pretty good harem MC. And all girl is best girl. I hope translation can catch up with the nip source.</br>  <br>what's it about?</br>  <br>Why hasn't /a/ made its own LN?</br>  <br>Because there's no viable market for Light Novels in the US. It came and went with Haruhi.</br>  <br>They already have. It's just that no one gives a shit about Original English Language anime or light novels.</br>  <br>What previous discussion thread?</br>  <br>Move to Japan. It worked with No Game No Life.</br>  <br>Have you tried to write self-insert trash?<br><br>Requires a certain mindset. I can't do it, feels awkward as shit.</br></br></br>  <br>This happened. The sight is still up if your curious.</br>  <br>nigga I read LNs for fantasy wish fulfillment series about a fantasy series in which an MC (hopefully female) learns magic, obtains OP powers, gets a harem, and fight demons.</br>  <br>Female MC? With a harem? That sounds like an otome game instead.</br>  <br>it's kinda funny how most of the series worth reading seems to have the least generic artwork <br><br> Slime Dan <br> Overlord <br> MT <br><br>It's like the illustrators puts in as much of an effort as the author.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not automatically assuming it's a female harem </br>  <br>Tensei Slime's artist has a neat style.</br>    <br>Lately it makes me wonder.</br>  I downloaded Kikou Shoujo wa Kizutsukanai. Is this good?  <br>some /a/non did make chapters of Keit-ai<br><br>don't know how the series is or if it's still updating.</br></br></br>  <br>Really if there was any series I am certain will get an anime it's this one<br><br> Giant Robots <br> fantasy setting with sci-fi elements <br> OPMC <br> trap MC <br> anime friendly illustrations (looks very smooth and polished) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A real LN, not a memefic.<br><br>Also, if you want to talk about good Fictionpress stories, read Mother of Learning.<br><br>https://www.fictionpress.com/u/8045<wbr>92/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Errata. Move to Japan and get a Japanese translator for your fanfic.</br>  I really shouldn't enjoy Hachinan as much as I do but I'm really enjoying what's been translated of it so far.    <br>you (or he) said "LN made by /a/" <br><br>which equals memefic</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, based Keit-ani!</br>  <br>Bullshit. It's already been done. Manga form. In Japan.</br>  Where can I download translated LN apart from Baka-Tsuki?  <br>It started with a really simple OC idea of every terrible cliche smashed together, with the addition of Dante, and spiraled from there.</br>  <br>Wait, it was actually published?</br>  <br>No, there's just a website.</br>  <br>How about shitty webmanga?</br>  <br>Why "Keit-ani"?</br>  <br> 11/9 </br>  <br>Main character looks exactly like the legendary hero swordsman who saved the world 300 years ago, but is actually weak and gets nicknamed fake hero because of it. <br><br>He meets up with the angel, dragon, and demon princesses who were in the hero's party that saved the world, and they go looking for his journal.<br><br>It's a nice change of pace, with the main character being the weakest in the party, and actually having to put in effort to train and make himself useful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Keit-ai confirmed for melting steel beams?</br></br>  Reading<br> Uchinara<br>Magicraft Meister<br>Hachinan<br>Magis Grandason<br>Hello Work!<br>Altina<br>Man picked up by Gods<br>Majin Tensuki</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   LN discussion reduced to make your own LN discussion <br><br>Sasuga /a/.</br></br>  <br>Guy Jean was actually funny at times.</br>    <br><br>Altina is pretty good so far<br>still on vol 3 yet i am immerse on it<br><br>Regis is pretty good despite being a weak little shit who have his brain as his weapon, pretty impressed when he stop that fucker with a gun just by making a deal with words and actually has a bit balls to say "deals off"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uchinara seems like it will be comfy and heartwarming.</br>  <br>It's a funny webmanga as long as it doesn't go full /pol/ on you.</br>  <br>Thank you, based Keit-ani!</br>  The only LN I'm following is Oregairu.  <br>manga &gt; anime &gt; shit &gt; LN</br>  How is Tokyo Ravens going?  <br>I'm sorry, but the King of Games has spoken.</br>  <br> pointing out the obvious </br>  <br>You're rude, but not incorrect.</br>  Uchinara<br><br>finally something about an Adventurer and his daughteru</br></br>  Is there any new hot LN that hasn't been adapted into anime yet but has also been translated?  <br>Too bad no one here will read it because it's not "shut in MC reincarnated in a game world with OP powers"-schlock.</br>  "This thread was a mistake."<br><br>- OP.</br></br>  <br><br>Lots, but depends on what you mean by hot or new. Also "translated". <br><br>If you mean fully translated, almost none.

It was never good.  <br>It was okay-ish.</br>  It was good up until the inevitable point where Naruto is revealed to be chosen one/child of prophecy etc.  <br>This. I was super hype about this anime since I was young. The manga ending was so rushed to finish at 700. There's filler for days in the anime, I can't see why anyone would love this. <br><br> EPISODE 7,302 <br>Today we will see what Shikamaru does in his house when his dad isn't home for board games.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;being apart of big 3 <br> never good <br>kill yourself right now</br></br></br>  <br>Average up to snake butt. <br>Possibly a contender for worst written manga wen it come to everything after.</br></br>  I'm of the mindset that it would be goodish if every action wasn't met with 4 minutes of expositional dialogue explaining what very blatantly happened on screen. <br>If all the fights were re-cut without any of the flashbacks and stuff, it would be much more enjoyable. <br>I'm actually kind of surprised it hasn't been done already.</br></br>  <br>It was never good, you just had shittier tastes back then. The side characters did make the Chuunin exam arc pretty enjoyable, though. It was all downhill from there.</br>  <br>I stop watching the original at episode 100 or something, it was fucking boring and reptitive at that point<br>Did I miss anything good?</br></br>  <br>The big 3 refers to the 3 most popular animes in the Toonami lineup that made Anime popular in USA.

The Chuunin exams were damn tense.  <br>I always loved that Sasuke/Orochimaru fight episode in the Forest of Death.</br>  If we're using this as a continuation from the last one, I'd like to note this is probably the only time I've actually wanted a new generation story  <br>1-220 was certainly way better animated than Shippuden. <br>Valley of the end battle (128-135) looked pretty good imho.</br></br>  fuck off  <br>Shippuden has Kakashi vs. Obito, Hinata vs. Pain, and Madara vs. the Alliance for top notch episode animation though.</br>  <br><br>I honestly don't like Naruto, But I have to say that it was WAY better before Shippuden.</br></br>  <br>Yes it was a 10/10 manga until the end of the chuunin exams<br><br>The arc where they go recruit Tsunade was okay, nothing special.<br><br>Sasuke's rescue arc was where the series died.

Report and ignore.</br>  <br>Says the Narutard burthurt he can't have his 24/7 Naruto generals anymore.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kXh<wbr>AGO4IE8Y</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>The first series still has the best-animated episodes, but Shippuuden had more consistently good episodes at some point when some talented animators joined the in-house staff.</br>  <br>The description is vague enough that mere snippets of something new can be new material.</br>  <br>It is indeed wacky, but the episode was full of great animation as well.</br>  <br>neither of those are even close lol.<br><br>you mean to say SAO,AoT and Fairy Tail.</br></br></br>  <br>Please stop giving them attention. The point of that mod post was to stop the general Boruto threads. We have had Naruto threads before and this is a discussion about the series, not unlike the countless discussions about other series on the board. Nobody's being cancerous, so there's nothing to complain about. Report all shitposters, ignore all shitposters.</br>   /r/ing a good torrent for The Last. Can't find a good one anywhere. It was released July 22nd right?   Remember when it was explicitly stated that the Byakugan was stronger than the Sharingan?<br>I miss those days.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128687294 <br> mah Sasuke  <br><br>It's shit anon</br></br></br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that newfag Narutard.<br><br>Your cancerous tumblrshipping was never welcome on /a/.</br></br></br>  That's what I've read on /a/.<br>Unlike most of these hypocrites though, I've never seen a second of Naruto.</br>  I stopped watching after the Neji and Naruto fight.<br>Still love Rock Lee.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128689892 <br> The animation in OG Naruto is much more charming. <br>What do you mean by 'charming'?</br></br>  <br>Literally no one cares.</br>  <br>STOP<br><br>REPLYING</br></br></br>  I feel like the science guys in the boruto movie are a prelude to a much bigger conflict. If they do a TV series, I'd like them to tackle this,  <br>It was never that way. Kakashi only states that the Byakugan has superior vision in terms of magnification, since the Byakugan can see Tenketsu and the Sharingan can't.</br>  <br>from what I recall, isn't hinata's range like 10 or 5km or something?</br>  <br>She identifies the flames of Amaterasu from Sasuke and Itachi's battle from 10 KM. <br><br>I wonder what the diameter of Konoha is.</br></br></br>  <br>i liked naruto more than shippuden but then again its been forever since ive watched it and i never even finished it</br>  No, it was good when he was copying HxH in the exam arc and it was good in the first half of the saske rescue arc. If the series had ended after the sand village guys ended their respective fights and just had naruto and sasuke just die from a sudden heart attack it would have been a great series overall.  <br> two main characters had the sharingan <br> a mini boss and a love interest had the byakugan <br><br>The sharingan was always going to end up stronger. Heck, Kakashi calls the Uchiha Konoha's strongest clan of the village in one of the very first chapters.</br></br></br></br>  only the first zabuza arc was good, everything after was shit  I watched all of it subbed years ago. I like the Laughing Shino episode and the rest of the filler arc.  The Chunin Exams was by far the best part. Rescuing Sasuke was okay. Shippuden I dropped after a while. I think Orichimaru was living in someone's mind or some shit. That was just too stupid for me to continue.  <br><br>go to nyaa nigga</br></br>  <br>oh god that avail sound was too much</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128691532 <br>you heard me</br>  <br>It's the SAME guy everytime, like jesus, do you browse the whole day? That is unhealthy.</br>  <br>honestly it was good for what it was<br><br>a simple unique battle manga with cliches here and there but that is expected of jump comics at the time<br><br>then it started getting retarded really fast<br><br>but in my opinion I forgave kishi for everything after hinata won. I'm not even a shippingfag but the tears produced were the best I've ever seen off a manga .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's got mental problems.</br>  Reminder that Naruto humiliates his son in front of everyone.  <br>Proof.</br>  <br><br>Enough. We get it. You're not being any better. Keep the fucking thread on topic. Report and ignore.</br></br>  <br>You only liked this show because you grew up watching it. It's not anything particularly special, nor is it anything particularly bad.</br>  It was good up until the timeskip. Then everything went to shit.  No, and fuck off.  <br>2dank</br>  Assuming you don't simply say that it was always bad, can you pinpoint the moment(s) where the quality dropped most sharply?  naruto literally shits hit pants in the ova. fuck off naurto shitters  <br>But those shows are trash</br>  <br>Literally every dad in Naruto was awful to some degree</br>  <br>Shikamaru's, Kakashi's, Guy's</br>  <br>I wouldn't say good. But it wasn't as bad as it is now.</br>  It was pretty good before it became focused on Sasugay's darkness.  <br>Kakashi's dad got bullied into commiting sudoku and left his son all alone.</br>  Rating the various parts, with scores relative to the franchise:<br><br>5/10 - first episode<br>8/10 - bell test<br>9/10 - zabuza<br>8/10 - battle royale with ninja<br>8/10 - gaara<br>7/10 - jiriya training<br>6/10 - bluh<br>8/10 - sasuke recover<br>9/10 - valley of the end<br>2/10 - filler hell<br>9/10 - kakashi gaiden<br>5/10 - start of shiippuuden<br>4/10 - literally nothing happens<br>3/10 - oh god something happen<br>9/10 - shikamaru<br>3/10 - training's done lets start training<br>2/10 - Sasuke vs. Itachi<br>8/10 - pain invasion<br>9/10 - GARuto<br>2/10 - mass resurrection<br>1/10 - Sasuke's Darkness is Too Strong<br>0/10 - more training, hyperventilation, great ninja "war", impure world zombies, misc. bullshit<br>7/10 - Shikamaru again<br>0/10 - fuck<br>0/10 - going below 0 would be too obvious<br>0/10 - obito reveal, madara reveal, kaguya reveal<br>7/10 - epilogue with Sarada<br>10/10 - Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You missed the Kakashi and obito fight. <br>That shit was cash.</br></br>  <br>nobody's saying the animation was bad, the style was just really miss</br>  <br>if not bait, big 3 is generally WSJ, so neither FT nor AoT would fit</br>  It had great fights that were well animated and with good choregraphy.<br><br>I kinda hated how Naruto beat up Neiji and told him if you try hard you can do anything when the guy has a fuckin demon inside him granting him superhuman power. That's like some guy buying a lamborghini and telling you he doesn't care about materialistic stuff.</br></br>  <br>It was alright before shippuden yeah.</br>  <br> be Neji <br> be right about destiny <br> some punk-ass faggot claims you're wrong <br> decide to tag alone to show him you're actually right <br><br> 8 years and 600 chapters later <br> give up and just die, ain't nobody got time for this shit fuck everything <br> like 2 chapters later it turns out you were completely right all along <br>great going</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This exactly.</br>  <br> well animated and with good choregraphy <br> Naruto vs. Neji <br><br>You couldn't have picked a worse fight to mention along side your praise of the series' choreography.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy DARKNESS only because everytime it got pushed, Saskue got his ass handed to him.</br>  <br>If more filler had Shikamaru in it, the anime probably wouldn't be bad</br>  <br>Naruto was still kinda right thou, Neji used that argument to tell people who weren't good at things that they never would be and that they should just give up.</br>  <br>He never said Neji and Naruto's fight was well choreographed, you just wanted to find an excuse to use that .gif, dumbass.</br>  <br>Eh, Naruto was right in the generic "work hard, dont give up" sense but the faggot wasnt exactly some average Joe becoming great through perseverance or whatever.</br>  <br> mangareader </br>  <br>I never said that he said it. I was just pointing out the unfortunate juxtaposition.<br><br>And yes, I have literally gigabytes of retarded pics which I look for every opportunity to post. That's beside the point, however.</br></br></br>  <br>no, if the anime had more shikamaru, his character would have been ruined as badly as anyone else's in that filler-ridden hell</br>  <br>Fuuuuck Rock Lee should have been the main character. This should have been the main series.</br>  Shippuuden could have been a whole lot better without the Sasuke and Uchiha dickriding.  <br>This is probably the truth. I just need to show my appreciation for him since it's not often I get to do that.</br>  <br>Now all that's left to do is watch The Last and the Bort movie.</br>  <br> Rock Lee should have been the main character <br><br>I- yeah I have no objections to this</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> that .gif <br>You know the both of them ripped it off from an old kung fu movie, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You've got the scenes mixed up, the kung fu movie one was with Sasuke.</br>  <br>A series where Sakura is less austistic and goes for Lee instead of the sauce.</br>  <br>Rock Lee honestly should have gotten Sakura. He was the best person to her while Sasuke tried to kill her multiple times. Although he's too good for her anyway.</br>  <br>The whole reviving everyone thing was the point to drop it completely. It was just that bullshit.</br>  <br> watch <br>I haven't watched Naruto since 2008.<br><br>Subs for The Last are out, btw.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only said "watch" because those 2 movies are 100% canon.</br>  man... you guys hate on some stupid shit  Naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br><br>However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the Naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br><br>Naruto is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Naruto threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But we know Lee/Sakura will never happen because Kishimoto is a huge Saucefag.</br>    <br>Dear God you must truly hate this anime to your core,<br>did Natuto beat you and batter your mom when you were a child or something?</br></br>  <br>How new are you?</br>  <br> mangapanda <br> shitphone <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well did he??</br>  <br>still not getting any solid answers from you elite mangaproz</br>  If you never found Rock Lee cool, you're either a liar or full of shit. Or both.  <br> mangainn <br> mangapanda <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128695507 <br><br>It's a copypasta you fucking newfags. Having you in Naruto threads just makes Narutofags look worse.</br></br></br>  Hunter x Hunter is better    <br>Just admit Naruto threads nowadays are shit from the start.</br>  <br>Take it easy guy, its just the internet</br>  <br>Fuck off shitphonefag</br>    <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128695507 <br>AHHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHA, THIS PLACE IS FUCKING DEAD, THAT SHIT WAS IN A FUCKING BANNER FOR YEARS. SAVE US MOOT.</br></br>  <br>Naruto threads are the most civil as they've been for 8 years. You see how you can sit down comfortably right now? I still need to use a donuts after the horrible ass rapings we received for years on end.<br><br>There was a time that the chemo was so fervent that even One Piece would get blasted just for the crime of being in the same magazine.</br></br></br>    <br>Wich one is better? Rock lee vs Gaara or Ichigo vs Byakuya, they are very similar.</br>  <br>Ever since the mods decided to delete Naruto threads while keeping One Piece generals up, yeah.<br><br><br>You're embarrassing yourself, newfag.</br></br></br></br>    <br>10/10 - Hinata winning<br><br>The tears were delicious</br></br></br>  Thread got this far, and people still aren't discussing the plot of the new movie that was revealed.<br><br>Despite it being revealed just yesterday.</br></br>  <br>Incomplete projects get an F by deafult.</br>  <br>wrong</br>  <br>it was. <br><br>in the past couple of threads.</br></br></br>  <br>Lee v Gaara made you feel pretty hard at the end instead of having victory via evil mode, so I say it takes it</br>  <br> inb4 bait <br>Gaara vs Lee because at least initially the fight wasn't based on muh asspull powerups. <br> Byakuya talks up Bankai like it matters at this point <br> supposedly takes 1000 or so years to obtain, if at all <br> random-ass fake Shinigami gains it in days </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it was already discussed in some other Naruto thread.</br>  <br>This thread pretty much started out as b8. I'd be surprised if it survives the night.</br>  Oda praises Naruto, what now?<br><br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/05/<wbr>04/exclusive-eiichiro-oda-and-masas<wbr>hi-kishimoto-interview-from-naruto-<wbr>book-of-lightning/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Never forget</br>  <br>If there's one thing I liked about the original series is that power levels weren't all over the place. Besides the occasional Naruto taps into the Nine-tails, there were not really any asspulls.<br><br>Also Sasuke Retrieval Arc is the best of all time and Shikamaru was the best character.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Oda even has the time to read nardo <br>Literally just being polite.</br></br>  <br>Shikamaru will always be anti power levels<br><br>His son doesn't fall far from the tree, as Boruto despite having a lot of talent gets stuck against him pretty quickly.</br></br></br>  <br>Two shitty shounen authors, who cares?</br>  <br>If you enjoyed Naruto, it's because you're too young to have grown up with Dragonball Z, and that show had a LOT of problems. Naruto and shows like Naruto (like Bleach and One Piece and other "shonen" anime) are crap that people get invested in because they drag out story lines, making you invest more and more time into it until you get some kind of resolution. Then a new enemy appears, another carrot gets hung in front of your nose, and you go for it like a moron. Rinse and repeat. <br>Now, I can forgive a lot of this type of crap because there'll usually be some cool fight scenes or something ridiculous to make it worthwhile, but with Naruto, you're taking something cool (ninjas) and combining it with a bunch of insufferable children and terrible character designs (and that's saying a lot considering the other "shonen" I'm comparing this to).</br></br>  There's a "surprising" number of people who "hate" Shounen in this thread  <br> I'm so done. Like, so done. My soul has died. Is that what depression feels like? Holy mother of dragons. <br><br>Some of these comments are hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>I always appreciated the fact that Shikamaru got to be the only one to be promoted Chunin through his display of knowledge and skills even though there were people like Sasuke and Neji who at glance seem stronger.<br><br>I kind of hope Shikadai manages to beat Boruto in the Chunin exams in a similar fashion to his dad.</br></br></br>  <br> people get invested in because they drag out story lines <br>I'd argue that with Naruto and Bleach it's actually the opposite; suckering you into liking them immediately, then people without the ability or willingness to consume media critically can go an extraordinarily long time without noticing that the series they fell in love with has gone to shit.</br></br>  <br>I thought it was good until the 4th War arc. But the ending redeemed that all for me too so I have a pretty fond memory of the series. It was good for what it was as an entry level shonen.</br>  So is everyone in agreement that Naruto is a bad father?  <br> I kind of hope Shikadai manages to beat Boruto in the Chunin exams in a similar fashion to his dad <br>He wins, kinda.<br><br>Burrito cheats with a science device and daddy catches him, so he's disqualified.<br><br> Good thing, too. If he actually fought fairly Shikadai would probably be dead because invisible Rasengan is some shit. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bort pls</br>  <br>Shikadai wins<br><br> Boruto gets trapped by shadows briefly and tries to resort to cheating, his dad interrupts the match to disqualify him for cheating and Lee announces that Dai wins. Dadruto says he'll talk about this shit when they get home, Boruto says if Naruto had time to talk to him this wouldn't have happened in the first place. </br></br></br>  <br> 2/10 - Sasuke vs. Itachi <br><br>What? That was an actual good fight and the twist afterwards that Itachi was actually doing good was pretty hype too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No one cares, tumblrshits.</br></br>  <br>Are you going to use the scene in chapter 700 where he spends time with Boruto painting the Hokage mountain instead of going to the Kage meeting on time as the example?</br>  <br> twist afterwards that Itachi was actually doing good was pretty hype <br><br>this was about a big a twist as tobi = obito, friend</br></br></br>  <br>Oda and Kishi are best friends, and contrary to popular belief Naruto did have some well written parts at times.</br>  <br> Implying that there aren't people on /a/ right now who flipped their shit over Naruto pairings. <br><br>/a/ isn't as pure as you think.</br></br></br>  Naruto went to shit the instant it ran out of stuff to rip from HxH  <br> Itachi was actually doing good was pretty hype too. <br> mindfuck your bro into being the ultimate edgelord <br> good <br>fucking kishi</br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto did have some well written parts at times. <br>Yeah but don't tell anyone or you'll trigger shitposter-kun </br></br>  <br> Naruto did have some well written parts at times. <br>Yeah. It's just that later on he kind of shit on those same well written parts. <br><br>everything else was lifted from HxH.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't know about the movie <br> Burrito didn't throw the cake. nardo did, because he sent a clone to his daughter's birthday party and it popped. He also makes his son address him formally, neglects him to the point where getting his father's approval causes him to cry, and confiscates his headband in front of the entire ninja world because he cheated in the exams - which he only did so papa would notice him. Burrito even says that he'd be happy to receive a lecture since he'd actually be talking to him. </br></br>  <br>You saw all that coming? Kudos to you I guess. Tobi = Obito was blatant as hell after that Kakashi backstory was published but we had never really been shown the good side of Itachi until Sasuke's talk with Tobi.<br><br><br>Well Sasuke has always been an edgelord, it wasn't surprising to see him take his brother's intentions the wrong way, plus it was kinda necessary to get Naruto to save him since it was always his goal to rescue Sasuke.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No... no. It really wasn't very hype at all. The whole thing still relies upon retarded logic.<br><br> To prevent a "civil war" which will causes many people on both sides to die and which will make us seem weak in the eyes of the enemy nations and potentially provoke them to attack, we will per-emptively kill everyone on once side including non-combatants and tell the enemy nations that a single person did it during one night and wiped out the entirety of our most prestigious magic eyeball bloodlines. This will avoid death and not make us seem weak. </br></br></br>  <br>Other than the Chunin Exams mirroring Hunter Exams and Kurapika's revenge what else did he copy from HxH?</br>  <br> He also makes his son address him formally <br>Ha ha, he makes him call him "Hokage-sama"? What a douche.</br></br>  <br>It was good for one arc.</br>  <br>beginning 7/10<br>bell test 8/10<br>zabuza 9/10<br>chunnin prelims 7/10<br>Chunin finals + sand invasion 8/10<br>Itachi returns 6/10<br>Tsunade 5/10<br>Kakashi Mask 8/10<br>Get sasuke back 9/10<br>Filler bullshit 1/10<br><br>Shippuden beginning 7/10<br>Rescue gaara 8/10<br>Return of Sasuke 5/10<br>Ninja zombies and some guy named sora Filler - 1/10<br>Shikamaru vs hidan 8/10<br>3-tails and guren the crystal lady Filler- 3/10<br>Itachi pursuit 5/10<br>training and vs. pain 9/10<br>Naruto meeting cloud ninja 2/10<br>Kage meeting and Sasuke's infiltration 5/10<br>Turtle Island + naruto training 7/10<br>Ninja war - varies between fights but mostly 3/10<br>Obito reveal and fighing obito and madara - 5/10<br>Kaguya - 4/10 <br>Final Naruto vs Sasuke 9/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it wasn't necessarily clear earlier that the village put him up to it, but it was pretty clear all along that the uchiha were a bunch of treacherous if not outright evil fucks, and the constant goading about sauce needing more power/eye hacks was fishy from the moment it was revealed.</br>  <br>Bell Test / Ball Test<br>Weird mix of high-tech (dot-matrix computer displays) with a fantasy setting which was mostly dropped after the Chuunin Exams.<br>The "dangerous world" setting where society is okay with children competing in lethal tests, which was mostly a dropped after the Chuunin Exams.</br></br></br>  Wait so are there spoilers of the entire Boruto movie or was it just like a 30 min sneak peek kinda thing?  <br>Entire movie</br>  <br>Apparently the entire movie. Don't take internet word as law though.</br>   One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach have characters with connections to the moon   <br><br>Ah alright. How exactly does Boruto cheat with the device anyway?</br></br>  <br>Wave arc was good. Would have been better if the "elite genius" Sasuke had stayed dead from Haku, in order to show the real stakes of doing missions.<br>Chunin exams were also alright, but Sakura really should not have survived it. Her death would have shown kakashi to be a flawed teacher, as well as serious'd Naruto the fuck up. This would have made room for other, more interesting, characters.</br></br>  <br> and madara <br> -5 <br>Fuck you, nigga. He was the only enjoyable part about all that nonsense.</br></br></br>  <br> Weird mix of high-tech (dot-matrix computer displays) with a fantasy setting <br> The "dangerous world" setting where society is okay with children competing in lethal tests <br>Oh yeah because none of THOSE things were ever used before HxH</br></br></br>  <br> How exactly does Boruto cheat with the device anyway? <br>Apparently it allows the user to use any jutsu and all 5 elements excluding kekkei genkai, even if they aren't ninja.<br><br>nardo banned its use from the exams because muh hard work. A sleazy Jew talks Burrito into using it, even though he's only using him as a marketing gimmick.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>For some reason I added ''-" to certain arcs. Didn't mean to do that. <br><br>fighting obito and madara was 5/10 for me not -5</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that makes sense. I guess I was too young to realize it when first reading it like 7 years ago.</br>    <br> where society is okay with children competing in lethal tests <br>Only in ninja villages where it's there job to do that kind of shit. The population of Konoha is only a fraction of the population of the Fire Country.</br></br>  <br>Or at least it was. Nowadays nobody really knows how the politics of that world work.</br>  <br>Some Shill gives Boruto a device that can instant cast any jutsu without any effort automatically, trying to use Boruto to promote it because Naruto said they couldn't use that shit in the exams and morally he's a bit against it since it takes away any actual effort the kids might put into their training. It becomes the ultimate crutch that excuses them from ever learning.<br><br>People always scoff at this shit, but Naruto did put in a lot of training all through his life, he did work to get where he was before they started going "Destiny, destiny, fate fate" near the end of the manga.<br><br>When Boruto is caught cheating the shill jumps out on stage with cameras trying to shill harder about how this device can do anything.<br><br>This device could easily be worse than any human nuke. Anyone including non ninjas would be able to cast forbidden shit with ease with this bullshit, the world would start to see some problematic shit go down if this catches on. Naruto banned that shit in this case for a reason. <br><br>He's fine with Konohamaru using it to demonstrate various family techniques for the kids, but this guy is trying to shill it to say that hard work will never matter anymore and is pointless.<br><br>You can't use it during the exams, since its an entire point that you're supposed to be testing your own abilities, not the abilities of the machine. Its like bringing a calculator during your math exams.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that image  <br>You know something is bad when even the LOL SO RANDUMB AND KAWAII XD crowd is making fun of it.</br></br>  <br>Who is the Bleach one?</br>  The Kakashi vs. Obito fight was good. I never saw any of Shippuden besides that one 3 minute fight though.  I think it was pretty good up until the end of Zabuza arc  <br>It's still a pretty neat device though.<br><br> Also, a bunch of science assholes who got caught in Sauce's dimensional portal accidentally revive Momo by showering his corpse with ninjutsu, which he converts into chakra pills and eats to revive. </br></br></br>  <br>Damn, then again it is getting close to its official premiere date.</br>  <br>They're notable mainly in how they're similarities with H×H that were discarded simultaneously with the end of the Konoha Hunger Games.<br><br><br>You have to admit there was a sudden shift away from violent themes afterward. The Zabuza arc and the Chuunin Exams had major themes of a dangerous world. Afterwards, we got nothing but cop-outs, suicides, heart attacks, and Disney Deaths.<br><br>In comparison, Hunter × Hunter actually maintained a level of integrity.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Souds pretty solid.<br>Can agree with that, would give Sauce vs Best Boy bigger score though.<br><br>Still, can agree.</br></br></br></br>  <br> then again it is getting close to its official premiere date <br>You mean today?</br></br>    So honestly speaking is Shippuden even going to end? Or will they animate the novels too and even add in SoL filler?  <br>Which is why Naruto didn't ban it entirely, just during the exams for the most part.</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Do you think the US would be a world power if we banned nukes? Even if we don't use them, everyone else will. Naruto is literally setting his village back decades.<br><br><br><br>According to the spoilers I read, Bolt uses the gauntlet to preload Mass Shadow Clones. Then Naruto punishes him for cheating. Which is retarded, because it's not like Bolt can't use Shadow Clones naturally.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything ends, anon.</br>  <br>oh I meant to say its nationwide release which is in August.</br>  People say it went to shit when the exam arc started but really it was during the tail end of it. The series had some good ideas and some solid characters but the plot got way too convoluted and went entirely in the wrong direction. <br><br>Fight at the waterfall was cool though and Tsunade was hot.</br></br>  <br>I saw it when I was like 13 and it first came to toonami<br><br>it was neat, all about being sneaky and shit<br><br>but after a certain point it stopped being clever and turned into dragon ball Ninjas</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Afterwards, we got nothing but cop-outs, suicides, heart attacks, and Disney Deaths <br>You have no idea how refreshing it is to learn that nardo and his son actually straight-up murder the big bag in the movie. No TnJ, no sob story. Just vaporize the fucker.</br></br>  <br>    Momo <br>Who</br></br>  <br>Seeing how much money SP made off of THE LAST box office, and BD sales will be released later tonight you can bet they'll keep making more Nardo. I've seen THE LAST constantly go out of stock on Amazon, I'm kinda excited to see how much it will sell.</br>  <br>Ninjas are essentially mercenaries but are (supposed to be) loyal to their village, and the village is loyal to their country's Daimyo.<br>But apparently the ninjas are also the country's standing army?</br></br>  <br> Which is retarded, because it's not like Bolt can't use Shadow Clones naturally <br>Shadow Clone =! Mass Shadow Clone<br><br>He also uses the Raiton we see in the trailer and a Suiton during the 2nd portion, but nobody catches on.<br><br>He's a real cheating son of a bitch, or in other words, a sneaky ninja.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That seems broken as fuck, I'm not surprised by it being banned. <br><br>Boruto's power levels are already pretty high compared his classmates. How was he convinced to use it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Says the tumblrshit </br>  <br> Which is retarded, because it's not like Bolt can't use Shadow Clones naturally. <br><br>You're not getting the whole crutch aspect<br><br>Bolt is already a genius nin, he didn't really need to use this shit, yet he still did because he wanted to guarnatee the result in a panic when he could have fought hard to secure it himself with his own power.<br><br>He had all the ability naturally, but when push came to shove he used a crutch rather than putting the work in on his own. Yes he can already use shadow clones, but he still ended up using this for a reason. If you have the means to do it easily, compared to having to work out the problem on your own with math, you might sometimes cheat even if you don't need to do it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was alright up until the mass resurrection at the end of the Pain Arc. Coincidentally, that's around the time where I dropped the series wholesale.<br><br>Lucky me, huh?</br></br>  <br>Bolt used the gauntlet while captured by the Shadow Binding.<br>Naruto noticed something was off and Hinata confirmed it with her Byakugan.</br></br>  <br>I also saw it from Toonami. I followed it much further into the series. What really turned off was the raw amount of filler was disgusting. Hundreds of episodes of filler. After the filler before shippuden I swapped over to the anime. What I liked about it was that people died all the time, important characters that never would return, however when they started magically bringing everyone back to life thats when I quit because it was a bunch of garbage that people could just die and be reborn again effortlessly</br>  <br>Shill approaching him and giving it to him under some false pretenses.<br><br>Naruto praises Boruto when he hears he passed the first part of the exam, so he holds onto the cheat device because he wants the attention. If he keeps winning then dad will keep looking at him for now.<br><br>It sound one sided here or there, but the movie does give a feeling for both Naruto and Boruto's view points here. Both of them have some meaning why they did what they did, even if they both fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How was he convinced to use it? <br>Jew-kun preyed on his fear of disappointing his father. Which sounds silly, I know. After all, he's a genius prodigy.<br><br>Problem is all the faggots around him never give him his dues because he's the son of nardo, so he's expected to be God's gift to the world.<br><br>Couple that with his already shaky relationship with his dad and you can see why he took the bracelet even if he didn't really need it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hurr durr u have to earn it for yourself <br>Meanwhile, every other village is going to start training their kids with ninja gauntlets from age 4. The Leaf is going to send their kids out with nothing but hard work against enemies their age who are able to create tsunamis and level forests.</br></br>  <br> Lucky me, huh? <br><br>Nah, sounds like you were just so put off by that plot twist that you assumed everything after is shit, and feel you're still entirely in the right without wanting to look into it, because "Surely I'm right"<br><br>Final arc is definitely worth seeing for a few reasons, like Madara.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why don't we love Tsunade?  <br> Implying the other Kages arn't faggots like Nardo. <br>You know they are.</br></br>  <br>Not to mention you have to ask yourself how these retarded no magic plebs are in charge when Madara could casually pick up the continent and drop it on their heads. <br><br>How are these fuckers mercenaries and not running the show? It makes no sense. <br><br>Furthermore, if the ninja are all descendants of moon MILF, then where did the normies come from?<br><br>The more you think about it the less sense it makes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   214 replies   <br>If you cut out the filler it is decent</br>  <br>It got progressively worse afterwards, by orders of magnitude. Terrorist Darkness-is-too-Strong I-Have-Canonical-Brain-Damage Sasuke was painful to read. The Great Ninja War was as Part 1 and Part 2 up to the Mass Resurrection, and it was just... so much stupid shit. Too much to quantify.<br><br>And the end? Complete clusterfuck.</br></br></br>  Has Viz announced a theatrical release date for Boruto?  <br>dyslxeia conifrmed<br>its 241 repiles</br></br>  <br>why not just skip the filter?<br><br>doesn't the filler start at like episode 120 then from there to 220 its just nothing but filler then shippuden starts?</br></br></br>  <br>too old</br>  <br>If you take away the guantlet from enemy ninjas, they'll be weak shits who have never trained a proper jutsu in their lives and can't do shit on their own without their iphone's working as a calculator for them.<br><br>Its a generation where no one is going to know what to do the second you take their device away, they wouldn't have trained worth shit because they have something to rely on entirely like this.<br><br>If you teach leaf ninja to simply disable the enemy gauntlet, then effectively the enemy will have lost out right there because they're that shit relying on it.<br><br>Also the other villages aren't enemies anymore. They have regular meetings of friendship and are keeping togetherness between the villages as the highest priority in the new world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A clusterfuck would imply you could not follow the plot. The plot was very easy to follow, it was just very stupid.</br>  <br> implying this sort of technology isn't posing a danger to the whole power structure of the world <br> implying in a society of people whose economy depends on secrecy and assassination the scientists and all devices would not get disappeared incredibly quickly <br><br>As for the cheating angle, think of it this way: Bolt managed to smuggle a gun into a martial arts competition, and people are upset he is disqualified when it is discovered he uses it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I came back and checked it out after I heard about The Last. <br><br>I was right. I'm hopeful for the new gen, though. Might take a few good years to ruin them. <br><br><br>He only banned them from the exams, not wholesale. At least I don't think. Honestly it'd be a great support tool in an emergency. Cast a few freebies while you use the rest of your chakra intelligently.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even better that some of those replies are from people who want this thread to die</br>  <br> Also the other villages aren't enemies anymore. They have regular meetings of friendship and are keeping togetherness between the villages as the highest priority in the new world. <br>Yeah, the Big Five. The little villages are still probably fuming at their lack of representation.</br></br>  <br>Yes but that would actually take effort since I would have to look up what episodes are filler.<br><br>And it sucks when an episode is 90% flashbacks but there are one or two new important scenes in the episode.</br></br></br>  <br> Not to mention you have to ask yourself how these retarded no magic plebs are in charge <br>The position might be hereditary considering there general incompitence<br> How are these fuckers mercenaries and not running the show <br>Loyalty to Royalty?<br> Furthermore, if the ninja are all descendants of moon MILF <br>They're not, Tony Romo just gave everyone the ability to use chakra</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure someone has done it and you can just google it.</br>  <br>Fair enough. The Itachi Massacre retcon is a clusterfuck, but I guess in this case we were all too aware of every stupid thing that was occurring.</br>  <br>Why are Oda's emotional faces so shit?</br>  <br> Meanwhile, every other village is going to start training their kids with ninja gauntlets from age 4 <br>Forget that. In a world where any old pleb can suddenly cast a fireball, who needs ninjas? Get a couple thousand of the fuckers, put 'em in a straight line and tell them to bomb the everloving fuck out of whatever's on the other side. <br><br><br>Shizune is better.</br></br></br></br></br>  The filler arc is great and one of the best parts of the series.  Only time I'd say Naruto is good is when someone else praises SAO, I'd tell them Naruto is better than that shit.  <br> How are these fuckers mercenaries and not running the show? It makes no sense. <br>The best speculative answer to that is that they don't think it's worth the effort. Better keep the muggles 'free' and happily powering the economy so there's plenty of opportunities for them to make dosh hand over fist and have far more comforts when not on missions than your average peasant ploughing the rice field.</br></br>  <br>Oh, you poor, poor thing. Better not check the archives. There's dozens upon dozens of archived threads all about Nurudu. <br><br>And that's just in this month alone.</br></br></br>  Holy shit : I just realized WHY Boruto likes Sasuke as a master.<br><br>He doesn't treat Boruto like hot shit or expects him to be a prodigy. Sarada has to basically argue Boruto's part just so Sasuke will stay his master.</br></br>  <br><br>I see. It's kind of like pottery where he's the opposite of Naruto coming into the Chunin exams. Naruto had nothing to lose and everything to prove and he was at the bottom of the barrel. Burrito fears for proving himself in front of his father to get his attention and he's the prodigy of his class.<br><br>Kind of shitty of him to take it but then again his relationship with his dad is pretty shitty as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br> this little shithead kid went to the moon and fucked the bustiest chick in his village <br>Not gonna lie I just saw The Last and it made me feel</br></br>  <br>What exactly stops these people with guantlets from loading their beyblade yugioh card launchers full of really big jutsu and sneaking up on the hidden leaf village like a casual user and literally flipping the entire mountain and the village and the wall over on its head?</br>  <br>Worked slightly better when it was actually Oda drawing it. I think it's supposed to be a little fucked up and disturbing.</br>   Naruto actually fucked a vagina <br> For hours </br>  <br> Also the other villages aren't enemies anymore. They have regular meetings of friendship and are keeping togetherness between the villages as the highest priority in the new world <br>You mean like Kumo, who were spending their "peacetime" building a doomsday weapon and neglected to tell the other nations about it?</br></br>  <br>Maybe you shouldn't check the archives because it is all about you getting wrecked, Narutard.</br>  <br>kek, sounds like iraq<br><br> no guys I swear we aren't building nukes, just making free cheap electricity! </br></br></br>   Bee fucking DIES <br><br>Poor Bee, well hopefully his little halfie son will make a good container.</br></br>  <br> Sarada has to basically argue Boruto's part just so Sasuke will stay his master <br>It's a good thing she was stalking them and happened to notice the massively overpowered invisible Rasengan Burrito used.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck<br>No fuck this you're trolling me this isn't real<br>Wu tang forever</br></br></br>  <br>Who cares if they die, dieing stopped mattering after they brought everyone back to life and dead and back to life again</br>  <br>We don't really know the specifics of how the thing works, muggles/Lee might be incapable of using it.<br>Also it's a well established system whereas the device is clearly something new.<br>Should there be a revolution of some sort (Why against the ninjas anyway? If anyone's doing any oppressing it is the feudal lords and samurai.) you still have plebs with all the reflexes and aim of an out-of-job accountant, downtrodden peasant or highwayman, so power or no they would get fucking obliterated.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just another weapon, which will ultimately be useless against a trained ninja if you aren't one.<br>So what if you can now toss fireballs? You're not as fast, strong, or stealthy as a shinobi.</br></br>  <br> Forget that. In a world where any old pleb can suddenly cast a fireball, who needs ninjas? <br>Sure, for basic protection or traditional warfare. You still need ninja for covert sneaking operations.</br></br>  <br>Nigger, this entire goddamn movie is pottery. Pretty pottery. Well-made pottery, but pottery none the less.</br>  <br>He's alive in the epilogue.</br>  <br>Doesn't take a trained shooter to fire off a cannon</br>  <br> he fucked it enough to get not one but two kids  <br><br><br>If I'm wrecked then how is this thread still up?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love that sexy obaa-chan. She's serious when she needs to be and sweet when she wants to be.</br>  Man Naruto, you can TnJ a fucking Uchia out of going DARKNESS but you can't spend enough time with your kids to make sure they don't develop fucked up complexes about you.  <br> die <br>Nigger, please. Momo probably ripped out 99% percent of that shit and B used the excuse to go start a rap group.</br></br>   All these people who were hyped about Kakashi's face <br><br> No one genuinely interested in how Tsunade really looks after all the toll Mitotic Regeneration took on her body <br><br>I know she'll probably look really ugly and wrinkled as hell judging by the few panels we got of her arms but I still want to see what she looked like.</br></br></br></br>  <br> kek </br>  <br>Do you know how to operate a cannon?</br>  Isn't there supposed to be an announcement in a day or so? Do you think they're going to announce  more Burrito ?  <br>sorry I forgot the precursor<br><br>tippy top shelf kekaroony toony</br></br></br>  <br>They were fine until he became Hokage.</br>  <br> Do you think they're going to announce more Burrito? <br>It's on the 7th and goddammit  I kinda hope they do. </br></br>  Hey can any one tell me if this is a good idea, I watched the original naruto series up to like episode 90ish but got bored. I still want to experience the series however, I'm thinking about reading the manga and then looking on   youtube   for the fight scenes. Either that or skip around in the anime. What do you guys think?  <br>same way you operate a musket</br>  <br>    He also makes his son address him formally <br>I rather like that bit and wish there was more drama founded on something feasible for the characters.<br>It makes perfect sense for Naruto to demand proper decorum, yet he forgets that Bolt is fundamentally similar to him and how he used to treat both Hokages at his age.<br>Bolt, especially if he heard of his dad's antics, would think that this is stupid and nothing but parading authority to distance him further, feeding into his butthurt over Naruto having to spend so much less time with his family since having become Hokage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that the "secret" thing? Where are they revealing that at?</br>  <br> halfie son <br>please, anon, that kid looks like an octoroon at most</br></br>  <br>just read the encyclopedia dramatica version of it. Its way more entertaining</br>  <br>Do you know how to properly operate a musket?</br>  <br> Naruto (also referred to as "Ninja Brokeback Mountain") is an animu about sand ninjas and eugenics. It is a gateway anime of the worst kind riddled with one-dimensional characters who lack development, poor pacing, numerous plot holes, shitty villains who "aren't really so bad in the end", an anime saturated in filler arcs, a final arc with a complicated mess of a plot that stretched on for a year, massive use abuse of plot armor to cover up shitty writing, and a story of "friendship" which somehow makes Boku No Pico look like Metal Gear Solid in comparison. Despite this, it is one of /a/'s guilty pleasures due to being a massive lolcow which has provided them with lulz for 15 years. The story is about a blonde-haired, afro hairstyled, blue-eyed, half-emo, foreigner half-demon ninja teen struggling to be accepted into society by being a whiny faggot who annoys everyone around him, including the viewers. His goal is to become Hokage Ninja Obama and change the world. To accomplish this he becomes a ninja who dresses in bright colors, doesn't into stealth, announces his presence to his enemies, literally only uses 2 jutsus for the entirety of the series, forgives mass murderers, and rather than killing enemies would rather give gay speeches about bonds and friendship and other shit. In fact, He is such a failure of a ninja that the plot replaced him with Sasuke "Edge-Lord" Uchiha as the main character halfway through the story due to Kishimoto's boner for his favorite character. One of the many themes in Naruto that are ultimately ignored is that hard work surpasses talent which is shown in how Naruto and Sasuke become the most overpowered characters by having perfect bloodlines and literally being handed power ups while characters like Rock Lee are ultimately forgotten by the plot. Great writing there, Kishimoto! Another lesson Naruto teaches is that if you stalk someone long enough, they will change their mind about you and will run back into your arms. </br>  <br> Considering that the entire lolcow of a fanbase is full of basement dwelling beta-male autists whose last encounter with a real vagina was during their birth and obese 16 year old fangirls who devote their entire lives to their OTPs, It's easy to see why Naruto has managed to last as long as it did by appealing to autistic weeaboos. All 700 fucking chapters of this shit.  <br><br> Legend has it that there may actually be female characters in this series. However, closer investigation has proven that most female characters either tend to be useless or dead. One example is Tenten, a character so useless that the anime was thankful enough to show her fighting, just so they can create filler space (Which they already do with Hinata). It should also be noted that this anime has no actual Japanese martial arts or anything even related to actual ninjas. The final irony is despite being THE anime of choice for edgy 13 year olds, no matter how many fansubs insert the words "Fuck" or "Damn," Naruto is still A FUCKING KID'S SHOW. <br><br>According to press reports, Naruto is "a cartoon about Arabs on television."[1] <br><br> 13 years before the absolute failure of a plot begins, a nine-tailed fox appeared and caused Ninja 9/11. The 4th Hokage, who was later revealed to be Naruto's father (whoops, should have put a spolier on that too), sealed the fox into his son, killed himself in the process , and turned Naruto into an otherkin that had a demon fox inside him. Naruto, like all furries, was hated by his village due to being an unholy abomination. Like that one annoying kid you knew who didn't get the hint and an hero, Naruto decided that by trolling the village he could get people to pay attention to him and accept him.. Eventually he passed his Ninja exams through nepotism by his teacher who taught him the value of friendship™ and becomes a ninja. It is from there that the plot goes downhill. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It makes perfect sense for Naruto to demand proper decorum <br>What the fuck? No, it doesn't. Naruto is the most flippant, disrespectful guy in the series. He called Jiraiya erosennin. He called Tsunade old lady even after she became Hokage.<br><br>It makes no sense for him to require Bolt to refer to him formally.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Some shit happens where Naruto makes a badass ninja with a giant sword cry like a little bitch and then Orochimaru causes the 2nd Ninja 9/11 during the chuunin exams and kills the third hokage. Afterwards Jiraiya takes Naruto to go find Tsunade so she could become hokage for some reason and Sasuke goes full emo when his brother (who caused the Uchiha equivalent of the Holocaust) comes back to the village to try to kidnap Naruto. Orochimaru offers him free candy and Sasuke decides to leave the village but not before he tells Sakura to get back in the kitchen and knocks her the fuck out. Naruto, Shikamaru, and a few other popular characters team up to bring him back but end up failing. Not getting the fucking hint, and in an attempt to finally get into Sakura's cherry blossom, he promises to bring Sasuke back to the village. He then leaves with Jiraiya to have buttsex for three years. </br>  <br>It's weird. In fact Sauce is the one without the stick up his ass if you can believe it or not. He TnJs Burrito and tells nardo to calm down while they're fighting Momo. He also has a few touching moments - with his daughter. <br><br>I'll tell ya it's going to be fucking weird to see Sasuke acting like a decent human being again.</br></br></br>  <br> Only makes friends with children. Best friend is childish around him. <br>Sasuke is a child in a man's body. Probably did not like sex at all.</br></br>  <br>In case you haven't noticed anon nardo's kind of a dick in this movie.</br>  <br> Sasuke is a child in a man's body </br>  <br> Sasuke is literally ninja Micheal Jackson <br>Oro was a red herring all along</br></br>  <br> Oro was a red herring all along <br>Well no shit. Because Orochimaru is Mitsuki's  mother. </br></br>  <br>Sasuke's being a good dad now because he got a reality check and realized "FUCK I NEED TO BECOME DAD OF THE YEAR ASAP BECAUSE SHE'S A TICKING TIME BOMB LIKE ALL UCHIHA"</br>  <br> Ctrl+F nardo <br> 9 matches </br></br>  <br>Did you read the rest of my post? That's my point exactly. <br>He probably doesn't think about it and does not want to seem like he's favouring him over the others, but at the same time fails to remember how he used to be at that age. It is important to show both sides contributing to the problem that will ultimately be resolved.<br>If the tension was made over character-based stuff like this rather than manufactured bullshit inconsistent with either the characters or their capabilities (cake, plot jutsu device), the movie would be looking a lot better.</br></br></br>  <br> FUCK I NEED TO BECOME DAD OF THE YEAR ASAP BECAUSE SHE'S A TICKING TIME BOMB LIKE ALL UCHIHA <br>It's okay. Salad's all over Burrito's nuts and bolts in the movie anyway. <br><br>It's the grandkid he needs to worry about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is so adorable looking.<br>Plus with his parent being Orochimaru, he will give great head.</br></br>  <br>You can tell which parts were heavily influenced by Kishi and which had the co-writer. <br><br>Granted, the deeper, character-driven stuff might go over the heads of the target audience so I give it a pass.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, that's why he's also trying to keep Boruto is check.<br><br>Sasuke saw a fucking nuclear holocaust if that fight escalated and was probably grateful space aliens came.<br><br>Cause can you imagine what would happen if Boruto left the village?<br><br> I MUST EXECUTE THE HOKAGE FOR BORUTO </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    When you think about it, Sasuke doesn't know shit about families.<br>He's doing his best with Sakura and Sarada by acting how he thinks Fugaku and Itachi would act.</br>  <br> He is so adorable looking <br>I guess. If you're into creepy pale alien-looking snekbois.</br></br>  <br> Probably did not like sex at all. <br><br>I laugh when I think of this. Sakura probably begged the fuck out of him to fuck her, and he just did for like 2 seconds and left to go mope in the forest.</br></br></br>  <br> but at the same time fails to remember how he used to be at that age <br>And yet he's able to see that hypocrisy in other people.</br></br>  <br>Tells them to fuck off/mind their own business?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7_T<wbr>TiAO2LOM#t=28</wbr>  [ ]  Which character had the most wasted potential?<br><br>Sakura or Sasuke?</br></br>  <br>It's kinda weird to see Sauce being the positive influence on Burrito and Nurudu being the negative. Weird, yet at the same time, oddly refreshing. <br><br>Also it's a relief(?) to know that Burrito idolizes the former as opposed to the latter, and doesn't want to be Hokage at the end of the movie. Instead he wants to be Batman.</br></br></br>  <br>Shino</br>  <br/>   being forced to take your grandfather's killer's son as your student <br><br>What did Naruto have to do to let Konohamaru accept this?</br></br>  <br>I still think the only possible scenarios are him giving Sakura a turkey baster/full vial and telling her to make it work, or Sakura going even more off the rails, spiking his tomato juice ad raping him while he is confused and scared. The latter would also explain why he made up a bullshit mission to be on for the next 12 years.</br>  <br>Sakura. <br><br>Sasuke got too much screentime and reached his potential. <br>Sakura was at least hinted to be a Genjutsu-type but zero got done with that. Plus she never really got any better personality-wise. <br>She is at her best when written by anyone but Kishi. <br>She wasn't shit-tier in The LAST or the novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Shippuden <br><br>Is this some kind of new meme?</br></br>  <br>I think his job has overtaken him somewhat. In 700 he's still the same old nardo, but the movie takes place several years later. He's become stressed out and more irritable due to the workload (even though he has a million fucking clones to do shit for him). Constantly butting heads with his son hasn't made things any easier.</br>  <br>Meh, the Third had a hard on for Orochimaru, even in death.</br>  <br>Nothing. Konohamaru is trying to take after Naruto and Naruto is Ninja Jesus. <br><br>Konohamaru could have had Orochimaru, Kabuto and Mitsuki as his genin team and he still would have taken it in stride.</br></br></br>  <br>But Konohamaru isn't him. He isn't as fucking retarded as him.</br>  <br>Well it happens to the best of us.<br>And really, expecting proper decorum from a kid with a normal upbringing and loving family is a little bit different from giving the poor orphan with extremely few genuinely positive human relationships some leeway when it comes to protocol.</br></br>  <br> implying anyone knows <br>Apparently Mitsuki just showed up for class one day at the academy and the rest is history.<br><br>Speaking of Konohamaru, poor guy's also responsible for nardo Jr: more edge edition, the Uchiha fucking shit who wants to take his dream from him, and the aforementioned spawn of grandpa's murderer.</br></br></br></br>  where does all the smoke come from when they do their big tricks?  <br>The smoke machines placed off-set by the crew. It's all a show.</br>  <br>It was good until the war.</br>  <br> has to listen to a kid who looks like his idol trash talk him all day <br> has to listen to a kid who keeps spouting that she will take his dream from him <br> has to look constantly look at kid who is the son of his grandpa's killer <br><br>Truly a fate worse than 1010</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it was fun for awhile. I would say the first 5 episodes were great. The next 12 episodes were good. The next 70 episodes were fair. The rest was trash.</br>  <br>And now they're all becoming horny teens with super powers.</br>  <br>He probably gets on well with Bolt due to some degree of character-similarity, like Kakashi did with Sasuke. Sarada is a nice girl and it would take effort not to get on with her, whereas Mitsuki seems to basically be Sai Jr. in terms of behaviour because Kishi cannot write a less edgy Sauce.</br>  <br> judging by the anime <br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>Konohamaru will only have to worry about Sarada if the current Daimyo and his council die before Naruto retires.</br>  <br>Nina Quantum Magic.</br>  <br> because Kishi cannot write a less edgy Sauce <br> who is Burrito <br><br>Anyway, I always preferred Sai as far a teammates go so I'm happy. Has more comedic potential and Burrito is his good buddy instead of a bitchy girlfriend who constantly compares him to her ex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And the first 5 episodes were trash. You're retarded if you think the Zabuza arc was worse than that</br>  <br> Imfuckingplying Naruto isn't already stacking the stack in Sarada's favor as some form of Ninja Social justice </br>  <br> has to listen to a kid who looks like his idol trash talk him all day <br>I wonder what happens to Burrito though, if the rest became Chuunin while he's still a Genin. Or Academy student. Depends on how far they set him back for cheating.<br><br>Or maybe they gave him the promotion because he managed to kill a fucking god and has the scars to prove it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>True. His credentials are unmatched as far as nepotism goes</br>  <br>It's alright.<br>Sarada will become the 8th but die to giving birth to Kaguya 2.0<br>Konohamaru can then take over and be the 9th.<br>Hiruzen was the 3rd, and Kakashi was the 6th, so it makes sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto was God ninja jesus and they never promoted him.<br><br>You have to pass the test anon, no cheating</br></br></br>  <br>Well now she's got his son in her corner who could always introduce a "change" in management if they refuse to give her the job.</br>  <br>I'm sure as hell not going to read a manga for a show that isn't very good.</br>  <br> I'm sorry in the past the Senju hated the Uchiha. Let me make it up to your clan by making your life easier for you. </br>  <br>We don't know exactly what happens to the rest of the team. Fair to say they might not get promoted either.</br>  <br>Reading the manga is much quicker than watching the show.</br>  <br>Well shit. I feel sorry for whoever has to face him in the redo. After all, everyone knows Konoha gets one good batch of Genin a generation and he formerly at the head of that batch.<br><br>Maybe they'll impose a ban on his invisible flying electric murder balls.</br></br></br>  <br>Do we know why he can make the Rasengan invisible? Does it have something to do with lightning?</br>  <br>The first 5 episodes were the best part of the entire show. It was a comedy about a fuck up with one good skill that used it to turn into hundreds of naked chicks.<br><br>Then it turned into 'the demon inside me BURNS' which was ok I guess. Then it turned into dozens of episodes of 'gotta kill kids, gotta kill kids, gotta kill kids' and the humor was all gone but at least it was mildly entertaining, then it became trash.</br></br></br>  <br>It'd definitely fit the Yin/Yang pottery and the Kushina/Minato pottery. <br><br><br>Salad annihilates her jobber opponent and Mitsuki likely performs similarly. They probably passed. <br><br>Anyway, even if Burrito stays a Genin this time it won't last long. Hopefully he gets matched up with Metal in the next one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oda can't drawn for shit.</br>  <br>Reading manga sucks. I'll only do it if there's no adaptation available.</br>  <br>Funny how autistic Kishi is about small, incredibly stupid details like that.<br>I mean okay, there was no time for it in the main story and it was never really about rank. It is retarded but whatever. <br>But then it comes to The Last two years later, with Naruto already giving guest lectures in the Academy and being the very best asset of the village, yet Kishi is adamant that he's STILL a genin, on the same fucking rank as raw greenhorns while perfectly capable of taking out the five Kage by himself. <br>Would it have hurt to give the guy an offscreen promotion to chuunin or jounin?</br></br></br></br>  <br>See, that's the thing. Some reliable sources have said that he pulls off a Raiton Rasengan first try with Konohamaru and Sauce thinks it's a dud until Salad points out the obvious. <br><br>It makes sense. A normal Rasengan would never have those properties. However, when he throws it in the trailer, it looks completely normal. Unless those people just guessed that it had Raiton, but that seems unlikely.<br><br>I guess we'll have to wait for the second pre-screening tonight for answers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop spouting bullshit. It was no comedy, it was some intro episodes and that's it.</br>  <br>Wasn't he promoted to Jonin between 699 and The Last?</br>  <br> Funny how autistic Kishi is about small, incredibly stupid details like that <br>Not to mention they all should have gotten a promotion for taking out fucking Gaara and Shukaku, thus saving the village from being t-bagged by a sandcastle. <br><br>But nope. Genin. Oh well. Just further evidence that the Chuunin Exams, while entertaining, are a terrible metric for discerning who and who should not progress.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto is a lazy fuck, he probably didn't want to become a Jonin yet because that would mean too much work.<br><br>He's a teenager remember that. And he was not going to be hokage until a long while since Kakashi was there</br></br></br>  <br> However, when he throws it in the trailer, it looks completely normal <br>Maybe it's another ruse like when they gave a regular Raiton Chidori sound effects.</br></br>  <br>If beating your opponent was the sole requirement, Naruto would have had that jacket at 12. Come to think of it it could have worked out fairly well for the forming team dynamics and Sausage's butthurt.<br>Hell, it's entirely possible that due to the moon people's attack the exam is cancelled and no one gets a promotion, try again in 6 months.</br></br>  <br> Naruto is a lazy fuck <br>He's the hardest worker.</br></br>  <br>They do say that promotions are not only about being powerful, they're about being intelligent.<br><br>There's a reason Shikamaru lost and still got promoted, at least try to inform yourself</br></br></br>  <br>We never do find out, even if it is probable he was eventually made a Jonin, as he took the Kage position in his late twenties/early thirties.</br>  <br>After Lee.</br>  <br>Training, and that's rock lee.<br><br>One thing is training the other is doing missions. I'm sure he was tired after fighting bunny goddess and wanted a break</br></br></br>  <br> Hell, it's entirely possible that due to the moon people's attack the exam is cancelled and no one gets a promotion, try again in 6 months <br>Maybe. Although the final match does actually end this time with Burrito winning, then being disqualified, then Shikadai winning. <br><br>Either way, it's a pointless detail. The kid could still wipe out any Chuunin in the village and that shit never had any real effect on their lives anyway. They were all Chuunin in Shippuden and what did that change?<br><br>Honestly, I wouldn't mind if they sent Genin Burrito with the Chuunin kids or even Jonins because he's OP as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I actually took preference for the anime mostly because of the OST and some OP/ED that are really fucking good. Aside that the anime is full of QUALITY moments and also has the infuriating tendency of dumping a lot of unimportant and repetitive introspects in the middle of fights just to make the episodes longer. Also, the fillers are shit. Except that one about Kakashi's face.</br></br>    <br>Let's be honest, anon. That's bullshit.</br>  <br>Shikamaru does not allow clones.</br>  <br>Naruto could wipe any chunnin and a lot of Jonin when he was 12.<br><br>Hell, If he had summoned gamabunta he would have stomped Sasuke in the end of part 1</br></br></br>  <br>Oh God I forgot about her. She looks retarded, but fuckable. I guess.</br>  <br>I'm sure he had a few weeks of time out while recovering from losing his fucking arm.<br> I'd love to see some little bits of Hinata visiting him in the hospital, going beet red trying to feed him while he is dense as fuck about the whole thing. <br>After that, though, he would probably be busy as fuck with missions, at least diplomatic stuff.</br></br></br>  <br> Several years later <br>Source? I thought it was the same. I mean, 1 year or 2 max</br></br>  <br> Hell, If he had summoned gamabunta he would have stomped Sasuke in the end of part 1 <br>Actually, why didn't he do that again?</br></br>  <br>Because it was personal and would've been overkill?</br>  <br>no its not moron. its most popular anime</br>  <br> Source? <br>Common sense, anon. In 700 nardo was recently promoted and Bort was still in the academy and looked around 7-8 ish.<br><br>In Gaiden he's 12-13 and the movie takes place several months later.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you want to see that? Also he probably healed in like a day. He could regenerate a hole through his chest in less than a second, he rested and healed by the other day when Kurama was fine again.</br>  <br> and would've been overkill? <br>Not really. All he'd have to do is tell Gama not to squash his friend and restrain him so he can beat the DARKNESS out of him and drag his ass back to the village.</br></br>  <br>Because them he'd have won and taken the edgelord back to the village where he would have been hanged for treason.</br>  Zabuza and Rock Lee vs Gaara were the high points of the show.<br>Also the soundtrack.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure someone said that the only new Jounin in The Last was Sakura. Plus, in After the Last, Naruto is obviously still getting a Genin's salary.</br></br>  <br>Because plot.<br><br><br>Stop spouting shit.<br><br>Big 3 was Naruto, OP, Bleach. There's no other big three, not even in Shonen Jump.<br><br>It was a name given only to them, it's not a title for the 3 most popular manga of any time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently he wears those bandages as a reminder of Sauce or something. It's gay as fuck.<br><br> And the movie ends with Burrito and nardo doing a fistbump with their bandaged hands before heading their separate ways. </br></br></br>  <br>The missions you complete dictates how much you earn, not your rank.<br>Jiraiya is easily a millionaire because of how many S-rank missions he took along with his book series.</br></br>  <br> uses it to see her broke ass boyfriends wallet <br> uses it to see her son cheating in the exams <br>At least she's getting her money's worth.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair if nardo (and now his son) demanded compensation for their services they'd bankrupt the Fire Country.<br><br>Keeping them as Genin for as long as possible would be the most financially solvent move.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure she uses it on penis inspection day to make sure Bolt is practicing good hygiene.</br>   haven't watched naruto in over 10 years <br> go to watch it <br> find a dub <br> naruto's voice <br><br>jesus fucking christ</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> watching the dub </br>  <br> Jiraiya is easily a millionaire <br><br>LOOK AT ALL THOSE ZEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOES</br></br></br>  <br>I youtubed it where I thought I left off</br>  <br> implying 12 year old nardo could count past 6 </br>  <br>Stop teasing me with things that will never happen, anon.</br>  <br>He never really took his education seriously so probably.</br>  Isn't it sad that Sarada and Boruto are already better written than NH and SS were together and have an actual basis than retarded onesided crush?  <br>1 Ryo = 10 Yen<br>D-Rank = 5,000 to 50,000 ryo<br>C-Rank = 30,000 to 100,000 ryo<br>B-Rank = 150,000 to 200,000 ryo<br>A-Rank = 150,000 to 1,000,000 ryo<br>S-Rank = 1,000,000+ ryo<br><br>  Naruto has completed 16 official missions in total: 7 D-rank, 1 C-rank, 2 B-rank, 6 A-rank, 0 S-rank.  <br>Assuming he received maximum compensation for each mission (One of the D-Rank missions was retrieving the Fire Daimyo's wife's pet), the total amount of money he accumulated over his career before the war would 6,850,000 (68,500,000 yen), which would currently be 554,456.13 USD</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably highballing those numbers then, there's no way he earned half a million dollars by 16</br>  <br>I enjoyed NH at the end but it took too long to get anywhere. Personally, I'm just glad they're good friends. <br><br>The shipping shit only matters as so to influence the amount of doujins when them in the future.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget about taxes and the like, also the village itself most likely takes a large cut out of that</br></br>  <br>He probably pissed it away on cup noodles and Jiraya pissed it away on booze and hookers. <br><br>Hell, even as Hokage people keep stealing from him.</br></br></br>  <br>Couples getting together in a shounen manga, it can only happen at the very end, when it comes to main couples.<br><br>The fighting is the main focus, but the main couples still almost always get together at the very end.<br><br>Kind of like Rave Master<br><br>its one of those rules</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant to say "if" he received maximum compensation.<br>For comparison, Shikamaru has completed 39 official missions in total: 8 D-rank, 3 C-rank, 9 B-rank, 19 A-rank, 0 S-rank.</br></br>  <br>Kishi has a shy titty monster win the MC last time, and it looks like the childhood friend has it in the bag this round.<br><br>All that's left is making Shizune win his grandson and all will be right in the world.</br></br></br>  <br> I enjoyed NH at the end but it took too long to get anywhere. <br><br>It was badly written piece of shit that retconned Naruto to unrealistically make it happen. Hinata has absolutely no ambition or personality either. She's just a womb for Naruto and little else. The Boruto movie highlights this shit. SS "romance" is shit too, but at least Sakura's given some agency as character.<br><br>Sarada and Buroto on the other hand are two distinct characters with two dreams who would support each others and are friends before becoming attracted when hormones kicked in and have some healthy relationship that's not "pinning from afar."</br></br></br></br></br>      <br> quints in a dead Naruto thread <br>this is what /a/ has come to</br></br>  <br>Those aren't the hiring fees, those are the rewards.<br>That's how much they get in the end.</br></br>  <br>accept it /a/non this is you and represents you, you love naruto and you know it.</br>  <br> dead Naruto thread <br><br>I fail to see how this is dead. It's still moving relatively fast compared to other threads.</br></br></br>  <br>I honestly loved Naruto maybe 5 years ago when I was first getting into anime. It's good as a gateway anime so I assume you're also new to anime. Don't worry, you'll fit in with the rest of us in a while.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Although I'd be lying to myself if I said I don't like NH in spite of all that. And they seem genuinely happy together, so I can't complain. <br><br>Their kids definitely have a more interesting dynamic though, I agree. Hinata had few relevant moments throughout the series, but when she did they were significant.<br><br>Basically Kishi played back-and-forth between Hinata and Pink Shit for so long and made nardo a sexless freak with the exception of Sauce that the overall execution was pretty messy.<br><br>That said, it kinda makes sense. nardo is dense and has no real idea what romantic love is, so him completely missing Hinata's advances isn't too far fetched.<br><br>What pisses me off is the fact that Kishi waited an additional 2 years after the war to get them going, and introduced a bunch of bullshit contrivances to do it. Realistically they should have been fucking like rabbits after the war, but that's in the past.<br><br>That said I enjoyed The Last a lot and am glad they got together.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsunade has completed 1,256 official missions in total: 40 D-rank, 236 C-rank, 467 B-rank, 418 A-rank, 95 S-rank. </br>  I think it was good until around the Pain arc. Maybe some lows in between, but I think that fight was the best in the series. <br><br>After that it gets a bit monotonous and edgy and Kishi having to one-up every previous fight by making it more absurd, which really shows in the Ninja War arc after they summon the Juubi (defend 1 bomb, then 3, then like a gorillion, etc).</br></br>  <br>oh god no please stop that hurt me to read im hear for the <br>and nothing else</br></br>  <br> , 0 S-rank. <br><br>Gaara retrieval didn't count as S-rank? They were going after the fucking Akatsuki who are designated as S-rank ninja.</br></br></br>  <br>People actually talking about Naruto means the board itself is dead.</br>  <br>Konoha are a bunch of greedy Jews.</br>  <br>I just hate shitty romance. The idea of both NH and SS are okay, but the way it was executed on both cases and it's still presented it's just so fucking bad for vastly different reasons. They are atrocious to me. <br><br> That said, it kinda makes sense. nardo is dense and has no real idea what romantic love is, <br><br>No, see, this is what I say: shitty retcon. Naruto knew. He was suddenly made a stupid idiot so he could be forced into a shitty romance with Hinata, who he ignored even when she confessed and died in front of her. You excusing that bullshit writing proves you're a stupid shit-eater shipper. He returning Hinata's feelings was as well written as SS. They just needed kids for the new generation.<br><br>Eh, but moving onto better topics.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> S-rank - Assigned to experienced jōnin and concern state-level confidential matters. Examples are assassinating VIPs, and transporting highly classified documents <br>It would fall under A-rank.</br></br>  <br>I disagree but respect your opinion.<br><br> Faggot. </br></br></br>  <br>Well regardless of who they assigned it to, I would think saving the Kazekage's life would be a state-level confidential matter</br>    <br> and concern state-level confidential matters <br>Rescuing the fucking Kazekage and stopping terrorists who want to bring about the end of the world isn't state-level?</br></br>  <br><br>Gaara's kidnapping wasn't confidential, it was public as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Naruto's problem is that his accomplishments tend to fall outside normal Ninja Parameters.<br><br>Which means the jews in charge can go "What?

You told me it would be done this weekend, but all we have are vague spoilers.<br><br>Anyway, Prisma thread.</br></br>  Shirou apparently killed Kerry.  <br>2 more months until the anime starts.</br>  <br>I want Shirou out of Prisma.</br>  <br>We all want things. I want yuri out of Prisma.</br>  <br>It's just fanservice, All the girls lust after Shirou anyway.</br>  <br>What is this expression trying to convey?</br>  <br><br>Why does it take so long to scanlate a single chapter of a popular manga. If only Translator-fag did Illya too.</br></br>  <br>Shirou chose correctly.</br>  <br>[X] Save Miyu<br>[] Persist on being a superhero</br></br>  <br><br>I want action and fightan.</br></br>  <br>You mean 2.5 months till it ends.</br>  After watching both the second OVA and the ep1 of Herz, I can conclude that this is the best anime season we've had in a long, long time.  <br>Imoutos are worth it.</br>    <br>reminder he traded the ability to be a superhero for the ability to straight up shit divine artifacts out when he needs them.<br>seriously if the jewel healing thing that happened a couple chapters ago fixed his internal wound problems he might be able to do UBW and just spam serious bullshit.<br><br>also i'm curious at this point to see how the 5th war went with miyu around and this shirou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That will be the next spin off series.</br>  <br>i almost feel like it was some fucked mix of UBW and HF, along with the ainsworths popping their heads in halfways through and fucking up the entire mess.</br>  <br> u told me it would be done this weekend, but all we have are vague spoilers. <br> just vague spoilers <br><br>Raws have been out for awhile.<br><br>Most of them are posted in the other thread.<br><br>Kerry is crazy with MoS and going to kill Miyu in the name of humanity, the only thing standing in his way is Shirou who's starting to go HF path instead, and will protect Miyu from him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There's some notable wear and tear on Shirou's mind in the most recent chapter, as he's torn between his father and doing the right thing, as its really breaking him a bit.  <br><br>Best part was that split second where we saw Ilya's tongue go after Kuro's.</br></br>  in that moment he starts to warp    <br>I just love that serial killer smile.</br>  <br>Woa Shirou, you looked like Shiki for a moment there.</br>  Korean noises  <br>I imagine his HGW would be install/include battles.<br>Jamming Archer's card inside him might have gave him a crash course in Tracing and UBW.<br><br>I can't imagine Angelica's face while using Gil card when she lost inside his UBW for the first time.<br><br>inb4 Shinji installed Medusa Rider and got her suit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lewd! Way too lewd!</br>  been waiting for this thread<br>anime only fag here<br><br>why the fug does everyone love shirou so much</br></br></br>  <br> I imagine his HGW would be install/include battles. <br> Jamming Archer's card inside him might have gave him a crash course in Tracing and UBW. <br><br>Don't know how this theory got around or how it keeps spreading that he ever installed the Archer card, or that's how he got everything<br><br>its not really based on anything though. Only grails or homus can install cards so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since Shirou is Archer, does including his card allow one to use his jackhammer?</br>  <br><br>I'm guessing it's a gag at this point. This show has a tremendous amount of callbacks to the original.</br></br>  There's maybe no fire in this world line? Yet shit still seems to have gone down for Shirou in a similar way.<br><br>Instead of walking through the flames step by step having to close his ears for the people calling for help as he had to ignore the, which fucked him up, it seems like it was more like this?<br><br>So slightly less fucked up</br></br></br></br>  Avalon might be unlikely    Why is it so lewd lately?  <br>Might be his Archer's arm equivalent</br>  <br>Its a theory people pulled out based on nothing. Nothing has said this has happened or that he installed to get his powers.<br><br>The reason he has more experience than his other self is that his other self was living in relative peace until he was eighteen. This Shirou was living to the death fighting against all who would come against him for far longer, and had to get experience and understand far before the other Shirou.<br><br>Its likely not some magic answer, rather he was forced to get started a lot sooner. We've never seen a normal human install anything to date. The most they can do is equips. He's not using the power of the Archer card, but archer's power is his power and he had to get good with it far sooner.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kerry is still an asshole <br><br>Welp.</br></br></br>  <br>No matter the universe some things just don't change.</br>  <br>He is the Hero the world needs.</br>  <br>Guess what choice led to everything being happy for everyone in normal Prism universe.<br><br>First hint, it was due to Kiritsugu making a certain choice.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd do the same actually.</br>  <br>I thought Angelica mentioned that the Archer card belonged to Shirou when she fought him and Kuro.</br>  <br>She was saying that this is his power, that the Archer card was him, not that he was literally using it at all.<br><br>She knew the identity of that hero without any chance.</br></br></br>  <br>Choice to be a family man asshole instead of being an utilitarian asshole.</br>  <br>How was he an asshole there? Everything worked out a thousand times better, saved his daughter and wife, and he was willing to take a chance while also shutting down the ritual.<br><br>Most you could really say is that he's not at home as much as he should be, but the maids are watching over his kids in the meantime.</br></br></br>  <br>THE BEST<br>H<br>E<br><br>B<br>E<br>S<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shame Miyu Shirou is kind of a jobber.  <br>What is the purpose? It have some kind of deep meaning behind it? What are we supposed to feel here?</br>  <br>He lost to one of the most powerful entity in his world. How was that jobbing?</br>  <br>He's just not the main character, not a protagonist. So this is the first time we've seen Shirou without plot armor, meaning he's normal class armor but not special class armor.<br><br>People bitch too much about him being a jobber though. He fucking beat Gilgamesh head on, he's only been in two fights so far after literally storming against a horde of corrupted servants without effort.<br><br>People were bitching about him effortlessly stealing the show and beating everyone in the first two chapters he was introduced, so he had to be brought down a peg just like Bazett when she was introduced and shown that they "can" lose. Yet for some reason such a simple equalizer of showing that Shirou can lose and isn't perfect, has caused people to think he's absolute weak shit jobber. Everyone is amazing as soon as they show up, but we all know it'll come down to Ilya here.<br><br>He lost because someone who isn't an MC can't beat the main villain, so something suddenly had to arise to get in his way there.<br><br>No that isn't being a jobber at all. You don't hear people calling Tohsaka and Luvia a jobber after the dozens of times they've lost so far in this story? Yet someone will always bitch about Shirou as though he will always lose and its a shame. Dammit something about that is stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lancelot <br> Powerful </br></br>  <br>He showed up, looked strong and cool, and then lost. That's pretty much jobbing.</br>  <br>Hiroyama has to ramp up the lewd before it gets banned for the Olympics, so he has to work twice as lewd per chapter now.</br>  <br>Sakuralot blindsided him.<br><br>If she wasn't there he would have manly fisticuffs with Julian.<br><br>My dick can't handle if Sakuralot upgrades to dark Sakuralot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mana-Transfer </br>  <br>I would consider backstabbing your employer, running away with their most important project and killing most if not all of them rather assholish behavior. Understandable but still quite assholish.</br>  <br>People call him a jobber because he showed up, looked cool, but got taken out for 90% of the fight.<br><br>He spent more chapters being healed by Rin than doing things. And why was he taken out again? To introduce a character who existed solely, at the time, to take Shirou out of the fight?<br><br>No seriously, does anyone actually fucking think Sakura's introduction in 3rei was handled well? she showed up, acted crazy, and then left. No prior introduction or set up. She was just some crazy bitch that appeared one chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He atleast did better than Miyu, used Gils card and ended up being possessed by him.</br>  <br>No, he couldn't beat or even reach the main villain at that point, the fact that he tried already guaranteed his defeat there.<br><br>The main villain is always invincible until a few rules are met. Only the MC can beat them, you need to hear their backtstory and motivations first entirely along with the secret they were holding back, you need to understand them inside and out and know that there's nothing left to them anymore and thus they can be taken out.<br><br>He was a side character trying to go for the MC credit there, which cannot happen. Something had to get in the way, just like something had to get in the way of Bazett taking out GIlgamesh in 2wei.</br></br></br></br></br>  Even her GOB items got taken over by Lancelot.  <br>I was talking about before he got captured. Beside, he lost to Julian and co before. If he won this fight, it would be an asspull.<br><br><br>Sakuralot is a kind of jobbing, but I think the whole fight isn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw you'll never be dominated by loli Gil <br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone here is saying he should have solo'd Julian and everyone, but he got a strong introduction, and then just did nothing for the rest of the arc. It was not exactly flattering.</br>  <br> Haven't read the manga yet, so excuse me if I sound like a retard. <br>Did he get fused with avalon at any point, because that is supposed to be where his origin and affinity come from. Which is what I believe allows him to trace weapons at all.<br>Where would his knowledge of weapons to trace come from in this anyway.<br>I am not sure if these plots points are the same or even covered at all. I do know that the grail war was stopped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like you just hate it so you're making up reasons even when they aren't right or don't have basis. You'll keep doubling down on those reasons no matter what, but what you're really saying underneath it all is that you just hated a lot of 3rei, so you've gotta rationalize it by throwing terms around.<br><br>No he's not a jobber, nor do you know what a jobber is there. You could say Bazett or Kuro got the exact same treatment in the manga, yet you don't consider them a jobber, because you're mainly looking for a reason to hate this. No there was nothing wrong with Lancelot's introduction there, it might not have been what you wanted but there was nothing wrong with it.<br><br>Shirou when he appeared took out dozens and beat Gilgamesh, then he lost as he needed to lose in order to create some tension and because he couldn't beat Julius yet. He's had a far better showing than almost anyone in the manga to date, yet you want it to just be "Oh man too bad he just sucks so much and is destined to lose no matter what, because fuck that part when he appeared".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miyuverse Shirou still best Shirou.</br>  <br>I just want to see small Gil use his card and see how it goes, hell with out it he still had GOB, but it was empty or something.</br>  <br> fully incarnated shota gil <br> shota gil carrying an oversized EA to blow up julius's shit when he inevitably does something to piss him off. </br></br>  <br>Your entire first paragraph is a weird personal attack that makes you come off like a know it all. It's not charming.<br><br>Yeah, I'm gonna be straight up. I didn't like the last story arc. It was a clustefuck of throwing "cool" things one after the other, with no semblance of actually following through with them. They introduced Shirou, he was around for a chapter or two, but got taken out and then became a commodity to save. They introduced Sakura of all characters, and what did she do? She tried to kill Shirou, and then just left. They didn't set her up like Miyu Shirou or gave any prior indication of her existence, she was just some crazy character who showed up in the middle of a fight.<br><br>Then you've got Gil, who finally had his card back, and did shit all with, even then the prior chapter set up a fight. We just got nothing. It was a mess. Even the entirety of the fight ended with Julian and company just leaving. It was anticlimax after anticlimax.<br><br>And for the record, Bazett and Kuro were seen as competent for a pretty long while until a bigger threat set things straight. Miyu Shirou got about a chapter or two?<br><br>Anyway, I'm guessing we've probably had this conversation before. I find that there are a lot of flaws in Prisma, in the back of my mind I'm constantly aware that this is a fanservice manga that right now, is trying to be serious, so I'm not going to give it the benefit of the doubt. It needs to earn being well regarded and not just a piece of fluff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   caring about things that aren't love and friendship <br>Guys this is mahou shoujo, the shit you're arguing about is literally just unimportant background fluff that's just there to be surpassed by the heroines.</br>  <br>Oh look, it's another guy that showed up, looked strong and cool, and then fucked off without doing anything. Hiroyama is the master of leaving everyone hyped with a cliffhanger and then end it up with a disappointed conclusion. Like in the latest chapter, everyone is thinking Shirou is going to kill the Edgelord, that ain't gonna happen, Kerry is just going to drop dead killed by whatever disease he has now.</br>  <br> Oh look, it's another guy that showed up, looked strong and cool, and then fucked off without doing anything. <br><br> Oh I fucking hate when an author sets up things. When something happens it must happen all at once and right now, otherwise it meant nothing. I fucking hate how Shirou being a major player was talked about since the beginning of 2wei, yet he didn't do something right from the chapter when he was talked about thus proving the author forgot about him and he never mattered. Why doesn't everything happen immediately and everything be settled right now? </br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but when you set things up, and don't follow through with them, that is a problem.<br><br>The Gil chapter is a prime example. Prior chapter ended with a big two page spread with Gil basically saying it was time to fuck shit up. What happens after that? He leaves.<br><br>I would like to know what the pay off for that is, because to me it just seems like the author was trying to hook people for the next chapter even though he didn't have any proper plans for the character.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Fucking whore.</br>  <br>Yep, Sapphire is a giant slut.</br>  <br>What annoys me the most about the non-blood related revelation is that we partially lost one of the arguments about Miyu being a real lesbian, now it's more possible that she actually wants the Shirou dick.</br>  <br>Why is she not for sale?</br>  <br>Actaully Sapphire is pure, it's Ruby who got messed up by old men.</br>  <br>no one pays for used goods</br>  <br>Because she's not Rin.</br>  <br> blood-related means they can't fuck <br> not-blood-related means they can <br>Both of these are bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Sapphire got handled by an old man too.<br>She just keeps appearances better, but is actually a slutwhore like her sister.</br></br>  <br> implying she didn't wished to become Shirou's blood sister. <br><br>She's a superior grail over Illya, wish like that should jack easy for her.</br></br></br>  <br> she's a superior grail over ilya <br>She really is? That's odd.<br>Ilya will always be my favourite cup, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, sheero poisoned kerry.</br>   download hiryuu sub of ep1 <br> it's actually less accurate than HS <br>Her name might officially be Chloe, but everyone uses Kuro as her nickname. Why are there still people that don't understand this?</br></br>  <br>Because they sound the same in Nipponese. Anyway, there's no reason to download a fansub release of this show unless you're a 10bit autist, UTW was terrible too.</br>    <br>Slut.</br>  <br>Taiga a cute.</br>    <br> it's just fanservice <br>Keep telling yourself that.</br></br>  Is the special out yet?  <br>Which episode was this?</br>  <br>Because Kuroe is her name. Kuro is her nickname.</br>  <br>New OVA.</br>  <br>Oh fuck, getting it now.</br>  <br>Raws only, no subs yet. Hiryuu is waiting for a better source but given how shit they did with Herz ep 1, you might want to grab whoever else comes along first.</br>  <br><br>Those Shirou eyes are the most goddamn infuriating false flag I've ever seen.</br></br>  <br>WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME JAPAN</br>  <br> Kuro sliding on Ilya's leg <br>Why the fuck is this allowed?</br></br>  Ahahahaha this show<br> Rui almost kill <br> Hajime slowly going crazy <br> VAPE leader seems still has something up his sleeve <br> Alien KanaHana/Sugita 'uniting' people <br> Tsubasa being stupid <br> 2:6:2 <br><br>I don't remember season 1 being this fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The first three episodes kind of sucked, but this is getting interesting now.<br>Gel-chan is going to turn into a crazy leader trying to "unite" people and the Gatchaman will be split in half because they have different ideals.</br>  <br>Yeah, the start was a bit slow, but it actually builds up to such an interesting conflict.<br><br>Gatchaman splitting is also an interesting idea. I'm really curious as which direction will they take for this show.</br></br></br>  Green Hitler is the best character  <br>Considering how little really happened in S1, I don't have hope for any of these plotlines to have any real consequences. I hope it will turn out to be better than S1 though.</br>  <br> bring in ANOTHER TRAP <br>I literally cracked up laughing when it was revealed.</br></br>  <br> Hajime slowly going crazy <br>Nah, Hajime is the only sane one of the bunch. If she were so easily corrupted by Katze, she wouldn't be Hajime.<br><br>I really like how they're incorporating the fact that the original Katze was his own sister, though. Now it's Hajime that's both a guy and a girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>S1 was all over the place at the beginning too. I remember how everyone thought it was going to be an alien-of-the-week show based off of the first episode.</br>  S1 &gt; S2  <br>Her talk about conflicts and shit gave a weird vibe to me. I'm not sure if it's off-character or not, she's eccentric alright but I don't remember her spouting something like that in season 1. Also her feelings balloon thingie never changes, always grey. I think it's hinting something.</br>  <br>That's just Hajime being Hajime. To translate for her, she's basically saying that life would be incredibly fucking boring if everyone agreed on everything. Conflict is important in everything, from large scale wars down to small scale simple conversation. If there's no conflict, that means there's no difference in opinion. Can you imagine an /a/ where everyone actually agrees with everyone? Disgusting.<br><br>Conflict is what makes people unique. Conflict is what makes things interesting. Conflict without reason, conflict that acts to harm others is bad, sure, but conflict on its own isn't just harmless, it's good.<br><br>Also remember that Tsubasa's granpa also has a grey bubble. Think of it as a zen state. Hajime has achieved perfect Genki Zen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>S1 built up all the characters and the universe that this show exists in.<br>Now that it's all established, hopefully they'll do something interesting with it.</br></br>  <br>Makes sense, as I kind of forget how does she operates usually as I forgot many things from season 1. But that sounds kinda boring. I hope Katze inside her can at least influence her a bit. I don't like her that much in season 1, but in season 2 where she usually shown as a mentor/senpai character, I'm starting to like her better.</br>  <br>It's not gay if it's with a alien,right?</br>  <br>I could see Katze take over for a short while in the inevitable Hajime v Tsubasa battle later on, beating Tsubasa in within an inch of her life before regaining control. I see Hajime as a far more stable character, though. She's not there to develop, she's not there to guide the viewer, she's just leading her way through the world. She's already complete in a sense. I can definitely see why people would consider that boring, but I enjoy her personality.<br><br>Another thing to consider is that she's not really the main focus. In S1, Rui was essentially the main character; he had a character arc and everything. Now it's Tsubasa's turn. Perhaps you should think of her less as the protagonist and more as a vehicle for the story.</br></br></br>  <br>Technically, I think what matters is it's a boy.<br>But nobody would blame you here either ways.</br></br>  I'm sure this was mentioned a lot last week, but that "I'm not killing you" line, followed by the stabbing was a tiny bit contradictory. Are we supposed to sympathize with his ideals? Is he that type of villain?  <br>I don't think Katze has that power, but I hope so.<br>There is no doubt Tsubasa will be the main focus character-wise because Hajime isn't necessarily a character that develops if you get what I mean. She is what she is, and she won't change.<br>Tsubasa is going to align with Gel and butt heads with everyone else because she has a strict and rather blind definition of what heroism is and wants to naively "get rid of all conflict".</br></br></br>  <br> Gel chan is a boy <br>I told you so!<br><br>Also Hajimei will go full Diablo II and get possessed by Kazeberg.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you mean the VAPE leader? The "I won't be the one that kills you, it will be your ideals" line?</br>  <br><br>He's a blackflag. He wants crowds to look bad at all cost.</br></br>  <br>Gel doesn't have a gender. It's an alien. It changes its form to whatever is appropriate or necessary for the situation.</br>  <br>I think Hajime and Katze are going to have to clash and learn to fight in sync this season so we still might be getting some development.</br>  <br> &gt;Hajime slowly going crazy <br><br>Please elaborate</br></br></br>  <br>Um, it has a boy and a guy form.<br>It does have a gender.</br></br>  <br>They referred to the young form as a she though</br>  <br>Anon please.</br>  <br> what is trap <br>Come on he wears a short, and voiced by Hanakana, who is a popular choice for shota traps lately. Nothing implies it would be a girl aside from being androgenous, which is nothing new for this show. If he has a male adult form, why wouldn't it be a little boy?</br></br>  <br>Go back to tumblr.<br><br>https://twitter.com/GATCHAMANCrowds<wbr>/status/625010151456575488<br><br>He's a boy.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's an alien, so I don't know why we're trying to ascribe human gender to it.<br>Granted, I could be overcomplicating things but I wouldn't put it past this show, and I see no evidence to the contrary.</br></br>  <br> They referred to the young form as a she though <br><br>The shitty subs did. They never did in Japanese.</br></br></br>  Banned in Australia  <br><br> ゲルサドラが少年の姿 <br> 少年の姿 </br></br></br>  <br>Anyways evidence still points that form being a boy in human terms.</br>  <br>Forget it, that is solid proof for him being a boy.</br>  <br>Yup. I only went off of the show, guess I should've looked it up. But I assumed Gatchaman with the reverse-traps and crossdressing would insert a character with no gender for manipulation purposes.</br>  <br>Aliens don't give a shit about acting like their gender is supposed to so it's not like it matters anyway.</br>  <br>It matters. He has balls and a wiener between his legs. Not a delicious loli pussy.</br>  <br>That's because they didn't know Gel was a boy.</br>  <br>He's just pissy because he's trying to quit smoking and all he's using to help is a fucking sucker.<br><br>Joe! Pull the stick out, get a nicotine patch!</br></br></br>  <br>Well in a way it's Schrödinger's crotch. Right now it is in a quantum state. We will only know for sure when it's observed.</br>  Just to put it here, Utsutsu is also a boy.  <br>You should learn to appreciate both.</br>  <br>Before she did it, she was worried Katze would affect her.<br><br>All that changed so far is inflated Hajime's and a tendency to shut him up through sleep</br></br></br>  <br>Hajime is not going crazy.<br><br>She is just the most who gets JJ so she speaks in a way similar to him.<br><br>:&gt;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck You<br>u<br>c<br>k<br> <br>Y<br>o<br>u</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would be happy if I could, believe me.</br>  <br>Utsutsu is actually a tentacle monster in her true form.</br>  <br>Haven't seen JJ since Tsubasa. Last season didn't they all gather in the circle and listen to him now and then<br><br><br>Kinda surprising how none of them have commented on them being the antithesis of Crowds. Everybody gets powers vs specific folks chosen by an enigmatic creature</br></br></br></br>  <br>The other solid proof is nobody reacting with YOU'RE A BOY like happened with Rui. Everyone knew Gelsadra was a shota in the show.<br><br>HorribleSubs were Horriblesubs. There was no "she" or talk of Gel-kun being a girl in Japan.</br></br></br>  <br> a character with no gender for manipulation purposes. <br><br>OD is possibly that. At least the director doesn't consider them a man.</br></br></br>  <br>He's wearing high heels.<br>And Hajime's gigantic breasts go to show that women are represented with those in the series.<br>Utsutsu has a flat chest. Just accept Utsutsu-kun.</br></br></br>  <br>Smaller than a jap D-cup /= male</br>  <br>It's a boy. Believe me, I have a sense for these things.</br>  <br> Kinda surprising how none of them have commented on them being the antithesis of Crowds. Everybody gets powers vs specific folks chosen by an enigmatic creature <br><br>They should comment how dangerous they could be too. Katze was a Gatchaman.</br></br></br>  <br> Just to put it here, Utsutsu is also a boy. <br>Utsu utsu shimasu</br></br>  The only girls are Tsubasa and X.  <br> learn to fight in sync <br>If they don't make it so she is wearing half her armor and half Katze I will be extremely disappointed.</br></br>  <br>I'm not really seeing it but some anon said Hajime's suit is getting redder each time she transform. Is that true?</br>  Utsutsu is a plant   giving a shit about who is a boy and who is a girl in this show <br><br>I want to fuck all Gatchas, except the fatty host talk show. Even edgy carrotop, he needs a good dicking in jail.</br></br>  <br>Yes. Her note also changed.</br>  <br>E-even the prime minister?</br>  <br>This was her former suit. Her Note was completely white too, and now has red stripes.</br>  <br>In the beginning of the show I thought I wasn't going to enjoy OD, but they've definitely grown on me. Especially his Gatchman designs, it's by far the coolest looking one.</br>   /a/ said try out an anime <br> It's shit </br>  Isn't that good?<br>Now you know not to watch this anime.

Kanon also has masterpiece writing, Naruto is a great manga, Attack on Titan is the work of a genius and G-reco is for the greatest of minds.</br>      <br> kekkei <br>You can't even spell it right. Also it's not even close to hipster, it sold 20k copies so far in Japan and it's extremely popular/talked about on just about any website you can think of including 4chan.</br></br>    I always thought Rickert was a girl.  <br>nice reading comprehension</br>  <br> I always thought Rickert was a girl. <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>in the early chapters he looked pretty girlish m8</br>  <br>Isn't berserk a harem now?</br>  Wow, it's finally out<br>Colour me amazed<br><br> I wish Rickert had told people the truth about Griffith, but I understand why he didn't. Nearly everyone is a blind Griffith worshipper now, so it would just be taken as false propaganda. <br>Well, Luca in particular is wiser than that, but Rickert doesn't know that.</br></br></br></br>    What if Guts dies &amp; Little Witch takes over?    <br>Shierke magical girl spinoff when?</br>  <br> magical girls <br> in my fate vs man manga </br></br>  <br>When  they get off the boat </br>  <br> in <br>That's not what a spinoff is.</br></br>  <br>He will be soon enough.</br>  <br>The only spinoff Berserk should have is a prequel about SK.</br>  <br> mahou shoujo witch piloting a corpse mecha </br>  <br>Are supporters supposed to tease you with their lewd soles like that ?

He is the oldest member so it would make sense.  <br>But he almost let vengeance consume him, to the point he was willing to let innocents die or even kill innocents.</br>  Why cant miura release at least 50 pages per chapter? Hes doing things monthly and he has the story planned out right? 20 pages is too short.  <br><br>Does it really matters, man, like whatever</br></br>  Silat Hype.<br>The true hero comes to save the boy..!</br>  <br>Silat a bro</br>  <br>Until the end!</br>  <br>We don't know</br>  <br>Sorry to ask, but what is this from?</br>  Can someone explain to me how Ganishka is kill?<br><br>I read it twice and the manga doesn't really explain it at all. Griffith flew into the trees, and then suddenly Ganishka flaskback, then Skull Knight arrived, trying to assasinate Griffith or Ganishka? then suddenly Vatican sprout out of the trees, fairlytale creatures came out and Griffith became the 2nd coming of Jesus?</br></br>  <br> trying to assasinate Griffith or Ganishka? <br><br>Neither.</br></br></br>  <br>Then what the fuck is he doing? I thought he's against the Godhand, why is he sprouting Vatican out of Ganishka?</br>  Is noname a virgin?  <br><br>Twice reborn and then cut with a sword that reaches deeper still, anon.<br><br>Skull Knight is bringing the God Hand closer to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck does "twice reborn" means?</br>  <br><br>You have been reading Berserk right?</br></br>  <br>It means he was reborn once as an apostle and again as Shiva.</br>  <br><br>Ok I get that Skullknight tried to strike Griffith with his Behelit sword, but Griffith went Aizen and "it was my plan all along" and redirect the tear in space into Ganishka's face, in which killed Ganishka.<br><br>But then where did the Vatican city come from? What is the extent of Skullknight's Behelit sword power? Would Vatican city sprout up if Griffith just killed Ganishka straight up without Skullknight's Behelit sword strike? What happened to Skullknight afterward? Did he just "well I dun goofed" and leave? <br><br>I'm glad that it finally ended the worst, drawn out arc in Berserk, but there are several things that doesn't make sense</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "it was my plan all along" and redirect the tear in space into Ganishka's face, in which killed Ganishka. <br><br>No, Griffith is still dancing to Skullies tune here.</br></br></br>  Wait I don't understand. He got sad because Theresia hated him or because he fucked up her life? Between the weird character development of Gutts and the 0/10 literally worst translation i have ever read in my entire life it's getting kinda difficul to understand his character  <br>Falconia was the former capital of Midland that was buried beneath the earth which Griffith raised up using his god powers. <br>No idea.<br>Probably.<br>He fucked off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is Skullomania's end game? What is his tune?<br><br>He can warp space and teleport anywhere he want, why can't he just murder all apostles in their sleep? Maybe not Griffith per say, because it has been shown that Griffith is omnipotent but Zodd, the Hunter, Lancer, Crystal Dragons etc stood no chance against Skull'O. <br><br>Also, if Griffith can avoid surprise attack from the one weapon in the series that can hurt a God Hand, then I can't see any way Miura can come up with an acceptable way of Guts beating Griffith. Guts need to at least get Ascension and become Godhand himself, because no amount of Berserker armor power ups would help him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, if Griffith can avoid surprise attack from the one weapon in the series that can hurt a God Hand <br><br>It's not only Griffith, all the other God Hand can do the same kind of thing. Void does it during the Eclipse when Skully breaks in.<br><br>Skull Knight outright states that he's planning on creating a portal to the "vortex" and trap the God Hand there. Right now I think he might be waiting on Elf Island for Guts to arrive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no reason why the dragonslayer wouldn't hurt the godhand if it hit them<br><br>Hitting them is the hard part, though</br></br></br>  PLEASE I NEED HELP WHERE THE FUCK CAN I GET THE DARKHORSE SCANS THIS SHIT IS KILLING ME  I don't understand how he managed to survive the heartbeats from the sea god <br>I really thought he at least would go blind after that</br>  Who or what is he?  <br>casca's son?</br>  <br><br>Wise magical negros apostle form</br></br>  <br>he's their son that griffith stole when he raped casca</br>  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  can someone tell me why did he raped casca? <br>was it really just him being butthurt that she loved guts and not him?</br>  <br>Femto is devoid of humanity and compassion as is typical of all apostles.<br><br>All what's left in him was his bitterness and hurt over what Guts did to him. So he decided to punish Guts in the cruelest ways imaginable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The reincarnated Soul of their son. It and Griffith (Femto) are connected. As long as one lives the other cannot die. To kill Griffith Guts will have to murder his only child.<br><br>The fetus demon thing that Casca gave birth to was used as the vessel to bring Femto into the physical world. However when Femto manifested and took control of the body he forced the thing's soul out. This is it's new form.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A qt</br></br>  <br>Narrative. <br>But yeah, I think he was being possessive in order to destroy Guts. Something that not much people seem to notice about the rape is how "caring" Femto was. He kissed, licked and stimulated the way you'd do someone you want to give pleasure as well.<br>And to have the girl you love enjoying herself in an despicable act despite being so fucked up was enough not only to break Guts, but to break Casca as well.<br>Femto just killed two birds with one stone</br></br></br></br>  <br>This was one of the nicest moments in the manga so far.</br>  <br>You sure about that big boy?</br>  <br>What are you implying?</br>  <br> farnese <br>I really hope she gets hatefucked by a hundred apostles when guts has to choose if he wants to become a god hand</br></br>  <br>Almost and did are different things, Anon-kun.</br>  <br> Guts will never be your dad </br>  <br>You can use google, you know?<br> Witch Hunter </br></br>  <br>LOL Casca had the brand of sacrifice so i'm pretty sure she was suffering a lot</br>  <br>The brand wasn't bleeding and her body did enjoy it. You just have to look at the manga panels.</br>  <br> Well, Luca in particular is wiser than that, but Rickert doesn't know that. <br>I always thought she was a smartass.</br></br>  Where did he go wrong, /a/?  <br>Nowhere, his OSTs are still the best selling ones.</br>  meme composer  He has samesong syndrome and his song titles are almost illegible. Oh, and let's not forget the inappropriate rap segments he somehow jams into otherwise acceptable songs.  Japanese Harry Gregson-Williams  Because he didnt make a sequel for Kung Fu Hustle  So i guess doujishi is fucked, thanks TPP<br>http://mainichi.jp/select/news/2015<wbr>0728k0000m020060000c.html</wbr></br>  This doesn't sound good. What exactly is happening?  What has happened, OP?  How many more days do we have before TPP is in action?  <br><br>It's over. It means no more sadpanda or anime for you.</br></br>  From what I understand, this is in response to the TPP finalizing the copyright protection period as "70 years after the author's death", and non-Antragsdelikt. The latter means that anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author. I think. Policy terms aren't my forte.

It was definitely less retarded than the second season, but on the other hand, it didn't feel very meaningful either. It was clearly an Akane-Kougami movie, so I guess it's understandable that the rest of the cast was ignored, but even the lead duo didn't get any development. Neither really questions the other's views, much less their own. <br> googami ur like makishimapan now <br> lel okay <br> come home <br> no <br> then don't <br><br>It's just blatantly saying they're going to milk this with more sequels, so can't do anything drastic now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want real robot psycho pass</br>  I dont understand...I downloaded the 1080 version and is not working...what should I do...pls help  <br> ...x2 </br>  Drawfag Thread 1550<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1549 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Other than learning techniques for certain materials and subsurface scattering...
