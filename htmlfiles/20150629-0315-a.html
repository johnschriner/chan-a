[ New chapter. His name is Josefumi Kujo.<br><br>http://bato.to/read/_/329173/jojos-<wbr>bizarre-adventure-part-8-jojolion_c<wbr>h44_by_hi-wa-mata-noboru<br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> name field <br>Fuck, why did I do that?</br></br>  part 8 is shit   His name is Josefumi Kujo <br>I still don't believe the hobo slut. Those eyes just don't make any sense.</br>  I completely thought the twist in OP image was that she was a trap about to get her dick sucked.  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br>  <br>That was my immediate assumption as well.</br>  <br>Does Araki still draw black people like that?</br>  <br>completely serious, the art, the story, everything</br>  <br>No blacks in Morioh.</br>  Karera is fucking disgusting and I want to fuck her.  <br>Slags are popular for a reason, dog.</br>  <br>AAAAHHAAHAHAHAHH <br><br>ANON STOP IT'S TOO FUNNY</br></br></br>  Why is nobody talking about the soccer brothers? What's his power supposed to be?  <br>It's hard to tell if it's really a stand ability or something rock people can just naturally do. Yagiyama phased through walls and rocks all the time.</br>  <br>remember when kars became the ultimate being and turned his hand into a squirrel? maybe something similar to that</br>  <br>Whatever he touches with his left hand is like materialized/teleported in front of his rock stump. Pretty cool I guess how it displaces shit around whatever materializes. Who knows what soccer ball/bag can do though.</br>  <br>I'm also interested in why they're hunting Karera.</br>  <br>Probably.</br>   Jojo parts described in one sentence: <br><br>part 1: downton abby with vampire, sunlight kungfu, and the titanic<br><br>part 2: ancient homosexual aztec vampire gods get trolled by british human bugs bunny<br><br>part 3: A jap, his gramps, a muslim, a metrosexual, and a frenchman all hunt down a british vampire banana man on the other side of the world<br><br>part 4: a quiet town has a fetish murderer, manga artist, and a couple of characters up to no good, while a gang of school kids hustle niggas left and right.<br><br>part 5: a group of gay fashionistas seek to find their pink hyena leader to save his daughter<br><br>part 6: women go to prison with a 10 year old boy while a gay black catholic priest ends the entire universe for his deceased gay lover<br><br>part 7: Paraplegic and an aspiring Italian comic race across america to find the corpse of jesus christ and kill the president while dinosaurs wait for them at every turn<br><br>part 8: Araki just shows us all his fetishes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK OFF</br>  What stand would you want out of JoJo? Hard mode: Only secondary allies or minor villians.<br><br>Pic related for me. A stand that was built around my fetish for rain would make me happy as all hell.</br></br>  Just made it to the end of the manga. I've had virtually no contact with jojo fans, is there anything cool made by them I should know about?<br><br>I've already tried the 7th Stand game. Also, is there more spinoffs and material I should read? I've only read the part 1-8(what's there) mangas.</br></br>  <br> Also, is there more spinoffs and material I should read?  <br>Definitely read the Rohan sidestories and Under Execution, Under Jailbreak.</br></br>  <br> Translator note: Die means die.  <br><br>Bullshit, whoever made this image is retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>The Rohan spinoffs, Dead Man's Questions, Jolyne's weirdass one-shot, and shitloads of doujins.</br>  <br>Hero choice:<br>1. Harvest (jew stand, 100 ministands, very powerful, eyes everywhere, each one can hold a shot glass worth of liquid.)<br>2. Burning down the house (pocket dimension, ghost tools for any situation that I can pull out of hammerspace, sanctuary)<br><br>Villain Choice:<br>1. Death 13 (Infinite possibilities. De-age myself and regenerate in dream world, give myself perfect body, change appearance if need be every night, exploit dream world and memory gap to find out anything I need.)<br><br>2. Red Hot Chili Peppers (infinite range in the developed world, ultimate internet troll, extreme technokenisis, very powerful)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  JoJolion 44 was really good. Karera owns.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127286264 <br>I did mention the doujins. Did he look in the pastebin?</br>  How the hell are you supposed to pronounce his name? Joe-sey-fu-me? forgive my lack of Japanese name pronounciation  <br>Nevermind I was retarded. He asked about spin-offs. Sorry.</br>  <br>Joseph + oomee</br>  <br><br>this was one of my favorite stands in SBR (probably jojos as a whole too). Every time it rains I think of how fun it would be to just start leaping and warping through the air around the city.</br></br>  <br>Copy-paste くうじょう じょせふみ in Google Translate and click the pronounciation icon.</br>  Reminder to people that Karera claimed he was not this Josefumi and only felt "convinced" because he used his stand to say her name  <br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/ArakiColle<wbr>ction#ekq7kauz4u8ux<br><br>I assume these are the ones I'm looking for? Am I forced to use cbz though? I like online</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Then use Batoto and look under the artist Araki Hirohiko.</br>  <br>Johnny = Johnathan<br><br>Gappy = Josuke + Jotaro + Kira + joseph?<br><br>Made in Heaven did a number on the post-phatom blood protags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not how Made In Heaven works you faggot.</br>  <br>Wat. Where the hell did you get Joseph from?</br>  <br>Thanks<br><br>Also, can someone dump the gifs of the man kicking a globe at a kid with stand edits? I can't find them, but I saw someone dumping them in the past</br></br></br>  <br>Here they are.<br>http://imgur.com/a/F2j7n</br></br>  <br>The snapback from MiH made the SBR until proven otherwise. All signs point to this. ASB and jorge joestar note this.<br><br><br>His name is Josefumi pronounced "josephumi."<br>Also he is the second protag in his universe and is fighting men made of stone, almost as if they were from pillars of stone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh my god, I'm fucking dying from some of these</br>  <br>Okay, you flaming homosexual. Whatever you say.</br>  <br>The comments say "Kishibe Rohan wa Ugokanai" is fan-made and not official, is that true?</br>  <br> The snapback from MiH made the SBR until proven otherwise. <br>It's the other way around, it's different unless stated otherwise. <br><br>ASB and Jorge weren't even made by Araki and the crazy part of Jorge explicitly takes place in a different universe from the manga anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's not.</br>  <br>I'm going to make the mistake of taking you seriously for a minute.<br><br>SBR is not the Ireneverse. Why? Because Irene still has Jotaro for a dad. Jotaro doesn't exist in SBR, he's split between Kira and Josefumi. Neither of them live in America. Further that takes place in 2011 and JJL is 2014, further making it impossible to be the same world.<br><br>ASB is non canon as fuck. Vanilla Ice can drink Wham's blood. That's all I have to say on that. And if you're citing Jorge, I remind you it has no translation and most of /a/ just goes on what a few anons have speculated or made up based on author illustrations.<br><br>Josefumi has the same character in his name as Josuke from part 4, and Kujo. Gappy is the second protag, but in Morioh, and stone men aren't the focus. <br><br>Please consider things before you post again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JoJolion takes place in 2011, actually. Barely a few weeks have passed since the first chapter.</br>  <br>Anon, I haven't even read any of the side material and it's obvious that the Irene shit will be retconned if it doesn't fit with part 8 because Araki is like that. It was made very obvious that SBR takes place after made in heaven shenanigans.</br>  <br> . It was made very obvious that SBR takes place after made in heaven shenanigans. <br>It really wasn't. SBR was not even a Jojo part at first.</br></br>  What do you guys think of a stand named Lankslacks or  King Krule   <br><br> Irene and Jo2aro aren't kujo but are for a fact Joestars by the birthmark <br> George had 3 kids, Joseph 2, all of which could have descendants <br> Josefumi and Kyou Nijimura are both joestars not listed on the family tree, meaning there are some not listed. <br><br>You can gloat all you want, doesn't change that SBR/Lion is part of the jojo continuity. It is officially part of the jojo story according to araki, just never explained how exactly. Seeing how we last left off with jojo universe being flipped turned upsidedown, the only assumption is that this is side universe.<br><br>Now stop acting arrogant about a manga and open your mind to what could and most likely is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because Irene still has Jotaro for a dad. Jotaro doesn't exist in SBR, he's split between Kira and Josefumi. <br><br>That's not how it works. The new universe remembers stuff from the old universe. It doesn't mean X is now Y. There's lots of references to Jotaro outside of these two characters. The Joestar family is huge in this universe, it wouldn't be strange for Irene to exist.</br></br></br>  <br> It really wasn't. SBR was not even a Jojo part at first. <br><br>It pains me that the JoJo fandom is this retarded.<br><br> The universe ends <br> Araki immediately comes out with a manga about a guy named JoJo who learns magical kung-fu from a Zeppeli and develops a Stand <br> it doesn't say JoJo's Bizarre Adventure <br> MUST NOT BE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ireneverse people had the exact same souls as those in the original universe. SBRverse characters often extensively reference many different old characters from several previous parts at the same time, and one old character's traits are often spread between several new people.<br><br>That's not even how MIH works anyway. Only the people killed during accelerated time get replaced with different people while everyone else gets brought over the way they were. <br><br>Also Part 8 Morioh is a different place with different geography and a different town emblem than part 4 Morioh.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Seeing how we last left off with jojo universe being flipped turned upsidedown, the only assumption is that this is side universe. <br><br>Side universe, yeah. D4C showed that there are an infinite amount of alternate universes and most likely SBR/JJL are parallel to Ireneverse. People are arguing that SBR/JJL and Ireneverse are the same, which they are likely not.</br></br></br>  <br>You're shit, Part eight has some amazing characters and stands.</br>  <br>I'm wondering. Does Araki fill in the backgrounds later in the tankobons?</br>  <br> fandom <br><br>Araki loved self-referencing even before he started Jojo. Read Cool Shock BT for example, the two main characters are obvious prototypes for many characters he later wrote for Jojo.</br></br></br>  <br>Originally the focus was on Gyro.<br><br><br>Which is why he's better than Johnny in any possible way</br></br></br></br>  <br>Antagonist or not, I want more Joubin.</br>  <br><br><br>but there are 3 universes at work here. <br><br>OG universe &gt; HEAVEN &gt; snapback to Ireneverse<br><br>So Its safe to assume that Ireneverse is very different and doesn't follow the same rules as pucci's HEAVEN. Also Jotaro and Jolynes souls are dead forever, 2 universes behind. They can't possibly be in the ireneverse. <br><br>And by side I mean that its not the same universe as the original, but it is still in the same cycle as it. And seeing how both Pucci's and Valentines Stands affect the BASE universe (Pucci's even surpassing God himself), it is safe to assume they are in the same timestream and cycle of renewing the universe.<br><br>OG &gt; HEAVEN &gt; Snapback &gt; SBR/Lion/Irene</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying <br><br>He couldn't enter the true man's world and that's why he died for some faggot kid and some shitty country. If it was Gyro in johnny's shoes with Valentine's proposition at the end he would've took the bait and ended up dead.<br><br>I loved Gyro but he had the same problem alot of protags have where they're just absolute pussies when it comes time to cash the check. This is why I liked Johnny.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's saying they have to be related in any way at all though? All we have is Araki saying the two worlds have no relation in space or time. Is it that hard to just consider it a new story by the same author until he ever explicitly states otherwise?</br>  <br> New story <br> about a guy named jojo with poses, stands, Dio, the world, zeppli's dying for the jojo, Joestar birthmarks, and kungfu calulus instead of sunlight kung fu <br> totally different. <br><br>DBZ isn't the same as Dragon Ball and neither is GT. Its a completely different story with a different name. Theres just similar names and stories but they aren't the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> DBZ isn't the same as Dragon Ball <br>I'm reading this right, am I?</br></br>  <br>theres a Z duh comics don't count!</br>  <br>Yeah, my reading's fine.  You should probably leave. </br>  <br>Part 7 is all about sandman at the start, it started off being about his story and winning the race, the gyro was introduced and the story focused on him. Part 7 started to be monthly so araki probably started off with the story about sandman but still wanted to work on jojo</br>   Can make peoples' hair grow out of anything within 80m, so long as the target has touched the surface. <br>What the fuck is up with JoJolion stands, holy shit.</br>  <br>We don't really know anything about it yet. It might be just one aspect of the ability.</br>  <br>He kept some of the old rules in place because he still liked them and it was convenient. What's so hard to get about this</br>  <br>I think it's good that some of the stands in JoJolion are actually really quite mundane in theory. Jobin's is the same.</br>  <br>I bet you keep telling yourself this about King Nothing too.</br>  <br>Why do you think Norisuke refuses to divulge further into his Stand?</br>   YFW JOSEFUMI TRAVELS TO ANOTHER DIMENSION AND SAVES YOUNG JOSUKE WHEN HE'S STUCK IN THE CAR   <br><br><br> SBR founded by the SPEEDWAGON foundation literally there from the start <br> sandman literally lasted only the first chapter and then never to be seen again except during final stretches of race finish lines <br> was a stand of the week with literally just Echoes act 2 and died pointlessly. <br> gyro was on the crest of the series from the very start showing he was gonna be the MC from the start. First chapter is even about training in the native lands with the steel ball against the wall <br> Sandman had a stand from the start <br> abdul literally in the second chapter. <br><br>People who keep up this "SBR was its own series" meme really need to face reality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally Killer Queen, but just makes things hot instead of bombs. </br>  <br>Nah, why would I do that? It was clearly defined. Karera on the other hand has only used hers for stealing and con artistry so far.</br>  <br>Whatever dude.</br>  <br>Josefumi is dead, anon.</br>  <br>Not even that because it only works if someone uses a swiping motion, not just being touched and a big part of KQ is getting rid of all proof of it being used on something. <br><br>It's great because the apparently limited ability means the usage has to be very creative.</br></br></br>  <br> some reused names and character designs <br>Do you even know what the word "reference" means?</br></br>  <br> Originally the first 23 chapters (4 volumes) were serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 2004 simply under the title Steel Ball Run. Although the character's names are obviously related to the series, it was unclear if the story was a part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. However, when the series moved to Ultra Jump in 2004, it was officially announced as part 7 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, but in an alternate universe, like the following and current arc, JoJolion. </br>  <br>You sure showed him.</br>  <br>He doesn't.<br><br><br>I never did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Gappy will get his hairstyle except without the shaved sides</br>  <br> it only works if someone uses a swiping motion <br>Nah, that was Jobin trying to be sneaky about his stand usage. It has never been said that's a requirement. Remember how everyone acted like PMK only worked on faces?</br></br>  Why can't Araki draw blood? Every time someone is bleeding I think they're about to turn into a symbiote..  <br> Although the character's names are obviously related to the series, it was unclear if the story was a part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. <br>So Dragonball and Dragonball Z<br><br> it was officially announced as part 7 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, but in an alternate universe, like the following and current arc, JoJolion. <br>So you mean that thing that Irene was in? An alternate timeline created when the universe snapped back from Made in heaven?<br><br>Hmm, seems awful strange that the part that takes place after 6, just HAPPENS to be in an alternate timeline, with similar people everywhere with different names and similar happenings. <br><br>Its almost as if it was the exact same thing as what was going on with the ireneverse. And it came right after it in the continuity. And reuses all the same assets (stands, rules, time periods, locations). I wonder why that is?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's because his initial drawing style was based on Hokuto Shin Ken where people usually exploded in a bloody storm.<br><br>And since no one ever talked about that, it's set in bloody stone in his style.</br></br></br>  <br>Is JoJo a Gorgeous Irene sequel?</br>  <br> bloody storm <br> bloody stone </br></br>  <br>This is too lewd. Please spoiler it in future.</br>  <br> no joestar birthmark <br> not same irene or story <br><br>Good try, but no. Araki explicitly stated which are Jojo. And SBR is jojo. And Irene from "What a Wonderful World" is jojo. <br><br>Just because it wasn't hand served to you in the first parts that it was Jojo, you act like that makes a difference, even though ex post facto it was stated it was. Get over it, Part 6 leads into part 7. Alternate universe. We're just seeing the past of the ireneverse.<br><br>Please try harder.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay.<br><br><br> Stop responding to him. </br></br></br></br>    <br>There's nothing that really confirms or denies that at the moment. People that refer to the ASB interview with semantics over 'parallel' vs 'alternate' are stretching it.<br>We'll just have to wait and see if Irene shows up.<br>I sure as fuck would be happy if they were one in the same, I want to see what happens to Emporio.</br></br></br>    <br>He's gonna keep spouting his Ireneverse theory over and over. Ignore him.</br>  <br>Your next line will be "You're a fag, anon"!<br>TOR IU!</br></br>  <br> Emporio with two stands <br> Grown up in the time skip <br> still rocking that baseball suit <br><br>Araki please, we need this.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is the scan quality so inconsistent? Chapter 39 for example looked really great for Ultra Jump scans but some other ones are so dark a lot of the subtler shading detail goes missing  <br> paints himself purple </br>  <br>Looks okay to me. The contrast is just really high.</br>  <br>what is this about?</br>  <br>Just a style choice Araki pics sometimes. <br><br>He did it rarely in SBR and must have remembered it recently.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a stylistic choice that wants you to focus on Karera and the bald guy first and Gappy second.</br>  Made in Heaven has to be the second least understood stand in the series, right after King Crimson.  <br>That and Hey Ya.</br>  <br>Bites The Dust is far more cryptic <br><br>Its easy to understand on paper, but so many of the details like how it is activated, who remembers what, and how it is triggered varied wildly every time it was used</br></br></br>   You now remember Jouta   <br><br><br><br>Soft and Wet would like a word with you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That one is almost as misunderstood as Heaven's Door.</br>  <br>I'd never forget this magnificent man</br>  <br>I don't understand, he's pretty straightforward, which makes me think I misunderstood it.<br><br>Doesn't it effectively slow down the brains of every animal so their perception of time is slowed and time seems to go faster?<br><br>But instead of actually doing that, what speeds up is the universe in itself and keeps life in a stasis so they don't age, and as it reaches infinite speedup the universe reaches the big crunch and everything is reworked again?<br><br>Yeah spelling this out makes me think I really didn't understand it at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> part 1 <br>I would describe it more as Great Expectations crossed with Dracula, sunlight kung-fu and Titanic, myself</br></br>  <br>that's actually a way I never thought about it before, and it makes somewhat more sense....I think. Still a weird stand though imo</br>  <br>Made in Heaven just speeds time up by an amount equal to the sum of the users Gayness x Priestliness. <br><br>The reset was unintended but broke logic.</br></br></br>  <br> Doesn't it effectively slow down the brains of every animal so their perception of time is slowed and time seems to go faster? <br>No.<br><br> But instead of actually doing that, what speeds up is the universe in itself and keeps life in a stasis so they don't age, and as it reaches infinite speedup the universe reaches the big crunch and everything is reworked again? <br><br>Yes. Basically, it makes time go very fast but doesn't affect living things. Life isn't kept in stasis so much as the death/rebirth of the universe happened in seconds.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spin off with the adventures of VAMPIRE BANANA MAN and his trusty sidekick GAY PRIEST when  I thought that once MiH reaches the reset point, everything still alive is "killed" and then reborn in the new universe.<br><br>That's why you have the 36 Kars, because the old ones survive but new ones are being reborn.</br></br>  <br> 36 kars <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;36 <br><br>explain??? is this some jorge joestar shit lol</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing is killed. The point of MiH is that people live through their lives in the fraction of a second before they're brought to the new universe. That's how everyone has the weird sense of deja vu. The only people who were replaced are those that were dead before MiH reached the reset, because they couldn't be brought over but were needed because of fate.</br>  <br>I'm not saying the first happens at all, I'm just saying that's what seems to happen from the character's perspective</br>  So was anyone else disappointed there wasn't a Sono chi No Sadame playing when Jotaro stopped time?  I wonder if Part 5 gets animated they will do King Crimson well<br><br>they should understand it first</br></br>  <br>Same here</br>  <br>That gif works better with ZA WARUDO.</br>  <br>They'll add some explanation.<br>The problem with King Crimson is that it's impossible to explain it and still keep it threatening at all, he's such a shitty stand that's only menacing because of its secondary Epitaph. But if you don't explain it you can't tell what the fuck is happening.</br></br>  <br>4 Blu-Ray disks worth of episodes to explain him and the animeonly still won't get it.</br>  <br>Can't wait for the entire episode of Pucci trying to explain Heavy Weather.</br>  So...<br>Kujo = Jotaro Kujo<br>Jo = Josuke Higashikata<br>(Jo)sefu = Joseph Joestar<br>Ni = JohnNY Joestar (a bit of a stretch, maybe)<br><br>Almost all of the Jojos in one name.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First Araki needs to understand it.</br>  <br>He's Josefu MI M</br>  <br>Oh, I misread that. I even realized that Joline is still a Kujo, so only Giorno was missing but... whatever. I still think that "Josefu" stands for Joseph.</br>  <br>That's how Joseph is pronounced in Japanese but there's a mi on the end so he's not called Joseph and it's basically a moot point for it.</br>  <br>I'm not saying he's called Joseph, I'm saying that the "Josefu" part of his name is meant to REFERENCE Joseph, just like the "Jo" written with the same kanji as part 2 Josuke is a reference.</br>  <br>  part 2 Josuke <br>Shit, I meant part 4 Josuke.</br></br>  You're allowed to rename one stand. Which stand is that and what do you name it as?<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vgi<wbr>DcJi534Y</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Hey Ya to Buckethead, because naming the stand the same as the horse is just lazyness.</br>  Kira<br> had beautiful hands <br> collected his fingernail clippings <br> did extremely lewd and brutal things to women <br> was a shady dude <br> is the brother of Kyou <br><br>Josefumi<br> was the lover of Karera <br> looks pretty soft  <br><br>Where does Holly fit into all this? Who is Josefumi?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;did extremely lewd and brutal things to women <br>That was Sasame, not Kira.</br></br>  <br> was the lover of Karera <br><br>It was unrequited back then, though they did kiss at least once. He wasn't interested in a relationship with her.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm really glad it wasn't done. It would have been an overused gimmick if it had been repeated, and honestly the theme of the fight doesn't seem to match the song (maybe it's because it's dark, or something else, or maybe it's because I just wouldn't want it done twice, I'm not sure). It does seem fitting to have that important song to tie together the actual end of Dio (even though Dio has a lasting effect shown in later parts), but the end of part 2 fight with the volcano just seemed to fit so much better since there was a long time for it to be played, and it was just such an epic, lucky ending. Maybe the song shows the end of hamon, idk...lol</br>  <br>No, Sasame was trying to attack Kira himself, not knowing he had already died. The photoalbum of lewd acts was done by Kira, I believe....</br>  <br>Sono Chi No Sadame means "Destiny of your/that blood".<br>Finishing Kars doesn't really fit. Finally killing DIO does.</br></br>  <br>nevermind I'm wrong, fuck my post</br>  <br>Yeah I agree with you there totally.<br><br>The way the fight went though, I don't think sticking the song in there would have been good. But this is probably from me just already really enjoying the Part 2 ending with the song, and not wanting a similar ending repeated.</br></br></br>  <br>The song is a loud and triumphant one, much like Joseph is after gloating and cheering seeing Kars shot up into the sky. The song just doesn't seem to match Jotaro's personality, which I think is generally fairly calm and controlled (even when angered, or at least he doesn't express himself much).</br>  <br>You know, Josuke could probably go for a harem ending if he didn't reject everyone but his waifu so completely.<br><br>Karera at the very least doesn't seem like the kind of girl who'd be entirely against sharing.</br></br></br>  <br>are you saying classy karera is a whore?</br>  Is there a storytime of the latest chapter in the archive?  <br><br> Jojo plays with his balls <br> girl likes that and rescues him <br> has fetish for hooked men <br> stays at strange man's house <br> Jealous cuck <br> fight people who are rockhard </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the original Josuke will never have a waifu <br><br>If Okuyasu can more than make up for that, then that makes him better than Speedwagon.</br></br></br>  <br>Josuke is gay.</br>  <br>He can still have a waifu.</br>  Does anyone have that picture of Joseph running from DIO with a transparent background?    What is your excuse for not reading the manga raw? From what I see there are small hiragana/katakana near the kanji. It's completly readable and at this point you should know basic japanese already.  <br>why should I know basic japanese already?</br>  <br>hello newfag</br>  What are the "fura" SFX supposed to mean?  <br> I thought he was eating her out </br>  <br>http://thejadednetwork.com/sfx/brow<wbr>se/fura_fura/<br><br>She's staggering around like she's drunk for some reason.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Like what? Like black people?</br>  <br>How is anyone who doesn't understand moon supposed to know that?<br>HWMN should just leave the sound effects alone and not even typeset if they're not going to translate them.</br></br>  <br> implying that wasn't going to be her payment for growing the guy's hair back <br><br>Doujins when?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, friend.</br>  I did an "episode" prediction for a part 4 anime and I arrived at 58 episodes. Did anyone else try this? (Don't tell me I'm autistic, I've already gone way beyond autism)<br><br> mfw Tarzan Boy is one of the EDs </br></br>  <br>I'm sure you could come up with a more appropriately creative scenario for a Jojo character.<br><br>Too bad the answer to the question is still never.</br></br></br>  <br>They finally stopped using the 「weeb quotation marks」 so they're making some progress.</br>  <br> I'm a little scared to get creative with the girl whose stand is "make hair grow rapidly anywhere she wants". I don't need any more fetishes. </br>  Jesus fuck.  <br>King Crimson causes frame skips/game stuttering IRL<br><br>there, that's how KC works</br></br></br>  <br>and just to clarify, let's say at any time during that time that was skipped, if Diavolo's arm got cut off, he would still have his arm because anything that happened during the time skip was erased??</br>  <br>No. <br><br><br>Extremely bad example</br></br></br></br>  <br> Valentine's stand can go to alternate universes <br> therefore there are alternate universes <br> therefore SBR and Ireneverse are not necessarily the same universe <br> therefore all the evidence pointing to it not being the same universe means that it's not the same universe <br>pretty fucking simple</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127294510 <br>Not that anon, but here it goes again<br><br><br> Diavolo sees what is about to occur within the next 10 seconds with Epitaph <br> something happens <br> Diavolo activates KC and goes into his own little plane of existence in which he can see the entire 10 seconds happening at once <br> Diavolo can move freely in this plane <br> Diavolo avoids whatever or does his thing <br> everyone/everything else does whatever they were doing as if nothing different had happened <br> 10 seconds are up <br> the time in which KC was active gets collapsed into one point <br> confusion </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ahh thanks, that makes sense. Still weird of course</br>  <br>To make it even more confusing, the way I understand his power, due to how he sees his little plane of existence, he could move "back and forth" in time, so-to-speak, within the 10 seconds KC is active for.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127294510 <br> :D <br><br>Stop posting.</br></br></br>  <br>But how did Buccellati see and hit himself?</br>  If part 8 ever gets animated I think Karera would be voiced by Yuu Kobayashi.  <br>that would fall under confusion. <br><br>Besides the traditional araki answer, i'd go with because he's technically dead. but that doesn't make much sense</br></br></br>  So what do you think Josefumi's stand was?<br>Considering that Gappy's stand is a mix of it and Kira's exploding bubble Killer Queen it was probably something that stole concepts.</br>  Someone explain how Narancia got impaled in the skipped time  <br>Her powers could be pretty freaky.<br><br>Imagine she sees someone scratching their ear or rubbing their eyes and makes thick hair grow there.</br></br></br>  <br>Soft and Wet is a stand that 「steals」concepts and stores them in a bubble.<br><br>Killer Queen is a stand that 「destroys」things by using bubbles.<br><br>However, what if we think of Soft and Wet as a Stand that temporarily 「destroys」 one thing, and 「creates」it somewhere else?<br><br>That would leave Josefumi's stand as a stand of 「creation」.  Something similar to Gold Experience? <br><br>However this is probably needlessly complex and Occam's Razor suggests it's just that it really steals.  no dignity </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm betting it's SBRverse Heaven's Door.<br>Instead of being able to rip out someone's memories, it can rip out aspects of a living being when they stare into his birthmark.<br><br>Since Killer Queen's explosive bubbles can affect inanimate objects by nature of, you know, exploding, S&amp;W's bubbles can also steal aspects from inanimate objects like walls and floors.<br><br>I'm very likely wrong, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Though if Araki's writing is as predictable as ever, it'll probably be just some completely random power like growing your toenails indefinitely if you see your own face.</br></br>  <br>Would that be the equivalent of Hey Ya to Kira?<br><br>That's basically infinite luck if he gazes into a mirror.<br><br>Never underestimate the power of bullshit stands anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it creates <br> implying soft+wet isn't simply crazy diamond+Killer queen with the stray cat variant. </br></br>  <br>I hope voiced player card lines return for EOH because I'd really like to hear what voices they'd pick for her or Jobin or Tsurugi.</br>  <br>Fuck, finally.</br>  <br>If Killer Queen has gotten a few tweaks, Crazy Diamond probably will have as well. Repairing doesn't fully fit.</br>  <br><br>But he got the power after his death.<br>So it's like Hey Ya combined with Notorious B.I.G</br></br></br>  Riddle me this guys. If Diavolo is not part of his predictions how did he see himself getting canceled by GER in the last fight when he threw a punch?  <br>Yeah that pretty much hits the nail on the head there</br>  <br>GER set "making sense" and "preserving continuity" to zero.</br>  <br>No, it's retarded</br>  <br>FemGiorno is cute!<br><br>C U T E</br></br></br>  If KC cannot attack in the skipped time why did he use a chop against GER in the first place?  <br>Dude, Part 4 is about as long as Part 3, and they can cut the "good times" episodes like Pearl Jam, 48 episodes is the way to go.<br><br>One of the EDs should be All Star</br></br></br>  <br>I could swear Diavolo CAN'T really move, it's just visual and he ends up in the same position he starts the stand attack</br>  <br>I have absolutely no idea how this works. His left hand has to touch something, and then his right hand turns into whatever his left touches? But then how did the handcuff materialize inside the officer's jaw?</br>  <br>Nah man, Part 4 is three volumes longer than Part 3. That's worth several more episodes.</br>  <br> Sandman had a stand from the start <br>wat</br></br>  <br> literally just told you "about as long" and that some stuff can be cut while preserving the storyline   even though I'd hate it, but japs probably want to keep 24 ep seasons </br>  <br>He does some weird shit to get to the top of the pillar apparently, I missed it too</br>  <br>But it makes sense to call him the same as the horse, that way he can talk to it in public without attracting too much suspicion</br>  <br>Soft &amp; Wet has to get it's plunder attribute from somewhere. But I'm not convinced Josefumi is really Josuke's other half due to the eye problem.</br>   just got up to date <br> check ffnet to see if there are some cool fanfictions <br> only one over 50k words <br><br>What the fuck, how do you make a 30 year old manga without getting thousands of good fanfiction?<br><br><br>do you honestly think poco gives a shit about that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Being Karera is suffering  <br>Considering how anal they've been about faithfully adapting JoJo I doubt they'd cut anything besides a few scenes (Parts 1 and 2 had a few scenes missing).</br>  <br>Season 2 of stardust didn't need to be 2 episodes per fight, quite a bit could have been cut down.</br>  <br>How many episodes would 3 episodes be? They might either extend the amount of episodes per season or shorten it to have another season, if you know what I mean</br>  i pretty much worked backwards on this using the info given about kira. since he's pretty much a combo of, you know, kira and...jotaro or whatever i figured that gappy's other half has a good chance of being a combo if they're someone we already sorta technically kinda know. which they are, given that josefumi is basically a 'new' version of josuke if the looks are anything to go by. josefumi's looks are sorta what tipped me off to begin with, and then i thought back to how new kira was implemented. his stand was still killer queen, but it made like exploding bubbles or some shit, so it's been established that stands are most likely a combination of various stands from arc 4. gappy's stand is also a combination of killer queen's bubble shit and something from josefumi's stand that lets it remove 'things' from stuff. at least, i'm assuming this, because him sharing the bubble thing with kira was pretty obvious and it stands to reason that gappy's stand is literally just a fucked-up mishmash of the stands of his two halves just like he's a fucked-up mishmash of them.<br><br>anyways, i was thinking as to what stand could do some 'removal' shit that was most likely in arc 4, and the answer was really goddamn obvious. okuyasu's hand is like 100% right on the money and i'm pretty fucking confident that josefumi was sort of a mix of josuke and okuyasu. he probably still had crazy diamond (if killer queen is any clue) but chances are it did some weird shit like 'removing' stuff from things which isn't too far of a stretch when you consider crazy diamond, i guess. like i said, josefumi's looks also kinda made me think this, because to me he kinda looks like he has a combo of okuyasu's and josuke's hair and i guess something about his posture made me think of okuyasu. honestly this is all some minor theory shit but it's fun to consider that gappy is like a big, weird combo of jotaro/kira/josuke/okuyasu.</br></br>  <br>Sweet fucking lord cuteposting is everywhere.</br>  <br>Jorge Joestar</br>  <br>Gappy's "removal" is more like transferring but he doesn't have to transfer the property removed onto something and the removed property returns eventually. <br><br>The Hand just sort of erases things.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Diavolo could lend Epitath's power to other people, like he did with Doppio<br><br>Bruno was seeing his path, 10 seconds from then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's used to rejection from JoJos.</br>  <br>I thought that wasn't translated yet. I just like reading so I like to read long, even mediocre, fanfiction about stuff I liked. But there's fucking nothing except Dio/Jotaro slash, fucking hell. I don't read this shit for the romance.</br>  <br>When time is skipped, everything within that period gets erased and everybody warps to where they will be 10 seconds in the future. <br><br>Narancia was never "stabbed" by the bars, but she did end up with them inside her body.</br></br></br>  <br>There's also Purple Haze Feedback</br>  <br>Maybe. 1 episode was usually equal to 3-4 chapters in Stardust Crusaders, although they sped up the pacing with the last three battles, and added a lot of padding to The Sun and High Priestess to fit them into the 24 episode schedule.</br>  <br> she </br>  Anyone bought those 2 volumes that came out?<br>I'm considering getting them but I want to know if it's a shitty localisation first</br>  <br> Though if Araki's writing is as predictable as ever, it'll probably be just some completely random power <br>were you trying to be funny with this sentence?</br></br>  <br>I mean, he's not wrong.<br><br>Would Part 5 have been better if Giorno was a girl? I feel like there'd be a better interplay between Buccellati and Giorna, as opposed to Giorno having really obvious Designated Leadership Syndrome while Buccellati actually did most of the important stuff.<br><br> Also, Giorna could have romanced Narancia, thus preventing him from dying through the power of romantic interest plot armor. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Giorno should have had the power to reflect damage, no life shit. Maybe he gets an act 2 that allows him to reflect damage "back in time" to heal people too, sure.<br><br>Also a personality.</br></br></br>  <br>Josefumi most likely had some form of crazy diamond, can return stuff to it's original form and repair stuff.<br><br>Probably why gappy can mess around with objects, he can give (crazy diamond) and take (killer queen) from objects and people.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Part 3 had a fair bit of filler to reach 48 episodes though. Most episodes only covered 2-3 chapters. <br><br>If David keeps it tight with 3-4 chapters per episode, they could probably make it work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Epitaph showed that Diavolo was going to impale Narancia on them within the next 10 seconds. <br>The most KC had to do while in his time erasing procedure was ensure that whatever actions resulted in Narancia's impale happened and then erase time. <br><br>because whatever happens in erased time still actually happens, Narancia was always going to be stabbed, with or without time being erased.</br></br></br></br>   part 7 sets up an amazing alternate history <br> part 8: lol nope back to status quo also shonen author tries becoming kotaro uchikoshi in the span of two years </br>  <br> because whatever happens in erased time still actually happens, <br>that's literally the opposite of how king crimson works, the only things that change are positions</br></br>  <br>That would be equal to about 6 episodes then, which would be really odd to finish off with.<br><br>If we divide the total chapters for part 4 by 3 we get 58 episodes though, which is 10 more than the amount of episodes part 3 had.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you think they changed positions though?<br><br>Because they were moving. They had decided to go from A to C and the journey inbetween is B.<br><br>KC erases B and the journey from A to C is now AC instead of ABC.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> because whatever happens in erased time still actually happens <br>Did you zone out for the entire Metallica fight?<br><br> Aerosmith shoots at Doppio <br> the bullets go clean through Doppio during a timeskip <br> the bullets end up on the other side of Doppio after the timeskip and hit Risotto <br> Doppio is fine because the bullets never actually hit him <br><br>Now if the bullets had settled in his gut instead of going through him, Doppio would have been hurt. Because that's where the bullets would have ended up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, exactly, I'm just saying, "whatever happens in erased time still actually happens", whatever happens in erased time=B</br>  <br>It's pretty good.<br>You have the Blueford name stuff, but overall it's okay.</br></br>  <br>The bullets were moving, the bars were just there.</br>  <br>Because King Crimson is allowed to move during the deleted time regardless of it being eventually being deleted. His user is the only person who can act with agency during this time. Epitaph shows him that the bullets will hit him, he begins to erase time, moves out of the way of them and then erases time. The bullets appear to go through him because he moves out of their way.</br>  Why do people forget that Gappy is as much Kira as he is Josefumi?<br>Everyone seems to think he's just Josefumi</br>  <br> he begins to erase time, moves out of the way of them and then erases time. <br>do you just make this shit up?</br></br>  <br>Re-read VA</br>  The way I read KC's power is that things stop, he sees things on a sliding scale, and then picks the appropriate place to start up again.  <br> Reading Vento Aureo more than once <br>No, thank you. Can I read Diamond is not crash instead?</br></br>  <br>Well, he does say Josefumi is his "true name" in this chapter so people who haven't paid enough attention just go with what he says. His character development will surely be about accepting himself as a new person though so they'll get it eventually.</br>  <br>Because he's not? The Wall Eyes only swap out some parts of things, they don't completely physically merge. The living Gappy is Josefumi with some parts of Kira swapped in, but there's also a corpse found in the same spot that is clearly recognizable as Kira. Ergo, Gappy is mostly Josefumi with just enough of Kira to make him a new person.</br>  <br>dont they usually up the contrast when cleaning panels after getting replacing moonrunes with english? It hides obvious edits better and if you do it to one page you have to do it to the rest for consistency</br>  Why does the picture of them make Kira look so much to gappy I get that they look extremely similar but at the same time from what we've seen of Kira his face looks very different than gappy. He looks so much like him that its hard to believe that bum lady recognized him as anything but Kira  <br>What if... There's only one of them?</br>   art is total shit except for the sameface close-ups <br> perspective errors everywhere <br> cheap and lazy (if any) backgrounds <br><br>Get your shit together Araki</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's mostly same-face striking again and Araki not being able to change Kira's design now to make him more distinct from Josuke.<br><br>Kira should probably have been designed to be more significantly different from the beginning.</br></br></br>  <br>Whatever one of them touches something with his left hand, it's decomposed and reforms itself from his rock stump.<br><br>The other one may have a different ability.</br></br></br>  <br>He can't as long as he keeps jacking it to greek sculpture anatomy and drawing Johnny and Lucy ad infinitum.</br>  <br>That panel is from a long time ago and Josuke himself himself has changed a lot since then too. The difference was always in the eyes.</br>  <br>Araki was never good with his art, if you want good art go read Berserk.</br>  <br> louvre <br> was never good with his art <br><br>He's great at anatomy, the problem is that he's not great at anatomies</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you trying to make new chapter releases a replacement for Friday shitposting now that the anime has ended?</br>  <br>If it was the Ireneverse, Funny Valentine wouldn't have found Diego with The World, it would have been Dio.</br>  <br>Chapter discussions are a lot better than friday anime shitposting</br>  <br>Hobo Lucy is a tramp.</br>  The football twins look extremely generic.  <br>Hey Ya is just incredibly perceptive and maps out the best routes. It can notice crazy stuff like the dead cow ahead and figure out how it will move when jumped on, but still can be tricked by stuff it wouldn't know about. Like how the Spin will affect that rocky chasm Gyro and Johnny run across.</br>  I haven't read this in a while. What happened to that naked chick at the beginning? Did she ever reappear?  <br> football <br>I want non-americans to leave</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>you dumb, bro</br>  <br>She's not a thing like Lucy and we don't really have any proof of her being loose yet either.</br>  I personally think Araki's biggest problems is that he doesn't seem to like drawing ugly characters anymore and that he has way too big a boner for the "looking straight ahead, lips slightly parted" face.<br><br>Other than that I still like his artwork.</br></br>  <br>He was pretty decent at the end of 3 / start of 4. It started to become worse again when he changed the style. Part 8 went full retard. Everyone in motion looks like someone having a cramp while trying to hold up white hula hoops or leaning against white pipes.</br>  <br>He could also be mostly Kira with some parts of Josefumi swapped in too. Like, he physically resembles Josefumi because he got most of his body (explaining why Kira still looks mostly like Kira), but has more of Kira's personality than Kira, who was left with most of Josefumi's personality. That would mean Kira is "more alive" than Josefumi in mind but not in body, leaving us with a psychologically redeemed Kira.</br>  <br> he doesn't seem to like drawing ugly characters anymore <br>How about the twins in this very chapter, or Joshuu, or half the background characters? Tsurugi is sometimes kinda cute but most of the time he's a pretty weird-looking fucker too.</br></br>  <br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br>  <br>and this implies diavolo didn't side step them how? especially considering the fact he can move in this time is established in VA</br>  When were the part 3 bluerays supposed to come out? And has david said if they'd have increased quality?  <br>I don't think the twins were ugly. Tsurugi and Joshuu are disgusting though</br>  <br>The very beginning of 4 might be my least favorite of all. Everyone had a Frankenstein's monster thing going on and it almost felt like he made everyone's clothes super baggy just so he could do completely random things with their anatomy.</br>  <br>will Joshuu ever have a decent facial expression in part 8?</br>  <br>You know, I hadn't thought about Okuyasu. It would make sense that there were some removal properties in Killer Queen, given his ability to accurately destroy singular places in Holly's brain, and since the Nijimura connection comes from his sister Kyou, it's possible the bubbles deleted rather than exploded.</br>  <br><br><br><br> that retard from 9 hours ago is still around to defend shitty art <br><br>jesus christ</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and this implies diavolo didn't side step them how? <br>It doesn't. It doesn't imply that he sidestepped them either. <br><br>You're making shit up</br></br></br></br>  <br>but he has a 98% DNA match with Kira</br>  <br>Actually he has a 98% DNA match with the other result of the fusion. The corpse wasn't just Kira either.</br>  <br><br><br>You can stop now.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they could do it. Let's Go Eat Italian is four chapters and I could totally see that condensed to one episode.</br>  <br>The best part is that it looks like  was just laughing at that guys's description of Araki's art.</br>  <br><br>HOLY SHIT STOP I'M GOING TO PISS MY PANTS OVER HOW FUNNY THIS IS</br></br>  <br>This is kindergarten level of shitposting, anon.</br>  Will we ever see a non-japanese team?  <br>There should be a possibility for that. Didn't Miho have a German friend?</br>  <br>No idea, where was this mentioned?</br>  <br>Girls und Panzer: Little Army</br>  <br>That's can only happen if/when they want to do a world senshado championship.</br>  They eat Italian food, close enough.  I would like to see a college team. Supposedly that's a thing.

Anyone got pics of this?  Does this mean they're gonna redo the reveal?  I haven't even seen one picture yet ;_; Everyone's just showing off the merch they bought.  <br>Is the first movie worth watching? I dropped the anime in episode 12, and only read the manga.</br>  <br>Probably not.</br>  <br>Only Levi's OVA i though it was shit but NOT!</br>  I NEED to see the 2nd compilation.  I recorded a part on the movie theater but I'm not so sure if I should show it up.  I don't care about any of this I just want to see more info on S2.  <br>Take the risk.</br>  To the anon saying the CR translations were shit and not the official, kodansha's and CR's translations are pratically the same.  <br>The fact that CR sometimes fuck up it's because they have to release the chapter on the same day it's released on nipland, so sometimes they don't have too much time to revise it. But if there's an error, they will fix it.</br>  <br>Here's another example.</br>    Chinkfag here. <br>You'll be happy to know that I got my scanner fixed and I'm in japan for the weekend. I actually recorded the two exclusive scenes from the upcoming season. The first is of Mr. Hanji and Pastor nick, and the other is an new anime-only clip of a super gay BR scene. BRfujos are in for a treat.<br><br>It's almost done uploading and I'll post the link in about half an hour from now. 敬请关注</br></br></br>  <br>Tsundere as fuck.</br>  <br>Isn't your recorder on fire?</br>  <br>It's his scanner.</br>  <br>Nah man, it's good now.</br>  <br>But it's for the mov- nevermind.</br>  <br>I read the VN and I skipped many scenes in the OVA(s), pretty lame how they made little big changes between sources.</br>  <br>Also CR and Kodansha are obviously partners, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's the translators from kodansha are the ones who do the CR's translations.</br>  <br>True Chinkfag here, he's a fake, I don't live in moonland.</br>  Oh shit. I forgot to tell you guys that their was a fuckload of YH and EA pandering as well. It might take a little longer.  <br>Liar.</br>  <br>How I wish. Judging by twitter, there was nothing worth mentioning in the movie. I wonder why they aren't at least talking about that Annie vs Mikasa scene.</br>  The film added all the extra EA scenes the anime was missing including Annie offering to teach him.<br><br>Hanji's scene with Nick was the extra scene but not the dangling part, not yet. They're probably saving that.<br><br>Nifa's hair is red<br><br> tfw having red hair and liking manlet is a death sentence </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nifa is not even in S1.</br>  <br>She was seen during the Hanji and Nick part. Her hair is Isabel red.</br>  <br>It's going to be the new LP.</br>  <br>They also apparently made Nifa's hair bright red like Isabel's. Araki really wants to stretch out the manlet manpain.</br>  <br> Niffa a redehead <br>  Is like pottery  <br>Being manlet is pure suffering</br></br></br>  <br> Nifa's hair is red <br><br>It is not. I saw it.</br></br></br>  <br> that picture <br>Wow, the art style has changed a lot since then.</br></br>  <br>They also added the flashback in 44 of annie and mikasa getting read to fight in the beginning.</br>  <br>Watch Araki cut out all scenes of Eren and Historia talking to promote his waifu Mikasa instead.</br>  How many imoutos has Levi had killed already? 4?  <br>Isabel, Petra, Nifa, who else? Was there someone before Isabel?</br>  I like how the anime team has the tactic of adding an unusual hair color to random background characters to boost their popularity and it's amazing how well it works.  <br> Kuchel.  She was a imouto. </br>  Isn't Sasha red haired too?  <br>Kushel is the more of ones.</br>  How long untill volume 17's cover is leaked?<br> Inb4 it will have EHL in it. </br>  http://imgur.com/a/liTW6<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/gZSnO</br></br>  <br>Chuugakkou Bert is so great</br>  <br> Nifa's hair is red <br> Scenes with Manlet <br><br>Her popularity will rise even higher.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nifa will be the Petra 2.0</br>  <br>She already is. The anime will just boost it, while nobody cares about the rest of Hanji's squad.</br>  <br>Anime team will do an OAD with nifa past.</br>  <br>Now that's overrated.</br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>Annie means the world  to me <br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Cabaneli too!</br>  <br>50 posts late, bro.</br>  <br>Sorry about that, threads keep being made at 3-5 AM in my timezone. ;_; It's never too late to love Annie.</br>  Comfy chapter before the arc starts for real?  THE EXTRA SCENE <br><br> The newly added scene ended up being a flashback placed at the beginning of the movie. It was a more fleshed-out and symbolism heavy version of the Eren/Annie sparring scene. It also included some of the Eren &amp; Annie moments from the manga that were left out, like her offering to teach Eren her moves. The purpose seemed to be to give us a good look at Annie’s fighting stance right off the bat (with this and all the other Annie scenes they left in, they definitely made it way less ambiguous who the identity of the FT is) as well as perhaps cutting Eren a little more slack as to why he was so reluctant to accept Annie as the spy, because of their bonding time. There’s also a “cliffhanger” end to the flashback, when Mikasa asks Annie to teach her the moves too and so the girls are about to face-off with each other while the question, “Annie vs Mikasa… Who will win?” is left hanging in the air. <br><br><br>The season 2 cut scene<br><br>They turned it into a stinger scene during the end credits and is the scene from the manga when Hange interrogates Nick in chapter 34 (from approximately pg 12, when the soldiers are gawking at the wall titan, until pg 26 when Hange says ねぇ… ニック司祭？壁って全部巨人でできてるの？ (Hey Priest Nick? Are all the walls made with titans?) If you read those pages you can imagine it well, because it was exactly like that. I also noticed Hange’s squad was there, including Nifa, who has bright Isabel-like cherry red hair.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It also included some of the Eren &amp; Annie moments from the manga that were left out, like her offering to teach Eren her moves <br>The smile. Did she smile?</br></br>  Nips are complaining about the OST, they put the ending during a sequence from episode 17, and there's basically no insert song in the movie. And too many silent moments?   you'll never fuck yuu kobayashi   Isayama drew the endcard of Arlsan Senki  <br>Will Manlet ever have an imout who isn't kill?</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Mikasa &amp; Hange.</br>  <br> he doesn't know yuu kobayashi <br>You should fuck off</br></br>  <br>He sure have come a long way, this art actually looks decent.</br>  <br>It always looks decent when he's not rushing it.</br>  <br>Here it finally looks like a shounenesque art.</br>  <br>When will we sew redhead boys in this series?

Who will win the Annie?</br>  <br> Crystal. </br>  <br>Still no release date.</br>  <br>This reminds me of Project Arms for some reason.</br>  <br>Isayama is very inspired by that manga according from what I read of his own Wiki page.</br>  <br>Because it's for ARMS. Isayama drew it for Ryōji Minagawa. He's a huge fan, and they even did a collaboration (the Killing Pawn)</br>  <br>Heh. No wonder then, thanks for the info.</br>  with this supreme court ruling on gay marriage, do you think isayama will gather the courage to go full lgbt and not back down again like he did with this ridiculous eren x historia shit?  <br>He doesn't live in the USA.</br>    <br>Anon, Isayama lives in Japan.

She mostlt is not needed.</br>  Out of the dungeon.  <br>oh shit, she left like 2 days before didn't she? I can't believe I forgot that</br>  <br>Freyja also not present i'm dissapointed. It's will be better with proper closure but probably the action and animation takes too much budget for proper ending party or explanation about bells skill.</br>  <br>  implying kirito is not beta </br>  So, can all we agree that vanilla is best flavor?  <br>He can one shot kill goliath level 5 florr boss he is not beta.</br>  <br>I prefer my icecream to be chocolate and mocha flavored.</br>  So it's confirmed in lastest eps that bell stronger than ryuu and mostly at average level 5 adventurer.  S2 when?  But really, is Vanilla actually the best flavor?<br>Or is chocolate objectively superior?</br>  <br>Beru-kun would still get raped by Ryuu and a lot of other adventurers, but he has a nuke for when shit hits the fan.</br>  <br>Vanilla all the way, brother.</br>  <br><br>That sag...</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Never.</br>  <br>What do you mean.

So do 500 people there.</br>   there are people on /a/ RIGHT NOW who wouldn't fuck Hestia <br><br>Explain yourself, homosexuals.</br></br>  <br>500 is over kill. Probably 1 hundred people.</br>  <br><br>It depends whether she is going to be clingy afterwards. She is completely dependent.</br></br>  <br>Not enough source material.</br>  <br>Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag.</br>  <br>Scrap this i missed the ending scenes.</br>  <br> literally 4 to 5 better looking girls in the same show <br> ''hurr everyone should like Hestia'' </br></br>  <br><br>You have 10 seconds to name a single better better than Bestia Hestia.<br><br>That's right, you can't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They killed Goliath at the 17th floor and went up.</br>  <br>Bell is shit compared to her, she dealt most of the damages with her magic, Bell could charge Argonaut because he was protected, and his allies had done most of the work.</br>  <br>No, have you even seen the anime bell completely obliterated goliath with itd full powered regen still intact. Ryuu cannot even pierce that meat.</br>  <br>Ryuu is merely distractor like the rest of the people there.</br>  <br><br>I don't care about your stupid opinion. I won't even try to state the obvious anymore.</br></br>    <br>Are you stupid. Please watch carefully or try lurking before posting. It's that clear in the anime where the regen try protect the core luckyly bell agi is very high to give a final blow before covered by the regen.</br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Aiz but I feel guilty trying to fuck an autistic girl.</br></br>  <br>Your opinion is stupid and I am not even one of those guys you replied to.</br>  <br>Bell.</br>  <br><br>Bell isn't a woman.</br></br>  <br>No, he's not, your point?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah, samefag.</br></br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>Is okay if you're autistic yourself?</br>  <br>  more than 1 people disagreeing with you, it's must be samefag <br>Nice logic you have there.<br>Newfag pls</br></br></br>  <br>Sure thing bro.</br>  <br>fug</br>  <br>Can't argue with that.</br>  <br>Is there any info what skill bell used against goliath? He make himself pure white or emit light on his entire body.</br>  <br>Argonaut. Now fuck off.</br>  <br>nobody know waht the fuck hapening in this ep</br>  <br>Argonaut cannot make his entire body pure white. It's mostly emit light on his weapon peak if it skill attack or in one of his hand if it's charged firebolt.</br>  Where was the giant skelator?  <br>It's easy. It just mean bell is stronger than any level 4 and mostly stronger than average level 5 adventurer. Espescially in terms of power.</br>  <br>Goliath without full armored regen is in form of skull. The flesh is its shield.</br>  Smelling her armpits in the corner  The sexual tension between these two is unbearable. Can anyone spoil me when will they fuck in the novels?  <br>One brings the toys, the other brings the beer</br>  <br> sexual tension <br><br>They're both straight, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Straights is nonexistent species in the anime world.</br>  <br><br>And one of them is elf, so it doesn't count as straight or homo.</br></br>  https://twitter.com/hegame/status/6<wbr>14474394509799424<br><br>Anime producer, editor, and LN twitter account making bait post about animating Oratoria.</br></br></wbr>  Does anyone have a quoted version of the incantation they were saying in full?  <br>Adhd avatar. ...nice</br>  this shit is so bad it's not even funny<br><br>i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people</br></br>  <br> i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people <br>You haven't read Zhan Long where the chinese MC university student takes on roughly 20 elite usa special forces and wins by killing most of them and taking the others prisoner for interrogation. The MC even does better in the game. Unlike a lot of other stories, this MC also has a lot of patriotic power leveling activity outside the game.</br></br>  <br> implying you know what the author hasn't explicitly explained </br>  <br>Just like every anime ever right? Fuck off.</br>  Surprised they didn't show Freya either, I still liked the ending but it really needs a sequel.  So how exactly does Argonaut work? Assuming it isn't a chargeable "I win" button  <br>Not really an "I win" attack, but it is basically a charge based on desire to win/time that significantly boosts his attack power, balanced by an extremely long cooldown.<br><br>In terms of adventurer abilities, it's not hugely impressive, but it definitely has utility.</br></br></br>  <br>It is a charge, but not I win.<br><br>The one he used against Argonaut took 3 minutes of charge up time, which for all intents and purposes are too long to be worthwhile in most fights. When he went against the Goliath in volume 8 again, without Ryu and Asufi, they can't do shit against the boss (which is only Level 4 compared to this one) and was actually on the losing side. Argonaut has an insane drawback that is supposed to drain all your stamina, so he is a sitting duck for a while after using it (depending on the charge time).<br><br>It wasn't until Tsubaki (Level 5) came that they could win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The one he used against Argonaut <br>The one he used against Goliath***</br></br>  <br> not hugely impressive <br> let him one shot a level 5 area boss just after turning level 2 </br></br>  <br>I thought the point was his first shot did jack shit? <br>And even after the rest of the group did their shit his second shot wasn't enough to finish it. <br><br>Didn't Aiz actually solo a level 5 boss by herself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>His first shot obliterated everything it hit. He just stupidly aimed at the head that quickly regenerated.<br><br>Isn't Aiz level 6 though?</br></br></br>  <br>Ryuu looks like she can solo a normal Goliath herself</br>  <br>Welf did more damage than Bell that fight.<br><br>Ryuu and Asfi were undisputed MVPs there though. <br><br>All Bell did was get the final hit, which in turn let him hog all the glory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1. It didn't one shot the boss. The boss did not die after the hit, and was in the process of regenerating. If Bell wasn't quick thinking while everyone was retardedly going "oh no", it would've just come back.<br><br>2. If it was just Bell v. Goliath, or Bell with Welf and Lili v. Goliath, they all would've died. He only had the time to cast due to 2 Level 4's, another Level 2, and a strong magic item (along with every other adventurer on that floor) distracting the Goliath.<br><br>3. Compared to the other, higher level adventurers, it's a very unimpressive power, it's just an attack power boost, and those are a dime a dozen. Lefiya at Level 3 gets to break one of the rules of adventurers and can cast any number of magic spells, albeit with some restrictions. Most other adventurers are hard-capped at 3 spells.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ever played Monster Hunter? Do you know how Great Swords work?<br><br>A full charged greatsword will outdamage weapons a bit above them and can do more damage in one swing. That's the Argonaut ability in a nutshell.<br><br>And Bell still didn't kill Goliath with it, just exposed the magic stone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he isn't. In a fight he'd be destroyed by any lvl 3+ adventurer, they have better stats and abilities. His nuke won't do shit since he wouldn't have time to charge it and even if he would, he'd probably never be able to hit them with it.</br>  <br><br>Is DanMachi an accurate depiction of Monster Hunter?</br></br>  <br>It's been already explained in the previous threads.<br><br>The boss has a regeneration ability that's based on its mana. So to kill it, first you have to drain the mana.<br><br>Even though it looked like it was regenerating all the time, at the same time its mana reserves were being depleted.<br><br>At the end when everyone used their strongest skill was when it took the largest hits to its mana pool, Welfs OP sword being the last straw.<br><br>All Bell did was the final blow at a point where the boss couldn't regenerate.<br><br>The crystal scene is anime original.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't when she did it, it's how she got to level 6.</br>  <br> fairlyoddparents.webm </br>  <br>Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom.</br>  <br>hestia.dance</br>  I just learned a Light Novel, is actually a Nirmal novel with a picture inserted every couple of pages. It's for writers that never found a Manga artist to team up with them  <br>I can barely imagine Bell defeating a Velocidrome.</br>  I love how these LNs with Gary Stu protagonists always have faggots coming out of the woodworks to defend the Gary Stu in detail, saying that the Gary Stu isn't asspulling, he's taking advantage of established mechanics.<br><br>Meanwhile it's clear to anyone that the Gary Stu is asspulling and the writer makes shit up as he goes.<br><br>Touma, Kirito, ONII-SAMA, Bell-kun, same shit different face</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck is it offline?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d5I<wbr>hpNYy5Dg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Please no. They already ruined one season. If they animate Oratoria too they'll probably find a way to give Hestia more screentime than Ais, on top of ruining all of Ais's scenes and design. Hasn't the author seen the BD sales?</br>  <br> Shoehorn more Hestia into Oratoria <br><br>I don't dislike Hestia, but that would be so completely retarded dear god please no,</br></br></br>  Finished the anime, does the light novel worth reading?<br>Does the anime skip a lot of thing?</br>  <br>They already did it to the main series. What makes you think they won't do it in Oratoria?<br><br>Not to mention they've flat out said that "we don't know how to animate/draw Ais". Why then would they think it would be a good idea for them to animate Oratoria, a series that is entirely focused on Ais? Fucking greedy incompetent cunts.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean someone should "shop" a cumshot on his teeth and add the brazzers logo.</br>  So glad I wasn't turned off by the series title.<br><br>Mmm...Vanilla.</br></br>  <br>Too poor.</br>  <br>No, it's weak only able to destroy the ripped head that has been attacked numerous time. It's uncomparable to bellmore than half body attack.</br>  <br>It did one shot the boss. He already obliterated it but Regen help him survive with few hp because the attack is not focused to the real core because it's hidden.</br>  <br>No, this the longest charge because the limit off and aimed attack. In reality argonout charge is very short even bell never like he charge anything when use it.</br>  <br> implying he is </br>  <br>Yeah you're right. Plot Armor is one hell of a defense.<br><br>Get real dumbass, "Beru-kun" is a piece of pure shit who gets powerups out the ass when his shitty friends lives are on the line. It's like he's pussy mode 24/7 until a big monster comes threatening MUH FRIEZENS</br></br></br>  <br> It did one shot the boss <br> Regen help him survive <br> He survived the attack, therefore he got one shot <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So where the fuck was she? <br>You missed TWO separate anime episodes where it was stated the Loki party was heading up and out from the dungeon. The analogy from elementary school is that your reading comprehension skills need improvement. Reading comprehension used to be taught in elementary school, but with the republican party "no child left behind" act, lots of courses were made much easier by teachers and school administrators in order for their schools to look good with high GPA and high graduation rates. The higher the GP and graduation rate, the bigger your salary is how the NCLB act sums up. <br><br>Due to the NCLB, it's no wonder your comprehension skills are lacking. Such skill training was moved out of elementary school into the high school realm as optional courses for AP students. I grew up in my area, had kids, and saw how those classes were moved in our school system thru the years since NCLB. NCLB was good for the good schools as they made even more money. But almost all other schools became worse because they watered down courses in order to keep their current level of federal funding or gain more funds.<br><br>I apologize to OP if "comprehension" training in school was not the cause of your problem. But I've seen so much comprehension problem between average students of my time period and today's average students and your question fit neatly into those symptoms.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> son of mutherfucking Zeus <br>Yeah why the fuck is he so garystu?</br></br>  <br>This os not argonaut but limit off. Argonout charge is very shirt he one shot baby dragon without charging he also one kill 3 minos without passive move. His charging is as shory as he is chanting firebolt.</br>  <br>I'm getting real fucking sick of gay people.<br>Every fucking thread it's "I'm gay and everybody has to know lol"<br>Fucking faggots</br></br></br>  <br>Ryu would slice him up before he could react.<br>Remember how Aiz was destroying him with just a scabbard without even trying?</br></br>  <br> Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag. <br><br>Ice cream has been made from human milk. With Hestia's breasts you can make a lot more ice cream than from Aiz. Furthermore, I bet Hestia's milky motherly flavour is a lot better than Aiz's lean flavour. <br><br>As to what ice cream names Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream company would give to ice creams made from Aiz or Hestia's goodness, I don't know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best outfit</br>  <br>Well in anime the regen is still fully intact and full powered. So bell did one shot goliath to the half his body with its regen ability still strong.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>   Zeus is his grandfather <br> I'm so special <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>No, bell is stronger. This charge was not argonout. It's far stronger. Argonout not even need Him stand still and doing passive move. No bell is never charging anything have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br>If only it was just a meme.</br>  I really hope cute MCs become the next big thing.  <br> Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom. <br><br>It probably has been professionally done in japanese TV ads. Marketing may even insist on Bell having different types of big toothy smiles in various episodes to help the toothpaste marketing. Remember, Attack on Titan had such giant marketing that even bread shaped like titan footprints was marketed. Certainly, cleaning products were marketed due to Levi's cleaning habits.<br><br>It would be unbelievable to not have DanMachi toothpaste. I've already seen lots of toothpaste for everything from Sailor Moon to Totoro to My Little Pony. Franky Cola pepsi is allowed to have 1% alcohol in it to give it that Franky kick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell is still level 1 without argonaut and limit off and bell is not good fighting non monster because of his soft spot furthermore she is woman.</br>  <br> cute MCs <br><br>Oh please.<br><br>I believe I speak for everyone here when I say Bell-kun wasn't even that cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell and Aiz both drink alcohol (ale?) at Mama's tavern style restaurant, so Bell must be old enough to drink.</br>  <br><br> bell is not good fighting non monster <br><br>The arc that would have taken place after the anime ended is Bell fighting other adventurers. As is the arc after that, he's fairly capable in both though that's after getting even more Aiz training.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He missed the core the real body because he doesn't know but when he knew it he one stab it. It's very large area attack but it's un aimed because the core is hidden.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br>No, he is fighting it without any intention to kill. Like when he fought the hades head fighter. He doesn't use firebolt because he cannot control the damage and have big casualties</br>  <br> Attack eradicates the entire upper body down to the hips and exposes the gem, including the flesh on the opposite side of the gem from Bell. <br> A significant amount of the gem would've been in the path of Bell's attack <br> "Oh he didn't hit the gem with it" <br><br>Sure thing bro.<br><br>As retarded as that thought is, it's still more proof that Bell didn't one shot the Goliath.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's un aimed attack at very large area. It would have been different or one shot f it's more focused or consentrated attack at spesific area or target.</br>  What do you call a girl like this?  <br>He seemed not be pulling any punches during the Apollo duel, same with his big fight with Ishtar. He didn't want civilian casualties/damage, when he was running from Soma's group, but he'd still choose to use it in a pinch even though it cause property damage, and might have killed someone who couldn't flee from the now burning building.</br>  <br> Bell can aim and focus that attack <br> If it was more concentrated it would be more powerful <br> Flat-out making shit up to support your argument <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My waifu.</br>  <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>Of course he can control it. It's giant swing the core only got the damage from the far left corner attack not in the middke which is more powerful attack. Have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br> seasonal waifu <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>He has soft spot like it's shown also in the latest episode</br>  If someone is interested.<br>Lossless creditless OP - https://mega.nz/#!7E0HTB7D!YC2yufSp<wbr>gylNmf3GrgAhZ7RsETDqoaKih2sJ6TQlBLk<wbr><br>Lossless creditless ED - https://mega.nz/#!KZUEBYZJ!DzahHwgu<wbr>2tq5nncbeFq53xlbWjiWI-QmzBnVmL-QK9E<wbr><br><br>I'm also uploading the first 2 episodes, single file, but it will take at last another 8 hours.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Find me one scene that shows the Goliath "only got the damage from the far left corner attack.<br><br>Find me one line that says "the middke which is more powerful attack".<br><br>Find me anything that says or shows Bell could've focused that attack to do more damage.<br><br>You have the episode, so go get some pictures and quotes that support your argument and come back.<br><br>Otherwise, kindly shut the fuck up with your retarded assumptions and broken english.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone make a stitch of this shot yet? It seemed like a good moment for it IMO, what with the full frontal panty (leotard?) shot and slight underboob.    <br>Thanks bro</br>  <br>waiting a while to say that newfag?</br>  <br>That's a badass elf.</br>  <br><br>It's a shame this beauty is a dyke.<br>Am I the only one upset here?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br><br><br>Now in the sky, above a distant forest,<br>O Infinite stars, scattered across the cloudless night sky,<br>grant my foolish voice the blessing of starfire,<br>and grant your compassion to those who abandon you.<br><br>Bear within thee the light of stardust<br>and destroy my enemy!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>    <br>So wait, I'm reading the manga, and so part of the reason she likes Bell is because she has huge daddy issues. I mean sure she relates to Bell because she was in a similar situation to him, but you can't deny the fact that her Father looks exactly like him as well.</br>  <br>It's a futile effort to discuss any sort of settings with the Brazilian fanfictions in these threads. If Oratoria get announced, we'll be rid of them cause they're all Hestia fags.</br>  <br>I'm slowly beginning to understand this, and I wish someone had told me sooner.</br>  <br><br>It's a shame Aiz is going to lose to these literal goddesses.</br></br>  So guys is Ryu like one of the top fighter or something?<br>She is way too op.</br>  <br>She's Level 4, so she's stronger than most, but not crazy OP like the First-Class Adventurers.</br>  <br><br> Best Girl always loses.</br></br>  <br>Wait are they blood related or something?</br>  <br><br>I just see two of them.</br></br>  Season 2 when?<br><br> They can't end it like that, r-right? </br></br>  <br><br>I would not be surprised if that was revealed at some point, considering that they both lost their parents suddenly, and Aiz is probably just enough older to be able to remember her parents while Bell was probably too young. Also considering that she suppressed her memories until she saw Bell, who reminded her of her Father, It could be that she doesn't have any memories of a younger brother who was separated from her at an early age. It would be pretty fucked up if she was inducted into the Familia that helped murder her parents though.<br><br>That would also be an adequate pretext for Best Girl not winning.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering season 1 sold like shit, 2ch hated it, and JC Staff's investors are jumping ship, I think it's safe to say season 2 never.</br></br>  <br><br>Read the thread </br></br>  <br>Damn, it's not a great anime but I've had a lot of fun watching it and want to see where the story goes.</br>  <br>You know that a copypasta troll post right?</br>  <br>So where did you get that info from?</br>  How do Hestia fags feel about their character inevitably losing to Vanilla?  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/i<wbr>nvestors%20jumping%20ship/<br>Just some of the variations.</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Vanilla is probably Bunny's long lost sister though.</br></br>  <br> this fanbase is so obnoxious that they reply to pasta and ask for sauce </br>  <br> This fag replies about fags that reply about pastas <br><br>Come on man.</br></br></br>  <br> 2ch <br>Their opinion is about as relevant as /a/'s when it comes to sales.</br></br>  Is she and the shota the only ones in the guild who like Bete?  <br>She gives furfag his puss allowance, so he has to listen to her</br>  <br>Hestia is working 3 part time jobs for her Bell-kun. How is she dependent?</br>  <br><br>Bell uses most of his money in an expensive maid cafe, that scams him all the time</br></br>  <br> 3 part time jobs <br>Wait really? I thought she only works at the little stand.</br></br>  <br>She's an elf. I bet she's thirsty for some breeding.</br>  <br>She was also working for Hephaestus.</br>  <br>He starts crying when he drink to much, and we all know elves want to be the one crying during sex</br>  That was fun, but I am left itching for more.  <br>Potato stand<br>Heps shop<br>Ice cream stand</br></br></br>  How flat is too flat?  <br>Isn't she supposed to be royalty or something?<br><br>Damn slut. If there's something I know about elves, it's the fact that their princesses are the biggest crossbreeding whores in existance.</br></br></br>  https://michinium.files.wordpress.c<wbr>om/2015/03/danmachi-volume-03-v2.pd<wbr>f<br><br>I found this and I thought I'd share...Fuking LN has so little artwork</br></br></wbr></wbr>  Will this be getting a s2  <br>She likes it when he acts rough</br>  <br>why was this woman so horny for bell<br><br>I never understood it<br><br>also bell is Zeus son? so hes Hercules?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>For a mere 13% of his loot split, Riveria provides Bete a weekly handjob, bimonthly blowjob, monthly vaginal sex.</br>  <br>You really don't understand the term adopted grandfather do you?

I wish there was doujins of this slut<br> that green haired whore <br> elf princess <br>She's a walking crime bait, just baiting to be violated by men.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anime does something retarded and contrived <br> LNfags always try to defend it by explaining how it made sense in the LN <br>If an adaptation can't make itself understood without being familiar with the original then it's a pretty shit adaptation, isn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>Wow what a hideous image. Congrats on finding that, anon.</br>  Is season 1 over?  <br>maybe its a translation issue?</br>  <br>are you seriously retarded, or is this bait?</br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br>Yes, and somehow the LN is to be blamed because the anime writers want to pander to Hestia's boobs. While there is nothing wrong with pandering to generate sales, there are always retard coming in incorrectly assigning blame without watching the anime. <br><br>You should not reply to bait post in general. There's a reason why nobody responded to that guy for 5 hours.</br></br></br>  <br>  middle <br>If it's a blast or shoot. Like a bullet or arrow<br>Strike in the middle mean you are receiving all the damage and not part of it.</br></br></br>  Getting nasty with uncle black cock up in here  <br>Getting gang-banged by faceless old men in an orgy party.</br>  Such a disappointing show  Out of all the things that makes me sad that this show is ending, i think I'm really going to miss the shitposting the most ;_;  <br>How about instead of trying to shoehorn in your retarded fan theories that have no support, you just accept what was shown.<br><br> Bell charges his attack while wielding a two handed sword taken from the Loki Familia. <br><br> He centers himself in front of the Goliath, and when fully charged, rushes straight at it and swings the sword in an arc in front of him, from his right to left, targeting the Goliath's upper body. <br><br> The sword releases an enormous, powerful blast that obliterates the Goliath down to its waist, but doesn't have enough power to kill it outright/destroy its gem, and the Goliath immediately begins to regenerate. <br><br> Bell is forced to follow up his attack and uses Hestia's Knife to destroy the Goliath's gem before it can regenerate, destroying it. <br><br>None of this can be argued, this is exactly what was shown in the episode. I can go back and pick out screenshots illustrating every single thing I state here.<br><br>He did not one-shot the Goliath. There's no evidence it's some sort of retarded wide-angle bullet or arrow type attack (wide-angle arrows lol). There's no evidence that that particular attack could be focused to target a specific area. There's no evidence that focusing it on a smaller area would increase its damage. There's no evidence that even it it could focus on a smaller area to increase its damage, that it would've killed the Goliath outright.<br><br> If it's a blast or shoot <br><br>I'm glad you used "if", because it shows you're coming to terms with the fact that all of those retarded theories are pure fantasy and not at all what was shown in the episode.<br><br>The only good thing to come of this show ending is retards like you won't pop in to ruin threads with absolutely idiotic theories based off of fanwank and opinion.<br><br>Now, unless you can show up with any sort of proof other than more retarded opinions, please kindly keep your stupid to yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they made him use the dagger just because it was hestia dagger. ive read the LN 3 times and its not there<br><br>https://michinium.wordpress.com/201<wbr>5/03/03/danmachi-volume-2-4-pdfs/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>This post is relevant to you <br> The guy you're responding to is one of those people who thinks the translation is more accurate than the raw. </br></br>  Wish this was longer. <br><br>I'm getting post-anime depression.</br></br>  <br>Man, I'd be pissed too if I missed a fight like that.</br>    <br>same, the summer list is looking bad also</br>    <br><br>The newfags edge.</br></br>    <br>The targeted area mean the focused area. Bell should have attacked or targeted the core location Instead above it if he knew its location and that is its core.</br>  <br>Sure, but how could he have known? Who keeps their gem in their hip area instead of chest or head?<br><br>They blasted the giants head off and that did jack shit, so they blasted his whole upper body off next. Makes sense to me.</br></br></br>  <br>He have fought it once. He will have known it the next time he fought it.</br>  <br> he didnt watch youtube of other people beating him <br><br>fuking noob</br></br></br>  <br>That it's the pattern of the skill in the anime. His hand glow if it's magic or firebolt. His weapon glow usually his peak if it skill attack.</br>  So who is the strongest in the danmschi world and if ranked which ranking would Bell belong to?<br><br>Low tier<br>Mid ter<br>High tier</br></br></br></br>  <br>High tier because he is able to one shot goliath if it's not because he has not known the location of the core.</br>  <br>Mid tier</br>  <br>Boipussy tier</br>  How far bell's level now ? For single minded pursuit user his growth is not quick enough.  So, even with all those high level experienced adventurers there, only Bell could destroy the monster. Why not just suck his dick? Fuck this shitty story.  <br>He has rare skill items and zeus grandson.</br>  <br>So, he's basically a gary stu? I knew it.</br>  <br>Away being Her Goddessly self. Relying on Her "Hero". <br><br>Besides, if She DID join in it wouldn't have even lasted long enough for an entire Episode.</br></br></br>  <br>The ln pacing is quite slow to confirm that.</br>  <br>The problem here is not her chest bat her manshoulder.</br>  <br>Anime did a piss poor job at showing the contribution of the higher level adventurers and even welf crozzo's...<br>IT was a good anime up to the ending where they somehow had to shoehorn bell doing "what seemed like" a one-hit ko followed up by a tap.</br></br>  <br>Even before that Bell was destroying higher level monsters himself.</br>  <br>Nah, him destroying the higher level minotaur had tension and he obviously had extreme difficulty killing it. That was a really good fight wherein he was not gary-stu at all.</br>  <br>It was and it still is. Stop defending shit when it's shit.</br>  <br>Look anon, we share the same dislike of the final episode but you are just raging uncontrollably here if you cant appreciate the minotaur fight for what it is; a well choreographed fight scene of a boy who wanted to be a hero against a foe greater than himself.<br><br>The fight had him getting beat up and be in excruciating pain. Destroy his armor, break his spirit yet even against this odd he stood up and he pondered a thought "how to defeat the minotaur".<br>Up to that point he was being trained by Aiz and learned how to counter attack. He was honing his skills from grinding mobs. He got magic from an old book and he had the blessing of his goddess in form of a really good knife.<br>He accepted that he was a coward and that is good. Not getting hit is better than being stupidly heroic.<br>He knew that every slicing attack he did with the knife was not enough to pierce the minotaur's hide; his firebolts were not enough to put a dent into the minotaur.<br>He had the knowledge from lili that larger weapons are better against larger foes.<br><br>With all these he then put things in motion by:<br>Disarming the minotaur<br>Using it;s own large weapon agaisnt it to create cuts and openings where he can land his knife better,<br>Stage a fake bull rush attack into a counter into the belly of the beast.<br>And with his weak magic, BURST the ever living crap out of the minotaur from inside out.<br><br>It did not matter how much mana he had left, he had to do it at that moment and he did till his mind went numb!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nerf Argonaut</br>  <br>Sucking ma dick</br>  <br>Ottarl has:<br>Boars' Blood- health passively regen<br>Achilles Heel- can't be damaged unless damage at one region<br>Divine Devotion- immunity to all magic damage<br>Goddess' Protege- Self level boost</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's level 2</br>  <br>we dont know when ottar got those skills, how about if he had achilles heel at lvl 2?</br>  <br> comparing end-game skills to a level-2 skill </br>  <br>what if he had those skills at level 4-5? <br>I can speculate too</br></br>  <br>That immunity.

My suspension of disbelief went away when his attack actually manage to hurt the minotaur.</br>  <br>This is weak in comparable.</br>  <br>B-but it's a skill.</br>  <br>Not really OP, they could before boosting themselves to ridiculous levels</br>  <br><br>Unless your Spartacus with EX level in endurance</br></br>  Can we all agree that the Hestiafag producer ruined most of the show  Riveria Ljos Alf <br>Rea Laevateinn : Wide area annihilation Magic<br>Wynn Fimbulvetr: Extreme cold Magic that is said to be able to even freeze time <br>Veil Breath :Green Protection Magic that raises defense against physical and magical attacks<br>Via Shilheim : Barrier Magic that completely blocks physical and magical attacks <br><br>so she has magic that makes her immune to physical and magical attacks<br><br>not that she is a going to judge your shit skills or anything</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rises strength after takes damage losing sanity and taking damage mean less hp.

Unless you think that Bell is a half god, it isn't unique to them.</br></br>  <br>Block mean you still receiving damage.</br>  <br>how come the other elves dont have it then?</br>  <br>Because when they can have those skills doesn't mean they will have those skills. Maybe there are other broken skills that other elves have.</br>  <br>He was never described as similar to him and she never thought that, it's only manga readers forcing that idea. She thinks of her dad and mom because their death/disappearance changed her world, not because Bell looks like him. Bell reminds her of her younger self.</br>  <br>Bell is level 2 and level 3 in the last volume so mid tier. Ottarl is the strongest, Ais second, Finn is probably third, Riveria, Gareth are level 6 as well and there is Allen and two elves level 6 in Freya familia, Bete, the twin amazons, the four gulliver brothers, Tsubaki, Phryune are level 5.</br>  <br> it's only manga readers forcing that idea <br>I mean they do look alike. Aiz not noticing/commenting on such a similarity may be proof that in universe it's not true. However, she could just not be thinking about it since she is an airhead after all, and in to some extent it could explain her fondness for Bell, that she might not be aware of. Though I'll readily admit that the only base of this speculation is that the two characters have similar hair, and as such her dad looks like an older bell.</br></br>  <br>How would Bell, who doesn't look like her at all reminds her of herself but not her father if they are so similar? Especially when she was a daddy girl, it doesn't make sense. The time she compared the two was when he beat the minotaur, thinking that he had the right to be a hero, like her dad, there's no mention of resemblance and it's in a series where Revis noted that Ais looked like her mom and called her Aria, in the LN itself there's no such thing.</br>  <br>He is.<br>He acts like a shy anime girl love interest.</br></br>  <br> How would Bell, who doesn't look like her at all reminds her of herself but not her father if they are so similar? <br>She's dense, and could just not be drawing the conclusions. That's to say that I don't think it would be farfetched if she didn't think about visual similarities in their features that are apparent at least in the manga depiction of her father.<br><br> That said it's just speculation, valid as speculation until we actually know who both of their parents were, and know they weren't the same people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Valid as a speculation yes, but she never thought or mentioned that they looked similar so it changes everything when someone post this so <br> is definitely wrong. Ais not thinking about resemblance with him while looking at him and seeing him so many times is ridiculous even tough she's an airhead and it's not like her mentors Finn, Riveria and Gareth didn't know her parents as well, yet they never thought of a resemblance. It's a theory born from visual pictures of the manga, heck, is face is not even seen in the manga and yet he's supposed to look exactly like him.</br></br>  <br> Finn, Riveria and Gareth ... never thought of a resemblance <br>We don't know that. We only know that they've never commented on such a resemblance. It's entirely possible they didn't consider it, due to it being outside of their expectations. Another possibility is for whatever reason didn't want to comment on it, but did notice a resemblance. It can't really be definitively settled as speculation until we know who Bells parents were.<br><br> Them having the same parents would mean that Aiz's friends were keeping that Loki familia/Loki are/is responsible for their deaths from her, and it stands to reason that that they wouldn't want her to know that if such a thing is the case.<br><br>There's really not enough information to make much of an assertion either way, and the only information we have is a similarity in hair style, and a assumed similarity in hair color, and other features. I concede that that's not solid enough information, and I'd really like a color depiction of her father, but it does make for interesting speculation, and speculation that can't definitively be disproven, at least not yet anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   take a liking to jealous background yuri crush elf character <br> take up Sword Oratoria because Berserk Amazons  <br> turns out Lesfiya is a major character <br>PRAISE THE GODS!</br></br></br>  <br>Riveria and Finn at the very least know about both her parents. It's a speculation that can't be disproved but which is weak to begin with. Ais not thinking about resemblance coz she's an airhead despite all these scenes is beyond ridiculous, there's no mention of resemblance in the LN. Loki made Zeus familia quit Orario so she wouldn't be able to take Ais, unless it was in some rules, everything points out that her dad died facing Ziz.</br>  <br>Cute elf girl is cute.</br>  <br><br>Can you explain me why do you ave that yurishit elf as a fav? I understand that you can like her, but as a fav? She has some of Bell character in her but the rest make her extremely annoying, the only good thing about her is her magic.</br></br>  I wish I could capture Riveria and hatefuck her until she breeds a smaller army of half elves.  Why is Loki such a best everything?  <br>They can change the staff though, it's the same for Raildex animes.</br>  <br>I'd give her a ride too.</br>  Nice view. They just couldn't finish without it I guess. Not that I'm complaining.   kek   <br>Those bountiful mamaries</br>  <br>They're bigger than beru's head</br>  Would you?  <br><br><br>How can anyone hate Hestia?</br></br></br>  <br>He already gains levels more than ten times the rate of everyone else.<br><br>He got to level 2 in 6 weeks, while the record beforehand was a fucking year. Who knows how slow is the average rate.</br></br></br>  <br>She should be universally loved because she has a nice body? If you are a Hestiafag you're a pretty bad one. She has a nice body, her character is shit.</br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Liking Lefiya's bait post, just like people liking Kuroko.</br>  <br>Kuroko at least isn't as useless. The better answer would be being into /u/</br>  <br>6 weeks compared to 1 year is not 1 : 10.</br>  <br>Lefiya isn't useless either. She's a mobile artillery as of Volume 4, she is actually useful even in Floor 59, which I don't think Bell is yet.  She's still annoying as fuck though. </br>  <br>Fine, 8.6 times. Happy?</br>  <br>Not him 1 year was the record, they take normally more than 1 year. And I think it took him 2 months not 6 weeks, I could be wrong though.</br>  <br>Does she use anything other than magic now? Like fight with her staff or hand to hand? Are there elves other than Ryu who do that?</br>  <br>Loki is a guy, you know?</br>  Why is the spinoff more interesting than the main story?      <br>It's actually fun to watch OP people being OP.</br>    <br>The murder and crime things really intrigues mes</br>  <br>The cutest.</br>  <br> loki <br> cute <br><br>gay.</br></br></br></br>  Whats with the levels in this anime anyway? When Bell &amp; Crew arrived on the save floor it did not look like Aiz and her party had any trouble fuckin up the floor boss. If the other half of her party is close to the same level as hers (lvl 6), why did they have problems with a, even somehow powered up, lvl 5 floor boss? They even had help from the elf and andromeda, and I'm sure they are atleast Aiz level too.  <br>Aiz party had no trouble beating Goliath. The dungeon spawned an OP Goliath because of Hestia divine power, Loki familia had already gone. Ryu and Asufi are not even close Aiz level, they are level 4, they don't even compare to the level 5s. If Ryu had her status updated she would be level 5 though.</br>  <br>thanks, it seems the difference of a single level is realy big then.</br>  <br>Very big.</br>  <br><br>All magics are unique to the caster, there is no skill lister here. Riveria is an anomaly who can use more than three magics, she is an heroic vessel, and the strongest mage of Orario, author didn't reveal her status but she has a a rare development ability which works like mind potion and reduce the amount of mana her magics take, at full power, mana can't ever be depleted, it's very rare and an ability any high level magic users dream to have, and <br>Aiz got it when she became level 6.</br></br></br>  <br>listed*</br>  <br>Strawberries and Cream</br>  <br>doing cute and autistic things on the surface.</br>  <br>Lefiya right now has<br>1 super long cast aoe ice spell<br>1 super short cast shield<br>1 long (?) aoe fire<br>1 short auto-homing nuke<br>Can cast while moving.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>those tights...</br>  Why is his design so bad?

Maybe we'll get some in this thread if it lasts longs enough</br>  <br><br>we have had YUYUYU threads last a good long while before</br></br>    <br>just woke up.<br>sad that there are still no spoilers.</br></br>  <br> 6:40PM in Shikoku <br>There should be some soon</br></br>  Where do people typically go for spoilers? Futaba?<br>It's times like this where I wish I knew moon</br>  I want to  _be_  Yuuna      GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!<br><br>I got sick of the 2nd VN not being translated so I decided to go do a scenario myself.<br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/q<wbr>ppe7mp6adnelap/10-Inubouzaki+Fuu+ca<wbr>n%27t+deal+with+ghosts.txt<br><br>The translations are http://pastebin.com/KGYa8RaR but heavily edited as the original were crap. My Japanese is not amazing, so some things I had to assume the original was right in, but at least the English grammar is now readable. Also there are a few things lost in translation, especially さしすせそ, but if that's a problem, just go learn Japanese already.<br><br>Instructions for inserting the script into the VN can be found here: https://www.mediafire.com/folder/67<wbr>05q59djxz5n/YuYuYuS<br><br>It took a lot longer than I expected, mainly because the game crashes if there isn't a line break in the right space in every single goddamn line and English takes up so much more space than Japanese. Still, it would've been impossible without the guy who provided the mediafire files for inserting the script into the VN (see above), so kudos to him.<br><br>If someone else wants to do other ones, I'd be happy to provide editing/translating work for the other 2 crappy translations ( http://pastebin.com/3Jn10QDg and http://pastebin.com/cGYp9HEy ) but I'm not going through that line-spacing nightmare again. Have fun.<br><br>But on the bright side, enjoy Fuu and Itsuki trapped in slime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon!</br>  <br>Thanks anon!

I've been really busy lately, but now I have some time to work on adding translation data.<br>Also some good news, while fiddling with the data files I found how to remove the text size limit, so separating lines won't be necessary anymore, I also found how to translate the color codes for names so adding the @ won't be necessary either.<br><br><br>Yeah the most annoying part is getting the line breaks right, but the crashing issue should disappear with this fix, if you can edit the other translations I'll gladly add them to the script file.<br><br>After I'm done re-editing the existing translations so they work with the new fix I'll upload them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, good times</br>  <br>There's still 3 unannounced news so I'm pretty sure a second season will be one of them. I'm not surprised they haven't released any information about a s2 yet considering it was only a short while ago s1 aired and they didn't expect it to get the popularity it did. I rather wait for them to pan out the details than rush it.</br>  <br>i l-love you anon</br>  <br>You're doing God's work anon!</br>  Got some tiny bit of information<br> The new LN chapter doesn't directly connect to the supposed S2 but to Nowayu. <br> Highlight is Wakaba's picture. <br> Chapter has an unrest atmosphere. <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cleaned this picture up a little bit.<br>Though, having a scan in 1200 dpi and original size I'd be able to make it look better.</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>It kills my kokoro that we know that something is wrong with Yuuna but we don't even know what exactly.<br>During the whole second VN Yuuna acted like she was daijobu so the others don't have to worry.<br>God damn it Yuuna you are supposed to talk to someone if you are troubled ;_; <br>Protect Yuuki Yuuna, even if she is 100% Vertex or godess or whatever now she still is perfect!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna may turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>c-come on anon,,, t-tell me it's a joke ;_;</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>Why this</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>So she's an immortal divine being with the  soul of a lion  now.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>W-which Yuuna?</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>REAL HUMAN BEAN</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  Okay, guys. Brace yourself for chapter summary, as well as a tiny snapshot of Wakaba. <br> Chapter starts with Sonoko and Karin in the bath talking about candidates for the next club head. <br> When Sonoko went home she found an old Hero Record book. <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br> However, at the last page there's a picture of a girl that looks like her. <br> The name is Nogi Wakaba, the year is 2015. <br> Sonoko shows the book to the club. <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br> She spaces out and only comes back to her sense when Fuu calls out to her. <br> Last illustration is of the entire club looking at Wakaba's picture. <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br> Chapter ends. <br><br>Inb4, the old Yuuna's soul hijacks our current Yuuna's body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br>damn not again Taisha</br></br>    <br>I'm scared, /a/. Also, <br> 2015 </br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br><br>I bet her soul is  burning as hot as the sun .</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br>I don't want to see her cry...</br></br>  <br>Guys, we got too used to the cute SoL moments in the vita and VNs. This is the true face of Takahiro. Brace yourselves.</br>  <br>E-everything will be ok.</br>  <br> Yuuna suffering continues <br>I can't go on guys, this is too much for my heart.<br>Can't she just punch things back into daijobu again? ;_;<br>God I need NoWaYu now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Y-yeha be postive guys!<br>The healing will feel even better after Yuuna dealt with the next shit happening. She is a hero she won't lose! let's just belive in her!<br>You're likely to succceed if you try!</br></br></br>  Okay, prediction time:<br>Yuuna absorbed a part of Leo's soul when she touched the core. She was in coma because of the adjustments in her soul that had to happen.<br>Leo's soul is now sleeping inside her waiting for a trigger to wake it up. I can see two different paths from there:<br>1. Yuuna becomes a combined hero-super-vertex and the final boss, Tougou calls out to her, Yuuna fights within her soul against Leo and wins.<br>2. Leo is actually an observer and messenger and its task is to see what's going on inside of the walls of the Shinju-sama and to assess if they should continue trying to destroy humanity or if the Shinju has a point.</br></br></br></br>  we evangelion now  <br>I'd like the first thing.  Actually as long as Yuuna is fine in the end I'd love any ending I guess. <br>The whole Takashima deal makes all this a bit complicated though. I think because of the <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br>we can assume that Yuuna either has <br>A. The memories of Takashima<br>B. Is Takashima<br>Just being named after her won't work now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God I need these YuYuYu Character songs now.<br>I am in need of healing.</br>  <br>Or may be Takashima   is Leo </br>  <br>Or maybe Takashima got absorbed by Leo, and now both got absorbed by Yuuna.</br>  <br><br><br>It would make a lot of sense that the humans dying within that small world reincarnate over and over again as they have nowhere else to go.<br>I like this idea a lot </br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like the Yuuna unintentionally absorbed Leo as fuel and is slowly becoming a godess theory. As time goes on she is becoming more aware of the past events and her blacking out is the recalling of past events triggered by her immediate surroundings. That play that they put on may have actually occurred word for word in the past.</br>   mfw all the people who got crazy about Yuuna's fainting after ep.12 aired were right after all   Guys, I think we're too naive to thinks that there'll be any scans in the near future. Remember that this is from a Visual Fanbook, not a magazine, not many people are willing to dissect their book to scan it.  <br><br>Makes me wonder why there are no paper-thin flexible scanners. There are paper-thin flexible displays, shouldn't be too hard to create something like that using a combination of microscopic light sources and detectors that basically create a snapshot of the surface they're put on.</br></br>  <br>T-try not to give up ;_;</br>  i need more healing already...  <br>Just gives me incentive to buy the books myself.</br>  I want to fuck Yuuna.  <br>Healing when ;_;</br>  <br>Staying true in her time of struggle, eh?</br>  <br>Alright, here's Yuuki Yuuna 24-hour coverage, edited/retranslated: http://pastebin.com/QpW8Dys6<br><br>Note that the original TLs don't distinguish between Tougou dialogue and Tougou narration - I've left it as is, but if you get confused anywhere let me know.<br><br>Actually, the original translations were a lot worse for this one, reading like a machine translation at times - my favourite parts were the copy-paste definition of 顔パス - "free admission for being well known" and the translation of 国語 as "national language" instead of Japanese. <br><br>Note everyone that this scenario contains the most information about Yuuna's post-recovery status that we get in the VN.<br><br> Tougou: There are still mysteries left, but with everyone, I'm sure... <br> Tougou: I casually raise my head to the sky. <br> Tougou: Since it is noon, the stars aren't visible. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tougou is becoming a stalker.<br><br>Also<br> Tougou: However, did they really return? <br> Tougou: Could it be that we were granted something new...? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn Takahiro! i'm not ready for this!</br>  <br>No need for that, my copy will arrive in about 4 days. If there's still no scans for 2nd translator anon, I'll take up the task myself.<br><br><br> Yuuna's soul (consciousness) fused with Leo and then got taken away as offering. <br> When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br>I can see this happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tougou: ...I let them know about being chosen as an offering. <br> Tougou: However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Tougou: Just being delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>About this part, I think it should be<br> ...My parents knew about me being chosen as offering. <br> However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Just seeing how they're so delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>As seen in Wasuyu, Taisha only hid the truth from the heroes, not their parents so it'd be weird for Tougou to be the one letting them know. Her parents knew the truth and didn't do anything about it, however, seeing how they still truly care about her, she doesn't blame them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Such a mature behaviour from a teenaged girl really strains my suspension of disbelief.<br> Just kidding. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 喜んでくれただけで, which definitely means that the parents are the one's being delighted with Tougou's recovery. I think I intended it to be "Just them being delighted with my recovery is sufficient" but accidentally a word. Sorry.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>However, the "let them know" is correct, 知らされていた definitely implies Tougou imparting the information to her parents.</br>  <br>Wait nevermind, I'm an idiot. The information was imparted to the parents but not by Tougou, you were right.</br>  <br><br>I love Karin</br></br>    <br>She looks like a mix between Sonoko and Wasshi.</br>  <br><br>That's a fucking glorious hairstyle.</br></br>  <br>Hot damn, she looks like some bad-ass Taisha hitwoman</br>  <br> Or may be Takashima is Leo <br>Or may be Takashima Yunna is   Yuuki Yuuna, when she is in coma. Mental time travel yo. So they actually foreshadow it in the spin off?? Damn. </br></br>  <br> time travel shenanigans <br><br>Now we're talking.</br></br></br>   Standing on top of Kamagura castle's inner right citadel in Kaogawa prefecture, Nogi Wakaba stared at Seto Inland sea.  <br>6 main characters:<br> Nogi Wakaba <br> Kamisato Hinata <br> Takashima Yuuna <br> Gun Chikage <br> Doi Tamako <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br><br>Tfw Wakaba's flower is the same as Tougou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to mention, for this one, Takahiro's just in charge of planning, Akashiro Aoi'll be the one writing it.</br>  <br> Gun Chikage <br><br>I hope that is also her weapon of choice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So I missed a few threads, this is going to be another LN series like WaSuYu?</br></br>  <br>Yes, it'll be about the very first group of hero back in the time before they changed the calendar.</br>  <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br>Actually, it's "Iyojima Anzu".</br></br>  <br>Elysium works fine, Bloatgirls if you desire so.<br><br> Lesbian <br> LESBIAN <br>You delusional fuck she even writes that her dream is to become a wife.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's Marugame Castle, which is the one that Sumi visited with her mother in episode 10.<br>So the setting will probably be the same as WaSuYu's, meaning that the old Yuushas won't have to see their homes turn to fire at the end of the LN.</br></br>  <br>Elysium's release is overfiltered garbage.</br>  <br>Yeah, my mistake, it's Marugame castle.<br>Their home won't turn into fire but the rest of the world might. <br><br>Got another interesting detail in the new chapter<br> Sonoko talks about the type of person she likes. <br>  &gt;It sounds exactly like she's describing Wasshi.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/651<wbr>19<br> 2018 <br> mfw 2015 nao <br>THE SUFFERING NEVER ENDS<br>WE HAVE NO FUTURE</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>I don't really know how to tell the difference man, the only thing I can measure is blurriness and even that I'm not very good at.</br>  <br>Tfw Vertices's attack is in 2015. We'll never get to read it. <br>All joking aside, they probably just fucked the release date. Officially, the Visual Fanbook's supposed to be released on 30th yet they're selling it now.</br></br>  Still no scans.  <br><br>2018.7.30 is the date when the novel events happen.<br>The novel starts being published in September's Dengeki this year.</br></br></br>  <br>The Hero Record was written starting from 2015, though.</br>  <br>Then maybe it doesn't start with the very first event?<br>I mean what the fuck else could 2018.7.30 stand for.<br>Alternative idea: maybe we're starting off with a few members and gain a big party by that date, there are 6 people to be collected after all.</br></br></br>  It can't arrive soon enough.  <br>We're counting on you, anon.</br>  Even if we get no scans this time there'll still be translation as some of us also bought the book. The problem is when Nowayu starts, there're no guarantee that each chapter'll get scanned as soon as it comes out or at all.  <br>I wasn't arround when WaSuYu got scanned but there were no problems that time as far as I know so why would it be different now?</br>  <br>WaSuYu has been out for months before the anime started and translations began.<br>We only really had to wait for the final chapter.</br></br>  <br>And the final chapter never got scanned, an anon had to the digital version released half a month later of the magazine. If Nowayu has no scans, who in here has enough money and is willing to keep buying the magazine for ~8 months straight?</br>    <br> High quality scan <br>is it happening!?</br></br>    <br> I'm feeling healed already </br>    <br>glorious school girl with Japanese sword and ponytail.</br>  <br>I want to touch their marshmallows<br><br> that underwater navel peek <br>too lewd</br></br></br></br>  <br> Katana <br>Meh.<br>Hopefully they have someone with a mace/flail/staff/anything blunt in the new old crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe we're going to get an axe again. <br>Her sword looks quite special to not be used in actual combat. Maybe they're going to fight without transforming and just got some stats boost this time. <br> No fairy <br> No magical armor <br>I wonder how many of the main 6 will pull a Gin before the final chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>or get one hit killed by scorpion in the guts.</br>  <br>Its been three hundred years, They could be related.</br>  <br>Where does this leave Gin now anyway?<br>There were six Yuusha in the past- not seven.<br>So either Gin or one of the six remaining girls in 300 cannot be a reincarnation of one of the six girls in the past.<br>Could this mean- Gin's death was an accident? She was never supposed to have been a Yuusha?<br>Or is one of the current girls not supposed to be a Yuusha? Which one would it be? Itsuki? She only became one to be with her sister. Or Karin? Who only became one because another Yuusha died?<br> They are creating way more questions with this story than they are answering.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody said they have to be a reincarnation.</br>  <br>Is it back in stock? Or did they really sell out in the first 30 minutes it was on sale?</br>  <br>so last night I posted this<br>and today I come home and find this: <br>She even carries a sword as her weapon.<br>An Ikemen mahout shoujou named Wakaba who even carries a sword! At least they changed the hair and eye color.<br>Will this Wakaba princess carry loli's as well?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hoenstly think the chance of one of the Yuushas being a loli is pretty high.  Gotta please the audience. </br>  <br>I don't care as long as there's a megane Yuusha.<br>Seriously.<br>Come on.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this? Sonoko's little sister?</br>  <br>Sonoko's ancestor.</br>  <br> 2014 <br> yuuna punches a thing <br> 2015 <br> yuuna is a thing <br>What went wrong?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This really makes it look like Sonoko is entering the Karinbowl. To win.</br></br>  <br>Don't lose hope. Sonoko After got translated based only on cellphone pictures.</br>  So will Takashima finally get an awesome red scarf of badassitude  <br>I thought Itsuki was the acting loli since she was only 12?</br>  <br> &gt;When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br><br>Who in the name of fuck is Takashima?</br></br></br>  <br> Only leaves wincest route left <br>Praise be to Sonoko.</br></br>  <br>One of the original yuushas, along with Wakaba.</br>  <br>But when asked what type of person she likes, Sonoko basically described Wasshi, or so I heard.</br>  <br> Itsuki &amp; Fuu <br> non-straight <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>I pick Itsuki  x  Fuu</br>    <br>Yes, but she has to face reality like Karin had to. Maybe that was the real reason Sonoko cried in episode 8. If the Vita game is canon she already knew Togo had lost her memories.<br>So it makes more sense that when she saw Yuuna with her that she realized that Togo had found someone else.</br></br>  <br>What's going on? Where did this scan come from? Why isn't there more?</br>  I wish Gin was here.  <br>I think having flowers floating in the bathwater is pretty gay.<br>Especially if the flowers are all the character flowers of you and the other girl you are sharing the bath with.</br></br>  <br>It's Vertices, not Vertexes.</br>  <br>Well we will find out now if its true she died because Taisha made her fight with 300 year old weapons.</br>  <br>probably of someone who made a scan of the cover.<br>Probably no scans of the insides because it might hurt the book.</br></br>  <br>But anon, it'd be really dangerous if she drops her megane or if it's broken in the middle of a fight.</br>  <br>But the cover is . That oughta be a page in the middle. Unless the LN chapter comes in a separate booklet.</br>  <br>noun [C] uk /ˈvɜː.teks/ us /ˈvɝː.t̬eks/ (plural vertices or vertexes) specialized</br>  Got the details of Sonoko's type now<br> Someone who is serious, good at taking care of people but also gets out of control sometimes. </br>  <br>She'd like Shirou.</br>  <br>Cant that apply to Karin? She is certainly serious.</br>  <br>Why are Sonoko and Karin sharing a rose bath together?</br>  <br>Well it was one of the sleepovers.<br>But the flowers were Sonoko's idea.<br>(She is also the only one with enough yen to buy a couple dozen roses just to cut up to do this)</br></br></br>  <br> She is certainly serious. <br>About muscle training and supplement. And she certainly isn't that good about taking care of people, Tougou and Fuu have to force her eats proper foods from time to time.</br></br>  <br>Sonoko is making some advances</br>  <br>Flowers smell nice.</br>  <br><br>It doesn't work like that if you take the future setting into account where loads of girls can become heroes.</br></br>  <br>I want to smell Karin.</br>  <br>It's more about genetics.<br>Those girls who have the most compatible genes (aptitude) can become Yuushas.<br>Thats why the big familys close to Taisha came to exist. But because those families couldn't always produce offspring that could be used they changed it to look for girls outside those familys.</br></br></br>  <br>It is not same as Tougou. It is Balloon flower [as analyzed by communities i am in], which is very similar but still different. Its flower language is endless love, honesty, the return of a friend is desired, obedience, changless love, amiable romance and so on.</br>  <br>Gin became  Yoshiteru. </br>  <br>Fuck</br>  <br>It's been pretty clear for a while now that Karin's subtext-endgame is Fuu.</br>  <br>Who is Itsuki's subtext-endgame with? Why is there always an odd number?</br>   The Yuuna at the end of episode 12 and who returned to Togo is actually an ancient Yuuna imposter from 2015.  <br><br>what</br></br>  <br>what</br>  <br><br/></br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>84327<br>Is this another remix album, or maybe unused music?</br></wbr>  <br>Music that wasn't included in the first OST, VN exclusive BGMs, Forestize Warning, Emergency Warning, and Emergency Warning "Censored Version" (the one from episode 10) and Inori no Uta.</br>  Wait, are we gonna get a S2 and things are gonna go back to being fire instead of fine?      <br>everything was on fire from the beginning</br>  <br>Cool. I can't get enough of the warnings.</br>  I refuse to believe these spoilers until I've seen the scans for myself.<br>I invite you all to do the same.</br>  さあさあ has never been the same after Karin's awesome fight. I grin like an idiot every time I think of it.  <br>I hope so</br>  <br>And I think of it every time I hear someone say it.</br>  <br>They sound pretty believable. Can't say the same about a lot of the speculation done after them in this thread.</br>  <br>too bad the one i ordered still haven't leave Japan...</br>  <br> 2015 <br>is this legit</br></br>  <br>  The Yuuna at the end of episode 12 and who returned to Togo is actually an ancient Yuuna imposter from 2015.  <br><br>Wouldn't Yuuna-15 freak out what the hell is going on and who all those people are?<br>Or does she not give a fuck and just rolls with it? Because that would be hilariously awesome.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she has the memories of current Yuuna</br>  <br>I think she understands whats happened and doesn't want to cause issues so is trying to impersonate Yuki to the best of her ability.</br>  <br>No, it's the real Yuuna! It has to be. I won't believe it...</br>  <br><br>Absurd.</br></br>  <br>I'm with this anon. All of those happy moments at the end can't have been lies. I think it's more likely that Yuuna's soul traveled back in time somehow while she was a potato and that's why she recognized Wakaba. My bet is that Takashima Yuuna is none other than Yuuki Yuuna.</br>  Yuuna was never taken by Shinju in the first place, it was because of the Leo core. If anything, she's the one who was sent through time during her coma and is impersonating Takashima in the LN.  <br><br>This sounds like the most plausible explanation and I like it.<br>Also<br> 1 post apart </br></br></br></br>    <br>NERD</br>  <br> Yuna and Togo finally get to fucking <br> Yuna stops halfway <br> Can't proceed knowing she's not the same Yuna Togo loved <br> Angst ensures </br></br></br></br>  <br>I posted that as a joke tweeeeest when we first learned Takashima's name, but it's actually looking surprisingly plausible now.</br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>Aaaand here we go again or, more accurately, the ride never actually ended. It was all just an illusion to dull our senses into a false state of security.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yep.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yuuna going back in time certainly sounds more plausible than "lol ancestor hijack".<br><br>In b4 Yuuna's time fuckery is the trigger that caused the gods to fuck humanity in the first place</br></br></br></br>    <br>Well, if she caused the whole problem it makes sense she's the hero that has to solve it, then.</br>  <br>Well.... most time travel war story ends up like this<br>Like Achron.   Inb4 Leo is built according to Yuuna.  </br></br>  <br> Yuuna going back in time is what caused the vertexes to attack earth <br> the vertex invasion is what ultimately led Yuuna to go back in time <br>That's why time travel shenanigans aren't a very good idea.<br><br>Still, we do have a precedent for time travel if you take that special 4koma chapter to be canon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Anon, that's how the Shinju-sama ACTUALLY fight the infinitely regenerating heavenly god! Trap them in a stable time loop!</br>  <br>If anthing, Yuuna would bring the Vertex core with her that is used a base for Vertex back in 2015.</br>  <br>We'll go full Night Watch. Whatever caused the time travel fuckery gets original hero Takashima Keel killed early, Yuuna has to take her place and preserve history (and humanity) by establishing the Hero System and beating back the first wave of Vertex in order to ensure that there even is "present" left for her to return to.</br>  <br> Takashima Keel <br>  Keel <br><br>Wait, was that name confirmed before?</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>I don't follow these threads since the end of the anime, what does than mean? What is shen then?</br></br>  <br>we don't know either, we all still waiting for actual scans and then the translation.</br>  <br>Vertex, probably.<br>If you watched the last episode you might have an idea.</br></br>  <br><br>So Yuuna was never human or maybe the human Yuuna got replaced by the Vertex Yuuna?</br></br>  <br>Keel was the character who died at the start of Night Watch.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she writes that her dream is to have a wife.</br>  <br>Why are bloatgrils so bloaty anyway?</br>  Why is Niboshi so good?<br>Karin has some god tier taste.</br>  <br>  Tougou got her waifu killed and replaced by an alien bodysnatching murderbot <br><br>I could smell the angst if something like this happened.<br><br>What if Yuuna's soul actually never returned and we got Shinju-sama occupying her body instead?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Niboshi <br>Gross.</br></br>    Does 2ch copy our threads?  <br>why?<br>what are they posting?</br></br>  because <br>I wonder if they had copied any of our speculation too</br>  <br>dunno, don't even know how to navigate their site.<br>horrendous to find out if they even have a thread up.</br></br>  This feels too much like post episode 11. I'm scared<br><br><br>You really missed out, it was crazy.<br><br><br>Yay!<br><br><br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>pls no<br><br><br>Please be healing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And I'm done editing. The script file with the 4 translated and updated chapters (8-10-11-12) is here: http://www.mediafire.com/download/3<wbr>d5ilb4163gbqxq/script.dat <br>Everything else is uploaded to the usual folder (https://www.mediafire.com/folder/6<wbr>705q59djxz5n/YuYuYuS)<br>I also updated the instructions since it's not necessary to break lines anymore (I updated the previously translated chapters accordingly) and it's not necessary to write names with the japanese text and @, just the translation.<br>Since it takes so long to work out the line breaks I made a little application to test the scripts before adding them to the game, it sped things a little (also uploaded in the utilities folder).<br>With this 1/3 of the translation is done, thanks translators for the hard work!<br><br>PS. I used this translation  for the part in question.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr>  <br>a hero anon</br>  <br>Nice, so you're gonna add these two later?<br>http://pastebin.com/3Jn10QDg<br>http://www.mediafire.com/view/4zn0t<wbr>lwgfydidbd/17-ラブレター事変(猫語).txt</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I think i love you anon</br>  <br>You are a true yuusha, anon</br>  <br>Based anon.</br>  <br>Making the Yuusha-bu proud, anon.</br>  I seriously hope you guys are saving the Yuushas.  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>You're a true yuusha</br>  <br><br>Awesome.</br></br>  <br>The first one is being edited by the same anon who edited the other two, the quality of those translations wasn't that good.<br>As for the second one, I didn't know there was a translation for the love letter chapter, though it's the "cat language" one (I have no idea how you get it in game though, so I can't test it), but it can probably be edited into the normal one, I 'll take a look.</br></br>  <br>You get it in game by unlocking all the CGI, including the maid oufits (just skipping through all the chapters works).<br><br>Nyaa~</br></br></br>  <br><br>please anon, i really really need that chapter, is a matter of life or death</br></br>  <br> you will never be a cool delinquent who picks up girls in Shibuya while wearing that </br>    <br> Yuuna-chan, it's morning <br> Ah, good morning Tougou-san </br></br>  Reading the new VN2 tls made me remember how wonderful Yuuna's voice is<br>Is Yuuna the cutest in the universe?</br>  <br>Yes , but no longer the cutest human. </br>  <br>That would be Itsuki.</br>  <br>Please anon, I don't think I can handle that</br>  Anyone knows where to find G's magazine's spoilers?<br>On twitter, they said there's a pic of Takashima and she doesn't really look like Yuuki, her hair color is more closer to Gin.</br>  Just finished anime/ln according to the guide image, where do I go now? The first VN?  <br>first VN is SoL which didn't fit into the Anime.<br>if you like to read more S2 plot baits (and SoL) go straight to VN2</br></br>  <br>Sonoko's after</br>  <br>First you read Sonoko's After<br>Then first VN, what's avaible of the PSP game, and then VN2. The most up to date script for the 2nd vn is a few post up.<br>You can read those on any order you want though</br></br></br>  <br>It fits into between ep3 and 4, anon.</br>  <br>yes, the cozy time before the big battle.<br>thats why it is SoL that didn't made it into the Anime.</br></br>  <br>He meant that they never made it into the anime.</br>    <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  No  <br>let us hope that everything ends into Healing again.<br><br> we all know what Takahiro is capable off </br></br></br>  <br>Yuushas get raped by dogs?</br>  <br>0% human, 100% cutie</br>  <br>Yuuna and Gin are already a lot alike. Their hair is 90 percent of the visual difference between them.</br>  <br>The shape of their eyes and facial expression are both different.</br>  I don't even need scans, I am already happy with photographs of the pages now.  <br><br>Just imagine what these two could have done have they ever joined forces against the Vertex.</br></br>    <br><br>I rather watch Yuna and Gin join forces against Togo<br><br>In bed<br><br> Sexually </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sonocuck pls</br>   Yuuna left Tougou after all <br> Tougou doesn't realize it </br>  <br>First VN has some interesting things beside the carefree SoL, like the chapter where Fuu talks a bit more about her past or the chapter where Karin opens up to Yuuna about her family and why she wants to be a hero.</br>  <br> that her dream is to have a wife <br>Just how tight were your goggles on?</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> wheelchair moe <br>Although I did just remember that I saw Tougou on tumblr which was how I ended up watching it.</br></br>  <br>YUUKI YUUNA IS A HERO</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that she wrote "a lovely bride" on her wish thingy. Plus it made Kureha and Kanata react strangely and made Kureha say pic related.</br>  <br>I was certain they meant the fact Noel is well, eccentric as fuck and they were trying to calm her down with"don't worry, someone will marry you for sure someday", but now I'm not that sure.</br>  <br> Tougou: Since it is noon, the stars aren't visible. <br>For some reason, that line makes me even uneasier than the 0% human thing</br></br>  Bah, there's no way S2 would be better than S1 anyways.  <br>There's that too, but don't forget that her and Alisha were gaying it up quite a bit in the last couple of episodes, and that Noel uses boku. <br><br>I'm a yurifag but I don't tend to activate my goggles unless I see good evidence. I didn't really see any yuri in Pleiades, for example (which will definitely be another really bad case of S2 never)</br></br></br>  <br>At the end of the sequel, Yuuna'll manage to raise up her human part to 80% just like Parunyasu.</br>  <br>Did you watch Etotama?</br>  <br>No, but I've heard that it's a fun series. I was thinking of checking it out.</br>  I really want to see that artwork with everyone looking at wakabas picture. I am worried about Yuuna ;_;  <br>Me either, I heard decent things on the yuri front though and it's refreshing to come across a yurifag with objectivity. I can subtext into anything, but I'm also willing to admit when it's just wishful thinking on my part.</br>  <br>Yurishipping is supposed to be a fun thing, I'm well aware that we probably won't ever get confirmation in any shows with subtext (although Tougou being confirmed as being at least Yuunasexual is hopeful). <br><br>I think that being overly serious and autistic about yuri and het should be left to tumblr and their ilk.</br></br></br>  <br>Never lose hope in those shows nor in this one. Hero Club five tenets: Try not to give up.</br>  <br>Yeah, I jumped ship from tumblr about a year ago because everything was getting too srs bsns, but now all the joy's being sucked out of 4chan for me too.</br>  <br>I was hoping she was just going to become a God. Now they have me worried that it is something sinister.</br>  <br>It could be both. Either way Tougou will save her, because so far she hasn't done anything heroic, so it's her turn.</br>  It's been a while since I was in one of these threads. I really need to read these LNs already.<br><br><br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human <br>The ride never ends.</br></br></br></br>  Already has fanart.  This lack of scans is physically hurting me.  What is Tougou doing to Yuuna here?  Cover of the doujin Mitcher's gonna put out in Yuyuyu Only.  <br> Tentacles <br><br>Jesus Christ. <br><br> Did it go in? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Play it.</br>  <br><br>I have no idea what's been going on in these threads since the show ended. <br><br>Where do I begin? What VN is that scene from? Where do I download?  How ecchi is that scene. Will you tell me if they hint at it? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, this better have scans.</br>  <br>Download the 2nd VN and the script link here <br><br>You can find a link of the 2nd VN in one of the previous threads, then copy the script to the VN folder and just play it.</br></br></br>  <br> this better have scans </br>  <br><br>Thanks anon.<br><br> But seriously, I can't go through all that trouble on my shit toaster. How ecchi is that scene? Will you tell me if they hint at it? </br></br></br></br>  <br>No bully</br>  <br>It's just a vn anon, I'm sure it'd run on any toaster. Play them both, they're fun!</br>  I want to fuck Yuuna.  <br>Which Yuuna?<br> &gt;inb4 they're the same </br></br>  <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br> She spaces out and only comes back to her sense when Fuu calls out to her. <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br>Guys, maybe it's indeed a body hijack, but it's not by Takashima   but instead by Wakaba </br></br></br></br>  <br>Noticed a small typo in Fuu's scenario.</br>  Fuck.<br>It still hurts.</br>  <br> scans <br><br>I feel you.</br></br></br>  <br>It'll be futa anyway.</br>  <br>She wrote to become a bride.</br>  <br> Complain about futa Yuuna <br> Don't wanna get fucked by Yuuna <br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>If I recall correctly, YuYuYu Only is non-H, or at the very least "nothing extreme." I'm pretty sure either one rules out futa.</br>  Who the hell is Takashima Yuuna? I'm so out of the loop.  <br>Supposedly one of the first heroes, from 300 years ago.<br>Most likely one of the main characters of the new LN.</br></br>  http://animeexpo2015.sched.org/even<wbr>t/8b78ec92300196ab4916ac1b1df5f881#<wbr>.VY-sWvnF9Bs<br><br> Voice actress Tomoyo Kurosawa (Voice of Itsuki Inubozaki) and music producer Yoshifumi Yarimizu will be on hand to answer all your questions and reveal the secret of “Yuki Yuna is a Hero”.  <br>What secrets can they possibly reveal?<br>Also,<br> Catch sneak previews of Episodes #11 and #12 (the final Episode) with English dubs.  <br><br>Itsuki doesn't even talk in episode 11, and it's not going to be Kurosawa's voice in episode 12 since it's a dub.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br><br> yfw There Must Always Be a Hero Yuna </br></br>    Wakaba-chan kakkoi  ded  <br>B-but the thread can't die before we got scans! ;_;</br>  <br>Indeed.<br>Try Not to give up fellow yuushabros</br></br>  <br>The artist already confirmed that it'll be pure yuri.</br>  <br>Hero Club 5 Tenets</br>  <br><br>This type of pics open old wounds.</br></br>    I wake up a second time already just to find out that we still have no pictures of the book.<br>This is suffering.</br>  <br>eh, just found 2 new pictures on twitter.</br>    <br>Yuuna-chan please be alright! ;_;<br>I just want to protect this smile</br></br>    <br>Shit just got real.</br>    <br>Wait is the Kokubou Kamen script translated?</br>  Wait, we still don't have proper BD subs?  <br> So Heroes already existed in the old times, huh... This doesn't look like a prank... What a surprise, right? Yuuna <br> ... <br> Yuuna, what's wrong? <br> ... <br> Yuuna? <br><br>  Everything will be fire.  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Id by "saving" you mean buying all their merch. Then,  I'm sorry anon. I haven't yet. </br>  <br>These shirts are great since they are colorful enough to look like those Hawaiian shirts and looks nice coupled with neutral colored dresses; that or black.</br>  <br>Honestly I am way more interisted  in other words scared  about Yuunas relation to all this than about the actual NoWaYu plot.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I thought I had gotten off the ride, but in reality it just took a break.</br></br></br></br>  <br>4 words anon<br><br>Massive<br><br>Mahou Shoujo<br><br>Army</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like everything  was becoming fire </br>  <br>That one futa pic he did of Yuuna and Tougou is literally the only futa I've ever found arousing, so I would actually be okay with that. But I'm happier that it's going to be yuri.</br>  <br>Yuuki Yuuna StrikerS</br>  So despite what the organizer said, based Mitcher decided to make his book R-18 anyway.<br>http://pixiv.net/member_illust.php?<wbr>mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51138773</wbr></br>  <br>Seems like poor form tbh</br>  <br>Is the one we cant see the eye actually yuuna? I mean she have such a long hair?</br>  <br>I think, those look like Yuuna's clothes.</br>  <br>Her side hair've always been that long, and that's the clothes she wears in the Vita game.</br>  <br>So Yuuna bought herself a swim top in the same style as the one Togo "wore" in episode 7, in her own traditional color.</br>  <br>I don't think that top is gonna be used for swimming</br>  <br>Her hair down in Sonoko After looked longer than when they were in the inn in episode 7.<br>I don't think her hair was cut while she was a vegetable<br><br>Maybe she subconsciously likes her Yuusha pigtail and is going to keep growing out her hair?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it was clear when Togo wore it that she was only able to do so because she was not going to be really swimming but floating in a chair. There is literally nothing to keep the bottom of it floating up, it has no bottom band, it just sort of drapes over the tits. Its why I put "wear" in quotes. Its really just a strip of cloth draped over the boobs to comply with legal requirements.</br>  <br> doujin Mitcher's gonna put out in Yuyuyu <br>Oh my.</br></br>  <br>I forget what exactly the wording of the rules were. Some people said that it was non-H, while others said that H yuri was allowed as long as it was "extreme."</br>  <br> Tougou's eyes look like Wasshi's now. <br>This is great, she's getting her cool side back.</br></br>  <br>Now that I think about it, they did emphasize how Yuuna and Sonoko became good friends instantaneously. They're probably connected on some deeper level.</br>  <br>To be fair, Yuuna becomes friends with anyone instantaneously. That's sort of her "thing."</br>  <br>Is that Tougou sporting a Wasshi haircut I see?</br>  <br>Please stop being so pure, anon.  I think it's a piece of lingerie </br>  <br> Yuuna said her heart somehow skipped a beat when she saw Sonoko. <br> Sonoko felt a bit uncomfortable around Yuuna. <br>Something is indeed there.</br></br></br>  <br>Poor Tougoucuck</br>  All this gayness will surpass nanofate and meduka combined.<br>I'm ok with this.</br>  <br>I think meduka is long since surpassed. Nanofate better watch their backs.</br>  <br>Yes just like she is here</br>  <br>Ugh, that art-style is so fucking cute.</br>  <br>While Yuuna and Tougou don't share a bed, nor have they adopted a child together, they also don't labour under the studied ambiguity that still lets people claim "they're just good friends"</br>  I don't follow YuYuYu threads for months, did a new LN come out? Last one I read was Sonogo no Sonoko and WaSuYu Special Chapter.  <br> implying <br>It'll turn out that Takashima somehow killed Wakaba or something along that line. <br>Btw, when Sonoko implied that she liked Wasshi, Yuuna was like "Sono-chan!?". I don't think they'll really go for the triangle route but it's sort of there now.</br></br></br>  Finally A-5 announced and we get a ton of new characters coming in.<br><br>Mogami Aki = Minamoto Yoshinaka</br></br>  Translations never. Good thing that I started learning moon.  <br>What are you talking about, Majikoi S is almost done and the people are continuing on A.</br>  Best girl  <br>I dont expect translations to be going on, I've myself been learning moonrunes and have understood and played A-1 to A-4</br>  Dumping fun scenes of Maji-A series    <br>Who?</br>  <br>They really need to stop adding so many new girls that will make me depressed they will never get their own route.</br>  Any idea on the VA of the new characters ? <br>Also Margit preview looks awesome</br>      <br>the VA for the roles aint released yet at the moment, hopefully it will be pleasantly surprising</br>    <br>Bullshit, anyone that was working on Majikoi is dead. All we have left to look forward to is shitty machine translations.</br>  <br/>  <br> new character <br>Why</br></br>  Her design is doing something to my heart that hasn't happened for at least five yeas. This is real fucking odd.  <br>This is definitely a Jojo reference here, Yoichi has the same voice actor as Gyro in Jojo all star battle<br>and he says this line exactly as he did in the game</br></br>  <br>"Uwaaa, I was seen I was seen! My nakedness!"</br>  <br>So cute.</br>  <br>add red eyes and she's akame</br>  <br>and bigger tits</br>   No Ageha, not now, not ever.   <br>"So, after becoming boyfriend and girlfriend...what do we do?"</br>  <br>Yamato doesn't have a chance with her.</br>  <br><br><br>She looks like best girl to me.<br>Is she best girl?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure he does, she just needs to see the Kusanagi.<br>I had my fingers crossed for a 4 devas fivesome.</br></br>  <br>Magically in Majikoi, every girl is best girl, this is the truth that transcends knowledge and facts!</br>  <br> every girl is best girl <br> liking Sheila </br></br>  <br>Hound is the only reason I care about Majikoi</br>  <br><br><br><br>I've been waiting a long time for this.<br><br>Yoshitsune is cute.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Yes, I too want to become a 29 year old such as Azumi-san."</br>  <br><br>I'm afraid your only option is to give up and invest in the future growths of monshiro.</br></br>  <br>Sometimes she is the best, the majority of those moments is when she roped around by Yamato</br>  <br>It's not the same, Ageha is that desirable precisely because she's unattainable. She's Momoyo before Yamato pushed her down, but on nightmare difficulty.</br>  <br>Sheila NTRs the a girl in her own route and makes out with Yamato in front of her. Sheila a worst, worse than rape end Miyako.</br>  <br>Why live?</br>  <br>Thats what happens if she ropes you around and not the other way around :v</br>  <br> implying Miyako "bad" ends aren't the best ends </br>  <br>I am asking myself that question</br>  <br>"The manga I'm reading now is Akame ga Kiiru! I recommend it."</br>  <br>"From the sky a beautiful girl descends!"</br>  Why that mediocre VN has some much content?  <br>Bait: The Post</br>  <br>"N-normal girl? Somehow, I'm sorry."</br>  Since we are almost at the end of Majikoi-A series, objectively who are the best girls?<br><br>Benkei, Lee, Rinchu, Margit, Seiso are just miracles</br></br>  <br><br> Long black hair and black attire usually with katana. </br></br>  <br><br>All of them.<br>Every last one.</br></br></br>  There isnt a single bad Majikoi.<br><br>But Benkei is the undisputed Sex god-emperor of womankind. I mean goddamn. She took the term "Sex hair" and just went overboard so bad.</br></br>  <br>Is she Takahiro's Akame clone for Majikoi, like Kirsti is the Esdese clone?</br>  <br>"The interesting one's now are Nozaki-kun, Akame ga Kiiru and Barakamon."</br>  <br>My loyal comrade</br>  <br><br>I am glad I have found friends in this world.</br></br>  <br>shit taste. Momoyo ruined.</br>  Bestest mum  <br>"Yadokari-desu yooo"<br><br>tlnote: yadokari = hermit crabs :v</br></br></br>   5 days <br> 5 volumes <br><br>Tonight, we head to a sea of chaos.</br></br></br>   Fuck, I can't handle all these characters still having no clue about Ushio.           I don't think I'm autistic enough to understand what the fuck their talking about. What's all this vague social drama about? Is this a japanese thing?<br>When I was in high school the guys were always blunt and the girls were so fake that they ended up being obvious about their feelings as well.<br><br>Someone explain this shit to an adult</br></br></br>  <br> Why anyone and a group can't be friends if a pair of them become lover? <br>You need to get out of the house. Seriously.</br></br>  <br>This post sums it up quite well. <br><br> Not that hard. <br>Agreed. I don't know what's wrong with these faggots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what being a normalcool is like. Sometimes you actually get invested in relationships with friends, peers, girls, etc. and want them to work out.</br>  <br>Like I said, I witnessed it a few times and never became a big deal within the group.</br>  <br> Shit got too 1st first world problems for me. <br>It's been first world problems from the very beginning of the entire story</br></br>  Do you collect manga, /a/?  <br>I buy manga sometimes. I have some other stuff packed away, as I've run out of room.</br>  Anyone from the UK use the Viz US app?  <br><br>By "flush with the shelving" you mean to push them towards the front right? Been trying to figure out the most efficient way to fit as many books as possible while keeping things neat.</br></br>  Newfag coming through.  <br> Naruto <br> Fairy Tail <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  Soon.    <br/>  It airs in 8 more days.    I really hope they dank up the memes in this season.</blockquote>]
