I'd rather study him as a medical oddity. Guy's a fucking miracle of nature.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't you read? He's not going to answer your question.<br><br>He ignored you.</br></br></br>  Anybody know if the new demo for eyes of heaven is up  <br>up tomorrow i think</br>  <br>Between 10 &amp; 12 JST. So maybe in about an hour. PSN updates usually take 2 hours with content gradually going up</br>  <br>It's not even a sexual thing, I'm just imagining the gap being JUST big enough for the fry to slide gently inside and for some reason, this is really satisfying.</br>  <br>ah thanks was wondering since its 10am here and about 8am there and its still not up</br>   seriously considering a Joestar birthmark tattoo like this <br>How much of a faggot does this make me?</br>  <br>considering it's just a star, it's not that bad. nothing compared to getting a tattoo of your waifu or some shit.<br><br>it's fine.</br></br></br>  <br>only works if you're buff.</br>  <br>It's just a star in a not-so-visible spot. Perfectly fine. Nobody's gonna pick you out as a weeb for that.<br><br> The best part is if for some reason you stop liking JoJo, out of sight, out of mind. </br></br></br>  <br>its pretty Power Level if you think about it<br>however anyone who doesnt get that is from JoJo would think youre someone who gets a star tattoo for no fucking reason</br></br>  <br>I've never ever considered a tattoo in my entire life but I totally want one.<br><br>Would never ACTUALLY get one, but it's the only one I've ever actually wanted.</br></br></br>  DID HE DELIVER?  <br><br>A friend of mine from high school has a tattoo of the Keyblade from Kingdom Hearts. A star tattoo would be fine in a relative sense.</br></br>  <br>youd look like a fucken douche</br>  <br>yeah <br>all in all<br>its just a star</br></br></br>  <br> A friend of mine from high school has a tattoo of the Keyblade from Kingdom Hearts. <br>Wow.<br>That's terrible.<br>KH is my guilty pleasure but that sounds so fucking bad.</br></br></br></br>  You now remember Avdol.  <br>I tried to but instead I remembered your mom's hot wet pussy.<br><br>Mmmmmh...</br></br></br>  <br>gross</br>  You now remember Kekyoin.  What do you think Polnareff think about JoJo?    http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/fea<wbr>ture/2015-07-16/interview-jojo-biza<wbr>rre-adventure-director-naokatsu-tsu<wbr>da/.90413<br><br> But the JoJo's graphic novels, over the years, have become something of an internet meme, or at least they are the source of a lot of internet memes. One thing we can do today that wouldn't have been possible 20 years ago is pick up on already established memes and see how we can pull those into the anime. <br><br>DP confirms JoJo is a meme.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>Gay Priest when?</br>  <br>Love playing as Fugo, but I can't activate Purple Haze Feedback for the life of me. I always perform the command right when I'm in despair mode or whatever that's called and it doesn't active? Can anyone help?</br>  <br>Meme manga for meme spouters</br>  <br>Gyro hearts<br>Gyro steel ball<br>Johnny fingers <br>Gyro bear dots<br>Johnny horse in his hat<br>Johnny Scar<br>I could never find the other</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tattoos <br> being a degenerate <br>Pick two</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have 2 meters by the time you try it?</br>  <br>DP sure have their priorities straight. Also, I'm kind of curious to see what songs were on that list for the EDs.</br>  <br>Oh fuck. That makes sense too since Buccellati's revival move needs a meter. Thanks anon.</br>  I'm evil?  Could Homura realistically defeat DIO?  <br> Vampires <br> Drinking...wine <br><br>Dio, you is a shit Dracula fo' sho'</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just remember, all GHAs need 2 meters. A more powerful super requires you spend more. You get what you pay for in fitegaymes</br>  <br>CONFIRMED HE LIED</br>  <br>Yeah I'm retarded. For some reason I thought of PHF as a free ticket to turn the match around at the last bit of health, but of course it's an actual move that uses up the HH gauge.</br>  <br><br>Bigger version for all your wallpapery needs</br></br>  <br><br>Shit, wrong one. My bad</br></br>  <br> What was the process for choosing the ending theme songs like "Roundabout" and "Walk Like an Egyptian?" Is this a tradition that you want to continue in future parts? <br><br> Well, those came from the author of the original graphic novel, Hirohiko Araki. They're all songs that he was listening to back when he was drawing the individual parts. Mr. Araki only listens to Western music because he doesn't understand English, so none of the lyrics come across to him as language, but as pure sound. So we got a list of these songs that he was listening to back when he was writing each part, and we chose songs for the closing animation based on which ones Warner was able to secure the rights for. It was up to Warner to actually do the negotiating. So if there is an anime production of the next part, we'll probably go by the same process. <br><br>SONGS MUST BE OWNED BY WARNER CONFIRMED<br><br>EAT SHIT QUEEN FAGS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering I already have a tattoo of Gatt's brand, it's too late for me.<br> A star at the nape of my neck would've been pretty offputting anyway, regardless of the fact I'm in really good shape. Taking off your shirt would just become really embarrassing and make me feel like a flaming fuccboi. </br></br>  <br>Thanks!<br><br><br>Haha yes. Do you have a pick for an ED DiU? (Pick one owned by WB)</br></br></br></br>      <br>when people see your star tattoo they will   get a feeling so complicated  </br>  <br>Pet Shop Boys - West End Girls<br><br>You?</br></br></br>  I want to hold hands with DIO.  <br>Warner doesn't own Yes, dumbass.<br>He's just saying that they're the ones who take care of negotiating the rights for shit they don't own.</br></br>  <br>Don't we all, anon.</br>  Why is ASB so great and EoH looks like shit?  <br>Because you have shit taste in video games</br>  <br>I honestly can't think of any because I haven't listened to much music. I'll listen to your recommendation though<br><br><br>I didn't know Barbie had a vampire edition</br></br></br></br>  <br>Queen would still cost them a fortune and they're more likely to license Warner property.</br>  <br>The characters have really weird filters in EoH.</br>  <br>I know, but it's not restricted to Warner-only songs.<br><br>Just sayin'.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to be his wife.</br>  <br>I wan't to play a fighting game with my JoJos, I don't want to run around opening chests and throwing garbage cans.</br>  <br>He wasn't a vampire at that point</br>  Would DIO have been pissed if someone hurt Pucci?  <br>Play the Capcum game</br>  Is part 4 announced yet?  <br> I know. <br><br><br> Not wanting to look like a sexy slutty fuccboi <br><br>You're not deserving of the Joestar birthmark anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is only one true ED for DiU.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=L_j<wbr>WHffIx5E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Must feel weird to be asked by Warner on the behalf of a Japanese animation studio if they can use one of your songs in their Japanese cartoons.</br>  <br>The director and staff are already acting like it is. There was also an animation guy who tweeted out (and later deleted) something like "buy the BDs if you want part 5" which inadvertently confirmed part 4, unless they really are planning on skipping to part 5.</br>  <br> Not wanting to look like a sexy slutty fuccboi <br>I know, I'm a terrible JoJo fan.  At the very least i'm full on bisexual for Dio. </br></br>  <br> skipping one of the best parts for one of the worst </br>  <br>Don't do this anon. <br><br>I'm a part 5 fag and I could start a flamewar but I don't want to ruin this thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Giorno's trash, get over it already.</br>  <br>Really? I haven't been reading about it, do you have a link or something?</br>  <br> I'm a part 5 fag </br>  <br>d</br>  <br>Did you read the English versions or one of a different kind?</br>  <br>Shit, I'm warning you!!</br>  Why can't Tusk move in stopped time in ASB?  <br><br>Ladies, stop it, you're BOTH  overrated as shit. </br></br>  part 6 fag here <br>are parts 7&amp;8 translated?</br>  <br>Damn I don't remember this, are these the new translations?</br>  <br>Because DIO's time stops are strong and girthy. Big boy time stops. Diego's are bitchmade, lacking in protein and testosterone.</br>  Isn't generals agains the rules?  <br>Probably, Pucci was the only member of his book club.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4ui<wbr>tWji0j9E</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_tv<wbr>NN1km3Eg</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VRU<wbr>njCzgr9U</wbr>  [ ]<br>mixtape so hot it BURNS</br></br></br>  <br>English, but I understand Giorno's real personality even with the shitty translation. He's basically Jonathan but much classier and with a smoother vocabulary.<br><br><br>It's chapter 2 so it's probably the new translation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>moots gone.</br>  <br> Never shows any emotion other than concern for his allies and fear of enemy stands <br> gets killed off <br> gets revived <br> shows more personality than any other crusader by a landslide for one fight <br> back to boring right after <br>What was the fucking point?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes everything is on batoto mein freund</br>  This, Eckhardt, is my Stand.  <br>That's Japan for you. They didn't even like Part 6.</br>  <br>because everyone realized thet didn't like avdol so he stopped being "important"</br>  <br>Isn't Batoto some chapters behind on part 8?</br>  <br>YES, I AM!!<br><br>Also this which gets more amusing each time I watch it because I SWEAR the manga version wasn't this dripping in innuendo:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J_-<wbr>iyhQLiKM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>   EoH demo in literally minutes <br> New chapter on Monday <br>This is the final time of the year /jojo/ will be this active again.

Regardless, Batoto is the way to go, unless you want colored Jojo.</br>  <br>it's all caught up<br>you're good</br></br>  7&gt;5&gt;4&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1&gt;6  <br>What time is it coming????

I just had to screencap it when I saw it, it was too funny<br><br><br> implying jonathan wouldn't visit Dio in hell from time to time if possible <br><br><br>you don't 『stand』a chance against me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stop.</br>  <br><br>Clearly he would have the World do it for him.</br></br>  <br> Implying people in Hell get conjugal visits <br><br>I don't know what weird-ass religion you follow bruh but I've never heard that</br></br></br>  You guys wanna flockmod again?  <br>hilarious that this shit video is in 60fps</br>  <br>it's called Arakism, you can change the rules whenever you feel like it.</br>  <br>o i am laffin</br>  <br>we need a gif of Dio lips</br>  <br>that's not uncle Sam language</br>  <br>I want colored, currently in the middle of SBR<br>Where do I go? Colored Adventure just has first few and last few of each part + full 6</br></br>  I want to get the EoH demo but the only even close to fitan game i play is  melee  and i can't speak moon<br>Is it even worth downloading at that point?</br>  <br>I honestly don't know other than Colored Adventure, check the pastebin</br>  <br>yes.</br>  <br>The demo's free, you can't really go wrong with free.</br>  <br>I made one of the kiss.</br>  <br>Yeah but I meant asking if it was worth getting as in would I be able to figure anything out from context clues and how to play</br>  <br>There isnt one. Araki is a jerk. Like "he later died of a cold"<br><br>Or like how there is no requiem stand at the black sabbath fight.<br><br>Or purposely on jojonium corner it shows the ear with 3 moles, but the dio drawing has no moles... The manga does the same. Show dio's past and his 3 moles, next panel no moles...<br><br>I feel it's on purpose. He remembered danny saving johnathan's life, and made johnny save danny's life in sbr.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really like the way the Joestar Estate was modeled, you can actually spot the specific areas where some of the scene took place. Here's where Jonathan confronted Dio about Dario's letter.<br><br>Sorry for the ant-size and fire. The mansion suddenly started burning.</br></br>  <br>Really needs to be faster.<br>Try 0.5 milliseconds</br></br>  <br>Top of the stairs where George and his attendants walked in on the young JoJo and Dio fight.</br>  <br> "he later died of a cold" <br><br>THERE WERE VERY FEW THINGS IN JOJO THAT HONESTLY PISSED ME OFF BUT THIS, THIS WAS ONE.<br><br>WHY ARAKI. WHY.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>how are you uploading pics so quickly?</br></br>  I played Kars in the demo he's pretty cool, you can hold L1 and press circle to use the mask and fly <br><br>I still don't know the buttons someone pls help</br></br>  <br><br>Gyro's lips</br></br>    <br>Mother fucker</br>  Is Jojolion the most Alpha Jojo so far? Because I think he is.<br><br>Josph is a close second.</br></br>  <br>i love you Doc, I should look up how to make gifs so i don't have to be a bitch and ask</br>  <br>yeah same here how the fuck do u dodge now</br>  <br>The Creative Director said in a recent interview that the songs they pick for the OP and ED are based off a list of the music Araki was listening to when he originally drew the part and then they see if Warner can get the rights.</br>  <br>On how to make it from scratch? That I can't teach, but if you want to make quick gifs from youtube videos, you can use instagiffer.</br>  Timestop is possible in the demo. I'll tell you guys if it's the same effect as the anime.<br><br>Hell I'll just upload it on YouTube.</br></br>  <br>DS4 share button</br>  <br>i assume to make it from scratch you download the source video and use photoshop or after effects or some program but i don;t have experience doing that, only way to do it is to do it</br>  <br>If you stand still and press circle you dodge, idk man it's confusing as fuck</br>  <br>Stream it.</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>my new favorite toy, I'll put him right next to kekyoin<br><br><br>watch out</br></br></br></br>  <br>do they automatically go to a cloud or something?</br>  Anyone who can speak moon know what Jotaro is saying about Jonathan here?<br><br>Okay, I'll try.<br><br>Nah, I'm uploading them on Twitter and posting them here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you can barely do anything while time is stopped u get like 2 secs<br><br>ah thanks man was wonderin shit that takes a lot of stamina</br></br></br>  <br>So these...are combos....woah...</br>  <br>Good. The threads are absolute cancer right now and could really use a break.</br>  if ya beat kakyoin by beating him into the water drum it shows a quick image of it manga form  <br> twitter <br>ok thanks man</br></br>  <br>link to your twitter?</br>  I still don't get Josuke's powers<br><br>Can he freeze people to death by taking away all heat from the air?</br></br>  <br>technically he can but we don't know the extent of his powers, the amount he takes away could only be as big as the bubble probably.</br>  <br>https://twitter.com/AnddoTX<br><br>Timestop video: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vqR<wbr>RJrazaq0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Twitch stream: twitch&gt;dot&lt;tv/serviceghost<br><br>I'll start playing at 3 viewers!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Meppz are you here?  <br>He could probably freeze them to death by taking away heat from THEM. <br><br>I think the bubbles take a property away from something, and then bestow that property on the next thing they touch (generally "popping" the bubble as it were).</br></br></br>  <br>Meppz is dead</br>  <br> Anime timestop  <br>It's shit</br></br>  <br>Can you stop it for any longer?<br>I want to see it in it's full duration. I'm glad they kept the effect.</br></br>  <br> ????? ???????? <br>??? ????</br></br>  <br>Doc you do know how to contact Meppz?</br>  <br> PM him on reddit but he might take a while to get to it. Note, he's a mod for /r/stardust </br>  <br>Call him Gappy it's less confusing that way, and we don't know the extent of his powers so far the most wtf thing we've seen him do is taking friction away but I doubt he's going to get any instant kill capabilities.</br>  <br>People tend to forget that the arrow needs to actually choose you to get a requiem, like how do you get a stand</br>  <br>the kekyion didn't make a shit on my computer but that spoiler shit yes, but I am actually not mad<br>still fuck you you dirty son of a whore</br></br>  <br>Is he the one that's going to stream the HftF tourney? I should probably start practicing for that.</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br>What went so wrong?</br></br>  <br>i thought it was the other night?<br>shit when is it?</br></br>  <br>Technically he could but there are much more effective ways he could kill if he ever wanted to.

Is the first OVA an hour long, or is that both of them in one file? Because OVAs are usually like 10-30 minutes.</br></br>  <br>There's just one out at the moment.</br>  <br>That's one hell of an OVA.</br>  <br>s'alright</br>  <br>Watch it, anon.</br>  <br>T-thanks now it just looks like  she ripped out her eyes instead of gouging them out </br>    <br><br> Tittymonster </br></br>  <br>Sakurako a perfect.</br>  <br>Sakurako is so perflat</br>  <br>That's her name. Are you really going to claim that isn't her real name?</br>  <br><br>It's a crime to display those little butts.</br></br>    <br><br>This was so unnecessary. I remember facepalming hard when I first watched it.</br></br>  <br>The real crime would be not displaying Yuru butts.</br>  <br>a-are you okay?</br>  <br> This was so unnecessary. <br> facepalming <br><br>Remind me again, did we call 2010 and ask for their faggots?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ayano's pajamas accentuated her figure so much.</br>  <br>Seemed par for the course. I think sexual fanservice is boring, I just didn't focus on it.</br>  <br>What you say..?</br>  <br>I agree completely.</br>  <br><br>Do you guys possibly prefer dicks in your mouth, perchance?</br></br>  <br>You gay, son</br>  <br>Seeing it as sexual is your own problem. I thought it was a breath of fresh air seeing a bath scene where the characters aren't wearing towels for no reason.</br>  <br><br>I must claim responsibility for the thread's death. I killed it with my terrible Ayano pun. I'm so sorry. I feel so bad Baghdad.</br></br>  <br>p-please stop trying, you're literally worse than Kyouko</br>  <br><br> i didn't get this reaction when i made my flavour pun a few threads ago <br>does this mean i'm funny?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh stop it, Yui. You laughed, we all know it.</br></br>  <br>When they were in the hot tub it was fine, showing them standing around barely covered was unnecessary. The anime also had scenes like this and I didn't mind it because the focus was on something else. Even Chinatsu looking at Yui's back was about Chinatsu rather than Yui. <br>Although Akari having problems both times was funny. The bonk on the head sounded painful.</br></br>  <br>They didn't do the dirty kind of disgusting ecchi, just showed us the girls glorious little body to appreciate it.<br>If you can't, that's your problem.</br></br>  <br>Can't remember sorry<br><br><br> pic related </br></br></br></br>  <br> showing them standing around barely covered was unnecessary. <br>Being in that state of undress is actually pretty necessary for a bathhouse.<br>Excessive steam covering them from the shoulders down, or wearing a towel everywhere even though they're all friends hanging out at a bath would be unnecessary.</br></br></br>  Do these people ever become relevant?  <br>That's not what I mean at all. It's all about camera angles, or whatever the equivalent would be for anime. In  showing so much of the bath detracts from the scene. A close-up or something more dynamic would work better.<br><br><br>Also not what I mean. Scenes like  are a nice detail.<br>Also</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Himawari <br> not Ayano <br><br>Explain, Ukraine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally who<br>  no really who  </br></br>  <br>In a spinoff maybe.</br>  <br>Yuru reset</br>  <br> Futanari Himawari <br>If only</br></br>  <br> showing so much of the bath detracts from the scene. <br>It's not the most interesting shot, I guess, but I don't think it's bad. Honestly I can't think of other ways to handle showing Sakurako pranking Himawari while she's washing her hair that aren't unavoidably ecchi.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128181668 <br>Fine I'm a bit biased because I'm not a pun person, but even I giggle at the grand pun exchange between Yui and Ayano.<br><br>You just need to get better material<br> Take it as a challenge and make me laugh </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not a pun person <br> using exclusively Yui reaction images <br><br>Irony = funny, amirite?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui gotta be kidding me.</br>  <br>That's because I'm a Yuifag, nothing wrong with that.<br><br><br>I chuckled</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you found that funny, you really are full of it Nunavat.</br></br>  <br>Ayano I'm not funny; you don't have to rub it in.</br>  <br><br> it's funny when Ayano exchanges puns with Yui, but not funny if literally everyone else tries the exact same pun scheme <br><br>10/10, I've taken the bait. Tell my parents that I love them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sakurako has NOTHING</br>  <br>When I saw the initial screens I thought I was going to feel the same way, but the actual scene was actually rather funny and tasteful, nothing too overtly lewd about it.</br>  <br>you can't be this retarded, even in the show when Ayano puns Yui laughs like an idiot, when Kyouko puns Yui doesn't even try to pretend it was funny</br>  <br>she has shampoo though???</br>  <br><br> cute girls that get embarassed easily <br> no one bats an eyelash in the OVA about going full nude in front of everyone else <br><br>I don't get it. Does the steam in bathhouses change your brain?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like everyone in Japan is so used to seeing each other naked that body-accentuating clothes are what they find lewd.</br>  <br>It's different for bath houses. In fact bath scene nudity isn't even considered ecchi, and happens even in the most innocent series, becuase nips are used to naked bodies in public baths.</br>  <br>I only called it sexual because another anon said he face-palmed and thought he shouldn't mind it so much. But I did think it was a bit boring, sorry.</br>    <br>I enjoyed the gags that they had in the bathhouse, but humour is subjective. I respect your opinion, anon-chan!</br>  <br><br> "I respect your opinion" <br><br>Am I even on 4chan right now? Where am I?</br></br></br></br>  <br>In a comfy yuru yuri thread.</br>  There's a distinct lack of Chitose art on Pixiv and Danbooru. How sad.  Which Yuru do you think is Namori's favourite?  <br>Akari. That's why she bullies her.</br>  <br>Which Yuru got her own spinoff, anon?</br>    <br>Nadeshiko!</br>  <br> I'd like to think so because Akari is my favourite too. <br><br><br>Honestly I think that indicates that she wanted to show more of Nadeshiko and Hanako than Sakurako being her fave.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Sakurako is my favourite, but she loves Akari-chan so of course I do too!</br>  <br>That always confuses me. I don't think it would matter if I was used to communal bathing or not, if I were in a bath with my crush I would freak out, but it's like that always gets ignored. Octave being a notable exception.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Anyways I think Akari and Sakurako fans have the largest fanbase overlap between any Yurus, so either choice is fine.<br>They are also the two popularity poll winners among nips.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> It's a tie between Best Genkis</br></br>  <br>still mad about the het fling</br>  The OTP  <br>Except Kyoko is actually good at things</br>  <br>Funny anon, now that you mention it I realize that my top three girls are essentially Akari, her developing lover, and her fangirl. Basically Akari is the pillar of my Yuru love and her bestness is what decides who follows her.</br>  <br>Different culture.<br>You see that even lolis get bath scenes for example in anime, while they have a hard time getting any real fanservice, and it's because of that same reason too.<br>Bathhouse nudity is just natural in japan. Unless they take extra efford making it ecchi, it isn't even considered lewd or fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakurako is good at being cute, fun, and beautiful.</br>  <br> Where's the yuru thread, yuris? <br>on /v/<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/v/302810737 </br></br></br>  <br> Still having best girl arguments <br> Still talking about China being a rapist <br>I bet the majority of them have never even made it past 5 chapters of the manga.</br></br></br>    <br>Stay mad. Octave is perfect.</br>  <br>Sakurako is bad and drawing, studying, cooking, and any kind of skill required for a student council member.</br>  <br>There's a distinct lack of Chitose in general.</br>  <br> her developing lover <br>Is that Chinatsu?<br>Just asking because my top three are Akari &gt; Sakurako &gt; Chinatsu.</br></br></br>  <br>I love Octave, but I really do hate how the MC had sex with a dude she didn't know. I don't care that he was a dude, I'd be just as mad if it was a girl. She didn't know the person, and was already in love with a beautiful woman. It makes me sick thinking about what she put herself and Setsuko through.</br>  <br>Her being childish is one of Sakurako's most endearing qualities.</br>  <br>i exhaled through my nose at a faster rate than normal for almost a second</br>  <br>W-we have the exact same best girl order.<br>Can I be your friend, anon-chan?</br></br>  <br>I just want her to be good, but I can't find any redeeming qualities for her.<br><br>Even the spinoff manga doesn't make it all that easier.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's because she's terrible. Setsuko was partially responsible for it as well.</br>    <br>Sure.</br>  <br>It just really broke my heart. Even thinking about it now makes me feel awful  and I kind of want to cry. </br>  <br>Good at what?<br>Like I said, she has many endearing and lovely features.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry anon. tbh it is pretty heartbreaking, for both parties. But at least they discuss it (eventually) and move past it! That's why I actually like it as an aspect of the story. Even though reading it makes you feel like crap.</br>  <br>She and Himawari love each other. Do you really want to ruin that love by changing them?</br>  <br>i don't understand the third from the left in the top row...</br>  <br>I don't feel like Sakurako being less of a useless shit would ruin their love. If anything, Himawari loves Sakurako in spite of her personality most of the time and she honestly deserves more.</br>  <br>Whoever edited the picture is a shit.</br>  <br><br><br>Ren-chon is also some 120-ish cm actually.<br>There was some joke about it that I don't remember exactly, maybe something about the top of her hair gave her extra height.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why beside Koma-chan's height it says "self-proclaimed". Learn to read first.</br>  <br>She's a good cook. She made pancakes. That's about it, I think</br>  Chitose a best  <br>More please. Her and Chinatsu. Those are the two I wish to lewd.</br>    <br>Is it possible to lewd Chinatsu?</br>  <br>Thank you.<br><br><br>I hope so. I mean I like all of them but Chitose and Chinatsu are amazing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, Chinatsu really is quite sensual.</br>  Chinatsu is a satan  <br>Do they have pubic hair?</br>  <br>What went wrong after the first volume?</br>  <br>I like to think they shave/wax, but that's only because I'm a pervert.</br>  <br><br>I think the smaller girls don't have any, or just have weak, silky, hard to notice pubes.<br>Chinatsu is probably smooth as a newborn though.</br></br></br>    <br> Chinatsu is probably smooth as a newborn though </br>  <br>The thought makes me very horny. I really want to feel.</br>  Sakurako is a terrible character and must be removed. Join me at #removesakurako.  <br>They had to evolve past their larval state eventually, anon.</br>  <br>Sakurako is literally the best.</br>  <br>Do not bully the bestest.</br>    <br>She is the best, along with Akari.<br> Chinatsu a close second </br></br>  <br>Please tell me what a smooth Chinatsu's... lewdness feels like, to touch.</br>  I finally fixed Sakurako, guys. Now she's not shit anymore.  its 3am<br>you're half asleep<br>shitposting<br>its raining and theres lightning outside<br>you're home alone<br><br>you turn around as lightning flashes<br>and you see pic related<br>what do</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's a sign</br>    <br>why</br>  <br>I bet about 50% of people posting here are Finnish</br>    <br>My heart.</br>  <br>I'm sorry Saku, please forgive me</br>    <br>At least make the hair blonde too.</br>  <br> suddenly spats <br>I'm sure many people felt betrayed by this. I'm not even a Sakurakofag.</br></br>  <br>Cute.</br>    <br>I don't know, spats are miraculous on firm loli butts, and we at least got an underskirt shot like this.<br>I was quite satisfied.</br></br>  <br>I love spats, though.</br>  <br>What do firm loli butts feel like to touch?</br>  <br>a little surprised by how they came out of nowhere</br>  <br>Firm, I guess?</br>  <br>Once you will have an answer to that, you will know what heaven is like.</br>  <br><br>Describe it for me!!</br></br>  <br><br>But there was no indication whatsoever, given how long the spats actually are.</br></br>  <br>It's true that they were too long, but again we knew already that we won't get pantyshots in Yuruyuri.</br>  <br><br>Well this thread's already lewdbound seeing as everyone's starving for OVA news, so I might as well just leave this old screenshot here.</br></br>  <br>I don't know about that.</br>  The best Yuru    <br>Like nothing because they don't exist</br>  <br><br>Who is this person trying to sneak into the camera shot? I feel like I've seen her before.<br><br>Great picture of Yui, though!</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's  a ghost. </br>  If Sakurako was Russian, she'd be Slavkurako  <br>P U R E S E X<br>U<br>R<br>E<br><br>S<br>E<br>X</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If Himawari was born into Japanese royalty, she would be Himewari.</br></br>  <br><br>If Ayano saw Kyouko kissing Yui, she'd be Cryano.</br></br>  <br>She already saw them kiss. Everyone did.</br>  <br><br><br>ayano pls stay &lt;3</br></br></br>  What are the 5 best episodes? <br>I like the 2 comiket episodes, The childhood adventure, visiting the pool, and the valentines day dates.</br>  <br>If Ayano was a /pol/ poster, she'd be Aryano</br>  <br>Please?</br>  <br>Look at this instead and try to imagine.</br>  <br><br>Not sure about a Top 5, but my 2 favorites are the Field Trip episodes. Genki Kyouko is Best Kyouko.</br></br>  <br>1. Hold your arm out straight.<br>2. Make a fist.<br>3. Touch the top of your arm just before the elbow joint where it's meatiest.<br>4. Imagine that but bonier; even a well toned lolibutt is bony.<br><br>Source: have touched lolibutt.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should touch softer lolibutts too if you think all there is is being bony.<br>It's the silkiest and softest thing ever, unless she is too thin or too athletic.</br></br>  <br>I like my lolis athletic, not fat.<br><br>Allegedly.</br></br></br>  Goodnight, anon-chan-tachi.  <br>In no particular order and because I can't remember well, from S1, 1 and 12<br>From S2, 1, 7 (the sisters ep) and 10 (the second field trip)<br>Hopefully this isn't a mess to read</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good night, Anon-chan. Sleep well, desu-wa!</br></br>  <br>Why does the pajama adhere to her breasts like that?</br>  <br><br>Because Fuck Physics.</br></br>  <br>I compare it to how seeing a girl's pantsu is very lewd but seeing a girl in a bikini is considerably less lewd, even though you're seeing just as much.<br><br>It's all about context - it's normal to be naked in a bathhouse.</br></br></br>  I want to feed brat  <br>Sakurako is so lovely in that particular scene.</br>  Why does everyone pair Akari and Chinashit?<br><br>Akari deserves better than that</br></br>  <br>Yes, she does.</br>  <br>Looks like a mum and her kid.</br>  <br>Because Akari  perforce  learned to love because of her.</br>  <br>Wow how rude.</br>  <br>Chinatsu Self-Defense Force pls</br>  <br> Self-Defense </br>    <br>I  donut  want Akari to get fat.</br>    <br>Why does she laugh at the doughnuts?</br>  <br>cuz they're funny mang</br>  Yui dominates the battlefield  <br><br>Yui-senpai can dominate  me  anytime.</br></br>  Dead thread is Yui thread  <br><br> tumblr <br> gets trips <br><br>Kill me now.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Sakurako-sama, please save us!</br>  <br>God I want to fuck Yui.</br>  <br><br>What anime is this from? You know what, don't answer. Let's let the mods decide.</br></br>  <br><br>Only another pure Yuru can fuck a Yuru as pure as Yui.</br></br>  <br>I'm a Yuru in my mind.</br>   Chinatsu and Chizuru both don't like Ayano <br> Both their names start with Chi <br> They are both the worst characters <br><br>It all makes sense</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't fuck what's not real</br>  <br>its grim-sama</br>  <br><br> Chizuru hates the girl that she wants Chitose to end up with <br><br>Flawless logic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's other things in this thread, all over /a/ even, that aren't directly from anime. Don't be so butthurt.</br>  <br>Life is sour.</br>  <br>I want to give Mari something sour.</br>  <br>nigga</br>  <br><br><br><br>you people are weird</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br>How is summer treating you, friend?</br></br>  <br><br>stop posting Satan</br></br>  <br>I'm trying.</br>    <br><br>The mods rally are that lazy, after all.</br></br>  <br>Even though /a/ doesn't allow "/a/ culture" threads they still pop up all over the place. Posting moot is against the rules and nobody cares. If you're going to report every single one of those things at least be quiet about it.</br>  <br>Weird is a matter of perspective, Akari-chan. <br><br> But you're right </br></br></br>  <br><br> Posting moot is against the rules and nobody cares. <br><br>This was one of the stupidest "rules" I've ever seen.<br><br> If you're going to report every single one of those things at least be quiet about it. <br><br>Y-Yes, boss.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mari thinks you're a faggot</br>  <br><br>Does Mari realize that "faggot" is no longer an insult?</br></br>  <br>When was this announced?</br>  <br>Shortly after this happened and all hate in the world ceased to exist.</br>  <br><br>What kind of smut have these 2 been watching and/or reading?</br></br>  <br>If that were true, the word nigger would've stopped being an insult after the civil rights movement</br>  <br>I am fine with that and in fact I would enjoy hearing her say it.</br>  <br> Comparing real life drama to Mari and Kaede </br>  <br><br>Easy now, we're not in /pol/.

Her selflessness and generosity need to be repaid somehow.</br>   http://bato.to/read/_/333062/tomo-<wbr>chan-wa-onna-no-ko_ch102_by_love-li<wbr>ve-scanlations</wbr></wbr> <br><br>The sexiest</br></br>  And fucking cunning.  <br><br> Misuzu will never have the sense of desperation she needs to fuck you <br><br>why even live</br></br></br></br>  Best 93-chapter binge in recent memory. Then the daily wait began.  If the mangaka never draws any porn of this, it will be a crime.  <br>One can only imagine what kind of cute/sexy sound she made at that moment.</br>  <br> 93-chapter <br> each chapter is a page <br> 93 pages <br>Not much of a binge.<br><br><br>He already draws plenty of porn though, this one is him getting his vanilla fix.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you insert yourself into that panel </br>  <br><br>As which one though? Tomo or Misuzu</br></br>  <br>Dat sex hair</br>  <br>Tomo. Both sides have their charm though, now that I'm considering.</br>  We haven't seen Misuzu's love interest for awhile. I wonder if he's gonna try something schemey in here too, cause otherwise he's kind of a pointless charachter.  <br>Hence why I could actually bring myself to get through that many chapters in such a short time. No way do I have the dedication to do 100 chapters in a day of a manga with 20+ page chapters.</br>  <br>Oh wow. I thought his art looked familiar.</br>  <br> That tussled hair <br><br>I can't contain this boner, holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He also did the one about the tall tomboy and the American girl</br></br>  I wish we'd gotten more of this.  <br>So many tomboys to explore.</br>  <br><br>Oh god I just want to fuck Misuzu till its painful.</br></br>  <br>OOGA BOOGA Where da hatefuck doujins at?</br>  <br><br>I'm always happy to see good doujin artists getting real work. He is getting paid for this right?</br></br>  <br><br>I have no idea. It's not serialized in a magazine or anything, but maybe? I can't imagine he'd do a chapter a day with no recompense</br></br>  <br>That one was too cute to fap to</br>  <br>I believe it's just a 4koma he puts up on a website. Free aside from probably donations.</br>  <br>Fuck, that was this artist? How did I not put two and two together.<br><br>The best is the imouto one with the tender hours long love making..</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad she was the only one of the three friends that didn't go through suffering. Chiyuri's put a stupid grin on my face, Mayu's was sweet but sad, and Ameri's just made me frown.</br>  <br>Possibly ad-revenue as well. Its on a popular enough site to have a weird Fate Mahjong doujin on it.<br>http://sai-zen-sen.jp/comics/twi4/f<wbr>atemahjong/0019.html<br><br><br>That one was cute too. Except for the part where the imouto was raped horribly off screen.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Why is my arm numb?  <br>You slept on it?</br>  <br>Tomo's character design fires on all of my fetishes.<br> Tomboy <br> Medium length hair <br> dress down <br> fang <br> spats </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Jun the only entertaining boy? The other two seem kinda flat.  <br>Yanagida Fumita really is a great artist.</br>  I didn't think this would be true when I first started reading, but Tomo is actually third best girl.<br><br> Misuzu <br> Blondie <br> Tomo <br><br>Sorry Tomo, but you can't argue with those tits.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tits over character <br> Tomo is already stacked <br><br>You silly nigger it's Tomo -&gt; Misuzu -&gt; Blondie.</br></br></br></br>  Is anyone else using ameboide's webcomic reader extension? Seems like it stopped working for bato.to since a few days ago. Won't preload previous or next pages on any mango page  Now Misuzu will try to provoke Tomo to start flirting with Misaki-senpai.  <br>tomo is based and you are wrong</br>  <br>noOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>Trips don't lie, Misuzu's reverse psychology NTR keikaku has begun.</br>  <br>Well, I'd certainly be worried if they were busty.</br>  <br>Ok.</br>  <br> Dat sex hair <br>Nice</br></br>  MISUZU<br>I<br>S<br>U<br>Z<br>U</br></br></br></br></br>  Jesus where are the doujins?  Several seconds in MS paint.  <br><br>Damn Misuzu looks good after being roughed up a bit.</br></br>  <br><br>My god I want fuck the smug out of her<br>IT's so damn sexy and so damn madding</br></br></br>  <br>Is there some unwritten rule that artists don't do doujin's of their original work? The only one I can think of is the Unbalance x Unbalance guy but hes Korean scum.</br>  <br>And by doujin's I mean actual porn.</br>  <br><br>Three hundred years in paint</br></br>  <br>I want to make a mess of her!</br>  <br>Some brave soul needs to draw in blush, sweat, and those breath clouds what indicate heavy breathing.</br>  <br>It gives me trouble regularly in batoto. But I hate batoto normal interface, so I just never go there anymore. <br>Kissmanga for me.</br></br>  What are the chances of this getting serialized somewhere? It seems like something that could be made into an anime.  <br><br>My body couldn't handle it. I wonder if she'd get violent with you, she's shown no signs of actually being violent so far. I'm not sure she would, but I still want her to be mean to me.</br></br>  I need to know, what doujin has the smugest anime girl imaginable?  <br>Not violent, but pushy. Need some fanart of her pulling on a guy's necktie.</br>  <br> that disheveled hair  <br> that strand of hair in her mouth <br>Hold me back niggas. My dick cant take it no more</br></br></br>  I fear the day when we get beach chapters.<br> Tanned Tomo-chan. <br>I don't think my dick and body can take it.</br></br>    <br>im bettig they will follow Jun and see them doing locks and shit</br>  <br> Mizusu in a   white one piece swimsuit </br>    <br><br>I want her to tie me up with a neck tie.</br></br>  <br><br>Anon don't. DON'T<br><br>Someone fucking help me here</br></br></br></br>  <br>My flag stands at full mast.</br>  <br><br>Sweet jesus</br></br>  <br>Add on a 4chan logo and save it for the next time we get new banners.</br>  I know it's common in nippon animu that scientists are pure evil, but this is just retarded. <br><br>Dropped.</br></br>  That whole story she told was a lie. There are no scientists.    <br>Yeah it isn't very realistic that doctors at a particular institution would be evil<br><br>Everyone knows all doctors are 100% pure of corruption</br></br></br>   dropping something based on a plot arc that hasn't even come close to being fully revealed <br><br>If you were an anime I'd drop you</br></br>  <br> If you were an anime I'd drop you <br><br>He was obviously already dropped by his parents, so what's the point doing it now?</br></br></br>  B.. but you wouldn't know who is Charlotte if you dropped the show  It's common in all fiction about super powers. I don't know how you aren't used to it by now.  <br>Evil Scientist/Doctor has always been a thing in fiction.<br><br>How do you not know this?<br><br>Seriously?</br></br></br></br></br>  science is for nerds and nerds are all mad about being picked on in school<br><br>it's basic psychology</br></br>  <br>What is so strange about this? Some scientists are really corrupted.</br>  <br> just because everyone does it we should tolerate it </br>  <br>If you want to start complaining about shitty tropes, there are literally thousands of worse ones in anime</br>  <br> I'm an assmad saiyans nerd </br>  <br> it COULD be worse so it's okay </br>  <br>At least Mekakucity Actors didn't do it.</br>  <br>The frequency of it makes it pretty easy to swallow, yeah. It's just one of the two most common "reasons we don't reveal our super powers to people" explanations. And it makes enough sense, people really would want to study someone with super powers, it's not so farfetched that a scientist would do so using illegal means.</br>   Dropping one of the most popular shows this season <br><br>Literally no one will notice or miss you, hipster</br></br>  <br>I'm not saying it's okay, just that you should shut up about it</br>  <br> popular = good <br>am I really on /a/?</br></br>  <br> don't talk about a stupid plot point even if it's a fact <br>So you want a hugbox board?</br></br>  Can we change the topic to Nao's thighs?  I really don't know what to think. My common sense tells me most scientists wouldn't just up and kidnap and torture a person to study supernatural powers. But I do know there have been examples of horrible doctors experimenting on live humans (plenty of stories from WW2 regarding that), but there's really no precedent to go off of in real life to how they'd react to people with super powers.  <br>nigger its popular for a reason, looks whos making it. some shows dont deserve their popularity but this isnt one of them</br>  <br>No, I just want less shitty threads</br>  <br>Nobody has been kidnapped. The brother probably even signed a legal release for the experimentation.</br>  <br>Am I really on /a/? Since when does /a/judge a series based on who makes it?</br>  <br> on the internet nobody knows you're a top secret government scientist </br>  It's pretty stupid to be arguing about this before we know all the details behind it. It has been in literally half an episode, keep your angry reactions for later.  <br>It's funny because the post never implied the show was good or bad (opinion) but popular (fact), and you probably expected a circlejerk around your shit opinion and ended up BTFO instead.</br>  anyone interested in this?  <br><br> What are you trying to say? The joke is that he would have problems getting into a party but has to, if he could easily join and there was no struggle of any kind then what would be the point?</br></br>  <br>Because MC loves monsters and would rather get monsters to run away in shame and embarrassment than see his party members actually kill a monster right in front of him.</br>  <br>I thought that was only because he would just rather not fight monsters, getting them to run away is the path of least resistance.</br>  <br><br> I repeat my question; Where are you going with that? The point is for him to not fit, if he fit easily in their story would lose a big factor. <br> If you were just pointing it out then be my guest, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Do? Nothing?</br>  Episode 3 incoming (ch-5-6 of the manga) with the moon fever, all the girls looking for Darling's D.<br><br> Episode 8 can't come sooner with the best girl </br></br>  <br>Miia has fang and megame moe</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128197211 <br> Not even trying anymore </br>  <br> Megame  <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128197211 <br>Gr8 b8 m8 I'd give it 8/8.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/v/302851009   <br><br>You guys really aren't helping</br></br>  <br> papi getting nailed <br> Miia draw shit  <br> girls on underwear <br><br>Can't remember any of this things, I should go and re-read the manga again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Papi is best girl.<br>Cut your impotent testicles off if you aren't at least a bit attracted to her.</br></br>  3 episode rule, but the second episode was awful  <br>Is just the same secondaries over and over on every thread, they just shitpost the first 10 post here and then get BTFO. <br><br>Just report and ignore.</br></br></br>  Would you eat Poultry Harpy eggs?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128197441 <br>Anon, what the fuck are you doing?</br>  <br>Yes, but would lick the eggs clean of her juices before breaking them.</br>  all girls are best but Suu is THE best girl<br><br><br>if they're safe to eat, sure<br><br><br>i hope we get figures eventually</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lick the eggs <br><br>Jesus christ that is fucking disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br> Suu <br> best <br> not the only shit <br>Please, I haven't seen a blob that is a living loli shaming entity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably, I mean it's just a fucking egg.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128197686 <br>But /v/ is total garbage what are you talking about?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128197686 <br>Fucking leave.<br>I knew the anime would do this</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128197583 <br> we <br>Closet ponyfucker detected.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/v/302851009 <br>That seems like a big mistake there, OP.</br>  <br><br>Im trying to not make the same mistakes.</br></br>  LALA A CUTE<br><br>A CUTE!</br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Why is she blue</br>  Next issue when?  <br>She's suffocating</br>  What kind of alcohol do you think the girls would drink?  <br><br>Polt doesnt drink.

Do you have a source for that claim?  <br>And rightfully so.</br>  <br>Reminder that this show was actually extremely good.</br>  kyon-kun denwa    <br>If it was so good, then how come the story was never finished?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that's not a ponytail.</br>  <br><br>Because the author is a lazy fuck. What does that have to do with the quality of the released novels?</br></br>  <br>google.ca</br>  And then season 2 happened.  <br>The manga isn't even finished? I was wondering how this series ended. I dropped it in the middle of the endless summer arc, fuck that bullshit.</br>  <br> manga </br>  <br>Shows how much I know. I thought that Harumi was an adaption from the Manga. I guess not...</br>  I got enough closure after Shoushitsu, I'm kinda glad the anime adaptations ended there.<br><br>How do the novels end up anyways? Does something major change or is it all more or less still wacky antics with Haruhi?</br></br>  Just watched the disappearance again today, still one of the best anime movies kyoani did something right  <br> manga <br> harumi <br>are you sure you're not talking about a different series?</br></br></br>  Show name?  <br>  </br>  <br>I still wish there was the Snow mountain syndrome adaptation. It had a great mystery atmosphere, gave more closure to Shoushitsu and all of the SOS dan had more screen time.<br>Also dat seducing by character's clones.<br>I recommend to read it.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean *com<br> 2015 <br> misspelling Google address </br></br></br>  <br><br>When S2 was announced I hoped it was going to be animated. Think about it, it isn't really hard to shorten Sights to 3 episodes, Disappearance would take 5-6eps and we'd have around 2 left for a Snow Mountain Syndrome two parter, kinda like the island episodes.<br><br>It was a stretch but I sincerely thought it was a possibility. Until Endless Summer killed my dreams. I went full despair when the summer extended so much that even Disappearance was kill.<br><br>Fuck you KyoAni, I'm still salty over the bullshit you pulled.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit I just noticed when you put a country's initials after google it makes it their search engine. That's pretty damn useful</br></br>  The fuck is the author even doing? Playing Dragon Quest? Idolmaster?<br><br>I want my fucking Haruhi volume 13 (12?)<br>I want new Haruhi Theaters.<br>I want him to fucking finish Amnesia Labyrinth.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one knows. Maybe he's dead?</br>  <br>I think he meant any kind of queue of hair.</br>  I'm really disappointed in the author. He let us all down after promising to get his shit together last time. If he ever shits out a new book, I bet you it's going to be the last, with some shitty, thrown-together ending to get it off his back.  <br>In some interview I remember he told he got tired from Haruhi so if he'll do something it would be something new.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, just like SAO.</br></br>  <br><br>6/10 at best.</br></br>  Reminder that it's still hugely popular.  <br>You have to have autism, or take Aderall or some shit in order to deliver. You can't make a show with such a promsining premise and deliver, unless you're Togashi.</br>  <br>Then maybe he should have the balls and tell everyone that he's done with it. Not make empty promises.</br>  <br>Yeah, just like Naruto.</br>  <br>the eight days of summer was a fucking waste of the show.</br>  <br>I didn't say it was good.</br>  <br>I'm mad.<br><br>So fucking mad.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't it told that 11/12 is the last one?<br>We even got a flashforward with Kyon and Haruhi at college. It's fine ending.</br></br>  <br>I agree, but do you honestly believe that the guy won't make milk this shit as long as he can.</br>   Soon.   <br>What is he even milking, nowadays? Nagato's spin-off is selling like shit, there are no new novel volumes, no anime adaptations, no nothing.<br><br>Then again, there's that Pachinko machine.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigga i dont know, i am just brain-storming</br>  <br>Thanks a lot Satelight</br>  <br>Yea, like a decade ago.</br>  <br>He's rich. Doesn't need to work anymore.</br>  <br>He never said that. He was actually working on vol 12 after 11 but hasn't finished it yet. All he said was he's lazy so forgive him, not that he has no interest in Haruhi.</br>  <br> Lazy <br>That's not a word I'd use for not releasing shit in 3 years. Even Togashi works harder than this guy.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember shit like that. All I remember him saying was in 2011, that he had a "rough idea of what should be in the next Haruhi book" but that he doesn't know how long it'll take before the plan he had then would be turned into something ready for publication.<br><br>I was under the impression that he had entered major writing block, given up, and had stayed purposefully silent about the series ever since.</br></br></br>  Nagato's stern is very vulnerable.  <br>Someone needs to make a thread with people in it already</br>   not using an Abubear image to celebrate her kai 2 <br>Kuso, scuttle yourself.</br>  <br> posting worst bear </br>  <br>Fuck you all bears are good.</br>  I'm happy Nagato's tooshie has been more relevant than usual these last couple threads.

And even though the thread will probably go back to Kaga spam or Ooi spam, this was really great.<br><br>Would Nagapocalypse with you anons again anyday.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am saving images specifically for this day</br>  <br> THRRRRRRRRRRRRT </br>  You'll never be her KTKM.  <br>I'll always be ready and motivated for serious intellectual discussion of Nagato.

As discreet but no less beautiful than the morning sunrise...</br>  <br>No, you'll be the same cancer fuck off.</br>  <br>I don't want any potential future discussions of Nagato's tooshie ruined by spamming her like the other spammers.</br>  <br>How many fish did this kill?</br>  <br><br>Chill, its just collecting images, no spam, I promise.</br></br>  <br>I will post this occasionally till you like it</br>  <br>Collect them on your own, pixiv and nico exist just for that.</br>  <br>Way ahead of you.<br>Every bit counts though.</br></br>    <br>Is bismarks tits trying to eat nagatos?</br>  <br>Huh, this doesn't seem to be on danbooru yet.</br>  Abu~n  <br>I'll finally be able to redeem myself for scrapping my first CL, Shoukaku will have to take a backseat if Abubear does require a blueprint.</br>  <br>w-why you hating?</br>  Why aren't the aircraft carriers flat-chested?  <br>Some are, what are you talking about?</br>    <br>I started this argument some months ago, I got shitposted to death by the you know what -fags.</br>  <br>Most carriers aren't totally flat-decked. And in Shibafu's case, his carrier's busts are based on their hangar capacity.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Interesting. What does SK think of KanColle? I see a lot of content posted on Ilbe nowadays.</br>  <br>I tought it was their displacement, make up your mind.<br>All of IJN carriers looks flat, unlike the burger ones, they all look super fat and wide.</br></br>  <br>I think you'd have a better idea than me if you know of that place.</br>  When will Nagato stop being a lolicon and give Mutsu whats shes been begging for?  <br>So I assume it's a pro-japanese, Ilbe exclusive phenomenon and that we won't be seeing any kpop idols playing the game anytime soon, right?</br>  <br> I tought it was their displacement, make up your mind. <br>No one has ever said that as far as Shibafu's CVs are concerned. It has always been how many planes they carry.</br></br>  <br>The deck on Ryuujou is perfectly flat, there's no control bridge on top. Displacement was always a fan theory that made no sense since sister ships have different busts. Hangar capacity was something Shibafu confirmed himself. And you're right that burger ships were generally wider; they'll have to get Aoki Ume to draw them.</br>  <br>All the people I know who play Kancolle in real life are Chinks.<br><br>I'd think that despite how people perceive Chinks and Gooks perceive Japanese, there are a lot of people who don't care about it as long as there's cute girls.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm okay with burger ships designed by Aoki Ume.</br>  <br>How about Mutsu become loli</br>  <br>but lolis cant ara~</br>  <br>But the only non-loli romance she wants is for her beloved TTK to romance her rear end.</br>  <br><br>Maybe I mixed them, because it kinda of makes sense since kaga is a little fatter than Akagi irl. Still, it doesnt make it less biased since they carried pretty much around the same amount of aircraft, they either need to buff Akagi or nerf the other, I belive they are not counting Akagi's full reserve.</br></br>  <br>Yes they can.</br>  When will Hibiki get a real kai 2 with good stats?  I want to rub my face against a sweaty Yuubari's armpits and butt.  <br>Dekabrist soon.</br>  <br>RJ?</br>    Yamashiro.  <br>Kaga mai waifu</br>  I wouldn't mind an if remodel for Akitsushima that makes her a repair ship...  Believe in Konishi.  <br>Please no blueprint.</br>  <br>good</br>  <br>What else are we going to do with these medals?</br>  <br>Still shit, if this crap have a Blueprint, I'm gonna scraping.</br>  <br>What's wrong faggot? Don't have 20 medals lying around?</br>  <br>Feed 8 to the cranes, and at least 4 to the inevitable event ship that requires them.</br>    <br>I want to play with those little bumps on her chest.</br>  <br> flat <br><br>Sure, she is a light cruiser.</br></br></br>  <br>I have enough medals for that, but no, I don't want to waste in this shitty Kuma.</br>  <br>She's not flat, are you blind?</br>    Not sure why they replaced Ashigara with Kaga yesterday. <br><br>Maybe she gets something as well.</br></br>  <br>No that's and old drawing that was on the cover of something.</br>  <br>yes and?</br>  No translations today, but I did spend a while tinkering with ffmpeg.<br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>96971<br>DL of original: http://tinyurl com/ozblyrr</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>It's for promoting the dazzle camo version of her figure, but Shibafu was too lazy to repaint his original drawing so they had to do with the old one.</br>  <br>I just started playing this year</br>    <br>Why is she so perfect</br>  <br> mfw no Kana Asumi ship </br>    <br>It's happening!</br>  <br> tfw no KugiRie ship </br>  <br>Stupid sexy Ooicchi.</br>  This kills the Kitakami.  <br>I'm hoping for that Kugyuu ship.</br>    <br>I love Kitakami's hair.</br>  <br> 4 tsunderes <br> expecting more. </br></br>    We need more sadistic shipgirls  Where is the best place to get Abukuma? I got her twice before, I don't know how but she disappeared from my fleet. I remember I did put a lock on her  <br>I was just reading a book about kamikaze, don't do this to me.</br>    <br>2-5. Got her and Kinu consecutively.</br>  <br>It looks pretty similar to what Abukuma's carrying.</br>    <br>It's the situation that desperate that we need kamikaze fairies?</br>  <br>It's a sign, we'll be fighting Re Kai and we'll need new strategies.</br>    I love it  I really hope that's for midget subs and not actually Kaiten.  <br>They wouldn't dare, right? right?</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind though since tsundere is the cutest dere and she hasn't voiced tsundere girls lately.</br>  I think I should translate something. Still mad that I lost my Abukuma though  <br>Translate the Yamato short story!</br>  I like her.  <br>She speaks funny.</br>    <br>She speaks like sex.</br>  <br>Is kinu worth keeping? Nagara class as a whole seems boring with exception of Abukuma ofcourse</br>  <br>If you want to Kantai collect, then they're worth keeping. If you don't like her, then it's okay.</br>  <br>They're cute and Kinu is kinda rare.<br><br>If you're a statfag then no.</br></br></br>  <br>Tatsua is actually a maiden</br>  Why is the pairing tag so short?<br> 225 results </br>  <br>Because nobody cares about Abukuma.<br>Until now maybe.</br></br>  Wo-kyute.

His brainy friend Armin tells tall tales about deserts and oceans beyond the massive walls that guard their civilization, and his girlfriend Mikasa is equally entranced by the birds that soar over those untouchable barricades. Unfortunately, Eren's wish to see the walls opened to the outside world comes at a devastating cost.

It seemed out of character for him to tell someone something specific about his past. He could've just had an inner-monologue to fill the reader in on his relationship with Kenny, but him opening up to her still feels kind of odd to me.  <br>Oh yeah, Petra 2.0<br>but seriously why are there so many short light haired white girls gettin wasted</br></br>  <br>There was no relationship. He later told everyone about Kenny and that he was an Ackerman like Mikasa.<br><br>Manlet only cares about Erwin and pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Hanjo the banjo.</br>  <br>What? He clearly said he lived with him as a kid, that's called describing a relationship to someone else. I never said they had a caring relationship. I just said him bringing up Kenny and telling Nifa that he knows him is strange. <br><br>And I don't think he told anyone in his squad that he's an Ackerman yet. The first time he actually referred to himself as an Ackerman was when Kenny was dying. It's doubtful Isayama would pass up illustrating Mikasa's reaction when she finds out.</br></br></br>  <br>Hinting at his troubled past is how Levi flirts.</br>  <br>It's possible he was going to follow that up with<br> yeah, so I know he's pretty dangerous and might try to blow people's heads off <br>but didn't quite get it out in time</br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about Levi's relationship with Nifa, that she was nothing really special to him.</br>  So, I was considering why Grisha went after the Reiss family and I began to wonder whether MT is really the bad guy. If we consider that Grisha himself was the coordinate (i.e. The end goal of a mission) then it opens up a few possibilities. That MT was after Grisha because he was dangerous and that Grisha seized the Reiss power to further his goals. I think Grisha attempted to pass his ideology to Eren in the same way that the First King passed his to the Reiss family.  <br> And I don't think he told anyone in his squad that he's an Ackerman yet. <br>I think he already had his suspicions about it. He did say that he had the same Ackerman power Kenny and Mikasa had.</br></br>  <br>Why would Mikasa care? It's only if it affects Eren in some way. I think the Ackerman line is done and Isayama is going to focus on Mikasa's Asian side next.</br>  <br>Kek.</br>  <br>Grisha implied to Eren that life outside the walls was utter shit and it seemed he wanted to change that, so I think he was an ends justify the means type of good guy. <br><br>With MT's casual disregard to life though I can't see him as a good guy.</br></br></br>  <br>What did Ymir and Historia rank?</br>  <br>Yeah he had a hunch but now he knows for sure. <br><br><br>She spent half the series having a one sided grudge against Levi. Isayama would probably get a kick out of illustrating her reaction to finding out they're related. I do agree he's going to focus on the Asian clan, hopefully, but I do think Levi will properly tell his squad about it when it becomes relevant again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>69</br>  <br>That would make sense though. Grisha wants to destroy all the people outside the walls. When he saw how well life worked within the walls he reaffirmed his position and is going to try to set Eren up as the new King, after giving him the ability to control titans<br><br>MT on the other hand only has shown a casual disregard for the people within the walls, which he considers similar to animals in a pen.</br></br></br>  <br>Lewd.</br>  <br><br>1) Eren<br>2) Manlet<br>3) Erwin<br>4) Hanji<br>5) Mikasa<br>6) Jean<br>7) Nanaba<br>8) Armin<br>9) Bert <br>10) Historia<br>11) Reiner<br>12) Annie<br>13) Mike<br>14) Marco<br>15) Erd<br>16) Sasha<br>17) Connie<br>18) Ymir<br>19) Moblit<br>20) Gunter</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Isayama would probably get a kick out of illustrating her reaction to finding out they're related <br>I guess it does have the potential to make her reaction amusing, but I'm not sure she would be that shocked, especially if she already has a hunch about their connection. Then there's the fact that Mikasa has been developing little by little, and she shows more respect and trust towards the manlet.</br></br>  <br>Good to see Historia in the top ten. Is she getting more popular again?</br>  <br> Nanaba <br> Bert <br> Mike <br> Marco <br> Erd <br> Moblit <br> Gunter <br>The troll votes are stronk.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The pole was full of proxyfags and let each person vote 5 times besides, so it's pretty worthless as a judge of anything. <br><br>Also the top 3 all had tens of thousands of votes, while those below that only had a few thousand at most.</br></br></br>  <br>She just had an entire nearly all about her. Of course she's going to be more popular.</br>  <br>Bert has ranked in the top ten in every poll since Clash.</br>  <br>Eren, Manlet, Hange, Erwin and Mikasa usually always make the top 5.</br>  <br> she shows more respect and trust towards the manlet <br>That's true, but she did smile when he got punched so I think a little grudge remains. I find her reactions funny and it's ironic how someone she initially hated is now connected to her. It could be pretty funny if Isayama decides to bring it up. Levi figured out he was an Ackerman, but I'm not sure if Mikasa caught on yet. It could still come as a shock to have their connection confirmed.</br></br>  will BRA ever be together again  <br>They were never together to begin with. Annie was a lone wolf who clearly thought little of Reiner and Bert outside the job.</br>  <br>I'm betting no. It seems like Isayama's setting them up as semi-sympathetic characters, so you feel bad for them when they never meet up again</br>  <br>I think even with that considered, aside from Nanaba the positions are pretty believable.</br>  <br>I hope they will reunite somehow</br>  <br>They are literally made for each other.</br>  <br>This so much. Now let's dump some YH pics too.</br>    <br>Not on my watch.</br>  <br>SUNK<br>&amp;<br>DELUSIONAL<br>CRACK</br></br></br></br>  <br>Historia wants Eren's dick. Accept the canon truth.</br>  <br> Eren <br> having a dick <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why Historia wants her</br>  <br><br>EH will give us Freedom from the tyranny of the EM and YH fags.</br></br>  <br>Does anyone honestly think EH has any chance of happening with given how much the anime, the spoof and even the chibi spinoff push for EM?</br>  <br>I think Eren's going to die, so it doesn't matter who he gets paired off with.</br>  <br>I think Isayama is going for a sibling-like relationship for EH considering Eren pretty much carries Frieda's memories with him.</br>  <br>The spoofs and spinoffs are made for laughs and EM being mutually canon is the biggest joke of all.</br>  <br>anti-bert fags btfo</br>  <br>They also show that Mikasa would pretty much kill herself if Eren ends up with someone else.</br>  Is Mikasa regarded as best girl here?  <br>Bert is the second best character in the series and the best male character overall!!<br><br>Only Ymir is better.<br><br>And Mikasa is the third best and the best female character overall!!<br><br><br>Yes!! She is so amazing, always thinking about Eren!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the worst, actually.</br>  <br>Didanwhisperer pls</br>  <br>seriously speaking it's probably either hange or historia, leaning on hange</br>  <br>Hange &gt; Annie &gt; Sasha &gt; Mikasa &gt; Ymir &gt; Historia</br>  <br>Manlet pls.</br>  <br> Mange <br> girl <br>pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>I find her the most attractive one but she really needs something going on for her character besides "MUH EREN"<br><br>Best female character is definitely Hange.</br></br></br>  I can see YH happening, but I cannot for the life of me see Eren returning Mikasa's feelings. It's canon that Mikasa has a crush on Eren, but their relationship isn't romantically canon and I don't think it ever will be and that's why EMfags are just as delusional as the rest of the shippers. Eren never showed romantic interest in her, he never really showed much interest in her at all. He cares about her and wants to protect her because they have history together and they've been through a lot, but I don't think this equals to romantic love on his part. Eren will either die or the series will end without any romantic development for them. <br><br>Isayama said time and time again that he doesn't want to disappoint his fans. Do you really think he'd pair up fujobait like Eren up with a woman? Never. He's going to keep them all single.</br></br>  <br>Manlet is the one calling her shit glasses and smelly tranny. Moblit is triggered so he shitposts against manlet.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter because all the characters are fucking dying in the end.</br>  <br>I wanna pork Carla</br>  <br> Isayama said time and time again that he doesn't want to disappoint his fans <br>Then let us hope he browses these threads and knows how much Annie is loved (and life and a miracle of the universe) and doesn't kill her off horribly.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128186397 <br>We should start an official EMYH alliance</br>  <br>Eren is just a generic clueless shonen MC. He cannot return her feelings until the very end because nobody really wants to see the two of them dating in a series about killing titans.<br><br>Besides, Mikasa's dick is already too thirsty for Eren for her to develop romantic feelings towards somebody else.</br></br></br>  Since LM fucked in the live action movie i'm taking it as implied endgame.  <br>Fuck I feel bad for him, normally I hate charaters who are edgy and brooding for no reason but if I was Levi I would be bitter as well.</br>  <br>You could if that were manlet and not some OC.</br>  <br>Hot.</br>  <br>I'm not saying Mikasa will develop feelings for anyone else. I'm just saying her love will likely remain unrequited. If you hadn't noticed by now, Isayama loves that crap. Mikasa got a thing for Eren, I'm not denying that, but I just don't see him returning her feelings. It would be strange if they kept up the relationship they have now and then suddenly became official last minute. There needs to be some build up, so I don't think he's going to abruptly return her feelings at the very end. It would feel forced and random to make something like that official when Eren didn't show any straight-forward signs of liking her romantically throughout the entire series.</br>  <br> They called Levi an OC so it wouldn't spoil the manga audience. </br>  <br>So they made the most popular character of the series an OC just for the sake of shipfaggotry?</br>  <br>nah<br>It's Petra</br></br>  <br> red shirt  <br> best girl </br></br>  <br>Haven't you noticed by now that all Japanese directors are shipperfags?</br>  <br>She was so brave.</br>  <br>Just think of that broken spine and crushed organs. Her death is one of the best in the series.</br>  <br>noble to the end</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks, Annie</br></br></br>    <br>I love you Petra<br>good night sweet princess</br></br>  <br>You say that as if it's shocking or something.</br>  <br>Mikasa is shit.

She might even be the worst character overall.</br>  Best looking females<br>Historia &gt; Frieda &gt; Carla &gt;&gt; Mikasa &gt; Sasha &gt; Not-Annie &gt; Annie &gt; Anka &gt; Mina &gt; Petra &gt;&gt;&gt; Hanji &gt; Ymir=Ilse</br>  <br>I never realized how much the guy in the second panel looks like a titan there.

Armin and Eren look more like females than male.</br>  <br>Thank you Annie</br>  <br>I hope by "brooding for no reason" you're not referring to Levi, because then I'd have to question whether or not you missed the entirety of his backstory. I'd say he has more reason than anyone to be brooding.</br>  <br>Yeah because he's fujobait and we all know the popular fujobaits must suffer the most.</br>  <br>I thought he was sad because of his landwhale following.</br>  <br>That anon said he felt bad for him and would be bitter too if he were him, meaning he understands manlet has his reasons for being the way he is. He just worded it weirdly.</br>  <br>I woudn't say Levi is edgy.</br>  Young grisha reminds me of that dude from MT's chapter  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128185585 <br> Falling for this bait <br>No wonder they say Ymirfags are dumb.

Not to mention that MT is blonde.</br>  <br>I see, guess my mind is playing tricks on me again.<br>Thanks for the pic by the way.</br></br>  <br>He sort of resembles Grisha, but then again he also resembles Erwin's father.

This has been shown a bit in the mangos already before.</br></br>  <br><br>The swimsuit isn't part of the uniform, unlike those silly Fuso witches.</br></br>  <br>I still wonder what they thought when they included that.<br><br> Hey, why don't we let them wear swimsuits as their uniform? </br></br></br>  <br>So I'm too busy to participate in this thread; however, I would like to remind you all that Eila is the best witch and that although the others are also good, they will never be able to stop worrying if rain falls.</br>  <br><br>Well, they are the Fuso Navy.</br></br>  <br> too busy to love the witches <br><br>We'll do it for you.</br></br></br>  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51407468<br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51407687<br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51407825<br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51408076<br><br>These are pretty cool, I don't think they're all canon.</br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr>  <br> bottomless hoodie <br>Why isn't this a tag.</br></br>  <br>Where do I buy this hoodie?<br>I'm willing to spend multiple dollars.</br></br>  <br>Try hoodie no_pants.<br><br><br>I'd get one too, I already have to SW-related shirts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I use only hentai</br>  <br><br>If the witches relied on  semen  as the main source for their magic, these could've been used at the home front to raise supplies.</br></br>  <br><br>Naked_Hoodie is.</br></br>    <br><br>If only Sweater Woozles was a tag.</br></br>  <br><br>  Sweaty Woozles </br></br>  S3 when?   you will never steal Perrine's glasses and hide them where she won't find them   <br>I hope you'd give them back eventually.<br><br><br>No idea, I hope for 2016.</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like "help" her find them for a price.<br>Said price is patting her on the head.</br></br>  <br><br>You can't just steal Perrine's glasses and not wear them.</br></br>  <br>Would you help Erica stealing Ursula's?</br>  <br><br>Of course.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't think it's as cute if I steal them.</br></br>  Is it okay to get multiple witch dakis if I love them all the same?  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>My dream is to have all the dakis so that I can surround myself with my loved ones.</br>  <br>Couldn't they get fitting suits?</br>  <br><br>Those poor tailors work so hard to contain the boobie monster, but it's just not possible.</br></br>  <br>This so much.<br><br>Even if Minna finds love again, it will never be the same as all lesbian witch couples or Mio x Hijikata.<br><br>Minna's future fiancé won't know how to care for her in case she ever has a breakdown related to the war.<br><br>If Mio has Hijikata, Perrine can get Amelie.<br><br>For Minna, there is no one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nipples it's not one of the witches just some random catgirl from a doujin he contributed to.</br>  <br>She stands at the top so she's unreachable</br>  <br>Maybe she gives all the men on her base blue balls by teasing them constantly.</br>  <br><br> the top <br><br>Is that so?

Dohohooo..</br></br></br>  <br>I'm more surprised that there are actual Navy and Marine witches at all. <br><br>Here's one</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying he didn't deserve it hell the man broke the sound barrier i just found it odd.<br><br>that's what they only one though right i find it just as annoying that the P-40 and 47 get no love either not to mention several British planes.</br></br></br>  I WANT CORSAIR GIRLS AND I WANT THEM NOW<br><br>ALSO HEAVY BOMBER GIRLS<br><br><br> fucked if I know how that would work </br></br></br></br></br>  It's funny how Ostmark is designated as the country with etc. etc. Axis aces.<br><br>Plus a Pole.</br></br>  <br>what about a qt mossie?<br><br>Elia and Sanya should also hate each other. just try to forget about that stuff<br> there were poles in AH which is what ostmark is supposed to represent. </br></br></br></br>  <br> ALSO HEAVY BOMBER GIRLS </br>  <br>That's a fighter niggar</br>  <br>That's not a heavy bomber at all.</br>  <br>that's defiantly a P-51 striker<br><br> you will never get to go on long range B-29 missions with witches <br>pure suffering</br></br></br></br>  I really wish Eila would've interacted with the other witches more.<br><br>For instance, I always thought she would be constantly perplexed by Erica, who would never react to the way she wanted to her trolling attempts.</br></br>  <br> you will never have witches defending your bomber formation on deep strikes into neuroi controlled territory <br><br> you will never fly along with witches in fighters knowing all you can do is be fodder <br><br>Why live.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bombers seem useless in SW. There is no point in strategic bombing if there are no hives on the ground.<br><br>We did get a Dambuster Lancaster in s2 though.</br></br></br>  <br>Erica and Eila would get along well, I can imagine them getting drunk together.<br><br>Erica constantly teasing her about Sanya.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to impregnate her.</br>  <br>Well I'd imagine traditional bombers would be converted similar to the PBJ ground attack series, mounting fuck loads of firepower in the front to just stand a chance.</br>  <br><br>Erica is damn near designed to deflect Eila's shenanigans.<br><br>Eila's perfect target is a large breasted, glasses wearing girl who's either too stuck up (Perrine) or doesn't have much confidence. So, basically Heidemarie - who has the bonus of talking to Sanya behind Eila's back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to impregnate every single witch.</br>  <br> Mfw he didn't forget New Zealand <br>THE ANZACS WLL RIDE ONCE MORE</br></br>  <br>ANZACbro! Kiwi or Aussie?</br>   people would willing fly normal planes against nueroi <br>Do people have no common sense. A normal plane has nothing to hurt one anyway. Much less why bother if you're going to die anyway.</br>  <br><br> Implying anything done to get near a witch is crazy. </br></br>  <br><br>Hello wizards from the future, how's the winter over there?<br><br>Yeah just sit on your butt and do nothing.<br>Anon no, that's not the mentality to win anything. Didn't shounen series teach you anything!?<br>Never give up or give in and always give your best possible.<br>Also letting witches do everything over you, have you no shame as a man? Plane squadrons can bait neurois into following them whilst coordinating a offensive with the witches on cleanup. You gotta think other purposes and strategies. Naval forces can do effective barrages and ground forces have their own toys that work on the smaller stuff.<br>Sure the real planes can't do much for the offensive on their own except maybe for the 75mm cannon planes which are impractical anyways.<br>And in the end you get to fly alongside the angels themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think some here would pretty much do anything to be in the SWverse.</br>  <br> wanting to die a shit death because you wanted to get close to a witch <br>It's like you don't know you can just stand on the sidelines and fap.</br></br>  <br>MEDIOCRE</br>  <br>I'd rather not fight a useless fight. A normal plane in that era can hardly keep up with a witch, no one ever bothered to put anything bigger than machine guns on them, while witches get cannons.</br>  <br> fapping to witches that are on the brink of death <br><br>Alright edgemaster.</br></br></br>  <br> Religions <br> Olympianism, Ygdrassilism, Cult of Dracul <br><br>I guess we're sticking with the "neroi at Israel" line.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you read Fuso Sea Incident? The planes were put to make a bait run to lure in the big hive after them while another witch squadron would flank from the sides to the main hive. In the end the plan worked.<br>The witches go as fast as their real counterpart planes do in general, only in agility planes lose big time and effective distance flying.<br>Also most fighter planes onwards 1942 have 20-30mm cannons in general but as I said they're still kinda useless unless it's small scale neuroi.</br></br></br>  <br>The winter is nice, a bit rainy, but nice.<br><br><br>Kiwi, you?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sure the real planes can't do much for the offensive on their own except maybe for the 75mm cannon planes which are impractical anyways. <br><br>I'd highly debate that. Any plane with anything larger than with a 20mm with decent APHE/HEF/HEI/FI ammunition would be enough to mulch a neuroi. You would have a much, much harder task getting a neuroi into your gun sights, and a harder task of evading the fire.</br></br></br>  <br>Aussie</br>  <br><br>Other ANZACs? This makes three of us. How many do we need for a squadron?</br></br>  <br>Twelve. Four for a flight.</br>  <br>Ah, so one more for a flight. Any other ANZACs lurking in here?  or anyone else that wants to join ANZACs </br>  <br>I'm from NZ but I'm not in the army.</br>  <br>Australian Army reporting in!</br>  <br>Are there even enough RNZAF and RAAF aces for archetypes?</br>  <br> There were 103 air aces from Australia during the Second World War. <br> There were more than 80 aces from New Zealand during the Second World War. <br>That's plenty enough for a dozen.<br>With that said, good night.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pierre Clostermann's book mentions Australian and New Zealand pilots flying alongside him a few times. They weren't neccessarily aces though.</br>  <br>There was a lot. Australia and New Zealand had extremely high numbers of servicemen in comparison to their small populations.<br><br>NZ was hitting way above their paygrade during the Italian Campaign as well.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Silly Yuno. You're not a koala.</br></br>  <br>I love strike witches and have been in strike witches threads from the start. I even made this god hand edit.<br><br>I'm excited for the new OVA since lynne is mai waifu, My one and only. <br><br>And this may be cheesy, but I've always had a passion for aviation that was only reinforced by strike witches, so much so that after University when i spent a year as a neet, i decided to instead of wasting time, get a job and learn to fly. And now i have my private pilots license and i'm working my way up to getting a commercial license.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw no Pan in Super   <br><br>It's not an episodic series.

Improve your career and your body and then worry about girls. Don't waste your youth.</br>  <br>Yeah, just reread it last week and despite the passage of  over 5 fucking years now holy shit  time it still has some spark to it that I like a lot. Such a damn shame it ended right there, it's always fun to have authors do something utterly different from what they usually do because they bring such a different perspective vs those that do that genre all the time. Demon World seemed neat too.  Guess this'll be one of those eternally regretted cancelled mangas god damn it. </br>  <br>I beg to differ, Shouko had great Shoukos.</br>  <br>Shame modern women suck.</br>  Murcielago   just friends   <br>reina doesnt get along with anyone.
