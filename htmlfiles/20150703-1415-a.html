Pity though, she was my favorite part of the show.</br>  <br>The club was literally responsible for all of this, and then had the nerve to blame her for it. Fuck that club, and fuck Sonora.</br>  <br>I'd fuck Sonora, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>pls explain</br>  <br>I could explain it, but are you ready for it?</br>  <br><br><br>whoo?<br>what?<br>did she died?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sonora did nothing wrong.

It was inevitable.</br>  <br>Special was the best, because Sonora finally got her chance to shine.</br>  So the last five minuets of the last episode.<br><br>What the fuck was that? She has the ability to completely alter reality? And it affects the other club members?

Like quite a lot of anime.  <br>If they stuck to the source material, would anyone here actually remember this show?</br>  <br>If it still had the same 10/10 OST, maybe.</br>  <br>Where was you, when we were sitting in these threads, waiting for yet another chapter to be translated by based Subarubro?</br>  <br>No, I didn't. Because they fucking dropped that plot line so hard, I thought they were just saying that they have a good imagination.<br><br>And then they shoot up the fucking school.</br></br></br>  <br>Rento wouldn't react like this if something crazy wasn't going on.<br><br>Also, what's there to not understand?

It's  gangsta.   <br>used girl 0/10</br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>Do I need to listen to good rapists like Puff Diddy, Fifty's Scent and Little Wine to truly appreciate this anime?</br>  <br>Sorry bro, you can't enjoy this show if you're that white.</br>   VAs are great <br> OST is okay <br> Animation is uhh... <br><br>Conclusion: Read the manga.</br></br></br></br>  I just feel like the show could use a little extra style to make it better. As it stands it's got a lot of grit but not a whole lot else  <br>yes it is akame ga kill 2.0</br>  <br>They're nothing alike, it's more like Samurai Champloo on literal steroids</br>  <br>but it is, with any fucking show there are always similarities<br> antagonists are a group team <br> antagonists are edgy, half of the time no one likes these fucks is simply because they're being massive dicks for no reason <br> author relies on edgy antagonists and their crimes in order to rile up the reader against the evil group <br> muh rape </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> literally reposting bait from the thread yesterday <br>disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, not yet anyway. Right now it's just average.</br>  <br>It's a fucking mafia plot you stupid fucking Weeb, every single mafia plot creates antagonists in this way, from Godfather to Jojo Part V.</br>  <br>None of which is just there to shock, but integral part of each character storyline<br> antagonists are a group team <br>Wow really. If for you it's about what and not how every anime will look the same to you</br></br></br>  <br>The manga is better. Read that and drop the anime.</br>  Whats there to hate?  <br>Especially since the latter part of the series relies heavily on action.<br>Unless the animation gets better Manglobe just can't do it with all dat QUALITY</br></br>  <br>I just read the manga, because the first anime episode was promising.<br><br>Of course, it had do drift to this clusterfuck plot of human society discriminating xxx like in Black Bullet etc.<br><br>Why not just a chill Gangsta anime?</br></br></br></br></br>  It's great, so all the show is going to get is shitposting. After it's finished it'll get a few random threads ala Jormungand.<br><br>If only it'd started airing during winter when the kids are back in school.</br></br>  <br>I get the feeling you are a bot. You said the same thing yesterday over and over again. didn't /sp/ used to have this same thing? people getting riled up by imaginary people?</br>  <br> &gt;antagonists are a group team <br>I'm guessing you keep posting this because it was your first manga ever and it traumatized you by how bad it was?</br></br>  butthurt gangstfags detected tbh  <br> bots <br> 4chan </br></br>  <br> any of those niggas <br> good </br></br>  <br> Animation is uhh.. <br>Animation is okay, nothing fancy but it does it's job</br></br>  <br> calling them rapists instead of rappers <br> misspelling their names <br> thinking that anon was actually being serious </br></br></br>  <br>Thinking anything is serious</br>  It's pretty good<br>The only thing I have to say is why the fuck did the guys with the guns just stand there and do nothing while they got cut up</br>  <br> tell other people they can't detect a joke when you can't detect a joke </br>  <br> niggas <br> good <br>FTFY</br></br></br>   Gangsta <br> there are no niggers </br>  <br><br>So this was a joke and not meant to be taken seriously in any way? Ok.</br></br>  <br> can we shoot this guy? <br> no, he's deaf, you don't shoot at deaf people, that's wrong! <br> oh, okay </br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J_K<wbr>J1R2PCMM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This is all I can think about. Not to mention, they probably did not know how to use firearms well and the one guy turned to run.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How fucking new do you have to be to think that it sounded normal? Or is it just the American gens in you speaking?</br></br>  I'll just copypaste an older post of mine.<br><br>I've read the first 30 chapters of the manga, over the past few days, to see what it's all about. It's certainly entertaining, though it also hits some bumpers, like the seemingly overt need to proclaim every other page how oh so gritty and hard-boiled the whole story is. Various times, it starts to get grating.<br><br>"Hey, hey, look how violent dat gangsta life is! Look at that rape, maiming and casual death! Oh, did you notice how oppressed the twilights are? Did ya? Maybe that point needs to be driven home some more!"<br><br>The story came across a bit convoluted at times, though that may be, because I was reading the thing by the volume. Overall it looks like it wants to be a more hardcore Black Lagoon. The characters are entertaining though and the action can look cool in animated form, if they put a bit of budget behind it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> on /a/ <br> taking anything serious  <br><br>U ばか negro?</br></br></br></br></br>   Gangsta   <br> Samurai Champloo <br>It's more like Gunslinger girl without lolis.</br></br>   generic love triangle between 2 bros and a ho' <br> author is a woman. <br>I can even see the ending now. <br>The blondie will try to kill the mute one and then the whore will shoot the blondie from behind.</br></br></br>  <br>Purityfags get out.</br>  <br> &gt;Animation is uhh... <br><br>ya better read the manga that has zero animation, nice logic fuckface.</br></br></br>  <br> one guy with a katana wipes out entire group of guys with guns <br><br>yes it is. japan really needs to stop jerking themselves off with this meme any chance they get. the anime is titled GANGSTA, gangsters use GUNS not SWORDS.</br></br></br>  <br> more likely than you think </br>  <br>Episode 1 of AgK atleast gave you a setting. Apart from the asian money, I got nothing about the world of Gangsta. Their town might as well be the only on in existence as far as the first ep goes.</br>  So what’s the deal with this series? The manga has been on my backlog for 2 years or more, but I've always avoided it, despite recommendation from other Anons, mainly because it has a female author and looks like a fujobait. Now I decided to give the anime adaptation a go, given that it's done by Manglobe, which did an excellent job with Samumenco. I am a bit shocked, to be honest. The episode was filled to the brim with stereotypes and tropes that one wouldn't expect from a woman author, such as:<br> prostitution <br> rape or at least sexual exploitation <br> powerless women in a patriarchal society <br> men taking away the job of a woman and pretty much oppressing her <br> men forcing a woman to serve them as a secretary <br> constant sexual innuendos <br><br>Seriously, what's up with the author? Does she get off from all the rape and depravity? The rest of the series seems to be relatively alright, with the exception of the typical fujo male MCs: bara bear and another more boyish bara, both super strong, sociopaths, aggressive, violent, yet reliable and secretly kind, especially towards the female MC, which is not only a reformed prostitute (favourite troupe for women) but also appears to be the author self-insert character. I really don't know how to feel about this whole thing. There are some enjoyable bits, but it just screams of fujobait from a perverted rape-loving slut of an author.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   watched 1st episode and enjoyed it <br> think this anime will be about criminals, hookers and gang wars <br> read the first couple chapters of the manga <br><br> demihumans with superpowers <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The episode was filled to the brim with stereotypes and tropes that one wouldn't expect from a woman author, such as: <br>Underage urban westerner detected. Not my fault your only notion of woman writers are SJW trash woman.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, here in the West we don't usually glorify rape doujinshi. We prefer good works with some artistic value.</br>  <br> fifty shades of black lagoon double penetration edition. </br>  <br>Yea, pretty much. Though it's a bit more believable when the badass MCs are male.</br>  <br>Not having seen either AgK or Gangsta, if the show isn't about the setting then it shouldn't matter all that much if they don't show off the setting. If it's character-driven then that should be the focus.</br>  <br>It can't be so shit. This is bait guys</br>  <br>Good job watching anime and discussing it on an anime board</br>  <br>So over the top fun and gory?<br><br>Sweet</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127489180 <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Yea like Fifty Shades of Grey right</br>  <br>really? fuck what is up with japan and super powers. why cant they just make interesting shit liek gang mafia naime without injecting some supernatural element iinto it.</br>  <br>Overrated post</br>  This motherfucker is too good for the show.  <br> 2 year backlog <br>slowreading shortbuser detected</br></br>    <br>Read Banana Fish</br>  Holy fuck a deaf character who is pretty strong this is fucking nice.<br><br>Loved the first episode, OST was fucking great, Alex is a 9/10 cutie used goods and Nicholas is the fucking GOAT.<br><br>Can't fucking wait for more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> someone posting my posts again <br>well my original point was you fucks need to stop saying shit like "they're nothing alike" Theres a bunch of shitty ass problems that akame has that gangsta had as well, denying it would be autism on your hand</br></br>  <br>What I don't understand if people saying this is fujoshit, when, as you said, there is an obvious love triangle between the two MCs and the prostitute and when neither of these guys look like what fujos find attractive in general. How some people find similarities with a fujobait like Free is beyond me.</br>  <br>Banana Fish is #1 biggest fujobait to ever exist. It's literally<br> Get My Vagina Wet: The Comic </br></br>   super powerful humans called Twilights <br><br>And dropped.</br></br>  <br> worst tripfag on /a/ likes the show <br><br>Another reason why it's garbage.</br></br></br>  <br> implying a white Japanese gangsta samurai isn't fast enough to slice bullets with his 1000 time folded katana </br>  <br>It wouls be boring if superhuman people stood there shooting fags instead of doing superhuman shit.</br>  <br>see you next episode</br>  So are there going to be any black characters in this show?  <br>besides saying super humaans why is the show garbage?</br>  <br>Without a doubt, I rate it 8/10 on the shittiness scale.</br>  <br> Lelouch likes this show <br><br>Fuck</br></br></br>  <br>A broken clock is correct twice a day, or once a day if it's a 24 hour clock. Lelouch is the 24 hour variety.</br>  <br>at least there were no superpowers, if you disregard Ash's OPness</br>  Is Lelouch the most famous tripfag on /a/?  Its pathetic attempt at salvaging trainwreck that is Manglobe.<br><br>Essentially they are trying to score on the trend they were involved on themselves:<br>1st was Jazz Space Cowboy by Sunrise and Watanabe<br>2nd was HipHop Samurai Champloo, by Manglobe with Watanabe<br>3rd was Samba revenge Michiko no Hatchin, which while was decent paled compared to those two.<br><br>This trend was continue by Watanabe himself with redneck hooters Space Dandy with Bones.<br><br>Now Manglobe, as makers of Champloo and Hatchi try to score on it to, trying to get some money and doing Generic Sound Gangsta stylish show.<br><br>Except unlike the others:<br>- theres no Watanabe<br>- its not original, but based on shitty manga<br>- they have no budget<br>- Nujabes are dead and Tsutchie ost while good does not fit the theme of the show thus failing the key point. <br><br>RIP Manglobe. You endured too long. Just die already, TWGOK ended.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked the part where she was getting fucked in the alley.</br>  So any Alex nudes?  So after watching this show it is basically like GTAIII the anime  <br>infamous</br>  <br> GTA 3 <br>picked up</br></br>  <br>50 cent was a beast in is prime, which was basically 2002-2003.</br>  Underwater or Deadfish?  <br>Yotsuba, with his charts is.

Note that half of the twilights don't fucking follow them either <br>  twilights wear these stupid dogtags for no fucking reason other than powerlevels. It's literally the source of discrimination and hunters can easily remove them which goes to show they don't need it. <br> if you're upset about twilights wait till you meet the hunters, which are normal people, but with even more power than twilights. No reason given.  <br>  a shitload of mc are doing some pretty incompetent things and making some pretty stupid choices every once in a while. <br>  really awkward writing, one particular one that stands out would be the niglet with the kukris.

Just enjoy the show.</br>  <br>Do you even hookers?</br>  I liked it.

Watching Gintama from the beginning is taking ages.</br>  Killy is a special agent sent by the Net. He is the same kind of creature as the Safeguard. He is not a human and he is not a cyborg either. Cyborgs are a specific type of living entities in the Blame! universe which are not the same as Safeguards. Cyborgs are bound by physical laws while the enigmatic Safeguards can be summoned out of thin air and have infinite energy. They are more like "programs". I say program because the world of Blame is a "cyberdungeon" where the internet is treated as a sort of magical dimension of infinite energy which has things like administrators. When the protagonists do meet an administrator in the story, albeit briefly, it explains that Killy is a pre-Safeguard model. Hence, the Safeguards became glitched and they fell on the pre-Safeguard backup.  <br> Abara style was truely the best <br>Fucking this. It was perfect.</br></br>  <br>But that's Digimortal.</br>  <br>What did Killy and Cibo do in the thousands of hours in the elevator?</br>  Thank god Nihei didn't become architect.  <br>You know exactly what they did.<br> card games </br></br>  <br>Yeah but he drew it around the same time.</br>  <br>Why is Sanakan best girl?</br>  <br>I don't they spent 250 years in that elevator. I think that was the amount of time between that Dhomo flashback and Killy and Cibo finishing their 800-hour elevator ride.</br>  <br>They  plugged  their  cables  together and  became one .</br>  <br>They had  a nap. </br>  <br> freaky meta-post-human sex </br>  <br>They spent only 800 hours in elevator, you idiot.</br>    <br>That's about 257 years.</br>  <br>what would he do if he was a architect?<br>drawn some bullshit concept, gone broke cause nobody want to hire him, and start drawing mango</br></br>  <br>i just always assumed he was synthetic parts but in a squishy meat like form. a fleshy like android with the personalty of someone long dead digitally stapled on to it.</br>  Tsutomu "fuck handrails" Nihei  <br>Handrails stand in the way of natural selection.</br>  <br>It's called silicon m8.</br>  Obligatory.  <br>he isn't Shaft</br>  <br>his next work confirned to be SOL gore fest</br>  <br> Nihei manga by Shaft </br>  <br>Worse than Kojima's child</br>  <br> what would he do if he was a architect? <br>He wanted to do manga around the age of 20 already, pretty sure that's way before he finished the university.</br></br>  <br>imagine Shaft adapt Blame Gakuen</br>  Can I abandon reality and wander the megastructure forever with the Oculus yet?  <br>You can pirate Naissancee, it straight up rips off some of the Blame! environments. Prepare for heavy breathing noises though.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Soon<br><br>http://bac9.tumblr.com/<br><br> Just kidding, never. </br></br></br></br></br>  Did Killy even seek adventure?  He reminds me of Ichise.  So, what was Cibo?  <br>Only if it involves permadeath from creepy Safeguards lurking around the corners. No gravitational beam emitter.</br>  <br>Which Cibo? Corpse Cibo, Gravity Furnace Cibo, Motorcycle Cibo, or Bear Cibo?</br>  So, when does the Blame! animated special come out? I know its supposed to be included with the BDs, but I don't know which volume.  <br>A human engineer, then a rogue human engineer, then a human mind downloaded into a safeguard killing machine, then a human mind downloaded into her own body from an alternate timeline and then infected again by a high level safeguard downloaded by Davinulnevasffasdasdbluhblah which caused her to lose her mind and regress to infantillism and then she  became one  with  a girl  to donate her genes to create a sphere with the necessary components to give birth a human carrier with net terminal gene harvested from Seu's genetic information.</br>  <br>Are you too stupid to do simple math?</br>  <br>What does simple math have to do with divining knowledge I don't have?</br>  <br>Killy walking simulator-kun are you here?</br>  Killy was an extremely heavily modified human police authority who was issued the GBE with the intent that he would be able to succeed where all other possible legal authoritative actions had failed.<br>After wandering for thousands of years, his memories have greatly deteriorated, and he no longer remembers what Earth was. He does, however, still remember his mission in the vaguest terms. The Governing Agency appears and re-briefs him on his objectives every now and then, so as to ensure he does not completely lose track of his goals. He did not even recall that he was a modified human until the Safeguards injected him; thereby reactivating the mechanical functions that were dormant inside of him. <br>He has lost most semblances of human emotion due to the extensive absence of other humans and the sheer extent of time that he has been alive; but he does retain primal human emotional responses. He flies into a rage, smiling vindictively when he massacres the dock workers who were harvesting the organs of the native peoples. He expresses an unclear, but certainly present sentiment before killing Schiff. He flies into another rage after reviving from 14 years in a comatose state, encased in rock; shooting wildly with his extremely powerful gun in a display of dominance, survival and inadvertently his remaining humanity. He sheds a tear when Cibo and Sanakan die, in the most poignant and perhaps most obvious of his emotional signals. The last real human emotional response we see from Killy is the look of absolute exhaustion when he climbs into the level that was currently being built at the end of Volume 10. He claws his way up through a hole he blasted in the megastructure, and just lies down face-up in the pouring rain, unmoving for a time. <br>So yes, Killy was and is a human.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good analysis. Makes sense to me.</br>  they all look like entourage to me, this fucking architect improved his drawing in Sidonia. Fuck Blame  Is the person with Killy in Blame!2 Cibo or is it the orb thing Cibo gave birth to  <br>It's neither. What? It's a far-future descendant of Pcell; it's a Silicon. Blame 2 was made to show us that, at some point, the Governing Agency and Killy stopped deeming Silicon Life to be a threat, or hostile.</br>  <br>Ah, makes sense</br>  <br><br>You can do it now if want, but you must also pay the ultimate price.</br></br>  <br>It's more like, sillicon life stoped being cyborg murder machines and started being new generation humans.</br>  <br>$3.50</br>  <br>Is this Biomega?</br>  <br>What game was that again. I remember someone posting about it couple of weeks ago</br>  <br>it just keeps going. That looks great</br>  Where did Killy get this pizza cutter from?    Seu best boy.  <br>Davine's hacking sequence was beautiful. The way the river widened to represent firewalls and additional security was brilliant.</br>  <br>Maybe from the armory where he also got his temporary shotgun? The pizza cutter is a useful tool for things where you don't want your primary weapon to leave 40 kilometers hole.</br>  <br>He did come out armed to the teeth.</br>  <br>The Safeguard or Governing Agency logo would cool on a phone case or something.</br>  <br>How do we know that Killy used to be a human police authority on Earth? I always thought he was the same as Sanakan or Dhomochevsky. I agree in every point that Killy is immensely old and broken/empty/confused, perhaps due to being such an old model reawakened for a special mission, but I doubt he was human at any point. He has Safeguard vision and can auto-regenerate lost body mass.</br>  <br> he was the same as Sanakan or Dhomochevsky <br>Sanakan and Dhomochevsky are beings downloaded to Base Reality, while Killy is not.</br></br>  <br> nanomachines <br><br>NANOMACHINES ARE NEVER MENTIONED EVEN ONCE IN BLAME!<br><br>GOD I HATE MILLENIAL SCI-FI<br><br>EVERYTHING HAS TO BE NANOMACHINES</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Why can't he be downloaded to base reality? Killy is a special agent from the Net entrusted by a mission from the Governors. Why insist that he's a modified human and not an entity downloaded like all the other agents we know? Sanakan recognized Killy and says "Killy your functions have been restored?" after he awakens eye hax. I would be convinced that he's a regular (augmented) human if he didn't get recognized by other safeguards.</br>  Cool, a Gantz thread!  <br>Because it was never shown at all, duh. Whenever something happens, he just wait till his shit recovers and goes further. If I were to put it in some terms, Killy is a relic from the past and a human with upgraded firmware/hardware, while Sanakan/Domo are pure software that uses (temporary) hardware to exist in base reality. He's and old model that can't do fancy downloading stuff, otherwise he'd done it all the time.<br>Also, I think it was hinted that Sanakan knew Killy personally, not because he's a safeguard.</br></br>  <br>I think it has to do more with access rights. The main conflict in Blame! is that the proper access rights to the Netsphere have been lost which is why he can't backup his brain and download it to a new body all the time. The Authority manages to basically hack their way into doing it once for him but they warn him that that won't work again.</br>  <br>I'm more of the opinion that Killy "forgot" about certain functions and eventually recovered them, such as his eye scan ability. I think Killy was very confused/lost about who he was and what he was, the only thing he knew for sure was that he was looking for net terminal gene. I don't think Domo didn't do any fancy shit in particular, he stood quite equal to Killy despite being clearly identified as a special safeguard. For the sake of the discussion I also wanna point out that Cibo asked a Governor if Killy belonged to the Safeguard. The answer was negative (he is pre-Safeguard) but the fact that she had to ask means that nothing that Killy did at any point during their travel was proof to Cibo that Killy was not Safeguard. If Cibo herself can ask whether Killy is a downloaded being then I don't know what we can take as proof that he isn't.</br>  <br>Please don't bully Beetle-kun</br>  <br><br>There is a very rare and real possibility that, the character was inspired by Killy from BLAME!</br></br>  <br> here, just got home. <br>He existed before the Safeguards. It is stated in the manga that he is not a Safeguard. That being said, he is clearly not a "normal" human either - he has OP regeneration and all that. The same can be said of Cibo, though: she had the weird spider shit coming out of her fingers that fixed Dhomo's jaw and worked with computer interfaces, and survived as essentially a corpse for a very long time. <br><br>The majority of standard humans when the Netsphere entered chaos clearly had, at the bare-minimum, the technology for extreme body modification. The cult that became Silicon Life even had the ability to turn the bodies of living humans into bizarre knock-offs of low-level Safeguard models. The Safeguard was a fully-automated system designed to protect the Netsphere. <br><br>However, before the Safeguard system was implemented, there must have been a defense system that was not fully automated - one that utilized humans by heavily modifying the components of their bodies in order to allow for greater protection against significant threats, and offered methods of more successful offensive movements. <br><br>Killy logically must be one of these agents: the Governing Agency repeatedly delivers orders to him and him alone. It never so much as acknowledged Cibo, as I recall. Also, he has the GBE, a weapon that is classified as something to be used only when all other potential variables have failed. It is uniquely classified, and would not be obtainable by anyone other than an entity of great legal authority. Dhomochevsky and Iko revere the weapon, and are clearly afraid of its potential. Killy displays a proficiency in using the GBE among numerous other weapons, showing extreme accuracy and knowledge of force. Also, you'll notice in  that he's checking corners; not a behavior traditionally performed by ordinary humans, Silicon Life or Safeguards. <br><br>Beyond that, we have Nihei's word that Killy was "probably a police officer".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To clarify, I meant that the Governing Agency ignored Cibo when it was relaying the status quo to Killy. Obviously it spoke to her when it answered her question about him.</br>  <br><br>You messed up on one tiny little part. Killy was never issued a GBE. When the Level 9 Safeguard erases what's left of TOHA Heavy Industries' structural support manifolds, and Killy loses 40% of body mass. During the restoration period, when we see glimpses of his past from the recovery partition in his body, we see what is likely him at the VERY VERY VERY beginning of his travels. At that point in time he does not have a GBE.<br><br>The art book, BLAME! and So on, also mentions that Killy found the GBE during his travels and has made an effort to always go back for it. The city most likely created this out of the sheer chaotic nature of it's growth or someone else in the city attempted to manufacture it, but was obliterated by a Safeguard response before they could use it. Anything is possible, but word of god confirmed that the Governing Agency did NOT issue a GBE to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet the Authority send off Sanakan at the end like it's nothing. In that case Killy should've appeared at their "base" too after being destroyed, yet it never happens, because you can't kill the bastard. Just think about it from technological level. He's really fucking ancient, which means that downloading wasn't (or rather shouldn't be, if you want) a thing back then. So what they did is modify humans to make them indestructible, and at some point in the future they got rid of weak flesh.</br>  <br><br>70 anon, 70 kilometers, on the lowest setting no less. Level 4 Extra punches holes through the megastructure and it's holes are probably thousands of kilometers long.</br></br>  <br><br> doing it once for him <br><br>What? Please cite where this happened, I don't recall it once; and I've read this damn story well over ten times now. As much as I'd love to read it again, don't make me read it all over again to figure this out.</br></br></br></br>  <br> probably a police officer <br>That's probably him remembering BLAME oneshot, nothing else.<br><br>I think he's talking about the end of second volume, right before Killy blew up a hole in megastructure the Authority tried to communicate with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, yes. The Authority communicates with Killy often. However, I thought the other anon implied that the Authority at one point redownloaded Killy from backup into base reality. Which as i recall, never happened once.</br></br>  <br> word of god confirmed that the Governing Agency did NOT issue a GBE to him <br>no it doesn't, go back and re-read the paragraph that I know you're thinking of - it just says that the only reason they didn't encounter other Safeguards with strong weapons was because they weren't where most Safeguards were spawning or could operate<br><br> At that point in time he does not have a GBE. <br>in the first fucking (clear) panel of the flashback he has it in front of him<br><br>also, from the artbook you're inaccurately quoting<br> So why was the unsteady Killy able to carry such a thing? <br>Well as you should know, it's because he's this really extraordinarily special person.<br>As expected, is it because he's the "Secret System Messenger"....?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Authority at one point redownloaded Killy from backup into base reality <br>That certainly never happened.</br></br>  <br> Which as i recall, never happened once. <br>Correct.</br></br>  In preparation for Symphogear GX, let's discuss what our favourite girls and songs are.<br><br>Having just finished season 2 to get ready for GX, I have to say Seigi wo Shinjite Nigiri Shimete is definitely the best Symphogear song. <br><br> I want Hibiki to push me down and have her way with me. </br></br></br></br>  I want to marry Chris.   Seigi wo Shinjite <br> not Rainbow Flower <br><br>Do you even UTAE?<br><br> I want to do butt stuff with Hibiki </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but HIBIKE HIBIKE HEART YO</br>  <br> not wanting to roar the elegy of love at full throttle </br>  I'm in this for Tsubasa.  <br>I'm in this for everyone.<br>Symphogear is not complete without all the gears, even the new ones.</br></br>  <br>I love DMJii, but Maria is still useless.</br>  <br>Maria is trying very hard. She'll surely be useful when she gets Airgetlam back.</br>  I'm surprised there's no s3 spoiler.  <br>Where would you even get spoilers from? Symphogear is an anime original. <br>At most you can find are some impressions for the episode 1 prescreening but they don't really tell you more than the trailers do.</br></br>  <br> Maria is trying very hard. <br>That just makes her more annoying.<br>I hope she stays locked up after the episode one duet. That's all she's good for, judging from G.<br><br><br>Chris-chan is cute.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This thread is now a Tsubasa worship thread.<br>Also every Nana song best song</br>  I bet Phara will knock Tsubasa out in episode 2.  <br>And then Maria saves her with her kung-fu skills.</br>    <br>I'm not on my home pc, I don't have any Tsubasa pics. Please forgive me for posting things scavenged off the official site.</br>  <br>I'm digging the sleeveless uniforms.</br>  Post Kirika.    <br>DESS</br>  <br> yfw you realize she has a scythe because she keeps saying DEATH </br>  <br>Or because her name is Kirika, which means  I want to fuck Kirika .</br>    I just want to befriend Aoi Yuuki.<br/>  <br/>  Who tops?  <br>Fine</br>  <br>I'm going to get yelled at, but there's something about her eyes that make her seem insincere.<br>Not even in that video, but just in all her photos.<br><br>It's probably just because they're so black, which feels unnatural to me.</br></br></br></br>  What are the odds that Chris' song isn't disappointing again?  <br><br>Isn't that just true for all VAs and Idols, or even maybe to japanese in general?<br>It's not like they're ever being encouraged to be open and sincere towards others. Even seemingly random losing of control and showing of emotion seems somehow artificial and follows specific social rules.</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably mostly a VA/idol thing.<br>They're media personalities at the end of the day, which aren't known for being exactly genuine.</br></br>  Do the gears emit the instrumental music and backing vocals?<br><br>Why do the military people waste millions in ammunition against noise?<br><br>What the fuck was the frontier?<br><br>Why did they have a training montage instead of looking for Miku?<br><br>Why is Chris so cute?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do the military people waste millions in ammunition against noise? <br><br>This is one of the points that made me drop Ep.1 of S1 initially, that fucking clichee of helpless dumbfonded incompetent military guys that get just murdered by monsters while just standing there shooting them panicked. Also why do they have like 20th century military equipment and tanks in such a futuristic setting?</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't been around yesterday because I want to avoid the spoilers and I'm trying to not read this thread.<br>Where is the stream going to happen? I think ohys died.</br></br>  <br>Bullets do work against Noise, but only during the exact moment they phase out of their subspace to attack.<br>And isn't Symphogear supposed to be in a contemporary setting with just a few fancy designs for buildings and vehicles?</br></br>  To be honest, I don't give a fuck about the songs.  <br>neetball.<br>Don't worry, there aren't any spoilers yet, really.</br></br>  <br> spoilers <br>Chris-chan is cute.</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>http://mfi.re/watch/mci2ubi2pu9cshf<wbr>/1425258736956.webm</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Does this look like a contemporary setting?</br></br>  <br><br>Or this?</br></br>  <br>How? Symphogear without songs would be only half as fun.</br>  <br> Do the gears emit the instrumental music and backing vocals? <br>yes<br><br>just like a karaoke machine, says hibiki in one of the Zesshoushinai shorts</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well the rest of the city does. It's just some fancy building designs slapped in here and there.</br></br>  <br>I actually like how to songs actual reflect the personalities of the characters and show development without having them go into monologues.</br>  <br> a futuristic setting? </br>  <br> Tobe! = Take this! </br>  <br>Thomas designed them because it's Agematsu's request.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool then.</br>  I just noticed that Hibiki's zerker face looks kinda silly here.<br><br><br>Well of course do large parts of the citiy look like today, the city I'm living in also has lots of buildings that are 50-100 years old, for example the one I'm living in, and it looks not much different from a modern building.<br>Look at their technology, the floating translucent screens, the buildings. It's not playing in a distant future, but easily 50-100 years from our present.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>that's a mix of really cool and really lame<br><br>neat lore though</br></br></br></br>  <br>MGS4 took place last year.<br>NGE is happening as we speak.</br></br>  <br>The Maria/Tsubasa concert was the shaking image, so that's a clue that something big will happen (besides the concert I mean).</br>  Hikasa said Evan Call lived in Gungnir that's why we got Kort el fes Gungnir intro.  <br>Yes, this. Even the OPs and EDs are thoroughly integrated into the show. I also like the variety of styles that they come up with (Chris gets the brasher ones, Nana gets more elegant and skillful ones, Hibiki gets the loud ones) to go with different action scenes.</br>  <br>you know these weird things that their suits have on their lower backs? those are the speakers, actually</br>  <br>But those are jet boosters.</br>  <br>DESS!</br>  <br> not striped <br>Satelight you had one job.</br></br>  <br>I thought she had shimapan.</br>  <br/>  <br><br> random edgy arrows and non-secured helmet that should fall off  <br>I hate it</br></br></br>  <br>Also it would be badass if she used that scythe like an actual polearm weapon, not whatever she was doing in G.</br>  <br> aoi yuuki in charge of not crying.webm <br>And she is crying again near the end of the live when nobody is looking.<br>I want to cuddle her.</br></br></br>  32 hours.  <br>Kirika and Shirabe's gear designs are fucking stupid</br>  <br> scythe <br> actual polearm weapon <br>How would you even do that?</br></br></br>  <br>Ver best girl, post more Ver</br>  <br> genuine <br>8man please.<br>Japanese people prioritize being polite over being sincere.<br>And Aoi was screaming her heart out during that performance, which such a raw display of emotion I don't what else more "genuine" do you want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mod it into a war scythe, which is repositioning the blade to make it closer to a halberd/naginata.</br>  <br>It really is much better without the stupid skirt thing.<br>Not even just lewder, but objectively better.</br></br>  <br>She did that and but then turned it into a scissor.</br>  <br><br>that's just a shitty spear that peasants jury-rigged as polearms then</br></br>  <br>They're much more wield-able than a regular scythe configuration. That's why peasants modded them in the first place.</br>  <br><br><br>I thought that was the point, that they had edgy retarded costumes because they were initially evil</br></br></br>  <br>Do we know what date Third Impact is supposed to happen on?</br>  <br>Early January 2016. Probably new year's day.</br>  <br>They weren't really evil. Only Ver was evil.

Knew nothing but the fact they sang while fighting and that Tsubasa jam pic that I'd been seeing around for years. Definitely thought going in unspoiled made for a good deal of my enjoyment of the series. While I watched, I commented on Skype with a friend that said he wasn't interested in the series at all and spoiled pretty much every major event. Even showed a bunch of webms. He finished G today and apparently had a lot of fun despite knowing every single one of those random twists. Genuinely surprised.</br></br>  <br> Zettou Ame no Habakiri <br><br>Top level taste</br></br></br>  <br> Blogshit incoming. <br>Because saying that first makes it okay.<br>Nobody cares about your faggot friend.</br></br></br>  <br>Use spoilers tags if you must drop blogshit you wouldn't want to get a short ban right before the live stream.</br>  <br>Different people enjoy things differently.

You need to enable it to make game capture work and disable it to make window capture work or the other way around or something like that.<br><br>I wonder if that or anything similar might be causing any problems, seeing as you got the stream to work before and it's a known unfixable issue with OBS.</br></br></br>  <br>Archive</br>  <br>Enabling Aero makes windows gpu accelerate desktop and OBS can't game stream if it doesn't come from the gpu.</br>  Hitbox.tv?  <br>The site name has been said multiple times in the last few posts</br>  <br>I doubt the streaming site matters much unless connectcast is also having problems.

Mainly because that's how it's been done until now and the anime industry is not one known for taking risks with formulas.</br>  Hibiki is my waifu and I want her to go crazy berserk all over my dick in season 3.  <br>This.<br><br>Yurikuma sold like shit for the same reason.</br></br></br>  I want to zenbu Zenbu's zenbus.  <br>But I like Kirika's design<br><br>Those spiky pauldrons are really cool</br></br></br>  <br>What if Hibiki goes full Mitsuko on GX?</br>    <br>I wish I could understand what the hell is wrong with japan's otaku</br>  <br>They're really conservative</br>  <br>There isn't, just faggots corrupting friendship.</br>  <br>Or because it was convoluted for style reasons as opposed to substance.</br>  <br>In GX doujin Hibiki will fist all girls.</br>  <br>In this case, not being disgusting degenerates.</br>  I don't know if I should be happy or upset about my waifu being with Miku.  It's kind of hot. <br><br><br>Symphogear has always been way under the radar until recently, and how it had the sales for 3 seasons is beyond me.<br><br>If they want to focus on sales, they will probably stay as /u/ as they are now, but if it continues how the show has been going, I expect 2+ full uncensored sex scenes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually thought the same thing. But you shouldn't give a shit about voice actor except for their voice.</br>  <br>Favorite girl:Hibiki, no contest. I really adore her type of character when it's shown that her need to help people is actually unhealthy and wrong but she does it anyway. <br><br>Song:I really fucking love Waikyou Shenshoujin</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what is there to understand.<br>Leaving things to imagination elicits a stronger response from us that going "yeah, they are gay/a couple".<br>Which applies to everything. You also get more aroused from seeing someone barely dressed in comparison to seeing the same person naked.</br></br></br>  <br> Aoi Yuuki's sex voice on Hibiki. <br><br>Oh boy oh boy.</br></br></br>  <br> anime yurifags are this Stockholm </br>  <br>This is so fucking gay</br>  <br>This is also true. Though it had its charm. Also, Ruru's childhood episode was excellent.</br>  <br>The money King Records earned from Symphogear series can make at least 3 seasons 39 episodes.</br>  <br> how it had the sales for 3 seasons is beyond me <br>One word, CDs.</br></br>  <br>Would've been better if they let the character designer write the show.</br>  <br> You see why /u/sers end up moving towards western content a little bit? There's only so much subtext you can take before you say fuck it and look for actually confirmed stuff </br>  <br><br>Shows like Yurikuma aren't hip anymore. If Utena released today only 5 of us would probably talk about it in the threads like what happened with yurikuma.<br><br>It was the best show of the season for me though. But this is speaking as an ikuharafag</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't confuse me with a yurishitter, please.<br>I am just explaining to Anon the train of thought behind not showing explicit lesbian (or even hetero romantic) relationships on Anime most of the time.</br></br>  <br>I only keep watching because of Aoi and the godly OST/sound direction.</br>  Reminder that Aoi poops.  <br>Idols don't poop Anon, everybody knows that.<br> 3333 <br>fug</br></br></br>    <br>It's called manga.</br>  <br>But what are amerib/u/rgers supposed to do?</br>  <br> how it had the sales for 3 seasons is beyond me <br>Do you know why Precure got 12 seasons?</br></br>  <br>I always assumed the undying cash of diehard MHfags with no shame stopping them from buying merch.</br>   I think that Gokuren Igalima is best song<br>That melody is just too good</br>   Is there a better magical girl than Hibiki?  <br>Your taste is  fine . I prefer the duet version though.</br>  <br>It's sort of jazzy. I enjoy it.<br><br>Madoka.</br></br></br>  <br> muhdoka <br> useless untill the last episode and got raped by lesbian in the movie </br></br>  <br>Illia</br>  I have been wanting to see every Nana concert there is, but almost every torrent I have find is dead.<br>Is there even a way to find torrents with seeds?</br>  <br>Olivie</br>  <br>Hibiki is top tier, but I have been in love with pic related since years.</br>  <br>Most musically interesting song by far. That dueling piano and metal guitar.</br>  <br>Reminds me of some of Daisuke Ishiwatari's tracks</br>  <br>There is no other choice, almost everyone buys her BDs instead of pirating it because its really worth the price.<br>Maybe you can beg the Nanafags or something, there's Nanafans all over the world.</br></br>  <br>If we're talking about love that has withstood the test of time there's only one mahou shoujo for me.</br>  So I just rewatched season 1, and is it safe to say that Symphogear is one of the best television shows ever made?  <br>Not by a long shot, no, don't let your hype cloud your judgement.</br>  <br>There is a lot of care and love put into despite the schedule/budget issues, most of the people working on it seemed to love it too.<br>S1 rewatchs never get old for me.</br></br>  <br>But in Yurikuma they were blatantly gay from the start. What I want to see is yuri pandering all up until the very end when they become actually gay.</br>  <br>It seems that I have no option, but to buy then.<br>Maybe I will start with Live Games, since it seems the most visually interesting.<br>Anyway, thanks anon.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair not a lot of manga series are out there and a lot of the time it's just oneshots or series that are canceled very quickly.<br><br>Murcielgo is like the only one that hasn't gotten fucked over yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Things like these are always going to be subjective though.</br>  <br>It's the best sentai show on television</br>   Symphogear is sitting on my backlog for years <br> finally marathon it last week <br> mfw the final attack is the OP <br><br>I regret not watching sooner.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, I'm not pondering its meaning for weeks after I finish, but it is more enjoyable than most of what I've seen. It's just so much fun.</br>  <br>Sakura was my very first crush when I was like 9, she still has a special place in my heart.</br>  <br>Murcielago is a yuri series only inasmuch as its MC is a lesbian who frequently has sex with other women. It's an action series first and foremost which gives it some momentum.<br><br>A yuri focused series(or any romance series, for that note) should never last extremely long because then there's more incentive to send them to hunt for the dragon balls on Namek than make meaningful developments.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's different to say "Best show ever made" than "My favorite anime ever". Just saying.  I love it so fucking much. </br></br>  I've been meaning to watch Symphogear, but I don't know what the best subs are. Who should I go with?  <br> my Nana getting angry joke got screencapped <br>Nana wills it.</br></br>  <br>That's what I mainly mean to be honest. There aren't that many action or plot based series with yuri or lesbians. So some of them go to western stuff to satisfy that since more Japanese series are either exclusively romance or exclusively subtext with some rare exceptions(Gunsmith Cats).<br><br>Some people just want both plot and lesbians and there's nothing wrong with that.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I just blame the Yuri Hime S merger fucking up what made it over.</br>  <br>Commie<br><br>It's not like there's much choice</br></br></br>  <br>But that's wrong, the "best show ever made" will always be my personal best show ever made. Saying that my favorite shows are different from "the" best shows are implying there is some sort of omniscient entity separate from all of mankind which makes final decisions on which anime are the "best" and which aren't.</br>  <br>Yeah, the yuri hime merger did fuck things over. There are LNs but those are never translated because translators want to translate "My sister is a monster girl and so are all of her friend and I'm just a regular high school boy" instead because that's getting an adaptation and they want internet cred.</br>  <br> ikuharafag <br><br>How do you live with yourself?</br></br></br>  <br>But that's wrong because the best show ever made is MY favorite show.</br>  <br>It ain't fine literature, friend.</br>  <br> Saying that my favorite shows are different from "the" best shows are implying there is some sort of omniscient entity separate from all of mankind which makes final decisions on which anime are the "best" and which aren't. <br>It's just implying that there are objective criteria of "quality" which might not match your tastes precisely. That is wrong, but it's what it actually implies. No need to supposed the existence of some omniscient neckbeard watching anime in his godly mom's basement in heaven.</br></br>  <br>Saying "my favorite" better indicates that you recognize tastes differ, so it sounds less presumptuous.</br>  <br> my stik figur animayshuns are bettur than enny gibbly movie. <br> u can't proov me rong becuz it's all subjektiv. <br>I hate that stupid shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Fine possesses Hibiki because reasons <br> Aoi switches to her Sexbear voice whenever Fine takes control <br> Hibiki rapes Miku </br></br></br>  <br>Watching Utena.</br>  <br>Niggas don't understand art.</br>  <br> objective criteria of art <br> objectively looking at art and somehow still receiving its intended emotional message <br>You lost me</br></br></br>  Hibiki is somehow more manly than a vast majority of male characters in any series.  <br>Not that guy but &gt;intended message implies that there's one correct message that the artist wanted you to see, which kind of means subjective interpretations are invalid.</br>  <br> objectively looking at art and somehow still receiving its intended emotional message <br>That's not what I said at all. Anyway, I said that the idea that there is some objective criteria to judge which anime is the best is wrong to begin with.</br></br>  <br>There really isnt enough porn of this show.<br>Especially main girl</br></br>  <br> Literally Genderswapped Shirou being more manly than most male protagonists <br><br>Dude.</br></br></br>  <br>Going by that interpretation intended emotional message is an oxymoron.</br>  Today really has been a long day.  <br>You're welcome.<br> Live Games <br>Nice choice. <br>I recommend watching Live Flight, Live Grace and Live Grace Opus II.

I might be the only one thinking this. From the beginning, we view everyone's issues from 8man's perspective as though he's the only one with a solution and the only bystander to all the drama.<br><br>But we often see other characters feeling sorry for him and wanting to help him. Yukino in particular might feel she can only save 8man by being his first girlfriend. I'd be interested to see if this is her plan to save him. He's already proven himself so she might be playing an elaborate game to raise his self-esteem - like how Haruno forced Hayama into making them show up on the double date with Orimoto. It's all about bigging up Hikki's self-esteem.<br><br>What's his prize for helping others and being forced into this club by sensei? A girlfriend? Friends? In what sense are they going to continue to be non-genuine with him?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the show ended <br> there are two threads up <br><br>this is how this board will go under<br><br>these threads attract the worst kind of posters</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has 8man ever asked any other girls on a date before?  <br> implying any part of 4chan ever attracted anything better than the worst kinds of people </br>  <br><br>What exactly about vol 11 Yukino leads you to believe she's capable of manipulating anyone or planning anything?</br></br>  <br>No, but he only asked her out because of his promise.</br>  <br>The prize is whatever Hikki or Yukino make it to be.<br><br>Yukino implies she wants to be the one to save Hachiman, while Hachiman wants to be the one to step over the line and help Yukino.</br></br></br>  And I thought I could finally sing "Thanatos ~ If I can't be yours" this time.  <br>Yukino is a child, no way is this some elaborate plan to help him.</br>  <br>Why do these threads still exist?<br>The series ended, is there really any thing more to say or add to the show?</br></br>  <br>And why did he promise her a date in the first place?</br>  <br> Taking in the Valentine mood <br> only asked her out because of his promise. <br><br>You keep believing that, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the show  <br>It's all about the LNs now</br></br>  <br>New volume of the novel just got out and translations are coming out.<br><br><br>Because she complained about the toast bread thing.<br><br><br>Spoilers as to why he asked her out has been posted already, go lurk some more.<br>Being Yui is suffering, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You never know, the first request of the club was to change Hikigaya, Haruno says that Yukino knows how to manipulate people and use people just like their mom.<br><br>It would be one huge fucking plot twist if it were all part of Yukino's plan though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think it's particularly elaborate to pity someone. She's a bit of a narcissist as we saw in earlier volumes. She'd probably think the best way to save this lonely guy is to allow him to date the intelligent school beauty.<br><br>This could be the next big plot point. Hikki turned down Yui because he thought she was pitying him. What if Yukino also feels pity for him rather than romance? What if the triangle is destroyed by a simple misunderstanding?<br><br>What if, like Chitanda, she remains out of reach of Hikki? A rich intelligent girl that he's forced into a club with. He thinks he might like her in some way and goes out of his way to prove himself. Maybe that's what's not genuine. Their final bet itself is based on a lie.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just to humor you. If it turned out that everything was some giant 9/11-tier scheme by Yukino, how do you think Hachiman would react when he discovers it? That everything he believed was a lie?<br><br>Something tells me</br></br></br></br>  <br>It could be a giant scheme. Or it could be a misunderstanding that's been going since the beginning. Yukino simply pities him rather than loves him. That's how it's always been and could be an explanation.</br>  <br><br>Sorry sent my post too quick<br><br>Something tells me Hachiman would be 1000x worse than he was before that once he found that out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I've seen the spoilers so I'll repeat<br><br>"You keep believing that, anon"</br></br></br>  <br> Because she complained about the toast bread thing. <br><br>I thought the one complaining was 8man?</br></br></br>  <br>That left Yukinoshita and I together. Yukinoshita called out my name as if she found it a bit difficult to say.<br><br>“Hikigaya-kun… who did you really want to solve this problem for?”<br><br>“I did it for Rumi Rumi, I guess,” I answered, shrugging.<br><br>“…I see. That’s good to hear.”<br><br>On the path just beside us, the students were walking along.<br><br>Rumi fell squarely into my line of sight.<br><br>She recognised me, and yet she oh, so casually averted her eyes. When she passed me by the side, she absolutely refused to look in my direction.<br><br>“No reward for you, I see,” Yukinoshita said jokingly.<br><br>“It’s not like I did anything nice for her. Let’s be realistic here. All I did was scare some kids and ruin their friendships. Plus, I used others to do my bidding… it was the worst possible method, so there’s nothing to be grateful over.”<br><br>“I suppose so.” Yukinoshita paused. “But it is quite a relief to be rid of your harassers. Besides, that girl moved forward out of the strength of her own will, didn’t she? You might have used illegal moves and planned it poorly, but you’re the one who set the table for her, Hikigaya-kun.”<br><br>Yukinoshita laid out the unvarnished truth for me, no holds barred, as straight and true as she ever was.<br><br>“And so I think that, even if no one will ever praise you, you’d be forgiven if one good thing came of it.” Commie translated this as: Even if nobody praises you for what you did, it wouldn't be a problem if at least one good thing happened to you.<br><br> Yukino implies she wants to be the one to save Hachiman <br><br>Also this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would break 8man, also it would just show him that Yukino is far more evil than Haruno could ever hope to be.<br><br>I know it won't happen though.</br></br></br>  <br>He's bullshitting.<br><br>8man thinks he was "irresponsible" in making the promise, but at no point when he's reminded of it does he seem to view that irresponsibility in a particularly negative light.</br></br></br>  <br>Evil or human? She pitied him, she was forced into a club with him. Rather than an evil scheme, it could just be a desperate repressed rich girl trying to live through someone else's happiness.</br>  <br>On a side note, though Haruno is a cunt, she's not wrong. Yukino has some legit issues that no one was willing to deal with.</br>  <br>He wanted to pay for the honey toast, small arguement ensues and she tells him to treat her another honey toast. He stupidly agrees and that's it.<br>Since he's not a complete cunt, he has to keep his word now.</br></br>  <br>I once wrote a ridiculously long theory on another site  which shall not be named , with the core premise being that Yukino started the Service Club, because she thought Hachiman became a loner because he missed the first couple of weeks because of the car accident and she felt responsible to fix it, which is why she asked Sensei to force Hachiman into the Service Club.</br>  <br>Yuifags, everyone. As dense as their waifu that didn't even know penguins were birds.<br>Does 8man love Yui too? What else?</br></br>  <br>Then, why did he make a date promise in the first place?</br>  <br>He was opening himself up to the "mood" of the cultural festival.</br>  <br>Because he's an idiot that thought that he owed her money for the honey toast.</br>  <br>Yui told him if he wanted to repay her then instead of giving her money to treat her to some honey toast, Hachiman then asked her if she's rather want something else.</br>  is this the good thread or the Iroha one?  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Then why did he change the place?<br><br>Why not just answered "sure" or "okay"?</br></br></br>  <br>after one year?</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  Who else didn't see the love triangle coming here?  <br> which is why she asked Sensei to force Hachiman into the Service Club. <br>But then proceeded to act like she didn't know him?<br><br>Hiratsuka forced him to join because she thought they would get along.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because honey toast is shit.</br>  <br>This is why, read the LN for once<br><br> It was really easy to rely on Yuigahama. <br> However. <br> That’s exactly why I needed to keep myself in check. <br> To blindly place unrestrained faith in someone is dependence. <br> I mustn’t rely on Yuigahama’s kindness. I mustn’t let Yuigahama’s good will spoil me. <br> Her kindness was something that created painful memories, made you worry and agonize over them, and wring them out. And I knew all of that. That’s why I mustn’t place my trust in her so easily. <br> On the slim chance that all of that weren’t due to her kindness or good will, but due to much more different emotions, then I had to be even more careful. Because that was simply taking advantage of a person’s weakness. <br> Feelings should be managed appropriately. <br> Distances should be maintained suitably. <br> ——So is it okay for me to take at least one step forward again? <br> The Cultural Festival is a festival. A festival is extraordinary. <br> It’s that extraordinariness that causes your judgment to be off more than normal. But well, I’m sure even I would make the wrong judgment, at least for today. <br> “…Can we do another place?” <br><br>It's literally just him not trying to be a cunt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga it was an Harem since the beginning, even I who started with the manga knew</br>  <br>What else would she say?<br><br> Hello, I know you but you don't know me. I crashed my car into you and started this club so you have to spend time with me until I can fix you </br></br></br>      <br>Are you really taking him at his word back when he was still in full denial mode about "nice girls"?</br>  <br>5 seasons later and people are still denying it</br>  <br><br>You just want it to be special, to have a deeper meaning.<br>Yui got nothing but shit on on almost every volume, just deal with it<br>At least behave like most Irohafags and accept defeat already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Orimoto</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127502232 <br><br>That's annoying Anon.<br><br><br>He was in full denial mode but at least he took a step forward to ask her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>DAYONE</br></br>  <br>I interpreted that as:<br>Since the firework's festival Hachiman's been somewhat aware of Yui's feelings for him, but tried to deny them. Yui made Hachiman promise to go out on a date with her. Since then he's been avoiding that for a long time. Then genuine happened. Genuine was mostly directed at Yukino, but Yui was also present. Since he made such a huge fuss about wanting something genuine, once Yui brings up the whole "I want to go on a date" thing during S2E9, Hachiman really has no other option than to agree with it. At the beginning of episode 12, Hayato gang is talking about Valentine's Day. They talk about hand made gifts. Hachiman walks out of the classroom and remembers the cookies from the very first episode, he once again tries to shake it off. Yui comes in and starts to talk to him. Hachiman wants to confirm his suspicion / see her reaction and asks Yui if she wants to go on a date with him. They enter the Service Club. Yui says that Hachiman will get chocolate for sure this year. He tries to avoid it by saying he'll get some from Komachi. Then the whole Hayato thing is brought up. Hachiman decides to kill two birds with one stone, by making the event, he too can taste the chocolates without having to listen to a confession.</br></br>  <br>My primary question is: "Why did he promise her a date?" <br><br>And that wall of text didn't really explain anything other than "8man took a bet that if in some % that Yui has a feeling for him, he's willing to embrace it". Otherwise, I don't understand why did he say:<br><br> On the slim chance that all of that weren’t due to her kindness or good will, but due to much more different emotions, then I had to be even more careful. Because that was simply taking advantage of a person’s weakness. <br> Feelings should be managed appropriately. <br> Distances should be maintained suitably. <br> ——So is it okay for me to take at least one step forward again? <br> The Cultural Festival is a festival. A festival is extraordinary. <br> It’s that extraordinariness that causes your judgment to be off more than normal. But well, I’m sure even I would make the wrong judgment, at least for today. <br><br>Which doesn't make any sense why did he take a mile just for repay her honey toast. And his conversation with Komachi implied that he really intended to go on a date. Not just to bring her on an afternoon meal or something equal to a honey toast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>Did you even read what you posted?<br>You just proved his point.<br><br> ——So is it okay for me to take at least one step forward again? </br></br></br></br>  ITT: neutron stars  <br>Willingness to accept Yui's loss is one thing, but that doesn't mean she hasn't made inroads to 8man's heart.<br><br>While moments like that might not be as "big" as some of the moments he's had with Yukino or Iroha, they still mark subtle but significant changes in 8man. A willingness to take a step forward when he made the promise, nervousness about how to even ask a girl out when they shopped for Yukino's gifts, and <br> It’d be insincere if all you did was wait. Regardless of the answer and conclusion awaiting you at the end of the tunnel, you should make sure to take that step forward without deception and incredulity and leave the regrets for afterwards. <br>sounds nothing like someone simply seeking to fulfill a promise. He's putting serious thought into making yet another step forward with her there.</br></br></br></br></br>  Isn't everything that can be discussed already discussed?   Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball, wondering if senpai would like her scent and the color <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br> Wakes up at 4 to prepare herself for the date <br> She stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue <br> She is late to the date because she didn't get the train and preferred to save the money for the stylish cafe <br><br> still forgot to save the 2nd part. Damn which thread was it? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, found the source.</br>  <br>Just because I'm bored . </br>    <br> Thanks <br><br><br>Part 2<br> Bought new clothes for the date, but didn´t take the labels off, so she can return it.after. <br> Her knee socks had hole, took out her sewing kit to fix it <br> Put a buy-one-get-one-free-meal coupon for a new cafe in her wallet. <br> Went to the library to return romance manga(s) she borrowed, saves money. <br> Came to the meeting spot early, take a extra look at her notepad, "things I want to know about senpai today". </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>might want to reconsider that last line, since it contradicts the last line of the first half and the actual events of the day</br>  <br>Eh, I'm just pasta-ing. I can't into creativity.</br>  <br>I don't want see Yui get destroyed like Setsuna. Yui did nothing wrong.</br>  So I have this theories about Iroha an Yukino. <br><br>Iroha likes Hayama but she seems more interested in what 8man's preference in chocolate is than Hayama's. It is odd to base your chocolate around who you're giving obligation chocolate to instead of the one you really want it for. She also seemed to stop what she was doing when Orimoto started talking to 8man, which is a move that other girls who like 8man did.<br><br>I have a suspicion that Iroha likes 8man and it using her "crush" on Hayama as a way to get close to 8man without triggering him and to bypass Yui's/Yukinon's anti-hussy sensors. She even forced an indirect kiss on him.<br><br>I suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.<br><br>Does anyone have any theories on Yui?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever her request is, it's going to set her victory in stone.<br>She'll fix her dependency problems and will take the 8man for herself because at this point even Yukinofags doubt it.<br> wrong as expected. </br></br></br>  <br>I've known Yui was in love with the cookieman since the first volume, but after seeing how pained she looked insisting the cookies at the aquarium were just a "thank you"?<br><br>I think maybe 8man was the cookieman all along.</br></br></br>  <br>To kill the cunt</br>  <br>What? 8man is cookie man?</br>  <br>well it WAS april when she lied</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure, yes. I'm going to go back to read volume one sometime soon to gather more evidence.</br>   make a big deal about how she's letting everyone do everything for her while she never changes <br> immediately we see her asking people a favor <br>Now that's comedy.</br></br>  <br>Please do</br>    <br>Please no bully.</br>  <br>She is just a bit autistic, Anon. Please, be easy on her.</br>  <br> I have a suspicion that Iroha likes 8man <br>Don't listen to delusional pro Irohax8man Irohafags.</br></br>  <br>She's an autistic rich girl, She'll pay well.</br>  If Yukino wins we riot.  <br>She wants Hachiman's semen so she can raise a kid with Yui.</br>  This is burgerland posting time alright. Time to leave.  <br>i think cookieman might be yukino</br>  <br>Touma still the best.</br>  <br>How destroyed would Yukino be if Yui was a different kind of character and decided to cut relations with her just to be with 8man?</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>Yeah, don't want to let opinions different from your own bruise your sensitive EUfag ego.<br><br>I mean you've got it hard enough right now with Greece officially going to hell in a handbasket.</br></br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br> We only see things from 8man's perspective <br> The girls don't really love him; he's just convinced they are because someone is finally paying attention <br> Yukino actually never blushed <br> Yui actually isn't that genki <br>Imagine the rage and tears of the fanbase.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek<br>Wrong pic mate</br></br>  I hope Hayama fixes her.  <br>Not close enough.<br><br>Really, who cares about the 8bowl when Eiguchi already won the WataWatabowl?</br></br></br>  <br>Now that Yukino has already learned about Yui's feeling,<br>does people seriously believe that Yukino of all people would disregard Yui's feeling and confess to 8man?</br></br>  <br>I want to cum inside her cunt</br>  <br>the only option left for 8man is to go gay<br><br>i heard hayato's hiring</br></br></br>  <br>Watari said the series is heading towards an "Oregairu" like ending. <br>Hopefully people can stop with all this White Trainwreck 2 crap now.</br></br>   under the snow   <br> The girls don't really love him; he's just convinced they are because someone is finally paying attention <br><br>10/10 would buy all volume available.</br></br></br>    Reminder to all Yukinofags that there are far more superior version of her  <br>She want's 8man to help end her life at Aokigahara Jukai</br>  <br>Now that's beta.</br>            <br>What with this trash<br><br>Copy of Copypaste-non , Copyception.</br></br></br>  <br>メリークリスマスのだけれど</br>  <br>I wonder, did the girls like their christmas presents?</br>  <br> can only post sample because archaic 4mb size restrictions </br>  <br> murderer <br> superior <br>Then again it's either that or a spineless wanna-be ice queen.<br><br>Yeah, I guess I take the murderer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And a superior Hachiman.</br></br>  <br>Fat</br>  <br>What?

As a franchise and anime, obviously Fate is bigger, but from anything I've seen, SAO is much more popular as a LN. Granted I've never seen any of the sales numbers for any of TM's LNs.

Getting rid of Liam was the worst move. Rin's voice sounds like a 50 year old. Only redeeming character is Kirei and he sounds very good.  <br>Lancer's 1 line was great too.</br>  Zero was better.<br><br>Crispin and Mercer sexy voicing against each other beats the faggot who voices every teenage male MC nowadays. And they got the same voice for Loli Rin as Teen Rin.</br></br>  Saber sounds like she's 40  <br>From what I've heard that may not really be the case? It sounded like Apocrypha was more well received than Zero was from what feedback I've seen.</br>  <br>Not his dank meme again.</br>  This is laughably bad, hilariously so.

Only Narita actually shown any talent.<br><br>Thanks got it did not have Kamachi and Kawahara. Having Kirito and Touma in this would have made it even more unbearable.<br><br>Should have done Nishio, Narita, Sigsawa and Gotoh.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Main girl voiced by Sawashiro Miyuki <br>I'm in.</br>  <br> Starting soon? <br><br>But the episodes have already been out and it sucked ass</br></br></br>  <br>Narita was actually really predictable too, crazy stuff is his style, and Kaguraba wasn't even that pivotal to the plot outside of him infodumping and telling them his past just because.<br><br>Also, what people wanted was exactly that. Seeing how those authors and the quirks would play in a tabletop rpg campaign.</br></br></br>  <br>People usually want to see them translated and decent quality and without cuts.</br>  <br> Kamachi <br><br>Reading his other works, I find that his non-Index protags remind me more of Hamazura than Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching this soley for her.</br>  <br> solely <br>You sure?</br></br>  <br>But she dies in like the first episode so the shota can power up.</br>  Urochan didn't appear in the first ep so I'll skip it  <br>But she does.</br>  <br>I think you meant Record of Lodoss War. Which by the way was about a boy and an (elf)girl fighting evil in a fantasy world. This was very original, I never saw something like it before Lodoss.<br>The fun part is, I can actually say that without the slightest bit of irony<br>Slayers seems way too random for that to be the case</br></br></br>  Is it being subbed by Crunchyroll or Funi?  <br>Lou appears in the first episode anon. Actually, all the caracteres appear.</br>  <br>*characters</br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/dai<wbr>ly-briefs/2015-07-01/funimation-bri<wbr>efly-listed-chaos-dragon-on-site/.8<wbr>9942<br><br>Enjoy your eye cancer.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  I'll give it the five episode rule, I think. Won't drop it until I see how all the characters bounce off each other.<br><br><br>I think DDY picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>You should do it because she does. They introduce her character in episode 1 and she is seen talking with her sword about what is happening.</br>  Wait, white hair is a boy?  Picked up.   <br>Yes they did.</br>  Can someone post the old and new design comparison  <br>We should make one not just with the main characters but with the NPCs too.</br>  <br>Looking at everything Funi is subbing this season...<br>Yep, I'm definitely going to be watching fan subs for most things I'm watching.<br><br>The heck is CR simulcasting this season?</br></br></br></br>   Chaos Dragon novelization by Sanda (following the anime's version of events) coming out 7/16. <br><br>so that means chaos dragon not gonna follow the WN</br></br>  <br>We already knew that since the announced the anime details.<br><br>It's going to be the same story with changes here and there, and that was basically what the first three episodes were. I would say they changed like 50% of the whole thing.</br></br></br>  So,anywhere I can watch it besides the chink stream ?  Someone mind spoon-feeding me what I'm getting myself into?<br>This is an adaptation of a WN? That doesn't sound too promising.</br>   Nasu+Urobutcher   <br> dies <br>What a waste of a cute loli with good designs.</br></br>  <br>Literally a google away.</br>  <br>I won't go that far to call it a WN, its a TRPG campaign record.</br>  <br>No, it's a re-imagination of a transcription from a tabletop rpg campaign with Narita, Nasu, Urobuchi, Shimadoriru and Izuki Kougyoku.</br>  <br>I think she did not die in the original but she was definitely irrelevant.</br>  <br>It seems neetball does not stream it, so I don't know.</br>  <br><br>Alright then, in case anyone of you didn't know, here is the stream site we watched the pre-air.<br>http://www.douyutv.com/meizhi#</br></br></br>  <br> way too random <br>I dunno, that seems to be par for course for many D&amp;D stories I read about.</br></br>  <br>Neetball will stream it, it's not even start yet.</br>  Is connectcast offline or is it just me? Neetballs other streams are working just not there.  <br>Thanks for the info.</br>  I'm expecting tons of 'dropped' because this whole concept is unlikely to attract a lot of people  <br>To be honest I only care because of the whole bunch of hack writers are in it</br>  <br>What concept DO attract lots of people then ?<br><br><br> Don't we all </br></br></br></br>  <br>I just need something to scratch my adventure fantasy itch.</br>  <br>I don't see anything bad with the concept, is standard fantasy adventure with some twists here and there.</br>  I keep hearing that the fox loli shows her navel. Is this true?  <br>That's also why I'm watching it.<br>I think that's the whole point.<br><br><br>Something that isn't a re-imagination of an RPG. <br><br><br>I didn't say it was bad, it's just weird.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What concept DO attract lots of people then ? <br>Cute girls + high school + cute hijinks = ¥¥¥</br></br>  <br>No doubt there.</br>  Starts in a minute.  Here we go.  Dat Silver Link 3D CG spins.  Advertising time.  the white one is a boy? you gotta be kidding me right?  How old is that shota?<br>Also damn genderbent Butcher looks like best.<br><br>Here's the OP until we get the proper one: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tCX<wbr>E_2sgTUs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>Pretty much.<br><br>Add in some mecha, and/or JESUS main characters too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes he is.</br>  kita    pls we already know that Meryl is best girl  <br>Ibuki is 15 years old according to his character sheet.</br>  <br>There she is.</br>    <br>I won't watch this, but I'll look forward to her doujins.</br>  Who is this loser supposed to be?<br><br><br> Maaya Uchida <br>Best</br></br></br></br>    Oh fuck me that CG dragon is so fucking good. Always gets a giggle out of me.   CG dragon   <br>That's Swallow, Nasu's character. He has a curse that breaks everything he uses but also triples its power. He needs Meryll, his maid, to do everything for him. He is actually pretty fun.<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/Lgo3w</br></br></br>    OST is fucking good.  Hey kid, wanna /ss/    ded already?  Rip loli  Dead loli<br><br><br><br>It's funny as hell. <br><br><br>Is this from Beast's lair?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best boy.</br>  <br> Nasu <br>Dropped.</br></br>    I can't get over how funny that dragon looks.  <br>He actually did pretty good with his character in the original. Better than butcher by far.</br>  <br>Epic.</br>   I was merely pretending to be dead <br><br> Sudoku </br></br>  What the fuck is going on?  why  <br>becaue red dragon is a bitch</br>  These screencaps don't look half bad, how's the animation quality?  kek  I'm crying.<br><br> That scene was top tier comedy. </br></br>  kill waifu, get a new one  Okay when are we getting DDY &amp; Funi subs?<br><br>Also what the fuck is the Red Dragon?<br><br><br>It's the first episode but it's okay, especially since they're doing 3 other shows.</br></br></br></br></br>  The only thing I know about this and the red dragon is that nasu from TM had a LP book with some other famies....  Prepare for the shitposting.  <br><br><br>Red Dragon is insane and an asshole, that's what happens.<br><br>It basically forces Ibuki to sacrifice what is important to him to get his power.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Red dragon is a table top rpg like dungeons and dragons which is the show's base.</br>  picked up  <br>Red Dragon is Nil Kamui's guardian deity and it's tied to Ibuki's family (the imperial dynasty basically).</br>  Looks pretty bad.  looks like shit  <br><br>Gotcha, I'm guessing we're going to be seeing more of that silly CG. <br><br>This show looks fun if you don't take it as serious as it presents itself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Average with some parts being above average.</br>  <br>isn't this basically copying that edgy manga with ''hero retribution''?</br>    <br>It's a fantasy show based on a tabletop, you have to take as what it is. Something fun.</br>  this show is going to launch a thousand shitposts.  <br>It'll get better,  after butcher and mushroom officially introduced. </br>  <br><br>0yy xonro</br></br>  <br>Take a note that Tokyo MX has shit quality</br>  <br><br><br>Picked up this show.</br></br></br>  <br> shitpost <br> not prison school </br></br>  <br>There is also the Black Dragon who will probably be shown later.</br>  <br><br>He is also voiced by Nakata.</br></br>  The small section before the next episode preview indicate how many people will they die by the end.  <br> rejoice </br>    <br>Most of the fun in the original transcript was from the players, so yeah.</br>     evil notChinese invade good notJapan <br> CG dragon makes mc sudoku his waifu <br> notNasu and notGen get like 1 minute of screentime total <br>Well, at least we got our trainwreck of the season right away.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No probably not. This show is too weird.  I was hoping we'd get a slow season with less shitposting.  </br></br>  Wasn't honestly that interesting yet. When do the entire cast get together? Ah fuck. I didn't want to but I guess I'll give it the three episode rule.  <br>I guess that all the original anime characters will die.<br><br>And  Ulrica too. </br></br></br>  <br>I wonder why they decided to make Kouran all evil here. In the original tabletop they weren't specially evil, at least not more than Donatia. They even weren't invading Nil Kamui.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be too optimistic </br>  <br>Probably next episode.</br>  <br>I prefer traditionally animated red dragon Nakata</br>  <br>[x] rape the maid</br>  <br>Doesn't matter,  the antagonist in Kouran would die out in two episode. </br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>You will never get that with Silver Link. They even made a fucking Pegasus CG.</br>  <br>notNasu and notGen will get their focus on 3rd episode</br>  <br>I guess because Kouran kinda did nothing in the TRPG. I don't remember any actually relevant Kouran character beside Lou and the Holy Mother.</br>  <br>Good taste.<br><br><br><br>The second one had more scenes with them too.</br></br></br></br></br>   expected Record of Red Dragon War <br> got Prism Illiya </br>  <br>that's not EihAss</br>  <br>The firelock girl is form Kouran.</br>  <br>I don't think the show has enough fuel for that. <br>However, I do think it might just have enough fuel for waifu shitflinging threads once anons catch wind of Uro-chan.</br></br>  <br> waifu shitflinging threads <br>That's fine though, since it's all in jest. <br>Most of the shitposting will be in Gangsta &amp; Prison School threads I think.</br></br></br>  Oh fuck me I missed the stream again. I'm not desperate enough to watch the eyecancer rips from the pre-screening yet so I'll just have to ask.<br><br>How was it?</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I suppose they will use her (and the Holy Mother) as a Kouran character that is not just evil.</br></br>  <br>If I had a nickle for every time I heard that I could fund my own anime.</br>  <br> Okay when are we getting DDY &amp; Funi subs? <br>DDY: @ Air, Funi: They haven't officially announced it and removed the series page from their site.</br></br>  <br>I didn't expected Gansta thread to have that much shitposter. I hope it's just because it's the first anime of the season to air.</br>  <br>No, its because its shit.</br>  <br>Really different from the original, at least about everything concerned with Ibuki, but fun to watch.</br>  <br>Can you name at least one non-shit anime that aired as the first title of whatever season that ended up being surprisingly good?</br>  <br>And probably God eater, since the original game is pretty dark.<br><br><br>Red dragon do nothing wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Very silly, but I had no idea what was going on.<br><br><br>It's because it's bait for 'mature anime for mature people like myself' kind of people. <br><br><br>That looks like it's in production hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's because it was first show to air</br></br>  <br>Starting now to 2011 shows that aired first in ther seasons (exluding kids shows/shorts):<br>Tsukimonogatari<br>Free!<br>Shinsekai Yori<br>Kingdom<br>Dog Days<br>KoreZom<br>Panty and Stocking</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I feel like I want to scream out and shitpost how EDGY it all was but you know what? It's like I'm not in the mood. Maybe because I know that it's based on a TRPG that it makes me not take it seriously and just chill out while watching it. Shit feels real fucking peculiar, I tell you.  <br>No, its because manga is shit and anime is inevitably shit too. You have to be /v/ crossboarder ignorant of source wishing for MANIME not to understand such simple truth.</br>  <br>And all of that edgy was added for the anime. Original Ibuki just had spirit powers and that was all.</br>  <br>That's not how it works. Shows that are first to air don't get tons of shitposting by default. <br><br><br>Yeah it looks like a show you shouldn't take seriously in the slightest.<br><br> spirit powers <br>So what happened instead of that sacrifice thing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nope GATE because /Pol/</br>  <br> So what happened instead of that sacrifice thing? <br>That's all new. In the original, Ibuki, Eiha and the Revolutionary Army tried to talk with the Red Dragon and were almost totally wiped. <br><br>Then Ibuki and Eiha went to Nil Kamui's Parliament and joined with the rest of the party to begin the quest to subdue the Red Dragon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Just how much happened in the first night anyway? I can only assume that it's all just setting building, character introduction and what not. </br>  <br>Wow they changed a lot.<br>Do you think it's for the better?</br></br>  <br><br>As edgy as it was, it's still much better than Ibuki accidentally made the Red Dragon burns everyone because Ibuki was too scared to speak to the dragon. Shimadoriru (Ibuki's player) got choices but choose not to speak instead, shit was so stupid<br>.</br></br></br>  <br>So that's why I never heard about the sacrifice before. I just assumed that that happened because of PC's mistake or his backstory but I doubt about the latter one.</br>  How was it?<br><br> Was fox-loli everything I was hoping she'd be?</br></br>  <br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu because haters will call it Fujoshit and fans will defend it since its fun.<br>Aquarion Logos - because inevitable shit.<br>Gate - because pol.<br>Ushio no Tora - likely to be THE most trolled show, no contest, since people are not allowed to have fun.<br>Charlotte - 2nd most trolled after UnT.<br>NNB - /u/ cancer will manifest itself there<br>Himouto - MANIME fans will troll this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I heard Ibuki and Eiha's players weren't really that good TTRPGers. Maybe they just wanted to spice up their characters more?</br></br>   [Ohys-Raws] Chaos Dragon - Sekiryuu Sen`eki - 01 (MX 1280x720 x264 AAC).mp4 <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>07170</wbr></br>  <br> burns everyone <br>Does that happen at the beginning?<br><br><br>I don't see Himouto getting trolled that much. Might get retarded /u/ cancer though. Why would UnT be trolled?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mostly that. It ends when they meet up with Kaguraba and the full party is complete. <br><br><br>I don't really know at this point. The original felt more natural, but maybe it wasn't that interesting and suited for an anime. This is a re-interpretation after all, so changes are to be expected.<br><br><br>I think they did it to make Ibuki relevant since the very beginning and gave him a character arc. In the original, Shimadoriru only started to get good halfway the story. Same with Eiha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and by everyone I mean some Revolution army soldiers and Eiha. Eiha revived though.</br>  <br> Oh that makes sense. I guess it's just a matter of making things in the anime a bit more interesting with more action and conflict to start shit off. </br>  <br>Given how Lou, Swallow and Kaguraba seem more or less unchanged (even with Lou genderbending) I thinking that's the case.</br>  <br>The girls aren't even cute.</br>  <br> What the whole session shown was that "most popular writers" have absolutely no imagination and shallow and predictable self repeating garbage. <br><br>Or maybe everyone has their own styles, hmm?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you even serious?</br>    <br>True, I don't think the anime mentioned that Nil Kamui is kinda a special place with magic streams and sometimes people can revive under very specific conditions.</br>  <br> Cute girls + high school + cute hijinks = ¥¥¥ <br>But not many shows with that formula are selling well, m8.</br></br>  <br> They mentioned it in episode 2. </br>  They're really abusing the stills. Granted, I didn't see QUALITY anywhere and that fight at the end looked a little well-animated. Does the animation get better? Pre-screenfags?  <br>The fight against the spider girl in episode 2 was better. The fight against random grunts Swallow also in episode 2 was average.</br>  <br> Swallow <br>Swallow had</br></br>  <br>That's good and all, but there are some titles that air much later than the rest (see KoreZom). At least check the airdates precisely to fit my criteria.</br>  <br>I don't remember as many stills in episode 2 and 3.</br>  <br>I'm calling bullshit.</br>  Lou-chan  <br>Yes. Eiha is 10, Lou is 26 and Swallow is 25.<br><br>And Kaguraba is Unknown.</br></br></br>   all the characters aside from Narita aren't even together yet <br> LOLI IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD <br> GONZO-tier CG <br><br>I bet a lot of people are going to drop this during the first few episodes. Seems like something that starts off really slow.</br></br></br></br>   第1話 「一殺多生」  <br><br>So Ibuki will go full mind of steel?</br></br>  <br> fox loli <br>well im sold</br></br>  <br>Not as lewd as fluffy tail, but close.</br>  <br>and who is this semen demon?</br>  <br>Yeah it's a weird show.</br>  <br> tfw Lou will never love you more than Qisha Tianling <br><br>Maybe I can try to impress her with the "sword" of my own.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the sun, you idiot.</br>  <br>http://monstergirlquest.wikia.com/w<wbr>iki/Tamamo</wbr></br>  <br> does not talk <br> not as big as swordhusbando <br> would not put between legs <br> not edgy </br></br></br></br>  <br>I can already see /a/ loving the fuck out of Lou once she gets more screentime.</br>  <br>Its inevitable, since she is your everyday yandere crazy bitch.

I've learned to not get hyped for anything, that I'll always be pleasantly surprised.</br></br></br>  <br>We already watched the three first episodes last week.</br>  <br> expectations <br><br>I only watch it for Ibuki.</br></br></br>  Well that's.  <br>I don't think anyone was expecting much. <br><br>The first episode was pretty fun though.</br></br></br>  <br>Hah. Hilarious.<br>Must have been expecting way too much from the show.</br></br>  <br>rip</br>  <br>FLOP<br>L<br>O<br>P</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty bad right? I kind of expected worse actually. <br><br>Who's funding this?</br></br></br>  <br>Nico nico ratings for you.</br>  <br>The stuff they added weren't very good. I expected the rating to be bad, but not that bad.</br>  <br> pretty bad <br>That's literally drop dead bad. You can't get any worse than that. Actually, you can but it's still pretty fucking bad.<br><br>But it's niconico so who cares?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not bad, it's fucking average. It's like a fucking 50/50.<br><br>But yeah, it's nico nico, nobody cares.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seikasha and sega(?) or whoever fund the smartphone game.</br>  <br>So, Very Good 22,5%, Good 19,5%, Average 29.3%, Bad 15.4% and Very Bad 13.2%?</br>  <br> Implying we have expectation whatsoever. <br>In Eiha/Lou we trust, others are redundant.</br></br>  <br> Look at these wonderful maids here.....Every single one of them makes me picture being called trash..... <br>Is Nasu confirmed M?</br></br>  <br>In Lou I could understand, but literally everyone else in the party is far better than Eiha.</br>  <br>Wow, that's the worse rating I've seen in years.</br>  <br>They are upset they killed a loli.</br>  <br>Pretty much. I never take niconico seriously anyway, you gotta look at the BDs instead.  It won't sell. </br>  <br>Nico ratings are usually very lenient though and are often high.<br><br>But yeah it's nico nico, so it doesn't matter<br><br><br>I wonder what expectations they had for this. <br><br><br> You know if Meryll looked at me with that face in the bottom-right, I can confidently say that I'll stick to all my deadlines <br>Where's my Tsukihime remake &amp; Melty HD Nasu?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So why exactly did they turn a semi serious epic fantasy into teen genderbend protagonists LN like shit?<br><br>Red Dragon seemed somewhat interesting. This however..</br></br>  <br>Can't wait for masked Lou.</br>  <br>They have event tickets, so it will probably sell enough to make the thing borderline profitable. That and serving as an advertisement to the mobile game, being that probably the most important thing.</br>  <br>Don't ask me... I hyped so much upon reading the original campaign. But this show isn't anywhere close.</br>  <br> Nico ratings are usually very lenient though and are often high. <br>It totally depends on what they are expecting. Some of them probably saw Gen Urobuchi and expected the second coming of Christ or something similar.</br></br>  <br>.jpg.jpg</br>  <br><br>It's a bit soon to say. At this point in the campaign literally nothing happened yet.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty surprising since I remember the pre-screening event have a 66% on very good instead.<br><br><br>Meikaku Shit Actors had a real fucking bad rating for that one episode. You know the one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I wonder what expectations they had for this.  <br>Making people to play the game? It's not like we're going to see any second season anyway.</br></br>  <br>Probably because episode 2 and 3 were far better than episode 1.</br>  <br>It was a LN to begin with based off the game and had teen protaganists as well, what are you talking about. It's also still semi-serious.<br><br>Also the original design for the butcher is fucking horrible.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not surprised everybody this is getting lots of mixed reactions.<br>Seems like the kind of series that's slow on the uptake. I mean, it was a really lackluster first episode.</br></br>  <br>Lou is probably still the same age even after being genderbent.</br>  <br> the original design for the butcher is fucking horrible <br>Don't you love yourself some emo scrub ?</br></br>  <br> But yeah it's nico nico, so it doesn't matter <br><br>They usually don't matter since highest ratings don't mean the highest sales, but low ratings usually mean low sale figures. Especially if it's bad ratings from episode 1.<br><br><br>VVV and A.Z finale were way worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only teens are Ibuki and Eiha, the rest are in their twenties.<br> <br>Even the loli with dog isn't a loli.</br> </br></br>  <br> A.Z finale <br>Glad I drop it before second season.</br></br>  <br>Did you know that there were people in nipland hailing this as an upcoming masterpiece a month back?<br><br>So yeah, they came in with too high expectations and were left fucked.</br></br></br>  <br>They will probably stabilize in episode 2 and 3 to something similar to the pre-screening.</br>  <br>So they were being idiotic. It doesn't surprise me.</br>  <br>Much like the western fanbase, they probably just saw Urobuchi, Narita and Nasu's name and called it a day. I don't think anybody realized that they were just playing the game and not actually writing a story together.</br>  <br>Probably did as part of the "big name" mentality.<br><br>Most people drop expectations (though not too much) as soon as they find out it's Silver Link, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Still, this is fairly under the radar to most of the western fanbase.</br>  <br> that they were just playing the game and not actually writing a story together <br>This. <br><br>It isn't even that good of a story.<br>The appeal of this is seeing the quirks of each writer shine through their characters and see how they play it out with each other during the duration of the story. Anybody expecting anything else is stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's no excuse. Record of Lodoss War was pretty good story-wise.</br></br>  <br>Ninja slayer had worse</br>  <br>No it wasn't, it was as generic fantasy as you could get. This is more or less the same, actually this has a better and more developed setting than Lodoss ever had.</br>  <br>That was as bog standard D&amp;D as you could get. Stop fooling yourself. The characters are what carried the story.</br>  <br>Lodoss was literally default D&amp;D fantasy campaign. It was fun but the story was just generic quest.</br>  <br> The appeal of this is seeing the quirks of each writer shine through their characters <br>This pretty much. It's based off of a transcript of their game.<br><br><br>Probably because the first paragraph of the description seems like it's just generic fantasy with nothing going for it at all</br></br></br></br></br>    loli dies first episode <br>WTF am I watching</br>  <br>What description?</br>  DDY's encoding. Hope to get to that sexy OP soon.  <br>The descriptions you'd see if you googled it, like on AniChart / MAL / etc which I think have been translated from the official description</br>  <br>We know what terms will they use and how they will romanize the names?</br>   I guess we really are getting slow threads.  Fantastic.    <br>I think we should not give a victory cry until the actual episode with subs is out.</br>  <br>Well, the sub isn't out yet.</br>  <br>Slow threads are a different beast with unique poster IDs, Anon</br>  <br><br>Oh thank god DDY is saving us from funi.</br></br>  <br>We don't even know when Funi will release.</br>  <br>Too bad Kanzaka wasn't playing.<br><br>He would troll the shit out of Urobuchi. Running circles around edgelords is his specialty.</br></br></br>  Ninja Slayer did the whole "loved one(s) die and MC makes a contract with a supernatural entity (Red Dragon here; Naraku Ninja in NS) to get revenge/change the world" better and in less time<br>Ibuki should follow Fujikido-san's example</br>  <br> watching meme anime </br>  <br>The loli died because of the contract though.</br>  <br> Thinking"meme anime" is anything other than an empty buzzword used for shitposting </br>  <br>She was pretty much done for when she was slashed. The contract thing was the finishing hit<br>I doubt she could have been saved even if Ibuki didn't take the contract</br></br>  THE CONTRACT, IS IT WORTH THE PRICE   BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD DRAGON <br><br>I like it.</br></br>  <br>Given that in Nill Kamui people can revive under some conditions I don't see why not.</br>  <br>  Random waifu dead <br><br>  New waifu shows up <br><br>GG</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so what is this monster girl quest?</br>  What's with this Urobuchiposting I see in this thread?  <br>One of the sacred books of MGs.</br>   Dead loli childhood friend <br>No ;_;<br> New loli waifu acquired <br>I'm okay with this.</br></br></br>  So DDY subs are being encoded.<br><br>Looks like Funi will release it's trash later.</br></br>  <br> Its not it's. </br>  <br>Next week, you mean? They hasn't even released Gangsta.</br>  <br>They haven't even announced it yet, but they accidentally enabled it on their site for a bit. <br>More than a few days is pretty horrible for official 'simulcasts' and DDY will be faster. <br><br><br>Woops how embarrassing. I fixed my spell-check too, so now I can spell embarrassing right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> CG dragon <br>And Nasu just happens to be involved in this anime too.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, he has nothing to do with that CG Dragon, just Silver Link being Silver Link.</br>  <br>Did Silver Link do a lot of CGI recently? I only know their experimental/"Shaft-style" stuff and can't remember much CGI (if at all) in it.</br>  <br>They CGI is good when they use it to make an scene dynamic, but really bad when it is a creature or thing made with CGI.</br>  <br>They did some actually decent things with it in the previous season of Prisma, but like  said it was because they were using it to make scenes dynamic.</br>  <br>They used that here too in the very first scene.</br>  <br>I wouldn't know, I was asleep when it aired and am now waiting for subs.</br>  <br>Hopefully they use it in important plot related fights.<br>Though the ones in ep 1-3 were pretty decent even without it.</br></br>  Why did they adapt this generic fantasy shit instead of some other, more eye-catching and original Nipponese PnP game?  <br>Two reasons I can think of. Generic fantasy isn't actually as generic in Japan as it in in the west, and the high-profile names attached to it as players.</br>  <br>Because Nasu, Narita, and Urobuchi played this generic fantasy shit and not those other games.</br>  <br> some other, more eye-catching and original Nipponese PnP game <br>Like what? I spend a bit of time on /tg/, but I don't know anything about what the market is like in Japan.</br></br>  <br>I don't pay TOO too much attention to most Japanese systems, but it seems like chuuni urban fantasy is more popular than medieval European fantasy, and there's generally a much higher power level than something like D&amp;D.<br><br>Double Cross comes to mind.</br></br></br>  <br>I just remember /tg/ used to have a bunch of Nechronica threads, about half a year back or something. Basically it's about undead cyborgs who're sent out on missions into a post-apocalyptic wasteland by their necromantic masters. it's the kind of stuff /a/ would call edgy but still tune in to watch every week. Lolis are optional.</br>  <br> Also the original design for the butcher is fucking horrible. <br>sure it was more than a little edgy, but it was better than the new design.</br></br>  Subs fucking when  <br>Next week.</br>  <br>No way, the original design was super edgy while the new one is way more moe. <br><br>Aka I like it more because it's cute and the eyeliner is a plus.</br></br></br>  <br>I miss original Lou martial arts though.</br>  <br>It still might happen.<br>They might keep the event where Lou sacrifices an arm so that Qinsha won't be used</br></br>  <br>Can anyone give me sources for this? I hear Urobutcher played as a female character?<br><br>Did said character die?</br></br></br>  <br>He was male in the original, they just genderbended his character.<br><br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/3472-Red-Dragon</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>They are releasing a novelized version of this re imagining. <br>See here</br></br></br>  I'm just here because I heard one of the characters is literally Urobuchi.  Best OP of the season  <br>She's Urobuchi if Urobuchi were a cute girl.</br>  <br>Jesus, she's going to be the only reason to watch this show, huh?</br>  <br>No, there's also Nasu's character's maid.</br>  <br><br><br>I have a feeling every thread on this anime is going to say "WHY AREN'T GEN AND NASU THE MAIN CHARACTERS"</br></br></br>  <br> edgy cowtits <br> reason to watch <br><br>She is the less interesting character of the main 5. Japan didnt like her either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japan has shit taste, news at 11.</br>  <br> Japan didnt like her either. <br>But that doesn't mean that there won't be any femdom doujins of her eventually, right?  Right? </br></br>  <br>Japan prefers Swallow and Eiha so their taste is excellent.</br>  <br> Japan didnt like her either. <br>And since we care about the taste of elevens?</br></br>  Hold on, what the fuck happened to Urobuchi's character? I thought he was playing a man.  <br>He was. They switched his character's gender for the anime because they could.</br>  <br>What a fucking  brilliant  idea</br>  <br>fanart and doujins, pig gaijin don't provide either</br>  <br>Japan hates femdom.</br>  <br>They genderbend him. They asked for permisson to do it. He agreed.</br>  <br>Doujins, sure, but gaijin do make fanart.<br><br>Not all of it is good, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would they do that, his original character was the coolest.<br><br>Also why is the loli wearing clothes now. What happened here.</br></br></br>  <br>Chaos dragon?<br>What a shitass name Jesus<br>Why not just call it<br>The dark <br>Or chaos dark<br>Or chaos head<br><br>They would all be equally shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Coolest character <br> Not Narita's <br>Shit taste. Plus, new Lou is better than old Lou, and that's not just for having tits.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to give a hug to the person in charge of Eiha's redesign. Went from 6/10 to 10/10</br>  <br>Double Cross anime where mc is a possessed coffee maker when?</br>  <br>Delicious brown loli is too lewd to show on TV so they just got a less lewd fox loli replacement.  I'm fine with fox loli but I would've preferred the original. </br>  <br>I prefer bro dragon Nakata.</br>  <br> le japan shit taste meme :^) <br><br>Then, so those many doujinshis and fanarts are just lies? Damn.</br></br></br>  <br> western fanbase <br><br>I checked out the rest of the internet. A lot of people were definitely hyped up to disgusting degrees for this. I don't know what they were expecting but aside from /a/, everybody is fucking shitting on the first episode.<br>It's side splitting, I tell you. Side splitting.</br></br></br></br>  Still mad that they genderbent Urobuchi's character for no discernible reason.  Other than marketing <br><br>This is the first time I've genuinely wished for an anime to do poorly.</br></br>  <br>The wonders some names can do...<br>You would think after AZ that they would stop falling for it.</br></br>  <br>Anime Eiha realized she didn't have to keep wearing a slave outfit after escaping slavery, maybe.</br>  <br><br>I don't really know what you would expect really. They were playing a game, said game turned into a story.</br></br>  <br>What do you expect from the ignorant masses?</br>  <br>None of the big review sites actually gave it more thought than "a tabletop by those known people, could be fun."<br><br>I also love how they react to something when the subs are not even out, given that like 95% of the western fanbase doesn't know japanese at all.</br></br></br>  <br>It means Maaya Uchida voicing a batshit insane homicidal maniac, plus Urobuchi was okay with it, so I don't mind.  Looking forward to hearing her Hajime voice again in insight, too. </br>  <br><br>Crunchyroll and stuff like that had them labelled as "writers".<br>So it sounded like all 5 sat together and wrote the script.<br>In other words, literal false advertising</br></br></br></br>  <br>One wonders how people would react to Lodoss if it instead came out today.</br>  <br>This would be interesting.</br>  What anime is this from?  Any VHS friends here?  I miss the 90's. I miss summer breaks.  Literal proof of oldfaggotry.<br><br>The first animu I watched was on VHS. That was back around 1997. I seen shit like GitS, Akira, Ninja Scroll, Wicked City, Biohunter, etc. Those were interesting times. I wish I could experience those days for the first time again.</br></br>   no Ranma <br>Lose your sets in bingo game grandpa?</br>  Laserdisc or go home.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127497373 <br>Don't use emoticons on /a/.</br>  <br> Literal proof of oldfaggotry. <br>I have a shitload of VHS and Laserdisc anime and I've only been on /a/ and watching chink cartoons less than 2 years.

I almost bought Black Magic M-66 LD... also that project A-ko one....here's the only LD's and VHS I own. Still need to buy a LD player too....</br>    I remember watching Tank Police and Akira on VHS back in the 80s. I don't still own any tapes though, because they fucking suck.<br><br><br> Have you tried watching those?

The american laser disc lacked any special features, IIRC. <br><br>here's one with minnie may dollars.</br></br></br>  I used to buy the actual VHS until I discovered my local Chinatown. $5 p/tape? Never looked back after that.  We just don't get artwork on DVD/BDs anymore like they used to for LDs.  <br>They're the anime man's vinyl.</br>  <br>Are those the annoying plastic VHS boxes that the had at video rental stores?<br><br>I fucking hate those.</br></br></br>  <br>They're better than the shitty cardboard sleeves that you Americans have. In Australia we got plastic boxes for the majority of our VHS releases, and the American cardboard sleeves for blank VHS tapes or low budget releases like Christian animations and shit like that. Coincidentally, the VHS tapes in the plastic cases have lasted longer than the ones in the cardboard sleeves.</br>  Well then.  <br>Arranged marriage is still a thing in the east.</br>  <br>The reprints are always planned pre-anime in order to have copies ready in case the anime gathers some interest.
