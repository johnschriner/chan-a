Upfront cost is 40 bucks for a good brush and handle. Add on a jar of soap that smells of sandalwood for 15 dollars that seems to last indefinitely. Steal a cup from your kitchen. And finally 20 bucks for a hundred two sided Japanese stainless steel Feather razor blade. You'll be smiling into the apocalypse with a nice, clean shaven smile.</br>  <br>But you don't normally carry razors with you, and who is ever at home when the zombie apocalypse hits? Aside from Shaun.</br>    WTF my friend in Akihabara sent me this photo!<br><br>A famous shop in Akihabara sells the holy water which can prevent people from being zombie!</br></br>  Good night /a/  <br>B-but It's 3:00 AM, don't scare me anon.</br>    <br><br>Don't worry I will come rape you later.</br></br>  <br>I would feel much more secure if you just spooned me.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  Thanks a lot J.C. Staff now I have to check every shitty ecchi anime just on the off chance it might be as exciting and fun as Shokugeki no Soma  <br>Holy shit this is actually funny</br>  <br>Don't bother, the amount of good ecchi anime may amount to 3 if I remember correctly, and i'm not going to bother putting in the effort to look through my list for them since I have to go to work.</br>  <br>boku no pico is better than anything in this thread<br>just download it, it's an /a/ favourite</br></br>    <br>school days</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #4<br><br>Remember to please take it easy and relax.<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  Requesting Amakusa Shino, please and thankyou.<br>Optionally engrossed in a book of ghost stories late at night, but anything else is fine too.</br>  Requesting Chelsea, please.<br><br>Anything cute of her is fine.

Thanks!  Requesting anything cute of Honoka.<br><br>For specifics, requesting Honoka with twintails and wearing half-rim glasses.<br><br>Have a great weekend.</br></br></br></br>  No working thread? I'm disappointed.  <br>Tell me about poplar why is she so short?</br>  <br>Yamada will try her best!</br>  <br>Because small girls are  popular </br>  <br>I'm surprised the reaction wasn't as big on /a/ or in Japan, I thought it would be bigger. Although this is a common mistake many shows make, airing one or two seasons consecutively or yearly, and then taking a break, coming back and no longer being able to coast off of popularity/boost manga sales, which are usually the best when the author is still writing it and everyone is hype. But on the flip side, the threads have largely been nice when the new episode airs. Fun discussion, it lasts at least 400, 500 posts, so whatever.</br>  <br>Was posting worst girl part of your plan?</br>  SOON  <br>She will, and it'll likely be against Shun or Dennis, at least that'd be my bet. Her duel with Dennis was cut short on top of him fucking around trying not to be obvious. <br><br>So I'm wondering if she eventually has a counter for for when her monsters get destroyed (Jobelisk Blue decks were pretty much made to counter her specifically), or if she'll just have to stall against Dennis' Xyz, I doubt it considering she's apparently one of the best duelists Fusion has, at least I recall that being said at some point. <br><br>Could also easily set up Dennis getting annoyed and using Fusion revealing himself if something terrible goes wrong and sets him off. I think it'd be better than just having Fusion show up again to troll.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It might be too early in the plot for a duel between Ruris, but Serena vs Yuzu would be a good opportunity to showcase different Moonlight plays. Yuzu's got plenty of counters for fusion/special summons and a Ruri duel definitely get a full episode at the least.<br><br>Shun or Dennis do seem like more likely matchups at this point though.</br></br></br>  The question is if the Yuzus get their own bosses that can be splashed into the Standard's deck like the Yuyas. You know, for when Yuzu inevitably eats them too.  <br>I don't see the Ruris dueling each other unless that whole tag duel with Serena/Yuzu vs. Ruri/Rin thing turns out to be true.</br>  <br>If they do, they'll probably get them through their bracelets in some super pinch scenario related to their Yuya.</br>  Rei is so lovely. She'd probably be a great mother too.  <br>Never got the why some say Rei was submissive considering all those train scenes and other parts where she scolds Shinji or gives Asuka the cold shoulder.</br>  <br>how much of a retard does someone have to be to actually think that rei would be a good mother? she isn't even close to understanding basic social norms and behavior. being a mother is too much responsibility for a person who is almost catatonic</br>  <br>She also protects Shinji</br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <br> great mother <br>She reduced all of her other children to fluid and snowballed them into her favorite one until he felt better.</br></br></blockquote>]
