[ This dumb, ugly slut doesn't deserve love, respect or even humane treatment.<br>Sluthinus a shit.</br>  BURN THE WITCH  <br>Thats a sexy goddess I see there, she looks so cute fidgeting behind Touma.<br><br>Othinus a cute</br></br></br>  <br><br>She would have sorta redeemed herself had she died in NT10<br><br>Now she's Index tier, I wish it was only Touma and Sphynx.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying she isn't the one that Touma will lose </br>  <br>I still don't understand the whole "Raildex is ded" thing to be honest.</br>  <br>This fuck her asspull and kamachi catering to her whack fanbase.</br>  <br>Threads are shit, sales are dropping.</br>  <br> implying it wont be Nephthys who sacrifices herself so Othinus can live and stay by Touma side so she can give him some relief. </br>  <br> 53k in two days for a 10 years old series <br>It looks pretty good actually</br></br>  <br> 77k in two days for NT11,  <br> 53k in two days for NT13 <br>raildex is ded</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah if Mikoto wasn't on the cover I'd say it's decent.</br>  <br>Misaki&gt;Mikoto</br>  <br><br>I honestly can't tell if the people saying Othinus is kind ae just going with the joke or being serious.</br></br>  <br>I think that people are still butthurt at the HO announcement.</br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  <br><br>It died during WW3. Kamachi went too far with powerlevels.</br></br>  <br>Othinus is kind, Touma said so don't bother him about it.</br>  Othinus is fine.<br><br>Whorenda in the other hand is irredeemable garbage.</br></br>  <br>She's basically Kamachi's Sakura, what did you expect.</br>  <br>Nda&gt;Fre&gt;Frenda</br>  <br><br> Othinus <br> Frenda <br><br>Misaki is worse.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that Othinus is actually good but Sakura is shit.</br>  <br>Post your location you piece of shit.</br>  <br><br>I don't know if it's the proper word, but I feel there was more suspense back then. Fiamma was hyped up properly, the magic factions were a big deal which made Fiamma going against everyone all the more insane, the more subtle interaction between ignorant science people with the magic side (the Elizalina Alliance bits were pretty cool,) Hamazura's adventures the military showing how those outside AC/magic side were doing, etc.<br><br>Now it's just omnipotence motherfucker.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Othinus <br> good <br>keking here tbh</br></br></br>  <br>Nah sakura atleast gets treated like the piece of shit she is while othinus is the opposite.</br>  <br> implying she isn't <br><br>Stay mad and tasteless.</br></br></br>  <br>Your taste is the worst.</br>  <br><br>It went too far with the final battle with Fiamma and golden hands. It changed the series forever. <br><br>And Hamazura got boring fast. His adventures were a plot armor fest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What  said.<br><br>Othinus literally gets the "SHE DIDN'T DO NOTHIN SHE A GOOD GIRL" treatment.</br></br></br>  All the flat bitches are the worst girls in index.  <br>If Touma is ok with it then I'm ok with it. That's all there is to it.</br>  <br>There is no greater truth. She is the Queen of Tokiwadai after all</br>  <br><br>Fiamma was fine by himself as endgame level with the next step being Crowley, we were dealing with angel power at its full which was foreshadowed and hyped up since Volume 4.<br><br>The problem was that any antagonist after that was pure power creep.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Othinus is kind and she smells good.  <br>Realtalk.</br>  <br>Agreed. Misaki a shit.</br>   There are niggas in AC who step up to accel   <br> It went too far with the final battle with Fiamma and golden hands. <br> not with Gabriel back in Vol 4 or Izzard in Vol 2 </br></br>  <br>Misaka is best science girl and is way more popular in Japan. If she can't garner more sales for a LN that is in serious decline then no one can.</br>  <br>No. Shitway is undoubtedly the worst.</br>  <br> Misaka <br>Better than Misaki at least.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that doujins never.</br>  <br>What happens if accel is in the cover?</br>  <br>She may be a bitch but at least she's a cute sadist loli.</br>  <br>The NT11 cover is much better than the NT13 one, starting with the fact that younger Misaki is cuter than Mikoto. That must have been one of the reasons why NT11 sold more in the first 2 days.</br>  <br> Misaka is best science girl </br>  <br>If you want a reply from a Birdwayfag then here it is.</br>  <br>Agreed. Birdshit a shit.</br>  <br> Misaka is best science girl </br>   M-my Railgun didn’t cause that, did it? <br><br>Why is Mikoto so fucking stupid? God, her novel is solidifying her as one of the worst girls.</br></br>  <br> She grew out her breasts to specifically cater to Touma's preferences <br>That's best girl material right there.</br></br>  <br>  her novel is solidifying her as one of the worst girls. <br>It cant really be called her novel when she is in no way involved with the plot. Once again she has been shoehorned into the story.</br></br>  If accel got an anime what type of opening would it get?  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gd9<wbr>OhYroLN0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Really, anon? I think you need to take the stick out of your ass.</br>   Going rounds at each other's favorite girl <br> Othinus a shit <br> Frenda a shit <br> Misaki a shit <br> Misaka a shit <br> Birdway a shit <br>Yeah yeah and Itsuwa a shit. Glad we all done here, let's move on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know haters are desperate when you use a comedy scene of a 14 year old girl who panicked out of concern for someone she likes.<br><br><br> no way involved with the plot.  <br> Once again she has been shoehorned <br>Oh look, it's you again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her idiocy is big enough to infuriate the readers.</br>  <br>Frenda is no one's favorite girl.</br>  Tsuchimikado, Touma and accel team up when?  <br>Oriana is still the worst piece of shit ever.</br>  <br>You mean her haters trying to use anything they can just to say shit about her. Any legit readers would know she is far from being an idiot. She only overreacts and become frantic when it involves her dealing with affectionate feelings to a certain boy, and is to show that she is an emotional pure young maiden in love, one that suits her age.</br>  <br>In other words, still an idiot who can't control her autistic reactions and potentially lethal powers for stupid reasons.</br>  <br>Tsuchimikado really should have been the 3rd MC instead of that touma clone.</br>  <br> autistic  <br> potentially lethal powers <br> stupid reasons <br>Even for a hater, you're the real idiot here for trolling, nitpicking and sperging at comedy category scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> muh waifu did nothing wrong <br> you're all faggots for pointing out her idiocy because it makes me sad <br><br>No use in talking with waifufags.</br></br></br></br>  <br> she is an emotional pure young maiden in love, one that suits her age. </br>  Misakifags needs to calm down. Spiting Mikoto out jealousy isn't proper behavior.  <br> Implying it is a matter of doing wrong now <br>Nice strawman, hater.</br></br>  <br> hater <br><br>Keep proving your faggotry. Thank god the electrobitch gets BTFO in the novel anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> electrobitch <br> BTFO <br>He has you read like a book. You are a hater.</br></br></br>  <br>The story itself gives me the reason. For the stupid shit she always pulls around Touma she will never win or even be close to Touma.</br>  <br> Trying the deny the obvious seen in his retarded hate and stale arguments he always repeats <br>That's your second deflection on top of the strawman, Misakahater. If you're not going to bother to argue seriously then just fuck off. Your post here only helps proving my point about you.</br></br>  <br>Both shit characters so who cares?</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>Not that guy, but Mikoto still has Nuit or bro end.  Stay mad. </br>  <br>She is kind and smells nice.</br>  <br> Conveniently ignore his hater insult <br>Typical.<br> never win <br> or even be close to Touma <br>Like every girl ever. Only Index and Othinus are an exception for the second latter. Keep nitpicking harder out of butthurt.</br></br></br></br></br>   this thread <br><br>A year ago, people were saying Raildex had one of the most well-behaved fanbases for major franchises on /a/. I mean... what happened? Did your brains rot off? Hmm?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>sluten a shit</br>  <br>Itsuwa could easily have got close to Touma if she was in Mikoto's position.

That's why the plot keeps her as far from Touma as possible.</br>  <br><br>Mikoto &gt; Manipulative Bitch</br></br>  HELP ME KANZAKI PLEEEEEEASE  I want to punch Knight Leader for being a faggot.  <br>Nope. Kamachi would have her fuck up one way or another.</br>  <br> still has Nuit  <br>It seems Touma is the one who got the power up in NT13 with Misaka just going home to cry when she gets called a burden. Of course thats after High Priest goes down. <br><br>There was no talk or her even understanding what happen to Touma, all she knows is there is a huge distance between them. Not only that but the spotlight goes back to Othinus next volume as everyone knows because she is relevant to the story unlike Misaka. <br><br>NT is only about Othinus and it will continue to be until the end and a third part is released. <br><br>Misaka would always remain a secondary heroine and do you know why she has the spotlight now its so she can be thrown the fuck out just like NT3. Her character is just sad and pathetic and is obviously in the wrong series.<br><br>If you think she will get development off NT13 and will not just be forgotten then you're just fucking deluded trash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Clever Lady &gt; Violent Bitch</br>  <br>Yes, I hate those scenes, but no one can deny they're stupid, illogical. If you do, you're literally saying<br> muh waifu can't do wrong and she is always perfect <br>Pure blind fanboyism.</br></br></br>  <br> clever girl <br>Raptors are plenty violent, sir</br></br>  <br>She can't fuck up. She's literally a perfect waifu who is best suited for a boy like Touma. The other girls can't even compete.</br>  <br> I hate those scenes <br> W-W-Worst girl! <br>And her too, blind hater.<br> no one can deny they're stupid <br>Only to you because you hate them and everything about Misaka.<br> illogical <br>Young teens are illogical when they move on affectionate/romantic emotions? No really?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop projecting. If only she was in Index like she is in her manga, everything would be different.</br>  <br>You're a big guy, I like you.</br>  <br>You're a delusional waifufag.</br>  <br><br>Maybe Kamachi keeps her out of the story because he knows if she gets back in he'll fuck her up one way or another. I feel his writing has dropped in quality since OT and perhaps he knows this, he can no longer write old characters well (except Accel and NT9).  Which is why Himegami will never ever be relevant again ;_; </br></br>  <br> delusional <br><br>Someone didn't read volume 16.</br></br></br>  seria would have won if she made it a legit love letter  <br>Pure and innocent Mikoto &gt; Bitchy Slut</br>  <br> Stop projecting <br>You first, retarded hater.</br></br>  <br>They just need to stop spilling spaghettin and just confess, Touma is just waiting for that.</br>  <br>Boy you sure showed me with that well thought out retort.</br>  What new coloured wings will accel get next?  <br>I dont know what she did with him was fucking terrifying.</br>  <br> innocent mikoto <br> tortured an innocent women </br></br>  <br>Buttercup yellow</br>  <br> Strawmans <br> Runs away <br> Can't even argue <br/></br></br></br>  This waifushit thread needs some GUTS.  <br>Touma is to easy.<br>Gunha is the only pure boy.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br>My fellow Gunhaniggas</br></br>  <br>Seria is Mikoto Lite 2.0.

People could easily become puppets when faced with destiny. It was no different from shoving all six or seven billion people into a prison, giving them clothing, food, and shelter, and saying you had created an ideal society with no inequality, starvation, or poverty. <br> That might be ideal for the person grinning down from above. <br> It might be ideal for the puppeteer amusing himself by controlling the people desperately struggling from day to day. <br> If it continued for a century or two, it was possible no one would question it anymore. It would be just like goldfish that had been selectively bred to the point that they could not live in natural rivers. And if they did not question it, they might be satisfied with that twisted environment and they might think they were happy. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kamachi probably didn't put that much thought into it, since she's just a minor character anyway.</br>  <br>Nice fanfic bro.

(14.5)  <br>Vocals are shit.</br>  So Souma will indeed go head to head with mapo tofu vs mapo tofu, but if he brings out his cards on the third day, he's going to give Kuga two days to react and counterattack.

All is forgiven.</br>  Soma did almost nothing effective so far<br>He figured out the actual plan  only at the end of this newest chapter </br>  <br>The author really loves full moon shots doesn't he ? This is like the six or seventh time we've seen a character staring at it.</br>  <br>It's foreshadowing for the final boss.</br>  <br>It can be a good method of showing time progression.</br>  <br>That's because the moon is a motif, duh.</br>  <br>#2</br>  reminder this is the truest otp  <br>Is the final boss a werewolf?</br>  <br> we get this garbage after a glorious fula fula </br>  <br>No, the will cook on the moon in the final match.</br>  <br>No, they will cook against the moon.</br>  <br>Well<br> Tootsuki <br> literally 'distant moon' </br></br></br>  <br>  no erina this chapter <br><br>well I'm just gonna wait for the anime then</br></br></br>  <br>And they defeat the moon with a lunar cake.</br>  <br>If she can fix her tastes<br>The fact that she still despise commoner's food still pissed me off</br></br>  <br> The fact that she still despise commoner's food  <br><br>But thats not right.<br>commoner dishes she has no issue with, go back and read the chapter where she explains bento and why its a good theme for the elections, she hates commoner cooking, as badly prepared commoner food.<br><br>also<br> why dont you like what i like!!! <br><br>some people just dont like some kinds of food anon, deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dat neck. Suddenly I understand why vampires exist</br>  <br>Didn't she eat takoyaki in the drama CD? That's as plebeian as you can get.</br>  GOKIGENYO  <br>I still can't forget why Erina didn't allowed Soma to enter the school at the beginning<br>How you know it's no longer relevant?<br><br><br>I didn't watch that.<br>Any difference from the manga?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>vorefag pls</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#!PpUlzYgL!Zooqn<wbr>zTkDRpQbTIMiwGWZZjKWTeWB9P2gmbq6b1w<wbr>cXc</wbr></wbr></br>  Looks like the OP will be intense.  <br>Because that had nothing to do with the actual dish and everything to do with souma him self makin her heart go doki doki and she having no idea how to deal with it.</br>  <br>$2k a month? In, fucking, Tokyo?<br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>For me it looks like deep inside she likes that taste but still despise how it looks<br>I like it when Soma's commoner-like food makes miracle everytime, but will her view ever changes?</br></br>  <br> it looks like deep inside she likes that taste <br>Nigga she really loved it and didn't care about the look IIRC, she was only buttblasted because Souma proved her wrong and rubbed it in her face. If he hadn't done that she probably would have let him in grudgingly.</br></br>  <br>Again, she shows no issue with commoner dishes when prepared by people she considers good chefs, so the dishes being "commoner food" is not the issue.<br>she liked that dish enough , hell from her reactions we know she liked that dish more than anything else Souma has asked her to taste.<br><br>Using the first meeting as a basis for anything Erina related is not really a good idea because she was acting way out of character because of Souma getting on her nerves and the whole deal with her being super sheltered and not knowing how to react to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Using the first meeting as a basis for anything Erina related is not really a good idea because she was acting way out of character because of Souma getting on her nerves and the whole deal with her being super sheltered and not knowing how to react to him. <br><br>And more importantly, they needed her to react cutely because it was in the early chapters, and you know how SJ is. Need that hook within 10 chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember being really worried that this wouldn't survive the axe when it began running because the loan shark nee-chan getting BTFO and Erina's gasms were amazing. Best fap I've ever had from a WSJ series.</br>  <br><br><br>So I will take it as "she acknowledge him but because she didn't before so she will never act like that cause it contradict her characteristics", is it not?</br></br></br>  <br>that face</br>  <br> the loan shark nee-chan <br><br>Still in my top 5 of SnS girls, damn she needs to come back and try to hire souma or something.<br>maybe have her actually work for Eizan.</br></br></br></br>  who should the remaining four spots go to  <br>Guard down Erina is incredibly cute.</br>  <br>Smokes or Kuga maybe. You got all the girls already.</br>  <br>Giganigga, Childhood friend, Shinomiya and Freckles.</br>  <br> Aldini Takumi <br> Aldini Isami <br>That sounds incredibly wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Kurase, Nene, Fumio, Urara</br>  I didn't think it was possible to dislike a character more than I intitially disliked Erina, but then this cunt showed up <br><br>She should just go away, she's taking up too much space.</br></br>  <br>Make sure one of those slots is Taki.</br>  <br>Animeonly fuck off</br>  <br> maybe have her actually work for Eizan. <br><br>that could work</br></br></br>  <br>Reflect on your powerlessness to make that happen.</br>  <br>Why would an aggressive land shark using illegal means be working for an apparently upstanding food business consultant?<br>That don't make no sense.</br></br>  <br> an apparently upstanding food business consultant? <br>Eizan isn't above playing nasty and hiring goons who play dirty (see Mimasaka). He leads a gang of delinquents IIRC and is pretty much a mafia boss.</br></br>  <br>He hasn't done anything illegal or even THAT dickish on screen, though. Unless I've forgotten something.</br>  <br>Alice a best, get over it nigga.</br>  <br>Breaking and entering,and destruction of private property is pretty fucking illegal anon.<br><br>That said I can still see her being one of Eizan´s hencmen .</br></br></br>  <br>She can't be best as long as she lugs around the baggy eye fag. Get rid of him and we'll talk.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure unlawful entry in others' installations to cheat in a contest is illegal.</br>  <br><br>Ooops though you were talking about landshark lady, nah Eizan is clean... a douche, but he is smart enough to keep his hands clean, though he could have people working for him that are not so clean.</br></br>  <br> on screen <br>That's the thing, we haven't really seen him in action besides vaguely threatening Souma and sending Mimasaka on his ass. Once Souma downs Kuga I have the feeling he'll really mobilize his forces. Souma will need all the help he can get from PSD and the Nakiris and maybe the students he saved from Mimasaka's pillaging to survive Aizen.</br></br>  <br>I hope this new OP will be good, I'm hype for tomorrow.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I guess stalking is pretty fucking illegal.</br>  <br>God damn it the anime is already bringing more autistic haters like you.</br>  <br>If you're not a normalfag but post on /a/, you're automatically an autist.<br><br>That's you. You're not a dirty normalfag are you?</br></br></br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>I think you missed a zero.<br>22k.</br></br>  <br>you don't know what $ means eh</br>  <br>No he didn't. It is 2K a month and 24K a year in burger dollars.</br>  <br>did anyone ever bother translating the ED ever anyways? I heard that "fula fula" basically means "wobble wobble" but that's it.</br>  <br>Fura fura means  the pleasure of being cummed inside. </br>  <br>Is that why it's in the Shokugeki's ED too?</br>  <br>the faces don't lie</br>  <br>Does anyone have full faces compilation? I only have this version?</br>  Looks like the 3ds game is scheduled for winter according to dengeki.    <br> 3DS <br>Fuck, why not Vita? Fuck 3ds and its 2004 region locked hardware.</br></br>  <br>Did they have one for 14.5?</br>  <br>No, the recap didn't have an OP/ED.</br>  <br> any handheld besides nintendo <br> now or ever <br>it's not a big three market like consoles anon, 3DS is the be-all-and-end-all of handheld gaming</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. <br> yfw the last black square will never be filled because no more ED foodgasm faces <br><br><br>What is that game even about?  Can you fug any girl?  Or boy? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We could stick Souma with the red bg from the ED in the open square.</br>  <br>Apparently the game's story involves a school trip to Europe.</br>  <br>That can be a good solution. Although he is not naked and drawn more realistically instead of chibi style (but so is Shinomiya).</br>  <br> only Gin, Shinomiya, and Souma are non-chibi <br>First seat confirmed.</br></br>  <br>You can't marry into the Nakiri family if you don't have a proper pout</br>  <br>Doujima</br>  <br>Is that a mackerel burger reappearance that I see?</br>  <br> all the guys are blue <br> all the girls are pink <br> except jun, whos gray? <br>explain this</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126294978 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126295118 </br></br></br></br>  <br>It is, though you see more of the eggs benedict in the foodgasm.</br>  <br>that's the teacher chair</br>  <br>chair? you mean this is a seating chart?<br><br>does that mean that most of the guys are next to the window? in that case shouldn't souma be farther back instead of the front row as the MC?</br></br></br>  <br>Tempura bros, Mimasaka, Konishi</br>  I've been following the manga since Casanova put out the first chapter, but I haven't seen any of the anime. Where's it at right now? Any word on how far it'll go? How is it?  <br>It's at where Erina kisses Souma.</br>  <br>J.C. Staff is doing an amazing work, it's very faithful to the manga. They adapted everything up to chapter 33. The anime will have 24 episodes and it looks like they will adapt until the prelims of Autumn Election. <br>The anime boosted the manga sales significantly so we can expect a second season.<br>Also the 1st ED is comfy as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>We skipped the karaage arc and are getting Dad's visit right after training camp. The anime might get through the preliminaries of the election. It's nice seeing the cooking in motion and the food in color. They got a really great cast and I enjoy hearing everyone.</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Have you worshiped best girl today yet?</br></br>  <br>Again, they're not skipping the Karaage arc, they're doing it after dad's visit.</br>  <br>where is she? behind the cow?</br>  <br>The won't skip the Karaage arc.</br>  Megumi confirmed for GOAT  <br>I want to worship her feet. Just give me a good foot shot already! I'll take any of the girls fuck!</br>  <br><br>Oh, I didn't know that. I guess it would be more proper to say that they moved it.</br></br>  <br>I surely have.<br><br><br>But that's  a sheep .</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw I have the exact opposite problem, and intentionally crop any feet out of all pictures because it ruins image, especially if the girl is cute <br>feet are nasty bro</br></br>  <br> shut the fuck up </br>  <br>No, you're just a filthy pleb.</br>  has anyone subs to the recap ep? wanna watch that shit  <br>thanks for the reply friendo, I made her cute for you. your welcome</br>  <br> 15 years young </br>  <br>No.</br>  <br> 15 years old <br> 15 <br> 1 5 <br> ichi go <br> ichigo <br> strawberry <br>I'd strawberry my dick so far inside her god's tongue that whoever could pull it out would get 1st seat on the elite ten.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one of Erina though. I think it was from one of the manga front pages.<br>Whatever, I don't have it feetfag.</br></br>  <br>Is this the new pasta</br>  <br>I prefer my pasta al dente, not overcooked.</br>  <br>It was Alice.</br>    <br> http://imgur.com/a/rY6Rd/ <br>Man someone should get on scanlating this guys series, this extra was pretty good.

The extra? Or Isobe Isobee Monogatari?<br><br>The later hasn't even been scanlated.</br></br></br>  <br>God damn it Alice, stop being so fucking hot. Now I have to wank to your pics again. Also someone knows of a Tosh manga with a Totally not Alice character?</br>  <br> two <br>Add another one.</br></br>  <br>The extra, of course<br><br><br>Ironically most of the commenters are Megumifags</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would they remove it? It's just an extra included on volume 13. That doesn't make any sense.</br>  <br>Megumifags are for the most part cancer<br><br>I've only encountered sensible and agreeable megumi fags once every 5 threads or so</br></br></br>  <br> Shall we think of a menu with flavors that leave a strong image...? <br> Or else... <br> An impact that can tear away the customers' interest in that spiciness <br> If we put out a dish like that, <br> we can break out of the current situation...! <br><br> Fourth Impact? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they're retarded</br>    <br>Why are the fans of such a docile and cute girl so fucking autistic?</br>  <br><br> Can't appreciate a good thing when hey see it <br>Why am I not surprised?<br><br>Also check out that sense of self importance<br> "IF I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE, IT MUST BE REMOVED. EXTERMINATE!" </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> doujinshi <br> if there was a manga that was regularly draw like this <br>God damnit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ironically most of the commenters are Megumifags <br><br>C'mon anon, don't try to start shit. They're just idiots.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know<br>They were trying to psychoanalyze Erina a couple months back and concluded she had brain problems to act the way she does</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not even a fan of Isobe but that just ain't right. Pure disrespect.</br></br>  <br>The hatred is strong.</br>  <br>Erinahaters are literally retarded</br>  RMT when?  <br>We don't know that for sure, but since they mentioned the karaage roll appearing in the anime, that seems to be the likeliest option.</br>  <br>Fucking hell. Should I reupload it? Can I even reupload it?</br>  <br>Please do it.</br>  <br>Do it.</br>  <br>What did you upload it as last time?</br>  <br> The meeting of two people who should never meet. <br><br>The manga acknowledges it.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking yes anon</br>  <br>They need to interact more, their food is made for each other.</br>  <br><br><br>This reminds me of how some guy told me to check on the anime board of reddit telling me it might not be so bad and that they had an SnS thread going on there for the anime.<br><br>I went to check there and every post was just circlejerking over Megumi calling her the perfect waifu and Erina is a shit and has no redeeming factors. Coupled with the usual snickering manga readers doing the "Just wait until you see &lt;this character&gt;! she's best girl!" among other shit. That and they like to make a point saying that they'll not tell their anime loving friends they're watching this as if SnS is some level below what they watch normally.<br><br>Weird place. Never again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surprise Nao end.</br>  <br>she fed me a newt!</br>  <br> they reopen Yukihira together <br> no one ever enters their shop but those who do spend a ton of money in it to keep it going </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Everything's on imgur anyway. I'll be reuploading it bundled with the other chapter so it doesn't get removed again, but I'm still working on the IIM chapter so give me another day or two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>hah, not even the first monty python and the holy grail reference in SnS threads.<br><br> what, a japanese dish? <br> yes <br> you're using salsa verde! <br> what? <br> you're making a japanese dish with salsa verde <br> so? we have worked hard to complete this task and... <br> where'd you get the salsa verde? <br> we made it. <br> MADE it? from just the ingredients close by? salsa verde's italian! <br> what do you mean? <br> well, the only things we had on hand were japanese ingredients. <br> tuna swim all around the pacific ocean, and mandarin ducks migrate from mainland asia, yet aren't they still commonly known in japan? <br> ...are you suggesting salsa verde migrates? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>All these autists out there made me appreciate you guys more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A newt?</br>  <br>...I've had better.</br>  <br>Thanks for your work, anon.</br>  <br>Fuck them, we have all the translators.<br><br><br>Good luck anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> English dub translated this as roasted newt <br>In the original moon it was "charred newt". As in burnt black. I remember wondering why the bathhouse staff made such a fuss over something that was clearly overcooked and hard and not as flavorful anymore.</br></br>  <br><br>Just really pissed off that they did that all because of the art. It's an extra chapter, for christ's sake. I don't see anyone complaining about AssClass's art in comparison.</br></br>  HOLY SHIT?  <br>IIM does have a page on Batoto, I just checked it.</br>  <br>I upload it on both, then?</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>It's collab work, so yeah I say go for it.</br>  <br><br>Which volume, though? Or do I list it as N/A?</br></br>  <br>The IIM extra draw by Nakama Ryou was included on volume 13 of SnS. I don't know about the extra draw by Saeki Shun because I don't have the volumes of IIM.</br>  <br>Probably NA for Isobe.</br>  <br> Hand was someone not in the Polar Star dorm </br>  <br><br>Alright thanks, will upload on both when it's done. It's sad that Isobe Isobee Monogatari is so obscure that there aren't even properly levelled and cleaned raws ;_;</br></br>  <br>It's not even popular in Japan, if I recall. Finishes dead last on WSJ's table of contents every week.<br> Kochikame still there for novelty's sake </br></br>  <br> novelty <br>*tradition's sake</br></br>  <br> Kochikame <br>I swear that shit will still be running by the time I'm 30 or something.<br><br>IIM might have more of a cult following than mass appeal, also the tanks must be selling decently, otherwise it would have been canned by now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isobe it's special, it doesn't rank. It appears last because it's the last manga every week in the manga.</br>  <br> in the manga. <br>In the magazine.</br></br>  <br>The digital WSJ have nice raws, someone uploads it every week on Nyaa.<br>This isn't very popular in Japan, people don't even consider it on ToCs, just like Kochikame.</br></br>  <br> Isobe it's special, it doesn't rank <br>Any idea why? Is the author well established?<br>Is he a majority shareholder in Shueisha?<br><br>I can't find any other series that he's authored on MU</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really don't know. I read once that manga like Isobe or previously "Pyu to Fuku! Jaguar" have always a secure place in the Jump, but I don't know if it's true.</br>  <br>I really don't know why. Also it's not like it's a normal manga like the rest of Jump series, an usual chapter of this has 10 pages.</br>  <br>Probably because it shows glorious Nippon culture, traditional samurais and shit. Plus is drawn in the style which resembles traditional Japanese art. I imagine it to be very patriotic.</br>  <br>Probably some weird japanese tradition or a senior editor's preference.</br>  <br>I think from what I know from the synopsis the only thing overtly Japanese culture about it is the ukiyoe art style and the samurai setting.<br><br>The MC is literally a lazy ass guy who goes to school and vows one day to be a great samurai. Not much nationalistic or cultural pride to be had there.<br><br><br> senior editor's preference <br>That just makes me want to read it more, it's probably actually really decent at worst then if someone like that ensures it a place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  it's been one week  <br>since what?</br>  <br>There is even a chapter where he tries to hide his porn from his mom</br>  <br>since  you looked at me cocked your head to the side and said im angry </br>  <br>Now I want to read it, looks fun.</br>  <br><br>Why must you always remind us that you want to excrete your bodily fluids inside her?</br></br>  <br>That was in poor taste, anon.

Good to know /a/ hasn't went to complete shit this summer.  <br> loved <br>Nah the last time she saw him she was 6 years old, you don't retain emotions from anyone you don't see since that age.</br></br>  <br>She had her moments.  Her fight with Maurice in the graveyard being one of her best  but otherwise I sort of agree, shes like a watered down Rose.</br>  <br>This.</br>    <br>Felt like RGD had a lot of ups and downs, it takes a bit too long to unfold. <br>But 1949 was amazing through and through, Gabriel was great. Really enjoyed every scene with him and Butler.<br><br><br>I was a bit disappointed hat her father didn't even get a sprite even though most of her story revolved around rescuing him. Made her story a bit, I don't know, impersonal? But I'm not a fan of her story arc either, especially when the Chinese loli seemed so much more engaging.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as &lt;TRUTH&gt; flows through my bones there will be an occasional seacat thread.</br>  <br>Don't worry, these threads are the constant shit you cannot seem to wipe away</br>  <br> When they told her about the cliff accident and genital mutilation. </br>  <br>Chinese loli was kind of  flat <br>Best scene  snipers dueling at waterfront </br></br>  <br><br> And then Amakuza shot Ange in the face! </br></br>  <br>She didn't</br>  <br> &gt;4 rifles on the table<br> "I was going to kill you all if you didn't solve the riddle" <br> wrote several scenarios on how she'd do it <br> not a murderer </br></br></br> </br>  So do you consider Yasu well written character? Do you consider her to break the logic of the game? I know s/he divides people strongly.  <br>She didn't speak yet she still managed to be a more interesting character than Zel.  It's a series of scenes but the climax with the graveyard battle between Rose's faction and Richard's faction has got to be the best part of the game. </br>  <br> Maybe that anon misunderstood.<br>Yasu didn't got to kill anyone but this is because she lost in her own game, which led to the siblings killing each other before she could do something.<br>Had the siblings not solved the epitaph she would have killed them all, yep.</br></br> </br>  <br>I didn't like Yasu in the beginning, but I got used to him after a while. It's not a bad character, but out of all his versions I still prefer EP1-4 Beato.</br>  <br> But she really, really didn't kill anyone as we know prime culprits. Also nothing says things really went out as described in tea party.<br><br>Also we know Yasu (and Maria, with Yasu as her teacher as shown in ep 4) fantasized about killing people in revenge harmlessly inside their heads.</br></br> </br>  <br> So do you consider Yasu well written character? <br>Yes, she is.<br><br> Do you consider her to break the logic of the game?  <br>Not really, mysteryfags often cry over little details.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He would fare better by just switching sides and running off with her.</br>  <br>Yasu is the only TG-ish character I've seen done right. He was well done, and the alternate selves felt legitimate.</br>  Is there a R07 character stronger than Featherine?<br><br>Keep in mind I’m talking about Great Lady Featherine Augustus Aurora The Witch of Theatergoing, Drama and Spectating, with the Red Truth, the Blue Truth, a perfect Golden Truth and the ability to control the Narration and write Forgeries.</br></br>  Battler forgave Yasu, you should, too.  Daily reminder that even in the Golden Land, where even personalities can exist, Yasu will be forever alone because the only ones that were loved were those fakes Lion, Kanon, Shannon, and Beatrice. No one will ever love Yasu for Yasu.  <br>Yasu is just a vessel. There is no person known as Yasu (anymore). She became Beatrice.</br>  <br>I've seen this many times, but<br> Lion <br> fake </br></br></br>  <br>Except Yasu disregarded Yasu. Yasu's Yasu persona doesn't exist anymore.</br>  <br> A r07 character stronger <br><br>Dude, she wreaks havoc in powerlevel threads. The only one who could even have a sliver of a chance against her would be Bern, but I wouldn't hold my breath even for that.</br></br></br>  <br>No, anon,  Yasu really meant to kill people. Her initial plan was to commit lover's suicide with George (seeing that George would hardly agree to do this, she'd probably would have to kill him), but then everything went to shit when she heard of Battler coming back. And episode 7 tea party confirms she really meant to kill everyone if they didn't solve the epitaph. </br>  <br> She became Beatrice. <br> She <br><br>That aside, "she" only became Beatrice in the way a kid becomes a superhero by tying a towel around their neck.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yasu what the fuck, why did you kill everyone?! <br> Because you forgot about me so I became a intersex turboslut that wants to fuck everyone <br>but then you came back so I can't decide who to fuck<br> O-oh sorry, I guess it's my fault. Wanna fuck? <br>Battler is beta as fuck<br>Still liked the ending though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That aside, "she" only became Beatrice in the way a kid becomes a superhero by tying a towel around their neck. <br>Oh, fuck.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Yadu is a person on her own. She's the actor, ShKanontrice are her characters.</br></br></br></br></br>   claims to understand the truth <br> immediately goes back to wanting to fuck the fantasy version of a bitch that's been dead for decades <br><br>That's our hero, Battler.</br></br></br>  <br>  butthurt mysteryfag </br>  <br>Battler married an imaginary woman inside his mind, he's the hero /a/ deserves.</br>  <br> mystery faggot <br> using epic tumblr jargon meme <br><br>Seems about right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Battler understood perfectly. That's exactly why he did that.</br>  <br><br><br>LALALALALALALALA<br>CAN'T HEAR YOU<br>BEATRICE WAS RIGHT<br>LALALALALALALA</br></br></br></br></br></br>  When will they announce S2?

But she has a cute voice, and she has that hardworking earnestness Shigure's voice has.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, seriously, you give me good in game proof or picture proof. Plenty of ships have "masculine" names. I mean, Bismarck was named after Otto, and even the indirect ones like Kongou translate into being pretty masculine</br></br>  <br> Z3 just looks like a girl <br>No, she looks androgynous, she could pass as a boy or a girl. Z1 is basically a shota in all but name.</br></br>  <br>superior VA.</br>  <br> in all but name <br> Leberecht maas </br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure we all know what newhalf means. And come to think of it, she has no bulge whatsoever. Even if she got a sex change she doesn't have a dick anymore.</br>  Nakajima Megumi is totally underused.  <br> Z1 is basically a shota in all <br> Short-haired girls don't exist </br></br>  <br>The only masculine native Japanese name in KanColle is Hiei. Kongou is not gender specific, like the name Sam is in English. <br><br><br>Don't get cheeky, you understand what I meant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Musashi is probably one of the most masculine names of the IJN shipgirls.</br>  <br> Z1 <br> looking like a girl </br></br>  <br>I would disagree. If then, how come hiei isn't a trap? Where's eugen's bulge? How come she talks so convincingly feminine? Isn't Bismarck a trap then too?<br><br><br>And she's got tits that could concuss a man, this name thing doesn't work at all</br></br></br></br>  <br>Give her long hair and she'd be no different from any Witch King loli.</br>  <br>Hiei doesn't look like a boy, just tomboyish. All Kriegsmarine ships have masculine names. That's how German navy works.</br>  <br> And she's got tits that could concuss a man, this name thing doesn't work at all <br>I agree, forgot to say I wasn't that guy.

There is no sex-change of the genitalia. Think of characters like Marindale in Ixion Saga DT; looks like a girl, is basically a trap, but is biologically a guy (dick and balls).</br>  <br>That's strange, Akagi should have two!</br>  <br><br>Why do you guys have to come up with fancy words for faggots?</br></br>  Cute as Krupp steel  <br>Anon, I said once before, I know.

Not a wild leap if some of the licensing companies ban it.<br><br> I wouldn't defend him if he suddenly did a complete 180 in attitude like that. <br>He has already done this when money was waved in front of his face.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Digital, and with no download links.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he had actual CP (not that it should be any more illegal than anything else).</br>  <br> FAKKU even set up shop in Oregon because it's the only state that has declared obscenity laws to be unconstitutional. <br><br>You can still be prosecuted federally for obscenity, especially for selling and mailing obscene content like he is.

He did a drastic change of his standing point when it comes to his website. <br><br>Hardly. Here's something he wrote back in 2007 (three months after starting FAKKU):<br><br> The future for FAKKU is looking awesome. Soon we will have multiple people uploading manga directly to the site, which means a ton of updates every single day. Eventually I want to start translating the more popular manga titles, I want to talk with Japanese publishers and get them to ship us the actual manga and sell it on the site. There is so much that FAKKU still has in store! <br> I want to talk with Japanese publishers and get them to ship us the actual manga and sell it on the site. <br><br>It certainly took a while, but when the opportunity to actually do that came up it was only logical for him to jump on it, as it's something he has long wanted to done.<br><br>It was really the same thing for me - I've wanted to work on legit digital distribution for years (because I believe it's the way to truly push things forward), so when the opportunity for it finally came, I got right on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I feel like whenever I fap to 3D. Give it time. You'll reach here someday.</br>  <br>Next they will come for our lives.<br><br>Fucking jews.</br></br></br>  <br>I respect this man.</br>  <br>The memes are next  tbh. </br>  Personally speaking I think the Fakku team is pretty cool.<br><br>The site itself not as much but the people themselves yeah. Anyone else feel me here?</br></br>  <br> That's what I feel like whenever I fap to 3D <br>Same here, I'm always really sad whenever I fap to 3D over 2D. A wasted fap doesn't settle correctly in the heart.</br></br>  <br> I've wanted to work on legit digital distribution <br>Anyone with a sane mind would jump on such opportunities, especially with this much financial potential.</br></br>  <br>It's not tsundere if there is no dere.</br>  <br>Fuck off Jacob, you're an ugly, greasy, slimy kike.</br>   people, including 4chan posters, actually paying for porn <br> another thread of Daiz shilling <br><br>Awful.</br></br></br>  <br>How many cc's of loli would constitute an overdose?</br>  <br> Manpower really isn't an issue <br><br>Having bodies to typeset shit? Maybe. People who want and know how to decently? Doubtful.<br><br>Lot of people working in the scantalation industry do it because it's fun and it's a neat side hobby to them even if they're not getting paid. Money runs things. And once money becomes a factor in whether or not people want to typeset porn you know it's going to eventually devolve to articles like:<br><br> Fakku editors demanding to be paid more for typesetting porn with a lot of redraws <br>Dark days are coming, that's just how I see.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want Jacob-senpai to scratch his beard on the back of my neck and down my back.  <br> backpfeifengesicht <br>that looks like gibberish</br></br>  <br>Same here, hoping for something not so vanilla to get translated.</br>  <br> What's taking so long? <br><br>Well, it's a pretty big business deal, and as such it involves a lot and lot paperwork and other sort of business formalities that need to be sorted out before it can be given the greenlight.<br><br> almost two years ago <br><br>FAKKU Books in general was only announced like a year ago. And Titikei's going on sale in less than two weeks.
