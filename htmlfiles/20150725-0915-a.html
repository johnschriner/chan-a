Maruto never said there's "something big happening", he said that by episode 4 you get the idea what kind of show this is going to be. And since the students who left came back and A-TEC is alive and well I guess we're getting them building podracer.</br></br>  Mizuki continues to be defiantly entertaining<br><br>And no one missed that glance he gave to Iris right?</br></br>  Angelina = Hanako pfffffff  Why is every character best boy/girl? Including sensei.  I always think this show airs on saturday for some reason  <br><br>It does in Japan.</br></br>  Dead show.  <br>See, they are OTP!</br>  <br>I hate /u/ bait.</br>  OP single  <br>See, they love each other</br>  Subs when?  <br>IT'S NOT YURI THEY SAID</br>  <br>One hour.</br>  Thank god this show is CR, I'm not sure if I could take more Funi's bullshit this week.   thread dead except for /u/ shitposters   <br>Noice, I probably couldnt understand the episode if they go standing around and bring out some japanese business talk.</br>  <br> if they go standing around and bring out some japanese business talk. <br>This has been 90% of every episode so far.</br></br>  <br>This is one of those anime where you need the subs to understand this shit.</br>  <br>This. I think I'll just wait for subs next time, livewatch doesn't work at all with this show.</br>  Guys, I can't get past episode 2. It just seems too boring. Please tell me some interesting shit happens.  <br>It doesn't unless you like business drama.</br>  <br>Then don't watch it</br>  Well, at least episode confirmed that Iris also interested in Nagisa  <br>nopefuck off</br>  <br>Keep dreaming. Besides Nagisa is too busy thinking about his brother and Sensei.</br>  <br>So much pure love in this show.</br>  <br>There is nothing worse in today's anime than yuribaiting.</br>  Preorders are finally up:<br><br> **1,948位/**1,772位 (---,--- pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/10/28 【Amazon.co.jp限定】 ClassroomCrisis（クラスルームクライシス） 1 (メーカー特典:「霧科コーポレーション カレンダー(2016年)」) (全巻購入特典:「かんざきひろ描き下ろし全巻収納BOX」「描き下ろしB<wbr>2タペストリー」引換シリアルコード付) (完全生産限定版) [Blu-ray]</wbr> <br><br>RIP.</br></br></br></br>  H-horrible is out!  Subs are out.  Murricans won't understand this episode because most of them don't even know what labor union is  <br>This anon is right</br>  <br>Do you actually believe that?</br>  <br> In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labor union "density") was 11.4%, compared to 18.3% in Japan, 27.5% in Canada and 70% in Finland. </br>  <br><br><br><br> acting like this is anything new in Maruto anime </br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would anyone like this show honestly? The kids in this show are some of the most entitled spoiled little shits I've ever seen, they maybe talented at what they do but holy fuck they have no sense for money, respect or responsibility.</br>  Sensei did nothing wrong this time except maybe being too hopeful and naive. Joining the union is the right choice in this kind of situation, but Nagisa was smarter.  <br>The whole point of a character having negative aspects to them is so character development can happen. Especially for kids, because they don't all start out perfect. If you want gary stus there are anime that cater to you.</br>  <br>They were just told last episode that they have to learn those things and yet next episode already abusing the teacher's new position to get money for themselves. And it isn't just one character, it's all of them even the teacher who is an adult.</br>  <br>The show isn't even HALFway over you fuck<br>People don't change in a day</br></br>  <br>Not doing something doesn't mean you don't know what it is, anon. Labor unions are not difficult or obscure concepts.</br>  <br>Yet half the characters "quit" A-TEC and rejoined in the same amount of time it took them to not learn what they should know to not be little shits.</br>  It's been one hour since subs and I'm not seeing a single screenshot of the episode you fucking fucks.   Asspulls : The Anime <br>I fucking knew it will be like this.</br>  <br>Why can't you take your own</br>  Right down to business.  <br>They got the tools they needed to do their job.<br><br><br>By his logic Americans shouldn't know about African Americans.</br></br></br></br>  Not enough best girl.  <br>How is it an asspull? He joined the union to help the situation, Nagisa outsmarted him by making him a chief because unions can't work with people in such position since they're for laborers only. Of course they'e going to take advantage of that situation if it gives such chance. They now even have to follow union rules as he explained here.<br><br>Or if you think that the whole union thing is an asspull I just expect you have never worked in your life.</br></br></br>  <br> brand new manager <br> puts 30 orders for total of 500 mega <br> no one gets suspicious <br><br>And even if he got promoted, I don't think lowest level manager would have such priviledges.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maruto better get started on Saekano S2 if he wants another paycheck.</br></br>  <br>Why do you think Nagisa asked if Hattori had checked up on them?</br>  So they basically ordered 30 parts costing under 20 million yen spread out over a time period of two weeks?<br>Even if it wasn't all at once, that's a big loop hole.<br>It looks like it went under Nagisa's nose.</br></br>  And about that promotion.<br><br>Can't you turn down promotion? Or take some time to accept it?<br>The Union members were so overreacting it was cringeworthy.</br></br></br>  <br> The Union members were so overreacting <br>It was a joke<br>Just like calling him a dog<br>Retard<br>But no, sometimes you can only agree or leave company</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Worst character right there. I wish i was joking.</br></br>  <br>What a pair of faggots.</br>  <br>Rude</br>  I liked this episode. More corporate clusterfuck is always welcome.  TL note: He is writing "person" on his palm and eating it, this is to boost your confidence or calm your nerves before appearing or doing something.  <br>thx</br>  <br> lowest level manager <br>He was formerly just a manager, but now he's an executive. Executives have pull.</br></br>  What's Nagisa's master plan?  <br>I thought he was making the sign of the cross tbh.</br>  First actually good episode in this show  No more sensei bullying allowed. Only Subaru bullying from now on.  Worst episode so far, really considering dropping this.  Hahah.  <br>I-It's Maruto, wait a little more, don't leave us.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>This, gaming the system with legal technicalities is nice to see.</br>  <br>We all know that Nagisa is going to have the last laugh.</br>  Promoting Sera was Nagisa's plan all along, wasn't it?  Wow, why would Nagisa even care about Sera?<br>It's not like he can or want to stop him from becoming director or something</br>  <br>Because Sera isn't his enemy, he's a tool to use to win the CEObowl</br>  <br>Because he's falling for him</br>  Is sensei gonna cuck the reluctant boss kid? He's already doing a good job the tsundere wall.  https://d.maxfile.ro/fdsozgzdrb.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  So when does Slicing Simian show up?  <br>When Kirino reveals her powerlevel.</br>  <br>*scratching <br>I accidentally a verb.</br></br>   The students came back acting all mighty and dandy when they were the first to flee like little bitch at the first difficulties.  <br><br>I hate it.</br></br>  OP when?    <br>That's a strange way to celebrate. Do these kids not know of the high-five?</br>  <br>Yuri wins once again.</br>  <br>They were told that their program was getting shut down and they lost their entire budget.<br><br>Leaving was a good idea.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking' gay.</br>  That was so satisfying this show is so fucking good  <br>There is some nice fists animation.</br>  <br><br>You never did it with your buddies?<br>There nothing gay about it</br></br></br>  <br> There nothing gay about it <br>Your butt-buddies only told you that so you'd do it.</br></br>  <br>Its 2015, its okay to be gay/</br>    That Kojiro guy and the big lips girl really were annoying this episode.  Could Rider have won if Gilgamesh couldn't use Enuma Elish?  yes  no  <br>no, gill would just bust out enkidu</br>  No, sword spam along would destroyed his entire army.  <br>What if GIl was summoned as a caster class instead of an archer?</br>  <br>Doesn't Enkidu only bind gods?</br>  <br>you are retarded</br>  Gilgamesh is a Hack.  <br>He would cast swords at people.</br>  <br>This is why Fate/Zerofags should be banned on sight.</br>  <br>To be fair. Fatefags in genaral should be banned.<br>And they were for good reason at one point.</br></br>  Does Gil have enough swords for Riders entire army?  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>He'd use Enkidu to bind him and proceed to sword spam. He has nuclear weapons in the GoB, so an army doesn't mean much to him.<br>Rider was one of the few people to make him become serious in Fate/Zero, so I would be willing to bet Gil would use more of his vault against him if he couldn't use Ea. <br><br>Really, a serious Gil will always win unless it's against Enkidu. The point of Gil's character is that he is unbeatable in theory, but his hubris defeats him at every turn.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> The strength and durability of the chain grows stronger with the target having higher divinity, but is no more than a tough chain to a target without divinity like Saber, Assassin, or Archer. <br><br>The irony.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you read?</br>  <br>What exactly do you think they were implying? Because you're wrong, moron.</br>  <br>Can you? Unless you're stupid enough to be implying that Iskandar is in any way divine.</br>  <br>Secondary alert.</br>  <br>He is. And the chain works on anyone, it's just supereffective on divine beings.<br><br>Please kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>I read the novel, retard. But yeah, keep saying I'm wrong without actually proving anything or even making a point. God fuck it's summer in here.</br>  Gilgamesh could've summoned enough swords to defeat all the soldiers. They are technically servants but they are weak af. They have no noble phantasms and can't independently act. Rider himself was also weak at the time of their fight because he used it twice previously. He had no chance.  <br>Could Rider have won if Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon was filled with dildos instead of swords?</br>  <br><br><br>holy shit kill yourself<br><br>you haven't read shit<br><br>you're not even a secondary, you just straight up haven't seen the anime<br><br>can some mod please ban this shitposter</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure you did.</br></br>  <br>Nice, ignore the posts that prove you wrong, that will make them untrue<br> Rider <br> Divinity: C </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck I hate the person who blured out Lancelot's information like that.</br>  <br>No, they'd still be fucked.</br>  <br>Another secondary alert.</br>  <br>Good one.</br>   Gil shoots hundreds of swords <br> only 2 managed to hit Rider while he's running in a straight line </br>  <br>Enkidu would've worked even if he wasn't divine because he used his ultimate three times, even an above average chain would be enough.</br>  <br>He wanted Rider to reach him so he could stab him with Ea.</br>  <br>It was more of a pincushion according to the novel. Probably closer to this.</br>  <br>They're fucked.</br>  <br>Rider was at full power for the fight (sans his chariot), even more powerful than normal due to the CSs.</br>    Nope. The only reason he fought Rider seriously was out of respect.  <br>Could Rider have won if he spawned his army on top of Gilgamesh?</br>  <br>It is a bunch of chains, it binds whatever the fuck chains can bind. Including people. Its binding is stronger depending on the divinity of its target.</br>  <br>Man Rider sucks.<br>Even a 16 year old ginger is better at deflecting swords then him.<br><br>And that was when Gil was actually going all out and aiming, instead of w/e the fuck he was doing against alex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Rider's agility would be higher if he wore something other than sandals.</br>  <br>But it's just a normal chain to the non-divine, so anyone with decent strength should be able to break out with ease. If Rider wasn't thought of as Zeus' son, he probably could have broke it, although he'd already be dead anyway.</br>  <br>Iskander and TP Ganondorf. Who ripped off who?</br>  <br>Maybe. But it's something Rider would not do and Gil knew that.</br>  <br><br>Are you retarded? In the none translated blurred version it clearly didn't have that.</br></br>  <br>Plot armor only works on gingers up to age 17.</br>  <br>just fuck off already </br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>It at the very least has one dildo in it </br>  <br>That's probably from early in the LN when Lancealot was a complete mystery. They even say the black mist conceals everything about him.</br>  <br>Blurred is novel, unblurred is FZM.</br>  <br>Sorry, I haven't paid attention to the nontranslated one before now.</br>  <br>He wasn't at full power though, it was so instable he dissipated it as soon as gil pulled out ea. He saved it by not using it against Saber but even with the command spells, and using three times he had nothing else to do after but run at gil. He basically opened the fight with it because he was desperate.</br>  <br>He's the United States military of heroic spirits.</br>  <br>Can Rider defeat Shirou?</br>  <br>It became unstable because Ea wrecked all the soldiers who hold up the RM. Once over half are gone, it fades away. No matter how basic they may be, it's tens of thousands of Servants, more than even the Moon Cell can load at once.</br>  <br>Very possible, Shirou is a good anti-Gil but he loses to a lot of other servants who have mastered their weapons. It depends on which route we're talking about, but Rider could probably run him down with Gordius Wheel.</br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  <br>any servant can beat shirou, he was just lucky</br>  <br>As easily as breathing. He would shit all over servant Shirou too.</br>  Is this the most cancerous One Piece character?  <br>Why is he cancer? And some might say it's Law because fujos or whatnot.</br>  <br>I don't think you know what "cancer" means.</br>  Yes with Trafalgar and Sanji  So what is the meaning of cancerous nowadays?  <br>Totally agree with you he's generic , boring , ace 2.0 and asspull .</br>  <br>But he doesn't have any pincers.</br>  <br>That's not Kinemon</br>  <br>That would be Luffy.</br>  <br> So what is the meaning of cancerous nowadays? <br><br>The same thing as 'edgy' and 'cuck', apparently. <br><br>"Whatever character I don't like."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ace 2.0 <br> asspull <br>let's hear your explanations.</br></br></br>  <br>Completely agree with you, he's generic, boring.</br>   795 incoming <br> 597 was the 2 year time skip <br><br>what does it mean?</br></br></br>  <br> Topic back to shitposting about Sabo rather than the theory discussion we were having. <br><br>And we were having such a nice time.</br></br></br>  <br> two Sabo hate threads in a row <br>Abandon thread, sage</br></br>  <br>That OP has been underwhelming for two years, 200 chapters.</br>  Can we keep talking about the life tree eve and its likely connection to the gorosei instead please?

Did you read my mind?</br>  <br>What do you think Rebeccafag?</br>  <br>don't post fake wrestling made for teens and manlet fags here, pls.</br>  <br> marineford 2.0 <br> this time sabo is get caught  <br> luffy rush to save him <br> instead of WB fleet there is the revolutionary army </br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the theory might be true.</br>  <br><br>You two need to make hot sweaty and loving sex right fucking now.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128522686 <br>Calling something bait just because you disagree with it isn't very clever.</br>  <br> If I knew how many weeks were in a year I wouldn't be asking that question <br>Seriously ? How did you survive up till now ? How come you weren't decapitated by a horse yet ?</br></br>  <br>I only see a cancerous thread made by a cancerous faggot</br>  <br>I'm talking more about the roleplaying fags who posted about characters before, not that one post here.</br>  Timeskip is the cancer of OP due to being crap and constantly growing.  <br>Marinefordbabbie please</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>I hope when the Revolutionary Army fights the WG, they attack when the WG isn't prepared and absolutely massacre them at first.</br>  <br>I'm taking a huge shit, I don't have time for math.</br>  <br>Reminder that fags who claim that One Piece is shit since the timeskip are nothing more than a tiny but loud minority without any impact whatsoever. One Piece is still regularly occupying one of the first 2 places in the SJW rankings, the sales have been constantly great in the last 5 years (inb4 morons who have no clue about the MF hype in 2010 and backlog sales), on every big anime site the ratings of the manga are still as high as ever and One Piece is still breaking records almost on a yearly basis. And if you claim that is due because there are so many "blinded fanboys": Naruto and Bleach dropped down in everything after they went to shit while One Piece didn't. Face it, you grew out of One Piece and now you just are desperate to find other people who share your shitty opinion to make yourself feel better. Just fucking drop it already and spare us with your petty bitching.</br>  <br> I got so used to work weeks that such a question came up and I thought the answer was 50 </br>  <br>I'm smart as fuck.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I dont know, maybe this anon isn't retarded, maybe he intended "fuck 4 years are already passed from that point?" or something, who knows</br>   /a/ suddenly hate Sabo <br><br>WTF happened???</br></br>  Usopp had balls when he absolutely needed them.  <br>My maths are pretty shit and like I used to be a math wizard.</br>  <br> argumentum ad populum <br>Convincing. Also Naruto went to horseshit during and after the second Chuunin exam test, and didn't drop in popularity until way after.</br></br>  <br>Sabo is only hated on /a/</br>  <br>It's just one obnoxious guy, don't give it any mind.</br>  <br> One Piece is still regularly occupying one of the first 2 places in the SJW rankings, <br><br><br>That doesn't mean anything. japs have terrible taste.<br><br><br>The timeskip has been lackluster. Dressrosa is a mid range arc at best. Doflamingo has been carrying the entire timeskip</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why didn't luffy use gear 4 against noah when it was falling down on fishman island?  What episode is the scene where Luffy talks to Big Mom animated?  <br>yeah, keep telling yourself that. Naruto dropped in sales, in ratings and rankings everywhere.</br>  <br>You're not taking Oda's breaks and Japan's holidays into account. One Piece had only 39 chapter in 2014, for example.</br>  <br>oh anon, we really have to answer this question? REALLY?</br>  <br>Rebecca is also only hated on /a/. She is popular on tumblr.</br>  <br>Because Gear Third has higher overall destructive power. It's basically Luffy's best PvE ability.</br>  <br> muh japs have bad taste but I don't <br>fuck off and stop being childish tripfagging cancer</br></br>  The fanbase.  <br>top-tier delusion, I hate him too</br>  <br>I don't. They like the One Piece animation as well along with the fillers.<br><br>That's all that needs to be said about their tastes.</br></br></br>  <br>let me guess? You marathoned till MF and then started reading weekly?</br>  <br><br>Why people like you are still reading this manga is beyond me. You obviouosly don't enjoy it anymore so what is the point? All faggots like you do is reading every new chapter to bitch and nitpick about everything. Give it a rest and free yourself.</br></br>  <br>Does Tumblr get mad because she has a sexist father and gets constantly disempowered?</br>  <br> Dressrosa is a mid range arc at best <br>Read in bulk it works so much better. Just read through the entire thing with the non-shitty Viz translations and it works so much better.<br><br>Fishman Island will be held in much higher regard later on in the story. The stuff it sets up in the background is huge.<br><br>Punk Hazard was a pretty cool adventure arc. Again, read much better in bulk.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No idea. I'm not from tumblr.</br>  <br>I am japanese and I can tell you well all think you westerners have shit taste. Sayonara turipufaggu.</br>  <br><br><br> projecting <br><br>I've been reading since 2000 or so. I am not going to stop because quality dipped. I kept reading naruto and I am still reading bleach. you don't have to sit there and masturbate to everything Oda does.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>PH was still pretty shit in bulk imo due to the fucking running and children, but agree on FI.</br></br>  <br>Where do you read Viz translations?</br>  <br>fuck off cancer</br>  <br>More like she's popular on Tumlbr and hated everywhere else.</br>  <br>/v/ happened. All those faggots of /v/ need to leave.<br/></br>  <br> misspelling "torippufaggu" <br> Japanese <br>I don't believe you.</br></br></br>  <br> http://vizanon.imgur.com/ <br><br> inb4 hurr durr you spoonfeeding bastard <br>I don't care anymore. After tripfags got accepted in the OP threads nothing matters<br><br><br>I'm not from /v/ and I can tell you sabo is a shit character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>/thread</br></br></br>  <br> PH was still pretty shit in bulk <br>I disagree</br></br>  Can we make this a manly character appreciation thread? If not, just post your favourite pages (in colour). Find the coloured versions at Bato.to or Kissmanga.  <br><br>You liked the running and children? <br><br>Because take that out, and I would have enjoyed it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not Robin, /a/non.</br>  <br>Why are you quoting a post 3 times? That is unnecessary.</br>  <br><br>Zoro is probably even more tanky now.</br></br>  <br>Anon that's not Buggy.</br>  <br>Pretty good, actually.</br>  <br>Thanks. I only ask because I don't know if I've ever read a full English copy. I've always read scanlated chapters online.<br><br><br>He was way tanky early on too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, see <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128523519 </br>  <br>I don't get why people complain about the running part. There was enough stuff happening during that time. And the kids did not really bother me. The parts were they played a role were over fast. They were not a central part of the arc at all.</br>  <br>That looks awful and you should feel awful</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah I know.<br><br>But with him specializing in CoA and having fought in that near death state vs. the Baboons and assumedly Mihawk too for 2 years, holy fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh look, it is that single colour hating fag again</br>  <br>I buy the fucking books and subscribe to Jump.<br><br>Viz Anon's been uploading the WSJ stuff since about Volume 73/74.<br><br><br>I hated the running weekly but in bulk it was great for keeping up the pace and tension.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128523519 <br>Tumblr agrees with me.<br> She never had a choice to be a pacifist, because her pacifism was forced upon her by her being too weak and scared to fight. She WANTED to fight. She really did. But she couldn’t, she ran, Robin held her back, Kyros told her not too–no one cared about how much she wanted to help protect her father, because Oda set up the story so that the only Kyros protecting her was what mattered. And yeah, it is important for parents to protect their children, and I think that’s what Oda was going for here. However, liked I talked about here, he could have done that without making Rebecca lack all agency and accomplishment for the entire arc.  <br> Rebecca was stripped of all choice, all agency, all accomplishment, and all her strength. She made made into nothing but a damsel in need of protecting and saving and nothing more. There were so many things Oda could have done to retain the positive messages he wanted to include, without completely trampling Rebecca’s agency.  <br>Now you know that many people share my opinion.</br></br></br></br>   no chapter this week <br> chapter release cancer still here <br>why?</br></br>  <br>No it wasn't over fast and yeah they were pretty central. The entire latter half was how they were in "danger" of dying and it was dragged out heavily.

Similar to the bird cage stalling.</br>  <br>True.

But then Oda cut the legs out from under her and made her completely useless, scared, unable to fight, unable to even flee successfully, and did nothing but stand on the side lines and cry and shout in the final fight against the man who killed her mother. <br> She made no choices. She had no agency. She fulfilled none of her promises. She accomplished nothing the entire arc. She was victimized and beaten at every turn and did nothing but rely on her father in the big climatic fight. The whole thing of praising her on the basis of “honoring her mother’s wish”? That praise is forced and false because Rebecca did nothing of her own free will to honor her mother in that final fight. If she had had the chance to kill Diamante and chose not to, THAT would be honoring her mother’s wishes. But being too scared and running away and crying and begging to be saved? How the heck is that her making a CHOICE about anything? </br>  Post your favorite Strawhat.  <br>Thanks for reminding me that I need to filter you</br>  <br>Everything she says is true though.

I agree with everything she says.<br> That’s why I’m so mad about what Oda did with Rebecca. Oda could have done it all with her. He could have had her fight bravely against Diamante–overcoming her fear of him and fighting side by side with her father to protect him–and then CHOOSE not to kill him in the name of revenge in order to honor her mother’s wishes and not dirty her hands like her father wanted for her too. That would have been an incredible way to have Rebecca succeed in her goal of protecting her father while also honoring the principles she was raised with. But no. Rebecca’s “success” in not staining her hands was the result of her simply failing to be strong enough to fight to protect anyone. Oda threw Rebecca’s agency and ability into the dirt so that she could be protected by her father. </br></br>  <br><br>Best SH.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>    <br>Not him, but damn son, you need to work on your arguments.</br>  <br> rebecca doesn't want to hurt people <br> kyros doesn't want rebecca to fight <br> hurr durr WHY DIDN'T GODA MADE REBECCA DEFEAT DIAMANTE <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why have I never seen that gif before.<br><br>Absolutely hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Praise the Urouge.</br></br>  <br>Wonderful, and I'm not being ironic. <br>Someone should stick Oda to the ceiling of his own toilets and force him to watch as his wife and daughters take a shit evere morning.

To fight and win so that she could give back to him like he had always given to her. I really loved Rebecca and Kyros early on in the arc. I loved how much Kyros cared for and loved her, and I loved how much she loved him. And I loved how Rebecca was fighting against insurmountable odds in order to protect him like he protected her. Rebecca and Kyros were one of the best parts of the arc to me early on. <br><br>But what happened after that? She accomplished nothing and only cried and had to be saved. She lost all her agency and ability. She broke every promise she made and fell short on every goal she had.

Are you going to leave One Piece threads?<br><br> Oda stripped away everything about Rebecca that made me love her character so much and made her into yet another damsel in distress who can’t fight and needs to be saved. Oda sacrificed Rebecca’s agency and dignity in order to give everything to her father—her father got to avenge Scarlet’s death, her father got to protect Rebecca yet again. I do love Kyros, but I utterly hate how terrible Rebecca’s treatment has been this arc. We were promised so much with her and given nothing. <br><br> I’ve got a few more things to say. First, I’d like to preemptively remind people that everything about what happened to Rebecca was a choice on Oda’s part. I’ve been told multiple times by people that it makes sense for all this to happen because Rebecca’s too weak to fight against Diamante. But Oda is the one who decided how strong Rebecca would be. He decided for her to not even have a sliver of her father’s strength and that Kyros would fight all by himself. I explained this before (here).  <br><br> Second, we have already had Rebecca’s character before. A 16 year old pacifist princess with a dead mother and pink hair whose strength is attributed to her NOT fighting. Hmm… why is that so familiar…? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, I'll just find it even more hilarious.</br></br>  <br> She broke every promise she made and fell short on every goal she had. <br>nope, there's literally not a single promise she broke nor a singel goal she didn't reach. Yeah she wanted to win the tournament and get the mera mera, but what for? Right to defeat doffy. Doffy is deafeated, Diamante is also defeat, she has her father back, so there is no need for her to be fed up about not getting the mera mera, because all the primary goals came true. There is literally nothing that suggest that she failed in anything that her character was meant to be.</br></br>  <br>They declared the fake news about Doflamingo retiring and then left the island. In the last chapter Sabo said that they have turned around and coming back to the island.</br>  <br>That's cool to know. I'll probably read the translated chapters each week when I remember to then.</br>  <br>You're living your life correctly. I don't think I'd find the power in myself to overlook or even enjoy such heresy though.</br>  <br>I gave him a strawhat.</br>  <br> who is Trafalgar Law </br>  <br> LE SANJAY IS BAD MAY MAY <br>Fuck off back to reddit.</br></br>  <br><br> You're living your life correctly <br><br>Touma pls, but yeah I just laugh as whatever happens someone will be butthurt. <br><br>And worst case scenario, it's another walking pair of tits, thanks Oda.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the Reddit consensus?</br>  <br> sanji's real dream is becoming queen of the Okama's </br>  <br> nor a singel goal she didn't reach <br>By herself ?</br></br>  <br>You should read everything, not just two lines. Perhaps you will understand better.<br><br> Also, the narrative of the story doesn’t validate the idea of pacifism. Sure, Kyros defends the idea aloud on the basis of her honoring her mother’s wishes and staying beautiful… but in the actual narrative course of the story, there are enemies who NEED to be defeated. <br> Diamante NEEDED to be cut down. Violence was absolutely necessary in this situation, and thus the very idea of pacifism–refusing to fight regardless of the circumstances–is invalided. <br> Rebecca is only able to be praised for not fighting because her father picks up the slack. If more people on the heroes side had Rebecca’s “beautiful” pacifism, they would all be dead and the villains would win. In One Piece, pacifism is a virtue only enabled by having other people fight for them. On FIshman Island it had some merit because the arc had larger themes about not passing on hatred, but there are no themes or plot elements in Dressrosa that give actual weight to the idea of not fighting utterly monsterous people like Diamante and Doflamingo. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how Oda handles him after this arc.</br>  <br>Sabo literally said they were *coming back* to the island. So they weren't here.</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128523519 <br><br><br><br><br><br> implying you are not that tumblrina advertising her own blog </br></br></br></br></br></br>   Sanji is a bad character because he acts dumb are wimmin. <br>That's just Oda's latent homosexuality unconsciously coming through in the writing.<br><br>Sanji's best moments are him being a bro. He takes care of Chopper and Usopp better than any of the other characters.</br></br></br>  <br><br> responding </br></br>  <br>We saw when they arrived to the island and they hadn't left before bird cage.<br><br>Surely they didn't go there just to deliver fliers and run errands.</br></br></br>   When this arc started out, Rebecca was set to be a major player. She was the “undefeated woman,” who was so good that no one had laid a hand on her in the Colosseum (a convenient way for Oda to design a female gladiator with no scars and no muscles and the same face and body as Nami and a dozen other women in OP). She was a serious contender for getting the Mera Mera no Mi, and made incredibly moving declarations that this time she would not need saving–that this time, she would protect Soldier-san! Then what happened? What happened after Oda created this inspiring character with a brutal struggle and an incredible drive to protect the man who raised her? <br><br><br>His post isn't underrated since I saw it written many times.<br><br><br>I am not her but what if I am?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What reason would they have to stay?</br>  <br>That tumblrina doesn't need me to advertize her blog, it's popular enough already.</br>  <br>Probably because there was a battle going on they could influence in the direction they wanted?</br>  <br> By herself ? <br>does it matter? She got everything she wanted. It wasn't her goal to slay diamante. It was her goal that he gets what he deserves. Sh edidn't want to kill doffy to say "kek I killed the king", but to save the island. And both happened.<br><br><br>Everything you post is retarded and goes against rebecca's character.<br><br> there are enemies who NEED to be defeated. <br>Yeah and they were defeated.<br><br> Diamante NEEDED to be cut down. Violence was absolutely necessary in this situation, and thus the very idea of pacifism–refusing to fight regardless of the circumstances–is invalided. <br>Nope both wrong. Even if diamante had to be defeated, there was no reason to force rebecaa to act out of her character and be violent.<br><br> If more people on the heroes side had Rebecca’s “beautiful” pacifism, they would all be dead and the villains would win. <br>But rebecca was the only one that was her quirk/personality/individuality, so your argument is invalid.<br><br>  but there are no themes or plot elements in Dressrosa that give actual weight to the idea of not fighting utterly monsterous people like Diamante and Doflamingo. <br>Her parents fucking wishes. It's like you didn't even read the arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I am not her but what if I am? <br>Then you should fuck off back to tumblr</br></br>  <br> and made incredibly moving declarations that this time she would not need saving–that this time, she would protect Soldier-san! <br>Oh shit I had forgotten all about that.<br>It's depressingly hilarious in retrospect. Oda really screwed up bad with this whole subplot.</br></br></br>  <br>True. As far as I'm concerned, less screen time would be a good start.<br>But I am hating the ope-ope immortality horseshit regardless.</br></br>  OTP reminder.  <br> Yeah and they were defeated. <br>You didn't read what she wrote properly and didn't get the point.<br><br> Nope both wrong. Even if diamante had to be defeated, there was no reason to force rebecaa to act out of her character and be violent. <br>You didn't read what she wrote properly and didn't get the point.<br><br> But rebecca was the only one that was her quirk/personality/individuality, so your argument is invalid. <br>You are interpret this sentence in the wrong way, so your argument is invalid.<br><br> Her parents fucking wishes. It's like you didn't even read the arc. <br>You didn't read what she wrote properly because you are convinced that I am the one who wrote everything. It's like you didn't even read anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> does it matter <br>It's the heart of the problem, son. See </br></br>  <br> CP0 participated in the battle <br>'Kay, now I know you're baiting.</br></br>  <br> yfw law dies against kaidou <br> "D-don't worry mugiwara, I already made you immortal when I saved you back at marineford, that's why I would die either way after three years from then" <br>I would literally fly to japan and assasinate Oda</br></br></br>   Well, first she only advanced through D-block because Hakuba took all the competition out for her, something I defended at the time. I still think that it was impressive on Rebecca’s part, because she withstood Hakuba’s attack when no one else could, however that was the highlight and only achievement she has had this entire arc. Now, let me repeat again something I’ve said in the past: <br> “The one I’m hoping for most is for Rebecca to be the one to fight Diamante. I absolutely love Rebecca’s character, but it’s frustrating how little she’s been able to accomplish this arc. All she did in the finals was hit Diamante’s shin with a blade-less sword (seriously Oda, why the hell did you have her walk into the finals with a sword with no blade?), get smacked in the head, have to get protected by Bartolomeo, and then cry while Diamante taunted her about how he killed her mother. If Rebecca doesn’t waste Diamante’s ass this arc, then that was a lot of abuse thrown at her character without anything then accomplished by her to show for it.” <br> “If Rebecca doesn’t waste Diamante’s ass this arc, then that was a lot of abuse thrown at her character without anything then accomplished by her to show for it.” <br> And look what’s happened now. Not only did Rebecca NOT waste Diamante’s ass, she cried and screamed for her father to come save her and didn’t even try to fight. <br><br>So I won't.<br><br><br>Exactly, this subplot became nonsense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it doesn't. <br><br><br>Nope I already proved everything you posted wrong you retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't say they did. You asked what reason(s) they could have for staying.<br><br>They obviously didn't participate which brings me back to what I mentioned first which is what they did their time there. They didn't need to send the premier spy agency to the island where shit is about to go down just to hand out news.</br></br></br>  <br>the last we saw of them were them walking along the street past Law &amp; Co. and that's it. And Sabo made it clear that they left the island before the Bird Cage happened and are now turning back after hearing the news.</br>  <br> Same DF <br> Same introducing scene ( we 'll talk after luffy , now we don't have the time) <br> Literally the same words in the last chapter <br>Literally things the author purposefully put in to create parallelisms you dumb fuck. How can you not tell, unless you really are retarded and think Oda didnt create these similarites on purpose?<br><br> Same personality <br>Fuck off. You know this isn't true.<br><br> Both are under the order of a very strong man. <br>Right because Ace and Sabo are the only ones right?<br> Same Haircute <br>You forgot that they're also both male, and have two arms and two legs! By your logic the scar on Sabo's face alone should be a key indicator that Sabo and Ace are two completely different characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Same personality <br> Fuck off. You know this isn't true. <br>But it is.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd fund your trip.<br>But I think Luffy may die young after all.</br></br>  <br>I'll have to disagree on that. It matters for story consistency. But it's perfectly fine if Rebecca, storytelling quality, or both don't matter to you.</br>  <br>You didn't understood anything and didn't get point. For example, <br> Yeah and they were defeated <br>You implied that you believed that she complained about Diamante not being defeated, when she actually complained about Rebecca fighting properly.<br>In other words, you lack reading comprehension skills. You didn't get any point at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto's rankings fluctuated pretty frequently when things started to get shitty.</br>   I read all of this with nothing but a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach–not because of any dread for Rebecca’s life, but because my fears that Oda had spent this entire arc having Rebecca get abused and humiliated only for her to get saved again in the end without ever once accomplishing anything on her own came true. <br> Once again, Oda developed an incredible female character and then shoved her to the side and said, “Sorry, you don’t get to be strong enough to fight. You’re here to get saved.” This is Punk Hazard all over again–where Tashigi valiantly took a stand against Vergo and Monet and called Zoro out on his sexism and then proceeded to get torn apart and had to get saved by the same person who doesn’t even view her as a threat worth taking seriously. <br><br><br>They matter.</br></br></br></br>  Can somebody post some Dellinger?  <br> anyone who doesnt share my opinions must have shit taste <br>Oh a tripfag. Why am I not surprised.</br></br>   This is a battle manga. The ability to fight for your beliefs is incredibly important to validating characters’ beliefs and in giving them agency. But here, Rebecca didn’t even TRY to fight. She didn’t show her ability, and she didn’t even show bravery. She was just there to be as helpless and pathetic as possible so that Kyros could save her. Rebecca was possibly my favorite new character this arc, but Oda has done a damn thorough job of reducing her character to empty promises and failed potential. <br> God forbid that Kyros fight Diamante in order to avenge his wife alone. God forbid that REBECCA be the one who fights for the sake of the mother she lost, god forbid that Rebecca fight like she promised to protect her father. THEY AREN’T EVEN FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE. INSTEAD OF WORKING TOGETHER TO DEFEAT DIAMANTE, THE SECOND KYROS SHOWS UP HE TELLS HER “YOU NO LONGER NEED TO FIGHT.” No–Rebecca isn’t as important as Kyros, despite having every bit as central a character–it doesn’t mater enough for Rebecca to show any agency this arc. She’s just been there to be abused and get saved. <br> That is all Oda has done with Rebecca’s character–have Diamante and the Colosseum crowd insult her, humiliate her, beat her, make her cry, make her run in fear–all without Rebecca turning things around and showing a single scrap an accomplishment of her own. </br></br>  <br>Wow, I expected much more bullshit and headcanon but in the end this article is more an accumulation of facts.<br><br>Good read indeed.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>well obviously reletivly young. id say 40s</br>  <br> You implied that you believed that she complained about Diamante not being defeated, when she actually complained about Rebecca fighting properly. <br> In other words, you lack reading comprehension skills. You didn't get any point at all. <br>You are writing things that were never mentioned in anything you posted retard. Look here <br> &gt;Also, the narrative of the story doesn’t validate the idea of pacifism. Sure, Kyros defends the idea aloud on the basis of her honoring her mother’s wishes and staying beautiful… but in the actual narrative course of the story, there are enemies who NEED to be defeated. <br>Nothing suggests that Rebecca has to be the one, it suggest that there are enemys she probably has to fight as she also almost fought diamante. An dconsidering that it would have been shit writing if she had ignored her parents wishes and helpes kyros/fought alone. YOU are the one who has no reading comprehension and doesn't even read what he posts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They like the One Piece animation as well along with the fillers <br>And how the fuck do you know that?</br></br>  <br><br>stop copy pasting your fucking tumblr essay in this thread</br></br>  <br> This is a battle manga. <br>that doesn't mean that everyone has to fight nor that fighting is the only way to archieve yur goals, therefore your whole argument is moot.</br></br>  PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY COPY PASTING TUMBLR POSTS AND DEFENDING THEM. WHETHER THEY HAVE MERIT OR NOT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE. FUCK OFF BACK TO TUMBLR AND NEVER COME BACK. STOP REPLYING YOU FAGGOTS.  <br>ratings? reviews? The fact it's super popular over there?</br>  I hope the next arc has no women in it. I don't want more arguments.   people think sabo was actually at loguetown <br>kill yourselfs</br>  <br> nor that fighting is the only way to archieve yur goals <br>But that's exactly what it means.</br></br>  <br>yeah, because conis is fighting allday</br>  <br> You are writing things that were never mentioned in anything you posted retard. <br>You apparently didn't read the second sentence and also didn't realize that what I posted was one part of many posts. You lack reading comprehension skills.<br> Nothing suggests that Rebecca has to be the one, it suggest that there are enemys she probably has to fight as she also almost fought diamante. An dconsidering that it would have been shit writing if she had ignored her parents wishes and helpes kyros/fought alone. YOU are the one who has no reading comprehension and doesn't even read what he posts. <br>In other words, you didn't read the dozens of lines explaining everything about why Rebecca should have fought and about why it was wrong for her not to. You dismiss everything with just three "nothing suggests that", which is an invalid argument. You prove my point : you have no reading comprehension skills and doesn't read properly what other people post.</br></br></br></br>  <br> next arc Luffy will resolve things with Kaidou through diplomacy and a meeting around a table discussing politics and alliance and treaties. </br>  <br>I never saw anyone mention that anywhere but it's not that farfetched.</br>  <br>We should discuss Rebecca together, she's a very interesting character.<br><br> I’ve seen other posts too that express positivity for Rebecca, but I really think that Oda did an utterly terrible job with her. It’s not the I don’t like Rebecca–in the first half of the arc she was my favorite new character–but Oda just treated her so so so horribly. This is something I’ve written about before here, here, here, and here. In the first half of the arc I was crying over how much I loved Rebecca and Kyros’ relationship (see this post), and because they were set up so beautifully it made Oda’s ultimate treatment of Rebecca that much more disappointing.  <br><br><br>No. People can reply if they want to reply.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> explaining everything about why Rebecca should have fought and about why it was wrong for her not to <br> explaining <br>Nope that was retarded shit and wishful thinking with a pile of headcanon. Rebecca fighting seriously would have shitted on her whole character until then.<br><br> You prove my point : you have no reading comprehension skills and doesn't read properly what other people post. <br> I-if I write it often enough people will think that I have a point <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah damn I should have known that Rebeccafag is behind all this tumblr posting</br>  <br>You, you understand me.</br>  how many months until rebecca becomes a banned term  <br>when you stop tripfagging</br>  <br> Nope that was retarded shit and wishful thinking with a pile of headcanon. <br>In other words, you are dismissing everything she wrote with "it's retarded shit and wishful thinking".<br>Thank you for proving my point.<br><br> Kill yourself <br>The point has been explained by everything she wrote. On the other hand, you proved that you are trying to make a point without giving proper arguments.<br><br><br>You missed my second post, I implied I was this person.<br><br><br>When you stop insulting him every time he posts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JOHJ</br>  <br> giving her character some significance by fighting instead of crying for help and running away, and not shitting on the goals she set for herself at the beginning of the arc would have been shitting on her whole character <br>Oh okay then.<br><br><br>Pointless, it would just be replaced by Rbecca or something.</br></br></br></br></br>   My problem with the take that Rebecca should be lauded for “fulfilling her dream without breaking her principles” is that it makes it sound like she found a way to accomplish something while taking a more difficult route to honor her beliefs. <br> That is not the case at all, since Rebecca accomplished nothing of her own doing and TRIED to break her principles but only didn’t because she failed at every turn. She TRIED to fight Diamante. She TRIED to get the Mera Mera no Mi to KILL Doflamingo. She WANTED to protect her father like he protected her. <br> Did she do any of those things? No, because she failed at every single one. Rebecca didn’t decide not to hurt anyone. Rather, she didn’t WANT to hurt anyone because that’s what her mother taught her, but when she was afraid for Kyros’ (as the Toy Soldier) life she resolved to FIGHT and PROTECT him because protecting the one who raised her was more important to her than anything. <br> But instead of actually doing anything to help him, she failed when she tried and was only protected yet again by him. And then, after failing, everyone praised her for honoring her mother’s wishes even though she tried to go against them but was simply too incapable to do so. <br> Her honoring her parents’ wishes not to hurt people was the result of her failing everything she tried to do, not something she voluntarily accomplished herself.  <br><br><br>What do you think of that? Do you agree?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In other words, you are dismissing everything she wrote with "it's retarded shit and wishful thinking". <br>It literally is wishful thinking because she demands that Rebecca has to fight although Kyros the difference in strength between Diamante and Rebecca and Rebecca herself say otherwise. Therefore your whole blogpost is a pile of shit-tier headcanon.<br><br><br> giving her character some significance by fighting <br> I'm a marinefordbaby who wants to see everyone fighting, it doesn't matter if it makes any sense, hell why didn't Leo took on Doffy all alone to prove his point? <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Jesus the last thread was so good, rip.  <br>Why can't there be a character like that? In reality isnt it pretty realitic for a sixteen year old girl, who is a pacifist in nature, to act the way she does? We had a fifteen year old princess who was pretty fucking stong-willed and actively put herself in danger in alabasta, why cant there be a princess who's the opposite and shows fear? There are a lot of fucking characters in one piece, whats so bad about having multidimensional characters?<br><br>And, no Kyros didnt fucking force her to have pacifist ideals. If you've forgotten already, Rebecca was the one who said she didnt want to fight when Kyros was trying to teach her how to yield a sword to defend herself. I personally dont like Rebecca's or King Riku's characters because I hate their hyper-pacifist ideals, but shit, I'm not gonna sit here and change their characters just so they'd fit the idealistic characters I WANTED them to be.</br></br></br>  <br>Shhh, don't talk to me, just because I agree with everything that tumbrina said, it doesn't mean I have to get on board with your latest attempt at trolling/shitposting.</br>  <br>rebeccafag BTFO</br>  <br>I'm here for this.</br>  <br>recbecca fag the autistic tumblr landwhale ruins every one piece thread she posts in</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128525771 <br>kill yourself you retard, don't make more threads, I don't want mods to start deleting them fucking cancer</br>  <br>Everytime Rebeccafag appears the threads go to hell because there are inconvincible retards who keep responding to her shit</br>  <br>I guess doing it before doesn't do shit. People are still being idiots nonetheless.<br><br>FUCKING IGNORE REBECCAFAG.

I am sure they did something else on their time on the island</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It literally is wishful thinking because she demands that Rebecca has to fight although Kyros the difference in strength between Diamante and Rebecca and Rebecca herself say otherwise. Therefore your whole blogpost is a pile of shit-tier headcanon. <br>On top of mentioning only one of the many points she made, you are writing exactly what she contradicted. She criticized Oda for making Rebecca so weak, and she didn't write just one sentence like you did. You lack reading comprehension skills and should read properly everything she wrote.<br><br><br>This is for you<br> Oda has created a number of really amazing and fantastic women that I appreciate a great deal. I love Nami, Hancock, Vivi, and Robin, and the important and well created roles that they play in the story. However, then there are characters such as Rebecca and Tashigi, who I like a great deal but who I feel are treated very poorly in the story because they are made to be too weak to actually accomplish any of the things they try to do and instead are constantly failing and being protected by others. There are lots of things about the women in One Piece that are incredible, but there are also things that drop the ball. Whether it’s the lack of physical diversity (0 women with battle scars, 1 dark skinned woman, 1 woman with muscles), women often being mocked for being old or unattractive, women being outnumbered over 4 to 1 by men, or the lack of fighting that women get to do in the series. One Piece is far from a perfect series when it comes to it’s treatment and inclusion of women, even if we wish it was.  <br><br><br>If you agree with me then how can you say I am shitposting?<br><br><br>He isn't me.<br><br><br>What about you discuss properly instead of insulting? I am open to discussion.<br><br><br>It's because of you.<br><br><br>People can answer if they want to.<br><br><br>You got tired of reverse trolling and decided to reverse reverse troll by calling me a reversetroll.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They left the island before the Bird Cage happened.</br>  <br>out numbered 4 to 1 by men, so realistic to pirates and navy standards than?</br>  <br> it doesn't matter if making a female gladiator nicknamed the undefeated woman, who set up goals not to be saved and save the person important to her instead, fight, makes any sense <br>Well okay then.</br></br>  <br> You lack reading comprehension skills and should read properly everything she wrote. <br>And you still didn't posted anything "contradicting"<br> Kyros' wish <br> Diamante being 100 times strionger than Rebecca <br> Rebecca's personality <br>Hell there is nothing that contradicts these things. Making her fight would contradict them. Your blog post ist shit deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> undefeated woman <br> I completly ignore that she always dodged in the fights until her enemys were defeated on their own and create a headcanon-rebecca inside my mind who always slays her enemys cooler than Zoro does <br>Good for you</br></br></br>  <br><br>STOP REPLYING</br></br>  Disregard Rebeccafag, post cute pictures.  <br><br>Or fucking discuss the series like the last thread.<br><br>All the Void Century stuff, that was great.</br></br></br></br>  <br> muh diversity <br> muh stronk wimmin <br> muh muhsiodjinny <br>once again i am reminded why tumblr is such a fucking cancerous shithole</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but what if there is a legit reason Kyros had her never attack? She could easily be a weapon like Shirahoshi.</br>  <br> implying someone skilled enough to dodge isn't skilled enough to strike <br>You're retarded.</br></br>  <br>What void century stuff ?<br><br><br>Pffffft.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And you still didn't posted anything "contradicting" <br>So it's as I say, you lack reading comprehension skils.<br> Hell there is nothing that contradicts these things. Making her fight would contradict them. <br>You still hasn't understood any of the points she made.<br><br>By the way, thank you for replying to me even if you don't understand anything, at least you're proving that you're not an idiot ignoring people just because you don't agree with them.<br><br><br>People answer if they can.<br><br><br>What's wrong about that? Tell me why you don't like Rebecca and don't want appear to be strong.<br><br> Even if this change in tone is the case, I still feel hugely disappointed with what happened to Rebecca’s character. I can appreciate that Kyros didn’t want his daughter to fight because he knows what it is like to live with blood on your hands. Kyros did carry a massive amount of guilt for many things throughout his life and I can feel for him that not killing and not fighting is something he desires for his daughter. However, that doesn’t change that things only worked out that way because Rebecca failed everything she tried to do. She wanted to protect her father and she failed. She wanted to fight against Doflamingo and she failed. Against Diamante all she did was fail, run away, and beg to be saved, and despite her eventually getting some resolve back the story gave us no indication that she wouldn’t have just failed again if she tried to fight in the latest chapter. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please respond.</br>  <br>Kyros never tought her offensive techniques though, because Rebecca said herself she does not want to hurt others</br>    <br><br>Well there was discussion about the VC and Shanks and Buggy.<br><br>There was another about Mariejois being built on FI and consecutively the Tree Eve etc.<br><br>It was great, then this thread happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> filename <br> not rebecca01.jpg, rebecca96.jpg or rebecca101.jpg <br>You damn goofed, faker.</br></br></br>  <br> Not him but what if there is a legit reason Kyros had her never attack? She could easily be a weapon like Shirahoshi. <br>this headcanon is literally cringeworthy now.<br><br><br>No I implied that she does not WANT to fight you fucking retard. Making her fight on her own accord while estabilishing that she is not like that would literally destroy her character and make her a plot point. She wouldn't be a character anymore.<br><br><br> You still hasn't understood any of the points she made. <br>Nope you still proved nothing. I literally listed all the points against your theory here  and you continue with your "hurr durr you can't read"-meme instead of proving anything, therefore proving your autism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the point. Oda wanted to show how fathers have to be overprotective according to his patriarchical culture. Rebecca wanted to fight properly and tried to, but Oda refused to make that happen. He even gave her a harmless sword.<br><br><br>This is for you<br> What if Rebecca HAD fought against Diamante and HAD protected her father, but upon having the chance to kill him couldn’t do it and put down her sword because she she wanted to honor her mother’s memory and didn’t want to have blood on her hands. How fantastic would that be? Kyros would be able to feel deep appreciation for the woman his daughter has grown up to become and it would be a beautiful way to honor Rebecca’s promises of helping her father and still keep the theme of keeping her hands clean of blood. But instead Oda chose to trample all over Rebecca and have her only remain clean through a series of ugly failures where she broke every promise she made and accomplished nothing. There could have been so many ways to resolve this fight while keeping the same themes and not treating Rebecca like dirt. So while I can have appreciation for the idea of Kyros wanting Rebecca not to stain her hands, I have no respect for what Oda did to Rebecca’s character in order to make that happen. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No I implied that she does not WANT to fight you fucking retard <br>But she did, see </br></br>  <br> The fact you said probably shows it hilariously ambiguous to what they were doing <br>Its not <br>jesus christ</br></br></br>  <br> He even gave her a harmless sword <br> She chooses a sword that adds well to her personality and principles <br> Oda DESTROYED HER <br>Hang yourself<br><br><br> protect =/ fight and slay every possible enemy <br>Are you 12?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, it wasn't that good, didn't bring anything new to the table/that I didn't know at least.</br>  <br>keep crying that your fanfiction did not come true, it is amusing</br>  <br>i think it's because he was positive he was safe.<br><br>what happened to post-timeskip ussop? fucking running away from the tontattas was the biggest character regression ever</br></br></br>  <br> cancerous <br>why?</br></br>  <br> fucking running away from the tontattas was the biggest character regression ever <br>wasn't this because he forgot about Robin?</br></br>  <br><br>It was amazingly good compared to threads like this really. <br><br>Whether it is known or not, at least they were being discussed instead of this shite.</br></br></br></br>  <br> MORE DEEP <br>lewd</br></br>  <br>Yeah I don't know.

Hell, even reading One Piece alone should prevent you from writing shit like this. You're a fucking disgrace, hell, you're worse than Rebeccafag because at least this guy is only pretending to be retarded.</br></br>  <br>Read everything.

She wanted to defeat doffy when she forgot her father and wanted to JUST help the strawhats when she remembered her father.<br><br><br> a character should act in accordance with the goals he set for himself <br> FIFY. <br>Yeah she got her father back and knew that people would defeat Diamante and Doffy as Kyros and Luffy promised her.

He could have been Moria's rookie rival before joining WB.  do you think what franky said in the third panel had any effect on Sanji?  <br> I have to have the last word even if I say senseless retarded shit <br>Kill yourself, manchild.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Oda has created a number of really amazing and fantastic women that I appreciate a great deal. I love Nami, Hancock, Vivi, and Robin, and the important and well created roles that they play in the story. However, then there are characters such as Rebecca and Tashigi, who I like a great deal but who I feel are treated very poorly in the story because they are made to be too weak to actually accomplish any of the things they try to do and instead are constantly failing and being protected by others <br>And I'm saying why the fuck is this a bad thing. There are a lot of characters in one piece, like there are a lot of people in this world. Some are weak, some are strong. Some can fight for themselves and are strong-willed. Some cant, EVEN IF they're strong-willed. <br><br>You could say the same shit about male characters in OP. Oda made some fantastic male characters but also some shitty ones. Why the fuck did Oda make Zoro so badass but shit on Sanji's character? Why wasnt Law strong enough to fight his own battle? Why did Oda have to make it so that Luffy had to save him? Why are there so many typical pervy male characters in OP when there's other males that arent?<br><br>If you already acknowledge that there are strong female characters in OP then your problem is that you just dont like it when the opposite is shown to be able to exist in that world. Which seems ridiculous with the amount of characters OP has.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It could have also been crocodile. He honestly seems to be on most of their levels. Whitebeard commanders have been pretty disappointing.</br>  <br> Why wasnt Law strong enough to fight his own battle? Why did Oda have to make it so that Luffy had to save him? <br>U wot? Luffy was not strong enough to beat Doflamingo alone as well. Law would not have beaten Doffy without Luffy but the same is true the other way around.</br></br>  still_better_than_fate_threads.png  <br>the tumblr cunt won't listen to reason or logic.</br>  <br> talking and posting like a fat dyke <br><br>Those speaking patterns are too exact to be fake, a real landwhale cunt is here.</br></br></br>  <br> "Do you think she's weak?" <br> "Don't worry, she has strong guys with her" <br>top kek</br></br></br>  <br><br> 1 chapter every week </br></br>  <br>the irony is that both, chopper and brook are joke characters at this point and therefore jobber</br>  <br>Law had personal history with Doflamingo, is an extremely popular character, and has power of his own to rival Luffy.

He should be really strong after the timeskip, and not a furry moe blob. Oda should have given his editors the middle finger and made chopper's new horn point his main timeskip design.  <br>Chopper should just give momonosuke a rumble ball, eat one himself and then rekt as two zoan in monster point form Big Mom's ship, so that the rest can flee while sanji kicks sense into momonosuke after a while and also fuck off, but no Chopper'll remain a faggot.</br>  <br>can we just make a separate thread about the theories, the fags arguing over insignificant tumblerina details here are too much.</br>  <br>Fuck off back to tumblr, idiot.</br>  <br> can we just make a separate thread <br>Don't turn op into the second naruto</br></br>  <br>Ace 2.1416?<br><br> Natsu Uchiha <br><br> The King <br><br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We have no idea how smile zoans work<br><br>they are already unknown side effects.

You are apparently like this all the time, so I am sorry for you, but it confirms that you are underage. You using buzzwords without even looking for their definitions (you even thought calling someone a reversetroll meant calling oneself a troll) is enough to prove that you aren't even willing to use proper arguments.

Oda being all pretentious about "Give a damn about Sabo! He's only the OTHER brother of Luffy who was never referenced to ever have existed on the spot after Ace was killed and had amnesia FEEL SORRY FOR HIM!!"<br><br>That makes Sabo a bag of shit for a character. Him inheriting Ace's powers also doesn't do him favors in being Ace Lite.</br></br></br>  <br>ok.</br>  <br>Even worse is people pretending he isn't some pseudo ace replacement.</br>  yfw Sabo and Shanks will die just like how Ace and Whitebeard die because Luffy's brother dies with a Yonko, always.  <br> cancerous <br>Certainly the most unneeded.</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, you're almost as annoying as the Rebeccafag. If people like his character and inclusion than so be it. I'm not pretending shit, I can acknowledge he's a replacement for Ace as Luffy's brother, but fuck off if you think people need to agree with you that he's a carbon copy of Ace's character.</br>  <br>The only thing getting mad over is how Baby 5 got White Knight Faggoted by Echiro Faggot Oda. He can't stand seeing a beautiful woman seriously get crushed and brutally defeated. So he had her turn good and be a waifu (is it any different from what he did with Boa Hancock?).<br><br>Anyone else despise Oda's Traditionalist views on life that reflect in his work? It makes one wonder. Has he ever in his life SUFFERED at the hands of women? Like say get falsely accused of rape which destroys his image? Or maybe he'll get falsely accused of domestic violence. Because the man sounds like a simp or if not that too ignorant of female nature to the point he puts pussy on the pedestal.</br></br></br>  <br>See you in a few years when Sabo becomes relevant. I love how people seem to think this is the last time we're gonna see Sabo and that Oda had no reason for keeping him alive.</br>  <br>Then I am not talking about you. I don't care if you like sabo. stop being defensive. I just hate people we have in this very thread trying to convince themselves he wasn't cooked up to replace Ace.<br><br>Diminishes Ace's death by quite a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, women are useless for anything but sex and being cute so who cares?</br>  <br> Diminishes Ace's death by quite a bit. <br>I never felt like this is the case even once</br></br>  <br> Not wanting to fuck up or beat on his female characters <br> Suggesting he got traumatized by women so he's getting back at them. <br>Shouldnt it be the opposite?<br><br>And we have an MC that gives no fucks about punching pretty girls in the face (Vivi back in alabasta). And he explained Baby 5's obsession with men as a fucking mental defect. I'm pretty sure he doesnt think women wanting to devote their lives to men like her should be a norm.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot your redpill home, please do go retrieve it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128529660 <br> ^_^ <br>when will you finally kill yourself?</br></br>  <br>No you go back to (name of generally disliked community) for (disagreeing with my opinion)</br>  <br>You know it's true.</br>  <br> Diminishes Ace's death by quite a bit <br>Definitely not for me. And not for Luffy either. Just because Sabo is alive that doesnt change the fact that Ace is dead and Luffy was there to witness it.</br></br>  For someone who has never seen the movies what's the best way to watch them?<br>Just go sequentially? Are there any I should not bother watching?</br>  <br>Go watch the 4, 6, 10 and 12.</br>  <br>Anything besides Baron Omatsuri, Strong World and Z is shit and worse than any filler.</br>  <br>Even if you think it doesn't diminish it for luffy and his growth you have to admit it sucks that whenever a popular character dies, it could easily be remedied with another character to replace him.<br><br>Luffy now has an older brother with the fire fruit for the fangirls again. It would be like if Kubo killed off hitsugaya then introduced another shota with the ability to control ice and people go "what...? he definitely isn't a hitsugaya clone!!"<br><br>Cmon man<br><br>I don't know if it was Oda or the editor but I could have went without Sabo.<br><br>Or if you are going to introduce Sabo don't have him eat the mera mera.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy punching Vivi was so many years ago and such a glitch in the system that it counts for nothing. After that Oda made sure he would NEVER put Luffy in a situation where he will land a punch on a pretty twat.<br><br>But let's talk Oda. As a man he's obviously a chivalry douchebag. He sounds like the kind of man who if he got his wallet's ass raped in divorce court he would be happy and consider it a blessing that he was fleeced. Many men around Oda's age aren't exactly seeing pussy with rose tinted glasses. Yet his behavior is off for a man from his gen.</br></br></br>  <br>More like the opinion of an autistic virgin manchild who wants to fit in on /a/.</br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br>only the 6th movie is worth watching, skip the rest.</br>  <br> t would be like if Kubo killed off hitsugaya then introduced another shota with the ability to control ice and people go "what...? he definitely isn't a hitsugaya clone!!" <br>This isnt a good comparison cause you're completely ignoring the characters' relationships. Sabo inheriting Ace's fruit is symbolic in nature. He ISNT just some random shota or guy that came in was introduced with the same power. If you cant see the difference, then I dont know what to tell you.</br></br>  <br>I don't even remember which ones I saw, but Z, Strong World, 3D2Y, and the alabasta one were pretty good. Could there be more though</br>  <br> But let's talk Oda <br>no, you seem obsessed and autistic.</br></br>  <br>The symbolism is even worse. Luffy was supposed to be losing his older brother. That's what was supposed to be what caused him to grow up and realize he can't just run head on into the new world and everything will be okay. There will be consequences. He lost his older brother.<br><br>But now everything is A-okay he now has an older brother again. One that was never mentioned before in 500 chapters.</br></br></br>  <br> That's what was supposed to be what caused him to grow up and realize he can't just run head on into the new world and everything will be okay. <br>yeah and that is why he told everyone to wait 2 years, Sabos introduction did not change shit about Luffys growth</br></br>  <br>i thought he had lost them both, which was worse. He got 1 brother back after he overcame his issues</br>  <br> That's what was supposed to be what caused him to grow up and realize he can't just run head on into the new world and everything will be okay. <br>That's what Sabaody Archipelago was for.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off tripfag, you can't even understand what's going on in a kid's book</br>  <br> He can't stand seeing a beautiful woman seriously get crushed and brutally defeated. <br><br>Literally "I am not even reading this manga!"- The post<br><br>Who is Robin? (vs Croc and Enel)<br>Who is Monet? (vs Zoro)<br>Who is Tashigi? (vs Vergo)<br>Who is Baby fucking 5 (against Franky)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Look through thread <br> An actual fucking tumblrina posting <br> Wah wah, why isn't Rebecca strong <br> Wah wah, why do you want to appreciate men, what about THE WOMEN? </br></br></br>  <br> Luffy punching Vivi was so many years ago and such a glitch in the system that it counts for nothing. <br>This is every SJW's argument. Counter-examples? Doesnt count because of reasons hur durr <br><br>We've seen Vivi, Nami, Kalifa, Ms Doublefinger, Bonney etc get fucked up pretty bad. Luffy punching Vivi wasnt the only example of violence towards women. I was just stating that Luffy, our main protagonist, gives no fucks when it comes to fighting men or women. That's his character and I've seen no change in that. It's not a glitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br> One that was never mentioned before in 500 chapters. <br>It's funny that people keep harping on this when the exact same thing happened for Ace and Garp.</br></br>  <br> But now everything is A-okay he now has an older brother again <br>Nice projecting tripfag</br></br>  <br>Garp was shown in chapter 91 and Ace in 154<br><br>not nearly the same.</br></br></br>  <br>you have no reason to be trip fagging. please refrain from doing this. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YgH<wbr>NtzxO0y8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>My older brother was a tripfag and he died. I saw his death in a blog and it reminded me of who I was.</br>  <br> That's his character and I've seen no change in that. It's not a glitch. <br>But what about Zoro?He didn't and claims he doesn't give a fuck who his opponent is or how strong they are and yet he didn't kill Monet for whatever reason.</br></br>  <br><br>Seriously, are you that fucking retarded?</br></br>  <br>because she was too weak in his eyes not because she was a women.</br>  <br>He also went on a "Bawww Enel how could you hurt a woman!" Mind you this was back when Zoro suspected Robin of being an enemy directly after Alabasta.</br>  <br><br><br> baron omatsuri and the secret island <br><br>What's up with that animation? That doesn't look like one piece at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about him? I'm talking about Luffy not Zoro.</br>  <br>It really fits the movie though.<br><br>Summer feel allover it.<br><br>God, I think I'll rewatch it just right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the point. It has a very good plot (not even baiting, I swear) and this unique artstyle making it a 9/10 one piece movie.</br>  <br> because she was too weak in his eyes not because she was a women. </br>  <br> this <br> a woman <br>please</br></br></br>  <br><br>Alright. I'll trust you guys</br></br>  <br><br>An attention-whoring faggot like your older dead brother?</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>There we go.</br>  <br><br>Law.<br><br>He's a good character, but fuck am i sick of him now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, thats fucking Law.</br>  Who's the top 5 strongest non fruit users?  <br>hating Law is a shitty meme you know that?</br>  <br>That's the best OP movie right here, anon.</br>  <br>She even has a totally functional uterus, you dipshit.</br>  <br>Rayleigh<br>Shanks<br>Garp?<br>Mihawk<br><br><br>coming up with a 5th is hard because people like kong or or those members of the gorosei can always have a fruit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jinbe?</br>  <br>hey asshole<br>can you please stop posting<br>thanks</br></br></br>  <br>Was the case where he used the back of his blades in Water 7 different? I can't remember and I'm too lazy with too shitty internet to check.</br>  How strong is this guy? Will he ever get an actual fight? I'll be pretty disappointed if he jobs now considering he was stronger than any of the crew pre timeskip and he's been promoted since.  <br>Jinbe seems hard to put on the list because surely there are people stronger than him. I would think he is on the zoro/luffy tier and there are yonkou first mates and such that should beat him.</br>  <br>I forgot all about sentoumaru. I would definitely think he makes the list before Jinbe.<br><br>Having the strongest CoA is no joke. The marines and government would definitely want to protect their golden goose in Vegapunk with the best they have.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know.Is it different killing innocent civilian and different killing pirates?I can't tell</br>   tripfag appears <br> thread slows done <br>Who would have guessed it<br><br>Also I never saw (๑ .̫ ๑) and Rebeccafag at the sametime, what could that mean..</br></br></br></br>  <br>If retards would just learn to not respond to both of these cancerous pieces of shit this world would be a better place</br>  <br>Timeskip was in 2010, 5 years actually</br>  <br>What are you arguing here? This does nothing to counter the fact that Zoro's reasoning for not going all out on Monet was because she was too weak? It's kinda like how Mihawk initially used a tiny knife on Zoro their first fight before he knew of Zoro's convictions. Zoro was prepared to die than lose, and that's what impressed Mihawk into using his black sword to give Zoro a respectful finishing attack. Monet showed fear of death to the end, which is why Zoro probably didnt think she was worth any respect in regards of fighting. <br><br>If anything, it just shows that Mihawk's attitude towards fighting probably influenced Zoro during the two years of training. Characters can change and develop, yeah. But regardless, this has nothing to do with Luffy punching girls?</br></br></br>  <br> b-but oda's gags give you all the personality you need! Sanji's nosebleeds lol! Zoro gets lost :^) </br>  <br>oh look, it's the winegum winegum no mi</br>  <br>half the things there arent even talking about gags. do you speedread even in 4chan threads?</br>  <br> If anything, it just shows that Mihawk's attitude towards fighting probably influenced Zoro during the two years of training. Characters can change and develop, yeah. But regardless, this has nothing to do with Luffy punching girls? <br><br><br> zoro fights with 3 tiny blades when going against shitty opponents </br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, just ignore everything else and make an ironic shitpost<br>epic</br></br>  <br>Yeah they would eventually leave when no one bothers to feed them but some people just can't control themselves. Who am I kidding though, if everyone stopped replying to them they'd probably reply to themselves to start a shitstorm, literal and utter cancer.</br>  Was sentoumaru being literal when he said he had the best defense (CoA) in the world? Makes you wonder who could actually beat that.  <br>GOAT One Piece movie. I wish the series was more like it.</br>  <br> I didn't understand anything I read <br> I'll just shitpost instead </br></br>  <br> replying to tripfags when we just agreed not to </br>  <br>Oh god I hope not. I only thought he encompassed the marines (which might or might not include higher ups like fleet admirals and on). Fucker has more fat cells to imbue with khaki, hence thicker defensive "wall".</br>  <br>yeah I guess it makes sense if he was talking navy terms only which is still pretty impressive if that includes Garp.</br>  <br>nah it was way too edgy</br>  Why is Smoker so weak post-timeskip? I thought he was supposed to be the Garp to Luffy's Roger. Coby certainly isn't cut out for that.  Hopefully Vegapunk will buff him somehow .  <br>Time-Skipped Coby honestly seems stronger than Time-Skipped Smosan going on what we've seen.</br>  <br>nah, it did not feel much like One Piece even though it was a good movie</br>  <br>He's a jobber now. You can make the argument that he always has been, but it's clear that he's Sanji-tier now</br>  <br>The problem was he completely relied on his devil fruit for dealing with people in the grandline. <br><br>It's too hard to get over that now even though he picked up haki people like vergo had to use haki almost his entire life. <br><br>Think about Ace. His mera mera is wayyyyyyy better than smoker's but even he got caught up with using his devil fruit and seemed to neglect haki and basic martial arts.<br><br>The marines have an amazing system of martials arts smoker should have been focusing on but he seemed to still be trying to use his smoke fruit with only the basics.<br><br><br>Instead he should master Rokushiki and use his smoke body intangibility as a supplementary to it. The offensive ability of it seems to be limited so utilize it defensively and for utility purposes while becoming a better hand 2 hand fighter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    we've only seen 3 islands in 200 chapters <br>  pacing has been the slowest ever <br>  lot of chapters are filler and boring <br>  Fishman island was meh <br>  Punk Hazard was meh <br>  If it wasn't for Doflamingo Dressrosa would be a big pile of shit arc <br>  Oda created Rebecca the worst character seen in the manga <br>  the crew is has been reduced to gag characters and they barely get screentime anymore <br><br>there are people out there ignoring all that stuff and pretend that One Piece is as good as ever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're going to get shit on, but you're right</br>  <br>I think his weakness might have been over exaggerated. While he did fuck up with law, I feel that their gap wasn't that much (even a stronger opponent can lose to a weaker one if they don't vary too much in strength; e.g. luffy and lucci). Now, throughout PH Smoker had to job with Vergo to get law's heart. So by the time he faced Doffy he was already weak and in no condition to fight. Plus, Doffy is more than a little stronger than Smoker. Even Luffy+Law had to put in significant effort to take him out.<br><br>Tldr smoker was weakened from jobbing.</br></br></br>  <br>It's mostly the arlong park kids who are here for some reason. They can't handle any critiques on One piece.</br>  <br>just drop this manga already</br>  <br>I need to see if it goes the way of Gantz or it improves.</br>  <br>I give you Rebecca, the rest is your opinion, nothing more nothing less</br>  <br>God forbid man.<br>There's no way it will. But still sad just think about it.</br></br>  <br>No you don't, you keep reading something you do not enjoy anymore and all it brings is you constantly coming back after every chapter to whine and bitch about how shit it supposedly has become.</br>  <br><br> implying Marineford wasn't the greatest arc in any manga series since Chapter Black </br></br>  <br>Why is everything an extreme here? It moves across the continuum like anything else</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Wasnt even the best arc in this manga. <br><br>Marineford took place too early. All of the top name combatants outside of whitebeard and the admirals were only able to show snippets of their power as not to spoil things. Look at the stuff law and Doflamingo and luffy has done post timeskip. People should have been doing that all over the place in Marineford.</br></br></br>  Nightly reminder that Law a slut. <br><br><br>I really hope he'll make a comeback and stay relevant until the end of the series.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sentomaru was stronger than luffy pre timeskip because of haki, now i think he is no match for him. Pretty sure he is somekind like vice-admiral level, but for sure not stronger than luffy.</br></br>  <br> story and character development is bad <br><br>I bet you're one of those fags who likes fairy tail because he doesn't have to read and can just look at pretty pictures</br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!<br><br>Sabo isn't that bad...I like that he's kind of crazy beneath the surface.</br></br>  <br> we've only seen 3 islands in 200 chapters <br>so what?<br> pacing has been the slowest ever <br>Because Dressrosa is the longest arc yet? Length does not equal slow pacing.<br> lot of chapters are filler and boring <br>show me the filler chapters you speak of please<br> Fishman island was meh <br>it was average but not boring for me<br> Punk Hazard was meh <br>a lot better than FI <br> If it wasn't for Doflamingo Dressrosa would be a big pile of shit arc <br>bullshit, it has a lot of great moments and characters besides Doflamingo, what drags it down from great to "only" good is that there are too many characters and plot threads so it feels jumpy at some parts<br> Oda created Rebecca the worst character seen in the manga <br>I don't hate this character but she really should not exist, Viola alone would have been enough and I really don't know why Oda felt the need to introduce another whiny pink haired pacifist princess character after Shirahoshi only 1 arc later<br> the crew is has been reduced to gag characters and they barely get screentime anymore <br>huh? every SH still played a role and did something besides in FI and PH and that is true as well for at least half the crew in Dressrosa. Are you even sure you know what a true gag character is? And did you complain like this as well when the whole story focused solely on Luffy alone after Sabaody for over 2 years?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> people disagree with my opinion <br> they must be from some other place with bad reputation on /a/ <br>fuck off with your childish boogeyman bullshit</br></br></br>  <br> I don't hate this character but she really should not exist, Viola alone would have been enough and I really don't know why Oda felt the need to introduce another whiny pink haired pacifist princess character after Shirahoshi only 1 arc later <br><br>And Shirahoshi is worse than Vivi. Remember Shirahoshi has a more annoying voice than Vivi. Her personality is to be crybaby. But being a giantess means she's LOUDER. And she activates her super power BY crying and whining.<br><br>Such a shitty character. Oda thinks that giving a female character tits is enough to excuse everything, but that fucker doesn't understand that even if a cunt is easy on the eyes it doesn't mean the audience wants to deal with so much of her bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Remember Shirahoshi has a more annoying voice than Vivi. <br> voice <br>animefag please go</br></br></br>  <br> more annoying voice than vivi <br><br>what are you talking about?</br></br></br>  How come we don't have any women admirals? Fishman island was all about diversity and equality and luffy likes diversity in his crews and enemies so why no women admiral. After the dressrosa arc with rebecca and oda saying mom is the opposite of adventure I'm starting to believe he's a misogynist. Just like kishimoto  Can't tell who is worse between Rebecca and Shirahoshi  <br>Shirahoshi at least did something of relevance, in fact she saved everyones asses at the end of the arc. And she even is a character that I actually am looking forward to see again since she will play a big role later in the story and I am expecting her to be badass after being trained by  Shanks  or whoever it is. Can't say the same about Vivi to be honest.</br>  <br>why do you sound like a kid</br>  <br> wasn't the best arc in this manga <br> wasn't your favorite arc in this manga <br>ftfy there's no such thing as best but you have to be delusional to think MF wasn't the most popular.</br></br></br>  <br>it pretty obvious actually</br>  <br>Rebecca, by far. Shirahoshi is cute, she got that going for her.</br>   DONT RESPOND TO THE SHITPOST <br> DONT RESPOND TO THE SHITPOST <br> DONT RESPOND TO THE SHITPOST </br></br>  <br>why do you have no arguments?</br>  <br>You expect women to be unrealistically competent and badass and behave in ways that are the opposite of what women are like? Oh geez.</br>  <br>It's a story for 12 year old boys. Who cares about diversity</br>  <br>Rebecca attracts more shitposters so her.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #2<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>  <br>Requesting Kukaku Shiba dressed as Frank Sinatra singing into an old 50's microphone.<br>Or anything is fine.<br>Thanks and have a nice weekend!</br></br></br>  Requesting my lovely bassist, Akiyama Mio.<br><br>I'd like to see her in a cute sundress being happy.<br>If possible, having fun at the amusement park, with cotton candy in her hand.<br><br>Thank you if you consider, and have a nice week-end.</br></br></br></br></br>    Requesting Hakodate Omiko trying to deal with the Summer heat, or dressed as a pirate.

Maybe a Daigusto Emeral reprint  that TCG won't get ? One can hope.</br></br></br>  <br>So after this we'll get a fusion Booster Special, RIGHT?<br>I need my Moonlights and Ancient Gears damnit</br></br>  <br>No, but this is how I feel when I play the game.</br>  <br>The third is Xyz Blackwings.</br>  <br> not an AK to mow down waves of Fusion scum </br>  <br>The third will probably be an OCG original theme, just like Psyframes in the Synchro booster</br>  <br>Yeah, he said Raidraptors.</br>    <br>I don't know why people are excited about this. TCG won't get it for a year afterwards, if we ever get it.<br><br>I feel I should remind people that there are cards coming out NEXT WEEK in TCG that require cards from a pack from a year ago that we STILL don't have.</br></br></br>  <br>Well we're finally getting an Emergency Teleport in our version of Highspeed Riders.<br><br>It's probably going to be Secret or Ultra again, but a man can dream.</br></br></br>  <br> TCG won't get it for a year afterwards, if we ever get it. <br>The Synchro Booster SP is getting released in the TCG 3 months later</br></br>    <br> I feel I should remind people that there are cards coming out NEXT WEEK in TCG that require cards from a pack from a year ago that we STILL don't have. <br>What's up with that? Like for what reason would there be such a delay?</br></br>  <br>This is why most people just use DN/YGP/etc..</br>  <br>D/D/D isn't exactly the most exciting archetype for most people so they really don't care. Shame too, the Star Pack would've been the perfect time to release them.</br>  <br>Will Yuya ever get a Duelist Pack? This is unprecedented, by this point in time Judai and Yusei had 2 duelist packs, Yuma had 1 and Kaito had another.<br>We got a Duelist Pack, but it was of Battle City</br></br>  <br>Not everyone here plays TCG.</br>  <br>Considering how far behind they are on the anime cards, probably not.</br>  <br>Duelist Pack Kamishiro was more important to put into CROS than Raging Masters, evidently.<br><br>I'm personally of the opinion that they could've slipped it into SECE or WSUP, or even Dragons of Legend 2 (I mean, they already had Aquaactress and Sybils in there).<br><br>I'm hoping that they decide to use some of the CORE TCG slots for the D/D/D cards we're missing, but I won't hold my breath for that because Horakty knows that Kosmoz self-wanking is more important than actually getting playable cards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They've never used TCG Exclusive slots for OCG imports, and they're not going to start now.</br>   5D's had 3 Yusei Duelist pack and a Crow Duelist pack <br> No KINGU pack <br>Well to be honest Jack Atlas pack would have been fucking terrible</br></br>  <br>Why is she so fuckable?</br>  <br>KoA does things based on how the cards will sell, as opposed to anything actually logical. Just look at the way the banlists are.</br>  <br>Because all the Ruris are.</br>  <br>Dammit, Konami. I can't justify spending money on cardboard if you keep holding out on me.</br>  <br>We'll keep doing it.</br>  BELIEVE BELIEVE<br>EVERYBODY GODWIN</br>  <br>Xyz Minerva a qt.</br>  <br> KoA does things based on how the cards will sell, as opposed to anything actually logical. <br>Except sometimes the things they do are counter-productive to selling more</br></br>  <br> OCG Exclusive that everyone in OCGland likely has a copy or two of <br> TCG hands it out as an event-exclusive that maybe a few thousand people (if that) will get. <br>Fucking hell, TCG.</br></br></br>  <br>Like if they printed Force Strix in TCG, people would play Raid Raptors, maybe not at a competitive level, but as a pet deck.</br>  <br>DEULING<br><br>WHILE<br><br> ┗(彡⑧^_)┓三 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention that Force Strix can also search many Blackwings, so that helps that brain-blendingly-popular petdeck get even more of an updraft.</br>  <br>Or how they still haven't reprinted Blood Mephist or Number 106.<br>And they still haven't errata'd CED and DMOC</br></br>  <br>Thank Number 100, I was afraid Shun and Dennis' cards would clog up the main booster</br>  <br>Once separated by dimensions and now so close together under the same roof, but unable to see each other I can't imagine how they feel.<br><br>If this was Shun &amp; Ruri instead, Imouto Man would have already Rise Falcon'd the door and began demolishing each of the rooms one by one until he found her.</br></br></br>  <br>In case you haven't noticed, they already have. This is likely going to have one or two new archetypes.</br>  <br>As a side note for the uninformed, Number 106 is currently an ~$850 card.<br><br>You can buy an old car for the price you'd pay for one piece of cardboard.  Although MtG players will likely be familiar with the Black Lotus, which is leagues above that in "ridiculously priced cardboard" <br><br>Konami could literally put that in a pile of shit and it would probably still fly off shelves. Hell, KoA could've put a 106 in the Noble Knight Box Set and moves hundreds (if not thousands) more units than they did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the Noble Knight Box Set <br>That was one of the dumbest ideas KoA ever had. How much did it sell? Because the guy at my LCS said he only managed to sell 3, the rest have just been sitting there on a shelf for months</br></br>  <br>Would've sold a lot better if it weren't just a bunch of one-ofs and was actually the best you can build of a Noble Knight deck (extra deck aside) right out of the box.</br>  <br>Cyber Stein used to be even worse, it could get up to $5k.</br>  <br>That's because there were only 8 copies of it.</br>  <br>I live in a college town where many people have more money than they care for, and my local card shop ended up selling more singles of the staples than actual box sets. Merlin and the other exclusive to that set are still selling decently, but barely anybody ever expressed interest in buying the whole thing. KoA didn't seem to realize that most people actually interested in Noble Knights already HAD most of the cards to make the deck, meaning that they were basically spending $50 for some sleeves, a mat, and the two exclusives. While Platinum Rare is pretty amazing to look at, it's not worth spending $50 to get an entire deck you already have most of converted to a uniform rarity, even if it looks great.<br><br>Also, only putting 1 copy of each exclusive in the box set was utterly retarded, not to mention the deck itself's not even that great, even by NK standards.</br></br></br>  <br>This, it should have just been a TCG exclusive structure deck</br>  <br>To be fair, Shueisha/Shonen Jump Alpha have dibs on all promo cards and even if they don't release them Konami can't print them until they say so</br>  <br>That's the point though, Konami likes to make asinine limits to random ass cards and then try to give those away. Just look at Minerva where only a handful of people are going to actually get the card in the TCG.</br>  Is the Manzai out yet?  Is MonoSubs kill?  <br>Nah, just EVO'd out. Subs should be up today sometime.</br>  Will we ever see him again, /a/?  <br>He went to Synchro and became a member of Security</br>    Can't wait for more Assailt Blackwings<br>Just take all my money Konami</br>  <br>Trips confirmed<br>Just what is it about this picture?<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/119999<wbr>448/#120000000</wbr></br></br></br>    What is tuning magician effect?<br><br>Why did jack has such girly card in his fiend deck?</br></br>  <br>Probably something like.<br><br> This card is unaffected by cards and effects. When this card is summoned to the field, treat it as a tuner and non-tuner monster of any levels, and special summon one Synchro and Xyz monster from your extra deck. When this effect activates; your opponent discards their graveyard, hand, and all cards on the field and takes 2000 Life Points of damage. This card once in the graveyard or banished grants 3000 Attack to all monsters on your side of the field. <br><br>I don't know, maybe it's not power creeped enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sam is a typical scrub assuming a monster is shit because it has low base stats, it's probably a Tuner. Level 1 Tuners are amazing.</br>  <br>We need an updated version of this that's just Sora, Sawatari, Shun, Judai, and Serena arguing like in these threads.</br>  <br>Don't forget Yugo and Yuya fighting over Yuzu.</br>  <br> If this was Shun &amp; Ruri instead, Imouto Man would have already Rise Falcon'd the door and began demolishing each of the rooms one by one until he found her. <br><br>I hope he does that when they reach Academia.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember saying Academia was mostly going to be Shun running through the halls disrupting class shouting Ruri constantly.</br>  <br> bursts into Rin's room while she is changing <br> he blindly assumes she is Ruri <br> he rushes towards her to hug her <br> he gets slapped by her and sent flying </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Shun ends up finding all the Ruris before Ruri and gets into shenanigans <br><br>I want these two scenarios so bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> he'll be carded before Academia </br></br></br>  <br>I just want Rin to fuse in front of him to complete the cycle.</br>  <br/>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o1G<wbr>8xdHC48E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>So, I heard you like Avengers</br></br>  <br>Looks like the cool kids are having fun as usual.</br>  Daily reminder  <br>AUTO PIRRROTO: STANBY !!!</br>  <br><br>whats with Isao and gets?</br></br>  <br>FORCE STRIX PLEASE !!!!!!!!!</br>  <br>What's 顔芸?</br>  <br>Please let this be their oppurtunity to finally finish the Numbers. There are freaking 19 of them that aren't released or made and 1 of those actually has a name. All Zexal products are freaking over with, the hell is there problem?</br>  <br> wing raiders <br>It's going to be raidraptors,phantom knights and some other xyz dimension duelist. Alternatively it's a pack for fusion dimension Duelists.</br></br>  <br>It took Konami until later last year to print the very last of the Blackwing support...and here we are with Assault Blackwings just a few months later. 5Ds has been over for ages and we only JUST last year managed to get the last of an archetype printed in full.<br><br>The last of the Numbers (including Numeron Dragon) will be in the inevitable Legendary Collection ZeXal, mark my words.</br></br></br>  <br>And they still missed a couple of Blackwing cards</br>  <br>What if the third one is Ruri ?</br>  Well this is a new pairing for me.  <br>There were a lot of people that theorized that Shun was Kotori's kid, due to their similar hair colors and shared bird theme.</br>  <br>It still could be possible. We haven't seen Shun's parents at all.</br>  <br> he has yuma's spikes too <br>It's not that bad of a theory.</br></br>  So the edgelord lost against Reiji offscreen?, because we see him doing watever reiji wants after this.  <br>No Reiji said he was Leo's enemy and that was enough for Shun, chances are though he knows he'd lose against Reiji or he wouldn't be so subservient.</br>  <br>probably, it'd be weird if Yuuya doesn't duel him again and make him egao after he grows as a person</br>  <br><br>Im surprised you understood my point even if i forgot the picture.</br></br>  fuck enteme dueling wheres edgy yuya  <br>There is no way a duelist shitter like Kotori gave birth to him. <br><br>Rio on the other hand would make more sense.</br></br></br>  <br>They probably just wrote it in that Kotori eventually got gud offscreen as an apology and/or reference to her VA.</br>  <br>Duelist?</br>  <br>Shitter is probably the worst word associated with YGO ever and NTR is associated with it at times.</br>  why is yuya so cute  <br>What's the matter? Did the older boys at your locals call you that when you went there with your ojama deck?</br>  <br>No, it's just a dumb word for people who don't want to articulate why the person is bad for using X deck and just assumes anyone not using Nekroz or Shaddolls is a bad player, or in the extreme case, anyone but themselves. Also did you just shittalk Ojamas, they may be a bad and cheap deck, but Ojamas are great. Manjoume would be so disappointed in you.</br>  <br>Are you mad because someone called your waifu a shiiter?</br>  Who /xyz/ here?, i just uploaded some epic duel against a fusion scrub.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/K-qLR-uGLWQ  [ ]</br></br>  <br>You're trying to hard there /dng/, at least make a sound argument as to why people are bad. Also I agree, Kotori is a bad duelist, but I don't need to use meme words to get that point across.</br>  <br> Who /xyz/ here? <br><br>Anybody that actually wants to win, because it's become a win condition as opposed to a bonus.</br></br></br>  <br> Kotori <br> duelist </br></br>  <br><br><br>Shadolls and nekroz dont use it quite much.</br></br></br>  <br>I've never been to /dng/ a day in my life so let's get that out of the way first<br><br>You just seem very upset</br></br></br>  <br>Kotori isn't a duelist. She's a pair of thighs that got a duel once. Under mind control.</br>  <br>Of course they don't. Lavalval Chain is banned.</br>  <br> meme words <br><br>What? Shitter is a meme now?</br></br></br>  <br>No, but they did when Lavalval Chain was a thing, and they still have to resort to it if things start going wrong in order to win.</br>  <br>Cutest protagonist yet, no contest.</br>  <br> Nekroz don't Xyz <br> Nekroz don't Xyz <br>Even excluding Chain, Nekroz still have very easy access to the R4 Toolbox.

Think again.<br><br>How long until Crow upstages Yuzu and becomes the focus of the show?</br></br>  <br>I know this is a little late but:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pqZ<wbr>7UBF6ZbY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>We still have to wait for him to upstage a slice of bread in Arc-V</br>  <br>Way I figure it, you can't on a motorcycle without possibly killing yourself or inventing good autopilot.<br><br>You could do it in a car by calling your buddy on a cell phone and putting the duel on Speakerphone, but that seems like a lot more trouble than it's worth, honestly.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not happening you dumb nigger. It hasn't even STARTED to happen in Arc-V. This is the same as the people that think Yoshida is just going to walk in and take over the show.</br>  <br> try to do like Jack and ride my bike while facing backwards <br> ends up without legs <br><br>fucking konami</br></br></br></br>  <br> try to having Riding Duel on the freeway <br> cops show up <br> challenge them to a Battle Royal <br> they lay out a spike strip and put me in jail for 72 hours </br></br></br></br>  <br>Report and ignore m8. The less dumbasses in here, the better.</br>  <br>There is no way Crow is losing to Gongenzaka. And here's hoping that round 2 starts off with Crow vs Shun.</br>  <br> there aren't crazy old men telling you about spooky dragons in jail <br> nobody even duels </br></br>  <br>That's nothing worth reporting over. That's just being a huge baby at that point.</br>  <br>Google has these things called driverless cars now so call your opponent with the speakers, bring out your duel disk, and have fun</br>  <br>Difference being that Yoshida did that in 5Ds once already, making it seem like a realistic possibility. That said, it doesn't seem likely that we're in for a repeat incident.<br><br>Crow seems pretty damn innocent and generally tolerable. Jack's dynamic with Yuya could be absolutely fantastic when it finally pans out, and we've already seen that Yuya's starting more character development in that direction. Not to mention that Jack and Crow are both pretty damn in-character to their original 5Ds versions, meaning that nothing feels forced and everything more or less feels natural.<br><br>Now if they could do that shit with Shingo, we'll be set. I want that whiny bastard to stop calling for daddy for no reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least there isn't a dude throwing boogers at you</br>  I bet the Crow vs. Gongenzaka duel is gonna go like this:<br> I just synchro summoned my strongest monster with 3800 defense! <br> lolwedgecounter </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128520537 <br> 2015 <br> Not posting lewd pictures of best girl </br></br>  <br>Yeah, this is a pretty bad matchup for THE MAN, but we know he's revealing a new Synchro, so based solely on that fact and the fact that Crow seems to be using Sudden Shower again, it looks like Gorgonzola's in it to win it.</br>  where does yuya get all these new cards  <br> Best ZeXal Girl <br> Didn't post III or Anna. <br> Didn't even post Droite or Rio. <br> Posted fucking Kotori. <br><br>Even the fucking flower arrangement girl was a better character than Kotori.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Yoshida ISN'T a realistic possibility because Kamishiro hasn't shown a single sign of wanting to leave, and in fact seems like he wants as much control over the flow of the show as possible considering how many episodes he does himself. Yoshida's just a fucking boogeyman now, despite how bad he can be.</br>  <br> making it SEEM like a realistic possibility. <br> it doesn't seem likely that we're in for a repeat incident. <br>C'mon, man. I'm trying to be reasonable without saying "no, you're retarded and/or paranoid for thinking Yoshida's coming back". Throw me a bone, here.</br></br></br>  <br> There is no way Crow is losing to  <br>Gongenzaka <br>Sunday is going to be great when all the people that think this get BTFO.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no need to be reasonable when there's a handful of people in these threads that seem to think Yoshida can just walk in and take over just like that.</br>  <br>Gon won't lose because after Yuya got rekt'd by Jack, they have to prove that the Lancers aren't total scrubs.<br><br>Crow will have to be a very unfortunate sacrifice.  Sucks because I was looking forward to Crow VS Shun. </br></br></br>  <br>Either Crow is gonna get distracted by the kids and lose and entrust Yuya with winning to show them Tops or Crow will win and spread further hostility between the Lancers, maybe thats what the Council or Jean want</br>  <br>Crow isn't going to lose his first actual duel when there are Blackwings to be brought.</br>  <br>The second option is more possible. Crow has been arrogant to Yuya and co. so far, the only time he was nice was when he saved them.</br>  <br>  I will never have my own Rin <br>Well it's time to commit seppuku</br></br>  <br> BUY BLACKWINGS <br> 2015 <br>You're several years late, Synchros are pretty disliked by Konami at the moment and you still think BUY BLACKWINGS is a thing. Besides this Cup is getting interrupted anyway and you can lose and shill. Sora lost his first two duels.</br></br></br>  <br> Crow has been arrogant to Yuya and co. so far <br>No he hasn't. He told Yuya to care more about his friends wellbeing because Yuya was in his muh Yuzu mode in the midst of pulling a Judai</br></br>  <br>Gon is summoning a level 9 synchro. Sudden Shower's effect allows it to be a level 7 Tuner and Crow already has a level 1 tuner. He's going to summon his version of Blackwinged Dragon and win. I seriously hope it's good this time and that it's actually apart of the black wing archetype.</br>  If Gongenzaka loses and then Yuya finds out from Tokumatsu what happens to the losers of the Friendship Cup, he'll have even more of a drive to win and save Yuzu, Gongenzaka, and beat Jack  <br> Crow has been arrogant <br>No he hasn't. He tried to distance himself from Yuya because he figured that Yuya deserved to despise him for breaking out.<br>The only other altercation they've had is the "EGAO vs FOOD" shit, and that was more of a childish debate.</br></br></br>  <br>Crow seeing that the kids are safe and they are cheering for him is already the nail in the coffin for Gongenzaka<br><br>It's just like when Gongenzaka fought Neo Strong Ishijima and was about to lose until he saw that Yuya was all right and was cheering him on.<br><br>People just want Crow to lose because muh 5D's</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Assault Black-Feather Dragon, I knew it.</br>  <br><br>What if?</br></br>  <br>When did Durbe get boobies?</br>  <br>It could go either way, really. Depends on which Konami decides to shill harder. Right now it seems likely that Gon will win because of the circumstances, but Crow's got a good shot, too.  Also if Crow bombs now, Shinji has a valid reason for being pissy, and I've got a feeling he's going to go traitor for "good" reasons. </br>  <br>Then it would've made a lot more sense for Durbe to get no good on-screen duels.</br>  <br>synchros maybe weak but the blackwinged archetype is big and popular just like weak fusion has Hero monsters as their popularity.</br>  <br>Why is Arc-V so good at not telegraphic who will win?</br>  <br>Other way around exactly. Crow is dueling fine until he sees the kids and then loses. The kids sneaking in means they're in trouble if they get caught.<br>Besides Shinji is up next. Proper motivation for him and the Council mistreating a Common is better than mistreating an outsider.</br></br>  <br>BOOKS</br>  Isn't this duel a two parter anyway?  <br>Did someone said  BOOKS ?</br>  <br>Don't you mean BOOBS? Also does this qualify as sacrilege?</br>  <br>No</br>  Friendly reminder that this is a video that exists: http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm192<wbr>17142</wbr>  <br>HARUTOOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>I lost it at "ACCEL SYNCHRO".</br>  Alright faggots, here's your new bingo thingo for this arc  <br>Standard is not our enemy.</br>  <br>C'mon Leo, it'd be so easy. The Lancers are nowhere in sight, and they're only just getting their shit into gear now.</br>  Guys, the dub has given Gong a surname and it's dong-expandingly DK-tastic.<br>http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gong_S<wbr>trong</wbr></br>  <br>You're not supposed to actually put FREE SPACE on the card, it's supposed to be something that happens every episode regardless of what the episode is about.<br><br>Motorcycles would be a good one for this arc.</br></br></br>  <br> You'll never be in charge of the dub and give the characters stupid names </br>  <br>So now Gongenzaka is related to Strong Ishijima?</br>  <br>How do these names get through testing, someone would have to see that name and just think "No, that's stupid".</br>  <br>No, Ishijima is now called 'The Sledgehammer'.<br> Your first name will never be 'The' </br></br>  <br>I'm going to buy so much candy if Sora shows up anytime soon. I miss him.</br>  <br>FREE SPACE was on the last one (pic related). I just updated it. Cry to someone else.</br>   Gon is going to job   <br>Just replace it with EGAO</br>  This is weird.  When are we going to get a spell card that allows you to search for polymerization and a card listed as a summoning material on a monster?  <br>Seems alright. Isn't that right, Chairwoman?</br>  <br>Wait for Sunday.</br>  <br>all that hot red dragon dick, jack keeping his ace happy by giving him a loli sacrifice.</br>  <br>Here I fixed it for you.</br>  <br>Fine.<br> mfw her VA is busted for being part of a sex cult and she is replaced by a different commentator </br></br>  I lost interest in YGO after 5D's. I've recently decided to try to catch up. I'm like 8 episodes into Zexal and the hokeyness is downright painful. Does it get better or should I just skip to ARC-V?  <br> left <br>i-i don't want to fuck an old man!</br></br>  <br>Already?<br><br><br>Cheer up. I'm sure Yuri is giving him some "special" duel training back at Academia.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Skip to Arc-V. ZeXal is far from required watching to get ZeXal. Worst case scenario, you missed a reference that probably is likely to trigger some PTSD anyway.</br>  <br>i just started watching it too, use the guide and Zexal gets way more bearable.</br>  <br>Just watch Shark vs IV. Or use the guide.</br>  <br>Legendary collection the numeron code would be a better name.</br>  <br>Holy shit this is useful. Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Beautiful.</br>  <br>You've already started and it gets better as the first part develops. Then it gets radically better in II.<br><br> beat me to it, just follow this.</br></br></br>  <br>Skip to Arc-V. Zexal would be a waste of time to watch it at this point.</br>  Yo, what's with all the hand gestures people do in this show when they command a monster to attack or summon one? Also, why does Yuya always look like he's holding two swords when he draws? <br><br>What does " Otanoshimi wa kore kara!" mean? This line is every opening song thus far.</br></br>  <br>Actually last one had FREE DRAGONS</br>  <br>THE MAN has his best friends honor on the line he's gonna win</br>  <br> Sawatari <br> Winning on screen duel <br>LOL</br></br></br>  <br>The Otanoshimi has just began</br>  <br>Hanate Monsta</br>  <br> Hand gestures <br>It's called chuuni, anon. Haven't you ever felt the need to be unrealistically dramatic when playing a children's card game? Have you never practised your ace monster's summoning chant?<br><br> Otanoshimi wa kore kara da! <br>Means "The fun has just begun!" or "The fun's just getting started!" It's Yuya's catchphrase you dip.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pic related is the meaning. He literally copied that guy catchphrase.</br>  <br>he will win a couple of crucial duels probably to save yuya</br>  <br> I'm sure Yuri is giving him some "special" duel training back at Academia. <br>This makes me imagine a lot of torture and weird guro shit. Now I'm really uneasy.</br></br>  <br>Why is that, anon~~</br>  <br> It's called chuuni, anon. Haven't you ever felt the need to be unrealistically dramatic when playing a children's card game? Have you never practised your ace monster's summoning chant? <br><br>Can't say that I have. It doesnt have the same impact if there's no flashy entrance to go with it. I'd feel as silly as Yugo did when he tried to use Clear Wing without a duel disk. Speaking of chants have you ever wondered how they make up those chants?</br></br></br>  Well, /a/rc-v?  Is the fusion universe going to be full of GX characters and shit?  <br> This makes me imagine a lot of torture and weird guro shit <br>Like SeNMU's art?</br></br>  What's with this Jack? He didn't even do "WAGA TAMASHII" when he summoned this busted scar right demon red dragon.  <br>It's true that nobody  non-autistic  does it, but if we get VR duels in the future would you really duel in the same deadpan way as before?<br><br> If it ever becomes a thing I still probably wouldn't give in fully to my inner chuuni. The world can only handle so much autism. </br></br></br>  <br>Because it's savaged soul now</br>  I kinda miss the fudo style solitaire form of synchros now without a Yusei around. I still remember his Junk Destroyer.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VB2<wbr>by17OhSg</wbr>  [ ]<br>I'll pretend I didn't read that.</br></br>  <br>Crow's friends get carded protecting Crow.<br><br>Crow and Shinji get carded protecting the kids. <br><br>ENJOY gets carded protecting Yuya/Sawatari.<br><br>Kage gets carded protecting Reira. <br><br>Gon and Shun are going to get carded in Academia, and possibly Sawatari too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just dress up.</br>  <br>Probably the constant rape face. Doesn't inspire a lot of good thoughts.<br><br><br>You know, I actually really like their art/coloring style. Too bad I can't stand most guro stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek at that Yuya-Yuri cheating.</br>  <br>Shhhhh... Just let it happen anon.</br>  <br><br>I like how Yuto is legitimately thinking about his play while Yugo is like "what fucking letters are these"</br></br>  <br>Yuto tries man.</br>  <br>It's perfect, nobody will ever suspect Yuya of cheating so he's safe.<br><br><br>I can't deny there IS a certain charm to him...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuto's archetype is based on old-school tabletop games, and involves using Lv 3 monsters to make R4s.

Is he going to be inside of Yuya forever?</br>  <br>just make some anon, this stuff isn't all that hard to make yourself</br>   I will never have Yuzu-vision <br>why live</br>  <br>I know right? There have been several duels that before the episode aired there were debates over who would win. Not even the main character is safe.<br>I don't think any duel in Zexal had an unpredictable result other than Yuma losing against Kaito after the WDC.</br></br>  <br>You just aren't believing hard enough Anon.</br>  <br>Probably not.</br>  <br><br><br>But Shun considers standard duelists to be shitters, much like academia does. Why would he think Reiji would defeat him?</br></br></br>  <br>I felt really bad for Yugo. I'm also glad Shun wasn't there instead during this.</br>  <br>Reiji is basically the only Standard Duelist that isn't shit. Even Dennis had to gulp seeing all he could do and Reiji was just casually like "I'm not even trying Yuya, come the fuck on."</br>  <br>but they are, Shun is lucky that he doesnt duel anyone fro, this dimension because at lest 90% of the player base are unwashed disgusting neckbeards</br>  I want Majespecters to die in a fire.  <br>He would be first overjoyed that Ruri was back and safe, and then absolutely heartbroken the instant he realizes it's not her.</br>  <br><br>Most Standaed duelists don't have plot armor. There was nothing wrong with how Yaiba dueled.</br></br>  <br> Xyz having any right to talk about anybody <br><br>They're just as shit as Standard. Synchro and Fusion are the real power-houses. I mean there is a reason Xyz was attacked first.</br></br></br>  <br> Most Standaed duelists don't have plot armor. <br>Do you think he does? He even has Yu in his name.</br></br>  <br>that kid was a shitlord, he ran away and lefted his comrades</br>  <br>All his comrades were cards...</br>  <br> Uses Spellbooks <br> Was about to lose to Ancient Gears and needed help <br> Ran away like a coward <br>He'll be the first to get carded when Academia comes and there's no heroic synchro users to save him</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Jack shows up and saves him <br> tfw Reiji puts Jack in charge of protecting both Standard and Synchro and Jack becomes a dimensional hoping hero while the Lancers are in Academia </br></br>  <br> Uses Spellbooks <br> Actually plays the Xyz in the deck that was infamous for flat-out ignoring the ED in its prime. <br> Chickend out at first opportunity <br>I mean, his buds were running Noturias without actually playing any stun and fucking Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth.

Thank you /Arc-V/ for showing me the way!</br></br>  <br> The syncro animation when he uses like, 4 small fry monsters to make Stardust </br>  <br> want to take altered art cards to tournaments <br> shitlords like you ruin this game </br></br>  <br>Sure, it's degenerate, but I think it needs more synchro summoning machine pendulum archetypes to really BE something.</br>  <br>why are you still using DN ?</br>  <br>But where's your Trishula anon?</br>  <br>I hate Crow so much. Just rename the show ARC-CROW at this point. I wish Blackwings never existed.</br>  <br> He has 1 duel about 20 episode in <br> FUCKING CROW <br><br>AntiCrowfags are the least logical people</br></br></br></br>  <br> He's barely been relevant at all <br> He's shilled maybe 3 cards, and poorly at that. <br> Mostly non-intrusive. <br>I hate Crow as much as the next guy, but c'mon, he's been alright in Arc-V so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br> force his way into the series and make better characters job because "muh hungry kids" </br>  New Rank 4 RaidRaptor, when?<br><br>Rise Falcon is terrible, the deck lacks of offensive power.</br></br>  <br>Opponents, salvation won't stop crashing on me.<br><br>Side deck, I put it in if I don't like one of my synchros in the matchup I'm in, though the side deck was only half done when I took the picture.</br></br></br>  <br>He's shilled two cards.<br><br>Unless you count that card with him and the kids on it as shilling</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can we save the salt for when we actually find out if Gon jobs?</br></br>  <br> and make better characters job <br>Gon has literally 0 reason to move on in the tourney, and the shows wanked him off for so long i'm hoping a loss might lead to some actual development instead of more MUH FUDO NO DUEL</br></br>  <br>Nobody's jobbed to Crow. Yuya's had half a duel with him, and that's been it so far.<br><br>At this point I think I'm being baited, because nobody with 2 level 4 brain cells to overlay would be this utterly unreasonable.</br></br></br>  <br> shows wanked him off for so long <br>Are you sure you don't mean Shun? Can't recall Gon getting wanked off.</br></br>  <br> THE MAN getting wanked off <br>A real man doesn't need somebody else to wank him. A real man is wanked on his own merits. Not even writers can force him to wank when it is inappropriate.</br></br>  <br>Gon always turns the tide in Tag Duels, always steers Yuya right and hasnt lost to anyone but the MC<br><br> Are you sure you don't mean Shun? <br>The show hasnt wanked off Shun, its got on its knees and bathed his balls with its tongue for weeks on end</br></br></br></br>  <br>are you fucking retarded?<br>Crow has no reason to win he has nothing to do with the main plot just because he's there doent fuckign mean his going to be part of the main cast.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded?<br><br>Crow has every reason to win. He's a Common looking for freedom, he's part of Shinji's rebellion, he's the only Lancer besides Yuya who has something to do with Jack.<br><br>Hell he even asked Sam if Jack will be there watching his duel. He clearly has some beef with Jack, calling him a traitor and all, and he's there to prove something.<br><br>What reason does Gongenzaka have to win? To shill more Superheavies? Motherfucker pulls a new one out every fucking duel, and you guys complain about BUY BLACKWINGS?<br><br>Get the fuck out of here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No tarotray <br>Nigga, you can synch 4 off a normal summon, there's no reason not to.</br></br>  <br> Crow has no reason to win <br> Possible prior relationship with Jack, him being there lets Yuya learn more about him <br> Hates the Friendship Cup, drama with his conflict over being a participant  <br> Syncro native, has an actual stake in whats going on <br><br>Meanwhile, what reason does Gon have to continue? If anything, him being knocked out would deprive Yuya of an emotional support and create some good drama that way<br><br> has nothing to do with the main plot <br>He has everything to do with the plot at the moment</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know, this whole thing about "those damn Tops just buy rare cards to win!" thig seems really hypocritical when everybody runs high tier full archetype decks. Its especially annoying coming from Mr. Blackwings.<br><br>At least Yusei actually ran shitty cards.</br></br>  <br>Even Jack runs worse cards than Crow yet is King.</br>  Lol, here we go again with the Gon vs Crow.<br><br>Whoever wins, I foresee a massive wave of butthurting coming this Sunday.</br></br>  <br>Crow isn't a Lancer yet. Gon is, giving the Lancers an actual win after Yuya got wrecked is plot important. Then of course a Common facing the loser punishment works better than an outsider. Proper motivation for Shinji too. And of course this tourney is getting cancelled anyway.</br>  <br>Crow isn't even a Lancer.<br>Crow rewrote an entire plot, sidelined another character's development, and broke the preestablished lore of 5Ds just to shill more Blackwings. His hate is well-earned. All Gorgonzola's done is what every other main character with less than a dozen duels does: show more cards in their deck during each duel. It's like complaining that Yuya shows a new Performapal every time he duels, or that Yuzu uses a new Melodious monster each time she duels.<br><br>Gogenzaka is the first Lancer after Yuya to be dueling. If the Lancers start scrubbing out immediately, they look like complete shitters to the Administration Council.  Admittedly Gon of all people doesn't really need another win, and it would've been better to pick a different Lancer for the duel, like Shingo or Serena. <br>Likewise, if Crow loses, we ditch his plot of dealing with his beef with Jack, and likely the related plot threads.  Except Yuya's being set up to handle that anyway, so it's possible that Crow will be upstaged in a bout of Irony. <br><br>Really, this duel could go either way. Which of course makes it more exciting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tarotray <br> deskbot shaddolls <br>Huh?</br></br></br>  <br>Despite the butthurt, I love it when we can't tell who's going to win.</br>  Who is best Yuya?  <br>Crow seems to just kinda hijack his shit every day to get by.<br>At least, his 5D incarnation, so it's probably safe to say he flipped through those decks he stole and pocketed blackwings.<br><br>I believe it was also said that most of the people jack faced off in 5D's straight up Jobbed to him, which is why he still has trash cards like those three piece golems.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Crow rewrote an entire plot, sidelined another character's development, and broke the preestablished lore of 5Ds just to shill more Blackwings <br>You fucking faggot this isn't 5D's<br><br>This is Arc-V<br><br>Stop applying your hate to an entirely different character. What the hell has Crow even done yet in Arc-V? Feed and take in homeless kids?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't personally have any hate for the character, but I was explaining the logic being the "BUY BLACKWINGS" comments. They're not unfounded considering the complaint has nothing to do with the character, or even the writer, but Konami themselves pressing down on production to sell product.</br>  <br> Feed and take in homeless kids? <br>MONSTER</br></br>  <br>Tarotray goes in any shaddolls.<br>Synch4 for arc light, get negation and a ritual search.</br></br>  <br>You're playing the deck wrong then, it's meant to quickly swarm and take field advantage.</br>  They should have brought Kiryu back instead of Crow. Gon losing would be understandable but still fun to watch. Then you have Yuya win against him. After that, Yuya vs mind broken Dennis.<br><br>No one gives a fuck about Yuya and Crow's "smiles vs stomachs" debate.</br></br>   tfw you never see /a/rc-v hosts on dn/ygp/etc.  <br><br>Sad.</br></br>  <br>and where do the deskbots come into play?</br>  <br>Not that anon, but in your post you were clearly talking about the Crow from 5D's. I'm positive we'll see some new Blackwings in the duel on Sunday but saying the Arc-V Crow deserves hate because out of a span of the 10 episodes he's been in, he's showed off two new Blackwings is ridiculous.</br>  <br>Yuri=Yuto&gt;Yuya=Yugo</br>  Welp<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/5018408</br></br>  Anybody know where I can find Sound Duel II for GX, it seems to be impossible to find, but I may just be stupid.  <br> Gon is, giving the Lancers an actual win after Yuya got wrecked is plot important <br>Not really. They arent stopped from doing anything if people think they're scrubs for a bit longer<br><br> Then of course a Common facing the loser punishment works better than an outsider <br>Doesnt work as good motivation for Yuya<br><br> Proper motivation for Shinji too <br>Shinji already hates Tops, he doesnt need anymore. And Crow being around lets them clash over Shinji wanting to take more extreme methods<br><br> And of course this tourney is getting cancelled anyway <br>I dont think they'll pull the same crap twice in a row, we could use a good hype tourney final</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NS deskbot 3, SS deskbot 1, synch 4.</br>  How is she not hambeast?  <br><br>Maybe the only time we see her eating is the only time she eats a day.<br><br>If that's ALL she eats then she won't be fat.</br></br></br></br>  because she's a hamsterbeast and spends all of her calories rolling around as if inside an exercise wheel    Post Ebina you fucking faggots  Every fucking day. Every single fucking day this little bitch just sits there and gives me this stupid look on her face.  <br>She wouldn't be sparkling quite as hard if that were the case.</br>    <br> omg she's super good at sports and everything in life! but she's still a total slacker with otaku relatable hobbies and habits at home <br>It's anime.

How can a character be a slacker if they excel at everything in life.

I mean, it's inevitable. Once she's out of high school she would just play video games all day and have no motivation to go outside.  <br><br> not Umaru drugging and raping onii-chan and taking pictures to blackmail him for otaku crap </br></br>  Why is Ebina so cute.  <br>Phelps was a beast in his prime.</br>  <br>She's thick.</br>  <br>Deliciously so.</br>  I think you guys don't understand how food works. Which is probably why so many of you are fat. I was 120 pounds when I was in highschool and I used to eat ice cream for breakfast.<br><br>I also walked everywhere, often skipped lunch and never ate snacks. It very nearly made me diabetic.<br><br>I know you're not stupid but it's calories in - calories out. If she walks a lot (shown) exercises on occasion (shown) and eats junk food instead of meals (also shown) she may very well make herself diabetic too but she'll probably be skinny while she does it.<br><br>Good health =/= being skinny. Very often skinny people are in poor health because they eat and exercise terribly. They simply expend as many calories as they take in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mental exercise is proven to be as effective as real exercise.<br><br>You can burn as many carbs and get muscle tone.</br></br></br>  <br> None of those sound like 4000 calories except the breakfast. <br>a pound of pasta, with tomato sauce, energy drinkS, and 6-8 slices of pizza doesn't sound close to 4000 calories?</br></br>  <br>I'd like to get the source of that. If you eat shit and don't exercise at all you'll get fat and filthy, there's no way around that unless you have some sort of special genetic condition.</br>  <br>http://www.popsci.com/scitech/artic<wbr>le/2006-07/mental-workout</wbr></br>  <br>While theoretically possible it isn't practical at all, you won't be able to actually lose weight like that. That article also isn't scientific.</br>  <br>Yes you could. There's also this as well.<br>http://jn.physiology.org/content/ea<wbr>rly/2014/09/24/jn.00386.2014</wbr></br></br>  <br> contribute significantly to disuse-induced weakness <br> attenuates weakness and VA by maintaining normal levels of inhibition <br>As I said, you can't able to train like that, you won't gain muscles and you won't lose weight if you don't have a decent diet. Say whatever you want about the theory, it just isn't applicable normally.</br></br></br>  <br> you can't able to train like that <br> you can't able <br>Well, whatever you say. I'm going to keep doing it as well as my regular workouts.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, at first I wanted to write "won't be able to" and forgot to erase the able to. I meant that if you do only that and nothing else it might only help your body to not weaken as much as it would normally but it's by no means a replacement for actual physical training. Doing both is of course the best.</br>  <br>Nah more like<br> more like Umaru has a very bad case of scratch <br> pester his aniki to relieve it for her <br> hours of sex ensues <br> after that, being the lazy fuck she is, tries to have her way with him everytime. <br> lots of creampies were had </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awkward qt.</br>  <br> pester his aniki <br>OH NO</br></br>  <br>doujins when?</br>  Swimmers use to eat a 8000+ calories diet and they are skinny. When you are exercising a lot your body becomes a furnace, burning your fat away. Training yourself to run a competition will make your fat melt away like butter on hot sun. <br><br>More importantly than just diet away, exercising a lot will both help you lose weight and also put your body and heart at a peak condition.</br></br>  <br>I dont think anyone with a cleft lip would be able to act like that</br>  <br>Umaru exercises a lot. She does soccer AND swimming.<br>The only people who think she'd be fat from eating a lot of junk food are idiots.</br></br>  <br><br>You have to try to become hambeast. Like, you have to give zero fucks about your body or what you put into your mouth. I come from a family of fat people and I'm the only one that's not fat.

HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> takes every lesson learned by the first game <br> fucks it up <br>Haven't been so dissapointed since part 5</br></br></br>  <br>Never</br>  <br>Copyright laws for music are pretty lax in Japan, I think.<br><br>So, as long as the localization teams are careful, there should be no problem.<br>And he already had problems with Prince. They wanted to bring the VA PS2 game over here, but Prince got all huffy about Gold Experience and Araki wasn't willing the change the name back then so we didn't get the game.</br></br></br></br>  Did Josuke ever use Crazy D on [Spoiler]his meaty D?[/spoiler]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=30i<wbr>QrFL7U4c</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>My sides are smashed.</br></br>  <br>Reported for defiling Josuke's purity.  I want to protect his smile. </br>  What if JoJo was adapted by KyoAni instead of David Production?  <br>There must be some intense Stand battle happening but because we can't see them it just looks like a bunch of nips being retarded.</br>  <br>in jojolion? a tie between karera, yagiyama, and jobin</br>  I finished reading part 5 the other day.<br><br>I feel the first half wasn't as good as any of part 2,3 or 4 but from the moment Doppio got introduced it got really good. What's the consensus on part 5? I can understand people not liking Giorno as much as other JoJo's because he only really got good development and shows of personality early on and essentially did nothing afterwards but I feel the last third or so of the part really made up for it.<br><br>The epilogue with the marble ball is honestly one of my favorite parts of all of JoJo, I thought it was absolutely genius. What do people generally think of it?<br><br>Also, one other question which I'd like as minimalistic answer as possible as I don't know the full details yet but  I'm aware of the universe reset in part 6 but only that there is one and not any details. Does it leave a bad taste in your mouth when you read it? Because I can't help but feel really bad that every part up to 6 was literally wiped from existence, it's heartbreaking to think it was all for nothing. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The wryyy at the end fucking lol</br>  What are the chances of a Part 4 adaption? When do you think we'll know?    <br>They'll tease with a TBC arrow on the last BD and then debut a trailer at Jump Festa in december.</br>  Oh shit, it's Alternate Dio time, isn't it?  Homosexual pastor arrived  <br>You feel really wrecked anon, but the next universe is still JoJo. Part eight is wonderful (part seven is too) and honestly part six has one of the coolest character arcs for the main JoJo. I'd start it after a break for a day or two though.</br>  <br>Oh, you misunderstand. I forgot that he can't fix himself.<br>I didn't mean anything lewd, but any guy would tap the chance to magically make his dick bigger if he could, even a decent guy like Josuke. You know that's a guy thing, and Josuke has his "dudebro" moments, too.</br></br>  <br>Gay priest<br>Queer padre<br>Fag cleric<br>Homophile preacher</br></br></br></br>  <br> ORAORAORA WRYYYYYY <br><br>Are you shitting me?</br></br></br>  <br> dudebro moments <br><br>Josuke's half-English, ya dummy. He knows it's not all about the pussy game.</br></br></br>  <br>How did he get out of his hiding spot, grabbed the corpse and got out of sight in just 9 seconds or whatever?</br>  <br> in just 9 seconds <br>It's 5.<br> How? <br>Because it's Dio. <br>Dio seconds aren't the same as Earth seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>true, that's another element for basically all parts: JoJo is never really a guy who goes around, even though he could.<br>That goes for lots of other characters, too.<br><br>Man, JoJo plays in a too beautiful world.</br></br></br></br>  Guys, help.<br>as far as I remember, the 'agreed' most shit part was 5, right? because 5 manages to make me drop it pretty well.</br>  <br> JoJo is never really a guy who goes around <br><br><br>I actually really liked part 5. Sure, Giorno's uninteresting, but Bruno, the rest of the crew and the fights were all spectacular.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not admitting Joseph is a black sheep of the family, but the cool kind, not the "ignore that fag" kind. </br>  <br><br> Black sheep of the family <br><br>How is he more of a black sheep than Josuke or Giorno? He's one of the most JoJo. He's even one of the few that are called JoJo and one of the few with the last name Joestar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, I think he embodies the JoJo personality more than the humble Englishman or the autistic Japanese delinquent. Him being a slut is his only bad trait.</br>  <br> one of the few with the last name Joestar <br>3 Joestars<br>2 Kujos<br>2 Higashikatas<br>1 Giovanna</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If part 5 gets an anime and we get it, Golden Experiences name may not change.</br>  <br>Warner Bros. owns Prince, don't they?</br>  If you stab someone wearing an Aja'd Stone Mask with the Arrow, what happens?  <br>Yes, that's why. <br><br>Although I don't know if that means the movie division can freely use his copyright, does it?</br></br></br>  <br>Or the games, for that matter. It'd be strange to see the anime using Gold Experience and a new JoJo game using Golden Wind.</br>  <br>I don't think it counts for the games, because Bamco would still have to negotiate with WB, since WBG doesn't publish the games like they do the anime.</br>  <br>Pretty sure the Stone Mask and Arrow are basically the same thing except the Arrow is a more "complete" version as it gives a Stand.</br>  <br>It doesn't work that way. Whether they could or not, there's no way they'd prioritize Jojo over not potentially irritating such a big name artist.</br>  <br>So if the Aja'd mask turns Pillar Men into the Ultimate Lifeforms, does it turn humans into Pillar Men?</br>  <br>What happens if someone uses the Stone Mask twice?</br>  <br> the Stone Mask gives stands <br> the Arrow turns people into vampires <br><br>imagine the possibilities</br></br></br></br>  <br>3 Joestars<br>3 Kujos<br>1 Higashikatas<br>1 Giovanna<br>1 Kira</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guy has Stand as long as he's wearing the Mask. <br> Slams Mask onto his face, activating it by breaking his nose. <br> "Come on Fine Young Cannibals!" </br></br></br>  What would MiH Requiem do?<br><br> HEAVEN ON EARTH! </br></br>  <br>He wouldn't need it.

All they do is cause autistic arguments.</br>  <br>Legally, trademarks only apply if a consumer could reasonably mistake one product for another. It's reasonable that someone could confuse two singers called Vanilla Ice, but it's not reasonable that someone could confuse the rapper Vanilla Ice with the interdimensional punch ghost Vanilla Ice.</br>  <br>Vanilla Ice isn't the stand, Cream is. Vanilla Ice is the user. Also, Cream isn't really a punch ghost.</br>  <br> 5 highest <br>Yeah nah</br></br>  <br> Also, Cream isn't really a punch ghost. <br>It's more of a "Fist shaped holes in the User" ghost</br></br>  <br>You're autistic, anon.</br>  <br>Oh look it's Vanilla Bait.</br>  <br>I'm not the one who replied to a retarded part ranking</br>  <br>To be honest Part 5's my least favorite. <br><br>It has an interesting start, but to me the story started falling flat after they defected from the Boss' side. It took some of Part 3's elements where they spent the rest of the time trying to reach a certain place while the Villain kept sending stands to fight them every new chapter and it just got old for me real quick. <br><br>The group was great, especially Bruno. Honestly he really held up the entire part for me. I feel like Giorno's even more of a boring protagonist than Jotaro. The villain is easily the worst one in the series. And then the whole final arc where Araki just said fuck it and started killing random members and the whole body switching bullshit, and then the ending with Giorno winning by plot convenience thanks to the Arrow. <br><br>Not to say it doesn't have its highlights, there's a ton of great moments in part 5. But it just feels like one of the weaker parts to me.<br><br>  It also got some points taken off for treating my boy Polnareff like that. All he wanted was a peaceful life.  <br><br>As to your other question, the universe reset was a weird but nice ending in Part 6. Some very slight spoilers that don't matter in the long run but   The universe at the end of Part 6, and the universe that takes place in Part 7 and 8, are different ones.  <br><br>You'll understand it more when you finish part 6.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Why does Araki always pair up Giorno and Jolyne in his art?  Do you think Josuke ever found out about his secret admirer?  So, most important SC question<br>  OVA Voodoo Kingdom or Anime Voodoo Kingdom?<br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bPmlT<wbr>jjwsME</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=raOO9<wbr>8pwvnc</wbr>  [ ]<br/></br></br></br> </br>  <br> tried to fuck his stand <br>Is he the representation of /a/ if we had stands?</br></br>  <br><br>I feel the complete opposite. It starts off slow but keeps gaining steam and getting more and more bananas. It's easily better than SC.</br></br>  <br>Why does he shrink?</br>  <br>Original Voodoo Kingdom is much better. If you're going to do a MAD you might as well make it original instead of a bootleg version of one that already exists.</br>    <br> Because I can't help but feel really bad that every part up to 6 was literally wiped from existence, it's heartbreaking to think it was all for nothing. <br><br>That's not how the reset works.</br></br></br>  <br>The new one is shit because it doesn't have DIO saying ZA WARUDO. Fuck that.</br>  http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Part_VII<wbr>I:_JoJolion<br>Go to the Chapter section<br>Look at the Ultra Jump titles<br>Now compare them to the Volume titles<br>So much wasted potential. Never forget.</br></br></br></br></wbr>    What is his name again?  <br> eros is inevitable between Josuke and Yasuho <br><br>Is this romance eros or sex eros?</br></br></br>  <br>fat ass</br>  <br>jumpin jack flash</br>  <br>Oasis</br>  <br>All of them dying through natural means would be the same anyway. To me it honestly doesn't make a difference. At first I was devastated like you were, but I thought logically and came to the conclusion that it doesn't really mean anything or make a difference. What matters is what had happened in the past.</br>  reminder that Jolyne killed in cold blood a normal, non stand user human.  <br>You become a double vampire and/or a double ultimate lifeform.</br>  <br>I'd have killed him too shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit</br>  /r/ing the "Dick is good in your mouth, but have you tried the word of God?"    <br>Gimp Gelato</br>  <br>Requim stands aren't the normal stand's ability on crack. All requim is, is whatever the user needs at that moment.<br><br>Silver Chariot Requim didn't have the ability to stab things really really fast.</br></br></br>  Is JoJo a meme manga?  <br>Danke, I had lost my image</br>  <br>No, I'd say you're a year too late to say that.</br>  <br><br>For the life of me I can't remember. Who?</br></br>  (Keep in mind I'm only like halfway through Part 5)<br><br>Why is Mista the best Part 5 character?<br><br>Also why is Mista the one that goes out and does fucking everything in part 5 (so far that I've read) but is relegated to being a background character?</br></br></br></br>  <br>her lawyer</br>  <br><br> Lawyers <br> Human <br><br>Knife-eared cunt had it coming.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, she straight up strangles him and causes him to crash his car.</br></br>  <br><br>Every Passione member except Fugo carries their weight.</br></br>  <br>He can't use Crazy D on himself you twat.</br>  <br>Okay, I suspected I just wasn't far enough in and that seems to be the case</br>  <br><br>Mista is great and all, but he's one of the least helpful members. Defeated less enemies than Narancia, Giorno and Bruno and wasn't crucial to solving the mystery like Abbachio.</br></br>  <br>It's a shame he dies.</br>  <br>As I've seen so far it really feels like he's the one with the any initiative, as he goes out first, does shit, then gets fucked up because everyone else is waiting around or trying to catch up, regardless of how many people he's defeated, however I've only read about halfway so I'm sure this will change, it just really sticks out for the first half to me<br><br><br>It's a shame I don't care about spoilers</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a shame I don't care about spoilers <br>I'm bullshitting, don't worry. I can't really remember who dies, as well.</br></br>  <br><br>this is my favorite jojo meme</br></br>  <br>Narancia, Bruno and Abbachio die. Giorno, Mista and Trish are the only ones who survive, while Polnareff becomes a turtle. Fugo lives too, obviously, but you don't see him at the end.</br>  <br> Gio is so boring! He never really expresses himself! <br><br>Not saying this is you, but do people just skip the first 3 chapters where it outright says Giorno is eerily serene as fuck, and how many parallels it shoves in your face that he's basically "Dio gone good"?<br><br>Of fucking course Giorno is going to stick in the background until the very end,  that's exactly how Dio was in Part 3 god damnit anons use some critical fucking thinking </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dio wasn't the main character of Part 3 and his mystery was the whole point of it.</br>  Post your favorite "Oh SHIT" moments in Jojo  <br><br>I think a lot of the problem is the bad translation as well. Apparently there's a lot of quirks in the way that each character speaks that is completely lost in the translation. Despite that Part 5 still has my favourite supporting cast. Passione Clan aint nothing to fuck with.</br></br>  <br>I never got why DIO needed to be so mysterious. We all knew who DIO was in part 1, the mystery was just his stand.</br>    <br>Congratulations, anon! You're almost realizing the the point! Just a little more thought and you'll finally understand the entire point of Giorno's character and why he wasn't at the foreground 90% of the time!<br><br><br>That too. In the Japanese text, Giorno sounds EXACTLY like Dio, and talks just as formal and polite as he does. Everyone is unnerved at first by it, but eventually "comes under his spell".<br><br>Giorno is an incredibly subtle character that I think most people ignore because they don't expect this kind of shit in JoJo, and just want Wacky Stand Adventures: The Series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think you just posted it. Jolyne getting turned inside out, the moebius heart, Pucci massacring EVERYBODY and SNAILAGEDDON are all up there. Part 6 was just one baffling moment after another. <br><br>And of course pic related and SPACE RIPPA STINGY EYES are golden.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked that mysterious. It made it feel like a completely different Dio. <br><br>Dio in part 1 was cunning and mostly an asshole, For the moments we saw Dio in Part 3 he was more mysterious and intimidating. Especially since everyone in Part 3 kept hyping him up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can someone post Weather Reports subsequent pose?</br></br>    <br>Talking about this?</br>  <br> Him being a slut is his only bad trait. <br>Trufax</br></br>  <br>Pucci casually walking down the side of sideways Kennedy Space Center in the middle of the C-Moon fight.</br>  <br>Y'know, translators should play around with fonts more to give each character their own voice. I didn't like how a translator note actually had to point out how fucking annoying Magenta Magenta was supposed to be when he could have written his lines in  Comic Sans .</br>  <br>Yeah I get that, I just kind of preferred when he was more involved in Part 1, as opposed to Part 3 where he really only had DIO's World to shine.</br>  <br><br>jojo has ruined me for other manga/anime. i'm not as satisfied with things that don't have constant posing.</br></br>  <br> Giorno is an incredibly subtle character that I think most people ignore because they don't expect this kind of shit in JoJo, and just want Wacky Stand Adventures: The Series. <br>We already get this with Jotaro though, and Jotaro is prominent in many parts that Giorno's personality seems even more basic.</br></br>  <br>Fuck man I really wish I wasn't spoiled on this when I was reading Part 7. The World coming back would've been a legit shocking moment</br>  <br>Imagine being a Jap in 2010 or whatever and opening Ultra Jump and seeing that. I would've shat myself.</br>  <br> Everyone is unnerved at first by it, but eventually "comes under his spell". <br><br>I wonder why.</br></br></br>  <br>Same, but it was still pretty hype to read. Animefags will never experience this  because SBR will never ever get an anime. </br>  <br><br>I hated part 3 Dio. Trying to be mysterious when there is no mystery is frustrating and dull. We know all about this character. Putting a shadow over his face is not making us forget anything about him. Part 3 DIO spends his time doing nothing and then coming out of hiding to job to a hero who only has indirect beef with him. <br><br>Part 3 DIO is the worst fucking villain despite being the fucking best in Part 1. PB Dio is great because he actually has a lifelong connection to Jonathan and a strange brotherly love and respect despite it all. There is an actual conflict developed. He has NOTHING to play off of against Jotaro. Worst villain, worst Jojo and worst showdown. When you take away the poses and one liners there is nothing of substance.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the one! Thanks man.</br></br>  <br>I can understand why you don't like him but<br><br> Part 3 DIO is the worst villain  <br>You have read Part 5...right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Diavolo <br> Worst Villain </br></br>  <br>Nah SBR will get an anime in 2025. <br><br>  And the corpse's identity will be changed to Hesus Bhrist.  </br></br></br>  <br>Part 3 DIO is a fucking disgrace. Part 1 Dio is one of the best villains of all times. DIO is just completely devoid of personality and intellect. He's generic.</br>  <br><br>Part 5 is way fucking better than part 3 because there is an ACTUAL FUCKING MYSTERY. We don't know why the Boss is or that he's even the villain. This comes at the cost of character development, but at least it had intrigue. Part 3 had neither.</br></br>  <br>The moment I realized that Pucci's stand is affecting the whole world, simply because Araki decided to outright show it instead of putting up some news report.<br> The commentary about commercials in television is the the most bizarre part in SO. </br></br>  <br>I don't think the name Jesus Christ is copywritten.</br>  <br><br> Why <br><br>*who*</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how everything part 6 looks nothing like florida</br>  <br> The commentary about commercials in television is the the most bizarre part in SO. <br><br>In any other part you might've been right, but not in Snail Ocean.</br></br></br>  <br>I really think everything about the end of SO is gold. Every part after, I dunno, the green baby maybe? Or after the courtyard shit. <br><br>But especially every time we saw the rest of the world that wasn't the main cast dealing with the accelerating time. Fucking Rohan Kishibe.</br></br></br>  <br> never saw any of the other JoJos reacting to it <br>At least we got to see Rohan pissing off mangakas.</br></br>  <br>Diavolo's not a very good villain.<br>We knew from the very beginning he was the villain because of Giorno's plan to overthrow the boss.<br><br>Also <br> Why did he suddenly decide to now try to kill his daughter instead of much eariler if he's that paranoid about his identity <br> Why not send Doppio out to retrieve Trish and kill her yourself to save all the trouble. <br><br>All we know about Diavolo is he's paranoid about people finding out his identity. We don't know why, or what caused this, it just is. Even then there really couldn't be any big payoff to who The Boss was. That could only work if we had met Diavolo earlier in the story but didn't know he was The Boss. Finding out The Boss is someone we don't know isn't shocking. Just a bit interesting to see what he looks like.<br><br>Diavolo's just not a very good villain comparing him to the other Jojo villains. He has a motive but we don't exactly know why. We barely know anything about him other than Doppio and being paranoid. And he doesn't even have any memorable lines from Part 5.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>After the muslims getting asshurt about the OVA having the Quran, they may not want to take any chances.</br></br>  <br>This whole time we've seen that Diavolo is insanely paranoid, and in the final battle he was given a brief moment to retreat. He could've lurked in the shadows, send more assassins, maybe throw some rocks or poison Giorno's drinks.<br>But no. Instead, we got a "muh pride" moment from fucking Diavolo of all people.<br>Enjoy your constant not-death, fucker.</br></br></br>  What was up with that teasing Giorno bullshit in Stone Ocean? They talk about how Dio's sons are gathering and Florida and then it goes <br><br>"But what about Giorno Giovanni? Perhaps he is already here...."<br><br>That got me hype thinking we were gonna get a cameo. But nope, nothing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't retreat because he could never get to be the mafia boss again</br>  <br><br>Does that little mention prove that Heaven's Door literally nullified MiH for Rohan?</br></br>  <br>Because then there would be four of Dio's scion and Mista would've freaked out and killed everyone.</br>  Hey doc, add this to the "jojo out of context" folder  <br>Nah, it was just a reference to the fact that Rohan is fucking insane when it comes to making his mangoes. As demonstrated in Part 4 many times.<br><br>Didn't Araki confirm somewhere that Rohan didn't even notice the universe change because of his manga or something like that? Dude loves his job/art.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody was affected by MiH apart from the people in the main cast who died.</br>  I know it's only just starting but Part 8 feels like "a lot of nothing happening" to me. It just feels like nothing in it is really solid and the fights are fairly boring.<br>Am I the only stupid fuck who thinks this? The pacing is great but the content feels really empty.</br>  <br> Four sons <br>Dio's pullout game is weak.</br></br>  <br> the fights <br> reading Part 8 for the fights <br>This isn't DBZ, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but no one cares what christians bitch about.</br>  <br>I think it's great. But I like detective things so I guess it's not for everyone. It's Gappy figuring out who he is, not villain of the week constant action bullshit. If anything Part 8 has made me dislike the other parts a bit more.</br>  <br>It's a little bit of a change from previous parts, because the plot so far seems to be less about defeating enemies and more about solving various mysteries (but especially WHO AM I)<br><br>Speaking of Jojolion, I suddenly realized that Jobin looks like one of the special spiky fruits. I don't know what to make of that fact however.</br></br></br>  <br>That would've been perfect</br>  <br>One of the best parts of JoJo for me has always been how those rascally stand users will get out of trouble using their wits and smarts.<br>It isn't about the fights but it's not just the fights, every confrontation feels boring in multiple ways. The best part of part 8 so far was the beetle battle and it would have been better if it was more detailed, it felt like an easy win.</br></br>  <br>Bring Dio back</br>  <br>I've seen better battles with beetles in a bottle.</br>  So is the new chapter implying that kira was super rich<br><br>Because Karera said Mansion</br></br>  Could Pucci not know his own fate in heaven because he existed outside of time and wasn't able to go through his life like everyone else?  <br>It's because he was a niggaboo</br>  <br>He could move sanic fast while others move in relatively normal speed, so we can safely assume he isn't affected by MiH. Coincidentally, this is also the reason how Emporio defeated him.</br>  <br>HWMN release apparently on track for tomorrow.</br>  <br>Must be a mistranslation. It happened in Yagiyama's flashback too. Could someone contact the translator about this?<br><br>The word mansion is used as a loanword in Japanese, but instead of an actual mansion it means a larger sort of apartment building.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant to say Dainenjiyama's flashback, not Yagiyama's.</br>  <br><br>You did not address a single point in the post you're replying too. <br><br> We knew from the very beginning he was the villain because of Giorno's plan to overthrow the boss. <br><br>That's retarded. Nothing about the fact Giorno wanted to overthrow the gang necessitates that he wanted to kill Trish.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why did he suddenly decide to now try to kill his daughter instead of much eariler if he's that paranoid about his identity <br> Why not send Doppio out to retrieve Trish and kill her yourself to save all the trouble. <br><br>I think you underestimate Diavolo's paranoia. Hell, some people already knew that this was the Boss's daughter; if Doppio had just went to her and straight-up killed her there was a slight chance of someone connecting some dots. <br><br>Also, did Diavolo even know about Trish before the time of the story? I kind of got the impression he didn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where can I get all of part 5?<br>nyaa only had partial copies, and madokami was worse.<br><br>I read on a tablet on the bus, so reading online is not an option.</br></br></br>  what should i color boys  <br>Neat.

I mean I guess it wasn't really a fight and more of running away, but the ending was hilarious, I wasn't expecting Paper Moon King to be so deadly.

I've already seen pretty much everything on this flowchart, so this chart doesn't matter to me.  You can tell Kill la Kill was the author's gateway by all the stuff from recent seasons.  I think Yaraon legit wrote on article about that chart. Thought that was funny.  Weird how much new stuff is on that chart, I'm guessing the person who made it started watching anime around 2012-ish given the titles on it. <br><br>It's hit and miss, like every chart made by one person. I guess some new people might find it useful, but it's not really any more useful than the charts /a/ has made in the past.</br></br>  I think this is a better choice for foodgasm.

As a person who is fairly close to being a newfag, I think I understand what newcomers might look for. I've gotten my flatmate and my sister into anime by specifically picking shows that were relevant to their interests.<br><br>Also, took many suggestions from IRC talks, few iterations on reddit, few other freinds, and students from the middle school I teach at. (fun fact: we live in a generation where teenage girls start anime with Hanasaku Iroha, Madoka and Yuuki Yuuna).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never said they're all good. Some of them are just fun and that's it. It's more of a knowledge database than a personal seal of approval for everything.</br>  <br>You only watched 90 anime in three years?</br>  It's alright. Some shit I'd disagree with but that's a given.<br>I don't know why people go to /a/ for anime recommendations in the first place because, let's be honest, anything anyone recommends people are gonna be all,<br> seriously recommending [insert anime here] <br> having this pleb of taste </br></br></br>  <br>I watched anime for 7 years and I only watched 40</br>  <br><br><br> d) It's shit, just like your taste :]  <br>I'm cringing. Fuck off back to reddit. I mean that literally, since you left your username in the pic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how this happens while I've watched more than 200 anime in 2 years.</br>  <br>84 for me in 2 1/2 years~</br>  <br>You know those idle threads?</br>  <br> Because I'm enough into it to begin to understand what's good and what's not <br><br>Judging by your MAL, I think not.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was expecting worse, but not bad for beginners.</br></br>  <br>Too busy to watch more. And maybe not even 3 years, it could be 4 or even 5.<br><br><br>Oh excuse me for joining a thread about my OC that some anon started with the outdated version of the project.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Casuals. 100 per year is just four episodes a day assuming single cours series. Hardly a big investment for a hobby.</br>  <br>I know what?</br>  <br>The idle threads here on /a/<br>People sitting around doing nothing.<br>That's how that, that being people having watched 90 anime in 4 years, happens.<br>How can you be this retarded?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gateway was FMA:B and Bebop some time before that, but you're spot on, congrats.

You even went as far as plugging your offsite username. You're not going to get any karma here for that. Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Ambitious doesn't mean good. It means it tried to be something, doesn't mean it delivered.<br><br><br>It got a few people into anime, it stays.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's a clusterfuck and none of the branches make any fucking sense. It's like the author had a list of anime that he wanted to share with people and then came up with the branches afterwards, instead of actually having logic and reason behind it.<br><br>The shows themselves that the author recommends are mostly fine, but how he gets there makes no fucking sense<br><br> haruhi <br> parody of anime cliches  <br><br> Neon genesis evangelion <br> intense psychological thriller <br><br> Fate/zero before Unlimited blade works </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you only watch popular or critically acclaimed anime you have no business recommending anime to other people.

My bad. I guess I'll have to finish the updated chart and delete the old one, and maybe this way people won't bother reposting the old version. And then I'll back off as I should have, without having to plug in every time i stumble upon a thread with it.</br>  <br>Someone post that Chess screenshot.</br>  <br>There are like 5 anime worth seeing per year anyways.</br>  <br>I can be this retarded by people not bringing that term up in most threads. <br>Since I started browsing 4chan regularely I can see my daily amount of episodes watched drop though.</br></br>  <br>And you know that because you watched a lot more than that or you're just claiming it yourself to excuse your pathetic power level?<br>There's still over 50 years of anime out the so even if as you claim only 5 per year are worth watching then there's still no excuse to watch less than 250.</br></br>  <br> I watch 10 series per year max <br>Sure</br></br>  <br>Not the guy who made the chart. That was just an observation I made when watching over the years. <br><br>Having high standards is not a bad thing, anon.</br></br></br>  <br> Landed on Shinsekai Yori on the first try <br>Good chart. I don't really need it anymore, but still saved, thanks.</br></br>  <br>You need to have some level of quantity to even know about quality.</br>  <br>Anonku, jakiego nicka używasz poza śmierdzącym redditem?</br>  <br>Having too high standards will make you lose the ability to enjoy anime.<br>Most anime might have faults, but there are still tons that are enjoyable.</br></br>  <br>Żadnego, chyba że kojarzysz twór znany jako Święte Przymierze albo Gothic Multiplayer.

The chart is messy, hard to get through, and fulll of ridiculous flaws that make me look like a retard, but it does its job.</br>  I make it a priority to watch 4 randoms a month. You don't know the good until you've seen the bad.  <br><br>Never e.g. Toradora was one of my first, and I recognized it as shit.</br></br>  <br>I've watched all of them.</br>  <br>Nah, you just have shit taste.

For DVDs like that, is it actually a cartoon that's animated and colored, with actual voice acting and done to imitate whatever it's ripping off?
