[ How was your life 9 years ago?<br>How is your life now?<br><br> also post Misaki </br></br></br>  same  <br> ;_; </br>  <br>No need to cry. I don't want to change my hikkimori ways.</br>  9 years is too long ago. Holy shit. I was still in high school.  Worse<br><br>How many times have you watched the anime?<br>How many times have you read the manga?<br>How many times have you read the novel?</br></br></br></br>  Don't mind me, just posting best girl.  I got into anime 9 years ago  <br>I had to take care of my brother always taking him to the hospital. I skipped the school so many times and spend the time walking 5 hours (Funny fact no one noticed and did it 2 years) and then back home or to the hospital. Now its meh, I spend the time working and going out with friends pretty good life.</br>  <br>Me too. <br><br> How is your life now? <br>I am still sitting in the same place.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Way, way better. I had hope that I  could still change . Now I have no hope and dreams left.<br>Also, Hitomi best girl.</br></br>  There are people posting on /a/ who were 8 years old 9 years ago.  <br>How many times have you watched the anime?<br>above 100<br>How many times have you read the manga?<br>above 100<br>How many times have you read the novel?<br>above  100 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was locked up studying really hard while preparing my "high school debut" Harem mc style. I managed to get the grades but that was it. Now I'm also locked up, although this time I'm furiously fapping to misaki.  <br>a-are you sure tripfag-kun?</br>  <br>Back then I actually had hopes and dreams, but overall what I do hasn't changed at all.<br>Yamazaki was right then<br>Yamazaki is right now</br></br></br>  <br> I'm furiously fapping to misaki. <br>get out</br></br>  <br>Yes there is nothing good outside.</br>  <br>what about on the other side?</br>  <br>Literally thinking about every second I'm not thinking something else. But probably will never do because I'm a coward. </br>  <br>I still have many video games to play and animus to watch. I don't want to go to gensokyo yet.</br>  Life was probably pretty good when I was 6  <br>;_; hits so close anon but i know i will do it, i'm gonna make her my savior, my true angel</br>  <br>B&amp;</br>  <br>I don't want to die. Life is shit, but I can't let go of that last hope that maybe something will happen, then it'll really be meaningless.</br>  <br>how can you be an hikki neet for 9 years and also play vidya? are you a richfag? also how old are you?</br>  <br> can't let go of that last hope that maybe something will happen <br>I think the same. There is only a tiny bit of hope that keeps me alive maybe, just maybe things will get better.</br></br>  <br>26. I can't say that I'm rich but my parents do alright for themselves. Video games aren't that expensive when that's literally all I spend money on.</br>  NEETs are the product of parenting styles that were too accommodating. Everyone who is NEET probably grew up too comfortably in a place where they never had to struggle. That's why they don't have any ambition.<br><br>Struggle breeds strength.</br></br>  <br>we are literally the same age anon, i hope I'm dead within 5 years.<br><br> Video games aren't that expensive <br>yes they are?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well emulators are free at least. Don't worry anon. The sweet release of death will always be there.

It's never too late.</br>  <br>you're probably right</br>  <br> The sweet release of death will always be there <br>That makes me feel good.</br></br>  <br>h-how?</br>  <br>Not him but yeah, I'm waiting on death too<br><br>Also nice to see you, usually only see you @ r9k</br></br></br>  <br>Go get a shitty job and start taking responsibility for yourself.</br>  Why isn't Welcome to the NHK popular in Japan?

The light novel on the other hand</br>  <br> 9 years already, man time goes fast when you stay inside all day. <br>it's really fast, i just wonder why isn't the opposite?</br></br>  <br>i never felt like the drama was forced.</br>  <br>9 years....<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZFg<wbr>tC_H79m4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> 9 years </br>  <br>I'm getting hit by a truck of feels right now. It's been so long since I've seen an anime that made me feel like this. Also I wanna learn this song on guitar</br>  Misaki always reminded me of a grown up Osaka  <br> bookfags <br>get out of here</br></br>  Gonna post some more Misaki  <br>Well now I have to listen to the whole OST and feel feels all night.<br><br>I hope you're happy anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh come on, the anime had a great OST see</br>  <br>I'll help you out anon</br>     9 years <br>Jesus fucking christ. This show made me feel like a piece of shit then and I was in High School. Worst part is that I didn't learn anything from it, I'm a Hikki NEET. I haven't been outside in almost a year, and probably haven't had human contact in well over two.<br><br>Welcome to Loneliness!<br>https://<span>youtu.be/G4VN0in4weA  [ ]</br></br></br></br>    <br>nice gifs anon</br>  <br>Thanks</br>          <br> Slavshit </br>      The Misaki bullying moments were my favorite part of the show.<br><br>When Misaki thinks Satou is cheating with Hitomi, that even a worthless NEET like him has a better girl than her.</br></br>  does anyone finds Misaki plain as hell?    <br>n-no bully anon</br>  <br>That's a large part of her appeal.</br>  <br>isn't that why people like her<br><br>she's nothing more than a boring suicidal girl</br></br></br>    <br>honestly i love her even more because of this.</br>      have you guys accepted Misaki as your goddess and savior?  would you?  <br>Pretty much the same than now, only difference is that 9 years ago I had dreams and hopes, now all that has die and I found no reason to live, despite that I keep waking up, going to work, and then coming back home only to repeat the same thing over and over till my body just can't keep going, anime is fun though.</br>  How's the author doing? I only know about his letter of him giving up and taking VN money. But sure thatmoney is gone by now.  <br>Exactly when do your hopes and dreams die? Do you know, anon?</br>  the other day i was lurking out nhk content and i noticed this content on the manga vol1 that was released recently by viz.<br><br>was this on the original?</br></br>  <br>He seemed like he was doing fine for awhile based on his twitter, sadly it looks like he deleted his account though.</br>  Did she get raped or something? Why is she such a emo cunt?  You know, I'm a huge HikkiNEET and I thought the show was pretty boring and it never actually depressed me.<br>Maybe I just never related to the MC.</br>  <br>i think he was ashamed for asking donations. he's not better than before, but has money to survive for a good couple of years.</br>  <br>It's because you're a sociopath</br>  <br>Sadly, I don't, and I don't even know why, that's just how things are I guess. there was just a moment when I stopped thinking in those things.</br>  <br><br>Is there any info about his situation?</br></br>  <br>How long have you been a NEET? if less then a year I understand why this was boring to you.<br><br>He was living on the royalties though, isn't this the dream?</br></br></br>  i forgot to mention that i talked to him once  <br>No just autistic.</br>  <br>That's actually really adorable</br>  <br>i tried to contact him this year after his new project, he never replied ;_;</br>  <br> Going on 4 years now. </br>  <br>going for  6  years here</br>  <br><br><br>Serious question.<br><br>How are you guys not bored.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not too late!</br>  <br>i think after the 2 year mark it's like months, i lost the sense of time</br>  <br> question <br> doesnt put a question mark <br>That's just a statement.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm mostly anhedonic. I just do things that keep my attention.</br>  <br>how are you getting by?</br>  <br>Keyboard's fucked up.<br><br><br><br><br>But don't you get crushed when people around you move on and you are dead weight?  It's not too late. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  if you NEETs are living off your parents money then why don't you just use it to go to college?<br><br> that's what I did </br></br>  <br>   It's not too late <br>It's not a question of time anon.</br></br>  <br> 5  years over here  Still haven't told my parents that I dropped out of college in the first month </br>  <br>It's too hard to express all the repressed anger and suffering from all these years, well i think it's a mix of everything. it's too late trust me anon</br>  <br>No car.</br>  <br><br>You're so fucked, your only scapegoat is to find a job.<br><br><br><br>I wouldn't know yes, but I know you're gonna snap someday.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i don't think I'll go full elliot but yeah a snap is possible, but i would prefer a planned but it's too hard to follow through until the end i suppose</br>   this thread <br> pls now get out</br>  Jesus Christ this was a depressing thread. Grow some balls stop acting like teenagers and get a fucking job if you're so depressed fuck.  <br> how are you getting by? <br>Like food and water and stuff? I order stuff like ramen from amazon. It gets shipped directly my house.<br><br><br>Go back to reddit if you don't remember NEET/Ronery threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_Ei<wbr>2izPLpHc</wbr>  [ ]  <br>if only it were that easy</br>  <br> Same situation except it's 3 years for me. Though I'll have to come out in a few days since I've been asked to provide proof that I'm attending it for medical insurance. I'm fucked. </br>  I'd say life was better 9 years ago for me.<br>Back then I was a kid. I was overweight and probably chuuni-shit being a sperg and all but I had a few friends and wasn't bullied much. Had time for games, reading, all that stuff too and had a decent amount of fun at summer camp in the summer despite being a fat fuck.<br><br>Then there were the hours browsing the net, staying up late and enjoying it, all sorts of novel things that are banal now. <br><br>Since then while I've come a far way from anything even remotely close to chris-chan level autism, I've been living/fighting with major depression for the past 5 years and am going back to my 5th year of a university that I don't fit in at and won't have any friends at starting this August. <br><br>Satou's life hits entirely too close to home for me especially as I'll be as old as him come right when I start back to university. So it goes though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Why not better stuff? A pure diet of ramen's going to kill you eventually.</br>  <br><br>But you're not overweight now, so you're better.</br></br>  <br> Satou's life hits entirely too close to home for me especially as I'll be as old as him come right when I start back to university. So it goes though. </br>  <br> A pure diet of ramen's going to kill you eventually. <br>That's the plan.</br></br>       blogshit   Oh well I guess I'll rewatch the series in celebration. <br> I'm going to go buy some instant ramen and chips to have some snacks. it's going to be the first time going outside in 2 months, I'm a little excited </br>  Reminder.  <br>Oh I am again. Really ballooned up over the last years when I started college but I've been working on losing what I (re)gained the past 7 months.<br><br>It's a one day at a time sort of thing really. Some days are decent, hell some are even good once in a great while now but it's a slow upward trail with lots of level ground and even a few downward slopes on the way up to the summit. <br><br>I'd suggest anyone in this thread who can consider therapy or something. Exercise, therapy, medicine, a combination of the three, whatever. I've found over the last few months that even having a third party to talk to and help work out problems with can be a big help if depression's your major downer.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>i did therapy for more than 2 years with medication, ran out of money and that was it. nothing changed but maybe i guess they help somehow in long term.</br>  <br>I like computers and am constantly finding new hobbies.</br>  How do you guys kill time?  <br>Kill time until what?</br>  <br>What you even mean by that? I got a job, and nothing have changed, I guess I still need the cute girl falling from the sky.</br>  <br>It can only be damaged by chemicals like weed and alcohol. They have a nasty side-effect of aging you though.</br>  <br>I still haven't watched this show, even after all these years. Is it worth watching now, even if I'm not a NEET?</br>  <br>It is that easy. I'm sure if half the "incurable hikikomori" in this thread were cutoff from daddy's money and internet they'd have a job in a week.</br>  <br>Especially if you aren't a NEET. <br>I think anyone should watch it. It's a decent look at mental illness in its many forms. Something that a lot of people need to know a lot more about.</br></br>  <br> I dropped out of a fairly good engineering program because I can't function if I don't have a place where I can be alone. </br>  <br>sleeping first, eating, watching tv, some seasonal anime, some flash games or emulators, creating new personas on internet, fapping, i don't know but sleeping or being in bed more than 12 hours is a must.</br>  <br>I feel you. That's all I can say</br>  Kind of the same. I was  homeschooled  so I'm used to staying inside all day everyday. <br><br>Only difference was I thought once I finished school I'd be out of here but that isn't the case. It also looks like things won't change for some time.</br></br>  <br>You got a job and are still miserable?<br><br>Congratulations, welcome to adulthood like the rest of us.</br></br></br>  <br>probably</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127805774 <br> enjoying life <br>What wizardry is this</br></br>  <br>I get money for my disabilities from the government</br>  <br>And the other half would end up dead or on the streets.</br>  <br>Sleep, eat, watch anime, play vidya, read books. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.</br>  <br>Its impossible to get a job without experience so no they probably wouldn't.</br>  <br>You can be "cured" of NEETdom while still having the social retardation and lack of ability to function adequately in society. I'd say being NEET is a symptom of that, so you're still not really solving the underlying problem.<br><br>But it's just a guess.</br></br></br>  <br>The girl won't fall from the sky brother, she will materialize in front of your eyes.<br>Just hang in there, she's coming SOON</br></br>  <br>I have a job Anon. Nothing changes when you earn your own money. If anything it goes downhill.</br>  <br>You just gotta learn Japanese so you can play all the glorious hentai games. That's what I'm doing.</br>  <br>Those fucking nips man.</br>  <br><br>Boy what if VR actually helps with social interactions, so ironic.</br></br>  <br> an experience you've never had before <br>They know their audience. <br><br>Kaiki's spiel aside, I'm not sure if I could be completely content with VR.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will she materialize in glorious 2D form as well? If so I think I can hold up a little while.</br>  <br>Reminds me of Mr. Mosquito for some reason.</br>  <br>I'd probably end up homeless.<br> I have a legitimate mental illness that prevents me from working </br></br>  Reminder that Welcome to the NHK flopped very badly in Japan (it couldn't even average 800 DVDs sold, no joke), and neither the anime nor the novels were ever popular in Japan. It's more popular in America than in Japan.  <br>there's a technology called Live2d, look into it. 2d waifus in a 3d interactive environment so us fleshies can finally cross the gap between dimensions</br>  <br>too expensive</br>  <br>It's finally time.</br>  <br>Well of course. They have shit taste, Etotama ended up doing badly even though it was a damn good show.</br>  <br>I used to feel alive. Now I don't feel anything. I don't get mad at anyone, I don't get happy at anything, nothing surprises me, I don't feel sad.I just feel empty and void.</br>  <br>Japan does not matter</br>  <br> Japan does not matter <br>It does if you want more of your favorite series.</br></br>  <br>friendly reminder that Misaki is a big fat nigger</br>  <br>They seem to be mostly animated in Korea these days.</br>  <br>People who couldn't relate don't care about the anime, and people who could relate felt it hit too close to home.<br><br>Japanese otaku are a sensitive group when it comes to their own situations.</br></br></br>  <br>I would this Misaki.</br>  <br>Nobody likes looking in the mirror at their own shortcomings. It's why cute girls and harems are so popular, because everyone knows they'll never have a harem and cute girls aren't real, so they want to escape into an anime where they are. Getting slapped in the face with reality is not a good feeling.</br>  <br>the girls in that game were strangely attractive<br><br>thing with these demos is they're not really all that hi-tech, they use only existing technology iirc, but the character models look really appealing, it's that wizardry that manages to avoid the dreaded uncanny valley</br></br></br>  <br>her pose and her hair are great but i don't think i would be capable of</br>  <br>forgot muh webum</br>   tfw NHK is far smarter than you fags realized <br><br>Look into Semitic religion if you want your 'evil' God, it's not just edgy storywriting</br></br>  <br> What is it?

What the hell that almost made me cry. Why ?</br>  <br>And this is why i have to hero sooner or later. why not soon before things get worse?</br>  <br>I'd say the only wait it really hit close to home was the speeches that were essentially author tracts.<br><br>With Kaiji you have teh benefit of him being an incredibly lazy idiot whenever his life isn't on the line, which is what conveniently leads to his life being on the line.</br></br></br>  <br>i love her hair but why always blonde?</br>   tfw you will never have a real-life Misaki who falls in love with you, saves you from the hikkimori and starts a happy family with you just like in the anime and novel   <br>REMINDER</br>  <br>So he's describing /pol/?<br><br>"Consider, for example, the process by which The Jewish Conspiracy: theory comes to be: The author has multiple, terrible complexes and feelings, such as, "Why am I poor?"; "Why is my life not more comfortable?"; "Why can I not find a girlfriend?" His mind and body constantly are pressured, from both within and without. <br>Those pent-up grudges become endless feelings of hatred toward society. They become rage. <br>However, the largest source of rage is his own personal cowardice. <br>He is poor because he lacks the skill with which to earn money. He has no girlfriend because he lacks charisma. But the process of seeing <br>this truth and acknowledging his own incompetence requires quite a bit of courage. No human beings, regardless of who they might be, want to look directly at their own shortcomings. At this point, the conspiracy theorist projects his cowardice onto the <br>outside world. He creates a fictitious "enemy" outside of himself. <br>Enemy. My enemy. Society's enemy. <br>"Because an enemy conspires to do evil, I cannot find happiness. <br>Because of this conspiracy, I cannot find a girlfriend. That's right! This is all because of the Jews. Because the Jews are scheming away out there, <br>I can't find happiness. Damn you, Jews! I won't forgive you!" <br>Truthfully, this kind of thinking also inconveniences Jewish people. <br>All conspiracy theorists need to look a little more closely at reality. <br>"Enemies" don't exist externally. "Evil" does not exist externally. One <br>has to assume blame oneself for being a worthless person. <br>It's definitely not a Jewish conspiracy, nor a CIA conspiracy, and— obvious as this may be—it's not an alien conspiracy. Before all else, one needs to keep this fact firmly in mind while living one's life."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw she will never support you when you get a shitty job <br> tfw you will never see her beautiful smile </br></br>  <br>9 years ago i was too busy pursuing my dreams.I played football back then and i had good grades.

I'd get in fights with him until I was sent to juveile hall then I spent the rest of my childhood in a group home with violent mexicans.</br>  <br> wouldn't play on MPC <br>dropped</br></br>  Anyone has Misaki autograph here?  <br>luckily there's another release that does, but it has piss yellow subs, so yeah pick your poison<br><br> NHK will never be released on BD <br> even if it did it would have all that QUALITY they didn't bother to fix for the DVD <br>fucking aerly digital anime, it was like the 5th gen of vidya for graphics</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>oh wow, I pulled it off for about two and a half years, It was nice to have roommates tho, but i got mad jelly that two of them got laid way too often</br></br>  My parents are making me go to community college because they're trying to break my NEETdom. They're going to kick me out unless I go. Is it possible to do 12 hours of online community college a week? I don't care if I fail, I just don't want my NEETdom to end yet, because I want to finish Working season 3 and play Persona 5. After that I can die.  <br>w-what is this?</br>  <br>Is that the oyasumi release? Because it plays on my MPC just fine.</br>   239 replies <br> 46 posters <br>Misakifags are too delusional</br></br>  <br><br>Just go, not so hard. Do it for Persona 5.</br></br>  <br>Oyasumi's hardsubbed release as well as Exiled-Destiny's DVD rip will both play in MPC. Reminder that even the DVD ISO's look terrible, also NHK is interlaced.</br>  <br> I live in Mississippi, it'll more than likely be 80-90% black people </br>   get a shitty job, preferably in a restaurant or somewhere you have to interact with people <br> practice your social skills <br> eventually make friends with your coworkers, go out with them after work <br> get promoted if you have more capability and work ethic than a sub-saharan ape <br><br>You now have money and a social life.

A CUTE  <br>That only works if you're interested in norman stuff. I did all of that but I couldn't give a single fuck about drugs, sports,"I'd ravage that ass", and parroting what I see on tv and the internet.</br>  <br> I couldn't give a single fuck about drugs <br>There is a vice for everyone, you just haven't found it yet.</br></br>   mfw I'm nearly Satou's age and my life is going nowhere     <br>They hate myself</br>  <br> dude </br>  <br>Hey, that quality's not terrible. Is it hard or soft-subbed?</br>  I was depressed in high school with a mentally and emotionally abusive ex who brought the worst out in me.<br><br>I'm   happily married to someone who treats me well and watches Chinese cartoons with me  </br></br>    <br>doesn't work if you're naturally an asshole  like I am <br>Fuck pretending to be friendly just to fit in among idiots</br></br>  <br>It's not so simple.

So exactly the same as right now.  <br>alfa male satou giving zero cucks</br>  <br>That's terrible advice. Friendship is about reciprocity, bring something to the table even if it's just a personality people like being around or a good sense of humor.

Hell, you probably could ace every class with barely any additional effort.</br>  <br>you are not alone anon.</br>  Pretty terrible, I took this show to heart broke my hiki ways. I made friends, have a large social group, go to parties every weekend. Yet despite being what most people would call a normal fag I feel worse than I ever have. It's like I just want to be left alone to die. Everyone always wants to hang out with me and do things with me but it feels like everytime i leave the house i have to put on a barely functioning human suit and act the way everyone thinks I am. The only thing that fills the cracks in my suit and makes it believable is alcohol. I feel like bozo the clown in that story where he goes to see a doctor. It just feels like there's no escape from the life ive built and if I wasnt my moms only surviving family member i'd probably kill myself.  <br><br> Barely 26. There was schooling intermittently and even a real job at one point. <br><br>Almost, brothers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it can always go worse</br>  <br> 9 Years </br>  <br> mfw I passed Satou's age and my life is going nowhere. </br>  <br><br>I think you missed the message of the show. The show made me realize that what I'm doing is okay.</br></br>  <br>It's time.</br>  In some ways, my life is significantly better. I've got a steady job that pays alright and I just got a raise. I'm no longer terrified of dealing with people, and I can handle social contact smoothly and just as well as anyone else. I feel like I can actually talk to other people for the first time in my life.<br><br>But in other ways, not much has changed at all. I'm still lonely. I still don't have many friends. And while it's much easier for me to deal with people and make casual conversation, I still have a hard time making friends and forming and sustaining any kind of meaningful social contact. I still spend my weekends alone. I still think of all the things I wish I had done differently.<br><br>But I'm better. And I've been getting better. And this show helped me confront a number of things about myself that I don't think I could have dealt with otherwise. Fucking love NHK.<br><br>The soundtrack is killer, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you need a hug anon?</br>  <br> I still spend my weekends alone <br>T-this isn't normal?</br></br>  Reminder: productive NEETs are happier than NEETs who don't do anything  <br> you just haven't found it yet. <br>I have. It's called anime.<br><br>There's been couple of times where I made up some shit about how I still had work to do when my colleagues ask me to join them watch some games, just so that I can watch anime at home instead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. I wouldn't know, honestly. I feel like people at least get out every now and then, but I don't have much of a frame of reference. <br><br>There's also the problem that I still talk to myself more than I talk to other people. Like I'm so starved for real conversation that I have to make it with myself.<br><br>I feel a lot better, but I feel like I can objectively say that I've still got a few screws loose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ugh I joined the military, but I think that made my life worse.</br>    <br> community college <br> hard <br><br>If niggers can do it, you can do it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I filed a form to join the military a year ago, still haven't given them the final papers on my medical check up</br>  <br>This is such a bullshit piece of advice.<br><br>I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a total emotional breakdown that can and will happen at any moment. I get pissed off at the most menial shit. I get sad when I see a cheesy kids toy or a frozen dinner. I casually think of killing myself at least a few times a week. And worst of all, I think of the plane scene from The Dark Knight Rises EVERY FUCKING DAY SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.<br><br>Who the fuck would want to see that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You gotta steam off that anger somehow anon. Maybe get a big marker, make an abstract poster or something.</br>  <br> And worst of all, I think of the plane scene from The Dark Knight Rises EVERY FUCKING DAY SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. <br>You can start by not visiting /tv/ anymore.</br></br>  <br> 27 <br> dropped out of university <br> haven't been in any kind of job since 18 <br> got admitted to psychiatric ward last year for hikkying too hard <br>but im not giving up yet<br><br>im sure misaki will find me one day</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The trick to makeing friends is to force yourself to go out with them. If you keep refusing, you'll eventually lose all your friends like I did.  <br>I haven't been there in forever and I still think about it.<br><br>It's a fucking virus.</br></br></br>  <br>It was complete shit <br><br>it's fine now</br></br></br>  Shut myself in for 3 years now, I still have a friend that checks up on me every now and then asking me if I'd like to hang out. I just ignore him because he's the kind of person that can get along with just about anyone and that doesn't mesh well with my kind of personality (being a shut-in and all). <br>Still, I'm still thankful I have someone like that and I feel I should take him up on his offer sometime (or so I've been thinking for these past few months).</br>  <br>It's really not that hard, at least if you actually do it. Make sure not to just skip all classes and sit in your car in the parking lot and sleep for 8 hours. Wait, you said online. Same thing applies.</br>  <br>you can still shitpost and watch taiwan toons from the loonie bin?<br>where do I sign up</br></br>  <br>If you're not in maintenance it isn't so bad.</br>  You have to work a job that's actually challenging and interesting.<br><br>If you work at Wal-mart of course you'll want to kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>But I don't want to work at all, working means having to take a bath everyday, waking up at a set hour, etc...etc....</br>  <br>No shit. Not everyone has the luxury of getting such jobs. Some people WILL still end up working at Walmart.</br>  <br>Anon, the next time he asks, go for it. It's the first step. Good luck (._.)7</br>  <br>Only the biggest fucking retards work at Wal-mart. This guy is right <br><br>People at entry level jobs do bare minimum to not get fired and get their paycheck to buy their next fix of drugs/alcohol.<br><br>Your manager will be amazed that you actually are willing to do a good job.<br><br>If you show up on time and don't steal company product, you're already ahead of the game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder: productive NEETs are generally happier than people who work<br><br>time &gt; money</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, hopefully I won't pull out at the last minute again.</br>  <br>I think you need a hug, anon</br>  Everyone is self-conscious and eaten away by inner demons.<br><br>The normies just don't realize it, or simply don't let it get to them.</br></br>  9 years ago I was 16 in high school. <br>Now, I'm 25 and working part time in a porn store.  From 12am to 8am </br>  <br>Do they stock dragon dildos?</br>  <br>No animal dildos of any kind. <br> Longest is the double sided 18". Thickest is the AMERICAN CHALLENGE at 6". </br></br>  <br>What size do women usually buy?</br>  <br>Most people distract themselves enough to never face them.</br>  <br> twice <br> once <br> twice <br>Novel&gt;Anime&gt;Manga<br><br><br>Don't you know? Japan has the worst taste in anime. I thought it was a given at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally ANY.<br>Everyone, man AND woman, is a different size. Be it outside or inside.<br><br> Men buy 9"ers in bulks, though. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, fuck, I know the American Challenge. The Christian girls at my old college used to go there and look at it as a sort of rite of initiation into some Christian club. No idea why. Dead serious.</br>  <br> No idea why. Dead serious. <br><br>Hazing.<br>They were being hazed.</br></br></br></br>  I'm such an idiotic piece of shit that I had to look up a synopsis to make sense of the last episode. Luckily I understood most of it, I just wasn't sure if  Satou actually believed in the NHK and was really hallucinating or if he was just trying to give Misaki something to blame her troubles on .<br><br>Unfortunately, despite identifying with Satou, I didn't feel much towards the end. At first I thought it was going to be a life-changing experience for me but then it basically turned into 'lol just get a job and it'll be ok' and that really pissed me off.</br></br>  <br>No, it's more like "Just get a job and strat working yourself out of that petty life instead of waiting for someone to save you".</br>   NHK thread <br>Nice<br> Misaki thread <br>Noice<br> thread infested with frogshit and feels niggers <br>Thanks /r9k/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 'lol just get a job and it'll be ok' <br>It's actually kinda ambiguous cause Satou could revert back to hikkikomori in the future. Anime Satou had it better cause Misaki is still on his side. Novel Satou on the other hand...</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? Novel Satou also has Misaki.</br>  <br>I kind of remember she went back to school and left Satou or something. Sorry, been a while since I read it.</br>  <br> They're going to kick me out unless I go. Is it possible to do 12 hours of online community college a week? <br>fuck the online shit, it's just way too easy to blow it off. just go to live college. you don't even have to associate with anyone. just go, sit in the classroom, and write down everything the teacher says in a notebook. you don't need to feel self-conscious, everyone is a failure just like you. <br><br>after class, you go straight back home and finish watching shit anime like you planned. you'll see the whole thing only takes a few hours from your day, two or three times a week at most, and you'll get a B. if you actually do homework you'll get straight A's. seriously, professors are not allowed to fail entire classes, so they dumb the shit down hard and do things like add 10 points to everyone's final grade at the end, so even the lowest white trash who struggled through high school can pass.</br></br></br></br>  I'm better now, I have a job I enjoy. travel is a bitch though  <br>Online is actually better for the socially inept.<br><br>Save yourself the commute, and save yourself the time.<br>The time you spend driving to school can be spent watching anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And then what? Unless you manage to get job exclusively from your house with minimal contact with anyone, you're really just delaying the inevitable.</br>  <br>Simple<br><br> I stopped giving a shit and I may as well milk it for what its worth.  </br></br></br>  What's a painless way to die?  Imagine if /a/ had mods.  <br>Not dying</br>    <br>For you, anon.</br>   How was your life 9 years ago? <br>About a year away from becoming a NEET, maybe four from becoming hiki.<br><br> How is your life now? <br><br>HikiNEET<br><br>Misaki never came.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was a NEET and I am still a NEET. I'm too old to get a job now and have no idea what to do with my life, so I watch anime so I can forget about reality.  <br> NHK was 9 years ago <br>holy fuck it's been 9 years?<br><br>what have i been doing with my life?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have a partner and near full time job and every day is like I'm constantly screaming in my head. That was after about 5 years from the age of 16 as a shut in.<br><br>I empathise with Satou at the end of the novel, it's not that he or I ever became a normie, it's how long you wonder you can keep saying "How long can I go like this?".</br></br></br>  <br>It's not too late anon, keep fighting, there's always a happy ending in sight.</br>  <br><br>"happy ending"<br><br>read the book<br><br>there is no happy ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know, not too bad. This was my first anime, and it hit home really well, since I was just starting to fall into some massive issues. I had just returned from europe and about 2 years of not meeting anyone new. I was at school, but beyond that, i was pretty much alone all the time. And then I hit rock bottom. Right now, Im rooming with the guy who helped me through that, and I am doing better, though its mostly due to the fact that I am busy, and that I need to pay people money.<br><br>But beyond that, still plenty of worries about myself, like my ability to relate to others.<br>But its doing fine enough, no panic attacks.<br>No misaki either, but shes a nutcase too, so ones mileage may vary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>parenting is only one of the reasons, friends and genetics are also big factors</br>  <br>Do you still make those nhk streams?<br>I always enjoyed those.</br></br>   wake up at 6 30 <br> go to work <br> come home exhausted <br> complete silence <br> try and have fun, too tired, sick of everything <br> afraid to sleep again because it means im gonna have to wake up at 6 30 again <br> this is going to keep happening until my body breaks <br><br>Yeah moving out of my parents basement and getting a job was such a great idea normies :DDDD</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Life sucked in a different manner  <br>That's a lot of projecting.</br>  <br>Is there good anime on the other side?</br>  <br>0 friends then and now. I had some I think in between those 9 years. Now I'm litterally Sato(22, friendless NEET, KV)<br>My chest hurts<br>I want misaki to console my feels<br>I have  court friday </br></br></br></br>  I remember about a year ago, when Misaki was my waifu. <br><br>She was all I could think about all day, and I spend a lot of time collecting pictures of her and stuff.<br><br>Well, that was the past.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had just graduated high school and was a freshmen in college. Man, if I had any idea what awaited me I would have dropped out of college and started working my way up the corporate ladder earlier.</br>  Looks like I'm late, happy 9th NHK.<br><br>Anons, if you could go back in time, would you change anything? <br><br>What would you do to change it?</br></br></br></br>  It's fucking 9 years and people are still talking about this?<br><br>Misaki is never going to come, anon.. It's been 9 years and she's probably busy fucking chad's thundercock by now.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she's more likely to have either committed suicide or be in some psychiatric ward.</br>  <br>Jesus fuck this came out 9 years ago?.... What.... where has all my time gone... WHY AM I STILL IN THE SAME PLACE...</br>  <br><br>No, she's going to go back to school, get hit on by chad because she's a qt 3.14, grow her hair out, and start dating.<br><br>Come to think about it,<br><br> which character from another anime would Misaki be in 9 years? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>9 years ago? Good.<br><br>Now I smoke shard, drink like a Irishman and have a mountain of unboxed figures and dakimakura covers. It's fucking great.  I'll be dead in two years though. Sage. </br></br></br>  <br> go back to school <br> start dating <br>A crazy person doesn't just go non-crazy. Stop being as delusional as the Misaki fags.</br></br></br>  So I watched this back in 2006.<br><br>I was in College. Did my homework and watched anime. I saved this onto two DVDs. I saved alot of other things to DVDs like Kenshin, Air, Code Geass, and many more.<br><br>Fast forward to 2010. I moved all my anime to big 2TB harddrives.<br><br>Fast forward to 2015. I moved all that anime to my personal file server.<br><br>It's the same Welcome to the NHK anime I downloaded from 2006.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B-but dubs</br>  <br>Even if I could go back in time I feel like I would just repeat my shitty life.</br>  <br>NHK and Misaki threads are always gonna be feels and blogs shit.<br>Not that it bothers me and I actually quite enjoy them...</br></br>  <br>9 years ago - Last year of highschool, full of hopes and dreams going to college.<br><br>Present - Recently terminated, finding a job. Goddamn reality. My materialistic desire is what keeps me from giving up.</br></br></br>  Welp since I'm on the road to become a NEET might as well rewatch this  <br>I'm not sure if there's much I could change in all honesty. It's always easy enough to say "I'd study real hard and go to a good college, acquire a talent/skill etc etc" but anything short of that, no, I don't think so.<br><br>Also this thread has made me want to go back and rewatch the series. I remember the years ago I first watched it I used Oyasumi subs (which you can't even get on nyaa) that came with pic related in the torrent. What's /a/'s opinion on them? I tried Exiled Destiny and holy shit bright yellow subs in the middle of the screen are killing it for me.</br></br></br>  <br>I was 16 so I was miserable</br>  <br>Did someone say Oyasumi Subs?</br>   o-ohayo everyone   <br>Yes. I remember them pretty fondly for having liberal use of TL Notes, but it's been so long and I have a hard time believing that the best release is Exiled Destiny or Oyasumi</br>  i might do a rewatch thread tomorrow on /r9k/ if anyone is interested, the problem is i don't know which website should i use, last time i used tinychat, it was ok but not the best.  I scorned everything Japanese and hated weeaboos. Now I'm learning the language and following shows as they air.  got a job interview today,lets see if i can beat my NHK.<br>Been listening to the Ost all morning<br>I do alright i suppose i like how satou picked himself up at the end of the anime as everyone he knew got distant. saw the series around 2years ago around. the end of HS. <br>i've been so afraid of what the future would bring for me.it made me stagnant and depressed<br>i wanna change. <br>i know theres no immediate way to rid myself from this fear, ill still be down from time to time but it better then being who i was before.</br></br></br></br></br>   How was your life 9 years ago? <br>I had friends and people that I care about<br> how is your life now? <br>I'm my own master now.</br></br></br>  <br>which job are you applying to?<br><br><br> I'm my own master now. <br>it it worth it anon?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>a retail job <br>i figured it was a shot in the dark but they had me follow up for an interview.</br></br>  what happened to /a/? these threads didn't even hit the image limit  <br>will you be able to communicate with other people?</br>  <br> How was your life 9 years ago? <br>It was alright back then about to start high school.<br><br> How is your life now? <br>23 year old 4 year NEET approaching 5th<br><br>Now it's been difficult.

My life consisted of playing vidya and watching whatever was on toonami, or maguzi at that point I can't remember. Happy as a clam.<br><br> How is your life now? <br>25 and in graduate school, living on my own in another state from my family, and supporting myself. About two more years till I have the PhD.

While I was taking a neetyear out because I didn't get to do the course I wanted to do, I watched NHK and it really inspired me to better myself.<br><br>Waiting isn't going to do anything guys, even if there was a Misaki who wanted to save you she'd only be doing it for her own interests.

I didn't learn one language, I don't have a topic that I can say I'm knowlagable, I didn't pick up one instrument, I didn't befriend anyone. I wasted my most precious years just watching anime and shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Study math you little faggot, you think you're cool by not giving a fuck about your education, but it's going to bite you in the ass. <br>Yes this. I have to catch up now and work my ass off because I was a lazy little shit</br></br>  <br>How old are you?</br>  <br> 100k debt at the bank <br> still paying rent <br>Please tell me that's yen and not dororu</br></br></br>  <br>That would be around 30k usd in my 3rd world country's currency.</br>  <br>You could have learned some stupid language or acquire great knowledge about useless things and it will be the same. <br>The only important thing it's learning about shomething that gives you money.</br></br>  <br><br> 9 years ago <br>Easier, more fun<br><br> now <br>Waiting for a Misaki to come and save me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was in college (studying art) living a hikki lifestyle in a room with no furniture when NHK aired.<br>Since then, got 2 steady jobs, a gf of 7 years (she's religious, lol), and studying programming at the moment as of now. Life has been good to me.</br></br>  <br>I have a job Anon. But the fact that I didn't improve myself as a human being in my most productive years just makes me really, extremely mad. Whenever I think about the past and see I didn't do one thing that I can say I'm proud of, something that I can just say "Yeah I'm really glad I started doing that." makes me just cry in despair.</br>  <br><br>Japan was fantastic, best year of my life. My Japanese is not that good and I never learned to read properly.<br><br>When I first arrived in Japan most of the girls I saw were attractive and had the personalities I was looking for (just like my chinese cartoons), but the more time I spent around Japs the more used I got to their faces and the better I could distinguish their features. Now Japanese girls don't look all that attractive to me anymore... unfortunately. <br><br>I did date a few girls but the relationships felt shallow, all I can say is it takes time to find the right one.<br><br><br><br>27</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 27 <br> did all that shit <br><br>Here I am, 22 years old and I have nothing and just starting university</br></br></br></br>  <br> I have a job Anon. <br>Then you're in better situation than most of us. <br>I have two degrees, i learned about lots of stupid shit and i feel absolutely useless. <br><br>The only thing that really motivates me to learn it's drawing and just because i have an stupid delusion about being a comic artist, but it will be the same shit as always. <br><br>So be proud of having a job, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, three degrees in what?</br>  <br>Same. I was constantly dropping out of schools and was a NEET in between nine years ago. I still pretend to start studying once or twice a year now, but I've held a part time job for two years and it's just enough work to keep me slightly busy and pay the bills, but not to make me crazy as 40 hour weeks did in the past. It's a customer service job and I can act like a decent human being there although the behavior doesn't carry outside the job. I still spend my free time with anime, video games, imageboards and chatrooms and I have zero real life friends and no permanent online friends, just like a decade ago.</br>  <br>Don't do homeschooling. I have mild regrets about not seeing some of those middle school cuties turn into highschool sluts. Also don't join the army, shoulda just kept my shitty part time job.</br>   [CReep] Gakkou Gurashi! - 01 [1080p].mkv <br><br>Do you think Steppen King would like this anime</br></br>  I want to read a Steppen King book about cute girls doing cute things.<br><br> And then they die, because he can't write good endings unless it takes him 20 years. </br></br>  For sure  <br>Now that it's an anime maybe I'll finally remember everyone's names and not just Yuki and Megu.</br>  <br>That scene after Yuki and Miki leave the roof where the wind starts blowing is eery as fuck, for whatever reason.</br>  So what's next? Will we keep seeing the school through Yuki's eyes? The little bits from the preview didn't look "dark".  <br>The only good endings that Stephen King has written are Carrie and The Shining</br>  <br>Too bad The Shining had a sequel.</br>  <br>I liked how 11/22/63 ended, but he outright admits in the afterword that someone else told him how to end it.</br>  <br>You know it's bad when movies drastically improve the endings to his books (see: The Mist).</br>  <br>King is a huge pleb. So hopefully not, I want it to be good.</br>  <br><br>I was talking about "good" endings in the sense of them being "happy" endings. Most of his stories end with everyone or most of the characters dying.<br><br>Shit, Bag of Bones was ending nicely and then BAM!  they shoot the shit out of MC's waifu. </br></br></br></br>    Is this a Steppen King thread now?  Cujo a cute    yfw Rii channels Annie Wilkes and breaks Shovel's ankles when she eventually turns   <br> What if Taroumarou turns into Cujo? </br>  <br>   Cujo a cute <br>If you think he's cute, then you're going to love Toromaru!</br></br>  <br>Did they change things? That character isn't meant to be introduced yet.</br>  REMOVE CATHAT  <br>Yes, but they're not bad changes. The mangaka is on the anime staff as well so I wouldn't be worried<br><br>Honestly, the first episode of the anime is better than the first manga chapter, at least in terms of the reveal.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they're going to play around with Yuki's senses a bit more in this one ("why does the food smell bad????), which the others will need to explain in various ways.</br>  <br>The anime will be like half original half adaptation, get used to it.</br>  I'll start.    Autism: the MC<br><br>Finally a relatable MC</br></br>  <br>She's just so adorable.</br>  <br>This</br>  Her character feels artificial somehow. I don't know, it's like I can't her as an actual person. I have the same problem with shounen leads like Luffy.  <br><br>Autistic <br><br><br><br>Schizophrenic delusions</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's just so based.</br>  <br>I have a friend who's almost like Hajime, the difference is she's actually going through something big in life</br>  <br>  Autistic <br>  still better than most MC's in all of anime </br></br>  <br>Anon, I don't think an autist can relate to somebody who is the polar opposite of autistic.</br>  <br> friend <br> she <br>You lost me.</br></br></br>  <br> Schizophrenic delusions <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Actually she is insufferable</br>  <br>The fairies anon, they aren't actually there</br>  <br><br>I honestly don't get this show. <br>I made it 6 episodes in and almost fell asleep.</br></br></br>  <br>It must be nice to be alone in this world, anon.</br>  <br>Did you move here straight from reddit yesterday?</br>  Ohana  <br>I'm not sure what the explanation for that screencap is, but not only are the fairies real,  Watashi is also one of them.  In the LN, at least.</br>  <br>I actually did, yes.</br>  She was so refreshing that she even changed Bluetsutsu.  Koto.    <br>Everybody knows alien robots can't see fairies.</br>  <br>The freshest</br>  <br>I just finished watching the first series and I only want to say I hated this little shit. You'd think Mary Sueness and mental retardation would be mutually exclusive, but no. At least she's cute.</br>  <br>Hajime isn't remotely autistic.</br>  <br><br><br>  autism suddenly became a different thing </br></br></br>  <br>I never said she's autistic, just a generic "mental retardation". If we want to be specific she's more of a mix of ADHD and the mental age of a six year old.</br>  <br>Hajime's genki personality is probably not the real deal.<br><br>She apparently repeatedly says something akin to "I hope I can keep thinking that way." in the time leading up to the final confrontation with Katze.</br></br></br>  <br>If this mental retardation can positively change the world, then I wouldn't mind.</br>  <br>Only a retard could misinterpret the character this much.</br>  <br>Preach.</br>  I'm beginning to think that Hajime is putting on a front and has deeper machinations going in her mind. Scenes like this make me think that.  <br>Hajime tends to be extremely sharp about knowing what other people are thinking and extremely skillful in dealing with them. There's nothing of mentally retarded or autistic in her.</br>  <br> just a generic "mental retardation" <br>It's funny how often bunch of shut-ins, actual autists, loners and social outcasts diagnose cheerful outgoing characters with bright outlook on life as mentally ill.<br>Different != broken. I wish anons would realize this.</br></br></br>  <br>The gray feelings marker was ominous as fuck too.</br>  <br>The unchanging gray balloon in the latest episode can be a clue to your thoughts.</br>  <br>They're just too ignorant to even try to understand.</br>  <br><br><br>Well there is also this.<br>Hajime's personality is clearly not "real".<br><br>The question then is "who is Hajime?".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zgv<wbr>wqvamdts</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Cosmo was a fun change of pace. Not that dickrogues are novel in and of themselves.</br>  It's amazing how she can see through other people.<br><br>  Autism <br>  Autistic <br>  Mental Retardation <br><br>I think you're the ones who need to consult a neurologist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not really ominous, since that old man had it gray all the time as well. Just maybe an indication that she's seen some shit.</br>  <br>The fact she's somehow wiser than everyone else is an aspect of the mary sue part I was complaining about before. It changes nothing of the way she acts.<br><br><br><br>Call me ignorant all you want, she is not just "cheerful", she's loud and hyperactive. It might or might not be all there is to her character, but as I said above, it does not change the way she acts. She is an annoying presence on screen, thus I don't like her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's just an indication on how she can't be easily affected or moved by something. Or maybe on how she can't be easily influenced by others.</br>  <br> Call me ignorant all you want, she is not just "cheerful", she's loud and hyperactive. It might or might not be all there is to her character, but as I said above, it does not change the way she acts. She is an annoying presence on screen, thus I don't like her. <br>See, that's completely different from what you were saying before. I can accept that you don't like her because she's loud and hyperactive, but neither of those imply mental retardation or autism.<br><br>Nobody's asking you to like her, but if you say things that are simply wrong you should expect people to disagree with you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that too. If she has to make a conscious effort to be genki then clearly something's going on. This feels like Madoka 2.0 or something.</br>  did she got a boob job?  <br>It looks a tad bigger than the first season, but not really that much of a difference. Or maybe emphasis because of Katze. Or maybe just puberty.</br>  <br> she's somehow wiser than everyone else is an aspect of the mary sue part I was complaining about before <br>She's not wiser. She just acts differently than simple muscle brains who function like robots: SEE ALIEN -&gt; TRANSFORM -&gt; KILL ALIEN -&gt; REPEAT AD NAUSEUM.<br>JJ actually picked her because the muscle brains would be still killing MESSes even now.<br>She's not some cunning general making flawless keikaku to crush her enemies, she just deals with alien trouble same way as she deals with every day ones.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, she did shove an evil alien's soul into her tits.</br>  First episode when?  <br>She's basically treating every situation like how she would in normal everday life.</br>  <br>Already two episodes in, mate. Specifically 00 and 01.</br>  <br>Oh, ok, downloading at the speed of light.</br>  <br>Of course I don't literally see her as a drooling retard, that was more of a hyperbole and standard 4chan banter. I still can't say I associate loudness and hyperactiveness to a brilliant mind.<br><br><br>My problem with that is that her way to deal with everything also always turns out to be the right way.<br>Her attitude is interesting at first, but when she seemingly can do no wrong, it becomes rather tiring and starts to seem more like some sort of omniscience.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hajime awaits you. Ohayou gozaimassssu.</br>  Back on topic.  <br><br>I like how this is canon</br></br>  <br>It stands out mostly because the rest of the team are dysfunctional. They were all pretty messed up.<br><br>Sugane was following the lead of a guy who gets drunk in a room of stuffed animals that resemble his dead species. And is cripplingly afraid of their main enemy.</br></br></br>  <br>Issei, the only harem MC that openly wants to impregnate his ladies.</br>  <br> but when she seemingly can do no wrong, it becomes rather tiring and starts to seem more like some sort of omniscience. <br>You say that as if she solved everything herself.<br>I'd give her credit for 'talking' with MESS but the rest was team effort even if idiots needed a hint or two occasionally.</br></br></br>  <br>All those fucking kids, just all those god damn kids. How will he support that entire mess?</br>  <br>What anons do not realize is that she is the paragon for optimism and hope. She is supposed to be optimistic all the time.<br><br>Just like the enemy was the paragon for despair.<br><br>It is a morality play.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When I read the plot like this it feels so much darker.</br>  <br>He'ss probably just go boostoh if it gets tough.</br>  <br>Hajime was the reason I kept watching "It's Fucking Nothing" The Animation<br><br>Katze was cool, but it barely appeared</br></br></br>  <br>She single-handedly resolved the MESS issue, fixed all of the teams' problems, and effectively dealt with Katze as well. There was a team effort to avert the crisis he wanted to cause, but without Hajime taking the matter in her own hands he would just have come back sooner or later.</br>  She's probably one of the best characters of all time.  <br>And now they're in the show as one. Lucky you</br>  Did Berg make Hajime orgasm?  <br>Did the new season start?</br>  <br>The TV ending was interesting because X, Rui, and the Crowds were the main actors. And Hajime's victory over Katze wasn't even given screentime.<br><br>MESS was minor. Try and talk to alien vs Kill alien. Talk to alien worked! Case closed. J.J. even said MESS may not be a threat.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, two episodes in.</br>  <br>Orgasm from the breast. Thank god for episode 13.</br>  <br>Honestly as far as I understood it, OD beats the shit out of Katze, then Katze goes into hiding and Hajime puts him into her tits.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  It became a Hajime thread.  First season OP and ED were so much better  <br>But be honest, the Gatchaman chant still gets you.</br>  <br>No, she was in pain.</br>  <br>The author just wanted to make a socially experienced person. Sadly, wise people tend to be old and that wouldn't make a good show for kids so they came up with a childish acting wise person. Hence the irritation of people who judge her to have some kind of mental illness.</br>  <br>GATCHA</br>  :&gt;    <br>Do we know anything about her past? Some peppy characters have really grim pasts like Hibiki from Symphogear.</br>  <br>The only thing that I can think of is when she calls her mother in eps 12 and 13 and she says that she's herself no matter what.</br>  <br><br><br><br>How to spot a newfag</br></br></br></br>  She makes me feel so genki everytime.  What would it be like to marry such a genki girl?  <br>newfag knows how to get back in topic though</br>  <br>You'll never experience a dull moment in your life.

Do they face off against some sort of stereotypical German team ?<br><br>Something like this maybe ?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RmZ<wbr>erX7Agkw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>LT vz 38 was developed from TNH tank. The initial prototype. So they are not the same. TNH was lighter and had different armament.<br>Pz 39 aka LTH is moreover based on LTL tank, which was smaller and even lighter than TNH.<br><br>Ironically enough, the very LTL tank never entered service as it was meant, thanks to Soviet annexation of Lithuania, and was later redesigned into LT-40 for Slovakia.</br></br></br></br>  <br> what is foreshadowing since episode motherfucking one? </br>  <br>Different info that I had. Thanks.</br>  <br>I want to know how much of a stereotype they will be.<br>I get the idea behind the teams but it's hard to point this shit out when you are German.</br></br>  This is more /ak/ then gup but author of mcyumi took a turn for the worst, cancer is now preventing muscle regeneration.

Why must life kill everyone who make something I enjoy?  <br>You are welcome.<br><br>Some sources apparently can't tell apart TNH from THNP.</br></br></br>  <br>*TNHP<br><br>But in their defense, development of that tank and its variants was very complicated.</br></br></br>        <br>god dammit Mako</br>  <br>how can anzu do that to anyone when they will be like twice the size of her?</br>  <br> how much of a stereotype they will be. <br>fucking see<br><br>Really, Anon. Not being a dick. That's the actual answer right here in front of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Constant near misses are historically accurate, while also being good for drama. Remember that almost all shots in GuP are taken on the move on a moving target which is never a good way to actually hit something.<br><br>Also that, again for the sake of drama, the tanks are faster that real life across the board while the tank engagements are usually closer than they would have been.</br></br></br></br>  <br> thinking size matters in GuP </br>  <br>My point is that I am German. I can't really tell what's parody and what not because I am German.<br><br>I see the portrayal of the Soviets and the Americans and British and that's nice and so forth but with subs this shit is impossible to figure out for me. I just want to know what non-aryans think about it.</br></br></br>  <br> actually realistically expected result <br> plot armor <br>Choose one. It would be plot armor if you were depicting a character standing in the open in front of multiple automatic weapons at 10 meters and somehow not being mowed down (every Rambo movie, I'm looking in your general direction). But if you're depicting WW2 tanks firing on the move, they actually hitting anything would be... unexpecetd. Kindly notice not only , but even the very thread caped in the post you quote actually comments on that.<br><br><br> speed <br>To make it a bit more specific: the tanks are SAID to be moving at their real historical speed (example, episode 8, they're said to be going 20 Km/h), yet they are DEPICTED as if they were moving at roughly twice as fast for aestetics purposes. They don't give some tanks "boots of seven leagues" and not to others.<br><br><br>also<br><br>Of course the depiction of German-themed school is stereotipical as fuck. That's the series' whole point. Have you seen the British, American, English and Italian-themed schools? The later one has PIZZA as their logo, for fucking fuck's shake! <br> non-aryans <br>Unless you're a X-century BC Hindu (in which case, कैसे आप वास्तव में इंटरनेट का उपयोग कर रहे हैं?), you also are one, m8.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Lewds incoming, not for the faint of heart  Happy Birthday, Orange Pekoe!(July 10)  <br> aryans <br>History team, pls  stay </br></br>  <br>What?
