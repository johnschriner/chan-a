[ Would anyone be up for a dump of some chapters?    Go on  <br>Got volume 2?</br>  List 3 things you disliked about this  I reminded me of that one zoid sprue that I messed up once on.  <br><br>(About the show)<br>Only one: No Jackhammer</br></br></br>  The EMIYA battle was too drawn out and not flashy enough<br><br>No Jackhammer<br><br>Not enough Gil</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was generic battle shonen trash that looked VERY pretty<br><br>Inner thoughts cannot be cut, they cut all character development if they do that.</br></br></br>  Dolphins<br>Rhinos<br>Everything else</br></br>  Episode 18 had some shoddy animation<br>Character designs looked weird sometimes<br>they didn't have sex<br><br>Truth be told though I love the show. I'm not gonna say it's the greatest anime ever, but I don't remember ever getting invested into one like it. I've never watched a single episode of a show 10 times in a week before UBW.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those circuits look like rock candy<br>I want to eat it.</br></br>  <br>Shirou was a pretty terrible main character.<br>It wasn't as good as Zero.<br>Gil was barely relevant.</br></br></br>  <br> i'm totally out of mana guise,I really am I swear </br>  Gil wasn't pressured enough during final battle.<br>Tried to make Gil save face instead of being butthurt.<br>Needs more Seiba</br></br>  Chapter 67 is out, I didn't see a thread about it. Discuss  <br>what are you on about? It's already up to 71.</br>  <br>wait what? RAWS? its showing 67 on Bato.to</br>  <br>So is the water god really dead?</br>  <br>71 just had its final good cut released. We read the rough copy like a month ago. Waiting on 72 is the hot new thing</br>  <br>yup</br>   water loli and kiriha is dead <br>FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK</br>  <br>I hope  black lolis end up winning. <br><br>Also what the fuck is wrong with you captcha burgers aren't sandwiches.</br></br></br>  <br> burgers aren't sandwiches <br>They call them sandwiches on american tv shows all the time. I dont get why it always has to be food captcha though, a lot of food looks similar. Use stuff like houses, cars, animals, etc<br><br>Also if kiriha doesn't come back i fukken riot</br></br></br></br>  <br>If the author doesn't bring them back,  he has real balls </br>  <br>Don't encourage him. I can see kukuri staying dead but not kiriha, it was too sudden and not as satisfying as the badass god fight to the death</br>  <br> Chapter 67 is out <br>Are you from different timeline?<br>Also, wtf with this sorting...</br></br></br>  <br>I sometimes forget how bad my dyslexia is</br>  What's this talk of people being dead, I don't remember tsugomomo to be a particularly violent manga.  <br>Read it again nigger</br>  <br> Waiting on 72 is the hot new thing <br>2-3 more weeks at least. Also, chapter 79 should be out in Japan already, so I hope we get scans on this week.</br></br>  <br> 2-3 more weeks for 72 <br>Suffering</br></br>  I expect resurrection sheanigans, otherwise this is going in a pretty dark direction.  <br>My first thought was hourglass shota turning back time on confetti box</br>  Kanaka expects a lot from Kazuya.<br><br>The monthly wait is horrible.</br></br>  <br> sudden arc about a seige on yomi <br><br>Yes.<br><br> leaves almost no chance for hijinks <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It can't be helped - I working on scans alone (and at this point I prefer to stay it this way). A week for cropping and everything, one-two on cleaning and typesetting plus some time for partial redrawing for alpha.</br>  <br>Dont worry, there's still hijinks in the flashbacks, just a slightly different cast. Its still super interesting</br>  <br> Its still super interesting <br>Oh yeah!</br></br>   mangaka's cat dies <br> he powers on drawing cute little toes on black obi loli in a bath scene <br>Truely a god amongst men</br></br>  <br> mangaka's cat dies <br>For real?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he said it after coming back from a break. Chat was filled with condolences (well as far as google translate said. Its entirety possible they were calling him a gay cunt knowing Google)</br>  I got behind on this series, did flute girl revive yet?  <br>Not in this arc</br>  <br>inb4 resurrected with stone shard</br>  <br> I don't remember tsugomomo to be a particularly violent manga. <br>hell is wrong with you?</br></br>  <br>I want to do bad things to her.</br>  <br>Prime  weaving  material</br>  <br><br>Pillow is best girl</br></br>  <br>Literally everyone is best girl. Even the boys are best girls. Kazuya's dad is moe as fuck</br>  <br>except book worm</br>  <br>Completely forgot about her. Bookworm is a shit</br>  <br><br>But (s)he can draw best girls.</br></br>  <br><br> Book worm <br> Who?</br></br></br>   create manga popular because of cute girls <br> kill off the cute girls <br> expect to remain popular <br>I wish I knew moon so I could call him a faggot in his native language.</br></br></br>  <br>Hes still got most of the girls. Plus the plot it neat and art is god tier</br>  <br>is a he, also his battle station is neat as fuck<br><br><br>childhood friend <br><br><br>if you want loli go for Mirror<br><br><br>obi will be revived, is the main heroin, and Water God, I think something will be pulled out...or they make Fire God the new MC goddess</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> expect to remain popular <br>The ending is near, so he can do whatever he want and don't care much about popularity or being axed.</br></br>  <br> childhood friend <br>I thought you talked about other book worm...</br></br>  <br>thats not even a girl...unless you take gender bend dreams as canon..</br>  I would be impressed as fuck if they keep them both dead.  <br>but<br> Even the boys are best girls. </br></br>  <br> if you want loli go for Mirror <br><br>Mirror is cute but noone can replace kiriha</br></br></br>   kill main characters off <br> then have a back in time watch what this dead character did arc <br>please no.</br></br>  <br>maybe GoD but they need to revive kuriha cause main weapon and shit.<br>altho is her fucking fault<br> keeps barrier for years <br> knows what is outside <br> still removes the barrier </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kill main characters off <br> then have a back in time to explain reason of why is this happened ark <br> this is the main point of the whole manga to begin with <br>It can't be helped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was going to get rekt if she didnt power up so not only would the main force of mayoiga still be alive but kanaka would get in anyway</br>  <br>She bet on that Kanaka/Azami is still somewhere deep in forest, and couldn't return in time for Kukkuri to beat Mayoiga.<br> get almost rekd by Miurahi <br> remove barrier for a 5-10 minutes to bet him <br> return barrier back </br></br></br></br>  does the protag revive the flute girl by the latest chapter in japan?  <br>Youre dumb and its terminal. Im sorry</br>  <br>Yeah, that manga really took a fucking turn, didn't it? Even if  those two get brought back to life later,  a three-year time skip is going to completely change the series' setting.</br>  Man I hope they don't  stay dead. <br> Seeing Kiriha killed very abruptly kinda ruined my day. I know they're going to meet her in the pillow flashback, but it probably would not have MC and Kiriha interacting. Also, is it ending? I don't want this ride to end. <br><br>Also, more Sunao scenes pls.</br></br></br>  <br>where is this image?</br>  <br>Shit got real during the Kanaka arc.</br>  <br>im actually more surprised no one else died</br>  <br>In the chapter hes working on now</br>  <br>Wait, it died while he was drawing on the stream? Shit, that's dedication.</br>  <br>I came in while he was on break so im not sure if anything happened before but he just came back said the cat was dead and went on drawing. It could have been a friend's cat or something, i dont know</br>  <br>oh thanks</br>  That's it? No drama "Wah my obi is kill and you want me to kill muh mum"? No angsty running off into the mountains breaking branches off trees?  <br>I like it this way.</br>  <br>He knows that'd be a disservice to the two girls that sacrificed themselves to save his hide. His boner-loyalty is strong.</br>  <br><br>I was just surprised. I expected at least half a chapter of self loathing and mustering resolve. Kazuya is a man</br></br>  <br>he has constantly man up during the series, make him goes angsta is a regression many MC fell in and its fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Does he get a new Tsukogami?</br>  <br>no idea, I have kept myself away from the raws</br>  Cont. discussion, and speculation from <br>More scans/info should be out in the next few hours.</br>  Where's his blue and orange shirt?   new Shiki  <br>Fuckable.</br>  <br>Let us take a moment to recognize how fucking hot Shiki is.</br>    <br>Gone forever<br>RIP</br></br>  <br>Who's that girl on the right?</br>  <br>Wow, that Ciel-senpai is actually really cute. And the left one actually has something different from the Takeuchi angle.</br>  <br>Just wait until he goes crazy.</br>  <br>Can't wait to see her in the church clothes with all the crazy tatoos</br>  <br>Looks like Kohaku</br>  <br>Man, do I wanna eat curry with her.</br>  <br>Was he ever not fuckable?</br>  <br>pls no bully Sacchin</br>  Considering how much sex new Shiki is, now much of an upgrade will Nanaya be?  <br>I want to eat her butt.</br>  <br>The last thread concluded that everyone is gay for Shiki.</br>  <br> The last thread <br>We've always been gay for shiki.<br>It's the inescapable Tohno gland</br></br></br>  <br>My body isn't ready.</br>    <br>Oh hey a slightly different facial structure.</br>      <br>Arahiko now looks like he runs a gang.</br>  <br><br> tfw I'm more excited about Shiki's design than Ciel's  <br><br>i-is this the Tohno gland?</br></br></br></br>    <br>I got the feeling that was the intention with his original design, so it works.</br>  <br>I just don't get it.<br>How did Arihiko manage to spend all those years by Shiki's side and not rape him?</br></br>  <br>Oh man these look so much better than blue filtered photos</br>  <br>I just noticed that those photos were probably of random dev houses</br>   new material comes out <br> people care more about Shiki's redesign than currybutt's <br><br>She never wins. <br><br>That said 9/10. Would go gay for.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like you're feeling it. Welcome to the club.</br>    <br>At least she's not Satsuki</br>  <br>Courtyard layout looks terrible, but otherwise good job Takeuchi</br>  SACCHIN ROUTE WHEN, I NEED IT  <br>Probably because his redesign is easily the best one.</br>  <br>She had her time in the spotlight when Act Cadenz a was a thing</br>  <br>Was she ever relevant outside of her teacher gig?</br>  I want Roa to have an afro.  Why is Akiha so perfect?  <br>Largest gap between new and old for Shiki.

It has been 2 years since the PV that showed that already made a good part of the work for god sake.  <br>Anon, I..</br>  <br>Except that we all know that Takeuchi was just practicing for Saber during Turkeyhandle.</br>  <br>Oh god, non glasses shiki really has that alpha MC look</br>    <br>Are you trying to imply Saber existed at that point in time?</br>  <br>Well, that's because those are Shiki's eyes on Nanaya' hairstyle.</br>  <br>Takeuchi's whole life has been one prolonged attempt to create the perfect Saber.</br>  No montage comparison with the original VN ? I'm interested.  <br>Not really. It's Nanaya with new stylish glasses <br><br>Do you Fatefags not play Melty Blood at all?</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou use Shiki glasses <br> Shiki uses Shirou glasses </br></br>  <br> whole life <br>Actually his life went like this.<br> create the perfect Valkyrie <br> create the perfect maid <br> create the perfect woman to admire <br> create the perfect waifu <br>In that order.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's with his fingers only having two articulations ?</br>  <br>Modern Shirou is a rehash of MB Nanaya's hairstyle. I mean, just look at Shirou before MB Nanaya showed up. Looks like a ginger lesbian with a pseudo-crewcut.</br>  <br>Oh look, white haired Shiki.</br>  <br>He also now hates air intakes unlike Koyama who let Aoko keep hers. <br><br>I say be rid of him.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sexy af</br></br>  <br> a ginger lesbian with a pseudo-crewcut. <br>Fuck, why did this make me laugh so hard.</br></br>  Any information about which software they'll use and its resolution ?  <br> he adds an ahoge to Shiki, a MALE character <br>Not really fun at all.</br></br>  <br><br>TAKEUCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIII</wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh my.</br>  <br><br><br>I do not know how to feel.</br></br></br>  <br>IKEMEN AS FUCK</br>  Why do they all have the same face  <br>Looks like a lower quality copy of Gil, except with the generic school uniform.</br>  <br>KiriKiri as always, should be the same resolurion as Mahoyo.</br>  <br>You mean black haired Archer.</br>  <br>Because it's true.</br>  <br>Are you ready for secondaries and underage edgelords circlejerking over Shiki as being "ZOMG MOST ALPHA MC EVARZZ!!!1!1!ONE BC HE FUXS BITCHS LIKE I CANT AND HE COULD SLIT UP HIS PARENTS AND TAKE SHIT FROM NOBODY LIEK I WISH I COULD"? <br>Are you ready to see idiots throwing the word 'alpha' around the way people who've graduate high school would use a comma? Are you ready for 20 fucking simultaneous threads of this because mods stopped believing in quality control?<br><br>Oh the excitement is killing me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  should be the same resolution as Mahoyo. <br><br>Which was ? Only played FSN and HA, did they used Kirikiri as well ?</br></br></br>  <br>Post a picture of it</br>  <br>He's supposed to be sexy ? Looks like #152 MC edgy faggot.</br>  <br>Gilgamesh's hairstyle is almost like a spiky flat top.</br>  <br> implying secondaries read VNs <br>Wait till the anime adaptation is announced in 2020</br></br>  <br>Wait a minute.<br>Ah fuck he did god fuck everything.</br></br>  <br>We're not seeing much of that until the anime. That's when I'll start worrying.</br>  <br>Are you retarded. We're talking about a VN remake, not an anime adaptation, what you're talking about will never happen.<br><br>Until an Ufotable remake that's it.</br></br></br>  <br>Try again.</br>  <br> not liking ahoge on men <br><br>Are you a faggot or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes they did, TM has also used KiriKiri since Tsukihime. Also I think it was 1024×576.</br>  <br>Damn fuck. That's really fucking ugly hair. What was Takeuchi thinking when he drew Fate?</br>  <br> remake <br>What?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127407972 <br>no</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127407972 <br>No.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127407972 <br>General TM thread probably I gues</br>  Is Kiritsugu in this?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127407972 <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Wasn't Tsukihime on Onscripter like all of the 07th expansions VNs ?</br>  <br> Anime adaptation is announced a year or so before the VN releases <br>I don't believe you.</br></br>  <br>Eh ded.</br>  Is this the Len thread?  <br>Sorry I made a mistake, I meant Tsukihime Plus Disc.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br> thinks that tsukihime get a anime adaption  <br>you can wait 3 more years for the remake designs for roa and nero</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Indeed. Tsukihime was Onscripter. After that, they switched to Kirikiri for Kagetsu Tohya and Fate/stay night. After that, I think they made their own program for Fate/hollow ataraxia.</br>  <br><br>Let me dream</br></br>  <br>F/HA was KiriKiri as well, same with Mahoyo.</br>  <br>Good, I like those a lot.</br>  so no release date yet ?  <br><br>I'm pretty sure F/HA is still KiriKiri, unless they modified KiriKiri to add whatever they wanted into the engine.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait. If Shiki is now Nanaya by default, why can we expect for Nanaya?</br></br>  <br>Kagetsu Tohya was Onscripter too, I know because I played it with an Onscripter emulator</br>  <br> Implying that's nanaya <br>He's missing the shit-eating grin he had in melty, and the crazy look in his eyes</br></br>  <br>Same year as Kizumonogatari and Hoshi no Samidare's anime adaptation</br>  <br>So yeah, fate/vampires thread.<br>Is this new seibah clone likeable at least?</br></br>  <br>and girls work</br>  <br>Post more Len.</br>  I'd fuck him  Watch as it takes place in 2015 and shatters any semblance TM has of a timeline  <br>I almost forgot about that. Holy shit</br>    <br>It's better if you did.</br>  Sasuga Takeuchi  <br>Which Len?</br>  <br>Too hype for the new scans and not in the mood for best/worst grill shitposting, so here's your reply.</br>  <br><br> If Shiki is now Nanaya by default <br><br>I'm not sure how you came up with that. <br><br> why can we expect for Nanaya? <br><br>We can't be sure Nanaya will get a sprite or a CG, his only full appearance in Tsukihime is one battle in Kohaku's route. They might give it a cool CG (maybe really hype it up like they did with Sparks Liner High in RN).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sasuga takeuchi</br>      <br>I don't really care. Just let me fuck Sion. Fuck muh lore and muh consistency.</br>  <br><br>Len the Great.</br></br>  <br>All Lens are good.</br>  <br>All and every Len.</br>  <br>Yes, he does look more like Proto-Saber than he does Shirou.</br>  Len for cutest maid.  <br>This all started when Takeuchi copied Nanaya's hair for Shirou, because his original design looked like a ginger bulldyke <br><br>If we just think about it, Shiki never changed. This was his same design back when MB games were still being released.<br><br>It's Fate's fault for having shit early designs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsukihime Remake <br>silly anon you cant make a REMAKE of something that DOES NOT exist<br><br>change the title to "tsukihime is getting an anime adaptation"</br></br></br></br>  <br> ahoge on men </br>  <br>Anon leave this thread</br>  <br>This <br><br><br>But it's not.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Anon please.</br>    It feels like I've been waiting a decade for a Sacchin route.<br><br>Oh wait, I have.</br></br>  Takeuchi wouldn't give Len a miniskirt, right?    <br>Of course not.<br> He wouldn't give arc one either, right? </br></br>    <br>Are you ready to wait for two more?</br>  <br>You and me both anon</br>    <br> Jack Frost's face on the corner boxes <br> Jack in a box <br><br>god dammit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see a reason to give up now if I've held on this long<br><br>FSN remake with Caster and Fuji-nee routes on the other hand, thats just wishful thinking on my part.</br></br></br>  <br>my dick</br>  Wish /a/ played Melty Blood.

Anime fighter fans enjoy slapping the shit out of newbies to make them better and then when they're an actual match, it's even more fun.</br>  <br>Like how Type Moon now is Mooncell? It's only understandable when your flagship franchise is more relevant.</br>  <br>List them.</br>  <br>What an outrageously large complex. I could never get over how we were suppose to buy that.</br>  Non comedy Tsukihime and Fate Crossover when?  <br>This, to an extent. It's one of the greatest feelings when somebody who you've stuck with since they were a scrub can finally hold a match to you. Even a better feeling when they can consistently beat you after some time. It gives me motivation to get better.</br>  <br><br> inb4 Shirou <br> inb4 flamewar </br></br></br>  <br>This looks like a Federal Embassy, not a Western mansion.</br>  <br>Kotomine.<br>Any Rider or Lancer<br>Gilgameshx2<br>Willy Wonka<br>Araya Souren<br>Archer<br>Flat<br>Arthur<br>Jeckyll <br>Andersen<br>Sir Kay<br>Gawain<br>Jets<br>Richard Lionheart</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Top bait.</br>  <br><br>I guess I just need to suck it up and get to grinding. I have a real life friend who's pretty good at Melty and some other anime fighters (unib, GG) so I'll see if he wouldn't mind beating the shit out of me for a while.<br><br> I said what I said about unfun matches out of personal experience. The only game I've ever played to the point of being competitively decent at is Smash, and when I play people significantly worse than me I feel a mixture of boredom and remorse at completely bodying someone who never had a chance. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Find a good friend to play with. That is at least how I managed to improve since it stings less when you lose to a friend instead of a random opponent. And as  put it, it is a great feeling when you start to improve and play even matches.<br><br>But you will eventually have the satisfaction of knowing you've gotten a lot better.<br>I'm not even close to decent now (I think) but it is miles above from when I started.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot Avenger and Fake Assassin, my apologies.</br>   RELEASE DATE WHEN <br> RELEASE DATE WHEN <br> RELEASE DATE WHEN </br></br>  <br>he doesnt even need to list because he is a bland edgy faggot and shikifags proving again how the love to selfinsert into him this thread is proof enough</br>  <br>Ok, not bad. I expected far worse.</br>  <br>How is it bait? The top 20 of best male type moon characters were Fate only in last official poll.

Go waste time on something you like.</br>  <br/>  Is there really going to be a remake? Or is this thread just wishful thinking?  <br>Yes. There will be one, unless type moon decides to cancel it.</br>  <br>remake was already since 2008 announced</br>  <br>Sometime in the next 5 years.</br>  <br>Announced in 2008. <br><br>We'll probably see it in 2019.</br></br></br>  Where are the rest of the scans?  <br>http://z13.invisionfree.com/Mobius_<wbr>Space/index.php?showtopic=248&amp;st=13<wbr>5</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>The old one was plenty fuckable too.

It's never worked for me. Just crashes when I select networking. I've never cared enough to fix it but hearing you guys talk about it kind of makes me want to.  <br>http://www.meltybread.com/forums/me<wbr>lty-blood-auditorium/cccaster-v1-0a<wbr>-netplay-client-for-mbaacc-1-4-0/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>You need to use CCCaster for starters. <br>http://www.meltybread.com/forums/me<wbr>lty-blood-auditorium/cccaster-v1-0a<wbr>-netplay-client-for-mbaacc-1-4-0/<br>Make sure melty is updated to 1.40. Also there are no matchmaking servers so maybe thats why you were crashing</br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  Okay, so I finished KnK and the F/SN VN, although I didn't really like it other than Heaven's Feel. Is the UBW anime or movie any better than the VN version? Also, I got locked into Ciel's route and finished that, I think I'm getting locked into Akiha's route now. It's early in the story and I've been picking every Akiha choice, is there a flowchart or a way to tell which route I'm going into?  <br>There is, check the install folder for Tsukihime. You got locked into Ciel's route because you chose to meet up with her early on in the game, it happens.</br>  <br><br>Thanks</br></br>  <br>Ah, I think I found it, Thank you.</br>  <br> Ciel-senpai <br>But anon, her ribbon is the first-years' color.</br></br>  <br>You can go arc route after meeting ciel. <br><br>You just need to answer some different things. <br><br>I chose to meet her at the beginning and then made Arc route anyways, got true ending and good ending</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does he look so much like Potter Kun?</br>  <br>He doesn't, are you fucking retarded?</br>  <br>He really doesn't to be honest</br>  <br>They probably changed the colors.</br>  <br>Recommended route order is Arcueid&gt;Ciel&gt;Akiha&gt;Hisui&gt;Kohaku</br>  <br>He's not more hot than Shirou. Real hot characters are Archer, Gilgamesh, the Lancers, all the pretty boys from Prototype.<br><br>He's just cute, nothing too impressive. If he were to look like Diarmuid or Rameses, you'll have a point.</br></br></br>  So, wanna play Melty Blood while we wait?  <br> only two maids clean all that </br>  <br>He's better looking than Shirou if the reactions of the females I know are anything to go by.</br>  <br>butthurt selfinsert shikifag detected</br>  <br>2019, if we're lucky</br>  <br>Poor Kohasui</br>  <br>If wouldn't impossible, just tiring.</br>  <br>Not him but I don't know how this correlates. Don't you think if your average anon would want to self-insert he'd want Shiki to be average looking?</br>  Ahoge looks good on everyone regardless of gender  <br>That makes no sense. Why would I want Shiki to be hot if my intention was to self insert?</br>  <br>Well most of the mansion doesn't get used. There's only four people living there including them. All they really have to do in 95% of the place is dust from time to time most likely.</br>  <br>Clearly you have no idea how selfinsertion works.</br>  <br>I just hope new Shiki isn't the inconsiderate fuck he was in the old Tsukihime.</br>  <br>No but I'd let Shiki self-insert himself into me</br>  <br>I'm down for some games anon, can you host?</br>  <br>I'm the worst person at fighting games since all I do is button mash. I barely got past story mode on easy.</br>  <br>To be fair, not really self-insert. But Shiki seems fun to be hanging out with.</br>  I am excited to see the new shota Shiki  The cutest.  <br>Disgusting cat monster.</br>    <br> dat huge scar </br>  <br>so basically delinquent version shinji?</br>  Are the issues of TYPE-MOON Ace worth it? Considering buying it for myself, but I was wondering if it would be better to just wait for scans.  <br>If you can read moon, yeah, but if you can't, it's better just to wait for the scans.</br>  Fuck, marry, kill.  <br>Are you stupid?</br>  <br>I pick actual best looking MC<br><br>Comes in two flavors</br></br></br>  <br>Dudes can't marry dudes.</br>  <br>Fuck and marry Shiki, befriend what's his face and ignore Shirou.</br>  <br>Mai nigga.</br>  <br>Marry Shirou<br>Fuck Soujuurou<br>Rape Shiki</br></br></br>  <br>This is the only correct answer.</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Fuck Nanaya.<br>Marry Shiki.<br>Put Shirou out of his misery.<br>Befriend Soujuurou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck Shiki<br>Marry Soujuurou<br>Kill Shirou</br></br></br>  <br>He's the only TM protag that was raped so far, so his odds aren't too bad.</br>  <br> shiki <br> raped <br>uwotm8</br></br></br>  <br>Now they can in 'merica.</br>  <br>Try to remember all the sex scenes in the game, you should come to at least three where he gets violated the first time around, almost all of them are by Kohaku, and a few of them are the Len dream where he dreams of being dominated.<br><br>Even if you forget about the dream ones, you should eventually come to the one I'm talking about once you give it some thought.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean just Hisui. Kohaku does some sweeping and that's it.</br>  <br>Nope, still forbidden love in the parts of the world that count.</br>  <br>The one where he got drugged?</br>  <br> Kohaku does some sweeping and that's it. <br><br>Confirmed for not reading enough.<br><br>Kohaku does all of the outsides regularly, does the cooking and gardening as well.<br><br>Hisui does all of the insides basically, and all of the detail work.<br><br>Kohaku used to do the insides, but she always got too overexcited while sweeping up and tried imitating karate moves with a broom, which ended up with things being broken. Akiha wonders if its her subconsciously taking a certain something out on her. Because she was too disastrous, Akiha left Kohaku to deal with the outsides more where she couldn't break anything. Kohaku also maintains all of Akiha's work and that old shack where Shiki used to live.<br><br>I think Hisui does some other things as well.<br><br>They used to have some other maids and helpers, but Akiha fired them all before Shiki arrived for certain reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it might have been the one where he was unable to get out of bed and Kohaku ended up blowing him by force, or the first half of his love making with Kohaku where she took the lead big time.<br><br>Guy also dreams about being violated by Kohaku as Akiha watches a few feet away at one point that was pretty femdom.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, fuck.<br><br> No wonder I was able to get off to Tsukihime's scenes, but not Fate's. </br></br></br>   2nd Len H-scene   So basically it's 2000 something all over again where you have a couple dozen threads about this until Nasu goes lol jk right  <br>Was it the footjob?</br>  <br>Looks like Archer with Shirou's color palette.</br>  <br> "ZOMG MOST ALPHA MC EVARZZ!!!1!1!ONE BC HE FUXS BITCHS LIKE I CANT AND HE COULD SLIT UP HIS PARENTS AND TAKE SHIT FROM NOBODY LIEK I WISH I COULD"? <br>That's literally all the Shiki fans thus far. They are cancerous as fuck.</br></br>  Fate/Alternative<br/>  <br>Daily reminder the Mahoyo dude was stronger than both Shiki and Shirou combined before coming down the mountain.</br>  More like SHITki, amrite?    <br>Is it time?</br>  <br>Sakura did the same thing in her H scenes as Kohaku did in the beginning of her big one.<br><br>She took the lead big time, and rode Emiya around the room as he could barely keep up. Thus foreshadowing the fact that she was Rider from the future, if the purple hair wasn't a big enough give away.<br><br>It was only be the third of fourth sex scene that Shirou started trying to take the lead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SO COOOOL, I want to be him omg.</br>  <br>No.</br>    <br><br> tohYES </br></br>  <br><br>To complete the trio.</br></br>        There are technically others  <br>Shouldn't his eyes be green?</br>    <br>Now make his skin dak and get hipster Avenger.</br>  <br> Every Shiki fan <br>10/10</br></br>      <br>Fuck, they ruined Sacchin's hair.</br>  <br>So she's the heroine who'll  be brutally murdered by Nrvnqsr or SHIKI in order to drive home the danger and gore? </br>  What if they give Shiki a badass theme like they've got for Shirou? Will we get a Nanaya equivalent of EMIYA? NANAYA ost when?  <br>But Shiki and Nanaya both have themes already, pretty good ones I might add. One is Sex music and the other is Megaman music.</br>  <br>This is as much of an opportunity as any to get back into shape with PS.</br>  <br>Has the extra bonus chapter for the Tsukihime manga ever been translated? If not, does anyone still even care?</br>  <br><br> Megaman music <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PAe<wbr>IMQierX4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>now give him tits</br>      <br>Urobuchi doesn't really strike me as an Akihafag. He seems more like a Cielfag.</br>    <br>What does cooking have to do with cleaning the house? Hisui is masterrace maid. Kohaku is just cooking an occasional meal and growing her poisons.</br>      <br> Has the extra bonus chapter for the Tsukihime manga ever been translated? <br>No. Someone promised to translate it years ago.</br></br>      <br>Kohaku isn't just cooking, I even explained what she does around the house and we see enough examples of her doing other stuff in the game. Shiki even helps her in the gardens and sweeping the outsides at one point as she has a lot of ground to cover.<br><br>She cleans the outside areas, she's just not allowed to clean in the inside anymore since she might break something. Hisui does all the insides and anything detail oriented, Kohaku keeps the outside of the house clean, keeps that shack running(not a high maintenance job), does the gardens, and does the cooking.<br><br>You say "just", but Kohaku does a lot more than Hisui at that rate.</br></br></br></br></br>              <br>It's just the actual epilogue from the game.</br>              Shiki's harem management skills are truly top class. I can't think of anyone else who could do as good a job as he does managing so many extremely dangerous women that would still want to kill each other even if they weren't competing against one another.    <br>No anon, there's original content. It's mostly all the Tsukihime cast talking about the Tsukihime manga though.</br>    Who Miyako's route here?    <br> Some people actually saved it <br>O-oh...<br><br><br>A "Teach me" corner with some commentary from Sasaki about the progression of producing the manga?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At least use contraception <br> except for me <br>Truly the greatest imouto of all time.</br></br></br>      <br> At least use contraception <br> Except for me <br>As expected of best Imouto.</br></br></br>        <br>Hakuno<br><br>He/She has an EX rank ability to pick up only dangerous or insane girls.<br><br>Pic related is only about half the total harem, and they're all a bit wild and only able to work together if it means stiffing someone else who's getting ahead.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> O-oh... <br>Don't tell me, you..</br></br>  <br>Even Gilgamesh has to comment that Hakuno seems to have a very high talent for picking up only dangerous girls without trying.<br><br>At that level its more of a curse.<br><br>Was going to find that image of Haku and Diarmund, but this is close enough.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Too bad he won't be doing any fucking in this new version.</br>  How do I get into Melty Blood? Where do I start?  <br>I'm  fucking trash, I know. Also thought UBW S2 was boring and legitimately wondered if I was done with TM, but no, the newer remake scans scans alone have me hyping like a highschool girl all over again.<br><br>J-just l-let me find more motivation and will...</br></br> </br>  <br>MB Re-ACT for the story and Arcade mode, Act Cadenza for the extended Arcade mode and MBAACC for everything else.</br>  <br> CS2 <br>M-moe</br></br>  <br>There're also fun tag-team matches in AC.</br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/UT6mWZqh<br>http://wiki.mizuumi.net/w/Melty_Blo<wbr>od</wbr></br></br>  <br>Hakuno's harem is immense. She technically has universal/galaxy-level love interests far above Arc.</br>  <br>I share that same feeling. I also thought I was done with Type-Moon.<br><br>Lazyness is pretty common, it's the reason I don't scanlate some easy stuff and why I'm behind two chapters of Hana no Miyako.<br><br> Do you need help with something?  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok</br>  <br> almost half the harem is worms <br>No thank you.</br></br>  <br>Yes. He's fucking looks just like male Saber. He's not like me at all.</br>  <br> At least use contraception <br> except for me </br></br>  <br> Hana no Miyako <br>I thought that Straywolf's doing it. Unless he's you and I'm just being stupid.</br></br>  <br>None of them are worms<br><br>That's like saying "What's the fat glutton piece of shit Arthur doing being the main servant in Extra, except she's wearing Red now. Go back to Camelot you shit".<br><br>I mean you may throw out pointless insults, but the fact that Nero isn't Arthur in the first place is kind of lost on you. Just like the fact that an ancient computer program possibly older than the Earth which keeps the Mooncell running isn't Sakura, might be lost on you.<br><br>If this is your first experience with TM's policy of reusing character designs and you're still confused by this, you're in for a bit of a bumpy ride.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Straywolf <br>He's dead, mate. I miss those times when we posted in /fate/ though. A shame he never restored the Grail with all that music.</br></br>        <br>/fate/ was shit though</br>    <br> "What's the fat glutton piece of shit Arthur doing being the main servant in Extra, except she's wearing Red now. Go back to Camelot you shit". <br>Not gonna lie but that was my reaction to Red Saber's reveal when we were first getting news for Extra.</br></br>  <br>This was oddly satisfying to masturbate too</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that I saw him recently around here. So where you're posting these new HnM chapters then?</br>  Are there really still no scans? Where are my Sacchin, Ciel, and Sensei?  <br><br>What in the fuck is going on here.</br></br>  Wait, this is real? Its really happening? This is not some thread for delusional autists wanking over the idea of a remake and how it would be done?<br><br>Who is doing this and when is it coming out?</br></br>  <br>Shirou gotta fuck the chibi things, and has a round fetish.</br>  <br>Where have you been the past 3 years?</br>  <br> Who is doing this and when is it coming out? <br><br>Are you stupid? Of course its the same guy that made the original Tsukihime.<br><br> Wait, this is real? Its really happening? <br><br>This was always happening, it's been happening for the last six years almost, but now its time for results.<br><br>We've known about the remake for ages. Enough bullshit, only the whiners were like "Nasu has forgotten us, the true fans". Everyone else was just biding their time until this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> One or two techniques to pleasure gentlemen <br><br>The whole page made me lose my shit, but then<br><br><br><br>made me remember that Kohaku was pretty much a fuck toy for a good deal of her childhood.<br><br>Feels bad man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alive but lost my external HDD with all the TM music and recently my HDD with all my TM stuff, with my current job and almost no time the final thing I lost was my motivation to try and restore everything again, it really hurts to lose all your stuff, and it specially hurts to lose this vector I was working off and I was about to finish, I fucking hate Samsung HDDs.</br>   by ufotable <br><br>Nice. <br><br>btw what does ufotable mean</br></br></br></br>  <br>UFO TABLE<br><br>Learn to spell it out.</br></br></br>  <br>sometimes I wonder that too, but then I remember it meas UFOtable</br>  <br>H-hush, it  got the Ever After epilogue  gets the job done well enough!!<br><br><br>An honest relief to hear this is more common than I would've expected, h-haha. Still feels bad, even if I'm also a huge procrastinator IRL.<br><br>Memo to self to check out Hana no Miyako, too. Thanks for having worked on it in the meanwhile, anon, for we all know too well how much TM shit there is out there, and how woefully little of that is actually translated.<br><br> I deeply appreciate the offer, but I should be fine on my own. Still got the French volume and I know my way around PS well enough. Translating FR&gt;ENG, cleaning, and typesetting are easy. The hard part is getting focused and actually doing the work... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> unidentifiable flying object table <br><br>No</br></br></br>  What route are they going? I know they stick to the main route but still  <br>Oh well, good luck in restoring your stuff.</br>  <br>I feel the same way with Under Night in Birth. I suck at fightans, so I went online once, got my shit wrecked, and haven't touched it since February.</br>  I looked this up and only found article. Some faggots blog who admitted to lying, from 2 months ago.<br><br>Where is the confirmed source for an anime by Ufotable of all people</br></br>  <br>Check BL or /fate/<br><br><br>You're making me paranoid now. I probably have some of the old stuff you lost stored somewhere. I still remember I wanted to request a vector from you a couple of years ago.<br><br><br>I will believe in you. I want to see that get done for once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  will it be all ages?  <br>Well for now I gonna try an restore that vector, took me a week (with long breaks) to do that. I could have and should have finished in 2 weeks but life got in the way now I regret not uploading my vector files somewhere else, anyway the TM music I can recover it since I got most of the stuff burned in dvds but the more obscure stuff cd dramas and special cds all is lost, I could dig the whole internet again and find it but I lack the motivation right now, much like my new drive, I feel empty.</br>  <br><br>Of course.</br></br>  <br>You may try this site. That's not much but links were good the last time I checked.<br>http://fate-stay-night.my1.ru/load/<wbr>sound_drama/11</wbr></br></br>  <br>Keep trying, StrayWolf! Don't become demotivated! I'm rooting you on!</br>  <br>Naturally, Akiha banished Kouma to the mountains when she recalled Shiki so when he was up there he trained Soujuurou.</br>  <br>Nah Soujuurou is obviously from the same organization as Kuzuki.</br>  I don't mean to be rude but do people actually like new Shiki design? He just looks even more like Harry Potter.  Hisui&gt;Ciel&gt;Akiha&gt;Arcueid&gt;Kohaku  <br>I wish they kept the old knife and glasses, just like I wish they kept Arcs vents and skirt and Senpai's glasses. Overall I like it, but it's still a slight disappointment. Guess I need to manage my expectations better.</br>  <br>Not possible. Mahoyo takes place at least 10 years before Tsukihime.</br>  <br> Anon, that was meant to be a joke. </br>  <br>Reminder that Mahoyo takes place in 1986, which would make Tsukihime take place in 2006 at the earliest.</br>  I'm really worried about it being all ages. I mean taking out Shiki's sex dream in Near Side is one thing, but if they take out the rape from Kohaku's backstory the maid routes aren't going to make any fucking sense.  <br><br>Kohaku will be a Vampire, just like RN Sakura.</br></br>  Who /meltyblood/ here?<br> http://steamcommunity.com/id/2spook<wbr>y4boogie</wbr> </br>  <br>That's because you're assuming that the remake will just be "Tsukihime: Extended Edition".<br><br>It's a REMAKE. It's not gonna just be Tsukihime with a few extra parts. He's rewriting it from the ground up.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is the biggest jobber in fs/n between saber and berserker?</br>  <br>I'm not yet. I have played MBAA (Fuck G-Akiha that was annoying) but I lost it, I'll probably be re-downloading tomorrow night. Is there an IRC or something for matchmaking/chatting/help?</br>  <br>Gilgamesh</br>  <br>looks like Shitrou with glasses</br>  <br>Actually, he looks like Nanaya with an ahoge and glasses </br>    <br>stop this meme</br>  <br>Oh please tell that there's no ahoge on Shiki or Nanaya.</br>  <br>That's basically the same hair as OP, but the ahoge is not as pronounced as it is in the OP.</br>  <br>http://widget01.mibbit.com/?setting<wbr>s=b0c80f1a2b7c9987a0cb0742240f9110&amp;<wbr>server=irc.mizuumi.net&amp;channel=%23m<wbr>baa<br><br>http://seemeinmelty.meteor.com/</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Oh well. I'm bad, didn't practice for a while and if I join you guys, ping would be terrible, since I'm not from 'Murica.</br>  How did they go from the excellent first season to the garbage that is season 2? Turned into a total generic slice of life anime for some reason.  <br> Turned into a total generic slice of life anime for some reason. <br>I disagree.<br><br>But maybe the novelty wore off for you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Season 2 was alright, I enjoyed it at least.<br><br>I just wish for a new one, it was comfy.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mu_<wbr>u-42caEI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hardly if they brought in awful running gags and some shitty mascot character with the dog. They also made the breasts of the girls bigger and sexualized them a little bit. The scenes are made more classically like in traditional slice of life anime and lack the flow of the first season. Also every character was cut down a notch in depth and is overreacting every second now. The main character is forcefully stuck in a shitty role and lacks the charm of S1. The established character quirks are getting abused all the time now too. <br><br>I only finished S1 today and started with S2 right after that. I watched now three episodes and I can't contain my disappointment. In S1 almost every episode was great and brought something varied and unique to the table.</br></br></br>  <br>It was the same. Except 2nd season was more depressing.</br>  <br>This. I enjoyed both seasons equally, but when Hachiken misses the festival thing due to being hospitalized, comes back and sees that one note in the guestbook and starts crying really got to me.</br>  Second season was better though.<br><br>The manga sure went to shit though.</br></br>  <br>what happened ?, last time saw, he was trying to set up a company</br>  If you wanted consistency, you may as well have read the manga. It's supposedly about to end according to Arakawa.  <br>It's more about what didn't happen, feels like the mangaka got desperate to wrap it up as soon as possible, there was a sudden timeskip and everything is kind of half-assed now. Not to mention all the missed chapters. The manga took great care to develop the characters and now it just feels like it wants to get the plot to its conclusion instead.</br>  <br>Bloody hell, what a damn shame, why would someone ruin their work like that.</br>  <br>Maybe she got bored with it and want to get on something new.</br>  <br>What else is there to do? Aren't you just pissed it's ending?</br>  <br>Not like that. Suddenly completely changing the pacing isn't a good way to go about it. <br><br>I guess I should be used to mangaka never having a plan for their series and winging it as they go along, but still.</br></br></br>  People actually watched this?  So I wasn't the only one who loved Ryoko in the 90s, right?  <br>Are you implying he doesn't?</br>  <br>I believe he usually takes them one at a time, as evidenced here.<br>Though Noike and Mihoshi's daughters were born on the same day, so it stands to reason they were conceived close to each other.</br></br>  <br> one eye on the dick <br> one eye on the cunt(Ayeka) </br></br>    <br>What the fuck is this supposed to be?</br>  Be honest /a/, who is the ONE DxD that is universally liked?<br><br>We know Rias, Akeno, Asia and Koneko all have their fair share of haters so they're ruled out, but what about the rest?<br><br>No one hates Xenovia or Serafall, right?</br></br></br></br>  Who in their right mind could hate Rias?  <br>Akenobros and Riasfriends are kind of like a "one or the other" group</br>  <br>way to start a dxd thread with another image of akeno so shocking<br>better call up her baby daddies they waitin for her in prison</br></br>  <br>Settle down it was the first image in my DxD folder</br>  <br> universally liked? <br>No such thing. Everyone has their own preferences. A lot of people don't voice their dislike of certain preferences. For me, I like a handful of DxD girls. There are many I don't like, but I'm not one who would be vocal about not liking them.</br></br>  Kuroka. She is the best.  <br> Harley Kuroka </br>  <br/>  <br>Ddraig</br>  <br> Anon you have to impregnate me right now or Loki will win! <br> There's no time hurry up and fuck me! </br></br>  <br>No one hates Bennia...right?</br>  <br>No one can hate this best girl combo.</br>  <br>most people don't even know who that is because DxD is primarily anime only posters  and there's nothing wrong with that </br>  <br>Yes there is.</br>  <br>There definitely is.</br>  <br>the only thing wrong with these threads is that mexican isseifag who needs to go choke on one of his red dildos</br>  <br>I don't think so at all. They're best bros, and so are the fans. There's just a lot of trolls trying to stir shit up.</br>   Koneko sitting on Issei's lap in color   <br><br><br>Nah, I keep up with the LN and the anime. Some people prefer different methods of DxD and that's okay.<br><br>Elitist LN fags ruin these threads. It's better to educate the anime only fags rather than be a fucking prick to them.<br><br>Akenofag shit posting doesn't ruin threads. All shit posting ruins threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Not sure enough folks know quite what to make of Mil tan to hate...shim?  <br>The idiots that reply to the shitposting help ruin threads.</br>  <br>People hate Rias, Akeno, and and Koneko? I'm pretty sure the only people who do are shitposters.</br>  <br>I'd eat out Xenovia's ass clean.</br>  Universally liked? Well I have never seen anyone post a bad word about Kiryu.<br><br>Side question: Her 1st name is Aika but Issei doesn't call her that. Is that normal? (To be fair she still calls Issei as "Hyoudo".</br></br>  <br><br>Sera is best Satan</br></br>  <br>First name is used if you are good friends usually. They are acquaintances.</br>  <br>Thank you kind anon.</br>  <br>You wouldn't rape a Serafall, would you?</br>  <br>Serafall raped you if you impregnated Sona.</br>  <br>She can shiver my timbers whenever she wants.</br>  <br>That's Ophis, right?</br>  <br>Sorry no anon. Bennia is another character from the later LNs.</br>      <br> Rias <br> fair share of haters <br><br>I stopped hanging out in DxD threads after season 1, has it become this bad? I remember everyone went in for Rias.</br></br></br></br>  <br>While that is true, sometimes people call people of the opposite sex with their family names even if they're good friends out of attraction.</br>  <br>I like the one who is not a slut.</br>  <br>Rias really isn't hated that I've seen. Most of the hate I've seen is directed at either Akeno or Asia.</br>      Who 100 yen here?  Posting Best Doujin  Not enough Shirone.  <br>Will she accept if I cum in her for 100 yen?</br>  <br>Only if she's drunk.</br>  <br>I'm talking about Rose not this drunkard. We don't know if Rose will approve of drunken frolicking.</br>  <br>I don't think Rose is capable of coming to a logical decision about that when she's drunk.</br>  <br>Vol 9 anon.</br>     daily reminder Issei didn't dress break nor booblingual Rias in last ep   <br>Vol 9 didn't have someone cumming in her which I was asking about, even if she was drunk.</br>  <br>Pretty sure Issei loves big ones though. Or at the very least lusts after them more.</br>  <br>why does that nigga look like kyon</br>  <br>He likes them the best. It says so in his theme song.</br>  <br>Fuck! You're right! God damn it!</br>  <br>There's a troll or two. Just like there's one dipshit that constantly shitposts about akeno. Nobody actually hates either of them.  Actual hate is reserved for Asia, in her role as cockblocking editor </br>   hating Akeno <br><br>Fucking faggots. Kill yourselves.</br></br>  <br>Point of order. Asia herself was cockblocked this season</br>      <br> stopped hanging out in DxD threads <br> since season 1 <br><br>and here you are</br></br></br></br>    <br>I am a Akenofag and think Rias is a little shit.</br>    <br>If it has two or more dicks on the same page its gay</br>  <br> that ass </br>  <br>It is Kyon, the hand and hair is Photoshopped, but the text is real.</br>  I hate Rias purely because of her seiyuu.<br><br>All Yoko Hisaka does is voice B-grade ero anime sluts</br></br>  nobody hates elsha              <br>That's not how fabric works.</br>  <br>I could have sworn she was flat.</br>  she's black  <br>She was never flat. Her size is between Asia and Xenovia.<br><br>Miyama-Zero made a mistake on drawing her in the first illustrations that she had which was on the short story "Unresurrected Phoenix". She drew her flat-chested.<br><br>His mistake was carried over by the anime team in Season 1.<br><br>Miyama-Zero apologized for that mistake. The anime team also corrected Ravel's size in Season 3.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Koneko has to compete against that.

Then when magical kaiju invaded hell and demonic magic didn't work they gave him a few days to work and later the devils shit on kaiju.<br>Not to mention they nuked him when he sat on his chair but he nuked them back like nothing.</br></br></br>  <br> this fucking guy </br>  <br>he just seems less retrained than Sirzechs who just seems like an overall nice guy.<br><br>that said the brief look at Sirzechs being pissed at hades and making the whole damn underworld shake by just powering up for a second really makes you see that he could be a really scary mother fucker if he wanted to.</br></br></br>  <br>The fact that you needed to respond only to that part makes you one.

Plus they somehow managed to make her even more useless than she was in Volume 7, which pisses me off because she's my favorite girl.</br>      <br><br>Kiryuu is actually  the female version of Issei. She is the literal reflection of how annoying his pervertedness appears to the opposite sex.

But I won't let them stop zx from translating. </br>  <br>I don't care about Serafall, and I find Xenovia thoroughly uninteresting. So I'm sure there are people who hate them.</br>  <br>Yen Press coming with more announcements this friday?<br><br>If they license anything its probally going to be Yahari seeing as that is super popular right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone has to tell YP the rest of the world ain't one country and that churning out books faster will help you sell.</br>  <br>I don't think anyone can hate any dxd aside asia. And the only reason to even hate asia is due to cockblocking, which more editor-kun's fault, than her character's, to be honest. But dxds are all good girls. There is no despicable among them, not liking or being indifferent to sum makes sense, or even frustration when the ones you prefer don't get screen time, but hating a dxd? They're all good girls, it makes no sense to do that.<br>Excapt ashes-chan, she's a cunt.</br></br>  <br>I hope they license that and not include DxD in any of their plans.</br>  <br>Sunday's their panel at Anime Expo iirc, and I have a feeling DxD's gonna be one of their announcements. I'll be checking Twitter for info from event-goers so if they do announce it I'll post it here asap.<br><br><br>A faster release schedule (say, a book per 2 months) would be amazing. I got annoyed with them taking down entire translations and leaving fans hanging on new volumes so I decided to build a site to host those translations and handle the legal shit myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone tell them DxD won't sell because the soccer moms won't allow it.<br><br>Is this site of yours already up? Or have I mentioned it already?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  Akeno is the hottest out of the DxDs.  <br>Pfft, I honestly wouldn't mind DxD getting licensed as long as the fan translations continue. It'd be cool to read an official translation (and the only thing they could screw up is mythological terms).<br><br>It's technically already up, but I only created it a couple hours ago, so I'm in the middle of setting everything up. Should be fully functional by the end of the day.  https://lnresource.wordpress.com/ </br></br></br>  <br> no honorifics <br> having to read Issei calling Rias "President" for 10 fucking volumes <br>The only other way they can screw it up is with Funi's scripts.</br></br></br>  <br>Bookmarked and saved. You're the best.</br>  <br>They could always translate it to Prez.</br>  <br> Boobs instead of Oppai </br>  <br>They could at least say tits.</br>  <br><br>That's just as annoying.</br></br>  <br>Unless there's some way for you to make Ise not address Rias by her given name then that's all you got. Prez is an acceptable colloquial term.</br>  <br> they won't shorten his name to Ise in the localization <br>I'm liking this idea less and less by the minute.</br></br>  What would happen if Penetrate met Deflect/Reflect?  <br>I just tired of typing Issei chill</br>  <br><br>Or they could just leave it as fucking Buchou which due to it being a foreign word it is less annoying to read than "prez".</br></br>  <br> Hyoudou Issei — that is my name. My parents and guys at school call me “Ise”. <br><br>They pretty much have to.  Inb4 Isse-kun <br><br>Most likely they won't stick with Buchou, but I have hopes considering they're sort of forced to use honorifics for the sake of the plot.<br><br><br>Why do you think the Heavenly Dragon's fight went on without a victor? It's the ultimate shield vs the ultimate spear kind of thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing anon, penetrate breaks all defenses.</br>  <br>They fucking removed Onii-sama from Mahouka. There won't be a single damn one in DxD.</br>  <br>If that happens then they must leave all the suffixes as well and must sacrifice liberty of translation for accuracy.<br><br>The reason why the dub is as good as it is is because they did some liberties on it. Yes they could have done a better job on the Rias-buchou dynamic but other than that it's awesome.<br><br>Besides it would be annoying to read an official translation of DxD like I'm reading fan fiction.<br><br> Asia, here are your manjuu. Ouch! <br> Thanks Issei-san. Oh, what's the matter? <br> My sekiryuutei hand is threatening to reveal itself again. <br> Don't worry. I'll contact Akeno-fukubuchou for you. Go down to the Occult Kenkyubu for now. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dub <br> Good <br>Ok, you alongside the Akenofags can officially go fuck yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> could have done a better job on the Rias-buchou dynamic <br>Dude, how can they even dub next season? They fucked it up so bad that it's beyond saving.</br></br>  <br>No you go fuck yourself. Their one-liners are amazing. Of course they dropped the ball at S3 but who didn't?<br><br><br>I don't know what you're talking about but TNK has discussed the possibility of a new season and they will. It's their only money maker at this point.</br></br></br></br>  This is a new low for DxD threads, not only are Akenofags rampant but dub fags are talking openly about the horrid dub being "good" and not getting run out of the thread.  <br>Or maybe it's only you that's shitting the thread and they're doing a good job not responding to you.<br><br>Thank you for the activity though.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't know what you're talking about but TNK has discussed the possibility of a new season and they will. It's their only money maker at this point. <br><br>Not him but you're missing the point. How will Funi dub the next season with the whole Buchou/Rias thing? How will they even dub the last couple episodes? That "you're too good for my harem" shit they pulled in S2 will get annoying really fast.</br></br></br>  <br> assuming next season covers the Sairaorg match <br> considering they have Sitri game and Kyoto to get through <br>I don't know. I leave it up to the geniuses who script-wrote themselves into a corner.</br></br></br>   New DxD comes out <br> It's an Asia episode </br>  <br>You're really going to be mad about the new spinoff coming out.<br> Issei's kids make an appearance <br> It's an Asia rescue arc </br></br></br>  <br>No, it's not. They only came to warn about what might kill her someday. The reason they're coming back is to avert the war it sounds like.</br>  <br>So it's an Asia pseudo-rescue arc.<br><br>They're rescuing her from an event that hasn't happened yet. Still the same thing to me  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Well no, to me it doesn't sound like Asia's death is related to what they're trying to stop. Rather, it seems like a foreboding of what may happen someday in the future.</br>  <br> Their one-liners are amazing </br>  <br>nah anon they come back to deal with some shit and go<br> Oh by the way, Asia X is how you die so try to avoid it. <br><br>YFW its revealed that  she gets killed while cockblocking, they tell her to stop cockblocking </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't be sarcastic with me. How about watching the goddamn dub? Their lines are much more free flowing and more culturally inclined to the country they're dubbing for.</br>  <br><br> Rias-oneesama, Akeno-oneesama, p-please, calm down... <br> Ise is mine! <br> No, Issei-kun is mine! <br> PoD and Holy Lightning hit Asia who tries to stop them <br><br>I could easily see it. Especially since this is likely taking place after the anime.  Which is coincidentally when Asia stops cockblocking except once and totally has nothing to do with a memory-erased time travel experience that subconsciously made her think cockblocking was bad </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsubaki is a HNNNNNG for me because extremely long hair + ojousama + glasses is right in my strike zone.</br>  I hope the Ruin Princess fucking snaps and ruins Asia for being a cockblock  <br>They all talk like retarded 90's kids, and as a 90's kid I find it horrid.</br>  <br> Don't be sarcastic with me. <br> people dont have different opinions, they are just sarcastic <br>sure thing buddy.<br><br> How about watching the goddamn dub? <br>watched 3 episodes and its shit. <br><br> but you have to watch more! <br>no, no i do not unless it gets an entire new cast and studio behind it.<br><br> Their lines are much more free flowing and more culturally inclined to the country they're dubbing for. <br><br>And i do not give a fuck about the culture the country its being dubbed for, i care about the original content and getting to expirience it as the makers of the anime intented, not how some dumb ass who thinks he is great at writting interprets it, and another dumb ass with no idea at how to direct voice actors thinks that it should sound. <br><br>I watch subs of everything, be it a movie ,tv show, or animations, i rather watch in its original language and subbed than dubbed.<br><br>You can like it all you want, but it is inherently an inferior version of the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh you're that guy. Nvm then, I forget there's people with shit taste like you. Must be nice being an ignorant teenager.</br>  <br>I guarantee you 90s kids did not talk like that. What part of the 90syou from anyway?</br>  <br>90's kids do fucking talk like that. I know because I'm also one. There's a reason everyone considers this to be a "modern" dub due to how they talk.</br>  <br><br>I heard the word radical in one scene, it's a retarded 90's kid dub, the problem is that we aren't in the fucking 90's anymore and now that shit makes you cringe UNLESS you are watching 90s cartoons.</br></br>  <br> dem hips </br>  Now the wait for Rossweisse.  <br>They started to have less prejudice against Issei because Kiba put in a good word for him.<br><br>At least, Issei got that going for him.</br></br></br>  <br> Why is Akeno fucking perfect <br>I'm trying to like her, and with all things combined, she should be perfect, but I can't.</br></br>  <br>Finally.</br>  <br>She's super generic.</br>  <br>like all the girls in DxD, every girl is a straight up archetype</br>  <br><br><br>Bunch a slack jawed faggots in this thread. Akeno will turn you into a god damn sexual tyrannosaur.</br></br></br>  <br> Dub fag <br> Calls others ignorant <br>welp</br></br></br>  <br>cant touch what jameel and tyrone touched already thats some thirsty ass thirds</br>  Animeonlyfag, does Vali get a battle harem later in the novels?  <br>Your sentence structure is fucking terrible.</br>  <br>yes of men of the tightest asses</br>  <br>Harem of men? That sucks. Kuroka left him or something?</br>  <br>Not really , Vali only cares about fighting strong beings  and Issei .<br>Kuroka and Le Fay move into Issei's house, so his team is a sausage fest right now.</br></br>  <br>he's gay he wanted issei's bum that one time</br>  <br>I wish issei would convert his ex that tried to kill him and have gags of her in situations that look like she's about to kill him again</br>  <br> Kuroka <br> part of vali's harem <br> vali having a harem <br><br>animeonly anon please... <br><br>Vali never showed interest in Kuroka in any sexual or romantic way, and hell even Kuroka gave up on catching his eyes because she knew he would never be interested in anything but fighting , and thats where issei and his DxD come in to play.<br><br> its almost confirmed that issei fucks Kuroka and has a kitty dragon with her in the future </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck Akeno's cute mouth like it was a pussy. In a sexual way.</br>  <br>silly anon, you cant convert ashes.</br>  <br>I thought he was going to get a team as big as Issei since the Occult club gets more and more members. But even the girls of his team left him for Issei? That's surprising.</br>  <br>He's not sexually interested in women. Kuroka learned that the hard way.</br>  <br> Vali never showed interest in Kuroka in any sexual or romantic way <br>This is not what I implied.</br></br>  <br>Vali was never about having a team, the "team" he has is more about outcasts hanging around him and helping him get to his objectives , Kuroka helped him with teleporting and shit, arthur also helps with some other shit, etc.</br>  <br>They didn't left him for Issei.<br><br>They are still part of his team; go to where he is if he needs them.<br><br>They just hang out in Issei's house waiting if they can get a hold of that dragon sausage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But even the girls of his team left him for Issei?  <br><br>Nah, they are still apart of Vali's team. They just live in Issei's house since Le Fay is going to enroll in Kuoh Academy soon, while Kuroka can just laze about, be with Koneko, and eat in peace.</br></br></br>  <br>His goal is to become the strongest in the world right? And he's supposed to fight Issei someday so I thought he'd have a strong team with members comparable to Issei's team for this since Issei's harem will obviously help him.</br>  <br>Vali's team is pretty powerful as it is.</br>  <br>Vali's team is smaller but can probably beat Rias' if they try hard enough. Even with Balor taking over Gasper, they can probably win still. It'd be easier to tell if we knew how strong Fenrir is now.</br>  <br>Arthur could single-handedly fuck up most of the ORC, so Vali's team would have a chance at winning. Except that scenario will never happen because Issei and Vali have become more of sparring partners/friends than actual duel-to-the-death rivals.</br>  <br>After Volume 19, it seems to me that Arthur would be the strongest of them, if Vali couldn't enter EJOD in time.</br>  <br> Probably not the best move by issei since kuroka seems like the type to have some fucked up demon stds. I can see the harem all waking up with cat herpes and getting pissed at issei while kuroka's laughing her ass  </br>  <br>Anon you do realize Kuroka only acts like she's experienced right? She's most likely still a virgin.</br>  <br>And even with how powerful Arthur seems to be, he's only equal to a 67-year old Strada.</br>  <br>A 67 year old who cut extinguished star in half with a replica that had 1/10 the original power along with holding Issei down completely with one hand.</br>  <br>No. The one who fought in v19 is an 87-year old.<br><br>When Arthur and Strada had a small skirmish, they stopped and Strada apologized to Arthur.<br>Arthur in return said that if he was 20 years younger, they would have the best fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck. This guy in his prime with the real Durandal would've make Cao Cao his bitch.</br>  <br>Let's just think about power-levels for a second:<br><br>-Xenovia's mastered Ex-Durandal is on-par with Cao Cao's BB<br>-Cao Cao is the candidate for the strongest Longinus user<br>-Strada could probably kick both of their asses in his prime (let's assume 67 since he can fight so well at 87), even with a replica<br><br>And Arthur is comparable to that guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And Arthur is comparable to that guy <br>Saber would be proud.</br></br>  <br>Still though, "keeping yourself clean" is an understated responsibility for an harem protagonist. <br><br>Just one time with a shady looking chick and the entire team's going down with him.<br><br>Hopefully, Issei's rational and not horny enough not to pull any stupid stunts like that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly doubt he'd fuck any girls he doesn't have some sort of a close connection with. It's not like he's under-satisfied or anything.</br>  i will never be hard enough  <br> Hopefully, Issei's rational and not horny enough not to pull any stupid stunts like that <br>By vol 18 he is already smart enough to hold his lust back and not fuck up a nice romantic moment with Rias by going "BOOBIES!!!" like he would at the start of the series. <br><br>So by the time he is actually fucking the girls he will be ok and know not to stick it in nasty places.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly want to see what kind of fallout would happen if Saber shows up in DxD with the original Excalibur</br>  <br>isseis probably gonna go fucking other girls and leave the dxds in the trash</br>  <br>Yeah? Name the exact character archetype Rias is. I'll wait.</br>  <br>I guess that's the consequence of trying fuck a gay/asexual guy for the past half decade.</br>    <br>Caring onesama that everyone relies on but actually likes to relie on the guy she loves.<br><br>Dude i love DxD, but there is nothing really all that original about it, its a collection on archetypes and cliches placed together in a pretty god damn entertaining arrangement , but thats about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon you gotta actually put some effort in your baits.</br>  <br>And that's not a bad thing. The characters have a real personality beyond their archetypes, and the way Ishibumi ties it all together makes it fun as fuck to read. Other series have tried to copy DxD in the hopes of getting that perfect mix again, but failed. Ishibumi took an established formula, tweaked it, and created the amazing story known as DxD.</br>  <br>go back to sucking issei dick mexican</br>  <br> And that's not a bad thing <br>Never said it was a bad thing anon, just said it was silly to blame one girl of being "generic" when they all are in a way.<br><br> and created the amazing story known as DxD. <br>you are going a bit over board with the dick sucking there anon. DxD is entertaining but its not THAT amazing, or unique.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes yes your character and favourite anime are all bettter than DxD this shitty cartoon relies on cliches so much it's painfully generic and the plot might as well not exist because it's all hot blooded shounen trash</br>  <br>Man, you got really upset by him even slightly insinuating that this series isn't that great. Did he hit a nerve? Is Ishibumi paying you or something? Calm down.</br>  <br>It's not hard to imagine some people don't want to see shit being flung at a series they like<br><br>Yeah his taste is better yay he wins something but not at life<br><br>EVERYONE is a generic character one way or another because they're all archetypes no matter how good a story is, i don't understand why he has to single DxD out because of that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe he's just pointing out that there is no perfect series in the first place?<br><br>I fucking love DxD but it has a lot of issues, I won't deny that. Even Ishibumi is pretty modest when it comes to his own series.</br></br></br>  Archetypes when done well, can remind you exactly how they came to BE archetypes.<br><br>My best example of this isn't an anime, but the 1st season of Heroes. Very little in that show was actually original. Instead it was populated by archetypes that were just done RIGHT.<br><br>While DxD might not be quite as good as Heroes, it really isn't bad at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That first fucking season was amazing. They actually built Sylar up really good and the season finale was hella good.</br>  <br>I know DxD ain't perfect man<br><br>The way he worded his shit was what I didn't like<br><br>And I don't know what you're implying with that pic but Bake ain't something perfect as well</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Wait for this thread die then I'll go make UBW Saber&gt;DxD Arthur thread.</br>  <br> The way he worded his shit was what I didn't like <br>What exactly didnt you like? that i called it entertaining as fuck but flawed? <br><br>Or when i straight up agreed with you that being archetypes and generic to a degree was not a bad thing at all ?<br><br>or was it that i didn't agree with your about DxD´s uniqueness ?<br><br> Yes yes your character and favorite anime are all better than DxD <br><br>So DxD is better than DxD , and Ravel is better than all characters including herself, thats nice.<br>You do realize that people can criticize their favorite thing and still enjoy the fuck out it right? <br><br>You went full diodora there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>saber would get rekt by xenovia no contest</br>  <br> Saber <br> Lost again amateur </br></br>  <br>While I have no idea who/what Saber is, I don't see why you would need a DxD general thread to die before making a far more specific crossover thread for that topic. I see no conflict.<br><br>Or put another way I like to keep DxD threads alive but have no desire to intrude on your fun by doing so. So please have a blast with it with my best wishes.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad Akeno is an extremely crappy version of her archetype. <br><br>You sound exceedingly new to anime, and if not anime you sound exceedingly new to /a/.</br></br></br>    <br>...And here we have a classical 4chan archetype in "The Shitposter". "The Shitposter spews negativity at any perceived opportunity. Refusing to make a positive contribution and discouraging others from doing so are his hallmarks. A successful protagonist is one that either ignores the shitposter or learns to do so.</br>  <br>And here we have the classic faggot.</br>  <br> still trying to stir shit left and right <br><br>Its good to see you enjoying summer shitposter.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see what going "lol summer" has to do with any of this, he's here regardless of time of year. Are you a retard cause you are looking like one.</br>  <br>Newfag detected</br>  <br>So full on retard. Good to know that's the kind of people that he's going up against. Whelp, I'm on his side now. Akeno a shit.</br>    <br>i forget that you guys would rather stay inside than go out and do something meaningful with your lives</br>  It was nice knowing you, thread.  <br>Aye.</br>   You will never turn Rossweisse into your Rosswife   What would Issei's reaction be if Raynare's kid also came back from the future?    <br>Ashes cant get pregnant anon.</br>  This place went full reddit. I'll be in the other thread if you want me  <br> 15959▶ <br>  (You) <br> Ashes cant get pregnant anon. <br><br>Anything's possible in DxD</br></br></br></br></br>  The anime needs to have an ass episode<br><br>If you're gonna pull all this retarded OC shit out of your ass then at least have the decency to have an ass episode</br></br>  <br>Perhaps Vali could have a BD extra?</br>  I want to have rough, sweaty sex with Rias.  <br>Perhaps Vali could just be the main character from now on</br>  <br> he wants the boring asexual shonen trope to be the mc <br><br>And this boys and girls is how you can tell animeonlyfaggots apart .</br></br></br>  <br>so we could complain and have more dxd threads</br>  <br>But anon he only likes asses that are attached to strong sexy  men  like  Issei </br>  <br>vali and issei should swap le fay and kuroka for kiba and gaspar<br><br>both sides will be happier<br><br>well, gaspar might have to stop crossdressing at this point though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do know that when we say ashes its just as a joke right? there are not even ashes of her left behind after Rias hits her with destruction magic.<br>the only traces of ashy tits left were memories inside Issei´s dumb brain and even that gets erased after v10.</br></br>  <br>still possible<br><br>her individual atoms that once made up her body could still be pregnant with strong enough magic</br></br></br>   this needs to be possible <br>Issei's journey to being the harem king won't be over until he has one girl at least from each house of the 72 pillars.</br>  <br>Destruction magic erases all traces of what ever is hit with it, there are no atoms that once made her body left .<br>Raynare is the deadest of dead characters in DxD.</br></br>  <br>issei is a little beta faggot though</br>  <br>Say that to the few girls that are confirmed pregnant.</br>  <br>...Most of the 72 pillars are completely wiped though.</br>  <br>Hence the<br> this needs to be possible <br>You can't deny that it would be fucking amazing to see it happen though.</br></br></br>  <br> Issei <br> faggot <br> impregnated his harem </br></br></br>  <br>what is TIME TRAVEL<br><br>he saves the grills from extinction by bringing them with him therefore saving them from the war<br><br>it would make sense the bloodline went extinct..he took them all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think it would lose all specialness after Ravel. Also there would literally be no reason for anyone in his current harem other than Rias and Ravel, and while I am fine with certain members of the current harem being removed it does get rid of great girls like Irina and Rossweisse in favor of unknowns that would receive no character development what so ever just like Xenovia for like 19 volumes.</br></br>  <br> season 3 sells like shit <br> lets impregnate all the girls dat will save my shitty show!! <br>yea ok</br></br></br>  <br>Hasn't even gone on sale.</br>  <br>Yeah. There's actually another LN series that basically has the MC getting a girl from all 72 pillars and it's suffering from lack of character development. <br><br>But just as a goofy spin-off I'd like to see it happen though, nothing too serious. Sorta like that Asia/Koneko manga mini-series.</br></br></br>  <br>The harem doesn't need to be everyone in a relationship. The girls could just like Issei but never penetrate the original 10 or 12.</br>  <br>The Magika one?</br>  <br>Yup. Makes me wonder how long the author plans for that series to go on for.</br>  <br>Doesn't matter, Issei dick his harem is canon now.</br>  <br> Ishibumi has time traveling powers, went to the future to see S3 some how failing in sales even though it was tracking above average , then come back far enough to start writing the side story and plan it as an extra to "save" the anime that didnt need to be saved. <br><br>You are a very special kind of dumb shitposterkun, what would we do with out you around to make us laugh?<br><br> lets also ignore that Ishibumi confirmed Issei getting the girls pregnant years ago </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oi as the "original" shitposterkun I am highly offended that you would refer to that dumbass as such.<br><br>I love this series, I just hate Akeno's fans and then started to hate Akeno herself due to my hatred of her fans. Sidenote, I am trying to not hate Akeno though, hating someone due to there horrid fanbase is the height of faggotry and I should be above such things.</br></br></br>  <br>akeno a shit<br>friendly reminder</br></br>  <br>You're going to be in every<br> every DxD thread <br>for each season at this rate, shitposterkun.</br></br></br>  <br>AkenoFAGS a shit anon.<br>Akeno a generic as all hell but that's not a particularly bad thing.</br></br>  <br> actually proud of being a shitposter <br> shitting threads for everyone because some faggot made him mad who knows when <br> still mad to this day <br><br>You really need to get over you dumb ass autistic "rampage", its getting kinda sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will stop when Akenofags stop being shit anon, you can make the first step on that long difficult path by going to kill yourself.</br>  <br>you really need to go outside more, its getting kinda sad</br>  <br>Seriously man what do you get out of this?</br>  who's sluttier: akeno or kuroka?  <br>I think Kuroka craves sex more overall, but Akeno should be wild in bed with her S&amp;M and shit</br>  <br>akeno is the bigger whore, kuroka wouldn't have fucked both her dad and sorta uncle at the same time for a "joke".</br>  <br>Technically speaking neither, but honestly it's Akeno. <br><br> Kuroka is secretly the christmas cake of the bunch. </br></br></br>  <br> Kuroka <br> christma cake <br>You really should stop using terms you clearly dont know the meaning of...OR should start paying more attention to the series.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Kuroka's barely pushing 20.</br>  <br>Come on shitposterkun, you gotta at least try and use actual things from the series instead of mkaing shit up in your brain and thinking its canon.</br>  <br> not canon <br>ok</br></br>  <br>so this didn't happen? ok then.</br>  <br> whips them once with a magical whip that she is asked to test <br> THEY FUCKED!!!! <br> THEY SERIOUSLY FUCKED ALL NIGHT LONG!!! <br><br>You are as silly as ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akeno's family is just fucked up. She probably just has some major daddy issues.</br>  <br>Please show me the page where she fucks barakiel in that side story, I´ll wait while you come up with some convoluted idea about how the scene meant to be a gag actually implies that they fucked and that azazel also fucked her.</br>  <br> side story made for pure comedy </br>  <br><br>s&amp;m sessions are never non-sexual. they fucked, deal with it.</br></br>  <br>Well as an aside, I would like to congratulate this person for posting a pic. I was wondering if that would ever happen and I am glad that it did.<br><br>I kinda thought that particular scene was dodgy as hell and I prefer to skim that section as I find it uncomfortable. But lest we focus to sharply please remember DxD has a LOT of different fetishes represented.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So I log in here and see this shit being posted.<br>I thought you hated /a/?<br>Why are you here shitposting then?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Show me where they fucked <br> THEY FUCKED! <br> there is no mention of any actual physical contact in the novel <br> Nah nah! they fucked, i say it so its canon <br><br><br>You never stop being funny shitposterkun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, risking the progress being made, but I would like to assure you that S &amp; M sessions can certainly not lead to sex. Are they often sexual? Sure I can grant that. But I have to refute that it's 100% of the time.</br>  <br>http://www.submissiveguide.com/2012<wbr>/11/what-is-non-sexual-play/<br><br>Remember when you said &gt;been there done that about BDSM?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br><br> Shitposter-kun is desperate after Ishibumi confirmed Issei impregnated his harem. </br></br></br>   all these delusional faggots defending the blatant parental incest in this thread <br>look, i'm not against fatherxdaughter but come the fuck on you need to stop deluding yourselves.</br>  <br>akeno is a shit and a dirty slut</br>  <br> s&amp;m sessions are never non-sexual. they fucked, deal with it. <br><br>Except they didn't. And spouting out artificial bullshit facts that you made up is never going to change that.</br></br></br>  <br>Remember that shitposter kun is the biggest tsundere of all shitposters, he hates everyone and refuses to explain why because then people will just call him crazy, but also refuses to stop shitposting and ruining threads because HE HAS to get rid of akenofags even if it means fucking up every DxD thread ever created... also he cant explain why he has to other than "i dont like them" .<br><br>Also he hates Akeno but will only ever post about her and nothing else...but its not like he likes her or anything.</br></br></br>  <br>except they did, and spouting out bullshit artificial facts that you made up is never going to change that.</br>  <br>I haven't even been doing anything these past few posts. Come the fuck on, give me some credit I use proper capitalization.</br>  <br> author had posted on his blog about short story <br>Can you link me that story, anon?</br></br>  <br>AAANNNDD he's back after a momentary relapse. Never mind vol 14. Why let the established facts get in your way now?</br>  <br> http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/ <br>It's moonrune anon, you might find the partial translation on DxD wikia.</br></br>  <br>remember nip find weird shit funny, like little kids sticking their finger up adult´s ass holes.<br><br>so im sure ishibumi just saw this as a funny gag and nothing else and its why he only did it for a side novel, and not for the arc where he actually wanted to show Akeno growing pass some of her emotional issues with her father. <br><br>had that scene been in the middle of vol 7 , then yeah it would have been weird as fuck but as it stands its just a gag.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing about it is, it was played off as a gag. Not meant to be taken serious in anyway, shape, or form. There was no penetration or touching involved except with a whip. Both Barakiel and Azazel were whipped, so it wasn't any form of only them two doing the act. <br><br><br>Holy shit, you really are deluded. Well enjoy that made up idea you have in your head. No way I'm arguing with an autistic brick wall.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Anon is there something repressed deep within you that you have for your father?<br><br>We won't judge or anything if you wanted to fuck him. Taking it out on a fictional character isn't healthy.<br><br>Lying about BDSM isn't healthy too. Go back to school first and make some friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its hard shitposterkun, you laid out a pretty good shitposting plan for copycat shitposters to follow.<br><br>You have pretty much guaranteed that DxD threads will have to deal with your bullshit even when you are not around.</br></br></br>  <br>vol 14?<br><br><br>pretty much this<br><br>i personally find it kinda fucked up, but its pretty clear ishibumi and his editors found it hilarious hence why its a short story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you really so delusional to believe there wouldn't be assholes in these threads even if i never posted?</br>  <br> There was no penetration or touching involved except with a whip. <br><br>also remember that the whole thing was set up as a test for that whip, and the whole side story also shows all the other weird and wacky shit that goes down in their headquarters.</br></br></br>   In my head, I combined Mil-tan’s body and Gyasuke’s head. I can imagine him being a creature from “Fist of the North Star”. <br><br> “Osu! Ise-senpai! I have attained the fist of a vampire! When I mix protein with Ise-senpai’s blood, it becomes good for my muscles! Look at these splendid biceps! Ooooooooosu!!” <br>Make it happen Ishibumi, then he can go ZA WARUDO while pointing his pinkie "You are already dead."</br></br></br>  Why are people so much of a faggot?<br><br>I would a Rias.<br>I would an Akeno.<br>I would a Xenovia.<br>I would an Asia.<br>I would every fucking girl in these series because they are top tier waifu materials.<br><br>There is no perfect waifu in this case, since everyone is perfection.<br><br>Go fuck yourselves, shitposters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> like little kids sticking their finger up adult´s ass holes. <br>You didn't do this when you were kids?<br><br>The gag there is that Japan has a culture of seniority. You cannot at any rate raise your hand or harm your elders. It's the rule. The twist is that Akeno violated this rule but Barakiel and Azazel liked it. Burgers aren't able to find this funny because we don't have that culture in the first place.<br><br>Subverting seniors' dignity is nothing new as a funny point to Asian culture. What made it Japanese was the BDSM part.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Assholes? yeah there will always be assholes shitposting.<br><br>Assholes shitposting following the exact pattern to the point you can predict every post they will make, and pretending to have some unholy hatred for a fucking anime character? <br><br>Those are all your doing, you laid out the plan and they just ran with it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You sound like you are very new to /a/ anon. That's not remotely a new pattern, it's fucking standard.</br>  <br><br><br><br>calm down it's just one guy trolling</br></br></br></br>  Rias tier:<br>Rias<br>ELDER GOD TIER:<br>Every other DxD<br><br><br>There are no bad DxD</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akeno is my waifu and I still agree that I could fuck Rias as well.<br><br>I'm fucking tired of the guys who keep shitposting "which DxD is hated" or "X DxD worst girl".<br><br>Fucking annoying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't mad I was just offering my 2 cents to clear the air.<br><br>Thanks for the heads up though</br></br></br>  <br>All DxDs are best DxDs is the oldest truth about the series anon, do not let a couple shit posters let you think that most people dont agree with you.</br>  <br>That why I ask direct link. Searching on moonlanguage is impossible for me, but I can manage slow translation %%in very low quality%% Btw thanks.</br>  <br><br> Needing a reason to impregnate Xenovia </br></br>  It's gotten quiet again.      <br>dxd needs more milfs</br>  <br>All the DxDs need to be MILFs</br>     sadpanda cards update <br>Get in here DxDbro</br>  <br>Who's the oldest member of the harem? Probably Rose and she's like only 17-18. Not sure sure old Kuroka is though.</br>  <br><br>I have long suggested that DxD, aside from Issei's mom, has no true MILFs. All the women we see look as though they are in their early 20s at the oldest. (This is explained as natural powers of high class devils and implied to their equivalents in the LNs.)<br><br>I am open to being told I am wrong, but ask for an explanation of why if you choose to do so.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just curious as to what a MILF version of Koneko would look like<br>Flat or Fat?</br></br>  <br>That's been answered in the most official way possible anon.</br>  <br>But would it be permanent?<br>Or will her breasts only grow fat with milk when her body senses that her ovum's been fertilized yet again?</br></br>  <br>That is what she will look like when she grows up as a base state.</br>  <br>Devils are naturally vain, so obviously their women don't want to look old. Fallen angels have bodies that were literally designed for sex, so the same principle applies.</br>  <br>Not asia</br>  <br>Muh dick</br>  <br>Actually fallen angels have the bodies of angels. As far as we know the wings going black is the only physical change we've seen.<br><br>Speaking of angels Gabriel is said to have the best tits in heaven, As she's a Seraph that would make her thousands of years old. And Serafall considers her a rival.<br><br>In short angels retain youthful appearance as well.</br></br></br></br></br>    New megami poster  and nyantype  <br>I hate everything</br>  Issei requires some loving. The girls hurry up and dress in skimpy clothing.<br><br>What service are each of the girls best at?<br> inb4 gasper is good at anal </br></br></br>  Again, someone is getting fired for forgetting to colour that pinky-hook-thingamajig.<br><br> Yes, this is water bottle guy. </br></br>  <br> someone is getting fired <br>Nope.<br>Misses like that happen all the time.</br></br></br>      Second year students drama soon. Are you ready for Oboe and Flute drama.  I really like how this one turned out<br><br>so for good old times sake, which section would you join? trombros where we at?</br></br>  <br>Does she really? I'd like novelanon to talk more about her and her circumstances.</br>    <br/>  <br>Oboe/fagott <br>DOUBLE REEDS UNITE</br></br>  <br/>  <br> Hazuki standing between Riko and Gouto <br>Man, what a fucking cunt. No wonder she got dumped by Shuuichi.</br></br>  Bloody hell, Natsuki is so dreamy.  I'm kinda conflicted here. I'm so curious on what's going to happen next to the point I want to look at the spoiler. But will there be second season? I don't want to get spoiled.  <br><br>I can't look at screenshots of these drink cartons without thinking it's cigarettes. I had the same problem with Pleiades.</br></br>  <br>Hazuki is their adopted daughter. It's a nice Tuba family dynamic.</br>  <br>It's her purple bedroom eyes. It's like she's about to suck you dry before you even get to react.</br>  Why was Asuka's UFO silver and not gold?  <br>Read the spoilers.</br>  <br>It's  her Dad's UFO. </br>  <br>reminder that Left Fagott is objectively the best</br>  So what's the point of switching to the blue semen demon in the middle of the performance? It kinda ruined it to be honest.  <br>Why would they adopt someone who doesn't even know how to properly take a bath with her Tubacabra?</br>  <br>I wish we got a scene like that for right fagott too.<br>Hottest chicks in the band.</br></br>  <br>So they can teach her together.</br>  <br>They'll impart that knowledge to her in time just as parents teach their children about the world.</br>  That pout.  Smile status: Saved  <br>But Riko and Gouto would already take up all the space. There is no place for someone as useless as Hazuki.<br>They shouldn't have to teach anything to their kid who would already be born with perfect knowledge and love for Tuba.</br></br>    <br>I see it too. I'd do a Vietnam Taki with that shot if I wasn't so lazy.</br>  <br>Why was Flute-chan sad?</br>  lmao look at these gaylords  The first episode is delayed. There's no god.<br>http://anime.godeater.jp/?category_<wbr>name=news</wbr></br>  <br>maybe god got eaten</br>  How do you even mess up the first episode? Isn't this supposed to be 2-cour?<br><br>Haha this is so fucked</br></br>  B-but budget!  <br>13 episodes only.</br>  <br><br>Wow the actual TV airing is delayed now too. Yeah this project is probably fucked. They're obviously really behind schedule and probably better off postponing it to the next season.<br><br>Seriously though I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often though is probably going to with just how fucked anime studios schedules are becoming with the non-stop grind of 40 new series every season. They could always just A-1 it and forge ahead anyway, but it sounds like they do kind of give a shit so this is probably the better option if the schedule really is that fucked.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>they really can't delay it a season. I mean they could, but Bandai Namco had a specific distribution strategy for this, with the first volume of the BD having game bundle.<br><br>Delaying it would be a nightmare and would cause issues to the Tales anime project as well. And anyone expecting HF should expect to wait for a very long time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did something happen between Putin and Abe recently that warrants the exponential surge of slavs in shows nowadays?</br>  <br><br>Well that's not due out till October so they have plenty of time to get their shit together. Still though damn, I was wondering how ufoTABLE was going to handle suddenly going from one project every few years to like 4 at the same time and the answer is obviously not that well. The way they try to do things they're obviously nowhere near equipped for this and again I think we're going to start seeing this happening more and more with stuff.</br></br>  <br><br>I imagine ufotable/president Kondo wanted their schedule to essentially be, God Eater(summer) Tales(Spring) and then focus fully on HF. It all goes back to UBW's production crumbling during the winter break and bottlenecking on the 15th episode though.</br></br>  Ufotable is shit.<br>Should have hired Madhouse instead.</br>  <br>Ah, I was hoping to see this become a horrible mess. If they delay it enough to get their shit together the whole way it'll be disappointing.</br>  <br>But Madhouse doesn't have Hiaro.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  How hard would they even have to fuck up their scheduling for this to happen?<br><br>I mean, I know Lerche is doing three shows this season.<br>Fuck, SL is doing three shows this season plus another three come Fall. Not even including the other shit they still have in their backburner.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe it wasn't such a great idea to have like 3 hour long episodes in the first season. I still don't know why they felt that was necessary, the 2nd season didn't even have any</br></br>  <br><br>They're going with the company that always did the cutscenes for the game for consistencies sake.</br></br>  <br> 3 hour long episodes <br>Those were great ideas. What wasn't such a great idea was that 2nd season didn't have any. Emiya vs EMIYA would have been better as a 1 x 40min as opposed to 3 x 20min.</br></br>  This shouldn't be adapted at all because God Eater sucks. Just make a Monster Hunter movie and call it a day. We need ufo on Fate anyhow.  <br><br>the last episode being 1 hour was a mid-production decision, wasn't planned at all originally .</br></br>  <br><br>This guy gets it.</br></br>  I wonder how upset Hirao is at Miura for screwing him over  <br>Is this UFO table's Jiggly Jiggly Heaven?</br>  <br>The only director that got Satoshi Kun's seal of approval.</br>  <br><br>gyo</br></br>  <br>Jiggly Jiggly Heaven didn't have the benefit of delays.</br>  Direct Heaven's Feel you faggot! Fuck this shit!  <br><br><br>did it ever occur to people like you that Miura is the only person at ufotable that gives enough of a fuck to do fate shit?</br></br></br>  God Eater maybe not just delayed 1 week, one of TV channel changed the episode 1 air date from July 17 to August 14<br>If it's same for Tokyo MX, early August?<br>http://www.necoweb.com/neco/info/de<wbr>tail.php?id=400</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Sliver Link didn't have any shows during Spring, one of the three shows they're doing this season and next are in collaboration with another studio, and they've actually grown as studio these past few years compared to when they were still considered SHAFT lite.<br>Anyway, that still means QUALITY inbound. I hope you enjoy shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think he's seen the chaos dragon rips. I'm almost positive NNB will have more frames drawn than CD</br></br>  <br>Came to post this.</br>  <br><br>Did it ever occur to you that you're a flaming faggot who should should shut the fuck up?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not one to judge pre-screenings since they usually get improved upon once TV broadcast starts. Regardless, I expected far worse really.</br></br>  <br>It's been eaten</br>  <br>But he's better at directing than anyone in that shithole. I mean compare Paranoia Agent EP1 to anything Ufotable did on TV.</br>  <br><br><br>making a director do something they have no interest in doing is a terrible decision and leads to people like Seiji Kishi and the shit he pumps out on a seasonal basis.</br></br></br>    <br> And anyone expecting HF should expect to wait for a very long time <br>Might as well cancel Girls' Work too since it's obvious we're never gonna get it.</br></br>  <br>Or another example being Mekakucity, a battlefield earth-tier franchise killer even</br>  Damn, I was looking forward to seeing Alisa's new toned body in the anime. Now I have to wait even longer.  Holy shit, ufo can't do anything without TM. This anime is pretty much dead with both the screening and now first episode delayed. <br><br>Hopefully people will stop sucking ufo cock now.</br></br>  <br>If episode 1 is really going to air mid august then you might as well cancel the show or make it a short OVA. That's fucking ridiculous.</br>  <br>Yeah, I hope ufo will give him a raise to do HF. Miura's ok but I need someone much much better. Hell I'll even take Aoki if that's not possible.</br>  You are kidding me. Ufotable shouldn't have these kind of problems.  <br> Aoki <br>Got a feeling so complicated. AZ has left me with an irrational dislike for him.</br></br>  <br>To be fair I blame a lot of A/Z's problems on its horrible writing. They needed to keep butcher or get someone more competent than the writer for boku no pico. The direction for the most part was decent, and while it lacked at times the writing hurt the show the most. Plus Aoki's better at adaptations than original anime.</br>  Orchestr/a/ turns 1 year old today, and we're celebrating by releasing our very first album.<br><br>MP3 - https://mega.co.nz/#!zJNF0AyB!UXJxp<wbr>kBovjS7N0QmyytAb9TBZ-DysosVweWeflam<wbr>k2A<br>FLAC - https://mega.co.nz/#F!qVEylRZI!rr1L<wbr>md4U2KkqlKgp43Er-w<br>MF Mirror [MP3] - http://www.mediafire.com/?1t9nxjqym<wbr>sebsil<br>YouTube: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dq6<wbr>yF7Kh4DY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>A huge thanks goes out to all of the /a/nons who made this possible.</br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Looks great, thanks. <br><br>Wanted to join in but I had non stop classes during times when threads were up.

I volunteered to play the flute for Wareta Ringo and even recorded it but never sent it in because it was awful ;_; I'm glad the flautist whose track you used was much better than mine was  <br>Keep on practicing, hopefully they'll write some easier parts that you can send in!

Thanks and GJ.  <br>Wow, thanks Jung! It's awesome.</br>  <br>Its almost as good as the Titanic Theme tune done on a recorder.</br>  <br>I'll keep practising so that one day I can play Chinese Cartoon music with everyone.<br><br> dat Kuchizuke Diamond <br>Fuck. Seriously, great job. I know that everyone says that it's okay to suck and still submit recordings but I'd much rather that they use yours/anyone who played it better than mine.</br></br></br></br>   streaming music   <br>For you</br>  This thread interests me but a friendly reminder that you don't need to use tripcodes for everyone to know what instrument you play  <br>duly noted friend</br>  <br>You can visit the pad any time. Some of the people get enthusiastic occasionally and do side projects so I'm sure we'll find something for you to record that you'll be content with.</br>  <br>That's why there are no tripcodes being used friend :^)</br>  <br>I added three to my list just from this thread</br>  <br>Doubling of parts can also happen.</br>  Just listened to the whole thing. I fucking loved it. Some of it was really good, some of it was pretty rough, but the whole thing was fun. The fact you shoved various instruments to take the place of vocals was pretty fucking funny (and even worked occasionally). A+, keep it coming guys,  <br>Well they're gay for using secure tripcodes anyway.</br>  <br><br>Guilty as charged, but I've seen people try to impersonate each other on these kinds of threads before, which is a pain in the ass.</br></br>  <br>Only Clarinet uses a secure one though.</br>  <br> list <br>Why would you keep a list of trips?</br></br>  This shit is worse than /jp/'s compilation album  <br>Classic Guitar and Sax also use trips.<br><br><br> Not keeping track of wannabe e-celebs </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was referring to my filter list</br>  Dat fucking Renai.  <br> worse <br>Worse is better with these tracks.</br></br>  <br> comparing an album of rerecordings to a mixtape <br>Well, I guess that's fair.</br></br>  <br>I know I do.</br>  <br>Sounds like an overreaction, but sure, whatever.</br>  <br> /jp/ album <br>I actually want to hear this, link?</br></br>  <br> not immediately filtering all trips who have no reason to be using a trip <br>It's made my life on 4chan a lot more enjoyable, that's for sure</br></br>  <br>Filters are for the weak.</br>  <br>moot was right, /a/ is indeed best girl!</br>  Imitation is really good, it sounds like the real thing except at a lower bit rate.  <br>moot?</br>  <br>There's an option to make everyone appear anonymous. Even then all the trips in this thread are harmless.</br>  <br> native anonymize filter <br> trips are actually useful (at least not harmful) for this thread </br></br>  <br>too soon</br>  <br>This is fucking beatiful</br>  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/c<wbr>az9uuvan03c5z1/%EF%BC%8Fjp%EF%BC%8F<wbr>+Music+Compilation+One.7z</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>But I actively want to ignore tripfags, not just make everyone anonymous. Although it's true that I come from  /sp/  where trips are generally a lot worse. Still no real reason to use one here.</br>  <br>Trips have a way of talking that is very unlike other anonymous posters, they play it safe because they feel they might harm their internet rep and make internet personalities. Not to mention interactions between two tripfags.</br>  <br>I don't know why the link came out like that<br>http://www.mediafire.com/?caz9uuvan<wbr>03c5z1</wbr></br></br>  <br>It works either way, Anon.</br>  <br>I don't even use a trip outside of this thread when I normally post, how the fuck do I even have internet rep.</br>  There's an orchestr/a/!? How do I get in on this!?  <br>Sounds like you have personal experience with tripfagging.</br>  <br/>  <br>Please stop being a namefag and read the thread for your answer.</br>  <br> 222 <br>Nice trips brah</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's called spending any amount of time on any board of 4chan.</br>  <br>Uhm,<br>titanpad com/orchestra<br>when it's not down.</br></br></br>  Probably going to be redundant but it still lacks power from lacking musicians. <br><br>On the other hand it's pretty good, nisemono is perfect.<br><br>Still no pianist though?</br></br></br></br>  <br>A guitar has strings, r-right?</br>  <br>That sounds nothing like the trips on /a/. They're known for their shit taste and are hated even when their posts make sense, which rarely do.</br>  for the next cover you should have a section of rei clones  <br>We work with whatever we've got. Someday we hope to upgrade to philh/a/rmonic. <br><br>Also we have a few pianists  myself included, though I never record </br></br></br>  <br>The only /a/ tripfag I know of is Lelouch, everybody else seems to get harassed into oblivion.</br>  <br>It's tough to include piano in many arrangements.<br>There are a few that require a keyboard/piano part though, so if you're a pianist feel free to check them out. (Zoku Zoku from Hidamari and Penguindrum's first OP come to mind.)</br></br>  Alright, I'll try my hand at a few of the pieces that need trumpet. I need the motivation to start practicing again anyway.<br><br>The duet from Hibike looks fun.</br></br>  <br>I apologize, I am indeed a newfag. I read the first few posts then skipped to the bottom..</br>  <br>Mine doesn't ;_;<br>As with everyone else, drop in on the pad when it's not down and say hi.<br><br><br>Famously has piano, right? Pretty much the only thing it has :^)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but Famously isn't happening anymore because certain people hate fun ;_;</br>  FUCK WHY DID I LEAVE MY BASS CLARINET AT HOME WHEN I MOVED<br><br>Who /marchingbandfag/ here?</br></br>    <br> 9 minutes of narration <br> fun </br></br>  <br>It better be a Buffet or Yamaha, or you're a fag.</br>  <br>Wow, some of those songs are actually pretty good. Didn't know /jp/ was capable of something like this.</br>  <br>Hey if it wasn't for Famously we never would have gotten those vocaroos. You know the ones.</br>  <br>Yamaha actually. Nice taste anon. I have an electric bass with me, but I'm sure there are better players than me.</br>   Masshiro world <br>This is glorious. Wish I could play an instrurment so I could join you faggots.</br>  <br>That's me! I played bass clarinet, but I'm broke. Had to use a school instrument. Still have a clarinet, tenor saxophone, a few flutes, a trumpet, and a trombone that I've aquired over the years, all I can at least make a noise on. I'm really a reedist though.</br>  <br>Today's a great day to learn anon.</br>  <br>Fuck I'm jealous. I'm in college and all I've got is a low level trumpet, but I would probably buy a whole orchestra's worth of instruments if I had the cash.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think my most liked track is Ascend, which is sampled from Blue by SoutaiseiRiron.</br>  <br>Sure. I'll be back at my parents house for the holidays which has a pretty nice piano so if you have any requests feel free to ask.</br>  <br>My mufuckin nigga. Too bad them shits expensive.</br>  <br>Shhhh, those are secret!</br>  <br>Which instrument should I learn. Lefty with a lefty guitar but no desire to learn it.</br>  The titanpad seems to be completely non-existant rather than just down. is there a fall back anywhere?  <br>Why on earth do you not have enough money for your main instrument but have a ton of other (also expensive) instruments?</br>  <br>l-lewd</br>  <br>hand me downs. nothing I have is great quality...</br>  <br>You're posting on an instrument right now, try starting with that. Piano is another good choice if you have the money for it.</br>  <br>My G3 is an instrument?

No point in buying an expensive instrument if you're not sure you'll practice it longer than a week.</br>  <br>Any idea where I can get some elaborate online lessons on guitar for free or cheap?</br>  <br>Youtube?</br>  Pad's going apeshit with all the new folks - join us on the cytube link if you're having woes getting on.  <br>/mu/ has a guitar general</br>  <br>justinguitar is usually pretty good for most people</br>  <br>If you're going to use your computer then it should be with a keyboard. It's better if it's only live performances.</br>  You guys looking for a harmonica guy?<br><br>I can play Fuura Kafuka (Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei), Shingakki (1) (Azumanga Daioh), Après la pluie, le beau temps (Sora no Woto), Modokashii Sekai no Ue de (Piano) (Welcome to the NHK), Heionbuji [Slow Version] (Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni),Yume Sekai (Sword Art Online)<br><br>I also suck mega ducks</br></br></br></br>  <br>try the guitar general threads on /mu/, they have a ton of resources</br>  <br>Hell no don't go there, all they talk about is gear and none of them know how to read music.</br>  <br>doesn't the OP have a bunch of links?</br>  <br> /mu/ <br> actual musicians <br>seriously, this orchestr/a/ had more legitimate musicians than they do.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh /mu/</br>  <br>This was a good listen, nice work.</br>  <br> none of them know how to read music <br>What is it with people and illiteracy? Music is easier than learning English, which they probably don't speak very proficiently anyway.</br></br>  <br>You can work without a keyboard, but a keyboard is definitely a good idea. If you have the money for a nice hardware synth, get one of those as well.</br>  <br>Why didn't you guys cover this? please cover it https://<span>youtu.be/4DilR3Ye8DI  [ ]</br>  <br><br>Guitarfags tend to care more about chord charts than actual sheet music. For casual playing, especially with popular tunes, chord charts are often more useful anyway.</br></br>  <br>This shit is bretty good.</br>  <br>There's a huge request dump at the bottom of our pad, this would be just one in dozens of other requests.<br><br><br>Maybe I'm just an elitist as fuck classical guitarist, but no guitarist who doesn't bother trying to learn how to read music is no musician. Hence, nobody on /mu/ is an actual musician.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not our fault arrangers hate us.<br> here's the chords and rhythm sheet, do that thing you always do </br></br>  <br>Now now, let anons make requests if they want. It's not as though the pad is consistently accessible right now anyway.</br>   That colors <br><br>I've always wanted to hear a shitty cover made by a bunch of NEETS and weaboos</br></br>  you all need to get some good mics i can hear no bass at all and it leaves it feeling flat  piano and classical guitar are the only ones committed from this though   <br>It's not the mics, we just don't have any bass players. Low brass is covered by literally one person.</br>  <br>You can't hear bass because we pretty much have one instrument in that range.</br>  <br>Good job.<br>Could you guys cover Uchuu Sekan yamato ?<br>The orchestral version would sound great.</br></br></br>  Terrible.   God Knows <br> Masshiro world <br><br>I love you /a/. Every single one of you faggots.</br></br></br>  2.3/10 BNM  <br>more like  treble <br>  because there's only one bass player </br></br>  Good thing I don't have an ear for music at all. <br>Just so long as it sounds enough like the original that I can tell what it is, I'm happy.</br>  I assume everyone who participated in Listen!! doesn't know how to play in tempo.  <br>It's not that bad aside from the accordion(? harmonica?) section in the middle making me nearly laugh up a lung. And that doesn't really have anything to do with the mixing.</br>  <br> dat guitar version of GuP </br>  <br>Can we also get more arrangers?</br>  I thought this was just going to be another /a/ Sings album, but this was much better.<br><br>Good job.</br></br>  <br> assuming </br>  <br>melodica</br>  <br> more arrangers <br>That might help us whittle down our huge requests list</br></br>  <br>It's a melodica. The player miscounted the rests and came in a bar (a couple seconds) early.</br>  I have a 10-year old Yamaha PSR-273 that has a dead B2 and with the rubber buttons essentially solidified from age.<br>I also have a Sousa Band No. 1010H harmonica, Bluesmaster 'A' harmonica, a Hohner Special 20 E, a Koch-Harmonica Chromatic 980/40, and Hohner Chromonica 270.<br>For recorders, I have a Sopranino Baroque 'B' and Alto recorders as well as a Welton and Angel 'B' recorder. I also have B and D tin whistles.<br>And finally, I have a Samick 'Artist Series Edition' electric guitar.<br><br>God damn.<br><br>I need to practice more though. I can't really use any of my harmonicas other than the first two and the recorders other than the Welton and Alto since those were previously owned by my grandfather before his passing (The Alto virtually untouched), and have smells of pipe tobacco in them, so I should probably try to get them cleaned out professionally.<br><br>Pic related: My electric looks almost exactly like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sis Puella Magica is actually pretty good. Was it based off ice's version?  The only thing this needs is a Spice and Wolf song cover. Preferaby OP 2 or ED 2  <br>I had a dream about this thread last month. I very vividly saw the OP's image and all the replies. I had no idea that orchestr/a/ was even a thing until today.<br>Needless to say this is a very strange experience.</br></br>  <br>Yes, actually.</br>  Do you guys plan on covering Before My Body Is Dry?  <br>Actually I believe it was.</br>  <br>Get a lotto ticket with your post number.</br>  <br>Predict my future, anon.</br>  <br>3spooky</br>  <br> I have a lot of instruments <br>Why aren't you playing with us yet?<br><br><br>It's a sign, join us</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is fate anon, download our album</br>  <br>ren'ai circulation is fucking killing me, is that a kazoo?</br>  <br><br>Fuck yeah, we want you.<br>There aren't any actual harmonica parts (since we didn't have any harmonica players), but if you want to play a song you can make a recording or ask for an arranger to write a part for you. If there's anything else you want to play, feel free to mention it/record for that too.<br>The pad (linked in the thread earlier) is our main workspace, but in case it's down all the information is here: http://pastebin.com/qicTVnwH<br><br>Also, to second anon, nice gear.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you every have a dream about me having friends?</br>  <br>Maybe you saw our threads before but didn't notice it.<br>It's not like this is the first time the cover was posted on /a/ either.</br></br>  <br> Après la pluie, le beau temps (Sora no Woto) <br>Oh god yes.</br></br>  <br>It is.

I'm sorry but what was used in the Puella one?<br><br>Viola or Violin?<br><br>What kind of flute?<br><br>I loved it, I want to try an instrument now and I liked the sound of both</br></br></br></br></br></br>  wonderful  <br>Well, we'll have another thread sooner or later, so update us when you've got access and if there's a song you want to play.</br>  <br>Nice, looking forward to working with you.<br><br>The melody during the chorus was a violin, and it used an oboe and a clarinet instead since we had no flautist during that time.</br></br></br>  <br>got a request in titanpad. http://vocaroo.com/i/s18W2t7gT0AC</br>  <br><br>Thankyou so much anon</br></br>  <br>last one for the night. hope you anons enjoyed what I played. http://vocaroo.com/i/s0xQpyiUCvhR</br>  <br> ridiculous arrangements <br> hilarious performance <br>Cracked me up, /a/, this must have been helluva fun ride. If you had actually done this while physically being together I would've even envied you somewhat.</br></br></br>  <br> physically being together <br><br>B-but that's lewd!</br></br></br>  <br> B-but <br/></br>  <br>glad you like that one anon. Took me the afternoon to write</br>  <br>you guys should've done this one<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0X9<wbr>tQZFzijc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> We're working on it </br>  <br>Vol. 2</br>  <br> Some anons made the Hanayamata OP happen <br>I love you guys so much, congratulations to everyone who participated!</br></br>  <br><br> nice </br></br>  Impressive  <br>amazing 69/420</br>  Would a mediocre electric bass player help? I can play and read sheet music. is there someone who finds arranges for the group to play or is it all on an individual basis and then someone mixes in what sounds good and what doesn't? This sounds like it was a lot of fun.  <br>You're welcome to join us! <br><br>We have arrangers who either transcribe the original songs by ear or arrange them for whatever instruments we have available. We then have mixers put all of the good takes together.</br></br></br>  If anyone has a dog, we're currently planning to do the Excel Saga ending theme and could use some dog samples.<br><br><br>A little bit of both, but now it's mostly the first one. You can tell on the album which songs were arranged by an anon vs. the songs that were made by just everyone making up their own parts.<br>I'm pretty sure there are some bass parts that need recording, so feel free to give it a gander. If there aren't, there are bound to be some later on, so keep your eyes peeled for threads or lurk in the pad.</br></br></br></br>  Really good anons, maybe one day I`ll join you guys  <br>Where and when is the orgy?</br>  <br> Album Release <br> 1 year old today <br>You have no idea how moved I am right now. I promise I'll contribute more the coming year.</br></br></br>  Good work!  <br>All the time in Gensokyo.<br><br><br>Thanks for being around, look forward to more from you too.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Here's the part for dog.</br>  <br>I have a dog, what am I supposed to do here?</br>  <br>/a/ Sings is the poor man's Orchestr/a/.</br>  <br>I'd assume just make it bark and record it, he said he was after samples so he'll just change the pitch with some program.</br>  <br>tap it's head and the sounds come out</br>  <br>Good, I'll get some tomorrow, since everyone is sleeping.<br><br><br> like my dogs give enough of a fuck to bark at a head tap <br>I'll recruit black guy, they hate them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just wanna say it feels good to be in the background comments</br>  Sadly lacks in the best instrument that's  piano .  <br>There are many songs that has piano though?</br>  <br>All songs have piano if you try hard enough.<br><br>It just overpowers most other instruments when it appears where it shouldn't.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea what you're trying to say.</br>  <br>That more songs with pianos would be cool.</br>  <br>You should arrange some pieces for us that include piano</br>  <br><br>This is why I never liked pianos.</br></br>  <br>It's the same with flute/trumpet. The hog all the attention instruments.</br>  <br> Soutaiseiriron <br>Great fucking taste, /jp/friend.<br><br><br>I'm proud for you, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>The thing is writing a part for a piano is like making an entire arrangement on it's own, which is pretty troublesome. And pianos usually don't stand out very well in large songs with lots of instruments playing in unison, so they're mostly used for soft sounding stuffs like Sora ni Hikaru.<br>That's what I think, at least in the context of Orchestr/a/.</br></br></br>  <br>That one got me good.</br>  <br><br>Like white on rice</br></br>  <br>I was going to congratulate you guys but then I saw Minnie-mouse-ribbon-wearing bitch from that garbage show in OP's pic and I'm now immensely disappointed in everyone involved with this.</br>  <br> not liking Nozaki <br>Please.</br></br>  <br>It's dull shit. <br>Nice job on the orchestr/a/ everyone. Way better than the attention whoring singingfags.<br> I'm getting the fuck out of here.</br></br></br>  <br> Way better than the attention whoring singingfags. <br><br>One takes skill the other is people playing on instruments.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No need to hate on each other, you both are equally bad.</br></br>   didn't get to join <br> ;_; <br><br>I knew I should have dug up my grandfather's old ass bamboo flute and shimasen when I had the chance.</br></br></br>  <br> shamisen <br>They're still giving me shit about not playing on Joshiraku. Shit's hard.</br></br>  Orchestr/a/ anime when?  Hey guys<br><br>I know we don't agree on things too often, but can we at least agree that Suou is the best DTB girl?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Only because red hair and pantyhose  Who? I don't remember any girl named Suou.  Who? <br>I don't recall seeing such a character in all 26 episode of the series.</br>  <br><br> This denial  <br>Slav Kana a cute and Yin died.</br></br></br>  After avoiding S2 for years because of the "it doesn't exist" meme, I finally decided to watch it last week and  it was actually pretty good .  <br>It was  alright <br>That ending really is as bad as everyone makes it out to be though.</br></br>  <br>the only reason people like to pretend it doesn't exist is because there will never be a conclusion</br>  <br><br>I don't remember her in the OVA<br><br><br><br>I feel like Yin 'died' wouldn't be the issue If such a scenario happened..</br></br></br></br></br></br>  fuck no<br><br>yin is the best</br></br>  <br>The ending is absolutely balls. Powerless Hei and his new fighting style is great though.</br>  <br>What pisses me off about Suou is that she never used that rifle on anyone, while we got to sit through every one of those magical girl transformation sequences. That power is retarded to start with, I mean how did Hei's electricity turn into that?</br>  <br><br>This thread again. No no I hate arguing who is the best girl character in any given show but I can't stand by and agree with this statement in the slightest.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Who?<br><br><br>I'm sorry, I don't remember any of that happening. Yin and Hei ran away together from the Syndicate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>shit taste</br></br>  <br><br><br>The ending on the Hei side of things did piss me off a bit, it kind of necessitates a third season that I realize we'll probably never get. I thought the conclusion for Suou's story was good, though.<br><br>I don't know, I didn't expect the big problem to just be the ending. I've always heard people complaining about Hei being different in it, but it was immediately obvious there was a reason why he became the way he is at the start of the season, and I really liked how he slowly reverted to the way he used to be throughout. I also kept hearing complaints regarding the change in main character, so I expected Suou to be awful but I honestly thought she was pretty good.<br><br>I don't think it measures up to the first season but I thought it wasn't bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, also someone has the Yuki_ona_ass.jpg?</br>  Reminder  <br> implying we watched S2  <br>Horrible fucking season. they only even started to introduce an interesting character at the end. MC was utter dogshit</br></br>  <br> they only even started to introduce an interesting character at the end <br>who?</br></br>  <br>Carmine is the superior redhead.</br>  <br>most accurate depiction of slavland in anime yet</br>    <br>This has to be the least successful way of starting a DTB thread, threads with this OP always die so quick</br>  Hot!  Is this show any good? Worth watching? I heard it was like the chinese batman or something, wasn't really sure what to make of that.<br><br>Like I mean if it's west/clooney/kilmer batman, I'm fuckin down bro, but if it's some like srsbsns tryhard bale type deal, forget it.</br></br>  Suou is best girl  <br>yes suou bestest</br>  <br>Chinese Electric Batman<br><br>It's pretty fucking good, give it a go.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Who?</br></br>  <br>watch the first season</br>    <br><br>That artist is great, he really loves Suou.<br><br>Heard he died in the earthquake, can anyone confirm?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad I just pretend it ended with the first season.</br>  <br>Training bra and pantyhose. This is something I needed.</br>  <br>Nice fanart.</br>  With the help of Sb69 and Kekkai<br>S4 SOON</br>    <br>Yea his first pixiv posts were of her and you can see how his art improves as he contributes for best girl.</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?id=1419371<br><br>his art for anyone interested</br></br></wbr></br>   #<br> &gt;Chinese Electric Batman <br><br>Hei isn't chinese<br>supervisor denies it in Japanese book.<br>Li Shenshun is false name, too.<br><br><br>Hei is Golgo13 clone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice try, Hei and his sister are both chinese</br>  <br>So he loses yin and gets a loli?</br>    I want to cook perumeni for her every day.  Yes. The season itself was shit but Suou was God-tier.  <br>Damn, this is one of the few fanbooks I'd like to own. <br><br><br><br> Who? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I would feel that way if it wasn't so different from the first season, on it's own, I think it could have stood as an okay show. But it's not a good follow-up to DTB imo.</br>  <br>Yes, he gets the best girl in DtB<br><br>  Everyone close to him dies, even the shota  </br></br></br>  <br> who? <br><br>A hero</br></br></br>    <br>You can't be best girl when you're dead.<br><br><br>We don't know if Yin is dead. Most probably fell into a coma.<br><br><br><br>Who?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to the S3 hype by the way? You know that thing about the staff members twitter?  <br>She's not dead, she's on another planet, safe from the hellspawn Yin gave birth to after getting soul fucked by Shion.</br>  <br> Who <br>?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I'll check it out. Thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Normally yes but she's in the same show as Yin so no.</br>  <br>There were a few things I liked about it as a follow up to DTB, like it showing the backstory to Mao who was the only one from the main cast who didn't get his backstory shown in S1.</br>    HEI HEI YOU YOU<br>I DON'T LIKE GIRLFRIEND!<br><br>NO WEI NO WEI<br>I THINK YOU NEED A NEW ONE!<br><br>HEI HEI YOU YOU<br>I COULD BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best Girl </br>    <br>The thing is it had to do with her collar, and plus everyone gets different powers. All though I must agree a rile for a power is just out of place compared to all the other powers.</br>    <br>No. Havok was.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hei's commentary<br><br>岡村天斎「黒たちメンバーは、実は中国人ではありません。」 <br><br>岡村天斎「ええ、実は黒は中国の人ではないんです。 あの料理も、一生懸命覚えて中国人のフリをしているんですよ」 <br><br>This book is recommended, too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the trip who used to do this even around anymore?<br><br><br> Yin died <br>Except she didn't?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br>I have no idea what that says.</br>  <br>how about Yin?</br>   All these pedophiles <br> Not preferring the smart qt 3.14 Christmas cake that has a stable job and is very loyal to you  <br><br>Suou is cute, but daily reminder Misaki is the best girl</br></br></br>  <br> Suou <br>Who?<br><br> Misaki <br>Acceptable taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone is a nigger.</br>  <br>this fuckin guy gets it</br>  <br>After all of these years I still have no idea what that purple patch on the side of his face is.</br>  <br> s3 hype <br><br>It's kinda died down since we haven't received any kind of new speculative info since middle of march. It's been almost 4 fucking months since that cat was revealed on the BONES website and it still hasn't changed. A lot of people are thinking it's going to be Noragami but with all the new info out on the second season like key visuals and even a fucking air date you would think they would've changed it by now. But no, it's still fucking there. The hype will come back when there's some new stuff to talk about. Even Komori one of the head animators/char designers for DTB hasn't posted anything DTB related since March. So yeah, we're in the dark right now but I'm hoping something good will come out of it. My dream is to see a sticky on /a/ with the third season of DTB announced. Who knows, maybe with all the money BONES will get from sbr and KS it's possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Fake birthmark to throw off the feds.</br>    <br>That Chinese Neo was pretty badass.</br>  <br>Just shit like this is why I want more DTB. These fight scenes are so fucking GOAT.</br>    <br>She's cute</br>  ITT: Anime characters who had hard lives.
