[ Over the past couple of days I watched the Monogatari series and really enjoyed it. Am I a pleb with shit taste?<br><br>And why is Hachikuji best girl?<br><br> Also, I now have a toothbrushing fetish </br></br></br></br>  <br>owari in 2 months</br>  <br>Monogatari is for men with fine taste. Only plebians with the attention span of a goldfish would argue otherwise.<br>It's the epitome of theatricality and actually subtle character development.</br></br>  <br>Why do you need /a/ to validate your tastes op?<br><br>And you know why she's best.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh you're in for a treat with the Monogatari threads on /a/.</br>  Normally I'm not bothered by having to watch anime in English, but this series was different. I really felt like I missed out on some important dialog because of the translation.<br><br>As an example, there seemed to be some clever wordplay in the Hachikuji/Araragi scenes that completely went over my head, which I assume is because it didn't translate well.<br><br>It's things like this that make me want to learn moonspeak, but I have no other uses for it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Monogatari is one of the few examples of a series that is popular because it's good. Anyone on /a/ that says it's bad either has zero attention span or is trying to stir shit up for keks.</br>  <br>One of us.<br>Here, have a snake.</br></br>  <br>pretty much one of the few good harems out there</br>  It's a harem but it's good.  Post OST<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=C7C<wbr>QdCvosTQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qH0<wbr>CXua9lpg</wbr>  [ ]</br>  I think I've seen every Momogatari (including kaiki )called best girl except Snail.  <br>snail has good reaction images.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Iwr<wbr>BpMvxefQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Snail's one of the more popular girls. Where have you been?</br>  <br>but she ded</br>  It was mostly  boring <br>with good animation <br>and  interesting characters </br></br>  <br> boring <br> interesting characters <br><br>how?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Story never caught my attention. But it doesn't mean it was bad.</br>  <br><br><br>That good taste. I have faith in Monogatarifags now.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e15<wbr>VUsxqtbY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Waifuism aside, was anyone else shocked during the   cliff hanger when Nadeko started going more unhinged after reading Araragi's diary only for him to end the episode saying her dream was impossible?   I absolutely loved that tension only to end it on such a note.  <br>For me, in regards to monogatari, the slot for best girl is solely dependent on which of them is the most enjoyable to listen to. Most of them I really like, especially Hackikuji and Tsubasa, but none as much as Shinobu.<br>I fucking love Shinobu.</br></br>  <br>Snailfags are nice. They rarely insult other girls. I like them. Also helps that she's one of the best girls.</br>  <br>you have great taste, my friend, Monogatari is a masterpiece of modern animation.<br>Snail is best girl because all the gataris are best girl. Even snake.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bDk<wbr>NEWSPl2Y&amp;index=10&amp;list=PLPjgBWiybDL<wbr>Di20NsJNP0H8j7thQ4jZVJ</wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>tsuki ost was good.</br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-zz<wbr>GPpju9vs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ;________; </br></br></br></br>  I like crab the most  <br>Snakefag here.

Probably the best gatari fans, even better than fellow Snakefags on average.<br><br>Release order.</br></br></br>  So we all can agree that the AOTS candidates are<br><br>Gangsta - 4<br>Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri - 4<br>God Eater - 2<br>Overlord - 3<br><br>Personally for me God Eater and Overlord maybe tempting, but didn't deliver anything noteworthy yet. Therefore I'm thinking that Gangsta and GATE are the best series this season (at least for now), so either if them being AOTS would be fine for me.<br><br>But which one is the actual AOTS? What do you think /a/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  We already had two polls that turned out similar results<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/5021749/r<br>http://strawpoll.me/4990489/r</br></br></br>  <br>One of those doesn't even have the series mentioned in the OP and I think 30 people hardly represent /a/'s taste.</br>  Here is an objective list of the best anime this season.<br>Everything else is garbage.</br>  <br>189 voters &gt; 1 person (i.e. you)</br>  <br>I didn't say that my opinion is above their's, you misunderstood.

AS is literally a disappointment except if you're a fujoshi. Then it's pretty good I guess.</br>  <br> but ignoring Gangsta and Gate is aweful. <br> pretentiously edgy fujobaiting dreck and cliched fightan for boys who just hit puberty show #954692954 </br></br>  So Gangsta is Aots material? I've been hovering around starting it.<br>I was on the hype train when they announced.</br>  <br>What's good about Gangsta? Please, I really want to know. <br><br>I had to stop watching once it introduced actual powerlevels.</br></br></br>  <br>A true patrician can appreciate things about all genres and subgenres, anon. Your complete dismissal of any genre or subgenre simply reveals your plebeian status. I believe that you may fit in more at /v/ than here.</br>  <br>Yeah, but watching as an adult shows for little japanese girls is of course better than that.<br><br><br> I had to stop watching once it introduced actual powerlevels. <br>the thing is the author is retarded and like every shonenfag inconsistent with that, so powerlevels are very fast sidelined along with the difference between the superhuman and humans, so you can outright ignore that subplot. Overall Gangsta is pretty entertaining and somehow doesn't feel episodic in the least.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know it's false<br>End yourself and your shitposting<br><br>True retardation</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still better that SoLcrap about cute girls</br>  <br> n-no you <br> can't even say any argument against it <br>YOU are the one who should kill himself you insecure faggot.</br></br></br>   Non Non Shitori topping everyones lists <br>this season is truly worthless</br>  <br>  gangsta <br>  we <br>fuck off shithead and stop trying to enforce your shitty tastes on everyone</br></br></br>  <br><br>The powerlevels and terrible nonsensical worldbuilding it tries to do around Twilights can get pretty dumb. Hopefully there will be even less in the anime.</br></br>  <br>While your statement is incorrect, CGDCT SoL is pretty much the only thing that anime and manga do better than any other media, and it's almost exclusive to anime and manga as well (I say almost because, technically, any live action sitcom with a mostly or all female cast is CGDCT SoL), so it's obviously one of the primary justifications for the existence of anime and manga.</br>  <br> The powerlevels and terrible nonsensical worldbuilding it tries to do around Twilights can get pretty dumb <br>The manga itself did shit on the twilights though and made everyone human and twilight the same kind of danger, so all the powerlevel creep gets blasted mid-story out of nowhere.</br></br>  <br> Yeah, but watching as an adult shows for little japanese girls is of course better than that. <br> this /v/ermin is so goddamn ig'nant that he thinks CGDCT shows are for girls and not seinen </br></br>  <br>CGDCT wasn't introduced until the late 90s/early 2000s though. Hardly a justification for the existence of anime and manga when it wasn't one of the founding pillars.</br>  <br> /v/ermin <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br><br> The manga introduces plot elements then completely disregards them <br> It's a good series guys, honest! </br></br></br>  <br>The founding pillars were giant robots but that genre is dead.</br>  <br> moving the goalposts </br>  <br>Nope I outright said that it (= unnecessary, scraped powerlevelcreep) is retarded, you have no reading comprehension, but yes, overall, it's a very good series.</br>  <br>Not guy above but you truly have to be a retard to think CGDCT is for girls. Just giving you my 2 cents on the thing.</br>   The gayest sounding buttfags all hate gangsta <br><br>I'm convinced to pick it up. Usually anything the autistic moe SoLfags hate is top tier entertainment.</br></br>  <br>It's for girls and mainly for weeboos or rather for NEETs who actually buy it.</br>  <br> I had to stop watching once it introduced actual powerlevels. <br>Holy shit, I dropped it before this. It actually did that? Wow. How terrible.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, I'm a moe SoLfag but Gangsta was entertaining, at least for the first 2 episodes. Episode 3 shat itself world-building-wise and led absolutely no-fucking-where.</br>  Gangsta is literally Black Lagoon 3: The Case of the Missing Budget.  <br>CGDCT anime are usually adaptations of manga. CGDCT manga are usually published in seinen magazines. Some, like ARIA, are published in shonen magazines.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_N<wbr>on_Biyori<br> Demographic: Seinen <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine<wbr>n_manga<br> Seinen manga (青年漫画?) are manga marketed to boys and men old enough to read kanji. <br><br>GTFO newfag.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br>  <br> CGDCT manga are usually published in seinen magazines. <br>that doesn't change the fact that the group(s) which the anime are made for is the one that I just told you.</br></br>  <br> But which one is the actual AOTS? <br>It was Non Non Biyori the last time you made this blatant trollthread (you really expect us to think it's a coincidence that all of them are "manime?") and it's still Non Non Biyori.</br></br>  <br> men old enough to read kanji. <br> what is a NEET? <br>Look it up.</br></br></br>   this thread <br>Thanks for remembering me of how good my taste is.</br>  <br>At this point it is no longer possible for you to pretend to be retarded and have it be even remotely believable anymore. Stop.</br>  <br> GATE and God Eater are manime <br> Gangsta isn't moe <br> Overlord isn't weeboo/NEET stuff <br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I have no argument left, so I pretend that I won while dodging the posts I quote <br>Why do you even post then?</br></br>  <br> men old enough to read kanji. <br> what is a NEET? <br>KEK. Any man older than fucking 15 can effectively read kanji. That doesn't necessarily mean all of them are NEETs, or else the country is fucking doomed. CGDCT is a good relaxation method destined to most men.</br></br></br>  <br> That doesn't necessarily mean all of them are NEETs, or else the country is fucking doomed.  <br>That wasn't what I was implying. I implied that those that actually buy it and secure that that stuff is made that way are NEETs.<br><br> CGDCT is a good relaxation method destined to most men. <br>You wish. Can you prove that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What is mecha </br>  <br>Why should I reply seriously to shitposts?<br>This season is good, people here just have shit taste</br></br>  <br>So you admit to shitpost instead of arguing? Good then fuck off.</br>  <br>The Transformers movies &gt; any mecha anime except Evangelion, and even then certainly not for Eva's mecha scenes</br>  <br>Why should I fuck off because I shitpost at shitposters? Why should I seriously argue with faggots when I know it's a lost cause?<br>You fuck off, shitposter-san</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself, pathetic moefag with shit taste<br>And before you boogeyman at me, I haven't visited /v/ even once.</br></br>  <br> moefag <br><br> I haven't visited /v/ even once <br>Go there and stay there anyways, unless you'd like to lurk moar and learn about anime/manga and /a/ board culture before posting here again, as you clearly need to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't care what a pathetic fucking retard who would insult the holy mecha genre has to say to me, you should die. <br>After what you said about mecha, you proved you are a total retard, and every post you make is thus the work of a retard and not worth taking seriously</br></br>  <br> I don't care what a pathetic fucking retard who would insult the holy mecha genre has to say to me <br>What I said was not an insult, though. Let's be real here. The Transformers movies are very clearly on a completely different, much higher level in terms of technical accomplishments. Anime of any genre has never achieved this level of stunning visuals. It's not an insult to say this as obviously anime has never had that kind of budget to work with. It just is what it is.</br></br>  <br>Why should you post in this thread when you already admitte dto be a shitposter?</br>  <br>And you keep spouting your retardation. <br>Implying the Bayformers shit is better than Mazinkaiser and GaoGaiGar amonst others is something only a fucking retard with brain damage who should die would say. <br>The only good mecha thing the west has done lately is Pacific Rim. <br>Saying otherwise proves you're a shitposting retard who should die a very painful death<br>I swear, you f/a/ggots go to retarded extremes just to defend your cute girls shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 5. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime <br>Are you kidding?</br></br>  <br>It feels great when your favorite show is rarely talked about on /a/ aside from airing threads.</br>  <br>AOTY is Non Non Biyori, anon.<br><br> Kill yourself, pathetic moefag with shit taste <br> this as a reply to an anonymous poster which didn't mention "moe" at all, nor did the post it was replying to <br>Holy shitpost Batman. I wonder how long I could go around /a/ calling random people moefags for no reason and telling them to kill themselves before I got banned.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128627977 <br>Why are you so autistic? I mean like just turn away from the monitor when you're so butthurt, it isn't that hard.</br>  <br> I swear, you f/a/ggots go to retarded extremes just to defend your cute girls shit <br>Again.<br> everybody who posts an opinion I don't like is a "moefag" <br>No. They're not. This is intentionally attempting to start fanbase wars and this is shitposting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So we should let shitposters shitpost? Should we take their shitposts seriously? You're the butthurt one here m8<br><br>He deserved it for insulting the holy mecha genre. Only retarded moefags would do that</br></br></br>  <br> So we should let shitposters shitpost? Should we take their shitposts seriously? <br>Just ignore a post that actually triggers you, retard.<br><br> You're the butthurt one here m8 <br>Kek, stay sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The shitpost was the insult to the holy and great works the mecha genre has provided us. I won't accept blasphemies like that</br>  <br> That post <br> Still won't admit to being butthurt <br>Kek, stay delusional m80</br></br></br>  <br>Are you mentally challenged?</br>  <br> So we should let shitposters shitpost? <br>Reporting and not responding is most recommended option.</br></br>  <br>Are you?</br>  <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128627977 <br> I wonder how long I could go around /a/ calling random people moefags for no reason and telling them to kill themselves before I got banned. <br>I guess the answer is "about 20 minutes."<br>Also, this season is real nice. Best so far this year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying I got banned </br>  <br>underrated post</br>  What an incredible concentration of shit taste in one thread.  <br>Overrated post</br>  <br>Would you prefer "powerlevels" which are really just superhumans or would you really rather just see a dude walk through a narrow alley and kill a bunch of dudes armed with fucking guns with a god damn katana. I thought that shit was retarded until they at least fed me the "oh yeah that nigga can dodge bullets thanks to SCIENCE or some shit"</br>  loving this CGDCT meme<br><br>Whichever fucking board made it ok to use tbh ironically should burn in fucking hell because now spewing acronyms is just fucking gravy.</br></br>  Moeshit cant be AOTS because every moeshit show is garbage by default.  I dropped charlotte when they wanted to go to a magical high school. Did i miss something?  <br> we <br> xD <br>eat a dick, and put your strawpoll up to your ass</br></br></br>  Even though it's a straight up shounen, I'm actually enjoying Ushio to Tora quite a bit.<br><br>I feel like Gangsta started out strong, but the direction is going to shit. I do hope it gets better.</br></br>  <br>UtT has a enjoyable manga, but the anime is absolutly trashy and the pacing alone is cancerous.</br>  <br>I never read the manga, but I like the fast pacing of the anime. They don't spend a whole episode talking and explaining shit with still frames and there's actual action and animation.</br>  Gate's kinda boring right now. It feels like it's just going through the motions for the most part. Lovin' Gangsta and Overlord but Overlord tops Gangsta.Also, are monster waifus not an option?  <br>In the manga the enemys actually have a value while the anime reduces everything to fit it into one episode and basically re-lables the series as episodic garbage.</br>  <br>I get what you're saying. I feel the same way towards Prison School. I read the manga, and the anime is just rushing through everything, making each event feel less significant. It's a good thing I didn't read UtT's manga then.</br>  <br>I'm enjoying it. Whether it's best or not is to personal taste, but it's shitty people in a shitty city being shitty to one another while having the occasional obnoxious fights with each other. A less high octane Black Lagoon with a larger focus on bromance is how I've been describing it.<br><br>The OP is catchy as shit, though.</br></br></br>  <br>animeonlyfag, I too enjoy the episodic pacing. Cliffhangers can really kill a series.</br>   Miyu and Shirou are not blood related <br>Why is this allowed?<br>WHY IS THIS FUCKING ALLOWED?</br></br>  <br>Does this have anything to do with any of the fate night routes or not?</br>  <br>Wait, what? If that's true then what has the point of the this entire fucking series been? I thought Miyu was supposed to be from the family he had before the fire?</br>  Of course. Miyu is Japanese. We all know Shirou is a fucking mick.  <br>There were absolutely no indications that they were blood related, so I don't know why this is a surprise.<br><br>In fact the series is hammering in that Miyu is basically an alternate Illya and Illya isn't exactly blood related to Shirou either.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does the anime have Big-Head Mode enabled?</br>  <br>Highly likely that she's the daughter of Kiritsugu and Maya.</br>  The spoilers said she had red eyes when they found her and she could grant wishes. She probably wished herself into being Shirou's sister.  <br> &gt;Miyu and Shirou are not blood related </br>  <br> NTR <br>Oh the irony.</br></br>  <br>Shirou doesn't want to screw either of them.</br>  <br>So they can ruin this scene when it gets adapted.</br>  <br>Why would he? Neither of them needs mana transfer.</br>  <br> That side-chapter where Rin raised so many flags it looked like the flags would burst out of Shirou's pants and fuck Rin </br>  Rin x Fluffy Shirou end<br>Luvia x GAR Shirou end<br>Illya x Kuro x Miyu 3P ending<br><br>Official pairings. You can't prove me wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm wondering if it'll get animated. It happens just a little after the beach episode, which is coming up.</br>  So is Hiryuu subbing the OVA as well as Herz?<br>If so, they need to hurry the fuck up.</br>  <br>Luvia x Fluffy Shirou end<br>(Illya x Kuro x Miyu) x GAR Shirou end<br>Rin x old men = money end</br></br></br>  <br><br>Everybody x nobody end, like every fucking thing ever.</br></br>  <br>Rin will win both Shirou and earn the harem she deserves.</br>  <br>Except for Rin, she still need the money.</br>  <br> why? <br>I like how even Type-Moon is poking fun at Shirou about that being his catch phrase.</br></br>  <br>She can marry Luvia.</br>  <br>They are blood-related. Nice bait by the way.</br>  <br> They are blood-related <br>Proof?</br></br>  <br>They call each other brother and sister and they never say that they're not blood-related. Assuming that they have the same parents makes sense since nobody says "this is my blood-related sister". Also they have the same eyes.</br>  <br><br>Latest chapter spoilers reveal that she already had a reputation/cult surrounding her in Fuyuki due to her powers long before Kiritsugu and Shirou ever met her.<br><br>They're NBR.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then that will mean war.</br>  <br>Are you saying he'd bone Kuro?</br>  <br>Who wouldn't?</br>  <br>Bone? He'd bone a sword.</br>  <br>Shirou has shit mana capacity, it wouldn't do shit even he came inside her.</br>  <br>Well she's technically a card copying a person made out of swords.</br>  <br>So she's a faker of a faker?</br>  <br>You know, considering how asspained Gil gets about the whole fake thing, he took the whole "being a copy stuffed into a card" thing surprisingly well.</br>  <br>Well that's ko-Gil, and that little shit is almost an entirely different character.</br>  <br> smoking Rin <br> Archer always saying 'Emiya Shirou' <br>Everytime.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Doesn't get blown up by a rocket launcher on a plane of zombies. <br> The world ends. <br><br>Maiya a shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maiya ain't Natalia, retard.</br>  <br>I thought she's whats left of the grail's influence with tiny amount of heavens feel.</br>  <br>That spoiler was fake.</br>  5 years and 9 months ago, Kiritsugu and Shirou arrived at Fuyuki City to investigate the Cult/Belief/Religion of the "Child of God" but was iterrupted by a black fog enveloping the city, though shortly It dissapered and Shirou found Miyu in the house of Sayutsuki.<br><br>Kiritsugu understood that the "Child of God" has the ability to grant wishes and alter the present without limitation.<br><br>With this, Kiritsugu decided to adopt the child and bought a house in the city to start his research.<br><br>Shirou wanted to celebrate Miyu's 6th birthday, but Kiritsugu forbade him from doing so, as he wanted to use the child of god to save humanity and end his long journey.<br><br>As a 12 year old child, Shirou is now facing the Emiya family dilemma of choice.<br><br>"Save the world" or "Save Miyu"?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wow this thread is deader than Miyu's hymen.  <br>Many anons died after fapping to death from the OVA and episode 1.</br>  I only want s4  Has the OVA been subbed yet?  <br>No.</br>  <br>When will the OVA be subbed?</br>  <br>Ask Hiryuu.</br>  <br>He was a fake in F/SN and he didn't care at all. He is simply a hypocrite.</br>  <br>Was Gil ever confronted on that?<br><br>Maybe he was one sentence away from having a massive existential crisis that was never brought up over the span of ten years.</br></br></br>  <br>He was very very close to that crisis in UBW. If Rin had opted to use the Catalyst Toki left her, there would have been two Gils.<br><br>Just imagine how much he'd hate himself.</br></br></br>    <br> There were absolutely no indications that they were blood related <br><br>They actually have one physical trait in common that they share with only one other Nasuverse character: they have an extra ring inside their iris, around the pupil. Only one other character in the entire Nasuverse has that, Hisui. Add to that the fact that they have the same eye color (and a color you don't see much of in the Nasuverse either), and it was a fairly reasonable assumption.<br><br>Maybe the author really wanted her to be Shirou's blood sister, but Nasu vetoed it.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Also would you believe I grabbed that image out of searching through moe and not going to Mangafox? I just remembered the name of the manga and wanted to find that page.</br>  Man, the power level in Prisma is all fucked, Kuro is able to trace fucking Excalibur of all things and even fire it like Caladbolg, but somehow can't use full Rho Aias (only 4 petals like what Shirou did in HF).  <br>That is kind of fucking stupid.</br>  <br>to be fair also, miyuverse shirou can straight up make divine artifacts while not giving a singular fuck.</br>  <br> at they were blood related <br>Right Miyu is not blood related a daughter of Sakatuki family.</br></br>  <br>It's still a chinese knockoff tier though.<br><br> I need a bridge <br> PROJECT A BIG SWORD <br>sasuga Shirou</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The author has gone on record to say it has nothing to do with the "main" Nasuverse</br>  <br>That "divine construct" was literaly just a big hollow sword that he used as a bridge.<br>It did literaly nothing</br></br>  <br>Don't bother, people like him don't understand the point of the Kaleidoscope.</br>  <br> In fact the series is hammering in that Miyu is basically an alternate Illya and Illya isn't exactly blood related to Shirou either. <br><br>She's an alternate loli Sakura in role.</br></br></br>  <br>No it isn't even in the Kaleidoscope.<br>It's something completly seperate according to the author</br></br>  <br>And according to Nasu it's the official Ilya route.</br>  <br>Well, Nasu can go fuck himself. This is equally canon as HA, Zero, Extra, and whatever bullshit cashgrab Nasu shits out next.</br>  <br>No, Nasu's on record saying this shit is the official Ilya route. He reveres it like he reveres the Tsukihime manga.<br><br>It's the author himself who's being humble as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Not Nasu.<br><br><br>And Tsukihime 2 is just around the door<br>Stop taking obvious jokes from Nasu seriously</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, for real, Nasu's raved about the Tsukihime manga forever, and he puts Prisma right on that level.</br>  <br>One of these days he's gonna spam Ea all over the place.</br>  Did Shirou get any fights yet in the anime? Have only read the manga.  <br>No. The Illyaverse Shirou doesn't fight at all.</br>  Latest chapter is where?  <br>I hope he does.</br>  <br>He fights off women wanting to fuck him.</br>  <br><br> I need a key <br> Ea is a key <br> TRACE ON <br>makes sense</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and he puts Prisma right on that level. <br>No he doesn't</br></br>  <br>And Illya got her ass kicked by Mech Hisui. Don't think about Prisma powerlevels too much</br>  <br>No, he just gets blown up.</br>  <br>He was joking, idiot.</br>  <br>Shirou is Yamcha of Nasuverse</br>  <br> That Yamcha pose <br><br>Why the fuck hasn't this story been animated?</br></br></br>  <br>Just because it cannot be bridged to the other series does not mean it's not an alternate world. He just wanted to be clear that "this is my work, don't try to connect to the other stuff" in the sense that it's not something supervised by Nasu/Takeuchi like some other spin-offs.</br>  <br><br>Fate powerlevels were always fucked.</br></br>  <br>No, he wasn't.</br>  <br>Not interesting enough. The Rin highjump ones will probably be always skipped as well unless they're really in need of "filler".</br>  <br>Can't wait to see Shirou duct tape EAs to his body at different angles so when activated it will shoot in every direction multiple times because he duct taped EAs on top of EAs below to make super EAs<br><br>I wonder what Gil would think of that.</br></br></br>  <br>They did adapt some of them as BD specials.</br>  <br>Like, are they not "super interesting" enough? Cause I think they're plenty interesting. That chapter right there is the only appearance of Sakura until 3rei, and likewise, the high jump chapter is good character development for Rin, and actually gives you a little insight into this version of Shirou.</br>  <br> That chapter right there is the only appearance of Sakura until 3rei <br><br>Nah, she shows up briefly right at the start of the first series walking to school with Fluffy Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br> pedobait anime <br> wanting to focus on older girls and Shirou <br>And don't even try to deny that it's pedobait</br></br></br>  <br>Is that anime only? Cause I don't remember that in the manga. Could be wrong though.<br><br><br>Yeah, it's totally for people into lolis, but there's other cool stuff the author's done for fans of the series in general. Plus it's not like there's a whole lot of material left with 2wei as is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't know Shirou was in this series.<br>Why does he look like a lesbian tomboy?</br></br>  <br> Is that anime only? Cause I don't remember that in the manga. Could be wrong though. <br><br>It's in both, it's only a single panel/scene though.</br></br></br>  <br>That's Carnival Phantasm.</br>  <br>Is it right in the first chapter? Cause I see Issei, but I don't see Sakura.<br><br>Also, the art's really improved over the years. Fuck.</br></br></br>   beach birthday episode next <br> Sella and Leys aren't there <br>fuck missed opportunity for truth serum Shirou and the meidos in swimsuits</br></br>  <br>Prisma Illya x Carnival Phantasm. They on the same level</br>  <br>They're really not. CP is that type of joke show that doesn't have any solid story and just served for fans of the series, Prisma has it's own settings, world building and a solid built up story.</br>  <br>Can't Neco-Arc just beat anyone?</br>  <br>Here we have crossover where Illya got her ass kicked by Mech Hisui</br>  Huh. I just realized the album that has Last Stardust is out.  <br>Aside from Shiki. He's the only one that can out-troll Neco Arc</br>  <br>Because the anime designs are shit.</br>  <br> world building and a solid built up story. </br>  <br><br>I would definitely say it doesn't world build well. There are so many fucking questions it's ridiculous.</br></br>  <br>To be fair the anime followed the early art of the manga, which was pretty bad.<br>Also that's guy's a different Shirou.</br></br>  <br>As opposed to the airtight mythos of the rest of the nasuverse.</br>  <br><br>I'm not saying it's good, my point is it has it's own setting that differs from the original franchise rather than just a mashed up show for laugh.<br>Of course CP is also great.</br></br></br>  <br>The anime designs are great for fluffiness.</br>  <br>No but for real like, how did anything even fucking happen? The 4th War was the 1st War in the Prismaverse? What's up with that? What happened with that? How did it go down so everything ended up the way it did? Why is Ilya actually 11 as opposed to 18? What's going on with Shirou? Are his parents dead? How did he end up as an Emiya?<br><br>And then we've got the Miyu universe worked into things, and that's trying to build stuff for a whole other world, and it's still convoluted.</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't spell literally every fucking detail out for you to sperg over <br> sperg anyway <br>Just give up now, Prisma clearly isn't for you.</br></br></br>  <br>I like Prisma, man, but we're talking about world building, right? When you can't fucking move an inch without having questions about the world, then that's not good building.<br><br>The chapter is bringing up new questions too. Like supposedly Shirou's been with Kerry for a while, but this is the first time they've visited Fuyuki. Wasn't Shirou from Fuyuki in the first place?</br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah, prisma is basically "turn your brain off and enjoy" so it's not for everyone.</br>  <br>Yeah it's Transformers tier</br>  Can't wait for Gilgaship.  <br>HIROYAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</wbr></br>  <br>Does that mean Shirou can have a LOT OF SEX with Miyu now?</br>  <br>I wonder if there will be a doujin of Illya Shirou fucking Miyu and Miyu Shirou fucking Illya.</br>  When will the manga chapter be out?  <br>Miyu is gonna dyke it up with Ilya.<br><br>Shirou will nab one of the hags.</br></br></br>  <br>Miyu is a ok for the jackhammer.</br>  <br>We need a doujin for that.</br>  <br>Why are you trying to force your bait image?<br>It doesn't even make sense here</br></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>3DCGI</br>  Is the manga chapter out yet?        After the beach party which is next episode there are only 8 chapters left, how do they even pan this out?  <br>Would Kerry wear that if it was a means to fulfill his SEIGI NO MIKATA dream?<br><br>He's willing to sacrifice a kid.</br></br></br>  <br>I always thought about that.</br>  <br>next page please</br>  <br>Only if he can include a gun</br>  <br>its just saber getting angry and shouting "Do you only know dirty jokes" while hitting him</br>    <br>sakura is a slut</br>  <br/>    <br>Hiryuu takes forever.<br><br>Not as much as UTW would if they'd be subbing (which I highly doubt considering how UBW isn't even finished).</br></br></br>  <br>UTW stated that UBW is their last project.<br>They'll do the BDs though</br></br>  should i dump "I want to tease poor saber?" ?  <br>Probably stuff like Nanaki (?) vs Rin and Luvia, the Mimi BL stuff, ect</br>  <br>Yes</br>    <br> that VN text at the end </br>          <br>how do i work this chart?</br>  <br>Who the fuck says "door opens" when they open a door?</br>        <br>poor saber...</br>  <br>You forgot Sakura x Worms end</br>    <br> seriously what does my son love about this britbong midget monkey? </br>            <br>What would actually happen if two gils appeared in the same grail war? Would they fight or become allies?<br><br>I'm guessing each one's ego would be incapable of considering the possibility that they're a copy, and thus they'd both accuse eachother of being the fake and fight to the death, probably destroying the world in the process.</br></br></br>    <br> Nah, she shows up briefly right at the start of the first series walking to school with Fluffy Shirou. <br>The first series starts off with them going home from school, not to school. And Sakura's not there either way so you're definitely remembering wrong.</br></br>  <br>They'd hate each other, it's basically a given.</br>  <br>There's like no way that Gil could stand Gil.</br>  <br> The 4th War was the 1st War in the Prismaverse? <br>Why do you think that it was? Was it ever implied?<br> Why is Ilya actually 11 as opposed to 18? <br>Kerry fucked Iri 7 years later than in the FSN universe, they were to busy to fuck.<br> What's going on with Shirou? Are his parents dead? How did he end up as an Emiya? <br>Not a fucking clue.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Does that mean Shirou can have a LOT OF SEX with Miyu now? <br>It more implies that Miyu now can have a lot of sex with Illya being completely non-related to her without much problems.<br><br>But then knowing how things work in this manga Miyu will be turned into incestfag over Shirou too, but when that will happen we can expect her making out with Illya on Kuro level too to balance things out like they do with Illya and Kuro constantly.<br><br>Bait with yuri, bait with hetincest etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has the raws for the new chapter been dumped yet?  <br>At the very least, it's implied that the ritual is not known to anyone at all. The Einzberns were completely disassociated from everyone else, except the Tohsaka. And nobody at all knows anything of the HGW other than that the Einzberns were planning a ritual ten years before. It's possible it was to be the first ritual, or they just kept everything under tighter wraps.</br>  Does this anime have any normal sexscenes and not only the Yuri ones I saw in other threads?  Kuro vs EMIYA<br>Who wins?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>EMIYA. Kuro still doesn't know how to properly use the Heroic Spirit.</br>  <br>Emiya. Both the cards and corrupted servants are downgraded by a few ranks. Kuro can't pull a proper Excalibur out of her ass like she could in Illya's body, so she can count on that either.</br>  <br>But Archer has no defense for Excaliber though.</br>  <br> The Einzberns were completely disassociated from everyone else <br>Weren't they killed by Kerry and Iri?</br></br>  <br>How is isn't she using it properly? Is it because she doesn't summon the UBW?</br>  <br> Kuro can't pull a proper Excalibur out of her ass <br>Umm, yes she can.</br></br>  <br>It's implied that they no longer exist, but even before that they had no outside connections and were obscure enough that they were not known by name to either Luvia or Rin and had to be looked up through extensive research.</br>  <br>It was "paper mache" compared to the real thing according to the volume profiles.</br>  I feel like it really stood out in this episode how Shirou is the only normal human in the household.  <br>Japanese language is such that it arranges the brain of native speakers to think random sounds are actually words.</br>  <br>All traces of Exclibur are essentially paper mache though. You could say it lacked the amount of magical power it had back in S1, but S1's isn't any more authentic than this one here.<br>Nonetheless EMIYA wouldn't even be able to do something like this without killing himself.</br></br>  <br>Miyu looks pretty normal to me, at least among the homunculus.</br>  <br>Have EMIYA tried kissing the grail for extra mana.</br>  Does anyone remember which episode/season had the initial meeting between Luvia and Miyu? The one in which Miyu tells Luvia she will work for her if she provides her with food and a place to stay.  <br>He does not possess a specific Noble Phantasm, but by using Projection magecraft he can materialize Noble Phantasms. Originally, Excalibur and other things that surpass human limits, divine constructs cannot be projected. For argument's sake even if it were possible, that person is not the user and therefore cannot release the true name. However, the previous Ilya did just that, weakened as it was, its output still exceeded that of the original.<br>Kuro isn't currently able to use such an advanced exploit so the ability of her projected Excalibur is like a paper mache version.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Please no, bullying Fastwheels is too far.</br></br></br>  <br>But she's not part of their household. Nor is she normal.</br>  <br>Essentially the only really difference is that she was not able to call it's true name.</br>  <br>ZA WA RU DO</br>    <br>The difference is that Illya's body allows for some bullshit to make it surpass the downgraded real thing and Kuro's body only allows for a shittier version that is comparable to a mere shell.</br>  Can the Gil card call upon EA?  <br>Does this count?</br>  <br>then he can fuck her right?<br>its better then</br></br>  Since Kuro has the curse seal, doesn't that mean that every time she makes out with Illya she gets double the pleasure since Illya's sensations transfer over to her? <br>This could explain why she left it be.</br>  <br>Wasn't that just Julian pulling it from the mud? Wasn't with the Gil card was it?</br>  <br>It only transfers the pain.</br>  <br><br>It's not like Kuro and Illya are humans anyway.<br>One's the Holy Grails that never happened, the other is, whatever the fuck Kuro is.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the underground fight, it's the Gil card on it's own.</br>  <br>Come on, I don't want to go through 2 seasons for a single scene.</br>  <br> Illya's body <br>You mean the grail's body right? Only possible explanation since the grail can do some crazy stuff when it's loaded with servants AKA magical energy in other words Ruby.</br></br>  <br>It should be season 1.</br>  <br>Kuro is basically the embodiment of "fight to become a grail Illya" which was meant to be sealed away but became it's own personality.</br>  <br><br>Kuro is the holy grail that never happened, given shape by the archer class cars for heroic spirit Emiya, Ilya is the girl that lives in the body of the holy grail that never happened after Kerry and Iri suppressed the grail. Pretty simple shit.</br></br>  So I am watching UBW, but can anyone tell me why Shirou who is a human has the strength to deflect weapons that are traveling at crazy high speeds towards him?<br>Projectiles coming with that much speed should blow his hands off if he tried to deflect it even if the projected weapon is strong enough to handle it his arms shouldn't be.<br><br>So what gives? Is this a plot hole?</br></br></br>  <br>magic</br>  <br>The same reason that Shiki can kill more than 30 phantasmal/magical beasts that are in the process of eating him before anyone can react.<br>Plot Armor</br></br>  <br>Magic.</br>  <br><br>Magic doesn't explain this considering the show has stated that Shirou is shit at magic and that UBW is the only thing he is good at.</br></br>  <br>UBW is magic bro</br>  <br>projection magecraft lets him fake the abilities and skill of the original weapon's user, not just the weapon.</br>  <br>It's magic. I ain't gonna explain shit.</br>  <br>which is why shirou can only do it when he has a sword in his hand. he's shit at all other magic.</br>  <br>UBW is completely overpowered as it allows him to copy the strength and skills of the original wielder of the weapons he projects.</br>  <br><br>Reinforcement magic.<br>Remember?</br></br></br>  <br>You can't just fake "strength" like that, gaining knowledge and skill is one thing but "strength" is just BS.</br>  <br>I don't understand why this complaint is so ubiquitous, is this your first time watching anime - or hell, any fictional story with fighting?<br>Do you complain about this every single time a character does some crazy fighting moves that would be impossible in real life? Basic suspension of disbelief. It looks cool.</br></br>  <br> copy the strength <br>You do realise how stupid that sounds, you can't just copy strenght. Likewise you can't just copy speed.</br></br>  <br>It's magic, of course it's BS.</br>  <br>Magic.</br>  <br>You also can't just make something with hundreds of times your own capacity with only few units of mana, but he does it anyway.</br>  <br>Shirou is depicted as a human with an OP ability, he doesn't or isn't supposed to have servant tier strength. I am following the logic of the show. I can suspend my disbelief as long as the show doesn't break it's own logic.</br>  <br>It could be the class cards. I mean Gil's card took could take over other body's no reason to believe the others don't have some form of identity or spirit in them.</br>  <br>It's reinforcement magic retard.</br>  <br>You can't also create Reality Marbles through the power of autism, but you don't see me complaining .</br>  <br>No where is it stated that Shirou is reinforcing himself, he has only been shown to reinforce objects.</br>  <br>Well you realy shouldn't read Nasu's stories in that case<br><br>You don't need autism to create a RM, just tons of research normaly</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou is the MC, it's natural to assume that he is going to end up being the strongest character in the story. Everything about how he is weak and that humans can't surpass servants is just to hype up the moment when it actually happens.</br>  <br>He does it in episode 1 when he sees Rin on the building.</br>  <br>Basic conjecture.<br> Shirou is shown to use reinforcement <br> Rin showcases that reinforcement can be used on yourself <br> Shirou can arguably use reinforcement on himself <br><br>He's still weak towards the ultimate secret technique.<br> The dropkick </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget about Reinforcement? You can use that on your body you know?</br>  Also, even if his arms do get broken Avalon will autoheal them anyway.  <br>But you need to be autistic enough to do this research.</br>  <br><br><br>Rin, mage pro can barely reinforce herself to such a level, hell I doubt even Kieri with all his command seals could reinforce himself to such a level back in F/Z. <br>It kinda makes sense but is still pretty BS.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shirou can arguably use reinforcement on himself <br>Shirou is good at reinforcing swords.<br>Shirou is a sword.<br>Thus Shirou is good at reinforcing Shirou</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the point is writing a story and beating the readers over the head about how a human could never match a servant only to then go and have a human beat servants?</br>  <br> Rin, mage pro can barely reinforce herself to such a level <br>Shirou is much better than her when it comes to reinforcements.</br></br>  <br>I don't think Avalon can regrow arms anon, with the speed of those weapons his arms should be completely blown off.</br>  <br>then who are Mimu, Mima, Mime, and Mimo?</br>  <br>Shirou is a sword and it's easier for him to reinforce blades/swords.</br>  <br>So you expect us to believe that Shirou can reinforce himself to like EX rank strength and defense? Since that's what's happening here.</br>  <br>Swords are pretty much the exception to everything regarding Shirou and since Shirou is a sword; he can pull some crazy things with his body.</br>  <br>If the original wielder of the swords he projects had those stats then yes, Shirou is able to do that.</br>  <br>what makes you think otherwise?</br>  <br>Citation needed<br><br>Shirou is running on Rin's mana during the fight with Gil</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't require anything near EX-ranked anything, he just needs to be durable enough to not get broken apart so he can keep fighting. The main advantage he has over Gil is that UBW can output a bit faster than GoB.</br>  <br>Did you miss the part where Shirou's arms are just short of falling off because his body can't handle the sword?<br>he can't reproduce the strength, the sword just moves on it's own</br></br>  <br>It's not Shirou, it's his swords that move with super speed, he's just there for the ride</br>  <br>This is what DPSfags believe.</br>  <br> Not Rin x Luvia end </br>  <br><br>Which side chapter is that</br></br>  <br>Tengen Toppa Guren Shirou</br>  So little Miyu has Faberge Eggs now?  <br>The head of the Clocktower is 2000 years old. Some of the Lords are similarly old as dirt. None of them have RMs. Shirou would automatically receive a Sealing Designation if he was found out because nobody in the Association has a Reality Marble. It's a unique achievement in the collective knowledge. Humans aren't supposed to get them full stop. They're the intrinsic ability of Primordial Demons. The only cases of others that have them are Dead Apostle Acnestors (and even the ones that do have extenuating circumstances) and Heroic Spirits, and the Heroic Spirits actually just get an NP that functions as one because of their legend rather than developing a true RM.</br>  <br> The head of the Clocktower is 2000 years old.

Ok.</br>  <br>Rowan had to effectively turn himself into the incarnation of chaos to get an RM. He's not the best example. Plus, him getting a Sealing Designation alone for having one removes the idea of it being a normal thing that can just be achieved. The whole point of it is "you've done something we can't do and we want to figure out how to do it".</br>  <br>Who said that nigga.</br>  <br>It can go on as long as the author needs. Next series would likely come with a setting shift, such as after the next big battle everything shifts back to Illya's world.</br>  <br>But they just killed the last boss.</br>  <br>Wat</br>  I got the file from a buddy who had mediocre Spanish subs.

It turns me on seeing a girl who supposedly loves another man destroy everything she has with him just to indulge in sexual pleasures with me. So it's not beta, anon, but more like the contrary. </br>  <br> Bitter young man who paints all people with the same brush so he doesn't have to bother to actually think <br><br>It's way better than growing attached to someone only for her to NTR you.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just called being a fucking cunt m8.</br>  <br>It's still beta, just with a desire to be alpha instead of conforming to betaness.</br>   retarded ugly butthurt beta emasculated lonely permavirgin pieces of shit still think that girls browse and shitpost in /a/ <br>What a surprise.</br>  <br><br>this<br><br><br>you should reconsider not being a beta cunt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>m8 the best bit about NTR is inserting as the cuck and imagining those feelings of inadequacy,shame but also arousal as your possession is taken away and simply used for pleasure.<br><br>NTR is the thinking man's fetish.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off tranny.</br>  <br>Imagining yourself NTRing someone else is more beta than being NTR'd.</br>  <br>Hey, people are fapping to rape and blackmail but I don't see them getting shit on. <br><br><br><br> beta cunt <br>Sure, I'm okay with being a cunt but a beta? Stop using words you don't know the meaning of, please. You're too fixated on the NTR keyword that you immediately resort to calling people buzz words like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if you NTR someone irl</br>  Time for a pleasant YZQ thread?

Awesome show, every girl is best girl, mc is not a fucktard.<br><br>Why didn't it do well or get a shitload of merch?</br></br>  <br>Because of everything you just said. There is literally no controversy. Nothing to shitpost or argue about.</br>  I really want to rewatch this series but my backlog keeps calling me.  <br>The Yasuda Curse. He's had one big success, of a sort. Make of it what you will.</br>  The anime was perfect. I've tried numerous times to read the manga or watch the old series, but it just doesn't have the same charisma.  Did the Dragon Slayer, Vampire Hunter or exorcist appear already in the manga? I've been waiting the rest of the elite 4 since necromancer and that was years ago.    <br>Touka is a slut.</br>  <br>Is it bad I want to know how that feels?</br>  <br>I'd love to be petted by Hime.</br>  <br>Is it bad I want to know how that feels?</br>  Why is Hime so perfect?
