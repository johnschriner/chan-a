It shows the chapter that each anime scene comes from, and it also points out some of the differences between the source and adaptation.  Why is Nee-nee so hopeless?<br> Why is she so perfect? </br>    <br>that face looks familiar</br>  <br>It's an accurate translation, though. People who don't know Japanese won't have a clue what "Nii-nii", in your image, means, and they'll probably think it's an actual name. <br><br>If you understand what is being said; why care subs? I will never understand the autism at play here. It's like you are annoyed they are translating things you already understand yet clearly don't understand enough to watch it raw. It's like a retard complaining about being treated like a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's one for episode 2 from season 1.</br>  <br>Her long hair is disproportionate to her head</br>  <br>kek</br>  So vol.7 is out, am I the only one who still reads this?

They do this a lot.</br>  <br>And that is all, only 9 pages for preview including the cover + blank spot. And they were in order.<br>Raws probably in a week/month/s</br></br>  <br>Although the pyro chick and the revenge girl from last volume were really cute   too bad everyone fucking dies  </br>  Are there not magazine raws?<br><br><br>I hope the shota stays ok.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think there is unless I'm blind and couldn't find it, but young champion isn't scanned that much at all.</br>  <br>  I hope the shota stays ok. <br><br>Rushia needs someone to bully<br><br><br>Also I guess he's Hell Mosquito's friend now</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would've picked this up a long time ago but those fucking scars are putting me off</br>  <br><br>Mine is cute.

I fapped to that scene. </br>  <br>  didn't we all  <br><br>this manga is a gold mine of those things</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The trash. world is dangerous to vagines<br><br>in the translated chapters we'll have<br><br>sticking a branch into a vagina (if we assume they did it before they killed the girl)<br><br>shooting a vagina with a slingshot<br><br><br>and in the next volumes we'll have<br><br>sticking a hook on a chain in a vagina and lifting the girl that way<br><br>sticking pipes into a vagina<br><br>  Mine's tongue in Rushia's vagina  <br><br>as well as the regular rapes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure there's more you missed.   and what the fuck is wrong with your post, are you drunk perhaps  </br>  <br>That's main duo's chief? She looks different</br>  <br>Yeah the artstyle changed somewhat</br>  So what does everyone think about this manga? I though it was some edgy shit at first but it's actually pretty decent if you give it time, only things i dislike about it is whenever a new villain is introduced, no matter how cool he is you just know he'll get fucked and die and 2 main characters will get out of it alive   I really want something bad to happen to them for some reason   and also a lot of random cute girl characters dying, whenever some waifu material appears she only lasts for a chapter or two before getting raped and hitting the bucket in the most gruesome way.  <br>Just remember they are already couple in the manga and had sex once</br>  <br>I don't think francesca understands those kinds of things, she just gave her a cunnilingus to cheer her up and they're just good friends.</br>  <br>  I though it was some edgy shit at first <br><br>I still think it's edgy, not so interestingly written.<br><br>I get similar feelings with series like Cynthia the mission, Needless, Chaos Rune, where I find myself rooting more for the antagonists.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it's not without substance at least.<br> where I find myself rooting more for the antagonists <br>trash. has got to have the most ridiculous excuse for making you like te characters I have ever seen<br>Francesca is just a brain dead brute with an axe who has passion for cute things and food and we don't even know much about her backstory and bullet had like a couple of pages where they showed that she was raped when she was younger and got fucked up and now she like to kill people for fun. Other that that they're literally sociopath psychos who murder people without second though and would torture a child to death for thrills and then go and hug a puppy or something. They have to be some of the most unlikable characters to exist and I always just want them to get fucked up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But they murder other psychos, so that's fine.</br>  <br>It's mediocre in content bt the art is good, and the writters don't shy away from anything, itt's definitely a sincere work. Fun-but-not-memorable/10</br>  The sex slave loli has potential for good moments.   loli takes her splattered organs and shoves back inside her body <br> stitches herself up <br> lives <br><br>My god this shit is fucking hilarious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nope she was dying after that. They took the father's organs and put them in her to make her survive.</br>  <br>nothing wrong there, humans are pretty resilient.</br>  <br>I meant to say that she lived through it but still.<br><br>Regardless though, the best part was when Gunslut almost gets raped but all the guys suddenly freaked the fuck out when they saw her gaping, used up, black hole of a pussy. Fantastic.</br></br></br>  "Edgy Shit" would be a more appropriate name, but I guess "Trash" is more stylish.  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  good job anon  Ayy.  <br>I don't know how you guys can even watch Funimation's, the video quality is truly hideous and the 3D scenes were for the most part "lagging".</br>    <br>and aside from the fanservice, what does this anime have to offer?</br>  <br>Did you see what they just did? For Akagami episode 3 they fucked up the ENTIRE episode by having the audio not be from the episode itself, but from the next episode which hasn't even aired yet. HOW can you fuck up that bad</br>  <br> Overlord <br> fanservice <br>Your definition of fanservice must be different from mine, because the first two episodes don't have any fanservice at all</br></br></br>  <br>KILL<br>I<br>L<br>L</br></br></br></br>  <br>WAIT, SERIOUSLY?<br>Did they just go beyond the impossible in fucking up shit? <br>How does that even happen? What the fucking hell?</br></br></br>  This is why we need to be able to delete our own threads still. <br><br>I make this mistake like once every 2 weeks. <br><br><br><br>I have little patience</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128348887 <br><br>I see your scrip failed you bateman.</br></br>  I applaud this series for its uniqueness in the first two episodes. The main characters appearance is a definite change of pace. Like a skeletor anime. But it'll have to bring something to the table soon. Starting to really slog at the end of the second episode there.  <br>There have been employees from Funi here before. They treat anime with disdain and the working environment is horrible</br>  So is this going to be an overlord thread or just waiting for the pruning?  <br>Gotta love Funi's fuck-ups.</br>  <br>Poop, possibly a few cool fights as the floor masters face off against whatever human enemies they end up facing later, I'm assuming, and assuming momonga doesn't just walk all over them.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, time to download the RAWs then.</br>  <br>literally every single screenshot I've seen of this show on 4chan has a sexual innuendo.</br>  <br>That's from Mikagura. <br>The Shirayuki hime fuck up was release episode 3 with episode 4's audio</br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>Sexual innuendos=/=fanservice<br>Also, there aren't that many innuendos.<br>What you see from some cherry picked screenshots proves nothing</br></br></br>  <br>And HorribleSubs encoded it without making sure everything was fine?</br>  <br> And HorribleSubs encoded it <br> smug anime face.jpg </br></br>  <br> HorribleSubs encoded it </br>  <br><br>I meant stole. I'm not that dumb.</br></br>  <br> HorribleSubs rips it manually </br>  <br>How would I know they're using a bot.. I mean yeah, it makes sense. Pls no bully.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, at least lurk before posting.<br>Fucking newfag, I swear.</br></br>  <br> How would I know they're using a bot <br>Because they have literally said multiple times that they use a bot to rip stream sites, newfag-kun.</br></br>  <br>I dunno Papa Bones is sexy as fuck.</br>  AINZ - SAMAAAA!!!<br>KISSU!<br>KISSU!!</br></br>  <br>Moe~</br>  So what are you fellas doing while waiting for your weekly dose? Currently going through 37 year old, ex-businessman slime tensei.  Is there any other manga or anime where the MC is an ruler or an overlord?  Tomorrow's the day  <br>I'd give Shalltear my Spuit Lance if you get what I mean.</br>  <br>Next episode the slaughter begins, and it keeps going up from there and end on a pretty high note.<br><br>If by some crazy stroke of luck we get a second season it will escalate even further.</br></br></br>  <br>Lizard sex animated on TV!

Five years from now.</br>   nothing to talk about till tomorrow   <br>Don't worry, if we keep studying Japanese I'm sure we can sort of read it in a few years.</br>  <br><br/></br>  If the anime means that we get more so-bin art, I'm all for it.  <br>Oh thats a new one. I like it.</br>  <br>How can anyone fuck up this much?</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl is passing by</br></br>  <br><br>I can't properly describe what my dick is feeling at this pic.</br></br>  <br><br>We can only hope some retard got fired, right?

If it is or not I never noticed it. <br><br><br>Yup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We should get him summoning the DK and blowing up people's hearts though.</br>  <br>Ainz always blowing up peoples heart.</br>  Threadly Reminder  <br> retard lovers <br>not even once</br></br>  <br>Who is last born and toilet? <br><br>Also what race is Yuri? Is she a dragon like Sebas since she's the only one who doesn't hate humans?</br></br></br>  <br>You could check the wiki.</br>  <br>Nobody really knows who they are yet. <br><br>Yuri is a Dulahan.</br></br></br>  <br>Lastborn is the immortal human lieutenant of the meidos who ranks above Yuri but below Sebastian. She hasn't been shown in the LNs yet.<br><br>Toilé(t) is  the whore Sebastian saves from Eight Fingers and the sister of Ninya <br><br>Yuri is a Dullahan.<br><br><br> retard meme <br>Pic related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> narberal being retarded is a meme <br>Narberalfags are as braindamaged as their waifu.</br></br>  <br>No bully pls</br>  <br>Reminder that Entoma literally means "bugs".</br>  <br>Narberal is cute precisely because she's so bullyable.<br><br>Her best moments are when she screws up and Ainz has to correct it.</br></br></br>  <br>Pls</br>  <br>I figured that's who toilet was, but just wanted to be sure.<br><br><br>What would one level in Dullahan even give you?<br><br>Also I though she was the head of the maids excluding Lastborn, but why is she like 12 levels lower than Narberal? That just seems weird to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't say<br><br><br>She's the one most fit to lead them when Sebas isn't around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the head of the Pleiades.</br>  <br> What would one level in Dullahan even give you? <br><br>Not being harmed by decapitation.</br></br></br>  <br>Solution is second best though</br>  <br>The main character aka protagonist is a fucking SKELETON! A spooky skeleton with a fucking armor! Isn't that enough for you tough boy? Eh?</br>  <br> Isn't that enough for you tough boy? Eh? </br>  <br>damn, I haven't seen this pic in a long ass tme lol</br>    <br> Fake tits </br>  <br>Mononga sama is great.</br>  <br>When does it even air? Threads have up since Saturday.</br>  <br>Tuesdays, with LN chapter translations on Saturdays.</br>  Prepare yourself for terrible CG.  <br>Best girl is not even a girl</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's doppelgänger.</br></br>  <br>Can't be worse than anything we've seen so far. Looked a bit awkward but okay in the preview.</br>  <br> implying </br>  Longest 7 days ever.  I don't understand why there's an argument over who the best made is. Yuri was made by Papa Bones, who's simply the best. His direct children should always rank above his adopted ones.  <br> Yuri was made by Papa Bones <br>We don't actually know that yet. It's not been said in the Tld chapters so far.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that's a broken translation, Naberal is a shapeshifter while PA is a doppelganger. PA looks like how doppels normally look like, naberals "natural" form is half man half woman mostly monsterous looking.</br>  <br> Implying there are people who don't rate PA the best guardian. <br><br>Like a lot of families with adopted kids, Ainz tends to treat his surrogate kids way better than his direct kid.</br></br></br>  <br>They're both doppelgangers, not a broken translation m8.<br>Plus in the web novel Narberal actually shows her true form which is exactly like Pandora's actor, a face with holes for the eyes and the mouth.</br></br>  drop after 15th minute ep.1... is worth or what?  <br>No.</br>  <br>What the actual fuck is going on here?</br>  <br>Mare gettin shit done</br>  <br>Just because he treats PA like crap, doesn't mean PA still isn't the best. Same goes for Yuri. I thought her being his creation was one of the earliest spoilers we got in these threads.</br>   My order of volume 3 and 4 will arrive today <br><br>Yiss</br></br>  <br>Again, that's never been proven.</br>  <br>While it's heavily implied that all guild members had a hand in making the maids, we still don't know who made what.</br>  Just why is PA rated so highly anyway? Is it because unlike the other guardians, he verifies Momonga's orders before he does them?  <br>Is that the translated one? I thought someone said it was translated in their country to something but I can't remember what.</br>  <br>More like it's because he's a goofball nazi.</br>  <br>PA's ability to mimic up to 45 other builds at 80% power gives makes him a very tough opponent apparently.</br>  <br> Yes </br>  <br>Mare was practicing after receiving Demiurge's private lesson.<br><br> “In addition, regarding the plan to strengthen Nazarick, I am also very interested. I want to know how far our kids can go. How about it Mare, you want to have children?” <br><br> “Uh? Huh?” <br><br> “However, that is impossible without a partner… If you find any humans, dark elves or wood elves, could you please capture them?” <br><br> “Eh? Ehhh?” Mare briefly nodded: “I-, if this helps Momonga-sama…. Then I will do it. But how are children born?” <br><br> “Well, when it comes to that time I will teach you. If you decide to experiment on your own, Momonga-sama will probably scold you. Due to maintaining the Great Tomb of Nazarick’s operating cost, it should be better if we try to maintain the balance first.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Apparently <br><br>You really think that level of versatility doesn't make him high tier?</br></br></br>  <br> Elf rapist <br> No elf being raped <br>Why</br></br></br>  <br>There were guys in the guild that were broken, like Touch me. 80% of fucking invincible is still a lot.</br>  how long has momonga been in charge anyways? that blob guy from the first episode said he last saw him like 2-ish years ago right? and it sounded like he was surprised momonga was in charge now and that's why the guild is still around.  <br>This dialogue will be animated?</br>  <br>It's not like he can take on more than one form at a time and wouldn't there be a lag between forms. Also that 20% from top form is pretty significant. I don't know if just having a counter build is enough to bridge that.</br>  <br>It was skipped.</br>  <br>No, it got skipped. It was during episode 2.</br>  <br>For a very long time. He wasn't surprised that Momonga was in charge NOW, but that he was STILL around and covering the Guild's maintenance fees because almost everyone else had already quit.</br>  What's the current pace of the anime (1 LN = X episodes)?<br><br>Are the LNs worth reading?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much 4 episodes per volume. And yes.</br>  <br>It's only an issue if he was facing someone who had the stats that could match one of those forms at 100%. 80% of a God's stats could still wreck 100% of an ant's stats.</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;No elf being raped <br> implying <br>Demiurge want Mare to capture elves too (). I wouldn't be surprised if that guy has already prepared a rape dungeon filled with Orc.</br></br></br>  <br>Patience is great, but just like SAO and Log Horizon it's clear that this show will wear out its welcome after a season, and there's no chance it'll get more than two seasons. So, there's a limited time in which events can happen.</br>  <br>What  said but be advised that the translation quality of like half of the first volume is pretty poor. It gets better though.</br>  DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION  <br>I thought you meant against other equals, then the advantages are situational. <br>Just about anyone in that world is pretty puny.</br></br>  <br> But how are children born? </br>  <br> <br>The woman is a noble who lead a criminal group<br>Said group pissed MC off by kidnapping Sebas' waifu<br>He sent Mare and Entoma out<br>They go to her house.<br>Entoma eats the guards.<br>Noble chick tries to launch a sneak attack on him, sending out magic snakes.<br>Mare grabs those snakes and crushes them in his hands.<br>He then proceeds to twist her foot, causing the bones to protrude from the muscle.<br>Then he grabs her hair and drags her along, telling her to move faster.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Good alignment my ass, that kid's fucking creepy I swear, just look at his face.</br></br></br>  <br>Even against most other level 100s Pandora's Actor would still have an overwhelming advantage from having copied Touch Me (World Champion) and Ulbert (World Magic Champion).</br>  <br>Mare is actually kidnapping a girl to fuck her then? Interesting frown there.</br>  <br>It's neutral good, not good.</br>  It's ok to be Mare sexual right?  <br>Otoko.</br>  <br>Good does not mean nice</br>  <br><br>I'm sure his versatility and ability to transform into two world champions is extremely powerful, but he lacks in the knowledge and items for proper use for those builds. Also, Albedo only considers him to be on the same level as herself and Demiurge. Of course it's possible she just never considered him turning into world champions, but her assessment is probably accurate.</br></br>  <br>He's Neutral Evil. Neutral Good is Shizu and good is Yuri or Sebas.</br>  <br>Mare's actually evil though.</br>  <br>Why would punishing some uppity animals affect his alignment?</br>  <br>Why Mare and Entoma? Knowing Ainz, he must have thought really hard about it before he chose them.</br>  <br>Well it's not like he can send most of his guardians<br><br>Cocytus is a giant lizard monster<br>Albedo would probably murder everyone in a fit of yandere rage<br>Shalltear obviously cant be trusted to take hostages<br>Victim is pretty easy to kill<br>Gargantua is a xbox hueg golem<br>Demiurge and Sebastian were busy with their own stuff</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cocytus <br> lizard monster </br></br>  <br>Why not send meidos?</br>  <br>*bug-lizard monster</br>  <br>He's an Ant Mantis.</br>   Sharknado is a real spell and we will see it animated <br><br>Thank you based Momonga</br></br>  <br> Meidos were sent to help Demiurge. </br>  <br>Characters act according to their alignment. Their behavior doesn't change it.</br>  <br>Looks more like some amalgamation of large beetles, like stag/hercules beetles.<br><br>Immediately thought of this guy when I first saw him</br></br></br>  <br>Is this what pokemon has become</br>  <br>I fucking wish</br>  <br>So he's a mANTis?</br>  <br> Yes. </br>  <br>Entoma IS a meido...</br>  <br>How much was it? Shipping cost? <br><br> So Bin artbook when? </br></br></br>  <br> What would one level in Dullahan even give you? <br><br>The ability to give good head.</br></br></br>  <br>Clackity clack clack.</br>    <br>If I recall, he sent almost everyone that could be disguised as a human.  The whole event only got out of hand once Blue Rose intercepted Entoma. Both were after the Eight Fingers, but the goody two-shoes Blue Rose adventurers wouldn't let Entoma go once they met her, because she was eating people in front of them, even if those people were guards of Eight Fingers. Entoma even asked if they would ignore her, but the muscle thing/woman wouldn't let her go. </br>  I've been reading the LN, and mostly it's "We don't know fuck all, so we need to investigate." When they finally do, they discover the MC and his minions are hilariously overpowered compared to everybody else.<br><br>It gets interesting when  one of his own minions gets mind controlled , though, because he actually has to form a plan. Judging from the OP of the show, that battle will probably be the finale.</br></br>  <br>I'm still pissed that their leader  managed to resurrect the two that Demiurge killed. What good id resurrection magic if everyone and their grandmother can use it? </br>  <br>Feel  kinda bad  Gagaran  is probably going to be brutally wasted.  <br>I hate her character design, but I admit it fits with her personally rather than the "beautiful butch musclegirl with the 10/10 face" and she's bro-tier as hell going by the last chapter.<br><br> But god I hate Climb. Even though I want to like him. But I hate him. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Have we ever seen Ainz hold any writing instruments? My mind is boggling on how the hell he holds a pencil or brush with those slenderman skeleton fingers.</br>  <br>Who doesn't hate Climb? Fucking Climb, man.</br>  <br>with those points all Ainz needs is an Inkwell</br>  <br>Well, I don't really care for him but I don't particularly hate him either. I'm just waiting for the day he discovers what his precious princess thinks of him and humans in general.He'll wish he were dead.</br>  <br> lolis never EVER get any kind of sex in any anime, ever <br> any time a shota is introduced, he ALWAYS fucks someone <br>Fucking double standards holy shit, so frustrating.</br></br></br>  <br>I only see a chair</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>It's only everyone we meet because they have the resources to do so.<br>It's costly as hell to resurrect people, since the New World plays by D&amp;D rules. And that sort of magic is costly as hell for anybody not a wandering murderhobo-cum-adventurer-thief. Like, literal lifetimes of commoner money, if not the effort to find people who can actually do it.<br><br>As well,  it only works on "strong" people anyways, since you seem to lose levels on respawn with that sort of magic. Anyone too low in "level" can't be brought back, as Khajit implied about his mother. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You see anon<br><br> something something boys always want sex says men who have messed up views of sex </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, that's hilarious. And a good point. I've always wanted to just be able to finger write without having to literally write it out with a stick that made it not look smudgy and shitty.</br>  <br> Plus the person has to want to come back, though I wonder who'd not want to come back if they could. How many levels did the Blue Rose people lose? </br>   Ainz says dark elf twins are too young to know about sex <br> when they're 70+ years old <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>I WANT to like him. He just tries so hard, the poor bastard. He is the stuff that real heroes are made of, what with his obviously pure as grace heart.<br><br>But he just eats up so much story with his goddamn sob story and STOIC LOYALTY. At least Gazef was fighting an uphill battle physically and politically with a modicum of personality.<br><br> though I am preaching to the (dark) choir of Nazarick, I assume </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To him, they're less than ten years old, since they were "born" when Bukubuku Chagama(?) created them.<br><br>As well, that's how they were created. 70-year old virgins. Because of roughly-made NPC blurbs that did nothing for Yggdrasil's gameplay other than making PCs feel awesome about their OCs in their virtual circlejerk palaces (read: guilds).</br></br></br>  <br>Ganbatte, toilet-san</br>  <br>If Khajit somehow got his wish, I would assume the irony would be that his mother would reject him trying to call her back to the earthly world. <br><br> I mean, he'd kill thousands, if not millions, to get enough negative/death energy to become a lich, THEN kill more to research his perfect resurrection spell for her. What mother wouldn't be appalled she was even tangentially related to that sort of slaughter? </br></br></br>  <br>We don't know. All we know is from dubious rumors by Chinafags and people who read moon off of the (admittedly quite different, especially for later volumes) web novel.<br>All we know is who gets rekd, details are lost (if they're even true at all). And once they get published in the re-written LNs as opposed to the WN volumes, who knows where the story will head?</br></br>  Can Ainz-sama bring back Ed's mom?  <br>Bait response aside, he could. She'd come back as a shambling mess of organs, bones, and necrotic goo screaming in mindless agony and rage, but yeah, he could. <br>I mean, it's not much different from what Ed/Al did.</br></br>  <br>Ed/Al might have had a bit bigger success if, you know, those weren't revealed to be a different woman's bones.</br>  <br> making PCs feel awesome about their OCs in their virtual circlejerk palaces (read: guilds). <br>You just have to know that probably a lot of guilds were Magical Realm as all get-out. If future /a/ played Yggdrasil and remade Touch the Fluffy Tail or whatever TERA guild there was, it would be a den of sluts and terrible and disgusting fetish blurbs on every R-15 (due to game age restrictions, not that a dedicated modder wouldn't get around that) sex puppet there.</br></br>  <br>Eh, disgusting flesh horror made from a summoning built off of true familial love gone wrong, gory lost limbs off some innocent-but-well-meaning kids, same difference to Ainz. <br>He'd just take a look at it, take notes, then let Demiurge play the remnants.</br></br>  <br><br>I used to lurk the tera generals, and I can confirm those fags were such sluts it was unbearable. But then again any /a/ guild would probably be the same if some game like Yggdrasil ever pops up.</br></br>  <br> or whatever TERA guild there was, it would be a den of sluts <br>Should have joined Pettan.</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't Ainz be able to effortlessly bring hdr back too life? Death is a minor hurdle at his level.</br>  <br><br>Well considering it requires the sacrifice of lvl experience, she'd probably be too low to be resurrected.</br></br>  <br>it's not his level that matters as the person that's brought back is the one that looses levels.</br>  <br>By name alone, I can tell that guild was probably sluts pretending they weren't sluts.</br>  <br>He probably could, even without level-loss. He has an assload of rare items, many of them not even Pay items that could probably do perfect resurrections without level loss. Magic too, even.<br>But why would he spend the effort (or more importantly, items) to do so?</br></br>  <br>They spent all their time hanging out in the arena. Nothing happened in their entire lives except getting killed by at least one raid group.</br>  <br>He might be interested In having alchemists who he can learn about a new form of magic from. I can't see Ed/Al being of use for anything else except Demiurge experiments. Of course he could just grant himself the ability to use it with his wish item.</br>  What time tomorrow's the livestreaming? I always get confused. 10:30 or 11?  <br>Ainz has enough resources and competent minions to do pretty much anything he sets his mind too, in the New World. <br><br>The issue is that he generally lacks motivation and is too cautious to ambitiously experiment. His primary concern is to protect Nazarick and his children. Most of the activities he undergoes are incited by the Guardians. He would rather just stay in the background, looking for his former guild mates and having adventures.</br></br></br>  I hope to God that the next part of the LN isn't more Climb.  Finally finished reading Vol4.<br>Fuck that was long.<br><br>Vol5 chpt3 translations when?</br></br></br>  <br>Saturday.</br>  <br>but chpt2 came out 2 Sats ago ;_;</br>  <br>The LN translation seems to be on weekly basis.<br><br>Crazy, right?</br></br></br>  <br>The fuck you talking about? Chp 2 came out 2 days ago.</br>  <br>What kind of time loop are you in?</br>  <br><br>well fuck me then, time for bed.</br></br>  Man looking at the illustrations for volume 7, I feel really, really sorry for the Workers. Poor saps took the worst job possible.  <br>Is that you undead flash? Please tell me about episode 4.</br>    <br>Surprise.  More Climb. You get to see Sebas teach him how to be a man (or die in the process.) </br>  <br>Oh god please no.<br><br>Somebody save me from this fresh hell.</br></br></br>  wait a minute. If she is dead, how can she still produce body fluids.<br><br>who programmed this shit.</br></br>  manga update when?<br>i need that hugging scene illustrated</br>  <br>Her creator designed her that way. It's why they all worship the 41 Supreme Beings.</br>  3/5    <br>What?</br>  <br>She does show off her natural fingers at some point in the published novels, I'll be fucked if I can remember where though.</br>  <br>He has access to all of their gear, papa Bones stuck all of his friends armor onto statues or threw them into storage.</br>  <br>It triggers my autism knowing there will always be a gap in his collection from the last 3 that left without deleting the characters and giving him their gear.</br>  So how much do the NPCs remember about the Players or Supreme Beings? Its clear they know they were created by them but do they remember the game as it was their reality or just the background they were given?  <br>right after fighting khajit/clementine saving alchy shota in the tomb. The Virtuous King of The Forest asks about it. I'm wondering if they are going to bring up the sentient item they gave to the King. Probably not for another 10 volumes.<br><br>Probably because they are in the game world somewhere. Papa has 11 world class items anyways so its not like he needs more crazy shit to fuck around with.<br><br>They understand their settings but the characters seem to take after their creators in the gaps. They act as if they were always sentient.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They act as if they were always sentient. <br><br>That just makes me imagine all the terrible shit that could've happened if a pervert played this game<br><br>Imagine some pervert making his NPC follower into a scantily clad waifu and then forcing her to take on humiliating poses using the menu or giving her a cringeworthy backstory a la "She loves me and is a nympho who needs cock at least three times a day bla bla bla"<br><br>Then you accidentally go to the new world and your NPC waifu who was accustomed to doing the "bend over" pose and "sexy dancing" emote is real and remembers every single thing you've done together, even the times you ran into her character model repeatedly and pretended it was sex.<br><br>Man, I'm glad for Ainz but I would have fucked this opportunity up so badly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but I would have fucked this opportunity up so badly <br>Oh anon.</br></br>  So did anybody else hear him at the end of episode 2? It was the last thing I was expecting.  <br>If you think that's bad, just imagine what /tg/ and /d/ would get up to as part of an evil guild.</br>  reading time  <br>Woot! Reading! Literature!</br>  <br>Chinese or Korean?</br>  <br> actual literal cherry picking <br><br>Sasuga disinformators.</br></br></br>  <br>Albedo, stop being so perfect please. I am trying to work, not to produce instant, infinite boners.</br>  <br> Dullahan <br> head maid <br> head <br><br>bonelaugh.gif</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget he gets to copy secret weapon Rubedo and he can do lame shit like go Ainz -&gt; Eclipse CD -&gt; transform into someone else and not be fucked over by Ainz's shitty build. Unless 80% of kill everything period means only kill it by 80% and leave 20% alive, which is still pretty damn good for just one attack.</br>  <br>Isn't he just 80% of the original's level when transformed? That would make him too low to use eclipse when mimicking Ainz</br>  <br>The one that turned into clothes?</br>  <br>It's 80% stats, not 80% of the level.</br>  <br>Is this Vol 7 or Vol 5? I'm gonna guess the 11k words is total and not per page.</br>  <br>You know what's funny. Khajit and Zuranon have to sacrifice thousands of lives to achieve lichdom. Ainz just needs a book, that he probably hoards by the hundreds.</br>  <br>But that's just how it is. Players are different than New World denizens. Compare 13 heroes leader who was a player to Climb. It's not even remotely fair.</br>  <br>I can't wait for Ainz to show Zuranon just who is the true master of the undead.</br>  <br><br>What is this!?<br><br>He's just bones....</br></br></br></br>  <br>believe it or not but skeletons are usually just bones</br>  <br>So is the human body. Oh wait.</br>  <br>A book?<br><br>I thought all he needed was the character creation screen.</br></br></br>  Next episode in 7 hours. And then it will be another 7 days until we can see Papa Bones animated again.  <br>I still wonder where we're going to stop at this episode.</br>  Hey does anyone have the image of the world map? I swear there was one, but I don't remember which volume or chapter it was, or if it was only in the manga.  <br>I say virtuous king.<br>If it happens I'm buying a hamster.</br></br>  <br>Right before the confrontation or a quarter into it.</br>  <br><br>Introduction of Strogonoff, before the battle with the Angels start.</br></br>  <br>that's a stupid move though. the Eclipse CD augments Insta-death spells which are the main reason that Ainz RP build sucks(in the game there was lots of anti-instant death resistances and Rez at high levels), so PA is better of copying Touch me or that PVP wizard</br>   In that room, a white lizardman was being pressed down with its tail lifted up. A black lizardman was riding on top.<br><br><br>Baffling.<br><br><br>Ainz didn’t understand what was going on in the very beginning. The next instant, that changed to confusion as to why they are doing that thing at a time like this.<br><br><br>Ainz then moved the sensory organ outside silently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>T-Too lewd</br></br>  <br>angel battle won't last part A anon haven't you watched enough animus?</br>  <br>I just started the lizardmen chapter. I had no idea you could make lizardmen so boring.<br>At least Shalltear drowning herself in drink that shouldn't even effect her was hilarious.<br>I hope they put Eck in the anime. A penguin plotting to usurp Ainz is hilarious.</br></br></br>  Where I can read the LN? <br>I just found about this anime and it was great</br>  <br>It was from Volume 9, but we only have a shitty camera picture since there are no scans yet.</br>  <br>really?</br>  <br>It's a race change item, it's mentioned in Volume 4.<br> One of the conditions was a specific item. For example, you would need the ‘Book of the Dead’ to be a lich. To turn into an imp required ‘Fallen Seeds’. And the ‘Heaven’s Feather’ that Ainz mentioned was a required item to become an angel. </br></br>    <br> shadbase </br>  <br>Ah but that's the kicker, the Eclipse CD is the only worthwhile move in Ainz's build, and it's honestly not that shit just easily countered.<br><br>Besides, it's not like there's any known counter to rez items as far as we know. Ainz himself has a ring that gives him 3 self rezes in a row without losing exp. Being able to instantly take down 1 of them then transforming into Touch Me/Ulbert/Rubedo is very useful.</br></br></br>  <br>But Ainz started the game as a skeleton, he doesn't need any items to change.</br>  <br>I laughed.</br>  <br>He was just a weak skelly in a tattered robe, he could've taken up a curved sword and maybe be one of those spooky pirates. He probably needed the book to be magical spook lord.</br>    <br>http://skythewood.blogspot.sg/2015/<wbr>05/O42.html<br>start from vol 2 at the very least</br></wbr></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br><br>Cool, thanks based anons<br><br> start from vol 2 at the very least <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You will understand as you read.</br>  <br>Spookman is still a alright mage, his insta-gib stuff does debuffs if it doesn't kill and he still has some bread-and-butter things to be good enough at just straight up killing things when he's not being busy playing support-bot.</br>  <br>Just ignore him, start from the very beginning prologue. The minor details that the anime and manga discarded are nice</br>  <br> You will understand as you read. <br>But did I will lose any detail/info if I didn't read vol1 or it was bad translated?<br><br><br>Ok, thanks again</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess the book is needed to class up from a spooky skele mage to a lich. What else could he have become other than a lich?</br>  <br>It's probably in one of the D&amp;D 3.x books seeing as a good chunk of stuff in the novels is lifted from there.</br>  <br>A wheel skeleton, I guess.<br>At worst, he becomes Ghost Rider.</br></br>  <br>Death knight?</br>  <br> At worst, he becomes Ghost Rider. <br>Top kek</br></br>  <br> Papa Bones as a level 100 wheel skeleton <br><br>The mental image is simultaneously hilarious and horrific.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The only proper answer is to become a bone wyrm instead.</br></br>  <br>It's only worthwhile when compared to the enemies he faced in YGGDRASIL and other undead, but when up against pretty much any other opponent, Ainz is loaded with all kinds of incredible moves, such as all his summon abilities.</br>  A lich's soul is attached to his phylactery right? What item would that be for Papa Bone?  <br>To become a lich in 3.x you pretty much just have to create a phylactery; that requires a caster level of 11, Create Wondrous Item, 120,000 GP and 4800XP.</br>  What would the guardians do if Ainz announced that he would go adventuring alone?  <br>Reluctantly agree while praising the unknown plan Ainz has concocted that their feeble minds could never fathom. They would soon become stalkers of the highest order.</br>  <br>I do know that the orb in his chest is a world item so that can't be it.</br>  <br>Do liches even have independent phylacteries in this setting? We know that Ainz can be resurrected normally and the lich that was destroyed by the lizardmen would have automatically resurrected if it had a phylactery, but it simply died along with its body.</br>  <br>How does one turn himself into a bone wyrm?</br>  <br>They would put up a fight and pester him endlessly to try and send at least one maid to accompany him. If he still refused, they would have someone skilled enough follow him and keep tabs on him</br>  <br> stalkers of the highest order. <br>Pretty much this.</br></br>  <br><br>Dracolich it up.<br>Or just do what I did and  reform a collection of ground up bone dust from various species, preferably those with high magic affinity, into the inexplicable visage of a dragon's skeleton. During the bone creation process, you fuse pieces of your soul into the various parts of the skeleton and then assemble them together into the aforementioned dragon shape. <br><br>You have to then to find a way to keep the form together, there are numerous ways to do this but I prefer simply empowering the bones and possessing them en masse hence why I embedded my soul into them. Some have resorted to simply practicing bonemancy or utilizing a single gemstone acting as the heart to keep the whole thing together. If you did things right, you should be able to leave your mortal body and become a spooky skelly dragon.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>What's the source on that? I know he has a WC item cause the guild said it was okay but I didn't read anywhere that it was the orb.</br>  <br>So you used the bones as an unconventional phylactery instead? Neat.<br> also /tg/ pls </br></br>  <br>Stalking is highly possible. So is suicide.<br> “Ai- Ainz-sama, please agree to me, promise to me that you will never abandon us and leave this place!”  <br> “......I apologise, however……” <br> After ‘however’ , Ainz did not continue speaking. He had a particular reason for it, but Albedo assumed that his silence was due to something else. <br> “Why! Why can you not make that promise? Did you have thoughts about abandoning us already? Why! Is there something which makes you unhappy? If you would just explain, I will immediately remedy it! If you think of me as a hindrance, I shall immediately take my own life!” </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More or less he's an umber hulk</br>  <br>Isn't that what the skeletal dragons from Volume 2 are, barring the intelligence?</br>  <br><br>I'm tempted to do this but I'll just have to put it on my bucketlist. Gotta fucking find a way to to become a little girl mimic first.</br></br>  <br>but that's my point, the Eclipse CD is useless on a standard build that doesn't focus on instant death, so there's no point for PA to copy it unless he's going to fight as Ainz</br>  <br>Then what?</br>  Will we ever see Sebas' other eye in the anime?  <br>Undead turning lich don't have phylacteries. That's for mortals going lich.</br>  <br><br>You're a god damn skeleton dragon. What else do you want to do? Jerk off?</br></br>  <br>Receive a tier-7 lightning spell to the face and crumble.</br>  <br> Probably because they are in the game world somewhere. <br><br>Nah, they were the ones that hadn't left the game, but hadn't logged in the past 1-2 years. <br><br>All of them reconnect the last day to say farewell to the game and to the Guild. Ainz comments that in the first chapter. <br><br>So, since they logged out that very same day, I doubt they were anywhere in the game world or in the new world. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Also, he knows everything about the gear that is stored in his vault. It's not like he wouldn't be able to use the builds and equipment with a high degree of skill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thri-kreen would have been the ideal DnD base for Cocytus.</br>  <br>I don't know. Get stronger?</br>  So is this entire show just about characters wanting to suck MC's dick?  <br>yes</br>  <br><br>Go fuck off and assimilate better bones or ores into your frame, refine the enchantments and bindings, and go find a dragon rider crazy enough to join you on your journey.</br></br>  <br>no mosty its start with hugging and getting stressed by his minions who keeps ovwethinkinf his orders</br>  Please tell me there's gonna be more lewd Albedo.  <br><br>Albedo is not lewd, she's just MADLY in love with Ainz.<br><br> There's a scene where she's naked in Ain's bed, but she's covered by the sheets. </br></br></br></br>  <br> ovwethinkinf <br><br>I can imagine how this happened, but I'm laughing</br></br></br>  <br><br>Minor stroke.</br></br>  <br>Best kind of good.<br><br>That and Good is Not Soft.</br></br></br>  <br>How about a skelly chariot?</br>  <br>sauce of this?</br>  <br>http://killsixbilliondemons.com/</br>  <br>wow I've heard Funi was shit but this is just..</br>  <br>Cool<br>Thanks</br></br>  <br>Sounds highly unlikely considering he carries a valuable item to revive himself three times in a row.</br>  Is skythewood the only translator or are there any who are faster than him and don't take the longer route by translating the chinese version?  <br>So the pdfs I had downloaded were versions 4/3, but now they got updated or something to version 5? What's different?</br>  Can skeletor even have sex?  <br>He can please albedo with whatever long bone fits her best.</br>  <br>Silian -&gt; Slane, Re-Lantier/Valencia -&gt; E-Rantel/Ro-Lente, formatting (intends and some paragraphing), some other terms that got more coherent during 4th vol that I might have missed.<br><br>So unless you're going to re-read, no need to grab them.</br></br></br>  <br> formatting (intends and some paragraphing) <br><br>Ah yes, I just noticed that. I think that I'm just going to reread the whole thing, the new format is very comfortable and clear to read.</br></br></br>  Is the light novel any good? Just marathoned another novel but that wore me out, if its good tho I'll go through this too  <br>If you're worn out I recommend reading it when you're revitalized. The beginning is quite descriptive and doesn't get into action till a few chapters later.</br>  <br>It is pretty good but not fully translated, no need to rush into it.</br>  <br>Sky only translated actively up to vol 2. He's credited as one of the editors now and lends the site as the dropoff point for chapters so updates are all in one place.</br>   The ammount of baneposting after ep 3 <br>Oooooh man</br>  <br>Nah, it won't be this bad...will it?</br>  <br>We can always get started a little bit early, anon</br>  <br>Tell me about Ainz. Why does he wear the mask?</br>  <br>Just embrace it, let it pass, and wait for the Friday speculah/Saturday chapter release threads.</br>  <br>Explain</br>  <br>Read the fucken LN.</br>  <br>You can almost copypaste entire conversation</br>  <br>Reading's for losers, grandpa!</br>  <br>Ainz puts on a mask and goes and wrecks some people's shit</br>  <br>But  why  does he put on the mask</br>  <br>You too would be kinda freaked out to see a walking and talking skeletor.<br><br>That's why he wears it.</br></br></br>  <br>To protect his virginity.</br>  <br>To pretend he's controlling dark knight</br>  <br>the only funny comic he made</br>    “Now it’s my turn to ─── kill everyone.”   <br> because the first two episodes don't have any fanservice at all <br>breast-groping</br></br>  <br>That wasn't fanservice, that was a necessary experiment.</br>  <br>Albedo pls</br>    starting fags  <br>What scene did it end then?</br>  <br>nvm, they ended it where I expected, on Gazef's arrival and the scout informing them about Nigan.</br>  Reminder that even Mibonga thing that Narberal is useless  <br>It's M'bonga</br>  <br>Da spooky voodoo</br>  <br>Probably the same as the manga.</br>  Fuck I totally forgot that today is the day.  <br>just fyi its laurentin that was changed to Ro-Lente</br>  <br>Yeah, memory plays tricks on that one.</br>  So what is ainz planning on doing with all those lizardman? And is this before or after Ainz  knocked 5 levels off by resurrecting him?   <br>Train them as shock troops and "squad commanders", each lizardman carrying his dead relatives as his squad.</br>  <br>He's not the hero we deserve, but the one we need right now.</br>  <br>Congratulations, you saved the village. What's the next step of your master plan?</br>  It's out.  <br>Indeed, both 1080 and 720.</br>  <br>Crushing this army. WITH NO SURVIVOR!</br>  <br><br>I can't fucking wait for volume 9.</br></br>  <br>Man, I want to see they religion they build around ainz and cocytus. They probably worship that one rock he sat on too</br>  <br> and this is the supreme ones rock young ones, remember to prostrate before for 10 minutes after each meal </br>  Well Papa Bones is huge as fuck. And DK even bigger hah.  Where's the Japanese live thread for ep3?  <br>Papa Bones is 2,5 meters tall going by vol 4.</br>  <br>Yeah, I always tried to compare him bit shy under 2m near Sebas/Demi but damn.</br>  <br><br>You see Dio. You merely adopted the spooky. I was born of it.</br></br>  <br>Damn he's a big guy.</br>   no Shalltear this episode <br>How is this allowed</br>  Fucking paladins.  <br>Mere chair doesn't need screen time.</br>  <br>She has a whole mini arc dedicated to her so be patient.</br>  <br>Bit different that what I imagined but damn, it makes sense. Fucking paladins. Even if he only acts for demi/heteromorphs.</br>  <br>Touch Me was a touch chuuni himself, considering his age and his circumstances in real life.</br>  <br>She has a whole fucking volume to herself.</br>  No censor Great job Madhouse  <br>thanks for the kancolle</br>  was it necessary to stab the poor knight many many times?   gazef is going to die <br><br>REEEEEEEEEE</br></br>  <br>They might still censor the brain splatters and intestines though, but I can take that as necessary victim, as long as the rest of dismembering/decapitation get through.</br>  <br>You don't ask the crazy, undead zombie knight questions that could make it even angrier.</br>  Anyone made stitches for this episode?  Can wait for Papa Bones lovely hugs.  So the ones surrounding the village now are the "trap" that the knight guy talked about at the start?  <br><br>Ahh! Yesss! I was wonder what would break first? Your spirit or your body!</br></br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>You mean it wasn't necessary?</br>  <br> streaming </br>  Oh dear, what a pinch.  <br>Didn't the guy stab the the girl's father many times in the LN? Seems like karma for that.</br>  Does Ainz have any NPC's he made himself? Or are they all other players npcs  <br>Pandora's Actor and Yuri Alpha.</br>  <br>Yesssssssss. That asshole clearly deserved to be stabbed so often with how it he was begging and pleading or people to die for him.<br><br>Next episode is going to be glorious.</br></br></br>  <br>He made Pandora's Actor and some hints on that he assisted on others (like Yuri since he is always referring to Yorumaiko with his p2w addiction) but his truly own creation is PA so far.</br>  <br>It looks like she's shoving her exposed boob into her sister's face...</br>  jeeesus christ whys gazef so fucking based!  <br><br>he only lost one level im pretty sure.</br></br>  <br> Ainz is a Nazi memorabilia collector </br>  <br> Ainz <br> A i n z <br> N a z i <br> Nazi <br><br>Aaaaaaaah!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best girl. </br>   says his name <br> villager asks who he is 15s later <br>please</br></br>  <br>Why are you retarded?</br>  <br>Pic related.</br>  why is LN Aura so sexy?  <br>how does the resurrecting process work? I thought that those being resurrected would lose levels or because Yggdrasil is a sadist's mmo does the person resurrecting lose the levels or both?</br>  <br>doujins when</br>  <br> Not Albedo. </br>  <br>The target loses levels, default is 5 but Ainz hinted that there were ways to mitigate the loss in-game and it seems like Primal Magic/Ritual Rezz in New World are the same advanced kinds that mitigate the loss.<br><br>The Silian priests at 3rd tier or higher could rezz peasants but as Kajit hinted, her mother's vitality (level) was too low and she would have ceased to be since she couldn't take the cost.<br><br>And like with Shalltear, she was the target of npc resurrection which doesn't cost levels, just huge amounts of dosh.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really hope he speaks in a german accent similar to the major from hellsing.</br>  <br>Holy crap all their faces are so sensual.</br>  <br>I'm really digging the pace.<br><br>Nice and comfy.</br></br></br>  <br> huge amounts of dosh <br>so will papa bones be grinding for more cash now to make up for her shortcomings?</br></br>  <br>Chances are that they still have billions of gold left.</br>  reminder to watch out for daiz and entourage of memers  Someone put it out of its misery already    <br>absolutely disgusting<br><br>thank you anon</br></br></br>  <br>Why is the coke yellow?</br>  <br>Wow. Look at those little guys go.</br>  <br>Why do you think</br>  Would you cum inside a clock?  <br>She might get pregnant if I do that.</br>  Well, you know the saying<br><br>"Never stick your dick in crazy"</br></br>  <br>Good taste</br>  <br>This is especially true in Clock's case because you're effectively sticking your dick inside an infinite number of crazies all at the same time.</br>  <br>Jesus anon, are you playing on a toaster?</br>  <br>Kurumi is the only exception to that.</br>  <br>Inside er mouth or ass yes.<br><br>Inside her always use a condom m8, my not-so-little brother just got some poor dumb white girl pregnant and it's not funny.

It's not an alternate universe, it's a manga that Type Moon gets money from but has nothing to do with the other works created or overseen by Nasu.</br></wbr></br>  Spyro said chapter 2 will be done this month, but will he still translate chapter 9? Because some anon already did that.<br><br>Oh and something I forgot to say<br><br> I won't let this shit die, mods </br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Read your post again, that made no sense.</br>  <br>An intelligent girl like Yukino wouldn't let him cum inside</br>  <br>She would only let him get her pregnant through platonic sex for the sole of escaping her family.</br>  <br>The true genuine relationship where they both get what they want. <br>  Haruno wants an interesting boy toy that she uses relieve stress from being a modern noble lady. [Also her way to annoy her mom, but marrying a deadbeat younger man.] <br>  8man wants an attractive wife that provides for him so he doesn't work. <br>There's no lying, both sides know what they want. Truly genuine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not what "sole" means.</br>  Rory  <br> Upstart nations wanting to get in on the Empire's new wealth by trying to out do them in negotiations with the JSDF. <br> A new gate discovered, that leads to a Sengoku Era Japan of a parallel universe (because we need to keep the nationality wanking to Japan). <br> A series focusing on Itami's children; the ones he had with Elf, Dark Elf, Pina, and Rory before she became a Goddess. Also features Bozes' daughter and Delilah's eventual child. Busty tits also finally having found a husband and having raped him for children. <br> Tyuule reborn because MAGIC and gods and on a road to redemption, suffering up until the very end, where she finally finds happiness with a simple chef. <br> A twist set many years in the future, where Japan now needs the aid of the magitech advanced Empire, and this time it's the technologically advanced but still war-loving Empire who comes to the aid of Japan. <br><br>Plenty of possibilities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if that's how you chosoe to see it.<br><br>i personally think it's because they're at war. why ask for fair terms when you're the overwhelmingly stronger party?</br></br></br>  <br> mushoku tensei <br> make death lose its meaning <br>no thanks</br></br></br>  <br> but it's still stupid that a seemingly smart guy would make the mistake in asking for that sort of absurd money. <br>Japan isn't asking a gazillion dollars for the fun of it. Japan estimated this is the amount the Empire needs to pay to undo the harm their invasion caused. Similar calculations were done for both world wars. This is not news to anyone. And you can't have peace without repatriations.</br></br>  <br>But he clearly didn't want to fuck them over like that. He made a complete mistake. It would be like asking a country to day for 900 gazillion dollars. If that was what he wanted, ok. But if he was altruistic enough that he wanted them to remain economically stable, that's just a silly thing to do.</br>  What makes the prison school manga so great? <br><br>I fucking love that art.</br></br>  <br> using references is forbidden for artists </br>  <br>tfw meiko's 3dpd is better looking than her<br><br>Also<br> T Swift is Hana's character model <br>No wonder she's so fucking ugly<br><br>Truly one of the worst girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Before he got bad.<br>I liked his artwork in Sojourn.</br></br>  <br>You even use the same images to your shitposts. Truly a pathetic person.</br>  <br>Can someone tell me what this nigger is talking about</br>  So we can all agree this is the best comedy of the season, yes?  Nobody mentioning the Fahrenheit 451 reference.  Where the hell is Hiryuu?  <br>Shimoneta has the deepest lore.</br>  <br><br><br>I want to impregnate her.</br></br></br>  <br>Before or after explaining to her that cumming inside makes her pregnant?</br></blockquote>]
