[ How technologically inclined is your waifu? Does she need help using computers? Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?     She can't really do that, she's not here physically after all, only in soul.  But my Yunocchi isn't a very technical person, that's for sure, but it's not like she's never used a computer! So Yuno would most likely ask for my help with anything technical around the house.      Makoto has a lot of technical stuff in his room like a TV, game consoles and a computer but he doesn't seem particularly knowledgeable about it in general, maybe above average. His strong fields are physical activities after all.   deder than bread up in here   She could use it just fine.    I don't really think she would be especially savvy. She shouldn't have much problems with just using computers or other devices, but she rather wouldn't be able to repair them.   It's not the best time to start thread.        Mai doesn't use computers and the type of weapon she uses was invented in the Bronze Age. So it could be argued that she isn't particularly proficient with technology.    She's got skills, can do the best programming, especially vidya. Well if it gets a virus or something, she can help me too.  Pretty much.  It's 1:45 am here, i think i will sleep and post again later   And at least leaving one question: Do you have something in common with your waifu?          Does your waifu ever have sleepovers with her friends? What does she do in them or what do you imagine she'd do if she doesn't have any?  (Mai does appear to do so based on this image. From what we can see, she and her friends appear to be trying on cosmetics such as nailpolish, styling their hair differently and putting on different clothes.)    I want to kiss my waifu on the nose.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127107959  What is the point of this post?    He's an underage spammer/shitposter.   Does your waifu resemble her parents or other relatives?  (Mai as a teenager does appear to resemble her mother. She's never shown clearly but they both have long hair of the same color and hair antennae. Beyond that she doesn't have any siblings and no other relatives of her other than her parent are shown.)     Well, with all the high-tech gear she uses, I'm guessing either she built them herself or she at least knows how to maintain them.  That is, she's much more technically inclined than I could ever be.    She's ronerier than I am.          We both are introvert and we both enjoy romantic setting/activities, I guess.   I dunno, she would probably just do usual activities in them like talking, having fun by styling each other hair.  She would be really embarrassed if someone asked her about relationship with me~    I want to kiss my waifu on everywhere. Especially on the lips.   No idea. There is no info about her parents.             We share a bunch of minor personality traits, but other than that we're not that alike, it's more that Yunocchi and I make a good match.   Usually when they have a little tea party in one of their apartments, it's easier and more fun to stay over.  Just normal teenage girl stuff, nothing particularly out of the ordinary.   She does, they are her parents after all.             Seeing as her very existence was erased/cursed by the most badass of overlords, nobody really knows if she even HAS parents.    In almost every way possible, we're exact opposites. She's incredibly determined, passionate, unyielding and has pretty damn good hand-eye-coordination. The only thing we have in common is probably the fact that we're both pretty shameless.   There isn't a single part of her body I wouldn't want to put my lips on.  What would you give your waifu for her birthday?  If I could somehow make it happen, I'd give my waifu  Makai Wars 2 .              She's really good with tech.   Not too much, I guess love for robots.   One ending in the game.   Looks somewhat similar to her sister.             She's probably adept at casual browsing but nothing of the programming sorts! She can most definitely handle most things on her end as long as it isn't too complex. She's definitely the leading pioneer in my heart's fields!  As for making or repairing, my dreams and my heart. She's made many of my nights wondrous, and a lot of my days bearable.   We've both had bad moments in our childhood and have trust issues.   She has! She either hogs the pools or stays away from all the ruckus and trouble.   She looks like a less mature and certainly less volatile version of her mother, and she'd probably get annoyed at me if I said that. She does share a lot of traits from both parents, but didn't really show much resemblance to them as a young child.   I wish I could keep giving her the same smiles and happiness that I often see her in. I wish I could keep giving every time, every day just to see her smile, but the times are a bit tough and I haven't had the ability to in the past eight months. It feels bad, but I hope that one day that it'll all even out and everyone goes home happy.                  Something she has lately showed interest in, eg. a dress she said that looks nice or jewelry she find nice. Otherwise, something related to her hobbies, like new microphone, headphones or something. And I would also take her on a really nice date to the place she really like, of course.   How long would you wait to have children with your waifu? Would you do it right now, wait until you get financially stable and had house or maybe wait for both of you reach particular age?        Never. I don't want children now or in the future.    I'd love it if she makes a song for me.  We're both weird and we like music.  I think she sleeps with her friend before her friend died. They were close and always stick together because of work, after all.  She doesn't resemble her uncle which is the only shown relative so far.  I'd give her a sword because she likes those.  I'd wait till we get married. Of course I want us to have a stable life first, we're married and has her family's approval before making kids, I don't want her family to get angry to her.              She's never used one before, so she'd need some help with it.  She makes my day.    Nothing major.   No, and i don't think they're really her kind of thing.   She shares some traits with her sister.   Something she's shown interest in, along with what i bake for her.   I'd wait until she'd be in good health.                    Very technologically inclined, for obvious reasons. Can't really say she's the leading pioneer though, as she's one of the mass-production models. Then again, she's the only remaining one, can't really say in that case. She aced all the engineering classes, so I'm betting she could fix most kinds of machinery. I'd want her to teach me some too.  A few things. We both like machines, have no patience for indirect approaches, say what's on our mind without holding back. She's a lot more positive and hopeful though.  Haven't seen her do sleepovers. But if she did, probably the same things girls do on such occasions. Talk a lot, be made to wear cute outfits, play those silly truth or dare games.  Just hope they don't decide to do a pillow fight, because if so, say goodbye to the bed.   I want to kiss her everywhere. But today, I'm inclined to forehead, in a loving praise sort of way.  Not in a physical sense. Despite mass production, they all differ from each other in small but significant ways. As for her 'mother', she resembles her very little.  I wish I could give her eternal happiness. But if you mean like an object, then I'd commission  Robocop's gun arm  for her. She might like it.  A trip to a science fair or an escapade to travel around and see the world are good options too.  Wait until we've accomplished all our dreams, so that we can finally settle down with no regrets. Then we can  construct  offspring, maybe adopt too.                    Hello!  He seems talented enough. Most pillar men are so intelligent that they tend to refer to the latest human technology as mere toys. Then again, I'm sure if he actually tried to use something like a computer, he might find himself surprised!   Something tells me that we'd repair things together or hand the job to whichever one of us has the time to do it. I do come from a family that likes to tinker with things after all, so it's not like I'm totally helpless when it comes to things like plumbing or mechanics. There's nothing we wouldn't be able to fix, I don't think.    We love niceu fightos!    A manly sleepover? Sounds interesting. Then again, considering his series, I wouldn't be surprised if a sleepover he'd go to played out much the same way.  I want to have a private sleepover with my husbando and do each other's nails!     We never see his parents and he has no siblings. I do have some pictures that someone made of what his parents could possibly look like, however! Naturally, his father resembles him quite a lot.    A birthday party! Something tells me that he's never been thrown one, which makes me very sad.    Whenever we're both ready. There's a lot of things to consider when it comes to having sonfus, of course.                          Is your waifu self-conscious about the size of her breasts?  Do you like your waifu's VA? How popular is she?   Mai is very polite, which is something I think I share with her, at least to an extent.  Perhaps she would like an antique blade.  Some greater stability would be good.  No, she's pretty well endowed and doesn't seem to concern herself with her chest size. If anything, she makes her less endowed friends feel jealous.  I hadn't really paid attention to Saori Hayami before she started voicing Mai, but since then I have been paying attention to her roles. She's very popular and cam third in this VA poll: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-04-06/kana-hanazawa-hiro<wbr>shi-kamiya-lead-in-favorite-voice-a<wbr>ctor-poll/.86759</wbr></wbr></wbr>             Probably average levels of tech understanding for a Japanese high schooler, maybe a little less because she's clumsy   We're clumsy   Don't know but I hope so given she lives alone and is probably lonely.   Who doesn't?   She doesn't seem to resemble her brother and you never see her parents   A comb or hair clips for her beautiful hair   Financial and emotional stability should be a prerequisite for having children. Age and marital status are less important so long as the woman isn't too young or old to have children meaning anywhere outside 15-40 years old.   She's self conscious of her weight which is maybe related to the size of her breasts.                        How would you respond if you discovered that your waifu used to be a man?   Well, she piloted a Mecha once so she knows enough about technology. All in all she is pretty intelligent.   We're both kinda lazy and we both love pizza. I also like teasing my friends like she sometimes does.  I really would love to have a children with her but I don't think I would be a good parent.  She slept really long in Lelouchs room do you could count that as sleepover, but if it's a sleepover with her friends and stuff, they would probably eat fast-food, talk all night long and sleep till noon.          I'm sure we would really like to have children sooner, but we would wait until we got house with enough space for kids and until we would be financially stable. I want to be sure our kids will have good living conditions.   Probably. However I would remind her that her bust size is perfect for me and that it looks really cute and arousing with her petite body multiple times.   I don't care about her at all. She doesn't even sound like Miku.          Not really, but sometimes it is shown that she hides her breasts. I hope she gets more confident about her perfect chest.  She's the most popular seiyuu of this age, and she's named as "The Queen of Anison". Fuck yes, I like her. I admire her a lot.  I won't be that shocked, since she's manly anyway, she gets more bitches than I do.        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Fuck off, retard. No one cares if your feelings are genuine.  The correct term for loving multiple 2D girls is harem and there are dedicated threads for people like you. Waifu threads are meant only for people who are in love with only one girl so you will never be welcomed here. Leave this place and go to harem threads.     Not really, no. She helped out with water damage, at least.   Brown hair and eyes.   There was that OVA released a few days ago where she's at one with the other fairies, so it's not out of the question. They'd most likely drink and have food, maybe talk about the day.   Never say her parents.   That one BL doujin that'll most likely get burned if TPP passes today.   Until we are both ready for a child and at marriage. The 25 range seems most suitable.   Shocked at the fact that she was a man, then shocked that she might actually be gay.  I'd still keep her, though.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Get out.  Does your waifu ever read any doujins? What kind, if she does, and what kind do you think she'd read if she didn't? Non-H works are acceptable answers.                           Unfortunately, yes. I want to alleviate her of her insecurity by reassuring her that they're gorgeous  or just repeatedly impregnating her until they're a few sizes larger .    She replaced the battery in my F 91-W  Hardly  I doubt it  The world may never know  A Nixie clock. Or maybe a snowglobe, snowglobes are cool  Maybe in the late 20's. Sounds like a much better age to start. Better to wait until one is finished with education and has a career  They're not badly sized, I doubt it.  Oh my, the voice. The VOICE. It might be the most sexy thing about her  My dong only expands further <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  In my particular case it's inevitable. For other waifus, absolutely haram                      That wouldn't change anything about her, so I don't see why one should focus on the past. I think that the reaction of Mai's friends when they discovered about her past (illustrated here) is a good one.  I'm pretty sure that Mai has never read any doujinshi, since most of the world's nuclear armaments were dropped on Japan and wiped that country off the face of the Earth close to a century before she was born. She's pretty innocent.and easily embarrassed though, so I imagine that she'd prefer to read light-hearted humorous non-H doujinshi.      She lives in Soul Society which is essentially feudal Japan, the only people using advanced technology belong to the Technological Development Department which she is not a part of. She has spent a lot of time on earth and knows about our technology I.E computers but I doubt she is well versed in utilizing them.  I'd say we're both bold and heavily supportive of our friends.  She sleeps in MC's closet whenever she comes to earth. She doesn't partake in any activities outside of the usual drawing and reading. I don't think she has actually ever had a traditional sleepover.  Don't we all?  She looks almost identical to her late sister and looks eerily similar to her adoptive brother despite no blood relation.  Something chappy related, probably a plush toy. Perhaps a brand new set of high quality drawing utensils, she loves to draw after all.  Not the largest fan of kids, but with her there is a possibility. I'd want to take proper responsibility and thus wait until we're both financially able to support a child as well be being both physically and mentally ready to support the child.  Her breast size is rather small, especially compared to other characters in the same series  not that I'm complaining of course  but she never mentions or even implies she is bothered by it at all. She doesn't care one bit, which is great.  Fumiko Orikasa is great, she's the perfect voice for Rukia. She's voice acted quite a few characters but she's mainly known for her role of Rukia.  Hey, friend.  Orihime a cute.   We talking magical transformation or post operation? I'm surprised to say the least.                                she's pretty good with technology, and can figure anything out if there's a manual to skim through   we're pretty similar, especially in terms of sleepiness and personality.    Most likely. They have a camping trip, in which she spends the entire time asleep - waking up when it's time for food.    Her Grandmother is her only living relative, and they look incredibly similar.    a book, or something cute.   probably never   not really, but she's certainly aware in the difference between her breast size and that of her well endowed friends.   Yep,the voice is perfect. She's not very well known though.   I don't think so.  you're waifu a cute, by the way  If money wasn't an option, where would you take you're waifu on holiday? What would you do?                            Don't derail the thread.  Ded tred. Are waifus finally obscure again?    Basic as fuck, watches idol videos on YouTube. Yes. Nope, she's dumb as fuck but is a natural leader (which I like).  She gave me sweets, different each time.    We are both hyperactive, klutz, disorganized usually, air-headed and one-track minded. Also very stubborn.   Yes. Practices, swims (if pools or at the beach), and eats for days; pillow fights are possible and tends to wander around while asleep.   More on her mother. Slight resemblance to her little sis.   Bread with strawberry jams. Varied imports.   Need a house or two so she can be at ease.   Not really.   Yes! Quite a bit, I suppose.                           Not in the near future.  Maybe once (if) she manages to syujinko it up.    She's not flat, and she never seems to have any trouble with them. With her recent Idol escapades, I'm sure she's pretty satisfied with her own body.    tfw different VAs for every game    Wouldn't really change much. The past is the past afterall.   Unfaithful manwhore.                I'm quite sure she's the type to use Doujinshi as "research material".    Until we're financially stable and emotionally ready.  But definitely not before Yunocchi had a chance to explore and further her artistic path!   Only a tiny bit, it doesn't come up all that often. Though she generally tends to be a little insecure.   She's pretty popular, mainly thanks to the role in which she voiced my wife. A good voice actress all around.            Oh shit   is meant to be<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200       My waifus   Her VA is in everything this season. It's great to hear her voice in so many roles.    I'm pretty sure she doesn't. She probably wouldn't watch any pornography at all.   Rented house near sea. We would go to beach a lot, explore nature around, watch sunsets etc.   Why would they? It's normal for a thread to be slow at this time of a day.         <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115413  It doesn't matter. How would you feel if your waifu had another man? It's the same as NTR-ing your waifu.  Falling in love with multiple people comes off as never truly falling in love with a single one of them.  Harems a shit       Who made it law that someone can only "truly" fall in love with one person? Seems arbitrary to me.     law  Do you have reading comprehension issues?     6 pm isn't a slow time here    My point in saying that is that everybody acts as if it's law, when it's not. Love knows no man-made arbitrary rules. Who is anyone to deny you your love because THEY deem it unfit?    It's not about your feelings, dipshit, but about the girl's.   Enough about polygamy! Question time!  What couple activity would you like to do with your waifu? Yes, watching vietnamese pictographs count as a couple activity if you're doing it together.  We'd probably play vidyas together and she would probably rant about how the RNG hates her.        How retarded do you have to be to not understand what people are saying to you? <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113477  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115002      People like that are just egotistical scum, they don't even stop for a second to thing about the girls' feelings. It's despicable.   I doubt she would, unless maybe for artistic references. She'd rather read the original work to begin with, though.     I'm not much for travelling, but for my Yunocchi's sake, we'd most likely to any location with a rich art history. If she's having fun, then I will be too!          I understand what they're saying. I just think they're wrong.   Why? Isn't having actual discussion more interesting than playing questionnaire?      Stop taking the bait.   She seems somewhat computer literate. Nothing spectacular, mind you, but nothing minor either.  We both have a thing for good music, plus we're pretty similar in terms of personality.  Quite often. She's pretty closely knit with her friends, though what exactly happens during these sleepovers is beyond me. As long as it doesn't involve leek sticks being stuck in awkward places...  Hard to answer. There's no info on her parents, and she isn't the type to talk about them.  The best platter of tuna sushi that I can prepare.  Definitely the latter. She still has a career to think about, and I don't want to do anything that might bring that to an end.  Wouldn't mind trying, though...   She can be, but only because of the attention they bring her... She might not be the biggest, but they are big enough to draw the eyes of the jealous and lecherous.  She's got a nice sultry voice. Can't say anything too bad about Yuu. Though a high point would be hearing her squee as Sakaki in a certain scene from Azumanga Daioh.  Well, nobody's perfect.  Highly doubtful. Then again, her mind can be particularly lewd when she wants.  A nice stroll through a park sounds nice. Just have to find a nice park in my area.  A nice sea cruise to the tropics. She's always loved being out on the water.                          Having a stroll while holding hands and talking together, cuddling under blanket in front of fireplace at winter evening, kissing while watching stars or sunset and much more.   Not in USA.       Don't tell me what to do.    Obligatory    she would download ALL the dolphin screensavers. those free toolbars also sound useful   most of the related group-trip is off camera, but its one of the few times shes shown interacting with just other girls aside from that her sister also stays with them so it's sort of like every night is a sleep over   her hair colour is similar in the second season but aside from that they don't look much like their younger sister and her parents are never shown.   my stance on it has flip flopped a lot back and forth but I think I'd really just have to ween her character into it I might start her off with a puppy so she gets used to having responsibility, I also like dogs myself so its not that big a deal if I end up taking care of it on my own or something  I'd love to have a daughter with her, just thinking about it makes my heart race a bit, but there is so much to think about before then.    no, she's incredibly non-self-conscious about just about anything   they're both great her jap isn't that popular, and also voiced one of the most hated characters on /a/, but her dub has a massive history of roles with some of the most popular dubs on /a/, notably bebop   given her abilities I suppose it's not exactly impossible, but it also would be by magic instead of snapping a dick off and making a flesh hole so I'm down.   she's read regular manga, so I'd think she'd have no issues reading non-h it'd be interesting walking in on her reading an h-doujin not hearing me come in with her face blushing  I'm not sure whether I'd sneak out so I don't get bludgeoned for spooking her or sneak in further and try to initiate by kissing her neck while shes concentrating    gardening seems nice, though I'd be a little afraid if she got too enthusiastic she might somehow acquire some sort of giant venus fly trap that keeps us at bay from the garden until it dies                                  Does your waifu know how to please a man?   Shinobu's pretty smart. She's one of the more talented biopsychologists in Academy City although not the best, and she's pretty proud of it. She's also confident with machines and computers.  I don't think she can help me with my psychology, my biology, maybe.   I don't believe she has sleepovers, since she previously used to live alone and didn't have any friends. She probably does with Janie and Febrie now though.   I couldn't say, since her relatives and such were never shown.   Spend time with her. She likes reassurance that she's doing good.    Probably would prefer to wait until we had a house. However, a lot of that stuff can be excuses, and she's shown that she's partial to kids so the answer would be 'as soon as possible'.   She never mentions anything like that, so she probably thinks that it's silly. Or maybe she does privately.   Hayama Ikumi? She's okay, not super popular. I haven't gone out of the way to check her roles out, and none of them that I've heard are anything like Shinobu.   I'd be surprised at how advanced science has come.   A relaxing resort or the like.   We could visit cafes often, does that count? OR take Janie and Febrie around to play and shit.   Boy, reading the word 'couple activities' used to make me mad.   Blogshit warning: I've recently been questioning myself a lot because 80 - 90% of my thoughts regarding her have been of wanting to do lewd stuff, which does betray a certain shallowness. I'm not quite sure how to overcome this, I probably need to give more thought to her personality.                                    Not at all.   Amusing ones.   That's a cute outfit.   Sex.             She's really good with Technology, she's always on her laptop and she's great with tinkering electronic devices  She made some headphones once as a gift, they are described as "revolutionary" which shows off her amazing skill     Quick, share one sexual fantasy you have with your waifu  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127117509  The waifufags are the worst.    We both love technology and music, i mostly like calm and relaxing environments and so does she, and we both like sharing random trivia   She has a really close friend but she moved away, i don't think she has any sleepovers   I'd give her a brand new laptop, hers must be pretty old That and a piece of jewelry, maybe a necklace           I want to  make love to her  in the  missionary position  while I  hold  her soft, warm  hands  and then  cuddle  afterwards    Fuck her cute butt.    Making love in formal wear comes to mind.   Alternatively omorashi      The fanbase considers her a queen in that regard.  In the shower or on a billiard table.      I wanna give her a slow pleasurable oral while she wraps her thighs around my head and i massage different parts of her   She's a Super Class A hacker   Ahh, but how is she when she doesn't surf?    But I thought she was incredible math    Rather not, but I would lead her to make us both feel good. Her pleasure would be more important to me though.   Romantic, passionate sex in lotus position while embracing tightly and looking into each other eyes, I guess.        Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?   How can she? She's not real.      Chihiro prefers to read books on paper, but she's accepted the growing influence of the internet and its effects on people.   We're both huge nerds who love art   Book covers.  And books to put those covers on    Until we're in a stable life situation and after we're married.   No   Yes, but not that popular. It's good, since i don't have to think of her in other roles much.   It's Chihiro I care about, but this scenario is neither here or there since she's cis  love    Probably, she loves Shoujo manga so despite fandom claims I don't think she'd read yaoi.   We'd watch movies. Chihiro doesn't like reading together since she'd want to talk if we're around, so movies sound like they would work.  How would you greet her after you've had a long day of work? I'd give her a hug and kiss and if she weren't too busy I'd invite her to lay down and watch something with me.                              Thanks.   Sex with her on my lap  while interlocking our fingers    L-Lewd!          I'd wait until we both have a stable situation, a home and a good income   She doesn't seem to be too worried about it, she seems happy with herself as she is, which is great   I do, Mamiko Noto does a great job showing Fuuka as the gentle and caring person she is   I'd probably take her sightseeing, there's not much to do in port Island but I'm sure we could just walk around and make a picnic under a three or watch some movies   We'd go sightseeing and taking photographs, we could also watch some live music shows and concerts                That's too private to say!    But it's not like I hadn't mentioned face sitting and spanking her cute butt before.    A long and tight hug, then pick her up for a kiss, and carry her right to bed for some quality cuddling time.        I'm going to impregnate Nero! I love my emperor!   I think that New Zealand would be an interesting country to visit.  I used to do fencing. Maybe we could try that out and see what I remember, though she would trounce me quite effortlessly. (I did foil while her fighting style resembles the sabre but I don't think she'd have any problems adapting.)  She's a virgin and has never had a boyfriend, but I'll wager that she knows what she'd need to do for that.  A hug and kiss sounds like a good way to proceed.          I'd hug her and ask how her day went, serve her some tea, give her a massage to relieve her stress, and make sure she's satisfied and relaxed  Question What would be your waifu's ideal vacation?  (Fuuka seems the type of girl who'd love a nice landscape, i imagine taking her some place with lot's of wilderness)         If she's home when I am, I'd greet her with a warm hug and some tender words. Usually depends on how exhausting my day has been.   She seems fond of any place with nice scenery, though she seems especially lively near the ocean. It's part of the reason I'd like to take her on an ocean cruise one of these days.  I've only been on one, and I wouldn't mind giving that same experience to someone close to me.        The size, not really. She may feel bad that they aren't soft though.  Haven't really seen a lot of other stuff she's done, but I like what I've seen. Unsure how popular she is, but she doesn't seem to get many roles.  Not very surprised. She may look like and identify as a girl, but she has turned out to be rather flexible in that regard.  I would hope she wouldn't read them at all. Otherwise I may get really clumsy flirting or awful jokes thrown at me.  Actually, that sounds kinda nice .  I don't think she's ever been to the mountains. Let's go there.  So many things: Playing games. Cuddling. Going out holding hands. Take her to a fancy party and dance. Sparring. Go shopping.  Fighting evil back to back against impossible odds, and propose there and then. It's the most romantic setting of all.   You lost me.  Well, the most sexual thing we could possibly do would be  hugging .  Hello Chihiroman!  Say "I'm back", receive "Welcome back".  But that's not enough, gotta wrap an arm around her waist and pull her in for a kiss. Or nuzzle her neck with my nose, that's fine too.   She enjoys learning and seeing new things, so the best thing for her would be a trip around the world. 80 days might not be enough though.                                She at least knows how to use a computer but I doubt she's tech savvy. Well she could give herself the necessary skills to be.  Pretty opposite except for a love of things that are artistic.  Seen pics of her and Casko sleeping together so I guess that counts.  She does resemble her mother and if you buy into the theory that she and Arturia are related then of course they resemble each other.  Almost like clones or something.<br/>   I always have trouble thinking of something for this but maybe a party and a trip to the theater.  I don't really want any and she seems like she'd be too busy but if she wanted it then I would wait till things settled down.  Naw. She knows she looks great.  Sakura Tange is great and I would think she would be popular for voicing Sakura Kinomoto.  Not surprised. I guess that's how she really got away with being recorded as a man.  She hasn't been shown to but I can see her reading yuri ones. Also ones about herself.  Perhaps a trip to the most beautiful cities in Europe.  I'd like to work on an art piece with her and take part in one of her plays.  Man and/or woman, her technique is the best.  Steamy sex in the bath.   Looks like she's popular.                                 Almost our entire relationship is based upon things we have in common, it's what attracted me to her so much in the first place. We are lazy, daydreamers, prone to hoarding, dislike bureaucracy, love potatoes, enjoy inebriation, navigate life at our own slow and steady tempo, and a lot more to boot!  Talking, fun, teasing, drinking, playing and sleeping.  Her twin sister Ursula looks precisely the same as her, just with glasses.  I'll think about that next April.  As long as we need. I really want to, but realistically, we're still too lazy as of now.  Not usually. She looked a bit miffed in S2/E10 when Francesca groped Hanna but aside from that one time, she seems fine with her petite bust, even when surrounded by larger girls. In any case, I prefer slim girls. Built for speed!  I think Sakura Nogawa is somewhat underrated, although that could just be my own bias.  If money isn't an option, then we'll have to make do with camping in the forest nearby.  She pleases me regularly but I prefer to please her.  Ignore those who would attack that as blogshit, as they'll only be crying about the questions and lack of interaction later. Anyway, what you describe may not be shallowness as much as becoming carried away with lewdness, which is something that can happen to many of us (including me). At any rate, you seem to be able to answer the questions well.  Being handcuffed as she sits on my face while lovingly applying a pleasure/pain combo of oral and CBT! Well, you did ask...  Standard-issue hug and kiss, quickly wash my face and hands, followed by a makeout session on the couch/bed. This may lead to either cuddling, lewd, or both!  Anywhere with sun and good ice-cream, so she can just eat and relax in the shade.                            Changing waifus is degeneracy, right?    Same here     Not necessarily, it wholly depends on the specific circumstances.  But most excuses are scummy.      She is never seen using computers. I think she may need some assistance in using a computer.  We have a couple of things in common like fighting for our friends.  Yes she definitely does. She is the one who make cake and stuff to eat and she is the lewdest around them.  Oh yea Akeno looks exactly like her mother  I would give her lingerie  She would want me to get settled into a house then have our child  Biggest bust in the series she doesn't care  I love her VA. She is pretty popular http://myanimelist.net/people/93/It<wbr>ou_Shizuka  Why should that matter I dont think she would change if she was a he  She does not read doujins though she does watch   porn   on her free time  I would take her to   Go to the movies then go to my home and relax  If you mean massages and finger licking   SAndM with her which turns to passtionate sex to make children            </wbr>                   Vidya, naps, and the aforementioned pictographs.    kissu and cuddles, and a cup of tea.    somewhere quiet, like a nice forest lodge.          Chihiro's ideal vacation is sort of like Kyoto: Lots of stuff to see and a relaxing area. Distant, yet familiar at the same time.  The Fushimi shrine is also in Kyoto but that has not much to do with it and is likely coincidence    Hello, Aigisfriend! Chihibro is fine, really. I do wish there was a way I could get to know you more, I like getting to know my fellow Personafriends.        She's average at it, she knows how to use her computer/phone, she have no problems with these kind of things.  She made  me happy.    Minor personality traits, we love cute stuff, and both afraid of heights.   She had a few of them. They did a lot of stuff in them, played games, girls talk, she really enjoyed them.   I want to headpat the bassist.   Her parents are never shown, and she's the only kid of the family, so I have no answer to this question.   A new amp.  That's what she was thinking about what she would buy if she had extra money  But also a nice gateau au chocolat, flowers, and a few other things.   Until we have our own place, and a stable situation.   She is. Her best friend is also jealous of them at the beach.   I like her and she's kinda popular.   I would wonder what kind of technology was used, because there's not a single trace of her previous self, she can even be pregnant, that's amazing.   Never.   A tropical island, where we could be alone on the beach, relax, play in the water, sunbathe, and do lewd things. Or maybe a nice cabin in the Alps, mountains are lovely, I've always loved them  and the word Mountain is also in her name, that's a sign    Taking bass lessons with her as the teacher. Biking together. Cuddles.  I love her.                                                 she is better than that    J-Jellycatz? You are still alive?     She does use magitech a lot and doesn't need help with those computers, but she's not exactly an expert with that stuff.   We both care about justice.   I can see a resemblance to her mother, and she looks like Alicia for obvious reasons.   Not any specific age, just when we both fell like we're ready.   She seems fine with their size.   She's extremely popular, and I really like her. Can't wait for that Live Acoustic BD.   Someplace on a lake where we could spend time together.   Build Gunpla together.   A hug and kiss, and ask her how it went.                             If Yomiko reads a book on the subject I think she can master the computer     Something in common  Our love of literature    I imagine Nene sleeping over whenever she would come to do the cleaning    Her parents are never seen so I have no idea    A bunch of books or try to track down a signed edition of one of her favourite her novels    A couple years, that's if we really want too.    I think she's pretty oblivious to how big they are    Yomiko's VA has only voiced her    Probably not doujins but I imagine her reading good old lewd literature    Probably Paris for literary reasons     Reading together, going to bookshops and just buying what we can find, going to book festivals.    Making love to Yomiko against a book case in a library, trying to be as quiet as possible as we undress one another, next would be bending her over a table and doing doggy.     A hug then kiss and I'd tell her I would prepare some tea, maybe a shoulder rub or foot rub to go along with it.  What have you done for your waifu lately? I've bought about 16 or so books lately which I hope Yomiko would enjoy.                                                        I've been exercising and arranging my folders a lot i need to have it all nice and tidy    Apart from the an eager hug, a long relaxing dinner and getting shit about our respective days off our chest, if she wants.    Mentioned it earlier - nothing too stimulating, something chill like a cruise or resort. I'd like that too.   Thanks again.   I made a new reference pic for WWD, eh, and wrote some stuff. I 'went out' with her a few times. Saw a Railgun LN in the bookstore which made for a strange experience.  How do you guys feel 'close' to her - following a routine, doing stuff, looking at merch?               Rather than going to a single location a luxury cruise with just the two of us sounds pretty great.  Couple activity? Now I'm no romantic but things like; Video games, watching movies, cooking and just generally hanging out with her would be a lot of fun.  She knows how to please me. Thats enough.  Bondage sounds like something worth trying out. If only once.   Welcome home! Shall I run you a bath? Or perhaps you'd like something to eat? Or maybe...you want me?   My geography is bad, I can't name a single place. But Rukia really likes high places, so someplace with mountains, maybe cliffs.                <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  It's a thing with squares that you eat for breakfast, but that's not important right now.   she is a gamer   I think Kagura knows the basics. She wouldn't accidentally download a load of viruses on a computer or anything like that.  She repaired  my soul.    We both like videogames and swimming.   Her parents have never been seen, so I can't say for certain.   I bought her a necklace for her birthday last year. Nothing too fancy, just something she can wear all the time. I haven't thought about what to do for this year.   We'd definitely need some financial stability;  there's no way I could afford having a child on a part time wage.  A house/apartment to ourselves with plenty of space would also be a good idea.   Not really,  she's pretty endowed as is.    Kuwashima's one of the best, in my opinion. She has great range and has done a lot of work since the mid-90's, and still going.   It wouldn't change a thing between the two of us.   I don't think she does, but if she did I could see her being into shounen/sports manga.                             absolutely none at all   Working on my outer appearance. Trying to look good for her.  Come next week, I'll be training to become an instructor.    Listening to her songs is usually the way to go when I'm home. Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side; it's a feeling that flares up even more when I come across merch of her. Mostly, though, I feel close to her during my training. Thinking of her gives me the drive to intensify my efforts and keep pushing forward.        Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side  amen to that     I stare at her photos all the time and i play Persona 3 a lot and speak with her in-game    Road trip across the coast of France and along southern Europe.   There's so much I could think of! Spending the day at the beach or a water park is pretty high up on my list though.   Wanting to do lewd things with your partner is a natural part of the relationship. As long as the two of you are fine with it, there shouldn't be any need to worry.   I want to  2lewd4u  her in the  censored.    Lift her up as we hug eachother, and give her a peck on the cheek.   She'd love to visit America sometime, but she's a little concerned about flying.   Depends on the circumstances.   I did a pretty intense workout with her the other day.  No, not that kind of workout.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893   A wonderful little pile of love!    Going out jogging, exercising, looking at pictures of her, and the daki.                               I think it would be her greeting me first. She would hug and kiss me. Then I would probably go rest somewhere with her so we could talk about our day and maybe plan how we will spend the rest of the day.   Any warm, nice place where we could spend lot's of time outside, I guess.   Nothing more than usual things, like listening to her songs, cuddling and talking to her in bed etc.    How do you guys feel 'close' to her  Well, the closest I feel to her is when I cuddle and talk to her daki while pretending its her, daydreaming while being high and fantasizing about having sex with her during masturbation.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  The girl that made me feel thing I've never felt before.                 Hug, kiss, even more kissing.   I think she'd really enjoy just relaxing on the beach.   Trying to stay happy.   Wake up to her, think about her during the day, go to sleep looking at her and other things.             Fate a cute.    I'd like that as well.  Getting more pics. So many pages to go.  Her fig stands to the side of the monitor, always watching. That's as close as it can be, I think. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  Love in its purest, undistilled form. Not for the faint of heart.           Keep up a steady work rate. No real days off with internship and job but I'm working harder for her!   Kissing her daily.   I'm looking forward to it! Just where could we talk, though?          Thank you, she is.    No, not really. I don't think she's ever shown anything like that.   Yui Horie has a really cute and wonderful voice. I'd imagine she's pretty popular.   Severely creeped out and feel very odd at first, but if she's 100% girl now by whatever reasons, I don't think I'd have really much to say. If she's 100% the same as she is now even after, then it's just a short awkward while of strange.   Some cute doujins I'd imagine, robot fanworks,  Erotic Butler BL doujins perhaps    Anime, videogames, questing and work. A lot more things, too.   Severely doubt it.    1boy 1girl cum cum_on_body cum_on_breasts cum_on_clothes cum_on_hair cum_on_lower_body cum_on_upper_body cumdrip facial cum_in_mouth cum_in_pussy lingerie sex happy_sex missionary_position doggystyle cowgirl reverse_cowgirl thighhighs                       Super lewd all night    I'd give her some hugs and kisses, then I'd just sit down in the couch or chair and laze around for a while.   Not much, apart from trying to lose some weight, at least ease into something.   Daki.                               I love Ai so so much!    I don't know, but if she doesn't, teaching her how to use computers and maybe even program sounds really fun.   A quiet, but fierce determination when it comes to doing things, whether it be academic or recreational. I have to admit though, that she is better at actually getting started than I am.    She is pretty popular, but I don't really pay attention to her. I thought it was funny that she had to have a conversation with herself while working on Cross Ange on more than one occasion.    Money is no object  Space. I'd love to see the stars with her, but up close, which is something I could only manage if I had near unlimited resources. That or Cancun.   Help her improve her swim times, learn something together such as a dance, language or other skill. I'd like to do some unorthodox things that might be fun too like urban exploration. Really, I'd love to do quite a few things with her.    This sums it up quite nicely: http://pastebin.com/Z5v70Z19l    I'd hug her from behind and stay like that for a while, then I'd kiss her and tell her I love her.    I don't do it intentionally like "Oh I need to think about Ai today", but every so often I'll get this really bubbly feeling of being in love and do something as an outlet for that: drawing, writing, listen to romantic songs, some of them sad, and they remind me of her.  Especially the songs it's something I find myself doing a lot lately. Man, if I close my eyes and lip sync while pretending I'm singing to her, I feel like my chest is going to burst from emotion and I feel like crying    OHHH MYY LOVEEEE, MY DARLIIING                                 this pastebin has been deleted  Fuck you too Pastebin. Good thing I saved it. Giving it another shot:  http://pastebin.com/CamHEYG7      Yeah, good thing you saved it.    We don't share many traits but we're a good match and complement each other.   He does. Judging by some official pictures, a lot of plush animals, cute pajamas and sweets are involved. I'm sure they have a lot of fun together.   I want to kiss Makoto on the nape.   He looks like a perfect mix of his parents.   Pets, tickets for amusement parks/zoos/aquariums and my love.   I'd honestly let Makoto decide. I trust him to be reasonable enough and he loves children so I want him to be happy.   Not only the chest but his whole body actually. Makoto popped a shirt button off his shirt because he's so well endowed and got really embarrassed about it, it was so adorable.   His VA does an incredible job with Makoto's sweet, gentle and warm voice, I love it. I think his VA is semi popular but I'm not that knowledgeable about seiyuu.   I wouldn't care. I love Makoto the way he is now.   Makoto wouldn't read lewd stuff so light-hearted non-H works only if anything.   Travel to various places around the world.   We'd pet cats, play vidya, cuddle and eat sweets together.   No, Makoto is purer than fresh snow.  I'll teach him though.    Let him sit on my face and please him orally in various places.   Hug and a kiss on the foreahead, cheek and mouth in this order while caressing his back.   Makoto would love beautiful landscapes and impressive places so I'd do a tour around the world with him.   Look at pictures, imagine various scenarios to please him and hug my Makoto pillow. Post a picture of your waifu when she was young.                                                     Pretty competent with machines. Her phone above all things is pretty advanced considering it's a phablet and bluetooth at the same time.  You can say she fixed my heart, if that counts.  Even if it upsets people on a personal level, we will do what is right.  Doesn't care.  Satomi isn't that popular. That said, she was definitely a contributor in getting me to really notice what I had been missing in my life. She truly brought Kuroko to life in the adaptations, and I respect her greatly.  I would not be surprised.  Lewd thinking is pretty natural when it's for the one you love. Thanks, brain.  The merch search is never over.   how  Exactly what you said, and daki in the morning, or when I go to sleep.                     She's pretty well inclined. She never had one of her own, due to growing up in an orphanage, but she's interested. She hasn't repaired anything for me, no.  Several things, actually. We're both shy, have problems with self esteem and self worth, and both have a stutter. My problems aren't nearly as bad as hers.  She spends a lot of time with her friend Lilly, but no mention of a sleepover.  We don't see her parents, seeing as how they died when she was young.  Something small and heartfelt. She never liked her birthday much, but I'd use the day to tell her how much she really means to me and how much I love her.  A little while. I don't think we would rush into it, but we wouldn't wait too long.  No, she's much more self-conscious about other things.  She doesn't have one.  If she isn't anymore, I don't see the problem. I fell in love with her as she is now, and I wouldn't stop loving her.  Unknown. She loves reading books, though.  Somewhere quiet and peaceful. I think a trip into nature somewhere would be lovely.  Watch movies, play vidya, cuddle.  Give her a big hug and kiss, and tell her how much I missed her.  Someplace where your troubles could just melt away, and you could be on your own.  I think about her every day, and always keep her close to my heart.                                Wasn't there an IRC or a Steam group? I'm unsure.    We can make an IRC channel for just us if you wanna talk one-on-one.    Does your waifu have a blood sister?  Can she defeat gojira?      They never died: they just faded away.     How technologically inclined is your waifu?   Not much.  Does she need help using computers?  Maybe a little but she is the type who can learn fast.   Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   No way.  Yes, we share similar traits in personality, other than that not much.  Yes, in an ideal world she does. They play games like old maid, watch TV, eat snacks, tea and keki, talk about their lives, have pillow fights, etc.  I wish I knew, I soppused it's the same as Yuno. Her warmt comes from her parents.  To be happy.   wait until you get financially stable and had house  Pretty much that.  Yes, she knows she's perfect and I love her.  I don't really care much about her. But she's pretty popular.  Panic!  Something happy and cute, like Life of Maid.  Italy, go everywhere. I want to go there and I'm pretty sure she would also love it.  I would do my hobbies together with her and we'd travel a lot.   Fendom, all the way.    Hello, honey. How was your day?  Kiss, hug and massage. Easy.  Italy. Ari ari---  Bought figures of her.  Merch.                                           Miku would be the closest thing to one, though the fanbase feels that they are closer than blood sisters.   And suddenly I remember a song from the second Project Diva game where your chosen character can grow kaiju size and fight a Gojira expy. She could probably handle the King of the Monsters quite fine, though I doubt her chances against the likes of Destroyah.       There's still an IRC channel.     She'll do better than jet jaguar. How would she handle Orga?      A bit bulky, but nothing to worry about; especially if she has momentum on her side. Should be interesting to see her take on Biollante, though; I mean, all those vines...       i posted it in the spook zone for you two live bards    theres  a few            She lives in a medieval fantasy world, so she doesn't know anything about modern technology  she used to have problems i also used to have and both of us have a bad temperament  nope  yes, her sister also has pink hair, and they mention that maybe she is going to look more like her sister when she grows up  i really don't know what would be a good gift,she can have everything she wants because she is from a noble family,maybe i would invite her to a very special place on a date    she is 16 and im 18 having a child wouldn't be a good idea right now i think we would wait a few years , at least until she is 21   yes  i don't know how popular rie is but i like her  if the money isn't a problem i would take her to a private island where we could have fun together  i would love to travel alnd explore the world with her, also watching movies and cuddling would be nice  giving her a huge hug every day and a kiss  somewhere were we could be toghether without having to deal with anyone else, just a nice place for the 2 of us                           Bulky in all the right places, am I right?     She can use pretty much anything than the average japanese girl can use.  We both are responsible and mature.  She had some sleepovers with her friends.  Not possible to know.  Sweets and musical stuff.  Wait untill she's prepared for children.  She knows what she has.   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127106709#p127125747">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    Thanks mister.   We can go to that one.   But it will have to wait a bit, I must go out. Will be back in 3 hours or so.          Amen to that.     She doesn't really use technology a lot. She's not really mechanical either.   Aside from introversion and  deep love , not too much now that I think about it.   Aside from sharing the occasional hotel room, no.   She resembles her mother a lot, especially with the eyes. They share some personality traits too, but her mother is far more imposing and generally kind of intimidating.   I buy her flowers every year.   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127106709#p127126033">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong As I Expected     what does 8man's dick taste like?   Coma cheese   Denialfags not allowed below this line ________________________________    ask saika     It seems like the most positive exchange they've had in the entire series is when Yukino asks Haruno for help during the culture festival when they need to buy time for Hachiman to find Meguri, Haruno refuses because she's confident Yukino won't be able to stand up for herself, but Yukino does just that and takes her by surprise. Haruno even complements her on how it looks like she's changed.   And we went from that to where we are in vol 11.  I don't think Yukino really needs years of self-reflection away from Hachiman and Yui to overcome her problems like some say. She has that found that answer already. She just needs to rediscover it.        Reminder that the code got cracked.    I meant Sagami not Meguri.    Friendly reminder that Yukino has had absolutely no romantic development with the 8man.   Right on man, Iroha's feelings aren't genuine   Where is my Legion?   Genuine    8man is her god. She would give herself to him if he simply asks for it.    Gay isnt wrong at all    Yui's feelings are not romantic    saying "you don't even have your will" is the most cruel thing you can do to your sister.  Can't blame her though, must be frustrated seeing her sister acting that way for more than ten years and just couldn't do shit about it must feel horrible for Haruno, too.      Max coffee    8cum tastes sweet because he drinks MAX coffee    bags of sandy milk and salty coins     continuing from last thread:     because friends never take pictures       lol deluded     But seriously though. If you think that she would go to romantic end and put all of the things she was trying to build up from the start to the trash, then YOU guys are the deluded ones.                   She just needs to rediscover it.  My thoughts exactly. Funny that the right answer had been at the middle point of the series all along. Though I am pretty excited we might go back to that in the last volume or two.      because friends never take pictures  They took a lot of pictures in Destinyland but she went out of her way to buy that one expensive picture of just her and Hachiman alone.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127121196  I missed this pic.    Do you have a lot of girls who want to be your friend all the time? If so you might be the main character for an anime    Taking a break.    2spoopy    the only one that would know     all the things she was building up to the trash  There are people who actually believe this     Too much denialfags right now, better wait until they get bored    Yukino   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KVk<wbr>ziuwXif0</wbr>  [ ]      Rewinding from my earlier post:    Also, her attempts of romance is clouded by her dependency.   If you want her romantic feeling to stay, her problem stays.    You forgot we are talking about a MAIN CHARACTER OF AN ANIME.     there are people who doesn't read                   You must have missed the notice<br/>    How far are you trying to go to troll, you already got us dude congrats we fell for it    Alright everyone it has come to my attention that this club is tied up in some unspeakable drama that we're all just conveniently ignoring.   That ends now.   We are going to discuss everything on our mind under the following condition:   We will speak honestly, and after all is said and done we will all remain friends.   You may deny this proposal, but if you do then I'll have no choice but to leave this club.   I will no longer allow things to go on this way, so no matter what happens things are going to change.   Make your decisions.           Why do people continue to ship 8man and Yukino if Yukino still loves Hayama?    this guy is still posting      Is it just me or does Oregairu now feel more like its Yukino's story more than anyone else's. I know this seems very narrow minded (since its largely a coming age novel) but even though Hachiman is the MC, the overall plot and interactions of the series all boil down to Yukino   Its her problems, her interactions (or lack of) with the characters that fuel the story so that the characters can grow  Hachiman has pretty much rounded out development wise I feel like (what is left for him? getting 100% over nice girls and ending up with a chick?). Yui has a little development left to go but her characterization has never been as pivotal compared to our two loner autists. Meanwhile, Yukino has to undergo the most changes since the series began and we have yet to reach her final growth. And the final volumes are (and the ending of the series) pretty much revolve her development and what she wants to do in her life       Filthy pleb, that's what yui said in the end of Vol 11. 8man consider that's a LIE! not GENUINE, and he CRIED. Learn some moonrunes      Remember she's playing the "tyrant", so even if she said that to Yukino, she might be suffering a hell inside of her for saying it to her own sister. It's like anon said too, she's watching her sister wasting the chance Haruno never had.  To the other anon asking how I "fixed" her, I didn't. She fixed herself. I only gave her a huge push after forcing her to remove her mask and telling everything I thought and then walked away. Next day she opened up with me. It's a process, like a damn rehab.      Why do people continue to ship Yui with 8man when Yui still loves cookie man?   I can't wait for Irohafags to get BTFO so they finally shut up like Yuifags.  It'll be like OreImo all over again.  Ayase best girl ;_;     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127121196  Nobody has feelings for 8man, he's creepy. Happy?      I will post too      I agree, her past and her relationship with hayama, her mother and haruno are still a mystery.     Are you kidding me. Yui gave 8man a bag of cookie in Vol11.  But 8man call that some kind of "payback gift" and she's nearly going to cry.      Just because people get BTFO doesn't mean they shut up.   Great taste.   I preferred Manami though.        Because she is the main heroine obviously. She needs to be taken care of by EVERYONE.    I was actually okay with the Oreimo end.  Kyousuke admitted he was fucking up his entire life and that he was making a horrible decision. Love isn't rational so admitting that is really all it takes.       yukino   growth or character development  All she does is copying other people. She herself didn't change at all. Her "drama" is bullshit too, since she's just a spoiled kid, who got bullied once. Shit character overall.       Is it just me or does Oregairu now feel more like its Yukino's story more than anyone else's  That's the main point.  It's about a high school Batman saving someone. Everything that happened to him in the past is to prepare him mentally so that he could save her.   That someone is our Ice Queen.        Good Irohasu, everyone!   I thought Manami was alright in the anime but LNfags told me she was literally Satan himself and the reason for all evil in the universe.     liking yuckyno   liking oreimo      The problem was that he rejected all other girls just to fuck his sister once.     Spent most of his time saving the independency autism.   While non-stop flirting with his kouhai.   NTR queen        Ice Queen  More like cold fish.     You got meme'd m9    In love with the dead fish.     Neptuniafag   Shitting on OreImo       once   he really believes this       Even as someone who likes Yukino the most, I am telling you right now that vol 11 slammed the door on Hachiman swooping in wearing the bat suit and saving Yukino. He has explicitly rejected it.  That isn't to say he won't provide peripheral help to her, through emotional support or advice or whatever, but Yukino is going to be the one to stand up for herself. It absolutely has to happen. Or else we're really going to get a 'sour grapes' ending.        saving a picture means watching shit show  Kill yourself oreimoshitter.     It's Vol11 m8, learn some moonrunes, and your meme is trash now.    Not sure if falseflagging or just a retarded yukinofag    And he recognized that he was alienating himself from the others. He still valued it higher than everything else.  Of course it's implied he went on to have a secret relationship with her but he never could have known that would have worked when he started. He took the philosophy of "The flame that burns half as long burns twice as bright"        lol u a troll   That level of delusion.      Do you think Yukino is good at sex?    booty blasted worstgirl fag     Bad on day 1. You'll be cumming faster than her on day 3.     Probably a dead fish first, but then warms up and ends up going at it like a rabbit.  Perfect for 8man       No. For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  Although for some reason I feel her 'stamina' issue is psychological somehow.       Yeah this is true. But he is going to "save" her not doing the hard work for her. He'll probably become to Yukino what Hiratsuka is for him, someone that cares deeply for the other person and gives advice/wisdom  Ultimately, after Yukino tells the other two what her problems are and listening to what the other two (mostly Hachiman think), she'll do what she wants to do and not copy/shadow anyone      Oh great, as if being autistic wasn't enough    She's a virgin, of course not.  Sensei on the other hand,       I was referring to the "8man != cookie man" meme in case you missed it     Damn, that was cute.    You got it backwards. Yukino is not a virgin, while Hiratsuka is still a maiden.    Like a dead fish.    I can't believe you're arguing about the virginity of a 30-something bombshell desperate for marriage. It's not a bad thing that she's experienced you know. It means more fun, few nights cut short.     She was a great character but...     perfect for a man with dead fish eyes.    You are retarded if you think Hiratsuka would spread her legs in desperation.    fewer*    Why does everyone say this as an expression for bad sex. I bet you haven't even had sex with a dead fish.    8man fucks a panda infront of yukino   Yukino gets fucked by the panda   Happy end       you will never marry a hot obsessive sensei      8man fucks a 8man fucking Yukino     people change a lot after go through university. And saying sensei sill a virgin is just ridiculous. She must have serious problems if it's true.  It's a different case with Haruno when she isn't allowed to be in a relationship though.     Reminder that Yukino and Hiratsuka are as pure as snow.   The Aristocrats.    Isn't 8man the panda? So he's fucking himself then the himself he fucked fucks Yukino?     not posting the superior webm version     She's amazing at it.    It can happen.    Does that mean he's getting cucked by the himself that he fucked?    Yahari has the  DEEPEST LORE     Hachiman would suck in bed so they go perfectly together     No best version     Who would have the most sexual chemistry? 8man and Yukino, Iroha or Yui?     Iroha has blown Tobe more times than I can count.    Iroha is for sex Yui is for cuddling Yukino is for cuddling Pan-san      Girls don't need stamina to have good sex    Yukino or Iroha Dead fish and dead fish eyes synergy vs. experienced in sex Yui is too dumb to have sex correctly      Karen replaces Yui in the Service Club, how does the series change?   Guys I kinda liked first season besides the episode where the shitty bitch cried on stage in front of the entire school. Is the second season even worth picking up or does it become Oreimo S2 tier waifu wars?     For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  I don't get this logic. Do people suddenly drop dead after feeling worn out from running? That's basically what you're saying here.     8man fuck hayama infront of yumiko   yumiko fuck yuis dog infront of yukinos car      No. For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  Why does everyone assume you just stop going after she's tired?     They didn't read the doujin where even when she ran out of stamina she could still do something  Kinda shows how much these kids know about sex       What?    This is worse. This has /pol/ level hate.         Best ending    You don't need to read a doujin to know that you don't stop functioning as soon as your stamina bar depletes to 0 which is what every faggot with their dead fish meme is apparently advocating here.     too dumb to sex  right, because fucking like an animal requires a literary bent.      Yahallo no more.   Ain't gonna watch it.     Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?    118 / 29 / 39   You guys need to calm down.         Eh? They both like Hikitani-kun!?      NTRing Yumiko  What kind of a sick fuck would do that to such a kind girl?     hnnnnggggggg IROHA OR DEATH     She gets to NTR Yukino's car so it's ok     This has /pol/ level hate  What does that mean?      She must have serious problems if it's true.  No shit? she's still unmarried.    So what do you guys think is Yukimom and Yukino's disagreement/conflict?  1. Yukino studying abroad 2. arranged marriage with Hayato 3. stop education and be a "perfect bride" 4. they don't want Yukino to have a cat 5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  Also, who will reveal it? Hayato? Haruno? Yukino?            Nice, Hikitani-kun! Two hot chicks are after you, lucky dog.     He must be a bit new around these parts    Don't ask, you don't want to start another nuclear bomb shitposting    Still better than waifu wars.    Probably going to same college and following same career path as Haruno.    That's pretty normal for a general. Several threads ago we hit bump limit with only 98 posters.    Yui isn't capable of boiling water, what makes you think she's capable of having sex correctly?    Yukino will be studying abroad, she's in the International Curriculum.     1. Yukino studying abroad  cop out  2. arranged marriage with Hayato  will come out of nowhere and cause unnecessary drama and this LN will continue for 5 more novels  3. stop education and be a "perfect bride"  unrealistic and stupid  4. they don't want Yukino to have a cat  realistic  5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  she wouldn't dare                5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  They say she has schizophrenic delusions because of Pan-san, but she knows what she saw that night.     Why is Yukimom so daft? Does she not realize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses? Likes and dislikes? She should find out what Yukino is actually capable of, what she is suited to do, before trying to control her life.  Once you figure out what her talents are and where they can be best be applied, then you can begin engineering her future and convincing her that it's "what she always wanted to do."        But if its about her career? What do they want for her? Be a politician? And also, why would she disagree to this to the point of moving out?      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;2 . arranged marriage with Hayato  will come out of nowhere and cause unnecessary drama and this LN will continue for 5 more novels  Hallo, I'm WW Thank you for your idea, now I can pay Eguchi a trip to Thailand       I think it was mentioned at some point that Yukimom wanted Yukinon to study science like Haruno? This would separate her from her friends so I can see where the disagreement comes from.    Given all the flags we've gotten, I definitely think Yukino is going abroad by the time the series ends  Currently, she is on the same path as Hachi/Yui and before she was just following Haruno's science track. But by going abroad (since shes in international curriculum) she is going down her own path and not copying/chasing anyone. It makes the most sense given what we know  She leaves either in Year 3 (end of the series most likely) or some timeskip ending where she studies in an overseas college        From what I've gathered skimming the LNs, Yukimom wants both her daughters to pursue science majors in college, probably so they can become doctors.  It's just typical Tiger Mom shit. I think Yukimom is actually smart and playing the long con on Yukino, convincing her that the rebellious thing for Yukino to do would be to become a prestigious lawyer.  It's all part of the keikaku.       Now that's alpha.   Certainly fits in with the larger theme of Yukino wanting to escape the shadow of Haruno.   There was some faggotry about Hachiman rejecting Iroha last thread. Is there some truth to it?    My fetish is when a low stamina girl is all tired out but the guy just keeps fucking her because she's too exhausted to make him stop and he just keeps doing it until she's cum like a dozen times and is just a quivering mess lying in a puddle of her own fluids.      B-but that's not possible! You are a guy!      yfw 8man could have done this in the infirmary but didn't because he wasn't assertive enough     What do you think? Just your usual damage control    It's just over-enthusiastic people reading way too much into the writing. If he was gonna reject her it would definitely be way more pronounced and you would know when it happened.     Why would he? Iroha has no feelings for 8man!    He responded to her in a way that was not genuine. Make your own judgement    Is it wrong want to kill a cunt?     That's it? And why doctors? They are a family of politicians right?     Yukino   friends             Yukimom wants both her daughters to pursue science majors in college  Chapter?    YAHALLO  Why is she wearing ropes under her clothes? Is she a pervert?  Now that 8man told Yui to be genuine with her feelings and for Yukino to do things for herself what is to stop a love triangle from forming?    Actually, I want to add another entry:  6. Yukimom wants Yukino to go to a better school but she chose Sobu because  Hayato was there.   Also, about the arranged marriage thing. There are some points that I could support it:   Haruno doesn't want Yukino to get married to Hayato, so she ships her to 8man   8man's monologue of rich people marrying their children for family ties   Yukino gets depressed when she mentioned her mom wants a lasting relationship with the Hayama family              Not that anon but you can reason it out  Vol 6 during fireworks Haruno learned from Yui that Yukinon was going science track and she seemed upset by that (following footsteps). Vol 11 when Yukimom learns that Yuki is going on the lib arts path she starts going on about she is worried about whether Yukino is going on the right path for her future  We also know from Vol 10 that her career path ties in directly with Hayama's. Hayama as we know is going lib arts when he told Hachiman during the marathon. And Yuki even said to Yui/Hachiman that their mother wants a lasting relationship between the two families and one such way was to have both Hayama and Yukino go on different career tracks  That's my best guess and its also why I think Yukino is ultimately going to go abroad when the series is over          She's a slut.    Oh my.     over-enthusiastic people  you spelt denialfags wrong though.     Yukino's feelings for Hayama.     That's why it's trash now, Outdated meme, you live under a rock?     It's probably a fancy camisole.     Yukino   friends  Epic.       I've never known the touch of a woman since leaving my mother's breast  ftfy      Isn't she out of the house before the three even met?     Haruno could have just been disappointed about Yukino copying her choice. And I think Yukinomom would have reacted like that regardless of what she said.     implying that a girl who put on a dog collar without hesitation when given one isn't into kink   implying that if she win she's not gonna have genuine BDSM sessions with 8man      Yui probably. 8man doesn't seem the proactive type at all, so a lover who will just climb all the hell up on him and not quit until they're both sore is going to be the best bet.  Iroha comes in second because she'd be able to tease him into action eventually. With Yukino I just can't see the two of them having a super-active sex life, but by the same token I doubt it'll bother them much either.     I'm just here to say how much I love yumiko    チーン　チーン   Subtle.      based ponkan    How correct should it be when she's about to unleash her 2+ years of sexual frustration on the 8inch?    In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago. But it's just some fancy bra with extra support for her Yuis.     Why does she look like Honk?     Thank you for your idea, now I can pay Eguchi a trip to Thailand   implying WataWata would want to ruin his beloved's perfect body   You're dumber than a denialfag.        normal shirts behaving like latex bodysuits  Gets me everytime     8man fucks komachi infront of taishi   taishi fucks kamakura infront of yukino     8man's reaction to the spoon exchange can be read as a tacit rejection on his part, yes. At the very least it's more plausible than the assertion that 8man was intentionally making a pass at her.       anon fucks logic infront of other posters      yfw, originally WW used childhood promise with key + locket to bind the main trio together.   Then he switched to suicidal dog because Komi knocked his front door.     Iroha is not even a virgin. Why do people like her_   Don't know about sex, but damn the teasing would be NNNGGGHHHH   IROHA OR DEATH btw         In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago.   o u        a cat is fine too     Exactly. Just take one look at the outfit she was wearing for their shopping date; she may as well hang a sign around her neck that says "collar me, train me, make me your breeding bitch"   And that's reason #88 why she's Best Girl      SORE ARU!    I already ate Sensei's hymen, along with virtually 80% of Japan's virgins.     You can buy genuine woman's hymen in Japan?    Stop smelling paint anon    Sorry but dumb sluts like Yui need to be bred by middleaged men, not schoolboys.     Frankly, I have no idea. But despite that, she looked exactly like your typical high school girl. I’ve seen her type around a lot – a flamboyant girl revelling in her youth. Short skirt, three buttons of her blouse popped, hair dyed light brown, and a quick glance at her chest revealed a large heart charm on a gleaming necklace. It was an outfit that completely defied the school code.      I can't unsee Yui now, wanting to be tied up in a tortoise knots.      In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago.   Oh boy, I think I got spoilered already   7-year-old Yui playing alone in the park because she had no friends   There was a child there who played baseball alone   She decided to talk to that child and became interested in him   His name was difficult to remember so she gave him a nickname   One day the child gave her a pendant as birthday present   She was embarassed, couldn't find the words and instead brushed it off by calling him kimoi   She realized his eyes and expression suddenly changed   Since that day, that child never came back to the park   10 years later, his suicide dog ran in front of a limo   Someone jumped to save her dog   She saw that student's ID   "Hikitani? Hikigaya?"    The same rotten eyes she saw the day she called him kimoi   She started sobbing   "Hi...kki..."                       Haruno. You don't even have to like her to admit this.    This. For fucks sake, she's fucking hot damn it.    pls no pendants and childhood memories pls no nisekoi pls no pls       Sorry anon, I just don't think she'd be that into you.   I'd murder Watari if he pulled something like this.   That said if it were a much less serious series I'd eat that shit up          8man fuck yui infront of yukino   yuis dog fuck kamakura infront of yukino     Well played    Nisekoifags can grab the pendant and shove it up your asses and use the key to lock your Irohanus.     his suicide dog   his   youtried/10       Literal and figurative sex goddess.     had no friends   *was being shunned by her friends      Damn right! May you live long anon     I'm suddenly getting flashbacks of the dog NTR doujin.    Imagine the amount of sonnets without Yui   How does it feel to be cucked by dogs?     It's like a knot in your guts.     Try it and write us a 100 word long essay on it    Wrong pic.     100 words  nigga, what? That's way too much.     She still hasn't apologized about it yet. Still hasn't thanked hikki for saving her dog.     a reminder for those that didn't read the LN about how much you're missing in this chapter, the service club play a strip card game    What is 8man showing us, /a/?   It's a blank paper. Are you retarded?    What's with the body proportions?    Sure anon. And Iroha rapes Hayama with the tea set while Miura makes good use of the vibration feature of cellphones.      the three idiots colluded to make the two girls strip   All you had to do was to lose the motherfucking game 8man.       8man did lose the game, as a scapegoat for chuuni to win    Yukinoshit haven't even mentioned that it was her car that hit her. Although it was 8man and stupid dog's fault.    I haven't re-read that volume since the first time I read it. It still feels like it belongs in some other series.    Because it's a dick move. It might mean you get to look but it's gonna blow your shot at getting to touch.    hit him*    Did she give birth to a truck or something?     What? They where partners in the game.    Few in number, yet we stand tall brothers.   see   and the image i replied to. that's not fan art, it's from the official LN. for what reason did u think yukinoshita stripped in front of the almost nude 8man?       This explains why is she still virgin and her love for 8man isn't just because of guilt but something more  genuine , childhood friend  yandere  love     Basically he's taking the damage (stripping) for the team knowing his bad luck, the ploy was rather proudly announced after chuuni and 8man won. Pic related, smug witty bastards.      "p-please.. let me rest a littl- AAAAAAAAhn&lt;3"      not boning Rui instead  Dropped fucking hard.    I actually thought he was going to end up with Rui, shit manga   Wait wait wait,  He just saved the imouto from rape... Then bones older one?     but he is anon, having sex this early on a drama series is a break-up deathflag    By that logic, he will ended up with shitsei rather than Rui.    He already did Rui, so he got bored and moved on.   I want to get off this ride already  hehe now they are pole sisters too  Fucking a girl who is simultaneously older/your stepsister/teacher is pretty hot. Stop hating on MC.   fucked both his step sisters already   What next? Fuck his step mom?     NBR  Dropped.    So ?    See you next week, anon.  Don't forget to make a Fuuka thread as well.     Nice blog faggot, why don't you tell us other manga you dropped so we can subscribe?     What next? Fuck his step mom?  Someone call MSTP, we need him       Liking borderline incest      I love this development.     boning the slut who goes after married men   drop pure sister     I'm so glad I dropped this manga. I can't stand seeing Rui getting shit on so much.  KEEEEIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIIIIIII</wbr>  Raging about Seo &amp; Kei once a week again makes me feel a lot better.    having sex this early on a drama series is a break-up deathflag  Which means Rui end never.    But anon, he had to fuck her at least once or I would be mad.  I thought this was a weekly manga. Are scanlations just slow as fuck?   True suffering.    Long hair &gt;&gt;&gt; short hair   This is SHIT, im done fuck kei and this shitty manga   Time to fap.    Kei just can't into sex. Her characters always look extremely uncomfortable.     that pic   RUIned   heh       Fuck yeah. See you next chapter faggot.   Is Gunma still active? 3 girls sharing 1 guy, right up his alley.   where are the nipples???    In the tank.    Did you make a typo or just abbreviate No Based Rui?     finally boning sensei  picked the fuck up     Get a load of this faggot   MC:sorry rui, sensei have sexy nice body, big tits, nice ass, long hair, less autis...the only one u have is your virginity, but i already taste that!   MC not wrong     New girl when? Shit is getting stale.  Damn this dude is a player...he fucked both sisters   I wonder how he does it? Is it his genetic Chad aura?    Sasuga Kei will never get an adaption   Rui sex was great.   The problem isn't that he had sex with Hina, but that he's never come clean with her about Rui.  That's going to bite him in the ass. You'd have to tread very carefully there even if they were just friends, but they are sisters. He's set up a landmine under himself.     It wouldn't be an issue if he just stuck with best girl anyway.    Who the fuck is scanning this now? It says Norway on Batoto, but aren't they just a part of Cafe Lenin?    There is a difference between first-page sex and mid-story sex. After all these years do you still not have the timing of these things worked out?    I hope he ends up with Rui  The fact that Shuu keeps being brought up so often tells me that the older sister is going to end up with him back again   Hina NTRs MC with Shuu   MC finds out   depressed   Rui is there for him   MC starts developing feelings for Rui   That or Rui will date someone else and MC will uncover his feelings towards Rui the hard way  I hope he gets NTRd twice               mix in 1 or 2 new girls and you got your story     I hope he gets NTRd twice   never change /a/        There already is a new girl by the end of this chapter. He goes to Hina's apartment and hugs the person opening the door thinking it's Hina but it turns out to be her blonde friend from college...and she's naked.       other girls are completely irrelevant   add new girls  What a terrible harem.      Hentai taught me that it's okay if they're sisters.   But want about Alex? There better be NTR later.   When are we going to see MC with his bed head again. It was the only thing I liked about him.   He's just there to eventually be rejected by Rui and then thrown to slut-chan as consolation prize. Which ironically might be better than clinging to Rui.     What's wrong with you plebs? Natsuo and Hina were super romantic. Fireworks, cheap tacky ring and all. Plus, Natsuo has loved Hina ever since the manga started.   Rui has aspergers and she's a slut.       Sasuga Sasuga.    I never really got how quickly sensei switched over to Natsuo. Like she seemed so adamant about keeping their relationship separate and then all of sudden, boom. I loved you the whole time or something. I don't know. Maybe i read it wrong. But still. I can't resist Rui's retard charm    I think there has always been chemistry between the two, but Hina has been hung up on the guilt she felt for allowing herself to fawn over a married man. She didn't want to "be selfish" and fall in love with a man she really shouldn't be in love with again. That being said, do we even understand why Natsuo loves Hina?    Natsuo and Hina's relationship is pretty poorly written. They're in love because the manga says so, basically    Not really. Natsuo is in love with Hina because of his daily interactions at school since Hina is his teacher. Hina is most likely using Natsuo as a rebound after breaking up with the married guy which will inevitably be an ark sooner or later.    Underrated post.

I'm amazed that she is the only oboe and there is no drama based on her. She practically keeps the band together.     The second novel says otherwise     and there is no drama based on her  next season     I just can't see this girl with cold, dead eyes having any energy left in her to create drama.     Oboe chan has a solo part a solo part in Crescent Moon Dance, and probably has one in Providence of the Wind. Since the next episode is literally the music episode, they'll probably give her direct screen focus for when she plays.

Although the regular anime preview charts work as a decent quick look at the season, they don't tell you all the information you need to know. Obviously a lot of this information is readily available if you look for it, but most people are understandably lazy when it comes to getting all the info on every single one of the 30+ anime coming out, so I've done it for you.

FUCKING FINALLY     Get yo ass moving, we've been waiting way too many months.    On it right now.        27 WHOLE PAGES FOR A HISTORIE CHAPTER. THANK GOD.        28 pages of Historie  That's 28 pages of Sangokushi you could be translating      Hox, what do you think about Ad Astra?            Dude, I just finished up v48 a couple hours ago.    I skimmed the first volume long time ago, and I frankly don't think the mangaka's skilled enough (understandable though, since it's his first real serialization).

This is going to be great.        Cool, a new Igarashi series.     I hardly see Tsutomu mentioned, and sports manga never get enough love, so I skipped it. I'll zip it and put it in the Mediafire folder. I might try to make it a habit to extract new series/oneshots if I remember, so that people aren't having to download 1gb mag rips. I used to do that in the beginning, but it's a pain in the ass.    For anyone that cares, I'll dump the translations for the new Historie and VS in 6 or 8 hours from now.     Thanks    Thanks man, I appreciate it.         The ebook rips might be around 600mb instead if the bloat/artifacts were removed, but I've no idea how to do that. Maybe the artifacts show up as bright green, and can be removed without damaging the art.              Jesus, this looks great.          Does it have anything to do with Umwelt?      Probably. Someone might've already answered that, but I don't remember.                    I'll extract c01 of this and upload it to the folder.

No, you're wrong. Overly literal translations are terrible.  That would be the same as translating ヤンキー as "american" or "yankee" rather than "bad boy" "delinquent" and similar. There are many other examples. The purpose of translation is to translate meaning, not words.

Bitch should be slut unless you want to go for TL notes and it's not worth it unless it's in the title or something.  "You bitch" is different from "you slut", bitch in English also implies asshole or wuss.       Bitch should be slut unless you want to go for TL notes and it's not worth it unless it's in the title or something.   Taking translating as something absolute in all cases is stupid. It's all about the context, you could/should use slut in a lot of the cases but you can't just say it should always be done. Sometimes bitch is the correct answer (she's my bitch, bitch in heat).      does anyone know if Morino Kasumi is a new artist? because HOLY SHIT is their work good.

Is this the Kim person everyone keeps talking about? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8yc<wbr>QKh12bKo</wbr>  [ ]   No, it's his daughter.   What do you guys think of doing RTK with Japanese keywords instead of English keywords? https://sites.google.com/site/wrigh<wbr>tak2/afterrtk1</wbr>   I actually like this idea.   Believe in yourself! You CAN learn Japanese! You might not know a lot today but one day you will become fluent! Go study and ganbatte!   Why would you lie to me    I'm with . You're likely to succeed if you try!  As long as you never give up and you keep trying, you'll make it no matter what. Don't let that smug bitch Dekinai-chan be right!      He wasn't talking with you, stop butting into our conversation      I like this new meme! Lets name it      Yuuki Yuuna will learn Japanese!    His card design is horrible, but the idea itself isn't bad.  English is way to limited for studying Japanese. Even in Core10k you can find lots of Japanese words that use the same English keyword even tho their Japanese meanings differ quite a bit from each other.  For example: 会う = 遭う = to meet           For example:   会う = 遭う = to meet   Yeah those are radically different.       Why is my monitor suddenly refreshing at 50Hz?     Up since yesterday Study Japanese all day あんきはいいです     why is a kid with a shit tier membrane keyboard fucking with my monitor refresh rate?    I-I'm sorry anon-kun   I loved this show.   I'm going to laugh my ass off if this "revolutionary" idea takes off, when in reality it's just a poor copy of KD.  Seriously, why not just use KD?      So did your problem get resolved?     there are people here who haven't overclocked their monitor to 72hz  I can't think of anything more impossibly stupid.  Know those lag frames you get during panning, because 24fps footage is converted to 60fps by just extending the time frames are displayed for? Yeah, those are a thing of the past.  The ideal is a 144hz monitor, but most cheap 60hz ones can be overclocked.         But KD is itself a poor copy of RTK    Why so static?   As someone who uses KD, I have no idea what you're talking about.       Don't most 144hz monitors have inferior colors? Or is that not true anymore?    *improved    Bad joke.   This idea is literally just "oh shit, learning an English keyword wasn't the best idea for long term retention, so lets change everything to Japanese". Instead of just remembering both, like any sane person would.       Croikey m8! Imma hip hop on muh kangaroo that I learnt ta ride and have a spot o' tea while'a playin' mah didgeridoo with some fish an' chips, m8!      It's the same thing as RTK with some asshole cursing a lot. It's sloppy and most of the "mnemonics" are just retarded.      Ah, gotcha. I trained myself to ignore the KD mnemonics and most of the English keywords after a while and just focused on learning all the readings and Jukugo.    It's the same thing as RTK... except for teaching you readings and actual words.  But yeah, if you ignore the whole reason for using it, it's just the same!      Why did she do that, cute girls shouldnt do that anon    Decide to take a class/use Genki even when /a/ told me it was slow   Feel pretty good about my pace, even though I didn't do my reps very often   Some other anon says he's been practicing the same amount of time as me, and has started reading VNs with little help   Decide to start reading Yotsuba   Can barely understand anything   Give up after chapter 2   Tell me the truth /a/, can I learn Japanese?          tfw I understand my favorite untranslated H-manga a little more every time I reread it   Someday I'll figure out the whole story.     I read all of yotsuba before even starting studying properly, just watched tons of anime     Comic LO is a solid read with it's 450 pages each month.    Yes, you can!   didn't do my reps  oh.. never mind.         You just made a mistake, anon. You can do it if you keep trying and really believe in yourself!    I read one chapter of Yotsuba and decided it was too easy for me then started on VNs. I watched anime for years for I started studying Japanese.     Is it an new meme? Cause I love it already.       new      new   At least we have that positive Yuuki Yuuna thing in that last few threads. That's a nice new meme.       new   meme   implying I didn't learn Japanese from anime  Are you jelly I didn't have to put effort into learning Japanese?       Nah, there are cases where watching anime for years help you greatly with grammar and vocab. At that point you just get the kana down and grind kanji and watch as everything magically connects and starts making sense. And then you start reading and reinforce shit you already know while learning new stuff.     I've started doing my reps now, but I'm not sure how many cards I should study daily.  I'm doing the default 20 now, but I heard other anons saying their range is from 10 daily to 60 daily. What's the optimal sweet spot between retention and volume of new cards?   What ever happened to the guy who did 1000 cards in one day?           He fried his brain probably.    Do whatever you feel comfortable with. You see people doing 50-100 new cards a day because they are the ones more familiar with the Kanji, and they pretty much come across a lot new words made up of Kanji they already know the readings to, so they just blaze through it.    As much as is possible. For me it's just a matter of how much time I can spare.    Seriously tho, watching Anime is an excellent listening practice for beginners.   Do as many new cards as you can fit in your schedule. 1 new card roughly equals 5 reps on the following day. You can probably add 100 new cards in the beginning without worrying too much about the rep backlash.       If you're efficient and have at least 2 hours you're willing to dedicate to anki, then you can easily do 50~70 cards a day with a 90% or higher retention rate.  The key is to separate new cards from review and to do a custom (cram) study of forgotten cards before going to sleep.  Also, be sure to calculate how many cards you want to learn. 20 x 365 is only 7300, and you'll need at LEAST 20k to get really comfortable with vocabulary. That means 3 years of anki - Unless you want to step up the pace of course.       へのへのもへじ    cram  triggered     Is there a problem with what I said?   I do 36. Don't think it matters as long as you do them daily.   I have a feeling we discussed this already in an earlier thread.    I hope you don't mean arguing that it's more efficient to learn new words with the short amount of time you spend reviewing forgotten words. It increases your retention rate and lets you cruise by words faster for the next day, and takes hardly any time (usually under 10 minutes for me).    So we meet again anon with differing opinion. I might give cramming forgotten cards another chance, but for now I stand by my opinion that learning new cards is a more effective use of spare time than effectively cheating Ankis algorithm with additional reps.      If you have a lot of forgotten cards, it's best to take a bunch at once (like 15-30 or so) and take it as a new session on it's own.   If you're forgetting them, you haven't made strong enough associations with those words. Get better mnemonics or make more connections with other words or mental images. Or just grind the shit out of them but that'll take more than one session.       That's a different anon you're talking to, by the way. I'm the one from the last thread you were talking to. Using cram (especially to review new cards you had issues with and will forget by the next day anyways) isn't that rare here.    I even cram cards that I already know but with not so obvious readings just so I don't forget them like every month just for good measure.      I do 150~250 reps a day, so forgetting more than 10 cards is a very rare occurrence for me. Maybe my pace is just too slow to understand the value of cramming forgotten cards then?  I think it makes little sense to review 10 cards on the same day I forgot/relearned them. Of course I'll get them right. Maybe I'll even get them right the next day because they are still somewhat fresh in my head. That goes somewhat against Anki because I'm more likely to rate the card differently than I actually should.       I was reading a light novel and saw this kanji inserted as an image (the LN was an awz3).  It had furigana and I was able to figure out it was 靭 but why would they do this to change one stroke?     Welcome to gay fonts.     I completely disagree. I have a 60% correct rate, so I cram forgotten cards every night, and I usually only end up getting half of those right again. It takes me a lot more repetition than Anki thinks I need to remember a card.     I pretty much just do "cards forgotten in the last day". It's especially helpful because it shows new cards that you hit "again" on, since if I hit again there, it's extremely unlikely that I'll remember it the next day.   I usually have around 80-85% correct after I'm done with reviews, so getting getting under 10 wrong with 200 reviews pretty much never happens for me, even with adding an extra step to new cards and doing cram; without cram and the extra step it's much worse. I've always had fairly bad memory, so I have a bunch of leeches, I pretty much always hit hard for the first 2-3 repetitions of each word since I'm pretty much guaranteed to forget it when it increases the time gap that fast hitting good.  For me it's mostly useful for the new cards and those words that I forget over and over for several days in a row since I'd forget most of them by the next day anyways. It just speeds up the process a bit since I'm more likely to not only remember them the next day, but also remember it 2-3 days after that. Also makes reviews feel less frustrating since most of the words I get wrong are those problem cards that I keep getting wrong and not new words.  tl;dr - If you're getting less than 10 cards wrong in 200~ reviews, then you probably won't benefit from cram study. For those of us with shit memory, it helps a lot.           tfw I haven't touched anki in more than two months.   Nothing but sweet, sweet reading.      For those of us with shit memory, it helps a lot.   Again,   If you're forgetting them, you haven't made strong enough associations with those words. Get better mnemonics or make more connections with other words or mental images.   I can't stress it enough. If you're forgetting so many, you're simply memorizing vocabulary instead of learning them. They're not phone numbers: random sequences of sounds that serve a certain purpose. They're meaningful words and if you apply meaning to them in your head via association with other words, mnemonics, mental images, or feelings/emotions, you'll get a better grip on them.  It takes a LOT longer but you learn them so much faster in the long run.            My method is I just tag cards I forget and cram them weekly for however long until I'm confident I know the card very well. If I get any wrong from that tag I add the card to a sort of "level 2" tag and cram those more frequently. I also have a tag for kanji I know I wont be seeing frequently which get a cram like every month or so. My daily reps take me less than 20 minutes a day when I'm not cramming. I just want to spend the least time I can on anki but use it effectively at the same time.    So instead of memorizing vocab I have to feel them. Got it.     If you're getting less than 10 cards wrong in 200~ reviews, then you probably won't benefit from cram study. For those of us with shit memory, it helps a lot.  It actually still helps me a lot for the really rare words.     Doesn't seem like mnemonics would help you too much when you have onomatopoeia words to deal with. The only time I really get those down is after reading a VN that tends to use a few frequently.    this gave me boner.      Onomatopoeia are basically mnemonics in and of themselves.    How would you know that this sentence is talking about a female? Are they just pulling stuff out of their arses?    Only a woman could like books.    CONTEXT BRO    Only a little girl wouldn't use any Kanji in that sentence.    I think it's supposed to be ironic, since women can't read.     They're not phone numbers: random sequences of sounds that serve a certain purpose. They're meaningful words  I don't know why you'd assume I think otherwise. I do try to create mnemonics, I do try to break down the kanji into radicals or look up the kanji and see if the meaning helps me draw a better connection to the word, and I do try to strengthen my memory of it by connecting it with other words I know, but a lot of the time I just can't remember. My bad memory doesn't just apply to Japanese, so getting 85% is amazing for me. I want to do better of course and I've been trying out different things, but it's not everyone's memory is equally as good, so some have to spend more time and effort than others to remember things.     This is only a thought but why not just let those card become leeches and concentrate on the other cards first? There is a reason this feature exists. Why force yourself instead of learning the words you can easily recall first?   You don't finish a deck by going through all the cards once after all, so there is no need to learn every card the moment you see it.      Yeah man, if I see the same card every day I just bury it. Fuck it, learn it later. It's just being an annoying pain in the ass.   bump  Has anyone used any of the decks from jalup?  I'd like to try them, but I've looked everywhere online for them and they're nowhere to be found. His prices are absolutely retarded so I'm not going to buy them on the off-chance they're really shit. Don't trust these bloggers refund policies.

I feel like I'm forgetting stuff too often considering I'm only getting 15 new cards every day and do cramming Today was especially bad. Well I really needed to fap while I was doing this so maybe that has something to do with it.  With the young cards I press good only if I remember immediately, hard if it took me some seconds or when I feel "good" gives it again in too many days. Which is kinda often        Fap and Rep hours apart. Its a known scientific fact that the desire to fap, and the after glow, reduce your learning abilities.

All the apps I've found on google are not batch converters, I can't just drag all my 30+ folders of manga into a converter and have it pop out all their PDFs sadly. I mean I guess I could, it just is kind of a pain unless I make an album for them. I guess that's what I'll have to do because I'm extremely lazy. And, because when I'm about to sleep I'd love to read a nice comfy manga on my phone. Thanks for help though anon.

I have the OCR Manga reader but I believe it wants the CBZ file format instead of a bunch of JPEGs. Anyways, thanks anon. I'll just use my image viewer app.    Yeah, normally you would convert them one by one. Why would you suddenly need 30+ manga? Also is it really all that much work? Should be 5 minutes    Well I just went into the CoR and downloaded manga that I'd already kind of known about (FMA, Yotsubato, Dragon Ball, Death Note) and so now I guess I'll convert them. Sorry to be so lazy, I appreciate the help. I didn't know if any savvier DJT posters knew of a batch converter.    Maybe there's something out there, but it would probably take more time to find it than it is to just do the manga one by one. Sorry that I couldn't be of any more help.    No it's fine! Thank you for the help, I'd rather know that there's probably not a program for what I want to do rather than search for it more. ありがとうございます！   I came across ヲタク, is there any particular reason for the ヲ or is it just for style?

Yeah my parents tried that a lot. They took me to therapy and stuff, but I just didn't go ever.    That's the problem though.   Yeah you CAN put learning to write off till later, but learning to write out kanji actually does help you to remember them better. People act as if it's a totally worthless endeavour that just takes up more time, but it does have benefits.      The worthless part is stroke order.   You should be able to reproduce radicals from memory.      On the contrary, if you know the stroke order for most radicals, you should generally be able to guess the stroke order for most characters correctly. Odd stroke orders aren't all that common.   It's really not this huge of a problem that people make it out to be. If you know the stroke order for 日 then you can guess the order for 目　月　明　門　口　品　四　etc etc pretty easily. Same thing for　寺　持　待　時 - It's just people making a mountain out of a molehill and justifying it by saying "I don't have the time" when they're ALREADY spending a lot of time on it.      It's time spent on something that will never be useful for 99% of people.    We're talking in a circle here. One of the benefits IS that you focus a little more time on it, meaning you understand the characters better and won't confuse them as easily. Especially the 寺　持　待　時 bunch from above, they trip up beginners quite frequently.   Learn it if you need it, that's really all there is to say about this topic.   A knowledge of radicals is a million times more important than stroke order there, buddy.  It doesn't really give you any more knowledge.     I never studied the radicals and the stroke order in depth. But the little that I studied helped look up words by stroke number. I don't think I'd have guessed that 日 is 4 instead of 5. And in more complex kanji this can make quite the difference.  Should I start up an Anki deck for names (in Kanji) or would that be pointless?   Unless you're already more fluent than Japanese people themselves and bored I would recommend not getting bothered with that yet.    If you're reading your first VN it's not a bad idea to add the names of the characters to anki. After that it's not a big deal though because they get pretty easy to remember.

This is what you'll see recommended here the most. - Visualizing Japanese Grammar: Doesn't cover as much as other guides, but it's pretty dynamic and helps cement confusing parts like POV much better. -A Dictionary of Japanese Grammar: It's got around 630 grammar points (across all three volumes) with related expressions and grammar notes that are so detailed (yet very concise) so that virtually not a single nuance embedded is missing. This will be your main reference for most of your studies, so learn to use it well. There's also some merit to reading through the Basic volume as all of it is pretty common and the nuance notes are invaluable as to not misunderstand the most basic stuff. The Japanese grammar aspects and appendixes before and after the books are really worth reading, as it goes into a lot of valuable of information not really treated anywhere else (sound symbolism, how to parse and understand long sentences, minute details on ellipsis and POV, etc.)         But what is the actual best method for going about this? Title dumping isn't really helpful.    yfw these threads aren't actually about helping anyone and is just about arguing        But what is the actual best method for going about this?  Do Rosetta Stone, then read DOJG front to back     Start with Tae Kim. Proceed to the DOJG. You can do the rest if you feel like it, it's like you;'re going to learn less.    it's not like you*    Congrats on spoonfeeding him pretty much exactly what is in the guide that he was too lazy to read.    Feel free to do it. I have no problems with that. If you are to autistic to just zoom out, then make a new page for people like you.    Who cares? That'll get him to shut up and stop this from turning into a 200-post argument of spoonfeeding ethics and what 4chan is or isn't.    It's not only that. You've deflected almost all feedback of the CoR, you're not maintaining shit.    What is the point of this thread otherwise?  hurr you spoonfed him the   book   answer   grammar   vocab   reading   etc  Back in my day we pulled up the bootstraps, gave the OP a firm handshake and never asked anyone any questions.            4chan is mysterious. 4chan is everlasting.    tfw the guide is so bloated and full of choices that people don't read it and they just ask in the thread because they're lazy as fuck   If we're not going to trim the guide down into a guide and move the resources list into its own thing to replace the resources pastebin, can we at least put a "recommended path" tl;dr in the guide or something so we stop getting these stupid questions that are answered in the OP?     Answering questions that aren't in the guide. Tell me, how is he going to learn Japanese if he can't even put in the effort to read the guide?     What is the point of this thread otherwise?  Asking questions about sentences you have trouble with. Or for beginners, a quesiton like "Tae Kim's explanation of X wasn't enough for me, where can I get a more detailed explanation? would be absolutely fine. Questions like "I'm lazy and haven't looked at a single resource, so tell me what I should read despite the guide also clearly saying to start with Tae Kim" are not.     We'd never get DJT to agree on a recommended path to learning.    What do you call this dumbass?    If your memory sucks have at it but otherwise some people don't need to.    This right here. Essentially the guide just dumps a huge amount of potential resources without ever really directing newcomers. Basically, it's shit.     No matter how much you "hate" going to school in the morning, no decent parents would allow anything else.   If only school was useful. You went every day and you're still a retard.      Not sure if you are just trying to make a joke or actually think school is not useful    By doing that you're also spoonfeeding idiots. Besides, I think making mistakes and trying various different paths in order to finally find what works best for you is important. If people are too dumb and lazy to persevere it's their problems, it's not like we're forcing them learning Japanese.    What most other feedback? I only didn't answer you and one other anon that wanted to change the guide, cause I'm not the one maintaining it see: "Complaints, etc. regarding current version: Seidenfisch@gmail.com"   When it comes to your scroll-autism:  I made a html site hosted on google drive: https://438ad69dab0c7397fd11303b31b<wbr>7c7f7ae12fe51.googledrive.com/host/<wbr>0B4mGzeph5PAPV3lxU0p1QjhaZlU/index.<wbr>html  And another website: http://djt-minna.co.nf/   But website hosted on Google Drive requires you to be signed in to your Google account, and free domain one seemed to give some warnings to other anons.      </wbr></wbr></wbr>            The pages are broken. If your reasoning is "fuck you, work around my incompetence", then you will be replaced. All you are doing is shitting all over the work someone else did.     But website hosted on Google Drive requires you to be signed in to your Google account  No they don't, and you didn't make shit.     don't give a shit about CoR   just relaxing during all the drama around it  feels good man     tfw no motivation to write    I think the way we're all aware of how inefficient learning languages in school is should tell you how inefficient it is in learning anything else. I'm sure I wasn't the only one here that had to sit in class bored out of his mind because the lower half couldn't keep up and needed to be coddled into doing their work.     you didn't make shit  See: https://438ad69dab0c7397fd11303b31b<wbr>7c7f7ae12fe51.googledrive.com/host/<wbr>0B4mGzeph5PAPV3lxU0p1QjhaZlU/index.<wbr>html   No they don't  try logging out of your google account and accessing it   </wbr></wbr></wbr>       3 days until he pulls it down again and another shitfest starts.  This is just みんな all over again.        should tell you how inefficient it is in learning anything else  Language learning is kind of its own thing. Nobody gives a shit about them so they don't bother to teach them well.     Incorrect. Maybe I should clarify that I'm talking about the American education system.  An education system that teaches students basic math in 9th grade.      Yeah but the thing is, it forces people to learn, though maybe inefficiently, things they wouldn't bother with otherwise. Although some people are great at math and don't really need math class to be good at it, they still need to learn grammar, history, PE, social studies, etc. If everything thought they didn't have to go to school because it's inefficient, half the people would end up illiterate, and even the "gifted" students that manages to learn much on their own would end up with gaping knowledge gaps that we take for granted today because of the school system.    If you know a better way feel free to tell me. I just think that you don't get it all too well yourself, seeing all the bullshit you wrote in feedback not even realising that the site isn't html and all you wrote was completely useless.    You didn't make that; CoR-Kun set up the djt.みんなな folder with the files already there. All you've down is downloaded from this http://www.mediafire.com/download/a<wbr>s2ji7a668a8bb5/DJT.みんな.7z and reuploaded them to your google drive while managing to fuck it up.    try logging out of your google account and accessing it  Different computer with a different network connection, empty temp and cache, nothing logged into anything and it works.     that the site isn't html  Your fault, retard. If you following the fucking instructions it would be.       </wbr>     If you know a better way feel free to tell me  Look up how to host a website in a google drive and follow the instructions we all received when downloading the 106mb odd website package. A better way was there from the start.     No. If the gifted people weren't in school they would actually enjoy learning, and would learn all kinds of stuff out of interest. School is good for socialization (home schoolers are weird) and day care.    Bullshit. Yes, they would learn things they are interested in, but not the rest and equally essential stuff. Without school we'd be back in the middle ages.     Without school we'd be back in the middle ages.  In terms of dumb people knowing nothing, yes.    But that stuff that gifted people wouldn't learn outside of school? They probably don't remember most of it too well from school either. You learn to memorize it for the test and immediately forget it afterwards, because you have no internal interest.        A better version of the Guide, for beginners, and it predates DJT.  http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.p<wbr>hp?id=5322 Comes with its own support thread with questions, answers and feedback by people willing to be honest about the process. </wbr>      Different computer with a different network connection, empty temp and cache, nothing logged into anything and it works.   You must be logged in another google account on this other computer. See pic related, also read previous threads, another people without google accounts also couldn't use the site hosted on google drive.   Already did, see<br/>          centered around RTK   no grammar discussion besides listing Tae Kim   a bunch of detail on stuff that doesn't matter (half of it is just on how to split up Core6k)  It's shit and you're dumb for thinking it's comparable        RTK   Tae Kim   Core 2k/6k  Not that different from DJT. Though it's most the most essential one: reading.       missing*     Not that different from DJT.   Not all that different than our methods, but much worse than our guide. Sure, it's more planned out"but it's not like it's a bad thing for our guide to list alternative resources, it makes it less biased   Also RTK is shit.         In terms of dumb people knowing nothing, yes.   Wait, dumb people know stuff now? Half of my country can't find itself on a map of itself.  The best use of school, like anon said earlier, is socialization and daycare. Once you're in the teen years (see: angst), school becomes useless. If you're retarded, it's better just to learn a trade and get on with making money. The smart ones will stay in school of their own volition and then school can actually be useful (somewhat). It's still better to teach people how to learn and then what to learn than it is to force mass-appeal lesson plans down their throats.       Since everyone ITT is apparently a kanji genius with kentei level 1, what kanji/kanji list do you suggest I study after the jouyou + jinmeiyo?   (If you're going to suggest sentence mining just fuck right off)     Most here are just parroting what they heard from other anons. Not much different from a circlejerk.    It would have been better if CoRくん were still handling it. The CoR and website all in the background, it worked properly; people were adding useful tools to the pot and the grammar page was being updated rapidly. He got things done instead of making up excuses.     That's all a beginner needs. The guide has a lot of useful stuff which shouldn't be in the guide but in a resources guide by itself.  What beginners need more than anything is limited distraction. Give them an extremely simple path of progression with limited resistance and they will progress like wildfire. After they have a few thousand words and worked their way through Tae Kim it is more than enough of a basis to be able to find their own feet. That guide is superior to our guide because it provides concrete steps with specified instruction.   centered around RTK  You didn't even read the first post fully. Sorry if you have a hard-on for the "DJT Way", but it isn't very useful for real beginners. Information is one thing- and it is all there and quality, but presentation is vital in something designed to "guide" people. What sort of guide shows a group of people into a room and goes "there is this, that, that over there, more behind the back; make yourself at home" and walks away? One who doesn't understand how lost complete beginners who seek these sort of guides really are.  Compare the Guide with the buyfag guide: http://buyfag.moe. After reading through that I have an urge to buy something I don't really want or need, and know exactly where to look and how to go about it. With our guide if I were a complete beginner I would have a general idea of the elements involved and have access to a bit list of tools I have no understanding of what exactly they are useful at my stage in learning.      less biased  Guides are supposed to be biased. They boil down to propaganda in the truest sense. It is a tool to get people to do certain things and follow a certain path.                  Nothing stops you from adding useful tools now, just post about them in feedback. Or from updating grammar page, just use 'newest offline download', update it and post link in feedback    They're the same anti-RTK angst teens shitposting in this thread every day. You better ignore them.     Also nothing stops you from buying a domain and making your own version of website, if the current one doesn't please you aesthetically. I wouldn't mind. Honestly, the most work was to add all the links to CoR and it's already done.    Is Slime Forest worth it? Are there people who've used it regulary or integrated it to their daily routine? (Talking about Kanji learning there obviously, not Kana.)  On the paper it sounds like a good idea but I feel like dropping it after trying it 10 minutes is a norm as I've never read any serious feedbacks concerning it.   No you don't need to pay for it.        I tried it and got more bored than when I was using Anki. Maybe it will work for you.   Should I buy new game vol 2 and upload it here, or is it really out there free online and I just haven't search enough   You mean slime forest? Did it really work for you?     3 days until he pulls it down again and another shitfest starts  I think you underestimate how little people care about this.     Have you never been here before? There's always an autist or two screaming about saving the CoR.    Seeing the last shitfest some people do care.    He's talking about the manga NEW GAME!   Wait a few minutes, I might have it.       If you tried both nyaa and Pefect Dark and it's not there, then it's safe to assume that you won't find it anywhere.       I'm back. I have two archives for the vol. 2 of NEW GAME! but they're both protected by a password and google isn't helping much. Both contain the same files and they seem legit.  I'm not really knowledgable when it comes to crack .rar passwords, so... if anyone is interested to help.        where did you found them, did the page said something about the password?   Does anyoe know what happens if all you do for months is just read/listen and not use anki at all? Im currently doing this, and read up a little on grammar every day.   Nothing, here :  http://shareraw1.blog.fc2.com/blog-<wbr>entry-1496.html</wbr>   When glancing at the files inside it seems these raws are originally from shareraw.net but I couldn't find anything over there either.       Probably learn Japanese a lot slower than those that grind anki vocab.    I've downloaded form there before, it's always the same shit, had to actually but it, for instance I did that with Chio-chan no tsuugakuro    It's a well known fact that once you stop using Anki your brain refuses to learn anything.     dammit, alright then. I just get discourage, because i keep on feeling like im learning useless vocab when I pull out an anki deck. I guess thats why /a/ adds vocab directly from the manga they read.     Aww honey, he was being sarcastic...  In all seriousness, if you want to learn just via reading it will work up until a point. Anki really shines to help you remember words that are not-so-commonly encountered: ones you see maybe once a month even if you read frequently.   If you're frustrated with your current (I'm assuming it's premade) anki deck, just delete the shit you don't like, or start your own mined deck. If the word really is important, you'll run into it again, right? Just make sure you read a variety of different formats, like newspapers, novels, manga, websites etc. about different topics or you might not have a wide vocabulary.        thanks /a/. Ill keep that in mind. But, Im someone who likes to read something with a translation on the side for reference, because even when I do know the vocab and grammar, I stillsometimes read the sentence completely wrong. So i dont know what else I can read besides manga and novels.   Forgive me for butting in here, but did most of you guys build your anki decks one by one? Is it better than downloading preexistent ones?   I tried that once, but it was too much work. I just keep a list of words I come across in games/manga/novels for now while doing Core10k.   Someone at work talked to me about Japanese today, saying that it was amazing that I passed N2 and on my own too. Discussed about Heisig, Anki, Wanikani, etc.. Feels pretty good to be the 先輩 for once.     Did you tell him that you don't actually know Japanese?      Is it possible to read a Japanese sentence like an English one? Because it keeps screwing me over that the ordering of the words aren't in the same place as English.  For example in English you'd get:  This is a car  But in Japanese you'd get:   これは車です  Which reads like:  This car it is  And it's awkward as fuck.                  Is it possible to read a Japanese sentence like an English one?    No.  The common, though vague, advice is not to translate the sentence into english, think in Japanese. That is, don't go Japanese -&gt; English -&gt; Meaning, instead go directly Japanese -&gt; Meaning        You can't learn and so on...    Alright thanks, but knowing that the meaning of the Japanese word is requires converting it into English first no?   I'll push on, I just started 2 weeks ago and I can't quit here after all that grinding and so forth.      ITT  Don't bother continuing.   They're making it illegal to be NEET and to download anything, right now.  It's over.  Time to suicide.         I'm still a bit confused about creating cards with Kanji and multiple readings as I have this urge of learning them all (readings) already. Like 上 for example. So you mean you started your decks with random vocab and [b]meaning[/b] instead of reading (onyomi/kunyomi) as the opposite side?     It's not awkward at all, you just suck at Japanese. Just give up.        Alright thanks, but knowing that the meaning of the Japanese word is requires converting it into English first no?   No. The concept of meaning transcends language. When you hear the word apple, you don't think about the word apple, you envision a fruit, it's taste, look and origin. An apple is an apple, not a bunch of letters arranged in a specific way. Thus, when you hear りんご, don't think of the word apple, think of the fruit, the concept of an apple.     Thousands of languages out there.  All languages must be the same!   what idiots think every time      whats Core10k btw?    Why would you tell me to give up? I am going to push on.    No, I actually started with KanjiDamage mostly to get a feel for Kanji and also because it was a lot of  _____fun______ . You get the most common words for every Kanji right there without having to create your own deck. This helped me personally a lot with reading and especially with looking up words.    Because you're really really stupid and it's not possible for you.    Refer to the link in OP, it's a premade deck with 10k words.    Okay I'll try that from now on.     I can't into determination  I don't know what part of "I'll push on" you don't understand. Seems learning Jap isn't all you need to be learning anon.     You can't teach a monkey algebra, no matter how determined he was in "pushing on" through his stupidity.    ?    You should read Star Wars in Japanese. Reading Japanese Yoda's lines made Japanese grammar look so easy. It just 'clicked'.    whoa, thanks for the tip bro    You can. And I am not a monkey anyways, so mute point.    George Lucas has been a weeabo for decades, no? I always thought Yoda lines were inspired by Japanese grammar structure     still arguing to some troll on anonymous imageboard instead actually studying japanese   Im so determined      I am have fun on 4chan actually.     I am have fun  nigga you can't even speak english     Fun I am having still.    Fucking reported, fuck off teenager.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DnC<wbr>1mqyAXmw</wbr>  [ ]  TPP is passing (pretty much 100% chance) today at 5:30 EST.  It's on CSPAN right now.         go to sleep grandpa     Trolling people on a Japanese Learning Thread, I don't know why you hate people for.    Why Are You Capitalizing Words For No Reason?    お爺さんお寝てなさい。      People should be banned from speaking English on a Japanese thread.    Because some words are Just Worth Capitalizing.    日本語のスレッドに日本語話ないな人が蹴出すわけ。    お前も日本語で話してないけどさー＿「ー＿ー」＿ー     they're gonna make it illegal to illegally download chinese cartoons   Aww shit, that'll complicate things.     Nobody said learning Japanese would be fun.    not enjoying the ride  Why else would you learn this useless language if you don't enjoy it?     I think it's fun    So I can enjoy my japanese media without solely relying on localizations/fan translators/anons.  Learning something is generally always more tedious than applying what you've learned.  Also finally I wasn't saying it wasn't fun but that it is, RealKana becomes a nice game after a while.         Does make me sort of curious if it'll make getting shit from nyaa much more risky than it is now, though. Especially if Japan is signing in on this.     tfw learning grammar     not thinking it's cool learning a piece of grammar and suddenly hearing it everywhere in your animu and dialogue slowly starting to click even if you don't know most of the vocab     Probably won't change much for us. If they cared enough to do more about it / thought the overseas market mattered enough to do more about it, they would've already.    tfw no time to learn jp  pls NEET god help me   How reliable is WebOCR for grabbing kanji from images? Like, say, this one    You are now unemployed and have no family Enjoy!      No idea but you should try KanjiTomo.    You'll never learn Japanese if you keep trying to fool yourself. I'm sure you have 10 minutes twice a day. That's really all you need.    I don't believe Kanjitomo works for anything but text, though.    What? I've been using KanjiTomo for reading manga for a good while now and never had problems.    Really? The description made it sound like it had to be used for selectable text. Thanks, I'll try it     Don't try to think of it like English at all, you'll just be making it worse for yourself.    I am sure you have some time to start grinding Hiragana and Katakana here and there.    An OCR that only works on selectable text? Does that make any sense at all?    thats a rhetorical question!    I never said I thought it was an OCR. Avoid rudeness `kudasai'.    Okay, here's an idea (an oversimplification, but it helps):  Adjectives? Those apply forwards. But they can be verbs, too. Adverbs? Those work the same. Subject? That still comes first. Everything else? Literally backwards.  Don't forget your case markers.           Kill yourself   English's an objectively terrible mother language to have for learning another language. The grammar is far too simple to provide a solid grasp of things like case systems and morphologically inflected words.   I love it when ESLs try and justify being taught a worthless language as children.    More importantly, it's a shitty language because you don't have to speak anything else.   Holy shit, I just finished episode 16 and this series is so fucking good. /a/ truly has major shittaste. I mean first they say that it will be a recap episode and then it's only like two minutes recap and the rest plot. We got that fucking Satsuki rape scene and the new OP is cash as hell. And cutest girl even got her on ED. This anime is truly gold, so let's discuss who best girl is and why it is Ryuko~    /a/ truly has major shittaste   But the majority of /a/ loved it, what people got tired of was the mass amount of shitposting followed with KLK. The show itself is okay, but no where near the savior of anime.     kill la kill yourself   that's pretty rich coming from a weeboo    but no where near the savior of anime.   implying we need a saviour         Congrats on your patrician taste, OP.       implying we need a saviour  You're right, Inferno Cop already saved it and Ninja Slayer is helping rebuild the damages          &gt;implying we need a savior  Well, that's what everyone was implying when it was airing, and that Kill la Kill would be it. Many were let down because they let the immense hype get to them too much.     it sucks   no it doesn't   it sucks   no it doesn't   autistic ryukofags   autistic nononfags   image dump  Saved you a thread, OP.         It sucks. You have shit tastes. Watch more anime.     Go back to your plebeian anime threads.    Exactly. All you're going to get here is shitposting, anon. /a/ loved the shit out of it when it aired, there were huge and constant threads for every little thing at all times. Now, that it's over the majority will call it shit.    what /a/ hates the most is the autistic fanbase and that it became popular in tumblr     /v/ occupation is now /a/     That's nice, OP. Because in about 2 episodes it's going to become complete and utter shit.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127080158    I feel the same way   It was a shit version of TTGL with the main theme literally being that nothing makes sense. The finale was crap,  Nui anti-climactically offs herself and is forgotten, while Senketsu dies like the writers remembered at the last minute that they promised a bittersweet ending and had to shoehorn it in . Terrible way to send off such crucial characters. Not to mention all the other plotlines that were dropped, pointless, or otherwise felt like shit was being made up as it went along.   Ryuuko being stronger than Satsuki because she had friends was such bullshit when she kept ignoring Mako and Senketsu, while Satsuki's bond with the deva's was one of the most entertaining parts of the show. Satsuki in general was a much more compelling protagonist. The show's powerlevels were all over the place; Ryuuko is on par with Satsuki by the third episode but suddenly we have to slog through club of the week bullshit for half the show. And post-timeskip everything was a mess.   It was a fun ride, but it was full of holes. On the plus side the soundtrack was fantastic, in spite of some dodgy animation it was overflowing with style, and some of the side characters were really fun to watch. I can't say I regret watching it but it's no masterpiece.      Why do people even reply to these threads? Just ignore this shit.    I come for the waifus     Satsuki in general was a much more compelling protagonist.   It was a fun ride, but it was full of holes. On the plus side the soundtrack was fantastic, in spite of some dodgy animation it was overflowing with style, and some of the side characters were really fun to watch. I can't say I regret watching it but it's no masterpiece.   Agreed   Every fucking thread. There were crossboarders around when KLK aired that's for sure, but implying they were all from /v/ is foolish.         I just finished episode 19 and I can slowly understand were the hate is coming from. Out of literally nowhere best girl turned the edge on and hated on Senketsu who she pitied like two episodes ago, literally why.   Nice blog OP, enjoy your casual pleb taste. I bet you love Clannad and K-On too.    It was good in the first 8 or so episodes, at most until episode 12.   Nothing was interesting anymore, the animation shit itself and took the fight scenes with it thanks to "lol moving still images" animation becoming too commonplace. It was a boring mess of a show at the halfway point and it didn't even redeem itself in the end.   Overall it was a good show in the first half that become less than mediocre in the second half.        You're basically on the cusp of where the show turns into useless irredeemable shit.    Don't forget to watch the part after the ED     Clannad and K-On  No I saw neither and don't plan to  yet.    Yeah Satsuki seems to have a plan, so I'm hyped   I can already taste it           She didn't pity Senketsu. She was talking about herself, but using Senketsu as a proxy. Senketsu didn't really give a fuck about fighting Life Fibers, but Ryuko hated the idea that she was being forced to fight a battle she didn't care about, like in episode 13.     Yeah Satsuki seems to have a plan     Her character gets smashed after 18 but she's still awesome     implying that was serious  You are aware that "saving anime" was a years-old meme at that point, right?      but she's still awesome     Autismo please go back to your board     Okay the cliffhanger from episode 19 was really shit, but episode 20 made up for it really really good   It's not even that /a/ hates it. It's that a vocal minority hates it or otherwise loves to shit on it and that the people who actually liked it don't feel strongly enough to post in the threads or are turned off by the constant shit-flinging around the topic that we have all come to expect.    How do you think Satsuki is going to perform with Senketsu?    see   You're missing the entire crux of Ryuko's character if you think that's what went down and why it did so.         Also, it should be mentioned that one of the drama CDs revealed that Nui had been invading Ryuko's mind and tormenting her during the entire period she was comatose.      True.    She did pity Senketsu, Senketsu said it himself, Ryuko was both using herself as a proxy and genuinely feeling bad for him.   But also to  she didn't hate Senketsu, she even says it herself she hated herself and she didn't blame him, but Senketsu is both her mirror and her counterpart so she took it out on him, which was wrong. But she does literally spill her guts apologizing to him later and they come out stronger than ever for it so it's fine isn't it?      Same situation when Code Geass and Gurren Lagann were released.   People were going batshit insane with those series back then and calling them the GOATS at that time period.  Then a few years later people start yelling that Code Geass is the biggest trainwreck in Anime history and started hating it, because trainwreck.  And with Gurren Lagann. YEARS and I mean YEARS people said it was the most casualized anime ever made. It became unanimous that everyone knew about it as much as EVA and still call it shit.  You should of seen when Madoka came out as well. Everyone made it into a meme and now everyone calls it overrated shit.  Masaki Yuasa is well liked, Shinbo is well hated, and Ikuhara is well liked.   Which makes no sense since their film styles are similar, but focused on different places. Masaki (Art and Direction), Shinbo (Art), and Ikuhara (Direction).  But people just go insane with any of these series.  And just wait until people start hating on Jojo, Berserk and HxH.   Because it already has happened.                     Why did I cry at here and at the sister part, this is just getting too cute   the fight was good even if she got rekt   yeah I'm at episode 22 and the edge was turned off, so it's pretty cool again    quality post on /a/  oh shit              the fight was good  The animation sucked. Anyway, here comes the real shit. 23 is probably the worst episode of the entire series, and the best part is that it's completely useless. You'll see why soon enough.     You can feel the love    Wow so you found something you enjoy eventhough /a/ says it's shit and instead of enjoying it like a normal person you make a Thread where you state your bullshit opinion.  How fucking autistic are you? Nobody cares if you like it or not. Go back to tumblr shithead.      Best harem    Well /a/ needed to be put into its place since people are retarded.   /a/ needs to learn to accept popular series sometimes, because there is a place for why they became popular.Because all the directors I've talked about still gets 100% hate even though they are at least the most interesting Directors around in the anime biz.  I could also add in the Director Tetsurou Araki and Imaishi, but we already know their situation.  Imaishi in /a/'s eyes is an overrated hack, but actually knows how to key frame better or equal to Bones good stuff.   And Araki is unabashedly hated universally on /a/ because he made 2 of the most popular anime series on the face of this Earth.           Anyone who considers KLK anything more than a weak 6/10 has watched less than 60 shows, this is irrefutable fact.  Anyone who defends KLK on /a/ is without a doubt completely new and mostly came here from tumblr, and again has watched less than 60 shows, this is also irrefutable fact.      don't post anime you like on /a/  Get out     let me guess: you've watched a total of 61 shows? :^)    I've watched at least 120 series in my lifetime. And KLK is at best 8/10, since it is only truly bogged down on pacing and some dumb story moments, but entertainment wise it is high up their with Imaishi's high octane action.    /a/ is not one person you fucking retard, you're not putting anyone in their place, maybe you should learn to not take everything so seriously since spouting retarded opinions without any backlash is the main appeal of 4chan.    /thread     I've watched at least 120 series in my lifetime   Sure is summer in here.     Ironic that KLK has some subtle levels of 2deep4u about some classic feminism ideas but it goes over everyone's heads because it's shonen and it seems absolutely nonsensical. I don't blame anybody though, shit is fucking whack.   dat destruction of the original life fiber   dat teamwork bringing down the transmitter   Felt like something out of Gurren Lagann  I say that in a good way        Dude. I've seen those 3x3 threads and 100% it always has the same shit everyone puts at the top.  At least 1 Imaishi show, 1-2 Hidaeki Anno shows, 1-3 Masaki shows, 1-3 Ikuhara shows, 1-3 Shinbo shows, 1-3 Butcher shows, Oshii in general, fuck ton of Ishihara shows, and 1-3 Abe Shows, Aria in general, Naoki Urasawa, 1-3 Watanabe shows, AND ALWAYS Fukumoto in the manga section.  These are so overdone and I've seen too many 3x3 that have them.  They aren't bad anime creators, but it is true that /a/ is filled with a bunch of hypocrites tha make fun of series that have these directors, writers, and manga creators 24/7.           it got better and went to space   everyone jobbed to a barrier and the transmitter was useless      Too much Gurren Lagann.   Kill la Kill was right up my alley. I didn't mind the fanservice, but Ryuko was an amazing protagonist and every fight was amazing. The first three episodes were probably some of the best episodes of anime I have ever seen.     But why does the smile chart suck so much?     ryuko truly best girl      I need to watch more shit to say something is shit   kill yoruself      Nice quads   Satsuki x Ryuuko is OTP   No.    Greatest Love Story Ever Told    It has great opening and closing episodes but the story sags towards the latter half. I think it would have improved if the whole invading other schools thing was cut out, maybe down to 20 episodes.    Oh god      I just finished episode 16 and this series is so fucking good   Funny, KLK had me hooked pretty hard around said episode (from the ending of the school raid trip along Japan to the first few episodes with everyone fighting naked, post timeskip) but it would end up dying rather quickly in the following ones. By episode 20 the show as a whole began to feel really unsatisfying for me; kept watching it to the end but turns out it ultimately failed to deliver.  Still a decent watch overall, although the last third definitely does not hold up nearly as well.        Yeah, it definitely could be a lot shorter. That was my main gripe with the series. Everything between episode 3 and 17 were pretty much unnecessary.     For KLK to have been AOTY it should have been 13 episodes only    Actually the complaints were more or less simultaneous, but that's also why they were inherently narrow-minded and irrelevant as fuck because the show ended extremely well. A lot of shows would envy having an ending half as good as that of Code Geass      Feminism  No, it just has strong female characters, not for the sake of politics, but because that's just how it should be. The big messages of KLK are about individuality (Ryuko) vs conformity (Satsuki, Ragyou, her father, Life Fibers, destiny), and the middle ground between them.  Some of the execution could have been better, but those messages were definitely there.       Gateway anime of the worst kind. New age gateway.    But KLK went downhill after Episode 14.   Just posting.  Sadly doesn't work well with three monitors.   There's some other shit. Individuality vs comformity is what you and every other person in the world thinks is the only theme of that show.      Yes? Why would anyone care about the opinion of someone who's clearly not involved in the medium he's shitposting about, stop being a fucking retard.      Don't you mean the empowerment of the female body or whatever shit that was?    You don't still believe that crap, do you?   The second half was utter shit, and not even in an entertaining way. I had to force myself to finish it.   Never did to begin with     Not Gamagoori x Mako     Meh, only the first 4 episodes did it for me. Satsuka vs Ryuko #1 was the only legit good fight in the entirety of their battles/whole show.    I only watched KLK because they're so B E S T E S T         Kill La Kill was a fun show to watch with /a/ while it was airing with a few memorable characters but not without its own problems. The pacing and resolution in the second half in particular. The ending was incredibly rushed.   It's definitely worth a watch but its not something I'll probably ever watch again.    It's babby's first anime and one of those anime that normie's claim to like to seem "legit" and "with it" like Shingeki. It's ok.  Only good thing to come out of this show   My nigga    tfw no big beautiful brown boy to love and make little moccachino children with    Why is so perfection? Is it the shark teeth?     Your taste is so shit, please die    you will never have fun in KLK threads ever again   I will never be the same again     This will never be you  JUST     Shit taste   Please die   It sure is summer.       Its her  everything        tfw no klk2 set in an alternate universe where ragyo has to save the world from her evil incestuous lesbian daughters        straight out of /v/   with 10 anime unders his bealt    he shitposts on /a/      Kill la kill is my favorite anime  the following are other shows that I have watched.  -pokemon -Yu gi oh -digimon -dragon ball z -evangelion -gurren lagan  how does me posting on /a/ make you feel?                no more electric shamisen intensifies       no naruto    no one piece   1/10 for making me reply       a man can dream    I prefer a season 2 where the crew has to go to space on the Naked Soul Space Battleship Yamato style. They go to fight the life fiber infected aliens preparing an invasion of the solar system. Ryuuko fights wearing a revealing spacesuit because she can breathe in space, and does this while slowly piecing together Senketsu before realizing the power of friendship was inside her all along, and learning to control her massive tits in 0 G. Satsuke controls the bridge of the ship while Tsumugu and Gamagoori fight off boarding parties. No less than two of the aliens will be suggestively shaped tentacle monsters. Sanageyama and Nonon get to play space fighter pilot until they unite the ships into a giant robot. Mako steals the enemy's spaceship and pilots it into a new primordial life fiber asteroid, knocking it into the sun and releasing the aliens. Everyone hugs.    muh niggu    why are satsukifags the most normal of the bunch?     KLK threads   le ebin summer boogeyman  double hue, just for you anon just for you        I like KLK and I like shitposting. does that make me a bad person?  During Ryuuko's free fall she was really just gonna hit the ground and die wasn't she? It seemed like she accepted death until that Satsuki light started flickering. I'm sure many /a/ posts were about the show ending in an orgy due to the naked pile up      tfw ragyou didn't mind control satsuki and ryuko at the same damn time *future voice* and force them to have lesbian sex with each other.    tfw   they end up breaking ragyou's mind control halfway through but the scissor sisters still eat each other out till they come      Pervert. Through there is a doujin where she does just that.    I can't post it because I'm at work, but pretend I posted the "circle of purification" diagram. You know the one.    yooo Japs read my mind and shit. I need that fam.  also I have a feeling future synced up with klk would be godlike.     meant to post to<br/>    wrong post again fuck my shit up meant<br/>    Does it end consentually?    it better    hook us up if you got it please   I hate it when people say that someone acted upon my dreams and shit and when I say can I get some of that they ignore me ;_; like my childhood man ;_;  Ragyo grows two dicks, fucks Satsuki and Ryuuko so hard they get so embrassed their goku uniforms fall off into the sea, Nui joins in pegging Ryuuko while Ragyo takes Satsuki with both life fiber cocks, the sisters pass out from the double rape and wake up in a cage a month later, the worlds dominated by clothing but neither care as they're mind broken from the dickings Ragyo gave them and go right back to double cock mom, the end as Ragyo makes them cum once more.   Nui is the same as Ryuuko yet she is treated like complete shit. It's not her fault she was raised by a batshit crazy molester.    Nui is a retarded test tube baby not even human.     She's not a monster, just a confused little girl.     Ragyo queefed on some life fibres and Nui is what grew out of it.    We got that fucking Satsuki rape scene   cutest girl even got her on ED   let's discuss who best girl is   I can already tell you are the type of person with the absolute most bottom tier of taste and judgement  Opinion invalid  KLKfags live up to their name, the show itself is mediocre and sloppy in execution            It doesn't matter how she was born, she is still has a soul.     The problem with Kill la Kill was it was too bipolar. It started off whacky and absurd but then started hashing in random bits that were way too serious for the atmosphere it started with. This combined with the off pacing made the show hard to watch if you tried to actually take it seriously and by the time the life fiber plot fully unfolded many weren't sure what to think.   Also there were a lot of parts that could've been skipped over or where neglected. Nudist beach was a mess, the field trip arc was mostly pointless, and Senketsu didn't have a good reason to die other than Trigger wanting to force a bittersweet ending.        she is still has a soul   Fuck me. You know what I mean.       She has no soul. She's a life fiber golem.     That's bullshit and you know it. She is obviously affected by how Ryuuko is able to integrate into society.       b-but it was fun! you just hate fun!       I just finished episode 16 and this series is so fucking good  Wait until you finish episode 17. The ride never ends.          late fag   probably watching dub version   not  even  once         Never fails to make me smile    You could watch 60 shitty shows and it would look like a 9/10 though. Quality over quantity man.     Implying Takarada alone makes the dub worth watching  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N26<wbr>wnyWmg5M</wbr>  [ ]       Kek la Kek   good       It's pretty amazing how this show can go from 'as good as TV anime can get' to 'an absolute fucking trainwreck' in such a short amount of time.    I truly need an anime version of this.    Anime is fukcking dying.  Nobody watches it in japan, weebs watch it in west but never pay for it.  The industry is going under, and shit like KLK and space dandy, good as they are are plummeting in favor of kawaii garbage that doesn't do well to begin with.        was a shit version of TTGL with the main theme literally being that nothing makes sense  It was TTGL about girls growing up.  A lot of it made a lot of sense if you had a realistic view and contact with females and a sex life      Scrapper shitposts across multiple boards I see.  I guess cancer spreads.     How can I marry Ryuko /a/?   You have to be a 2D sailor uniform and bleed all over her. You might have to become a star too.     so let's discuss who best girl is and why it is Ryuko~   /a/ truly has major shittaste       kill la kill was good in the first half   I love this meme.      It was very entertaining with the hype and streaming it with /a/. But there is no rewatch value, and not even something to talk about.     holy shit my brain is broken because I just smelled weed when I saw your pic even though I haven't smoked in a year.    KLK was ENJOYABLE but it wasnt GOOD or QUALITY anime    Who said anything about the first half?    0/10     Satsuki   rape scene   Thank you for giving me the impetus to finally watch it.       It's not worth it the rape scene is exaggerated.     mfw people watch KLK unironically      watching something ironically  I'm slowly getting there, I'm slowly getting  TRIGGERed  by all these autists      60 shows  That's enough for a lifetime, what the fuck is wrong with you?    OP here, just finished episode 24 and the whole Super Saiyan Ryuko fighting in space and senketsu dying-shit was really off. It felt like they never new how ro end it and wrote this shit after prodcing episode 23. But still overall watching this series was worth it, clearly a 8/10, could be better, but they just fucked up too much of it, Still the epilogue was really cute just like Satsuki's new haircut. This really wasn't half as bad as people suggest it would be in KlK threads.   Sister cuddle and scissor attack were the best parts of that lame finale.    OP, do yourself a favour and don't watch special episode '25', just take 24 as the ending even though it was lackluster.     special episode '25'  wait what? Is there more, isn't 24 the last episode?     Satsuki x Resolve is OTP, fag.    Yeah but I found it incredibly unnecessary. The shows quality is like a sin graph fluctuating all over the place, the last few episodes were around the peak but episode 25 just feels really out of place.    It's a special. Unecessary like that other anon said.       Pretty much this. A fun watch (especially with /a/) but that's it. Also below standards production values, save for one of the best Sawano's OSTs in recent years.       I just watched it and it really was unecessary, thank god that they didn't use it as a regular episode. But there's one thing triggering me  that senketsu was confirmed to be alive in space and at the same time in ryuko's heart, senketsu's death was shit-tier, but with this they made it even worse.  And pic related was a disgusting design.       Best boy and best girl still together.   bad end   It's princess tutu end, it's one step away from the good end.      *holds up spork*  it was a good retelling of TTGL from a female perspective. also, the ending was pretty solid by anime standards.    TTGL from a female perspective  I'd personally give that award to Diebuster, KLK was too ham-handed in its depiction of, well, everything.  On the other hand, it's not like TTGL was ever known for its use of nuance so I guess it is an apt comparison. I just thought Diebuster handled the more somber and morose aspects of the female perspective better. I mean, the last couple episodes were downright depressing at times.       Satsuki will never star in her own better anime  There is no justice in this shit world     field trip arc  When was that? I think I might have repressed it.     Rescue Senketsu arc    I really wish to see continuation to their sisterly love.      Scrapper has a different opinion   H-h-he most be shitposting!   Bugger off         but its not something I'll probably ever watch again.  Because you only get to watch it with /a/ once in your lifetime, and you can never go back to the past and relive that which was good.   ;_;       hahaha things will never get better and just continue to deteriorate until you finally end it    It is what it is.    I'd watch it    8/10 right off the bat, probably be a 10/10 after seeing it for myself     But the majority of /a/ loved it  Where the fuck are you idiots coming from?      Code Geass  /a/ still overwhelmingly likes Code Geass.   And with Gurren Lagann  /a/ still likes Gurren Lagann.   Madoka  /a/ still overwhelmingly likes Madoka.  I think you're a retard that doesn't have a reliable overview of the majority opinion on /a/. You see a hate thread, and several responses agreeing with the OP, and suddenly "/a/ hates X".             late 2013, early 2014 when there were multiple watch threads every Thursday    Do you remember what those threads were full of? It was a hype train. People were excited about it.   By the end, very few actually thought it was good.      Nah, people were enjoying the show for what it was. Even after, it had a reputation as a fun show. But then some autists decided it was popular and therefore terrible    I remember seeing a lot of negativity in the airing threads. It felt like a majority of the impressions were negative, too.    They were. I don't know what he's on about.    No more than normal imo. This is /a/ we're talking about, never happy with anything     /a/   enjoying  Yeah, that never happened.       /a/ is one person     Anon, it's just you, me, and the Ft. Bragg NSA botposting program. We're all there is. I thought you knew this.    It's a strong 4/10 for me    What makes it good, please explain? A decent opening, cute girls and a rape scene do not make a series good, by the way.      A decent opening, cute girls and a rape scene do not make a series good  for you      be different anon browsing thread   see this    realizes now why I could never get past the 'I'm not a robot' checkbox without help       I've seen about 340 and my rating for it shifts between a 7 and a 8?    Was getting baited a part of your plan?   This show had a lot of potential at first the beginnign episodes had good animation and the semblance of what could be a good story if put together well.  All that goes out the window around episode 12 or 13 and it becomes a shit show shoveling weeb bait into the mouths of the lowest demoninator of anime watcher mouthbreathing autist fans. The side characters become useless, and lesbian naked yelling girls are the predominant force to what in the end is the most retarded plot ending I've ever seen. The animation becomes lazy, the fights even lazier, and everyone gets stupid powerups and transformations with no thought whatsoever.  It had potential, but at the end I felt like I was duped into sticking around until the end and it was a total waste of time. You should be ashamed you're on episode 19 and still like it you retard        I was only pretending to be retarded, it was all an act  okay anon    make way for best boy  after Gama of course     You should be ashamed you're on episode 19 and still like it you retard   you should be ashamed of liking something that I don't like  Are you an actual autist? Like a legit one?      Gama might be best boy, but best MAN is unquestionably pic related    impressive resolution  and dubs     Remind me what is retarded about ? Is it the amazing repeating digits?     And now available in non-thumbnail, too!   <br/>    ruining the bane post    thinking I was the other guy   Fine then I'll just go sit in the corner        There is no shortage of shows with those three things. Its nothing new.   Mako is best girl, discuss    Godrobe   erry time      Are you some sort of idiot? Can you read that post again, maybe? There's a question and a statement in that post. The question is simple "why is Kill La Kill good?", I'm sure you understand that part. The statement is also very simple. It states that "a decent opening, cute girls and a rape scene" are not enough to consider a show "good". This ties in with the question and serves to limit the possible answers by disregarding certain points right away.           It states that "a decent opening, cute girls and a rape scene" are not enough to consider a show "good".  for you     Anon pls. I'm fucking agreeing with you, sperglord.    It's summer. What are you expecting, you fucker?    =(   It was ok but the ending was awful.    liking Imaishit ever   Confirmed garbage taste.       Using emoticons on an image board  I hate you, with all of my hate.      calling anime a medium   If something is good, it's good. If it sucks, it sucks.      It has already been 7 years, when is this summer gonna end?   Ryuuko's and Satsuki's VA's are great at screaming, Especially Ryuuka's with her final attack in the OVA.    being on /a/ while having some sort of taste  you are doing it wrong, there is a reason why people call 4chan a shithole and it's not for meme purposes     Can confirm. I loved the shit out of KlK but after the show ended and the hatebase hit fever pitch I didn't see much point in participating in the inane shitflinging.    Why hasn't anyone uploaded the BD version with dubs? That's been out for a month.    237 posts   117 poster  I'm genuinly impressed     You could say the exact same thing about the early episodes, kill la kill was never good.      Shame he's a useless cunt.       Useless   the only one to defeat life-fiber having fuckers while none of his own, including Ryuuko   one of the only fighters who doesn't rely on super powered clothing   Actually succeeds in engaging Nui alone without getting absolutely rekt   drives a cool ass motorcycle           https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=siA<wbr>biwPyccg</wbr>  [ ]   Best guy coming through  The only good thing to come from Kill la Kill was the porn,and anyone who insists otherwise is wrong.    tfw Ryuko is bi  Man she blushed a lot around this nigga while going on a date with mako and teasing Satsuki, I don't even know who the OTP is anymore     If it's so good then why is there so little porn of Disco hair turning her daughters into lesbian sluts?    Because Disco hair is the worst girl.     blushing means you're sexually attracted to someone     Because that was pretty thoroughly covered by the actual show    he was "naked" and approached her several times, making her blush everytime, which means that she saw him as someone attractive. That's simple anime logic. Why are you this autistic?    Glad you're enjoying it.      I just finished episode 16 and this series is so fucking good.  Except it isn't? Try watching more than 20 anime.    i liked it   blurays where     ok pls post the anime that you think are good and I judge your shittaste   <br/>   It's Senketsu, he's her one true love and soulmate. Ryuko's, Senketsu's, and Satsuki's seiyuus all ship it.    Boku no Pico is really good, you should check it out.    Nice punctuation and capitalization.  pls  Fuck off back to whatever shithole you came from.       &gt;what     Shit taste.    a bunch of offboarders incessantly shitposting is indicative of /a/  No you fucking moron. "I post on/a/ twice a year for some seasonal shitposting epic anime." Doesn't mean you're part of /a/. It's the same fucking thing that happened with TTGL.        I feel like you watch English dubs because "it's easier for me to follow".    You're worst girl     being this insecure of your own taste  disgusting    changing the subject, because you have even worse taste  okay.png   no because no one watches dubs since years.            Here's a pic of you    Kill la Kill is the only series where I felt exhausted watching.    My taste is superior to yours, you fuckmunchie. If you think someone's actually going to give you recs, you should fuck off back to plebbit.   just remember, kill la kill will be remembered years from now while /a/'s favorite flavor of the week harem LN adaptation garbage will be forgotten by next season.     said pic related   then prove it you liar. If you can't it only shows your insecurities and buttblasted you are about others liking anime.        unironically liking KLK  You can't make remarks on anybodys taste when you literally like eating shit. Now fuck off back to /v/ or reddit, wherever you belong.     /a/ hates it when tumblr starting to like it       pls spoonfeed me <br/>    This x100     liking something ironically  You can't make remarks on anything when you are an autist.     so you admit that you have no arguments? Nice, now fuck off from this thread with your shittaste.    Back to plebbit, cocksucker.      Fuck off already, shiteater.    she's friends with mako you tumblrite       being in a thread of a show that you don't even like to shitpost  cancer       yeah that's why they kissed and had a date     a kiss during le hallelujah makes it real  just like mako being an alien  a date  You obviously have no idea about cultures outside your own. A date in almost any country but ameriga can be hanging out with a friend, it's not romantic. Please stop grasping at straws for your shipping pair that your draw art for on your blog.       Nigga this is /a/ we hate on shit all the time.    Get the fuck out.    Special snowflake spotted     being in denial  get rekt     nice retort you sure proved me wrong with those hot opinions    yeah you sure proved me wrong with your nonsense beforehand satan     can't disprove it   falls back onto ad hominem tu quoque  nice      your post literally did not disprove the point I made in the beginning. You really have no reading comprehension, so let it go, your autism won't get you anywhere     gets proven wrong   n-no you didn't!  you sure proved me wrong again meme king        using Latin phrases to sound smart   TVVM STERCVS     KLK is an okay show, it has just reached the end of the /a/ lifecycle    thinking ad hominem and tu quoque are some super intense latin phrases only scholars use  someone confirmed for taking spanish in high school       no you said that date can stand for a normal meeting, but that's not absolute, so your opinion has no value in relation to my post that you critisized     they went shopping for clothes what a romantic date they sure are a couple!    This fatass is groping your precious Nico. What do?   Sit back and watch Roman taking Niko out bowling.    Nico isn't precious to me though. She is the worst.      fatass   I SWEAR IF I FUCKIN SEE THAT WORD ONE MORE TIME      Dimitri please.    Do nothing.    But Nozomi is indeed a fatass.   And I love her for it.      Best girls   Do you feel triggered?   Niko  the love lives were made to be cummed inside  Why is Rin so best?    You only got that half right.    Why do real girls like Love Live? I don't get it.  Let her have her...She's a used up slut now.   I let it happen.    Because you're a faggot.    Fluffy story with no boys, so they at least can pretend it isn't otaku wish fulfillment.    ask her if she wants to grope me too.    It's colorful and has happy music.  If you want a better answer, a shit ton of lesbians like Love Live.      I was in Japan last week and a group of qt Japanese schoolgirls crowded around a Love Live poster and were squealing enthusiastically about their favorite girls  Another time I was on the train and an attractive early 20's guy wearing Ray Bans and a tailored suit whipped out an iPhone (adorned with a Maki case and a Maki phone charm) from his backpack (Maki plush keychain, Maki Hello Kitty keychain).  It's so popular and all-encompassing over there. Like everyone is into it and it's socially acceptable        Ask to be with Nozomi instead.    I was gonna post that, thanks for being me anon.    Start groping Nico as well,  with my dick    I want to lick her armpit        I've always thought that Love Live was mostly for male Otaku. But even here where I live, I find that most girls love it because of the dances and dresses. I don't really care about the lesbian undertones like what  said, but its still an enjoyable show without any explicit fan service.     My sister plays the game, I don't remember if she watched the anime     a shit ton of lesbians like Love Live.  [citation needed]   Seriously, I'm curious.         the phone game?     Yeah, I don't play it because I suck at it   Help her rape Nico   Keep watching, Nico ain't precious to me. Then proceed to fuck both of them to pleasure my cock.      Like everyone is into it and it's socially acceptable  If only that was the case here     Someone on TVTropes believes Love Live (and Aikatsu) has an LGBT Fanbase.       Reminder that Maki is worst girl   Shut up, Nico. You just wanna fuck her so bad.    Maki has the worst personality, but the best body. Useful only as a human toilet or onahole   What a bunch of ugly cunts.   You just gotta git gud anon. I worked my way from being shit at easy songs to FCing flame borders.  Disclamer: it took me about eight months to FC a flameborder.    Do you guys really like shitty CG dancing? I'm genuinely curious.   I WILL HATEFUCK MAKI SO HARD    Everyone would anon. Preferably gagged so she can't be annoying    self insert     What do?  Help Nozomi.    pls  Hey guys, what's the matter, no DANKETSU?  S3 when?   I'm sorry  debu , I'm afraid I can't do that.    i follow a few on twitter. most of them live on tumblr though. go on the love live tag     It started out in a magazine for women so to say it was made for otaku is pretty mistaken.    I am marrying Honoka.    Is this what heaven looks like?      I thought it was self insertion for the guys.   Into the girls.       I'm about to start watching this (Slowpoke, I know) and I don't feel like making any decisions. Can you guys pick a favorite for me so I don't have to decide?    Thank fuck for that. What faggot, you mad your parents found out and know what a sorry useless piece of shit you are?  Go to reddit with that progressive bullshit       The fuck is this shit. Who let this faggot in    Nico, faggot     I just want help picking a favorite. Is that too much to ask?      I agree with   Nico.      But fatass is my precious  25252     All Love Lives are great really. I find picking a favorite quite difficult.   Nico        So I'm start trying to get to this idol stuff but when do this start to take off? I'm at ep 3 and it's kind of boring already. Characters is generic, I dont give a shit about the school going down, and the songs is nothing special. The only good thing is animation I guess, they move a lot and have plenty expressions too.    Nico is best love live, even if you dont like her. She'll grow all over you.    I want to rape her with a dragon dildo.    I blazed through both seasons like that as well. But then I re watched it and found new love for all the raibus.   Nico ♥   But is it more popular than Yokai Watch?    How can you "blazed through" if you find it boring. That sounds stupid. There must be something that keep you going despite all the boring stuff. Like with CG, I dig the producer and Anzu so I can endure those lame eps with the that retard cat idol.    Fuck off, A-SHIT.       Isn't Nico one of the least popular ones? Why is that?  She is pretty cute though, maybe I will go for her. I have a bit of a fetish for twintails too.         Keep watching, I digged the show right at the first few seconds with Honoka's singing so not everyone feels the same.   Watch the show for Honoka.      Ask her to go bowling.   Hey Haruka, I heard that Chihaya is dating with Honoka and they went to a love hotel yesterday. Chihaya even personally told me that Honoka has better tongue, lips, and fingers than you. Hopefully that will put you to kill yourself.     God Miku is so fucking shit.    Nico a best. BEST   Cinderella girls was boring. All the characters were cardboard cutouts. Even my favorite girl Rin.  LL S2 grew on me so that made me rewatch S1. I did have it in the background on my first run while I did work.      Schlick.    The alpaca     draw a girl alpaca   call it a boy alpaca  Why is this allowed?     Reminder that these cum dumps are all filthy attention whores.   HEY CUZ, LET'S GO SEE SOME BIG AMERICAN TITTIES!    Watch in pleasure  Nico, Maki, and Nozomi are my OT3     Who is this cummander?    she is the most popular with normies, that why most of cuckchin dont like her, but she still is one of the best lives regardless    She needs to shed her childish twintails and grow into an elegant long haired young lady    she's a fucking fatass, just accept it    But she wasn't even called out during the fatty episode. Honker and Hanayo are the canon fatties.     an attractive early 20's guy  I was with you until you said that You lose thanks for playing      Because alpaca is not human. Boys alpacas are cute.    Is this what LoveFags actually believe? Mainstream newspapers in Japan publish articles on how gross and loser-liker LoveLivers are.    You mean tabloids? On the other hand, LL is actually advertised on mainstream newspapers. I'm seen several TV programs featuring LL as a social phenomenon.    Lame and creepy, portrait of a Love Liver!   These losers are the face of the Love Live fandom, look at them and laugh  Being a Love Live fan isn't socially acceptable at all, it's on the same weirdo scale as being an AKB fan. It's probably the same situation: liking Love Live is fine, being a fan is being a creep. Just like how liking AKB is OK but being the kind of fan that buys serials to vote on the elections makes you the biggest loser.     I bet you believe being an AKBfan is socially acceptable as well.   Ever since that one time Love Livers beat up to serious injury a guy just because he got a candy from one of the VAs their reputation has been rock bottom. Then again, Love Liver is different from "person that likes Love Live".   Get in line, pussy.    That's tabloid bs. The large number of enthusiastic fans create tons of legitimately good media contents including fan arts, MAD, cosplay video, etc. It's a great time to be a LL fan because the vast contents that people have made for the franchise. Every IP wishes to have such dedicated fanbase. Im@s for example is a very successful franchise but it's exposure is several magnitude lesser than LL.  So far, LL as a franchise has been very clean out of any scandal. The only thing antis can do is trash talking the hardcore fans even though they are not really outside of mainstream otaku.        Trying to import yaraon's bs here I see. This is what im@sfags relies on now?       LL as a franchise has been very clean out of any scandal.  Poor candy dude.     Honk  honk       S1 was so QUALITY compared to S2.   Why don't they have noses?   At least S1 has BDs with English subs.    You tell me       All this love for the Honk. This pleases me greatly.         What about WIXOSS? Why do they have staples for their noses?    Because Okada is a hack.    All hail   nico smells  This thread is being monitored. http://hope.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/l<wbr>ovelive/1435156993/109</wbr>    Hallo. Why is Rin so best?     the love is ded    25252  holy shit /a/ stop having good taste    Tomato.   Honk?      honk honk  come at me, my hymen is ready     Future Honk, anyone?  Are Nozomi and Eli lesbians yet    We'll never get to see the rest of µ's future selves      shameless     Go read the manga. All raibus are dykes there.     Ho.  What a  HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO      [Garasu no Hanazono intensifies]    don't lewd her ;-;    jolks    lewd what    Is Honoka's life going to go to shit after high school?    Doesnt the movie imply that she will become a singer?    She should just become a seiyuu   Who /honkers/ here?   honk honk    Whats the story behind this? Couldn't find any news articles about it    Nico is the most popular one Sherlock.     most popular    nico   pick one        Nico   Most popular   Kotori and Rin are more popular than Nico you dipshit       Why would anyone like Kotori? Of all the raibus she has the least presence.     I'm gonna marry this fatty  soldier game trio &gt; the rest      You mean in terms of being overrated and over hyped, right?     2qt              Honoka is the shittiest LL and deserves to be incinerated.              -cute -lewd -best voice -exotic hair -makes her friends dress lewd -burd -supportive  She's full of great qualities Who wouldn't love her?             japan pls go and stay go     least presence  That's Hanayo. Her aura is considered one of her strong points in the show.      But Maki is the worst    She's not lewd. Stop projecting.    ok     Are you retarded? She has the most pixiv images. Only Maki is close. And she gets the highest cutoffs in the game.    Rin    Rin is not popular, Burd is third on pixiv and second-third in terms of cutoffs.           I think you meant nico    No I mean Maki.  Atleast Nico is entertaining. Maki is just a bland shit.       sure thing nerd    Grope the fatass.    Every girl gets their own set of fanservice so that doesn't count. Plus those tumours are disgusting.    fanart  Wow you sure convinced me!       Plastic Memories: elevens are coming to crush and destroy our hearts.  While I WANT TO BELIEVE like all the diarytheoryfags, I think they may be going for the "they confirmed their feelings, were parted and never saw each other again" nipponese romance ending.  So, what are your bets? Here's mine:  sad goodbye 75% tsukasa suffering 10% diary-recall 10% michiru steps in 5%             Maybe it won't be so sad if i plug my ears.   I don't remember that....   You guys are kidding yourselves.   You should be asking yourself what ending would sell better. Happy, of course.     They are going full Saikano on this, don't delude yourself.   Post awesome main characters.    Kazuma   good  Bitch got owned by the tsundere.      Too obnoxious.    Yu was pretty based.   The most bad ass out of all the Harems!   He's the super buff mad max of japan   Which club would you join if you could pick one from any anime?   I certainly would join it.    Karuta club or quizz club. I'm pretty good at these kind of things. I'd wreck everyone while having fun.     With the mindset i had in high school ? The one with cutest girls.     The tennis club.  The kool kids klub  Is this the best show Kyoani has made Haruhi aside ?  Do people really unironically think that Amagi Brilliant Park was good? I mean it was entertaining but it wasn't good at all. It was KyoAni's weakest show to date.   sure why not    Keion is the best feelgood show Kyoani have done. Hyouka is the best 'arty' one.      mature project = things that aren't cute   I'm surprised they let 8 year old boys work in the industry.      Haruhi is absolute garbage though  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs</wbr>  [ ]  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada  - Sharingan  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127121565#p127121565">Click here</a> to view the full text.
