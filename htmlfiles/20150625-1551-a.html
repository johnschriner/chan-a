[ Time for a WEG thread.  Post WEGs.      Freshly made OC  Is there one for LOGH?   Make it yourself  Here, I'm even giving you the template           The last one barely died a few hours ago.         I love it     ;_;     Pretty much all I can recall of that movie is:   Don't do the thing I told you to do which would fix everything, Shinji   I'm going to do it anyway   ...I must go now, my people need me          this is what punchline fags actually think       still the greatest ride I ever rode      I don't get it.    I don't see the relationship between those. And I've watched/played both multiple times.    Shit, what's the name of this again?    They're both pretty cuh-razy and they both utilize character songs as an important theme (I'm convinced that Armstrong's fight wouldn't have been half as great without STANDING HERE)    welcome to WEG, the YLYL of /a/      Wolf Children   anyone have a Trigun WEG?   Oh lordy... food shows are torture sometimes.     4 and something around here   see this    Fuck you.         Kill la Kill tried too hard to be the new Gurren Lagann and Prometheus tried too hard to be the new Alien, I know is shitty but I was bored.    That's not really how WEGs work, pal          Prometheus actually had good lore. Klk just shoved everything to the garbage as the show went on.       The fights weren't good in symphogear, and neither was the music, so how did you get Revengeance?   Reposting from last thread     Too true.    Get rekt kiddo          Any more for stuff from this season?          If you had read the source you would have expected what it is. Animeonlyfags are cancer. Kill yourself.    Is this even good? I watch eps 1 when it came out but i thought it looked like crap so i quit.          One of the few shows that continues to make me mad to this day.   something saved from previous threads   The manga was better        I agree. Regardless of the ending though, i have to congratulate them on animating it well while remaining faithful to the manga's strange artstyle.   I don't know why, but it always bugs me when the anime people expect is newer than the show. I know everyone doesn't watch stuff as it airs (hell, I've got a giant backlog) but it still irks me for some dumb reason.   Can you rephrase that? I have no idea what you are trying to say.    So from what I gathered Plastic Memories isn't my long awaited Japanese Blade Runner, but is it worth watching or should I just go rewatch GitS?    Do you like series like AnoHana, SaiKano and Kanon? If not, go rewatch GitS. Plastic Memories is a melodrama with a thin veneer of SF with bullshit like the robots having souls.      Heh, sorry, I've been up way too long. I dislike it when the "what I expected show" is newer than the "what I watched". Like if you watched Haruhi and expected Lucky Star.      Oooh, i concur. On the other hand, i haven't watched nearly enough anime to be able to call anons out on that.          So it's FFIX: The Anime?  Sign me the fuck up.        No fuck you. Seriously fuck you. You fucks kept reposting this to the point that when I started watching it, I assumed I was in for some harrowing experience. When I saw the cute little moe girl doing cute little moe things, I thought she was going to get blown apart by a tank shell by the third episode.   And of fucking course all it is is fucking moeshit.       he didn't watch episode 7   he didn't make it to the end of the series  laughingwotos.gif      That's pretty good     Babylon 5   I'm tempted now.      Don't. The first episode was great, but the rest of it is downhill from there.     The atmosphere created in the first episode gets  shattered  by the end.       Only bad thing is that Meliodas have not even ounce of Zidane's charm    Anime gave me aidschan   my favourite weg   It's completely wrong though.      It's still of haram    Sonydicked    Gainax is dead, Love live TRIGGER    I want more of Nagate and Izana interactions on the ship - as long as progress is made. Those episodes were great.     Degeneracy      I don't even /pol/       I don't get it.    Is this a new troll method? I don't even understand what you're trying to imply.   ITT: shitty tumblr gif's.    Is second raid any better?      not liking Tessa  The fuck?    It was just perfect    liking that unsuited for life white-haired piece of shit             I'll fight you, fag    FMP would not work without the school episodes. They're what makes Sousuke's character development have impact later.  And also speaking as a Chidorifag, Tessa is a miracle, fuck you.        Watched -- YuYuYu Expected -- Cozy SOL Got -- Mahou shoujo suffering I think that's completely reasonable.       Of course, but it's the Taisha/Shinju who're responsible for the suffering.  Gyuuki dindu nuffin      Chidori is also meh for me  Anyways is second raid worth watching?              Shiki was such a great ride. Especially because I didn't know am I getting into, it was pretty much a mystery for the first couple of episodes.      Watching Ergo Proxy right now. Does it ever get good?    Now this is how you put more than one image in a panel.    It basically doesn't even count as more than one image because he essentially made a single entirely new image using snippets of others.      Nope.    Strangely I don't care much about the fanservice in this show because of the damn food. Makes me hungry as fuck.  And then I realise I can't cook.      Jesus, I just got hungry literally right after I stopped eating because I was totally full.    Ergo Proxy is not for kids    This is literally perfect.    Huh? What does Lucky Star have to do with Haruhi other than the protagonist liking the anime?      Sure, sure. But does it ever stop being 2deep4me vaguely relevant philosophical discussions in an excessively gloomy post-apocalyptic landscape? The first two episodes had me hooked but now it's becoming a drag.    The 16th episode (Dead Calm) is excellent. The rest of the series is dull as fuck    See<br/>    It gets good when best girl appears.  Also this, it's basically the only episode I remember.       Okay, I see. Does the ending at least provide some payoff?     It's basically Big Event + Close Call + MC Makes The Right Choice and it's all wrapped in the usual 2deep4me atmosphere     no utah yet?     The whole 15 minute per episode thing is what turned me off   Can someone post a FATE one?    Anyone have the other one?  Mandatory.     nailed it. Now I know why I enjoyed nanatsu despite of being not a fan of fighting shounen.     Guu is the magic mushrooms of anime?       someone didn't make it to ep. 7    I don't get it.     If you had read the source you would have expected what it is.  Not that anon, but that hardly would've made it any less awful. It didn't even pass as my "I'm so bored and need to fill the time with anything" series this season.     Not that anon, but I didn't either. I couldn't sit through 7 episodes of K-ON designs.    That's one bad case of shit taste you have there, friend.    Underrated one    Are you joking?    Barakamon any good?      because it was so bad right?    It's a simple and straightforward action adventure fantasy, but it does what it does well without biting off more than it can chew.      Would have accepted DQ VII also but you passs     the futa   Wait, what?      soo... in the end you get trope abuse? get every trope explained?    The show often breaks the 4th wall and points out tropes or parodies them.     Can't wait for mission 3     This one?    Are you implying fights in MGRR were actually good? Because they weren't.    its healing  no moeblob shit         Muh wotos!     Not muh wotos.           FUCK MY SIDES        There is absolutely no purpose in posting one with the same three images in each panel.    School eps were good tessa a shit      good     futa  Izana can be anything you want, darling!     Prisma Illya was already posted, faggot no penis.     moeshit implies that it was fun     he means the epic ones not that moeshit   Such a waste of time    I'm butthurt VNfag  Your taste is secondary. Go cry in /jp/       epic       Be more concise.     The fights weren't good in symphogear  Did you watch it blindfolded?     Since when is reading an amazingly written VN secondary in /a/?    He died of cuteness    Woah woah woah woah woah.    Since hipsters got in and started hating on Fate and Nasu beceause Type Moon stuff is popular       Fate gay nite   amazingly written VN secondary in /a/?   That maymay is old, /b/ tard        amazingly written  I can't resist this bait. Its too much for me.      What is even your point, retard?    Bullshit. Even Nasu watches Prisma Illya. That's proof that your taste is worse than nips.      But it's true That you don't like it doesn't make it less true       I wanted to like it so much. Everything before the time skip was at least interesting to read. After that though, it just got tougher and tougher to want to sift through. Then the end...God damn that end.    This is all true and factchecked.      any Type-Moon thing   well written   hahaha  HAHAHAHA        Get that shit off /a/     Made this after finishing S2 today. Just in time for GX hype   When did I say I hated Prisma , retard? I love both Prisma (in fact , Drei is the only manga I'm following as it comes out) and F/SN      ha  Naruto has superior writing.      Type Moon hater   Is a stupid shitposter   sasuga       Strangely I don't care much about the fanservice in this show  This, when the fanservice go to a second plane, it means your series is fucking good.     You're talking about how the characters cried constantly right?    I hope you aren't serious, narutard    Tell that to janny who keeps deleting your shitty Fate threads, shiteater.     2015   being a hipster elitist.      Back to the containment thread you go.    He's doing his job wrong because worse threads are allowed, and deleting threads because he doesn't like the franchise is childish  Maybe it's because of all of the shitposts from the haters ,and the fans (VNfags and animefags both) Anyways, threads being deleted in an imageboard on the internet isn't at all proof of the series being bad         2015   Liking generic jumb battle shounenshit like narushit and DBShit      Is a poorly made "feels" anime. The feels feel fake and forced. Do not watch.     Damage control   "This not muh real Islam of peace!"   Keep crying.       But KlK was better than Gurren.    Pretty accurate I'd say      What are you even trying to say? What do you mean by damage control? How does any of it make Fate bad? You aren't making any sense, shitposter-kun       As opposed to generic otaku pandering moeshit right?    woah now easy on the bait don't over do it     2015   Thinking every anime that isn't generic jump battle shounenshit like DBShit and Narushit is generic otaku pandering moeshit  You can (not) be this dumb      Jesus fuck, how stereotypical are you just planning on being?  Just proving him right to everyone else watching your argument, naruturd.       The point is that none of you complain about the generic moeshit clogging the board, yet continually want to purge the board of Naruto under the guise that it's because it's generic, and specifically said so in that post, but nice assumption.     We don't want to purge Naruto because its shit, we want to purge Naruto because the fanbase is literally underage retards.    Whatever you say. We all know it's literally just "stop liking what I don't like".    So, just because there are CGDCT things on it, you call the entire show as fucking moeshit!?  Heh, that's your own fault, man. Just forget or ignore the image of K-ON in your head, okay.       Can't believe it's over      Yes  though if you don't like any of the main girls I don't know, really       This is so fucking ironic.  You going into an unrelated thread whining about "moeshit" is proof enough that Naruto threads have negative effects. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.      Quality response. It was more a post about hypocrisy than a complaint, but I wouldn't you to interpret it as anything else.    Don't you dare compare Barakamon to a fucking Adam Sandler movie    Don't be stupid.     Implying I don't also complain about generic CGDCT SOLshit     Bullshit. while the 2nd season wasn't technically bad, it most certainly wasn't that good either.    If you cried with this, you're a big pussy    I had as much fun with it as the first season. It was more all over the place than the first but it made up for it with more hilarious retardacy (like everything to do with the doctor).    I don't want to start this shit again since it's so close to the 3rd season premiere. I'll just say that I had probably hated all the changes that you had enjoyed in the 2nd season. I'll probably check out the 3rd season after 3 episodes had aired and people are saying it's good.    I cried at that and at least 30 other cartoons. Isn't that what's expected of little girls?    Yes, but at Shigatsu?  Although I don't like the series because the MC is clearly in an abusive relationship with that blond bint and should run away as fast as he can.      Why not? It had good ethos and the writing wasn't complete shit like some other shows. If you're not into cry porn, that's fine, but it wasn't really bad.     tfw glorious armies of Islam removed those infidels from holy lands.         Healing in its purest form.    lel    I think he meant the one that's very long      Which redditor made this image?    Could be any of them, they love choking on Nasu's cock    I've seen almost identical version floating around for ages    So have I. However, Heaven's Feel is my favorite route, but equating it to EoE is just way too overblown. It was a 7/10 at best. At least the old version didn't use the feels image.        Do we lie now in WEG threads? I both read and saw the show, I expected a tale of a conqueror. I got yaoi harem instead. The MC may as well be the girl self-insert.   Stop lying.      accurate.    Eh? It was moeshit for like 99% of the show.    I am the singapoor curry afrikaan and I watch Naruto unironically.I was also trained to counterstrike kebabs bigger than you. You wanna fight me , sanchez?      2.    it's the same shit  barakamon was a massive disappointment      Again. This shit taste.    It's ok. Don't read the manga though, anime is way better.        Fuck you fags. If you ever watched Adam Sandler unironically, you belong back in /reddit/. FUUUUUUCK OFF!       Did you? That looks unappealing as hell. I suffered through season one. It was garbage I don't know how people trick themselves into thinking it's good enough to have hype threads. Sam Flam had better art direction, and it's actually notorious for QUALITY.  Get a load of this casual. Did you forget to unlock the parry or something?     Show was lacking in music and epic rocking Way too much of it was talking about pointless shit      transforming, singing girls punching the shit out of things is unappealing  What are you, gay?     Thanks for reminding me that exists asshole.    Same. I was so delighted.    He's probably one of those "muh animation" nerds who doesn't know how to have fun, and hates on everything that fails to meet his standards on animation     I agree with you.       I like it  I also liked the ending because  best girl got away with everything       what is this?   Anyone have the original Bake one with word and powerpoint?   Is this one regarding the bird?    This anime was shit. What a disappointing adaption.    Symphogear and Sora no Woto are two of the most notably obnoxious fanbases when it comes to size:presence ratio. They both have disproportionally large presences for their size      Yeah, the board has really gone to shit in the last year, Narutard and DBZ shitty threads everywhere, shounentards complaining about moeshit unironically everywhere, clear newfags and underage banned everywhere. It takes a while for Boku no Pico to be posted in rec threads now. Shame, /a/ used to be good.     What? They can't sing?    Incredibly accurate.    Feel free to leave     shounentards complaining about moeshit unironically everywhere  if anno and miyazaki are any indication, not all people who hate moeshit are shounenfags       Yeah because it's ruining Japanese animation and its image. Not to mention destroying the lives of introverts who get hooked onto the unreal in order to replace the real social life they can't get.   Summer is unbearably long.     Moe is improving Japanese animation. Literally any show would be better if it was replaced with an all girl cast.      Implying either have said anything explicitly about the content of anime and it being ruined by "moe" rather than unskilled producers and writers   Fuck off retard      this thread     Any Getter show   Mazinger   Mazinkaiser   GaoGaiGar   Better if they had an all girl cast  Fuck off, moeshitter          Falling for the anime was a mistake shitposting  They've complained about shitty directing and writing, not cute girls specifically.      normies  Fuck of to /r9k/ with your 'rare pepes'     Feel free to go somewhere else you delusional faggot    That was a very good laugh thank you     Kinnikuman   It actually makes it popular...but not as lasting as the original. Like, it become popular until the next season while Kinnikuman by itself is a classic (at least for the elevens)     Indeed, if fan service doesn't get in the way of plot, or is done in a stupid fashion, I can do it.  Also, mans service.        missing the point entirely and resorting to ad hominem   You guys could fit right into the gang, probably even over Charlie and Dee      Great read, that one. Surprisingly realistic too, with the drugs and broken people.    It's /a/, not /tv/  Try not to expect people to get your references       Best anime I've never seen.    Only people from and on /tv/ watch TV shows  Always Sunny is basically a chronicle of everything wrong with 4chan these days, it's a shame anons will assume I'm some crossboarder for posting it in such a context     What I got should be that one hot springs gif    while most don't agree i still loved that show. i have strange tastes.    I didn't claim you were a fucking crossboarder. It's not out of the world to expect people on an anime board to be more unfamiliar with a tv show than /tv/ would. That's why I said "don't expect.."  Fucking Christ     Dragonball creator Akira Toriyama stated that  Super Saiyan God is in fact stronger than the new transformation Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan    At the end of Battle of Gods Goku released his God transformation but still retained some of its power, that was the basis for the new transformation, SSJGSSJ, so he wouldn't have to do the ritual again to get god ki, but it isn't as strong.   it's only a super saiyan with God ki   Akira also said Ssg is stronger because Red is better than Blue   he's going senile   http://kotaku.com/its-official-goku<wbr>-has-blue-hair-in-dragon-ball-z-169<wbr>6943056</wbr></wbr>            Red is better than Blue   Toriyama confirmed as an asukafag      Kek     Red is better than Blue   Toriyama confirmed for Team Magma     Dragonball is the worst anime ever made, the plot isn't deep or complex, the animations are mediocre, goku is op and isn't even likeable, there are like 2 women in the whole series and they aren't even hot. And the villians suck balls and don't even have back storyz     the plot isn't deep or complex   goku is op   That's the point of Dragon Ball.       I feel like I'm the only one here who understands the beauty, subtly and brilliance of Dragon Ball.   Dragonball or DBZ? Because dragonball is a good anime.    Yeet    Asuka wins     Based Toriyama, not giving a fuck about anything   So how much is SSJGSSJ stronger than SSJG Mr. Toriyama?   Who said SSJGSSJ is stronger than SSJG?   Well we assumed it is, since it's the next transformation and Beerus said that Goku is now strong as SSJG in his normal form.   Well it isn't and you're wrong   But how, why?   Because red is better than blue.   He's trolling the fandom and enjoying it.              Dragonball is fucking amazing! DBZ is worse.   Goku is OP  Yeah, thats the point  There are like 2 women in the series and they aren't even hot   Android 18 not hot  You're a fag.  Villians suck balls and dont even have back storyz  Your grammar sucks balls and doesn't have any story. Go back to your moeshit and edgy hardcore anime, I'll be enjoying people punching each other at light speed.             This    OK, Toriyama is just fucking with us at this point.     Red   not being better than inferior blue       I have half watched dragon balls as a kid but don't remember shit, its probably the only well known anime that i still haven't watch and i am hanging on it since it's quite big and i am not sure if it's worth the time, i don't have any biased hate over shonen but i did drop bleach and naruto, so i am not sure.       the plot isn't deep or complex  Stopped reading right there.     now i'm thinking that in xenoverse both goku and vegeta actually say "i'll show you a power beyond that of a super saiyan god"    It's official, dragonball has gone full islam    Dragonball z is unlike any other Shonen title, it has only a handful of flash backs throughout the entire series, there is hardly ever a 30 minute speach on backstory, it's a great series and it doesn't try to make itself seem any more complex than it is, the story is straightforward and fun.   It's stronger in the same way Golden Frieza is, even though it has an edge over the blue saiyan god it doesn't last long enough to make a difference.    the plot isn't deep or complex,  not every show has to be fucking Shakespeare, you know?   goku is op  and what shonen main character ISN'T over-powered in some way?    there are like 2 women in the whole series and they aren't even hot.  first of all, 18 is damm sexy. secondly, if you wanted an all-girl/mostly girls fighting-type of anime, there are plenty of those.   And the villians suck balls and don't even have back storyz  first of all, you mom sucks plenty more balls than a golfball-cleaner. secondly, if you'd actually watched the show, you'd realize that every major villain has build-up and delivery, both in origins, motives and mindsets.  I know this is bait, but you're full of shit.                  Toriyama just said that he think that blue COLOR is weaker that red COLOR, he didnt talked about transformation, the guy who write the article said so, probably to gain visits.     goku is op  He has never been more powerful than the big bad in any arc (post Dragon Ball, anyway).     I agree.    When you posted a video about Danny D's World Dragon Ball Super transformations Blue vs. Red.   And suddenly realize that he compare the creators of Bleach &amp; Naruto to a Child molester.  http://<span>youtu.be/Z6ikYrXGQBA  [ ]      When you want the most popular user to suffer but yet doesn't know how to enable the comments in his comment box.      When you compare ForneverWorld to a ForneverJoke but yet doesn't give out any new information about the individual?     Kotaku      reading youtube comments   ever        When you try to claim that ForneverWorld has ever read the article, yet doesn't realize that he read it at Kotaku?     When you read the comments on a video about a request fight and wished that murder was legal in the states?  http://<span>youtu.be/-69LpKFt3ew  [ ]     The only senile one here are people like you and the author of that article. You're taking a completely out of context quote and not even reading it correctly.  Yeah, he says that red looks stronger than blue... but so what? Many times in Dragonball weaker looking doesn't mean weak. Remember Freeza's final form compared to this 2nd and 3rd ones? Remember that bulky SSJ form that Trunks achieved? Heck, look at Nappa and Vegeta. Nappa is much more visually imposing, yet he was a joke in comparison.       When you talk about how much you hate Broly so much.   Yet you can't admit that his cock is big enough to fuck useless orihime in her pussy!   lol      When you posted a video claiming that you're done with Moe anime yet sticks around when Dragon Ball Super comes on in July 5.   :3 http://<span>youtu.be/aAk1Qu6m7a4  [ ]    At this point, I don't know what powerups are parody or not.   When you make video about why Goku isn't a bad father but forgot that Naruto's dad has been with him since the 4th Ninja War and had a relevant feature in the story then bardock.   http://<span>youtu.be/fn2KNYOyzuI  [ ]    Is Toriyama drunk? The movie takeaway is that Goku should stop fucking around and now he says that fucker could've destroyed Golden Frieza if he didn't skip the stupid ritual. Besides why is the name longer now if it's a weaker form?    When you act nice in the video but yet when someone asks about a retcon in the story of Goku's Origin.    Yet calls him a retard and claims that he's two years old.   http://<span>youtu.be/lfkDPMNqhIU  [ ]    Now that I've read the shit article he never mentions power levels, you dunce. The nigger on Kotaku does, the only Toriyama quote there talks about the color power visually.   Red was as strong color and yellow is old and busted so he moved to blue next because that is easier on the eyes.         Get this. Honestly.  Don't even waste another second without it.          When you know you successfully troll a nigga.  http://<span>youtu.be/6CPtD9TJ5z0  [ ]     It actually makes more sense this way. SSJG was more uncontrollable &amp; easier to run out of energy for. SSGSS is weaker but more controlled &amp; prolonged. It's like sprinting at full speed &amp; pooping out earlier vs a more gradual process. It shows that Goku's in control.     yfw SSJGSG hair is blue, just like SSJ Broly     SSJGSS confirm as weaker than Broly!    Dragonball pretty over rated thought, its because it aired in America and Europe that people are willing to overlook its major flaws.  I like DB but I still accept it is total shit.     I thought blue SSJ was implied to be weaker from the beginning. And this article is from April. Why is this suddenly a big deal?     people are willing to overlook its major flaws   What are the flaws then? We like Dragon Ball because of it's epicness.      so SSJ4 still strongest good to know    It doesn't exist.    Alright, so SSG at full power is stronger than any of the previous SS transformations. Goku retained SOME god ki so that means he can go SSG but he wouldn't be as strong as he was when he first went SSG. Does that mean SSG is weaker than the previous SS transformations at this point? And SSGSS is stroYOU KNOW WHAT FUCK THIS I'M DONE I'M FUCKING DONE WITH TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS GARBAGE FUCK SSGSS FUCK THE SSG HOLDING HANDS BULL SHIT FUCK TORIYAMA AND FUCK ALL OF YOU   So SSGSS1 is blue SSGSS2 is Green SSGSS2 ascended is Yellow SSGSS3 is Orange SSGSS4 is Red   and thus GT is cannon           If it's only SSJ with god ki, why not make the hair orange? Golden with a hint of red is now blue?    SUPER SAYIAN GOD SUPER SAYIAN GOD SUPER SAYIAN   every time.    Why the fuck do people keep quoting Kotaku?  Do you even realize what you're fucking posting?      10 minute screaming contests per 1 minute of fighting   shitty voice acting (both English and Japanese)   the lack of anything happening ever   shitty power ups ie. pallette changes with more glowing   shitty humor   I understand its important however, it really boasted Anime popularity in the west and set the tropes for the genre. However saying it is a good show apart from its gimmicks is just wrong in my opinion.          Fuck you, now it's stuck in my head   So is Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is Super Saiyan with God ki wouldn't it be just God Super Saiyan?   No since ssgss is just super saiyan taping into the god power. God ki seems to only fully obtained when 6 saiyans touch wieners.    What toriyama should have called the blue hair form Demi-super saiyan god. Like only half God or something.    More like Super Saiyan Demigod.   based    I can't wait for the next movie where Goku has green hair    I'm ultimate.    He's trolling the fandom and enjoying it.  He's been doing that for decades, anon.   Ah, with Piccolo defeated, I can finally end Dragon Ball   No way, Toriyama. You're making us millions! You gotta keep going!   Man, I don't wanna.   DO IT.   Fine. Goku is actually an ALIEN FROM OUTER SPACE   Cool!   And he has to fight a two-eyed, two-horned, flying purple people eater   Of course!   Then he fights ANDROIDS   Alright!   Then he has to fight a crazy science experiment who has the DNA of every powerful fighter thus far!   Awesome!   And then he fights a fat pink blob   Okay   And then a medium pink blob   Okay...   And finally, a kid blob!   Huh   I was just fucking with you guys, I don't care about this series anymore   We don't care, we'll still take it!                          Why call it SSJGSSJ then? That makes it sound more powerful than SSJG  It should have been called something like "Truly Ascended Super Saiyan"  At least then it would've made sense for it to be less powerful if it didn't have "god" in the title of the form       Based Toriyama    Holy fat Asuka      two-eyed   But that's normal, Tien        So what? How do you expect him to keep writing new and interesting shit, it can only last so long before he just starts making random shit up.  Imagine if Dragonball had to keep running for infinity, every possible idea ever would be used up, after a while Toriyama would just spout stupid childish redundant ideas because there's nothing new or interesting left.  Because there are no new ideas left, and everything has been done, you would eventually simply do nothing, this is called meditation. Eventually though, from doing nothing you can change your spiritual state, and achieve happiness, unlocking new 4th dimensional ideas.  New 4th dimensional ideas can only be achieved through meditation. The 3Dimensions we exist in has almost completely run out of ideas, eventually we are all going to just have to meditate.            Actually Goku has always been strong enough to shit house the villains up to Beerus but he chose not to because he wanted to let someone else have a chance     Red is better than Blue   Toriyama confirmed for killing 2pac       Implying the true fans don't love it  Moefag plz     I think you may have missed the entirety of the Android Saga.    No I think you did  Goku was sick with a heart disease thats the only reason he didn't wreck both androids     Didn't WSJ state the opposite?  This is why One Piece has always been better at Dragonball than dragonball. It actually values its continuity     So what you're saying is you were wrong and you admit it?   He never said that ssjg was stronger than ssjgss just the color plus that interview was two years old anyway   Whose this semen demon    No.  He died with Raditz. He lost to Vegeta, he was only saved because Gohan as oozaru went on a rampage. He was completely outclassed by Frieza until he went SSJ. He was never a match for Cell.         We knew that ages ago, faggot   Will Salad awaken the rinnegan due to the mixing of her Uchiha and Uzumaki blood?  fuck off.   Do we really need a new thread? Just wait until the chapter comes out or else we'll look like a general.       Sakura is the mum, but that doesn't need to be biological. No one denies that for all intent and purposes Sakura raised Salad as her own and influenced her the most. But that is not proof for blood relation.   Honestly, man? If the very last page is Sarada punching the ground and cracking it, chances are this may be the first time Sarada has ever displayed super strength.  In other words, unless observation was enough or it's going to be revealed that Sakura helps train Sarada, Kishi might be doing that to say she actually has Sakura's genes.          Not this shit again. Senju/Uchiha blood alone isn't enough for Rinnegan you retarded nigger    but it is     Kishi might be doing that to say she actually has Sakura's genes.   Does it mean that Sakura is a secret Senju?      No, you need actual Asura and Indra blood, to recreate Hagoromo's power. That's why Madara could get it but Obito not.      Hanabi and Konohamaru marriying.   No, never, ever. Out with your shit taste.    Sarada losing her Uchiha name   That's not how clan systems work.  Hinata "lost" hers because she's not the Hyuga heir, though. But if Naruto wasn't the Hokage or wasn't famous. He would had adopted the Hyuga name, as Neji stated in the SD spin-off.               yeah, are we supposed to believe that pink shit is tsunade's secret biological daughter?     More like Sarada got that super chakra control that Sakura have.     Bort can pull off some fucking Rasengan Chidori Zeus lightning bolt shit by the time he's 12    Salad gets 1 tomoe and punches things really hard  And they're supposed to be rivals how?       No.  You need to have them have Indra and Ashura's chakra with Hagoromo, which means you nees to have them be the literal reincarnations of them.  And the current incarnations, Naruto and Sasuke are alive.       "EVIL is dead. She's not here anymore! But through my spoilers, and in my heart, she lives on in me! Trolling the Sakura cucks to pierce the heavens! Even if their salty tears become my grave, as long as I break through, I shall be victorious! Who the hell do you think I am?! I'm Rai I'm not my sister Evil! I am myself! Rai the Leaker! Certain Kill!...Giga...CUCK... BREAKER!!!!"    Anyone who ACTUALLY thinks sakura won't turn out the biological mom is a moron   I dunno. Anybody who thinks Kishi will be perfectly predictable in his writing either is the biggest moron I think.  I hope for landwhale tears, but I can deal with any outcome. Remember that for SS a winning scenario is just that pink and sauce have an incredibly distant relationship for dubious reasons of mission obligations.        Come the fuck on    All the talk about cucking by /a/ is just for getting on /ss/ fangirl's nerves, the reality is probably much simpler. Especially since none of us could truly imagine Sasuke getting an erection for anything or anyone.   Most likely. Let's just say for the sake of argument this isn't all a ruse, that Sarada is biologically Karin's either by way of experiment or birth, does anyone seriously believe that Kishi would NOT end this all in a way where Sasuke is forgiven for whatever wrongs he may have done and Sakura looks like the most perfect mother Sarada could have had?  He's already trying to play off Sasuke's complete absence as not that big a deal considering the nature of his "top sikrit mission" even though it makes no sense that he couldn't have at least tried to contact Sarada or Sakura once in awhile when he sent reports to Naruto. And he's already gone through a painstaking effort to make Sakura looks a gentle yet fierce mother hen.  Even if Sasuke did actually do it with Karin in the end, Kishi will find some way to make it look like Sasuke din do nuffin'         Reminder that not all Sakurafags are crazy and that she's great in The Last and Gaiden even if you didn't like her in the main series.   Is Rai trolling?    That wasn't what he was referring to. He was talking about the onion's backstab.    No, the "not Sakura side" means that the Shins Jr betray Shin Sr, but not to go to Sakura's side    If Sarada's super punch were evidence of her lineage then Sarada wouldn't have had doubts in the first place.     Face it, Kishi has delayed any talk of Salad's genes and instead tried to show that her legal parents care about her, and that she resemble them in ways that matters. This is expected as we already know they are going to be still together in the movie. But Kishi is not settling the genetic thing this week, he just showed the family element.      Not bad chapter.    No way this is ending in 1 more chapter.    Sarada's fighting style...same as her mama!    Shin father betrayed by Shin jr....    I never said Sakura's side...    Of course their own side.   No Rinnegan this week.    Sasuke cares about his wife.   Sarada smiles looking the two of them.                   You could have prevented this   Please refrain from ever posting like that again. Thank you.    Not crazy, maybe, but all of them have shit taste for liking such a terrible cunt.    No.    You're wrong. All adopted children are treated like shit by their parents. No parent will love their adopted child as much as their blood child. Don't disagree with me you're wrong. Adopted children are better off aborted.     She was bretty gud in The Last, but pretty shit in Gaiden except in the flashbacks I guess.  At any point in the story has the justification for her feelings for sauce ever been given? There's never been anything I've seen to indicate anything but a dumb preteen crush held onto with retard level tenacity.         does anyone seriously believe that Kishi would NOT end this all in a way where Sasuke is forgiven for whatever wrongs he may have done and Sakura looks like the most perfect mother Sarada could have had?  Basically yeah, either way SS stays canon. It's just that SS fangirls have this romantic fantasy that doesn't match the actual manga, so even though SS is canon they still complain that they didn't get the exact thing they wanted.     fuck on, boku wa onahole    At the very least I'm willing to accept that a minority of sakurafags are sane. Other than that, sakurafags are fucked in the head. If you say something nice about another female char, expect the usual "BUT SAKURA IS BETTERER!!1!". They literally think the series revolves around her vagina.  Actually, scratch the "another female char" part, its Hinata. Sakurafags have a extreme inferiority complex regarding Hinata, they hate her guts.     Does Naruto died   From which filler you got this?     Where does it say that?      And your complete post is just plain fucking wrong, Bloodfag.    Sakura's fighting style is the least objectionable part of her character.  Unfortunately, Taijutsu users fucking suck in Naruto.     With some notable exception.    Sarada's fighting style is a combination of Sasuke and Sakura's    Boruto's fighting style is a combination of Naruto and Sasuke's   Kishi really loves that edgelord.       coming right up    Well he is autistic.    No.  He got downgraded to Damsel in Distress.        Well you are a nigger     didn't kill   will never walk again (would've died had jesus not taken the wheel)   implying all taijutsu users aren't absolutely shit tier.       Hes eating chips with Chouchou    Taijutsu with Sharingan might be decent.    And Sasuke is the one to rescue him.  Guess without editors Kishi would have killed Naruto and made Sasuke the MC.      He literally saved the world just by being good enough to fight Uchiha Madara for 10 minutes.  And I'm not talking about edo tensei Uchiha Madara.        Basically yeah, either way SS stays canon.   Exactly. But I think some people were blinded by their hatred of SS and/or its fandom that they didn't stop to think that no matter what Sasuke did, SS would remain canon and we'd be expected to believe Sasuke cares about Sakura even with very little evidence. It's just the awkwardness of Kishi's writing this whole episode and this pairing is hilarious in that he expects us to believe Sasuke really does love Sakura even though he's never there for her and may have had a kid with someone else, and this is after he tried to kill her multiple times.  Would anybody be surprised if Sasuke admitted to actually having sex with Karin and dumping her kid on Sakura for some ten or more years while he ran around waiting for the plot to fall into his lap and then just said "Sorry"? That's just as believable to me as Kishi writing that Sarada having Karin DNA is all a misunderstanding.          Anticipated such a family would eventually appear  How does that make any sense? They knew an incarnation of Indra or Asura would eat part of the other one? Even then, "family" makes absolutely no sense in that context.    I wish naruto had an eye technique   So why did Madara hide underground until he was an old man on his death bed to do all the shit that he did?    Its just dumbasses not seeing the big picture. Sarada has perfect chaka control, she'll be able steal/copy more shit and make her own   If Sarada got a mangekyo sharingan, what should it look like and what special ability should it grant?      literally a general  MODS        Stupid Boruto! I'm going to become the Hokage!   Then I'm going to fuck the Hokage.   w-wait what       Dude, Guy is easily in the top 5 full power Madara&gt;Kaguya&gt;Jesus&gt;Sauce&gt;8-gates Guy&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obito&gt;Hashirama&gt;doesn't matter anymore     Sakura had perfect chakra control and she was the biggest jobber in the series.     Ah, forgot about that.  But since all he needed was Hashirama's DNA, that is, his genes, shouldn't that mean that if you have the DNA of both transmigrants, you could get a Rinnegan?      They called her fucking salad    she'll be able steal/copy more shit and make her own  Not with 1 tomoe she won't.      Exactly. But I think some people were blinded by their hatred of SS and/or its fandom that they didn't stop to think that no matter what Sasuke did, SS would remain canon and we'd be expected to believe Sasuke cares about Sakura even with very little evidence  I don't think any of us is blinded. It is the SS fangirls who are acting like lunatics because their fantasy of a perfect nuclear family was dashed. And most of us enjoy laughing at them as they tried to deny reality. The fact that they could be so crazy despite Kishi keeping their pairing intact is just hilarious to watch.     Niggastream.   Look at the second panel. He only got the Rinnegan and thus the ability to not get his shit pushed in by Hashirama if he tried anything when he was old.      niggerstream translation, was just the first I could come up with  He unlocked the Rinnegan when he was very old. And he never recovered from his last fight with Hashirama, dude fucked him up good       It's probably the same principle by which Boruto gets the whiskers.  It's chakra gene magic.        Kishi trying to be like Toriyama naming his characters after foods     Nope, nothing. A classic example of bad writing - the love at first sight trope.    more Goddamn mooninites   Where the fuck is Piccolo when you need him to nuke the moon?      Hah, if anything, its usually the opposite. My barren aunt didn't travel all the way to China for a baby she was only going to half love. If anything, my cousins were spoiled by them since they had to go through so much trouble to get them.      she was the biggest jobber in the series.   She tied against Ino and won against Sasori.  Kiba, Lee and Hinata are way worse jobbers.        You only need strong emotions, not just hatred to unlock the tomoes     Main character is literally named after a fish cake ramen topping   only just now noticing Kishimoto aping Toriyama  Come on, anon.       Guy is easily top 5!   (provided he kills himself)  Nah, taijutsu users are so bottom of the barrel that they have to suicide to be of any use. also  madara above kaguya  Nope.         Nobody likes adopted children in Japan.  If you're parents can't take care of you, you'll spend your whole life in an orphanage.        But since all he needed was Hashirama's DNA  He didn't need his genes, he needed his tissue/his cells     Not proportionate to their panel time they're not.   No, a Narutard thread will not be the most active thread on this board.    Why do people keep freaking out about this quote?        &gt;madara above kaguya   Nope.  He was tho. While she had more raw power she didn't know how to fight for shit. He basically asshandled the entire alliance and the god duo for a good 150 chapters while she only lasted about 30       why don't people pay attention to the anime I like waaaah  Naruto threads have been the most popular threads for months now. Get over it.     sex partners    Sakura barely has enough fights to consider her a jobber, and she was on the winning side of her biggest one.    Your daddy left you so you grew up to be a beta male mommied boy.    It's funny     35 posters   active  Anon pls       won against Sasori   "she" won in the same regard that a condom has sex      Sasuke smiles at Sarada  Oh god next week is gonna be a shit strom isnt it. Its too fucking comfy.     Jesus and Sauce are completely equal.   What the fuck would Gai do against full power Obito ?        Nah, taijutsu users are so bottom of the barrel that they have to suicide to be of any use.  Keep baiting fgt. Just get over the fact that Guy pushed your husbandos shit in for good     This makes more sense. Salad's skills seem more applicable in the bedroom than the battlefield.   Why I can't drop this shit? This is like a horrible guilty pleasure for me.  Someone help me kill myself. I should have dropped this turd after the Rescue Sasuke Arc.      It's not that she didn't know, how to fight it's more over that naruto and sasuke were given the macguffin needed to seal her. so without that macguffin kaguya insta wins.       replying to obvious b8       Because you like it you fucking faggot.     Tied against Ino  wow it's fucking nothing  won against Sasori  No, that was Chiyo.         It's like eating a big mac, anon. You know it's bad for you. You know it's not quality by any stretch of the imagination. But damn it you love feeling that ball of grease roll around your tongue.    Try to occupy your head with other things, I guess. Sooner of later you'll forget about it. Also, thank God you can use the old numbers captcha now, fuck picking salad    Seems that way. Maybe Kishi felt he needed 2 weeks of SS pandering before delivering the final blow.    This is what delusional Narutards actually believe.     macguffin  tvtropes pls go Also, they already got Hagoromo's powers against Madara who still managed to fuck their shit sideways      I like Hinata anon.    It was 2 against 1. By that logic, Hinata was on the winning side of her fight with Pain.     Guy pushed your husbandos shit in for good   he broke a few of madara's ribs then proceeded to roll over and die.  MIGHTY MIGHT GUY AMIRITE.      Oops wrong pic. Lol my bad anons.     Try to occupy your head with other things, I guess. Sooner of later you'll forget about it.   Nope doesn't work. I was able to drop shit like Bleach, Supernatural, and Korra but not this. Nothing works.        full power Madara was way above Obito. Guy kicked him around like a punching ball. Obito was only immune to ninjutsu, taijutsu worked just fine    But both Sasuke and Naruto were alive when Pain was alive.    Im thinking this apart of the graduation test,its all a genjustu. But i might just be crazy     Oh god next week is gonna be a shit strom isnt it.    what makes you say that?  honestly, I'm a little upset that Sarada is probably not going to hold a grudge against Sasuke.  He keeps getting away with everything.            muh Sakura didn't do anything in the Sasori fight meme     Hinata...   Don't worry, they'll get deleted after Gaiden is over, just like how the ongoing threads were deleted after the main series was over.     There is no final blow. Its over  Then you're in the minority of sakurafags       Can someone post worksafe pictures of Hinata with big boobs?  I say worksafe because the clothing covering the nipples makes it hotter     It's either Naruto, JoJo or Yahari. Pick your poison anon     What the hell is going on in this picture? Twincestuous threesome?     Okay.   Soon.       After the Gaiden there's the movie in August. But after that it's pretty much over as far as we know.   Unless that "secret" announcement 33 days from now says otherwise.       honestly, I'm a little upset that Sarada is probably not going to hold a grudge against Sasuke.  She would likely understand that Sasuke IS a shitty father, but not intentionally so. And that he would want to be a better dad if only he knows how. So she can't get too mad at him for being incompetent.     How big do you want them?    /a/ has me paranoid. I think they just wont have that as close a relationship that Sarada wanted,she wont hate him though    Paz...    The Hinata/Sakura friendship is cute.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127136721   still thinking it's just a rogue janitor  I can't help but laugh at your idiocy.     huge    And then she sees him getting all buddy buddy with Burrito and gets her 2nd tomoe.    Guy didn't die though Face it, Madara is dead and didn't get what he wanted, Guy is still alive, and though he can't use his legs, he doesn't care because he can use his hands, so he's as happy as a clam.      biggest jobber in the series.  You have to be strong to job.  Sakura isn't a jobber she's a loser.        &gt;he broke a few of madara's ribs then proceeded to roll over and die.  more than anyone else managed to do. He was going against what was basically a god and wasn't even considered kage-level before that      We got Sasuke saying in Part 1 that he would rather die trying to protect her than see her die and numerous other small hints.  So somehow he cares and then he doesn't fucking come home. The way Kishi writes it makes 0 sense.   kill her  To be fair most of the time he attacked her it was after she tried to do the same.   I would be pretty surprised if Sasuke just randomly "cheated" on her. Why? Whats the point for him? Since when does Sasuke care about Karin? If Karin is the mother then there must some kind of other explanation but its definitely possible.               Sakura   a jobber  That word doesn't mean what you think it means.      You asked for it.    cowtits. huge, disgusting cowtits    agoromo's powers against Madara who still managed to fuck their shit sideways Madara was getting fucked up by naruto and sauce before kaguya took his body. he legit ran away in fear to steal obitos rhinnigan because of how bad naruto and sasuke was fucking him up.      Sasori himself considers Sakura to have been part of the fight.       No one gets fucking banned for making these threads. No one but you and the janitor cares about the shitty standards of this dead board, retard-kun.  This board die the moment we let tumblr approved shows like Free and reddit meme shows like KLK and SnK on here. Naruto is just back on here again to shit on the corpse.           relevant to my interests     Yes, and?    It is. Pity the fandoms cannot stop comparing them and pitting them against each other.   Stop        more than anyone else managed to do  Except you know, naruto, sasuke, and black zetsu. And they did it WITHOUT HAVING TO DIE AS A SIDE EFFECT.    This chapter is just SSSfamily fun,im so glad    You sick mother fuckers...     Oh lord    Madara was backstabbed in the moment of his triumph after he regained both his original eyes      Come on, Sakura took out Hiruko, the third kazekage (that one by herself), several of Sasori's 100 puppets, hit him with the jutsu that got him to abandon his original puppet body and was the one that came up with the cure for Sasori's incurable poisons.  Hinata's fight against Pain didn't even last a panel.       If he made himself tangible. There is no reason for that.    Guy also had support during his fight with Madara who didn't bother to use any kind of Genjutsu etc.        Mitsuki is Stretch Armstong   Salad has a 1 tomoe sharingan and can punch things   Bolt is a prodigy who has shadow clones and has mastered a combination rasengan/chidori attack and has Ninja Jesuses 1+2 as his father and teacher   Thanks Kishi        Guy didn't die though  He was going to. He'll never walk again. so lets see get gud for less than time than an episode of spongebob and then never fight again, and if jesus isn't present you die. SHIT TIER   Madara is dead and didn't get what he wanted  Good.   Guy is still alive, and though he can't use his legs, he doesn't care because he can use his hands, so he's as happy as a clam.   He'll never be able to fight again. You can't be a good fighter if you die/permanently incapacitated in the process of getting gud.             If he made himself tangible. There is no reason for that.  Infused with the Juubi he just couldn't switch dimensions anymore    I'm disgusted by all of you I'm posting pure maiden Hinata  This chapter really seems like a snooze. At least the trailer was eventful.   Still, it'll be nice to see Salad in action, and not suffering. Even if all she does is kick a puppy and wet her panties when her deadbeat dad smiles at her.   I dunno. Maybe it'd be more impressive if we didn't know Bolt was cooking up electric nukes during recess.       Sasori also believes his puppets to be a part of him.    Come on, Sakura took out Hiruko, the third kazekage (that one by herself), several of Sasori's 100 puppets, hit him with the jutsu that got him to abandon his original puppet body  All masterminded and controlled by Chiyo.  and was the one that came up with the cure for Sasori's incurable poisons.  His poisons weren't incurable, just very lethal. Additionally, he changed them frequently specifically to avoid the problem of an antidote being developed.   Hinata's fight against Pain didn't even last a panel.  Still necessary for Naruto's victory.             Yeah and she totally didn't create that antidote as well that saved them.      He'll never be able to fight again. You can't be a good fighter if you die/permanently incapacitated in the process of getting gud.  He's still by far the strongest not-god in the series. What does it matter if yu die afterwards, there are probably 4 characters that would survive a fight against him     Now that was pretty impressive. She was always a better medic than she was a fighter.     Still necessary for Naruto's victory.  Do you seriously consider getting one-shot, stabbed, and Nagato neener-neenering Naruto into chimping out a proof of Hinata's superior fighting skills?     No, but I don't consider being thrown into retard punching position by Chiyo proof of Sakura's superior fighting skills either.    That moment of triumph achieved by running away and diverting naruto and sasukes attention. he would've gotten beaten anyway had black zetsu not killed him itself.    Which is why it was really dumb that Kaguya was a thing     So somehow he cares and then he doesn't fucking come home. The way Kishi writes it makes 0 sense.   It makes zero sense because Kishi wanted to write Sasuke being an absent father because of work, but didn't seem to be able to think of a better way to do it where Sasuke's complete lack of contact didn't appear self-imposed.   Since when does Sasuke care about Karin?   There were a few points before he went full darkness mode where he seemed to at least care about her as a comrade, hence why Karin was shocked when he stabbed her and called her useless. She even pointed out that he "changed," at that point. Not saying that there's much hints to the effect that he would finally return her feelings, but at least by the end, if Sasuke cared enough about Sakura to marry her, I don't see why he couldn't care enough about Karin. The idea of Sasuke showing any romantic or sexual interest in any woman is already a stretch of the imagination.   If Karin is the mother then there must some kind of other explanation but its definitely possible.   I mostly agree, I just wouldn't put Kishi having Sasuke actually sire an illegitimate child and then trying to play it off like all is forgiven because Sasuke did one good thing past him, is all.              Post more lewd Sakura and Hinata anon, it pleases my cock     That moment of triumph achieved by running away and diverting naruto and sasukes attention  So he should just let himself get beat up because he wasn't at his best before retrieving his second eye? Also, pic related is Madara getting beaten by Naruto and sauce  I mean, of course he would have been defeated, what would be the point otherwise. I'm just saying that he was a more dangerous opponent than Kaguya         He's still by far the strongest not-god in the series.   *provided he dies in ten minutes/never walks again if jesus is present  That's not how being good works anon. Even if God Guy could take every ninja jesus he still dies at a cost making the best he can get a draw. that's like saying suicide bombers are the best soldiers.      I dont have more lewd anon, but I have some cute    The third raikage died after facing off 10000 enemies. Minato died after protecting the village from the Kyuubi. They're still considered excellent fighters. Sure, he would die afterwards, that's why it's a last chance move. But if he died either way, he could still take out almost any opponent    So Kishi is going to NYCC? He ruined my life, I should go.    That pleases my heart too.    Winning isn't defeating the opponent, anon. Winning is when you protect something important to you. Guy won that fight by protecting the world.    They're considered excellent fighters because it took those things to kill them. Guy has to kill himself to git gud. not even comparable    I'm glad. Unfortunately this is the last one I have     All masterminded and controlled by Chiyo.   No. After the 3rd Kazekage is summoned and Chiyo loses her arm, Sakura starts fighting on her own.   &gt;and was the one that came up with the cure for Sasori's incurable poisons.   Chiyo says she is an expert on the topic and she can't do anything. Only Tsunade could possible come up with something.   Still necessary for Naruto's victory.   lol no              Is that by HAL?     she's great in The Last  She becomes a minor supporting cast member as a former teammate of Naruto. That is all her character ever merited and half the reason Kishi pushing muh Team 7 never worked, making people hate that cunt even more as he tried way after was of making us like her.   Gaiden  I take it you are into pathetic, mentally deranged wrecks? It's great laughing at a bad character get her comeuppance and moreso her awful fans getting butthurt, but Sakura herself has done fuck all but ruin her family home, faint, almost kill the one lead her supposed husband got in 12 years while desperately trying to stay relevant and then got kidnapped.  It's actually surprising she did not decide to start sacrificing her own organs so the bad guy survives without using up the children like people were speculating, but fuck it, even that would have shown some determination and sacrifice for others on her part. In the last chapter she just waits until the bad guy heals up, then announces she will wreck him, despite him being the only lead they have. Whether going for info or killing the bastard, she's done a shit job in a grand total of three panels.          Naruto was down and done before Hinata showed up. Without her, Naruto would have lost. Naruto himself considers this to be true.    I dont remember anon, sorry     Chiyo says she is an expert on the topic and she can't do anything. Only Tsunade could possible come up with something.   To save Kankurou. Sakura had enough skill to save Kankurou. But given enough time, anyone with poison knowledge could come up with an antidote. Congratulations, Sakura saved Kankurou.      Salad punches the ground and punts a Juubimon     Sasuke cared about Karin as a teammate but nothing else was ever shown.   For Sakura we at least got hints that show something more.   It makes no sense to turn this around suddenly.         ss fags are going to be insufferable this week   It's funny cause Sarada will be the next Hokage. She may be the first Female Useful Hokage.  Besides that Boruto seems to be a pretentious douchebah. His behavior is equal to that of the President's son being pissed cause his dad can't play Xbox One with him on the weekends cause he's too busy trying to stop ISIS.  Based Guy is the only dude worth fighting Madara. Everyone else is pure shit. I hated how Kishi shitted on all the potential the other clans and villages could have had for the UCHIHA 1337 EYE HAXS       Accompanying image.    yes    Then don't go to tumblr.   anything better   6/10 bait, but are you slightly frustrated that your Hibikek thread didn't get enough replies?     For Sakura we at least got hints that show something more.    Yeah, but not by such a huge margin as the SS fans may want to believe. All I'm saying is the now "greatest ninja" Sasuke who's been saved from his darkness caring just enough Karin to have sex with her one time but caring just a bit more about Sakura to actually make her his wife wouldn't feel too out of character for him, excusing of course the fact that Sasuke never showed anything close to a sex drive or a romantic interest in women at all and the most he gave Sakura from what we've actually seen was an Itachi headpoke.  And Kishi has made characters forgive Sasuke for a lot worse with a lot less believability.        Then how did sasuke get it? He doesn't have both halves.      But given enough time, anyone with poison knowledge could come up with an antidote.   Says who?  Chiyo said even as an expert she has no fucking clue what to do.  What good is an antidote if you need months to make one? Its useless. Your knowledge is useless. Only Sakura and Tsunade are able to properly cure the poison before the patient dies. They are extremely gifted and unique in that way.   Sakura also saved herself and Chiyo for some time which in turn saved Gaara (who is also somewhat important).             It might be due to the low res, but do Himawari's eyes look more lavender than blue? Did they just change them after The Last?   Can anyone TL what does it says?     Source? I checked his pixiv and I can't find it.     Kabuto used his snake penis to inject Senju dna inside him.    they will come here too, they have been waiting to shove sss family on /a/'s faces for weeks     What good is an antidote if you need months to make one? Its useless. Your knowledge is useless.  It helps for future poisonings. That's the whole reason Sasori rotates his poisons. Because they're not incurable.   Only Sakura and Tsunade are able to properly cure the poison before the patient dies. They are extremely gifted and unique in that way.  She saved everyone's favorite character, Kankurou.    Sakura also saved herself and Chiyo for some time which in turn saved Gaara (who is also somewhat important).   But again, she was only able to do this because it was 2-on-1.            Not sure. Bort looks similar on that page.    Uzumaki Himawari. Loves sunflowers. Hates her older brother for destroying her birthday cake when she was six years old.        It says her name, then presumably voice actor. Below, it says "Naruto and Hinata's daughter," then shit's too low res to make out. Then something about her dad.    It's honestly at too low of a resolution to tell, but her new outfit looks pretty cute.    Check his twitter.    Oh yea, I forgot about that part      Madara would've never been legitimately beaten by those two.     Watch when Himawari be the final boss of Naruto. All you fucks will be flipping your shit. You think she liked sunflowers? No she burns down sunflower fields, She has fire and Lighting Chakra nature. She has the Tensigan and studied the Hyuga Techniques in Chakra control.   This. There was no way anyone. Even KISHIMOTO himself could see how Madara would lose to Naruto and Sasuke. Madara was serious about turning Naruto into a badass Manga again and he wasn't going to let anyone get in his way.  Kishi's asspull is what stopped Madara. Madara was not wrong in anything he did. He was just too weak against the fucking writer of the story.       studied the Hyuga Techniques  Oh, no worries then, she'll be an useless jobber.     Ah. Thank you. I love his art style. Hopefully we get more for the movie.     muh jobber  are you the same dude that every thread says the same thing?    Have never read Naruto and only know this girl's name. So who is the most complex character?   The signs that it was a last minute decision were so obvious  The jutsu that Sasuke got from Hashirama was forgotten and ignored as was Tenten finding the Sage's tools.   Obito talked about how two Rinnegan would make Madara unstoppable so he just got replaced by a villain who only had Byakugan        I doubt one or two landwhales gloating about Sauce not being completely disgusted by being around Sakura can be as annoying as the NHfags constantly dumping fanart even during the middle of a chapter discussion.    Akamaru      Akamaru      Yes. Look out for "irrelevant side character" and "no development" also. Same asshole sakurafag every time.     Himawari takes over the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force from Ibiki   gets prisoners to confess using her S-rank Kawaii no Jutsu        Its enough to make Sasuke apparently marry Sakura and promise to come back + (a child?).  Sasuke also seemed confused as to what Sarada meant when she said Sakura wasn't her mom. Like he legitimately did not know what she could mean.  I just can't see him going back to Karin. Although MAYBE just maybe she was part of his redemption tour? I mean he almost killed her. Still can't see a random kid like that. Maybe Karin took a sample of his DNA or w/e.      Where does it say that Sasori rotates the poisons because they are curable? Where does it say that he does that frequently? It simply says he has a lot of them. It makes sense to use a different poison in different scenarios. Chiyo says she can't do anything.  She saved the people I listed that in turn save for example Naruo who saves the world.   The whole point is that she did it with Chiyo together. BOTH were important. Not that she did it alone.                        He is dying, anon, and there is nothing that can be done for him.    He is truly the greatest Hokage     All of Himawari's opponents suffer cardiac arrest and HNNG themselves to death.     This answer may be correct.    Karin was never more than a replacement like the rest of Taka.     Where does it say that Sasori rotates the poisons because they are curable? Where does it say that he does that frequently?  Because that's the only reason you'd need to stop using an incurable poison.   It simply says he has a lot of them. It makes sense to use a different poison in different scenarios.   Uh, no. If you have a poison that paralyzes and kills someone and is incurable, there is no reason to ever stop using it.   Chiyo says she can't do anything.  To save Kankurou   She saved the people I listed that in turn save for example Naruo who saves the world.  Hinata saved Naruto repeatedly, so she's saved the world repeatedly.   The whole point is that she did it with Chiyo together. BOTH were important. Not that she did it alone.  She won a 2-on-1 fight because the other guy decided to kill himself at the end.                  something about her taking after one of her parents, personality wise    Pretty sure animals in the naruto world live much longer than they do irl    you are not familiar with ss fags are you?     mfw Shino calls Kiba "Bakamaru" in Konoha Hiden       She's almost a fucking genin.  What were you expecting?    Does it matter? It's just Pierrot being inconsistent.  They still don't have any Byakugan.             Does it matter? It's just Pierrot being inconsistent.  Because it makes Naruto's children look more like his children and less like his clones.   They still don't have any Byakugan.  Why do you fucking harp on this?        Good for him that manage to score before his master.   Reminder that Hinata is aging magnificently and Sakura looks like a burlap sack.    What were you expecting?  Anon, the guy she wants to be rivals with is throwing fucking lightning bolts like he's Zeus and smacking rabbit gods in the face with Rasengan. She'll need to step it the fuck up in the next 6 months if she doesn't want to get left in the dust.      More?    Himawari will have the Byakugan (or psuedo byakugan) and fight like her mother + Rasengan   Burrito will fight like Naruto and Sasuke combined using shadow clones, chidori, and rasengan      Trying this hard     Boruto   chidori  No, he wont       IT'S THAT HYUUGA BLOODLINE, MAGGLE!!     I don't think either of them have Byakugan, anon, but I wouldn't be surprised if she learned some Hyuuga tech anyway. Maybe she'll get her own Twin Lions in the future.    watch the trailer, idiot     No, he wont     Watch the-   Oh shit he beat me to it.        &gt;Uzumaki Himawari. Loves sunflowers. Hates her older brother for destroying her birthday cake when she was six years old.   Wow. Reminds me of my family. I always ate all my sister's chocolate.      I would a Hiashi.    Sakurafag plz.     Thats not a chidori you retard, its a lightning rasengan        You cant control chidori without sharingan, kakashi told naruto that, boruto is using a lighting based resengan       Uzumaki longevity   Hyuuga aging  Himawari is going to be eternally young, isn't she?       Hates her older brother for destroying her birthday cake when she was six years old.   No, Sunflower your heart is supposed to be filled with kindness and love for all, not hate!     Isn't Pink Shit's stupid punching thing a modified medical technique anyway? Salad confirmed healslut of her team?  I mean I guess it kinda sucks for her, but this is Kishi. But hey, maybe she'll be competent at genjutsu thanks to her eyehax.    Watch its going to be revealed that since boruto and Himawari have diluded blood, that they'll activate their Byakugan similarly to the sharingan    Eh, Himawari is gonna be the most adorable 80 year old woman you've ever seen.    Show me THE most anime eyes there are in anime. I trust you all the most for this task    The pic he posted isn't the Rasengan. It's likely not a vanilla Chidori either, since it looks like he's throwing it.  Maybe that's it? He got around the tunnel vision by throwing the fucking thing instead, and then somehow added it to his Rasengan.      Spoiler anticipation  pic related, a time when we thought our boy doffy still had a chance    predictions for tonights chapter   option 1  filler chapter with reactions of everyone on the island to doffy being defeated, more flashbacks   option 2  same as above but with zoro and fujitora breaking the bird cage   option 3  same as above but with a major cliffhanger           Third for Bartolomeo next nakama.   There is no way a yonkous ship will be damaged by some cooks kick. The ship is their lifeline and has been made to withstand way more than that  imagine if it was as vulnerable to be taken out by kicks. Big mom would be laughed out of the new world.  Just like Luffy and the crew have an amazing ship so will big mom.  Look at the ship Moriah had and he is a no one.         How did JoJo defeat DIO?   DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?        <br/>    Coz dio never experienced thus like jotaro Jotaro was more experienced moving when others stopped time It was the first time for lord dio no sama      oh, thanks    It is explained in the fight itself. There is a reason why Jotaro used his time stop right after Dio's ninth second ended. Think about it.     DIO stops time   ROADAROLLADA   Jotaro manages to oraora himself out   ZA WARUDO hits its limit   STAHPLATNUM doesn't    DIO's left side heals slower than his right   DIO's left leg was recently knocked clean off   both knees just broken   JOTARO PUNCH to left knee   How do people not understand this shit. as far as asspulls go, this one at least makes sense.                DIO's left side heals slower than his right   DIO's left leg was recently knocked clean off   both knees just broken   JOTARO PUNCH to left knee   How do people not understand this shit. as far as asspulls go, this one at least makes sense.   I thought dio absorbing josephs blood finally made him complete since we know longer see the scar, without it, you just explained everything but with it , its just odd.        That final fight was bullshit the idea that two people have the same stand implies that they have an identical soul It would have been better if after absorbing Josephs blood Dio realized DahWurldoh had negative side effects that weren't apparent before. Jotaro picks up on this and renders DahWulrdoh useless, playing into the trope that when you understand the enemy stand you win This is why Jotaro is undefeated, you can understand his stand but still cant defend against it because it's brute force Then after everyone gets the fight they wanted to see, Star Platnum vs full OP vampire Dio Seriously, Dio never once used his laser eyes, tentacles or ice powers he had in Act I Would have been way better to see a classic Man vs Monster slug fest           More like, how did Dio heal Vanilla Ice when he chopped his own head off?      We don't see Jotaro escape but we do see blood beneath the machine use to crush him     more like, how vanilla ice needed to die again before he became a vampire and when he gt his own head chopped off and dio gave him his blood.    The undead shouldn't have stands in the first place A stand is a manifestation of soul or whatever and vampires/zombies are very lacking in that department      I dont know about dio but ice already had his stand . has it ever been said in any medium that vampires lose their soul?    He had Star Platinum bring him some tomatoes. Remember D'arby?    Why didn't DIO notice him escape since he wasn't frozen in time when Jotaro escaped?    Too busy muda muda and gloating, using up his two seconds in Jotaro's time stop   what I want to know is what the hell can you do in 2 secs? apparently jotaro can do alot.   I'm pretty sure in Phantom Blood they kinda talk about that when they introduce zombies    Pretty sure Jotaro was crushed before 9 seconds so he should have still been frozen   The 2 seconds later were for nothing       classic Man vs Monster slug fest  We already had that in part 1, how about some variety? You autists and your double standards are silly. "Monster of the week is shit, but I want every part to be exactly like part1/part2.     Dio brought people who had been dead for decades back to life.   Will part 2 get a print jojonium release in English? Everything I read only talks about it being released in digital    This is true    This is also true. I just assumed it was the work of his stand.         according to an extra little book araki wrote, vampirism is an early attempt at producing a stand. Vampires attain unique stand like abilities known as modes. Each vampire has their own unique ability much like a stand. The pillar men have the most obvious, but Dio had his unique ice ability, wired beck had his spike ability, etc.  The side effect of gaining these psuedo stands was becoming undead.   So i think its safe to say that vampires and zombies are capable of possessing a stand, since their abilities are rooted in stands to begin with.          Vanilla Ice is probably the best example.     Dont the ripple final objective was a full fledge stand?  I mean like being Spin counterpart, and Johnny getting Act 4 and Gyro Ballbreaker? Pls don't kill me because i thought of something     Reminder that the only people Dio killed were  Danny Joestar   a couple of chavs   George Joestar I   Dire   Jonathan Joestar   Noriaki Kakyoin   So just about as much as Kira. Kars and his Diavolo killed dozens more and Pucci literally killed the entire Part 6 cast save Emporio. Dio is one of the cleaner characters.           Didn't he treat a bunch of women like blood/sex cattle?    Dio have killed countless of people that aren't relevant to the story aswell.     Precure Thread     Not exactly the same, but when you talk about someone speaking Kansai dialect it's more likely that you're referring to the Osaka version than, say, the Kyoto version.      Sorta. Kansai is generally reserved for designating the geographic region or an accent, but you wouldn't really say someone "is Kansai" or "comes from Kansai", they'd be more likely to say what city they're from (at the limit, maybe which prefecture).      Urara also eats like crazy. She's very hard-working and focused which is why she had no friends.  I think she had another character trait, too, but it's been years and I can't remember.   Like you have a Southern accent, but you're from Virginia, not Southernia.

If you're being an autismal purist, at least take it all the way.    ‘Latin-derived languages can't share words’  Just because Italian and French share a large part of their respective vocabularies doesn't mean the term "Anime" is suddenly of Italian origin. By that logic you might as well say it's of English origin, or German origin.  tl;dr: Holy shit you're too autismal to be normal but too normal to be autistic.                 all of these Summer imports from r/anime who are extremely butthurt that they got called out on their newfaggotry so their only comeback is "a-autistic its f-french anyway   You're all very pathetic and not doing yourselves any favors.

Tatsuko is one of the best characters in this anime.  If only the entire series could have been like Operation Curry Sea...     That really was a great episode, too bad after that the FSN shit hit in hard.   It was a good episode stand-alone, yet in context to the entirety of the show, it was as bad as the Kongou episode. Also, angry at them being the only girls who got the towel treatment for their shower scene.        I actually laughed out loud during that cooking part.       We don't need this every day.  Now if you could tell that to all the generals and every other thread which is posted multiple times a day that would be fine.       Tfw Toroko actually made you cry   I should really not have felt as sad as I did with this episode...    Any part of any iteration of Danmachi   Anything above "decent"  No. The only part of that series that even has a chance at being good as Hestia doujin.      The only decent episode in Kancolle.     she knew she was slower than others   she didn't care that she was slow   all she wanted was to help her friends out the best she could   Fuck man GTO really hit at the heart a lot, not what I expected given the first episode was really off beat       Every episode was a 10/10    yet in context to the entirety of the show, it was as bad as the Kongou episode.  If anything, I'd say it was the opposite and it was the 2-3 totally serious episodes that soured everything and killed the show.     Best episode in this anime. If Kancolle was all like this, it would be AOTS.        the last episode of Hibike! Euphonium. It really hit home for me.

Would you a Reinyaa    but she's also the most talented one in the entire band  Reina can only dream of reaching her brilliance        but she's also the most talented one in the entire band  Most likely. I'm amazed that she is the only oboe and there is no drama based on her. She practically keeps the band together.     The second novel says otherwise     and there is no drama based on her  next season     I just can't see this girl with cold, dead eyes having any energy left in her to create drama.     Oboe chan has a solo part a solo part in Crescent Moon Dance, and probably has one in Providence of the Wind. Since the next episode is literally the music episode, they'll probably give her direct screen focus for when she plays.     She won't be the one creating it, someone else will set it off  but she will be the center of it     I'm going to marry Aoi chan and tell her she was right    next season   Never;_;     Shuuichi the Shitlord   You won't. I will.     She's a runaway bride waiting to happen.    Any more context about how? She has been just doing her job so far.   the Reina lines that weren't translated  Kumiko   What did you just say?   Hey   What did you mean by you were alone with Taki sensei?   hold on, listen, Kumiko!         Right about compensated dating bringing in much needed spending money?    You shut your whore mouth.    But I'm not Aoi.     I really hope we get a S2, then.  This world needs more Oboe-chan.      /u/fags BTFO yet again, how are they holding up?  So we're not getting any KyoAni before next winter season?   How dare you    This is probably the most normal both these girls have behaved in the entire show. Development.    Ribbons burns all of her reeds the night before the big concert so that there will be one less person who is more talented than Kaori in the performance.   Still best girls.   But it was hetfags that were BTFO by that scene. Reina was clearly jealous about her girlfriend Kumiko spending time with a man.     A novelfag said a while back that her friend is the one who got all the current second years riled up and got everyone to quit.       normal being good   ever     Who best girl here?   Oh yeah I remember that. But still can't see if that's enough to just base S2 around.  Oboe-chan looks fragile though     Oh ufo or some say eupho Do you hear our prayers Grant us gud Grant us gud       The fagotts are smiling because they know they're the best.    They'll probably announce their Fall show soon.    Oboe chan using those hard reeds, like a champion.    How can one section be so based?    It definitely helps that all three have great, unique designs, especially when comparing their section to the b-teams like the horns and clarinets.     Has this show sparked a musical interest in anybody else?  Actually listening to Oboe solos right now     well the second novel has may components, but it's the more SOL volume of the three  main focus is beating Kansai tournament    main drama is that Nozomi (girl with the flute) comes back and Mizore (Oboe), gets kind of unsettled because of last year's incident. They were best friends.   -Asuka is completely against Nozomi coming back to the club  large focus on Taki sensei's past since his university friends come as assistant advisers   This is padded out by  Reina and Kumiko hanging out more (another festival arc)   Reina stalking Taki sensei in her free time   everyone goes to the pool   band camp arc where things totally do not get kind of gay  -Reina going yandere when one of Taki sensei's friends from university is an extremely attractive woman that Taki gets along well with, whom everyone calls Taki sensei's girlfriend                Unique character desing   Good characteristics   Playing based instruments   Talented and have an ear for music  If anyone from the band is going to have a music career this section has the highest chance.        concert band   no keyboards at all   how common is this?       do not get kind of gay  Do they super gay?      no keyboards   Keyboards  What?      same here. Today I spotted a girl playing her oboe near my uni and I looked at her trough the window thinking to myself "she must be a fucking talented bitch".    muh harpsichord.     Getting interested in music because of a Chinese cartoon      Reina going yandere   What? what does she do?     I don't remember seeing the harpischord in orchestras that much let alone concert bands.    Piano?    I haven't picked up my Oboe since high school but I kind of want to give it a go and see if I can still play.     everyone goes to the pool  Please KyoAni. Please.     No. Last time KyoAni went to the pool, they redid it 8 times.    nah, that would honestly be too much fanservice.   eventhough i'd love to see sapphire-chan in sukumizu        a piece of entertainment influences a person's attitude towards something in life  oh no surely that is unheard of   if you don't like anime you probably shouldn't be on /a/, or at least don't project your inferiority complex regarding anime onto others        Reminder that Midori has always been shooting for the moon.     Asuka is completely against Nozomi coming back to the club  About time she voiced an opinion.     but that's a lie  she went to this school specifically so she could turn her tryhard mode off      What a slacker      I want to hear her play Gabriele's Oboe. What oboe solos are you listening to?     Oboe solo   Not listening to based fagott concertos       What are you a bunch of fagotts or something?     She's mastered music. Now she wants to have meaningful friendships instead of around a band of Asuka's all the time.    I just like onsen episodes more.    Best of the best. Taki must be proud of them.   I'm happy to see that even when horribly depressed, Kumiko has still got it   Concert bands by definition don't have pianos or other keyboards, except for special cases of solo instrumentation.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YHY<wbr>WAXFvs0Q</wbr>  [ ] OST preview    I'm surprised the sister's reaction was rather mild. She must've been a slacker.     No Funiculi Funicula  Why would you do this to me?     What can you say when you get btfo that hard by your imouto?    Slap the shit out of her?      Well at least I'm not completely flat.      She fell into the trap most band geeks fall into if they don't get gud, they're parents pull them out to focus on study so they can actually do something with their life. sis failed and is bitter and keeps taking it out on kumiko    Both fagotts are just 10/10 character designs    Risky card to play, given she was still flat in her third year   BASSOON-CHAN WHEN?

SOL series about fagotts doing fagott things never    Flute train coming through   Yuru Yuri?     Spin-off having the Double reed section as the main cast never  Why are you wasting such godly designs KyoAni?     Why, because she didn't stupidly let her daughters waste time and money in something that wasn't going to earn them a living when they get older? I mean, let's be real, Even through Kumiko is good, she's not professional level good, even through in the novels she wins nationals with her band and gets a man, that's not as good as a education.    No, I mean she's just not that cute.    BOTH FAGGOTS     SHIT     Shallow.   more background-fus  fang-chan best though     Amazing how all it takes is one good POMF~ to catapult a background girl from total obscurity to /a/ fame.     complete beginner   suddenly can play three instruments   playing at the tournament  TALENT       My thoughts exactly.    reimu a qt     Even through Kumiko is good, she's not professional level good,  She won nationals, that ostensibly makes her one of the best Eupho playing teenagers in Japan. Plus she's got two more years of high school to get even better. If Kitauji stays nationally competitive for those years I see no reason why she couldn't get into a good music program and pursue a professional career.     she's beating sticks on a surface I mean    You're making them unconfortable.Please leave.     band camp arc where things totally do not get kind of gay   How not kind of gay does it get?      Sometimes she bashes two things together.    If they win the nationals that makes her one of the best in her nation. She might even get offers from musicals schools if she wishes to go that way.   After Reina's confession I wonder how awkward it'll be for Taki to be around her. He'll probably leave Kitauji .   Sure thing, buddy.    I hope she does decide to try for a music school   Reina as some grade A autism eh    implying he doesn't already know       SLACKER SLUT     But after Reina confession she'll probably be more blunt around him, since she already let her feelings out so there's nothing to hide. she'll grab his ass and wink at him. he'll be scared shitless    [ReinForce] Hibike! Euphonium - Vol.1 (BDRip 1920x1080 x264 FLAC)   Time for my GEH fix.     Is Taki-sensei building a harem? He's had Reina, but Kumiko fell to his charms while they were alone.  Who's next?       The best background-fu is midori chan. The one with the big violin in case you didn't know.       me    Hazuki wants to bone him at least.     When will she find someone that loves her?       Reina is super special and acts aloof and socially detached   The second she thinks Kumiko is trying to take her man she drops that entire persona and is a jealous high school girl  I got a kick out of it. /u/ must be pretty pissed.     NO    No, they're in denial about this, too.    as soon as I find my way into the 2D realm    ;__;        all-band ahegao orgy doujin in 3.. 2..      Reina should drop the pretentious persona and just be super lovestruck stalking girl, she's more entertaining.    Isn't her love just precious?    this scene happens after dinner at band camp. Ribbon is wearing a fluffy parka and short pants and then suddenly Natsuki out of nowhere   Natsuki: Whats with that outfit? Why'd you choose that?   Ribbon: I don't want to hear that from someone wearing such a shitty t-shirt with a lame design  Natsuki is wearing a black t-shirt under her track suit  Natsuki: What's lame about my shirt?   Ribbon: That english on your shirt, it says "I am addicted to cement"   Natsuki: Look who's talking, that frilly logo on your pocket says "my staple food is love"   Ribbon: Stop speaking in english! This is Japan!   Natsuki: Aren't you the one who brought this up?   Ribbon: Shut up. What's that, is it possible that you want to care about me?   Natsuki: ugh, you're so creepy. I get goosebumps when you say weird stuff like that   Ribbon: That's it! It's time for another showdown!   Natsuki: ah, okay okay, You haven't learned your lesson yet from every other loss though.   Ribbon: I'm going to win this year. I'll be waiting in my room!   Natsuki: If you lose again this year, it's going to be so sad (smug sound)   Ribbon: Why won't this girl shut up? She's so annoying   Natsuki: I can't beat you in being the most annoying though   And then they went back to their room and  had a sit up competition  or so says Riko. They do this every time they go on a school trip because Natsuki and Ribbon always end up sharing a room.                       What? Reina clearly was jealous because her Kumiko was alone with a filthy lecherous man at night.  Yea.  That must be the reason, the sole reason.        There's just no stopping the flute train.    It's the worst joke in anime since Hyouka.     Ribbon: Stop speaking in english! This is Japan!  BANZAI     How can you even deny something that blatantly happened on screen?   I like the gap moe between borderline autistic and hyper dedicated musician and yandere stalker. I hope she wins the sensei.   Almost as precious as your dubs.   Is that what the false flag shitposters are going with?             I just realised ribbons' friend at the back is glad too.      it's not in the preview but it's in the OST  08.The Fairest of the Fair March   09.FUNICULI FUNICULA　演奏：立華高校吹奏楽部  all of these are supposedly the full versions too, played by the other schools though of course        "sit-up competition"   Good cover, Riko. Now nobody will ask about all the grunting and banging against the wall.    I wonder how sad this guy is going to be after next week   Since when can aloof and socially detached people not be jelly? Everybody gets jelly when someone's muscling in on their husbando.    Bless you Anon. Bless you.    but all they did was talk all night    Do you know what socially detached and aloof actually mean?    Hey Kumiko...you got a great ass.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dd_<wbr>X-C5g29o</wbr>  [ ]      that's basically how volume two goes. Reina only has her stoic and special look around Kumiko, but when Kumiko sees hwo Reina interacts when she's alone with Taki sensei, she's basically just any other highschool girl which is adorable.   THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS SAME THREAD THAT DON'T SHIP REINA X TAKI   Yes? And that they're not absolutes? Like, they can still care about certain things or people, and get jealous over them? She didn't exactly reign in her emotions after the audition incident.    I think he means that someone who's normally aloof to everyone else can be possessive with someone they care about.    She and Taki interact?     And then they went back to their room and had a   sit up competition   They do this every time they go on a school trip because Natsuki and Ribbon always end up sharing a room.  With secondary characters like these, I'm surprised Kyoani decided to turn to the main characters for yuribait. They should've just given Natsuki and Ribbons more screen-time.      How do you think she got her part back?    rip oboe, will be missed   Do we still hate Yuuko?    She didn't exactly reign in her emotions after the audition incident.  That's been painted as her sole focus from the start, and the way she acted out on that wasn't very "typical high school girl." The way she freaked out about sensei was abrupt and (until that point) out of character.     Asuka is actually longing for him in the novels, but doesn't act on it unlike Reina    No, we ship her    technically they did give Ribbon and Natsuki more screentime, in the first novel they barely interact because it's heavily focused on Kumiko. It's only in the second novel that Natsuki and Ribbon fool around like this. Their relationship is very canon though. One of the great things the anime did was just expand the first novel to include the whole cast. Hazuki became a casualty of this though    I was thinking about that    They are highly skilled, play a fucking weapon and still they are not only best girls but also best friends, who acknowledge and accept each other ability.    Simply amazing.         sit up competition  It didn't sound gay at all until this part.     Don't start that shit please.    That's good, because I love her  and also Natsuki .    She didn't really freak out though, it was just a mild sense of surprise and "what did you mean" questioning.   She loves music, and she loves Taki-sensei. I didn't find it out of character and at the end of the day while she might be weird and abrasive but she is in fact, still just another high school girl, but to each one's own.      I hope they don't get seperated in the university.     She didn't really freak out though  She did though, her brain shut down and entered TAKI-SENSEI mode.  Kumiko   Kumiko   what did you   kumiko   Taki-sensei           just looking at this worthless whore makes me mad.     every thread   your anger fuels me      Yes. But, less now that she's Ribbons favorite girl to bully.    Thank you based anon.    Now that Ribbons is Natsuki's favorite girl to bully*    So small and alone, yet so royal. No way I can hate her.     They're called bassoons, Anon. You'll embarass yourself in public if you ever call it a faggott.    I will say that enjoy that Ribbon's ribbons rise and fall like cat ears.    There's no hope for yuri now, is it?   God damn this scene was really cute.   What, no. Not even once I heard them being called bassoons   Anyone else think the show so far is really disappointing? I was hyped after every ep during the first 3-4 but now it's just shit.   Yeah that's pretty cute. It was great in this scene  (great timing anon)    no    Not really. It's pretty much exactly what I was expecting.   High school level drama   Band practice   Band drama          4:05   4:50   Can't fucking wait  ;;        But this last episode was one of the best if not the best.    No, it's been killed by friendship.    Even though the show has stayed consistently good, but the cancerous fanbase has ruined it for me.    Really? I don't know mang, forced autistic screaming in public tends to be overdone.    I like it more than I expected to. Probably an 8/10.    they will stay together, ri-right    Ignore the second link    Y-yeah!    I was kind of disappointed with the last one with the climax being kind of ruined with the cheesy line being repeated and almost all of the side characters barely showing up but everything else has been great.    If you want to be pendantic, the French version which has fallen somewhat out of use is called the bassoon, and the German is the Fagott. This is why you need to watch Nodame Cantabile.    We need distortion-kun to save us.   Reminder that Reina is old enough to marry Taki.   "Overdone" does not mean "shit."    This is not really correct. The modern fagott is based on the German system but it's still called a bassoon in some languages. The old French basson was a slightly different instrument, really just a few changes to the internal design.     everything else has been great.   I thought so too at the start, but right now I realized it's 1 ep left until the end and nothing has happened at all. Just boring shit. The Shoeitchy thing didn't develop too, it was just there and nothing happened. What's the point of the show even? They're gonna show the performance at the competition and that's it.      Her father will never agree to marry his daughter off to his middle-aged buddy. It would be awkward as fuck for the both of them.    Really? I don't know mang, forced autistic screaming in public tends to be shit.     They're gonna do band things   in an anime about a band?  dropped      You haven't been on Yahari, Fate or any other general right?   Also the cancer is pretty much IRC projecting.       Implying Reina won't kill her father and force her mother to sign the marriage license      nothing has happened at all      his middle-aged buddy   He's probably not even in his late 20s.   They didn't do any important band things at all. Just forced drama and average stuff.         There never was.     He's probably not even in his late 20s.  Taki is 34.     since summer break has started in the show, the first people who show up to school are Oboe and then Reina. Reina always goes to the staff room to get the room key from Taki sensei even though Oboe always beats her to it. One day during the summer, Reina invites Kumiko to practice with her in the morning so Kumiko does although she falls asleep several times along the way to school because Reina starts practice at 6am. So Reina goes to the staff room while Kumiko is watching and this happens   Reina: Excuse me  Taki sensei approaches the door with a coffee mug in hand  Taki: oh, you brought Oumae-san with you today  Taki sensei says with a smile on his face. Reina's cheeks rise slightly. She then swallows her spit and says in a more excited voice than usual  Reina: uhh, is the key for the band room here?   Taki: If it's the key you need, Mizore-san already came for it. I believe the room should be open right now   Reina: is that so? thank you  Reina quickly bows her head. Speechless, Kumiko sees that Reina is blushing so hard that even her ears are red  Taki: That being said, I truly appreciate how you're always here so early in the morning practicing   Reina: I do it because I like it   Taki: is that so? Well keep up that attitude then   Reina: I will!  Reina's response is so loud that Kumiko reflexively plugged her ears with her fingers. Then Kumiko wonders if Reina is being way too obvious about this all. Reina takes a deep breath and leaves the room, Kumiko follows behind her  Kumiko: Don't tell me that the reason why you always come so early is just to see Taki sensei?   Reina: it's not like that's the only reason I come early   Kumiko: hmmmm  Kumiko starts poking Reina's back. She can't see Reina's face right now but Reina is probably blushing  Kumiko: this part of you is pretty cute you know   Reina: idiot, it's not like that   and this is what Reina does when she's offscreen usually                           that type of anon that quotes something and attaches a shitty smug reaction image to his post   The worst.       forced drama  Ah I see so you're just memeposting then. Carry on.     Anon, I don't really care about the german or french name. This is a english imageboard, and it's called a bassoon in english. If I wanted to be pedantic though, I would just tell you to go read Korsakov's, Piston's, Cecil Forsyth's or Adler's orchestration manuals, and you'll see none of them use the term faggott.      Good thing it wasn't shit in this episode then.    I'm going to die. This is so cute. I need them to get together.  It hurts.  Bless you anon. I rabu you.        Just reply him with smug girls anon, he will go away.    Nice avatar you've got there fag.   Yep, it was mostly forced.       The show got progressively worse when the bait was ramped up.    Shitposting is met with shitposting anon.     Hey Taki my old pal, what have you been up to lately?   Pounding your daughter, bro!      Nah, you just have no arguments so you have to shitpost.      He looks fine as fuck if I were a 16 years old girl I'd suck his dick all day    I bet you'd suck any dick if you were a 16 year old girl.    if he's as cute and talented as taki then yes, maybe.    Will Kyaoni find a way?     Eating donuts in bed.   That's how you get ants.      hnnngggg qt/10       Eating donuts in bed   That's how babies are born.      She's so awkward around him, almost as if she didn't know him at all. I can't picture them calling each other by their first names outside of school without Reina fainting.   Typical straight girls in Japanese media.  The two of them should just fuck already.   shop reina and kumiko    who's this?    That's some Looney Tunes shit right there.     I-is that the only moment they got?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127125622  what's this game?    there is at least one more scene but the thing is that since Kumiko is the narrator in the novel, every scene needs to have Kumiko in it which kind of limits it. Reina and Sensei have scenes together offscreen but if Kumiko isn't there, we don't get to see it unless Reina talks about it.  Red String of Friendship.      Holy shit, anon, they look like potatoes there.    btfo   At what point will Shuuchi learn to accept the truth?   Who told you they call each other by first name?      oh /u/    kek    reina, I love euphonium    when Reina was little she would refer to him has onii-chan but I'm pretty sure as Reina grew up she doesnt do this anymore for her own health sake    Learn faggots, that's how a Reina in love would act.     Reina, I like the euphonium!   stop blogging and tell me about Taki sensei!      That would be embarrassing as fuck. Like accidentally calling your teacher mom.      Would she call Taki Oniichan during sex? Would Taki get turned on by that?    I want to smell Reina's shoes    I heard somewhere they were in first name basis outside of school. Is this true?    His wife used to call him that. It'd would just bring up bad memories.       Why is Hibiki selling mediocre in terms of KyoAni standards. I mean the BD sales are less than Amagi.    Because they scared away the self-insert bux    KyoAni is mostly popular among women now. Amagi had the perfect guy for them to drool for. Hibike hardly has any relevant guys.

Well, that's what you get for wasting your time with yuribaiting if you could've spent it instead with Reina stalking Taki and giving him more screentime in the process.    tell that to yurifags     Reina getting jelly is cute.

I wonder if I could have done that with my saxophone.   One time time I didn't play it for like a month and a half and it got moldy inside.         Was Asuka shocked when Taki told her to play the part by herself? Or did she take a moment to answer because she actually cares about Kumiko?     Never heard of sax players doing it. So don't.    How come the worst of autists all seem to love eggs?   this is soy sauce, I think   Shoe1 blow every chance he got, so het ending is now imposibru.  Meanwhile, we got during the show:  Red string of the fate   Tons of official art    Hot interactions between Reina and Kumiko   Hints in the OST   And even signs in the sky   Is by far more likely a yuri ending than an open one.             Who's that?     I never understood how that instrument worked. Seemed like the devil pipe or something.     Who doesn't think about a nice bowl of eggs every once and a while.         More like she was surprised for it being so abrupt, or even more likely, was just thinking how she should react not to sound like a jerk. She doesn't care about Kumiko or anyone besides herself to be shocked.    apparently they hang out in the specials  Is /u/ the reason why Euph fans suck?   Se can't stop thinking about her eggs.        We don't even know enough of her to say she's really good, or just hits the acceptable spot, since she's the only controbass player.       replying to 4h old bait with a disgustingly obvious shitpost of your own  You are the cancer    the fagotts card    you will never attend a performance by the kitauji quartet.     last episode and Terraria 1.3 come out on the same day  I'M GONNA CUM    I swear I love yurifags, they're so funny.    Wait, what the hell is wrong with their faces? What happened there?   I had a very weird dream about KyoAni announcing a new anime during next week's episode. It was about card battles and a red haired loli living in a japanese style house. There were a lot of ass shots and magic bullshit it looked pretty cool.   that was close Taki sensei   who would've thought Kumiko would come by so late at night       How can one girl be so beautiful? There should be a law.   Post your favorite bg characters    Nani sore? Nanka eroi...     You just did.     How can one girl be so special?     Should there still be a law?    Why does right fagott look so smug holy shit    the BD card version redrew the fagotts    I have conflicted feelings about this    No. She'd just end up breaking that law since she wants to be the specialest. Either arrest her now or don't pass any laws at all.     Girl on the right got a lot more smug.      Kumiko will never tap that       They made oboe their little bitch.    My background-fu got so fucking smug.  I love it.     finding out that they're the most popular in the band on /a/ made them more smug    It's fine.    Oboe-chan is the same. The two fagotts however got doyagao upgrades and now look like they're looking at the camera instead of at nothing.  S'not bad.      Oboe-chan got a slight upgrade too. New hair, eyes, slight smile.    Heh. Well they're the best might as well get a little smug.    the OST is so fucking good    You can tell from that image alone that the two of them have a bad and weird feeling that they're being watched. Or even worse: that someone, somewhere out there  is masturbating thinking of them in wedding dresses.     Welp you got me.     New hair, eyes,   Oh okay.  slight smile.  No, not really.      might as well post the clarinets too then   Jokes on them.  I'm in the wedding dress.    What's the name of the song they're doing for the competition.   Right fagott just became a 11/10 in design    Mikazuki no mai and Providence no Kaze.  Pay attention, Anon.      Required repertoire is Winds of Provence. Selected piece is Crescent Moon Dance, which is a fictional piece made for this show.     Damn how did I miss that thick megane photographer chick? Would date.     only one male amongst all those cute clarinet girls  You can tell he joined the band for the sole purpose of scoring as many clarinet cuties as possible.     Providence of the WInd https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rBM<wbr>E62reb5Y</wbr>  [ ]  and Crescent Moon Dance which is an original but they've made it throughout the second half https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=r_K<wbr>k9xhVkB8</wbr>  [ ] it's actually the song they play during the PV  deepest lore           Crescent Moon Dance  I will get the OST just for this. And Rydeen I guess.      There is something off about the left one. They took her reserved look out.     left  Yuri fujo intensifies     she's pretty qt    twintail Hazuki &gt; Everyone else     Second year with the fucking Saturn  I'll never get this. Why would you pose with the Saturn of all things?     Are you implying my cute femboy is interested in women?  I hope you're not implying that, Anonymous.     Shit I was already in love with Asuka, and I'm a photographer. I never would have expected to find a new bg girl six days before the show ends.    Hyouka reference maybe   Take all those Reina x Kumiko romantic 'hints' and throw it all into the trash. Kyoani's message was lound and clear, it was all yuribait all along. Now what you have left is Kumiko x Shuichi hints. Please dont pretend they dont exist because they do.   Cause she's out of this world? Maybe her true passion is science. There's no shortage of physicists with musical talent.     Who are you replying to?    for comparison     Cause she's out of this world?       I bet he has his own harem, generic rom com style and no one knows because everyones focused on the two autists and the cute teacher.     Right looks like a cheeky cunt now.    If you were Taki, would you tap Reina?   harem MC is Tanabe from the percussion section    Oboe girl looks like Ufo-kun, which in turn looks like Ayy Lmao.    why'd they change that one girl hand into a peace sign    No.  She should have nice healthy relationship with a boy her own age      I would make a schedule so that I could systemically distribute dickings to all the girls of the band before we reach (and ultimately fail) the Nationals.     to this faggot   my link got erased apparently     Oh yeah. He had a moment before that where he fell on some girl and he impregnated her accidentally.     tfw you're in an anime   so long, pepe      As someone who works as a teacher and is somewhat close to Taki's age, I would be flattered and tempted by the idea, given how attractive Reina is, but absolutely not. Even after she graduated, no. It would be wrong and scandalous, and likely damage the reputation of the school.    Teacher-student relationships always cause trouble for the administration.  But as soon as she would graduate I'd be all over that.       If she's not with Taki she won't be with anyone.    You have to consider that for Reina taki is much more than just her teacher. She didn't begin loving him when he became her sensei, her love comes from before. I'm sure Taki doesn't see her as just a student either.     It would be wrong and scandalous  Now you're getting it.     Only if I could obtain her father's consent.    it's a good thing Taki sensei and Reina's dad are drinking buddies then    They're pretty much the easiest thing to cook.    because she's a slut    He just has to give him pure vodka and they'd seal the deal.    You don't think I know that? But if I were to think back on the best loves of my life, there no way you can compare that sort of relationship with someone nearly 20 years younger than me. I'd sooner consider them a little sister than anything.   Besides, given a girl with a family situation like Reina's, I'd assume she was using me as a father replacement, anyway.        It's okay anon, just admit that you're gay, we won't judge you for it.    Eventually Reina will understand that her and Taki will never work. She'll meat a nice pianist in college, and look back fondly on her young crush.     I'd sooner consider them a little sister than anything.   surrogate daddy  You're not convincing anyone here anon.     Preview stills when?   exactly 29 hours and 50 minutes to go  until them, we must shitpost      It's been 11 weeks now, Anon. Why don't you know the answer to this yet.    I will    Well, reina is a pretty special girl and taki is a pretty special guy. I personally think it could work.     he waits for previews every week  Why are you slacking, Anon? Please, take things more seriously.    Pick five characters for your RPG entourage.   All the boys but Shuichi.    &gt;Life doesn't simply change when you move to a new school; it doesn't change because you are now in high school; it doesn't change even if you change your hairdo, or put on your skirts a bit higher than you used to or wish you had a slightly more attractive bosom. Kumiko starts to understand these simple things one by one and then she starts to realize that she has already started anew, with new friends, in a new club. But it simply wasn't enough. She needed a spark in her life. That spark turns out to be a rather reserved yet beautiful girl in the shape of Reina. Unaware of the fact that she is attracted towards Reina as she seeks for her company because Reina, in her eyes, probably possesses everything she ever yearned for. But then when she gets to know her more, and she realizes that Reina perhaps seeks her company as badly as she seeks hers, Kumiko begins to see herself as someone worthy of having a meaning just by existing. Probably that helps her to see herself in a new light. And everything that seemed dull, suddenly starts to look vivid. Reina gives the much needed spark for Kumiko and nothing plays a bigger role than their meeting that makes Kumiko realize that deep down, she always liked the boy who called her ugly.   I feel like this was the outline the author gave to kyoani.      I don't know why more guys don't join up. Then again, I've been in a situation where it's been just me and about 18 girls, and it wasn't as good as you'd think, so maybe I kind of understand.     Midori screams healbot.    Left tenor sax, Natsuki, Gotou, ringlets trombone Ojou-sama and that girl on the right of the alto saxophone card that looks like she'd beat my for my lunch money. If not left tenor sax, then Haruka.    Gotou would be the tank. Asuka would be a support character and the actual leader of the party. Kumiko and Reina are cute so I want them, no other reasons. Ribbons can be the healslut.      Gotou tank Midori heal Natsuki supporting by being best girl oboe mage Ribbon comic relief      hmmm, someone should clean the scans...    Reina gives the much needed spark for Kumiko and nothing plays a bigger role than their meeting that makes Kumiko realize that deep down, she always liked the boy who called her ugly.  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.p<wbr>hp/Main/AssPull</wbr>    Kumiko, reina, asuka. kaori, oboe-chan and trombone drills as my personal sex slaves.   KyoAni made the story better so if it ever gets a s2 we'll probably see how and why she fell for him    Do not reply to this post.    Oboe is a downer. You should just upgrade her for the blue fagott.     Keep crying. You're lucky that Kyoani decided to downplayed Kumiko's lust for Shuichi's corndog so they can pander to you faggots with obnoxious yuri baiting.      Oboe is basically Reina without the autism. I bet she's a sexual predator inside.      poop water, stop trying to deny it      Eventually Reina will understand that her and Taki will never work.  But it will. True rabu always prevails.       tfw you're enjoy your evening with friends and ribbons come and starts shouting next to you and towards your general direction    Jesus Christ, what has trumpet playing done to Ribbon's forearms?    Give her the old situps and she'll calm down.     implying Natsuki wasn't happy to spend the festival with Yuuko     Girl you like is crying   Yell at her instead of comforting her   Shuuichi is on a level beyond beta.        yellow ribbon   yellow shirt   WHAT DOES IT MEAN?         New character?   Yeah, wouldn't want it to be too easy. Shuichi's OP as fuck.    High school bands are more of a girl's thing in Japan. In one of the advertisement, it says "boys welcome too!".     Marin Karin   No, Midori, fucking no!              He probably didn't know she was crying considering they were on opposite sides of a busy street. Besides they're not quite on speaking terms again yet.     Besides they're not quite on speaking terms again yet.  They wordlessly made up while practicing at the river. If they weren't on speaking terms, Shuu would have more likely not bothered Kumiko from across the street.    Is Ribbon dead yet?   He knows that she seemingly got pulled off that particular part during practice. And he also knows she's screaming in the middle of the street.    everyone wants to go to Koushien     Asuka would be the support character   hey Asuka, can I get some buffs?   I really don't care if you get buffed or not   brb gonna play with my UFO  or maybe she could be a Bard I guess        REMOVE     expecting Shuuichi to run across a busy road while holding his wiener     Only retards still don't like her.   There is not enough Midori in this show at all. What the fuck.   Trollstuki&gt;milkshaketsuki&gt;sleeptsuk<wbr>i&gt;trytsuki</wbr>   Reminder that Kaori and Reina have now apologized to each other, while Ribbon has apologized to no one.    TFW there's no TakixReina art  it hurts    I am so fucking glad they didn't make Kumiko leaving her phone behind at school into a huge blown out drama thing, they just kept it quick and clean like they have been I nearly had a fucking heart attack when that shit happened   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;658841  why is Natsuki so perfect    this  revolutionary cuties should be on focus      watch Tamako Market if you want Midori    She's irrelevant throughout the whole novel s      fried pickles     watch BD special   the 4 main girls all interacting with each other   SOL   comedy  Guys...  I miss K-ON.         Midori's reaction to Kumiko nose bleeding   Midori's reaction to bleeding from her fingers  Midori is such a sweetie      soon!  but probably White Fox or something      white fox  I'll take it.      skirts   bikes   What is this madness       Orgasms.    I-I can't ride bike while wearing skirt?   Can anyone tell me who are the two girls next to Kumiko?    http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>04667  What are the specials?  </wbr>   Believe in KyoAni.         Damn it, I love her so much more than what is rational. I want more of her, yet I know long ago that isn't happening.          Get good you fucking scrub.    Shuichi, a real human being. Love that guy.     I envisioned him saying this in a sarcastic joking manner, like "nuh uh I'm gonna improve the mostest"   Just finished S1. Why is Hajime so perfect?      How does Hajime look anything like Satsuki or a loli?     Fatalpulse agreed, don't bother him about it.   Reminder that Joe has a gun that never actually saw any use, but it could potentially make a reappearance in S2.    Must resist urge to white knight.
