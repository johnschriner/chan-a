His character is so boring.  <br>It's true though. There is literally nothing interesting about LM.</br>  <br><br>There's no interesting character in this entire series besides troubles.</br></br>  <br>Levi is worse.</br>  <br>Why are you bringing up Levi? They're both the same amount of interesting.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>They're the only humans who can't be mindwiped.

Why would he make two main characters immune to memory altering? We're only half way through. A lot could happen. Keep an open mind, anon.</br>  <br>It is because they're shit</br>  <br>Mikasa is wallpaper too.</br>  <br>It will be just as relevant as him making Mikasa react to the name Kenny Ackermann.</br>  <br>This show is terrible.</br>  <br>Kek u gay.</br>  <br><br>Everything is terrible.</br></br>  <br><br> inb4 Armin is a secret Ackerman <br><br> inb4 Ackerclan: the clan of manlets </br></br></br></br>  <br>Armin would be the only likeable Ackerman.</br>  Half the characters are wallpaper  <br>It was only relevant in the past.

And it's not like she could've asked Levi about Kenny's surname because at he time he just found out himself. What else do you want from her? Mikasa and Kenny weren't closely related. It made more sense for Levi and Kenny to have screen time together because he was his uncle and knew him when he was a child.</br>  <br>Love me.</br>  <br>Whut?

You know, the usual faggotry in these threads.</br>  <br>Do want.</br>  <br>They're licensing the VNs in book format now? Cool.</br>  <br>Arminfags and butthurt LMshits. The usual.</br>  <br>EH hand holding as the cover Isayama hinted it</br>  Why are these threads so bad holy shit. Where the fuck is my Frodo when I need one?  <br>The only thing thats bad is Frodo.</br>  Translation of Isayama's comment on the live action movie:<br><br> When I was composing the story of Titans eating humans as a 19 years old, I thought “I want to make the story in ways like the professional story-makers would do.”<br> However of course there was no such an opportunity for me. I conveyed what I had in my mind with my unskillfulness and created the manga called “Shingeki no Kyojin”.<br> Many years have passed since then. When I was notified with the news of producing a Snk film, once again it occurred to me that “Isn’t this a great opportunity to have the professionals make a story of Titans eating humans?”<br> Therefore I boldly proposed several ideas that are different from the original story by myself, such as “Please jump out of the frames of the original manga”, “Human beings live in high-rise buildings” and “The protagonist is Jean”, etc.<br><br> They were not accepted as I expected. But I did hope film can be made with a broad vision.<br><br> I was invited to watch the two episodes of film prior to anyone else.<br> The horror and tension of Titans was so amazing. Besides it, the film also expressed the loveliness of Titans. I was super excited!<br> To make a film version of a work, I think it shouldn’t be merely copying the original one but should set the goal as making an interesting work.<br><br> And I think it might have been achieved by this film.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon. Good to know he enjoyed the movie.</br>  <br><br>What the hell?<br><br>When did the movie come out.<br>Where the fuck can i watch this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isayama got to watch before anybody else. He says he really liked it.</br>  <br>It's not out.</br>  <br>Annie &gt; Reiner &gt; Mikasa &gt; shit &gt; manlet &gt; Blort</br>  <br>It doesn't come out until August 1st. I think it's also premiering in LA a few days before Japan.</br>  <br>Of course he's going to say he likes the movie no matter what he really thought of it, it would be weird if he just went out and trashed it. That isn't to say he hated it, but you can't expect him to do anything but say he thought it was great.</br>  <br>So I assume Isayama prefers Jean as MC over Eren? kek</br>  <br><br><br>Why is Isayama such a selfish piece of shit.<br><br>If I was the director.<br>I'd just release it right now lmao.<br><br>I'm such a fucking saint holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>He probably thinks anyone would be a better MC.</br>  <br>I still wonder how Jean MC would work, though. He's not a special snowflake with super powers after all.</br>  <br>Mikasa why aren't you my girlfriend yet?</br>  <br>Because muh Eren, duh.</br>  <br>She isn't into beastiality.</br>  <br>will mikasa's cuckening ever end?</br>  <br>I don't think so. For snk-kind of story to work out you need an MC who is both completely cluesless of what's going on and have him be a special snowflake with special powers that can form a big threat to the enemy side.</br>  <br><br>Who wouldn't want to be with me?<br><br>I'm so fucking handsome .<br>Just look at my smile lmao.</br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck those producers and the director. All I wanted was jean to be the protagonist. But like always they ignore Isayama ideas and make their own shit  <br>This is your last warning, horseman. Be quiet.</br>  <br>So Jean wouldn't be a good MC either.</br>  <br>Hehe.<br><br>Did you miss me?</br></br></br>  Why is Eren's characterization so different in the anime compared to the manga?  HEY.<br><br>Where the FUCK is everyone?</br></br>  <br>fuck that was him being nice and polite, the movies must fucking suck</br>  <br>Who knows. Maybe he really liked it.</br>  <br>You scared everyone away because you didn't shut up.</br>  <br>that sounded like grrm praising s3, except isayama didn't explicitly say but hey remember the books and the movies are way different like the books don't suck how many children did scarlet have let me count my money</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1l278xJaOcm</br>  <br>Stannisfags BTFO even harder in the finale</br>  <br>Look mikasafag I know you love Jean so stop acting all tsundare about it</br>  any spoilers yet mates?  <br>Wait for about 4days</br>  <br>Read the fucking thread. If there were spoilers yet, we'd be talking about them.</br>  <br>Yh their were spoilers but they got deleted <br>It showed hanji trying to create tanks</br></br>    <br>Is she holding a baby?</br>  <br>Is there already a trailer for part 2?</br>  <br>That's really creepy. Maybe I'd watch the movie for the titans.</br>  why do you guys think they added pic related in the anime?<br><br>maybe they could be related somehow?</br></br>  <br>foreshadowing erwin vs eren</br>  <br>To make Erwin look badass.</br>  <br>Just to make him look cool when he stood there while everyone else ran away. How would that even imply that they're related?</br>  <br>looks like she's reaching out to Erwin and she was just having flashbacks of her dad</br>  <br>kek so dumb</br>  <br>She wasn't reaching out to him. Eren ripped off her arm.</br>  <br><br>Not saying he's right, but that was some coincidence. There's also some pic with all the Erwin/Annie paralels in the manga lost in the archives.</br></br>  <br>It's because Erwin is stealing Annie's dad's advice from Annie</br>  <br>Why would I read the whole shitposting thread when I can simply ask? Shitposters are all around this thread so no point of reading...</br>  <br>Is that movie supposed to be horror?</br>  <br> these are the people that go on here </br>  <br>I want to kiss his nose.</br>  To all the faggots who say Erwin has no emotions, here you have Ono Daisuke who explains it for you deadbrain fags.<br>  After that, Ono’s thinking changed. Rather than a mysterious and cool person without any passion, he believes Erwin has so much emotion that it’s difficult for people to see it. “The amplitude of his emotions is so great that to those around him it looks as if the needle isn’t moving at all.” </br>  <br>So they're as delusional as us in the end.</br>  <br>A seiyuu's fanfiction to justify how emotionless he is isn't proof of anything,</br>  <br>Bert drawfag?<br><br><br>Milf-chan?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was talking about the recap movie, which is before the political arc in the manga where Erwin really showcases more emotion. He says it's Armin's words that helped him better understand and play Erwin.</br>  <br>Also, ErwL confirmed canon.<br>  The interviewer then asks Ono if his understanding of Erwin changed at all after portraying him in the Choice With No Regrets OAD. He suggests that understanding Levi is understanding about Erwin, too. “[ACWNR] is the story of why Levi joins the Survey Corps, so we don’t know yet about Erwin. Nonetheless, Levi is a person who becomes a significant part of Erwin’s flesh and blood, so learning about him became very rewarding [for me].” </br></br>  <br>I missed you Jean-kun. Take care.</br>  <br>The parallels are interesting but it doesn't mean they're related. They're just showcasing some of snk's themes.<br><br><br>Manlet pls. It just means Levi's a good gauge because his actions are an extension of Erwin's orders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still not more valid than anything you read here, it's his interpretation of Erwin's character.</br>  <br> Then why did Isayama waste time bringing it up? <br>Because it explains a lot of backstory. Theirs, the world's, etc. <br><br>I won't mind if it comes up later but if it doesn't there wasn't much wasted, it already served a purpose.</br></br></br></br>   do you still remember me /a/?

Which failed because I was buying the manga before the anime started.</br></br></br>    did they other thread die ?  <br>Sank last I saw</br>  <br>awe i made a friend in that thread</br>  So is this a proper series or is it one of those advertisement 8-minute trash?<br><br>Should I just read the source material?</br></br>  <br>Maybe you'll meet each other again in the near future, Anon</br>  <br>It is advertisement 8 minute trash, the character designs are better and the manga-ka was a former hentai artist.</br>   Okusama ga Seito Kaichou! 01 @ Edit / TS / Still Fapping <br>DDY please stop fapping</br>  <br> the manga-ka was a former hentai artist. <br>Picked up.</br></br>  <br>I thought she's an ara ara old hag, but then I read the synopsis.</br>  <br>They've really been going at it. They'll get rug burn on their dick if they keep going</br>  this is already happening in the first episode?<br><br>picked up</br></br>  <br>It is basically the same as the original manga.</br>  <br>Since the whole marriage thing seems a bit ridiculous from the start I can also have ridiculous hope that Rin will win right? Or at least a 3-way end? <br><br>r-right?</br></br></br>  <br>Which studio is this ?</br>  <br>Rin has more of a chance in Chapter 40 than she did when she was introduced. At least in the newer chapters Hayato is aware of how cute, sexy, nice, and kind she is. She also has a good friendship and rivalry going on with Ui, where they help each other while trying to one up each other.<br><br>With that said, the manga is called "My Wife is Student Council President" not my "My Wife is the head of the Discipline Committee." So unless Nakata Yumi throws a huge ass curveball and Rin gets elected Student Council president, Rin will not win.</br></br></br>  <br> So unless Nakata Yumi throws a huge ass curveball and Rin gets elected Student Council president <br>Oh fuck that's hilarious. I could see an election arc as the finale  with the MC winning at the very end as tweest. </br></br>   The manga is over 1000 pages of cute high school wife shenanigans  <br>God bless Japan and how hard they cater to my dick.</br>  <br>What's he doing?</br>  <br><br>She got bit by a snake and he's sucking out the poison</br></br>  <br>Checking for lumps. Breast cancer isn't a fucking joke man.</br>  <br>Well, if they did that, it would be open ending where no one wins. It would actually be kind of funny because Hayato does the cooking, cleaning, and general housework, so he is actually kind of the wife in the relationship with Ui.<br><br> Though it wouldn't work with Rin since she is the one cooking and cleaning after her sister. Though she admits that Hayato is better than her in some ways <br><br><br>Sorry to disappoint you, but Rin becomes a main character and cockblocks Ui with a ton of her own fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it would be open ending where no one wins <br>It could go both ways. Where he actually chooses one after he wins.</br></br>  <br>that looks way the fuck cuter than OP. Need to read this now for sure.</br>  <br>After being around Rin a lot he starts developing a huge attraction to big boobs. He also starts noticing her other qualities and that she isn't just a walking pair of big tits.<br><br>Which makes Rin like him more since behind his ogling, he actually cares about her.</br></br></br>  god if rin doesn't win i will kill myself<br>either that or her older sister</br>  <br>You know what? Good for this guy. It's rare we get a protag willing to suck on some available tits right out the gate.</br>  Picked up.  nigger the fuck aren't there subs yet<br>what is this shit</br>  <br>I was going to pick this up just based on the premise and initial synopsis, but this is a whole new level of adorable lewdness. Forget just picking this up, I might fucking BUY it.<br><br> captcha asks to select all images with cakes <br> itt </br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait for DDY if you don't want the streamrips that'll inevitably go up, though of course DDY doesn't have a translator assigned to this, it'll be a stream script edit with typesetting. RAWs are already up, so give it a day or two for them to work shit out and put their release out.</br>   all these people who aren't reading the manga <br>source material is usually always best so don't ignore it</br>  <br>Anon, I can't bury you over the internet.</br>  It's so sad that the one anime I've actually read the manga for before it's aired is a fucking ecchi.  <br>I can't wait for minamoto-kun monogatari good god that will be glorious</br>  <br>Looks like Rin has more fans than I thought. Here I expected to be the outlier. Like many, I started because of the antics of Ui and Hayato. When Rin appeared, I didn't like her, but after 40 chapters she is the only reason I still read the manga.</br>  <br> It's so sad <br><br>It's a nice thing to me.</br></br></br>  <br>That's getting an anime? Fuck me it's gonna need like a dozen seasons to cover that shit. Shit moves so fucking slowly.</br>  <br>Nigger, they've TL'd it already. <br><br><br><br>I've got one hand refreshing their website and the other lightly stroking my dick to keep it at half mast, waiting for the subs to come out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it doesn't have one yet. But I don't think it will be too long before it gets one</br>  <br> streamrips <br>It's one step short of uncensored hentai, neither CR nor Funi will have the balls to touch it. Only fansubs can save this show.</br></br>  <br>What is sad is that the crappy anime art doesn't touch the awesome manga art. Also, it is a 10 minute anime so it is clearly aimed to sell more manga, which is good side the manga sells poorly for such a good manga (in Japan)<br><br>The manga was close to getting cancelled, so this is nice.</br></br></br>  <br> 10 minute anime <br>fuck this shit<br>im out</br></br></br>  <br><br>newshit central</br></br>  <br>The manga is just so much better anyways.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this is not allowed on this board...</br>  <br>no nipples are visible faggot<br>areola don't count</br></br>  <br><br>It's 8 minutes.</br></br>  <br>the hype is dead</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127469355 <br>Okay, but one of their TLCs could have just agreed to TL it.<br>Fansubbing isn't some sort of professional job -- things can and do change at a whim all the time.<br><br>This is how the conversation likely went:<br>"Okay so a simulcast still isn't up. X guy on TLC, wanna translate it?"<br>"Let me watch the show and see if I want to do it."<br>Time passes.<br>"Yeah alright, I'll do it."<br><br>Bam, done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I need more of this</br>  <br>I stand corrected but was late in scrubbing my post.

My boner is now having a boner.</br>  Isn't this the first episode!?<br>What the hell.</br>  <br>Consider suicide.</br>  This seems like the kind of anime I don't need subs for  <br>My dad plans to watch this on the assumption that it will be a lighthearted comedy just like I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying.<br><br>I didn't have the heart to tell him otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>There's Wakako-zake for that.</br>  <br>He knows exactly what it is, he just doesn't want you to look down on him</br>  <br>Since when young boys don't like sucking their gfs tits?</br>  <br> My dad <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>The anime looks good stop shitposting.</br>  Subs when?  <br>Who is Jon Stewart, WHO is he? who knows him? not even his mother knows who he is</br>  <br><br>Fansubbing has been a thing since at least... the late 80's. If you were in the anime fansub fandom at that time, let's say 18 years, you'd be 45 years old today.

Pretty standard yet bonerific romcom. Ui (I swear looks like Shinobu from Love Hina) and Misato are cute.<br><br><br><br>I did see nakata yumi's works on sadpanda. was this (http://exhentai.org/g/20217/94a4e5<wbr>fc16/) one an alternative version of the manga before the supposed revamp, a mistagged work, or something else I'm not catching</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not enough of them are translated.</br>  I feel like this sums up most reactions to this episode.  <br>Hah.<br>No.</br></br>  <br> Would you have kids with me, then </br>  <br> Hah. <br> No. </br></br>  <br> ;_; </br>  <br>Mori, how could you break an anon's heart like that.</br>  <br>Just scroll up, you'll see exactly how I did it.</br>  <br>Oh, I see. Thanks for explaining.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why is this so goddamn funny. Holy shit I can't stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry Tyrone we will never see a proper Okusan series animated</br>  I can't believe people honestly prefer Rin to Ui. I'm not saying Rin is all that bad, but Ui is far cuter. Ui also feels like an actual character and not just generic tsundere #7586  <br>What I can't believe is people thinking Rin has any chance of winning only because she's the heroine rival.<br><br> Rin has more of a chance in Chapter 40 than she did when she was introduced <br><br>Of course, it's a fucking love triangle but in the end she'll lose. Hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ui also feels like an actual character <br>Like an early middleschooler maybe.</br></br>  <br>No wonder she;s into anal</br>  Reminder they will never ever fuck in the manga  <br>Do Japanese women like having fat asses?<br> slim figure <br> cute hair <br> cute face with/without make up <br> THICK FUCKING ASS  <br>I'm already dripping, too bad this doesn't exist unless she has a black parent or something</br></br></br></br></br></br>   subs never   <br>Please, we already know DameDesuYo is pretty bad but translating an 8 minutes show is still a challenge for any subber.</br>    <br>So, you're not going to watch it then?</br>  <br>Will DameDesuYo is actually going to do a timely release for this? <br><br>They still haven't released Anime de Wakaru Shinryounaika above episode 6 despite it's a 5 minutes show. Thankfully CR/HS exists for that show.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, they are pretty unreliable in terms of quality so I tend to avoid them but Anime de Wakaru was an editing/typesetting nightmare, which may be the reason why they ended up dropping it.<br><br>In any case, the anime will cover everything that's been scanlated so I guess you could read the manga and watch the raws.</br></br></br>  Where's the lactation  <br>This was actually the first show I watched raw. Felt weird and I barely caught half of what was said but it felt nice to see the start of the new season with everyone else.</br>  <br> dropping it. <br>They've always announced when they've dropped something. So more like permanently stalled.<br>Though it took them 18 months to do that show with the flags, so who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>Arata did something similar to 8 girls while the others watched</br>  <br>Picked up. FUCKING PICKED UP.<br><br> j/k I will watch this when the BD is released and only when this is decent enough. </br></br></br>   picked it up thinking it's just a cute, short anime about wife shenanigans <br> he touches her breast <br> that's okay I suppose <br> mfw it escalated to full blown breast sucking <br>I'm not complaining or anything, but god damn that caught me by surprise.<br><br>Off to reading the manga I go</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I will watch this when the BD is released <br>Why?

Maybe Texas time, too, but certainly not Euro time.</br>  <br>Is that a good thing or a bad thing, should I have not posted my crappy picture of the newest Okusama chapter?<br><br><br>Comic Rex is a shonen manga, they actually edit Okusama in the manga anthology and the tanks are uncut. So the final manga will be raunchier than what I am seeing right now in Comic Rex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Philippines?</br>  <br><br>Did you guys mix this up with his other work? Oku-sama wa Seito Kaichou?<br><br>Note: Not be confused with the later work with a slightly similar name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter?</br>  <br>Her, the author is female. I remember reading that she is quite beautiful, which is hilarious because of her dirty manga. <br><br>She is a good friend of the manga-ka of High School Girls.</br></br></br>  <br>26.</br>  <br>mwee?</br>  <br>I mean that for Rin.<br><br>Post more, my copy still hasn't arrived.</br></br></br>  <br> can I become a good wife </br>   there is people IN THIS THREAD that like the generic tittymonster <br>It's not like there are like 10 other manga where the president of the rival club/organization lusts for the MC.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Nice meymeyarrows, bro</br>  <br>Mujaki no Rakuen will  hopefully  do it</br>  <br>They're both tittymonsters.</br>    <br>Oh and I forgot to say this. The context of the photo was from Chapter 40 of Okusama<br><br>Summary<br> <br>-It is Hayato's birthday, and Rin is at a loss of what to buy him<br>-She goes to her sister for advice, and her sister goes into a rant about how sex works, freaking out Rin.<br>-Rin sees Ui in the hallway, and Ui decides to help her buy Hayato's present<br>-Ui points out that Rin's greatest asset are her huge boobs<br>-So Ui forces Rin to the lingerie section and tries on Babydoll underwear<br>-Ui gets irritated that it looks so good on Rin and she tries some on too. It ends up being a disaster<br>-They both end up buying Hayato a shirt for his birthday<br>-He thanks Rin and Ui together, and Ui gets uncomfortable that Rin is getting closer to Hayato.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br> Beautiful people can't be perverts <br>That's bullshit<br><br>Proof:  myself </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup, Ui has big boobs (around E-Cup-ish), Rin has bigger boobs (G Cup)<br><br>The only reason why Ui looks small(er) is because she has Rin as her rival, when she really has big boobs herself.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, I so want to feel my fingers sinking in them Rins</br>  <br>Oops, forgot to post pic.<br><br>Ui has big boobs too, Rin's just outclass her by 2 cup sizes.</br></br></br>  <br>was this on found on sukebe.nyaa?</br>  <br>Hayato did, and because of it he started getting obsessed with big boobs. To the disappointment of Ui who feels so inadequate next to Rin.<br><br> In volume 7 Rin and Ui find Hayato's porn collection on his computer, and to Ui's dismay, and to Rin's pleasure, they find that he has a big collection of porn featuring big breasted women. Since then Rin has been less shy and more aggressive in going after Hayato.<br><br>Which is why if you like Rin, the newer volumes is awesome because she gets a lot more fanservice.</br></br> </br></br></br>  how do we get this animation studio on a full episode ecchi?  <br>Call Xebec</br>  <br>Absolutely fantastic</br>  <br>Xebec are too damn scared to show nipple sucking as TLR proves. Call up Production IMS.</br>  <br>Yeah, so that's why even if Rin loses (almost certain), it is a great ride because Rin becomes a lot more aggressive and the series gets raunchier than the first couple of volumes.<br><br>Rin realizes that Hayato has feelings for her too, and so she uses her assets (big boobs) to her advantage when she can.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I'm not sure this is a series where they'll go for a single winner (if any)</br>  <br> Production IMS <br>Only if you want to wait months for the BDs to make anything visable.</br></br>  <br> wanting QUALITY <br>I haven't even watched Shinmai BDs yet, just don't think it's worth it.<br> That said I still like IMS because they did Twintails. </br></br></br>  <br>Someone should call PoRO to make animate and ecchi anime series.</br>  <br> TV anime with PoRoface <br><br>No thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Hayato is definitely has a thing for both Ui and Rin now. Ui notices that Rin is starting to get more attention from Hayato. Rin realizes that she has a lot of advantages with Hayato that Ui doesn't have. Rin is also a lot more aggressive in trying to go after Hayato.<br><br>So either having either a Ui or Rin end would be hard, since Rin has developed a huge following (pun intended) in Japan for the manga readers. There are also those who like Ui's personality more. <br><br>I see either a stalemate where no one wins. There is also the possibility where there could be two winners, since Rin and Ui have developed a good friendship, so "sharing" Hayato could be a possibility.</br></br></br></br></br>   Chapter 23 <br>Muh dick</br>  <br>Come on, the winner is basically spelled in the title.</br>  <br>Are the raws available somewhere?<br> I think the fucking post stole my shipment again and it's still a month till I get back to Japan <br><br><br>It doesn't always work like that. Also, Ui can be his wife while Rin is his concubine</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They could always pull a big plot twist and have Rin become student council president.<br><br><br>Nope, I also subscribe to Comic Rex, so I am getting it from the newest issues. There is no Okusama in the newest edition. <br><br>Guess Yumi Nakata is busy doing cover art and promotional art for volume 8 and working on chapter 41 to publish it in this month's edition. I think Rin will be on the cover for volume 8, which is cool since the last time she got a cover, she got a really racy one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is total otaku trash and i'm falling for it.  <br>To be fair, the lead character is an awesome guy and you can't help but want Ui or Rin to get him since he is such a good catch.</br>  <br>Pretty much every ecchi anime then with few exceptions.<br><br><br>Watch the OVA at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> yfw thats not a hentai </br></br>  <br>Ooh la la. You really know how to get my attention, anonymous.</br>  <br>What's wrong with their face? Their animation quality is good, so it's all good.</br>  <br> I see either a stalemate where no one wins. <br>Ui has the default advantage, has title of manga, is living with MC, is one with the promise. <br>When push comes to shove there is no way the MC will be picking Rin realistically.<br>The longer this goes on the saltier the fanbase is going to get, the author is a baiter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is a shonen, think about that for a second. It is aimed at middle school and high schoolers. <br><br>Which probably explains why Rin's boobs are far bigger than the big breasted rival in her Seinen Manga. I mean, Ui's boobs are bigger and the buxom rival in her Seinen series. To be fair, her seinen series is far more raunchy than Okusama.</br></br></br>  <br>I will gladly take the salty ending because it is a fun ride, Rin's fanservice is almost up to Ui level, so it makes it worth it. You can always pretend the last chapters didn't happen (like Negima)</br>  <br>Is that Rin?<br>The drawing looks a bit rough</br></br>  <br>No, that is the buxom rival in her Seinen series (which is also a love triangle)<br><br>I just wanted to illustrate that both Ui and Rin has bigger boobs in the Shonen series than her seinen one.</br></br></br>   Ayana doing lewd sounds <br>Yes!<br><br>Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>No, Rin puts all the other Nakata Yumi women to shame. That isn't Rin.</br>  <br>Stop lying anon.<br><br>We all know that you are not  a pervert, only beautiful </br></br></br>  <br>So big boobs confirmed as a fetish for children?</br>  <br>More like they gave Rin and Ui unrealistic proportions (at least for most women) while in the Seinen manga the sizes are a little bit closer to reality.</br>  <br>But you already had Ako doing lewd.</br>  meh<br>sucking nipples in Japan is like saying hello in occident</br>  <br>I wasn't expecting that, a bit lewd sure but not that.<br>I wasn't disappointed though, just surprised a good kind of surprised.</br></br>  https://www.mangaupdates.com/author<wbr>s.html?id=6244<br><br> Female </br></br></wbr>  <br>Is this her?</br>  <br>If it is then she's pretty good looking.</br>  <br> making a fuss over this shit <br><br>Qwaser did it first and better too</br></br></br>  <br> Qwaser <br>Too cowtits for my taste</br></br>  <br><br>Yup that's her, Former hentai artist, not manga-ka for Okusama Ga Seito Kaichou. She does a lot of fan signings in Japan and draws chibis of your favorite characters.</br></br>  <br>Oops, I means to say "now manga-ka"</br>  <br>Damn! What chapter is that in?</br>  Someone tell me twintail-chan gets lewd  How come spanish subs are already out but not english ?  <br>Nope, only the titty monsters Ui and Rin.</br>  <br>Well, go fuck yourself and everything, DFC-chan ;_;</br>  <br>Nigga is you serious.</br>  <br><br>Because you didn't search Nyaa.</br></br>   there actually are people who believe rin has any chance of winning <br><br>Really, guys?</br></br>   not reading her other manga in the meantime <br>I SERIOUSLY hope you guys don't do this.</br>  <br>I know DDY's subs tend to be Engrish-y but that's a harsh insult Anon.</br>  <br> No subs <br>Who do I gotta smack to get some goddamn English subs?</br></br>  <br>Texas has 2 times partner.</br>  <br> sensiblechuckle.gif </br>  <br>No real character development (well what do you expect for 8minutes), humour or storytelling about it, just a bit of unfunny hentai really, not even giving it 3 episode rule, dropped</br>   the other members of the student council get no lewds <br>this is dissapointing</br>  <br>They have like one or two chapters each. It's something.</br>  <br>From the title I was hoping this was going to be a middle aged man with a high school wife. I am really disappointed. I bet that shit happens in japan all the time why can't they just make an anime about it</br>  <br>Yeah, her name is not on the title.<br><br>She is fucked, not literally. They will probably introduce another guy to woo her over.</br></br></br>  <br>This reminds me of that hentai manga with the guy and his loli wife.</br>  <br>She has as many chances as  Onodera. </br>  <br>good trigger</br>  <br>Which was my jam.<br> fucking a pregnant loli wife <br>That shit is so rare to find</br></br></br>  <br>RIP.</br>  <br>I feel ya bro.</br>  <br>If it is anything like any previous manga, they will introduce some ran dome dude 80% into the series. Rin will ask him for help getting Hayato, she falls in love with him and BAM, Ui will have Hayato all to herself.</br>  Aren't the manga sales really poor anyway? If the anime doesn't help them I can't see it going for many more volumes.  <br>Yeah, it is suprisingly not that popular in Japan. If the Anime doesn't increase manga sales, it will get cancelled soon.</br>  <br>Just a bit</br>  Why does it have such high production value wtf.  <br>You telling me it should look like shit? I'm glad it doesn't.</br>  <br>Actually, I just saw on the Twitter that おくさまが生徒会長! Volume 1 is getting a reprint. So it might be helping sales already.<br><br>Which means the anime might actually give the the manga a second chance of life.</br></br></br>  <br>Arranged marriage is still a thing in the east.</br>  <br>The reprints are always planned pre-anime in order to have copies ready in case the anime gathers some interest. We'll have to wait for the actual sales reports.</br>  <br> wtf </br>  <br> Rin was always designed to be the rival. <br>Still she is going to lose and you know it.<br><br>I'm every girl fag though, so I don't care at all who wins here.</br></br></br></br>  That was a solid 8 minutes of my dick gradually getting more erect<br><br>No idea what the plot was but 10/10 AOTS</br></br>  <br>As has been stated many times, Rin was designed to add conflict in the storyline. If she wasn't there, the series would be 3 volumes long and long forgotten.</br>    I love President's voice.<br><br><br>What the heck, you monster.</br></br></br>  <br>wtf is wrong?</br>   last translated chapter is a possible NTR <br><br>kill me</br></br>  <br> meymeyarrows <br> Not hulk posting <br>I hate Summer so much.</br></br></br>    Longer version.  <br>Oh wow, volume 7.

If anything it may even end with the two girls sharing. MC guy deserves it, he's a good lead.<br><br>The kouhai will just get shot down the following chapter or two.</br></br></br>  <br>It just won't happen Anon, Rin is simply the heroine rival and she'll lose badly.</br>  Holy fuck.<br>This is going to be fun.</br>  <br>Yes that much is certain but just like any other Love Triangle series aimed for boys the losing girl remains single throughout the end.

Shit like "I have telekinesis, but I need to mime the motions." "I'm immune to anything I cannot anticipate." "I can create a small, slowly-expanding forcefield inside objects." "I can cause an object to have a cascading effect. (i.e. I punch a guy, and whoever touches him suffers the effect of the punch too.)"</br></br>  <br>Considering there are only 6 or 7 level 5 who are capable of such feats...<br>I guess most of the them are like level 0's, 1-3's<br>And most of them are " They won't die even if you try to kill them."</br></br></br>  <br><br>There are probably a lot of Abilities that are confusing or odd to use. Maybe you can make objects as transparent as tinted glass, create shafts of white-hot energy between very small objects, or manipulate a sphere of crystalline fire. Stuff like that isn't immediately useful, but could be quite deadly given specific circumstances.</br></br>  ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ KILL ALEISTER OR RIOT ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ  ITT: Worst girls in their respective series        So much shit taste in this thread.      <br>Shit taste general?</br>            <br>OP said worst, not best.</br>  <br><br>You mean best girls.</br></br>  <br>OP, we all know that the filthy hobbit was the worst girl in that show.

Quit samefagging already.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You already replied.</br></br>  Did you ever consider that this guy is just trying to derail threads by randomly calling someone his memename? That none of this is real and you are just feeding his trolling by trying to argue with him?  <br> yuckyno is exclusively used by the same person 100% of the time, I swear! <br><br>You're so fucking pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br><br>At this point, THK haters are worse than the actual poster. I remember Saekano threads being ruined at the mention of his name.</br></br>  <br> TLK is this mad and delusional </br>  <br> I swear, there are other shitposters who are as bad as me that uses my forced meme that I recently kept forcing! <br>Sure thing.</br></br>  <br>Lurk more. THK is a real shitposter, newfag.</br>  <br>There are. You probably don't even know anything about Yahari threads on /a/. How about you read post by post the link you posted and see how multiple posters have used it?</br>  <br> Yuckyno <br> forced meme <br><br>She's just a shitty girl, of course people would make nicknames of her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Raildexfag here. I can vouch for THK's existence.</br>  <br>Yup.</br>  <br>That's just the surface. Index threads even have a cult dedicated to guess what "THK" is up to IRL.</br>  <br>Case in point </br>  <br> multiple posters <br>Prove it. You can't. Fact is, THK was the one who started forcing it weeks ago and he continues so now. No other fans at that point stooped low as him when he was shitposting by making up all kinds of names for Yukino. Cuck was his favorite word before he switched to Yucky.<br><br><br>Keep forcing it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats exactly the point. He pops in, mentions memename, and keeps at it until the entire thread goes to shit.</br>  <br> I speak for everyone <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsunderefags are a bunch of insecure manchildren. They need to pin the blame of the hate and shitposting their waifus get on a boogeyman to feel better about their tastes.</br>  <br>Calling THK a meme won't make him any less of an autistic shitposter, you know. Why are you so bent on defending THK anyways? Unless of course you're THK himself or his apologist because he likes the girl you like.</br>  <br> There he is </br>  <br> doesn't deny it <br> jumps on the THK shitposting train again <br><br>As expected.</br></br></br></br>   all THK accusation posts are outside post time limit <br>Classic. You people are retards for falling for this shit.</br>  <br> muh us vs tsunderefags post <br> boogeyman <br>You're typical as fuck, THK.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuckynofags are ESL scum. Classic.</br>   There are fags right now defending THK <br>As someone who first met THK in BD threads and seen the shit he has done all by himself, it disgusts me when I see newfags who don't know better thinks it's some made up boogieman That faggot is real as tripfag, just without a trip.</br>  <br> fags <br>More like THK is samefagging and one other guy is sucking on his dick.</br></br>  <br>You're THK as fuck, THKfag.</br>  <br><br> samefagging <br><br>OH THE IRONY</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>THK has some fucking great taste. Megumi, Silver, Hatoko, the list goes on and on.</br></br>  <br> Look, I did it again! </br>  <br>Your typical THK propaganda fails to be believable to anyone who has spent at least a year here. <br><br>Why are you so obsessed with THK again? Were you here for supreme shiposters like gorespammer or the plethora of tripfags who have done infinitely more damage?</br></br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/y<wbr>uckyno%20himeragi/<br><br>Reminder. THK is worse than LRD.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> look, I blamed THK for everything again! </br>    <br> Megumi <br> Silver <br> Hatoko <br>Literally shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> replying to yourself </br>  You know, this thread was going along perfectly fine before you showed up and started shitposting. Even if your precious boogyman was here everyone was just ignoring him like we do with any other faggot and continuing on like normal.<br><br>Congrats on causing exactly what you claim you are trying to stop. Promptly kill yourself.</br></br>  <br><br>Eririfag get out.</br></br>  <br>You are literally shit.</br>  <br>What did you expect? People who shove this THK garbage down everyone's throats have brain problems.</br>  <br>I was in the last BD thread we had last night. THK is the only shitposter left who still shiposts. His posts get deleted, but he still wants a word him so he replies again saying the same time thing. And he even waits for hours until the thread is dead to sagepost his typical a shit. A SHIT for another final word in to claim some victory he has in his retarded head. He does his every time across every series he follows, but Yahari, BD, KoreZombie, and Inou gets it worse.</br>  <br>Megumi is okay. But Silver and Hatoko are worst girls.</br>  <br> replying to yourself again <br><br>Man, at least try to be subtle. You're pretty embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br> Derailing a shit thread <br>I don't see a problem.</br></br>  <br> he's mad because his waifu was posted </br>  <br> Biased writing <br> Shifts blame even though he wasn't ignoring and was siding with THK <br>THK apologist spotted.</br></br></br>  <br>Mai waifu didn't get posted though. Are you sure you aren't the one who is mad instead? You sound awfully defensive because someone posted girls you like, so you attacked and kept attacking.</br>  <br>But he's right. This is a hate thread, but only you have to make a ruckus when it comes to tsundere hate. No one else gets autistically mad and tries to find a spacegoat when people post their favorite girls in a thread like this.</br>  <br> there is only one shitposter in the entire world <br> every other person in the entire world agrees with me and likes the same things as me <br>Are you Republican by chance?</br></br></br>  <br>I was there too . THK will deny it, but it has gotten to a point where he shows up like clockwork to spam/samefag and everyone else now works to ignore him.</br>  <br>But I want to inseminate her while sucking on those fat titties.</br>  <br> you did it again </br>  <br> he's <br> he <br>Heh.<br><br>No one else but you go full sperglord like an underage kid raging and shitposting on girls who are mainly tsundere. It's not a matter of hate, but fact is you're about the only shitposter who uses /b/ tier nicks and insults. Calling you out isn't the same as saying only you hate such and such. That's not the point at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Hey samefag-kun, don't ignore my question<br/></br></br></br>  <br> going for personal attacks <br><br>Nice way to weasel your way out of the confrontation.</br></br></br>  <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;122912885 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;122925053 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;123475895 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;123453665 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;123646058 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;124365855 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;124125759 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;124682114 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;124401423 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125681339 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125698823  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125783360 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125792626 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125818786 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125863040  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126016411 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126050238 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126239503  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126378406  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126599995  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126596641 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126751252  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126794272 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126925240  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127050828  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127067418  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120965  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127136001  <br> <br> <br><br> Almost all of the girl he zealously hates and go full autism over <br> THK leaving his signature shitpost a minute away from the thread falling off <br>Reminder.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No one else but you go full sperglord like an underage kid raging and shitposting <br>Except that is exactly what you are doing.</br></br>  <br> Pot calling the kettle black <br><br><br>See </br></br></br></br>  <br>THK will defend this.</br>  <br> everyone else now works to ignore him <br>Except for you. You have made over 30 posts in this thread that have nothing to do with this thread and only talk about your tripfag crush.</br></br>  <br>Let me guess, photoshop right? You are so predictable.</br>  <br>Not him, but gorespammer was short-lived and he was only after one show and Shaft trolling, all of which came to past eventually. Tripfags are easily ignored or filter. On the other hand, THK can't be filtered and THK has been going on for at least 3 years. There are some (idiots) get trolled by THK or those who copy him, much like how gorespammer had trolls who copied him in trolling BMG and Shaft. At this point, THK does more damage, his targets are more expansive and he has ruined more fanbases than gorespammer. LRD is also in the same boat, but he's tons better than THK.</br>  Man this board has really gotten to shit, I can't even say I like any character who's remotely  tsundere  without creating a shitstorm.  <br>Except I'm pointing out your faulty thinking and autism. Are you really that sensitive? Do your feelings get hurt when someone badmouths your waifu and so you have to initiate a campaigh against those mean and bad bullies?</br>    <br>See </br>  <br><br>Something tells me you are in for a world of   disappointment  </br></br>  <br>Gorespammer was a huge deal for the board in general. In that sense, THK doesn't come even remotely close.</br>  <br>You took that as implying samefag when the point was to show the real underage shitposter with the /b/ tier insults and nick? Feeling insecure, are we?<br><br><br>See above.</br></br></br></br>  Mugi<br>Marika<br>Rei<br>Chi Chi<br>Sakura<br>Nico Robin<br>Rin</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>rei best girl<br><br>asuka a shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> THK stalkers <br>Creepy.</br></br>  THK a shit.

You're in this too and arguing anyways, you know.</br>  Posting worst girl.  <br>Remember the five minutes where she was the hottest shit since Chaika's ass hole?</br>  <br>this, so annoying</br>  <br>Oh so its my fault and you are completely blameless for doing the exact same thing? Grow up.</br>  <br>How does that make what you are doing any better? If you want to complain about shitposters maybe you should stop being one.</br>  worst girl  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>Don't be confused, anon. There were two gorespammer: the original who spammed gore threads/dump gore and the guy BMG fans a labeled as gorespammer in remembrance to the original because he had similar spams and hate for BMG (minus the lack of gore dumps). The latter is the one I'm talking about and he wasn't acknowledged by the board (those who didn't like BMG or Shaft because otaku pandering etc have doubted gorespammer's existence and all that), he was mostly a topic in BMG threads where fans connected the dots and promptly called him out.<br><br>Funny or not, I used to collect archive threads of gorespammer's activity via notepad to help connect the dots of his postings.

I, for one, do remember that, among other things. A lot of nice things died out, sometimes as a result of faded hype, large change in userbase (college students moving on or jobs etc), or because of new rulings set by mods or posters of the board, even if it isn't fully agrred by man (recall what happened to periodical Aria threads). As always said, /a/ was never good and generally become worse as time passes. 4chan's growing popularity that aided an explosive influx of newfags, normalfags, and cross-boarders mixing in causes quality to decrease and that can't be stopped.</br>  <br>Seems like your taste is pure shit from where I'm standing.</br>  <br> from where I'm standing <br>Are you perhaps banging a coed while typing your posts?</br></br>  Come at me faggot.  <br> Be 27 and live in a house <br> Rarely ever leave the house <br>Uh, no?</br></br></br>  <br>She's low but not that low.<br>Kosaki &gt; Marika &gt; Yuinee</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> (She's close though)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Wrong<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Correct</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What.

You're still trying to forced that shit because of that one thread that had a fag who undoubtedly was reverse trolling and shit? Only you're desperate enough to use that shit, THK.</br></br></br>  <br>It's better than yours. Here, have another worst girl.</br>  <br>Holy fucking shit. I had a redditor room mate last year who loved her. Commissioned me to paint a AgK logo painting and everything. Made $30 off the whole thing.</br>  <br><br><br>Lurk more.<br><br><br><br>He really wasn't reverse trolling.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He <br> Generalizing based on a single fag trolling or whatever <br>Confirmed for troll trollan.</br></br></br>  <br> wasn't reverse trolling. <br>Sure, and you never trolled before in your life. Oh wait.</br></br>  <br>See? Am I ever wrong?</br>  <br><br>Your desperation only proves me right. You're all a bunch of normies.</br></br>  <br>i'll kick your ass in real life</br>  <br> desperation <br> normies <br>Nice irony. Only cross-boarder scums from /r9k/ even use "normie" instead of normalfag. Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>I lurked plenty and have been in nearly all the major DanMachi threads. You're just full of it. Lolifags are usually over Hestia or Lili, for fuck's sake.</br>  <br> am I fitting in yet guys? <br><br>Confirmed normie.</br></br></br>  <br>THK just go.

This is an anonymous message board. But yeah you got it spot fucking on. I remember him saying that "everyone" loves her, by which he meant everyone on reddit loves her.</br>  <br> xD <br>Remember to kill yourself on the way out, THK.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off normie.</br>  <br>This post was shit. This thread in general was shit.</br>  <br> delusional Rei-fags </br>      <br>Tell me what failsafe methods you use to identify him, because as far as I can tell, everyone screaming about THK all the time is witch-hunting.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Asuka Shikinami Langley &gt; Rei II &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Asuka Langley Sohryu &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rei Q</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka Shikinami Langley &gt; Asuka Langley Sohryu <br>Fucking explain.</br></br>  <br>Sohryu is a bitch.</br>  <br>Are you a newfag or some shit, you went through all that effort to voice your opinion in a thread made with a shitpost, everyone has shit taste and hates and loves characters here, so in most cases every worst girl is a best girl as well. I scrolled through pics to find anyone cute from an anime I didn't know, but you trying to tell people to get out of /a/ while in a thread that is literally shit, you can't be serious, this thread might as well be a fishing shack with all the bait everywhere, you should know better if you're going to tell people to get off /a/</br>  <br><br>Does no one remember golden era? Best times was when /a/ was super hyped for Nanoha. Those were fun, nice, and take it easy times for most of the board, and of course when Nanoha activity was at its peak at time and after the time of Nanoha A's. Current /a/ is in a low state for various reasons compared to those times. The Nanoha fanbase of today is barely a faction of what it was back then and this is reflected in Vivid threads of last season. The saying you're here forever is quite untrue as people do leave and in part of that, too many Nanoha bros have left for /m/, AS, NanoFate, and other boards. <br><br>Shit, it has been over a decade since Nanoha started. I feel old.</br></br></br></br>    <br>My bad, I forgot to quote  as well.</br>  <br>Literally the only thing I liked about that shit show.</br>  <br>Din do nuffin wrong</br>  <br> We enjoy anime and manga where we can relate to the characters, like Boku no Pico, Kodomo no Jikan, and Pretty Cure <br>There were sides here. They're gone now.</br></br>  <br>The facts are very true, and loli threads are great. Threads like this one are OK, but not really enjoyable</br>  <br>mmnmm look at all that butthurt. Someone forgot about Poe's law. For all your talk about shitposting, you never even considered that I may be shitposting.<br><br>But, yeah. I'm not. Stop getting so hurt over someone telling someone else to get out.
