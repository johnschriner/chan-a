No. Long story short, the China stock market crash is a result of China's government purposely encouraging people to buy stocks to fund new business, creating a massive stock market bubble.

It is because she attended the same highschool as a young girl so she already knows all the answers in her highschool classes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAA</wbr></br>  <br/>  <br><br>Why she is so best, based German genes</br></br>  SUBS<br><br>SUBS<br><br>MY KINGDOM FOR SUBS</br></br></br></br>  So this is 4 chapters per episode, right?  <br>What a tweest</br>    <br>So what you're saying is, Umaru transforms when she enters her regressive state because of two converging time lines. One where she is adjusted and successful and one where she has babies with her oniichan who is attracted to her because she is also his mother and in turn spoils her causing her to reciprocate, conceiving herself and thus causing her to degrade physically whenever she enters a state where the latter scenario is predetermined.<br><br>The real question then is when does oniichan go back in time.</br></br></br>  <br> german genes <br> not blonde </br></br>  This feels like watching a light version of Oreimo.<br>She's not super fucking trash like Kirino but she's still so goddamn annoying.<br><br>If she always stayed in her "NEET" form I wouldn't mind, but how she switches in normie form pisses me off. <br>If I were her brother I would have teared apart that Jump.</br></br></br></br>  This isn't cute or funny, more depressing.<br><br>I feel bad for the brother.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127793261 <br>I think I just got a virus</br>  <br> She's not super fucking trash like Kirino <br> implying <br/></br></br>   desuwa <br>Best girl</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127793261 <br>wh-what was it?</br>  AOTY ALL YEARS  Slphy a best<br>Ebina a cutie<br>Kirie a maiden<br>Umaru a  n angel </br></br></br>  <br>Why are you proving his point?</br>  ebin a   How are PuyaSubs?  <br>Ebina a kill</br>  <br>Bueno.</br>  <br>Spanish CR.</br>  <br> relating to Umaru-chan more than Oni-chan <br>why would anyone self-insert on to shitty shounen protagonists, when they have Umaru-chan?</br></br>  Just started reading this and never thought there was an anime<br><br>Oniichan is one smooth sweet guy</br></br>  <br>Delicious Ebina butt</br>  <br>Muy bien</br>  The scene of her coming home and turning on the computer is exactly what I do.

If it's some horrible thing the name of the tournament would be even more ironic than it is now.

Or do the Dragons have some connection to the mix too?</br></br>  <br>I don't disagree with that, I just responded to the anon who said that Gon has no role whatsoever in the story.</br>  <br>Can't be, because we have to save that for the final duel,Yuzu vs. Supreme King Yuya.</br>  TUNER MONSTA HARISEN TOKUSHUSHOKAN!  <br>Maybe the fate of the losers is landing in the audience bench   which is otherwise populated entirely by shiberu clones  </br>  <br>Dennis Rurinapping her and Serena.</br>  <br>Being Yugo in this passed episode must have been suffering.</br>  So are we getting an opening update this week?<br><br>All the scenes at the end right before Jack summons RDASR are outdated and have been for a while now</br></br>  How would you rank the Lancers in terms of 'power levels'?<br>I'd think the top three would probably be EGAOmode Yuya, Reiji, then possibly Shun.</br>  <br>Having bombshell grills that clearly resemble your waifu walking around your house in sweat shorts does sound like suffering to me.</br>  Why does Zexal have the best Sound Duels?<br><br>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>akjmb_yu-gi-oh-zexal-sound-duel-5-t<wbr>he-fight-isn-t-over-d2-t3_travel</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Maybe Serena's bracelet will counteract that somehow?

When was the last time she could comfortably pull out her harisen?</br>  <br> I should ass <br> Yuya will more duels <br>You wrote that really fast, huh?</br></br></br>  <br>Selena won every duel she`s been with only a tenth of her deck and the fact they`re from fusion dimension aka dimension where everybody is trained to be a duel warrior should rank them pretty high</br>  <br>I like both.</br>   Autists do power levels for fucking YGO of all things.   <br>Yep, I did.

Can bystanders get caught in duels between two people?  <br>I don't know what those are.</br>  <br> Can bystanders get caught in duels between two people? <br>There was visible shockwaves when Yuto dueled Sawatari</br></br>  <br>There was a image of his face replacing Sephiron's face but I can't find it</br>  <br>About how I felt when Kagemaru hijacked the Phantom Demons and went full Zyzz.</br>  <br>Well the shockwaves from outside of Standard do cause real damage, so I guess with good reason.<br><br>More importantly, why don't the Lancers do insane damage while in Synchroverse anyway? Was that shit ever explained?</br></br></br>  <br>Favorite YGO villain ever. He did it all for them gains.</br>  <br><br>Yuto is just a chuuni beta</br></br>  <br>Shun still does it but I don't know about everyone else</br>  <br>It's not like the damage from action fields has ever been consistent. But Reiji probably lowered the intensity of the lancer dueldisks compared to Yuto's original settings   At least until they get to Academia, hopefully  </br>  <br>Shun is still using his original disk no?</br>  <br>Well in the last episode when Rise Falcon DESTROYED the Elite Prison Guard they got sent flying at least 15 meters back out of the tunnel through the shockwave.<br><br>I think this is mostly an Xyz &amp; Fusion thing, something Standard Duelists don't naturally have.<br><br><br>He honestly did. Like there was no greater goal he had in mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone is.</br>  <br>He launched three dudes out of a tunnel at least a hundred feet long. There is a very firm possibility they're all dead.</br>  <br>I thought everyone but Shun and Selena had their disks modified or replaced to generate action fields and travel across dimensions.</br>  Why do Shun and Yuto refer to their fellows as 'comrades'? Yugioh has been pretty persistent with everybody being 'friends' up until now.  Will we see Reiji vs Jack? I seriously can't think of who would win.  <br>Well yeah. You think Reiji of all people took out the ability for them to create real shockwaves when they are about to fight in a war?</br>  <br>I don't think it's a thing about the duelists themselves, but the dueldisks. Like, the XYZ and Fusion disks are intended to be war weapons, while the Standard ones are simply portable action field generators that are no more dangerous than a Standard action field.<br><br><br>W A R M O T I F S<br>W<br><br>A<br><br>R<br><br>M<br><br>O<br><br>T<br><br>I<br><br>F<br><br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You thought Heartland was in Japan? <br>Nope, turns out it's been in Russia this whole time.</br></br>  <br>Because they are in war.</br>  <br> Reiji and Jack repelling the invasion together <br>I need to see this happen</br></br>  <br>Well Reiji beat Yuya, and Yuya beat Jack, so what do you think?</br>  <br>Kek, Jack is actually  in league with Academia. <br>Remember that  he uses Fusion. </br></br>  <br> Yuya beat Jack <br>I know it'll happen, I still don't want it to</br></br>  <br> &gt;Yuya beat Jack <br><br>We have literally zero evidence this happens.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I'm sorry, where are you from, two weeks ago?</br>  <br> &gt;yfw he plays Multiple Piece Golem and pulls off a vectorface </br>   Yuya beating Jack because of Egao no Sekai   <br> le 9gag face </br>  <br>Red Demons actually ties with Odd Rebellion pretty squarely. <br> Yuya goes Egaomode 3, destroys Jack, Yugo has to duel him back into submission, consequently gets absorbed </br></br>  <br>It's been eight years, rage faces are now ebin retro now. That's eighty years in Internet time.</br>  How do you convince the strongest duelist in the universe to join your Fusion-fighting club? <br>Beat him in a duel.<br>I think Yuya has a vague chance.</br></br>  <br>Don't the summaries actually point to Yuya losing against Jack, or are ya'll talking about the potential rematch?</br>  <br> Le meme face </br>  <br>Potential rematch,  which I hope is interrupted by the invasion </br>  <br>Didn't mean to quote.</br>  <br>Whatever m8 you gonna guard or nah?</br>  <br>But Fusion are too busy invading Standard to invade Synchro.</br>  <br> eighty years in Internet time <br>What?</br></br>  <br>There aren't any Ruri's there.</br>  I want Shun to fuck me!  <br>Be careful what you wish for.

As they vanish, she makes an overlay network with Yuya and Rank-up.</br>  Is Odd Eyes competing with Hopu for having the most pointless variations?  I just noticed that 1 of the elite security guys bricked real hard.<br>He had 6 cards in his hands, but could do nothing but summon Goyo Defender thanks to the Goyo Defender his comrade had summoned. He bricked even harder than the Obelisk Forces that dueled Yuya.<br>All 3 of them also sort of bricked by not drawing a single usable spell/trap</br></br>  <br>Odd Eyes is even worse than Hope IMO.<br>At least some of the hopes had some sort of "charisma".<br><br>All of the Odd Eyes look like Chicken robots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Odd Eyes have variations which DON'T EVEN EXISTS IN THE ANIME.<br>So, Odd Eyes is worse.</br></br>  <br>nigga you asking to get chin'd</br>  <br>That would be Neos that would be competing against HOPU for most worthless forms. Against Odd Eyes who only has 2 useless forms in the original and saber compared to every other form of HOPU except lightning and ZeXaL.</br>  <br> All of the Stardusts look like white newts being skewered by a harpoon <br>See I can do it too.</br></br>  <br>Rune Eyes and Beast Eye are useless.<br>Don't forget Fire, Ice and Wind as OCG only forms.<br>Why did they even bother making them btw ?</br></br></br>  <br>Most Stardusts do look like shit though. For a franchise that wanks them off so much, Yugioh cant design Dragons for shit<br><br><br> Rune Eyes and Beast Eye are useless. <br>Plenty of decks run one of either so they can search for Odd Eyes with Fusion Conscription</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is the place Yuya is from called Standard instead of Advance or Tribute? Before LDS unleashed the extra deck, strong monsters were those and Rituals. I mean, the king of duelists in that dimension was an Tribute user and Yuya's,Gong's and Yuzu's ace monsters were all tribute monsters at first.  <br>they look different enough from the base form (except for the assault one) to be "charismatic".<br><br>Rune Eyes and Beast Eyes looks almost exactly like Odd Eyes.</br></br></br>  <br>...Because Odd Eyes is a character as opposed to simply a monster and thus has to show some form of development?</br>  <br>When I said useless, I meant in an anime point of view. They only were there to win against random duelists; While Dark Magician, Neos and Stardust variations were made to beat a villain or a strong opponent.</br>  <br>Ishijima wasn't the original king though, Yusho was, and so far no one knows what his fucking summoning method is</br>  <br> Supreme King Yuya </br>  <br> Look exactly like Odd Eyes <br>Well what the fuck did you expect? They're literally just Odd Eyes fused with mystical/beastly elements; did you expect them to turn into knights or some shit?</br></br>  <br>I liked Stardust Dragon's design because it looks like a monster straight out of Ultraman or Guyver.</br>  <br> making new forms for the hero's ace <br> not even showing them in the anime <br>it's just called bad marketing.</br></br></br>  <br>He was king back before LDS and before LDS there was no such thing as an extra deck. It's obvious he wasn't a pendulum summoner either because Sky Magician is his ace and most well known monster and if it were a pendulum the world wouldn't of been in an uproar over Yuya's Pendulum summon against Strong. He could be like Dennis and hiding his strength but he never once did pendulums while in standard.</br>  <br>all of the Neos, All of the Utopia, All of the Stardust minus Assault mode and all of the Dark magicians looked different enough. <br>The Odd Eyes look too similar with each others.</br></br>  <br>Other circles call it 'support'.</br>  <br>Oh, you mean they changed color and got bigger each time.<br>Do you have autism per chance?</br></br>  <br>they never did Hero's ace support without showing them in a media of some sort, to hype the kids.<br>So basically, they don't care about the children audience anymore and only cares about the tourneyfags ? Is that what you're implying ?</br></br>  <br>Meiru, Gon and Rank 0-kun were plenty strong opponents. And more importantly they were there to show his development and increased mastery of Pendulums.  Also how great MUH YUZU is </br>  <br>Oh gee, they copied and pasted Odd Eyes, clearly. Way too similar.</br>  <br>They wanted to make Odd Eyes.dec playable, without fucking up the animes pace with too many Odd Eyes evolutions. This isnt a bad thing</br>  <br>Kids like Odd Eyes, buy Odd Eyes, but can't compete against the kids that bought Nekroz and Qlits. So they make better Odd Eyes to give them a fighting chance; it's supply and demand.</br>  <br>He has support, Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon, Clear Wing Synchro Dragon and Something something Fusion Dragon will be Yuya's support while his magicians will be the card that lead him to created Xyz pendulum, Synchro pendulum and Fusion pendulum as his high caliber finishers. The odd eyes varients they released without a manga or anime are just there to make an odd eyes magician deck more playable because they know performapals and magicians do not mesh together well at all due to the difference in playstyle. It's like Elemental Heroes and Neo spacians, cept better planned out.</br>  <br>You're probably right.<br>Maybe it's because I feel the need to have Dark Duels/Dangerous opponents because we already are at the Episode 63 and Yuya didn't do any Dark Duels.</br></br>  <br> Dark Rebellion  <br>Not by itself it's not. And Clear Wing certainly didn't tie well in Odd Eyes decks at all either, at least not at the time they came out.</br></br>  <br>but kids want to have the cards they saw in the episodes. So they generally don't care that much about support they never saw.</br>  <br>The fusion dragons appeared to fix the issue of Yuya having literally only 2 monsters with an ATK power of over 2000 (Odd-Eyes and Mammoth) and no extra deck options.</br>  <br> all of the Utopia looked different enough <br>Stop right there. Taking the same guy and changing his shoulder wings doesn't count as a different design.</br></br>  <br>If kids only bought what they saw in episodes, Konami would make expensive action figures instead of paper playing cards.<br>But as the fame itself goes, a Pendulum deck flooded with options for Fusion, Synchro, and XYZ monsters all of the same archetype is too much to pass up on.</br></br>  <br> Kids <br> fighting against people with Nekroz and Qlis <br>They play for fun with theIR friends, not to win tournaments.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it does. Yuya has a ton of search and level 4 monsters that special summon themselves even when he doesn't have pendulum scales up, It's a perfect turn card Clear wing could be just as easily used if they give Yuya a performapal that's level 3.</br>  <br><br>Where's my Ghostrick Special?</br></br>  <br>He has a card literally named Supreme King Black Dragon it isn't that farfetched</br>  <br>How would you have done it? Give it more arms? Because they did that anyway. <br><br>People would complain if only one kind of Hopu was used each time too.</br></br></br>  <br>By that logic, Black Rose or Baxi are just as much Yuya support</br>  <br>Rune and Beast both look a lot better than regular OEPD imo</br>  <br>Not as support for Yuya's deck, as support for Odd Eyes itself.<br>If you're making an Entermate deck then whoopie-doo, they're great, but Odd Eyes is a standalone archetype now, and Dark Rebellion and Clear Wing aren't support for Odd Eyes specifically at all.</br></br>    <br>Hopu is /m/. Polygonal /m/ robots always look the same.</br>  <br>I stand by and still say Konami dropped the ball with creativeness in ZEXAL<br><br>ALMOST EVERY WARRIOR-TYPE XYZ MONSTER (EVEN SOME NON-WARRIOR-TYPES) LOOK LIKE HOPUU</br></br></br>  <br/>  Might as well ask here.<br><br>I finished the first part of 5D's (up to chapter 64) but it seems it will be downhill from there, am I wrong and I should keep watching what's left or should I skip some part? Skip it entirely? If the latter, what should I know?</br></br>  <br>It's not worth it. The fact it shits on a series that was riding such a high makes it the worst Yugioh for me. It just leaves a sour taste in your mouth.</br>  <br>Dennis is genuinly my fav besides Yuya. He's a great character.</br>  <br>I enjoyed all of it except for the whole Kiryu thing (Crash Town arc). It was cringy as fuck because of all the suicide and death talk.</br>  <br>Don't listen to  or anyone telling you the samething Anon. Keep going though it does become mediocre but still has some great moments. If you skip out on the remaining 90 episodes you will miss out on Bruno and Clear Mind. And then there is Jack making the devil his bitch and feeding it to his dragon. And pic related. <br><br>He ain't interested Aki...</br></br></br>  <br>I'd suggest finishing it since you've already invested a lot of time into it and it's still pretty good and has some moments &amp; duels that rank among the best in series. Just follow the guide.</br>  <br>Virtually everybody in Arc V is a great character, especially the Lancers. They all have a reason to be there, and they bounce off each other so well.</br>  <br>Oh. Sorry,then.</br>  <br>I wish I was here for the day that episode aired. It had to of been filled with people calling Yusei a faggot. Watch the same thing happen with Yuzu and Yuya. They'll embrace, look romantically at each other and proceed to say how great friends they are.</br>  <br><br>He looks pretty nice for the leader of a fascist dystopia.<br>Will we see his dark side?</br></br></br>  <br>Crash Town was great because the only thing better than card games on motorcycles is card games on motorcycles in the wild west.</br>  People think Gon will lose in his tourney match, but what if Crow meeting the 'loser's fate' is what prompts Shinji to start going full Bommer?  <br>Dark Rebellion halfs the atk of your opponent. Making Odd-Eyes do more damage if you attack with that first. This isn't hard to understand.</br>  <br>Great, gonna use the guide.<br>btw do you have the ZEXAL or GX guide? I also want to watch GX because I never finished in it's time.</br></br>  <br>these all look like the same wtf kind of hallucinogenic's are you on cause damn if you think this is good design I need some of those drugs.</br>  <br> especially the Lancers. They all have a reason to be there <br>I was going to protest this point but the more I though t about the more I agreed<br> Selena: MUH ACADEMIA TRUTH/YUZU <br> Yuya: MUH YUZU <br> Gon: MUH YUYA <br> Reira: MUH NII-SAMA <br> Reiji: MUH PLAN/FATHER <br> Tsukikag: MUH BROTHER/NINJA PRIDE <br> Sawatari: MUH EGO <br> Dennis: MUH DOUBLE AGENT INTELLIGENCE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the reaction was pretty much people calling Yusei a faggot for being oblivious of Aki's feelings for him. And then there were the few who though he felt the same for Aki and swear to this day that they kissed which is bullshit and isn't something Yusei would do. The comments in the stream was everyone pissed that Yusei won and not Jack preventing him from tieing up lose ends and denying him a farwell scene with his waifu befiting for their characters.<br><br>[Spoiler]Days before the finale I drempt the outcome of Jack vs Yusei and was pissed when it came to pass[/spoiler]</br></br></br>  I just want to hug Yuuya and tell him it'll all be okay, you're the main character  <br>Plus they finally took the concept of Duels to their logical conclusion.</br>  <br>But what if  they force Yuzu to pull a Bruno ?</br>  <br>Odd Eyes Changes<br> Mouth got smaller <br> Got an eyepatch <br> Massive ring on his back <br> Tail is longer and fatter and has a different pattern then before. <br> His arms are way different <br> He went from red to fully dark purple as a main color. <br> His hands changed design <br> His knees and feet have extra half circle stuff on them and so do his elbows. <br> His neck and head spike are really different now. <br><br>Hope Changes<br> He has extra wings <br> He is now grey <br> He has 2 extra robo arms and a bigger blacker extra sword <br> more shoulderpads <br><br>Yeah odd-eyes totally got btfo <br>for sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would just make him feel like a bigger target</br>  <br>I do like all characters I just like Dennis and Yuya the most. I like Shun and Reji a little less but still more then the rest.</br>  <br>Sure.<br> I also want to watch GX because I never finished in it's time. <br>Depending on where you stopped you're in for a ride...</br></br></br>  <br>and Zexal. I actually recommend watching all of GX's filler because it accentuates the "What were they thinking?" experience it offers.</br>  <br>Interesting. So they are more people who think Crow doesn't have a 100% chance of winning. I agree as well. Gon is some guy he doesn't know while Crow is his friend.</br>  <br>Who are these three?</br>  <br><br>At about half of sartorius arc.<br>So Im guessing I actually am close to yubel according to the guide.<br><br>Anyways, thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's the normal hope, the fallen angel hope, the Hope using barian energy ,the hope using astral energy and I guess victory is using numberon energy?</br>  <br>But as long as he knows that he'll get to be with Yuzu in the end he'll be fine</br>  <br><br>Also use this to watch them GX:<br> https://mega.co.nz/#F!UZEESKjB!8XT8<wbr>uUu5_j9k57Jyvdz34Q</wbr> <br>Superior RAWs and better subs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Red hat-kun of the tag force series<br>Blue hair is female bruno of the over the nexus ds game and I have no clue who that other girl is</br></br>  RURI~<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm265<wbr>78783<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>05685</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>All from the the Tag-Force games for the PSP/Vita, you can emulate them with PPSSPP.

Surely there is just more than one city... there is a whole fucking planet. They could have found someone. Much better and easier than going to another dimension...<br><br>But I guess Reiji knows something about Yuzu that we do not. So he chose dimensional hopping and killing three birds with one stone.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad I wasn't around for when they first revealed that Carly &amp; Jack's development was retconned. Was the reaction as bad I envisioned it was?</br>  <br>I think LDS had already orchestrated it to include the strongest duelists globally, see Halil &amp; Olga. It's just that Standard in general is weak as all get out.</br>  <br>Well he did invite the top students from the international LDS's to 'compete in the tournament'.<br><br>The reason they've gone to the Synchro dimension is to find some legit Synchro duelists and train/grow as a team. Supposedly the XYZ/Synchro/Fusions from Standard aren't as pure/effective as they are from their corresponding dimensions so Reiji wants some of that sweet, untained Synchro tang for his card game avenger squad.<br><br>I also imagine the venture in the Synchro dimension is like a preliminary test of dimension hopping before they go in Fusion country. If the current farce is anything to go by, they'd all be 0 ATK monster cards by now had they gone there first.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, Halil, Olga and Dennis are all (well, Dennis just apparently) from international branches of LDS. And all the schools that participated in the tournament were froma ll over the world.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, if instead of Security the people surrounding them on arrival had been academia soldiers they'd all have achieved maximum thinness by now.</br>  If Reiji wants to prove he's from another dimension, couldn't he just show off his dimensional transporter encoded in the duel disks?<br>Why did the Council believe him again? He had no proff other that Yugo, Ekushizu and Pendurumu</br>  <br>I was not ready for CARD GAMES ON GUNS</br>  <br>Maybe I'm assuming too much before the tourney even starts, but it looks like the council are putting the Lancers against their Commons friends in order to get them to prove their dedication to a Standard-Synchro alliance. To see if they're willing to throw a few Commons under the bus to get on the council's side.<br><br>There's no way Shinji's going to be allowed to go free after he tries to use the tourney to incite rebellion, so he's making a desperate last ditch effort, instead of hoping to be let free after doing what the council wants.</br></br></br>  <br> hey'd all have achieved maximum thinness by now. </br>  <br>Fuck I feel dumb for not realizing this</br>  <br>He showed them his LDS propaganda video</br>   And then, appearing before Yuya, is a teenage boy with a card in his hand.  <br><br>What's the card, /a/?</br></br>  <br>TUNA</br>  <br>Winged Kuriboh</br>  <br>WAIFU</br>  Am I the only one who wants a tag duel with Yuya and Tsukikage, with them doing shit like Yuya tributing a monster on the opponent's side of the field and a Hanzo for his OEPD and pushing for game?<br><br>Tsukikage really needs to duel.</br></br>  <br>My boy</br>  <br>There is nothing this character can do that won't make me want to hug him forever</br>  <br> yfw it's Kaiba with Blue Eyes <br> he just rips the card in half instead of giving it to Yuuya </br></br>  <br>Even game exclusive support gives Yuya more Yuzus.</br>  <br> Yuya goes into edge mode at the sight of seeing someone treat cards like that </br>  <br> Kaiba just walks away instead of dueling him <br>How would he react?</br></br>    <br>I pictured it as: Kaiba walks away immediately after breaking the card while Yuya crawls into the floor to try to pick up the pieces. Kaiba is long gone by the time he enters edge mode. Yuya goes on a rampage and gets arrested by security who send him to prison with no chance of escape. Academia kidnaps Yuzu and plugs her to the doomsday machine, does the same to Selena. The multiverse is turned into a hell under the rule of the dark god Leo Akaba. Thanks Kaiba!</br>  Where's the other summary? Shouldn't there be two versions of them every month?  <br>What if he goes full Double X EGAOMODE 4Z, kills all the Ruris, and feels no remorse?

I get that Gon's is basically stalling until he can unleash a special summoning swarm then stall some more with his synchro monsters while chipping away at the opponents LP and Yuya's is atk/def switching with beatdown,but Yuzu's completely confuses me.</br>  <br><br> stall <br> ???? <br> profit </br></br></br></br>  Fuck you /a/rc-v I now want to make an earthbound deck but Earthbound are shit  <br> do everything that is related to love </br>  <br> The "Melodious" monsters focus on Special Summoning. They usually either have effects that Special Summon, like "Sonata the Melodious Diva" or that activate if they were Special Summoned, like "Elegy the Melodious Diva". They also include cards like "Shopina the Melodious Maestra" to help keeping hand advantage to keep Special Summoning monsters. <br><br>The main strategy is to Special Summon "Aria the Melodious Diva" and "Elegy the Melodious Diva" to protect your (Special Summoned) Melodious monsters from being targeted by card effects and from being destroyed by battle or card effects. Both of them can be Special Summoned by "Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen" from the hand or you can Special Summon them from the graveyard with "Soul Charge" or with other cards. With "1st Movement Solo", you can Special Summon "Aria" very easily, and you can Special Summon "Elegy" with "Transmodify", since all Melodious monsters are LIGHT Fairy-Type monsters. "The Sanctuary in the Sky" protects you from Battle damage and "Sonata" boosts your ATK and DEF of your Fairy-Type monsters. <br>yugiohwikia</br></br></br></br>  <br> T-Time for Yuzu art? </br>  <br> yugiohwikia </br>  <br>Yuya how about if you gather your mind to not job and suck at the same time against Jack?</br>    <br> pic related <br> I will actually marry and make the card and sleeves <br> tfw I can go home and be a duelist man </br></br></br>  <br> MC never loses <br> what a stu <br> MC loses against powerful opponents like Reiji and the kingu <br> what a jobber <br>There is no pleasing you people</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll be pleased if I become romantically involved with either Yuuya or Yuzu</br>  <br><br><br>That scene was great.<br>Also seeing Jack going into the danger zone in his d-wheel reminds me than even though arc-V is in synchro dimension, we won't see anyone but Yugo using d-wheels other than to duel.<br><br> &gt;tfw we won't ever get apocalyptic motorcycle chases ever again <br><br>Also, the council members seemed to be an allusion to the timelords. i wonder if we'll see anything earthbound related before the synchro arc ends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't they're cartoons.<br>Go make yourself a dating sim or something, you don't even need to know how to program to make one these days.</br></br>  <br>In fact someone made a dating simulator for Sora.

Me either.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuya looks up to Yuzu as the missing paternal figure in his life <br>Thats pretty  hot </br></br>  Lose 1 Turn is so fucking good in Toon decks  <br>Because he's just the cutest possible thing and designed to torture people who have an appreciation for cute boys everywhere</br>  Yuya is the cutest and strongest MC.  <br>Tell me about it</br>  <br>Most of the Lancers are doing what they're doing because of someone else. In fact the entire endeavor is so Reiji can deliver a huge 'fuck you' to his own dad.</br>  <br>Most of them also at least give half a shit about the dimension war stuff. Yuya would just tell Reiji to eat shit and go home if he gets Yuzu back.</br>  <br>He'd just follow wherever Yuzu wants to go</br>  I'm going to bet that Leo's master plan is the classic villain gambit, "manipulate levers such that I have the heroes unwittingly do my work for me". What possible reason could he have for kidnapping Ruris? The only things we know about them are that A) all of them except Serena have a love interest with identical looks and a dragon, and B) Yuzu, at least, has a bracelet that keeps Yuyas away from each other.<br><br>What happens when all the Yuyas merge? Ultimate evil power is unleashed, and perhaps the worlds merge as well. Therefore, all Leo has to do is manipulate the locations of the Yuzus to create circumstances in which Yuyas meet up and inevitably fight and fuse due to the influence of the dragons. Then he just needs to move the Yuzus to Academia and have Yuya come to him, fuse him with Yuri via duel, and then Leo himself probably intends to steal the ultimate evil power and become a godlike being ruling over the united worlds, whether he does this via dueling Yuya or something more devious. He can even force Yuya to go edgemode and unleash his ultimate power at any time because he'll have all the Yuzus on hand to slap around and arouse the ire of their respective Yuyas.<br><br>Reiji's little rebellion doesn't even need to be worried about, because Reiji is actually just dragging Yuya around to places where he'll become stronger and fuse with additional Yuyas. It's a perfect plan! Bravo, Leo!</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like he'd try to go the opposite way to her so he could experience the sweet bliss of her putting her crude strong arms on him to discipline him again</br>  <br>Leo's plan will actually work. <br>Universe will merge but the timeline will extend in it: Standard will only start with Fusion, then Synchro will appear, then Xyz, and finally Pendulum.<br>Yuyas merging will make Yugi.<br>This whole time, Arc V was a prequel of Yu-gi-oh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't hate that picture. I should hate that picture because of the yaoi implications. I just can't bring myself to hate it. Fuck you, Arc-V and your best boys.</br>  <br>I dunno, I find it kind of amusing that for once the MC doesn't seem to see himself as a hero capable of saving the entire world or even thinks that the idea of being one is tempting, he just wants to make sure his key person is safe.</br>  <br>It's also more "realistic" in a way.</br>  <br>IKTF<br>Yuuya, Shun, and Yuuto are confirmation that I'm bisexual</br></br>  <br><br>Am I the only one that thinks that Leo is actually the good guy? <br>I think he genuinely wants to unite the dimensions, which is also why he doesn't attack Standard</br></br></br>  <br>In contrast to Yuya, Sawatari is the one who's really enthusiastic about being a hero in a shounen storyline, with how he even seems to have a personal narrative in his head.<br><br>Like gloating about being chosen by the cards, being chosen to be on the Lancers, being the leader of the 'Sawatari generation' with Yuya as his disciple, having adventures and fun in Synchro, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Doing it by force and using his particular type of force is a no no, regardless of his objective.</br>  <br> fusion apologists <br>OY VEY! Remember the six xyzillion!</br></br>  <br>I kind if like the idea of Leo not being a villain in the way Reiji is making it seem. Like maybe he's not trying to unite the dimensions to destroy them, but to stop some greater looming threat coughYushocough.<br><br><br>And everyone's reaction to his actions are how people should be reacting to out normal kind of shounen heroes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuya as his disciple <br><br>At this point I don't really know what Sawatari sees in Yuya. His truly equal rival and the only one who can beat him? The person he aspires to be? His best friend?</br></br></br>  <br><br>If Fusion killed 6 xyzillion people then where are the corpses? WAKE UP SHEEPLE</br></br>  <br>I think Yuya's the closest thing he has to a friend who isn't one of his henchmen from back in Standard. He obviously looks back fondly on their time together in the MCS, since he called it their legendary duel.</br>  <br>He sees the deep seated unrest in Yuuya's soul that's bubbling out to the surface because of the loss of Yuzu and is desperately trying to preserve his optimism by reminding him of his entertainment duel</br>  <br> He obviously looks back fondly on their time together in the MCS, since he called it their legendary duel <br>I think its a nice bit of subtle development that Sawatari looks back on a duel he publicly lost with such fondness</br></br>  <br><br> "You can be my wingman anytime, Yuya" <br> "Nah. You can be mine" <br><br>Stop being such a Yuzufag Yuya ;__________;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So from this chart, Shun is the tallest, then Tsukikage, Dennis, Gongenzaka, NEO NEW SAWATARI, Serena, and Yuya?</br>  <br> Implying <br>Shingo will take his Princess back one day</br></br>  <br> Yuzu is Sawatari's princess <br> Serena is Dennis' princess <br> All the Yuyas get cucked in the end by a bunch of goofy motherfuckers <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there anyone Sawatari doesnt make a GOAT tier pair with?</br>  <br>Yuuto</br>    <br>Oh my god please don't give me ANOTHER boy to love</br>  <br><br> Implying Sawatari constantly calling out and making fun of Yuto's chuuni isn't cute as fuck   especially because Sawatari is super chuuni himself </br></br>  This is a good nii-san.  I wish Trump Witch could fusion summon in the Battle Phase IRL too. Maybe she wouldn't be so shit then.

Fujoshi Jump always delivers. There should be a new chapter of Birdmen up soon too.</br>  In case some of you missed it, PA Works will be doing Haruchika in 2016. MC and FeMC are osananajimmies and they both are in love with the same male teacher. <br><br>I don't know if there are TL of the novels but I guess prepare for NTR.</br></br>  I know you're all secretly waiting for Junjou Romantica subs.  <br>Every time, every season.</br>  <br>You got me until PA Works. They are going to butcher the original art for sure, like they always do.

Good taste, bitches.</br></br></br>  Cute.  <br><br> Fujoshi Jump <br>Speaking of which, a swimming sports manga is launching in jump next week.<br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-05/shonen-jump-launches-n<wbr>ew-sports-manga-series-in-33rd-issu<wbr>e/.90114<br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=124017<br><br>How homo will it be?</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>The chara look ugly, who cares</br>  <br>What makes the new girl worse is that this season will probably focus on her 'development', and ignore the other characters. Sorry Sugane.<br><br>His blush was the best part of the episode.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking Hajime <br>Go jump off a cliff-ssu.</br></br>  <br>Not at all. Also </br>  <br> Doesn't like Hajime <br> ugh </br></br>  <br>I bet you're the same anon who digs GATE's MC.</br>  <br>I just want my Joe fix.</br>  <br>I'm not. There's nothing wrong with his design, but his personality sucks.</br>  <br>I'll try it out. Though I don't have much hopes for homo. The author's track record doesn't really set a precedent for it. Unless he's finally trying to make some fujobucks.</br>  <br>I'm glad Joe is still licking his lewdpop</br>  <br>That's natural. Everyone else already had most of their development. I love confident Utsutsu borrowing OD's catchphrase and confident, not-depressed Joe. Besides, I like hotblooded characters  even if they're girls. </br>  <br>I have a feeling it'll soon get cancelled anyway. The art is subpar, we've got gay swimming with better designs already, and seems like fujos have stopped latching on to sports series in Jump (aside from existing long-running ones).</br>  <br> I just want my suffering Joe fix. <br><br>Fixed that for you.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad Diabloik is gonna focus on the other group the boys rather than the original. I want more Kaji Yuki shota.</br>  <br><br> liking a hyperactive one-note quasi-mary sue.  <br><br>Please acquire some good taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably because the same sports keep getting shit. If an author seriously wants some fujobucks for their new sports series, they should do one about hockey.<br>I want a hockey anime with cute guys so much.</br></br>  Cutest boys of the season:<br>1. Smug boy from Classroom Crisis<br>2. Joumachi no Dandelion's youngest otouto<br>3. Overlord MC</br></br></br>  <br> hockey <br>My African brother. There's Supinamarada!, but it's finished its run in Japan.</br></br>  <br>Ugh.</br>  <br>Why hasn't there been a martial arts or fighting sports shounen anime yet? You would think cute sweaty guys beating and grappling the shit out of each other each other would make the fujobucks fly.</br>  <br>Turkish oil wrestling?</br>  <br>Why the hell not?</br>  <br>It would be pretty homoerotic. I think fujos just like slight implications more than just straight up pandering (barring Free!). Or maybe it's that they don't like testosterone-fueled sports instead?<br>Shit's confusing. Either way, there needs to be more variety in sports manga.</br></br>  <br>Sports shounen are all about teams and teamwork. A boy buffet. The MC of a fighting manga has to be one hell of a MC to catch everyone's heart and I'm not an expert but spreading potential appeal out would seem safer.</br>  <br>Yeah. I'm still upset Tokyo Wonder Boys got cancelled, not because of the story but because had the mangaka tried another type of sport/genre I think people would have latched on to his work more. Shame, I kind of liked his chara design.</br>  best boy  <br>Baki the Grappler is just for you</br>  <br>Doujins with this guy and Rui when?</br>  <br>Why them?</br>  <br>Opposing ideologies, hero and villain, same birthday, etc..</br>  <br>There's Teppu at least, the girls are masculine enough to even make me kind of attracted to them</br>  We'll have another prince this week.  <br><br>Not to mention they are standing back to back in the OP.<br><br>Rui will continue to only get hatefuck doujins.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe this time it will have homolust, one of the new guys was Shuu's dear friend with a dramatic backstory. Sometimes otome adaptations go the gay route.</br>  <br>I'm only interested if Rui's the one on top.</br>  <br>Wrong</br>  <br>Wrong.</br>  <br> Why hasn't there been a martial arts or fighting sports shounen anime yet? <br><br>I'm fairly certain there's a fuckton of those.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It wouldn't be pandering unless that was how they decided to portray the sport. However, the team thing does make sense as it appears fujoshi would rather have quantity over quality.<br><br><br>I already watched it.<br><br><br>Teppu really surprised me. I didn't think they could ever make a serious MMA manga with a female cast, but it's pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> liking shit </br>  <br>Raj is a better prince.<br>Or I missed hearing FukuJun.</br></br>  <br>There aren't.</br>  <br>Darling is nothing like that ugly neet.</br>  Is there anything worth looking into this season? Only thing so far I'm interested in is Ranpo Kitan, but it's got a horrible director tacked onto it  <br> Overlord MC <br>You mean him?</br></br>  <br>I suppose if you cut out all the magic kung fu shit and boxing, that does leave things pretty grim.</br>  <br>Yes<br>I think it's cute how he's an awkward skeleton</br></br>  <br>Akagami no Shirayukihime is a fun shoujo without misunderstandings and is by base Bones.</br>  <br>There's that martial arts manhwa, The Breaker. From what I've heard about it, there are plenty of &gt;implications.</br>  <br>Papa bones is very moe.</br>  <br><br>Guess I'll have to pick up Overlord.</br></br>  <br>NNB and Wakako.</br>  <br>Don't download the HS release, funi fucked up so much that the framerate is a mess.

S2 is somewhat possible right?</br></br>  <br>I wasn't even aware it came back until I looked up today's animecalendar;<br>I don't think anybody in this thread will be watching it anyways.</br></br>  <br>Video game adaptations are always shit. It doesn't matter who's directing them. And DR and DeSu2 weren't that good to begin with.</br>  <br>Hopefully not.</br>  <br> those designs <br> that artstyle <br>At least make them attractive if you're trying to ride on the Free hype.</br></br></br>  <br> Danganronpa <br> Persona <br> Nasu shit <br> descent <br>/v/, please.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Minor is an understatement, but right now the plot development is a bigger problem than the pacing.</br>  <br>Looks like uglier Yoh.</br>  <br>They certainly are a descent.</br>  <br>DR and DeSu2 are fun.</br>  <br>Baki is the singular cute boy in the series, everyone else is a mutant.</br>  <br>DR is a lot of fun, and its sequel is genuinely good and Seiji blew the chances of that ever being adapted. DR is very fun but the show is lifeless and personalityless. He also fucked up the Persona adaptations.</br>  <br>Baki mangaka is a homo right?</br>  <br> danganronpa not decent <br>I came here to  lhope  at you.</br></br>  <br>This does ignore that literally all his adaptations, including his manga adaptations, are horribly and monstrously paced.</br>  <br><br>I don't disagree that they're fun, I like them as games. But storywise they're both only okay at best, so there's only so much you can do with an anime adaptation. And an adaptation of SDR2 would be a disaster no matter who was in charge and you know it.<br><br>And he didn't fuck up anything about Persona. They're shit games with shit stories. You can't get a good anime out of a bad story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how the current plot development is a problem compared to the bad pacing.</br>  For some reason I find this guy insanely attractive  <br>He has to be. He's like a Japanese Tom of Finland.</br>  <br>What philipino cartoon is he from ?</br>  <br>It varies from shot to shot but yeah he's pretty moe.</br>  <br>SDR2 does have a genuinely good story, all the characters are interesting and mostly have proper little arcs, it talks about what the school system does and subverts a lot of what is presented in DR1. You're right tho, SDR2 might be a bit of a hot mess regardless, but having someone with no idea how to pace a story would make it a wild trainwreck.<br><br>Just going to have to completely degree with you on Persona.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I agree that most of those work best as games. But he even managed to completely ruin the things people liked about DeSu2's shitty story.</br>  <br>Speaking of which, I'm still sad about Shaman King Flowers getting axed, because the magazine got axed.<br><br>Glasses guy and mc were fucking cute together.</br></br></br>  <br>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime</br>  <br> and its sequel is genuinely good <br>Gameplay wise, i'd agree. The second game's ending is complete bullshit though, and pretty much soured me on the whole story.</br></br>  <br>Guess I should try it out</br>  <br>Most nip fujos I talked with said they don't like obvious homo subtext. <br>I do think the majority of them prefer minimal implications so they can have more room for fantasizing and producing doujins.

Stop trying so hard.</br>  <br> The second game's ending is complete bullshit though <br>They tell you the ending the first hour in, and both characters are murders are generally way better.</br></br>  <br> It's really just Free that's an anomaly to this trend. <br>The five guys act no different than their usual cute girls doing cute stuff and Sousuke comes from some really bad doujin.<br>It's no wonder.</br></br></br>  <br> top 3 fujo doujin rankings for Comiket  <br>Which are they?<br><br><br>Zen a moe, zen a best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's cute but the most interesting thing about this show was Shirayuki, and that's isn't saying much.

Doesn't it also include the straight doujin?</br></br></br>  <br>Really grinds my gears about how even the creators behind P2 said Jun and Tatsuya are gay for each other (http://chthonian.net/persona/tsumi<wbr>/characters/tatsuyaisgay.html) and it'll never have an anime, and even if it did it probably wouldn't be decent considering how the P4 one turned out.<br>Fuck man, I wanna see Hitler in shades animated.<br><br>Browser game about sword boys.

Probably that Fate number is mostly stuff aimed at male otaku just like the Vocaloid one, though. I don't think the original list made any distinction between the types of doujin, just what series they were associated with.</br>  <br>I'd post this in a SB69 thread if there was one but some seiyuufags here would probably enjoy this week's Show By Radio.<br>http://hibiki-radio.jp/?radio_id=45<wbr>8</wbr></br></br>  <br>No, it's because by completely changing directions it turned into something retarded filled with bad writing. <br>Even if it had been like this from the start it would've still been terrible.</br></br>  <br>I miss the Shingans.</br>  <br>Yowamushi has more homo subtext than Free lol</br>  <br>I miss Yaiba's ass.</br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking?

There's not a lot of full homo stuff aside from low budget and badly done stuff</br>  <br>  Probably that Fate number is mostly stuff aimed at male otaku <br>I hate this.

It takes a bit to keep and maintain that figure of hers.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks OP, I'll be sure to do so!<br><br>The laziest! Her enormous natural talent enables her to shirk a lot of training.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127786533 <br> cancerous <br>That implies they show up in other threads, the tripwaifus tend to keep their shit here.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127786533 <br>But Ojii hasn't even posted yet</br>  She's not genki in the traditional sense, but she's always very busy.  I want to get drunk with her.  <br>:)</br>  I finally understand why it's hard to love others when you don't love yourself.  <br>Thanks!<br>I always will.<br> She's pretty active but still enjoys being lazy at times.<br><br><br>Now it's a party</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a somewhat healthy and active girl, keeping great shape and so.<br><br>If you and you're waifu were to go on a fantasy, sci-fi adventure or something such as that along different realms and worlds, what classes would you and you're be? Why would you both pick those classes?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you! I intend to do just that!<br><br>Oh, she is definitely more healthy and active.<br>She's almost always out and about, it's part of the job I suppose.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love my C.C.  tfw I'm away for a month and no daki ;_; <br><br>Health is a non issue for her, and she abuses that for all its worth by eating as much pizza as she wants and laying around all the time.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127786533 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127787199 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127787502 <br> one dipshit crying and samefagging <br>Did a waifufag push you in a locker or something</br></br></br></br>  <br>My waifu is dead.</br>  <br> responding <br>Report and ignore.</br></br>  <br>Healthy and active! She has to be, to be a good King for her peerage. Wouldn't be right for the leader to just sit back and allow her subjects do everything.<br><br>How does your waifu prefer to celebrate holidays and other festive occasions? How would you like to celebrate with her?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, I wouldn't do anything else.<br>She stays pretty active since she has to keep up with her magic practice and everything it takes to be an Enforcer.</br></br>  <br>Hard to pick just one, and it would have to depend on the setting. That said, I could see myself as a bit of either a thief or swashbuckler class (I have a thing for speedsters for some reason), while she'd go the way of either ninja or dancer (due to her thing for flashy moves).<br><br><br>She usually likes to spend them with friends. Since we've gotten together, I've been playing host to her friendly gatherings.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your waifu looks quite familiar. Who is she?</br>  Easy choice  <br>Fate Testarossa.</br>  <br>Mai is fit and physically active. Her athletic abilities are the second best among her circle of 6 friends.<br><br>Mai would be a lightly armored fighter; e.g. a Swashbuckler, since she's an agile swordswoman. (I guess I'd go with support caster.)<br><br>We don't really see Mai celebrate such occasions. I imagine that she'd like to do so surrounded by her friends.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is your waifu good at handling knives?  <br>Sonico can be a white mage, and I guess I'll be a swordsman. <br><br><br>She likes to dress up for special occasions. And we usually spend our holidays together. <br><br><br>I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure she can handle them fine.<br><br>What was the last piece of merchandise you bought of your waifu? I recently bought a daki, mousepad, and figma. <br><br> I've been cuddling with her 24/7 now. It's great. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thanks, OP!<br><br>She's quite average. She doesn't like to get out and run where there are a lot of other people, but she's not opposed to exercise<br><br>I think she's be more of a support caster, since she's not one for direct confrontation. I think I'd be some kind of ranged fighter.<br><br>Well, she does like to cook, so I'd say yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  All you're waifus a beautiful.  <br> attention-whoring normalfag trying to fit in with "le waifu meme" <br>I don't need to hear that from you.</br></br>  <br>I feel like she's the one taking care of me sometimes.</br>  <br>She'd be best for either a magic-based class or something more all-around, to compensate for her superhuman strength, reflexes, etc.  I'd pick something magic-based too, probably similar to Red Mage. Supporting roles suit me better. <br><br><br>To answer my own question, she enjoys spending them with her loved ones. Friends, family, her peerage, enjoying the celebrations with them is how she'd prefer to do things. I'm alright celebrating however she'd like to, though I prefer smaller gatherings.<br><br><br>She's pretty dexterous but I don't think she has any particular aptitude for knives or other weapons like that.<br><br><br>I pre-ordered a cushion of her that should be coming mid this month. Might pre-order her newest figure too, still waiting to see how it looks with paint.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> normalfag </br>  <br>Active, but not particularly healthy as she, among the others in her group are ever shown eating right. It's pretty odd.<br><br>If I'm to believe promo art, openly fun and loud times with her friends, which is pretty much the same on my end, barring anniversaries.<br><br>There was this one time she used a shard of a plate as a knife, but I can't say for sure. Throwing knives I would give a solid yes to, though.<br><br>Daki cover and her elusive messenger bag are on the way, but I got  some elusive key chains and a few sketch commissions at AX. Going to fill a sketch book with sketches of her. It's nice to have a goal for future AXs. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably in a more understated manner with her friends. She's not a particularly festive person, but she still enjoys those occasions. <br><br>I can imagine player her a rather straight forward physical class like a lancer that can throw itself into the fray or something more offensive like a monk. I'd probably play a hybrid class like a shaman, I'm indecisive like that.<br><br>Somewhat.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While she is a skilled professional swordswoman she has claimed being more confident in her magic based abilities, as such I picture her as a Spellsword with light armor and a focus on DPS.<br><br>As for myself, the delicate and precise art of magic doesn't appeal to me, instead heavy armor and large shields cater to my tastes.<br>Playing the role of Tank and soaking up damage to protect my beloved sounds a like a role I'd be happy to play.<br><br>When it comes to earthly festivities she has only heard stories for the most part.<br>When actually partaking in an earthly festivity she tends to get very excited and act upon all the stories she's heard like a little child.<br><br>She's a skilled practitioner of both hand to hand and sword based combat.<br>Give her a knife and I'm sure she'd use it well.<br><br>Another figure I bought a while ago.<br>Merch of her is rather outdated and incredibly rare at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that there are some answers out, who would you hire for your rpg party?</br>  <br>Thank you! She is indeed very wonderful, I love her so much.<br><br>She is pretty active, seeing as how she does a lot of track and field, and even went to America for a little while for track stuff.<br><br>Judging by her agility and whatnot, I'd say she'd be some sort of thief/assassin class, but it'd be cute to see her as a mahou shoujo-esque spellcaster, and that'd suit her personality more.<br>I'd be a nature-based mage, preferably a healer.<br><br>She's never really shown celebrating the holidays, other than shopping around during Christmas times. <br>I assume she celebrates them like most teenage girls and spends time with her family and friends.<br><br>I pre-ordered a figure of her that'll be coming some time next month unless it gets delayed, and I bought her petanko figure last month.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are there any foods you want to let your waifu try? I've always wondered if she'd like barbecue and stuff like that.  <br>In the thread or in general?</br>  <br>Thank you, I sure will. <br><br>Crona leads a fairly active life. He's not a track star or what have you, but he definitely keeps moving. Comes with the territory of being the Demon Swordsman, I suppose. <br><br><br>He could be a paladin, being a swordsman and all, and I'd opt to fill a supporting role. Whatever I can do to help him!<br><br><br>He usually gets together with his friends, but is sort of a wallflower. I don't blame him, it's understandable. <br><br>Depends on what holiday it is, I suppose. Celebrating at home is usually my defacto preference, and I think it's one he would share. I'd love to watch the ball drop on New Years while cuddling on the couch with him! I'd also like to watch 4th of July fireworks sitting on a hill somewhere by ourselves. <br><br><br>His sword, yes. He's pretty damn capable with it, I have to say.<br><br><br>The cards are the most recent pertaining mostly to him, I suppose. I bought the databook too, hopefully there'll be more art or whatever of him in it. But probably not, knowing how those things go.<br><br><br>There's a lot. He didn't exactly have a whole lot to choose from, growing up, so I'd like to make up for lost time and introduce him to a bunch. French toast and cinnamon rolls come to mind at the moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd fight with her sword, i'd probably pick a magic user.<br>She because she has experience with that, i because i'm not that strong. Also fun.<br><br><br>With her friends.<br>With our family.<br><br><br>Probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your waifu a cute too OP, and of course i will take care of my wonderful girl.<br>She must be between both, since she works on those games a lot, studying, and things like that.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127786533 <br>Well, the tripfags around here aren't like the other threads and boards.<br> They're the best ones <br><br> You still can, anon. <br> I'm sure she will find you in the right time, so don't lose hope <br><br>I would pick the fighter or healer, and she would pick a wizard.<br><br>Either she invites her friends or we would be celebrating together, it depends of what is the day.<br><br>For fighting? I don't think so<br>But for cooking, she's good<br><br>Yours too!<br><br>I have never purchased anything related to her, but will buy the manga as soon as i have money.<br><br>Everyone?<br>Since some games you can have a big team.<br><br>Maybe some italian or german food, so she can try something new instead of the usual japanese food.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based on the answers in the thread, since otherwise everyone would just take the ones with super powers.</br>  <br>Takao a super cute. Be a good husbando for her.</br>  <br>Your waifu a regular cute.</br>  <br>She can be a powerful air/wind mage due to her witch magic, and I'll be a stealthy rogue/assassin type as I'm rather good at remaining undetected.<br><br><br>By drinking and eating, both of which we do together!<br><br><br>Nope, Erica is a gun and magic user.<br><br><br>Just the daki, ages ago. More stuff to come in the future.<br><br><br>Bhut Jolokia hotsauce. I love the stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How big can the party be? <br><br><br>I'll probably let her try ribs and steak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rude. Everyone's waifu a super cute. <br>  </br></br>  <br>We could have a nice mage/archer combo. She can use her ridiculous archery skills and I'll be an ice mage, make targets easy to shatter and slow them from running out of range.<br><br><br>She prefers small get-togethers with her "family". <br>Just sitting up on a roof watching fireworks with her would be wonderful.<br><br><br>I have a hard time finding merch of her, I did find a daki but it was 250$<br> I'll probably buy it in a year though. <br><br><br>She can try anything she wants, though I would prefer if it was something mild. There has to be some way to get her away from spices.<br><br>Post the most recent image you've saved of you're waifu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should tell everyone to post their waifu in a swimsuit next just to make sure you flood the thread with images ASAP</br>  You are walking around town with your waifu after dinner, holding hands on a winter night, absentmindedly talking with her. After a while she gets a bit quiet. You're about to ask her what's wrong, but then notice  you accidentally walked her right into the love hotel district, and there's nothing but love hotels on all sides. <br>Idiot!<br><br>As you frantically explain that this wasn't intentional, your waifu is completely flustered and is staring silently at the ground.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uhm, 8, but you can only have 4 active members at any given time?</br>  If you love your waifu this much, you could sculpt a scale 1:1' statue of her, for fuck's sake  <br>Hamakaze a shit, worst 17th DesDiv member.</br>  <br> That's one pointy nipple there </br>  <br>She doesn't have any.<br><br>Whatever she wants, really. Something exotic and not exactly normal.<br/></br></br></br>  <br>She's pretty active.<br><br><br>I'd be a tank to protect her. Warrior specifically. She'd probably be a plate dps class.<br><br><br>Thanks loser.<br><br><br>She's more of a boxcutter lass herself, but she does great work with it.<br><br><br>Something that I've made myself, honestly.<br><br><br>Alter figure.<br><br>If you're waifu was the type to shitpost, how good do you think she'd be at it? How many replies do you think she would get on average?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone that can fill the role for physical damage well, maybe a damage tank to cover for us both so we can stay out of range.<br><br><br>I'm not sure. There's no shortage of a variety of foods for her to try in the city so if she ever wanted something in particular I'm sure we could find a place that has it.<br><br><br>She wouldn't be so embarrassed about something like that. If anything she'd tease me about taking her to such a place.  We'd stay for a while. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, moron. Go shitpost somewhere else.</br>  <br>Woah, what are you talking about? No need for hostilities, here.</br>  <br>Too good. I get the feeling I should be careful in case she decides to get a little stabby.<br><br>I'm in dire need of something new. The most recent thing I have of her is the pre-order of that Project Mirai game.<br><br>Wouldn't mind cooking some italian for her, though she isn't particularly fond of messy foods.<br><br>Fair enough.<br><br>Keep walking. It was obviously a lapse of judgement.  Though depending on how flustered, I could always risk seeing what happens if we go inside... <br><br>I doubt she'd get that many. Depends on how strongly people react to racial slurs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't even reply, just report.</br>  <br>My waifu wouldn't shitpost, she's not an insecure, mentally unstable manbaby like yourself.<br><br>For those unaware, report and ignore this idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.</br>  Holy shit look al all that cancer.  <br><br> replying to him <br>Idiots. Report the sperg and let him keep trying to shitpost and act like he has no idea what's going on, don't reply.</br></br></br>  <br>She's active but like everyone, she likes to be lazy some times.<br><br>Yuno a cute! I finished Hidamari Sketch yesterday, it was awesome but not long enough. Guess I'll have to stick with the manga.<br><br>She would be either a warrior or a leader. Something that has to do with protecting what she loves.<br>As forme, I wouldmost likely be a leader.<br><br>She normally spends the time with her friends, either staying chilling at home or going out to fun places. I wouldn't chance much of it when we celebrate. Of course, I would get her gifts.<br><br>No, since she hasn't tried, but I'm sure she would if she trained.<br><br>A 1/8 Yukata figure of her.<br><br>Italian food and my  cooking <br><br>Roger!<br><br>"So, shall we keep walking. It's getting late and we probably should be home soon." Without losing my cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I imagine she'd be pretty good at it. As for how many replies, I really don't have a good idea.</br>  <br>Definitely healthy and active! All that fighting will definitely burn some calories.<br><br><br>I'd have a feeling Erza would be the tank class since she usually wields swords and because she likes to dive right into battle, whilst I would probably be a mage/healer simply so I can buff her up when needed, (and also stay out of her way.)<br><br><br>She would most likely celebrate her holidays by partying with her guild members, which would probably end up getting half the town destroyed again. I don't mind how I celebrate with her as long as I get to spend some time with her.<br><br><br>Well swords are kind of like big knives, so I will say yes.<br><br><br>Bought a limited edition figurine of her two weeks ago. I just need to buy a case for it now.<br><br><br>Everyone here.<br><br><br>I would like to let her try some of my homemade cooking. Hopefully she will like it.<br><br><br>Tell her if she's scared she can close her eyes and take my hand. I will then lead her out of there safe and unharmed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will anon, i'm doing my best to be a great husbando for her.<br><br>Pic related<br><br>Oh damn.<br> That's a bit difficult to answer, since i don't know if she is blushing or not  But if she does, i will ask her if she wants to go, and if she says yes, then we would get the most expensive one and make lots of love. <br><br>Well, in modern days, some got the skills to draw her, or make a song for her.<br>And it doesn't matter what form it is, as soon you make something for her with love, it's still good.<br><br>She would shitpost on /v/ or /g/, in both she might get ~50 replies and then get a b&amp;.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> leader class <br><br>You lost me.</br></br></br>  <br>Take charge like a man and bring her to one without asking her if she wants to. Girls love men who take charge.</br>  <br> some got the skills to draw her <br>I mean't that some can draw THEIR waifu, not mine.<br> Sorry </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I would explain to her that I didn't mean for us to come here. She would be confused at first and then she'll understand it wasn't intentional. <br> Then I'll ask her if she wants to go inside. <br><br><br>I can't imagine her shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the food i cook for her.<br><br><br> implying it wasn't intentional </br></br></br></br>  <br>Miyako looks to be an expert archer.<br>Mai would serve as a quick close quarters combatant.<br>Rias has an arsenal of powerful magic abilties.<br>Rukia herself makes this a powerful party of 4.<br><br>It's a shame she hasn't experienced many different foods, as such I don't have a single food in mind, I'd like her to try all sorts of things.<br>Thought I suspect she's a got a sweet tooth.<br><br>This one.<br>She looks great in arabian clothing.<br><br>I tease her, saying something along the lines of "Whaat?~ Haven't you ever seen a place like this before? Don't these places exist in the soul society?"<br>The scene would promptly end with me getting a boot to the head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn powergamer.</br>  No image because I'm  at work <br><br>A bit of both. She needs to stay fit to battle witches and maintain her slim figure considering how much she eats, but she makes up for it by slacking off in equal measures. Her lazy side is very cute.<br><br>She'd be a lancer of course! I'd most likely support her as an archer or mage.<br><br>She'd probably hang out with her friends, doubtlessly at Mami's house with a huge cake to celebrate. I'm sure she'd take any excuse to eat Mami's cooking anyway. The two of us can celebrate  lewdly <br><br>The yukata scale fig from Aniplex. Very excited to recieve it. damn that shit's expensive though.<br><br>&lt;3<br><br>Can I say everything?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Say something nice about a waifu you normally don't notice!  <br>My own answer would be<br><br>Nepgear has both healing and buffing powers, along side being pretty durable and strong, so she'd fit the Paladin role really well.<br>I'm somewhat durable, with enough stamina to wear some heavier armor and weapon, I'd probably fit right in to the Warrior/Paladin role too, but I would probably be a tank.<br><br><br>Seems to enjoy them with her friends and family. I don't celebrate anything, but I'd probably do it with her to make her happy.<br><br><br>Somewhat good with it.<br><br><br>Last thing I bought was a daki cover of the commission I had bought a while ago. It's on its way.<br><br><br>Depends on party sizes, but if it's for say dungeons, some damage dealers and maybe a healer.<br><br><br>Maybe some Thai food.<br><br><br>This was one of them.<br><br><br>It depends. If it's the nonlewd option, I'd take a bit more serious tone and say it was not intentional, then I'd hold her a bit closer and tell her we'll go home.<br>If not  see if I can maybe get her to be okay with going to one then take her to one, feel hearts racing, watch something on a TV being really close together in just underwear, getting lewder by the minutes, then when we can't take it anymore, sex her all night hard rough love pounding  safe </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My waifu is the cutest! I love her and I want to always stay by her side! She is MY hero!  <br> 3496x2484 <br><br>Shit.</br></br></br>  <br> not being a hero for you're waifu </br>  <br>She is that kind of person who gets stuff done.<br><br><br>Usually i would go with tech/magic stuff but she would fit that role more. <br><br><br>Normal like everyone else i guess. And i would like to do that as well. No need for extraordinary things.<br><br><br>She is combat trained.<br><br><br>A mousepad.<br><br><br>Whoever doesn't quit after 5 minutes.<br><br><br>Stuff that i eat on weekly base. Otherwise? No idea.<br><br><br>Alright.<br><br><br>Tell her that it was a mistake and that home is a better place for that kind of stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is you're waifu a more healthy and active person, or a more lazy person? <br>I say she's pretty healthy.<br><br> If you and you're waifu were to go on a fantasy, sci-fi adventure or something such as that along different realms and worlds, what classes would you and you're be? Why would you both pick those classes? <br>That depends on many factors such as setting and classes. Whatever works best for her and me I guess.<br><br>Thank you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You come home one day to find your waifu  bent over, stuck in that window looking over your backyard that can't really be seen from outside. She says it closed on her while she was leaning out, and asks for your assistance. <br>What course of action do you take?</br>  <br>First, I'd wonder how she got stuck in a sideways-opening window...</br>  <br>Hate to be a killjoy, but I get her unstuck. Unless she makes a point of being stuck in the window. As long as it's consensual in the end, really.</br>  <br>Erza is a strong beauty that has a really cute side to her.  Long red hair is perfection. <br><br><br>I can't even draw, let alone sculpt. I'd be scared of what the end result would look like if I made an attempt. Maybe someday.<br><br><br>I  help her out the window since it's probably highly uncomfortable to be stuck like that, and embarrassing.   But grab her butt while helping her, because why not? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Post the most recent image you've saved of you're waifu. <br>Here is mine.<br><br>"This was an accident."</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a really huge image indeed.<br><br><br>Well, wonder how that'd happen.<br>I'd probably  accidentally make a lewd move, but help her out. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to be the most beautiful person for her. A heart that glimmers with kindness and joy.</br></br>  <br><br>She  gets sulky and says she was only pretending to be stuck in the hope that you'd do lewd stuff to her.<br>Bad end.</br> </br></br>  <br>Of course. Just my luck.</br>  You find your waifu watching cute animal videos at 3 a.m., what do you do?  <br> If you're waifu was the type to shitpost, how good do you think she'd be at it? How many replies do you think she would get on average? <br>I don't think she'd be successful unless she learns how to Carnac post. <br> hfw I catch her in the act of Carnac posting after several minutes of her doing that to me <br><br>Ask how she got stuck, then get her unstuck while applying oil if needed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A little bit of both, I'd say. Considering she'll spend most of her time either reading in peace or angrily chase her sisters around.<br><br><br>Blanc would probably be a paladin-like class (pic-related) that smashes enemies with her hammer. <br><br>Does your waifu also have friends? Would you also  befriend  them as well?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most recent image that I saved. Thank you to Audere once again for drawing her.<br><br><br>Kuroko is pretty cute. She makes me laugh in Railgun.<br><br><br>Tickle her feet, before helping her back in.<br><br><br>T-thanks dude!  Red hair masterrace. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm her hero. I'll always be there for her and protect her. <br><br><br>I would, but I can't sculpt for shit. <br><br><br> Take advantage of the situation, then later help her. <br><br><br>Watch some with her, because why not? <br><br><br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I love her beutiful lips and waist. <br><br><br> not doing a hero duo <br><br> Doing something lewd first    Like grabbing her legs slowly, then her ass, and lastly get her out of the window. <br> And of course, she will give me a slap for doing that <br><br> I'm sure you already are, anon. <br><br>Watch 'em with her.<br><br>She got her original game creation club and the "fake" one, i'm sure i can befriend them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep walking. I'd probably be flustered too.<br><br>Help her out. Maybe tease her about it too.<br><br>She has one friend, Lilly. I'm sure I could befriend her as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hug her from behind, then watch them with her.<br><br>She has her share of friends. If anything, I owe them for introducing me to her.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks OP, I will! Hibiki is a very active person and has been known to run in multiple marathons!<br><br>I want to drink Hibiki Suntory Whiskey with Hibiki! Also, nice trips!<br><br>I don't know enough about that stuff to even know what the classes would be!<br><br>She'd just jump right in! Experiencing new things has always been exciting to her! I'd like to celebrate it with all her friends!<br><br>Kitchen knives, if that counts!<br> pic related <br><br>I bought a patch of her for my PC!<br><br>Thanks and nice dubs!<br><br>I want to make her try some Del Mar Fair food!<br><br>Bite the bullet, cover her face, and make a bee-line out of there as fast as and as inconspicuous as possible. It would ruin her career as an idol if she were snapped by a tabloid in the love-hotel district.<br><br>That red-haired girl from Madoka Magica has a nice character design. It seems pretty familiar though, I wonder why?<br><br>Lightly tease her  by putting my hips and groin next to her soft bosom in a simulated standing doggy style while making a cheeky remark about skipping the dinner and the bath and getting straight to dessert. Then once I have my fill of teasing her , i'd help her out, give her a kiss and ask her how her day was.<br><br>Hell yeah motherfucker, i'd love to be friends with Takane and the rest of 765! Even more, i'd like to work there as an assistant/escort/security/etc.<br><br>Would you make dinner for your waifu or would she be the one making dinner?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch them with her. <br><br> Does your waifu also have friends? Would you also befriend them as well? <br>Yes and yes. I'm sure I can do that. Mako shouldn't be that hard to make friends with.</br></br></br></br>  Nico is healthy and active. She needs to keep up her idol figure.  <br>Ritsuko says hi!</br>  <br>Nico would be a dancer because obvious reasons. I'd probably just be a simple fighter or thief because its what I choose in my vidya games.</br>  <br>If she was ever stuck for more than a few seconds in so much as a cookie jar, I would ask if she's pretending to be stupid.<br><br>She has a small group. They're good people, so I wouldn't mind befriending them.</br></br></br>  I just had a nice dream about her last week. I was driving a black BMW X5 in the Alps heading towards a ski resort, where we rented a hut, where we wuld spend a week togerher. One of the most happiest dreams in my life. Last thing I remember that we cuddled before the firepalace under a blanket after arriving and planning where we would go skiing the next day.<br><br><br>What kind of music would your waifu listen to? Would you two be compatible?</br></br></br>  <br>Tease her for awhile, questioning how somebody as delicate and precise as her managed to get stuck in such a clumsy position. Then I suppose I'll help her out.<br><br>That honestly sounds like something she would do.<br>If she's enjoying herself, I'm not going to interfere.<br><br>Yes, The Karakura group are a colorful, friendly bunch. I'd befriend them, sure.<br><br>I doubt either of us are the most experienced cooks.<br>Instead we enjoy cooking together.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Last piece of merchandise that was released was a nendo I think, but I have my daki and nendo petits too.</br>  <br>Poor Nico and her lower quality...</br>  <br>I'd love to cook for her. I only really know how to make vegetarian dishes, which I doubt she's had much of, so that'd be something for her to try.<br><br>Alright. I still have no idea who the girl in the middle is, maybe Manami? It's not tagged as her, or anybody.<br><br>Prepare myself for a storm of angry, tsundere fists for being such a baka hentai and then try my best to explain the situation to her.<br><br>Watch them with her, duh.<br>I want to watch nekonabe videos with my cute waifu!<br><br>She has two circles of friends, and I'd try my best to befriend them.<br>I'd probably fit in better with her otaku circle of friends, but I'd still join in on shopping trips with her model friends and be nice to them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thank you, OP!<br><br>My husbando is very active. He loves the thrill of the fight, and all of his hobbies involve training to get stronger. I always do yoga in the mornings with my husbando and go for a jog with him to enjoy the scenic views around my house together, not to mention sparring!<br><br><br><br>He'd probably be some kind of magic barbarian and I'd be a martial artist. I've often imagined us being side-characters in a shonen manga who travel some fantasy world together looking for new opponents.  I want to sleep naked with my husbando in a tent under the stars in the driven snow, wrapped up together with furs... <br><br><br><br>He typically doesn't care for human holidays and it's not like he's able to celebrate his own culture's holidays. I tend to offer him a no-strings-attached date and meal during holidays just to keep things casual, it's only on special holidays like christmas where I'd ask him for anything more.<br><br><br><br>Well he's got two knives in his chest, so I'd say he's either very masterful with knives or very poor.<br><br><br><br> A doujin. I'm a little too shy to read it...! <br><br><br><br>Well thank you! <br><br>Yui is a lovely girl, Anon. You must be very happy together.<br><br><br><br>Anyone who's a healer. The healer class is one that speaks kindness and tenderness, but it's also very tough when you get down to the technicalities and what not. I could see a lot of anons and waifus here taking up the class, hence why I'm not naming any names.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My Senjougahara is very healthy and active, but can be lazy at times  <br><br> facebook <br>Go back, please.</br></br></br>  <br>Mai waifu is very fragile, if she over-exerts, she explodes and falls apart.</br>  <br>That'd be this one. Cute!<br><br><br>Perfect opportunity for some teasing and butt-slaps.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch and laugh along with her of course!<br><br><br>Hell yeah, everyone in her guild is super friendly, and they seem like a blast to be around.<br><br><br>Oh definitely her, I have zero cooking skills and Erza is a great chef. I would love to eat her cooking every day.<br><br><br>She hasn't shown any tastes in music yet from what I know, but I'm sure whatever they are, I will love them as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anon <br> tripwhore begging for attention everywhere he can </br></br>  <br><br>Ge-ge a  qt__ !<br><br><br>Both of us, probably.  And possibly with the help of Rom and Ram as well. <br><br><br>Classical/Orchestra music from  Lowee </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But we can do things like that inside!<br><br><br>Watch a few with her but that's not really my thing. <br><br><br>She's got quite a few of them. They're all good people, I'm sure I'd get along with them.<br><br><br>I enjoy cooking a lot and I'd like to believe I'm good at it. I'll gladly take care of all the cooking stuff, but cooking together with her sounds really nice too and I'm sure whatever we made would taste delicious.<br><br><br>Sadly it's never elaborated on whether or not she likes music and, if she does, the type she enjoys the most.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would switch. One night she would make something for me, and the next night I'll make something for her and so on. <br><br><br>She probably listens to pop and rock music. We both like rock music so that's good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Would you make dinner for your waifu or would she be the one making dinner? <br>I'm not good at cooking but I can try for her every now and then.</br></br>  <br>Watch it with her, I sometimes end up doing that.<br><br><br>Blanc is a real qt.<br><br>She's a good group of friends.<br><br>Though I would not want to be friends with any of them.<br><br><br>We'd take turns I'd imagine, or both of us cooking at the same time. Seems like a fun thing to do, and cooking in general is fun. I'd love to cook for her every day.<br><br><br>Can't recall her having any specifics, but I think she'd enjoy pop mostly, but be open to a lot.<br>I like a lot of rock, so maybe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  why are TM waifus so god tier  <br> we can do things like that inside! <br>And where's the fun in that?</br></br>  <br>We would take turns, though clearly one would take the initiative if it was to surprise the other.<br><br>She's more into trance, Latin, and Jazz. I'm afraid our tastes in music clash, but there's something to be learned from having an interest in different genres, especially when both have a thing for good music in general.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Help her get unstuck. Only after teasing her a bit.<br><br><br>Watch a few more with her, then tell her to get back in bed with me.<br><br><br>She does. I wouldn't be able to become friends with all of them but i would at least not have problems with them.<br><br><br>I would.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Well thank you!  <br><br> Yui is a lovely girl, Jebus. Go become a prostitute for sasquatches and die being known as the first to get sasquatch AIDS, you cancer-ridden faggot. <br><br>I dunno, Anon. That doesn't have as nice a ring to it. Maybe I should stick to being polite.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A little bit of both.<br><br><br>No idea. I can be pretty open as well as pretty critical in regards to my musical tastes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Did she survive the Godzilla onslaught? </br>  I can only assume healthy and active. Must be, considering her line of work.  How long is your waifu's skirt?  <br>Probably on "slut."<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>    <br>moot?<br> 127794737 <br>About halfway between proper and flirty<br><br>Now take your 3DPD shit out of here</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have more cooking experience than she does so I would be the one cooking most of the meals.<br>We'd probably switch it up every so often, though.<br><br>Lots of j-pop and denpa/moe-pop stuff.<br>She probably listens to a lot of songs from eroge openings, I can see this being one of her most listened to songs https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cys<wbr>YjbJuMIg</wbr>  [ ] (warning for lewd)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both, sometimes i will cook for her, or she will cook for me.<br>But if it's a special occasion i will cook for her, so she won't get tired.<br><br>She would listed to the OST of her favorite games, or some instrumental music too.<br>We would be compatible with the OSTs, but i love other genres that she might not like, but we would be listening to some tracks together, along with some hugs and drinking tea.<br><br>Pic almost looked like scars.<br> Scary <br>Proper length when we go out, and flirty when we make love.<br>And don't post 3D here anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my waifu only wears a shirt anon</br>  <br><br>I can imagine her being pretty lazy Yomiko's not exactly the athletic type.<br><br><br><br>Yomiko would be an archer using her paper as arrows or maybe a spell caster, no idea which class I would pick. Maybe a caster too since I've never been that big on melee.<br><br><br><br>Snuggling together and enjoying a good book as always of course.<br><br><br><br>No idea, she can slice them in half with her paper skills though.<br><br><br><br>Yui is a beautiful and energetic girl<br><br><br><br>I'd love to cook her a paella <br><br><br><br>Love hotels aren't really my style, we'd try and get out there then go back home for some loving.<br><br><br><br>Get her unstuck though somehow I think we'll end up stuck together but I'd make sure not to let that happen.<br><br><br><br>Grab some tea and just relax with her watching until I fall back asleep or we're sleeping comfortably together.<br><br><br><br>I'd befriend Nene, I like how ballsy she is and The Papers seem like a really cool bunch, I'm not as big as a fan of Hemingway as Maggie is but I've got a few of his novels. Discussing them with her would be cool but I think they'd like manga more than Yomiko.<br><br><br><br>Shared responsibility but I would be the one doing it most of the time.<br><br><br><br>She's a fan of Beethoven according to the OVA<br><br>What was the last thing you dreamed about of your waifu? My most recent one is where we're in bed together preparing to sleep then I dig out a giant book of Shakespeare sonnets and read Yomiko a couple while she's holding onto me until she's fast asleep. After that I put the book back on the nightstand, pat her head then kiss her, switch off the light then cuddle her too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She would. She likes to cook, after all, and I'd love to eat her creations.<br><br>It isn't said what she might like, but probably something relaxing/soothing, although that varies from person to person.<br><br>Well, she doesn't like showing much skin, but it's usually a normal length with stockings to cover her skin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think somewhere between cheeky and flirty.</br>  Super active.<br>She works out non-stop.<br>Well, she stops, because overtraining is a no-no, but being a warrior being healthy and active is a major part on her life.<br><br><br>I'd be an archer and she'd be a warrior I suppose.<br>I could get into bows and stuff, and she already is a warrior.<br><br>I suppose she'd have to carry for me, at first.<br><br><br>She doesn't celebrate anything at all, as far as I know.<br><br><br>She handles two in her every day life.<br><br><br>The OS figure.<br>I'd love to buy the combat cards and stuff.<br>I really should.<br><br><br>o-okay<br><br><br>TAKE THE WAIFU  home. <br> And make love there. <br><br><br> Kiss her buttcheeks and girly place and then  help her get unstuck.<br><br>Still, I'd have to ask how on Earth did she, of all people, get stuck there.<br><br><br>Depends whether the following day is a week day or not.<br><br><br>She had one.<br>They don't meet much anymore, however.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she is.<br><br><br>Going with Conquer classes because I don't know a lot about other games that have them. Ninja-&gt;Warrior-&gt;Fire taoist for me, I think pure Trojan for her, but I could also see her going with pure Ninja or the same rebirth path as me. For both of us, it'd need to be something that makes at least some sense in a competitive PvP setting, and a class with high damage output.<br><br><br>A bootleg daki cover.<br><br><br>Salmiakki.<br><br><br> As you frantically explain that this wasn't intentional <br>I wouldn't do that. I'd pretend that it was my intention to go there all along.<br><br><br>About Akari?<br><br><br>Ask her if she wants company.<br><br><br>Yes, yes.<br><br><br>Well, only one of us has a physical body in the 3D world so it has to be me. She's better at it than I am, though. I would make tea for her even if we weren't restricted by our difference in the number of dimensions.<br><br><br>Mostly rock, but other genres are fine too as long as the music is rhythmical. I probably listen to extreme metal and EDM more than other genres, but I'm very interested in a lot of different genres and I love all kinds of music as long as it's good, which means that our tastes in music overlap very much in practice.<br><br><br>Between flirty and cheeky.<br><br><br>The last dream I remember was the one where I saved her and an unknown friend of hers by sawing off the head of a mad scientist who was trying to perform a dangerous brain experiment on them against their will. Pretty sure I had another one after that, but I don't remember what happened in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I find this scale appropriate.</br>  <br> above the knee is flirty <br><br>Hey grandpa.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you OP.<br><br>Yup, Miku is really active and healthy.<br><br><br>I'd probably be an average class or something along the lines of a shield bearer. Miku would most likely use magic or healing spells.<br><br><br>Most likely spending time with a well sized group of friends.<br><br>I don't really like spending time with a lot of people, but I'd make an exception for Miku.<br><br><br>I don't think she could do any amazing tricks with a knife, but she wouldn't be clumsy enough to cut herself.<br><br><br>Two snow Miku plushies.<br><br><br>Not really. What I'd really like is to try her cooking and dishes instead. There's nothing really special about the typical murican food I eat.<br><br><br>Alright.<br><br><br>I'd just laugh and tell her that I didn't even notice the hotels. I'd hold her close, caress her, give her a small kiss and continue walking home.  Where we would vent our lewd thoughts togheher under the warmth of our blankets. <br><br><br>It's driving me into despair.<br><br><br>I'd help her get out. I wouldn't want to embarrass her. Miku wouldn't be able to stop blushing and letting moans slip out if I did, and it'd devastate her if the neighbors saw her in that situation.<br><br><br>Cuddle and watch together. Make some tea/hot cocoa for her.<br><br><br>Yup. Luka, Rin, and her many other Vocaloid friends. Although she'd mainly hang out with Rin and Luka. I'm sure we'd get along.<br><br><br>I just listen to random genres and whatever sounds good. I'm pretty sure Miku could recommend me some good music.<br><br><br>It varies in length in artwork, concert holograms, etc. But it's usually kinda of short and above her thigh highs. Very cute.<br><br><br>In your opinion, what is your waifu the queen of?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Everything! I get a heart boner when I see cute baras enjoying my food, and of course my husbando is the cutest bara of all. On top of that, my husbando probably hasn't tried many human foods. I want to make him big, fluffy pancakes in the mornings. I want to make him big barbecue ribs and the both of us get barbecue sauce everywhere while we're eating them. I want to eat tasty pork buns and boiled eggs with him for lunch. I even want to make a big pot of potato soup in the winters and eat fresh-baked christmas cookies together in the winter!<br><br><br><br>I saved a lot of images recently. This one, I think?  I want to be childhood friends with my husbando! <br><br><br><br>To break the awkwardness, I state that it's super chilly out here and that it must be his fault for dawdling.  Then while he's got his guard down and trying to work out why I'm suddenly so displeased with him, I lean myself up toward him, whisper for him to "Take responsibility and go warm me up", and finish with a little tug on his earlobe with my lips. <br><br>There! Situation resolved.<br><br><br><br>I could also rent a room in an art studio, cover the floor in paper, strip naked, cover my body in paint, and do a massive portrait of him.<br><br>I'm really busy though, so I guess I'm not.<br><br><br><br>Decent, I'd suppose? I mean he'd probably be shitposting on /fit/ and that's just easymodo.<br><br><br><br>Sonicobro wasn't here the last time around, so I'll say that Sonico looks very comfy and huggable!<br><br><br><br>Can't he just phase through the wall? What a baka. I sit on his butt as punishment.<br><br><br><br>Show him the video of the squeaky moth.<br><br><br><br>He doesn't really have many friends, and I can't say I enjoy hanging out with prison scum. I'd probably enjoy chilling with Joseph, though!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She survived it pretty well, though now I'm tempted to give her some exposure to the Heisei era.  <br><br><br>It's been a long time since the last one. For some reason she was cosplaying as an extremely touchy and affectionate Talia Al Ghul.<br><br><br>She is the Queen. She is A-Number One.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the laziest<br><br><br>I'd be a hunter, always am in muh vidya. Mako would probably make a good rogue-ish class too.<br><br><br>doesn't have any reason to be, so no<br><br><br>daki. gonna buy a fig soon though<br><br><br>try (and fail) to play it cool and turn right around. <br><br><br>tease her while I help her out. <br><br><br>recommend some of the ones I've seen. Saw a great documentary about bees once. <br><br><br>yes, and yes some of them. <br><br><br>we'd take turns. Both lazy. <br><br><br>she hasn't shown a preference, but I like pretty much anything so it'd be fine<br><br><br>about average anime length i guess? not too lewd</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Showa her to your own monster. </br>  <br>Flirty and above <br><br><br>I can't remember  We probably did something lewd. </br></br></br></br>  <br> What was the last thing you dreamed about of your waifu?  <br>It was the 1950s and we were married.</br></br>  <br>Forgot my picture.</br>  <br>I was singing "Vivo por ella" to her.<br>I guess i was thinking that i could sing like him one day, so two of the things i love got mixed in that dream.<br><br> I would seriously love to sing "Vivo por ella" with her, but the the closest thing would be making her seiyuu sing with me, but for now i have to sing alone. <br><br>Queen of  my heart. <br><br>Anyway, i have to go now, have a nice evening with your waifu.<br> Hoping you all see the sunset with your waifu. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>According to my calculations joining forces with a ranged character like Miyako would likely result in the highest amount of mutual benefits.<br><br>I'd like to see her try köttbullar or some of our various sausage variants.<br><br>I guess it's not the most favorable depiction of her.<br><br>It'd depend on how lucky I feel, but in most cases I'd try my best to keep walking after a long and awkward moment of silence with her. It's not like we're dependent on it.<br><br>She's far more likely to be the type to feed trolls with her hotblooded earnestness.<br><br>Ritsu is best K-On!<br><br> beat me to it, darn.<br><br><br>Don't bother her, it's the best time to visit the nice corner of the Internet. She'd be too embarrassed if I were to intervene, I'd rather tease her about it in the following morning.<br><br>I'd certainly love too, I really like Anzu's laid-back nature and Yuzu playful teasing of Momo.<br><br>She has more experience, but I'd gladly assist her.<br><br>Provocative. the show's character designers are quite fond of short skirts.<br><br>I dreamed about her being in charge of a mountain town that was pivotal in the war between humanity and necromancers that happen to be giants that ride dragons inhabiting the mountain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to tell but I think it borders between cheeky and flirty, which is perfect for Erza.<br><br><br>I have this one dream that we're out punting along one of the rivers in Fiore. It's night time and she's sitting down gazing at the stars whilst I push the boat along gently. Eventually we settle down in a nice quiet spot and I take a seat next to her. As we both look up at the night sky, she rests her head upon my shoulders. After a while I  propose to her. <br><br><br>Well since she has the nickname Titania, I guess she is the queen of the fairies</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really like the way they're described.<br>But It's around the "cheeky" spot, I guess.<br><br><br>I know I dreamed of her last night or the one before, but I can't remember what it was. I know I saw her face.<br><br><br>My heart.<br>I don't really know.<br><br> I'm just gonna sleep now because my eyes hurts too much. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My waifu is a fucking angel.<br><br>An angel, damn it.</br></br>  <br>A walk in the countryside upstate was the last dream I had of her. We  held hands .<br><br><br>My heart. She could be queen of the whole world if she wanted.<br><br><br>Good night, Takaobro.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd usually cook because I enjoy cooking. I definitely wouldn't mind him cooking something for me or helping me out, though. In fact, a dinner made by the whole family seems pretty fun and rewarding!<br><br><br><br>I dunno. Knowing Araki, probably some kind of cool rock-and-roll music or dad rock. I mean, I enjoy heavy metal, italo-disco, and synthwave, so I'm sure we're compatible enough.<br><br><br><br>Considering how old-fashioned that graphic seems, he's "By gods, a savage! Fetch my elephant gun!" length.<br><br><br><br>I can't remember. It's depressing because my medication is supposed to give me vivid dreams. Where are my hard-earned husbando dreams, huh?<br><br><br><br>My husbando is the king of honorable battles!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dream <br>Hah, I wouldn't call them dreams, the only memories I retain from my sleep are frequently negative, consisting of death.<br><br>I'm cradling her in my arms while she whispers to me in a weak, hushed tone, telling me she has no regrets, that she lived a good life and that she was truly happy to have met me, before telling me to be strong and live a long happy life as she dies in my arms.<br><br>I'm convinced this has come about from my unending anxiety and paranoia surrounding Rukia's possible death in the future of Bleach's manga.<br><br> Apologies for the morbid post, there is supposed to be a happy, light air to these threads. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you're waifu <br>Last week was a good week; I have to let go of that already.<br><br>Anyway, Rin isn't actively active, but she's not lazy either; if anything, her work as an idol keeps her fit, but she does genuinely enjoy exercising, so that's always a good thing.<br><br><br>Generally-speaking, I'd probably be more of the DPS/tank role while she'll have to be my healer/support, keeping me alive and buffed while I fight, something I'm good at. Although really, she could pass for a combat class herself, given the Dice de Cinderella game and what she could do with actual sword training. We could totally rock dual DPS.<br><br><br>Being a good cook, I'd hope so. Being around me, I'd hope so.<br><br><br>A phone strap/screen cleaner from Surfers Paradise. Hoped to replace my old Cospa strap with it, but ehh...I think I might hang this in my car instead.<br><br><br>Lee's Chicken. It's totally better than the KFC Mio brings around the office. Too bad Japan doesn't have it.<br><br><br>Rent a room and trash the it like rock stars; nothing more, nothing less. Party on, dude!<br><br><br> that doujin <br>You son of a bitch. That better not be from what I think it is.<br><br>Anyway, I take my hands and turn them upside-down while I place them underneath the window frame, utilizing all muscles in my arm from the deltoid to the forearm to lift in an upwards motion. That's what I'd do.<br><br><br>Karen and Nao are among my favorite idols too, so yes, Rin's friends are my friends too. Oh, Uzuki and Mio are good girls too, I suppose.<br><br><br>I don't see why we can't make it together! Two cooks in the kitchen are better than one...as long as one doesn't have a big ego, nya!<br><br>If you could get your waifu a car or motorbike, what would you get for her? <br><br>I'd like to get her a 4th gen Viper SRT-10 Coupe, blue with black racing stripes. But if that's too much speed for her, I'd just get her a classic black 5th gen Mustang convertible that she and her idol friends can cruise in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The queen of my heart and soul. <br><br><br>See you later friend, have a great time with your waifu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is the Queen of Ice and Snow.<br><br>A Motorbike.<br>While I'm not at all automobile savvy my Father is a massive Motorcycle buff and as such while I lack intricate knowledge on models and types I find Motorbikes a lot cooler than cars.<br>Besides, I feel like she'd have much more fun riding a Bike than sitting inside a Car.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her skirts are short enough to make any old man/neckbeard try to scold her and whine about how there's no more pure girls left in the world.<br><br>Oh, man. It was a few months ago while I was really sick.<br>I had a dream where we were on a train together, and she was resting her head on my shoulder while we looked at a magazine together. There was more to it but I can't really remember it now, I just remember that it felt very real and amazing.<br><br>The queen of imoutos!<br>and also the queen of my heart, of course.<br><br><br>Goodnight.<br><br>I can't say I'm all that familiar with car names, but something flashy and girly would fit her nicely, like a pink convertible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Is she your princess blue?</br>  <br>A phone strap of her.<br><br>Mai has difficulties eating most types of food, so probably not.<br><br>Help her out.<br><br>Yes. She hangs out with 5 friends. They're pretty nice people.<br><br>Mai is an excellent cook, but I don't think she ought to prepare food all the time.<br><br>We never see her listening to music.<br><br>Perhaps it's on the "asking for it" category.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't exercise, but she's no lazy<br>She works hard to give everyone the best out of her support abilities<br><br><br>She'd be a healer and buffer, I'd be a tanky warrior<br>Mainly because she's always worried about protecting people and I'm pretty tall and a bit beefy<br><br><br>If there's fireworks she'd definitely prefer being outside, but otherwise we'd do something together in doors<br><br><br>I'd like to give her some ravioli or pizza<br><br><br>She's a pretty faithful person, and she never gives up even if she's dealing with stuff she doesn't quite understand<br><br><br>Help her, of course<br><br><br>Tell her it's pretty late and it's not healthy for her to be up at this hour, suggest we get a puppy or cat if she likes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is a really healthy person. She goes running, swims, and makes all her meals at home with good ingredients. I don't see her getting sick from anything she does soon.<br><br><br>I always felt like stealth would suit Ai in fights, so maybe an assassin.<br><br><br>A garage kit of her. It's very nice<br><br><br>Some really spicy food that my family can make. I'd want to see if she would like it or not, or if she can handle spicy food at all.<br><br><br>Ok.<br><br><br>I didn't see her in it, but I know it was about her. I heard a voice sounding like an old lady telling me "I hope you meet a good woman soon" to which I replied "I already met a good woman." Then I woke up. Not too elaborate.<br><br><br>I don't know a thing about cars. However, one of my professors said the only reason she has a Mercedes Benz is, not because she wants to feel like a badass with an expensive car, but because if something goes wrong with it, they'll come pick up the car themselves, give you a rental, and drop it off at your house when the repairs are done. <br><br>So that. Make things easy for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I jej'd.</br>  <br>I consider her the queen of gap moe.<br><br>Either a first-gen Renault Twingo, Skyline GT-R R33 or a Bentley 4½ Litre, depending on the budget.</br></br></br>  <br>She's the queen of my heart and soul/<br><br>I know nothing about cars. Something cheap and effective?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I don't know how much my opinion is worth, but I think that even though having a waifu is wonderful and there are a lot of positive things about our waifus that we usually discuss here, not everything can be the happiest experience with your waifu ever, and I'd say it's even more important to talk about the more difficult things. Being a waifufag already (usually) involves a lot of hiding stuff from other people, and there's a limit to how much people can comfortably hide from everyone, so I think you shouldn't have to apologize for that.</br>  <br> flustered and staring silently at the ground <br>I'd ask if she was sick since she isn't normally like this. I'm surprised she hasn't attempted dragging me inside one yet.<br><br><br>Kurome's hairstyle is really cute.<br><br><br>She did that on purpose I bet. I'd ignore her for about 15 minutes and then help her out. She'd be pouting at me the whole time.<br><br><br>Continue watching cute animal videos with her, I don't sleep till 5 anyway.<br><br><br>She has a small group of amazing friends.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127785974#p127797389">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   They don't like Nico    threads keep dying but going back up anyway   <br>Nico a actual shit</br>  nico a best.  <br><br>Nico would be the only Muse who after a 10 year timeskip would end up fat and overweight</br></br>  Best  <br>Pls.

I can't believe a series this popular is totally lacking in subbed BDs.  <br>Don't think they abandoned it, but they're putting other shows as priority.</br>  <br><br>Not to mention Jap BDs already have eng sub included. If can bare with meh translation then you can just find the raws that have BD sub.</br></br>  <br>Wait... what? That's the first time I've heard of that.</br>  <br>It's been over two years and all they need to do is slightly adjust their old sub files to make them fit over the BDs.</br>  What are the best episodes for maki? I don't really like any other character, but maki get's me real hard, and she's cute with nico.  <br>S1 ep10 is great, same with s2 ep2.<br>It's cute how she  still believes in santa .</br></br>  Who's better:<br>Mini-Maki or  the "Singer"? </br>  <br>Both seasons have eng sub in JP BD. Not even kidding.</br>  <br>Big Nico.</br>  <br>This... this is amazing. I needed to know this.<br><br>Now, the question is will it be the same for the movie?</br></br></br>  <br>...you realize both of them are magic beings, right?<br><br>Anyway, Mama Yazawa was awesome.</br></br></br>  <br>Most likely. It is airing in the us soon, so they would have to add subtitles for it.</br>  <br>I don't see why not since international screening is on the way. Several major cities will get their raibus movie.<br> Unless you live in yuropoor. </br></br>  <br> Canada seems to often be forgotten. </br>  <br><br> Poor EU and Canadia. </br></br>  <br>The thing is they can just cross the border and go to nearest one.<br>Yuropoor just have to cross the big fucking pond or fly to Asia.</br></br>  <br>Yep. I have a Skype contact who is planning to hope across the border to see it in NYC.</br>  <br>Maybe if you live close enough to an american city showing the movie. But if you don't, things aren't any better compared to EU.</br>    From what I've read, the movie is more of the same  except for being endgame for µ's, and the best endgame for µ's as their 2nd to last concert involved getting every idol in Japan to sing one song (Sunny Day Song doesn't sound like 200+ idols sung that shit though). Also, as I've said so many times, we have another Maki magic thing with "The Singer". Is she some future Honoka? Maybe. God knows.   Do you guys actually like the idol music or do you just like the girls?  <br>It depends.</br>    <br>Both</br>  EliUmi is OTP  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br><br>ded pairing</br></br>    <br>Been reading that for a few years.</br>    <br> I want to get off NicoNii's wild ride. </br>  <br>Depends on the group. I never got into AKB48 and I would never have followed µ's had it not been for the brilliant song that is Bokura no Live, Kimi to no Life.</br>  <br>Most idol anime fans are very far away from being real idol fags.<br>On the other hand, they usually like their franchise's music or the kind of music. I'm not huge into Love Live music, but there are a dozen or two songs I like to play. I was also very much into Im@s music.</br></br>  Maki a best    <br>HEY, COUSIN, YOU WANT TO GO BOWLING?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fUC<wbr>CWm24HUs</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Are there any doujins of the Raibus kicking Nozomi's phat ass for groping them?</br>  You know a LL thread goes downhill when Eli gets mentioned.  <br>Awkward Maki is the best Maki.</br>  <br> not worshiping at the feet of our true lord and saviour Elichika </br>  <br>Go choke on several dicks.</br>  Honk  Heyyyy it's Nico   produce Love Live merchandise of anything  <br> watch everything fly off the shelves faster than you can restock </br>  Fuck Rin.  <br>Only the best.</br>  <br> LolisRDead !!IUGo3Uwjz01 <br> Likes Nico. </br></br>  So, there's this Maki porn game that's being posted sometimes on /a/ or /llg/, does anyone got a source on that?

S1 showed that participation in LL was secondary to saving the school, which has been accomplished, so Honoka has little incentive to participate in LL since she feared that she will repeats the same mistakes. Honoka was scared of hurting her friends again. Only when they told her they wanted to do it for the seniors' last chance as school idols; and they realized her reasons for hesitation and promised to help her that Honoka decided to participate. <br><br>Student council works are responsibilities that have to be fulfilled and a contest does not change that. It is one of the reasons Honoka scared to join LL in S2E1. Reminder that in S1, they would not be allowed idols unless the baka trios pass exams. Balancing school and idol is the major recurring theme throughout the anime, school budget debate is also an example. <br><br>Yeah, that snow walking was overdramatic but you have to consider fans of the real idol group went through the worst snow storm in Tokyo history where the real trains didn't run to participate in their Live at Saitama earlier in the year. That whole sequence might have been a nod for fans of the franchise.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw no one cares about cat. <br>Such is a life of not being a  centa </br>  <br>*S2E1</br>  I love Maki-chan's nasally voice!  <br>It has its moments.</br>  <br>thanks<br><br> doesn't fit screen <br>fug</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's normal… <br><br>(Nexus 5 here.)</br></br></br>   I like Nico because she is short, flat-chested, wears twintails, and because I doubt she likes her own cutesy pose/catchphrase/persona herself all that much but does it anyway because she knows it sells. <br><br>pretty much this, but hanayo best gril</br></br>  <br> because she knows it sells. <br>But it doesn't, no in the show at least.</br></br>  <br>Not in the show, but in life it does.</br>  <br>BE-BETSUNI</br>  Who the hell are you quoting?  <br>For </br>  <br>You, silly.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CwF<wbr>PjiVk_mM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I'm quoting you baby.</br>  <br> you will never experience this in real life </br>  <br> japan <br> 4 children <br>ayy <br>And here I thought Danna was a chil-propaganda.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Good :^)<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sqr<wbr>SXISDNE0&amp;index=16</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>And no Dad anywhere to be seen.

I'm pretty sure eli took over the choreography once she joined, since she has actual experience with dancing.</br>  <br>The costumes &amp; honking parts still remain true though... unless there's something I don't know about the honk</br>    <br>why is honk so fat?</br>  <br>... dammit!</br>  <br><br>Well, Sea keeps the Honk in check too, probably even more than Burd.</br></br>  <br> tfw you realize MC of Love Live is a girl and Nico totally wants her </br>  <br>It's a joint effort.

Not every girl is born with giant boobs. <br>Most likely she was designed that way to play off Maki, who has a mature body, but a naive and childish personality.

Who could hate Rinko?  How would Evangelion be different if Asuka had been the MC instead of Shinji?  The point of the entire show would be moot.  Third Impact happen on episode 5  <br>It'd still be shit. Fuck off waifufag.</br>  Masturbation, menstruations and insanity  That masturbation scene on the beginning of EoE would be super interesting.  Kaworu would have fixed her.<br><br>Asuka's problem is that she desperately wants to feel loved and has a massive inferiority complex. Kaworu is a being that loves unconditionally, selflessly and completely, and so he would've had a positive influence on her.</br></br>  <br>No it wouldn't.<br>Asuka still has problems making interpersonal relationships without Shinji.</br></br>  <br>Although Asuka has a man's jaw, I don't think that would be enough for Kaworu.</br>  <br> No it wouldn't. <br> Asuka still has problems making interpersonal relationships without Shinji. <br>You missed the joke, I think.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu was attracted to the flaws and fragility in people, things like gender are irrelevant to him. Had Asuka been in Shinji's place Kaworu would have probably fallen in love with her all the same.</br>  <br>I thought about it, but I don't think a joke of this magnitude is in order.</br>      <br>they are love rival</br>  <br>More like lovers.</br>  <br>they can love rival eachother while they fuck in the bedroom</br>  <br><br>Dont forget their interactions wouldve been hilarious.</br></br>    <br><br><br>Thanks /a/, now i want this to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>kek, those kids sure are wacky</br>  <br> Not this </br>  <br>who's moot</br>  <br>That's incest, you faggot.</br>   Kaworufags ruin an eva thread before it can even begin <br><br>At least it was a shit premise to begin with.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>The thread was started by a Kaworufag, you retard.</br>  <br>why she is in the plugsuit?</br>  it would be the same steaming pile of shit  <br>all the children are flawed and have weaknesses. the series wouldn't have been any different, other than rei being a boy instead</br>  <br>Any paring involving Rei is incest since she's the mother of all life</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  I wouldn't give a fuck because Eva would still be the pretentious piece of shit that fanboys eat out of Anno's ass.  <br> Be me <br> Go in thread <br> 'Maybe this will be less cancerous than the last eva thread <br> horriblemistake.jpeg <br><br>Anyway, It would have been more obvious from the beginning that Asuka wasn't really an asshole she was just so fucked up that she had to put up a front and be overly agressive with everyone she met. She probably would have an more obvious arc towards resolving this and Shinji and Rei's passivity would have looked 10x's worse through her lens. <br><br>In a way Shinji is a nice balance between Rei 'no fucks given' Ayanami and Asuka 'SIMPLY THE BEST' Soryu<br><br> Pray that storyboard-chan does not ruin this thread </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She would be a dyke to keep some of the same thematic focus involving sexuality as she lusts after Misato, Rei, and Hikari.</br></br>  <br>How's that butt burn from the last thread treating you?</br>  <br> Hikari <br> flawed <br><br><br>Is it your first day here? Eva threads are usually this cancerous</br></br></br></br></br>  Episode 24 would have been praised as the greatest love story ever told  <br>The Only thing burning my butt would be the liquid shit I took after consuming so many of his tears last night.<br><br>I'm naive and overly hopeful. I do this too myself all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>I recall you leaving the thread with your tail between your legs after you got BTFO consistently. It was pretty funny, but of course no one expects you to admit it.</br>  <br> Not episode 18 </br>  <br>The entire basis for every anime ever would be different.<br><br>Instead of a beta male becoming the main charicture in every anime ever it would be an alpha female.</br></br></br>  <br>It's called sleeping on an Eastern US time schedule. <br><br>Maybe you'll find an interview where Anno calls me lazy or something, butt hurt storyboard-chan.<br><br>Anyway here's your last reply until you actually talk about the topic of the thread because I'm only slightly cancerous unlike your full-fledged, terminal, tumors the size of Giant Rei, pure, unrepentant fucking cancer that you are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Touji a Reifag?<br><br><br> implying I'm even the guy from last night <br>Everyone fucking saw it, man. You can't hide it.<br>You're doing exactly what I called you out on, running away and trying to bullshit your way out of the conversation. Again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but hatesex with Asuka would be better.</br>  <br>Didn't he fuck her in some EoE deleted scene?</br>  <br>It was like shinji thought up a world where he wasn't alive and Touji and Asuka were together.</br>  <br>Yeah. Rei will get dick from no one but Gendo and other ugly old men.</br>  <br>Shinji and Asuka aren't that different, are they? He even acts a little like her the moment he gets a bit of self esteem and a backbone, though that only lasts half an episode before Leliel eats him.</br>  <br>They're two sides of the same coin, suffering with the same problem but choosing to deal with it in two different ways.</br>  <br>Touji is a hikarifag. He's egging Shinji on in this scene.</br>  <br> The point of the entire show would be moot. </br>  <br> Touji is a hikarifag <br>He's literally indifferent to Hikari the entire series. She's such a beta cuck even Fuyutsuki is in awe.</br></br>  <br> Toji <br> Hikarifag <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  what if the rebuilds were done by someone other then Anno?  <br>why is the first reply always the best</br>  <br><br>Hikari is awkward as fuck</br></br>  <br><br>Well aside from Hikari, which is implied as like an actual possible pairing. He's an obvious misatofag.</br></br>  <br>Nice hatred towards Rei there Asukafag. <br><br>Jesus, Asuka is the one into old man dick, not Rei.</br></br></br>  <br>This is technically true, the best kind of true.</br>  <br> Asuka is the one into old man dick, not Rei. <br>?</br></br>  <br>She wins the Shinji in some shit video game<br><br><br>She is cute as fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're into something else now</br>  <br> She wins the Shinji in some shit video game <br>No she doesn't. The game ends with Shinji regaining his memories and apologizing to Hikari for kissing her, and the world goes back to normal.</br></br>  <br>Rei is the only heterosexual in the entire franchise.</br>  <br>Well, he got farther with her than Toji ever did.<br><br>Still, holy shit that sounds terrible, why the fuck did an amnesiac Shinji sudden get the hots for the blandest female in the franchise</br></br></br>  <br>Funny joke</br>  <br>Not Rei.</br>  <br>Well no shit, since Touji couldn't give less than two shits about her. He was all about Rei and Misato, but since Anno hates him he forced him with Asuka in the EoE dream world.<br> Shinji sudden get the hots for the blandest female in the franchise <br>The game came out around when episode 13 aired to be fair. A lot of shit about it is inconsistent with the show.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be a shitty shoujo</br>  Why does Misato get so little love?  <br>In the series, Asuka begs Kaji to fuck her, even starts undressing.</br>  <br>Don't worry, Toji gets  a loli  Rei in  Anima <br><br>The game sounds fucking weird. It's first impression, right? The only Eva games I've played have been those GoS VN and I'm trying to emulate NGE2 but it emulates like ass and it's all in moonrunes so I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. All I know is that I made best girl Maya blush</br></br></br>  <br> mfw no doujins where Asuka and Mari teach Rei about degeneracy </br>  <br>Because people like to be cucked by a cunt or autistic dolls</br>  <br>Where?</br>  <br>Kaji isn't an old man though.</br>  <br>Gunbuster wasn't a shoujo</br>  <br>In Anima the loli Rei loves Kaworu like she does in Puchi Eva. For some reason this is a thing because of that one scene in Death and Rebuild.</br>  <br> The purest form of love <br> degeneracy <br><br>But yes, I'd pay good money to see that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it's Kaworu, of course his cock is getting sucked by everyone.</br>  <br>Yes, degeneracy</br>  <br>Why are they perfect for each other?</br>  <br><br> degeneracy </br></br>  <br>is that candy corn?</br>    <br>wut<br>no it isn't retard</br></br>  <br>Yes it is you pleb. Rei and Kaworu are technically siblings, they even have the same parents: the FAR.</br>  <br>No, it's rat poop</br>  <br> implying Asuka is alpha </br>  <br>In ep 22 on the aicraft carrier.</br>  <br>You're a moron. By your logic all Lilith-based life is incest anyway.</br>  <br> You're a moron <br>Nigga, it's fact. Why else do you think Rei and Kaworu look so fucking similar?<br> all Lilith-based life is incest anyway <br>It is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei's body is mostly based on Yui's.</br>  why did they use children to pilot the eva's again?  <br>it's supposed to be because children wouldn't have had enough horrible experiences that they'd have trouble syncing with the Evas. but obviously that doesn't end up being true.</br>  <br>Because the Evangelions have a human soul inside them, and typically the only compatible pilots are the child of that soul.<br><br>Rei and Unit-00 are a special case.</br></br></br>  <br>She was created by the same thing(s) Kaworu was, that makes them brother and sister.</br>  <br>That goes for all of the others as well, since the souls are from them to begin with.<br><br>Fuck off with your retardation.</br></br></br>  <br><br>thank you anons</br></br>  <br> making up shit </br>  <br> Nigga, it's fact. Why else do you think Rei and Kaworu look so fucking similar? <br>They don't look similar besides red eyes.</br></br>  How to fix Evangelion:<br><br>Remove Mari.<br>Remove Kaworu.<br>Remove Rei Q and any other clone.<br><br>Cut out the retarded pandering shit for Asuka.<br>Stop shitting on characters like Rei just because the writers doesn't like it getting popular.<br><br>Write the rest of the characters seriously, with the intent to make each and one of them good on an individual level.<br><br>Cut out the looping crap. No piggybacking on previous successes or shitty attempts to change it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You what? Lilin and Angels are their children respectively, sure it'd be varying degrees of incest as well; but how the fuck does that invalidate the fact that Kaworu and Rei are siblings?</br>  <br><br> How to fix the Rebuilds <br><br>Eva itself is nearly perfect, don't lump it in with those abominations.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're the only ones with red eyes and the albino-ish white skin for a reason. No other character in the series has such unnatural hair colors and eyes.</br>  <br> hurr de durr <br>Rebuild is Evangelion, as much as you or I might hate it. <br><br>But yeah I'm not referring to the original when I wrote that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The idea that they are siblings is 100% fanwank.<br><br>Nowhere ever is it stated they are siblings, or even implied.</br></br></br>  <br>Rebuild was always intended to be a sequel, they need the looping to explain how that's possible.</br>  <br>rebuild isnt canon</br>  <br><br> Michael Bay's shitshow is Transformers, as much as you or I might hate it. <br><br>Taking something and completely warping it into something new and terrible while still slapping the original name on it doesn't mean it has to be considered to be the same entity as the original.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The idea that they are siblings is 100% fanwank. <br>You're fucking retarded. Adam and Lilith are both made by the FAR, they're the same type of existence; they're siblings. Get the fuck over it. Rei even says he's the same as her twice in the show.</br></br>  <br>It isn't, you're just the type of faggot who laughs at le epigg caps and lots of replies.</br>  <br>They don't need looping, and Rebuild shouldn't be a sequel.<br><br><br>Now you're being autistic, I don't even disagree. Not going to bother replying any more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They fit easier, and the main reason is the souls bonded to the Eva. Shinji got Eva 1 because his mom was the soul of it, for example.</br>  <br> Rebuild shouldn't be a sequel. <br>But it is. Therefore looping is needed and wanted.</br></br>  <br> waah wahh fanwank <br><br>Kill yourself. I wish I could meet you in real life so I could punch the shit out of your face.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm delusional and choose to ignore things I don't like! <br>Thanks for confirming. <br> I wish I could meet you in real life so I could punch the shit out of your face. <br>You can't even get your fatass off your couch, nigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Barking up the wrong tree, I get out, go to work, normie as fuck, and it's no coincidence the ONLY place I meet dipshits like you are here.<br><br>Fucking nobody, and I'm telling you NOBODY spreads shit like you in real life because they know they'll get it, and in real life they don't have an anonymous entity to protect them either.<br><br>Take your fawank, shove it up your ass, and get the fuck out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>except adam and lilith are based on different "seeds" you faggot. it's like having different DNA therefore not blood related.<br><br>take your incestfag shit elsewhere and get lost.</br></br></br>  <br>You are a fucking retarded piece of shit who barely even deserves to live. You are so obviously, clearly wrong in this instance and you still have the nerve to actually pretend you aren't full of shit.<br><br>Let me explain: there is nothing in the series whatsoever that validates your claim what-so-fucking-ever.<br><br>If Kaworu says "you're the same as me", it does not mean they are fucking siblings. Do you even know what a sibling is?<br><br>Have you ever seen some part about them being born of the same parent, growing up or whatever at all in the series or EoE? Anything?<br><br>When Shinji tells Asuka "you're the same as me", does that mean Shinji is Asuka's long lost brother?<br><br>I want you to take at least five minutes to reflect on how fucking retarded you are, and how much better the world would be without you living it. <br><br><br><br>Rebuild is a broken turd. That post explains how to fix it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lying on the internet <br>How more pathetic can you get?<br><br><br>No shit, both seeds being created by the FAR; which were originally beings who possessed both seeds. <br> it's like having different DNA therefore not blood related <br>They're fucking aliens, you can't use that argument here.<br>Kaworu says they're the same in episode 24, Shinji says they're the same in episode 24, Rei says they're the same in episode 25. Classified information confirms they are akin to siblings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br> all this fanwank <br>top kek</br></br>  <br> samefagging <br>Wow.<br> Have you ever seen some part about them being born of the same parent <br>Classified Information confirms it.<br> If Kaworu says "you're the same as me", it does not mean they are fucking siblings <br>He's literally referring to them being the same type of existence, unlike <br> Shinji tells Asuka "you're the same as me" <br>Where he's talking about their personalities and insecurities.<br>I think you may be autistic. Just because you don't like it doesn't suddenly make it invalid. It's the truth and the fanbase has collectively agreed on it. You're just a delusional, irrelevant minority that absolutely no one gives a shit about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   thread already long since devolved into lame puns, shippershit and internet tough guying <br>Same as it ever was.</br>  <br>Classified information says no such thing. The rest you said was retarded dumb fanwank that even contradicts the show.</br>  <br>You shouldn't call my ebin sci-fi incest plot fanwank, anon-kun. That's not very nice.</br>    <br>That's not five minutes, you can't even get that right.<br><br>Again, no part of the series confirms or evidences any of the bullshit you just said.<br><br>Noone except you thinks this shit, the fandom collectively agreed you're a huge faggot that these eva threads would be better without. It's absolutely true.<br><br>The only one with autism here is you, since you can't separate a pet theory (one that's debunked) from actual facts and reality. You think that because you like it, it's invalid.<br><br>It's invalid because the series doesn't support it. There is no mention of either being the other's sibling, or anything that would otherwise imply it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Classified information says no such thing. <br>Yes it does. The FAR created Adam and Lilith. This makes them siblings. <br> that even contradicts the show <br>No nigger, it actually supports the events from the show and Rei's own words. Provides a lot more context to Rei and Kaworu's forbidden union in EoE.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes it does. The FAR created Adam and Lilith. This makes them siblings.  <br><br>The FAR is a race. They are not one entity. Moreover, it doesn't make them siblings just because one entity (which they aren't) created them.<br><br>Nice try though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They would have fucked </br>  <br> filename <br>Fanfiction writer please leave.</br></br>  <br> Noone except you thinks this shit <br>Actually the Japanese and Western fanbases majorly regard Rei and Kaworu as being akin to siblings. Just check Evageeks, they take it as common knowledge.<br> It's invalid because the series doesn't support it.  <br>The series confirms it, and it's directly implied based on their conversation and union in EoE.<br><br><br>If they come from the same entity, they're as much as siblings as an alien race is gonna get. Explains why they look so similar.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The FAR is a whole collective of beings, they are also used in plural, the "First Ancestral Race".<br><br>Now if we, the humans created two new beings, which we do every fucking day, they're not siblings. I'm not your sibling. Any other anon here isn't your sibling.<br><br>You need a common parent and you need to be raised together. <br><br>In NGE, there is no mention of them being siblings.<br>In EoE, there is no mention of them being siblings.<br>In NGE2, there is no mention of them being siblings.<br><br>The classified information you refer to is not supporting you in any way either.<br><br>Take your fanwank somewhere else please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I look forward to the next movie.  <br> If they come from the same entity, they're as much as siblings as an alien race is gonna get. Explains why they look so similar. <br><br>Yeah, I like how they have the same hair color or facial features. Woops.<br><br>They don't come from the same enity because the FAR is not an entity. It's a whole fucking race. <br><br>They are a humanoid species that live as a race:<br> The humanoid species, referred to as the First Ancestral Race, <br>as explained by the shit you think backs you up.<br><br>There is nothing here that would make them siblings. Since the FAR also created the souls each "seed" carries, that would make everyone siblings forever.<br><br>Your logic is retarded, your idea is retarded, and you're pathetic for thinking anyone except your own little deluded mind buys it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Uh oh. Don't mention Evageeks when storyboard-chan is around. He'll use copypasta from their website to tell you why you're a faggot for using them.</br></br>  <br>Actually the Japanese and Western fanbases don't regard Rei and Kaworu as being akin to siblings. Just check Evageeks, they take it as common knowledge.<br><br> The series confirms it, and it's directly implied based on their conversation and union in EoE. <br>The series doesn't confirm it because there doesn't exist a single reference tot hem as siblings, and their conversation in EoE does not touch the subject whatsoever.<br><br>Seriously, you've shown no proof.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thread is a what if scenario <br> Fanfiction </br></br>  <br> using the opinions of Evageeks as proof <br><br>You know, are you trolling us right now? How fucked up do you need to be to sink as low as you have?<br><br>Face it, your theory is unsupported, it's shit, doesn't make sense, doesn't add anything to the series, and would even make it a lot worse since it'd make everything even more contrived.<br><br>Do you have some sort of fetish for siblings or something? Why can't you just accept the fact that you're wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this the same retarded idiot that ruined the evangelion thread yesterday once he got obsessed to prove that Shinji hates Rei or something?  <br> Any other anon here isn't your sibling. <br>Actually that's wrong. We're all related in some manner if we trace back our ancestors.<br> You need a common parent and you need to be raised together.  <br>That's a pretty retarded definition of sibling you have there, the way they are raised has nothing to do with it. It's about genetics solely. Furthermore, to alien beings who don't have shit like genetics and blood-relation, this is the closet we are gonna get: akin to siblings.<br> The classified information you refer to is not supporting you in any way either. <br>Yes, it does. EoE refers them joining as a forbidden union, they are similar in appearance, and regard each other as the same type of lifeform.<br><br><br> It's a whole fucking race.  <br>And yet they're only capable of making two different types of seeds that all act in the same manner since the Dead Sea Scrolls are so reliable. <br> that would make everyone siblings forever. <br>And?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what if scenario <br> not fanfiction </br></br>   This thread   <br>Why's that? Would Asuka be more forward about her feelings if she was the MC?</br>  <br> Seriously, you've shown no proof. <br>Yes I have, you just keep ignoring it. Why would the union between Adam and Lilith be considered 'forbidden'? Why did Sadamoto bother to make them look so similar?<br><br><br> I don't like it, so it must be wrong! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We're all related in some manner if we trace back our ancestors. <br>Might as well bust out some Determinism.</br></br>  <br>what is he doing with his left hand?</br>  <br>No because it worked out in his fanfiction.</br>  <br> And yet they're only capable of making two different types of seeds that all act in the same manner since the Dead Sea Scrolls are so reliable.  <br><br>It says there's multiple seeds out there, and even if it didn't, you would be fucking retarded to assume they're the only ones given the scenario.<br><br> And? <br>Because we obviously aren't, neither are they.<br><br>real talk: are you diagnosed with some sort of autism, aspergers or any sort of disorder?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know exactly what he's doing</br>  <br> Actually that's wrong. We're all related in some manner if we trace back our ancestors. <br>That settles it. You don't even know what a sibling is.<br><br>We're done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey ARK, can you put on your trip and derail this thread, I need it to hit 404 faster.</br>  <br>Kind of how like Shinji became less suicidal and learn to like and love others. Asuka would learn she doesn't to put up a front with everyone and they're relationship would have developed more.</br>  <br>What's there to derail? It started shit and it's still shit.</br>  <br>If you've understood this thread is a what if scenario, then why would he have to leave it? <br>Please go away.</br></br>  <br>No kidding, I'm just hoping some retard starts barking at your trip again because this doesn't look like it's going to 404 anytime soon. It'd be better than shipshit anyhow.</br>  <br>Being a sibling means having a common parent, the familial definition includes being raised together. You're siblings then. <br><br>But you know what, it's obvious you're some sort of shit-tier kaworufag or something who doesn't even know left from right. <br><br>I'm not your fucking sibling, nor are you mine, just because we're both human.<br><br>Again there's just nothing here backing you up whatsoever, so keep your shitty fantasy theory to yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>does he have a hospital fetish or something?</br>  <br> It says there's multiple seeds out there <br>All either possessing fruit of knowledge or fruit of life. There's no variety. They all act the same according to their fruit as the Dead Sea Scrolls state. All the seeds are siblings in this manner.<br><br> Because we obviously aren't, neither are they. <br>In Eva, the lilin are all siblings in some manner; they're made by the same mother. Just like the angels are all siblings in that manner. In the real world, we're all related; tracing back to our ancestors from the beginning of the human race makes us siblings by definition.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> let me spew my shitty fanfiction on /a/ without consequence <br>You're the one that needs to leave.</br></br>  <br> Rei <br> The Bandages <br>  Episode 01 <br><br>This explains so much</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All humans can trace their family tree back to a surprisingly small group of common ancestors. Every person on Earth's most recent common ancestor might have died less than 2000 years ago. <br>We're all technically related.</br></br>  <br>I wasnt even the anon in  you idiot.<br>You're just stupid and wrong.</br></br>  <br>Well, I was going to watch anime, but I guess I could just turn it into an Asuka thread. Turning shit threads into Asuka image dumps is a thing I tend to do, after all.<br><br>Any objections?</br></br></br>  <br>No use arguing with him. He's pure, deluded cancer.</br>  <br> you're just stupid and wrong <br> as he posts a non/a/ image </br></br>  <br> All either possessing fruit of knowledge or fruit of life. There's no variety. <br>You just described a variety you fucking moron.<br><br> All the seeds are siblings in this manner. <br>In what manner, existing? None of they are siblings, nor are they ever described as such.<br><br> In Eva, the lilin are all siblings in some manner; they're made by the same mother. <br>No, they aren't. Siblings is reserved for the same generation from the same parent. They are not siblings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why isn't anyone answering OP's topic? It's a pretty interesting concept and discussion.  <br> MEIN FRAULEIN <br><br>I'll join you</br></br></br>  <br> inb4 some anon shitposts about Shinji meaning absolutely nothing to Asuka </br>  <br>Subtle samefag there.</br>  <br>Which has nothing to do with being a sibling or not.<br><br>Take a hint leave retard. Even ARK sperging out is better than your shit.<br><br>Try /cm/, it's where the scum gathers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not, nobody gives a shit about Asuka beyond masturbation material. She has zero potential as a protagonist.</br>  <br>Go right ahead. Getting real tired of all the shit threads lately. I mean, most threads are shit, but the last two have been cancer down to the marrow.</br>  <br>I wish for autistic idiots like him to just stop polluting threads, is all.<br><br>My god you're retarded, was that your best retort? Just refrain from spreading anymore of your autism. Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Alright, here you go. Trip stays on because fuck it.<br><br>Any outfit requests?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if you don't like or agree with them as a romantic pairing, the only people who don't think they care about eachother are the most butthurt of the Kaworu-fags.</br>    <br> You just described a variety you fucking moron. <br>Not much of a variety if all the fruits of life are exactly alike and all the fruit of knowledge are exactly alike.<br> None of they are siblings, nor are they ever described as such. <br>They are created by the same entities as a means of said entities trying to preserve their race. They are essentially the remnants of the FAR.<br> Siblings is reserved for the same generation from the same parent. <br>And Lilith is their parent. She's able to rebirth them with no problem in EoE.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's go with the plugsuit to start us off then.</br>  <br>cAsualsuka is best Asuka</br>  <br>Do you normally choke and defile people you care about, anon-kun?</br>  <br>How would /a/ be different if Asuka had been Moot?</br>    It would be the same story, just with less Shinji, so it would be better. <br><br>Wait, does this mean Asuka would schlick to a comatose Shinji?</br></br>  <br> Not much of a variety if all the fruits of life are exactly alike and all the fruit of knowledge are exactly alike. <br><br>You have one of each, which doesn't give you grounds to say that. Also, good job evading the "no variety" bullshit you tried to spew.<br><br> They are created by the same entities as a means of said entities trying to preserve their race. They are essentially the remnants of the FAR. <br>Nothing of this implies siblings or sibling status. <br><br> And Lilith is their parent. She's able to rebirth them with no problem in EoE. <br>Each have their own mothers and fathers, Asuka has hers, Shinji has his, and the only sibling example we have is Toji and his sister.<br><br>Don't you ever, ever get tired of being wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Getting real tired of all the shit threads lately. I mean, most threads are shit, but the last two have been cancer down to the marrow. <br><br>Blame the Kaworufags. They're so insecure they can't stand the idea of Shinji liking anyone in addition to their husbando. They insist on shitposting in every NGE thread to "prove" something everyone already knows, and when canon material isn't enough the start ranting about unused material and spinoffs because they want Shinji to exclusively lust after Kaworu.</br></br></br>  <br>We'll start there then<br><br><br>Casual later. Any request on colors of outfits?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes.<br><br>You don't behead them though.</br></br></br>  <br>You didn't answer the question.<br><br>Do you have autism, aspergers or something?<br><br><br>Fucking this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Man, Captcha sure is being a bitch.  <br>Asking the right questions</br>  <br>The whole point of a hedgehog's dilemma is that we hurt the people we care about the most, through our imperfections as human beings.</br>    <br>You switch to Legacy yet?</br>  <br>This, plus one really bad Asukafag that decides to drop by some times despite being banned and hated in more threads than just the Eva threads, the waifu threads for instance can't stand his guts.</br>    <br><br> You have one of each, which doesn't give you grounds to say that.  <br>The Dead Sea Scrolls treats them as the exact same thing. Kaworu even meets another seed in NGE2 and it looks exactly like him.<br> Nothing of this implies siblings or sibling status.  <br>It's the closest to siblings as aliens can get. They're objectively related.<br> Each have their own mothers and fathers <br>They're all under the category of Lilin, just one measly angel. <br>Also, thanks for never answering this:<br> Why would the union between Adam and Lilith be considered 'forbidden'?

I want to draw something that has impact/emotion and leaves the viewer thinking on it, but it's hard coming up with a concept that hits those standards. And Asuka's character design in particular isn't exactly easy to work with.</br>  <br>Of the guro I have saved  which likely doesn't even fit the proper definition of guro most people have but that's an argument for another thread  the main appeal is from those that recreate scenes from the show. The mindfuck, the Harpy scene, things that could happen in Instrumentality, etc.<br><br>I have one image that's pretty neat where it's essentially the scene where the Harpies spear Eva 02 as she's reaching towards the sky, but it flips things around so that it's humanoid Harpies stabbing at Asuka, but instead of guts and shit coming out, it's robot stuff like wires, coils, and bolts, because it's a flip and the robot is now inside. Technically, there's not any actual gore in the image.<br><br>Just have to think outside the box. Also realize people will hate you if you draw Asuka gore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> trying to convince others to draw guro <br>Just fuck off and watch anime already, you've served your purpose.</br></br>  <br>Saw that coming.</br>  <br>Alright, I'll keep that in mind.

How long have I been gone?</br></br>  <br>It won't be that, luckily, since Whis is female in U6.<br><br>It'll hopefully be a unique and interesting universe and not one of the stock "alternate universes" I keep seeing in Western media where "good guys are bad and bad guys are good!" or "genderbent!" or "everyone is rockabilly" or whatever the fuck.</br></br></br>  For those who do not know how to get the RoF sub working download the somewhat decent beaner camrip of RoF here:<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>03835&amp;showcomments=d52545e2#c491998<wbr><br><br>http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx for the subs<br><br>Get VLC Media Player if you don't already have it.

Found it easier to use VLC. /v/, everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>DBMU is terrible. So much Bra wank</br>  <br> Not using windows media player </br>  <br>Well, Goku actually got worse. He still "developed" though. <br><br><br><br>Future Trunks maybe, but how did any of those other fags change?</br></br></br></br></br>   alternate Gohan who always trained is canonically the strongest fighter   <br>And the dog.</br>  <br> using a glorified '99 program. <br><br>Good luck getting the .srt files to work.</br></br></br>  <br> not using RealPlayer <br> mfw I unironically used RealPlayer for MP3s until 2012 when I switched to VLC which I still use and the only files I ever use in MPC are .mkv </br></br>  Universe 6 is just an excuse not to go past the final part of the DBZ timeline and into GT territory. Toriyama has said he wants nothing to do with the older versions of the characters because they are "boring." The problem is that shoveling all this shit makes the final episodes of DBZ seem like they should not exist. I have no hope that he will try to tie them together either. For example, I doubt we will see young uub, or Pan's birth.  <br> not liking strong female characters </br>  <br>Bra is a fucking slut, just like her mom.</br>  <br> I've written a strange new story <br>By that I assume he means the same story he's told like thirty times now except in a different package?</br></br>  <br>The final episode of Super might deal with both of those.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, this time there's a NEW, EVEN STRONGER opponent. That's never happened before in Dragon Ball.</br>  <br>Bra is a classy lady.<br><br>Shut your whore mouth</br></br></br>  Universe 6 should be a universe where the Saiyans and Namekians never visited Earth. <br><br> Krillin becomes the new Turtle Hermit <br> Videl is his disciple, wielding the Z Sword <br> Yamcha is a battle-hardened cyborg, who married Bulma and had Trunks <br> Chichi has inherited her father's kingdom and is just as ferocious as her personality suggests <br> Tien has travelled around the world to grow stronger, and is dating a gunslinging Launch <br> Together they are at war with the Red Ribbon Army, a country-wide armada with a legion of androids built by Dr. Gero <br><br>Yes, Dragonball Multiverse did it, but it could be done better. Either that or the Super Namekian.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a universe without super saiyans <br>yeah not happening, Toei wouldn't be able to sell shit.</br></br>  who /goten/ here?  <br>That sounds really awful.</br>  <br>Z dicklover mexican detected</br>  <br> implying that Tien would be a good guy and not the assassin that the Crane Hermit wanted him to be </br>  <br>Goku and Vegeta go to the universe, so now it does have Saiyans. Checkmate.</br>  <br>needs the sleeves and two. all hes done so far is drive a tractor off a cliff and couldn't beat a snake with eyebrows. not sure why people are all /goten/-ing up the place.</br>   That midriff   <br> Jaco <br>can't wait to see him in Super. really...the only thing I'm hyped to in this show.</br></br>   Dragon Ball's artstyle will forever be shit     <br>It's not the artstyle, it's Toei. They're cheap and shitty.<br><br>Some of the Z episodes with competent directors actually looked really good. But now it's all computer-drawn animation where they cut every corner possible.<br> 3D Beerus and Goku fight in BoG </br></br></br></br>    <br> it's Toei. They're cheap and shitty <br>Yes, which is precisely why the plastic, awkwardly shaded, off model art style is so garbage.</br></br>  <br>Bulma must have used the Dragon Balls to get younger.</br>  <br>The manga's art is timeless</br>  <br>Well BoG was pretty different from Dragon Ball fare. You had a focus on comedy merging with action instead of leaning too much in one direction, you had a villain who wasn't really much of a villain at all and then you have the protagonist losing at the end and realizing there is a level that he wouldn't be able to reach on his own.<br><br>Especially that last bit, that never happens in Dragon Ball against a main antagonist, the idea of Goku actually losing. So when he says strange new story, I'm pretty sure things in Universe 6 will be weird</br></br></br>  <br>I'd argue the first episode of Super looked way more consistent than, like, One Piece on its normal day or Precure</br>  <br>Where did you find such a high quality scan? its super rare to find them.</br>  <br>Yeah she looks alot better in RoF than in BoG.<br>Would fap to.</br></br>  <br>Bakabt</br>   universe 6 gohan keeps on training <br> achieved what goku has achieved in less time <br> is the ssjgod of his universe <br><br>GOOD LUCK GOKU AND VEGETA</br></br></br></br>   genderbent whore goku <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br> One Piece on its normal day <br>no shit, they need to lure DBZ fans in so that they don't get a bad first impression. it'll go to shit after a few arcs or so.<br>One Piece before computer animation also wasn't that terrible.</br></br></br>  Dr. Slump v01-18 (2005-2009) (AnHeroGold-Empire)<br>https://userscloud.com/dvg7uyoj8386<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/un815oserexf<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/34h8pzfjlymz<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/y4woe6y0gbav<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/0o1jimxxq924<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/bmgtmhwlqr07<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/dan6x94vvr7x<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/ln0sr2osmvq0<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/amgq8gscdpsc<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/2f9yfoe8cb9i<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/kdz24z6de1u9<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/adqa551zksnu<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/mpcvlli8mrz8<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/n2dhkn259gqg<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/6g5c6nym7my5<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/647xpxrcjxio<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/zcc9kvttit5s<wbr><br>https://userscloud.com/f3nrloywjep6<wbr></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  Is Dr. Slump any good?  <br> Implying he doesn't have SSJ2 God form </br>  <br>love it! <br>more!</br></br>  <br> Toei <br> Toriyama <br> remembering anything SSJ 2 related <br>its dead jim ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>simplistic animes are the most epic fucking pleb</br></br>  <br>I always thought it would be nice if Goten had a moment where he unlocked SS2. <br><br>I always thought he and Trunks could only go into SS3 when they were Gotenks and separately could only become regular SS</br></br></br>  <br>It's even better in color, I hope Viz continues to do release these.</br>  <br> FUCK YEAH CANON GT <br>Being this delusional</br></br>  <br> Toei <br> caring about GT <br> Even wanting to use GT <br> Thinking Toriyama would even give a shit about GT </br></br></br></br>  First episode was too filler-y. Second episode looks like it's going to be filler-y, too, but also quite funny. I'm still hopeful this will turn into a rollercoaster of fun when an actual threat shows up. Some more Goten/Trunks adventure would be great, just make it about something other than "get Videl a wedding gift". Also, needs more tits.  <br><br>These episodes are written assuming the viewer doesn't know who the characters are. It's going to be fillery until the end of the third episode.</br></br>  <br> These episodes are written assuming the viewer doesn't know who the characters are <br> the viewer doesn't know who the characters are <br> doesn't know Dragon ball characters <br> airs right after the end of kai </br></br></br></br>  <br>It is still written in a way that newcomers can understand it, just as they did for Battle of Gods.</br>  <br> animes <br> epic <br> pleb <br> implying Super can't be simplistic and more than just a Multiverse ripoff </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you saying I'm wrong? Are you trying to pretend that we're not going to have three episodes of character introductions.</br></br>  <br>so, does this mean we could get future Trunks  best Trunks  again?</br>  <br><br>Well, episode 1 of Dragonball, Dragonball Z and even Dragonball GT at least had a call for adventure that set the stage for the first arc! It wasn't that great of a first episode, but like I said, once an actual threat shows up, it might get pretty enjoyable.</br></br>  <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>I laughed when I first saw that on Kanzenshuu, and animation males it even better. <br>Disliking animation is one thing, but that snob taking it, editing it, calling it "corrected and better" when it looks atrocious that way, is just stupid.</br></br>  <br>The "corrected" version looks like shit. <br><br><br>I love Jaco. So glad he is a character in Super. I feel as if the added characters are making Dragon Ball more perfect.</br></br></br></br>  <br> looks more on model <br> "atrocious" <br><br>How is it up there on Toei's dick, anon?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> brown hair <br><br>What the fuck are you DOING?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Uhh didn't goku just go to king kai's planet? Didn't Beers just blow up half a planet?<br><br>I get the feeling you're intentionally ignoring things so you have something to complain about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, brown hair's dumb. Not the point.</br>  <br> looks "on model" <br>Haha. Sure. Keep telling yourself that.<br>Also, keep hopping on AjayLikesGaming and similar snobs' dicks.<br> <br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If they're going to be so pretentious, they should at least get the character right</br>  <br><br><br>Wasn't vegeta's hair originally brown?</br></br></br>  What's the difference between different universes and different timelines?  <br> not knowing that Vegeta's hair is commonly depicted as brown, especially in the anime <br><br><br>You're going to sit there and tell bold faced fucking lies about how Battle of Gods Vegeta looks more like pic related than the edit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>All saiyans have black hair. Toei originally colored his hair brown without consulting Toriyama, so we ended up with that snafu.<br><br>It's been corrected in Kai, Super and the movies.</br></br></br>  Why the fuck did I read it until the end... god, it started out interesting, like a tamer Berserk, but then it went to shit with the Awakened Ones.
