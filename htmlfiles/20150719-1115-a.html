Thanks for TL.<br><br>Also, OPM 102 never.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the chapter<br><br>If Mogami aided Team Reigen, the manga would end faster but it's nice he seems to be gone now.</br></br></br>  I love Mogami. It would be a shame if this is the last we see of him. I hope this is leading to Mob beating the shit out of Claw's leader with his strict no nonsense ESP.  <br><br>Mob is probably the best example of a pure of heart character in a manga.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Anybody care to remind me who this dude is? I'm guessing its that one time Mob excorcised a girl and had to live in a fictional world for years and years? Mogami is the best esper that ever existed or something? I just can't remember how the fuck he was defeated. Also, was really hoping Mogami would've killed that fucker, ONE could've really pushed those battle shonen boundaries this time and see how Mob reacted to it all, to realize the world ain't as pretty as he hopes it is. Anyways, hope he appears again.</br></br></br></br>  Why is there no Rokka no Yuusha thread? Does /a/ not like this anime?  <br>If we went by that logic, then SAO is a good anime. Sure, is about masturbating over a power fantasy, being the best and drowning in chicks. Sure there will not be anything noteworthy, nothing to be gained, but it looks good...............<br><br>Please, no. Is more pollution to the already polluted industry. Is mass produced generic work, is okay as long as you do not pretend it to be anything more.</br></br></br>  <br>Can anyone tell me if this is going to be split cour?<br><br>There are TWO openings and THREE endings announced. <br>I mean I'm not a genius but three endings unless you're going for split cour is kinda excessive isn't it? <br><br>Even more considering Passione is not a rich studio and i'm sure they can't aford to spend that much on useless shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem with SAO isn't that it didn't invent anything new or that it was generic, it's that the plot is terrible, the pacing makes no sense, and the characters are retarded.</br>  <br>Shirayukihime is really a basic self-insert Shojo like the other anon said. <br>I mean I read 20 chapters of the manga and it's just... Not what /a/ said it was. There's nothing new in it, the MCs are boring and as generic as possible, there's no comedy or if there is it's just terrible. <br>You could finish it in 1 volume and nothing of value would be lost. <br><br> inb4 ... </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Goldof <br> Beta <br>What? Goldof is manly as fuck.</br></br></br>  Because no one else made a new thread.<br><br>For anyone who hasn't heard; Exterminate is out.</br></br>  that poor biker gang...they never stood a chance.  <br> she was willing to protect her friends but Gungnir wouldn't let her. <br>It's time to stop anon. We want to love her and say she can do no wrong, but when you happen upon an insane man killer monster while your friends are there and your first response is "I don't want to fight you!" instead of "I'm going to protect these people no matter what." Then you fucked up.</br></br>    <br>So she's a 2hu? I wonder where she got her alchemic powers.<br><br><br>10/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear definitely has problems creating convincing villains. She doesn't need to be fought, she needs to be adopted.</br>  Which is your favorite big-breasted character?  <br>They're never going to just fuck are they? she could at least do anything other then penetration at this point with as much as a tease as she is. I know she's offered and he's pussied out but still.</br>  <br>Is this one of those images that gets you killed?</br>  <br>I was wondering when Pochacofags would show up.</br>  this anime thread got really into the e  <br>Sauce?</br></blockquote>]
