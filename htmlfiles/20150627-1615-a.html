[ ayy dubs   Looking for these?       may not be dubs but nice 69s   THESE are dubs      Is this allowed?  ITT: pairings that absolutely no one wanted    Everyone tried to get me to watch this show in high school. I have no idea how anyone could tolerate the two main characters.   You first, OP.    The very definition of the childhood friend/worst girl wins. She's even tsundere.    I was watching the comfy anime when I decided to read the manga.  How I cringed so hard when I read the ending.       If you separated it into two different series, I would have enjoyed a father/daughter romance because I'm a deviant, however I was quite enjoying guy-raising-kid until the timeskip, and ultimately wasn't especially happy with anything after that.   I thought the possibility of incest was the only reason anyone followed that series.    We came for the imouto moe, and when there was none of that we stayed for the Kuroneko.    The problem was how it was handled. The series went from a very realistic, if idealized depiction of a man having to learn to be a father. It was very straightforward in that regard. Then, ten years later, their relationship boils down to, "It turns out we're not blood-related, so we can totally bone even though it's never crossed my mind before!" If the series was actually ABOUT a little girl developing romantic feelings for her adopted father, it would have been different. It's like the author tricked everyone into indulging her fetish.    Maybe in volume 1. But then literally every other girl was better       Nigga you are crazy. Yukimura is the best.    I loved the anime but I wasn't expecting this pairing, similar to OPs both characters acted like father and daughter through out the series until Sensei came out and admitted that he loved her in the last three episodes.   Manga isn't real, just ignore it.   I can't be the only person that changed the channel whenever they were on-screen together.   Oh, this is an easy one.   All these years later and I still don't understand it.    A lot of people wanted those pairings.     Kirinofags are not people     It's almost like something's missing from this thread.   Every time I see her face I want to kill.  I tell myself that she is just a cartoon character and there is no logical reason to be so upset, but it doesn't help.      Wrong        yeah sure I bet you where rooting for ms. psycopath childhoodfriend or agressive model bitch. or maybe loli cat evil. kirini is the only pure girl in the series. accept it     mfw      ms. psycopath childhoodfriend  The hero we didn't deserve, but needed. Manami did nothing wrong.     Kuroneko was the only realistic option    Manami is literally a psychopath. Nobody can say something like this with that kind of tone of voice and expression and not be fucked up in the head and a right cunt as well. Rarely do you see characters as vile as her in anime, even the supposedly "evil" guys are usually far more noble. at least she kicked off the incest route, but goddamn is she hateable.  Back in S1, she was a bit plain compared to the others but still a nice and homely girl, some people just want a normal relaxed life with a cute girl you know. Now she's just pure evil.  She is also obsessed about the concept of being normal, every single thing she does is for the sake of being normal, if she makes some meal she will not be happy until she does a "normal" meal, she says herself she can only do the normal thing in every aspect, she will do it again until it tastes normal, she hates everything above normal as much she hates things below her messed up normal standard, she is also the reason Kyosuke ended up with Kirino, is common for little girls to be very attached with their relatives to the point of saying they want to marry them in the future while they are unaware of the full meaning of the marriage, because Manami, brother and sister turned out detached from each other to the point Kyosuke perceived Kirino as a stranger, also made Kirino tramatized person, traumatized with her complex making her unable to forget childish play, then when they got close again Manami got a healthy male living close with a model level beauty as the best romantic option, and made the childish brother complex of Kirino grow into full blown romantic love, I am pretty sure to say Manami is a psycho who messed things up for herself due her obsession.   Pushing other girls onto kyousuke to keep him from spending time with kirino with full intentions to break their hearts later anyways.   she is evil I tell you            Senseless pairings? Here's your king and queen of that bullshit.   How the fuck did Relena end up being a much more likable character than Heero, anyway?     Nobody can say something like this with that kind of tone of voice and expression and not be fucked up in the head and a right cunt as well.  Saying the truth like that is what heroes do.   Pushing other girls onto kyousuke to keep him from spending time with kirino with full intentions to break their hearts later anyways.  Yeah, doing everything to prevent someone from ruining their life. Sounds like a hero to me.        Heero felt too static. He did change but not as noticeably as Relena.    She was never likeable, that was just you buying into her psychopathy.    yet her actions are all for selfish purposes    Doing good for selfish reasons is totally something only a psychopath would do.    Do you think she collects the hands of her victims?    Better that then Yamucha   Just a reminder that Kyousuke and Kirino would be normal siblings if Manami hadn't stirred shit around.   I remember watching this for the 2nd time and being really fed up with all the POLITICS and Relena sipping coffee.     implying  Kuroshit fags still butthurt.  God I loved those threads right after the last LN released.         Here to prove this post bad and wrong.    Are you really this autistic about some girl you don't like?    Funny how the manga got a whole lot better after that stupid bitch more or less disappeared from it.    Why  Why must you bring all these feelings back  what a goddamn rage-inducing series that was        You'll understand when you are older.    yeah god i just finished rewatching this in the past two weeks and it's still infuriating    RIP Four    truth   Aiko and Utena   Why?  I know I read it, and the end was non-loli. But I don't remember exactly how.       To be fair the entire teen part of the manga is crap, not just the ending. I just pretend that it' some kinda of alternate reality story.      no one  Yeah, because there totally wasn't a big Kirino fanbase in Japan, right? Fucking tripfag.        I hate you so fucking much.     So he fucked his own daughter?   Crest of Friendship my ass.   Best girl    They weren't even blood related.    I liked it.    But she still was his adopted kid. And she was, like, 6.    Yukimura 4evar    Oh god... thanks for reminding me about that. All that rage, it's all coming back to me...    Also she was his aunt. Biologically speaking.       I wanted it        He waited until she graduate from high school.   There was no blood relation at all; his grandfather turned out not to be her father.       She was not his blood aunt    They were great for each other though. It would have been so shit if Goku ended up with her.    She actually started hitting on him, when she was 16 or so and even then they waited until she graduated from school. It's not that ghastly people like to make believe.     No.    top kek    Are you talking about Miyako x Ken and Yamato x Sora, right?     Ah, guess I just remembered it wrong. It has been a while since I read it and I don't think I've ever finished it.     He should have made an honest woman out of Nana.     There was no blood relation at all; his grandfather turned out not to be her father.  well, that's really fucking convenient.     /a/ are hypocrites as Rin fulfills most criterias for the perfect w/a/ifu    I don't think anyone actually wanted any girl to get with Kodak. They were just self inserting.     implying they are not perfect for each other     Wait a minute I thought that by choosing sensei she was essentially choosing nobody? I thought that he was just gonna watch over her while she paints for the rest of her life or some shit. I didn't realize that they were gonna be in a sexual relationship or something, I need to rewatch this I think I may have missed something.      Blame the dubs, not the series for that misunderstanding.    Yeah shes not choosing him as a boyfriend. She's choosing nobody, but he's in love with her anyway.    Such a bullshit way to go about it. It was almost a business proposition. All that wading through pseudo-deep josei pottery narrative for nothing.     those legs  fucking QUALITY     But he was like 80 when he adopted her. Even ignoring that it's still creepy as fuck.    Not really bro. Aki a cute. CUTE!    this but the kuroneko was a thing so fuck that bitch    That anime was fucking awful. I only kept going at the manga because of lewd and pretty good art.     She literally has nothing that would interest him and he is incapable of being an asshole.    Wing would be my least favorite Gundam if not for based Duo and Treize.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127214053  Is she the shitposting mascot or something?    No, but i've used this same image three times today to shitpost, so you're probably just seeing me.  Literally   all me :^)        No, that's Salama.    Poor Yamcha never scored.    Angry, amazing sex.    More like 30. She comes after her mother for lusting after crinkled dicks.     Is this a joke? how did he/she win?     implying they ever were      But in the end the real best girl won so it's fine.   that's rage worthy? wow. you need to read more genre.    you wanted Daikichi's D instead, huh?     Speak for yourself, I have a fetish for loli chimeras.     Fuck off back to tumblr, faggot      Better than having her end up with Kouki or that other guy. Daikichi was the only decent person in the manga, so it was only natural for him to end up with her.    Underrated post.    his head is way too big here    Whether or not she choose him does not matter what pissed me off is that he was all about being her father through the series until suddenly he is in love with her like everyone else, it felt off and forced.  Fair enough if he showed signs here and there but in the last three episodes it suddenly became a thing, the other two guys suddenly always knew about it and the viewer wasn't sure until sensei shouted it out a window for all the world to hear..  Great anime, good ending besides that sensei crap.       mfw I was fine with that pairing    Lucy should have won dammit.     These are perfect.      Ruri  Still mad bro?     Get the fuck out.   Would you watch an animr where a METRICK ASSFUCKYON off lolis have a tea party. However each tea cup is secretly a biogenetic mecha alien and when they begin to drink their tea. The lolis fuse with the biotech tea cups and become gigantic mecha. And I'm not talking some faggot Mobile Suit shiy I'm talking LOLIS BIGGET THAN GURREN LAGANN. okay now for the good part. The lolis can only power up and use attacks by farting. The difference in fart determines the type of attack. like a little pomf is just a simple punch whereas a long wet shitty fart is a big magma canon and when the lolis learn how to queef somewhere around episode 745 (this would be a very long show) they begin to level up and get so bug they transcend dimensions  The name would be Ultimate Biogenetic Fartbots in Infinite Universes re too Cute as they Obliterate Eachother with Dank Stenches!       oh cool this website has a board for anime i can make friends by typing at them lol yay     Female Kokkuri with Tanuki    Blame shitty writing durring Adventure and 02 that didn't bother developing the relationships between any of the characters. None of them barely interacted at all and are suppose to be these bffs for life. Yamato gad more relationship development with Taichi than Sora. He honestly help her out of a slump once and that's about it. As for Kenyako, it's only a pairing because Miyako wanted to fuck Ken badly when they were 12 and 11. Other than that, nothing.     It not hard to forget, since it was a last minute asspull by the author.    I agree with this one so hard.    Fa is one of the very few non infuriating tomino girls, whachu talking bout man     The mother was a complete bitch that just fucked him to make the pedo jealous and then tried to take his daughter away from him, then he fucks best girl but she left without telling him and is shown at the end with another ilegitimate child from him. But overall is a happy ending, he keeps his daughter and is implied he's going to meet the new one       It's not weird that she was sexually attracted to Dakichi. The problem is Daikichi. agreed to marry her. How was he able to abandon the parental love that he had for her and turn it into romantic love. That is the shit that kills me.      It's hard to be convinced that she's the 'bad guy' when she's the only character who had the most realistic reaction to their relationship.   For the love of god, i hope this doesn't last   Nobody is selfless. Nobody is.    fucken lol    Fuck you, I hope they last. Fuck Rui too.   Also, anyone complaining about sensei is young as fuck and can't appreciate a flawed female love interest       Oh you cheeky cunt you     Sensei is just in there to stall for the inevitable Rui ending.  I fucking hope. All the girls suck, but Rui basically sucks the least. Plus she's cute   Seriously, this series sucks. Why do i care so much about the ending         this. entirely this. ones a static fuccboi and the other one is a psychopathic bitch.     I think even the author realized she wasn't gonna be able to develop that in a satisfactory way and that's why she made a time skip after Daikichi asks Rin todo give him some time to think about her feelings      Agreed. She should have ended up with  Rei .       Saiyans love a good fight, whether it be physical or mental.     Expecting good romance out of Japan   Romance isn't even a working thing in real life.    Keita and his teacher in Kiss X Sis     <br/>    I actually didnt mind the ending really, it wasnt as bad as people think it is It could have been done a bit better (alot) but the pairing didnt even upset me slightly     They're not lasting, you stupid cunt.        Motherfucker that was the OTP.    I wanted that pairing.   Fuck Shana.   Is this the manga about the guy who faps a lot?   No one relevant wanted this pairing  Moot and the Jews   <br/>   Is Dragon Ball Z Revival of F is good or is another shit like other DBZ movies?  It's just Namek Arc abridged/reboot.   are the subs out yet?   It's better than most DBZ movies. It's not shit, but it's not great. It's fun tho.    They launch it on Mexico first.  I'm mexican so I nees our opinions because I don't know if is worth.     When is this movie supposed to come out in the US?   So is only to have a good time?    August 4, 2015.  On Mexico we have it first. Viva México cabrones.      I liked it better than Battle of Gods tbh fam.     Well, that makes me go to the movie theater and watch DBZ.     Goddamnit.  When I was like 8 playing YMCA soccer, the kid whose family lived in Mexico got to see all the new DBZ episodes before I did.  It never ends. Fuck you, beaner.        dumb beaner     tbh fam  go get a job you societal parasite      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pkl<wbr>8OEO0STQ</wbr>  [ ]    It's a good movie if you're not a Piccolo or Gohan fan.   spend your entire life training after the Frieza saga when you were able to do ok   lose so much power that you get BTFO by Zarbon Jr.       Out of all of the nigger insults you go with "get a job" on /a/ of all places    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WiO<wbr>NylGn8Xw</wbr>  [ ] It's pretty hype.

Lost   http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/06/2<wbr>6/new-fuji-tv-dragon-ball-super-web<wbr>site-posts-30-second-preview/  Its looking more and more like BoG is being completely rewritten.  </wbr></wbr>  Its good for just enjoying some good ol dbz action, but the plot is absolutely retarded.   I think it starts off with it being before BoG, then it timeskips    Maybe, but the part before BoG is already a bit different.    Well, there can be an explanation for it, but yeah, the manga already is retconning shit unless Beerus didn't IMMEDIATELY go to king kai's after waking up.    Chapter 1 takes place before Goku and Friends Returns, which is only 2 years after Buu and not 5, so that cant be right either since that would break the 39 years everyone in the movie talks about.    Oh shit is Toriyama going to rewrite all of the Toei stuff from Battle of Gods? Things are already better than I expected.    From the trailer, it sounds a lot like Beerus and Champa show up at the same time.    I hope Toriyama retcons Bulmas aging so she never becomes an old hag like she was at the end of Dragonball. Her mother is eternal young, why cant she be too?     Who knows    sen-  oh      it's the worse shit since GT.   OP Thread.  Luffy looks like monster point Chopper here.  Whats gonna happen to Dooffy?    The Tontatta are going to collectively devour his body by the individual strings, like a mountain-sized feast of spaghetti   Viola and rebecca are going to blue ball him to death    Lol. I like this. Poetic.   Sleep for a week, eat lots of meat and be fine right after.   Implying we aren't finally going to see what duvel is up to   HE'S HERE   Force fed another DF by Kaidou, then explode!    What kind of Animal Beast needed to be hit by a King Kong Gun for it to be killed?      lol   Back to Reddit please.       Doffy will be murdered by Burgess and we'll see some other faggot with his horribly OP fruit    kek?      kek   Back to 4chan please.       What happened to Burgess? I recall reading in other threads that he ran away. Did that actually happen?   If Luffy's dick is rubber, can he auto-erotic asphyxiate himself with his own penis? It would be the ultimate sensual pleasure.   Omg how about taking 10 seconds to skim through the last couple chapters     I believe that Pandaman has been stalking the straw hats from the beginning. What are the odds that he would travel the exact same path as them through Paradise and the New World and do it at the same pace as them?  Pandaman is going to follow them to Raftel and get to the One Piece first, he will be the final villain.       But who is he specifically following hmmmm     cucked by sabo    a couple of things could happen next chapter  1. everyone leaves for green bit and lives there while he gets fucked by kaido  2. burgess steals his fruit in the aftermath leaving him dead or defenseless             all that build up   all that hype   Luffy beats him in like 6 punches total   Doffy does fuck all the entire fight   Jesus fucking Christ this entire arc was fucking dogshit, literally only thing worth a shit was Sabo and Bartolomeo.         I have never read One Piece in my life     No anon, there's no defence. This arc was literally a poor man's Alabasta, with a shittier villain and shittier fight. With shittier characters.  Rebecca was even more cancerous than Vivi.      omg     Let me guess, back to reddit?   Top kek        6 punches total  Luffy only landed 6 punches in 20 minutes of G4? Kaido's gonna rape that ass.     Shieeet, meant this post     This arc is easily the best arc since sabody, the fights werent just the same 'my crew beats your crew' a bunch of random people fought the executives and won, usopp unlocked haki, Robin was shown to have amazing speed by babying hakuba, sabo and koala are just fine and working under dragon, doffy is a world noble and thinks his child hood was hell, laws flashback of Cora, Franky had the most manly battle in any manga series, Leo and the tontattas literally saved everyone's ass by stopping jora from reviving the defeated executives, fujitora is the smoker of the new world, king rikus flash back, rebecca-kyros flash back, gear 4, big mam, kaido, black beard.  But no you're either gonna cry about it being too much or not enough you narutotards are the worst.       fujitora is the smoker of the new world   Fuck, I can't believe I just noticed this now.  Smoker fought Ace to stalemate like Fuji vs Sabo   Smoker didn't do jack shit about Crocodile, still got the credit   Smoker never once trusted Shichibukai pirates, Fuji wants to disband the system   Smoker called the WG shit, Fujitora said they weren't God.           Also Vivi didn't have her entire country executed and be forced to fight/sexual favors Vivi would have literally killed her self if she went through half of what Rebecca did   So how is Jinbe going to die before he joins the Strawhats?  Luffy has now defeated 3 Shichibukai, 4 if you count Buggy. He will soon have a former Shichibukai join his crew. Why doesn't the WG offer him the position of Shichibukai?    Summary of this chapter:   people talking about how the fight is over   We're getting into Bleach levels of content-density          Why doesn't the WG offer him the position of Shichibukai  He was responsible for the destruction of Enis Lobby Responsible for the worst and (discounting Shiki) only prison break Impel Down has ever suffered Major player in the Whitebeard War Slugged a Tenryubito in the face and got away scott-free Son of Dragon, the most wanted man in the world  At this point too many people in the World Government want him dead. Either that or Garp would hear and laugh at them for even considering the idea.            Shichibukai  Aren't they like the group that the goverment can use and thus normally don't pick the strongest but the ones with aspirations to submit to the goverment? Luffy would never be controlled.     One Bleach   anyone else feel doflamingo should have won that fight/would've beat luffy if he wasn't so arrogant as to take that punch head on? he could have dodged it and then easily destroyed luffy  Soon.   meh   imo, Fujitora was easily one of the worst aspects of this arc   They're picked for their reputation mostly but someone who has displayed open contempt for the government as often as Luffy has wouldn't be considered.  They receive benefits to aid their strength and influence when needed. Nobody in the government actually trusts them and indeed the only time the government ever said "Do what we want or you're not a Shichibukai anymore" was the Whitebeard War  They're really all about appearances which is why Buggy is a Shichibukai now        he's cool, it just seems like bullshit to have an admiral show up and then "PRESUMABLY" let the Strawhats off the hook when his explicit mission is to capture them, and they've already have a million close calls    I liked him initially but goddamn he basically did nothing as the citizens of an entire country were being slaughtered around him.   He easily stripped Law of his title and Doflaming's knowledge of Mariejois' treasure couldn't have been enough to prevent him from attacking Doffy when his life was in danger from the birdcage too.      He's too unpredictable.   5$ sayas Doffy gets up madder than ever with the crazy eyes finally revealed BUT since the shonen protag already defeated him he goes down easy when the CP Aegis show up to chain him up now that he's weakened.  Then Fuji tells them to haul him away and later on as he's getting transported to Impel Down he gets "rescued" by Kaido and last we see him a giant shadow is looming over him and Doffy is scared.  Then we don't see him until much later.        he could have dodged it  He was barely keeping himself up and just because the attack was large, doesn't mean it wasn't fast. That and the range was enormous.  If that isn't enough to convince you, then I don't see why Lucci couldnt have dodged jet gatling and Crocodile not turn into sand and avoid storm.        The seventh shichibukai is responsible for Zephyr losing his family and arm.     Aokiji, Garp and Smoker (3 times) have all let Luffy off the hook when they could have captured him. I don't see why Fuji should be treated differently. We already have at least one batshit crazy admiral and a batshit crazy fleet admiral. We need the 'good guy marine' somewhere.    The point of the Shichibukai is to balance the three powers, not fuck with it.   Do you think there's a chance that Toei will get their shit together and give proper animation to the Law flashback and G4?    There's obviously a difference between "good" marines and "bad" marines and in the end the good marines will end up as the good guy police of the world while the bad ones will be defeated as arc villains.     Minimum logic goes into fights, Oda mostly draws stuff that looks cool.    The WG and Marines are pretty separate in that sense. Something like Zephyr can be sweeped under the rug, but enlisting the pirate that is known to have fucked up Marineford, Enies Lobby and Impel Down would not be as easily explained away.   Sure, Marines might not be happy about him, but to the public, Luffy would appear far worse.      Yes to both. Hoping they stretch out Law's flashback a bit to rake in that filler time. Extra scenes with the past Donquixote Family would be cool.     I think the main issue is that they don't have anything Luffy wants and Luffy has no reason to use that position to his advantage since he's all about reaching the goal, not lingering around establishing criminal empires or consolidating his power.  For the WG it would be a matter of public prestige to declare him a shichibukai since it would mean to the world that they reigned him in and he's now a known quantity and so on...      All I'm hoping for is that Kaido has a penguin zoan.  tbh I expected much more out of the boss fight in this arc.  After the initial couple of attacks Doflamingo couldn't to jack shit to Luffy and for Luffy it was all a matter of landing that big G4 hit and that's it.  Really underwhelming considering how interesting Doffy's fruit power is and how diverse his moveset is.  I was expecting something more choreographed with them exchanging blows more.        I think the last time Luffy got seriously injured was when Magellan kicked his ass.   Can't luffy change the punch's direction in gear 4th? You know, that snake thing.     meh   Reminder that Kaido is the only and best foseeable chance of bringing One Piece back to Enies Lobby levels of balanced hand-to-hand fighting again.       He was fucked up pretty bad in Marineford and almost got killed if Jinbei and Law didn't save his ass. Not to mention that Akainu would've ended him if Ace didn't jump in.      I'm fully expecting the Gorosei to go Lao G crazy mode at the very end and offer up a good physical battle.     Luffy didn't do anything until G4, even Red Hawk was called superficial. And then the power up completely reversed the situation.  It was pretty annoying. I don't like one-sided shit fests.   Hody bit him so hard Luffy was losing too much blood and needed a blood transfusion from Jinbei.         But Magellan took ten years from Luffy's life and was the main reason Luffy didn't reach ace at ID     Taking ten years from a shonen protagonist's life means precisely nothing.     Luffy would have been further away from Akainu if Ace hadn't gotten buttmad from Akainu's childish taunting   Honestly I can't want to see Drake X stomp shit in his full on dino mode.  Just imagine his awakened zoan mode too.   I like that Oda did that small introduction for him in Law/Cora's flashback.       It will when Luffy dies at the end     Yeah at the end of One Piece Luffy's going to go on a trip similar to Roger's final voyage where he visits all the places and people he's met on his journey before dying    I enjoyed this arc, especially the tournament, but the Doffy V. Luffy fight was a massive letdown.  Doffy pumping out new attacks every 3 panels was just completely unnecessary.    Time to rub it in to Doffyfags   DOFFYFAGS    B L O W N T H E F U C K O U T L O W N T H E F U C K O U T O W N T H E F U C K O U T W N T H E F U C K O U T N T HE F U C K O U T  T H E F U C K O U T H E F U C K O U T E F U C K O U T  F U C K O U T U C K O U T C K O U T K O U T  O U T U T T                         bump for doffyfags eternally and impossible to recover BTFO   speedreader please     &gt;Doffy does fuck all the entire fight   But that's completely wrong, they had at least 3 or 4 skirmishes with each other throughout the arc      Do you just skip whole chapters at a time when you read?    You mean like this?     and this?    Anyone else get the feeling that something REALLY big is about to happen in the next 2-3 chapters?   u mean my dick in ur mums ass?    enel comes back or kaido reveal     7 hits   Doflamingo confirmed shittier villain than Hody.     Would you merry a nepnep, go for dreamcast instead, or is your waifu xbone/ps4?  In before your taste is in Buran    But I already a Purple Heart.  Gaiden's almost over, will you avoid the spoilers this next week?  Naruto looks so based and grown up. I love it.    It was just another of Tobirama's mistakes.  Tobirama was the CNN of his time  Uchiha murder circles create child soldiers in Konoha   Is evil hereditary? Shocking report on Uchiha genetics   The militarization of police traced to Uchiha rebellion         Dadruto has been one of the best parts of the Gaiden. Looking forward to seeing more of him in the movie.      he's just gonna ignore Salad     People are trying to defend Boruto but won't even tell me why they think he's stronger. Like what can make him strong enough to beat a Uzumaki/Uchiha descendant. Boruto is just a plain Uzumaki just like Pain was.   Reminder that Super Strength is not genetic.  Reminder that the narrative theme of this Gaiden is that ideas/familial love trumps genetic heritage  Reminder that Sakura a shit        Because he is the one with genius and talent plus power.    Salad has her own father she can fistbump with.    They better give us some Hinata to make up with no appearance in the gaiden    Be careful what you wish for.    It wasn't just Tobirama's fault, when you're born in a world full of wars with an ability like the sharingan you know for sure what's going to be your fate.   threadly reaminder that Tobirama's nightmare isn't over yet   shieeeet where is all this coming from? I've been missing a lot of shit recently    Tell me how Sarada will counter Raiton+Rasengan (rasenkunai?).     Not all Uchihas and Uzumakis are uber tier like Nardo and Sauce are. We still have to see how Kishi  or someone else  will handle them, because in a series like Nurutu plot convenience is king.     Sarada is a Uzumaki and Uchiha. She has more growth potential than Bort.      Sarada is an Uchiha and an Haruno.   If Salad creates enough shadow clones through her daddy issues, could she awaken MS by massacring her self-images?   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qyo<wbr>nn5Vbg7s</wbr>  [ ] New trailer     She is a woman so whatever potential she could have had has been dwarfed.   fuck off    Boruto is basically Sasuke+Naruto   Sarada is mini-Sakura   People still arguing who's strongest       Uzumakis have a pretty good statistic, 4 out of 5 shown characters were good, only Karin was shit tier Uchiha... not so much     With a good hotdogging.    What a little shit, hope he gets fucked up also  not even 15 years old and already doing susanoo rasengan  Fucks sake      I want Sarada meet her (biological) mom in the last chapter    You want reasons?  1. Sarada's only talent so is Sakura's super bitch punch, an ability notoriously associated with mediocre fighters like Sakura, Shizune and Tsunade (who is arguably the weakest Hokage and sannin and probably lost more fights than she won). Because the author is obsessed with parallels and thinks it's a good thing to make the kids just mini versions of one of their parents with all the same abilities it seems like Sarada is being prepped to be a second Sakura, which isn't a good thing considering Sakura had literally no noteworthy abilities besides being able to punch the ground heal, making her one of the most ineffective fighters  2. There's still a good chance that Kishimoto will pull out of making Sarada an Uzumaki/Uchiha hybrid. One chapter is all he needs to explain away any of the evidence in the most haphazard way he can so Sakura/Sasuke's fangirls don't have to kill themselves. If this is the case, her potential is almost entirely destroyed.  3. While she does have the Sharingan, Sasuke only unlocked all his abilities by going through a dark and depressing period of his life. If Kishimoto is the type to spare Sarada from harm by saying "Nope. Sakura was her birth mommy all along, he will most definitely spare her from too much further stress needed to awaken further stages of the Sharingan.  4. She's a woman and woman normally get the short-end of the stick in this manga. Think about it. Was Karin any greater of a fighter than Sakura in spite of being an Uzumaki?              *Sarada is a Haruno and Uchiha  FTFY     I would commit suicide if Sasuke was my dad.    yeah, all the uchihas shown were some shit-tier irrelevant jobbers, like Sasuke, Itachi, Madara, Obito, Shisui etc.     Aren't there still like 6 or 7 chapters left?   mama Hinata why so sad :'(     Haruno  Literally who.     Isn't Karin fucking dead and buried somewhere?    where is the uncensored version where he is holding a gun in this shot?    Then you're fucking retarded  having a sharingan   genjutsuing hot chicks and drowning in pussy       Next week is the last chapter. Might have some extra pages.     your dad does not give one fuck   he enjoys you having so many friends   never asks why the girls follow you   he just understands         7 good named uchihas   the rest of the shown clan was mediocre at best from what is seen  That's still a bad statistic compared to 4/5     What is this expression trying to say, /a/?     What's the point of drowning in pussy with no dad to be proud of you?    That he finally found  Boruto's  spare.     coup d'etat incoming      I'll be back to fuck shit up some more soon.     shit that makes me sad, I actually like this spinoff a lot   Why are the new kids so /fa/?   Anon you don't know how statistics work  Having a sample size of 5 is not going to give you a strong undeniable conclusion. For all you know, those 5 Uzumakis were the only ones relevant to the plot because all the rest were trash      she's still alive in the different hideout    i just need him to interact with his daughter at least once  it's already ridiculous that he only has a photo of bolt on his desk      Why does he sound like luffy     tfw when Uchiha were never once at the top  Senju/Uzumaki all day.     Every Uchiha who managed to awaken the Sahringan became at least a jonin. Also we literally know 5 Uzumakis: -Nagato, talentless ninja blessed by Madara with the Rinnegan -Kushina, just an housewife -Karin, jobber -Mito, jobber -Naruto, blessed with the Kyuubi and Asura's tranasmigrant        Gaiden could run as long as Naruto. Why is kinshi being a fucking lazy sloth? Doesn't he want money?    Enhanced.      I'm holding my final judgement. One chapter is all Kishimoto needs to screw everything up.  At this point, Sarada could go from being a most interesting and dynamic character to complete trash depending on how Kishi chooses to resolve her character arc.        so /fa/   black and red everywhere   Kishi has to make it seem like there's been some sort of progression in the Ninja world I guess.       It was a joke. Of course you can't use 5 people to come to the conclusion that the Uzumaki were an uber clan  Though some people here seem to do just that       dat pose  what a slut      -Karin, jobber   Karin isn't a jobber cause she was never really a fighter to begin with.       Man that girl kicks ass.   She's pretty hot too.      Suigetsu was pretty based in this series.   you will never hang around Orochimaru's Totally-Not-A-Supervillain Base, running DNA tests for random children because you have nothing better to do with your time       Uchiha shits should never smile.    I can't believe I'm saying it but I don't really want it to end. I actually want to see more of this generation. Maybe a capable assistant can pick this up and make something out of it.    Itachi and Obito killed the entire clan. Most uchihas where shit tier     -Nagato, talentless ninja blessed by Madara with the Rinnegan  kek  -Kushina, just an housewife   -Mito, jobber  Both were able to control the Kyuubi, a being more or less made of hatred their whole life  Also, the whole Uchiha clan was massacred by two guys. Can't have been that great          Does he even know he has a daughter?   Do they have the same VA or something?         Madara has the cutest smile    I agree, I'm really hype about this new series and it's a shame if it doesn't continue in some form    We all know how this story goes.  She turns into mini-Suckera cunt who is tsundere for Boruto.      almost over  Wait what? Its ending so soon? Literally THE sequel to Naruto isn't even about his Son who only showed his face for like 3 panels its just about Sakura being a cuck and the Uchiha's being the worst fucking bloodline in history? What a fucking joke.       It's no shame to be slightly autistic   I bet Gaiden would go on if somehow Kishi finds a way for Madara to be able to create an offspring who carries his ideals.     If Sarada isn't Karin's, I don't think I'd want it to continue if Kishimoto is only going to create false conflicts.      I dont follow naruto and this sequel but  Gaiden's almost over  Did you mean the entire sequel or is this just a prologue to the sequel or something?      Sarada already hogged all of Naruto's father/daughter time    What is there to like about the gaiden? It's just a retarded soap opera. Maybe it would be better if it actually focused on the other kids instead of just Sarada.     Same. I'm actually kinda hype for the Boruto movie and Kishi delivering on his promise that it will be his best work in the Naruto franchise. Trailer looks fucking GOAT.     Sarada  Gotta work on the ideals part tho     Sarada has Sakura's exact same part 2 outfit only with Sasuke's edgy arm warmers.      The gaiden is only one volume/ten chapters  After this, there's just the Boruto Movie.  After the Boruto movie, it's anyone's guess what happens next. Maybe Kishi will take a twenty year break and come back to it like Toriyama.           Literally THE sequel to Naruto isn't even about his Son who only showed his face for like 3 panels its just about Sakura being a cuck and the Uchiha's being the worst fucking bloodline in history?   Literally THE sequel to Naruto  That's the Burrito movie coming out in August.      Itachi did it for the sake of the Konoha village, please respect him. He cares Konoha more than his clan. he's a true Shinobi.    The only reason Naruto is good with Sarada is because he has a daughter of his own. I bet he spoils Himawari like crazy.    The gaiden's purpose is to provide buildup for the Boruto movie which is the main attraction.     Himawari grows up to be Tsunade 2.0  oh boy     The gaiden was always meant to be a mini series who's purpose was to lead into the Boruto movie. Kishimoto decided that the mini series should have nothing to do with the thing it was supposed to lead into for whatever reason.    You realize that Boruto is facing Shikadai and not Sarada in the exam final right?  And do you remember that the final exam was composed of a tournament fight? Unless Boruto and Shikadai was the very last fight (and being the winner doesn't gurantee the ascension to Chuunin), nothing was supposed to be set in stone.  In any case, aliens interrumpted the exam.         It's just a retarded soap opera  Exactly.     and Kishi delivering on his promise that it will be his best work in the Naruto franchise  You and I know both know that could go either way.         Then why doesn't he go to his birthday party, have a picture of her on his desk or has acknowledged her existence?       In any case, aliens interrumpted the exam.  We'll never know how based Shikadai is?      Himawari grows up to be Tsunade 2.0   loud    drunk   emotional   compulsive gambler   massive tatas   finds some fine young girl to be her bitch            Yes, but at least if the DNA Test is legit and the whole issue around Karin isn't a misunderstanding, the actual plot doesn't feel like a waste of time and Sarada stands out as the most mature and developed character so far of the new generation. Horrible abilities can be forgiven if she's actually a good character.  Making her Cuckura's doesn't just give her bad combat potential, it also kind of ruins her whole character arc for this story.       because himawari is kishimoto's kryptonite    female    looks like hinata    daughter    sister          Bort probably kicked his ass with pic related, whatever it is.    sasuke searches for some huge threat for 12 years   ignores his "family" that entire time   he never finds the threat and they show up on their own to kill Naruto  Smart.      Watch as this scene turns out to be Dadruto's ghost.    It'd be pretty pointless to go on this whole journey only to end up where we were at the start. Kishi's not the best writer, but even I have trouble believing he'd set up, pursue, and then destroy a lesson in which his story hinged upon in no less than 10 chapters. It took a long time for the whole "hard work overcoming genius" shtick to fall apart.    How much are you betting that there are at least another 4 babby mommas among the villages?      why would you even save such a quality crop?    Shut up, anon. Dadruto is going to live.     Gee, Burrito! How come Kishi lets you have two dads?     Oh Jesus you might be right.     daughter   now that you mention, has there been any positive father/daughter relationships in naruto? other than naruto and sarada       implying Kishi would shoot his cashcow  As long as the dosh flows in, he will never kill his beloved protagonist      is that the fucking Chidori   and it's hurtling toward my son   fuck you Sasuke   fuck you   should have had your edgy ass executed while we still had the chance          implying he'll kill off the main character of one of the most beloved franchises in the entire world   If he does without any revive shit, then he'll have the biggest balls of any shonen mangaka I've ever seen.      No, he's just this movie's "kidnapped princess"  Sasuke, Boruto and the kages head on a mission to rescue his ass.      haku and zabuza    still no byakugan on burrido   himawari when?   Kishi you fucking twat         I can't write anything greater than this   cause I killed the main character        Kishi said he thinks of Nurudu's family as his own, so I doubt he'd ever kill him off.  Then again Kishi says a lot of things that turn out to not be true.      Hashirama and Tsuna, somewhat   Friendly reminder that there's still one more chapter to go and pic related is still a thing.     Why would Boruto have the byakugan? Neither Naruto nor Sasuke have it    This is why it's weird for Kishi to make Salad a girl. Why didn't he just give Sauce a son?    What do you mean? Sauce has his Burrito.     the right eye will have sharingan. The left eye will have Byakugan! (laughing)   (laughing)   &gt;&gt;(LAUGHING)   KISHI YOU CHEEKY CUNT        He wants the Uchiha name gone    Sakura fighting with Sai in shippuden was pretty based. Too bad after that arc everybody turned into wizards with unlimited mana and magic tricks     Kishi really wants to make Bort the official SN kid   but he has to give Sauce a child or else people will bitch   I know I'll make it a girl    I'll even say she wants to be Hokage as a joke  And that is how Salad was born.        He wishes Bolt was his son.     yfw he starts having Itachi flashbacks while hanging out with Burrito       He seems motivated.     "Boruto... have you ever gone boar hunting before?"      I'll even say she wants to be Hokage as a joke   there was this jump festa (2010 I think?) where somebody asked Kishi if Sakura could be Hokage and his answer was "no way"       4.  yeah but there are plenty of women who are powerful in their own right.  Temari's a Jonin and gave Shikamaru a run for his money during the exams. Plus, she got promoted earlier than he did.       Not any of significance.  No important female friendships either.      It'd be pretty pointless to go on this whole journey only to end up where we were at the start.   The funny thing is, I could see the people who defend this saying that because Sarada now wants to be Hokage, whereas she didn't even see the point of being a ninja before, that that is enough character growth, but then if that was the only amount of character growth Sarada was going to experience, why not write a simpler story? Why use an overly-complicated plot centered around a certain character only for them to make a moderate change that could have happened in a simpler manner?   If all you wanted was for her to decide she wants to be Hokage or find meaning in being a ninja, you could have avoided all this drama around her mother which has nothing to do with that decision.   Kishi's not the best writer, but even I have trouble believing he'd set up, pursue, and then destroy a lesson in which his story hinged upon in no less than 10 chapters.   Again, the Kishimoto Internet Defense Force would probably say that the lesson isn't destroyed, but even if it isn't "destroyed" it would remain seriously undermined by the narrative. When Sarada found out that Sakura wasn't her "real mother" and had been lied to her whole life, she was ready to disown both of her parents until Naruto told her that it doesn't matter and what matters is what she feels. Even if it doesn't matter to Sarada because she remains happy either way, it matters to the readers because the readers are being preached to and aren't given an example to as to the validity of Kishimoto's philosophy. It's too easy for someone who thinks that Sarada's relationship with Sakura doesn't go beyond genes to just write everything off.  It would also leave open a question as to how much Sarada really learned because she isn't compelled to learn anything from what Naruto said in order to have her old life back.               implying 'Dai doesn't just dodge all the chidori hits, guide Burrito into the shade and then use the circular shape of the arena to haxmode his shadow possession.   He'll then give up the fight because his chakra's too low to continue.  Then the big shit happens immediately after.  Calling it here.           No important female friendships either  There was Sakura and Ino but the Pink bitch threw it all away because they both crushed on the same edgy piece of cardboard. Even though Ino still considers the flower she gave Sakura her favorite possession.   I'll never understand why people like her.        but then if that was the only amount of character growth Sarada was going to experience, why not write a simpler story? Why use an overly-complicated plot centered around a certain character only for them to make a moderate change that could have happened in a simpler manner?  This.      tfw I got promoted to Chuunin while your edgy genin ass cried like a bitch in the clinic     Kishi has a really fucked up portrayal of human relations.     but then if that was the only amount of character growth Sarada was going to experience, why not write a simpler story?   pretty much  you could even keep the daddy issues by having sasuke be an absent father who only comes home one or two times a year         Implying that's not how some humans act.  Just look at the actual Sakurafags.       ino's favourite thing is the flower she gave to sakura   pinkshit is truly the worst         This. If Kishi wanted Salad to learn a lesson about what it means to be a ninja, then he should have just focused on Sauce from the start. Why the fuck would Sakura even be a part of this if she was always Salad's biological mother?   Of course to the SScucks this doesn't matter because they think the Gaiden is some love letter to their asinine ship. Speaking of which, thanks to the Gaiden, SS is ruined beyond repair regardless of whether or not Salad is a cuckbabby.          remember that move Kakashi taught me and and told me never to use unless I intend to kill someone   and that the only reason he taught me said move was because I was fighting a literal psychopathic monster who got his rocks off by killing people   how about I teach you that so you can use it on your good friend Shikadai         Does she even have any redeeming traits?   I want to believe in Orochi Experiment end    So Sasuke is in the village   Got another assignment   So soon, what is it this time?   You know, secret ninja stuff        She raised a future hokage by herself    Unfortunately Sarada ambitions will end up like Kushinas.     she learns she's a cuckbabby and that her father is a deadbeat manwhore   she learns that she's Pink Shit's kid and her entire quest was not only pointless but she's basically destined to be a jobber bitch like her   she learns that she's some kind of horrible abomination created by a pedophile snake tranny in his creepy basement   she decides that she doesn't want to know her real origin and her entire journey and trauma was pointless   in every end she ends up the weakest link of Bort's squad  Every end for Salad is a bad end.         They look so fluffy and well cared for.     you could even keep the daddy issues by having sasuke be an absent father who only comes home one or two times a year   If the only goals Kishi was going for was Sarada to want to be Hokage and to admire Naruto, there are plenty of ways to do this without involving any question about Sarada's real mother. Maybe Sarada already looked up to Naruto a lot, given that her own dad wasn't around and then finally gets to see him in action. Maybe she meets Sasuke and just finds him cold and impersonal towards her while Naruto is friendly. Maybe in addition to these, Sarada confides in Naruto her doubts about being a ninja meaning anything and he gives her a pep-talk that really motivates her. You don't need a soap opera to do this and if really wanted drama, having Sarada just hate her dad for never being there is more than enough, you don't need to make her think she's his side chick's child let alone drag it out for this long just to make it not mean anything.  At this point, if you went back on making Karin the real mother, you reduce the entire plot of Sarada trying to find the "truth" to just a convenient set of circumstances that motivated Sarada to finally put some effort in trying to meet her dad whom she's never known because had she not discovered the picture, she would have never followed Naruto, and you also put the character through trials for no other reason than to watch them suffer for nothing. While it is true misunderstandings do happen in real life, they don't really make for an entertaining read as much as scandal and tragedy. That's why people still watch Maury.         she actually becomes the Hokage this time but only because the other guy wasn't interested   she inspires confidence in her village by giving Burrito head under the desk while he sits in the chair   every Gokage meeting is punctuated by him popping in with Hiraishin for a quickie       Only in one of those she doesn't gain extra tomoes   That poster though   ino and her dad, i think    Please no. I actually like Naruto as a grown man     &gt;she actually becomes the Hokage this time but only because the other guy wasn't interested  It's the same with tsunade. She only got the job because Jiraiya said no.     There's a Kishimoto internet defense force?     only relevant characters shown   subtle spoilers for who will face who in the Chuunin Exams   shows off the main villain and what he can do  I always liked the hand-drawn posters the most. Kishi's not the best artist, but it shows he's invested in the story he's about to tell, regardless of whether it's good or bad.          She only got the job because Jiraiya said no  Unless Bort miraculously wants to be the Hokage by the end of the movie, which he better fucking not. He has no reason to want the position. Let Salad have it. It'll be the only significant accomplishment of her life.     Anyone know what it says? Also I like the whole carpentry theme we've got going on for Bort's posters and shit.    Boruto wearing Sauce's scratched headband and Naruto's Part 1 outfit in the climax(?) of the film   OKAY WE GET IT FUCK      If Kishi wanted Salad to learn a lesson about what it means to be a ninja, then he should have just focused on Sauce from the start.   I'm a little confused as well as to what Sasuke's purpose here is. Is the point for Sarada to realize how honorable her dad is and how much he cares for Sarada and Sakura? Or is it for her to realize that her dad's a straight deadbeat? Or is it for her to realize that while her dad isn't so bad, she has no emotional connection to him at all?  Cause the way it seems, Sarada in the end is going to end up liking Sasuke. In which case, I'd have to wonder what the point is of her admiration for Naruto.  Her admiration of Naruto makes a lot of sense if she sees him as a father figure to substitute for her rather mediocre dad. And it would also make sense if she saw that Naruto is insanely more powerful and skilled than her dad. But so far, Naruto hasn't done anything spectacular and if Sarada ultimately forgives Sasuke and recognizes that he's a good dad in spite of his absence, I have to wonder why Sarada would look up to Naruto more than Sasuke. Heck, even if Sakura is the mom, you could try to make up for it by applying that lesson to Sasuke whom Sarada has no relationship with, but that doesn't seem to be the direction they're going with this. It looks more and more like Sarada is going to end up recognizing that Naruto was right about how cool Sasuke is by the end.    hypothetically speaking.               tfw Sasuke teaching Bolt the Chidori which kills Shikidai causes Shikamaru to go dark and become the greatest, most maniacally efficient villain in the Narutoverse      Unless Bort miraculously wants to be the Hokage by the end of the movie   I'm gonna become the Hokage 'ttebasa!   just kidding       Wait, who's the girl above Chouji's kid and next to Shikadai?    Salad still thinks spending time with her papa is shannaro (whatever the fuck that means), yet at the same time she expresses her butthurt at seeing Sauce spend so much time with Bort instead of her.    That's Inojin. Also, that's a dude    What if he becomes in Jiraiya 2.0, kabuki shit and all    NO NO  YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POTTERY IT'S PERFECT THEY RHYME  DON'T YOU SEE HOW THEY RHYME   That said it's actually pretty appropriate for him to be wearing those two articles of clothing. Still cheesy as fuck though.             I want to fuck that girl      implying he wouldn't take the lazy route and just ask Temari to make another one     That is Inojin, and he is the prettiest girl.    Why is she so perfect    Well, he did say he wanted his first born to be a girl.    I get what it's for, I'm saying the POTTERY is kind of ridiculous.  I think we would get the message if he just did his Chidorasengan but this is hammering it in there       not having a #YeaSorry      he becomes the new Jiraya   Himawari becomes the new Tsunade     Salad  becomes the new Orochimaru      Hiden already establishing him dropping the lazy persona and becoming "the adult".  I guess serving as the Chancellor for three different Hokages and assassinating an s-rank criminal while Naruto slurps down ramen and fucks Hinata does that to a guy.  He's morphing into quite the edgelord in the novels.        Himawari is voiced by Saori Hayami   OH WHAT THE FUCK?  Now I'm super mad she won't get much screentime       He will chase after mitsuki's ass running all across the all that dimensions. Another Jiraiya Orochimaru route, then Salad will be the next Hokage.   I fucking hope so.      I bet the headband is going to be a reminder for Bort not to be a shit to his dad and respect what he went through to get where he was. Like spending three years of his life saving Sauce's edgy ass, dying twice, and losing an arm in the process.     I want to feel that feel.   although realisticly it leads to Bolt dying in pain at the hands of Temari   Wow... it would shatter them. Thoroughly. Their thing was being the slightly more sane and practical ones, putting up with a lot of shit, and they sank everything into making a family together. A decade later, one of the people of the kind they resolved to endure kills their son with an assassiantion jutsu during a rank exam because Daddy Doesn't Love Him Enough.          My daughter's has awoken the Sharingan!   My twelve years of Cigarette mission is worth it!   Now I only need to teach her how to kill this kid.        girl  Inojin is a trap.     Boruto dies, Himawari becomes a drunk virgin riddled with gambling debts and Sarada gets the happiest ending?    The prettiest Yamanakan.   Who hype for Ninja Storm 4?    she learns that she's Pink Shit's kid and her entire quest was not only pointless but she's basically destined to be a jobber bitch like her   Learning that would be literally what she intended to find out,      What's the point of drowning in pussy if your dad is proud of you?    Himawari confirmed for Stoic character.     takes the backseat in the Gaiden   DiD in movie   Naruto's been reduced to a supporting char.       It'd also bring that Sasuke Retrieval Arc back full circle. Shikamaru nearly kills himself trying to protect his team AND rescue Sasuke, pulls out a fucking batman gambit only for this guy to return a decade later and teach his best friend's son an assassination Jutsu that kills his only child.  I wouldn't put it past Kishi. He's been pulling the rug out from Shikamaru's life on a pretty regular basis. This might be the crowning moment.      Except that in here, Sarada wants to be Hokage because of Naruto, not despite Boruto.    Too bad he still makes Inojin look like a corpse.  He looked actually alright in the anime character sheet and in the trailer       Sarada wants to be Hokage because of Naruto  Tsunade only took the job because of naruto in a way too.  I always felt like tsunade and naruto's relationship was a missed opportunity. Thought she could have been more motherlike to him, since that was set up so well.       Honestly, the only bad thing we know about him is his backstory (dismembering opponents in pitfighting and enjoying it). We never see him engage in anything really heinous. At least Jugo hulked out once. He even put head on the chopping block by standing between Taka and a Tailed Beast Bomb. AND TANKED THE HIT.       I'd hit it.     Karin has those chakra chains    It looks bretty gud. The games have always been the best way to experience Nurudu.     She was conceived by a Sai possessed by Ino's shintenshin technique.      I always felt like tsunade and naruto's relationship was a missed opportunity  Don't worry, anon. The doujins covered that. Thoroughly.     Does that mean Ino fucked herself?       it's already ridiculous that he only has a photo of bolt on his desk  What?     The only naruto doujin I ever liked was the one with shizune and nardo.      Kishi's coloring is the right one  ink gangbang m8     Does that mean Naruto is finished forever once Gaiden finishes?      equating guts with greatness  (Brazilian) (American) ? pick one      #Iamnotmadara     Yeah just like Dragonball finished 1995.    Studio Pierott will never get rid of Naruto. It's literally the only anime they have    It's one of the pictures you see in that multi-photo frame in The Last. The one with toddler Bort and his dad making the peace sign.    Nigga I can't see shit.    10/10   NC - NO CONCUSSION    It could all work out if the Gaiden ends with her being more of a tsundere towards Sasuke, but really, the only thing that seems to be holding her back from having a better opinion of Sasuke is the issue with Karin and Sakura.  Notice that she doesn't even call him "dad" in her mind during this scene now that she "knows" what he did. But given that immediately after she wondered what his relationship with Sakura really was to him we saw Sasuke show some concern for Sakura's well being, I wonder if Kishi won't just make the whole DNA/maternity issue a misunderstanding for no other reason than to save Sasuke's image.      How do you pronounce "seventh-sama"? nana-sama?   Probably something like nandaime-sama    nanadaime-sama    I thought the gaiden was supposed to be about fixing Sasuke's relationship with his daughter.  Instead it's taken a backseat in favor of Sarada's relationships with Naruto and Sakura. Sasuke is still just some stranger that they keep telling her how awesome he is.       , I wonder if Kishi won't just make the whole DNA/maternity issue a misunderstanding for no other reason than to save Sasuke's image.    Why would he do that when he could pull a Jotaro and call it a year. The difference is that Sasuke actually seems to give shits about Sakura.       Which explain this    Her relationship with him might be left strained after all.    Damn, it's not as catchy as its predecessors.           I don't know about kanji reading rules but Shichidaime-sama sounds cooler.     Her relationship with him might be left strained after all.   Does Kishi even plan on fixing it when the movie is shaping up to be all about Boruto having two daddies?      But Boruto is Sasuke and Naruto's son. They have no other children.    Maybe they actually have an ongoing bet on who can neglect his daughter the most.         I thought the gaiden was supposed to be about fixing Sasuke's relationship with his daughter.   Instead it's taken a backseat in favor of Sarada's relationships with Naruto and Sakura.    Right now, there's only two things that hold Sarada back from having a high opinion of Sasuke since he's already outshone Naruto:   his absence for 12 years   his apparent affair with Karin, resulting in her birth   Given the way things have been going, it feels like the creator wants Sarada to have the highest opinion of Sasuke possible under the circumstances, seeing as how he even went so far to nerf Naruto just to make Sasuke look badass and Chouchou can't stop "envying Sarada." If Kishi can excuse or remove one of these obstacles to Sarada admiring her father, I don't see why he wouldn't at this point. He might even make Sarada understand that the mission was so important that the village had to come first before her.     I don't watch Jojo, so maybe you could explain that to me.                   tfw it's this scene when it's shown  Goddammit Bort.         why does kishi and sp hate himawari so much? isn't she based on his daughter?       Doesn't hate her that much apparently since we'll see her in the movie.    Nips don't kiss their children or their parents.    She's just there so Naruto can have a bigger family.  It's clear that Sarada is Kishi's daughterfu.      No. 15 years from now they will have Naruto Kai and then they'll have constant Naruto movies until we get Naruto Super. The first new Naruto anime in 18 years.     It's clear that Sarada is Kishi's daughterfu   makes Bolt the child of POTTERY and gives Salad nothing but shit and suffering    daughterfu        kishimoto doesn't surprise me, he's shit at writing daughter/sisters and Himawari seems to exist to give Hinata something to do while Burrito becomes the sasunaru kid  SP doing this  to a mini Hinata is weird, though. Specially considering how popular she is with so little screentime.        his absence for 12 years   Muh missions, muh loyalty to Hokage who you love so much, etc. etc.   his apparent affair with Karin, resulting in her birth   You don't actually believe this, do you? Next chapter is the explanation for the wacky misunderstandings.          Could be worse. Sakura could be your mom    I'm not mad. It just means that other people will have to realize the potential that Kishi wasted.    So....shouldn't he have some kind of eye hax? He is Hinata's spawn after all...    Byakugan is for losers.     &gt;daughterfu     Considering how Boruto is ignored in the gaiden I'm not surprised Himawari hasn't showed up. I guess it should be a good think Himawari and Hinata aren't caught up in this soap opera shit. Even Naruto feels out of place in the gaiden.       She       gives Salad nothing but shit and suffering   Suffering it's actually the way Kishi shows which characters he cares about, he thrives off cheap drama. Look at Shikamaru, Kishi started to take a like to him and what did he do? He killed off his sensei and then his dad.  Don't think that Bort will escape it. His dad gets kidnapped by ayyliens, his last words to him are probably the "I rather have no father than a parent like you" and Sauce has to save him from getting horribly killed in an explosion.   daughterfu  The Naruto/Sarada relationship is the closest and most we've seen to a father/daughter relationship in the entire manga.           See:        There's supposed be some special announcement after the movie or something, so maybe they're just going to go straight to doing a Boruto anime    You don't actually believe this, do you?   I think you misunderstood me. I was saying that it's unlikely that Kishimoto won't remove those obstacles which is preventing Sarada from having the highest opinion of Sasuke possible. Which is why it's very likely Kishi will make the matter with Karin a misunderstanding, unless he thinks he can justify it in such a way that makes Sasuke look "not so bad" in the end.  Really, our problem is that we've been assuming this whole time that Sarada does have a strained relationship with her dad in the movie, but nothing has come out to confirm this except for an ambiguous "spending time with papa is super shannaro" statement which may or may not be in the movie. Heck, according to the plot summary, Boruto searches for Sasuke after hearing Sarada say her papa was Naruto's "only rival," which may imply that it's Sarada's commending her father that compels Boruto to want to be trained by him. As much as I don't like it, this is probably going to end with Sarada saying "Papa was the coolest guy"             That's probably Sasuke's susanoo, man.     Before Tobirama's death the whole Uchiha clan was a thing, and now there are only two.   He would be happy.      It is. The pottery thing is how he's wearing Naruto's jacket and Sasuke's scratched headband.  Boruto is meant to be a combination of Naruto and Sasuke, giving him the byakugan would get in the way of that.       That's exactly what's going to happen. It's not even a joke.      Don't forget that every couple of years, there will be a new movie or OVA      he doesn't know that Salad is going to have her face carved onto the same rock as him     there will be a new movie or OVA  This would be okay.          Chidori   Nah, Sasuke went full Raikiri when teaching Burrito.      Looks like the Bolt movie is getting an Australian release. This means we might get another Aussie camrip.    what about an Aussie dub?    Shit, nigga, we got clearer images of that wall poster. That means we might even get translations of the character profiles.   And here's the second. Gives us a better look at Himawari's design, too.    that's one manly dadruto    Is the villain a chick or a trap?    the uzumaki clan was so fear they where wipe out and there allies didn't help cuz they knew how powerful they where      Schwarzenegger neck      Voiced by Hisoka so trap.   What if Tobirama and Donquixote Doflamingo and Aizen teamed up to kill all peasants, Uchiha, and shinigami?  lol this is the woman who voices naruto in english   That would be absolutely mind blowing, the fallout from the fanbase would be cataclysmic to say the least   and to my surprise, the idea saddens me because love it or hate it, anyone who watched this show or read it when they were young teens like I did cant help but feel its somewhat ingrained in their appreciation of anime &amp; manga       Every time an Uchiha smiles, something terrible happens.   Next chapter confirmed for drama.         slowpoke.jpg      can you awake the byakugan or as soon as your born you have it     everybody knows that      he  where is the proof      Crikey Nazza, howa we gonna deal with all these sharing-cunts   fackin malty-shadoh clown jitsu mate, no worries       Sasuke, Boruto and the kages head on a mission to rescue his ass   no Salad       More like   Just don't fall in love with him Shikadai   Why would I do that mom? He's kind of an annoying little shit when you get down to it.   Just don't.   ...and hey! I'm a boy!   Just don't!            i hope aussie anon makes it this time too and what happened the guy who lives in japan that leaked webm of The Last kissu scene?     Fetishfag pls. If anything, Shikadai is the one pulling aggro with his looks and parentage     Himawari confirmed for Stoic character.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7b3<wbr>Dmr0Btpc</wbr>  [ ]      and what happened the guy who lives in japan that leaked webm of The Last kissu scene?  Something about bamboo shoots and fingernails.     heh she looks like my aunt  mfw recently realized that Orochimaru is voiced by Woman       would watch      she starts crying like this when Bort knocks her cake onto the floor      bamboo shoots and fingernails.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambo<wbr>o_torture   After World War II, stories circulated of Japanese soldiers inflicting "bamboo torture" upon U.S. and Allied prisoners of war, where the victim was tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot.[1] Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging through the other side.[2] The cast of the TV program MythBusters investigated bamboo torture in a 2008 episode and found that a bamboo shoot can penetrate through several inches of ballistic gelatin in three days. For research purposes, ballistic gelatin is considered comparable to human flesh, and the experiment thus supported the viability of this form of torture, not its historicity. In her memoir "Hakka Soul", the Chinese poet and author Woon-Ping Chin[3] mentions the "bamboo torture" as one of those tortures the locals believed the Japanese performed on prisoners.[4]   holy shit thats fucked up    </wbr>      Eh, I've heard worse.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scap<wbr>hism</wbr>       I don't want it to be over. I don't want it to be over!  It's the best Naruto has been in years, maybe ever. I wish it would go on for 600 chapters.       Seems like Himawari is going to sound older than she looks.     Strewth! I wish I had no fucking parents than you as me dad, ya shitcunt!  I could dig it.     ayane sakura talked to boys a total of 3 times in high school  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p-f<wbr>JxDqDXSw</wbr>  [ ]  is this even possible? goddammit japan      But Yukarin knows people want her to marry Nana and doesn't even say anything against it.     Murakawa Rie and Kobayashi Yuu  This is gonna be one heck of a crazy video.     Good. Mine is precious.    Because Nana is a big personality and if Yukarin says something against her or something that will make both of their fans sad she'll get in a huge mess.

Requesting something cute of Cathyl, cute lewd is fine too.     see  for why obvious trolls for whom stubbornness is more important than her shouldn't be encouraged.    That's actually a very good piece of drawing. Good job    pls. Just pls.    that's super good, gj.    As I said in that post, we can have a thread if you want me to explain to you what katakana are.    I'm not him, but last week was fucking stupid. I don't care what the argument was, but it shouldn't have lasted for 3 threads.   Cyan from show by rock rocking out in this outfit.

Three threads are nothing.    glad you like it   Requesting Yutsuki.  Requesting my lovely bassist, Akiyama Mio, enjoying and dancing/playing Dance Dance Revolution.

Anything cute would be good too.  Thank you if you consider, and have a nice week-end.        Requesting Kyou Fujibayashi dressed as White  I'd like to request Nio wearing a plugsuit from Evangelion, please. If possible, please keep her bowtie on as part of the design.

Requesting Rangiku forcing anon to take her shopping for beach clothes.  Requesting Pamela coming out of the water with a very wet and skin stuck bikini while water drips off her soft, defined, curves. Thank you      Hmmm       to be fair (not saying one way or another) if someone sees a format they like they might use a similar one in their own request.    Yes, they do look quite suspicious.    I am considering doing the same. My only request won't get drawn and the "anything" part is always ignored.    I want to say that the first two are at least different people because two different IPs but I'm not so hopeful.    leave meibro alone    How would you know it's separate IPs?   Meifag and Hinafag are not the same people you morons. If you weren't so summer you'd know that.  I can't speak for Victorique but given the amount of autism that seems to be following him around he has his own story, too.     Appchan setting to display IP count for each new IP next to the post.    Why do you keep doing this?    You seem to be the third, at the very least.    I guess the effort wasnt good enough this time around right?     mami     cute waifus     Not Oora!    Requesting Hagoromo Gitsune leading her hyakki yakou or wearing the outfit on the right side of the reference. Anything else is fine, too.  Hello everyone!, requesting Reimu wearing a bikini, maybe like the Asuna's one with that hawaiian style, or like Miku enjoying a drink on the sea, or like Hibiki with a flower in the head, you can choose the one you like it more for my dear Reimu,please and thank you in advance   OR here, thank you anon! Her outfit looks really cute.    Healthy!   Requesting Sawyer with a teddybear or stuffed animal of some sort:  http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1673276 http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1842966  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.j<wbr>pg</wbr></a>  </wbr> </wbr>    Requesting my lovely angel Kaede-tan. Since we're at the end of the season, I'd like to make a VA-related request of her dressed up as either Shinoa Hiiragi or Ryuu Lyon in their combat outfits. If you pick Shinoa's, one potentially interesting thing to note is that Kaede is over 8 inches (21 cm) taller. If you pick Ryuu's, giving her elf ears would be very cute.  Here's the ref for the outfits: http://i.imgur.com/49oj6jF.jpg      Flatchouli   I love you.     What's the general attitude towards requesting both here and in the other drawthreads, assuming one requests the same character, but not the same thing? Is it frowned upon?  Requesting Misha in a zipper bikini or the lingerie in the bottom-right corner or like a trucker with the hat too, please and thank you. Additional references: http://imgur.com/a/CbSUD#0    Don't double-dip.     Is it frowned upon  Heavily. You can maybe get away with doing it on other boards, but if you request here and in the /a/ general you're going to get roasted.    Requesting Hex Maniac wearing some thigh highs, maybe with garters. On-model or 36J stuff welcome.   Reminder that he will just appear in the general if you draw for him here.     video game character    npc    Why is this allowed?       Quit pushing me around Phalanx! I swear once i'm done with the training arc, you will see!   Thanks for drawing, it does takes time and effort to draw even it it FLAT!       You ungrateful little shit.    tsuntsun ycake is cute.   Requesting Ryuko waiting to get sunscreen rubbed on her back.  Mine's an odd request but could I have Tenryuu in a mecha version of this tank? If the color scheme could be in purple and black rather than the tank's scheme of blue and metallic white as shown in one of the pictures that would be nice. If camouflage is a possibility though that would be pretty great! And instead of her sword perhaps an energy saber of some sort in a purple and black color scheme would be a nice add on too.  I can provide a video of the unit in action of needed, but it comes from an old RTS game.   Anything cute or  scary  will do if the idea isn't interesting enough!   Already requested, but how about something fun to try for drawfags?  Requesting waifu team attacks.    Requesting Junko Enoshima canoeing down a river of blood and dead bodies.  Requesting Futayo Honda dressed as a school nurse (Lab coat, Glasses, Sweater or a top exposing her lacy bra and Pencil Skirt. Stockings optional) or dressed as Namie Yagiri from Durarara!!  Namie Reference: http://imgur.com/a/EhPdW  I'm fine with anything as usual, Thanks!        Heres Eto, I hope you like it   Requesting a drawing of Len and white len doing a fusion pose, Or a drawing of len wearing frilly gothlolita like clothes.  Any drawing of len would be fine too.      Did I do something wrong in mine?      Thank you very much for waiting patiently for it. I'm sorry that I couldn't get it done fast enough. I got upset and tore it up due to personal problems. I'm redrawing it right now.    Requesting anything cute of my daughteru, Fiona Mayfield. Thanks in advance!   I support this. Maybe with waifus in PQ's chibi style.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127223695   waifu drawthread   ;_;   Is there ever any support for husbandos here? I've been wondering that for a while.       Which one of them?    plenty     I like this idea. Sounds cute.     No worries anon just do you best!    no one would pick my waifu in a team    Or even Persona style!   Im adicted to checking if she was drawn. Please offer help.       I can draw her so you stop checking    A watched drawfag never completes a 2-second sketch.     This sounds nice, perhaps there could be themed combinations (DFC group, short hair group etc) depending on the artist's preference.     Can you do ?    Onegaishimasu.    tfw your waifu isn't popular enough and well liked   everyone says you have shit taste  Fuck.     You must tell me who she is    This is awesome.    Fuck off Mimifag. Nobody wants your shitty Disgaea theme.   Requesting Pacifica as a cute sailor girl, please! http://img.ctrlv.in/img/15/06/26/55<wbr>8d58e48832c.jpg</wbr>   Kanna! In some cute outfit! thanks in advance!     But then everyone will bully me and her.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127225011   You do know 34 drew this the week of the "all waifus delivered" weekend     How the fuck am I going to draw her then?   Requesting this scene. But instead of Misaka trying to hold her skirt down. She doesn't care because she wearing shorts underneath.  Her face should be like a "I don't care". Perhaps shes busy texting, or her arms or crossed, or what ever you want.  (background and background characters of course not needed)       I've never heard of that before.    i really suck at coloring, but i hope you like it. you can rerequest if you want to    Learn to read minds through text.    Draw mine instead     I haven't forgotten you said "I don't mind her losing her funbags"    Requesting a list of waifu bust sizes starting from biggest to flattest.   Very cute.    I feel like you're someone I should be recognizing instantly, but it's not coming to me.  Anyway, super cute!      What if my waifu's varies?    Pretty sure that K or NotK imitating Harda style.    I like this idea. Should we make a list of the combat waifus in the thread?    Crabs    thank you    No. Combat or not doesn't matter.    This is super cute and I hope one day you draw my waifu.       I haven't forgotten you said "I don't mind her losing her funbags"   "Wow you should love you're waifu as she is it is only ok to shit on ycake for it!"  At least be consistent thread.      Drawthread is made of many different persons and opinions    ycake is for bullying    Y-you look cute.    It was an art trade and I think he only said that because he knows I don't like big breasts.    You don't bully your friends?     Not liking big breasts    Requesting my dear Ion, thank you!   But that's really cute anon, I really like it. I love how embarrassed she looks.  Thanks a lot anon, I hope you have a great weekend!      added to the list    I guess some people liked the format I use, but yeah, I had a feeling people would say I'm haremfagging if I posted right after the first guy you linked.   Requesting her sunbathing, or lying in some grass, please. Thanks for stopping by!     What name should I put by her picture?    彼女の名前は?    I wanted to draw her for you a while ago.  As you know still practicing so sorry for badly drawn wifi.      Junk Emoshitma.    Do you have a link to the colored bottom right picture you have?  I need it for reasons.      What's her name?    知りませんwwww    Damn, this is really amazing.    everything will be ok, even if she has no name    that's nice    holy shit nice    Pretty lewd, but she looks very relaxed. Good job.   Requesting.  Since it's her birthday today. Requesting Yuumi receiving her presents like the genki girl that she is, anything else is fine, really. Have a great weekend and good luck!     Why does Futayo get all the nice deliveries?    You keep improving your coloring with leaps and bounds, Twrl-senpai. Lovely work    Because he does art trades      Why does anon do nothing but shitpost at home alone on a Friday night?   rip this drawing looks like shit there goes my confidence   Requesting Lain!   ayy    What episode and time does she appear? You've been requesting her long enough to pique my curiosity.     bringing yourself up     very nice    Let's all love Lain!    Thanks, I've been trying to focus on that a little bit.   Requesting anything Frau koujiro   Very cute    Aw, thank you. I like it, and as you keep drawing and practicing you can only get better. Thank you, have a great weekend!    Why does she have a sheath on her hip while also unsheathing the blade?    shhh     I wish I had a pair of pajamas like that     Two swords fumbass.     fumbass      Fumbass     She carries two, she loses them a lot.   Requesting Erika, please! Anything would be lovely, but doing capoeira or something with a similarly dynamic pose would be pretty great, but alternatively something cute that could soothe my heart would be nice.  Thanks a lot, and I hope you're all having a nice weekend!    I would appreciate anything of Kurumi. For example, wearing an evening dress sitting on a bed's edge, or at a bar or sorts. If you want a specific outfit, a classy dress fashioned after her Astral Dress.    fumbass     There clearly isn't another sword there. Look at the hilt of the one she's drawing; you'd be able to see that sticking up from behind her hand if there were another sword in there.  Dingbat.     Clearly it's pointed towards her back so perspective makes it stay behind her hand.    It didn't end up looking much like her, but I hope you like it anyway!    That doesn't even make sense.   Since I have plenty of pictures of my waifu in her frilled uniform and because I heard that her hair is a bit complex to draw, requesting her in an outfit of your choice and in a cute hairstyle that the drawfriend finds a bit easier. Long, straight hair is something she's done for example  How much gesture drawing do you guys do?   Kawaii    This is a fucking awesome delivery, and I'm sure OR will love it.    This is nice.    Your drawings are really cute.    I think you need to work on your hands a bit, but the face is really cute!    Not enough   Has despair set in yet?   cosy and cute     edgyfluf.jpg  I giggled. She's looking mighty  sharp  there. I love it, thank you very much!    Ryuu has two blades, neither of which have crossguards. Let's go with            I'm having empty thoughts like last week, yeah    I'll give it until Sunday night again before despair fully sets in.    The weekend hasn't even started.    But anon, it's only the first day. Stay hopeful everyone!     I haven't even requested yet and it's set in.     I despair everyday, the fact she hasn't been drawn contributes little to that.  Mostly cause I can just as easily do it myself.     Is anyone streaming?   You should have a picarto account by now, anon-kun    I watch other people's streams but I'm not fond of streaming myself. Besides,  I'm a bit busy with comms  but I like checking in now and then.   Post WIPs   I gave her different hair if you're cool with that   Requesting ghost girl Kanoe Yuuko as a Ghostbuster.   Bonus points for any gratuitous inclusion of Bill Murray...     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127228472  pls no   it's shit       Despair why? I got a delivery in the first thread   Requesting Dyshana wearing a black sleeveless sweater or top and a white skirt, pregnant and happily cradling her baby bump. More references: http://imgur.com/a/kWB2E#0   Also, never really got the chance to thank the bro that replied to my request at the very last minute last week. Cheers, mate!   Damn that's fucking cute anon. Eureka seems to look pretty cute with a lot of hairstyles.     Here, Anon. It's a bit too sketchy, but hope you like it.   Hello, drawthread.       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127228782   I have no idea what the list or the circle is, just picked what I liked. You drawfags are like the Illuminati.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127228782  Are you starting shit    This is cute as hell. Nice work.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127228782  Fucking kill yourself.      Requesting Kurumi posing semi lewdly with her shovel or fighting a zombie in her bikini.  Please and thankyou!     Surely you must be joking.   Requesting Mazaki Anzu being blushfully embarrassed, the reason for being so up to the artist.  Any other works are very much appreciated.      not sure if you can recognize them but here you go. feel free to request again and all that other fun stuff.      I hope you like it      I used to namefag as blush long time ago but I stopped using it         cute~   also cute~        782  You're getting a lot better. I'd say to spend time practicing the torso. Slimming it down while maintaining the girls' proportions might improve the look of your characters.     ignore that green text not even sure how that got there     Requesting Kukaku as Rosy the Riveter with a wide smile on her face.   Requesting my husbando Kuranosuke Koibuchi, perhaps acting romantic and/or saying " I love you."  Have a good weekend.     Hooolyshit this is cute!  Thanks SSF. Have a great weekend! Continue your drawing journey!~  you can rerequest  how can I though after this?        You're a shit.     green text portion  I've noticed on some browsers if you have something highlighted when you reply it'll automatically copy it into your reply box. gets confusing sometimes  advice  thanks, its always nice to get that.       Very nice. I always love your drawings.   Requesting Yuki reading intensively a manga or a LN, wearing her glasses, thank you in advance  Hi everyone in the 2nd thread. Requesting my love Shinobu laughing after hearing something particularly ridiculous.  Thank you and have a nice weekend, all!      I stopped  Why is that?  I was very happy when I saw you coming here again.       Nah. I expect my request won't be taken but I will still hope for the best. No despair for me as I got a cat.    Morning with Kaede! Hope you are still here.    Very cute. The alternate hairstyle is adorable!  my thanks.      oh my~ that's good     drowsy waifu with bed head   I know what I'm requesting next week!  This is awesome, keep up the great work!        fuggin cute   Requesting Vert wearing a suit and tie, please!  A bit late in the thread this time, sorry. Still hope everyone is doing well though! Requesting Shinjiro flipping through the channels on a tv, looking bored as hell; just coming out of the shower  no lewd please ; or hiking somewhere pleasant. Anything is also fine, thank you very much and I hope everyone remembers to take it easy.     It's actually looks great. Thank you for drawing her!     This is wonderful, Anon.     Draw more fluffiness, that is amazing.    gosh your drawings are always so adorable.  never stop please. I wish I had a waifu just so I had a chance to get something from you     This is adorable enough that it hurts. Lovely work.    Thanks drawfriend! Your month of learning has paid off. I really like your colouring.    What do I do to get a delivery of this quality?   My end of a trade with the guy who drew Cona Madaya for me.   Not be an unlikable asshole.  That's pretty cool anon, nice job.      art trade   wait, how do art trades work again? they're not deliveries right?    Promise an art trade, but then never actually return the favor.    commission    If you're asking if you should keep requesting after a successful art trade, the answer is no, it's distasteful    But no one outside of shitposters hate me. I've even had a few drawfags in the Circle draw her.    Then just wait. Only like 2 or 3 drawfriends ever acknowledge me, it just takes patience.     It's really great, thank you very much Twrl. Enjoy your weekend.    Sure, but can I know for what reasons?        even fluffier hair   cute drowsy face   that drool   that lighting  Holy moley this is gorgeous! She is absolutely adorable and I only wish I could wake up to see a sight this grand next to me. I've really enjoyed the work you've done so far, but this is by far the best (I may be a little biased). Thank you so much!        Not all of us can draw that well anon, even if we put our all into it.    I've been delivered, but I was also  trying  a request that also offered a trade  i don't know it's looking pretty bad though     Requesting Tsubaki dressed as Tsubaki, please. Fox ears and tail are not needed.   You and your waifu are a cute.    Oh, well then no, you can keep delivering trades and (hopefully) getting returns.   Rori draw my waifu,   who is your waifu my friend    Here you go.    Oora!   Requesting Noire dressed as a knight, similar to the RO Rune Knight please.   That looks like utter shit Pass    Requesting Mei Mer sleeping on tip of a comfy bed, mermaid form preferred.     Thanks, I'm surprised I even got a response, NSA-chan isn't a very popular character.     Face it, poor girl looks like she crawled right out of Innsmouth...     This is cute. Keep drawing anon      Oh come on.  Dunwich, at least            Thank you all!   Have a waifu with super fuwa fuwa hair maybe, or get lucky. Or art trades.   Thank you! I'm glad you like it. Kaede is cute, I'll draw her even fluffier someday.          Tomorrow will be the day.   Alright anon, surely you aren't a liar. Here you go.   Greetings wwd! I'd like to request this beautiful young comedian. All levels of drawfags are welcome to try their hand at drawing her. Thank you in advance if I'm sleeping or out and you decide to try your hand at it.  Have a nice weekend everyone and good luck with your requests.     Die.    That's really cute Rori, I hope Oorabro likes it.    Fuwa Fuwa time    Cute! Oorafag deserves it. Now draw my waifu please it's Ryou/    http://sharkweekcountdown.com/  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lV8<wbr>i-pSVMaQ</wbr>  [ ]     If you're going to desperately beg at least have enough of a spine to not put it in spoilers.    Thanks dude, but I've gotten enough rori to last me for a while.     tfw couldn't think of a shark-related idea   And he's re-requesting, at that.      Not exactly what you requested, but here you go. Have a nice weekend!    You're husbando a cute, and your request made me smile.    Sorry, I'm not much of an artist.  You can re-request if you'd like.       Oh good, you saw it, I don't need to worry about that anymore. Glad you like it!   Deliverin'  So I need to see my past self who though this was a good idea and remove the thought.  I apologize for no colors, but my hand hurts too much to continue with this.          oora getting all these deliveries again  is it going to happen again?      It was actually Rori   I hate you you Ooraposting faggot.       Who gives a fuck?      Burned out after a big delivery and left for a while. The threads seemed to change a lot while I was gone so I dropped it since it didn't seem to be of use anyway     you can not bring attention      Thanks a lot you guys, these are absolutely awesome. Thanks for the lovely birthday presents!      I'd actually like it to happen. I think oora is a cute character and I like seeing art of her.     Nice meme.   It's okay, the circle is only drawing her IRONICALLY for their shitposting :)   this circle meme is stupid  you know the drawfags cant draw circles      Happy belated birthday, prambro.  I didn't know you shared one with me.<br/>      so is this like reverse-psychology in shitposting form?    fight me.   Oora a cutie!   literally part of my everyday practice is like 10 minutes of just drawing circles  I still can't draw them consistently enough      looks like all that time not spent practicing finally paid off.   Requesting Yomi sumbathing with a slight tan and either with visible tanlines or showing them off    2000x2000   You trying to crash my SAI, anon-kun?      Requesting haremfags waifus being burnt at the stake.    I hope you get a delivery too then, anonbro   Is there anyone in "the circle" who isn't a drawfag?   me!    I draw in 12000x12000 though be thankful I needed to save space.    hello     the circle  Stop that. There's plenty of people who hang out and can;t draw.       12000x12000  Jesus, why? I can barely handle anything past 4000x4000, who needs that much space?     they're the ones who get the scraps and leftover, spillover effort after the drawfags fellate each other in their cabal      Who the fuck are you people, only drawfags are in the true circlejerk         simple because I can.      Okay, and? You guys need to stop fear mongering. People skilled like that are going to flock together naturally. Who cares if they draw together? It's a natural social dynamic.         I'll make you eat those words    jura will never draw your waifu    so did they say in the stream chat if you defended then they'd give you a handout?    Requesting Alice taking the Poppy knot   /Oora/i  in all fields     That uses up RAM so fast. And the brush max size is only a fraction of that. And I can't use textured brushes in Photoshop because of the sheer lag on a canvas so big.  x___x     Yes anon, I traded free drawings of my waifu that I was already getting for brownie points with some random people on the internet.  If you're as daft as you're letting on that was a fucking joke you imbecile.        how do you guys do that whenever i try drawing circles they always come out looking like this      Oh, I didn't say there was anything wrong with it. I just meant that there aren't any non-drawfags in the circlejerk that I know of.   loomis told me my circles didn't have to be perfect though was that a ruse?    I want to drown in that fluff    Spongebob pls   How can such a plain looking girl be so cute?    The anime art is disgusting.  What's going on /a/. Been off of weebshit for 2 months now. what'd i miss? is there a new berserk chapter yet?  Stay off it and go be normal somewhere else, faggot.   first thing that happens to me is i get chewed out by a trip fag. now i remember why i left /a/.    Berserk   a new chapter being released this year    What does it mean to be Edgy nowadays /a/?   I demand a clear definition.    A character that isn't one dimensional  /a/ definition of Edgy = "Things that I do not like"   Characters made for 14 year olds.    Watch Fate/Zero and you will understand     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127230204  Boku no Atlus    Take everything Vincent Valentine, Every Shounen Protagonist, a stereotypical reddit poster and /b/ have in common and that is the definition of edgy   *unsheathes daikatana* *teleports behind you* pssh, nothin personnel, kid... *cuts ur head off* dats what you get for ruining the german economy during the 1920's...        yaoi hands     that rape face  i hope ingame he has all the asshole options to be complete opposite of yu's snarky additude      /a/ is full of manchildren and children pretending to be manchildren, you're not going to get a decent answer        Why is Potter-kun so handsome?    To not be based Yu Narukami, of course.   Being a faggot that likes suffering and having okada and butcher as favorite writers.  i hope we get to see these demon models in more games.  I dont think this is edgy.   At the forefront of a trend; experimental or avant-garde. Think bleeding edge technology. If an anime is doing something that hasn't been done before or is newish then it's edgy.  Sidonia is edgy.     That face is awful.      is that you, yumi     Complete disregard for the worth of life   Standoffish towards others, essentially a cunt   Believes in darkness like it's a living entity that "swallows" the humanity of others who face it   Wearing red and black doesn't make someone edgy.        but what if you're in a world where everyone's like that      PROPORTIONS!    Kiritsugu would be the definition of edgy if instead of breaking down after doing something cold he just went "pshh nothing personnel"   If the character is like Killua then it is edgy. i think only Killua does edgy right     Literally Owari no Seraph. I'd post a pic but I already deleted every episode off my hd.    He has the word kill in his name!   Let me try to give you a definition that isn't just circular, vague term-dropping  "Edgy" just unwarranted, excessive, artificial-seeming and/or intentionally super-imposed amounts of negative or aggressive qualities.   Broodiness, heavy amounts of black, sharp objects and violent behavior aren't inherently BAD, as long as there's a believable basis for those things in the story to justify them.  If there's no foundation for it that can be explained by the character's surroundings or past, then it comes off as tryhard. It's hamfisted. It's like shock value, wherein you KNOW you're expected to have some sort of reaction, which dilutes the reaction and makes you roll your eyes instead. It breaks the suspension of disbelief and makes you say, "I get it already, holy shit."  Not very many teenagers are cultured, and a lot of the stuff they like is the first they've seen of that kind of thing - they have nothing to compare anything to, and so shock value - characters who are dark in a baseless way - appeal to them.  It's all about the foundation, the rationale.               Why is everything black red and bloom?      Hes in a dark dungeon summoning his persona    Is that a shadow for ants?     Weird I had a bigger pic earlier.  But yea       Are you that same faggot that keeps starting threads with pics of the mc and calling him edgey? Because you're a faggot    Everything.    Garu Stu needs to be add to that chart. Pretty much spot on though.         Any broody or grimdark character/setting or one-dimensional plot development made for the sake of coming off as serious or deep. SAO for example kills a character we just met in the episode to make us feel "SO CONFLICTED" but really it's just a hamfisted way of trying to seem dark and consequential only to never be brought up again. It's just bad writing in a show that already tries too hard to be serious and feelsy.  Persona 5 has the style and (from what it looks like) fun to compensate its screaming and head ripping. It's violent, but it features cocky, colourful characters in stylish environments and with a constant upbeat tone.  It might prove to be different when the game comes out, but at the moment there's nothing too edgy about Persona 5 from the trailers we've seen.         Is this the first persona game that has gone that far?    Japanese fire Lupin Batman, Yankee Ghost Rider, Ice Skate Genki Catwoman, and Morgan Le Fay is a Cat steal the world is greatest purse owner from Junlock Sholmes.   It's like if everyone's born a millionaire, then no one is rich.    Nah.  Thanatos tears orpheus apart in P3(It's censored in the anime). Also P2 had crazy stuff.   P4 has the bodies.

I've been too lazy to give it a chance because of that     Haikyuu　938 (+204)     Hell no, what? It's just porn. Just listen to it.    But I don't understand japanese   relatively soon™   Goddamn that's going to be a bitch to clean.    I heard that doujinshis are over. You will have to fap to JR alikes now.     Most are expect, but kinda surprised by haikyuus position.     Nia still won't do more doujin   Fucking Shingeki     Why does the next season seem so devoid of homo?    It does?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127215255  Shinoashitter gtfo, I may like her too, but you do not belong here.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127215255  What happened? Christ, can't I stay away for a couple of days     Stop responding, they feed off of attention.     It was just some autist spamming dumb shit in a thread about gay couples. Nothing to get excited about.    Ooh so it was someone from outside these threads? I thought the beef was between homodachis, if I had known I wouldn't have asked    They're really going all out with those two, aren't they? Which is funny considering how irrelevant they were in the manga.    Just like every other season. At least we get this      Japanese television isn't ready for what they COULD have drawn in explicit detail. What if it's "uncensored" in the BD?    We actually got to see homo kisses this season in non homo shows  I hope this becomes the norm from now on    It's interesting how the top 3 are shounenshit with barely any homo in them.  So the theory about fujos preferring not to get pandered to directly and wanting to come up with their own gay delusions is true.     Huh? In what show?    Somehow Prince of Tennis still being popular makes me feel warm. I graduated from it years ago(though I watched some recent OVA) but it's so deeply set in homolust culture.    Well, not just any shounen, they're all sports anime.    Anon, please    Sports anime with majority male characters is all it takes.   Why are twins so good  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127216151  They were definitely awful but I'm pretty sure anon was referring to the Shinoa shitflinging, which was unrelated to the Free bullshit.    Sports series are the Fujo Mahou Shojo. Can't go wrong with them.     Is this the Mahou Shounen thing? Rips when.    Gangsta might be good if you put on your goggles.    My copy won't arrive until a week or two from now, so I hope somebody uploads it before then.    Yes but that's from second CD which is out in August. They are voiced by Tsubasa Yonaga. The first CD was out this week, I'm still waiting for mine and could provide a rip if there's no one out by then(might take a while though).    OTP T P       pink shoulders  Dropped     Neat. Tsubasa Yonaga voiced mai waifu.    There are at least two actual homo shows.    Isn't that just because they're blushing? The dudes that give no fucks don't have them    Looks super interesting.    X will never get a proper ending  Fuck everything.    Not really, fujos love No6. It's just that usually gay shows are terrible and romanceshit (see Nakamurashit or Love Stage). I'm convinced that a show with a plot like Tiger&amp;Bunny with actual gay main characters would be a huge success among fujos.     Tiger&amp;Bunny  Is it gay or homobaiting?     Look carefully.    Bait but there's also a canon gay character who gets a surprisingly serious character arc in the movie.    If I'm not wrong the staff said that the relationship between Barnaby and Kotetsu could also be interpreted "that" way.    Oh shit, my bad It's not very noticeable because of the scan quality but now I see the glow     In my opinion, if they say it can be "interpreted" it is bait    Yeah, anything can be interpreted. If they don't deliver it in canon then it's just empty words.    You're waifu a slut.    Is CLAMP's artstyle really that different now that it would be pointless in trying to finish it? I haven't really kept up with them so I have no idea what their current style looks like.   It was going to be a suffering ending anyway.    Their were a lot of talks this week about some sort of drama within Sunrise with Ozaki leaving and BNP being their own thing now. Apparently Ozaki took the T&amp;B right with him. Not sure if any of this is true but can anyone confirm this?   Pic related Young Black jack character designs.

The gigantic double-sided poster of the Hen-Ai guys came too, but I'm still patching that together in photoshop.         I forgot how lewd it was for him to use his thumb to separate Jou's lips.    Next season seems to be full of haremshit LNs and ecchishit, looks like it'll be a backlog season for me outside of Working!!!, Non Non and a few original wildcards.     tagame  This doesn't devolve into guro torture porn half way in, right?       It's getting a yet another new season this summer, the whole thing is ONA as usual.        <br/>      Thank you    I don't understand the Haikyuu craze when it's regular sports shounen shit with absolutely no homo and unappealing designs unless you're into little boys. Same with yowapeda. I understand Kuroko since the boys look delicious and it's at least a bit homo.     unappealing designs  I like them, KnB guys are better for wanking over but the Haikyuus are cuter.     If you find that cute, might as well fap to hamsters.    Okay    I don't watch any of them, but I think the Haykyuus look better than the Kurokos (they have great bodies but they look too generic).     unless you're into little boys  I am.     They look more like birds or lizards.    If you think the Kurokos look like anything but dogshit, you need to get your eyes checked.    Lizards, exactly.   They still look miles better than Your average Nip salaryman looks like a model next to these.   You mean ugly little boys.           You're just shitposting at this point.    Stop it, Haikyuufriends are untrollable.  I'll give you a true and best lizard.      They look like dogshit only when they look like haikyus.      someone asks a legitimate question and has a different opinion than you    hurr durr shitposter  Never change, faggots.      Oh God. I have been waiting for this for so long. Thank you, anon! It's translated suffering time.    Yes, I put yowapeda in the same bag.    Fuck off with that random 3DPD jew    Ok.      Thank you. There are many good things in Harada's stuff and when it ends it leave you speechless and feeling empty. I know this but I keep repeating the process, fuck.    Too bad homo was killed when Tooru was paired up with the nurse.     perfection  But those recessive chins. They look like mouth breathers.     Their personalities are great and while the original art style isn't hot - it's cute rather - the designs are good and the fanart can definitely make them attractive.     unless you're into little boys  Nothing wrong with that.     Mah nigga. Is there going to be a fourth one?   So homodachi, what's your opinion on gay toddlers?    toddlers  'no'      thinking fucking 3 year olds mean it romantically  "no"     Toddlers are disgusting, even when gay.  Grown men acting like toddlers, on the other hand, is adorable.      uh    BASED    I will never understand this fetish     Vertical  They barely do anything alternative anymore. There was a book focusing on gay manga and Tagame that was published by Fantagraphics so it would probably be something they'd license, especially with Matt Thorn and Chip Kidd working there.     Damn.     Grown men acting like toddlers, on the other hand, is adorable.   I can only feel pity for such a man. A real deep pity, the kind where you feel a knot in your stomach.      Mah nigga. Saiminjutsu Nyuumon is also pretty good.     Is he using Osaka-ben?    Sorry, I hadn't read yet.    this guy knows his shit   homodaps       Well, to be fair the phrasing of his answer leaned more toward the suggestion that the homo interpretation is the preferred one, he also ended with a "and I'm counting on your imagination" bit. Then there're the OP and ED lyrics for the movies which, when confirmed to be from MC's POV, written in accordance with the script are almost always blatantly and indisputably gay. To me it looks more like they show whatever they can, but their corporate laws will never allow them to go full gay.   Yes it's confirmed. Actually, if I'm not mistaken Sunrise is the property of Bandai, not the other way around, therefore it would be more accurate to say Bandai decided to split their intellectual properties between Sunrise (all it has left are gundams) and BNP which took everything else. Ozaki is the managing director of the company, and T&amp;B is said to be their flagship property. Sunrise only cared about gundams anyway, so having a separate company to manage other works seems like a favorable outcome. The only thing that worries me is that Tamura was left with Sunrise, and he is one of the five main creators of T&amp;B. Here's the full list of what BNP took: http://www.bn-pictures.co.jp/        Thank you and the anons that helped. That was a very sad, disturbing, and arousing reading. As expected from Harada..      he also ended with a "and I'm counting on your imagination" bit  Who was it that gave the statement anyway?  I hope Sunrise whips up some new IPs soon. As much as I like Gundam they've burned themselves out with too much of it many times before.       Feels pretty good, doesn't it?    They're going to burn out the Mai-Hime franchise next    Better that than more Cross Ange.     Who was it that gave the statement anyway?  Ozaki     Thanks.    You take that back, Cross Ange was AOTY.   Natsuno loving him was canon, wasn't it?       That guy looks ready for other activities rather than sleeping    Yes, things like cuddling and hair fluffing.    Does nobody remember that special anymore, where Kotetsu invited Barnaby to his house for a evening with champagne, got pissed that everyone else came because it was supposed to be just the two of them and admitted having wet dreams with what was intended to be a Barnaby look-alike?    Absolutely delicious. Thanks.    It's called pandering. Quit getting your hopes up and lying to yourself for nothing.     Cross Ange   AOTY      So when they show them fucking on screen that'll be pandering too? Gotcha.    Pandering is teasing without delivering. Subtle shit is just bait.     You're a fucking saint anon.    I love you.   This was way cuter and more funny than it had any right to be. Why hasn't this mangaka made more shit yet?   dat ass    Kotetsu and Barnaby have done about everything a couple could do except kissing on screen, the show doesn't do romance stuff in general although their feelings were confirmed in numerous official sources.    You're too good to us, anon.    Anime when?  Timeskip incest doujins when?     Asta/Juno doujins when? The pairing is basically Naruto/Saucegay and more.    Pandering is teasing without delivering.  Pandering implies gratification or satisfaction. You can use it to describe many types of fanservice, but stop being retarded and thinking "without delivering" is part of the definition.     Sports anime are a gold mine for fujos.   I have tons of ships in them.      If it happens my heart will finally be at ease.    There is a reason people throw around the 'pandering to fujos' line so much. Fujos do get gratification from the tease but that doesn't make the characters or the show actually homo. That is the point I'm trying to make.You are just arguing semantics.  I could exchange the word 'pandering' for 'bait' if that word is triggering you.     No 6 wasn't wildly popular.     Being a toddlercon  Anon no     I personally didn't enjoy No. 6 that much. Nakamura's works are nice if you want a plot that involves more than 7 chapters, considering that BL mangas are mostly short.  I personally prefer Yoneda Kou if we talk about plot.      No.6 anime was okay but I much preferred the novel to the anime.   I want to kill this fucking cunt.  Guess it's going to be CR subs first this time, and on the season's finale even.  Also, try not to dubs spam here, anons.      Check my  where are the fucking subs    Cunt killer, how do you feel about Hachiman now that he is becoming almost everything the cunt represents?    CR is better than commeme   No dubs below this post or I'm telling moot  Still waiting for those fucking subs.   Ironic, coming from a spammer.   Commie is out   Who?

Check   tfw horriblesubs out at 1 am  Not even genuine.    I just want to see her smile again.   Why is she so perfect, anons?     MTSP Yui/Yuimama doujin never     Nobody ever proved Satan actually did anything bad. I'm sure you'd like him if you met and talked to him.  This is just my unbiased opinion.     Born that way, made that way by the author.    Please. She's most attractive when she's suffering.    Looks too much like Sena here    she smiles this episode though    Satan is by all accounts an Irohafag according to the last two triple six gets.    Why not just go for the mom then, she's already at perfection?  Lovely older woman stuck in a boring marriage has to live vicariously through her daughter's story about her highschool crush. 8man mistakes her for Yui's sister.

She asks him if he wants to /SS/          Satan confirmed for good taste   NE, NE TE I TO KU    He's just fucking with Irohafags trying to get their hopes up.     all these Irohafags     get out of here Naka-chan      We've always been here, the Fifth Wheel.

But she still will even if it's because she's happy for her two most important people.    Logistics. No matter how well she ages, the fact is that her life is still much more likely to be over long before yours, and then you'll be forced to spend your twilight years remembering, only ever seeing that brilliant smile in photos of her rather than right there next to you, warm and real.

The lolis can only power up and use attacks by farting. The difference in fart determines the type of attack. like a little pomf is just a simple punch whereas a long wet shitty fart is a big magma canon and when the lolis learn how to queef somewhere around episode 745 (this would be a very long show) they begin to level up and get so bug they transcend dimensions  The name would be Ultimate Biogenetic Fartbots in Infinite Universes are to Cute as they Obliterate Eachother with Dank Stenches       Well vaginal might not fit so anal makes sense.      go back to tumblr    She's 15.

His personality cute and I love him! You just have different tastes than I do, and that's okay.      because a person who emotionally abandons his supposed best friend and can't show him any affection what so ever, yet still expects it out of said best friend is cute.   becaues a person who isn't there for their best friend when they go through an emotional breakdown and yet still guilt trips them afterwards is cute.   anon plz.       Gon always had a very small build.     girl     Mistakes don't define a person. But, both of the things you've said have been pointed out within the series, so since it's been brought to attention that obviously means Killua will grow past being like that, reflect, and (maybe) apologize to Gon for it. However, I don't wish to get into an argument over this. If you see him as a bad person, there isn't much I can say to change your mind, and as someone who's had this same argument several times I think it'd be best if we dropped this, and maybe you accept others have different tastes than you. I'm not sure why people saying they like Killua seems to set off so many people in these threads, but again, I suppose it's all up to taste.   </blockquote>]
