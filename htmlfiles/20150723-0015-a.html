[ I'll keep the question simple, Overlord or GATE?  Overlord  Both are shit  <br>GATE. Overlord is another SAO tryhard with bad animation and characters.</br>  <br>How much screen time does this semen demon get? Really makes or breaks if I pick this up</br>  <br> source material <br>GATE<br><br> anime adaptation <br>Overlord</br></br></br></br></br>  man, Overlord sure is slow as fuck  easily gate  <br>Both are pretty mediocre. Overlord though has superior waifus.<br><br>A-1 also fucked up character designs for Gate. Can these fuckers do anything right?</br></br></br>  GATE was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism, but the start was better than anything in Overlord (I've read the first 3 volumes).   Gate: 24 eps <br> Overlord: 13 eps <br><br>Nuff said</br></br></br>  <br>More.</br>  <br>Overlord. <br><br>GATE gets retarded with a 40 chapter drama bullshit with the Elf going crazy.</br></br></br>  <br> 3eps already fucked up for nothing </br>  <br> was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism  <br>You have no right to have this opinion if you're an Amerifat.</br></br>  <br>I'm not and I find American jingoism more tolerable because they actually have the power to back it up. Japan does not.</br>  <br>but a broken elf is best elf.</br>  <br> American jingoism more tolerable <br> says the 'murrican while pretending to be not american </br></br>  <br>The difference is that America is actually a military superpower, while Japan doesn't even have an existing army</br>  <br>Why would I lie? My point still stands. America has the most powerful military in the world whereas Japan is America's bitch.</br>  What if the only reason GATE exists is to encourage jingoism and radical nationalism in Japan among otaku?  <br>Doesn't matter. It's still fiction and you're retarded if you can tolerate the American one but not the Japanese one.</br>  <br>Only thirteen eps, so not much and the most of it will be her wearing a full suit of armor.</br>  <br>Right now, Overlord. Maybe because i read Gate and did not Overlord LNs.<br><br>Gate i am looking forward to few moments being animated, but not very hype though enjoying it. Overlord for now is fresh, and unlike Gate does not gear gore.</br></br></br>  <br>And? Just because its fiction its based on reality, which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk<br><br>It's be like watching the Lord of the Rings and the halflings conquered the world from the shire, with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it</br></br></br>  <br>What if you are a butthurt ameri/k/unt?</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Melkor. Always bet on Melkor.</br></br>  <br>tojo plz leave</br>  <br>But thats not just gate. It goes decades ago, and passes through many stages.<br><br>From "anti-war" (in reality preparing children to fact that war is hell, but they`ll have to fight to survive even if their goverment is shit) Gundams, mecha in general, Night Raid, SnK, recently AirSoft to wake interest in guns and now Gate and reairing Grave of Fireflies in prime time.<br><br>Its all part of the plan. Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. War and nationalism propaganda was its core for long time, but there are other trends too - like recently attempts to fix the birth rates by propagating marriage and milfs or shows about work to make NEETs think work is actually fun and full of waifus.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'll keep the answer simple, Overlord.  <br>The one with Albedo.  Both shows suck anyway. </br>  GATE manga &gt; Overlord anime &gt; Overlord manga &gt; GATE anime<br><br> reading light novels <br>Hahaha oh wow.</br></br></br>  <br>The only one that sucks here is  your mom .</br>  <br> &gt;Overlord manga <br>Never knew it existed, huh.</br></br>  <br> overlord manga <br><br>Not really fair, since its only 5 chapters in, you should be comparing to the light novel</br></br></br>  <br> Reading period <br>You should be ashamed.</br></br>  The one that is not a rushed one cour with original ending. Also loving these new meme about faggots pretending overshit is good  <br>GATE all the way.</br>   Overlord <br> Protagonist is supposedly Lawful Evil <br> First thing he does is Chaotic Good </br></br>  <br>Just because it isn't called an army, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</br>  <br>He didn't care about the village, but felt indebted to help them because based Touch Me rubbing off on Sebas</br>  <br> Overlord or Gate? <br><br>Which one has the better art?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better female cast?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better mc?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has a better opening or closing?<br> Overlord <br><br>That wasn't difficult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Overlord, duh.<br>The only reason why people like the GATE anime is goth loli.</br></br>  <br>Foolish anon. He is extreme evil.<br>Every act of kindness towards humans is a carefully crafted deception.</br></br>  <br><br> /a/ says it's shit <br>Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>Will ever the assburgers stop shiting threads?<br><br>Gate<br><br>I dont like edge lord MCs, and this is too much power fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not adhering to /a/core <br>Enjoy your SAO clone.</br></br>  <br> edge lord <br>Now there's that word again.</br></br>  <br><br>i will, thanks ;)</br></br>  Overlord<br>Got to give it some points for evil lich MC</br>  <br>Gate. I haven't saw the third episode of Overlord yet but nothing happen in the first two episode. Gate doesn't have pacing issue and it's really satisfying to see modern military not jobbing for once. Also it's 24 episodes instead of 12.</br>  <br>I'm with this guy. Too bad Overlord isn't two cours.</br>  Both are shit. Just watch Rokka no Yuusha  <br> not trusting the collective of /a/nons judgement <br> hownewru.jpg.tiff <br>GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation. Overlord is just a generic battle shonen with an edgy dumbass MC who gets the dick for doing nothing, not to mention it being an mmo shit.</br></br></br>  <br>What if the only reason you're acting like that is because you're actually nationalistic at heart and refuse to want to see other countries do it?</br>  <br>It's like you didn't watch anyone of it.</br>  I've watched and read both.<br><br>Gate is about a middle aged guy trying to survive in the fantasy world.<br><br>Overlord is about a middle aged guy whose age stops mattering as the story goes on since it's the NPCs who run the story not him.</br></br></br></br>  Both dropped  <br>Worry not. He will become chaotic evil in no time.</br>  <br>look as a human Ainz was a good guy, but as time goes on the Extreme Evil that was his Lich will change his out look. he already doesn't care about human life</br>  <br> Gate <br> Source material <br> Not shit <br>It's a decent premise ruined by virtue of being little more than a vehicle for the author's fringe political views.</br></br></br></br>  <br>GATE because I'm not American</br>  <br>Nah you're just as right wing as he is, Amerifat.</br>  <br> I'm actually a pretty hard left by American standards. Not quite tumblr-SJW, but far enough. </br>  <br> implying you're not american <br> implying anyone is 'Murica's bitch. <br>Invading 3rd world shit places is all America can do, aside from humanitarians no one really gives a fuck about poor people being massacred. USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country.</br></br></br>  <br> USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country. <br>Because first world countries are, by definition, America and her allies. What country in their right mind would invade an ally?</br></br>  <br> China <br> Russia </br></br>  <br>overlord<br><br>are you 13?<br><br>overlord is edgy because the mc is an overdesigned skeleton?<br><br> first world countries </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are by definition Second World countries</br>  <br>Are second world countries, which are by definition the (former now) USSR and her allies.<br><br>Dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm having a lot of fun with both.<br>Maybe GATE though because Overlord seems to be moving along at a glacial pace.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Gonna be first world before long. America's just lying to herself</br></br></br>  <br>You need to get out of that cold war mentality, brah.</br>  <br>The terms first, second and third world were created by the US during the cold war to describe the alliances.<br>They are not objective measurements of the development of a nation.</br></br>  <br>You're the one throwing around outdated terms like "first world."</br>  <br><br><br> letting someone dictate what is good and what is bad <br><br>What a bunch of retarded sheep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. </br>  Gate for action and watching military ass-rape roman armies, Overlord for being pretty interesting and wanting to see my childhood edgy online rpg fantasies come to realization.  <br>Overlord just got past the... know what? I'll make a list I guess<br><br>Overlord<br>Pros:<br>* I love the LN and like the manga<br>* Is not being censored as retardedly as GATE<br>* Is not about NIPPON STRONK<br>* Nice character designs, even if Albedo's armor bothers me<br>* Narberal Gamma (best girl)<br>Cons:<br>* The anime is being too slow by like 3 minutes each chapter. Or perhaps 3 minutes too short per chapter. It was late by 3 minutes, then 6, and now by 9. Makes me worried about ep4 being super rushed and skipping important stuff. This may or may not be valid depending on how it turns out. Maybe they will skip the intro and ED to compensate?<br><br>Not a lot of bad things, but it is stacking up on every episode. Let's see how bad it is by the end of ep4<br><br>GATE<br>Pros<br>* They improved Rori<br>* Just getting to the parts I love the most.<br>* Decent music so far. I hope for some sweet Ride of the Valkyries<br>* I liked Rerei's outfit more than the manga's<br><br>Cons<br>* Retarded censorship means they skipped the dragon attack on the elven village. We never got to see it eat elves and villagers, will probably not get to see most of the action scenes because of that<br>* Cute-ified characters. Even the fucking empeor got a facial lift-off and looks 10 years younger. Everyone looks 10 years younger- Not as bad as moeblobs, but dangerously close<br><br>Is really too soon to tell. Must wait for ep5 of each series, apparently</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are his views? I just saw it will probably have some anti-american propaganda, but that's rather common in anime.</br>  <br>Really? I like the OVERLOR LNs more than the GATE one. Unless you are thinking of the manga</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Food, alcohol, pipe-weed. Within a century of the end of Return of the King, the world will secretly be ruled from the Shire.</br></br>  <br>I liked ep3 tho, but it was still too slow.<br><br>They should have started like the manga did, with the battle at Carne, and then do a flashback explaining how they got there</br></br></br>  Gate.<br><br>Overlord really surprised me during the first two episodes and the idea is really cool. Problem is, it gets wasted as soon as the actions start.<br><br>I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil.<br>I wanted Momonga to start a fucking kingdom not<br><br> hurr durr let's be adventurers </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Animation is also a big point. Gate &gt; Overlord on that</br>  <br> which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk <br>It's not. It's just pissed off right wing Amerifats like you who can't take it, and there's a lot.</br></br>  <br>Anime, Overlord<br>Manga wise, Gate<br>shield hero anime when?</br></br></br>  <br>Everybody is evil, I mean everyfriggin body</br>  <br>That reminds me of when someone asked "if you could be reborn in this very world right now, would you rather be reborn as a guy or a girl?" and i answered "it depends on location. Western first world country? girl. Give me easy mode on life for once. Anywhere else? guy, I dont wanna get shat on" and someone said that was retarded because women were suffering on India so why did I say life in wester 1st world countries was easy for women?<br><br> India <br> Western First World Country <br><br>Since fucking when?<br><br>China and Russia are 2nd world countries, by definition. Even if China is now the world's greatest economy, it is still a 2nd world country. Look up what 2nd world country actually means, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sebas-chan isnt</br>  <br>Im gonna assume you think "1st world" means "developed"<br><br>During the cold war, the americans and their allies thought the world was divided thus:<br><br>One side was america and its allies,<br>The other was russia and its allies<br><br>Thus, you had "two separate worlds" of politics and ideologies. 1st world, just means "america and its allies" and 2nd world just means "russia and its allies" but they were all considered modern and advanced countries to live in.<br><br>You are confusing politics with economics/sociology, and seem to think 1st world means "premium quality" or something like that. Its just a geographical and political division, that's all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is too much "how it worked in the game" sequence in Overlord for my taste.<br><br>On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. Or as anything.</br></br></br>  <br> war is hell </br>  <br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br>Gate is not manga adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Both are absolute shit.<br>But Gate &gt; Overlord.<br>MMO anime is always worst in any comparison.</br></br></br>  <br> glacial pace <br>Its about four episodes per volume, if I'm lead to believe. The first volume was heavily laden with setting shit up, getting you interested in the cast and the situation, and ended on a huge note of  lich overlord killing the fuck out of angels </br></br>  <br> GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation <br>It's not. It's just an excuse to pit /k/ against fantasy for shits and giggles and that's great. Being an idiot is alright, being pretentious as well is just obnoxious.</br></br>  <br> what if the sky is blue </br>  <br>Diplomacy &gt; all, no man left behind etc, just obnoxious nazi bullshit like that<br><br>they should just nuke those filthy savage slavers. For humanitarian reasons, you know</br></br></br>  <br> I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. <br>In the new world they are in, no one would get past the first damn floor. Even back in YGGDRASIL, 1500 players and NPCs raided Nazarick and were stopped dead at the 8th floor<br>  I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil. <br>Ainz plans to do that in the second volume, he starts working as an adventurer in an attempt to create a heroic reputation, then drop the charade and give all credit to his true identity, thus spreading the name Ainz Ooal Gown far and wide. He's not looking to be an evil tyrant, he just wants to try and find other players in the new world. Also the other countries aren't evil, they have yet to be shown that way, they have some evil people inside, usually nobles and such, but the countries themselves aren't evil</br></br></br></br>   The story begins with Yggdrasil, a popular online game <br><br> however, the protagonist Momonga decides to not log out. Momonga is then transformed into the image of a skeleton as "the most powerful wizard <br><br> Even SAO tards laugh at this </br></br></br></br>  <br> Gate <br> pretentious <br>it's like you never watched or read it</br></br></br>  <br> no mention of lelei being ruined </br>  <br>Yeah, you are right, but I wasnt weighting one against the other, I was saying what I liked and disliked of each series individually. <br>If you want a "vs" point of view, let me see<br><br>Animation Gate++ (the dragon in the dirt cloud was simple but much better than the 3D stuff in OVERLORD(<br>Music Gate+<br>History Overlord++<br>Dialogue Overlord<br>Pacing Gate++<br>Character Designs Overlord+<br><br>So lets see...<br>Gate+++ total<br>Overlord++++ total<br><br>Dialogue went to overlord but by so small a margin I didnt really gave it a +<br><br>I would say overlord is slightly better than gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is not about NIPPON STRONK <br>I do not understand why do so many people get butthurt over this.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about you, not gate. Or did you think I called gate an idiot? Come on, there's gotta be a limit to how dumb you can get.</br>  Which episode does Gate start showing the waifu's?  <br>Overlord, obviously.</br>  <br>I didnt think she was ruined. I know, shocking, right? someone has a different opnion than you!<br><br>Well, Im used to having different opinions on tastes, because tastes are like assholes. Everyone has one and thinks everyone ELSE's stinks but his.<br><br>That's why I never really go to war over "my tastes &gt; your tastes" comments. Im not saying your opinion is shit, im just saying I don't care about your taste because tastes are personal.<br><br>Maybe you don't like lemon pie.<br>I fucking love lemon pie<br><br>Would I get into an argument about lemon pie's greatness? <br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Character Designs Overlord+ <br>I disagree. Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. Meanwhile the B team working on Overlord can't decide on Albedo's proper proportions it threw me off. Also, it highlighted the bad thing about directly copying LN art.</br></br>  <br>All I know is that the MC is a fucking otaku which pretty much removes any credibility it could have had from the show.<br>You can't take it seriously if the MC is constantly surrounded by girls, is an otaku and still supposed to be some kind of soldier. It doesn't work well together.</br></br>  <br>All those things you want to happen? they all happen later in the novels. All of them</br>  <br> pretending to be above arguing taste <br> after writing that diatribe about taste <br> and already saying rori was improved <br>Of fucking course I love lemon pie, and my hand's reeked every time I've scratched my ass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People naturally recognize political agendas, but they become bothered when those agendas don't line up with their preferences or the status.</br>  <br><br>noice, no way they're gonna get animated though, right?</br></br>  <br>There are many otaku in the army anon. Hop over to /k/ and see how many answer you.<br><br>It's also not being brought up as much in the series, not like he's a hikkineet bastard.</br></br></br>  <br> Preferring a bunch of uninteresting looking human people to a cast of interesting and unique looking characters rarely presented as a main cast in an anime. </br>  <br>Might progress a chapter, maybe one and a half before it's all over at this pace.</br>  <br> shield hero anime when? <br>It has slavery, so never</br></br>  <br>It's 4 episodes per volume and the 1st volume was a glorified intro.</br>  <br>did you screw up your post?</br>  <br> Preferring well-animated tasteful designs over characters who suffer from animation deficiency due to canon material accuracy <br>Let me remind you what happened to Log Horizon<br> pic related <br>She looked so much better in S1 and that's with anime designs</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gate, better pasing, better girls, it's just better overall, it's a shame seeing how every gate thread it's ruined with amerifats</br>  <br>The anime is going to end at the end of volume 3, so in these 12-13 or so episodes we'll get<br> &gt;Ainz murdering the fuck out of angels<br> Ainz and Narberal becoming adventurers along with a group of no-names <br> Ainz and Narberal breezing through adventuring, slaughtering ogres and goblins with ease <br> Ainz and Narberal vs a necromancer and a crazy chick in a graveyard full of undead, which will include Narberal vs two skeleton dragons and Papa Bones giving someone a big warm hug <br> Spooky vampire slaughterfest <br> Ainz vs Shallchair <br> Possibly a cliffhanger concerning Ainz's plan to wipe out the Lizardmen </br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  WHEN DO THE GIRLS APPEAR IN GATE!  <br> Need to repay a debt <br> Might as well test my killing spells, too <br> I could easily resurrect the half of the village that was killed, but that would just be a hassle in the future <br><br>Truly a paragon of altruism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll take shitty animation quality over dull as fuck character designs.</br>  <br>Sebajii believes there's good, don't mean he aren't gonna wreck yer shet</br>  I havent seen gate but overlord has been good.  <br> &gt;Ainz vs Shallchair <br>never gonna make it there, parts will be skipped and rushed like there's no tomorrow</br></br>  <br> The entire climax of volume 3 <br> In the fucking intro, not even just a small glimpse, but a big chunk of animation <br> Will be the climax to the anime itself <br>You are delusional if you think they'll skip or rush over it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>...<br><br><br>you real?<br><br><br>Gate is a LN adaptation, and it was cutified to death. If you read tvtropes, I would say it was spikified to death.<br><br>Gore is 97% gone<br>Mature characters? 100% gone<br>Violence? 90% gone<br><br>The problem with that is not "hurr durr not enough blood" but that by hiding some scenes completely, they had to cut out large chunks that were actually relevant to the story.<br><br>Have you seen people on youtube and their "live reaction" videos? I honestly enjoy watching those, I think they're hilarious. All my friends are into GATE manga, so I cant expect them to surprised or anything. The youtubers... they all hate reading, so they have fresh reactions, and they are all confused as fuck over a lot of things, because they were never shown or explained in the anime<br><br>Arrow on the dragon's eye? their comment was "did that elf chick shoot out its eye?"<br><br>Rori? "Oh my god she's an apostle of a dark god! she's gonna be the villain of the series! she's just luring them into a false sense of security"<br><br>Its really fun to watch, but also a little sad. The anime is doing a very poor job of telling the story because its skipping too many bits or it in order to hide its most violent parts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mate, we get to see stuff like Cocytus vs. the lizardman chiefs, I doubt we'll get to there.</br>  <br>No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing. They're falling behind at a constant pace, so they've obviously taken a big chunk out at some point.</br>  <br>We're basically in the last part of volume 1 now, the only thing left is papa Bones chokeslamming angels and we're done with vol 1, we're getting 3 volumes at this pace.</br>  <br> No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing <br>That was what volume one was made of, majorly though. The battle at the village was near the end of the volume, and didn't involve much beyond Ainz shit stomping the soldiers and angels.</br></br>  <br>Again, I said it wasn't just a glimpse. It was a whole animated part, the reason they included Cocytus vs the lizardmen was because they needed a cool scene for him to be in, and till then he didn't have any scenes in the LNs. The anime will cover till the end of volume 3, thus it will cover Shalltear vs Ainz.</br>  <br>Hey your call man.<br><br><br>I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. If you really wanted uncensored Gate then you also better want the US getting bitchslapped every which way. You can't have one without the other. Japan did this for your own good and your ungrateful ass is complaining.<br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>I agree with the other things but this is wrong. Unless you're talking about character design, which I could give fuck all about. 18 year olds looked like 30s in Space Battleship Yamato, didn't stop me from enjoying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How did he even manage to pump strength as spooky wizard? Can players grind stats after hitting the cap in Yggdrasil?</br>  <br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>lmao.<br>Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>He's level 100 while they're like level 20, he can just punch them to death due to level difference.</br>  <br>Hes at the level cap, and even spell casters in YGGDRASIL, at level cap, had substantial strength, which translates even harder when put into the new world.</br>  <br> I disagree. Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. <br>That is true, which is why I gave Gate a ++ on animation.<br><br>Its characters ARE better animated, but that is not the same as "better designs".<br><br>The character designs in GATE are just moeblob humans, while the character designs in Overlord are interesting and unique creatures, with a few jokes thrown in that most people didnt notice.<br><br>Aura and Mare being a trap and a reverse trap makes me smirk<br>Demiurge wearing a swagger-full powersuit in a medioeval world<br>Shalltear name is basically "I shall tear you apart" but people don't seem to notice.<br><br>Plus, they are all "evil guys" which you usually don't get to see as the protagonists of anything. It reminds me of playing Dungeon Keeper and thats a big plus on my book<br><br>So I really have to give Overlord the edge on character designs.<br><br>You want to say "oh but they are better ANIMATED in Gate"? I agree, but that's animation, not character designs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation. <br>Would have saved it even more if they animated soldier dialog with more kyaaaaa and naniiiiii comedic reactions. Instead we get happy soldier banter which none of our non-/k/ friends get and call it boring.</br></br>  <br>Because it breaks my suspension of disbelief too hard. And this comes from a fantasy novels author</br>  <br>Man if only character designs were animated well too.<br><br>I brought up Log Horizon by DEEN in another post which proves my point. It doesn't matter to me if the design in the adaptation has been taken artistic liberty with, all it matters to me is that it moves seamlessly.<br><br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime yet the animation might as well be stickmen in a flipbook. That's just how I roll.<br><br>I also didn't agree with dialog going to Overlord fwiw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you can't believe that japanese soldiers can't be competent and americans can be villains?<br>widen your worldview fatty</br></br>  <br>That sounds like a bullshit excuse to me anon.</br>  I feel like the two of them are completely different in themes but share a common design with the "Fantasy world" thing.<br><br>But both of them are looking like solid contenders for AOTS so far. I'll enjoy both.</br></br>  <br>3<br><br>I am saying "I like Rori" and also "but my taste is mine and yours is yours, and im not going to argue about my preferences being better than yours or yours being better than mine, because there is no such thing as better when it comes to taste"<br><br>Hell, I enjoy classic music, and still havent gotten over a punk kid going into my hobby shop, buying a manga and asking me with a straight face "aren't you ashamed of listening to fag american music?" while I was playing some Mozart on the audio system.<br><br>He enjoyed rap<br><br>I like Rori. You dont like Rori? ask me if I care<br>But I can say "I like X" and also say "I dont care enough to argue over it" in the same post<br><br>Im not arguing about if X character is better or not, btw, im arguing that, indeed, i dont argue about "my tastes are better".<br><br>You like red soda? i like green soda. Am I gonna argue about which one is superior? no<br><br> Implying green soda isnt so much better <br><br>That was a joke, btw. Im explaining that because you dont seem very fast or very good at reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime<br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br> calling Overlord an SAO clone because there was kinda sort of a MMO setting in the first act and never again <br><br>god I hate this meme</br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying it's not? Top tier aesthetics and character designs, all larger than life<br><br>The villains shtick you praise Overlord for, One Piece already did for 19 years.</br></br></br>  <br> another wall of text <br>hope you proofread it, because no one else will bother slugging through it</br></br>  <br> wall of text <br>Best be trolling.</br></br>  <br>One Piece... really? well, they're at least original, I'll give you that.<br><br>And about moving seamlessly... are you watching the RAWs? because I am, and they move fine. If you are watching it on Funimation, you should know that Funi fucked up the drame rate and Overlord looks like shit through them, and through the groups that ripped their eps from them.<br><br>Check out the episodes you saw. Do they say "Funimation" at the beginning? if so, go and watch the RAWs. They look so much better on that sense.<br><br>But the reason im giving the animation point to gate is because while watching both RAWs, I just think the 3D in overlord doesnot blend seamlessly enough with the traditional style.<br><br>The staff of Ainz Oal Gown bothers me a lot. It clearly stands out of place. The Death Knight blended in nicely, though, so maybe it was on purpose to make its power stand out? if that's the case, it was a decision I would have voted no against.<br><br>But seriously, see if the eps you watched have "funimation" at the beginning. Funi is fucking overlord, big time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hey<br><br>you<br><br>stop<br><br><br>it<br><br>every<br><br>word<br><br>doesn't need<br><br>its<br><br>own <br>line</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>All I see is "I have no arguments so now I will fling shit and hope you give up and go away"</br></br></br>  <br>You still watch Pokemon, do you?</br>  <br>Idiot confusing evil alignments with Chaotic Stupid. Evil characters are not suddenly barred from committing acts that aren't genocide.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>You did say Overlord had interesting and unique creatures which is the point of One Piece character designs. And they're also original as fuck even if you don't like it.<br><br>I do watch both RAW and Funimation. I'd still give animation to Gate.<br><br>Now, what's the reason you give dialog to Overlord as well? I didn't think it was any different to most light novels out there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, apparently we are getting up to volume 4 and those things happen from volume 5 of the light novel and onward.Maybe a 2nd season?<br><br>In b4<br> madhouse <br> 2nd season <br>jokes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad to see you fixed your enter key.</br>  <br>they already did</br>  One is about Papa Bones<br><br>The other isn't</br></br>  <br>Why not both? <br>It's not like your time is valuable anyway.</br></br>  <br> I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. <br><br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br> Gate is not manga adaptation. <br><br>Because gate IS an adaptation, and your post made it look like you did not know the LN or the manga already exist.<br><br>Someone else said "Gate failed as an adaptation"<br>You said "Gate is not an adaptation"<br><br>It comes from either the LN or the manga (I would say the LN) but either way, its an adaptation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for your own good <br>Im Chilean, I dont give a fuck if USA gets bitchslapped.

I don't see why they would have any reason to hide it. It's not like I'll kill her right away.</br>  <br><br> &gt;But one of them is bitten and you don't know who <br><br>That's why everytime someones enters the hideout we conduct a full body inspection.</br></br></br></br>  I love this series, but the constant generals now that the anime has started are really getting bad.  <br>It was inevitable. And we can't even blame the animefags for this one, we've gone full Kancolle.</br>  <br>You should expect it, since we've already discussed all there is to discuss. There's nothing left to do but waifupost until next episode / chapter.</br>  <br>The next chapter comes a day after the next episode, so there'll be a lot of good discussion then.</br>  <br>MII-KUN BEST GIRL</br>  <br>in what magazine Gakkou Gurashi is sterilized?</br>  <br>I started reading the manga after the first episode, realizing the art and direction isn't very good in the adaption.<br>Looking forward to the next chapter, but what I don't get is how rushed the story is, its my 1 criticism of this series, they just jump between events instead of looking into them more deeply.<br>I just think it would be good if they took the development a bit slower.</br></br></br>  <br> sterilized </br>  <br>They're doing that in the anime already.</br>  <br>Manga Time Kirara Forward.</br>  <br/>  <br>YOU HAVE IMPECCABLE TASTE BROTHER</br>  <br>oh.</br>  <br> sterilized <br>I legit loled.

This shit is pretty damn dark.<br><br>I also agree with OP, Megu-nee is best girl.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Best girl wouldn't bite one of her students.</br>  <br>Well, she  was </br>  <br><br>Best girl wouldn't have kept the bunker secret.</br></br>  Who will survive to the end?  <br>She was waiting for it to be safe to go down there.

That's true!<br><br><br>THANK YOU!<br><br>I was trying to figure out if the kid was real, but I was positive the kid wasn't, but I couldn't understand why they were treating it as physically being there despite not treating Megu-nee the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They acknowledged Megu-nee plenty of times.</br>  <br>in case you want proof</br>  <br>I don't see any short haired Megu-nee?<br>could you provide a pic?</br></br>  Are any males still alive in Gakkou Gurashi?  <br>Because she is the most realistically portrayed.  Like any 2D character, she isn't real. </br>  <br>They're all crazed rapists now.</br>  <br>Yes, crossbow-kun and the biker bros. Pilot-kun was alive for a bit</br>  <br>I don't remember when, but it was at the start where it appears Kurumi is angry when asked to wait for Megu-nee. That basically spelled it out for me.<br><br><br>I thought the screaming scene was the one that gave it away. I didn't realize those things were ears, I thought it was a weird shadow or she was clutching a corpse or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Replying to a tripfag. </br>  <br>What actually killed Pilot-kun? He just kind of randomly got infected.</br>  <br>Please go away. You are fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Did someone request the return of Los Gurachos?</br>  <br>I wanna save Yuuri and adopt a loli and live the rest of my life away in a cabin far away with my new family.</br>  <br>He was already infected and relapsed. It's implied that the serum isn't a permanent fix and needs to be re-applied. Kurumi's next.<br>Also </br></br>    <br>Also what happened to Radio-chan. That's why she turned despite there not being any footprints on the roof, meaning she hasn't gone outside in a while.</br>  Soon  <br>Well, Pilot-kun's friends are still alive so there's them as well.</br>  <br>Well I got that it's implied that the serum isn't a permanent fix as per the recent, but did not get that he had been infected already.<br><br><br>There's no question about him being infected. I was just wondering how he got infected. This scene was the foreshadowing of what we later start to discover with Kurumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So anyone?<br>What is your excuse?</br></br>  <br> There's no question about him being infected. I was just wondering how he got infected. This scene was the foreshadowing of what we later start to discover with Kurumi. <br>Fucker got bit.

I'm under the assumption that she stopped and is just pretending, which is why everybody thinks she's more mature.    <br>Do you really need that spelled out for you?</br>  <br> nah the delusion completely broke when Yuki killed a zombie </br>  <br>He thinks a helicopter is a plane, so he's probably retarded</br>  <br>It also disappeared when she finally said good-bye to Megu-nee.</br>  <br>How stupid can people be? This entire scene was the closing to Yuki's delusional arc. Notice how she's repeating the same monologue from Chapter 1, but this time she's seeing the rooms how they really are.<br><br>She's no longer delusional and is faking Megu-nee. He delusions started cracking around chapter 16 or so and she may have been faking Megu-nee as early as chapter 20.</br></br></br>  <br>A HEART OF BROKEN GLASS, DEFILED</br>    <br>Poor Yuki.<br><br>Though I honestly want to know how shit got so ruined so quickly.

It doesn't break any revolutionary new ground in the anime medium. Nor is the writing the pinnacle of storytelling. It's just fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why so much Ange x Hilda shipping? <br><br>It's called "yuri baiting".</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's basically the same from Seed.</br></br>  <br><br>This shit needs to be uploaded so I can jack off to it. Vanilla sex scenes are literally my fetish, and I've been waiting months for this shit, since the show ended and Fukuda tweeted out some lewd sketches of the addded animation to build hype for his shitty show.</br></br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3909015307<wbr>?fr=frs<br><br>FUCKING MAIDOH WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>Fukuda is literally bonkers.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>The thing I liked about cross ange, compared to all the other 'strong female' shows out there, was how it pointed out that the heroes were basically just horny teenagers &amp; all their decisions stemmed from that. Everybody was fucked up &amp; petty, and the creators knew it</br>  <br> Somehow japan's softcore animated porn does feminism better than all the serious western dramas <br><br> Don't forget, of course Miyazaki movies. <br><br>The difference between the works mentioned in these two posts and a lot of modern western attempts at feminism is that the Japanese ones don't heavy-handedly attempt to shove messages down your throat.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>muh dick</br>  <br><br><br>Of all the things they could add in, the maid watching them pork is the last thing I would ever consider. What the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>It's perfect.</br>  <br>to be serious, I think the problem is western media will miss the original point but go ahead anyways, kinda like how tumblr feminists are known for being racist.<br>The japanese shows aren't trying as hard to sell you anything (besides BDs and figurines), so the mixed messaging is less annoying. Gintama is the worst, but it's so constant and self-contradictory that it's pretty much like the morals at the end of every south park episode</br></br>  <br>LOL</br>  <br><br>Better image.</br></br>  <br>I love you so much, Top Meido.</br>  <br><br>Hopefully momoka finds herself a nice meaty cock for herself too.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I can't stop laughing at this. Like, they all got together to discuss what to add in the BD and Fukuda was like "Momoka is there watching. It's very important."<br><br>I hope a based Nipponer uploads it soon so we can see what other insane shit Fukuda cooked up for us.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Forgot image.</br></br>  <br><br>It's a hilarious situation where a bunch of horny men can make compelling stories with independent and a strong women and they weren't even fucking trying, and the West has text adventures made my lunatics.</br></br>  <br>Juli 30, so just in time.</br>  <br><br> TOP MAID watching them fuck hard </br></br>  <br>*July</br>  <br><br> tfw not many people will see this since it's the BDs and no one really goes back to translate them or upload the raws <br><br>This shit would have broken the board when it happened live.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I really liked analogue &amp; hate story+ though <br>was it true that the seiyuu had a shitty time working on the show? That's been the one thing bugging me, since I loved everything else about this show</br></br>  <br><br>Probably. Fukuda is a moron who can't stop his fixation with Space Jesus. I'm sure it bleeds into his daily interactions.</br></br>  <br> That Ange's hand grabbing Hilda's ass. Damn. I miss this show so much. </br>  <br>Thanks, phone.</br>  <br>it's a shame that most of the other things reused the cover art for the BDs.</br>    <br><br>I hope these illustrations will be in the art-book. The chara-design is nothing extraordinary, but it's really classy and sexy.<br><br><br>There were people in CA threads saying Momoka was watching them fucking from the shadows. Guess they were right about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OP give you a link you can see there</br>  <br><br>http://a.pomf.se/ktpnbo.webm<br>Based Fukuda does it again.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay I take back all my complaints the new sex scene is worth every second.</br>  <br>I'll admit I didn't notice that.</br>   tfw checking all night for the raw <br><br>Guess I'll just go to sleep. Fuck.</br></br>  <br> Okawara: I did design work on SEED and SEED DESTINY, and [director Mitsuo] Fukuda likes those kinds of designs. Apparently he decided that he wanted designs that his son, who was in 5th or 6th grade, would call “cool.” </br>  <br>Based top meido.</br>  I think Fukuda wants his MC to get laid just like Kira but since she is a girl people will call her a slut so he gives lesbian as another option while Ange still can get laid with guy.  <br>wut</br>  <br>It's time to stop posting on the internet for today, anon.</br>  <br><br>It's because Japan doesn't have the silly American idea that women aren't allowed in nerd hobbies. This lead to competent men working on stuff for girls and to competent women being encouraged to work in the industry, 40 years later we are like this.<br>On the other hand, american "nerd hobbies" have been boys only club to which women answered by swinging too much in the other direction (and, of course, these women who swung are extremely politicized and a niche, meaning that the talented ones will be doing something else).</br></br></br>  <br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br>  <br>This is fucking hilarious.</br>  <br>What the fuck am I reading here?</br>  Quick, someone post the half-open relationship edit.    <br>How the hell did this show managed to be popular?<br>It's like /pol/+Kampfer incarnate.</br></br>  <br>People hoping for a repeat of Geass Sundays.</br>  <br>It didn't though</br>  <br>Define popular.</br>  <br> 2 sons <br>i think Tusk wants four children</br></br>  <br>What Tusk wants doesn't get.</br>  <br> that Ange <br>Stupid sexy Ange.<br>If only the quality was that nice all through out the show.</br></br></br>  <br> dem Ange covers <br> that fucking Ange x Hilda cover <br>Sweet Lord Jesus Christ.</br></br></br>  <br> Cross Ange <br> popular  <br><br>Salia crying at that corny french movie can't be a better representation of Cross Ange's reception by the anime community at large: no one gave a shit about it, but the only one who liked it was moved to tears.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> scans never <br>Its so hard when you like a show almost no one likes.</br></br></br>  <br>If they were going to make Ange straight I really wish they'd just leave the yuri-baiting out.</br>  <br><br>I find this smile creepy and unsettling.<br><br>What the fuck is wrong with Momoka?</br></br></br></br>  <br>YukaNana faggots and /u/ have large wallets.</br>  <br>That what happens to you when you're super loyal to a person.</br>  <br> people thinking /u/ had any interest in CA <br><br><br>We all know she wanted Ange to herself but was constrained by her dedication to being toppo meido. I feel like their children are going to be picked off one by one by people who had unrequited crushes on them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's ironic how /u/ hates a show with an actual lesbian couple, one which not only survived to the end but it got a happy ending together.</br>  I had fun watching this with you /a/.  <br>/u/ hates everything. But most also dropped it long before it was confirmed Chris and Rosalie would get a good end.<br><br>Now, the game...</br></br></br>  <br>More like this is only fun when you watched it with /a/.<br>God, I miss Cross Ange airing threads.<br> I miss the Nanafagging every week. </br></br></br>  <br>There's retards everywhere. There was more lesbians in CA than in most so-called yuri anime. Besides, the people I discuss the game with on the game thread don't hate it, they just hate Fukuda for fucking up the anime.</br>  While I don't dislike Tusk and I don't really like yuri, my favorite pairing would be Ange and Hilda. Their bromance was awesome and I think they could work as a couple.  <br> Fukuda ruins everything. </br>  <br><br>I don't know what to think. <br>You can argue that Fukuda fucked up the anime, but without him probably we wouldn't have get it in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>I really fucking wish Nana just wrote this shit instead of Fukuda.<br>Maybe it will be better.</br></br>  <br> There was more lesbians in CA than in most so-called yuri anime. <br><br>See, they're not gonna be satisfied unless the main girl was /u/. <br><br>They hated the show because Ange turned out to want Tusk's dick, even though the show has other dykes. <br><br>Which I guess is a good thing. That means they can go back to their containment board.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I enjoyed this for the /u/ blue-balling.   you will never watch Cross Ange with /a/ for the first time again   <br>It indeed was glorious.</br>  <br>Even with /a/ it wasn't good or fun. <br>A 14 years old kid could have written a better history.</br></br>  <br>No, they hated the show because of how terrible Tusk's character was and that Ange still wanted his dick.</br>  <br>He should have just stayed producer, and not decided to take the place of the director, scriptwriter and story-boarder. Because everything work in the game, and he wasn't involved in it.</br>  <br>And the yuri baiting. The yuri baiting was pretty shit.</br>  <br> everything work in the game <br>How so?</br></br>  <br>It was fun watching it with /a/, we literally just laughed at the whole series even if it tried to take itself seriously at times.<br>Maybe you took this show too seriously.</br></br>  What does a nude Ange feel like?  <br>The game doesn't spend time on useless shit, focus on the story and characters, and made Tusk likeable. And Hilda doesn't become a whiny dyke with an unrequited love in the second part, instead she becomes a great captain.</br>  <br> And finally gets someone to eat her apple pie. </br>  <br>How did the routes go in that? I only saw the one where Hilda makes you a pie.</br>  AOTY forever/.<br><br>Oh how I miss Cross Ange. I think I enjoyed it so much that I won't ever get an anime high like that ever again in the same way.</br></br>   none of the Japanese are uploading ep22  <br>Fucking what the fuck man?</br>   First cour <br><br>Mysterious and fabulous mastermind.

I mean, having a person watching other people have sex is a staple of porn plots. Doujin artists just need to have her join in at some point.</br>  <br>I'm still doing the Ersha one. If everything goes as planned, Naomi should run away with Salia and co in the next chapters. And finally, I'll be able to hear Embryo-kun bullshitting all day.</br>  <br> Mii watched too </br>  <br>But people don't write doujins because it's already full of soft core porn.</br>  TWELVE HOURS  <br>But people wrote doujinshi for Tsukihime and Fate</br>  <br>But people also actually watched those.</br>   When she said they had sex for 12 hours when they fell alseep and then came back to rest and <br> She watched them every step of the way <br> She probably masturbated or at least got wet <br> Or maybe just the thought of Ange breeding with someone she loves was enough for her <br><br>Holy shit how does fukada do it? This guy is amazing regarding surprises. That one scene has enhanced my enjoyment even more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They should have kept this in the anime, the fucks.</br>  <br>I think it was only added after.</br>  Would you /a/?

I can hear the characters saying shit like 'covenant' and 'spartan' but it's never in the subs.  <br>The one where Sarah had to babysit 3 ODSTs on that profit kill mission.</br>  Did she fug the Master Chief?  <br><br> She's <br> Is <br>Should be<br> she was <br> was <br><br>  ;_;  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It needs a VN.</br>  <br>fuck yall <br><br>prototype<br>odd one out <br>homecoming<br>origins<br>duel</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best episode.</br>  <br>all else was shity</br>  <br>You're not the only one, who wouldn't want giant Spartan waifu?<br><br><br>No idea who'd be best but for some reason UBD, Trigger, and Studio Bones comes to mind.<br><br><br>Commissar Cain VN could be interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Prototype and Babysitter were pretty great, and really should have been the standard for what was given; everything else was either pretty iffy or downright terrible.<br><br>Odd One Out is given some leeway as its was successfully comedic. Homecoming was alright, with the Spirit of Fire themed clone death serving as a highlight.</br></br></br>  <br><br> People actually liked odd one out <br><br>Jesus, I dropped it like 3 minutes in.</br></br></br></br>  <br> people not having a sense of humor <br><br>dude, not everything has to be supper serious.</br></br></br>  I really liked how this series and the Animatrix worked. A shame about the quality disparity between the studios and their respective episodes.  <br>Eh, I like how Toei just said "Fuck the lore we're going our own way." With it, that was a lot of fun to see.</br>  <br> given some leeway <br> this automatically means I liked it <br><br>It was humorous, but I would have greatly preferred something else. And people enjoy different things, dude.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Commissar Cain VN <br>Fund it.</br></br>  <br>Trigger would probably add huge dices rolling out of nowhere and have the characters move just like models.</br>  <br>I could see them having the psyker try to do something only for everything to freeze and a roll list for psychic phenomena from one of the RPGs popping up to show what awfulness is about to happen.</br>   Take the shot. <br> Anon now! <br> You're the only one that can do it. </br></br>  <br>Here anon, I got a better quality version of that pic for you.</br>  <br> mfw Cal-141 is Griffith </br>  <br>Fucking annoying ODST betafaggot lost himself a good waifu</br>  <br> Reminder that every Spartans II are genetically super humans. </br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure that you can get court marshaled if you get a spartan killed <br>So I like to think as soon as he got on the ship to get out, they threw his ass in jail</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, it is her own fault she died, she intentionally took the hammer hit so that no one else on the team would die. Getting ambushed and the Spartan choosing to throw herself in the line of fire doesn't seem like much grounds for a court martial unless the team was criminally negligent in making sure they were safe in that temple.</br>  <br>They were pretty negligent. No one was covering their backs, they were just staring into the distance.

More sinister looking  <br>He should have used his ability in fight with Ichigo as fast as he could, his arrogance fucked him over.</br>  What he even do? I read Bleach a million years ago and forgot almost everything. I remember he turned into feel guy and got blown by Ichigo's usual attack. Did he even have any motivation for doing stuff  <br>He's kind of cool but I don't remember his motivation at all.</br>  <br>To bring down The Soul King as I recall.</br>  <br> antagonist </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128424644 <br>His swords ability, as i recall he only needed to use it once in front of someone to have them under his illusion any time.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128425126 <br>I'm talking about the pre captains vs Aizen fight moment, Ichigo didn't have his power up back then so he could have easily used it without getting killed.</br>  <br>Calm yourself, Momo.</br>  <br> I heard they took him out to take a walk in his chair.<br> Did they show Momo's reaction?</br></br>   This entire thread is a Hallucination.    <br>Not even close.</br>  <br>He hasn't had his flashback yet, so we still don't really know.<br>He wants to kill the Soul King and take over reality, but we don't know precisely why.<br>He, along with Urahara, seems to have seen the Soul King and/or know more about its true nature than anyone else, but that too has yet to be revealed to the readers.<br>Ichigo thinks that deep down he's just lonely because he's so strong and intelligent nobody can hold a candle to him. That's probably a key part of the story.<br><br>By the point they fought, he was evolving to the point where he wouldn't need to rely on it any more. My guess is that he was well aware of the Royal Guard's powers considering how much he seems to know about the Royal Realm and the Soul King, and he therefore anticipated that Zanpakutou abilities wouldn't likely be of much use against Nimaiya, who invented Zanpakutou, or Ouetsu, who could just take away its name and abilities.<br>Ichigo was Aizen's attempt at pushing himself to become stronger, as well as a manifestation of his desire for someone as strong as him. His goal in the fight against Ichigo wasn't just to win, which he might have been able to achieve with Kyouka Suigetsu (especially if he finished Ichigo before he could power up), his goal was to fight an opponent that would force him to break his limits and become strong enough to achieve his ultimate goal (which probably would've happened if not for Urahara's kido - even Mugetsu couldn't kill him, and he was beginning to heal)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   No     <br>God that version of him so not as loveable. But I feel like Kubo goes out of his way to make him as sex as possible. Same with both Zangetsu</br>  <br>I'd lick the hogyoku.<br>And other parts</br></br>  <br>You'd disintegrate before you even reach him.</br>  <br>Worth the try</br>  <br>tfw Ichigo will be the only one able to touch him ;_;</br>  <br>Nah<br><br><br>He was touched by him.  Unohana got to undress him though </br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128425126 <br>As it turns out, Aizen's "base form" was probably faster than Ichigo up until the dangai training. There's also the fact that many Captains can use their shikai without calling its name: in fact, that's probably how the whole "since when were you under the impression" thing came into play. Aizen released his sword during the fight with the Captains without announcing it.<br><br>Aizen was and is pretty bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Which is why we love this smug bastard.</br>  <br>Careful, Fraudrin is on your ass and he doesn't need illusions to troll the story and actually succeeded with accomplishing his goal and punking out everyone.</br>  <br>He pulled off the dork look so well that at first I didn't even realize he was the villain, though I didn't really buy that he had been killed.<br><br>It's hard to believe that anyone who knew what a Captain's spiritual pressure felt like wouldn't call bullshit. Someone would have felt something, and there'd be SOME damage to the nearby buildings that would indicate a struggle.</br></br></br>  Hey mythologyfags<br><br>Is it true that Aizen Myoo gave up his godhood for a human? I've read that only once long ago, and can't seem to find it anymore</br></br>  <br>Aizen worship thread? I'm ok with this</br>  That is Satan-sama.  <br>His flowing robes form a swastika</br>  <br>But Aizen is the Morning star, anon</br>  What would a fusion of Aizen, Zangetsu, and Jugram would look like?  <br>OH SHI-</br>  <br>But does he have tits, anon?<br><br>I don't think so.</br></br></br>  <br>It would look like Ichigo</br>  <br>FGT Ichigo?</br>  <br>Satan is the best waifu and husbando, pleb.</br>  Best looking Bleach males?  <br>It could not sustain its own presence under the weight of its own Kubo, and would ultimately vanish from our plane of existence in a puff of keikaku.<br><br>Somewhere, in that exact moment, a child would be born who would one day rule the world.</br></br></br>  <br>You called?</br>  <br>since when where you under the impression that he doesn't have</br>  It's hard to believe everything after Soul Society was done by the same author. Hueco Mundo wasn't so bad, but even that started paling in comparison to the earlier parts of the series.<br><br>I blame the anime studio honestly. He was doing pretty good until they tried to get him involved with the anime development. Then the whole series just started spinning out of control.</br></br>  <br>Is that even a question?</br>  <br>Canon and official breasts anon.<br><br>Satan's superiority remains. Everyone else is a pale shadow.</br></br></br>  <br>Something about Kubo stubble beards makes men look so much better. Yhwh looks like shit but Zangetsu is at least decently handsome. But his teen versions.</br>  <br>be gone</br>  <br>Shounen used to be so good. What happened?</br>  <br>I need more sad Aizen in my life.</br>  <br>And I need more of Aizen's full lips stretched in an arrogant smirk. I don't want to see him sad</br>  <br> defeated by mc <br> most based <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragon Ball happened.</br>  <br><br>I feel Satan is too overpowered, but I suppose that's the point.</br></br>  <br>be gone</br>  <br>He always has a shit eating grin, other emotions are great.</br>  <br> still being under the impression he's actually fucking defeated and sealed </br>  <br>does that count?</br>  <br>He's high as a kite though.</br>  <br><br>No. After all. OP question:<br> Is he the most based antagonist ever? <br><br><br>the point is that the Achilles' heel was MUH AKIRA. <br><br><br>Dragon Ball wasn't that bad first, but it got bad when the saiyans were introduced.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>never satisfied</br>  <br> being under the impression he's relevant besides teasing some of his fans <br><br>Ichigo kicked his ass. Deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br>How come Michael was such a bitch nigga</br>  <br>Why can't he be real ;_;<br><br>Byakuya is also really good looking</br></br></br>  She was an antagonist for two episodes at most. But still.  <br> Why can't he be real ;_; <br>he is in our hearts<br><br><br>no</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You got me thinking now... stubble or anything where the facial hair isn't taking over too much (like for example Starrk has) often looks better than that bushy, just-got-off-mountain look, not just when it comes to Bleach characters. Perhaps it comes kinda like a little bit of rebellion in smooth perfection.<br>Of course, Zangetsu is younger than Yhwach, while still being a developed male, so that too gives him extra points.</br></br>  <br>Michael wasn't waifu material.</br>  Akira = Ichigo.<br>Ryo/Satan = Rukia+Aizen.<br>Miki = Orihime.</br></br>  <br>Tensa Zangetsu/Teen YHWH are still cute as fuck. How they turn into that old mess is beyond me.</br>  <br>young haschwalth is best waifu</br>  <br>Shota Yhwach x shota Jugo when?</br>  <br>Because of course the Devil's weak point has to be some unremarkable fucking Japanese teenage boy that they randomly fall for.</br>  <br>boner stahp<br>add shota bazz b to the mix<br>dick is now diamonds</br></br></br>  <br><br>It wasn't random. Satan brainwashed herself to be a hormonal half-japanese teenage boy to enact her plan.

No wrong has been done by creating this thread and i highly support it by posting more delicious trap  Bump  <br>It's best when they have noble ideals and are willing to die for them. That'll get a man to question his sexuality.</br>  <br>YOUR MOM</br>  <br>From which series is that sexy beast?</br>  <br> let me google reverse image search that for you <br>We need this site.</br></br>    Bump we can't finish yet      <br>I tried to enjoy it, but when the main character does the usual harem charade of "OVER REACT TO EVERYTHING PARTICULAR GIRL DOES!!" I couldn't take it and dropped the series.</br>  <br>Wow. I am surprised reverse look up is not turning anything up. Even using the full sized image.<br><br>Is this from a fairly recent CG set?</br></br></br>  <br>iqdb gives me nothing</br>  <br>I´m curious to know if he is wearing girl´s pantsu or nothing.</br>  <br><br>魔王さまは男の娘<br><br>/yw</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Frilly boy.<br>Best trap vn producers in the industry!</br></br></br>  <br>Izana count?</br>  <br><br>Cool thanks. was about to throw it into ex to search.</br></br>    <br>Does he like men?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  So the morale of this story is that if you want a cute girl who will follow you around and willingly make you food, all you have to do it kidnap one, right? Oh, and evil space octopussies are evil.  <br>But before that, and more importantly, you must be attractive.<br><br>Remember, never be not attractive.</br></br></br>  Clearly you have to have a mech suit.  <br>And an energy weapon.</br>  There's no reason to be weaponizing tropes against this show. Relative to the industry standard, this was an inspired gem in several ways.   on episode 8 <br> literally do not care about any of these characters <br> story is fucking Tarzan <br><br>I can't believe this was going to get a second season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was off to a good start, but it started going downhill around episode 3 and didn't stop.</br>  <br>I think the more Ledo became your typical average awkward MC the more everything went to shit.<br>Oh and the "no dont kill them even though they may kill us all cause thats inhuman" bullshit</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he was too much of a moralfag for someone who was supposed to be indoctrinated by a eugenics war-orientated society. And I couldn't make it to the end, but don't they basically end up resettling on earth giving up all their technology in the process and dooming humanity to a meager existence as roaming scavengers until the sun dies?</br>  <br><br>so sad it didnt get 2nd season<br>was such a good Sci-Fi and really interesting world building</br></br></br>  <br>It was fine if you aren't from /pol/.</br>  <br>How would you have done it better?<br><br>I thought the "peaceful, primitive" life angle was played up a teeny little bit too sappy. There were at least a couple large plotholes that had to be glazed over towards the end, primarily the irrelevance of MC and feMC. And I felt that Chamber's development was rushed.<br><br>Those things aside... how can you complain? This blows Chaika and the like to Avalon and back. This was on part with SnW.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For one I would have made Ledo more hostile. Not necessarily violent, but not nearly as passive. When you've been bred for war and lived your life doing nothing but combat, why would you bow so easily to a bunch of primitives when you have a giant war machine that could kill them just by blinking? Plus the pirate leaders doing the team rocket blastoff really set the tone for the rest of the series as something that would be lighthearted when I was looking for something a bit gritter. Not grimdark, but something different than the typical anime "let's all be friends and forgive each other" bullshit.</br>  <br>I'm not from /pol/ and it wasnt fine.</br>  <br> I'm not from /pol/ <br>Homofaggot detected</br></br>  <br>Literally what is wrong with you.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much this. <br><br>By the time I finally got to the second OVA, I had to keep pausing and coming back later because it was so boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you not know what a fucking question mark is.</br>  <br>It's a joke, also known as a meme.</br>  I'd take language samples from her all day long if you know what I mean  No, is just a reminder that brown girls are the best.  <br> evil space octopussies are people <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>No, evil space octopuses are humans too</br>  <br>But when the MC vaporized all those pirates was the best scene in the entire series.</br>  <br>And I don't disagree with that</br>  REMOVE HIDEAUZE  The main morale of the show is to hire H-artists for character design over the normal ones.  <br>Truly a lesson all studios should take to heart</br>  <br>The fleet really coddled those fucking pirates beyond all reason.</br>  <br>Maybe they were the descendants of Sweden</br>    <br><br>It saddens me that more anime shows or even manga don't take up oceanic sci-fi settings like Gargantia. It was the reason why I was drawn to the show in the first place. It reminded me of Chrono Cross, which has my favorite setting in any video game ever (futuristic archipelagos).</br></br>  <br> Oh, and evil space octopussies are evil. <br>So I take it you didn't finish?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Why don't anime studios hire people like Hisashi and Hanaharu Naruko more often?<br><br>Their designs are god-tier. <br><br>What I would give for an anime with character designs by Tohzai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How hard would you fuck Melty?  <br>Would over-populate gargantia.</br>    For people saying that ledo should be more hostile, I'm pretty sure the target audience was younger groups. Also it wouldn't match the theme of the show.  <br>Just imagine an anime with Napata designs. Just imagine it.</br>  <br>Such a boner-inducing display of overwhelming firepower. I could only call it god-like.</br>  <br>Pelvis Destruction</br>  <br> I'm pretty sure the target audience was younger groups. <br>I can see that now, but when I started watching this, I went in expecting a reimaged Battlestar Galactica vibe sorta, so you can imagine my surprise and disappointment when I got a Galactica 1980 vibe instead.</br></br>  <br>Enough to make a new fleet</br>        <br>Says the mass produced squid fodder</br>  <br>I really think that they went with him because someone said "We want the audience to have an erection the entire time they're watching the show."</br>  <br>It stands to reason that h-artists are some of the best around at drawing people, since everything they do depends on their ability to draw them well.</br>  <br> since everything they do depends on their ability to draw them well. <br>Well, not necessarily. What you said obviously doesn't apply to people like Raita or Asanagi. <br><br>I think it would be more accurate to say that everything they do depends on their ability to draw people as attractive and appealing as possible. <br><br>H-artists, of course, go about doing this in different ways. Some are more niche and draw people in ways that appeal to certain fetishists, the the way Raita does. <br><br>On the other hand, people like Tohzai and Napata appeal to a more generalized crowd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> morale </br></br>  <br>Sorry, had too much Total War.</br>  <br>Oh nice, somebody adapted the old Avatar copypasta to Gargantia.</br>  <br><br>You forgot to give her butt a nice tap.</br></br>  <br> this guy is going to be genos in opm <br>That should be fun.</br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  Gargantia was garbage and a disappointment, Im glad the S2 got canned<br><br> b-but butcher was involved! <br>Still garbage. See also: Aldnoah</br></br></br>  <br>I thought they were good because they don't really have strict deadlines the way regular mangaka have. Also they seem to focus mostly on the cover, I can't count how many times I have seen an awesome cover only for it to have cheaply drawn content where it's hard to make out the details.</br>  <br>Evidently she suffers fron Stockholm syndrom</br>  Evidently there was not enough senmetsu in the entire series, that and the character designs too, however I feel that those contributing fan artist got shafted a bit  <br>Well it worked.<br><br>They senmetsu'd my dick.</br></br></br>    <br>If pinon wasnt so stupid he could have taped that ass.</br>  <br>This.<br>At least make yourself /fit/ before even bothering to kidnapping girls.<br>No girl wants to be abducted by a fatty.</br></br></br>    <br>Do girls mind being kidnapped by a skeleton?</br>  <br>How are you gonna kidnap her if you don't even have the muscles to lift her?</br>  <br>Don't remind me.</br>    <br><br>Because I actually work on my arms.</br></br>  <br>do you really have at least 18 pictures of emotional skeletons.</br>  <br>It's just  kokoro connect incident   leaking </br>  <br>This show's fatal mistake is that it made the first episode too good. <br>But seeing as OVA hints that the land people are militaristic, we might get a war in the sequel LN that will never be translated.</br></br>  <br>Maybe</br>   we'll never get to see more of this out-of-place fan character   <br>It depends.

An anime with his design could be about anything, and it would still be lewd and awesome.</br>  <br>Purist ftw.<br>I'd take mechas over girls any day of the week.</br></br>  <br>They made a game and anime with Raita's character designs.</br>  <br>I would repopulate a whole planet with just her alone.</br>  The ova was sort of dumb and lacking something, I think Chamber. Other than that I felt the plot twist to add "mainland" and some internal struggles felt sort of strange as it was clearly setting for season that wouldn't exist. I know there's supposed to be a novel but still.  <br>It's not really a twist and I'm sure they mention that land still exist back in S1. <br><br>I'm really curious to know why they canceled S2 for an LN though.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess it's the regular "not enough sales" rumba.<br><br>They didn't mention land, it was only sort of implied in the maps. They started to build the world on the last episode. It's sad, really.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and have you looked at how these Raita characters actually looked in the game and anime itself?<br><br>They look very toned down and restrained compared to the kind of shit you'd see in (say) Mahou Shoujo. Pic related is what Selvaria looks like in game. It certainly looks nothing like the "skeletons with tits" that you see in normal Raita works.<br><br>The anime is a little less restrained, but then again, the anime is generally considered to be shit (Alicia NTR, QUALITY, etc) and most people know the game more than they do the anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm disappointed that pure Rackage only existed on screen for all of 1 minute.</br>  Tomoko deserves friends and love just like you.<br><br>Why is Japan so mean?</br></br>  She brought it onto herself  Rotten garbage deserves no compassion  <br>a massively thick throbbing monster cock in a daily basis is another story though</br>  <br><br>Well Anime is fantasy where everything is cute and beatiful, but in real life Tomoko would be very ugly and you all would hate her.</br></br>  <br>It is her own fault.</br>  poor girl, fuck society  <br> Why is Japan so mean? <br>At least nobody is bullying her.</br></br>  <br>A good dicking is something we all need really.</br>  <br>I don't</br>  I've come to post twintails and discuss travel plans.<br><br>Updated a new part on the site.<br><br>Also, fuck american ruled spellchecks.

That just seems so pointless.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish, dear anon, i really do.<br><br>  "Fight me Mitsuka Souji.
