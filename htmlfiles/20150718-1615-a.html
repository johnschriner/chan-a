[  mfw no new JoJo's Bizarre Adventure coming out today.   Does anyone know if they're going to do the Diamond is Unbreakable arc?  Yes but the EoH 2.0 demo came out.  Yare Yare  <br>No. Diamond is Unanimateable.</br>  Don't know if this has been discussed already, but Jobin's Stand's name is confirmed to be Speed King<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9sG<wbr>y_-p_sVE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Oh, well that's neat. I wonder if they are going to draw any parallels between him and Yuuya.</br>  Why hasn't Araki referenced The Who yet? My favorite group isn't in Jojo.  <br> inb4 because The Who is shit </br>  Kira and Fatty confirmed for EoH<br>http://gematsu.com/2015/07/jojos-bi<wbr>zarre-adventure-eyes-heaven-adds-sh<wbr>igekiyo-akira-yoshikage<br><br><br>cool as fuck</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>And Otoishi*</br>  <br><br>And Lisa Lisa, right? Or was she already confirmed?</br></br>  <br>She was confirmed a while ago.</br>  <br> Speed King <br> Acceleration of particles produces heat <br>Heaven confirmed</br></br></br>  <br>Was already confirmed earlier, yeah.</br>  <br>Is this from the new Tanko or new chapter? <br>I'm guessing tank</br></br>    <br> STILL only one character for parts 5-8 </br>  <br>They're obviously going sequentially and Diego was only revealed because he's a big new addition and a highlight. They'll get there.</br>  <br>No. They're not sure if it's happening yet.</br>  Part 4 will probably be a OVA.  <br>Tank, chapter is sunday.</br>  <br>I wonder if any of you weeb fucks even listened to this type of music before Jojo introduced it to you</br>  <br>I thought OVA's sold like shit nowadays or something</br>  <br>I dunno. Maybe? But its Jojo so don't worry.</br>  <br>A niche band, Deep Purple.</br>  <br>I thought Bohemian Rhapsody was two different songs before reading Part 6. The "Mama just killed a man" part and the "Galileo, Galileo" part.</br>  <br> Fatty <br>disgusting<br> Yoshikage Kira as himself <br> Otoishi <br>pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bohemian Rhapsody is way too fucking overpowered.</br>  <br><br>So after finishing with Stardust i went on and saw the newer mangas, i was kinda dissapointed. <br><br>Why did the author decided to go from ultramasculine men to effeminate bishounens?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>fucking christ</br></br>  <br>Most of us knew some of these songs seperately<br>If anything, I'm proud JoJo's is getting me introduced into bands and musics which I never really payed attention to, like The Cars and King Nothing</br></br>  <br>I was very obviously being sarcastic with the niche comment, Anon.<br><br>Blackmore is one of the GOAT guitarists.</br></br></br>  <br><br> 2015 <br> Liking a shitty guitar player that played in a band that was popular when your dad was a kid. </br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Not liking a shitty guitar player that played in a band that was popular when your dad was a kid. </br></br>  I read it as <br> mfw new JoJo's Bizarre Adventure coming out today <br>I read it again, and was dissapointed</br></br>  what happens?  <br>Valentine dies.<br><br>With Love Train? Who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing beyond some rumors and hints. We probably won't hear anything confirmed till Christmas.</br>  <br>His hair looks like something done in paint</br>      <br>Looked worse in the manga.</br>   yfw   EoH doesn't have a western release   <br>but even without love train, he was able to fragment people of himself into the other dimension just by pouring water on himself.<br><br>He side crossing dimensions has no effect on him. So would creams dimensional transport?</br></br></br>  <br>Cream just disintegrates people with its mouth.</br>    JJBA is shit  <br>funny meme</br>  <br> JoJo anime part 4 comes out <br> someone subs it with Duwang </br></br>  <br>But it was already trademarked in EU.</br>  <br>There was Duwang subs for some of the Phantom Blood anime and SC anime</br>  <br>All the Duwang subs are seriously unfunny.</br>  <br><br><br><br>well it will still cut his limbs anyways</br></br></br></br>  <br>no it just brings you into another Dimension. He literally calls his power "my dark dimension. Hes just displacing everything he touches into another dimension forcibly. <br><br>The quote he literally says is "I scatter you piece by piece across my dark dimension." So imagine as his little orb is hitting you more of you is cut out of his dimension and sent the other. That'd kill you because a piece of you is not with the main body here.<br><br>However Valentine is not affected by this, as shown with the water trick where he put the middle his face into another dimension and wasn't harmed at all, crossing dimensions doesn't hurt him at all because of D4C.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Diego doing the Anaconda pose on the American flag?</br>  Which part has the best stands?  <br>Eh, It's arguable. I would probably say part 6, personally.</br>  <br>I'm only part way through Stone Ocean, but for me it'd be Vento Aureo, though King Crimson is a confusing son of a bitch</br>  <br><br>Duwang is lightning in a bottle.</br></br>  Why is she best Jojo?  <br>Worm :^)</br>  <br>She's to impure to be a JoJo.</br>  <br>I'll have to go with Vento.</br>  <br> you will never get to feel jolyne's jojos </br>  <br>Why couldn't Araki draw her like that for part 6</br>  <br> introduced masturbating in a jail cell <br> has been involved in gangs and crime since adolescence <br> dated a dirty coward who framed her for a crime she didn't commit <br> divorced parents <br> spoils the Sixth Sense to the others watching during Jail House Lock <br> gets killed by a gay priest <br> fails to save the universe, but DOES save an eleven year old kid <br> that kid kills gay priest <br><br>Yeah, Jolyne is a pretty shitty JoJo. She only gets brownie points for being a woman everyone wants to have sex with, which only serves to make her even more vile and disgusting.<br><br><br>See my point?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you one of those faggots? Had no idea, just kill yourself, enjoy your shitty music.</br>  I don't understand Purple Haze Distortion, could Fugo control it? And what was his power, the fact that if he lost control all the spheres would burst and the virus would kill itself, so he could only break one at a time?  <br>I was in Tokyo and Osaka when Stardust Crusaders was airing. They had sections of stores just dedicated to JoJo merchandise and figmas, and on the Saturday following an aired episode every figma shop in Akihabara and Denden would be selling figmas of the "stand-user of the week" and they'd have mini events.<br><br>based on that, I'd say yeah, we'll get Part 4. The blurays might sell like shit, the dvds might sell like crap but holy hell they're probs making tons on merchandise sales.</br></br></br>  <br>My main problem with Part 6 is that it was a complete low-point in Araki's career in terms of how he drew faces. He was horrible at them here.</br>  <br>His power was being so OP he got written out of the manga.</br>  <br>I'm talking about PHD, not the regular PH. Haven't you read the novel?</br>  <br>symbolism. it's just to signify how fucked up he is</br>  <br> reading light novels </br>  <br>Purple Haze Feedback is more like a regular if short novel<br><br>I never understood the use of "light"</br></br></br>  <br>JARE JARE</br>  Does anyone have that 10000x10000 picture of kakyoin?    <br>Aspect ratio was wrong, this one should be fine.</br>  <br>I started listening to Oingo Boingo and Kraftwerk because of Jojo.<br>  They are now my favorite bands  </br></br>  <br>kraftwerk's songs are just too long AND repetitive, I can only take one of them<br><br>and oingo boingo only had that hit songs Dead Man's Party, they're terrible otherwise</br></br></br>  <br>The unsung hero of Part 8</br>  At any and all ages, Joseph is Love. Joseph is Life  <br>It's a new one but the one I was looking for was him in the cave laughing</br>    <br>I just want Araki to finish Jojo and start working on a professional beetle fighting manga.</br>    <br>do a 10000x10000 quality DIO</br>  <br> One of the things that got me into Jojo was that shit was named after my favorite dad rock songs. </br>  <br>Thanks,Doc.</br>  <br>I would read that too anon.</br>    <br><br>Because its not the 80's anymore. Araki's artstyle is now truly his own.</br></br>  Am I the only fag that downloaded Jojo's Bizarre OST from nyaa?  <br>cute</br>  <br><br>Purple Haze Distortion can cancel any virus with the use of other viruses. So Fugo can selectively infect people by healing people he wants to keep alive.</br></br>  <br>nice, didn't pick up he can heal now too</br>  <br><br>He can only heal viruses. And I used "healing" too loosely, he basically just gets rid of viruses by cancelling them out. So if you had a virus, he could infect you with another and have them both destroy each other.</br></br>  <br>Arakis artstyle peaked mid to late Part 4, but it was a good peak.</br>  <br>clearly it picked up in late part 7, my favorite characters were johnny, long-haired johnny and girl johnny</br>  <br>I'd say there was two peaks for his artstyle, one at the end of Part 3 for when everyone was muscular, and on at the end of Part 4 when everyone was more realistic bodywise but not all skinny twinks. I remember Jotaro being kind of bulky at the end of Part 4, but not super skinny like he is now.</br>  <br><br>Suck my dick. I was a hipster before I was ever a weeb.</br></br>  <br>If they don't add weather report i'm going to be mad. They added fucking Fugo in ASB and not him.</br>  <br>I think you mean Gyro, lame legs Gyro, and girl Gyro</br>  <br><br><br> Tfw not alone <br><br>I loved every Vento stand except Soft Machine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking Fugo after PHF </br>  <br><br>Part 5: Risotto Nero, Trish, Ice Skates guy<br>Part 6: FF, Weather Report, Guess, Dio's idiot sons<br>Part 7: Hot Pants, Wekapipo, Sandman, Mike O, Mandom<br>Part 8: Nobody really has a punchghost, maybe once we know about Karera, Josefumi, and the brothers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even baby face?</br>  <br>I don't remember that page and I've seen it posted a lot.</br>  <br>It was super random and weird, at the end of the soft machine fight.</br>  <br>White Album would be so much fun to play<br>also lol guess would be fucking shit</br></br>  <br> risotto  <br> making it in the game <br>His stand is too weird and overkill,how are you even going to play him?</br></br></br>  <br><br>You gotta do a victory dance to assert dominance. Have you never been in an Italian gang?</br></br>  <br>Not them, but I thought Baby Face was quite cool, except from the design</br>  <br> Italian <br>Judging by West Side Story, shit's standard for ALL gangs</br></br>   Jotaro has special quotes against Jonathan in EoH <br>Niceu. Will all the Joestars have special quotes against each other? Because that would be pretty dope.</br>  <br> literally defies every single rule about stand  <br>Just what the fuck araki</br></br>  <br>Don't knock it, it helped in the PMMM crossover by BeefSkellington.</br>  <br>I can imagine it, especially something like Joseph and Josuke</br>  <br>oh lol, you haven't seen many ASB videos, because EVERY CHARACTER had a quote for every character, and a taunt to josuke's hair, and a line joseph could predict</br>  <br>Pinball Wizard would be an awesome stand name. So would Baba O'Riley. Its power would be to not get fooled again. Don't get fooled again. No, no.</br>  <br><br>Guess would be hilarious. Turning people into tiny little dolls would be a giggle m8.</br></br>  <br>We meant a pre-fight line</br>  <br>Same thing for Dio's bastards.<br><br>Rykiel could be done with some creativity but I don't see how they could make Bohemian Rhapsody and Under World fit into a fighting game. If there's any new villain characters from part 6, it'll probably be Westwood and Kenzou since they're more physical fighters.</br></br></br>  <br>ASB too had special pre-fight lines</br>  <br> that one chapter where araki said fuck it I'll make a stand with a power level based off its rape victim </br>  <br>Under World can fit as a punch ghost with the user pulling stuff from the ground, Bohemian Rhapsody can't. Rykiel would be pretty fun to fight as.</br>  <br>How about the Highway to Hell guy? You just have to spend the whole fight trying to utilize stage hazards to commit suicide with.</br>  <br>I was so mad when Josuke only had unique dialogue with Oldseph, but hopefully we can mess around with what teams we can build.<br><br> You know what to do, Doc. </br></br></br>  <br>I think from part 5 Secco and Ciocolatta could also fit well in the game since the stages have higher and lower areas for Green Day and they're an easy tag-team.</br>  <br> 128219046 <br>not every character had a special line for every character, for example Ceasar and Dio</br></br>  <br>Ya that would actually be a perfect addition, or at the very least have a stage based around ciocolatta.</br>  <br><br> Specifically requires blood sample from the target <br> Needs to be incubated inside a woman <br> Learns like he's Johnny Number 5 or some shit <br> justfuckmystandup.jpeg <br><br>Okay him and Soft Machine sucked, but the others were pure shenanigans. Notorious BIG becoming a Bermuda Triangle unto itself had me in stitches.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, we know.<br>But Jotaro didn't have one with Jonathan. Just sayin' it would be cool if every Jojo had them with each other.<br><br>Like, have Giorno talk shit to Johnny and stuff like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Gee Emporio, how come Big Sis lets you have two stands? </br></br>  What would sex pistols requiem be like?  <br>It would erase the number 4 from existence.</br>  <br>ok<br>(salad captcha)</br></br>  <br>Bohemian Rhapsody maybe could kinda work like a puppet character where Ungalo can sic the Mother Goat on enemies and shit.<br><br>Nevermind, it's fucking dumb, and N'doul kinda does that gimmick already, anyway.</br></br></br>  Hot pants in EoH when  <br> and a taunt to josuke's hair, and a line joseph could predict <br> Why did you style your hair like that? it's a disgrace to have you as my future son! Your next line will be "What the Fuck did you say about my hair!" . </br></br>  <br><br>It looks at your achievements/trophies and looks at what games you've played and randomly summons a character from it.<br><br>You control Rykiel's floating cocks with the Playstation Camera/  Xbox Kinect  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Bigger chances than Wekapipo and Mike O.</br>  How would Hermit Purple Requiem work?  <br>She's in but  in a menu .</br>  <br> It looks at your achievements/trophies and looks at what games you've played and randomly summons a character from it. <br>Oh, that could be nice.<br>Or maybe Deadpool it up and make the HUD attack or something.<br><br> You control Rykiel's floating cocks with the Playstation Camera/ Xbox Kinect  <br>Why</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT IGGY AND KOICHI ARE LOADING ICONS DECON-FUCKING-FIRMED<br><br>Unless she's a talking head somewhere, she may still be in.</br></br></br>  <br>Omnipotence</br>  If there isn't a stand introduced in part 8 called "A Farewell to Kings", I'm gonna be so fucking upset  <br>Adultery is now undetectable</br>   tfw nobody that matters dies in part 4 so there won't be any meme spoilers   <br><br>Or Street King Immortal by 50 Cent<br><br>It's all up to Hato now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rohan, then not actually</br>  <br><br> I haven't read part 5 </br></br>  <br>Koichi was a loading icon in ASB, though.</br>  <br>I have though</br>  <br>Tell them Joseph is a senile old man. That'll be as bad as him dying to the animeonlys.</br>  <br><br>As was Iggy.</br></br>   Killer Queen <br> King Diamond <br> Prince - Soft &amp; Wet <br><br>dont COUNT ON IT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What was the line</br>  <br>My moon sucks but he clearly says "Jonassan".</br>  <br>Hold on, I'm confused. Was that guy saying Koichi and Iggy were deconfirmed as characters, or deconfirmed as loading icons?</br>  <br>lmfaoooooo</br>  <br>He was being ironic.</br>  <br> implying <br>Just yesterday an animeonly got butthurt because i spoilt him rohan and the entire cast dying</br></br>  <br>Something along the lines of "Jonathan Joestar, it's an honor to fight beside you" and "Jotaro, truly you are the inheritor of my will!"</br>  <br>It doesn't seem like Jotaro would say something like that. And I like how Johnathan just ignores Jorge and Joseph.</br>  <br>That's so fanfiction-tier that I love it intensely.<br><br>I can't fucking wait to see all the unique dialogue.</br></br></br>  <br> It doesn't seem like Jotaro would say something like that. <br>one of his most consistent character traits is great respect for people that deserve it<br><br> And I like how Johnathan just ignores Jorge and Joseph. <br>jorge is a fag and joseph didn't beat up dio</br></br></br></br></br>  The demo is way more fun than I was expecting.<br>Or maybe I just set my expectations way too low.<br><br>What stages will they include for other parts, anyway? The Coliseo di Roma seems like an obvious choice for part 5. As does the high security ward for part 6.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You're such a cool guy anon. Your capacity to have read manga before others is truly astounding. You sure showed that idiot. Epic stuff friend.</br></br>  <br>It's not a case of "before others" if they have no intention of reading it in the first place (and given he referred to said friend as "anime-only" and was willing to spoil them, I'm willing to bet that is the case here). <br><br>All's fair in love and war.</br></br></br>  <br>god I wish I were as cool as this anon</br>  <br><br>I was thinking the same thing today. I wonder what hermit purple requiem or superfly requiem would be like?</br></br>  <br>It's not a real spoiler you dumbfuck</br>  <br>If you want to discuss a 30 year old series and get butthurt when someone talks about something in the series not covered in the anime, you're a retard.</br>  Are people considering what music was popular at the time the various Parts were being written/came out to consider possible EDs? It seems like Araki's giving DP a list of what he was listening to at the time he wrote the Part, so that would probably be the best method to try if you wanna get something that fits thematically.  <br> what,do you think people on the internet would tell lies? <br>You animeonlyfags deserve to be spoiled</br></br>  <br>It's not a good indicator, really. He's not going to have been listening to things that weren't out yet, but he could have been listening to anything already released and he's already proven he has quite the interest in old rock.</br>  <br>How am I supposed to know what's on that list? He could have listened to Livin on a Prayer by Bon Jovi on constant repeat through the entirety of Part 4 for all I know.</br>  <br>relax</br>  <br> relax <br>JoJo is some serious shit, anon. People have died due to serious discussions about how gay Pucci was for DIO, and you're telling me to relax?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Well, that's very true, but Walk Like An Egyptian was only released three years prior to Stardust Crusaders coming out so I figured if you're gonna take a shot in the dark why not make it a slightly educated guess? (And be fucking honest, given he DOES seem to have a propensity for "dadrock", would you ever have guessed "Walk Like An Egyptian"?)</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where did the post even suggest that you dense fuck?<br><br> You animeonlyfags deserve to be spoiled <br><br>Read the manga dick weasel. Saying "oh man I troll this animeonly faggot so hard yesterday because I made up a spoiler. I was so smart and he was so dumb" makes me think you're not actually old enough to post on this site. It makes you look a pathetic cretin.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does that even need to be discussed? It's blatantly obvious how priest is a turbofaggot.</br>  <br>Usually the debates center around whether a love of God (which Pucci expressly compares to his love for Dio) would or should be romantic or sexual in nature and thus whether they did the dirty and thus whether it's truly "gay."</br>  <br><br>Did you see the part where he said that thing that hadn't happened? And it mildly inconvenienced someone that prefers their visual media with sound a colour? It was impressive stuff. I hope he tells that story again someday.</br></br>  You now remember Kakyoin.  <br>I think they're just basing the ED song on the mood of the part and how well the song fits in with the part. If the Part 4 ED was a Death Grips song I really wouldn't give a shit as long as it fit in with the part.</br>  <br>Oh hey</br>  <br>How can I remember Kakyoin when Abdul hasn't even arrived yet?</br>  <br>Little girls</br>  <br>Dio does mean God in italian<br><br>(one of the pictures in the captcha was a burning house)</br></br></br>  <br><br>Pucci may have had feelings for DIO, but he never had sex with him. The criteria for his "friend" who help him make Made in Heaven was someone with no sexual desires.</br></br>  <br> I love you as I love God <br> I'm going to give you my bone, Pucci <br> No homo </br></br></br>  <br> Every man who takes communion is partaking of the flesh and blood of jesus/God <br><br>Christianity is gay as fuck</br></br></br>   new vento translations bold words instead of putting every other word in "quotation marks" just because thats what the japanese does <br><br>feels good</br></br>  so I'm re-reading part 5 with the new stands, and I've got a quesiton about the man in the mirror fight<br><br>near the end abbachio cuts off his arm so that his stands arm (which has the key) will also be detached, which results in the stands hand being able to move on it's own and take the key somewhere else<br><br>Is this just a specific weird use of moody blues abilites, or is it implying that any stand user could do this if they're okay with losing a hand?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kira cut off his left hand to lose control of Sheer Heart Attack so it wouldn't affect him if anything happened to it.</br>  <br>now I'm even more confused</br>  <br>So am I. It makes sense for SHA but not for Moody Blues. Maybe it's just Araki making up bullshit again.</br>  <br><br><br>perhaps the way it works is like this<br><br>moving your stands body around is a power that applies to any part of that stands body, and since limb removal applies to both stand and user (as shown by part 5 silver chariot having different legs to represent polnareff being in a wheelchair) any part of your stands body can move within that distance<br><br>meanwhile SHA is not a standard punchghost stand and is portrayed as a completely separate ability from normal killer queen (abit one that still has a connection to it's left hand and by proxy kiras left hand). since SHA is completely automated instead of a punchghost you can manually move around, it could be argued that if kira removed his RIGHT hand then he could move killer queens right hand around separate from the rest of the body (which could be pretty interesting since that's the hand that makes things explode, imagine a flying killer queen hand sneaking up on someone, lightly tapping them on the shoulder as if to say "excuse me" and then making them explode)<br><br>i'm kinda rambling here but I think it makes enough sense</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What do you think about Polnaref and Jojo ?  <br>I think he retweeted a tweet that didn't mention JoJo and only used a reaction image of Polnareff. I don't know French though so I could be wrong.</br>  Damn, Kakyoin fucking sucks in the demo.  <br>You're right, but it's still fun r-right ?</br>  <br>can rejuvenate everyone, because it's the ultimate hamon stand</br>  <br>he seems like a character that needs two things<br><br>- to fight against human players that respect his traps<br><br>- a teammate that hangs near him to make those traps worth respecting<br><br>I can picture all sorts of shit where kakyoin just chills in his no girls allowed barrier and then one someone stands in it jotaro combos them for half their health</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shit, this fits so well, did you just think of it?</br>  <br>+ being the Sun minus the heat</br>  <br>That actually gets funner the longer you look at it.</br>  <br>I hated that from the part 7 scanlations, pulled me out of the story every time, subtle bold is the way to go</br>  F U C K I G G Y  New chapter spoilers when?  <br>You could make a pretty good Dio/Vanilla Ice edit out of this but I'm not sure how.</br>  <br>I listened to a lot of the stuff since I got into most of that shit while smokey weed and shit back in high school. When I found out about jojo's I thought it was the coolest shit that all these bands and musicians I like we're getting referenced</br>  <br>Pucci comes back, steals two of Josuke's testicles and kills your waifu</br>  <br>+Multi-Source Spirit Photography, that was the thing I found coolest about HP tbh, so the ability to merge all the various Spirit Photography techniques into one ability would be totally awesome.</br>  <br>It depends on the situation. The requiems we see, even Killer Queen, gain an effect that they need. Or for something they fixate on, like Silver Chariot.<br><br>So knowing Mista it could very well be this. It would explain why no part 4 ever.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh, what? He can do that with normal HP.</br>  <br>Holy fuck. Sex Pistols Requiem was used on all members of David Productions confirmed.</br>  <br><br><br> I haven't read part 5 </br></br></br>  <br>Well, balls, wasn't thinking, nevermind, The Sun minus the whole killing errything aspect works better anyways.</br>  <br>I have though</br>  anybody got the translation for the control screen yet  <br>Yeah, well, you smell of bacon.</br>  <br>So it's the sun but completely useless?</br>  <br>Well could you give an explanation of how the Bow &amp; Arrow work to those who read Part 5 but have no clue what any of the stuff about it meant.</br>  <br>yeah, but you dont need mirrors</br>  <br>Ultimate (Kars^Kars) Hamon comes with that, and automatic Spirit Photography.</br>  <br>You're saying all of this shit and I have no idea what it means. What's Ultimate Hamon and automatic Spirit Photography?</br>  <br>Have you even seen JoJo?</br>  <br> seen <br>I've read all 8 Parts and I have no clue what you're talking about.</br></br>  <br>Ultimate Hamon was what Kars acheived when he became a perfect lifeform, basiclly it was Hamon strong enough to hurt Hamon users badly and Automatic Spirit Photography I assume is the same as what Hermit Purple normally does but hands free</br>  <br> You're saying all of this shit and I have no idea what it means <br>Confirmed for not reading the manga. Getting stabbed with the Arrow Turned HP into an amplifier for Josephs natural Ripple, putting him roughly on par with Kars after his ascension to Ultimate Lifeform, it also made it semiautomatic and it can now create Spirit Photos without any conscious input from Joseph.</br></br>  <br>this anon gets it.</br>  <br>So he just breaks cameras without thinking about it? And stop acting like your fanfiction bullshit actually happened.</br>  <br>if you use some imagination it doesn't. you just need to think like araki does n't </br>  <br>Holy shit these threads are cancer</br>  <br>None of that happened, HP was basically just a way for Joseph to extend his Hamon, we don't know if it made it stronger and HP has no Requiem<br> Ripple <br>Really?</br></br></br>  I'm going to marry DIO!  <br>Sorry he's taken by a certain gay priest who just got here</br>  How would you feel if these were the English voices?<br><br>However heads up, Jotaro, hermes, Wham, Oldseph, DIO, Diavolo, and Josefumi are just terrible.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x1S<wbr>ytN3hJzI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>But I honestly think it'd be 10x better than the one funimation is going to make.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder when kids will get tired of this joke</br></br>    <br>it lets you locate all hot sexy singles in YOUR area</br>  <br> that Jotaro </br>    <br>Yup, well mostly rock and metal.

The one side we know about was Kira , hence why Soft and Wet has the bubble ability albeit modified.  Kira is also a JoJo, having Holly as his mother and Johnny as his Great Great Grandfather. </br></br>  <br> pucci <br>I love it</br></br>  <br>We know the other side, though. It's Josefumi.</br>  <br><br>Arrow pierces person = Stand, or death if their not strong enough.<br><br>Arrow pierces stand user = new abilty.<br><br>Arrow pierces stand = stand evolves and gains the ability to control souls.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>except when it doesn't SIX FUCKING TIMES.</br>  <br>I think thats because the Arrow was part of Black Sabbath.</br>  <br>The arrow pierce person is good.<br>But when arrow pierces stand user , he gets a abbility depending on his desires. ex : Kira BtD<br><br>Also when the arrow pierces the stand the stand evolves depending his desires : ex: requiem and GER<br><br><br><br>Now here's the problem<br>A lot of people actually forget that the arrow need to choose you, you can't stab yourself infinitely times to get a broken stand.<br>In that moment the arrow didn't choose Giorno, in the final fight you can see that, also you can observe how it reject Diavolo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe if you fat cunts buy the dvds, they'll announce part 4</br>  Define DIO's and Pucci relationship with one word.  <br>See "Arrow pierces person"<br>IMO the evolution happens only when fate is upon you(read plot reasons) or when you have undergone change and learning yourself, as Giorno did.</br></br>  <br>gay</br>  <br>Gay.</br>   Yfw Josuke isn't half Josefumi <br> Yfw Josefumi killed Kira and someone else and they fused to make Josuke  <br> Yfw Josefumi is the main villain </br></br>  <br>My browser froze for 5 minutes flat, fuck ubuntu.</br>  <br>Homo</br>  <br><br>Can be explained away with Araki's "Walking Contradiction" Stand ability. <br><br>As a shallow defence, the arrow itself has to grant the person the ability to evolve their stand, it won't just grant it on a whim, hence why King Crimson wasn't pierced. Note during the Black Sabbath fight the arrow was forced into Echoes, it didn't choose it, so maybe that's why? The reality is: Araki doesn't give a fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats wrong. Everyone in Passione got stands because of Black Sabbath. So why would it not work for getting a requiem as well?<br><br>Giorno back stabbed twice on his flesh and 4 times via Gold Experience and nothing happened. But then again that might explain why his stand is literally Perfect Kars: the stand.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Bromance.</br></br>  <br>Karera mistook Gappy for Josefumi.<br>He was obviously the one fused.</br></br>  <br> So why would it not work for getting a requiem as well? <br>You gotta be hot shit to get a Stand, but you gotta be real hot shit to get Requiem</br></br>  ITT: Predict first ED song for Part 4 anime (better than Requiem shit, Araki didn't mean it to be a rule, Silver Chariot does nothing it did before, it's just all random powers, so stop trying to find rules where there are none)<br><br> Shine on you crazy diamond <br> Starman <br> Build me up, Buttercup <br> All Star (battle) <br><br>So expensive it would ruin the anime tier: anything by Queen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone in the Passione entered thanks to Polpo, also, we don't know how much people died thanks to Black Sabbath, there might be a lot's of people you know?</br>  <br><br>Everyone in Passione got stands because the people it didn't choose were killed, like that old janitor. Don't forget, the arrow almost killed Koichi because he wasn't stong enough to have a stand. Its only because Diamond healed him he gained one. Which means Crazy Diamond might be the only stand that can actually defy the arrow.</br></br>  <br>But Giorno is hot shit. He literally got a requiem by that "hot shit" criteria. <br><br>And if you say "well you have to have the will or need for it in that moment." Giorno sure as hell had the will to defeat Black Sabbath so I don't see why he didn't get a requiem there, if not an ability to what he needed (something that produces light?).<br><br>Either way, Stand Arrows don't make sense. Don't even try.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Starman <br>Why? And I'd like a Prince song since he's Josuke's favourite Artist but that's not happening. It would be easy to get a Bowie song though since he's not a prick about his music.</br></br>  <br>I'm saying he became one of the spiritual top dogs somewhere in part 5 and became worthy of Requiem status. You know, character development?<br>Maybe he had the will/need, but he wasn't mentally strong</br></br>  <br>It just sounds nice and the main villain is Bowie. Also Jotaro fits as the Starman.<br><br>And lol implying Prince will charge less than Queen.</br></br></br>  <br> giorno <br> character development <br><br>pick one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nobody in their right mind would ever pick giorno</br>  <br>giorno simply wasn't cool enough to get a requiem at that moment<br><br>also, he didn't intentionally stab himself, like he did for getting requiem. I imagine something symbolic like that is a big part of the magic and/or alien arrow that gives people psychic powers working<br><br><br>why are you arguing about part 5 when you haven't actually read part 5</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WB owns Prince's distribution rights.<br>They can do whatever they want.<br><br>Also, Prince wouldn't charge anything, he would straight up tell them to fuck off like he did with the VA PS2 game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you know how much of a twat Prince is? It would cost less but that's only if they could convince him to let them use the song. He's the reason we didn't get the VA PS2 game.</br>  <br>I think he might have just read the bad scans but even then its hard to think that Giorno had no development</br>  <br>I never said Araki wrote him well, I'm arguing a logic he might have devised to explain the Requiem mechanics.<br>Another possibility is that Giorno hadn't been desperate enough and that true desperation comes when, after having defeated all odds, you come to the point where you completely understand how fucked you are. Giorno was a kid when he fought Black Sabbath.</br></br>  <br>Oh I didn't know that, I thought as stingy as Prince was he would have his own major label.<br><br>Prince is way too sexual for any songs that fit Part 4, Gold for Part 5 would be nice.</br></br></br>  <br>the bad scans are not part 5, they get too many things straight up wrong<br><br>at least duwang stops fucking up so bad after the first quarter or so, the bad part 5 scans actually get more things wrong as they go along</br></br></br>  <br>SHINY SHINY</br>  Just got my DIO SAS, how the hell do I take his head off?

There's pretty obvious ones like Josuke/Okuyasu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck didn't you start at the beginning you dumb fuck?</br>  <br> first JoJo <br>It's called Part 3 for a reason you faggot. You ruined yourself two parts, one of which is the best one.</br></br>  <br>I'm hoping for a Jonathan/Young Joseph one as well as Will/Ceasar as well as one for the respective Pillar Men combinations</br>  <br>More importantly why couldn't Araki draw her like one or more of her bones weren't broken?<br><br>There's exaggeration for effect, then there's just needing to go see a doctor for this shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't listen to this fag <br><br>It's fine watching Part 3 first. Sure you won't get the same experience as somebody who watches Parts 1 and 2 first, but you'll get a different one as well - you're going to see Joseph kicking ass when he was younger.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I read the part 1 manga, tried watching the anime, didn't really like it, didn't really like the start to part 2 manga, this was the last chance I was giving the series. Part 3 really won me over.<br><br>Is it worth reading the part 3 manga after seeing the anime? Or should I wait a few months?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but you get a better feel of Joseph's transition into a Wise Old man as well as the fact Part 3 spoils the way Part 1 ends</br>  <br>I've been wondering this too.<br><br>Really I just want to know what was the song they were listening to at least.</br></br></br>  <br>If Jotaro/Josuke didn't get one I doubt Jonathan will get one with Joseph.

Even if DIO/Gay Priest seems really fucking obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>I can dream</br>  <br>Gonna be honest, I don't even know why you're bothering. At the very least, Parts 1 and 2 provide a lot of context for shit in later Parts. <br><br>The Parts aren't direct sequels to each other but they're not so disconnected that you can really afford to just skip them. Except maybe MAYBE Part 5, but even then I still wouldn't advise it.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e3J<wbr>_y16aA9s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I'm not a video editing guru but here you go.

He just doesn't care.<br>He knows all the masters and he knows all the servants, he can tell rin and kill them all.<br>He doesn't want to.<br><br>He can tell Tokiomi about the grail and about Sakura. Then Tokiomi being a retard would try to deny the fact that grail is shit, Archer would kill him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hercules said Archer's swordsmanship was so good that it gave him a sword boner and made Hercules regret being summoned as a Berserker.<br><br>Archer was acknowledged by Hercules</br></br></br>  <br>He'd probably just follow Kerry around to see how he was like.</br>  <br>The real question is:<br><br>What if Kerry had summoned EMIYA?<br>I want to see that so much</br></br></br></br>  <br>What would kerry use as a catalyst?</br>  <br>Nothing.<br><br>It's his son.

Kind of like in SMT games when you get a fusion error.<br><br>Like in the most recent drama CD, where Medea accidentally summoned Nero.<br><br>Shirou himself is just an error in the world, they aren't too uncommon.<br><br>Might take some million different world lines, but mistakes happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Phoenix Wright got an anime?<br><br>No but seriously guy looks like Edgeworth from afar just with darker hair and no cravat.</br></br></br>  <br>Tokiomi still fucks up somewhere really important.<br><br><br>Tell that Robin, Chiron and Atlanta</br></br></br></br>  <br>EMIYA is a shit tier servant even with a perfect master.<br>He'd be even worse with fucking Tokiomi as master</br></br>    <br>In a fight, who would win, Hercules with his gigantic wooden club, or Andrew 'Bitches don't know about my stick' Jackson?</br>  <br>He hasn't won a single fight.</br>  <br> buttmad Saberfag <br><br>every time</br></br></br>  <br> He can tell Tokiomi about the grail and about Sakura. <br>If that was really such a big deal to Aacha, why didn't he do anything about it in FSN, and what would be different in Zero that he would act differently?</br></br>  <br>He won against Gil, anon.</br>  <br> literaly useless if the enemy isn't mindlessly running towards you </br>  <br>Andrew would be invincible if it was a one on one duel<br><br>If you challenge him to a duel then you're already dead. His endurance shoots up three ranks and he can ignore blows while giving you a fatal hit in turn.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he doesn't want to?<br><br>The only one he lost and he actually wanted to win was the shadow</br></br></br>  <br>Herc would force Andrew to pay denbts.</br>  <br>Andrew would wail on Herc so hard that the cabinet would have to pull him off.</br>  <br> Because he doesn't want to? <br>Wow.<br>Archerfags<br><br>Denial isn't just a river in egypt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont think EMYA can kill Rider.</br>    <br> I dont think EMYA can kill Rider. <br>Literally anyone can kill 4th''s rider.</br></br>  <br>That's nearly as pathetic as counting "Assassin's" wins in HF where the Shadow plays plot</br>  If Gilgamesh is the strongest Servant, and EMIYA can functionally do pretty much the same thing Gil can but better, and Shirou can do the pretty much the same thing EMIYA can, does that mean Shirou is stronger than any Servant?  <br>Hrunting</br>  <br>No.<br>Do you intentionaly ignore the "I can ONLY beat Gil" lines?</br></br>  <br>Hrunting isn't strong.<br>Did you even read that scene in HA?</br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>Shirou can't.<br><br>Archer can beat a fair share of servants. The one that gives him most trouble in 5th war is probably lancer.<br>Not even berserker.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you familiar with rock, paper, scissors?</br>  <br>Those didn't make sense.</br>  <br> Hrunting isn't strong <br><br>please shut up.<br><br>Also Iskandar is not strong either, Zero servants are all weaker than SN not counting Saber of course</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Assassin notes that Shadow isn't on his side, it would just as soon kill him as anything else nearby. It's nothing more than a stage hazard. <br><br>He lures other servants close to the stage hazard, and tries to bank on their pride getting the best of them as they don't retreat immediately.<br><br>What he's doing is entirely fair, and within tactics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they do make sense.<br>You just chose not to believe them because they contradict your headcanon</br></br>  Much better question is, how hard everyone around is fucked against this combo?<br>Mage that can kill any other mage.<br>Versatile as fuck servant who can straight assassinate masters from a distance.</br></br>  <br>Wait are you actualy defending the Shadow as a plot device?</br>  <br>Lancer, Berserker, and Rider say hello</br>  <br>Let's assume that for some reason Archer actually wants to help Kiritsugu win.<br><br>They win.</br></br></br>  <br>Bazett and Lancer would win easily.</br>  <br>I agree, servant fights should be no noble phantasms saber only</br>  <br>He doesn't use UBW against Berserker or Lancer. He still kills berserker 5 times. Which part of he didn't want to win the war was difficult to understand?<br><br>Rider in HF? That was because of the field</br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't use UBW against Berserker or Lancer. <br>Dude just stop<br> Against a normal opponent this is little more than a mildly annoying ability, but it is the natural enemy of a certain King of Heroes. </br></br></br>  <br>Why can't Shirou?</br>  <br> Also the Holy Grail wouldn't have burned the city, thus making this Shirou Emiya having a normal life and not becoming Archer. <br>That's the reason why he can't summon EMIYA</br></br>  <br>Same guy each time, go fuck yourself trying to turn what we're talking about into "I hate shadow, its a terrible anything, Nasu also hates it confirmed, oh wait it was confirmed he actually liked it a lot?, doesn't count, everyone hates it, its the worst anything, it sucks, don't defend it its just objectively bad and sucks and everything".<br><br>Can't mention it without that same autist showing up and trying to be an autist.<br><br>No that's clearly not what was being talked about in that last post. The last post was entirely about how Hassan in 5th war had victories that counted because he used strategy. Has nothing to do with how it worked, it was all him luring the opponent into fucking themselves up and it worked.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bazett and Lancer <br>Caladbolg'd to death.</br></br>  <br> He doesn't use UBW against Berserker or Lancer. <br>It is borderline useless against anyone who isn't Gil<br> Rider in HF? That was because of the field <br>No he gets petrified by her eyes.<br><br> b-but he didn't want to win </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hed try to stop dad from saving him and thus would kill himself like he tried to do in fate stay.</br>  Archer probably would have pissed off Saber, Lancer, and Rider because of his complete lack of chivalry or heroic honor.<br><br>I would love to see Emiya VS Lancelot though. I think Archer would have definitely saved Sakura if he was in the 4th war.</br></br>  <br>Just beat EMIYA with superior firepower</br>  <br>You actualy think only one person dislikes the Shadow?</br>  <br>Why do you always take like ten times the words to say stuff than it requires</br>  <br>There is literally no way for him to beat Lancer who isn't being fucked by a command seal.<br><br>To be fair relatively few people could.<br><br>Hell Archer was lucky as shit that war, he was the only servant to not be actively fucked by a shitty master.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you dumb? Seriously are you dumb?<br><br>He can project more weapons to kill Heracles all the time he needs you retard.<br><br>Against Lancer he didn't have any mana nor his intention was to EVER win the fight. <br><br>Do you go through the VN with ctrl? Hell even the anime implied he didn't want to win against Lancer at any point and that he didn't have much mana anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think Archer would have definitely saved Sakura if he was in the 4th war. <br>You base that on?<br>He didn't give a shit about her in HF and was trying to kill her before he got BTFO by Rider</br></br></br>  <br>Because he's nasu</br>  <br>He doesn't use UBW against anyone you mouthbreather. Using UBW or not is not an indicator of him going all-out. He's at his strongest when he uses tactics, not swinging swords around like a nut.</br>  <br> Ranged attacks  <br> Against the Choo Choo baby <br>Oh you</br></br></br>  <br>It's only one guy that goes autist on it in the same way with the same words each time. Tr</br>  <br> Are you dumb? Seriously are you dumb? <br>Considering you are actively disregarding Word of God i'd return that question<br> Against Lancer he didn't have any mana <br>Dude he was powered by Caster<br> Hell even the anime implied he didn't want to win against Lancer at any point and that he didn't have much mana anymore. <br>What part indicated that?<br>And yes he obviously didn't have mana anymore after the Aias got busted by Gae Bolg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was going to kill Rider before the Field kicked in and then Rider used the Mystic Eyes.<br><br>Read it again.<br><br><br>He knows everything about lancer, he can just use Rho Aias and defend himself against Gae Bolg. <br>That is if he actually has a master and if his intention is to actually win the fight. He didn't want to kill Lancer in that fight at he church.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The 5th Wars anti-Emiya is Rider since the Pegasus since he doesn't have enough mp for those delicious A++ BPs. Second is technically Assassin due to some absurd terrain advantage stopping Archer from just sniping him.</br>  <br>Lancer has no protection against AOE.<br>Caladbolg is a huge and powerful AOE which he can launch from a distance not even aiming at Lancer directly.<br>Even if it won't kill him it will obviously kill Bazett.</br></br></br>  <br> he can just use Rho Aias and defend himself against Gae Bolg. <br>Oh yeah that turned out so well.<br>Archerfags are worse than Shikifags</br></br></br>  <br> The result was Preta! </br>  Face the facts. Archer knows every single servant identity.<br><br>He is 1000 steps ahead of everybody.</br></br>  <br>Fucking bullshit son of a whore</br>  <br>Word of god says Shirou can't trace cool shit when we see him trace Caliburn and fucking Avalon.<br><br><br>Word of god means nothing</br></br></br></br>  <br> He is 1000 steps ahead of everybody. <br>And he still loses every fight.<br>That should tell you something</br></br></br>  <br><br>OP there's a upcoming novel that depicts this scenario but I can't for the life of my find it. Anyone know what i'm talking about?</br></br>  <br>Reading is hard apparently</br>  <br>Which part of <br> He doesn't have a master <br> He doesn't want to win against lancer <br><br>Did you miss again?

Emiya isn't even above average. He's only especially strong against Gil. He'd get fucking trashed in the fourth war without being part of a significant team.</br>  <br>Not even same dude but this is kinda dumb.<br>Archer is hellish strong, definetely stronger than 4th war servants.Or do you mean because of the stats? those mean shit and we all know it, especially with Archer's hability when using NP.<br>Hell the fact that he can kill basaka is proof enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, look, Emiya loses when he doesn't use all of his tools.<br>SERVANTS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO USE EVERY ABILITY IN EVERY FIGHT</br></br>  <br> Didn't use rho aias that can deflect normal gae bolg easily <br>Dude no<br> Takeuchi: So, would Archer get hit? <br> Nasu: For sure. But since he knows about it, he wouldn’t approach Lancer in the first place. If it looked like Lancer was seriously getting ready to use Gae Bolg, Archer would already be frantically getting as far away as possible. <br>CM 3<br> doesn't use all his arsenal <br>You base that on?<br> Fanfiction tier, he can just trace more and more powerful NP <br>I'm counting what he did not what your fanfiction says<br> No he doesn't <br>Please read the fucking VN<br> Doesn't want to fight and kill Cu <br>that is literaly never said<br><br> the rest <br>b-but he didn't want to beat them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How about the one where he snipes saber in F/HA <br>You mean the one where he tries to snipe Shirou and Saber easily destroys the first 4 Hruntings?</br></br>  <br>If you can somehow convince Emiya to actually fight the war in earnest, it doesn't matter how shit his master is since he will pretty much turn into Kiritsugu and use any means to win. Stats don't really mean shit for him when Mind's Eye basically means he can hold his own even when way over his head, and his skillset is bullshit enough that he can kill Heracles 5 times in melee. <br><br><br>To be fair, Nasu mentions Archer would have gotten out of range if Lancer really tried using Gae Bolg, and the Saber fight wasn't really much of a fight since he was too busy having flashbacks of her. Also, killing Berserker 5 times in melee is far more impressive than what practically every other Servant in the war can do save for a full-power Saber and maybe Cu, and he's pretty much never serious save when he finally tries to kill Shirou, or when he notices shit is getting real in HF.</br></br></br></br>  Archer killed Heracles 6 times.<br><br>Just wanted to correct that to he ones saying it's 5</br></br>  <br> He enjoys battle, and he would have grieved that his match with Archer "deserved better" had he been a normal Servant. He displays a brief sense of rationality while thinking this, wishing to have matched sword techniques with Archer to his heart's content and passed a satisfying time. </br>  <br> Nasu mentions Archer would have gotten out of range if Lancer really tried using Gae Bolg, <br>that's a nice formulation for "run as away as fast as he can against the fastest servant  besides Achilles "</br></br>  <br> literaly quoting the wiki <br>Just kill yourself</br></br>  <br>It's not wrong so why would I not quote it?<br><br>I'm not going to play Fate again to find a screenshot mouthbreather</br></br></br>  <br>I want people to tell me the servant aside from Archer than killed Heracles 6 times in melee.<br><br>Six times in melee, please tell me a few names.</br></br></br>  <br>It's an incredibly good tactic so long as Cu can't maintain the Gae Bolg charge while he's running after Archer.</br>  <br>Considering he drops the stance and jumps towards the enemy before using it I don't think Archer's tactic works that perfectly.<br><br>Gilgamesh does 12<br>Saber with one Strike of caliburn does 7</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Atalanta is effectively faster than Cu.</br>  <br>Emiya Shirou/Seibah. 7 times in one strike.</br>  <br> in melee </br>  <br>In that case Herakles jobbed too fast for others to do it.</br>  <br> Melee <br> Gil <br> Killing anything <br><br>Sure a team-up and it's said several times it was becaus the two of them did it. <br>And I should say that Archer can do something similar since he can trace Caliburn too.<br><br>Now tell me anyone else</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know how Archer told Rin to spend the war in her basement?  <br> And I should say that Archer can do something similar since he can trace Caliburn too. <br>No he can't.</br></br>  <br> Shirou can <br> Archer can't <br>'k i'm out</br></br></br>  <br> Now tell me anyone else <br>There are only 3 routes.<br>Fate: Jobs against Saber/Shirou<br>UBW: Jobs against Gil<br>HF: Jobs against the Shadow, Jobs even harder against Shirou afterwards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only in the anime, and even then that was probably still within it's 10-meter range. Cu has never been shown charging Gae Bolg while on the move (outside of the technicality of his throwing it in midair).<br><br><br>He should have it in UBW considering Shirou does, and unlike in Fate he had no Saber dreams to see it there. Not that it matters since Caliburn having that level of power is a one-time deal only possible because Saber was holding it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you completly miss the context of that scene?<br>Caliburn by itself doesn't do shit.<br>It was the "Miracle of being reunited with it's owner" that made the 7kill strike possible</br></br></br>  Something I can't understand.<br><br>I mean I know Nasu sucks at writing things without plotholes but hey.<br><br>Why doesn't Archer has Avalon as a NP? Say what you want but the dude has it on his fucking body since forever.<br>It doesn't make 1 bit of sense him not having Avalon's powers or something like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>did you not read the many times where he is successful</br>  <br>Avalon doesn't do anything without Saber around.<br><br>Likewise, he might simply have lost it. I think only UBW Shirou gets to keep it.</br></br></br>  <br> Only in the anime, <br>Read the fucking VN<br><br> The beast jumps. <br> Lancer instantly appears in front of the girl, as if he teleported, and… <br> Thrusts his lance at the girl's feet. <br><br> "" <br> It was a bad move, even to my eyes. <br> With the lance already lowered, it wouldn't be effective to aim low at the girl. <br> To prove my point, the girl jumps over the lance and moves forward to slash Lancer away. <br> At that moment. <br> Gae... <br> Bolg <br><br>And he covers 30 meters in "an instant" with one jump in the VN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Avalon only works while connected to Saber in some way. Outside of that, the image essentially "fades away".</br>  <br>You mean the ones where he kills Avenger while he sucks at imitating Shirou?</br>  <br>Fate <br>Plot bullshit.<br>UBW<br>Enkidu, okay sure but he rekt Saber before. Hard<br>HF: Everyone loses against the shadow what's your point?. <br>And who's ARM(one fucking arm) is giving Shirou power to kill Berserker?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think only UBW Shirou gets to keep it <br><br>Avalon prevents you from aging, right? Does that mean Shirou has eternal youth in the Good End?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand how people can say this. We got more than enough proof to realize Archer is really good at fighting, thinking and using his broken projections</br>  Can Archer beat anyone in melee combat?  <br>He'd get wrecked if he goes and fights like a Saber instead of Hrunting everybody's ass from a safe place like the Tohsaka manor.<br><br>We all know he's not going to do the latter, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Berserker<br>Gilgamesh<br>Medea<br>Medusa<br>For some reason not Saber even tho she's weaker than Berserker</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lancer and Saber would wreck his ass unless he starts symphatizing abilities from other weapons which is what he probably did to somewhat survuve Hec</br>  <br>Even if his stats aren't the highest, his skills are noted to be top notch, to the point that even Saber must admire his purity.<br><br>He kicks Hassan away without even trying in HF<br><br>Julius in Extra says he's a servant who excels in drawn out battles. Not sure you get if if you're asking, but he is a master of his blade, without tracing anyone elses abilities. If he was simply tracing he could never match another master, he can only match masters because he too has learned his style completely.<br><br>Anyone who hasn't mastered their style cannot fight him in melee.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Medea <br>Anon please</br></br>  <br> For some reason not Saber even tho she's weaker than Berserker <br>Maybe because Berserker doesn't have any technique?<br> unless he starts symphatizing abilities from other weapons <br>Copying other people won't help him he has to rely on his own skills/techniques<br><br> He kicks Hassan away without even trying in HF <br>Yeah but that's Hassan#<br> Anyone who hasn't mastered their style cannot fight him in melee. <br>That is so fucking stupid considering we're talking about servants</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I still don't understand how Archer was able to kill Berserker even once. It doesn't make any sense.  <br>He asked.<br>I just listed the ones he can.<br><br>He can't Lancer for sure.<br><br>I won't believe he can't beat Saber in Melee because of what I said about him beating Heracles while Saber can't do anyhing against him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's really strong?</br>  <br>Woops, for some reason I thought it was the opposite. My bad.</br>  <br>My bad, meant you were talking about that dumb scene with him breaking through the ground like some bulldozer. Regardless, the fight in Shirou's backyard is still damn close range and (more importantly) still doesn't show him charging Gae Bolg while on the move. Nasu makes no mentions of whether Archer's attempts to break the fight would end in either result, so there's still grounds to believe it's possible. <br><br><br>He stands a good fight against anyone who isn't like Saber/Lancer and aren't complete masters themselves. Even then, he still won't lose just because Mind's Eye can make up for the difference in stats/skill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why you're replying to me what other anon said.</br>  <br> Emiya <br>We should note that this is an Archer class Servant. He does surprisingly well in close range for any non-Gilgamesh of his class.</br></br>  <br> Tohsaka's my Master? Yes, YES----- <br> fuck, it's her dad <br> tfw your lifelong partner is a little 6 year old girl <br> tfw your dad is alive and being a mega edgelord cheating on his wife instead being of a hero <br> tfw your sister isn't even in Japan <br> only 1 female Servant <br> no exclusive female Masters <br>Yeah, fuck the 4th War.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And faggots like you are the ones saying Archer is weak.<br><br>He's just strong, there's nothing weird about it. He's fucking strong, intelligent and has a large arsenal of useful weapons. That's it.</br></br></br>  <br>Berserker against normal servants wins because they're really good at one thing; the servant will do that one thing, kill one live and then lose.<br>Archer gets to kill him many times because <br>a) he has many weapons<br>b) Berserker doesn't bother to parry attacks a normal servant would</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin wasn't his partner</br>  <br>gar</br>  <br>At minimum, that quote is very alike the one from the VN.</br>  <br>People really hype up "Can trace abilities and stats" when that's not how it works. He's not ditto who can have A+ in all stats if he wants. There's a reason he doesn't use the whole "Tracing others abilities or skills" so much as a servant when he's perfected his style. Tracing someones skill he can only get to maybe a 7 on the scale, a master is at a 10 on the scale, he's more suited to just using his own custom fighting style that he's created along the way where he's also a 10 in it. Gilgamesh has a 4 in skill, but a 15 in firepower.<br><br>Tracing someones fighting ability to fight another master of their blade, it would surely lose. Tracing Arthur's ability to fight Lancer, or Lancer's ability to fight Arthur, he'd surely lose. Against a true master of their craft, an imitation of someone's craft could never help him match up. Its not his style, it doesn't fit his body like his own style does, its just an imitation, its not him knowing it inside and out but rather just mimicking the form, there's a difference between mastery and simple imitation. A master would know everything about it inside and out.<br><br>He can use different weapons to figure out a path to beat others, but if he wants to match a master in close combat its gotta be in his own field.<br><br><br> That is so fucking stupid considering we're talking about servants <br><br>Any caster would probably lose in Melee, aside from maybe Tamamo who's also mastered CQC ironically, or Cu. Gilgamesh hasn't mastered his melee skills so he can't compare to Emiya who can fight up close on his own, but Gilgamesh has his own skills that let him had the edge on others.<br><br>Whether Archer can beat another master of their craft is a toss up depending on pure skill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Berserker does bother to parry tho.<br><br>He protected himself against Caladbolg II because he noticed it would kill him</br></br></br>  <br>Oh right.<br>Then maybe Archer uses lots of distraction to take him by surprise, or attacks from many angles at once.</br></br>  <br>Was he at peak condition at this time?</br>  <br> aside from maybe Tamamo who's also mastered CQC ironically <br>She's directly mentioned to be shit at CQC in Extra<br>Also pretty sure there are a lot of potential Caster's who are good in melee.</br></br></br>  <br>Tamamo of the Crotch Kick Explosion style of fighting<br><br>Castration is her specialty</br></br></br>  <br>She mastered a fighting style inbetween Extra and CCC. Her strongest attack in the game is now a melee.<br><br>She talked about learning this move in the seventh week of Extra.<br><br>Her fighting ability isn't too bad, she's about the only Caster that won't die immediately in close combat. Against enemy servants and random viruses she stands up tall with her little hand mirror. Her combat ability sucks as per Casters, but among Caster's she stands out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who?<br><br>Berserker? Yes.<br>Or Archer? He was ok but he didn't use UBW that could help him take a few more lifes maybe</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was immediately post-Archer fight. He got killed so many times so quickly his regen was just kicking in and he was somehow thinking lucidly compared to his normal madness. <br><br><br>And shown to somehow hold her own versus a fucking Saber in CQC.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember. It should be noted that ANY Archer minus Gil would have a far harder time in close range.</br>    <br>Please never again argue with Game mechanics<br> Also the reason why any off your servants win even one match is that Hakuno is the bestest ever who could win a grail war with Avenger </br></br>  <br>Gil would just get killed in close range. In like 2 swings or something</br>  <br>She's a Caster who stood up to Gawain in close combat, withstood and blocked his blows, and managed to come out ahead.<br><br>She's also a Caster who managed to magic blast someone with the same magic resistance as Saber in F/SN to death. Completely breaking the dragons magic resistance.<br><br><br> "These things didn't happen, they don't count" <br><br>Except they did happen, it was an entire point that your servant fought these people who had these skills in particular.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He was ok but he didn't use UBW that could help him take a few more lifes maybe <br>It's borderline useless against anyone but Gil.</br></br>  <br>Of course. MC is broken as fuck that's why you can kill everything on extra.<br><br>I really want to play CCC why the fuck is it not translated?<br>Extra looks awesome on my phone</br></br></br></br>  <br>Likely so but Gil's the kind of guy who would use Enkidu or a weapon like Ea if ever forced to go close range against Berserker-Herakles.</br>  <br> ANY Archer minus Gil <br>Gil is absolute shit at close range. Any redheaded high school kid with a week's worth of training could easily beat Goldie in a sword fight.</br></br>  <br>Its maybe being translated, but it'll take ages.<br><br>If you're impatient, there's a blog that has most of a route translated.<br><br>https://tsukinoura.wordpress.com/<br><br>Game has almost as much text as F/SN, plot custom written by Nasu as his big project recently, and probably too lewd for western audience.<br><br>This is some ultimate level lewd right here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> borderline <br>Well said. It can give him the edge in speed and distracting enemies with sword showers while he plans/traces something powerful enough.<br><br>It's not useless, you fags can't understand that it's not all about direct power, if it was like that then he would be like gilgamesh.<br><br>I doubt he can kill Berserker 12 times but a few more yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil's at least average in melee.<br>He relies on hard counter though.</br></br>  <br>He is but this is considering a Gil with crap like Ea &amp; not being overwhelmed. if Shirou have Gil enough room to breathe then Gil would have won.</br>  One thing that's great in CCC, the interaction between the cast is way up since they're all working together from the start and playing off of each other.    <br>Enkidu would work but taking Ea would result in his arm getting btfo like shirou did</br>  <br>Two weeks. And he technically cheated since he stole a lifetime's worth of CQC skills from his future Servant self within those two weeks.</br>    <br>Considering that Gawain is in charge of cooking, this implies that everyone else is worse.</br>  <br>I thought Shirou survived the fire due to Avalon being put into him by Kiritsugu, but wouldn't it have already become practically useless by that point since Saber was gone then?</br>  <br>Not always. Gil didn't have Ea ready initially &amp; had to pull it out.</br>  <br> I mean I know Nasu sucks at writing things without plotholes but hey. </br>  <br>Well, he was disconnected from a master and receiving little to no mana at all.</br>  <br> fuse it into something else <br> five minutes later <br> preta in the field <br> preta used macca beam! <br><br>GOD DAMN FUCKING SHIT SON OF A BITCH KARMA</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was one of his key traits anon, I mean the author is retarded and doesn't know what smart is but he is supposed to be.</br>  <br>[crotch violence intensifies]</br>  <br>Supposedly it still had a little bit of her mana left in it. It's the reason why it healed him there and then stopped doing shit during the rest of his life.</br>  <br>He still had to be hospitalized. Avalon probably had a minimal effect at best.</br>  <br> he can kill basaka <br>when did that happen?</br></br>  <br>No, he just felt like making it that day because he always thought he was the best back in the day, since Arthur never had the heart to tell him he sucked. He tells stories about how Arthur sat in front of his cooking with dead eyes unable to say a word as she slowly ate, clearly she loved it.<br><br>Sakura, EMIYA, and Tamamo seem to be the types that can cook well.<br><br>Gatou, Leo, maybe Rin and Julius have very minimal skills at best<br><br>Gawain and Elizabeth are the worst at this but can't realize it themselves.<br><br>When the Student Council is just shooting the breeze one day they think about opening up a cafeteria to make things a bit more fresh here, and experience the dorm life style a bit more. While talking it over they sort of realize none of them can cook too much. Rin seems to have the basics down, Gatou can only make rice gruel, Gawain is a vegetarian who only believes in quantity, and Julius cooks curry out of an oil drum when he's on the road.<br><br>They have to keep things light and joke around because the situation is so hopefulness, yet they try to stay upbeat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, CCC has a translation?</br>   Snipes the shit out of everyone in HA <br> Again and again <br> On every damn loop <br> The only way Saber was able to beat him there was through nearly infinite repeat and error where after getting her shit sniped every time she finally found a infinitely small opening she could finally exploit <br> And even then it was just barely <br><br>How in the flying fuck people think Archer is a weak servant is beyond me. Damn secondaries.<br><br> If he's so strong why didn't he win the HGW then? <br>In case you did not notice, which you most likely did not because you are a secondary retard literally no fucking Servant of the 5th, except Miss MUH BRITAIN gave a fuck about the Holy Grail. The 5th is a fucking joke of Holy Grail War.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer and Kerry do not have an ultimate attack. Unless you count the totally useless STRENGTH MOVES MOUNTAINS thing.</br>  <br>Keep dreaming</br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>Fate</br>  <br>You forgot Team BAHSAKAH also wanted to win the war, well the old man.</br>  <br>He kills Berserker several times in the Fate route.</br>  <br>Caster is most definitely his master during that fight. <br> being this retarded </br></br>  <br>Rin can cook in Stay Night. If that matters</br>  <br>Don't bother.<br><br>People still say Archer can't beat anyone and he's weak.</br></br></br>  <br>They really are retarded. Even if they have noble phantasms, he has an infinity of them.Even if each of them were a tenth of the strength of each noble phantasm, infinity/10 still equals infinity.</br>  Has there ever been a HGW where everyone is actually fighting for the Holy Grail instead of being nothing but retarded petty squabbles?  <br> because he always thought he was the best back in the day <br>But what if Arthur allowed him to because everyone else was worse?</br></br>  <br>The third one?</br>  <br>I like when people actually know what they're talking about.<br>Thanks</br></br>  <br>Where are anti-archer fags now? Why are you ignoring this?<br><br>Archer is a weakling right?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Some just don't die when they are killed</br></br>  <br>secondaryfags BTFO</br>  Why does no one in Fate actually own a car?<br><br>I remember there are a couple of parts where people have to rent taxis and stuff.</br></br>  <br>HA is non-canon fanwank.</br>  <br>HA is responsible for Prisma, the most important part of this franchise.</br>  <br> its not canon doesn't count xD <br>anon you are fucking stupid.<br>just absolutely completely fucking retarded beyond belief and you show the fact you are a secondary piece of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>it's canon tho secondary</br>  <br>who doesn't? nearly anyone has the age to drive</br>  <br>Extra Rin is a middle east terrorist, in the resistance against the plutocracy in the West.<br><br>She knows about survival and killing, she's far more skilled than normal Rin in some fields, but she's far more awkward in some other fields that might be considered "playing around" since she grew up in nothing but a battlefield.<br><br>She probably knows the basics of cooking for survival and how to treat poisons, but nothing too complex. Seems to still like Chinese food at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>UBW isn't Archer's trump card, Broken Phantasms are.

Can you get with your servant, or Rin, or whatever?  <br>Jesus Christ. That /and/ being blonde? Why is Extra Rin so inferior?</br>  <br>You get with your servant in the CCC endings, you have a brief "we'll always have each other" servant thing at the end of Extra original before things happen, you kiss either Rin or Rani in Extra and have some minor chemistry with them, you get with Sakura in the final ending of CCC but really its a different Sakura from F/SN so don't complain<br><br>CCC is a game all about love, but not entirely in a dating sim way.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, the Grail is corrupted, so it has a really high chance of picking shitty Masters.</br>  <br>You mean superior<br><br>Don't worry, I'm looking out for you and corrected you.</br></br></br>  You were seconds away from penetrating Saber during her route of CCC, before Rin interrupted by calling on the phone.  Then there's this whore, who won't stop getting naked.  <br>Flat ass.</br>  Every day I come home to this  Being able to dress up the MC sure has enhanced the game as well.  <br>Depends on who you're looking at.<br><br>Mages can't be assed to fiddle with something as fancy as a car.<br><br>Average Japanese high school students, at least in anime, always walk, ride a bike, or take public transportation. I don't know if that's just a thing in anime or if it's really that rare for a teen to drive in Japan.<br><br>Some Servants have their own means of transportation, so there's no need for them or their Masters to own a car.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its like Persona 3 in a way<br><br>Even if the plot underneath is solid, there's certainly that layer on the top where they allow you to fuck around and fun moments with the gang, before the shit hits.<br><br>Then someone dies and its sad</br></br></br></br>  <br>3 was a bigass full out war that the nazi's got involved in and THATS when angra mainyu finally joined the mess as a servant instead of fucking around in the grail causing corruption problems, in addition i'm pretty sure both acht and zouken were in the war fighting each other in their youths.<br>honestly i wish we one day got to see the full version of the 3rd.</br></br>  <br>Yet the second war is still noted to be the bloodiest.</br>  <br> blonde blue eye Rin <br><br>So who was the pitcher and receiver in RinxLuvia hatesex?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure it'll happen.

His connection with EMIYA is practically nil.

Remember that Arondlight, Gallatine and Excalibur are sword sisters.</br>  <br> Not pic related <br>Why?</br></br>  Reminder that Gawain is the most honorable and perfect knight of the round, who helped Saber fight a dragon once.  <br> Fucked up Saber  <br> Shit </br></br>  Then there's this one  Zoom out  Now with more graphix  <br>Gawain wielded the Excalibur many times before. He also wielded a sword called Galatine or another romanization. Apparently its name means "Gawain's sword" or something in another language.</br>  <br> Perfect <br>No, those would be the French fanfiction knights. Gawain is a reasonably flawed character unlike those mary sues.</br></br>        <br>You mean Galahad, the knight so knightly he made Arthur look like a common brute. <br><br>Galahad is the personification of chivalry and martial discipline.</br></br></br>  <br> b-but EMIYA will engage in melee like a retard </br>  <br> Galahad is the personification of chivalry and martial discipline <br>He's the personification of a shitty mary sue.

He's had the Grail the entire time. The Grail itself is more or less worthless, the piece of bread or wafer inside is the true valuable thing.<br><br>Sir Galahad wouldn't even be able to get the Grail, he's too awfully written for that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The only reason she was able to get to him was because of Shirou anyways. <br><br>No. That's the only way she was able to get to him while keeping Shirou alive.<br><br>Read FHA again. There's literally a slide explaining what I just said. I'd screenshot it but I don't have FHA on my computer anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirei's genetics seem pretty weak so it'd look like Bazett BUT it would have Kirei's personality.<br><br>Combine the Reinforcement runes, Fragarach from being Fraga and Kotomine Super Baiquan and that would be one magus killer you wouldn't want to fuck with.</br></br></br>  <br>Would it like mapo tofu?</br>  <br>His strategy was perfect<br><br>She tries to run up to him<br>He hits Shirou<br>He dies, therefore she dies<br><br>She tries to block or dodge<br>Eventually they're overrun<br>Either he or she gets hit, they die<br><br>The entire strategy hindges on the correct assumption that Shirou was her weakness, she could do nothing to protect him in that moment.<br><br>He wasn't even trying to kill her, he was trying to kill Shirou, since he knew that was Angya. He noted that for the other servants in the war he'd only give them a simple warning shot, but only for the faker trying to fool them all would he aim to kill.<br><br>It was a strategy where Saber didn't have a single change within her boundaries, outside of her master formulating a plan outside of countless loops to create a single change<br><br> But nyeeh it would work any other time, it was all about Shirou there <br><br>You don't get it worth shit if you're saying that. it was a strategy entirely designed to aim for Shirou. If he was just aiming at Saber he'd come up with a different plan more suited, but this plan was suited entirely around catching the most effective means of death for the opponent. It wasn't a situation where Saber had a single chance because Shirou was there and he knew it, and his range was perfect within that area. If you take out the master, you have won entirely.<br><br> But nyeeh if Shirou wasnt there... <br><br>He was only doing that in the first place because Shirou was there.<br><br>meanwhile Nasu directly says Archer vs Saber is a toss up between who manages to hit who first, both of them have an advantage at their desired range. Its noted EMIYA has an equal chance of killing her no matter what you say.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That fucking scene with Kirei still ending up being the  final boss  in HF is just weird.</br>  <br>Galahad's legend is "Get the grail". He's the insta-win servant no-one will be able to summon because he's too OP and no-one who wants the grail would be pure enough to get it. <br><br>Fisher King having it doesn't work because the Grail isn't in his possession when he's summoned, so effectively Galahad is the better option since he's basically a guarantee to get it due to revisionfaggotry.</br></br></br>    <br>It would love Mapo Tofu but it'd be too broke to afford it, having inherited Bazett's terrible luck and Kirei's need to donate to the church.</br>  <br>He might get the grail, but it won't be the correct grail.<br><br>There's an entire point that the Fuyuki or any other wish granting grail is not the grail of Christ.</br></br></br>  <br> He really is like a self-insert character <br> is like <br>He isn't like one, he is one. I don't mean metaphorically, I mean HE IS ONE. As if being the son of Chrétien de Troyes' OC DONUT STEEL Sir Lancelot wasn't enough evidence.</br></br></br>  <br>OK.... not sure if you're trying to negate my point...</br>  <br>Either way, anyone who's legend involves the grail in any positive way including Percival, Galahad and the like would probably have sick advantage in a grail war due to legends alone.</br>  <br> Galahad's legend is "Get the grail" <br>The entire Grail story was an unfinished tale by Chrétien de Troyes staring Sir Percival. There is no knight more connected to it. No Percival, no Grail altogether.<br><br> Grail isn't in his possession when he's summoned <br>No, the Fisher King had the Grail during the story. If Galahad spawns with the Grail then the Fisher King should spawn with it even more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't Galahad be summoned Ruler at that rate if he has that auto Grail ?</br>  <br>I say he'd be summoned as "Faggot" or "Thief". Percival wants his story back.</br>  Will Pika spare Machi?  <br>Why would he? The only spider cute enough to be spared is Shalnark.</br>  None of them deserve to be spared except maybe Killua's little brother.   sparing scum <br><br>the only spiders who have even a remote chance of being spared are those who didn't participate in killing the kurtas.

Even then I'm just guessing, Kurapika might not give any shits whatsoever.</br></br>  <br>She was there from the beginning, no chance</br>  <br> Kurapika sparing a Troupe member again <br>kek</br></br>  <br>If he doesn't spare Kalluto Killua will probably rek him.</br>  <br>I don't think Killua cares much about Kalluto.</br>  <br>Purple Machi a best</br>  <br>Ugly no matter the hair color</br>  <br>Togashi girls are the best</br>   tfw the Zoldyck family hid the fact that Gotoh died from Killua <br><br><br>He doesn't dislike Kalluto, and Kalluto did nothing wrong too. The only reason Killua would have for disliking him is that he's a momma's boy, and Kalluto ditched her.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw the Zoldyck family hid the fact that Gotoh died from Killua <br>Who cares? Hisoka is Gon and Killua's BFF now</br></br>  <br>I never implied he disliked him, anon. Just that he wouldn't care much and not try to get revenge on Kurapika if he ended up killing him.</br>  Kalluto is a boy? What makes Zoldyvks become traps?  <br>I don't see why he wouldn't be pissed at Kurapika considering Kurapika's supposed to be his friend.<br>I get he wouldn't care about revenge if it were someone he didn't know killed Kalluto, but a friend?</br></br>  Killua is cute!  Someone could explain me how did Kalluto learn nen even younger than Killua?  <br>Machi probably trained him.</br>  I kind of think that Kurapika will eventually give up on killing the entire Troupe, when he realizes that they're all just a bunch of outcasts doing what they do best, and that they all truly care for each other. He at least showed some compassion/respect for Uvogin by burying him, and he seriously hesitated when he saw how much Paku cared for Chrollo. Obviously this wouldn't happen in the story without some major development like them being forced to work together against some greater opponent in the Dark Continent or something, but I get the feeling that Kurapika already feels really conflicted with the Troupe in that he thought they would be a bunch of scumbags who killed for fun, but they're actually a lot deeper than that.  <br>Killua is hard enough to control without nen. Kalluto listened to whatever his mom told him to do.<br>You do the math.</br></br>  <br>Why did Zoldyck family go crazy when Killua left them but no one cares when Kalluto did it?</br>  <br>Killua is the heir.</br>  <br>Killua has white hair like Zeno and Silva making him the true next head. The other sons are replaceable.</br>  Will Togashi ever finish HxH in our lifetimes?  <br>And even so, how the hell Kalluto could join Ryodan replacing goddamit Hisoka? Is he/she so powerfull?</br>  <br>nigga hisoka was never an actual member to begin with</br>  Did you like the new opening and ending songs?  No and no  The first ending was great, it managed to get me hyped for the next episode every time. This one is just "fine"  ED visulas were saved thanks to based Nao.  Its decent but I loved the old ED especially the ending of it.  Opening is better but ending song is alright.  SHIT they changed the OP and ED?<br><br>I accidently conditioned myself to eat a specific meal while watching this show. <br><br>I freak out if i dont watch the Op while eating.</br></br></br></br>  The OP is really good<br>Especially the part where Megumi orgasms while tomatoes are raining</br>  I feel the new OP fits really well for all the stuff that's going to happen soon.  Not nearly as much as the previous OP/ED. Good episode though, I'm hyped as shit for next one  <br> being this autistic </br>  <br>Didn't like the songs for either, but liked the visuals of the new ED.</br>   They replaced the glorious first opening with this shit. <br>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.</br>  They're really good. The last ED was overrated as hell, the only good part of it was the changing faces every episode.  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  I've never watched the entire OP for this show  <br> First opening <br> Glorious <br>It was shit</br></br></br>  I don't understand how anyone could possible prefer the first OP over this one.  Spot the  otp   Full color chapter is out.<br>http://imgur.com/a/8jmzj<br>Shit scans never.</br></br>  <br>If the characters in the ladle indeed change, I figure Isami will be visible then and these guys will be turned around.</br>    <br>All I can see is Hisako's butt and that slutty look on her face like she desperately wants some cock.</br>  I like the new OP, it's kinda spoily for Animeonlyfags tho.    <br>why the fuck is meat in there<br>that makes me mad as fuck</br></br>  <br>Souma's dad beat you to it.</br>  <br>This.<br>Ibusaki and Marui got even a higher score than her.</br></br>  Souma reaching top 5 and Erina moving to the polar star when?  I want Kanon to appear in the festival.<br>A maid cafe would be good too.</br>  <br>she's the love interest</br>  <br>Both OP are ok, but the first one is glorious and for comparision this one is shit.</br>  <br> I want Kanon to appear in the festival. <br><br> Kanon visits Soma's booth <br> Soma and Megumi offer her their food <br> she's all happy seeing them again and eating their food <br> Soma sees Erina passing by <br> "Oi, Nakiri!" <br> Erina and Kanon respond   "Nani?" <br> everyon'es face when </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the irrelevant one.</br>   There are people that don't pick Yuki   <br>They literally could not have picked a worse ending song. I didn't think i'd be able to hate vocals that bad in an OP/ED song since fear and loathing in Las Vegas</br>  <br><br> no more fuwa fuwa <br><br>Fucking dropped</br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck that voice on whoever sings the ED, what the fuck she sounds pretty annoying  It's the nasally vocals that put people off from the new OP, right? You guys probably don't like Nano Ripe, either.<br><br>I can see why it's a bit of an acquired taste, but I like it.</br></br>  <br>It's better than the last OP, not that that means much</br>  I TOLD YOU ALL<br>I TOLD YOU ERINA AND SOMA ARE SIBLINGS<br>YOU DIDN'T LISTEN</br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags </br>  <br>is anime your autism medicine</br>  <br>animeonlyfags, everybody</br>  <br>They aren't.</br>  <br>are you fucking retarded</br>  <br>ED's not that bad, but the OP is tragic.</br>  <br> Erina <br> living in some dorm like a commoner <br><br>I'd like to see grandpa slap the shit out of her with an eviction to Polar Star</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has her own money. Has a job that pays extremely well. Has connections and high level of business acumen.<br><br>In short order she would buy, remodel, and stock the polar star dorm with servants without even needing her family's money.</br></br></br>  オオオオオオ lives on.  Did they add a lot of anime only scenes or was it just me  Does the new OP mean were going to end at the end of the Autumn Election? Looks like it from the moon. <br>Either way, I'm fucking hype.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3i_<wbr>0j4vFnUk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I dig the ED. You just have to listen to it a few more times.</br></br>  <br>No, we'll get only the preliminaries. Gigga Nigga wasn't even in the OP.</br>  Casanova is out.  <br>Finally.</br>  <br>http://casanovascans.com/read/shoku<wbr>geki_no_soma/en/0/127/page/1<br><br>wow how come so fast compared to last week?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Because Jump came out early this week for some reason.</br>  <br><br>Was wondering how they would have pulled off like 50chapters, but alright, I'm down. I want the Election to be thoroughly adapted, so let's hope for S2.</br></br>   surstroming  <br><br>jesus christ</br></br>   he does it for free   <br>These lyrics are fucking weird.</br>  <br>The Alice trio scene was great.<br><br>Also, Nao a cute.</br></br></br>  So Ryou with his flattering is like a bad influence for Alice.  What Souma is planning? God damn it, I really want to know. <br>I can't wait for the next chapter.</br>  <br>I just like how he's basically saying "hey, you don't have to mean it, just do it".</br>  why doesn't casanova just put the translations in the full color pages  <br>We still need to know whom he gave a key to and why, along with what's happened with Eizan and Rindou.</br>  <br>Because it's far harder to clean.</br>  <br>It's hell to redraw color pages.</br>  They were both shit. The ending specially so.  <br>I don't know much about that process but I figure redraws are harder?</br>  <br>Yeah. The first OP is one of the worst I ever seen (sound wise)</br>  <br>Hand was mysterious girl from chapter 117.</br>  <br>Probably a man's hand. It was the same size as Souma's and notably larger than Megumi's on the same page.</br>  <br>how do you tell</br>  <br>She was the only background character that wasn't full colored in the color chapter. Same with Yugi and Nene.</br>  So is Souma gonna be able to marry Erina knowing that everytime they fuck, she's gonna be thinking of his dad?  So they skipped the introduction of the AE which means half of the dialogue is going to be original. Gonna be wierd.  I like this OP more. Builds anticipation for the tournament really nicely.<br><br>The ED is okay I guess, but it's no Fura Fura~ and it will take some time for me to stop missing that ED. <br><br>I do like that they featured stalker-chan in it though.</br></br></br></br>   tfw jc staff are doing 2 other shows this season   <br>His goal has always been to beat his old man. On every front.</br>  <br>What if the punishment includes grandpa using HIS connections to get her temporarily blacklisted by her usual clients?</br>  <br>The loli master strikes again</br>  <br><br>Thank you, someone else who can see her charm. It's the same charm as Tomoko, but useful.</br></br>  I only liked the old OP when Soma was singing it drunk.  Hinako and Donato a best.  This series has provided the most lighthearted enjoyment out of any series from at least the last 5 years, if not the last 10.<br><br>It's great, relaxing, interesting, and fun to watch. I love it.</br></br>  I see we got scans of the recipe book's SS today, I'll get started on them right away.  <br>Yeah there's few shows I don't procrastinate on anymore, but even after catching up on the manga I still look forward to new episodes of this.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  I like the new OP and how it shows everyone's dishes (I'm sure Ryo's will also be revealed later). The ED is sexy but nowhere near as fun as fura fura. Also, /u/ overload.  <br>I want to make Souma a little half-sister.</br>  Neither songs for OP or ED feel particularly good.<br><br>Visually the OP is pretty nice but I feel like there is too much emphasis on Hayama being the top rival.</br></br>  <br>I think that might only seem the case for mangafags. <br><br>Should ask animefags the impression they got from it.</br></br></br>  <br> Same with Yugi and Nene. <br><br>Maybe that was a rejected design for Rindou.</br></br></br>  How did Ryou get from<br> talk shit after you have more wins against me <br> as usual, your cooking is too pretty but lacking taste <br> you lost because you're too casual <br>to<br> hey currybro, you gotta compliment her first  <br>? <br>And all the first three was said by unbandanaed Ryo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not seeing how that's incompatible.<br>They're competitive, but live together and have to work together, so he learns to grease her wheels when he needs to, so to speak.</br></br>  <br>We know that he is quite competitive so it's no surprise for him to trash-talk in the situation he was in. On the other hand he is quite docile when in butler mode.</br>  <br>He realized the reason his father's recipe loses to Yugi's is because the guy deliberately made it milder since they run a special of the day restaurant. <br><br>Hence there is a way to "complete" the recipe for full spice.</br></br></br>  How do we go from this  <br>to THIS?</br>  <br><br>I don't know but I'm not complaining, that shit was hilarious.</br></br>  <br>I really liked this scene, J.C. Staff did a good job.</br>  I really like how Souma can get along with just about everybody.<br><br>The thought never came to mind about these two meeting but their interactions are pretty funny and has great potential.</br></br>  <br>wait, is the new issue translated? I just caught up and dont remember reading this</br>  <br/>  <br> not yukihihihihihihihihira </br>  <br>thank you friend</br>  <br>I wish she smiled more.</br>  <br>So the bandannas do nothing?</br>  <br>They lower the salt content of the dishes.</br>  <br>It's just his full gear.</br>  <br>looking fey there, Donato</br>  Would you cut your vegetables on this chopping board?  seriously, I thought by this far in Souma would have already made the elite 10. I suppose its more interesting to have him struggle some, but how long can they keep it going?  Umaru on the front page!  <br>You can't just put Chaika's face into anything.</br>  <br>Explain to a newfag?</br>  selfcest umaru doujins when?    <br> 20 million posts happened in a year. <br><br>This is disgusting.</br></br></br>  Kyon-kun denwa.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JXH<wbr>vOge4WvI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br>She makes my dick diamonds.

Am I right?  <br>dem legs</br>  <br>I want to do dirty things with her.</br>  I wasn't even trying to get boner this episode. Dammit Rori. <br><br>Overall, a good episode, although the cgi dragon is lame.</br></br>  <br>So fucking lame, why can't they show her panties in anime? Do they have to use these stupid physics to cover her up?<br>Fuck this. A-1 is really apologetic fucks.</br></br>  <br>Why do you need her panties when you have her voice to fap to.</br>  <br> liking lame pantyshots </br>  <br><br>It's the difference of being awkward and apologetic, or being proud and glorifying about a girl.<br>Fuck you for promoting censorship.</br></br></br>  <br>I find it way more entertaining to see all the different ways the actually cover up her panties. Besides, that's not why I like this series. Go watch K-On or some shit if you want that.</br>  <br> Go watch K-On or some shit if you want that. <br>Excuse me, are you retarded?

Just watch Steins;Gate along with this as it comes out, dipshit.</br>  <br>Not being able to separate reality and fiction is a key indicator of mental illness, so yes. <br><br>There's no difference in the "loli is CP/pedo/child rapist!" comparison and "You watched a Hollywood movie, now you'll be charged with murder."</br></br></br>  <br>The dragons could use more frames.</br>  <br> We won't ever get her spread eagle nude and showing off her pubes in the anime <br>Why live</br></br>  <br><br>is it a coincidence that Rory in japanese sounds like loli?</br></br>  <br>How does one sound like a lewd 12 year old?</br>  <br> Likes 2D girls looking like kids <br><br>You're a sick bastard.</br></br></br>  <br>The warrior bunny's pubes could be even better to touch than nopubes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128221263 <br> So you're proud about being a pedophile? <br>Why not?<br><br> go back to jail you degenerate fucker. <br>charge me with a crime first, retard :^)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it worse than Chaos Dragon?</br>    <br>If she was sitting on me I would not be able to contain the boner.<br><br><br>You have great taste anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to do the anal with rory's ass</br>  <br>Best girl is finally here.<br><br>I don't dislike her design in the anime at all.</br></br></br>   pantsu shown in the magazine posters <br> no pantsu in the anime <br>Man, I don't mind fanservice or not, but trollphysics are always annoying.<br>Rori a best.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not usually into loli but she makes me want to do technically legal things to het</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br>faggot</br>  <br> porn will use her bleh anime design instead of the glorious goth loli LN/manga version </br>  <br>hardy must be one hell of an otaku</br>  <br><br> Tuka in a sweater <br><br>dick status: muh</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, she's as much as a loli as Hestia is one, she's more of a petite woman than anything.</br>  <br>I don't get why anyone would think she's a loli.

It's quite important as to show who she kills and who she doesn't. Though I guess the fact kids knowing and liking her makes it a bit obvious.</br>  <br>It better then adding fucking white/black bars to everything.</br>  <br>Original design, do not steal</br>  <br>Gargantia?</br>  <br>Patamon fucked an Eevee</br>  So is Rory's height in anime?  <br>*what is</br>  Disappointed by this episode tbh.<br><br>I feel they're missing a lot of the gravity that the JSDF's actions are having on the general populace, as well as the general fucked-up-ness of the surrounding area now that it's become mostly lawless.<br><br> Bandits raping and pillaging cut <br> Gravedigging cut <br> No one else willing to help the stuck cart cut <br> Reactions to the JSDF rushing the fire dragon cut <br> Reactions to the JSDF fending off the fire dragon cut <br> Last scene didn't show the kids and old people being relieved <br><br>It just feels like the anime is way more lighthearted than it should be at times, which makes me worry about upcoming events like the Italica Crisis.<br><br>That being said, at least Rory and Lelei were enjoyable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I've heard somewhere it's like 5'3. I might be mistaken but it seems about right.</br>  <br>Tiny. She can basically stand up straight inside the hummer.</br>  <br> 5'3 <br>Nigga, adult men are 5'3 in Japan, try again</br></br>  <br>It's anime though and the men seem pretty tall</br>  So can we all finally agree that the anime design is better than the manga design?  <br>Agree? This is 4chan we don't agree here.<br><br>But everyone on the anime side are not autistic.</br></br></br>  <br> can we all agree <br>Over my dead body.</br></br>  Is this going to become a full harem?

Maybe add black bars or lens flare?  <br>They included the one shot of a murdered refugee but yeah it definitely could have used a bit more setup.</br>  Why did my RSS download this twice?  Why did Rori kill those guys?  <br> it definitely could have used a bit more setup. <br>There's been 3 episodes of setup.

If she was just some mass murderer, those kids wouldn't have ran up to her excitedly.</br>  <br> tech&gt;fantasy <br><br>That's not the point of the show at all. <br><br>Hardy could rape Japan along with the entire Earth if she wanted to.

Haven't read Rune Troopers either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I like her LN design better.</br>  <br>Probably because no retarded red underlip.</br>  <br>I prefer her anime version to the manga one by a good deal but the LN design definitely strikes me as the best.</br>  <br>So you like the anime version more than the manga version and vice versa? That makes no sense at all.</br>  <br>boner</br>  <br>LN design and manga design look quite different most of the time, and anime design is sort of its own thing.</br>  <br>LN Rory &gt; Anime Rory &gt; Manga Rory</br>  <br>LN design and anime design are the same thing in essence, same dress and all. It's the manga design then went far left field with her gothic design.</br>  <br>are you color blind ?</br>  <br>No? I have all the illustrations with me here.</br>  <br>I think  was implying that the LN designs have red lips too. The anime design uses bright red so it's much more prominent.</br>  <br>she has a purple lipstick on, and your scans quality are rather on the meh side too</br>  <br>Do you think we will be able to get the pantsu version from the BD?</br>  <br> she has a purple lipstick on <br>Where is this said?

But Rory is still half-mortal and has enough agency to decide who she gets to kill. Her picking targets she consider evil is a choice she made. There are other demigods who were far more cruel, some of who were so unpopular that they got subdued by opposing demigods and sealed away in pieces because they were doing too much damage to society.<br><br>in short, Rory has the licence to kill, but she gets to pick who unless her god told her to do something specific.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wish this scene was included in the anime.<br>Apparently it wasn't in the novel, but still.</br></br>  <br><br>Glorious hand drawn dragon with little, to no animation, or CG dragons of middling design and with actual animation?</br></br>  <br><br>Regenerating immortal with superhuman strength.

Manga &gt; anime.<br><br>It doesn't even matter what the anime may have done better. Fucking up Rory and Kuribayashi's designs is just too much.</br></br>  <br><br>No Fair!</br></br>  <br> better than the manga <br>So you don't mind butchering of characterisation due to censorship/cut scenes?<br><br> objectively terrible pacing <br>How? The manga did things like explain how the elf was in the well when they found her which the anime hasn't done yet. Also Spending 15 min on how otaku Itami is in the first ep was terrible.</br></br></br></br></br>  gothic loli (rori?) saved the show  <br> butchering of characterisation due to censorship <br><br>What are you talking about?</br></br></br>    <br>Her voice was the best part of the episode.</br>  <br><br>Same here OP. I watched these three today, and said fuck it and read all the manga.<br><br>While it still has a bit of a harem going on I really do enjoy  the fact the Military is still a strong giant force to not even be touched in their world. Like the premise of something existing that could actually take down the stationed Japan Military just doesn't exist. I wonder how the manga will end, setting up all these different things. I think the most recent chapters where they take down the Fire Dragon was pretty nice, especially with them flying in on the fighters and just demolishing everything. Generally if a character meets a hurdle in the manga and the military can't do anything it's for diplomatic and real reasons instead of some stupid anime tier reasoning. <br><br>But now that I read it all I'm kind of sad. Is there any manga/anime similar to this? Basically two worlds meeting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The they cut out things like how Rory and her goddess don't believe murder or even rape to be a sin just "human nature".</br>  <br><br> vlcsnap </br></br>  Help me, anons, I have become the lowest common denominator. I couldn't help but keep laughing continuously at this scene. I'm loving this anime.<br><br><br>Well, there's Outbreak Company. The anime is really good but it's way more focused in politics and pacific relationship than the use of military.<br>There's really one episode where they BTFO a dragon and everyone gets impressed but it doesn't really affect the anime in any way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much the only things so far (it could still be inserted on Italica, though)., also in my opinion her whole speech in that scene is contrived and contradictory by itself Other than that they added a bit of characterization for both Itami and the female medic.</br>  I don't really mind things getting cut. It's easy to understand why they can't fit everything due to time constraints.<br><br>Besides, if I have read the source then all that nice background info is in my head already and I still understand. If I haven't read the source then I got something to look forward to if I decided I like it enough to go read.</br></br>  <br>I agree, i kinda wan't to drop it but i will give it a chance if it gets better.</br>  <br> could still be inserted on Italica <br>Hopefully they won't censer that battle and how she gets when near battles.<br> her whole speech in that scene is contrived and contradictory by itself <br>It just gives people an early idea of how she isn't just some simple goth loli who has a different sense of justice to normal. Anime only people may miss out on that point.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I know of Outbreak Company already. It was semi enjoyable. I feel the the MCs tendency to be a giant weeb and start teaching everybody "otaku" culture was a bit too much, but it wasn't terrible. It feels like these two are the only ones though.</br></br>  <br><br><br>How do I get me a gothic loli who actually WANTS to be raped?</br></br></br>  After seeing the first episode I thought this would be one of the best animes in a long time. But now it's quickly diven headfirst into a pile of mediocrity. It's like when you see a commercial for a delicious burger and then you try it and it tastes like the frozen burgers you get at safeway.  <br><br>Would No Game No Life suffice?<br><br>Not quite military vs. military action but definitely two worlds colliding in a way. Very good anime in general, either way.</br></br></br></br>   that bemused knowing look <br> diamonds <br><br>It bugs me that the anime doesn't have the blood and guts that the manga does. The dragon was nowhere near as threatening as in the manga. Why do they do this shit?</br></br></br>  Why aren't they studying the sky?<br>They should research astrological stuff, like how much a year takes, if they are still on the milky way, no, if they have any similarities between the constellations and super-clusters.<br><br>If they two worlds are actually in the same universe it would be pretty fucking neat.</br></br></br>  <br> that bemused knowing look <br> "perhaps I have finally found the right group of men who can finally successfully rape me" </br></br>  <br> I couldn't help but keep laughing continuously at this scene. I'm loving this anime. <br>ya, you're hopeless.</br></br>  <br> Japan <br>Better keep looking.</br></br>  Lips make every female character 10 time better<br><br>We need more lips in anime</br></br>  <br> lol those lovebirds, so hopeless! <br> meanwhile... <br> "can't wait to get back to my porn video tonight!" <br><br>Don't let your dreams be dreams, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Already a thread, no need to make another one.</br>  <br> trying so hard to appear tough you start lying on the internet </br>  Same VA.<br><br>Yes</br></br>   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/<wbr>world/asia/japans-lower-house-passe<wbr>s-bills-giving-military-freer-hand-<wbr>to-fight.html?_r=0</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Coincidence?</br></br>  <br> Saki from Shinsekai Yori <br> Yukari from Yuyushiki <br> Ayaya from Kirino Mosaic <br>Is she going to be the new HanaKana?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not at all.

Where she just watched them talking.  <br> yfw there is literally a librlul "anti-abe" movement in japan who wants no war ever under any circumstances because lol war fuck the reason </br>  <br>I totally agree with you. This show could definitely use more gore, because you know... Chinese cartoons with sex and gore are for mature adults like us. Right? <br><br>Anyway, I honestly don't mind that they toned it down for the show. I think that they are still covering the things that most deserve coverage. The omissions haven't been major yet.</br></br></br>  <br>It's miles better than the manga, Rory is actually sexy here.</br>  Why the fuck was the horse making the noise of a baby crying?  <br>No, the male judges strip too.</br>  <br> It bugs me that the anime doesn't have the blood and guts that the manga does. <br>That's because you're edgy, and probably underage. The "blood and guts" added nothing, and was even a bit of a distraction.</br></br>  <br> It's miles better than the manga <br><br> Rory murders bandits with not a drop of blood in sight </br></br></br>  <br>Take off your /pol/ goggles dumbfuck, Abe's approval ratings take big hits from LDP voters as about much as any "librul" groups, it's pretty much across the board in Japanese society.</br>  <br>They have been, it mentions it later in the novel.

Don't Japs have a thing about showing your inner eyelid as being akin to sticking your tongue out?  <br>They do, but they also stick their tongues out while doing it.</br>  That scene was so much more dramatic in the manga  <br><br>The manga gives her the unexpected characterization of a girl who actually prefers long term relationships with interesting people.<br><br>Still, I bet it's quite a few.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that breast line thats not a smooth curve <br><br>Augh</br></br></br>    <br>Japanese people need more subtlety.

Not porn.</br>  <br> showing your inner eyelid <br>what?</br></br>  <br>Kicked her off, went back on, had some petty fighting and then settled for leaning on to him from the side.</br>    <br>Ah I'm silly. That makes sense.</br>  <br>That has got to be sad. Be in a long relationship with a human who you genuinely love. They die of old age. Eventually you find someone else, they die of old age as well.

Jesus, dude.</br>  Speaking of gestures.<br><br> pointing to an opened mouth <br>this is the international sign for fellatio</br></br></br>   she'll never climb on your lap   <br>Censor like a motherfucker.<br><br>My question is how are they gonna have Kubayashi beat the shit out of that bitch when they've made her look like a moeblob</br></br></br>  <br>The more I look at her, the more disgusted I am at the anime.</br>  <br>what's up with the awful editing?</br>  <br>I actually wouldn't mind it that much if they  cover the sex slaves with some rags and use sheets for the rape scene  I fear however that they just won't show it at all.</br>  <br>/ak/</br>  <br> you now remember there's an onsen scene when nearly all the girls' boobs are naked and uncensored <br> you now realize you won't see shit in the anime </br></br>  By the way, wasn't Lelei supposed to have silver hair or am I remembering it wrong?  <br><br>No. It was always blue. Because her family are aliens.</br></br>  <br>Also  Itami washing off Rory after her killing spree there. <br><br>I don't get why they went this way for the anime, doesn't fit the series at all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well fuck it the anime's not gonna live up to the manga or LN any possible way so I may as well fuck around with edits to enjoy myself. Was planning on doing a side story following the adventures of bane and cia in this magic world if I felt like it or it was received well. <br><br><br>Pic related(resized for file limit) is 1st(or 2nd if I plan on editing the invasion) and the 2nd(3rd?) is the one I did earlier with cia standing in front of the jeep titled "Gate: Thus The CIA Crashed There!" Tell me what you think took like an hour to make the bane exploitable since apparently no one bothered to make one before. <br><br>Also manga Rory is better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The anime made me pick up the manga again after putting it on hold.<br>Currently around the 4th tank.<br>Is the princess added to Itami's harem?  looks like it from the garden party. <br>Same with brown elf right? hope so at least, even if we already know who's gonna win.</br></br></br>  Leilei a cute<br>That scene with the horse was pretty underwhelming though.</br>  <br> That has got to be sad. Be in a long relationship with a human who you genuinely love. They die of old age. Eventually you find someone else, they die of old age as well. Continue for 900 years. <br>Well she only got 39 years left, so Itami is her last partner in this world.</br></br>  <br> That scene with the horse was pretty underwhelming though. <br>Most of it is</br></br>  <br> 720p </br>  <br> anime </br>  Blimey that .50 Cal was weak as shit<br>Sound design guys step yer game up</br>  <br> /a/ </br>  <br> Blimey </br>  <br>I'm not the only who think the anime art is a big improvement over the manga, right?<br>I like the manga but it's fucking ugly.</br></br>  <br> Not contrabanding your porn using fish <br>works everytime</br></br>  <br> contrabanding <br>You mean smuggling?</br></br>  <br>Yes, i do.</br>  <br>When you eat the porn to get rid of the evidence, it becomes contraband.</br>  <br>One more reason to dl shit instead of being a buyfag<br><br>lol "offensive to moral standards of reasonable adults". How did you determine who's a reasonable adult, cunt?<br><br>I fucking hate censorship</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How did you determine who's a reasonable adult, cunt? <br>Welcome to the redpill.</br></br>  <br><br>Redpillers are basically feminists, except that they serve male interests instead of female. They're a bunch of hypocrites.<br><br>They're not the good-willed, rational, egalitarian-minded people that are needed to weaken and ultimately destroy feminism, along with its bigotry, fear mongering, and double standards. Every time a red piller opens his mouth to speak on gender politics, it reinforces the idea in the minds of neutral observers that feminism is right and women are the victims.<br><br>"You're only as strong as your weakest link."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does this word even mean in Australia? When I see you guys writing things on the internet, I can only think that you speak a separate language than we do.</br>  <br>Will the Dark Elf waifu appear this season?</br>  <br><br>It means the same. Equate it to bitch in American English.</br></br>  I don't know what's more erotic.<br>The girls, the /ak/ porn, or a contemporary army wiping the fuck out of a stuck up and stubborn old one.</br>  <br> Rory doesn't win. Nobody wins in Gate. It ends with Itami and his harem stuck on the fantasy side. <br><br> Sequel has started, don't know what happened in the interval but it seems like nobody has made babies with Itami yet. </br></br></br>  <br>No I'm just not a retard.</br>   Show sucks <br> /a/ loves it anyway because it has a cute girl in it  <br>Every time. You see the same thing on /v/ and /co/ as well. It's amazing how willing people on this site are to forgive bad quality in exchange for some T&amp;A.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't mean the same. In American English, "cunt" is one of the last, most sacred dirty words that we have yet to dilute through mass, common usage.</br>  <br>   Rory doesn't win. Nobody wins in Gate. It ends with Itami and his harem stuck on the fantasy side. <br>Disgusting. But I guess expected from the country that has mastered unsatisfactory endings.<br> Is the sequel in form of LN or the standard Novel? Is it about him going back or dealing with stuff inside the gate? is he the only one? <br> Are these spoilers easily found in baka tsuki or something similar? </br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>It's really annoying how quickly people change their mind on a show just because of some cute girl and/or loli.</br></br></br>  <br>Show sucks in some areas but manages to do an alright job in others.<br>If you can ignore some plot elements, the nippon steel folded a thousand times propaganda, and other shit, it's an enjoyable dumb ride.<br>Although to be honest, I only expected /ak/ to watch it.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been having fun since the first ep</br>  <br> Not wanting assploding corpses. <br>Faggit.</br></br>  <br> I believe it's LN format. Just lurk around Gate discussion sites, like /a/ or Animesuki. Basically, Leilei figures out how to control Gate magic and they start opening Gates to try and find their way back to Japan and end up finding other alternate universes instead.    Bozes and Tomita have a kid though, so make of that what you will regarding Itami and his ever-growing harem. </br>  <br>did you miss the pol bait threads?</br>  <br>Why would that annoy you? Unless you base your own opinions on what /a/ thinks....?</br>  <br>I rather watch 1 mirrion Obama swordsmen than any redpilling /pol/ shit like oni-sama!</br>  <br>I don't know what /pol/ has to do with my comment, did you mean to reply to someone else?</br>  <br>The last part of your comment actually, back when the anime got announced, both /pol/ and /int/ fuckwards came in like rats, droving /ak/ away.</br>  <br>lmao<br>Can't find he panel from "Crecy" where the narrator mentions it's punctuation.</br></br>  <br>I don't follow vocal opinions on /a/ at all. (That's probably the worst thing to do).<br>But shit like this happens all the time, that's what I find annoying.</br></br>  <br> Shimoneta <br> runaway censorship and indecency laws gone crazy <br> thought crime <br><br> Monster Musume <br> promoting race-mixing and possibly bestiality <br> immigration of animal-like races of "humans" into human nations <br><br> Gate <br> Japanese nationalism <br> JSDF/Japan Army promotional material because Japan wants the ability to wage war again <br><br> Gakkou Gurashi <br> promotes delusion-enabling (the girl is mentally ill, and instead of making her confront reality, they try to accommodate her delusion, letting her live that way) <br><br> Joukamachi no Dandelion <br> only royalty can rule over us because they have special powers that we don't have bluepill </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, it's annoying because it's common? Are you also annoyed by commonly occurring buyfag and loli threads? I don't think you understand your own opinion.</br>  <br>Actually I like it because I enjoy the idea of a civilized democratic country using obscenely advanced technology to teach backwards authoritarian regimes the errors of their ways. Rory is just the icing on the cake</br>  <br>She looks much better in manga.<br>Hat doesn't look like ears.</br></br>  Best Girl  <br> face slapping <br> banned in australia <br>Literally worse than UK</br></br></br>  <br> You will never see her again so enjoy her. </br>  <br>No, the best girl would be Shino. Unfortunately, the anime has no Shino.</br>  The BDs will have all the censored parts right?<br>I doubt because if they do the average episode would move up from 22~25 mins to 35~40 mins.</br>  <br>I know it's polbait but whatever:<br><br> Shimoneta <br>I like the commentary, especially with japan right now passing decency laws in light of the 2020 olympics.<br><br> Monster Musume <br> nothing wrong with race mixing if the races aren't retarded or disgusting, especially if they are delicious like rachnee <br> immigration isn't retarded if the countries can't hold a steady birthrate, blame white people being cucked and not having babies <br><br> Gate <br>It's retarded as fuck in that front, but they tend to be like that. They are still a cuck country no matter what they wish to be, so whatever.<br><br> Gakkou Gurashi <br>Their priority is survival, if her facing reality makes the group be at risk (by her going into a panic attack and fucking up their safe area for example) then it's better to be conservative when making decisions such as that.<br><br> Dandelion <br>Power rules, if the population hasn't gone through revolution already it means they don't have the means to suppress them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's so sad that although she has good chemistry with Itami, she isn't in the running for Itami's dicking.<br>Cute as fuck.</br></br>  <br>What's annoying about it is the fact that it'll change in a instance and suddenly it's the new meme opinion. It's a really 'sigh and roll you eyes' moment.<br><br>As for those threads they can be filtered, I sometimes poke around the buyfag treads anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> the fact that it'll change in a instance and suddenly it's the new meme opinion. <br>Again, why does this inconvenience you?</br></br>  <br>Fuck you nigga, Elf best girl.</br>  Anyone else boiled with rage when  the prince mentioned the japanese slave? <br> Fuck, I just wanted the jsdf to deploy without mercy upon their ass. </br>  <br>She will appear again to deal with  monster prostitutes  and  Tuka's trauma , then when she and the rest of the squad disappear from the spotlight.</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>Great. Another anime to watch.<br><br>God fucking damn it.<br><br> How's the backlog? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By how much is being censored i doubt we will see her in the  prostitue saving  and she only was for some pages in the  trauma .</br>  <br>Try asking any American.</br>  anyone else thought those two female squad members looked like grown up versions of naru and hina?  <br>kekd and saved</br>  <br>They surely will be more similar to hostess, being seductive and all but not showing her nipples like the manga. About the other thing this episode made me feel the director has a soft for her so she should at least have a decent appearance secured (not that they'll give her more than a couple of minutes, obviously).</br>  <br> Why does inconvenience you? <br>I think you're mistaken, I've just grown sick of the same cycle. It doesn't overly 'inconvenience' at all. Surely you'd rather see a nice mix of opinions about something rather than a bunch of similar opinions that gives the impression that everyone is thinking the same?</br></br>  <br>MUH DICK</br>  <br>Here's the executable I made if anybody wants to play around with it.</br>  <br>You are this  Faggot, aren't you? <br> All depictions of violence are edgy hurr </br></br>  <br>I agree but when you say the anime anything is better than the manga on /a/ people start having aspie breakdowns.</br>  <br>Not him (and not that it matters), but the violence itself is not edgy, the edgy are the babies who believe that the series is worse just because there's not rape and guts.</br>  I was considering dropping it but the goth loli kind of peaked my interest a little.    <br>Remember /a/non, anime is for entertainment. If you start going OCD, just fucking drop some shit, it's not a fucking job</br>  <br> peaked my interest </br>  <br>961 years old.</br>  <br>So Australia has a giant warehouse of offensive and immoral content they have stolen.</br>  <br>Oops meant<br/></br>  <br> tfw they censored Rory's breasts. <br> mfw this is the result of the retarded pointless morafag law about depictions of naked DRAWN children being illegal <br> mfw it doesn't even matter she's the oldest member of the entire fucking cast </br></br></br>  Haha you guys are so easily pandered by cute girls.  <br>It's being "studied" by top men.</br>  <br>It directly impacts on the severity of the narrative. I didn't even feel real when the dragon's arm was cut off, let alone when her fuckhuge axe was slicing goons to pieces with nary a blood splatter. It will likely omit the 'we might have to give them out bodies' scene, and if they keep this shit up, the prince scene and consequential beating will also have no impact. The violence and rape is hardly hamfisted in GATE as it is in other shows, and to omit it adds nothing and only takes away.</br>  <br>I wonder if that warehouse actually exists. Imagine how box castles you could make in that fucking place. The 8yr old in me is getting shivers</br>  <br>My dick knows what it likes.</br>  <br> this <br><br>When Rory goes medieval on those guys, you know it's for a good fucking reason in the manga</br></br></br>  <br>No but i cant resist girls in military uniforms, my only weakness</br>  <br>Damn, man. You gonna cut someone with all that edge!<br>Go get wasted or something.</br></br>  <br>I had a feeling it was wrong, I'm so sorry anon I know I'm a failure ;_;</br>  Why is the opening so shitty.  <br/>  <br> Edge <br>...what? What exactly was edgy about that post?<br><br><br> And now we proceed to never get a rational reply </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone needs the gore to understand the severity of the situation depicted, but to each his own.<br><br><br>We already knew they were murderers.

Friendly reminder that the aesop of this arc will be that A1's original units were far superior to the game units. They will make you feel like shit for ever thinking Triad Primus or AnKira were better than NG or Candy Island and in the end things will go back to their rightful order as Evil Stepmom is deafeated and all the girls go back to their original, and objectively better, units.  <br>I want to shave off Nao's eyebrows</br>  <br>It was Bamco who came up with the anime units, not A1, and there are no default units in the game.</br>  <br>Nothing.

Maybe some anon's dad works at A-1 and decided to disband NG for the sole purpose of killing this monster that Scamco created.</br>  <br>Simply the best.</br>  <br> Yeah, I know. It's just weird that she wasted her time learning about them just to disband them a few days later.<br> Also, isn't this decision kind of shit for the producers?

Fuck A1.  <br> making new units <br> evil <br><br>Love Laika was the only good one.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But they gave us fat Kana.

Rin has both talent and personality, Uzuki has personality but little talent and Mio has neither.</br>  <br> You mean a group of bitches that complain if they feel they aren't getting enough attention?</br>  Still pissed at Horriblesubs for the first cour. Waiting for doki and I don't even care.  <br> Rin <br> personality <br> Even background characters have more personality than Rin.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ah, yes, the mother in Cinderella was very charming, wasn't she?</br></br>  <br> Rin <br> personality </br></br>  <br>I like how Karen was leading the conversation the entire time. Really shows how bland Rin is.</br>  Wouldn't, from a business perspective, disbanding all projects be a goddamn waste of money? especially at the same time?<br><br>I mean, first of all, there's all the PR you the projects. And then all there's the staff, the managers, etc.<br><br>An project doesn't even have to mean the units themselves as they're more used to help make new idol talents popular. Someone like Kaede wouldn't need to be part of any project as she wouldn't really need something like that.</br></br></br></br>  From a scale of 1 to Niagara, how moist did Riina get after hearing that guitar?  Shibuya Rin pleases old men for money!  Why the fuck do they need to buy their own albums?  Guys what if Producer gets fired...  <br>I want to meet Dooky's whole family and embarrass her in front of them by getting them to tell me about silly things she's done</br>  <br>for her family and friends</br>  Why the fuck did she only address NG?  <br>Main Character privilege.</br>  <br>That's what you do when you're trying to get started as a musical act. You buy a lot of your own merchandise to create false marketability. You buy tickets to your own concerts so that venues don't cancel them. You spend hundreds, thousands of dollars to make merchandise like t-shirts and CD's and stickers, etc. and then are basically expected to give them away for free because you're an unknown act.<br><br>Unless you're an adorable kid who's always been in it, that's how it works for everyone.</br></br></br>  <br> That's the only unit she knows.<br> Why do you think she disbanded all the units? Learning about them was too much work.</br></br>  SHIZUKU IS IN THIS?  Man, this Mishiro chick isn't as bad as I thought she'd be.<br><br>I mean, Kuroi was obviously insane but this one seems pretty alright.<br><br>Maybe she even met AkaP in America.</br></br></br></br>  Of course I didn't expect any major appearances right of the bat, yet this episode gave us the classic Kaede poster/ad service and even threw a few curveballs along the way.<br><br>Overall rating: Satisfactory 3 out of 5 cakes.</br></br>  <br>The woman even says she likes.<br><br> He's gonna be pegged. It's only just begun. </br></br></br>  <br> forgetting Sanae <br>are you fucking serious</br></br>  <br><br>also KWSM in a magazine</br></br>  Has the deremas special episode been ripped?  How jelly did Rin get when that bitch fixed TakeP's tie?  Just look at those juicy Kirarin titties.  <br><br>It's not meant to be an exhaustive list.<br> I have no idea what I'm doing. </br></br></br>  <br>Do not sexualise the Kirarin.</br>  <br>You sure don't jackass.</br>  <br><br>Just because you don't like her personality doesn't mean it isn't there.</br></br>  <br>This is a pretty common managerial thing to do really. When you have to take over another manager's position, especially in a big company, it's simply too much work to try and figure out how the old manager had everything set up and what their goals were and said goals might not be yours. So it's easier just to restructure everything to fit the new manager's vision.</br>  <br>No kidding</br>  <br>That police girl is 28? Holy shit that's even more unbelievable than Anzu being 17.</br>  <br> friends </br>  Why is her hair so fucking ugly? Why would they do this? She looks so much cuter with it down.  <br>Pretty sure she's too autistic to even care in the first place.</br>  <br> But her persoality is weak as fuck.<br> 99% of this episode was her showing no fucking expression while saying "we shouldn't do this, guys" and then you have that one scene of " Is being an idol tanoshii?" which is her only decent scene.<br> She isn't even kuudere or anything, she is jus fucking expresionless and her contributions to whatever is happening at the moment always makes you feel as if she is forcing herself to give a fuck about anythig.</br></br></br>  <br>They need more forehead exposure</br>  <br>I want to Happy Happy Kirari's Kiraris</br>  <br>Good eyebrow game is complimented by a huge forehead, that's a given.</br>  <br>Are we forgetting Wakaba being 20 or Shin being 26?</br>  <br> false marketability. <br>Buy you have to finance all these things yourself, everything you do is at a loss. <br>Balance sheets don't lie. All this can be subsidized by other endeavors just to keep it going.</br></br></br>  <br>It's her company, she can do whatever she wants with it. Just because you don't like it doesn't make her wrong</br>  <br>Her father's actually.</br>  <br>This was hardly noticeable. How autistic are you?</br>  <br>Doesn't change a thing</br>  <br>A funny otaku.</br>   No stalker <br> Sitting right there next to him <br>They should have kept Miyako</br></br>  <br>I can say the same to Miohaters.</br>  <br>It looks strange from the side. How the fuck does it even work.<br><br>Also, fuck yeah, Nao.</br></br></br>  <br>/@/?</br>  <br>What if I can't help it?</br>  <br>Cutest little ninjer.</br>   No Anya screentime <br><br>WHAT THE FUCK A-1</br></br>  <br>You can.</br>  <br>Makes sense.<br><br>Well, if she did study under Murrika and her dad owns the company, there's no reason for her to do anything that would devalue or hurt it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She is pretty sexual, though. I wouldn't mind making her a mom.</br></br>  Which ep Kaede will appear?  <br>headpats</br>  Miku NTR soon  Pick one.  <br>This is lewd as fuck, you should be ashamed of yourself.<br><br>...Saved</br></br></br>  <br>She's got a plan.

Members from established groups graduate and the groups fall out of popularity. That's usually when you see reorganization. <br><br>But I haven't cared about 3D idols for years, so what do I know.</br></br></br>  <br>I seriously forgot Anastasia existed for most of the episode.</br>  <br>Can't blame you, honestly.</br>  <br>She's Riina if she wasn't a poser.</br>  <br>It's only the first episode. We'll get our Anya stargazing episode eventually.</br>  <br>Make that three.</br>  <br>I'm going with cat anus on this one.

We also had some Anya/Ranko foreshadowing at the end of first cour, not to mention the Natsuki/Niwaka shenanigans. I wouldn't be suprised if Slut sisters and AnKira became a thing neither. Nana hasn't technically had her Marchen Debut yet so I wouldn't be too worried about Cutes  also there's always Momoka.  When it comes to Miria, Nina might play some role. <br>What I'm really wondering about is what will happen to the Walking Sex. I don't really see her joining the cakes. Will we get the long awaited Fumi/Kissdemon cameos or perhaps a Penus Syndrome?</br>  <br>Is there a fucked recording schedule?
