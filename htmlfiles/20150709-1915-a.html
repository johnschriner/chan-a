Considering Doflamingo has first-hand knowledge of the two new Admirals, it's likely Green Bull, like Issho was a rather famous civilian prior to even taking part in the draft or getting the DF he/she received, but Mr. Absolute Justice only cared about filling the gaping hole in the Marines forces that his promotion, Sengoku's and Garp's retirement and Kuzan's quitting left.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe if you stop speedreading you wouldn't be so confused</br>  <br>yeah man, he's dead.

Maybe they'll surprise us, but it's looking shaky.<br><br>OP:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UNj<wbr>HxhljAck</wbr>  [ ]<br>OP MV:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mW-<wbr>JAiZcGbU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It's been licensed by Sentai Filmworks, so even though it doesn't say it now, it's highly likely CR will be subbing this show. We've also got DameDesuYo and Vivid as the fansub options for the show.<br><br>After a pre screening in Japan a few days ago, someone wrote up a summary of the first episode: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s577<wbr>/sh/492c9cee-25e1-46db-89ec-12b4acc<wbr>36522/46ad5a60b0971771a8aa5ed04afbd<wbr>7fa The most important piece of information to be gleaned from this appears to be that, due to the original GG author being the showrunner of the anime, it appears the anime will move events around e.g. something that happens in Volume 4 happens in the first episode. We'll see if this is a good thing or not.<br><br>Who's excited for the healing moe SoL of the season?</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just making sure you know.</br>  <br> Miki and Yuki trying to squish themselves onto the cover </br>  <br>Poor Yuuri and Kurumi weren't even there the preceding time GG had a cover image for the magazine.<br><br>Also I love this image.<br> Yuki with her arms around Miki <br> Miki slightly blushing with a small smile <br> Kurumi with her legs on either side of Yuki <br> Yuuri's posture and her hand on Kurumi's <br> Megu-nee glowing and separated from the rest of the cast <br> The shovel's still there </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it's Rii-san who's saying "subarashii" in there.</br>  <br> tfw you'll never have a Megu-nee tulpa </br>  So how much anime do you watch on a daily basis?  At least one episode a day, at the minimum.<br>During the weekends I may spend the whole day finishing a series.</br>  About half way through this show.<br><br> And boy was I not ready for this suffering.This is some grade A suffering.This is almost cruel. </br></br>  <br>Literally what i came here to post.</br>  Luna best girl.  Would you a Were-Luna?  alright, i can see what the previous anon was saying about the show losing steam in the second half. losing focus. it was definitely better when it was about the ethics of being judge jury and executioner, rather than the internal crisis. I thought the first 6 episodes were really good though.  Show was ok. fuck bandwagon haters. I bet it was too early after madoka "masterpiece" and that's why it got all the hate.  I am really looking forward to seeing Polt animated, she is my favorite side character in the series. If anyone has more art or images of her, post them here for scientific purposes.<br>Also, discuss other topics relating to the manga and new anime! Did /a/ enjoy episode 1? What are you looking forward to seeing the most in episode 2, when Papi is introduced?</br>  <br>I feel like<br><br>and<br><br>are proof enough that it isnt forked, Miia seems to be pretty much a cold-blooded human in every aspect except that everything below the reproductive system is snake, and then the sides of the face have some scales and there are pointy ears.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> iirc </br>  It's only forked for comedy  <br>It's makes more sense to think of monstergirls as a sub-species of humans than to whatever animal they have a resemblances to. It also explains how humans are able to breed with every different kind of monstergirl.</br>  <br>True, even moreso with species like Lamias and Harpies that can only breed with humans, and are thus mostly human themselves.</br>  How do we stop all the retards from coming to /a/ I'm not sure if it's just me but it seems to have gotten worse.  Why haven't you watched this SOL masterpiece yet, /a/?<br><br>Anyways I'm pretty sure we're supposed to have Yuyushiki threads on Tuesday</br></br>  Is it wrong that I want to profusely fart all over the yuyus?  <br>I'd let Yui fart on me.</br>  Good night, /yys/.  Good morning (afternoon), /yys/  <br>Good night anon.<br><br>Good afternoon anon.</br></br></br>  No other pairing is better than them in their universe. Prove me wrong, /a/.<br>Protip:  You can't </br>        <br>That's true most of the times, but not in Satoshi and Mayaka's case. He was a fucking dick with her.</br>  <br>For someone who is constantly lazing around, Oreki has very little fat index</br></blockquote>]
