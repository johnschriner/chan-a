I don't normally do Senketsu. Are they good subs on good video?</br>  <br>How would you NOT be going full mast after all the shit Anna did to him?</br>  <br> This is the only slut /a/ likes <br>Anon...<br> Panty and stocking anime was aired 5 years ago <br>Oh</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a filthy secondary, but doesn't she turn out to have a penis?</br>  <br><br>How about you don't bring this bullshit to the new thread?</br></br>   Anna likes the MC <br> Kajou doesn't <br>Shit. Absolute shit. Anna doesn't have real feelings for him anyways, he just makes her pussy wet.</br></br>  <br>They look like shit if that's what you're asking.</br>  <br>Leave this shit in the previous thread dammit.</br>  <br> Not going after more than one guy <br> Madly in love with him, doing everything to get him love her back <br> Is not even aware that what she did was lewd and think it's just "pure love" <br><br>She's not really a slut anon. She kinda twisted from all the ignorance, but it's more like love full of lust.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know man, MC is a busta.</br>  <br>no, that's another character that we shall meet soon.</br>  <br><br>Yes. Kajo has a penis.</br></br>  <br>How was he not at full mast immediately after getting her wet panties on his face? It took far too long, he's a faggot.</br>  <br>It's the uncensored raws though, at least?</br>  <br>She's a pure slut? <br><br>It's ripped subs from the funi subs with a bit of editing I think.</br></br></br>  <br>No, people just use RAWs for the lols</br>  <br>less censored, yeah</br>  <br>she doesn't know she is a slut that makes it ok<br>I think</br></br>  Beautiful.  <br>Forgot<br> Tanukichi is /a/ </br></br>  <br>She's a pure girl that doesn't know what a slut is.</br>  <br>The day with the most Sex in it is X-mas</br>  I don't understand what's going on in this scene. I was told that women can not rape men. They are not physically strong enough and further that rape culture only applies to male assailants. <br><br>So what the fuck am I looking at? Is it consensual sex even though she tied him up and he was protesting for her to stop the entire time?</br></br>   Girl suddenly finds herself in love with MC <br> She jumps him and does a lot of shit to get him to notice her and love her <br> This somehow makes her a slut <br><br>Come on now guys, that's pure LUST, not slut, she's only going after Tanuki.<br><br>Also, how much of a heart attack would Anna's mother have if she found out what she did?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   anna is so pure that she doesnt even notice that shes a rapist turbo-slut <br>o-o-o-kay</br>  <br>It's easy to understand anon, it's  femdom <br>It's all pretend</br></br>  <br>You have to remember this is a japenese male who are weaker than japanese women.</br>  <br> this is the face of a rapist </br>  <br><br>Am I the only who hates Anna's breasts?<br><br>They look like shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your watching pure and righteous love.</br>  <br>poor girl cried all the way home from joy</br>  <br> women can not rape men <br>They certainly can.<br> rap culture <br>The fuck is this<br> is it consensual sex <br>Everyone on tumblr knows an erection implies consent.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not rape if he got a boner.</br>  <br>Why not have a bigger, better quality shadow?</br>  <br>Well, that's what you get when you hide all the info on how babies are born and society is basically banning biology in general.<br><br>Hell, just because Tanuki happens to know more about biology than the rest, his "moral evaluation" was considered the lowest.</br></br></br>  <br> implying /a/ likes Anna </br>  <br>I don't think those were tears but it's coming from her.</br>  Damn you Kajo they would have fucked the entire night if it werent for you.  <br>She only likes one guy: Not slut</br>    <br> women can not rape men <br> They certainly can. <br><br>"With respect to the crime of rape, Article 177 of the Penal Code provides that [a] person who, through assault or intimidation, forcibly commits sexual intercourse with a female of not less than thirteen years of age commits the crime of rape"<br><br>No. They literally can't. It's legally impossible for a woman to rape a man in Japan. This is also the case in China and Korea.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's not rape if she liked it <br>Protip: most women get wet and enjoy themselves regardless of who is pounding them.</br></br>  <br>is this how a penis should look like?<br><br>Help</br></br></br>  Is Clawhammer out yet?<br><br>I need the least censored sub</br></br>  <br><br>Nice trips.</br></br>  <br>I think she was there to stop the stalker. She just wanted the stalker to jump him and get naked so artist girl would get inspiration for her art.</br>  <br><br> 'ero terrorist' <br> scared at the site of a penis </br></br></br>  I dont give a shit what /a/ says this anime is fucking golden  <br>Nonsense anon, her love is but a pure one.</br>  <br> They certainly can. <br>No they can't. Unless you drug them, use some sort of object as a weapon or is an adult and the male is a child (a shota), rape by a woman is impossible.<br>Anna clearly did nothing of those, so it's consensual</br></br></br>  This show is going places.  <br>I'm not sure you know what a slut is</br>  <br> the site <br>Uh, I don't think it was the pubis mons that scared her.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, there are some people like that, they go around throwing dirty jokes no problem, but are giant prudes when something actually happens.</br>  Where are the doujins  <br>Oh yiss, classic yandere pose.<br>This gonna be gud.</br></br>  Will any scene top this one when it comes to lewdness or was this the maxicum?  <br> 5 years ago <br>Please kill me</br></br>  <br>Its clearly Okuma raping Anna here. We can arrive at this conclusion by process of elimination.<br>- This is definitely not consensual sex as you noticed yourself.<br>- Females raping males is not possible as  pointed out<br>- Okuma raping Anna is the only remaining option</br></br></br></br>    <br>Anna is no slut. She's chasing after one guy.</br>  Her heart pupils are quite unique. I don't know what the hell's up with heart pupils that are so appealing, even tough it's such a simple thing.  <br><br>You posted the exact same shit in the last thread.</br></br>  Was there penetration?  <br>Its because they arent just heart pupils. They are Vagina-Heart pupils with a hint of love juices.</br>  <br>Clawhammer is  just put the subs and the raw together</br>  <br><br>Think of all the cookies you could make with that.</br></br>  <br>That's not an orgasm, her water broke.</br>  <br>Extra moist cookies</br>  <br>It's like mindbreak, but with pure love</br>  <br>soon(tm)</br>  How are they going to un-nuts Anna.  <br><br>Yuno face edit when?</br></br>  <br>I'm trying to think of an episode with more lewd bodily fluids than this one, but I'm coming up blank. The envelope was so lewd it was almost gross.</br>   Trying to stamp out all lewdness <br> Wearing a low cut top that shows off your cleavage. </br>  Binkan-chan is the best girl  <br>nah, she's just drooling because she's starving</br>  <br>that's the trick. Make the lewd things non lewd, turning everybody into turbosluts without them even knowing</br>  <br>I bet she's just going along with what her husband wants but in reality she just wants the dick as bad as her daughter.<br><br> Big bad is defeated by having Anna's mother force her husband into bed with her and he finnaly remenbers how good it feels </br></br></br>  AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!  <br>while Anna assists</br>  <br><br><br>Anna's nymphomania is likely genetic, her mother'll probably be a mindbroken mess by the end of the show when she shows her true colors.</br></br></br>  <br> Anon raises hand after chastity speech <br> "So when am I allowed to leave this country?" </br></br>  <br>Can't spell LUST without SLUT.</br>  <br>I don't understand this shitposting, didn't everyone watch the same episode? Didn't they see that she tied his hands and feet up and covered his eyes? <br>Sheesh.</br></br>  <br> The gooks dont have freedom </br>  <br> /a/ <br> healthy sex life </br></br>  How can you people sit through this anime? The comedy is family guy-tier.  <br>He has to nut in her.</br>  <br> not cunt-a-doodle-dick <br>Missed opportunity tbh</br></br>  <br> /a/ <br> sex life </br></br>  It's such an obvious joke that Kajou would be a giant prude, but at the same time it's adorable.    <br>Shit OP</br>      No, they're never funny  I love these meme threads    <br> young girl telabort's child </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128576519 <br>shitpost material</br>        <br>Maybe if you post a fucking link to generator.</br>    What is this shit?    <br>I'll show you who's the editor of this paper</br>    Template?  <br> page 65 </br>    <br>What do the Canadians have to do with this?</br>    <br> PSP <br> not 3DS <br><br>shit taste</br></br></br></br>  <br> 3ds <br> good games <br><br>She also has a PS3</br></br></br></br>  <br>Young Girls Teleports Into Heart Of Young Man, Tragic Fatal Accident</br>    Link to generator please  <br>Not liking PSP/Vita?

Nana is going to will over 20k BD sales  I want my alpha Tsubasa back  <br> implying <br>This is still symphogeah and not Nanoha</br></br>  However, avant-garde airhead Sakimori is also great.   that Micha sex voice <br> mfw someone replicated Yukarin's voice so we'll have a backup if she ends up retiring or killing herself </br>  Tsubasa and Maria are the worst characters.  <br>I agree. Tsubasa is alright though.</br>  <br>It's okay, Hibiki. You'll be useful again soon. There's no need to be bitter.</br>  <br>No</br>  Hibiki is a huge pussy. I hope she loses some body part again.  What are the chances that Tsubasa will get a loli Kanade back through some alchemy means and she will have to take care of her as mama along either Maria or Chris?  <br>Stop it.</br>  <br>I'd rather have everyone being turned into little girls via a magic relic and Maria taking care of all of them.</br>  <br>Whats next people making a Busou Renkin thread and shitposting about Touka?</br>  Someone know when GLORIOUS BREAK will be released?  Genjuro or Maria: who is the better parent?  <br>Probably Maria.</br>  Is this a moe Tsubasa thread? I can get behind this.  <br> Maria. Genjuro is great, but I have a soft spot for the FIS girls and their chemistry and feel that Maria would be a seriously good mother. </br>  <br>Genjuuro. How is this even a question? Maria isn't even in parent mode yet, only onee-chan mode.</br>  <br>Genjuuro doesn't have any kids either, does he?</br>  <br>Genjuro duh.<br><br><br>Chris.<br>Bikki soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nana and Iguchi talking about how Tsubasa got more SAKIMORI in GX but then occasionally turns moe around Maria in the radio show all the time. </br>  <br>Neither. Genjuuro is the cool uncle, and Maria is the doting Onee-chan.<br><br> Best living Geahs. </br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for not watching GX.</br>    TAKANARE<br>JII BEAT</br>  <br>Soon<br> mfw we get JII JII JII </br></br>  <br>I want cute SoL with these three.</br>  <br> Loli Kanade still manages to be alpha as fuck and gets her Gungnir back </br>  <br>You're supposed to be calling Hibiki out, Shirabe, not imitating her.</br>  <br>Your wish shall be granted. She'll lose her buttcheeks.</br>  <br>I want Biki to save me while her gear whistles her heart out.</br>  <br>Good. Maybe now she can fucking stand up for herself.</br>  <br>Horrendous taste.</br>  <br>They are obviously getting set up to have their own spinoff.</br>  <br>The man has a legitimate relative that is Tsubasa which he constantly neglects. He may be cool and strong but in parenting terms fuck that guy.</br>    Who here /waiting for commie/?  <br>Micha's voice isn't exactly as arousing as Yukarin's though. There's a different feeling.</br>   1/3 of Kiri song is filled with DESS <br> mfw Shirabe might get the song with so many JII the preorder topped 1-6 place on amazon </br>  <br>Seeing manly Bikki turns me into a shy beta housewife.</br>  <br>Miku please.</br>  Fresh of the presses <br><br> Pls dont judge, I don't usually make these types of thing </br></br>  <br>How gay is Kirika's song anyways? Wonder if Shirabe can top it.</br>  <br>How will Maria deal with Chris rape PTSD?</br>  <br> which he constantly neglects. <br>Well, she's like 17, has her own career and is fully capable of defending herself. She's happy with her life, she's just a little socially awkward.<br>If anything, he's just following through with what he said in G.</br></br></br>  Please stay in your own threads and stop shitting up other threads. Thank you.  <br>This isn't the YuYuYu thread though.</br>  <br>She's 19</br>  <br>And that's why he isn't showing much concern, she can take care of herself(Just can't keep her room tidy).</br>  HIBKI CANNOT LOSE.  <br> no border stroke <br>That's not how it works you little  not-shit. </br></br>  <br>Lots of love and hugs and Apple lullabies  and food. </br>  Pour one out for mommu  <br>I bet Genjuuro gives the kind of hugs that crack your back</br>  <br><br>What was with that line about kirika being more sensible? Was that a HS screwup?</br></br>  <br>I want to  be forced to cuddle  with her in a big bed.</br>  <br>What are you implying?</br>  <br>That's japanese gold, over 300 years of experience, all the best to Mama.</br>  <br> She's happy with her life <br>Not thanks to him. The poor girl had a severe and glaringly noticeable guilt complex over the death of Kanade and was not receiving ANY sort of psychological support while being throwed constantly into dangerous battles. Then she got confronted to the idea of someone taking Kanade's place and Genjuro's answer was to punch her sword and tell her "she's your new partner, deal with it bitch" which in turn made Tsubasa suicidal.<br><br>Tsubasa's recovery is much more Hibiki's achievement than his. He was a terrible uncle.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It didn't make any sense at all.</br></br>  S1 <br> I don't want you to hide anything from me <br> Okay, I'm not hiding anything except this terrible state secret and will continue acting suspicious like a husband having an affair <br><br>G<br> I don't want you to fight <br> Thank you but I'm gonna fight anyway <br><br>GX<br> Okay, go and come back safely <br> Sorry, I was being a retard and got BTFO <br><br>Either Biki is trying her best to fuck with Miku or Miku have an ability to bestow the exact opposite of her goodwill onto people</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she's like 17 <br>She's 19 now.<br>All grown up.<br>Legally an adult.</br></br></br></br>  NANI SURU MONO DESS, SYMPHOGEAAAAH DESS   SCREW THIS WALL   <br> Average videogame AI </br>  <br>MAria is like 21 right? Then she shouldn't worry much about the whole idoll stuff, before she reach 25 the audience will consider her Old and Busted enough for her to be able to leave that career.</br>  Is it friday yet?

I don't know what it is but I can't feel the hype for this season. I want to be excited for it like I was for the first 2, but something feels off in GX. I can't put my finger on it. I will still be watching it no doubt, but this non-hype feeling for it is driving me nuts.  <br>Bikki has always treated Miku like shit</br>  <br>Ok, let's hope that in the Tsubasa screaming episode the dolls rip out Tsubasa's eggs and use them to impregnate Maria with the alchemy magic.</br>  <br>BAH GAWD KING, ANON JUST RKO'D THAT LITTLE WITCH</br>  <br>Did you remember to shut down your brain and don't think rationally how you usually do with other anime?</br>  <br>Artificial insemination is a thing<br><br>Alchemy/Phonic Gain/Magic is also an option in the Symphoverse</br></br></br>  <br>Of course. Maybe becasue I was expecting an overpowered enemy this season instead of a little girl with killer dolls, but i thought if it as a pleasant surprise. But something just feels off for me.</br>  <br> don't think rationally when watching Symphogear <br>My favorite meme.<br><br>I can't help but feel it's the slower people who get confused that always say this.<br>G had its stupid moments, but compared to other shows, it's not that egregious.</br></br></br></br></br>  When are we going to get the obligatory training episode?  <br>They have a girl thanks to iPS technology.<br><br>How would she look like?</br></br></br>  <br>Sing a song with my buddy about magic, miracles and how scientists are always lying and pissing me off.<br><br>Then use the PHONIC GAIN to erect a giant tower like the one in S1 before blasting us off into space and crashing into the sun.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Chris will be all flustered because she wants to show off in front of DMJii but she just can't because she sucks at P.E.</br>  <br>My favourite meme is the one where we pretend Chris is pure.</br>  <br> After Genjuuro dies. </br>  <br><br>I need another "Chris is not physically fit" training montage<br><br>Bonus points if she has markedly improved from G, but still lags behind even DMJii and Maria</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3Fb<wbr>uhH7p4jw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah, show is really good at making sense in it's own silly way. Still, it's better when people don't even try to understand it and just want to enjoy the ride rather when they try to, but somehow completely fail at it and we get second best meme, shit writing.</br>  <br>Maria is pretty fit.<br>Look at dem legs.</br></br>  <br>Well, I can't say I am hyped for the plot so far<br> Here are these enemies on a completely different level from anyone before. They just didn't do anything because they didn't feel like it! Luckily, we can upgrade our symphogears to counter their symphogear-breaking alchemy, thanks to this little girl which defected and holds the relic we need. <br><br>But the plot is hardly the reason anyone watches symphogear, anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really care how people watch it, but when they say "hey, just turn your brain off" one day, and then "what the fuck this is stupid I don't understand" the next; that's just retarded.<br><br>Of course you won't understand if you turn your fucking brain off, whatever that means.</br></br></br>  <br>Fit for breeding that is.</br>    <br> Hopefully next episode since we don't need to worry about Hibiki questioning her reason for singing,and project ignite is going to go into effect the girls are going to need to do something while they wait for the repairs to finish.</br>  <br>She's fit enough alright. It's just that her zenbus drag her down.</br>  <br>You mean the others train while Hibiki is in the hospital.</br>  <br>I want to see Tsubasa and Maria trying during the training the famous "Chris crotch into Hibiki face" move.<br><br>Just imagine Maria pushing her smelly crotch into blushing Tsubasa face, or Tsubasa blushing trying to push her sword in one decisive move into Maria who wasn't ready to receive it.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell me those are sakura petals on her skin.</br>  <br>A  sword  bit her.</br>  <br>It's cowpox.<br>Because she has saggy lardbags.</br></br>  You see that nigga turnin<br><br>You feel the relic burnin<br><br>Nigga now you learnin</br></br></br></br>  <br> Her shorts are still on and so is the front of the shirt . She was still wearing Gungnir when she fell so she'll shown to be just fine next episode.</br>  <br>I just assumed those are two different kind of retards. I hope that's the case.</br>  <br>She was completely naked in the following shot when Miku rushed over to her</br>  <br>Hibiki was kinda cool here again for a minute or two before she got turned into a vegetable</br>  <br>That was just for the viewers</br>   tfw no brutal gungnir onee-chan   <br>Why is she so manly?</br>  <br>Log.</br>  I wanna see a Symphogear made from Pandora's Box. it'd be equivalent to Salior Saturn as the Symphogear of destruction.   inb4 the damage on gungnir was so severe it cracked open a layer of seal that's been preventing ZENRYOUKU SENKAI   <br>I want all the Gungnirs as my family<br><br>Maria onee-san<br>Hibiki daughteru<br> Kanade Waifu </br></br></br></br></br>  So how long do you think it took for someone to offer Maria a handkerchief .  <br>Tsubasa pls</br>  <br> Not licking it off. </br>  <br>Are her cat ears getting bigger?</br>  <br>Probably a bit, I wouldn't approach a person with strawberry jam on her face walking casually.</br>  <br>Why contain it?</br>  <br>Hair grows.</br>  Why is Hibiki such a bitch  <br>She went full retard. Maria saved her ass and she went all muh Gungnir, she better apologize later.</br>  <br>She apologized immediately afterwards, but Hibiki very much went full retard.</br>  <br>I love how she was JAMing the entire time. Made the whole scene look incredibly awkward</br>  <br>She apologized right away. Hibiki feels useless when she can't fight so when Maria took the Gungnir and used it she panicked and thought she might get replaced.</br>    <br> I don't want to fight <br> but if I can't fight I get cranky <br><br>How does Miku tolerate this girl</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can I have you and your uncle in my family Tsurugi-san</br>  <br>Hibiki's not having a good battle record this season</br>  <br>But no blood.</br>  I almost forgot there were other dolls  <br>Hibiki is good in bed and that's enough for Miku.</br>  <br>S'cool.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I'm still wondering how you people fail to understand her feelings, her character, her story and history, and her motivations.<br>It's like you don't care about characters at all apart from using them for your masturbation fantasies.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only 157 posts in <br>I think this is a new record.</br></br>  <br>bait</br>  <br>Miku is the real villain this season, I hope she doesn't cheer for the other girls.</br>  <br>My fucking nigga.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they had to make her look vulnerable, if it was another season of punching everything to death and arm regeneration it'd be superman syndrome.<br>  There was not a man watching that last fight who expected Hibiki to lose straight after TAKANRE, my outlook on life was shifted. </br></br>    <br>If I were Sally I would look for Anne because clearly that bitch ran off with my ball, I saw her eyeing it and now she's no where to be found.</br>  <br>    There was not a man watching that last fight who expected Hibiki to lose straight after TAKANRE, my outlook on life was shifted. <br><br>Are you kidding? It was obvious the moment she started apparently curbstomping the strongest member of a group who are all suppose to be stronger than the current Gears.</br></br></br>  DESS a dumb.  <br>I get the feeling she's gonna blame herself a lot after this.</br>  <br> my precious </br>  <br>It will be daijoubu.</br>  <br>The only thing Miku has to blame herself for is being friends with Hibiki.</br>    I really hope we start getting some conflicts where it at least seems like the outcome hasn't been decided in at advance. I want to feel tension from the battles and schemes unfolding, not at wondering how depressed the cast are going to be after they're hospitalized from the next categorical loss.  <br>why is gary so best doll?<br><br>the more I see her the more I like her</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to shit on Nanoha threads.<br><br> Oh wait. </br></br></br>    GARIE IS CUTE<br><br>CUTE</br></br>  <br> who are all suppose to be stronger than the current Gears <br>Yeah about that. I credit them as be very effective against Gears but i will hold my opinion on if they're stronger. Gears have punched/blasted chunks of the moon, scalped mountains and German Suplexed a Space Shuttle. Nothing the Autoscorers have done come even close. They only perceived advantage so far is being able to decompose Gears which yeah, make them really dangerous but not necessarily "stronger".</br></br>  <br>You're saying you know that Hibiki was going to lose straight after the peak of her song?<br>I knew there had to be some trickery or something that'd make her lose, it was michas first fight and it's only ep 4, but I thought there was gonna be more too it than that<br>  It was great though I'm not complaining, I was just looking forward to some serious phonic gain </br></br></br>  <br>Time to fap</br>  I just realized i missed a fuckhuge thread yesterday because I forgot horrible subs caught up and aired already.  <br>Have you not been watching?</br>  <br> There won't be any decent porn of the autoscorers </br>  <br>They also seem to be immune to Gear attacks. Every time a Gear attacked a doll so far the doll sustained zero damage.</br>  <br>I was about to make a snark comment about fapping to dolls but then i remember the anons who posses figures. This is weird.</br>  <br>Yesterday was insane. Two 600+ threads and a 1200+ thread, on an already crazy episode</br>   Garie Tuman <br> Micha Jawkan <br> Phara Suyuf <br> Leiur Darahim <br><br>I was worried they'd suck, but it turned out the alchemists side are so good they deserve their own series. I enjoy seeing them more than the main cast.<br><br>Also Phara and Leiur can go die for all I care near the end of the season, but damn Garie and Micha better stay alive, join the main cast, and become maid or something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Can someone talented make a 'Hype thrusters activate' gif/webm with michas hair rockets firing up    tfw tsubasa was all "muh emotionless bladed deathseeker philosophy" after kanade died <br> Tsubasa tries to suicide bomb Chris <br> can't even do that right.jpg <br> Spirit Kanade tells her to cut that shit out <br> She stops beings a bitch to hibiki <br> I start to like her again <br><br>Has this happened to anyone else yet? also i started watching yesterday and im on ep8 now does it get better in the later season? also Miku a shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah but that seems more them being able to debilitate the Gears attacks rather than being stronger than those. The moment one of them lifts a building or cut a city in half i'll recognize their strenght.<br><br>So far they only have "Gear immunity" as their main feature. The moment the girls can bypass that restriction the dolls will get curbstomped unless they show some real strength.<br><br>I wonder when some of them will lift a building or cut an entire stadium in half.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also Phara and Leiur can go die for all I care near the end of the season, but damn Garie and Micha better stay alive <br>This.<br>Garie and Micha &gt; old hags</br></br></br>  <br>She's basically Nui with red hair.</br>  <br>Literally everyone. Also don't be mean to Miku.</br>  <br>Going by Model# Micha is the oldest.</br>  <br>Hey, thats mean</br>  <br>Throw Genjuro at them. Genjuro &gt; Autoscorers &gt; Geahs &gt; Noise &gt; Genjuro</br>  <br> The moment one of them lifts a building i'll recognize their strenght <br>You mean throwing around multiple boats isn't enough? If not, I am sure they can do more.</br></br>  <br>In looks maybe, but Gary got the personality.</br>   Garie tries to suck a geah's memory <br> she resists and fights back <br> kissu battle with implied tongue action </br></br>  <br>Hibiki also needs Spirit Kanade to appear and tells her to stop being a whiny bitch.</br>  <br>They're murderers, and worse, Garie's a genuinely horrible bitch. I don't see her surviving; she'll probably make herself the sacrifice to summon her true master or whatever it is she's plotting after Hibiki thwarts her.</br>  <br>it's not the age that matters, it's the appearance</br>  <br> Genjuro &gt; Autoscorers &gt; Geahs &gt; Noise &gt; Genjuro </br>  <br>That was actually impressive but that was a summon isn't? I'm amused who did it and if they can summon more stuff.<br><br>Still not close to scalping mountains and wrestling spacecraft but it's a start.</br></br></br>  <br>why is Spirit Kanade so based other than y'know being a spirit</br>  So we all know elf9 is going to fuck everyones shit up with evil swords right?<br>She's bad guys.</br>  WHY ISN'T MIKU FUCKING HIBIKI EVERY FUCKING NIGHT<br><br>THE GIRL FUCKING LOVES FISTS</br></br>  <br>It's not her fault, her memories were manipulated by Carol, just like Carol's are being manipulated by Garie.</br>  <br>She's either bad or unknowingly helping Carol, since the memories and knowledge given to her is limited to whatever Carol deemed necessary.</br>  <br>Elf9 is a good girl.</br>  <br>Samefagging a bit, if you notice none of the Gears was desicively defeated in combat by any of the autoscorers.<br><br> Chris &amp; Tsubasa got decomposed. <br> Maria suffered Sync problems the whole fight. <br> Hibiki got double teamed and decomposed. <br><br>Those dolls will be utterly screwed once the girls get in form to fight fairly with them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if they can summon more stuff. <br>Probably not. The "summon" was Leiur's little sister that's mentioned in the official site.</br></br>  <br>She is being manipulated and her story arc for the next of the season will be about trying to redeem herself.</br>  <br>They aren't trying to kill them, or even to hurt them much. They want them alive with broken gears.</br>   post yfw dolls were scripted to die before the making of this show <br> post yfw huge popularity is making the studio reconsidering it <br> post yfw the studio solved this by having the scorers' memory reformatted when Carol is befriended <br> post yfw dolls ended up being enrolled to Biki's school and join the SONG ranks <br> post yfw they still retain their combat strength and personality enough to act as reinforcement and fighting alongside their respective GEAH users against a bigger threat next season <br> post yfw the SoL part will also feature them picking fights and bullying other main cast <br><br> I just want to dream ;______; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not about power levels, it's about the arms race of weapon development.<br><br>Gears were developed as anti-Noise weapons. Conventional forces get slaughtered because their attacks can't touch the Noise, while the Noise just have to touch them to carbonize them. While powerful in other ways, the special trait of Gears is to counter those two advantages. That's why they blow through Noise like they were nothing.<br><br>From all indications, the Autoscorers and Alch-Noise were developed as anti-Gear weapons. Alch-Noise have their focus shifted from carbonizing organic to inorganic materials; that's why they do more terrain damage and can disrupt the Gears themselves. Autoscorers are just built from the ground up to combat Gears. They're agile, adaptable, and don't have any of the weaknesses Gears were made to exploit.<br><br>Now the next step is to install Ignite upgrades on the Gears so that they're better equipped to deal with the new opponent. Of course, that might be a trap, but it's still the logical next step.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Poor Maria. <br>It's hard to be a 33 year old adult woman in a cast full of teens.</br>  <br>Still the "strongest" of the dolls ahd to be bailed out from Hibiki's fists (a stressed/confused Hibiki i must add). Not a good omen for them once their anti-Gear tricks stop working.</br>  <br>Where do the dolls fall into this arms race scheme?</br>  <br>She didn't actually seem to be hurt by that punch.</br>  <br>The autoscorers are inhuman bakemonos who have killed hundreds of people. They won't get off scot-free.</br>  <br> 33 <br>wat</br></br>  <br>But she's 21.</br>   bitch <br> noun <br> slang <br><br> a malicious, unpleasant, selfish person, especially a woman. </br></br></br></br>   tfw no perplexed zenbu.gif   Miracles!  did chris have another gear ordid nehustan change forms?  <br>ya just like Vers did, and he tried to destroy the Earth too<br><br>The autoscorers have the benefit of being (cute) girls in addition of that, they'll live</br></br></br>  <br>I covered that. Dolls = Autoscorers.</br>  <br>21 in cat years.</br>  <br>She was just borrowing Nehushtan, Ichaival is her own gear.</br>  <br> muh hibiki diddu nuffin rong </br>  <br>So, 2 years old?</br>  <br>Point remains she was unable to fight back the rampage and has to be assisted to finish the fight quickly. the other dolls also weren't able to get any upper advantage combat wise until they summoned the Alche-Noise.<br><br>So far i'm having trouble buying the suppossed superiority of the dolls in a fight. But you're correct on that it's still early to give a judgement. I want the dolls to do some truly impressive shit that justify them being feasible rivals for the Gears in combat. They're durable and can nullify Gears to some degree but by themselves they don't seem very strong in comparison.<br><br>As some other anon said, judging only by what's shown any of the dolls would be utterly obliterated by Genjuro in front combat. The guy punched a meteor for god's sake. Calling a "sister" that lifts boats is child's play compared to that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> girls </br>    <br> Autoscorers <br> Girls <br><br>They're dolls anon. It's entirely justified to destroy them (destroy, not kill as they aren't alive to begin with).</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying that matters when you're going to fist it anyway </br>  <br>You said it Crack-kun<br>Hibiki a perfect</br></br>     mfw Genjuro is literally Akuma from street figter <br><br>god fucking dammit</br></br>  JAM friends.  <br>Which face would you like anon, I'll help, are you angry?</br>  <br>Garie's near-instant dislocation was impressive. If you consider Leiur's imouto as one her battle assets that's pretty impressive too.</br>    <br>a happy face, if you would my fellow anon</br>  <br> title of the episode was Gungnir Once Again <br> people were speculating whether it meant that Maria would put on the Gungnir again or that Hibiki would transform again <br> it was both </br></br></br>  <br>Maria's popularity sure seems on the rise this season. I'm totally okay with that.<br><br>(It helps she passed the cursed Relic of Uselessness off to Hibiki and can be cool again.)</br></br></br>  <br>Since the matchup is obviously going to be<br>Garie vs Maria<br>Micha vs Kiri-Shirabe<br>Phara vs Sword<br>Leiur vs Chris<br>Carol vs Biki<br><br>does this means<br><br>wait<br><br>guys<br><br>what if<br><br>guys<br><br>what if<br><br>Leiur imouto vs motherfuckin' Genjurou?!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Happy enough?</br>  <br>But she was cool and useful with the same Gungnir just this episode.</br>  <br>Agreed. Kanade really had her bitch under control.<br><br>Is Kanade the manliest geah in history? I personally believe she would out-manly Bikkie too.</br></br></br>  <br>You did it anon. You now overloaded my hype gear. I don't believe it will happen, but I want it so fucking mcuh.</br>  <br>Why do you Maria fans feel the costant need to shit on other characters when talking about her? Do you guys have some kind of inferior complexity?</br>  <br>ありがと!<br><br><br> tfw i relate more to kanade when it commes to being chill more than the other characters </br></br></br></br>  Will GX finally have a scene that will surpass FIRST LOVE SONG from S1?<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/ilkwzxqsrz.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br>  <br>Sup sis</br>  <br> Leiur imouto throws ships/boats again <br> "pshh I can do better than that" <br> Genjurou throws SONG submarine at her <br><br>I dont know why but I'm too excited imagining it</br></br></br></br></br>  Post smiles worth protecting  <br>I might as well ask why Biki fans are so oversensitive and defensive.<br><br>Smug Maria is hot and Useless Maria is moe. I can love them both. Why can't you embrace the Useless Hibiki? She's get another training montage and be Hotblooded Biki again soon enough.</br></br></br>  <br>The one that can't be protected anymore.</br>    <br>Why couldn't you protect this one?</br>  <br> I might as well ask why Biki fans are so oversensitive and defensive. <br><br>Because it's been four threads of non-stop shitposting, after a while I feel it annoying too.</br></br></br>  <br>Cause kanade sexual</br>  I hope that HYPE THRUSTERS ACTIVATED edit of Genkai Toppa G-Beat will be in the OST.  <br>Actually older women sexual.</br>      <br>CRIMINAL<br>THIGHS</br></br>   I will never get to play a sympogear fightan game <br>whenever hibiki fights I want it</br>  <br> four threads <br>I wish, it's been going like this for a week already.</br></br>  <br>It'd turn out like ninja storm or at best pokken</br>  <br>This, it's just getting tiring. I don't think it will improve any time soon, though, given how much manufactured hype they're selling us about the gears truly being at risk and so on, both in the show and in promo shit.<br><br>I get that having them be down and out along the way makes the payoff worth it when they win, but you can do that without it feeling predetermined as you said.</br></br></br>    <br>Do you think she stole Tsubasa's first kiss and we don't know anything about that?</br>  <br>Useless Maria was so dominant in the second half of G that a lot of people forgot how sexual Smug Maria was.<br><br>I'm not sure we're actually back to Smug Maria, but she's definitely not Useless anymore, which is good.</br></br></br>  <br>This, Gary and Micky are basically Nui split in two.</br>  <br>I want Maria to be angry at me</br>  <br> manufactured hype <br>You guys never stop coming up with hilarious terms.</br></br>  Symphogear? More like NYMPHOgear.  <br>I don't think there's any chance she didn't.</br>  <br>It wasn't just her first kiss she stole.</br>  <br>I want to believe.</br>    <br> that slight belly peek </br>  <br> a sword with flat chest and flat ass like Tsubasa is allowed to own this bombshell body <br><br>This is not fair.</br></br></br>  <br>Even useless Maria was pretty sexual.<br>I don't think she can be not sexual with that body.</br></br>  <br>Play that 3DS game where Hibiki stel the heart of the Inifnite Stratos Girls.</br>  <br>Yeah, show so far is full of manufactured hype, forced drama, shit writing, pedobaits and yuribaits.</br>  <br>All these buzzwords and you don't even mention the forced cliffhangers?</br>  <br> Well, I can't say I am hyped for the plot so far <br> &gt;Here are these enemies on a completely different level from anyone before. They just didn't do anything because they didn't feel like it! Luckily, we can upgrade our symphogears to counter their symphogear-breaking alchemy, thanks to this little girl which defected and holds the relic we need. <br> But the plot is hardly the reason anyone watches symphogear, anyway. <br><br>That's like my tokusatsu shows!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> flat <br>81/57/83<br>She's not flat!</br></br></br>  <br>My manboobs beat her girlboobs by 3cm, kek.<br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>True, but it's a relative measure. If I want cute vulnerable sexual, Chris does it better. A lot of Maria's appeal for me is that she's the All Woman of the cast (by Symphogear standards).</br>  <br>Manufactured hype is about at old is "fun is a buzzword" in   the Fightan Game Community  <br>  Truly, video games are suffering </br></br>  <br><br>Taking every chance you get in an interview or sound byte to doom and gloom about how the gear users are in danger of losing, and deliberately dropping hints about the dreaded episode 7 everywhere, is absolutely manufacturing something.

"Hype" describes the audience's anticipation or reaction. I'd say it's generated "naturally" by PVs and promo materials. In this case there are these specific perceptions they're trying to instill in the audience, to the point that people are repeating  episode 7  like meme and biting their nails over nothing when obviously all the gear users are going to survive.<br><br><br>Bike-kun #1738  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else here enjoying GX more than the first two seasons?<br><br>I feel like I shouldn't but everything is just so hype. Not to say I don't love the first two seasons though.<br><br> This is quite possibly because I didn't watch the first two as they were airing. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad, when it comes to older, forceful women Tsubasa is the sub in bed.</br>  <br>I actually like first season more. S2 was an absolute piece of turd smeared with horse diarrhea. S3 looks promising. I personally watched all seasons while airing.</br>  <br> grown up man voiced by nana in a spanish speaking country. <br>why do i want this?</br></br>  <br>I was enjoying the idea of Tsubasa being the dom despite being younger very much, but I guess the anime isn't going for it.</br>  <br> PVs and promo materials <br>I don't believe interviews and other types of publicity are any "less natural". They are all intentional actions by the producers aimed at the viewers with the intent to increase their expectations for the upcoming episodes. Some are aimed at more hardcore fans and some are aimed at wider audiences, but they're the same in nature.<br><br>Also, pretty much every anime does this sort of publicity. It's the standard, Symphogear is not exceptional in that regard. People become extremely hyped with Symphogear because there have been two seasons and in general their hype has always been rewarded with loads of fun and excitement. People just really like the show. That's a good reason to be hyped as far as I'm concerned.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, yeah. Ep 7 is now a meme, but it's not the worst we have. And it's not like I'm hyped about Ep 5 because of it. Sure, I'm curious what will happen, but waiting for next episode seems to be that normal kind of hype, and it's what I feel right now.</br>  <br>S1 had more of a soul and I can't bring myself to like Carol and the dolls anywhere near as much as the FIS girls, but beyond that, GX on average is pretty close to matching S1's peak levels so far.</br>  <br>My problem's not whether the "hype" is real or manufactured or whatever, it's there seems to be no give-and-take in the show's conflicts. Everything effortlessly going the villain's way until the grand finale is just as unengaging as the opposite. I want to feel that the battles and other conflicts actually matter, not that they're just obligatory setup for suffering scenes.</br>  will her next character CD feature another enka song?<br><br>it fucking better</br></br>  <br>She's can be the dominant one outside the bedroom.</br>  <br>First season is still the best since the threat of characters being killed off seemed very real and angsty Chris and Tsubasa were great. <br><br>GX is way better than season 2 though.</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.symphogear-gx.com/produc<wbr>ts/GXcharactersong03.php<br> 02. 空へ… <br> Into the sky... <br>Sounds like some sad ballad or something</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I don't think Carol will keep having the upper hand for long though. She might, of course, but we're still at episode 4, it's too soon to be making that sort of critique.</br>   That whistling <br><br>I want to become the little bitch of a person like that.</br></br>  <br> Everything effortlessly going the villain's way <br>You're basing that off of the first 4 episodes in a season where the antagonists are supposed to start with a big advantage.<br><br>What does "actually matter" even mean to you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode seven is being sold as a huge suffering explosion, and we also have very strong suspicions that the supposed "upgrades" are yet again part of her plan all along, so even if they seem to give Chris and Tsubasa an advantage, it'll end up as a more long-term version of the water clone "We were just pretending you were winning!".</br>  <br>Suffering doesn't necessarily imply everything will go according to Carol's plan. See episodes 11 and 12 of S1 where they drove suffering to the max by having Chris and Tsubasa 'sacrifice' themselves to successfully stop Fine's big plan.</br>   mfw the only way for Tsubasa and Chris to use their gears is to become hybrids like Bikkie was in season one.  <br><br>That would be an actual fucking plot twist. Forcing Tsubasa and Chris to have to have relic shards in them to even attempt to get shit done.</br></br>  <br>Everyone gets the new pendants though.</br>  <br>Episode 4 tells us that? Since I can't into moon I haven't seen episode 4 yet. I have to wait for subs like a peasant.</br>  <br> Everyone goes berserk all according to Carol's plan <br> Everyone but Bikki <br> "Why won't you turn like them?" <br> Bikki shrugs as if berserk mode is any relevant to her anymore and does some speech about how everyone always helped her out during those times and now it's her turn to turn the favor <br> She fistes everyone </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But subs are already out.</br>  <br>The OP does.  Admittedly, there is still the possibility of the OP being a bait&amp;switch, but we know which possibility is more likely at the moment. </br>  <br>Wait what. Fuck. Can I be a spoonfeeding faggot and ask for where to find them? I just wait for  memecartel </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>These are the official website chara designs. Everyone has the pendants with the new wing design in them.<br> NEW GEARCONVERTER MODEL </br></br>  <br> Implying they have budget for 2 OPs </br>  <br>That would be sweet. It would help Bikkie's maturity majorly. <br><br><br>I'd put money on it not being a bait and switch. Now that I think about it, I can't even remember GX's OP. I'm terrible at this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're in nyaa like every other sub out there.</br>  <br>CR is simulcasting. That is all the info you should need.</br>   not trusting Genjuuro to only give the girls safe gear teach, or, if there is a danger, being up front and telling them about it <br>Whatever the shocking twist behind the new relics are, eventually they'll be harassed properly and help the gears win.</br>  <br><br>Nice timing.</br></br>  <br>The current OP feels very cheap and Exterminate really doesn't suit it, so I'm not ruling it out just yet.</br>  <br> harassed properly <br>D-don't touch Dainsleif-chan there!</br></br>  <br>That the tension lies in how the battles or other conflicts go, not in how badly the characters will be fucked up after they lose. So far, every single thing they've done except for Hibiki refusing to fight has been playing straight into their hands, and with the obviously-a-trap "upgrade" that doesn't look set to change any time soon. Losing is fine, but when it goes on for half the series, at least throw some kind of bone towards pretending that there are two sides to the fight.</br>   Just saw doctor-chan get shot <br><br>NOOOOOO!!!!!<br><br><br>Yeah, i agree. That shit gets annoying</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cheers. I apologize for being useless.</br>  <br> trusting Genjuuro to only give the girls safe gear tech <br>He allowed this to happen</br></br>  <br>Blast my tohou music</br>  So far Carol's plan involved just destroying gears, so it would be hard to really mess with them. And even so we got it twice (Bikkie's problems and Maria being so useless it was actually helpful). I don't think everything will go according to keikaku just because girls will get their gears upgraded. Also, we still have DMJii, they probably won't get ignite as soon as other girls.  <br><br> Type X-1 <br> Model PR <br><br> Dansleif the ratio 10.23% </br></br></br></br></br>   purpose is to defeat symphogears <br> symphogears stop working and the hero is extermely vunerable <br> i cant fight like this, i'll come back when your powers return <br><br>why is this allowed?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her plan is pretty obviously to force them to use the cursed sword.</br>  <br>Because otherwise they would be no story. Why do you have to be so autistic? If you want good writing go read a book, nerd.</br>  <br>Because the purpose is to break the gears, not the users.</br>  <br> playing straight into their hands <br>Nothing other than that is even supposed to be happening. We can see that it's a trap, but the characters currently only see it as a necessary risk because they are not doubting Elfnein or any of the current events in the slightest.<br><br> at least throw some kind of bone towards pretending that there are two sides to the fight <br>It's supposed to be onesided right now though. If your first sentence is anything to go by, you may be looking for the wrong things in the first place in these 4 episodes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They need to break the gears but leaves the Geahs alive so that 9/11-kun can help upgrade the relics with Dainsleif and make them all go berserk while singing the song to end the world</br>  <br> modes 1 to 4 </br>  <br>but then the gears get fixed and the bad guys get btfo??? i dont see how this story could get anymore interesting <br><br>my autism flares up when plot holes suddenly appear in a good story</br></br></br>  <br>You don't get away with writing an unengaging conflict by saying "but it's supposed to be unengaging".<br><br>Of course they're only playing into her hands because they don't realize they're playing into her hands. Why on earth else would they? That doesn't change the fact that an effortless conflict where you never think one side has a hope even of a minor victory, even one they don't end up winning, is neither meaningful nor interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>The gears are getting fixed with the shards of an evil sword. If you don't see how this is going to develop you are blind.</br>  <br> symphogeah <br> good story </br></br>  <br>because they need the power of the gears</br>  <br>THAT'S WHY PEOPLE SAY ELF9 IS A FILTHY SPY THAT IS GOING TO MESS WITH THE GEAHS<br><br>REMOVE THE LOLI SCUM</br></br></br>  <br> but then the gears get fixed <br>With a magic demon sword that will obviously corrupt the users and fuck up things big time</br></br>  <br> ??? </br>   Custodians  when?  <br> no hole down there <br> loli </br></br>  <br>but is there possibility of a twist gainax ending as a result of the evil sword?</br>  <br> You don't get away with writing an unengaging conflict by saying "but it's supposed to be unengaging". <br>Yes you do, when barely a third of the season has elapsed. Engagement is down to each particular viewer, and if underdog fightbacks where victories and defeats are difficult to guess are the only way for such plots to be interesting to you then you're watching the wrong series.</br></br>  <br>symphogear GX!</br>  <br>Just because the Dainsleif is part of Carol's plan it doesn't men she's not taking any risks though. Like some anon said, once the gears become able to counter the Alca-Noise and the dolls they will probably have the upper hand in any fight. Carol's moves will be severely restricted. Even if her plan accounts for that, it's still risky.<br><br>And again, it's only episode 4, that's not even one third of the show. We're clearly done with the first big arc and we have no clue how things are going to develop now.</br></br></br>  <br>she looks better with blood oozing from her</br>  <br>I want to lick it off.</br>  Hibiki was messing up Carol's plans for two episodes, then Maria did it too. Hibiki's fight against Micha wasn't really that much of sure lose until lol Gary was there too! I don't really feel like villains have it too easy.  <br> if underdog fightbacks where victories and defeats are difficult to guess are the only way for such plots to be interesting to you then you're watching the wrong series. <br>It's a battle series, and one with two previous seasons with with tense, exciting battles. I hardly think Symphogear is the kind of series where I ought to be expecting tension-free conflict. I never mentioned "underdog fightbacks", merely the idea of there being some point in showing the fight unfold or sinister plot develop rather than just a card saying "they win again, as you already know".</br></br>  <br>One step of the plan working doesn't imply the next step also will.</br>  <br>It's a pretty safe bet so long as it's not explained on-screen, which probably won't be until it's already taken effect.</br>  <br>Sounds more like the title of an SoL OVA.</br>  <br>it is.</br>  <br>My point is something will have to go not according to plan eventually.</br>  <br>Sympho SoL OVA series, Drama CD and 4koma spinoffs where!</br>  <br>Episode 4 had two exciting fights with unpredictable outcomes.</br>   girls get possessed because of Dainsleif <br> their songs become a corrupted mess <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UH4<wbr>4Z46hcuU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>If you honestly thought that things were going well and some measure of victory might be within grasp even when everyone started relaxing and calling her unbeatable, I don't know what to tell you.</br>  <br>If we have to borrow from that franchise I'd like it more in the style of https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bsa<wbr>x70r7dlw</wbr>  [ ] , with the "real" song desperately trying to get out of the KILL CRUSH DESTROY one that's drowning it.<br>That song is a mess but god I love it.</br></br>  Reminder that Gungnir got shattered partly, while Ame no Habakiri only got a few cracks, and Ichaival wasn't harmed at all on the outside.

Surely it's not going to be an "all's well that ends well" type thing and he becomes a new Gatchaman. But I can't really imagine anyone killing him either.  <br> Gel ends up killing him because everyone just wants Rui to be ok and that's the fastest way to do it. <br> everyone gets on edge with her because of this. </br></br>  <br>Redeems himself by helping the Gatchas overthrow Gel's mind control over the rest of the world</br>  Cthuko when?  <br>Hajime puts him in her chest.</br>  <br>The episode hasn't aired yet, you id---oh. Never mind.</br>  <br>While checking on Nyaa I found the video to insight by White Ash.<br><br> inb4 the singer looks like Rui: I know and it's super disturbing. </br></br></br>  Why can't Rui stay dedd?  <br>Too moe for the living world and too moe for the afterworld.

No way they are going to prove him wrong).</br></br></br>    Cool.  <br>You are fucking retarded</br>  Reminder that the episode is one hour late. Starts at 3:00/27:00 JST.  <br>They could just record that line and save some budget for all those shiny transformations</br>  <br> Tumblr. </br>  <br>Yes, yes, but before that?</br>  <br>That's a bit creepy. They were inserting references of things that were going to happen two years later that happened to be when the sequel aired.</br>  <br>Ask them, they were the ones that found the image.</br>  <br>Eh, too lazy.</br>  <br>Hey, Joe makes the garbage man outfit look good.</br>  <br>Stop being lazy.<br> http://tsubasamisudachi.tumblr.com/<wbr>ask</wbr> </br></br>  <br>T-too shy!</br>  GERURURURU  <br>He'll go to jail like Umeda.</br>  <br>They will be. But won't happen until episode 7.</br>  remember when Sugane was relevant? yeah me neither  <br>Most Gatchaman got their development in season 1 except for Hajime, so she's getting some this season. The only reason why Rui still features and gets fleshed out it's because he's the main heroine of the show.</br>  <br>It's over anon, Hajime, Tsubasa and Rui are the only Gatchaman with any relevance anymore.</br>  <br>Sugane will gain relevance again if he wears a dress and a wig.</br>  I'm sure there is a reason they decided to introduce a new character instead of focusing on the ones they already had  <br>It's Tiger &amp; Bunny all over again, great cast but they tend to focus on less interesting characters. But i'll take Hajime/Gel over Barnaby any day.</br>  <br>More yuri potential with Hajime is the only answer I can think of.</br>    <br>But Hajime is asexual anyway. Or aliensexual at most.</br>  <br>She likes stationary.</br>  <br> likes </br>  <br>You get my point.</br>  Are we sure it's delayed by one hour? I can't moon, but the official twitter didn't say anything about that  <br>She thinks Rui is handsome I haven't heard her talk about finding other characters attractive before</br>    <br>At least Tsubasa isn't annoying. I wish I could say the same for Gel though.

Yeah, I think it's Chinese/the streamer's time. If I recall correctly, China's timezone is the same as Japan's minus one hour (Japan 25:55 = China 24:55) and there's always lag when streaming, so that might explain the 2 minute difference. I'm not really sure, though.</br>  <br>I dunno, for a psychopathic murderous alien Katze seems relatively alright with her. I'm expecting something else to go horribly wrong first, like Hajime being seriously wrong for the first time.</br>  <br>That'd probably be too much to hope for.

Mark my words.</br>  <br>If the red crowds are really /b/ they shouldn't give a fuck about Bane anymore as they still have their powers.</br>  Why didn't Hajime ride senpai's senpai yet?<br>Are gatchamans supposed to be pure, or is she gay?</br>  <br>If they were /b/ they'd terrorize the public by spamming gore and CP on national TV and billboards, while mass ordering pizza to every government official</br>  BAKED/DEADFISH OR COMMIE WHEN  <br> inb4 Rizu's true goal was to force Gel into "time to turn everyone into tang' mode. </br>  Tsubasa: Rui-senpai, everything is going to be fine! We caught VAPE's leader<br>Rui: Why did you get in my way? I told you not to<br>Rui passes out<br>Tsubasa: I saved you and you say I got in the way...? Why would you say that<br>Hajime hums away</br></br></br></br>  This was really funny and anticlimactic.   Geruru is a boy <br><br>This changes nothing.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT, SERIOUSLY.<br>FUCK THIS SHOW. FUCK.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  [HorribleSubs] Gatchaman Crowds Insight - 04 [720p].mkv<br><br>It's time.</br></br>  https://archive.moe/a/thread/128248<wbr>307/#128281841</wbr>   Draw an androgynous alien <br> call it a boy <br>Why do they do that?</br></br>  <br>I feel a bit sorry for that guy, he really believed Gel was a she. You can't say we didn't warn you.</br>  Is it "Insight" or "In Sight"? There's no connection between the n and the s in the eyecatch.  Hajime says sometimes there's things more important than someone's life and Tsubasa says Hajime is a cold person for not caring about Rui's physical suffering.  I'd vote for Gelsadra but only when he's a little girl.  <br>Probably in sight because the crowds are now visible without amnesia effect?</br>  <br>I NEED MORE PONYTAIL UTSUTSU</br>   commie has won   Next episode: halo effect  That episode, holy shit.<br> the music during the fighting scene at the beginning <br> Rui being an edgelord <br> Hajime being a genki edgelord <br> Tsubasa being a SJW <br> Gelsadra being a boy and running for PM </br></br></br></br></br>  So will Tsubasa still let him sleep in the same room as her?  <br>ワロス</br>   Leave it to Sadra!    Gel ruined. <br> Millione host is being a sneaky fuck and hating based OD. <br> Berg Katze still being based as ever. <br>Gel getting PM will actually be hilarious to watch unfold.</br></br></br>  Hajime has been hanging out with Berg Katze too much. He's a bad influence.   tfw no more GERURURURRUU in a cute voice   <br>That's the least major problem.<br><br>The real one is Gel candidating to become the prime minister...</br></br></br>  <br>More like him becoming a walking catastrophe, because my gut instinct is telling me that it will end badly.</br>   Character is voiced by HanaKana AND Sugita <br>Gatchaman continues being based as fuck</br>  <br><br><br> tfw GERURURURRUU in a Sugita voice </br></br></br>  Hajime is the main reason i even watch this, seriously there's something so deliciously wrong with her.<br><br> Hosts a ancient evil alien in her boobs <br> Mind-reading alien can't properly read her <br> Says some deep shit about conflict without batting an eye </br></br></br></br>  <br> Sugita and Hanazawa in the same recording room <br><br>Sugita must be having the time of his life right now.</br></br></br>  Oh boy, this show is going to be a never stopping ride.  IT'S A BOY?????  Katze always find the right words.  <br>Sure, why not? D is the new V</br>  <br>I hope he manages to escape Hajime's bust.</br>  Hajime's suit has panties. Did we know this?  <br>Is an alien, it could be many things. So many things.</br>  <br> That Inuboku event <br>Sugita was really creepy in that video.</br></br>  Why is Hajime so smart and the others a bunch of idiots?  Hajime is so based.  Please shut up, Joe-san.  <br>Yea, what a tremendous faggot. He was annoying in the first season too.</br>  <br>Everything he said is right though.</br>   inb4 Hajime is a guy too   HOLY FUCK<br>Hajime asking ALL the hard hitting questions.<br>Tsubasa BTFO</br></br>  Why wouldn't people want to vote for that PM guy again? The guy is about as uncorrupted as you can get for a PM who actually put citizens first  <br>Will he ever get to fire bird-missiles?</br>  <br><br> Sugita <br> brown boy <br>And nothing of value was lost and something of value was gained.<br><br><br>Best girl indeed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but HEROES and LIFE <br>Goddammit. Just fucking listen to Hajime, you fucks. She clearly is the only member of the team to actually think shit through.</br></br>  <br> brown <br>Are you color blind?</br></br>  <br>Literally nothing he said was right. Even excluding his wrong wrong fucking myopic views about the crowds (they might be more dangerous than cars, but they are also a lot more useful. In fact, if a car is speeding your way you are done for, if someone is trying to kill you with crowds you can use your own fucking crowds), at least wait for your team mate to come out of a coma before you start praising the guy who put him in one. Jesus.</br>  <br>You're giving the general populace way too much credit. Most people are stupid and it's even worse in this situation because literally anyone can vote even fucking kids.</br>  <br>Who in their right mind would do something so foolish?</br>  <br>OD also seems to be able to correctly grasp the situation, but he's more of an observer than a man of action.</br>   rookies saying shit about CROWDS and what people should be doing on TV without knowing what they fuck they're talking about <br> forgetting one of CROWDS leader is their fucking teammate who made things work properly and that the one that caused havoc was someone else <br> actually believing that shitting on Rui's beliefs and ideals would make him happy <br> not understanding why it didn't and shitting on everyone else that disagrees with it <br> not realizing they're making the team fall apart with their naivety and stupidity <br> not realizing how much Japan is screwed with their overconfidence that an alien that doesn't know how or why society and democracy exist will suddenly make everyone and everything be daijobu just because he can tell if people are happy or sad <br><br>Holy shit. Gelsadra is just a kid but Tsubasa going along with all of this is making Insight really difficult to watch. At this point I just want Hajime go ahead and let Katze out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Harassing women is his specialty. Except when its Kuwashima Houko</br>  <br>I mean shit, no one even gives her any consideration when she was the one that stopped Berge and figured out how to work out the whole Mess thing. Pai-pai really is a terrible leader.</br>  <br>I really dislike Tsubasa. She reminds me too much of Shirou</br>  <br>KATZE CLEARLY DOESN'T ENJOY THIS.<br><br>Which also makes him a faggot because of doing so...</br></br></br>  <br>Brownish then.</br>  <br>More like good influence. Now she's finally getting decent.</br>  Your daily reminder not to trust aliens with diamond patterns, brought to you by our sponsor, Gatchaman season 1.  I'd vote for Gel-san.  I love everything they're doing with Hajime and hate everything they're doing with Tsubasa. I'm fairly sure I was smarter at age 7.  <br>Just because they're more useful doesn't invalidate the increased danger they present. You simply can't trust everyone to always be responsible with power. Frankly it's ridiculous that shit is even legal in their world. It's simply too big of a risk. Rui wants to bank on everybody being a good person but jesus christ that's childish. This whole evolved nation he wants, and even what Gel wants, seems like a world of brainwashed people who all think the same.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/5026844  <br> Gelsadra is just a kid <br>Lies and slander! He's an handsome young man!</br></br>  <br> 2 MB 720p screenshots </br>  Even Katze gets it.  <br>You missed the reason. Bad usage of png.</br>  <br>Mark my words, Katze will save the day. He's basically the complete opposite of Gel Sadra.</br>  <br>Do you think Katze is trying to use reverse psychology on Hajime?</br>  <br>Would you have preferred "Warosu! TL Note: Warosu means lololol"</br>  <br> Still no Loss edit </br>  <br>I think Katze is legit concerned about Gelsadra "unifying" all the people on earth.</br>  <br>Good thing my HDD is not awfully small and my connection doesn't suck, I literally don't have to care.</br>  <br>They're all shit. <br><br> Hajime <br>Always right on every account, no matter how retarded the idea. This gets confused with her thinking things through when she's a moron most of the damn time.<br><br> Sugane <br>Doesn't exist past episode 1 of the first season<br><br> Joe <br>Bitches on the sidelines.<br><br> Utsutsu <br>Serves as a safety net to prevent any sort of consequence for any characters. No one ever dies because she's around.<br><br> OD <br>Could do everything himself but A. He's too strong or B. He just doesn't feel like it.<br><br> Pai-Pai <br>Aya Hirano. Also shitty leader.<br><br> Gel <br>I don't even need to explain why she's shit.<br><br> Tsubasa <br>Has no idea what she's talking about but still doesn't shut up.<br><br>I even like OD and Utsutsu but goddamn they all suck to one degree or another.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Katze knows Gel is actually dangerous, and also knows by his standards he's a party pooper. Whether he's warning Hajime to help them or for selfish reasons is up for debate.</br>   Utsutsu uses Joe's health again <br>So how long does he have to live?<br>All that smoking and Utsutsuing isn't good for you.</br></br>  <br>In b4 Gel puts Hajime in alien gitmo because she's harboring a terrorist</br>  Why is everyone in this show so goddamn chipper? It's really irritating.  <br>Reminder that he got blown the fuck out by the voice actress of this lovely in his own show.</br>   tfw you masturbated to a boy by accident   <br>It's ok if you don't know he's a boy.</br>  <br>What does that have to do with Katze? He likes conflict because he takes deep pleasure in making people miserable, Hajime thinks conflict is necessary to sort things out and make things more interesting by breaking the routine. If no one ever argued about anything and everyone agreed with each other, wouldn't it be boring, anon-kun? Actually, what are you even doing in /a/ if you hate conflict? This board is the living proof that we are capable of cooperation and living together even though we are never in agreement with each other.</br>  <br>If you're going that way – other people fap to anything –, then there's one golden rule:<br>ALWAYS BE CERTAIN WHAT YOU FAP TO</br></br>  <br>It's okay if the boy is voiced by Kana Hana.</br>  <br>I'm still unclear on how Utsutsu's powers work.<br><br>Like, does she suck the health you have right now, so if you feed yourself properly and get some rest, you'll be fine, or is she sucking "life force" in general so you'll die sooner than you would have eventually.<br><br>Does it have permanent or temporary effects on people's health?</br></br></br></br></br>   and even cat station masters and aliens can become candidates <br><br>I nominate Tama.  rip </br></br>  <br>What are you talking about anon? Hajime has always been like that. She wasn't all sunshine and rainbows in the first season. There's a reason why the show has been repeatedly drilling into our heads in the first season that Katze and Hajime are essentially the same type of people.</br>  <br> By accident <br>I masturbate to Rui willingly.</br></br>  <br>I ask myself that every episode.</br>  <br>The heroes that saved the day said on TV that CROWDS were scary. That's all it takes, really.</br>  <br><br> This whole evolved nation he wants, and even what Gel wants, seems like a world of brainwashed people who all think the same. <br><br>You missed the point so so so much. Rui literally gave them the power to do whatever they wanted, however different it is. Gel wants the opposite.</br></br></br></br>   Casual clothing galore <br> Hajime showing her true colors more and more <br> More gay aliens <br>What a great time to be alive</br></br></br>  <br>For fucks sake, we've known since season one that Katze is a habitual liar. You know he loves it in Hajime's Hajimes.</br>  <br>But Hajime will save the day. She doesn't have a heart or real emotions ( grey Gelsadra's 'emotion icon') and that will be her trump card against Gelsadra's unifying.</br>  <br>Nope. In Hajime's case...he tell the truth. WITH BRUTAL HONESTY.</br>  <br>The fact that they're letting anyone, even foreigners and kids, run for president is beyond retarded.</br>  Katze is a necessary evil and Hajime gets that.  <br>It's okay as long it's cute. Plus it's an alien. Everyone knows aliens can handle 5 at once.</br>  <br> This gets confused with her thinking things through when she's a moron most of the damn time. <br>Do you have anything to actually back that up?</br></br>  <br> Rui literally gave them the power to do whatever they wanted <br><br>Then why did he even have a problem with VAPE? They're doing whatever they want with it too.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she's a robot.</br>  <br> gay <br>Gel wants the Tsubasa. He's not gay.</br></br>  <br>I think it's both. He knows Gel uses some sort of reverse brainwashing technique and if it gets to Hajime then it might be a problem to him.</br>  <br> the wolf of perfect reasoning.png </br>  <br> tfw anon finally got good taste </br>  <br>It's because they were abusing their power and causing mayhem, which he distinctively called the wrong path in a previous episode. Had Rhythm and his gang went about achieving their goals a different way without bloodshed, Rui would've approved.</br>  <br>Because in Rui's idealistic delusions, no opposing attitudes exist, and people live purely by his standard of what's right.</br>  <br>That's just an excuse for Gelsadra to able to be a candidate.</br>  This thread in a nutshell.  <br>VAPE wasn't CROWDS, didn't have X supervision and tried to kill Baracchi</br>  <br>Don't forget Tsubasa's uncle also has a gray bubble and is immune to it. I bet he's going to die for her sins to make her realize unification is bad.</br>  <br>Also NanaMi confirming his homolust for Nakamura</br>  <br>fuck you gel-chan, fuck you</br>   you will never go to sleep cuddling with Utsutsu <br>Why should I keep on living?</br>  <br>Anon you're contradicting yourself here. You just said he gave people that power to do whatever they want and now you say Rui can decide it's bad and try to stop it. Do you not see the problem there? That is not neutrality or being an observer. Rui only believes in his way and nothing else exists. Crowds can never work like that because of human nature.</br>  <br>I doubt it's something like she's emotionless, but rather I think she has extreme empathy from her ability to understand other people. It probably enables her to adopt their emotions as well. It's also probably the same reason why she and Katze are so similar since Katze lives within people's hearts and can copy them with his ability.</br>  <br>That's exactly why Joe calls out Rui.</br>  <br> Hajime knew, she always knows. </br>  <br>It was the exact same tech/ability. Yeah, they tried to kill him. Something that normal crowds could have done as well. Saying that X can supervise the entire population is ridiculous.</br>  <br>You're missing the point. Rui wanted everyone to be able to do something in order to help each other. Of course people could use this in the wrong way and that's why X exists, to block people with bad intentions to use this power. The red crowds weren't controlled by Rui so X couldn't do anything about it, they were controlled by a different crowds master that only used the crowds to start shit. The difference here is that Rui gave people the power but he was trying to supervise it so that it was only used for good, Rizumu only used his power to stain the crowds' reputation in general. Gelsadra doesn't want people to have any power at all, he wants to do what he thinks is best for them just by reading them. Basically he will say what people want to hear instead of letting them think for themselves. In a way Gelsadra really is the perfect politician.</br>  <br>Anon, pls. He's a textbook case tsundere to Hajime.</br>  <br>The thing is if it's related to CROWDS then X can supervise it. Look how quickly X suspended the accounts when the blue crowds fought the red.</br>  <br>That wasn't me. My point is that Rui actually went and tried to talk things through with Rizumu instead of overpowering him like he could have with his suit. If I understood his season one persona correctly he is a bit of an anarchist and thinks that humanity as a whole will be able to move on the right path, like vectors neutralizing themselves to go in the right direction.<br>The fact that he himself is a Gatchaman and that it has X supervising everything is of course a contradiction, I agree, but he is very much not on the same plane as Gel.</br></br>  Anyone else get a bad feeling when Gel said that he wanted to "take away people's sadness". Seemed pretty ominous, you'd think he would say something like give people happiness instead.<br>And it just occurred to me that maybe people with grey bubbles aren't necessarily immune to Gel's abilities but that greyness might be the end goal instead.</br>  <br>It sure did take it's sweet time though. It's not going to prevent spontaneous murder unless this turns into some minority report shit and X can see the future.</br>  <br>I don't think she's ever been blindsided once.</br>  <br>Good. Angry anons make me happy.</br>  Fuck that smug self important terrorist scum.<br>He is literally worse than ISIS.<br>  to show that x is dangerous I use x to desroy the city hurr <br><br>Fuck those who say they shouldn't have helped Rui.<br><br>Fuck those who are against Crowds and don't trust master X.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anyone else get a bad feeling when Gel said...seemed pretty ominous.  <br><br>Had a bad feeling about him from the very beginning.</br></br></br>  <br>Rui already mentioned terminating Crowds for people that have been using them to commit crimes. It's just a detail he mostly glosses over since it conflicts with his ideals.</br>  <br>Maybe the gray bubble means that Gel can't read them. Or maybe it means they don't fluctuate. It would make sense, people that don't let themselves be influenced no matter the situation.<br><br>What's more ominous here is how Gel doesn't have a bubble.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that just also means you have shit taste.</br>  <br>It took its sweet time because it was waiting for orders. As far as minority report shit goes, I'm fairly sure X already know what every CROWDS is doing at any given time.</br>  Remember when Gatchaman wasn't full of cross dressers and gender benders?  <br>So, fuck everyone?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br> gender benders <br>Except it was, anon.</br></br>   Rui wakes up <br> Sugayama has resigned <br> Crowds are banned <br> An alien is PM <br>Fun!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, X is doing good.<br>And I guess Joe too.</br></br>  <br>X doesn't need to see the future, he does thorough background and current analysis check on each user.</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;Tsubasa <br> Has no idea what she's talking about but still doesn't shut up. <br><br>Holy fuck, this. Especially disliked her with the latest episode. She's a moron.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Joe is basically Tsubasa, he's included in the last category. You said it yourself, fuck Joe.</br>  <br>It took time because Rui hesitated to do it. If it were people clearly trying to use Crowds for murder or other crimes Rui would order X clear termination. The only reason X couldn't identify VAPE was because they come from Rizumu's NOTE.</br>  <br>Skynet-chan, it's time to get off of /a/</br>  <br>I'd fuck a Gel-chan</br>  <br>Me neither.</br>  <br>Just like anon then. She'll fit just right in with the rest of us.</br>  <br>To be fair, Joe is a retard but at least he has the decency not to be a loud retard.</br>  Calling it nwo<br> Geruru becomes prime minister <br> Wants to unite everyone and in doing so becomes the final boss because reasons <br> Influences people using this guy's show <br> Tsubasa tearfully kills him in the final episode </br></br></br></br>  Gatchaman: Ethics and Politics edition<br><br>I appreciate Hajime being only semi-articulate. Even if we know she's the insightful one, her position is so clumsily formed that it's less ham-handed. And everyone else got similar and more well-spoken airtime.</br></br>  How old is Rui anyway? Why has no one brought up the fact a child shouldn't be in charge of running a nation-spanning power like Crowds? Or is Gatcha-Japan just this magical land where no one thinks about this shit? That's probably why Gel will win too.  <br> Sugayama having these many votes <br>I'm surprised. You guys just want to use the CROWDS, don't you?</br></br>  <br>No?</br>  <br>I can agree with that.</br>  I feel the anons calling Tsubasa a moron are being a little harsh. She's basically a kid who grew up in a small town, didn't spend a lot of time pondering "heroism" and all that, and now she's being thrust into a group of people with strong and matured ideals and is expected to be an informed TV personality. I agree she's annoying but her ideals are pretty expected for someone like her, she just doesn't belong in a group of influence.  <br>The Gatchamen have solid PR. Also, Galax--and CROWDS and X--are basically his company's properties. Politically, no one's had the position or the desire to try and take it away.</br>  <br>19</br>  <br>Sugayan is just moe.<br><br>and I'd use my CROWD to fuck Rui's boypussy.</br></br></br>   Don't mind me, I'm just being irrelevant as always   Calling it now, MESS is the result of Geruru's final unification.  <br>Anon, small town has nothing to do with it. She should know that when she isn't very well informed on a subject, she should keep her mouth shut. That's common sense.</br>  <br>At least now the writers remembered that Gatchaman can transform so we can see more of Joe's cool suit.</br>  Hajime confirmed best MC, she doesn't try to change the world or save everyone. She knows that their job is just to show up and clean the place when shit hits the fan. Let people deal with their own problems.  <br>You'd be surprised with how young people that develop a corporation that ends up being big are.</br>  <br>I dislike Tsubasa still (her anger at Joe's opinions is downright silly), but I do like your defense of her. She just doesn't know any better...</br>    <br>I like that.</br>  gel-chan shota doujins when  <br>Why haven't they even been mentioned this season?</br>  <br> Tsubasa tearfully kills him in the final episode <br><br>This show only kills civilians, if anything Tsubasa will trap him on herself like Hajime did with Katze</br></br></br>     paipai is racist against other aliens     <br>They were there in episode 1</br>  <br>Is that so? I think there's good points to the kirakira and BAAAM that Tsubasa brings to the table.</br>  <br>Still, I have to wonder why it's never even been brought up. VAPE asserts that humans can't handle the CROWDS, but no one mentions how just Rui and X might not be enough oversight for the system.</br>   is satan  <br>They showed up briefly when Gelsadra landed.</br>  <br>Tsubasa is a true hero. She doesn't give much fuck about anything beside helping people, which is exactly why she's not particularly fond of CROWDS.</br>  <br>That doesn't mean she isn't an idiot for talking. Idiots make lots of BAAM, and we'll see a lot of shit because she couldn't think before she spoke.</br>  <br>Gelsadra wants to make everyone Tang. It all makes sense now.</br>  <br>That's plausible.</br>  <br>So true heroes are mindless drones?</br>  <br>Are you an idiot? Not knowing something doesn't stop people from keeping their mouths shut. We do it all the time and think little of, for fucks sake, there are anons doing it right now.

She is very selfish and does what she wants making her friends work for her.  <br> he hasn't seen the anime <br> he hasn't read the manga </br></br>  <br>But she's best girl. And she's actually very considerate. You don't even need to read the manga to notice that.</br>  <br>All girls are best, damnit. Some people have bester girls, but none of them are bad. This is what happens when you guys forget to state this in the first couple of posts.</br>  <br>Why does one girl have to be shit? They both have some bad moments (Chinatsu's lust and Kyouko's selfishness) but in the end they're both good characters</br>  <br>i never read a more faggoty post</br>  <br>sort of</br>  <br><br><br>I genuinely do not like Chinatsu.<br><br>If she was removed from the show, it would be an improvement, in my opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All girls are best girls, but Akari is bestest. She's always in the background doing nice things for the others and never getting any reward for it. I want good things to happen to Akari!</br>  <br><br>They are all special in their own way Anon.<br><br>Even Chinatsu deserves love.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didnt something ´good already happen to Akari in episode 5 or something?</br>  <br>I agree in fact my life would be better if Chinatsu just didn't exist.</br>  <br>I/ll rape the one you like</br>  <br> If she was removed from the show, it would be an improvement, in my opinion <br>It's a good thing that will never happen</br></br>  Himawari best.  <br>F A T<br>A<br>T</br></br></br>  <br>Himawari breast</br>  <br>w-what's chizuru looking at</br>  <br><br>In all the right places.</br></br>  <br>shut the fuck up sakurako you little shit</br>  <br>Fuck off himashit.</br>  <br>Only 2-3 times.</br>  <br>She's just found out that she's wearing the same panties as Yui</br>    Kyouko has no game   /tamago/   <br><br>The gif form of this is what convinced me to pick up YrYr.</br></br>  <br>It's good that it did, I hope you enjoyed the ride thus far and hope you continue to enjoy it with us</br>  <br>Me too, actually.</br>  <br>You have to eat all these eggs.</br>  <br>i still remember that post</br>  <br> cute girls  made me pick up yuru yuri</br>  quick <br> winter or summer uniform </br>  <br>  Summer,   because   arms  </br>  <br>but no tights Ayano</br>  <br>winter<br>sleeves look better and also ayano</br></br>  <br>classic winter</br>  <br>whoa i didnt even know they had seperate uniforms</br>   brat   a   best   <br>they do<br>i think the only difference is sleeves and that ayano doesn't wear thights when it's summer<br>S1 and S2 did only feature the winter uniform, the OVA featured the summer uniform<br>manga featured both just incase you were wondering</br></br></br></br>  <br>Durarara yuru yuri crossover?</br>  second OVA in august right?  <br>First OVA in August, second in September.</br>  <br>Yui a best yuru</br>  <br>She looks so fluffy. Reminds me of a cat, it makes me want to pinch her cheeks.<br>Not like Chinatsu's design, her fluff is almost separate from her. Chitose maybe.</br></br>  <br> Not like Chinatsu's design, her fluff is almost separate from her. <br>They're. I'm convinced it works just like Akari's odangos, except they're also living eldtrich horrors that devour matter and warp the mind of an innocent little girl.</br></br>  <br>hanako is able to see what her fluff really is</br>    <br>Boobs are evil, they corrupted poor Himawari<br>She was so cute when she was flat</br></br>  Is it possible that china is developing feelings for akari?  <br>Most corrupt</br>  <br>Double dubs don't lie.<br><br>I think it's more than possible.</br></br></br>    <br><br><br>No bully.</br></br></br>      Could Akari defeat Ganondorf?  <br>I agree Chinatsu is a satan but she's made to be one. If she was removed, the character dynamics would suffer a lot, like it or not. It's easy to see even if she isn't your favorite character.</br>  <br>not with that shitty sword</br>  <br>Why would she need a sword and a shield? She has bun missiles and can turn invisible at will.</br>  <br>She's so nice that Ganondorf could convince her to join him.</br>  <br>We always raep the ones we love</br>  <br><br>Akari is the strongest.</br></br>  <br>But anon, China is best girl</br>  <br>this is truth</br>    <br>And with this, this manga has reached its lowest point. Haisebitch and Qshit are killing the manga.<br>What a shame.</br></br>  <br>i agree with you, anon</br>  <br>you are right, sadly</br>  <br>I have more faith in the Autisma's OVA, I mean look at this quality. Pierrot changed staff, so maybe it could be decent.</br>  <br>It looks like Kyoani tier animation.</br>  OK let me get this straight, anons<br>ITT we're supposed to bitch about everything until spoiler pics are dumped.<br>And then we bitch about how nothing happened in the chapter even when almost no one ITT knows moonrunes and we only have -10 pages from the actual chapter.<br>Then we bitch about IS being slow.<br>Then we bitch about how nothing happened in the chapter, and even when something that may be interesting in the future starts developing we'll simply ignore it and keep bitching about anything we can.<br>Oh and we bitch about tumblr too<br>Am I getting things right, anons?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, this is basically what TG threads are for until ishida delivers</br>  <br>yeah, they complain about anything. It's called being a tg speed reader.</br>  <br>This. I want impatient shonenfags to leave.</br>  If the chapter is shit and nothing fucking happens, we will call it as it is.<br><br>I swear you guys are the worst. Do you guys think we like to complain? At some point, we all loved this manga.</br></br>  <br>We also fuck each other in the ass.  /a/ TG fanbase is absolute shit. </br>  <br>If you loved this manga you'd know how the manga was in the beginning. But you don't seem to.</br>  <br> /a/ TG fanbase is absolute shit. <br>I agree, tumblr is actually better, they always have discussions going about symbolisms and shit. So does reddit. Here? Waaaaaah nothing happened.</br></br>  <br>TG was exactly the same you faggot.</br>  <br><br><br> even when something that may be interesting in the future starts developing we'll simply ignore it <br>When some shit actually happens we talk/joke about it, you fucking niggas. <br>Stop being Ishida's defenders and read the past threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I'm fine with tokyo ghoul, its not super fast paced until shit goes down. I like the buildup, characterization, etc. I like Haise and the Q's, some some terrible shit is probably going to happen to them and its already building up. Also last chapter we got to see the ccg guy who tortured Yamori   will probably torture Haise because parallels  . I know people don't like it, for some people they have concerns that sound legitimate, but lets be honest the anime attracted lots of viewers who either sped through the chapters, skipped all of them until kaneki torture, or decided to pick up the manga at re:</br>  Ishida drawing Ihe Hairu, listening this song from osterreich:<br><br>https://soundcloud.com/onlyifyoucal<wbr>lme/5yzf8sel7xvu</wbr></br></br>  <br><br> TG was exactly the same you faggot <br>I want disgusting newfags to leave.<br>Here is a example of our talks when Re started. But as the manga kept focusing in Qshit our talks kept being shittier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The sad part is reddit and tumblr have actual discussion unlike Tokyo Ghoul threads on achan. All I see people do is complain about nothing happening for every chapter.<br><br>Hopefully that changes.</br></br></br>  <br> the anime attracted lots of viewers who either sped through the chapters, skipped all of them until kaneki torture, or decided to pick up the manga at re: <br>The threads became shitty after trap's revelation of being a trap. I know because that day I was here.</br></br>  <br> those hands <br><br>yup that's ishidas art</br></br></br>  <br>There are still discussion to be had anon. I mean last chapter we had Yamori's torturer introduced, but naw instead people shitpost. It's not being a newfag or anything.</br>  <br><br>It's much better than that Tsukiyama pic</br></br>  <br><br> The sad part is reddit and tumblr have actual discussion <br>Of course m8.</br></br></br>  <br>I like it more than I ever have. Then again, I didn't start reading until TG finished.</br>  <br>ahh yeah I remember that. Remember when the old discussion that used to be had on /a/? I think people are mostly upset because they miss kaneki   and want to do sexual things with him  .</br>  <br> I mean last chapter we had Yamori's torturer introduced, but naw instead people shitpost. <br>We already talked about this. Ishida is creating false hyped but then everything return to be shitty SoL.<br> Chapter 30, it seemed that Kaneki was going to return. Lol, nope, Haisebitch is still in charge. <br> In said chapter it looked as if both of them were going to merge. Lol, nope, Haisebitch is still in charge. <br> Christmas chapter: look it's the Last Supper symbolism. Lol, more SoL in the next chapters. <br> Fungus symbolism. More SoL. <br> Haisebitch is going to talk with Uta. Lol those are tattoos and nothing more. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they miss kaneki <br>Because Haise is that shitty. I want a good MC.</br></br>  <br>Thats not what i meant.<br>The fucking boring SoL chapters were the same in TG.<br>And the TG Threads were full of gay shit .</br></br></br>  <br>With all this false hope I feel like he's building shit up for something. It's like he's doing this shit on purpose. He knows people want Kaneki, but then why is he holding him back?</br>  <br> The fucking boring SoL chapters were the same in TG <br>The only arc that bored me at this level was Hinami's mother's arc, but that was in the early 10-17 chapters, in :re we are in the 30-40 chapters and still that boring feeling is present.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128550737 <br> Since when were you under the impression that you weren't just projecting your newfaggotry? <br>Since I know you, nigga. At least use another pics.</br></br>  What do you think is in the rest of the envelopes that little mouse delivered to homo prince through the faggot butler?  <br>Fujobait, that's what is inside.</br>  <br>Ishida always delivered, so stop your bitching and wait.</br>  <br>My kind of envelops</br>  Tbh I think this whole Haise thing is just to make an even more insane Kaneki. Think about it<br>  Conflict choosing between his ghoul bonds and his ccg bonds <br>  New split personality, as if he didn't already have enough of those <br>  Potential to hurt someone he cares about from previous life due to his amnesia <br>  Torture parallel with Tokage <br>  The amnesia sets Kaneki backwards, causing him to struggle, he was starting to figure out about the clowns and stuff until he got mind wiped </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's probably using the smug Uta pics now. There was only one thread I've been as far as I remember early around 1X where there was only 2 shitposts by the end of the ride so I'm not around here often minus for spoiler pics. Let's face it, these threads wouldn't get past 500 posts anymore and they'll be empty before the start of Monday</br>  <br> Ishida always delivered <br>I'm waiting since Re started, nigga.</br></br>  <br>  Conflict choosing between his ghoul bonds and his ccg bonds <br>  New split personality, as if he didn't already have enough of those <br>  Potential to hurt someone he cares about from previous life due to his amnesia <br>It's already here, he's researching Kaneki, shironeki is his unconsciousness reminding him how ignorant he really is and after meeting Nishiki is he considering to tread his path carefully by capturing Hinami instead of telling her to fuck off.<br>What's more interesting is what Autismo thinks of Haise now that one of his squad members is cooperating with his team while keeping a eye on him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I really don't want white haired Kaneki back since he's too edgy. However I want combination of Kaneki and Haise together.</br>  <br>yeah but he can just look at a females hand</br>  <br>Friendly reminder that Shironeki has not killed a single human.</br>  <br>there is no point to another merger, literally at the end of TG black haired Kaneki and white haired Kaneki merged. what the fuck would be the point in merging now just give Kaneki back his body and piss off.</br>  <br><br>Have faith in Ishida. We all know it's coming</br></br>  So you know how kaneki gets a new split personallity when he eats someone ( well not just anyone it seems the victim needs to have left an impact on Kaneki). Haise is probably based off of Hide. Do you think any new personalities will be added into the pot? I mean if kaneki ate shu and started saying "fortissimo" it'd be pretty sick.<br><br>Shironeki was so badass, he just needed to make better choices.<br><br>If Batamon hadn't gotten picked up for experiments he would have. I guess Hide hadn't been confirmed yet, so too early to call it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Honestly I really don't want <br>Honestly I don't care about your opinion.</br></br>  Haise wont suffer r-right?  What are we all expecting will happen in this issue?  <br><br>He already has, anon</br></br>  <br>Q masks.</br>  <br>And Haise's hair is even darkly colored at the roots like Hide's</br>  <br><br>Tsukiyama bursts into :re</br></br>  <br>I could see that going horribly wrong with the other investigators, it's going to cause a rift between the Q's and the rest of ccg. I mean masks are the symbols of ghouls.</br>  <br>Nothing.  Maybe starting operation for masked Qs by the end of the chapter. </br>  People complain about the pacing but compared to One Piece the pacing is faster and the payoff is just as good.  <br>They need to infiltrate or whatever.

Stop this, this is like the 3rd time already.</br></br>  <br><br>So I guess you guys never read Penisman</br></br>  I quit reading the manga about 10 chapters into part 2 when it got so bad I just couldn't keep my interest up.<br><br>So is it worth picking up again in which case I can probably rush through the boring chapters at once now?</br></br>  <br>Just fuck off already.</br>  <br>No.<br>Now, fuck off.</br></br>  <br> rush through the boring chapters at once now? <br>Fuck off and never read the manga again.</br></br>  <br>Penisman is the pinnacle of all manga. TG is just some shit Ishida does for shits and giggles.<br><br>The commentary in Penisman is probably the best thing I have ever laid eyes on.</br></br></br>  <br> being this defensive <br>Keep on doing it, faggot. Keep sucking his dick</br></br>  <br> rush through the boring chapters at once now? <br> Rush <br> Speed <br>You're a speedreader faggot. No, fuck off and eat shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rewatch the anime. That'll keep you busy while Pierrot serves you their shit on a platter (AKA the inevitable TG :re adaptation)</br>  <br>So, he's a faggot because of that? Good to know.</br>  <br> Keep sucking his dick <br>Jesus christ, it's sad that I can't even count how many times I've read some faggot say then a Tokyo ghoul thread. /a/ is full of some of the worst uptight faggotry.</br></br>  <br>Wait until the manga is over, then you can skip all chapters and shitpost about how bad it was.</br>  Oh so it's bitching time again, huh?<br>Ok<br>W-well I fucking hate  , Saiko looks too short<br>Damn Ishida, you're a hack<br>The manga is ruined now<br><br> How am I doing, anons? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/ is full of some of the worst uptight faggotry <br>And what are you doing here if you don't like being here? Fuck off jesus.</br></br>  <br>you're gay</br>  We're literally Attack on Titan manga threads now. The only thing missing are the shipperfags posting their homo pairings and an Uta bot.  <br> Oh so it's bitching time again <br>It's not that, it's just that he's really asking for it.</br></br>  <br> what are you doing here <br>Enjoying conservations about manga and anime I like that don't devolve into raging shitposters sperging, and butthurt waifufags. not every thread is as bad as Tokyo ghoul threads.</br></br>  <br>don't give them ideas</br>  <br>1/10<br><br>You need to complain about something like Urie's edge, Qs being shit or gayama being gay.</br></br></br>  <br> 4u </br>  <br> I like that don't devolve into raging shitposters sperging, and butthurt waifufags <br><br>Well, that's what /a/ is for you and always was, you newshit. <br><br>If you came here only for discussions about anime and shit, then there are other sites for that too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fuck! it's a fagyama arc! <br> Eto is a queen <br> Shitty haise is such a bitch bring back Kaneki <br> stop sucking Ishida's dick <br> Stop talkng about ishida <br> Just wait until Uta becomes take and kills Arima. <br> Touka a shit. <br>There you go. That's a common tokyo ghoul thread minus that shitposter that pops in to call tokyo Ghoul edgy shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what happened to whitehairfags?  <br>And Eto is not the queen?</br>    Emil looking CCG Investigator cuts a guy's tongue off <br>  instead we shitpost, calling Ishida a hack <br><br>What's next guys? Ishida draws a guy getting his balls cut and we call him a Hack.</br></br></br>    <br>How about you stop praising him and talk about him.</br>    hack <br><br>Do some illiterate niggers not know how to use this word correctly?</br></br>  <br>Let's just start ignoring the shitposting and actually discuss what we've seen.</br>  <br>But he's literally shit, faggot</br>  <br>Ishida is a tattoo artist.</br>  <br>How so.</br>  <br> Ishida draws a guy getting his balls cut <br>We already had something similar with nutcracker cracking balls. What i want to see next is Uta eating some more dick.</br></br>  <br>I don't give a shit</br>  <br> :^) </br>  <br>Bet your faggot ass wouldn't be saying this if he brings back Kaneki. <br><br>Honestly I wish this series had ended when Kaneki got raped by Arima so I wouldn't have to deal with all this faggotry.</br></br></br>  <br>They hate the series now because it's getting too "gay" for them, but they can't stop reading it because they actually love it. But now they're mad because they've got all this repressed gay inside of themselves and don't know what to do with it. The manga's fine.</br>  <br> literally shit <br>Yeah, illiterate.</br></br>  <br>Hey, guess that's literally in the dictionary.<br> in effect; in substance; very nearly; virtually: <br>"I literally died when she walked out on stage in that costume."</br></br></br>  <br>Do they not remember that the prequel had gayness as well? Do they not know that Ishida was the creator of Penisman which was gay? It's like they forgot the series itself had gay elements. I guess sucking on Kaneki's centipede made them forget.</br>  <br>I'd assume the other Qs, but it doesn't add up to 6.</br>  <br> Getting to gay <br>Tokyo Ghoul was just as gay with Kaneki calling Tsukiyama and arima beautiful.</br></br>  <br>There a lot of shit like timeskips up and there, after the auction, even worse than the fucking prequel. It's just few of the examples.<br><br><br>I don't give a shit about kaneki and arima<br><br><br>I see you don't even know the definition.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't give a shit about kaneki <br><br>Then why the fuck are you reading the Manga?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't reply to that bait. That was just to retarded of a statement to not be bait.</br>  <br>That was the peak of the manga. :re is a disgrace to Ishida's name.</br>  <br> Then why the fuck are you reading the Manga? <br>Are you fucking kidding me? WHAT THE FUCK? There a lot of reason to read this manga besides fucking kaneki. I hope you all die fucking retards.<br><br><br>Your favorite mangaka is not fucking perfect get over it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK <br><br>This would be so much funnier if he crashed into the CCG like that. Even better if Arima stands right before him.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you so mad?</br>  <br>He wants Batman to come.</br>  Isn't Suey a girl's name? Is Ishida a girl?  <br> Your favorite mangaka is not fucking perfect get over it. <br>He isn't my favorite mangaka. I just like his manga. Is this what you faggots think? Who gives a fuck if other people like Ishida? Don't let your autism make you think you have to be a contrarian to look cool.</br></br>  <br>His Editor or assistant confirmed his gender at one point.</br>  <br> ITT we're supposed to bitch about everything until spoiler pics are dumped. <br>We are not. If OP wasn't a desperate faggot, anons would make threads when we only get some spoilers<br> no one ITT knows moonrunes and we only have -10 pages from the actual chapter. <br>Actually, there is a fag who brings us translations from  Tumblr  and we deal with it since Imperial is very shit at doing its work.<br> Then we bitch about IS being slow. <br> we <br>That's just one fucker. At this point I think it's shitposter-kun, he likes whining and spouting nonsensical shit while he bumps the thread. <br>There is no need to be mentally retarded like the shitposter after all; we are just waiting for THScans to deliver new chapters <br> Then we bitch about how nothing happened in the chapter <br>We are like this since the Christmas shit chapter. Also, this is a Tsukiyama arc, we're still in CCG PoV and Ishida is making other CCG investigators (Hirako, Kijima and his slut, Takeomi) more interesting than Haise and his squad, what did you expect? <br>Clowns themselves doing serious shit in Auction is by far the best thing since TG:re serialization started.<br> we bitch about tumblr too <br>If you weren't such a newfriend, you must have known /a/ hates tumblrites. You can go and see any threads on /a/ (except Nurutu, SnK and Magi threads) /a/ likes shitting on Tumblr, Reddit and MAL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, now you asking why I'm mad. Because there are faggots that read this manga only for the MC which is stupid.<br><br><br>You know what. Fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> all of the Qs in Uta's shop <br> nobody notices Uta is a ghoul <br> not even Urine <br>Uta just doesn't give a fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uta just doesn't give a fuck. <br><br>He's just that good anon. He makes everyone his bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>They should all be fired.<br>Haise=dumb<br>Quinx=dumb</br></br></br>  I love Arima.  <br>Yep, we Bleach now. Learn to love it.</br>  When is Autisma's OVA airing?  <br>October, I think.</br>  <br>It's okay dude just chill we all got that one series we enjoy but hate the MC</br>  <br>How would they know? I hope you're not talking about his eyes.</br>  <br>Fuck off Hairu.</br>  <br>Because he doesn't turn his kakugan off. Seriously, Urie sense of smell is that good and he can't even regconize the ghoul smell?!</br>  <br> Hairu </br>  <br><br>I like your positivity.<br><br>Here's some positive questions for you guys <br><br> Who's your favorite character and why? <br> When did you start liking them? <br> Ghouls or humans? <br> Favorite arc? <br> If you were a ghoul what kagune would you want and why? <br> Would you risk the consequences to get a kakuja? <br> Who's your waifu/husbando and what's their appeal to you? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never knew FAS was so attractive</br>  What happen in this chapter<br> Tsukiyama sees Haise and tries to see him on wheelchair. He trips obviously. <br> Kanae prepares him to see Haise at the CCG but then Tsukiyama falls. Haise and Saiko help him up ln his feet. The ghoul household leaves to advoid further dangerous investigators. <br> Haise takes his team to Uta's shop. Saiko seems to be interested in Uta. Haise has a new mask. <br> Kijima tortures Yuma and decides to send a tongue to Roze ghouls. <br> Chapter ends with Uta saying to Yomo: I became friend with Sasaki-kun. <br><br><br>Who cares, stop diluting this thread and discuss the chapter. You are acting like a swab meeting which is disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is something fun. I'll bite.<br><br> Kaneki Ken, he was and still is the most interesting characters in the series so far.  <br> Around the point when he asked touka to teach him how to fight. <br> Ghouls <br> Aunteiku raid <br> Ukaku, aesthetically pleasing to have wing like kagune and strong long range with the ability to fight up close is nice. <br> Yes <br> Hinami, she's cute. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Who's your favorite character and why? <br>Banjou because he's Banjou<br> When did you start liking them? <br>When he became Banjou<br> Ghouls or humans? <br>Banjou<br> Favorite arc? <br>Banjou arc<br> If you were a ghoul what kagune would you want and why? <br>Banjou's kagune because it's the best kagune<br> Would you risk the consequences to get a kakuja? <br>Only if it's a Banjou kakuja<br> Who's your waifu/husbando and what's their appeal to you? <br>Banjou</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you look at all the Tokyo ghoul color pages/volume all the ghouls kakugans are red iris with white sclera while Uta's is red iris with black sclera. All Uta would have to do is turn them off and his eyes will still be black. Like he said he's tattoos his eyes.</br>  According to Makyun, there's a flashback from Ui with Haise and Arima in combat.  <br>Banjou in re when?</br>  <br>Could Banjou's Kagune heal others or just himself?</br>  <br> there's a flashback from Ui with Haise and Arima in combat <br><br>Arima being best dad.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up.</br>    <br>Translation? This is getting pretty interesting.</br>  <br>Haise basically says "Umm, Are You Ok?" and Saiko say "crazy suit"</br>  <br>Ah, was hoping the speech bubble belonged to Tsukiyama.</br>  <br>I think it's safe to say the under weight man who just tried to run from his wheelchair and fell onto the floor isn't okay Haise you dense fuck</br>  Tsukiyama looks like Torso now.<br><br>Ui doesn't like Haise and thinks he's dangerous? That's new.</br></br>  <br>It seems as if Haise and Arima are fighting eachother, I'm hoping, or they're just fighting together in the flashback.</br>  <br>I'll take that L but Ishida is being inconsistent and confusing then. Majorities of of the color pages the kakugans it red/white but the the pic you show me and I think a other one with one of the ghoul twins is red/black, which the fuck is it then.</br>  <br><br>No, there are six envelopes there. The numbers for 2 and 6 are obscured though.</br></br>  <br>I said that, 4 Qs and Sasaki makes 5, not 6.</br>  <br>That's what anon said, he said that he thought it was the Qs until he realised that Haise + Qs doesn't add up to 6.</br>  <br>Didn't the first go to Shu anyway? So it would be Shu, Qs, Haise to make 6 right.</br>  <br>i highly disagree anon</br>  does faglord-san remember who he is by now or will I have to wait for more chapters?  <br>He still doesn't remember.</br>  <br>Don't blame him, he's making a fortune with his manga. He's always happy with his fujobucks<br><br><br>Saicow is 143cm. She's a small pig<br><br><br> Uta bot <br>That is shitposter-kunt, he uses Clowns images to shitpost. It's sad, there are some anons who liked Uta and his gang but that shiteater had to ruin everything<br><br><br> if he brings back Kaneki <br>Who cares? I mean, people seem to want to know more about secondary characters than MC-kun's "family" Anyway I agree with you, I'd have wished TG to finish when Kaneki was killed by Gary Stu-san, since there were many hints about Amon being alive and Suzuya wasn't an insufferable character anymore; I could see them being MCs in Ghoul and CCG sides<br><br><br><br>Wow, I know Haise, Sharkteeth, Saiko and Trap are dumbasses as fuck but I thought Urine wasn't too idiot. He probably got hit so hard when he was benching. Poor Urine<br><br><br>Nice blog dipshit.

Haise plans on investigating by infiltrating while wearing masks. However, it seems that Haise didn’t get a favorable response.<br><br>Haise: …Understood.

I hope the old Ishida returns and fix this.</br></br>  <br> According to Makyun <br>Since when does that bitch is allowed here?</br></br>  <br>It's goddamn common courtesy.</br>  <br> but I thought Urine wasn't too idiot <br>I'm too close to just put on hold this manga. I can't stand Haise nor the Qshit. They're too disgusting for me.</br></br>  <br>Honestly Haise wouldn't be nearly as atrocious if it wasn't for the fact he manages to be even more of a jobber than Kaneki. He has the potential to be a proper ass-kicker, but lets just waste that to reinforce his shitty parent persona.</br>  <br><br>Because he wants to tell a story, something most of mongoloids here are incapable of understanding.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> &gt; New split personality, as if he didn't already have enough of those <br> split personality <br> split personality <br> split personality <br> split personality <br> split personality <br>You pain me anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br> white hair kaneki because black hair a Bitch  <br> when he stopped being a whiny Bitch <br> neither  <br> I want eto kagune  <br> yep <br> rize because she best girl </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will you ever kill yourself?</br>    <br>I don't understand why you keep on replying without even typing anything.

That's completely normal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anyone more interesting that the heroine the actual TG series <br>Anon just because she the heroine of the series dosn't make her the best girl and interesting <br><br>Rize more interesting then her and she barely in the manga <br>Touka was only good for the first half of the manga and does shit after that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Touka was only good for the first half of the manga and does shit after that <br>same goes for Rize. At the least Touka does something instead of being a plot device.</br></br>  <br>All Touka does is sit around waiting for Kaneki <br>Rize has an excuse for not doing anything</br></br>  <br> Rize has an excuse <br>top kek at the least touka has a life and lives it independently instead of being a bag of meat all the time. Rize triuly worst girl.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128568029 <br>thats gay</br>  I'm not the type of person to go 'x readers are cancer', but I'm getting really sick of the yaoifags, tumblrfags and waifufags.  <br> This is my first day on /a/ pls be gentle <br>Nah</br></br>  <br>And who's saying that Rize not living her her life independently it's been two years anon and I doubt she's locked in a container</br>  <br> Please accept my headcanon <br>Nope</br></br>  <br>Not what I'm saying at all, the yaoifags were always there, of course, but it's getting pretty embarrassing.</br>  <br>this is a headcannon it's logical<br>Of she's not at Re cafe then we're else can she be<br>If you think she's in a container then you must be retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Yomo likes to keep his pets leashed.</br>  <br> meant to say this is not a headcannon </br>  <br> this is a headcannon it's logical <br>nope. Only things that happened in the manga are canon. Your idea that Rize is independent now did not happen in the manga, therefore it's pure headcanon. It does not matter if it makes sense or not. It's headcanon. Look it up.</br></br>  When can we expect Batmon to appear?  <br>But in the original manga she relied on Anteiku <br>And re she loving With your.who Im guess brought the shop<br><br>So how touka living independently</br></br></br></br>  <br> Living  <br> yomo <br>Damn auto correct</br></br></br>  <br> So how touka living independently <br>She takes her own decision. She obviously decided to not say Haise outright whoe they are. She obviously decided to work instead of crying allday. She onviously decided to do whatever she's doing now instead of being looked up like Rize and deciding literally nothing. She even seems to be the one leading the cafe instead of Yomo who is just there because</br></br>  <br>Soon.<br> I want to believe. </br></br>  Chapter 100 of the original Tokyo Ghoul is when Kaneki went Kakuja. Is that the chapter number in :RE that Kaneki will finalize his Kakuja?  <br>But how can rize decide for herself if Yomo dont feed her <br>Rize will have to rely on yomo because after all she was tortured for a long time getting feed rarely</br></br>  <br> But how can rize decide for herself if Yomo dont feed her  <br> Rize will have to rely on yomo because after all she was tortured for a long time getting feed rarely <br>that's the point. Touka is an actual character and not a plot device unlike Rize.</br></br></br>  <br>Every character in a story is a plot device.</br>  <br>138 when he fights Arima again.</br>  This chapter with Tsukiyama part is so fucking gay. Blerg.  <br><br>Actually all the ghouls are a plot device literally the plot only moves foward when the ghouls do something</br></br>  <br>All this recent shitting on Tsukiyama</br>  <br><br>Nope there is a difference between being a plot device and being part of a plot point.</br></br>  <br>A plot device is what moves the story forward<br>which means Kaneki, Aogiri, CCG ect are plot decives because they move the story foward<br><br>Plot point is something happens which makes the plot move forward Kaneki accepting his ghoul side so the plot progress which meant the plot device moved the story forward <br><br>I see no difference</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you can't see the difference between a "character" who only exists as a plot device, moving the main story forth by his existence alone and a actual character doing random stuff, then I can't help you.</br>  <br> ahhh nobody can shit on my fav character <br>It's totally gay.</br></br>  <br> &gt;ahhh nobody can shit on my fav character <br>Tsukiyama doesn't need to be my favourite character to defend him from the cancer fags that the anime attracted.</br></br>  <br> doing random stuff <br>Doing random stuff also moves the story forward. When a character moves the plot forward in any direction they're a plot device.</br></br>  <br>there is a main storyline and side storys. Just try to comprehend that.</br>  <br> there is a main storyline and side storys. Just try to comprehend that. <br>I'm fully capable of comprehending that, but even if it's not a major part of the plot, if it's moved forward by character they're a plot device.</br></br>  So how long will this fight last I doubt Tsukiyama is going to survive after this arc  <br>I doubt Ishida will just kill off the first character he ever developed.</br>  <br>I hate him and his faggotry. You need to see some doctors for this insecurity over a fictional character.</br>  <br>nope you're taking the word plot device literally by completly ignoring that it expresses the value of a character or rather the necessity. Rize only shows up when the story needs to move. When there needs to be a change a "happening". Guess who doesn't.</br>  <br> developed <br> first character </br></br>  <br> who is kaneki? </br>  <br>Jesus Christ anon just drop it, this is making you seem desperate and obsessed.<br>Not that anon.</br></br>  <br> that filename </br>  <br> I doubt Ishida will just kill off the first character he ever developed. <br>Kek you wish anon<br><br> Rize only shows up when the story needs to move. When there needs to be a change a "happening". Guess who doesn't. <br><br>so if Rize the reason for the story to move then how is this plot moving right now both orginal and re are linked to one story<br>Rize not even reintroduced</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I hate him and his faggotry. <br>Faggotry? When was that ever the case? Just because there are a lot of fujoshis who interpret his character in a way they personally see fit I won't start hating him for such a nonsensical reason.<br> You need to see some doctors for this insecurity over a fictional character. <br>I don't quite see your point here. How can someone be insecure over a fictional character? Please elaborate.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;I doubt Ishida will just kill off the first character he ever developed. <br> Kek you wish anon <br>He confirmed that Tsukiyama was the first character he developed and was originally intended to be the protagonist of different manga.</br></br></br>  <br> desperate <br>I only made one post hating on Gayama in this thread and that guy immediately called me out for shitting on his "muhhh Tsukiyama". Who is the desperate one here?</br></br>  <br>so anon are you saying that plot device character's not better then a character that not a plot device</br>  Chink scans when?  <br> first to be ever be developed <br>It's Nishiki. He had he arc way before Hinami and Tsukiyama. And now you need to stop being delusional.</br></br>  <br>No, you have made several posts in this thread whining about a single character's presence in the story just because you interpret him in a way that makes you hate him.<br>If you weren't somewhat obsessed with this, you wouldn't respond to the other anon with childish insults.</br></br>  <br> how <br>You need to stop being so butthurt over a simple post of "gay chapter" and tryibg so hard to make everyone like him.</br></br>  <br> so if Rize the reason for the story to move then how is this plot moving right now both orginal and re are linked to one story <br> Rize not even reintroduced <br>nope I didn't say that she is the *only* reason, but she is one of them. Don't twist my words. Unlike Touka, Eto, Hinami and whoever else, Rize equals a plot device, a letter, a object nothing more.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;first to be ever be developed <br> It's Nishiki. He had he arc way before Hinami and Tsukiyama. And now you need to stop being delusional. <br>You know that authors develop their characters before/while they write the story which happens before they publish it, don't you anon?</br></br></br>  <br> several posts <br>That's funny. Quote every single post you see and I will take screenshot to show how lunatic you are.</br></br>  <br>Then it should be Kaneki. He is intented for Tokyo Ghoul and Tsukiyama is not. If you want to talk about first character he jas ever developed, it's the Penisman because it was his first manga.</br>  <br>Considering that there was no reply to  calling you out over that, you at least had to have posted  too</br>  <br> tryibg so hard to make everyone like him. <br>Sorry if it seems that I'm trying to make you like him, I assure you that this is not the case. It's just that most of the anime-attracted-shonen-cancer in TG threads doesn't even bother to look at his character and just calls him "useless" and "gay" because of fujos.</br></br>  <br>But Ishida confirmed it that Tsukiyama is the first character he had ever craeted, you dense shit.</br>  <br>/fit/ plz go and stay go</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128570930 <br> black eyelashes instead of blue <br>Not even worth the effort.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128570930 <br>Touka is more cute than that girl</br>  <br>Go see the flow of conversation you dense fuck.</br>  <br> first character <br>You mean Penisman?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128570930 <br>How did her hair get to this colour</br>  <br>Her hairs just naturally getting lighter like her mothers.</br>  <br>This post doesn't provide any new information and just brings up the possiblity that you really are butthurt.</br>  My prediction<br> Some battle happening <br> Haise starts losing it <br> Akira does the usual, asks who he is <br> Memories coming back <br> "I'm...Kaneki Ke---" <br> Suddenly there's a quinque in Kaneki's eye <br> It's Arima <br> Gets send to Cochlea  <br> cue prison break arc with Hinami or Qs rescue mission </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haise's losing his shit and being sent to Cochlea isn't very plausible, it's probably gonna be some quinx like Mutsuki, Shirazu or Urie.</br>  <br>If Akira's there, he'll just get shot with RC suppressants, so he couldn't really do much.</br>  <br>Something has to happen between Haise and Goumasa.</br>  <br>She doesn't take part in the Rose investigation.</br>  <br>Hopefully, but I doubt that he'll actually get to torture Haise.</br>  <br>see<br> Some battle happening <br>I don't think it'll happen this soon, we didn't get Kaneki losing it till chapter 60+</br></br></br>  <br>Then again how do we know he already didn't?</br>  <br>Elaborate.</br>  <br>Maybe he did some torture to help him lose his memories and turn him into a beta again.</br>  <br>You do know that Kaneki's memory loss was induced by Arima's brain stabbing.</br>  <br>I'm sure Kaneki had information the CCG wanted to know, they also had to repress him somehow with the "I am Haise Sasaki" bullshit.</br>  <br>see <br>I doubt that the CCG brainwashed him since there's no necessity. The name Sasaki was probably chosen by Haise himself since he probably remembered the last character of his old name which wopuld be "ki", also Sasaki is the most common name with this ending character in Japan. Also there is a japanese historical figure who has many books written about him, his name is Sasaki Hideyoshi.</br></br>  If CCG had blocked all exits into the 20th Ward during the Anteiku Raid, how did Aogiri sneak in AND out?  <br> Sasaki Hideyoshi <br>HOW DEEP DOES THE RABBIT HOLE GO</br></br>  <br><br> this is what yamorifag actually believes <br>tokage isn't a cochlea interrogator, he can't do shit against haise or hinami. pretty sure ishida just wanted to show us who was yamori's torturer and he needed to fill gaps about that character<br><br><br>yeah, ishida will definitively kill off his fujobait, riiight? don't be a fucking retard, ishida can't even kill takizawa. really man, ishida might not have killed anyone; then hide, dog girl and ape are all fucking alive</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dog girl actually lives with Take now, but she has been demoted from Doberman to Shiba-Inu.</br>  <br>*couldn't even kill<br>fuck my typo</br></br>  The chinks scans, when?  <br> can't even kill takizawa <br>I don't see the problem in prolonging and intensifying his suffering. Death would have been a better fate for Takizawa than what he's become now.</br></br>  <br>I don't think some puny RC suppressants could do much if he really went crazy, kakuja and all.</br>  <br><br>Even if he was just determined enough he could probably shrug it off</br></br>  <br>Most of the insecure faggots are here to shit on a easy to bait series with "le edgy/fujoshit" memes so don't expect any discussion held with an audience of highschool students.</br>  <br>We used to have decent discussions, but since the cancer came here they became pretty scarce.</br>  <br>http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3921138400<wbr><br>here you go</br></wbr></br>  Hasie and the Qs know that Uta is a ghoul. Uta then take measurements of each of the Qs and ask them questions.<br><br>Uta’s Shop]<br><br>Sasaki brings the Quinx to the shop.<br><br>Uta: Welcome.<br>Sasaki: Good day, Uta-san.<br>Uta: So these are your subordinates? How young.<br><br>Shirazu looks at Uta’s eyes and talks to Mutsuki.<br><br>Shirazu: …He’s a ghoul right? He IS a ghoul right?<br>Mutsuki: ssssshhhhhh<br>Sasaki: In order to get masks done, everyone’s sizes will be taken.<br>Shirazu: Why a mask? We’re not ghouls.<br>Sasaki: We will become ghouls.<br><br>The Quinx have a worried expression upon hearing that tho Saiko doesn’t seem to be paying attention.<br><br>Shirazu: First girls and now ghouls…?<br><br>Sasaki: You all and me have eyes (kakugan). We also have strength like them. We can pretend to be ghouls.<br><br>So basically, Sasaki wants to blend in the ghoul society to get more information on Roze since there’s surely a limit if you’re going with the human society route.<br><br>Shirazu: That… really sounds dangerous tho…</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mirumo being classy as fuck.</br>  <br>Kek, Kijima is uploading that onto the internet</br>  What is that creepy fuck doing with Arata?  <br>Why is it that this fucker Ishida remembers nothing about a ghoul's sense of smell</br>  <br>What do you mean, they know that he's a ghoul.</br>  <br>what does that have to do with anything?</br>  when tsukiyama and kanae meet the quinx<br><br>tsukiyama: …ki-kun<br>kanae: shu-sama…!?<br><br>suddenly, tsukiyama gets up from the wheelchair and runs towards haise<br>kanae: …! don’t do that!!<br>tsukiyama: calm down, everything’s going well!<br>tsukiyama: (there’s no way kaneki-kun has forgotten me!!)<br>tsukiyama: let’s spend time together again…!! kaneki-kunn!! along with little hinami… it’s ok if banjoi and those underlings of his are there too…!!<br>kanae: shuu-sama!<br>tsukiyama: (let’s fill in the blank time!!)<br><br><br>that's kinda sad</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't think I'd say this, but I actually feel bad for Tsukiyama.</br>  <br> Roze <br>Is that supposed to be Rose or Rize?</br></br>  <br>Does Tsukiyama even remember he wants to eat Kaneki?</br>  <br> trying to relive the times when he actually did something instead of sampling human dishes all around <br> losing his meaning in life when the best tasting dish in your life turned out to be the person you revered has now forgotten you <br>He didn't realize company would affect him that deeply, he was a pandered child when you think about how his dad and servants treats him at home. Not that I blame him. Chie, Kaneki, Hinami and the gang were the only people who he had any meaningful interaction with.<br><br>Roze, Rize is irrelevant for now and they're after the remnants of the Roze family.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>HalfGhouls have a different smell which can easily be noticed by any perceptive ghouls that spends more than a little time around the hybrids' smells.</br></br>  <br>He stopped caring about eating him in the end and just wanted to be his friend.</br>  <br>That's fucking retarded. No wonder the Anime sucks so many dicks when the source material is written so poorly.</br>  <br>See you next week/summer.</br>  Uta starts measuring Urie.<br><br>Uta: Your moles are sexy.<br>Urie: Uh.<br>Urie: (This guy is definitely ghoul no matter how you look at him.)<br><br>Uta: You seem very serious and clever. Can I make your mask really weird?<br>Urie: …Why is that?<br>Uta: It seems fun that way.<br><br>Uta holds and squeezes Urie’s face.<br><br>Urie thinks that shouldn’t they look into Uta first? But also thinks that Haise isn’t an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just fuck off back to tumblr</br>  Uta takes Shirazu’s measurements. Shirazu keeps on eyeing Uta.<br><br>Uta: Your teeth are jagged, that’s really cool. Do you have a girlfriend?<br>Shirazu: Well… Nope.<br><br>Uta: For how long?<br>Shirazu: Hmm, about two years.<br><br>Uta: Do you like girls?<br>Shirazu: Yeah.<br>Uta: Yep, they are cute. Do you have someone in mind?<br>Shirazu: Aaaah… I dun really know?<br><br>Shirazu thinks of Saiko, Akira and Hairu.<br><br>I forgot Shirazu was mentioned to have a gf before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's some depressing shit jeez.</br></br>  <br> Urie thinks that shouldn’t they look into Uta first? But also thinks that Haise isn’t an idiot. <br>Haise's plan is too dangerous when you think about that<br> Uta, a ghoul would sell them out to ghouls <br> Entering a ghoul society without a guide to tell them about their norms <br> Not knowing that Kaneki already has a established identity in their world <br><br>So far it's a interesting chapter if they didn't waste a few panels on Tsukiyama going to CCG instead of having that monologue in his room. They could've had a page for something else important, but that's just nitpicking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He never really tried to kill Kaneki after the restaurant.<br><br>He didn't take any actions when Kaneki was trying to become a kakuja or when kaneki was going back to Anteiku.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck off, they're translations. stop trying to fit in.</br>  <br>Fucking Shirazu, don't touch female Arima.</br>  <br>So Ui just wants Haise to fuck off because he's upset that the halfie's making a career breakthrough?</br>  <br> stop trying to fit in <br>Again with this meme. Can you fuck and stop pretending that you some elitist? How fucking hard is it to realize people hate tumblr here and their trash content which where this art belong to. Fuck off newcancer</br></br>  <br>Damn this is actually pretty sad. I mean some of you little niggers bitch about Tsukiyama but all he wants to do is relive the events and be together with Kaneki, Hinami, Banjou and his group. He pretty much wants to be with the old gang. But all that's gone. Kaneki turned into Haise, Hinami is in Cochela, and Banjou is nowhere to be seen. <br><br>CCG ruined everything.</br></br></br>  <br>not really. It's because<br><br>Sasaki explains his plan of investigating while pretending to be ghouls to Ui but Ui disagrees with his plan. Fura thought it was a good idea until;<br><br>Ui: He’s… dangerous.<br><br>[Ui flashback]<br><br>Ui and others are seen wearing the Zero Squad uniform. They are all holding their Quinques. Sasaki is also wearing the coat but his kagune is sprouting from his back. It seems he went berserk.<br><br>Ui: Arima-san! Haise is…<br>???: He went over his kagune usage limit…! That idiot…<br><br>Sasaki: Ma… <br>(he’s saying the ‘ma’ in arima. he’s calling for arima)<br><br>Arima: …Koori.

Nice.</br>  <br> How fucking hard is it to realize people hate tumblr here <br>And? We're getting translations, unless you can fucking translate this shit for us stop bitching cause no one gives a shit.</br></br>  <br> CCG ruined everything. <br><br>All they did in Tokyo Ghoul was dig themselves a hole.</br></br></br>  <br> We're getting translations <br>You can have the translation while I calling you out.

As it been said many times in the manga Hinami's senses are special/rare for ghouls.</br>  <br> telling me to lurk more while can't even quote properly.  <br>Way to go</br></br>  <br> giving a shit about proper posting etiquette  <br>How fucking new are you or have you been around too long to spread your cancer?<br><br>Yomo knows that anything Uta does means trouble.</br></br></br></br>  <br>relevant music<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F_Y<wbr>7nB_qUmU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br>I actually okay if you admit that you came from tumblr</br></br>  <br> Being this much of a bitch. </br>  <br>So you thinking the cancer is not tumblr any more, tumblrite? Or you think people that complain, asperg here are the cancer? Fuck off</br>  <br>Go home Landwhale. We don't need you shitposting anymore.</br>  <br>Shinohara probably reported on the kakuja. <br><br>Kaneki did disarm 2 associate special class investigators and their squads without breaking a sweat.<br><br>More importantly he managed to land a scratch on Arima.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Special Class Ui <br>  Scared of Haise <br><br>Seriously? Come on people. Your MC wanking is going too far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The CCG ranked him as SS so where's the problem?</br>  <br>Oh, now I'm a landwhale. What the fuck this shit have to do with everything. I'm calling you tumbrite and you calling me landwhale. newcancer doesn't even realize is the cancerous here. Incredible</br>  <br> boogieman argument <br>Listen newfag. 4chan is a site/tool/place for discussion, not a island where we keep out people who we assume as outsiders. You'll be surprised if you took your head out of your ass and realize there are all types of people who can jump on a thread and post. I don't know what shit waters you came from but your silly tough guy act isn't moving any patriotism here. The more you post, the less anyone can take you seriously.</br></br>  <br>You do know that, with exception of Juuzou and Arima, generally, an SS ghoul can easily take on a Special Class, right? Now Ui is also stronger than the average special class, but given his ties with Arima, he probably heard about his fight with Kaneki, as well as how Shinohara lost to Kaneki earlier on.</br>  <br><br>autistic esl etofag pls go. you're not fooling anyone. especially since you're the one who constantly replies to shitposter-kun's bait</br></br>  <br>Wasn't one associate special class, and one special class? The Vash-ripoff was associate, I think, and 'Mmm boy' was special class.</br>  <br> The more you post, the less anyone can take you seriously. <br>You always keep on replying to me like a bunch of faggots. But hey, I discuss shit in here.<br><br>What the fuck are you on?</br></br></br></br>  <br> shitposter-kun <br>Don't be rude. Nobody mentioned him until now. But nice try uta.</br></br>  <br>Actually you responding to that shitposter.</br>  <br>I expected some Sawano-like bombastic shit, but that was actually nice.</br>  Could you all please shut the fuck up already and just discuss the spoilers? Thanks.  <br>Forgot to mention that Haise had a reward and was promoted because he killed a large number of ghouls. Arima tagging him along on whackamole missions must be the result.<br><br> I'll use a post to tell everyone to fuck off <br>Then discuss something.<br><br>Try reading my post.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember that I tried to discuss my shit with you, but instead you told me to kill myself. Only on tg threads.</br>  <br>Is that Hairu in the bottom panel?</br>  <br>I see. good one.</br>  <br>That was my first guess and this is a flashback before she transferred from squad 0. So yeah</br>  <br> Forgot to mention that Haise had a reward and was promoted because he killed a large number of ghouls. Arima tagging him along on whackamole missions must be the result. <br><br>Then I suppose the idea of Haise being a lot more vicious before is kinda true. I mean, the Haise we are seeing wouldn't even try to get near his limits so easily, while the one in this chapter in the flashback outdid himself and went crazy.<br><br>Maybe he really was bloodthirsty at first, and later, maybe after the operation in the flashback, he turned more and more into a beta, scared of losing control.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>did they get done fucking? why are they smoking together so sensually?</br>  <br> not a island where we keep out people who we assume as outsiders <br>Clearly when tumblr invaded 4chan it wasn't the case. Just mentioning that.</br></br>  <br> beta, scared of losing control. <br>He's always like that as kuroneki. The only reason why he acted cold as shironeki was to let loose and embrace his violence. Being in CCG around people who can take care of that violent self mellowed him out and he's afraid that he's hopeless if left a home all alone where he can't eat and behave without killing someone by accident. That's a ok premise in the start but now it's really tiring and even his new split personality is tired of his ignorance. I think Ishida is either trying to embrace the new cop drama setting as a new direction or his editors want to make Haise last longer.</br></br>  <br>Why do the editors want to keep him around longer if the creator and readers are getting tired of him?</br>  <br>The job of the editor is to make sure the work is plausible and earn them as much bucks as it is. I'm not entirely sure how Japan fanbase feels about Haise but he's voted one of top 4 in the recent poll iirc. Moreover, Ishida does a lot of side stuff during the time when the anime was ongoing. Just because the fanbase here hates him doesn't mean anything if the magazine's profits aren't affected.</br>  <br>I've been here longer than you<br> I actually okay <br>I actually okay if you stop coming to these threads.</br></br></br>  <br>Tokyo Ghoul:re Vol.1 in 5 weeks = 637,988<br>Tokyo Ghoul:re Vol.2 in 5 weeks = 768,219<br>Tokyo Ghoul:re Vol.3 in 5 weeks = 786,118<br><br>Anon each Vol of Tokyo Ghoul is increasing in sales. The third Vol outdid the other 2 Vols. So why would they immediately kill off Haise when sales are going real strong. It's a Editor's job to milk a series as much as possible. And the Nips don't seem to dislike Haise or maybe it's because reading a whole Tankobon is better than waiting weekly for a chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lets be real here Ishida is at a level where a editor can't really tell him how do his work.</br>  <br>Kaneki won't show up again until chapter 60 because muh parallels.</br>  <br> inb4 stop sucking Ishida's dick. </br>  <br>Only we, the shiteaters on /a/, are sick of the way TG is right now.<br><br>Western readers don't mean shit. He said it himself; his Japanese readers are very important to him.</br></br></br>  <br>The Editor can tell him whatever the fuck he wants to because this is his first hit. I mean even Togashi when he had a hit like Yu Yu Hakusho he couldn't do shit and the Editor had power over him. It was only till HxH he did whatever the fuck he wanted.</br>  <br> He said it himself; his Japanese readers are very important to him. <br><br>B-But..Ishida-sama said he loved us too!</br></br></br>  <br> It was only till HxH he did whatever the fuck he wanted. <br>That was the worst mistake ever letting that lazy fuck get to do what he wanted.<br> Muh back. </br></br></br>  <br>And this why people shit on tg. It's good that the threads stopped being daily.</br>  <br>Most of the Shonenshits are reading that generic Hero Academia series which is why it's starting to get a lot of daily threads.</br>  <br>Gotta make some dough from the shitty dub release of Root A right?</br>  <br>This is wrong. And we also don't know if the editor helps him or not. People always shit on editors but we don't know if they actually help stuff. I think togashis ex-editor had said that he felt the mid part of the cell saga was when dbz was going down.<br><br>Another thing to note. Kishimoto had been told iirc to make more naruto which fucked the story up. He banked tho.</br></br></br>  W-Well?  <br>Saras 2nd best after Chris.</br>  <br>Chris is second best after Seraphim.</br>  Picked up  s3 by a competent studio fucking when  Maids aren't really my thing.<br><br>I guess it depends who wears it</br></br>  <br>wat dis from op?</br>  <br>Seraphim is shit</br>    No, you piece of shit.      <br>What a slut.</br>  <br>Come again?</br>  <br>SLUT<br>L<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with that?</br>  <br>She's not sucking me off, that's what.</br>  <br>She would have a hard time finding something that she can suck off.</br>    <br>Eu and Dai Sensei wouldn't because they actually make me hard.

Thanks.  <br>I'd just like to try my hand at it. I started drawing in these threads to practice, so I thought it'd be nice to try drawing men, too. Digital, that is. I can KINDA draw guys (like in my pic) when it's just paper and pencil.<br><br>Sorry, I didn't mean for it to come off that I thought husbandos didn't get drawn a lot.
