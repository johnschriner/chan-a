[ It made me laugh, it moved me to tears. It made me get up on the edge of my seat, and it made me ponder some of life's greatest conundrums. <br>After I finished watching the final season, I thought "Will I ever experience something like this again?". And the truth is, I won't, because there is nothing quite like it. This is a beautiful piece of animation.<br>Cory is a relatable character, and we see this as he battles his inner demons throughout the series and vanquishes evil. When he gives the speech to the viewer at the end, a tear wells up in my eye, after so much character development, and losses and successes, we see how personal strength and cooperation can achieve anything.<br>I'd just like to say thanks for recommending this anime, everyone.

Watching Cell go from super-cocky to 'Oh shit. Ooooh shit. Ooooooooooooooooooh shiiiiiiiiiiiiit' in the space of five minutes was glorious.<br><br> And that Father-Son Kamehameha is still one of my favourite scenes of not just any anime, but any film medium in general </br></br>  <br>What is wrong with your faaaaace?</br>  <br>I like the Vegeta fight better. Goku overcomes Vegeta's natural ability just with talent and effort, but then Vegeta transforms and even Goku is overwhelmed. The Goku's body is so wrecked he has to use Gohan and Krillin to fight him by proxy. And even that's not enough, and they're just barely saved by Gohan's tail growing back at the last second. It's really the perfect climax to the "Earth" portion of Dragon Ball.</br>  <br>Kenshiro vs. Han<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=B3w<wbr>se_64LI0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Also, the fight is one of the prettiest parts of the whole manga. Especially the ones fully colored by Toriyama of right before the fight.</br>  <br>Once Goku is on an even footing with Vegeta, or even slightly ahead of him (like the Goku v Majin Vegeta fight), there's literally no reason for him to not rack up Super Saiyan 2 and then bump on Kaio-Ken x3 to triple his power level for one or two earth-shattering punches.</br>  <br> I wish it was animated. </br>  <br>I like to think that's how Cell Games Goku was so strong. After he mastered his Super Saiyan form, he was able to use the Kaioken at the same time. Goku was able to use the 10x Kaioken against Frieza without the audience knowing, so it's totally possible it's used later on without it being visible. <br><br>Also, I think that by the end of the series all of the fighters can use the Kaioken, or something similar to it.</br></br></br>  <br>I might just be making stuff up but I think it's supported by the manga.</br>  <br>It's been confirmed that he's only used Super Kaio-Ken once, and that was non-canon in that Strongest in the Universe competition.<br><br>I doubt he would've used it in the Cell Games, simply because along with the multiplied power boost, it also multiplies the ki drain. It would be near-lethal for Goku to stay in Full Power Super Saiyan, and THEN activate Kaio-Ken for any length of time on top of that.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5C9<wbr>QVGjvqj0</wbr>  [ ]<br>Fucking yes bruv</br></br>  <br>Almost any Bleach fight.</br>  <br>Probably the highest point of the series for me. Its a shame they moved away from that kind of fighting to do more ninja wizard battles</br>  <br>Goku can use the Kaioken without us seeing him use it. He did it against Frieza. Just because Goku never shouts out "Super Kaioken!" doesn't mean he never uses the Kaioken while Super Saiyan. <br><br>Also, Full Power Super Saiyan doesn't have any ki drain.

For fucks sake! </br></br></br>  <br>Luffy vs Blueno is better  in the anime </br>  Every single battle from Berserk  Ippo vs Mashiba  How was kenshi vs saitou not posted yet?<br><br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NuMnY<wbr>lB76eA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I didn't like the first few of the fights in Rurouni Kenshin - like against Jin-E or most of the Oniwaban. The manga is drawn to make it look like there's wicked-fast movement interspersed with lightning-fast flurries of blows, but in the anime it's just one or two high-speed attacks before a several second pause, and repeat.<br><br>I'm still enjoying it, but I'm largely underwhelmed.</br></br></br>  <br> animated by one of the best animators in the industry <br> not amazing </br></br>  <br>Alright, but I prefer dubbed Goku to kiddie Goku any day of the year.</br>  <br> otherwise train their eyes to resist bright flashes? <br><br>...Because that's not possible, retard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's why you should kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>My nigga</br>  <br> one of the worst animators in the industry <br>Ftfy</br></br>  <br>Si eres fuerte, vives<br>Si eres debil, mueres.<br>What a great battle.</br></br></br>  <br> Norio Matsumoto <br> not the GOAT animator </br></br>  <br> &gt;not the GOAT animator <br> Making Naruto <br>Pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Yusuke vs Toguro/Sensui<br>Netero vs Meruem<br>Kenshin vs Saito<br>Shohoku vs Mitsui's band<br>Piccolo vs 17</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yamcha vs Saibaman</br>   people seriously posting nurutu/one piss/dragon ball <br> when hokuto no ken exists <br><br>summer it sure is summer</br></br></br>  <br>It can't be great if the animation is fucking crap.</br>  Meruem vs Netero was better  Faggots, all of you  <br>You'd be surprised at how many great animators have worked on Naruto before.</br>  <br><br>Krilin vs Goku was the best fight in Dragonball (including Z, GT, Super, the movies etc.)<br><br>Goku vs Tien (first battle) is Nr. 2<br><br>Goku vs Jr. is Nr. 3</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My favorite OP battle is Strawhats vs Oz. I like seeing them fight as a team. Strawhats vs Pacifista was ok too (before they were dominated).</br></br>  <br> Lets face it UBW fights were shit, too short and didn't feel like there was any danger <br> lists two of the shortest and anti-climactic fights as the only good ones <br><br>Way to contradict yourself mate. Also best fight is the Archer vs. Lancer fight in the prologue.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Raoh vs Toki &gt; all.</br></br>  <br>My dick vs your mouth.</br>  <br>My vote too.<br><br> dem Guanyin bitchslaps <br> dat fucking Zero Hand <br> dat classic Togashi lolnuke trolling in the end </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>second</br>  <br>Kenshin vs Saito<br>Any Kenshin fight</br></br>  <br>When the fuck did this happen?</br>  <br><br><br>You gotta be kidding me. That fight was absolute shit. <br><br>Despite Netero being hyped as hell, he could do nothing against Meruem. He only used the same attack over and over. <br><br>The worst thing is how the fight ends. That bomb was a complete asspull and it actually defeated Meruem. A mass produced item almost kills the strongest enemy to this point, effectively rendering Nen fucking useless and pointless. One also has to wonder: Why didn't they just use the bomb against the ants from the fucking beginning? <br><br>The battle was one-sided and ended with a giant cop out that pissed me off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1538<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1529:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn <br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1537 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting Reimu holding a freshly prepared onahole on a silver food platter for her husbando.    /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.

Light took the world's crime rates down by 70%, so why did the government and police try and stop him?  killing is wrong  Because no government wants to admit that some bored high school/college kid can do their job better than them.  <br><br>His way of doing things was wrong.</br></br>  <br>Yet Police and Government kills people every day. Wars, people who commit crimes aka death Penalty. That's a contradiction.</br>  <br><br>Because he didn't enLIGHT them about his plan</br></br>  cause the show wouldnt have a plot if they didnt  <br>Doing whatever it takes to make the world a better place isn't wrong in the slightest. It's wrong to those who believe society is the benefactor to judging a person's fate.</br>  <br> he didn't enlighten them about his keikaku <br>Fixed</br></br>  <br><br>Note: keikaku means plan</br></br>  <br> Doing whatever it takes to make the world a better place isn't wrong in the slightest <br>That's exactly what Hitler thought. Look at what horrible things he did because of that attitude.</br></br>  <br>They knew by the fact that he was willing to commit that much murder just for some fucked-up ideals that he was a volatile and dangerous individual wielding unbelievable power. He had to be stopped because they realized that even as he was using his power for good at the start, he had the ability and the will to take his ideals too far.</br>  <br>If your only claim to your defense is Hitler then you vastly overestimate your side of the argument. Hitler wanted to make the world a better place in high eyes, you're implying that everyone thinks like Hitler which obviously isn't the case.</br>  <br>They do in Japan?</br>  <br>Because he was a notable force that they could not control.</br>  He was breaking the law, and no one is above the law, what he did would not go unpunished, when he took steps to kill off innocent investigators or people who were on their way to stop him is when it stepped into killing their officials. <br><br>Light was certainly cheap and probably reduced all sorts of cost for the government though as housing criminals especially deathrow inmates is not cheap. <br><br>But in plain, he broke the law and could not go unpunished for it. He's not above the law or responsibility.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because he's correct, it doesn't make him right.</br>  <br>Because crime is money.</br>  <br>so they could get the death note for themselves</br>  Light is a dumbass. He wouldn't have to worry about being stopped if he didn't make himself so easy to track.   MUH KILLING IS WRONG <br> MUH YOU CAN'T PLAY KAMI-SAMA <br> MUH RAITO WAS EVIL <br>Let's get these out of the way.</br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't a social democrat, their humanist ideologies &amp; power base supersede rationality or equally any quest for an ideological good.</br>  Would you actually like to live in a world where any crime can possibly lead to death sentence without due process?  <br>Light was, oddly enough, very local.<br><br>But that can be chalked up to his age really, doubt he had much perspective beyond the peripherally domestic.</br></br></br>  Wasn't he killing people who had already been sentenced for their crimes? He went from killing murderers and rapists to killing petty criminals if I recall. And by the end wasn't he killing people before they even got a chance at trial?  <br>What in the fuck are you going on about</br>  <br>Hitler got rid of 6 million jews, why did everyone want him dead?</br>  <br>It's a translation note.</br>  <br>It does when you have the power. <br><br><br>Truth<br><br><br>When you have power like that, you are above the law. You're above the government and those who produced the law, the people who are known to exploit the law for their benefit. <br><br><br>Truth<br><br> Light is a dumbass. He wouldn't have to worry about being stopped if he didn't make himself so easy to track. <br> <br>Truth</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one thinks like Light either. Cause he's a sociopath. And crazy</br>  <br>He was killing convicts and any even suspects that he saw on the news.</br>  <br>And if you kill everyone on earth, there will be 0% of crime.<br>Also, he killed some innocent people for his own benefit.</br></br>  <br>Cause he's a mass murderer despite that.<br>Crime rate might go down, but that would be the result solely out of causing terror and striking fear into people.<br><br>There is no excuse for killing thousands.Even if it helped to lower the crime rate, he was still a mere mass murderer himself who had to be brought down.<br><br>Also, those who have power often get seduced by it.Just as it did with Light, who gazed deeper and deeper into the abyss, and the abyss didn't just gaze back but he jumped right in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> And if you kill everyone on earth, there will be 0% of crime. <br>Judge Dead is that you?</br></br></br>  <br> being this new <br><br>Am I being baited?<br><br> inb4 I was merely pretending </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you are above the law. You're above the government and those who produced the law, <br><br>Obviously not considering they brought him down and he acknowledged them as a threat. I would be silly to think he was so much above them, he's just a man with a book.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It'd be funny if hitler or light didn't die and were jailed instead, they'd get a fuckton of fan mail.</br></br>  <br>And the government is a bunch of old dude in congress, figureheads, etc. What's your point?</br>  <br>Because he wasn't properly elected.</br>  If they didn't stop him, they'd lose their jobs  <br>Because of budget cuts.</br>  <br><br>What's yours? <br><br>They were to stop Light, Light isn't fucking Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet here, he's within their power they just need to find out who he is to stop him, and they did.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yet Police and Government kills people every day <br><br>yeah, maybe in third world shitholes like USA. Remember to eat your daily burger too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is an excuse for killing thousands if it's for a good cause that you believe in. Morality is mankind's biggest setback. You think our worldly peace is done by not killing? Every government on earth has caused at least more than 1 million deaths each in wars they've took part in. So your society would also be included.<br><br>What's good for the goose is good for the gander.</br></br></br>  Because killing criminals to the point where crime ceases to occur leaves the police, judicial and prison systems without work and revenue.<br><br>Oh, yeah, and killing is wrong lel</br></br>  <br> Every government on earth has caused at least more than 1 million deaths each in wars they've took part in. <br><br>I'm pretty sure that's not actually true.</br></br></br>  <br>Government isn't fucking Thanos either, a collective body of people still don't make them better than one person. I thought all killing was evil, but society's proved that wrong. There's two sides to it. And you seem to think that a government (which is known to have just as many corrupt, evil people in it) is better than one man handing out the justice the world needed? I don't agree with that.</br>  <br>Yeah. <br><br>Let's say he killed 20 innocent fucks. <br><br>Who cares? He saved MILLIONS with that, hell. Billions probably</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>USA was built off wars and murder<br><br>China was built off wars and killing to unite nations<br><br>Two of our biggest countries got their start off murder.</br></br></br></br></br>   there are still 30% of criminals who aren't afraid of kira. <br>who are those based heroes?</br>  <br>As a warning to any "L" wannabe I would've started killing world leaders and banksters left and right.</br>  <br> Am I being baited? <br> &gt;inb4 I was merely pretending <br>Do you want him to say he was pretending or not? Choose one you stupid faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are two governments.</br>  <br>"Every employee and share holder of 4kids and Funimation."</br>  <br>Probably crimes without meditation. Accidents, etc. Those tend to happen a lot. <br>Crime of passion<br>Since those people weren't thinking when they did it's not that they didn't fear Kira, it's just that their chips went off that moment</br></br></br>  <br>this. also religious leaders. not because of edginess, but just to show everyone that their religion is wrong, which in that universe, it clearly is, since there are death notes and a whole dimension of demons that no religion is aware of, it's pretty clear none of them have the right idea.</br>  <br>Kerry pls.</br>  <br> Government isn't fucking Thanos either <br><br>Uhhh, they don't have to be. Why in the world would they have to? They're a large group of smart people trying to stop a smart man with a powerful weapon that can kill individuals, Light isn't unstoppable and that was proven. <br><br> And you seem to think that a government (which is known to have just as many corrupt, evil people in it) is better than one man handing out the justice the world needed? <br><br>On one hand you have a corrupt man who has to go through a ton of shit and may be stopped by a good on, on the other you have a man trying to build a peaceful utopia off of killing people who don't fit in his idea as he tries to become god, he can change his ideals at any moment, no one man should have the power to decide the fate of the planet, if one day he decided he wants thieves out of the world, they're fucked, if I get falsely charged for being a thief i'm fucked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's only a selfish excuse.<br>And I'm not as fucked up in my head yet to say it's good because I believe in it cause it still destroyed the lives of others, those left behind.Lovers, friend, family etc.<br>And this peace being caused by killing and wars only proves humans failed as a thinking animal.</br></br></br>  lol at all you morons.<br><br>Light didnt kill anyone. The book did. He did nothing wrong</br></br>  <br>But Kerry didn't save anyone(well the plane would've been a major thing but we don't know) and his innocent count is probably in the Ks considering all the shit he's done. <br><br>Light actually saved people and those innocents he killed were after him so he had no choice.</br></br></br>  <br>Books don't kill people. People kill people.</br>   why is summary execution bad you guys??? <br><br>Every time I start to forget /a/ is populated mostly by people under the age of 21 a thread like this pops up to remind me.</br></br>   be police <br> in 2 months crime goes down 70% <br> no need for me anymore <br> be jobless <br>So, you question is why did the government and police try and stop him?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Himmler didn't kill all those people. The gas did.</br>  Light was going to start killing people for being lazy, he was a nutjob that needed to be stopped  <br>same here</br>  <br>Could you say the same thing if your waifu was on the victim list?</br>  <br> Light actually saved people and those innocents he killed were after him so he had no choice. <br><br>Fuck off, Light was playing with the thought to kill his imouto just so he can continue on his dictator throne.<br>And don't give me "but he didn't do it".<br>The fact he was actually considering it by itself is messed up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  he can change his ideals at any moment, no one man should have the power to decide the fate of the planet, if one day he decided he wants thieves out of the world, they're fucked, if I get falsely charged for being a thief i'm fucked. <br><br>That's your problem, that peace is Light wanted is built off his lies just as the world before Light did his deeds was like. Either way pretending the world is an okay place in either doesn't make it right. You simply agree with society before light because it's better suited for you, but is it better suited for those who are killed by a thief or criminal as you stated? No.<br><br> Uhhh, they don't have to be. Why in the world would they have to? They're a large group of smart people trying to stop a smart man with a powerful weapon that can kill individuals, Light isn't unstoppable and that was proven.  <br><br>By killing light they proved they wanted to be Thanos, they stopped someone who was doing what he seen as right, that doesn't make them any better than him killing off those who knew he was Kira. I'm sure their government has powerful weapons as well. Society and Government doesn't like someone who is on their level or above their level in power. That's why he had to be stopped, not cause of his killings or to protect their people or the world. It was for their own agenda.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can forget we came from animals, your morality is what keeps you back from doing what needed to be done. I bet you'd let someone kill you if they were trying to take your life. Would you kill them if it resorted to that? I doubt it by your response.</br>  <br><br>Because he was executing people who weren't actually convicted yet.<br><br>That's probably the only major reason.<br><br><br><br>I think he actually went after a large amount of international criminals, perhaps mostly as time went on. That's how he caught the attention of the authorities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Books don't kill people. People kill people...with books. Old people burning old people burning, put your hands up!<br><br> he still believe in gas </br></br></br>  <br>killing innocent people is never ok</br>  because he was playing god, and no human is allowed to do that  <br><br>Because if he did their job efficiently without needing tax dollars, then they could just lay off most of the police departments and no-one would care.</br></br>  <br>I consider killing people that piss me off, doesn't mean I will do it. <br><br>Normal people think things all the time, rape, murder, shit like that.<br>What differentiates them from psychos is that they have the brain to stop themselves. Psychos just do what they want</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, Ryuk said there's not Heaven nor Hell</br>  <br>He wasn't playing god. He had a notebook that literally turned him into a god of death. <br><br>He was pretty much a demi-god.<br><br><br>There's no heaven or hell and normal people just vanish. People that use the Death Note go somewhere else  become Shinigami, probably </br></br></br></br></br></br>   "I'm god! I choose who is good or bad!" <br> use police, justice system, and prison system to decide <br><br>I never understood this</br></br></br>  <br>Why would I kill them?<br>I would disarm or immobilize them at best.<br>And if the grudge against me is too deep, I actually wouldn't mind.</br></br></br>  <br>in a universe where there are demons and no sign of a 'god' anywhere.</br>  <br> That's your problem <br><br>That's the planets problem not just mine alot of people are going to get fucked, false charges and other bullshit will ruin innocents.<br><br> Either way pretending the world is an okay place in either doesn't make it right.  <br><br>Making life a trapzone where one mistake can lead you to heart attack city isn't better, i'm not living in consistent fear that one day for some reason my heart will stop because some unknown deity like being went insane. <br><br><br> By killing light they proved they wanted to be Thanos <br><br>Ryuk killed Light, Light was pretty much going insane and they felt they had to defend themselves. You said light had the power to be above the law, government and those who produce it, they're not IG Thanos for trying to enforce it and succeeding to. Light was just a boy with a deadly weapon. <br><br> I'm sure their government has powerful weapons as well. <br><br>lol, what's your point? <br>We're not dropping a nuke on some suburban neighborhood because some dude there killed a man, and they're certainly not being used to kill off randoms who crimes they committed god knows how long ago. That has nothing to do with anything. We fly drones over places but they're not all over the world and will bomb you for a simple mistake. <br><br>Either all, the original point stands, Light isn't, wasn't above anything, that was proven when he got fucked and begged Ryuk to save him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Thinking you have any right to play god and decide who lives and who dies. <br><br>I bet you're a Griffith sympathizer aswell.</br></br>  he was stupid for not using the methods of death the the notebook gave him. just fucking heart attacks all around. get fucking creative, man.  <br>Which almost happened</br>  <br>Death is equal you goober</br>  <br>Francis, please.</br>  <br>Prison = Profit. He was hurting the private prisons.</br>  <br>He did that on purpose because he wanted people to acknowledge him you dungrus</br>  <br>he could have had people die in different ways, but write 'Kira' with their blood or something before it happens.</br>  All the government cares about is maintaining control. If someone else did their job for them they would be picking up trash on the highway.  <br>That's stupid, then he would blow his cover that he can kill in different ways than heart attacks which for a while was his silver bullet</br>  <br> Ryuk killed Light <br><br>After he was shot how many times by police?<br><br><br> Making life a trapzone where one mistake can lead you to heart attack city isn't better, i'm not living in consistent fear <br><br>So you agree you stick to a pretend society because you fear the a new one. You're ok with people being killed by regular criminals and crimes happening the way society dictates them to be.<br><br> lol, what's your point? <br><br>No but they send police and in many incidences, police are killed by said dude who killed a man. Sending people to their death, whether they signed up for it or not is wrong as well right? where do you draw the line?<br><br> Either all, the original point stands, Light isn't, wasn't above anything, that was proven when he got fucked and begged Ryuk to save him. <br><br>You basically here proved they wanted to be Thanos, They shot him prior to Ryuk killing him. Arresting him was an option but they knew light would never allow they. They were ready to kill him at any time. That makes them no better than him killing. They're all murders. Light, The Government, etc. And you're not going to try and convince me he was wrong for what he did or government killing is justified moreso than his.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how is it a 'cover', exactly? they already know he can kill without meeting or being close to the person.<br>doing different things will only throw off whoever's trying to get him.</br></br>  <br>Hate to say it, but that's a slippery slide there. Doing whatever it takes to make the world a better place according to your beliefs might be right for you, but not for other people. Who the fuck gave you the right to impose your morals over others?<br><br>Also there's a neat little board for all this </br></br></br>  <br>because he was an edgelord</br>  <br>The death note you stupid motherfucker.</br>  <br>They didn't know he could basically control people before they die.</br>  <br><br> After he was shot how many times by police? <br><br>After Light went insane and was making a move to kill them they acted in self defense as Light is a dude who was able to kill men miles away. They have no idea what trick up his sleave he could've had. Also he wasn't killed by the gunshots so again, what's your point? They were corrupt for shooting him while he was making a move to kill them all? What should they have done? Ask him politely to stop and read him his rights? <br><br> So you agree you stick to a pretend society because you fear the a new one. You're ok with people being killed by regular criminals and crimes happening the way society dictates them to be. <br><br>People are still going to be killed by regular criminals regardless, it wont happen often but it'll still happen, shit like rape, assault, burglary, theft will also still happen and when the murders die down cries for criminals to die will continue and petty crimes will face judgement with it. <br><br> No but they send police and in many incidences, police are killed by said dude who killed a man. Sending people to their death, whether they signed up for it or not is wrong as well right? where do you draw the line? <br><br>It's a risky job, accidents happen, it's just something we have to live by, and it's something that's obvious for those who sign up. <br><br> Sending people to their death, whether they signed up for it or not is wrong as well right? <br><br>It's on no ones except the criminals fault and no one but the criminal is to blame, they are punished by law and we mourn them afterwards. <br><br> You basically here proved they wanted to be Thanos, They shot him prior to Ryuk killing him <br><br>Because he tried to fucking kill them. <br><br> Arresting him was an option  <br><br>Fucking what? Did you want them to ask him to put his hands behind his back while he was writing their names down or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the Death Note gave you the ability to kill, not any right. You obviously can, and people will obviously try to get you.</br>  <br> After he was shot how many times by police? <br>Ryuk knew his lifespan from the very beginning. He knew he'd survive and spend his life in prison so he 'spared' him that fate.</br></br>  <br>Anon there is a serious flaw with a single person holding all the power. It can go wrong in so many ways, it's not worth the risk. We saw Light in the end killing everyone that got in his way because he wanted to impose his ideals on everyone.</br>  <br>but even they did know, how will they effect him badly in any way? it'll just add to his mythos.</br>  because he acted above the law, and could indiscriminately kill anyone anywhere right out of the fucking blue.<br><br>Light's actions had the side effect of curbing crime, but they were ultimately not the end goal. Rather, his delusions of grandeur gave way to a god complex, and so punishment no longer meant anything as a function of people defacing the law, but instead as a function of how undesirable that person is to Light's little kingdom.<br><br>To make a long story short, he's a hypocrite, no better than the criminals he killed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>BTFO</br>  <br> police literally haven't killed a single person in 50 years <br> sandniggers don't count <br>guess the country</br></br></br>  <br>Did he became a shinigami or not.</br>  <br> Light took the world's crime rates down by 70%, so why did the government and police try and stop him? <br><br>Being a vigilante = criminal act<br>Killing = criminal act</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he was ever caught he could force one of them to kill the others somehow, they would never see it coming. It's just a measure to really make sure.</br>  <br>You can take the world's crime rates down by 100% by killing everyone too</br>  <br>Because they want people to believe and depend on them. Governments wouldn't care as much, if he didn't start doing it as Kira and on far lesser scale, so they could be try covering it somehow up. With enough time people would start rioting saying police isn't needed, next step would be choosing Kira as new world king.<br>I might not remember well, but I think in begining Light killed only criminals with really long (lifelong?) sentences, while later started killing more people, just to keep killing and still 'exist' in people's mind. He took it too far.</br></br>  <br> Look at what horrible things he did <br>name some</br></br>  <br>Hitler tried to better all of society by forcing everyone to be a functioning member and extinguishing those that could not be or that hindered society. Why in the fuck the the allies want to go against a man trying to make the world into a utopia? <br> It's the same principal. Hippies don't get it and this is more of a society kind of question to a /a/ one.</br></br>  <br>Genocide? War crimes? Even if you're a holocaust denier, you can't deny the war crimes.<br><br>There's a reason some of his top generals wanted him out.</br></br></br>  <br> Though his issue wasn't necessarily absolute power.</br>  <br>He was taking advantage of his situation, and weeding out the weak links</br>  Holy shit it was never about his taking their job or just maintaining order. It was about how you can't give a person that kind of power and except him not to decline into a slippery slope. Eventually Light would start killing people for minor things like littering and then society would be afraid to do anything ever.  <br>Weeding out the weak links includes massacring innocent civilians?<br>Also, Hitler without his generals = shit at war.</br></br>  <br>Thats a terrible argument because he gets all of his victims from national and international news which doesn't cover minor criminals. If he started persecuting minor criminals based out of his local newspaper (or even ordering others) he would be easy as shit to track down.</br>   M-MUH LAWS! <br><br>Most countries don't have laws against using magic.</br></br>  <br>The allies committed just as many as Germany and the Soviets. Of course you know that isn't included in history books or shows but you can ask surviving soldiers.</br>  <br><br>Same reason they stop vigilantes.</br></br>  <br>Are you new to law? The law doesn't stipulate every single means or weapon of committing a murder. There might be some differentiation when it comes to things like firearms, but if they can show you used lethal force with intent with your magic then its all the same.</br>  <br>Because he was someone that the bigwigs (the government) couldn't control so he needed to be eliminated<br><br>The police just enforce the will of the government</br></br></br>  <br>But vigilantes <br><br> Often attack people who are merely under suspicion of a crime <br> Have dangerous methods of acquisition that can harm others in the area <br> Are not able to be held accountable like officers are until apprehended <br><br>Light was killing people who were already convicted of crimes without any risk to people nearby. You could argue that its not his right to override court ruling, but the show demonstrated that he definitely achieved positive results globally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no. He just died like a bitch and will be forgotten within a generation. His smug sense of self importance drove him to throw away every possible chance at happiness so he could become "a god of a new world" which wouldn't even last.</br>  <br>There aren't rules about using otters too but if you kill someone by smashing his skull with an armored otter it's still murder sherlock</br>  <br>Didn't he say at one point "I will show the world that opposing Kira will get you killed or something like that?</br>  <br>Someone with the intent of stopping someone from killing criminals in a safe and efficient manner once proven guilty is no better than a criminal.</br>  <br>That might be the case if you threw fireballs in broad daylight.<br>You'd only need to destroy the book and there would be no evidence at all.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035112 <br>mad as fuck</br>  <br><br>Because crime is useful.</br></br>  <br>He gassed 6 million innocent Jews.</br>  <br>yes we all know light is a massive retard for losing even with magic<br>every single guy in this thread could fool the whole world if he had the death note</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035232 <br>ok</br>  <br> The allies committed just as many as Germany <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>You make the police sound evil.</br>  <br><br> yazuka work under the government/elite's umbrella <br> yakuza don't kill people <br><br>Don't you have to practice your katana skills in preparation for moving to glorious Japan, faggot?</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035112 <br> discussing the plot of an anime is not anime related <br>muh imageboard</br></br>  <br><br> Light was killing people who were already convicted of crimes without any risk to people nearby. <br><br>So was pic related and look at how he ended up.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035112 <br>Global rule 7<br>Replying to a thread stating that you've reported or "saged" it, or another post, is also not allowed.</br></br>  <br>Japan practiced the death penalty last time I checked.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035469 <br> ethics and killing are unrelated to an anime about ethics and killing <br>go back to your fate thread</br></br>  <br>Because muh feels.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035620 <br>no, you are just a whiny shit</br>  <br>Because they're edgy retards.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128035786 <br>what are you going to do about it</br>  So many incorrect life livers in this thread.  I never realised Light is a libertarian hero.  <br>the government were afraid the dn would be used against them.<br><br>besides, that note is a really valuable wepaon. even more valuable than nukes.</br></br></br>  <br>You might be more powerful than the law, but that doesn't mean you aren't held accountable by someone for your actions. And you can try to stop them from finding you out, as Light tried, but eventually you goof up (as he also did)</br>  <br><br>Because his improvements were only temporary.<br><br>And there were hints that the next step of his brilliant plan was eugenesia for the poor, lazy and stupid people.</br></br></br></br>  <br> libertarian hero <br><br>What? He's a textbook definition of a tyrant.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That was Mikami getting ahead of himself.</br></br>  <br><br>Ryuk was a blatant liar though.</br></br>  The power of final judgment really shouldn't reside in a demonstrably unstable college kid. And what do you know, as soon as someone started turning up the heat he started killing innocents to protect his position. He was a coward, he wasn't fit to rule, and he died like a rabid dog without anyone but the police knowing who he was.  <br>He was explaining one of the rules of the DN though.</br>  <br> people don't kill people, guns kill people </br>  <br><br>Well, it is true.<br><br>Do you think a pussy bitch like Light could kill anyone with his own hands?<br><br>It was the book the one who gave him the ability of killing people from the distance without dealing with any sort of direct consequences.<br><br>Its kinda like school shooters, most of 'em are pussy bitches too until they get their hands on some OP artifacts like guns and explosives.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I had the book I'd just fuck over society.<br> Kill off the entire presidential succession line <br> we power struggle now <br> Drop foreign politicians left and right <br> Christians start saying it's the will of god <br> drop them shortly after for the lols. world war in no time as all governments become too unstable to keep the state together. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying any Jew is innocent </br>  <br> Jews <br> Innocent <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br> gassing kikes <br> bad <br>HAHA le xD literally xd'd xD</br></br></br>  <br>Most serial killers did it using cowardly methods.

The general idea in stopping him was not that he was evil or that he was not making the world a better place, but that he had power over them. Much of government and police are out for their own gain, not to make the world a better place. And then there are the people who think what he did is morally wrong. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Nonsense.<br><br><br>Highly opinionated. <br><br><br><br>These.<br><br><br>Self-defense.<br><br><br>He was incredibly thoughtful about most of his moves, with a select few slip-ups that should be very hard for anyone to catch on to.<br><br><br>Irrelevant.<br><br><br>A lot of it became rumors/myths. Many of the killings were done by other people with death notes. Undoubtedly, he made some errors at some point though.<br><br><br>Light is far from a sociopath. At least until the last couple episodes.<br><br><br> innocent <br>Well, he killed people that would have prevented him from continuing. He never just went at random.<br><br><br> There is no excuse for killing thousands <br>Saving millions? What about war? Those have existed and many of the people responsible for them aren't punished in any way. <br><br><br>Many of them volunteered to go after kira. <br><br><br>They didn't know that. Only L speculated that. <br><br><br> Every government on earth has caused at least more than 1 million deaths each <br>Yeah, that's not true at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If the death note has infinite pages, shouldn't that mean it also has infinite mass? How is it not tearing the entire universe apart?  <br>Whatevs I gave my reasoning, pretty much all conservatives are in favor of the death penalty, but would you say they're edgy?</br>  he was a megalomaniac  <br>Also keep in mind, I never said suffering. When Light killed his victims, it was always a simple heart attack, which in itself can be painful, but doesn't come close to gruesome suffering.</br>  <br> Irrelevant. <br>It's fucking not</br></br>  <br>i know he killed one dude in a car accident, and i'm pretty sure he killed more in similar ways</br>  <br>Sure did. Point?<br><br><br>People who didn't think they would get caught, didn't think their crimes were severe enough, didn't think they were committing a crime to begin with, committed a crime in the heat of the moment, and people who just don't give a fuck (likely out of stupidity).<br><br><br>That would cause chaos. He is looking to make the world a better place.<br><br><br>They'd become martyrs. Religious people are perfectly fine with that. He'd have to kill off followers to strike fear into the people who actually do care if they die. <br><br><br> /a/ is populated mostly by people under the age of 21 <br>Is that actually true?<br><br><br>That's speculation and unlikely. <br><br><br>A sacrifice in order to save more of other people's imouto's that would be lost to crimes.<br><br><br> Because he was executing people who weren't actually convicted yet. <br>Has nothing to do with it.<br><br><br>They didn't go after him so police can have jobs. The government thinks of police as an expenditure and would happily fire all them given the chance.<br><br><br> Normal people think things all the time, rape, murder, shit like that <br>No they don't. <br> they have the brain to stop themselves <br>They are afraid of the repercussions. <br><br><br>It's been awhile, but I thought he essentially said 'he didn't know of one', not that he was certain here wasn't one. Regardless, he was capable of lying/being wrong.<br><br><br>He didn't kill people based off the decisions made by the police/justice systems/prison systems. He just used those to find people, who would would then decide if they were deserving or not. He simply did not have the power nor time to go out and find people himself and actually make a worldwide change.<br><br><br>Irrelevant. There is no sign of god anywhere in our universe, yet people still cling to that quote.

Basically Kira is criminal for doing government job and should be killed.</br>  <br><br>I think someone triggered an unironic DN emo.</br></br>  There's nothing wrong with absolute power or innocent people dying to protect that power if the person with the power is fair and sane. History has plenty of examples of it going swimmingly. Light was fucking insane though so why wouldn't they stop him?    <br>  Light was fucking insane <br>No. He isn't. What is even his disorder? Can you name one?</br></br>  <br>not that guy and never even watched it but he seems a dead ringer for delusions of grandeur</br>  <br>He's an asshole and sells out people who were helping him</br>  <br>Kek<br>This dude has been waiting for this shit for a long time</br></br>  <br>he's a narcissist and a sociopath, at the very least.</br>  <br>Are you kidding me? <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_<wbr>triad<br>Tell me that doesn't sound like light</br></wbr></br></br>  <br> i'm not living in consistent fear that one day for some reason my heart will stop because... <br><br>What difference does it make why you die? Your chance of dying is much less when the crime rate is so low, even with the extremely off fluke that the one dude with a notebook kills you by mistake. Either way, you are much more likely to die in a car accident, or your heart stopping due to cheeseburgers. You should be in more constant fear of death right now than if you lived in that universe.<br><br><br>Then people wouldn't be able to pin everything on him. I would have made it something incredibly rare. I wouldn't want a normal heart attack on an important person getting pinned on me when I wasn't responsible. <br><br><br>Because this way he can keep specific killing secret if he wanted to. This is why you would make a shitty Kira. No brain.<br><br><br> right for you, but not for other people <br>In this case, the other people is 99.9% criminals. If the world is right for 99.9% of innocent good people, and wrong for 99.9% of criminals, instead of a 50/50, I'm okay with that. <br> Who the fuck gave you the right to impose your morals over others? <br>Ryuk.<br><br><br>What gives you the right to not kill people then? 'rights' is silly terminology for 'capability, with arbitrary morals tacked on.<br><br><br>If the single person is better than the conglomerate, then it is better for them to have all the power, but with advisers. Spreading the power leaves less risk, at the cost of less chance of improvement. For example, we now have the capability of self-driving cars. If one person was in control, they could mandate all other cars to cease production, and require all cars to be self-driving. This would significantly decrease the amount of automobile accidents, and save countless lives. This won't be done though, because the power is spread. It's going to take a long time before everyone is agreement, and lives are being thrown down the drain because of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because once you eliminate all "real" criminals you start killing people who do small misdeeds.<br><br>Look at the Russian and French revolutions and how they treated "criminals".</br></br>  <br> What difference does it make why you die? <br><br>It's Light behind the book, hes so mentally unstable in creating his own utopia it wouldn't shock me if he went full /pol/ and killed everything he found unfit to live in his new world.</br></br></br>  <br> because he acted above the law <br>Solid 3rd grade logic.<br> side effect of curbing crime, but they were ultimately not the end goal <br>Nope, it was the end goal.<br> his delusions of grandeur gave <br>They weren't delusions, he had grandeur.<br> god complex <br>And rightfully so.<br> defacing the law <br>Again with the law. Light doesn't give a shit about the law. He cares about good and evil. Which is how anyone with a functioning brain should think.<br> little kingdom <br>You are being condescending to a fictional character.<br> he's a hypocrite, no better than the criminals he killed <br>Nope, but you sure are a moron.<br><br><br>I don't think there's any official answer on this.<br><br><br>Point?<br><br><br>Sure could. But he didn't have to kill 70% of criminals in order to make the crime rate go down by 70%. He didn't even kill 1% of criminals, much less of the population, from my understanding. <br><br><br> just to keep killing and still 'exist' in people's mind <br>Nah, there were still 30% of crimes left. He made a large improvement, but he didn't reach anywhere near the end goal.<br><br><br>Hitler did much more than that.<br><br><br> and expect him not to decline into a slippery slope <br>Nonsense. They weren't afraid of him taking it too far, they already thought he did. And even if they didn't, and were 100% certain that he wasn't going to, they still would stop him. They don't want anyone to have more power than themselves.<br><br><br>Actually, it pretty much does. If they can't explain how the death note kills, they wouldn't be able to convict on it. Just like, if I popped a balloon, and someone had a heart attack, I wouldn't be convicted of murder. <br><br><br>This.<br><br><br>Sure is. If it smashed their skull that's considered a blunt weapon.<br><br><br>Yes he did. Opposing kira is preventing the world from being a better place. He wouldn't kill people for not liking kira, but directly opposing him to prevent him from making a better world is an act of evil inHisMind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>what the fuck is wrong with you? go away</br></br>  <br>He gassed six trillion jews.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> THE ABSOLUTE STATE OF THIS GUY  <br><br>90% of the people you're replying to are more than likely doing something better with their time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's been almost 9 years since I last saw Death note. Time to watch it again I guess.This makes me realize it'd take nearly a decade before I would consider rewatching some things.   this thread   <br>There's a drama airing right now, the second episode is gonna be subbed soon. It's kind of hilarious</br>  <br> every single guy in this thread could fool the whole world if he had the death note <br><br>Clearly not everyone in this thread, but many of us. Anyway, we simply wouldn't have someone like L to try to stop us, nor would we have the belief that we can eliminate all acts of crime. I'm sure most wouldn't use it, some would use it for personal gain, a few would use it to take out a select few priority high risk people, and the select .01% of us would do some Light level crazy shit with no exception of actually achieving our goal (but instead, with more of a Ryuk mindset of 'this could be interesting'). <br><br><br>This.<br><br><br> but eventually you goof up <br>Maybe, maybe not.<br><br><br> his improvements were only temporary <br>That's the thing though. At the point he got to, sure they were temporary. But if a large enough change to society was made (crime down to .001%) it would likely have a significant lasting impact, even once Kira killings stopped. <br><br><br> The power of final judgement really shouldn't reside in a demonstrably unstable college kid <br>I'd argue, his hands were the best for it. Most people who could do a better job than him, wouldn't attempt to.<br><br><br>Pages replenish at an equal rate of their destruction.<br><br><br>Except it is. People don't' want to live in that world, nor do they want to live in a world with criminals, nor do they want to live in a world were they can die in general. They want everything to be perfect. It can't happen. Not only that, people want things they would regret. They aren't smart, their opinions are irrelevant. What matters is whether the world is better for them or not, not whether they 'think' it 'would' be better for them or not.<br><br><br>I'm not emo. I just like showing people why they are stupid. It's a hobby of mine. <br><br><br> Light was fucking insane though so why wouldn't they stop him <br>They (rightfully) believed him to be incredibly calculated and intelligent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a drama <br><br>oh yeah. I don't need to suspend my disbelief past breaking point so I'll pass. I tend to suffer from secondhand embarrassment.</br></br></br>  <br>exactly</br>  <br> Pages replenish at an equal rate of their destruction <br>Prove it. Never once did we see the Death Note replenish its pages. What would that even look like?</br></br>  <br> delusions of grandeur <br>It wasn't delusions. He actually had grandeur.<br><br><br> narcissist <br>Narcissist is when people believe themselves to be higher than others 'without reason'. If the president of the United States thinks of himself as an important person, he isn't narcissistic. Same goes for Light.<br> sociopath <br>Arguably by the end of the show. Throughout the rest of it, not at all.<br><br><br>It doesn't sound at all like light.<br><br><br>Speculation. You can't just assume that's what he's going to do and punish him on that.<br><br><br>It's not impossible, but it's also not something that would be worth worrying about. Just like (I suspect) you don't worry about a massive sun flare/asteroid/etc demolishing all life on this planet. You have an irrational fear of something being decided by human hands, even with equal likelihood.<br><br><br><br>Hi. I'm right though, right?<br><br><br>It's funny (and expected) how people side with different characters when they watch the show when they are younger verse when they are adults.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched the first episode live, Misa-misa is a fucking hag.</br>  <br>Light's not even a genius at the start. The description of it I see on nyaa says that he grows into it apparently</br>  <br>I don't know, it seems like a likely explanation though. It's just a detail that's not worth getting caught up on.</br>  <br>Japanese interment camps? Killing the injuns, slavery?</br>  <br>Who the fuck are you? This isn't some shitty forum board, well it is, BUT who are you to spat the fucking rules?</br>  <br>How is interning the Japanese comparable to gassing millions of Jews?</br>  <br>Where is your proof of that?</br>  Who is pissed that L died?  <br> how people side with different characters when they watch the show when they are younger <br><br>I leaned more toward Light's view when I was younger, pretty sure I would categorically side with L's side now.</br></br></br>  <br>Of what?</br>  <br>L was really interesting as a stand alone character. I wonder if he would have been put to better use in another series. Do you think the mangaka shot himself in the foot by killing him off, never to be able to appear in a spin-off past the point of his appearance in DN?</br>  <br>I am so sorry that your reading comprehension is shit.</br>  <br>He should of faked his death then reviled himself at the end to light. L's replacement was shit.</br>  <br>There's always prequels.<br><br>Like BB.</br></br></br>  I'm sure North Korea has a low crime rate too.  Protip: If you agree with Light then you're a fascist.   Light had grandeur <br>That's funny considering he's the Japanese equivalent of the middle class privileged white male who never once had to struggle to get something he wanted.<br><br>Light's absolute disrespect for a system that while flawed, still presents a framework for objectively evaluating criminal action, brings to mind Nathan Jessup of A Few Good Men. Jessup argues that what he did, ordering his Marines to take action that ultimately lead to the death of another Marine, is for a greater good, one that a bunch of Navy law jockeys managing the case couldn't possibly comprehend. It doesn't change the fact it goes against the law, the rules by which society, whether it be civilian or uniformed or whatever, is expected to conduct itself according to.<br><br>More than that, Light's holding a figurative gun at the head of the world effectively holds their freedom hostage for the sake of peace or whatever Light wants to sell his "charity" as. To be willing to sacrifice one's agency to a system that seeks to eliminate "criminals," a label nebulous enough by the endgame to extend to dissidents and undesirables you'd see violently purged from a Stalinist sort of community, this goes against any utilitarian argument whatsoever. Any rational agent who seeks to enhance their own well being would object to a godlike overseer who dispenses draconian justice, as it would infringe upon their range of action based upon what said overseer may or may not condone on a given day. Endorsing Light is pure irrational behavior.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> faking his death <br><br>hmm yes I don't see why not. Faking a death is always okay as long as the writing can support it or eventually redeems it.<br><br><br>although there's nothing preventing prequels from being excellent, they are just depressing when you know the tragic fate of your protag. I feel in this case it would have been better to release a prequel mid-series while everything's still up in the air.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>liberals</br>  <br>I don't agree with Light, I just think he should have used his power to kill left-wing politicians instead, especially Jewish ones.</br>  <br>I'd destroy big corporations from the ground up. Let's see how fast Mr. hotshot CEO crumbles when everyone related to him starts dying.</br>  <br>Because he was killing people without due processes. I mean I know it can be a pain, but there are legitimate reasons why due processes and laws protecting the accused exists (like to keep innocent people from being lynched on vague suspicion or keeping someone from being killed for a minor crime like shoplifting). Plus I think I'd be rather hesitant to trust a a random anonymous person to pass down god-like judgements too.<br><br>Not to mention it barely took him a any time at all to go all evil dictator on them and started killing people just for disagreeing with him or people he saw as "lazy."<br><br>By the end Light was headed toward Spanish inquisition or French revolution levels of crazy.</br></br></br></br></br>   mfw they disagreed with him either because they thought it was their duty to stop him, without even pondering whether or not he might be right <br> mfw if they hadn't tried to stop him, none of the bad stuff happening to good people would have happened <br> mfw Light actually could have temporarily destroyed much of the cancer of society allowing us to rebuild <br> mfw they could have created a truly just world, not hampered by overpopulation, and then returned rikyu's book until it became needed again </br></br></br>  <br>*disagreed with him because they thought it was their duty to stop him</br>  <br><br>I love this gif.</br></br>  Raito was righto   be billionaire who controls the media  <br> spread false lies about business rivals  <br> business rivals suddenly die </br></br>  <br> Because someone else did it, it means that guy is less shit. </br>  <br>Morally he's just wrong.<br>You can only argue that the future he creates is worth it.<br>However, the fact is that he's just a kid with a magic notebook. <br>No one in the story overlooks this fact except raito.</br></br></br></br>  Imagine how shit Death Note would be if it were made today<br><br>Ryuk would be a tsundere 12 year old girl who's really 5000 years old, Misa would be the main focus of every episode, Matsuda would be a girl with huge tits and the joke would be her constantly bouncing into things and being a klutz.</br></br>  <br> tfw no qt moe matsuda with massive oppai </br>  <br>Because it's a bad idea to give one guy kill whoever the fuck he wants</br>  <br> &gt;Light had grandeur <br> That's funny considering he's the Japanese equivalent of the middle class privileged white male who never once had to struggle to get something he wanted. <br>Those two things are unrelated. You don't know what 'grandeur' means, do you?<br><br> A Few Good Men <br>Haven't seen it, don't know the context.<br><br> Light's holding a figurative gun at the head of the world effectively holds their freedom hostage for the sake of peace <br>Which is different from the literal gun criminals and/or police hold to people's heads how?<br><br> To be willing to sacrifice one's agency to a system that seeks to eliminate "criminals," a label nebulous enough by the endgame to extend to dissidents and undesirables you'd see violently purged from a Stalinist sort of community, this goes against any utilitarian argument whatsoever. <br>All those words and you couldn't form a sentence. <br><br> Any rational agent who seeks to enhance their own well being would object to a godlike overseer who dispenses draconian justice <br>Blah, utter nonsense. It's difficult to respond to such stupidity. A rational person does not need the capability to rip someone's eyes out then fuck the socket, and they do not want anyone to do said action to themselves. Therefor, said rational person would be fine with draconian punishments for said crime. <br><br><br> or people he saw as 'lazy' <br>This keeps getting brought up, but never actually happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*one guy the power to kill whoever the fuck he wants</br>  <br> This keeps getting brought up, but never actually happened. <br><br>Probably because he fucking died before he could do it, there was still some criminal scum around before he kicked the bucket</br></br></br>  <br> mfw they disagreed with him either because they thought it was their duty to stop him, without even pondering whether or not he might be right <br>The one cop questions this. The others, even after the question being brought up, still didn't give it a second though. Their determination, convinced him that he shouldn't be questioning it. Sadly, I think that is a realistic description of what would happen. L thought more deeply about it though.<br><br> mfw if they hadn't tried to stop him, none of the bad stuff happening to good people would have happened <br>True, but that's not reasoning enough to say they shouldn't have been trying to stop him.<br><br><br>Unfounded. <br><br><br>Given to a person at random, certainly. But in this case, the results show a net gain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Probably because he fucking died before he could do it <br><br>And Gandhi died before he could commit mass murder. Logic.</br></br></br>  <br>  rational person would be fine with draconian punishments <br>Cruelty of punishment isn't real problem. Rational person would see literally zero reasons to trust Kira. He is basically unchecked by all means whatsoever. Faggot can literally start nuclear war at any second if really feels like it. Crimes aren't really as dangerous as him if you consider this.</br></br>  <br> Gandhi had plans to murder all the NEETs  <br><br><br> Verrrry nice troll anon keep it up </br></br></br></br>  <br>You know Death Note is a Jump series right, it's not for the late night seinen crowd</br>  <br> having grandeur <br> unrelated to do with privileged middle class upbringing <br><br>3/10, if you're really serious about having this discussion you should go see A Few Good Men. One of the better Tom Cruise films out there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  results show a net gain <br>Pure fucking luck. Light literally gifted Death Note to most corrupt businessman in Japan. It isn't the one time deal either. Even if Yagami himself kind of okay you can't really believe in his successors. Such system is corrupted in the core.</br></br>  <br>To Kira it was just a game. He did it because he was bored. Once the crime rate was virtually 0% you don't think he would move on to normal people? just for kicks?</br>  <br>  crime rate was virtually 0% <br>But it is impossible because there will always be crazy enough criminals. Kira isn't even this good. Mello controlled entire mafia for example.</br></br>  because its heresy  <br> I just like showing people why they are stupid. It's a hobby of mine. <br>This is the average /a/ browser. Embarrassing.</br></br>  <br> Blah, utter nonsense. It's difficult to respond to such stupidity <br><br>It's like a real life Light is posting right now. I hate these arrogant fucks.</br></br></br>  <br> Rational person would see literally zero reasons to trust Kira <br>The reason to trust him is blatantly obvious. If he wanted to do harm, he could have done it instantly without any repercussions or chance of failure. <br><br>I have more reason to trust him, then I do to trust a police officer walking down the street from pulling his gun out and shooting me. Which is leagues above the amount of trust that I have when walking down a street in Chicago and getting held-up and shot by a criminal.<br><br><br>Exactly, both thoughts have absolutely no logic behind them.<br><br><br> A Few Good Men <br>What does some shitty Hollywood movie have to do with my years of psychology classes?

Of course, all Mediterranean countries are delinquent, but Greece is by far the worst. And of course I am a delinquent too — there's no doubt about that. But I am a genius delinquent, and, seen clearly, true genius requires delinquency as much as it requires any other quality, and is unthinkable without it. That's why the Anglo-Saxons are not geniuses, or the Scandinavians, or the Germans, or or or. Even French or, worse still, Italian delinquency get nowhere near the level of Byzantine cunning and depravity that prevails as a matter of course where I am from. — "And what about the Latin Americans or the African Blacks or the Arabs and so on? Aren't they delinquents too?" — Sure they are, but they are also stupid and uneducated and uncultured and uncivilized so mere delinquency does nothing for them — it merely amplifies their woes. You need EVERYTHING for a genius — all the required ingredients — not just one or two, which is why he's called a "genius", "he whose soul is more expansive and struck by the feelings of all others; interested by all that is in nature never to receive an idea unless it evokes a feeling; by everything excited and on which nothing is lost."

Hell. He is also above the law with all his I AM LE JUSTICE shit and no known identity.</br>  Why do some of you think that its OK for Light to impose his ideas on other people because he has the death note?

But in the end his judgement was, at best, about as reliable as that of the government/media.</br>  He's a murderous, egotistical, power hungry shiteater.  <br> It's hard to have legitimate discourse when everyone you are talking to is incredibly uniformed/unintelligent.  <br><br>How can someone be so insightful and yet so oblivious at the same time?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Light would never have been caught if he never went after L.<br><br>This is a fucking fact.</br></br></br></br>  If Light was so smart why did he make every single supervillain mistake in the book, even up to shouting "victory is mine!" like Stewie Griffin at the point when he could've just shut the fuck up and gotten away?  <br>Light is retarded. Thats for sure. No way you can trace Death Note as murder weapon if Kira just kills prisoners with heart attacks. He lost game that he shouldn't even lose 100% of time.</br>  Because at first he was just another serial killer and then as time went on, nobody cared anymore and realized he was helping, but our characters had a duty to finish what they started by catching him. That and he was gradually getting worse to the point where anything he personally disagreed with crime or not was grounds for death.  <br>And most detectives aren't the breed of batshit insane that L was.</br>  <br><br>muh plot<br>muh nemesis<br><br>If Light wasn't retarded he could have just used Misa to get Near's name and have him die in a car accident at some random time along with every other person who knew about the death note.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That is a interesting thought, If you keep on killing people who disagree with you. Publicly and privately, you would end up killing every one, it would be like a chain reaction.</br>  <br>Most anime detectives are.</br>  <br>  he could have just used Misa to get Near's name <br>How? Literally no photos.</br></br>  <br><br>The only plausible analysis L made was figuring out that Kira was in Japan.<br><br>Everything else was pure paranoia, he even said it himself at some point if i recall.</br></br></br></br>  <br> to just killing people he didn't like <br>He never did that. He killed people that would prevent him from continuing.<br><br><br>I'm 23 mate. I think studying multiple college courses on a topic has more meaning/demonstrates more understanding than seeing a hollywood film. If you want to disagree with that, be my guest.<br> those who took logic as part of a computer science background <br>Ding ding. That's me. <br> shut you down at the fallacy game <br>Spouting fallacy names is boring as shit. I'd rather ignore the fallacies and focus on their actual intent. Especially since 99% of the time it's the same three fallacies. <br><br><br>I agree and said nothing in the contrary. Kira is a threat to organizations, especially governments, working as intended, which is an entirely different topic. The discussion was about an average citizen trusting him or not though. <br><br><br>You are arguing that Light and the government had the same goal, except Light produced results. Your point backs up the opinion of those you are trying to refute.<br><br><br>The idea is that he already demonstrated that he was using the power in attempt to make the world a better place, and was succeeding. It would be an entirely different story from the get-go if he used the notebook to take out world leaders in order to garner control for himself.<br><br><br> killing anyone who disagreed with him <br>Again, he was killing people who tried to stop him. He didn't kill anyone for simply disagreeing.<br><br><br>It's not because he has the notebook, but because he produced results.<br><br><br>He didn't kill 70% of the population. He didn't even kill 70% of criminals. He killed a small sliver of criminals, many of which were undeniably evil, along with a select few innocent people trying to stop him.<br><br><br> people are too scared to commit crimes <br>That on it's own doesn't sound like a problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kill all the known leaders of Mexican/Colombian drug cartels and all their lieutenants <br> get a huge power struggle </br></br>  <br>"grows into" a genius or the actor into the role?</br>  <br><br>It's been forever since i watched the show. I'm sure i remember Misa seeing Near at least once.</br></br>  why are you white bois so arrogant? do any of you realize that the eugenicist mindset means no more anime or neet behavior? all of you strutting around like some proud nazi would get killed because you arent as smart as you think you are. you call some muslim a shitskin but that muslim is less likely to get killed than you   go to internet cafe wearing makeup or a mask <br> use 7 proxies and look up list of convicted criminals world wide and their pictures on google images <br> kill 1,000 criminals per day for the rest of your life <br> everybody praises Kira's judgment as God's judgment <br> L remains a butthurt, friendless virgin who can never pinpoint Light <br> the police celebrate because their jobs are now cushy and easy <br> we enter a golden age of humanity <br>Light was retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That on it's own doesn't sound like a problem. <br>Yeah. It's a problem when one person arbitrarily sets the rules, with the verdict always being death.</br></br>  <br> Alright, it actual means 'of great importance'. It doesn't have to be of 'high rank or social' importance, just importance in general. <br> Regardless, it in no way relates to being 'privileged middle class upbringing". <br><br>this is silly, now you're just arguing over semantics. You know words are put into context right?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Only evil people would fear Kira's wrath.<br><br>The police forces arguments were that of a slippery slope fallacy, just because Light killed criminals doesn't mean he would execute people for things like expressing freedom of speech.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Plot of the series: <br>Light Yagami (Masataka Kubota) is an ordinary university student. One fateful day he receives a death note which changes his life. The death note slowly begins to awaken his warped sense of justice and genius. He becomes a murderer called Kira and punishes criminals.<br> L (Kento Yamazaki) is a well known private detective. L appears in front of Light Yagami. L defines Kira as evil and decides to catch Kira. &gt;Then N (Mio Yuki), who has a beautiful appearance but dangerous existence, appears. </br></br></br>   not getting a bunker <br> not killing every single significant politician in the world outside of your country just for fun and watching the world go to hell </br>  <br>But his results were much greater.<br><br><br> How can someone be so insightful and yet so oblivious at the same time? <br>By taking what you said as a compliment and ignoring the other part. <br><br><br>He actually didn't make many mistakes. And the mistakes he made weren't very cliche one's. <br><br><br> if Kira just kills prisoners with heart attacks <br>That's irrelevant, he wouldn't be able to achieve the results he wanted.<br><br><br>He wasn't killing people that disagreed though, he was only killing people that tried to stop him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only evil people <br>define evil people as Light would</br></br>  <br>Light killed people for trying to stop him.</br>  If I were to break into a prison and shoot up a bunch of inmates, what would happen?  Edgy smartass teen power fantasy.  <br><br>Those who seek to physically harm society.<br><br>i.e. murderers, rapists, thieves, extortionists, scam artists, sadists, cannibals<br><br>Kira never once murdered someone for speaking out against him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Light was retarded. <br>Of course he is. Misa outplayed him in his game. You can't be worse than that.</br></br>  <br>Where did he get so many criminal names? By TV? By radio or newspapers? In what kind of world do the press manage this information? What about people who commit crimes and nobody knows their names? How do you kill them?<br>I think thats the biggest inconsistence in this anime.</br></br>  <br> begins to awaken his [...] genius <br><br>oh come the fuck on japan. Why did they have to qualify N as "beautiful". Maybe I'll give ep 1 a go heh.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Easily justified.<br><br>It was an obstruction of justice. Real police use it all the time to kill dogs and black people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If they are gangsters and it won't impress the rival gangs enough to respect you and give you protection, you will probably get ass-raped.</br>  <br>Remember his dad?</br>  <br><br>Stole it from a police database that his father had access to via his home computer.</br></br>  Because he had to kill an innocent man (L) to keep his plan going. <br><br>That alone makes him flawed.</br></br>  <br>because the end doesn't justify the means<br><br>you know what, let's do genocide on the entire human race, that will cut down crime by 100%! Sounds like a good deal, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Kira physically harmed society by killing individuals who wished to protect it just because they opposed him.</br>  <br> Real police use it all the time to kill dogs and black people. <br>Poor dogs.</br></br>  hey remember how cool you thought Death Note was when it cam on the scene?  <br>It does, though.<br>I wish nuclear holocaust happened.</br></br>  <br>Light's vigilantism and killing off cops and detectives is an obstruction of justice.</br>  <br>N is cute</br>  <br><br>Technically Kira never killed L. Rem did.</br></br>   start killing government leaders <br> make them write suicide notes before they die giving instructions and demands <br> tell the government to kill the criminals themselves <br> if that doesn't convince them, write in the circumstances for their death being that every government secret was leaked to the public <br> if that still doesn't convince them, write in a world leader launching a nuke into the pacific before they died <br><br>What a waste of time killing them himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kira was the intellectual author</br>  If Light hates criminals, why didn't he kill himself?  <br>  he wouldn't be able to achieve the results he wanted <br>What is even a point to kill government dudes? It made them to hate him much more. Also he lost his perfectly divine image because everyone was understand that he can't kill real L.</br></br>  Is Death Note Dexter of /a/?<br> series about an edgy vigilante faggot that started out promising but drowned in shit writing </br>  <br>why would I get ass raped? I killed criminals, I did a service to society.</br>  <br><br>He who controls the paper controls the contract. He who controls the contract controls the deal.<br>Those who control the deal control the law.<br><br>Therefore, Light is the law by virtue of being more powerful than the police. This is how it has worked for thousands of years. The strong lead the weak.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because he was not a god anon. <br>A human that crazy with that kind of power that governs trough fear is not better than a dictator. <br><br>He was a dumb fuck that did not understand how the world works.</br></br></br></br></br>  It wasn't what he was doing that was wrong, it was the fact that he could kill anyone effortlessly  <br> get framed for a murder <br> get sent to jail <br> light kills me because i'm a criminal <br><br>a-at least the crime rates went down</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dexter is the Death Note of /tv/.</br>  <br>He was just a murderer.</br>  <br>In what part of anime Light "hacked" police database? How do you think Light could hack or steal that information from THE POLICE?</br>  <br>Because most people think that killing people who choose to steal, rape and murder to their hearts content, taking humanity farther and farther from where we could be, is the same as killing an innocent. I am not one of those people. Light was also being an asshole about the whole thing though.</br>  <br> might is right! <br>And in the end Light lost, meaning he wasn't more powerful. Light was shit.</br></br>  <br>  He actually didn't make many mistakes. <br>He falls from position where nobody can trace him to such corner that he was forced to rely on Misa, random evil dude and fucking shinigami to be free. How you can ever screw so hard?</br></br>  <br>Said the fat, loser virgin.</br>  <br><br>He guessed the password to his father's account.<br><br>You know how your parents make stupid one word passwords that are easily guessed? Like they use the first name of their mom or son or whatever? That's what happened. Light's father is an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  How do you kill them? <br>He can't. Thats why mafia dudes say that there is such deep criminals that even Kira can't deal with them.</br></br>  I guess killing people people (even innocence) is wrong....HOWEVER when said killing brings down crime rates by 70%, installs fear into people of committing crimes, along with people praises you as a god (cause people really did praise and think of Kira as a god) He's doing the right thing.<br><br>It may not be right in the eyes of anyone who believes in society. But then again, Good and Evil were both always decided by the side with the stronger forces and Light holding the death note gave him that authority.<br><br>Don't do the crime, if you don't want to die. Stay on Light's good side. Peace built off lies and deaths is the same society we as a people live in now. His is no different so please shut the fuck up.</br></br></br></br>  <br> i laughed genuinely for the first time in 5 days </br>  <br>  L <br>  innocent <br>Dude is shady as fuck</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure he lost due to his tragic flaw. He had too much pride and needed to assert his dominance over every major figure he killed. Presumably because he had a little dick.<br><br>His pride was the keystone for his downfall. Any rational person wouldn't get caught if they had a death note. But then again no rational person would go around killing people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck would people blindly follow the orders of a dead leader. Did you honestly type that plan out thinking it made sense and you were some genius and the solution was so onvious</br>  <br>stop</br>  <br><br>Statistics would say that you'd be a noble sacrifice for the greater good.</br></br>  <br>  light  <br>  more powerful than the police <br>It isn't like he can investigate all of crimes by himself. Dude is basically rely on police work and media coverage to do his job.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fear is a strong motivator. I bet if i hooked your balls up to a car battery you'd spill every dirty little secret you had.</br></br>  <br>Greater good for who though? The only people left are the people who haven't committed a crime yet, prison's "purpose" is rehabilitation, not punishment.</br>  <br> I bet if i hooked your balls up to a car battery you'd spill every dirty little secret you had. <br><br>haha. the imagery alone.</br></br></br>  <br> go to internet cafe wearing makeup or a mask <br>Draw suspension to yourself without reason, great start.<br> everybody praises Kira's judgement as God's judgment <br>Thousands of conspiracy theories go around about governments murdering prisoners. Revolts, chaos, anarchy, etc. Congratulations, you just murdered a bunch of people and in the process caused the world to be a worse place. <br><br>You have to play with the public and make your presence/existence publicly known as a single person's/being's will.<br><br><br>You are focusing too much on the power of one individual, rather than the net gain being positive or negative. Why is it worse for criminals to be dying at the hands of a single person, than innocent people dying at the hands of criminals?<br><br><br>Yes they are. I wasn't arguing semantics. I'm arguing that in no way does 'grandeur' have anything to do with 'privileged middle class upbringing'. I've said this multiple times, and absolutely no attempt and drawing a connection between the two has been made, despite his entire argument resting on that connection. <br><br><br> ordinary university student <br>He wasn't ordinary. He was described as being incredibly intelligent. <br><br><br>You'd get arrested. Chances are, you wouldn't be able to do that without killing cops/guards/innocents anyway, so you would be fucked.<br><br><br> In what kind of world do the press manage this information?  <br>This is all easily accessible. Not to mention that he had access to police databases. <br> What about people who commit crimes and nobody knows their names? How do you kill them? <br>Without the shinigami eyes, you don't. His goal wasn't to kill every last criminal, but create a world free of crime.<br><br><br>That logic doesn't make sense. <br><br><br> because the end doesn't justify the means <br>Why does it not?<br> genocide <br>He didn't kill 70% of criminals to cut crime by 70%. He killed a small sliver of criminals, and achieved a 70% drop in crime by doing so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The only people left are the people who haven't committed a crime yet <br>Uh, yeah.</br></br>  <br>Why would the leader of my country killing themselves make ME be afraid</br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded? The suicide letters would just be a way of contacting them. They would know that Kira sent them, not the fucking leader. <br><br>Example:<br> I am Kira. <br> Kill all the criminals you currently have in jail or I will release all your government's secrets and launch nuclear weapons. <br><br>That's what one of the letters would contain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you do this I would agree that Hitler is my dad and Moot is my brother. Torture is shit method of obtaining information.</br>  <br><br>I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're not American. Because over here prison is a punishment that habilitates you into coming back over and over again since no one hires an ex-con over here for any job that's worthwhile.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's why I put purpose in quotes, it's a shame what's happened to prisons in America.</br>  <br>Why should I get arrested?<br>I did a service to the community. If anything I should be praised for it.</br></br>  <br>  Thousands of conspiracy theories go around about governments murdering prisoners. <br>But suddenly totally bullshit excuse of some Kira guy make everything perfectly believable and not really a conspiracy?</br></br>  <br><br>You think your torturers would just let you go after you just start talking? They'd go to confirm if the information was real and likely begin ripping out a tooth every time you told them a lie.</br></br>  <br> I wasn't arguing semantics <br><br>no you are arguing OVER semantics not "arguing semantics". A sense of grandeur (in context, a sense of social importance via dictionary terms) can inhabit a person through ''privileged middle class upbringing'.</br></br></br>  <br> Light kills rapists and murderers <br> Hitler wanted to kill jews and homosexuals <br><br>literally the same</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rapists and murderers can be rehabilitated, Jews and homosexuals can't.</br>  <br>And what proof does he have that he knows ALL the secrets. Why would they believe his bluff</br>  Why didn't he write his own name in the deathnote with the description of dying at 100 or something, comfortably in his sleep having never been caught?  <br> jews and homosexuals can't <br><br>because neither defines wrongdoing.</br></br></br>  <br>  They'd go to confirm if the information was real <br>You can't really confirm "dark secrets". Shit is too broad by definition. Even if you give up one secret you can just hide more darker.</br></br>  <br>thanks for only being familiar with the series through shitposts on /a/</br>  <br>Depends on who you are, Light was killing people based on his fucked up ideals, so was Hitler.</br>  <br>A rule says that they die after 20 days max</br>  <br>Something about everyone having their own time to die. Besides the death note can't just make anything happen, it only causes people under its influence to follow things to the best of their ability, not to the exact letter.</br>    <br> That logic doesn't make sense. <br>You can't be this dense.</br></br>  <br>well, yeah in a way</br>  <br>LVII: In the Death Note, you cannot set the death date longer than the victim's original life span. Even if the victim's death is set in the Death Note beyond his/her original life span, the victim will die before the set time.</br>  <br>Do you need me to spell it out for you or are you just pretending to be retarded?<br><br> [Name of leader] <br> Suicide <br> Before committing suicide at noon today, this person released all his government's secrets online and then took his own life. <br>or<br> Before committing suicide at noon today, this person commanded his army to launch a nuke into the pacific ocean. <br><br>You seem to forget that the Death Note is also a geass. You can control anyone leading up to their death and the details surrounding them. The world's leaders will be scared shitless and listen to your demands so more bullshit like that doesn't happen. The only thing you can't do is cause multiple deaths with the details.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you think the majority of world leaders have the authority to randomly launch a nuke and NOBODY else in the government needs to be involved or might question why they're trying to do this?<br><br>I don't know what dictatorship you live in but most governments don't work like that</br></br></br>  <br>But Light's father is the POLICE CHIEF!!! Who the hell could give Light's father that appointment if he can't keep his password? That's so stupid</br>  Did he die a virgin, /a/? ;_;  <br><br>nuclear ordinance, even at the presidential and equivalent level, is a multi-man setup where 2 or more individuals of sane and like mind are required to enact nuclear armageddon.<br><br>It's the oldest safety in the book. Otherwise you get shit like the kraut who crashed an airplane because no one was in the cabin to keep an eye on him. Two man rule.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then I can just force everyone to agree using the Death Note.</br>  <br>Because the government is afraid of anyone with more power than themselves.</br>  <br>Not even a question.</br>  8888  <br> harmed society by killing individuals who wished to protect it <br>Logic doesn't follow. Someone can wish to protect something, but be the cause of it's demise. Or in this case, they wish to protect it, and in the process, prevent it from achieving a better state. Think civil wars.<br><br><br>As they are an obstruction to his justice. Moot point.<br><br><br>That simply wouldn't work. Too many variables, no endgame, no reason for them to listen. Would cause anarchy. <br><br><br>Hah.<br><br><br> What is even a point to kill government dudes? <br>Are you referring to a specific point in the show? I don't know, I'd have to re-watch it.<br><br><br>Dexter was an awful show. It did not have a promising start. It had a decent premise, with some good details in the killings, but shit writing/characters/plot-lines/etc/e<wbr>tc. The ending was pure horrid. <br><br><br> is not better than a dictator <br>What is wrong with a dictator who produces positive results? What is with the obsession of having split-power with worse results? The results should be the important part (and I don't mean by 'bad' means. I mean the overall net gain/lose).<br><br><br> get framed for a murder <br> get sent to jail <br>Sure, it can happen, but you're kinda fucked either way. More innocents will be saved in the long run. And as it stands, you are much more likely to get murdered then to get framed for murder. <br><br><br>His dad. Watch the show.<br><br><br>He didn't make many mistakes though. L both got incredibly lucky, and punished every tiny mistake Light made incredibly hard.<br><br><br> Good and Evil were both always decided by the side with the stronger forces <br>Mhm.<br><br><br> rational <br>You seem to be defining rational in an irrational way.<br><br><br>Sure, but if you told me some dude killed himself, and in his suicide note he told me to hop on my left foot three times, I wouldn't even do that. Much less try to convince the entire government to slaughter every prisoner.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're implying a sociopath is<br> 1. crazy <br> 2. inherently bad <br><br>Both of which are absolutely incorrect assumptions. Being a sociopath simply means you lack empathy which also means you possibly lack unnecessary emotions that might stop you from getting the job done EFFICIENTLY.</br></br></br></br></br>   There is no afterlife in the Death Note universe <br>Technically Light had zero repercussions for using a DN.</br>  <br>Sociopaths are crazy by definition and lack of empathy isn't the lack of emotions.</br>  <br>Not in Japanese culture.</br>  <br>He even got qt girlfriend and good job. Totally worth it.</br>  <br> dying without ever knowing the warm touch of another human being <br>A cruel fate that many of us will probably suffer</br></br>  <br> It did not have a promising start. It had a decent premise <br>Sounds even more like Death Note.</br></br>  <br>Better question. Did Light died a virgin?</br>  <br>Not to mention Light was told he wouldn't go to heaven or hell for eternity just by using a DN once, in the very long run he had nothing to lose so he figured he might as well make the best of it.</br>  <br>Come on, he probably fucked Misa out of obligation or to shut her up at least once.</br>  <br>hitler did nothing wrong</br>  <br><br>He got a good feel of Misa's ass.<br><br>He died happy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>pretty sure the japanese view limbo as bad as hell. To exist in nothingness for eternity.</br>  <br><br>Wait a minute, if Light became a shinigami after dying doesn't he ultimately win?<br><br>He could control the human world as a literal god via suicide notes and there'd be nothing anyone could do about it. Hell he probably got revenge on Near and Matsuda immediately once he got to the shinigami realm.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If it keeps happening, they will have someone in control without revealing his identity. Which wouldn't go over well with the public, whose already rioting and revolting due to every world leader committing suicide. <br><br><br>If you tell me you are serious I will explain why what you said is retarded.<br><br><br>Convincing the public is much different from convincing government leaders. Especially when you aren't' asking them to do anything. Sure, there would still be conspiracy theories, but not at all in the same way as if you had all world leaders commit suicide.<br><br><br> A sense of grandeur <br> delusion of grandeur <br>I'm not sure if that's what you meant. He actually had grandeur. It has absolutely nothing to do with his upbringing in anyway. He had a notebook that he could write someone's name in and it would kill them specifically how and when he wrote. <br><br><br>If you wrote "John Smith will die of a heartatche in 20 minutes", and someone shots him in 2 minutes, he'll still die from the gunshot.<br><br><br>The logic doesn't make sense. If you are told you have to kill one innocent person in the next 5 minutes, or 500 will die, killing one innocent person would not make you 'flawed'. Regardless, being 'flawed' is absurdly irrelevant. You don't need to be perfect to have a positive impact. Take your stupid elsewhere.<br><br><br>The plan wouldn't work. I've said why multiple times. Stop arguing with the person who doesn't understand the concept, and look at why I've said it's flawed.<br><br><br>Police database aren't top secret. It's incredibly easy to get in one, but the risk is greater than the non-existent reward.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just collect all the Dragon Balls and wish for every criminal to be dead?</br>  <br>Sounds shitty to me. But just floating in a void is still better than being actively tortured.<br><br>And hey maybe you can even talk to other people if they're there too. That wouldn't be so bad</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, no one would look over your shoulder and wonder why you browse criminals and write their names all day long.</br>  <br>You can't control humanity with suicide notes but yes. It would be his victory.</br>  <br>He got reincarnated actually.</br>  <br>Just say that it was for school project.</br>  <br>It's japan nobody would ever say anything, they don't want to rock the boat</br>  <br>Actually the western culture views limbo as the deepest level of hell</br>  <br><br>Both of you are wrong, and your arguing a moot point anyway.<br> He's a sociopath. And crazy <br> herp derp your implying sociopath means crazy <br>No, he implied the exact opposite by going out of his way to state that he was a sociopath and also that he was crazy.<br><br><br> warm touch of another human being <br>It's truly overrated. And just save up for a good prostitute for one night if you are really that curious. <br><br><br>Nope.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So the moral of the story is that Light ended up creating a perfect crime free world simply by traveling to the human world and wiping out every single criminal he ever saw with heart attacks. He could just phase into police headquarters and become a voyeur, killing off criminals as police scrolled past it.<br><br>God the writers didn't think this story through at all. Everything prior pretty much amounts to humanity's meaningless struggle against divine power.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sense of grandeur (a sense of high social importance) as stated before. Aside his status in society, he viewed his position (which no doubt had to to have been informed to an important extent by his father's work) as socially important enough to permit his own actions. his mindset can't have existed in a vacuum, realistically speaking.</br>  <br><br> "This is Kira, i am speaking to you from beyond the grave. I have become a shinigami and at XX:XX o'clock tonight criminials XX and XXX will die of X. The man who committed suicide was a criminal guilty of X and as such i have passed righteous judgement on him." <br><br>Or hell if he really wanted to send a message he could just get someone to do a cheap voice recording like he did with sakura TV and have them send a message in Kira's name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so...?</br>  <br><br>Yes. As it's been stated in this thread multiple times. Death note is poorly written shit.</br></br>  Did the native extension get nerfed or something? All my filters are gone. What the fuck.  <br>  This is Kira, i am speaking to you from beyond the grave. I have become a shinigami.  <br>It could be another wannabe with magic book. It isn't like there can be only one Kira and one Death Note. So he can't proof to be shinigami.</br></br>  <br><br>On the contrary.<br><br>He can rip a small piece of the notebook and drop it into the human world. In a video created by a criminal he could get a devout follower to touch people with the paper so that they could see him. Naturally he would be binded to that human being, however if that human were to ever get caught he could write their name in his notebook so that he is unbinded from them and move onto another host.<br><br>This way he can spread proof of his existence as more and more people are able to see him and speak directly with him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aside from the sheer stupidity of the "holohoax" argument, what always irritates me about it is the sheer laziness and uncreativity of the efforts to disprove the holocaust.<br><br>There are really not enough good English language accounts of the Weimar era's excesses and how the social liberalism, combined with 30% unemployment, led to the rise of the Nazi party. And how this period was a high water mark of Jewish influence (in ways we are all familiar with today).<br><br>Of course Jews were not the sole initiators of this debauchery, which had far more complex causes having to do with war trauma, socioeconomic instability, and the sudden emergence of mass society--but they were easily associated with it due to their overrepresentation among its advocates (as will be familiar to modern day observers).<br><br>Another area closely related to the Holocaust is the entire Holocaust Industry, as famously detailed by Norman Finkelstein. When Holohoax kooks goof about the gas chambers and concentration camps, they undermine any effort to address the exploitation of the Holocaust to the tune of billions of dollars. (One can only imagine the next big achievement will be a Holocaust amusement park, if such a thing does not already exist, along with already extant Holocaust "museums" in every major city in America--we didn't even get to kill our Jews and we still have to put up with it).<br><br>So beyond its ludicrous denial of reality, none of the Holohoax kookery addresses or helps define the Holocaust and its context and transformation into a bizarre, morbid religion. The idea that it was all a giant propaganda scheme is a monumental self-delusion and waste of energy that could be better spent addressing the real problems of the Holocaust's aftermath, including a guilt complex and the cheap way that it is used as a cudgel to silence criticism of Jews. But a lot of alt rightists would rather shoot both feet off and then blame it on the kike illuminati.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The ends do not justify the means.<br><br>Also, the kid was getting a god complex, just like everyone on the planet over the age of 14 would suspect. <br><br>When he's done with the murderers, the felons, the delinquents, the malcontents, the defiant, the independent, the underperforming...<br><br>You don't just sit there and hope your little death god keeps a conscience.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the government needs crime/terrorists to scare the population into submission.</br>  <br>very simple. every time he killed someone he was comitting murder or manslaughter. also, people whove committed crimes have the right to a jury, a fair trial, and reasonable punishment. light ignored all of this, thus even the most "justified" of his kills were againt the law</br>   mfw immoral fags in this thread <br><br>Shit taste in philosophy.</br></br>  <br>above average joke. great point. i award you a gold star anon</br>  Lots of spooks in this thread.  <br>Also one of the worst, Japanese justice system is one of the harshest in the world, which contribute to it's low crime rate.</br>  If you got a deathnote, would you post about it on 4chan?  <br>I have one. Don't tell moot.</br>  <br>Pretty sure 4chan as a whole is still pretty big on whistleblowing, so nah it's not worth it.</br>  <br>I will keep it a secret and seal it for some time in the future when it is needed. So definitely no.</br>  <br>But you'd be behind seven proxies anon</br>  Did hinata deserve to win? <br><br>Rereading the series she became a little too obsessive about naruto. To the point where it was unhealthy as fuck. I feel she never grew up in that sense as winning negated the probability of her finding the strength to move on.</br></br>   deserve to win <br>Sounds like you're the one who hasn't grown up.</br>  better than sakura winning.  <br>Do I spy a butthurt narusaku among us"?</br>  <br><br>Idk m8 the movie portrayed sakura as a good person. I feel that if kishi just took her unusual sauce obsession out of the picture, a lot of people would prefer her over hinata.</br></br>  fuck off  <br>Sakura's and Naruto's obsession with Sasuke's trumped Hinata's supposed obsession with Naruto.</br>  <br>Even without her obsession with Sasuke, she's still a useless character with no reason to be there. Even without her obsession with Sasuke, people would still dislike her for being useless and not having the courtesy to be side character.</br>  <br>We'll fuck off when Fatefags stop getting away with having multiple threads daily.</br>  <br> Did hinata deserve to win? <br>Absolutely.</br></br>  Hinata is superior in every way.  fuck off narutards  <br>I've been seeing these weird fish crackers and chibi nurutu characters for a while now. Are they part of some advertisement?</br>  <br>Your father didn't deserve to win.</br>  <br> dat ZR and skirt combo on Himawari <br>Jesus Christ Salad step it the fuck up.</br></br>  <br> Did hinata deserve to win? <br>Dunno but Naruto deserve a family and someone who like him with flaws and all and Hinata is the perfect one for that. Sakura is too much of a thundercunt for that.</br></br>  <br> A girl created by Kishimoto <br> Growing and thinking of something else than the boy of her dreams <br><br>I really can't see that happen, every girl in this mango is pathetic as fuck and designed to be someone's breeding mare.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Dunno but Naruto deserve a family <br>not everyone agrees on that</br></br>  She basically barely did anything to deserve it but throw her life away once and give him a speech to put him back on track.<br><br>But then again no other girl actually did more than her so she wins by default nobody else showed up for the race.</br></br>  <br> and designed to be someone's breeding mare </br>   Did hinata deserve to win?  <br><br>Well who else would have then? It's not like there was any competition.</br></br>  Hinata's "obsession" with Naruto lead to her becoming a stronger person and a happier life, now with that same person. That's healthy.<br><br>She didn't need to "earn" his love, as it's not a matter of desert.</br></br>  If Sakura had ended up with Naruto, fans would've kicked up a way bigger fuss than they did with "KAAAAAAAARIN IS...NOT THE MOTHER!"<br><br>That being said, Hinata is best girl in Naruto and most certainly deserved to win the Hokagebowl.<br><br>  She never grew up <br>  Starts liking him as a kid because he protected her <br>  Grows to usual puppy love in the Academy <br>  Realises his personality is literally everything she wishes she was <br>  She grows as a person simply by watching him - the Neji v Hinata fight is the epitome of this in Part 1. <br> That fight still brings tears to my eyes. Hinata is seriously the most hardcore out of the Konoha Nine .<br>  Realises her feelings aren't just gonna disappear over the two years Naruto is gone <br>  Sacrifices herself for him with the "I love you speech", which gives us one of THE BEST Heroic Blue Screen of Death sequences I've ever seen with Naruto's Six Tail Version 2 beatdown. <br>  Gives him the strength needed to believe in himself amongst all the chaos in the Shinobi World War <br>  He realises holy shit this girl has always been the one supporting me from the back, not Sakura, during The Last <br><br>Hinata a best</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hinata is seriously the most hardcore out of the Konoha Nine <br>Well, she did rip a man's eyes out.</br></br>   you will never treat your edgy protege to ice cream after a hard day's training while completely ignoring your own flesh and blood daughter   <br>naruto lived his whole life unsure if anyone loevd him, someone said they did, she wins. men are that simple, and abused ones are simpler</br>  <br>You know at first (and keep in mind that was years ago) I wanted Sakura to win but over the years I realized I didn't even like Sakura and I wanted Hinata to win. And seeing Hinata get stronger made me very happy and wanted to see her happy at the end. But who fucking knew my wish was to be granted?</br>  <br>I think that fight with Pain alone makes her deserve the win.</br>   asking if Hinata deserved to win naruto and not did naruto deserve to win Hinata  <br> forgetting that 90% of the women obessed over men in this series  <br> forgetting if she didn't win then nobody won </br></br>    <br> Naruto still has his frog wallet <br><br>based</br></br></br>  The only girl that actually lost was Ino and 1010<br><br>Sakura was always after Sasuke's<br>Hinata was always after Naruto<br>Temari and Shikamaru were destined<br>Ino wanted Sasuke, and lost<br>1010 lost Neji</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying that tacky green faggot won't live as long as he will </br>  <br> Even without her obsession with Sasuke, she's still a useless character with no reason to be there <br>I don't think she would be considered any more useless than anyone else in that generation who isn't on demigod-level. Maybe healing is a boring trait, but it's still quite useful.<br><br>The problem is that she's always comparing herself to the only two big-league fighters in her generation, and as a result always sees herself as falling short. It's a very stupid thing to do and is so far from what her actual role is, but given how crazy she is over the lunatic, what else could one expect from someone of her intelligence.</br></br></br></br>  Deserve to win what? The saviour of the village? Sakura proved she doesn't care about prestige when picking a man. She went after the most hated individual in the town. Sakura doesn't give a shit if Sasuke is important or a criminal. Likewise, it doesn't matter to her about Naruto's status because she never liked him even after he became the most liked person in the village.  <br> Ino wanted Sasuke, and lost <br>Pyrrhic victory, anon. If she had won the Sauce it'd be worse than losing. <br><br>Plus their kid is prime grade A trap material.</br></br></br></br>  <br> trap <br>That's a girl though.<br><br>...right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pink and Sauce are the shittiest characters around. They deserve each other.</br>  <br> we'll never get SaladxInojin doujins <br>I find it funny that despite Ino being called the "slutty" one and the one who would be most likely to sleep around, he has the least amount of Doujins from the main cast of females next to Tenten.<br><br>All Doujins focused on Sakura, Hinata, Tsunade, Temari, and Shizune.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is whatever you want him to be.</br>  <br> That's a girl though <br>A girl  with a penis. </br></br>  <br>Popularity, anon. That's why most nurudu doujins nowadays are trash.</br>  <br> She's futa then. </br>  <br>A futa with balls, flat tits and no vagina, yes.</br>  <br>Actually no she didn't because she always thought sai was good looking and probably would of liked him if he grew up with her like the rest. The one who lost was Sakura</br>  Hinata's personality is unhealthily centered on just Naruto. It's not very good, but very few people (men or women) in the narutoverse could be legitimately considered to be mentally stable.<br><br>Maybe there could have been a better partner for Naruto, but none exceed Hinata by much.</br></br>  <br> Hinata's personality is unhealthily centered on just Naruto <br>Debatable. She's significantly more sane than the other girls we've seen and at least the man she's after hasn't tried to kill her.</br></br>  <br>Tenten never wanted Neji. The most romantic feelings she ever showed were: once saying that Sasuke was cute while blushing and another time said that Kakashi was better looking than Guy.</br>  <br> implying normal /a/ isn't shit already with all the Fates threads </br>  <br> very few people (men or women) in the narutoverse could be legitimately considered to be mentally stable <br>Well yeah. They are raised as ninjas at constant warfare.</br></br>  <br>Speaking of doujins...<br> https://archive.moe/a/thread/127927<wbr>814/#q127930170</wbr> </br></br>   people defending The Last movie <br><br>Lel.</br></br>  @128046441<br>No.</br>  <br> said that Kakashi was better looking than Guy <br>Can common sense be considered romantic?</br></br>  <br> @128046441 <br> @ </br></br>  <br> Hinata's personality is unhealthily centered on just Naruto. <br>Where is this ever shown? Naruto has also never given Hinata any reason to stop liking him, unlike some other characters we know.</br></br>  <br>Could be. By the ninja world's standards, yes, being obsessive is quite a minor thing compared to many we've seen. But from our 21st century perspective it's pretty clear it's unhealthy.</br>  <br> thundercunt <br><br>Wha</br></br></br>  <br>Cry a river. Is not against the rules to have an ocassional naruto thread from time to time.</br>  <br> But from our 21st century perspective it's pretty clear it's unhealthy <br>Meh, she's a little stalkerish. That's about it.</br></br>  <br> That frog wallet will be the thing that an inconsolable Hinata will put in her husband's coffin alongside him when he inevitably dies saving the world. <br><br><br>  Unhealthily centred <br>  Genuinely has feelings for him <br>  Legitimately wants to see him succeed <br>  Draws strength from him in times of need - see Neji v Hinata <br>  Brings him back to his senses when he's tiptoes away from giving up, because she loves him and knows how he ticks. <br><br>More healthy than going after a wanted criminal, even after said criminal attempts to murder you by putting a lightning hole in your chest. Twice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>from our 21st century perspective we don't have magic to literally go into people's minds and analyze your memories. Ninshu is far better psychiatry than anything we have.</br>  <br>Same, only I never liked Sakura and just accepted the possibility of her turning around and falling for the protag because she's the main female character and he had a crush on her. Glad it didn't happen.</br>  <br>  implying there's anything wrong with it <br><br>The events of The Last are canonical, Anon, and no matter how much you don't want to believe it, it's true.</br></br></br>  <br> SSfag detected </br>  <br>There is not a whole lot to define Hinata's character after you take her Naruto obsession out of the picture. Some, but not enough. Blame Kishimoto. Her main character trait was "Stalker of MC".</br>  <br> But from our 21st century perspective it's pretty clear it's unhealthy <br> hey this guy makes me feel good <br> tell him i love him <br> oh no hes retarded <br> oh well i love him anyway <br> it took a dozen years to get it through his thick skull but now we're married  <br>Unorthodox, but not unhealthy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with narushit.</br>  <br>Rockin' tits say yes</br>    <br> stalkerish <br><br> Stalker of MC <br>But that's from fillers. in the manga we only see her watching naruto from a distance one time, maybe two.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Her main character trait was "Stalker of MC" <br>Did you miss her entire flashback? Her main theme was being born to the head branch to an eminent Leaf family and being shit at fighting and a disappointment to her father, who ended up favouring her more talented sister. On top of that, her own cousin was better than her at fighting which was even more of a punch to the gut for her. The pressures of being born with high expectations and being shit at fighting led to her developing shyness and an inferiority complex, which is the entire reason she likes Naruto in the first place.<br><br>It was all well explained.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate is annobjectively better series than nardoshit</br>  Naruto shipping threads are the best threads on /a/, and they always have been. Also, how come you guys don't doubles bomb Naruto threads to death like you used to? IT used to be literally impossible to even have a Naruto thread, so you're either all newfags or you simply don't hate Naruto as much as you used to.  <br>Her character development was better than Sasuke's.<br><br>Shy/weak &gt; Starts believing in herself &gt; Realises she's not as shit as she once thought &gt; Dies to tip Naruto into Beast Mode &gt; Is the girl to only really understand Naruto and make him snap out of it at the Shinobi World War<br><br>Sasuke, rather is just dark and edgy &gt; Darker &gt; DARKER &gt; Save Naruto &gt; OROCHIMARU HAPPENS &gt; DARKER &gt; DARKER &gt; KILL MY BROTHER &gt; DAMMIT WHY DID I DO THAT &gt; DARKER &gt; DARKER &gt; TIME TO FIST NARUTO<br><br>And then Gaiden happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both fucking terrible.</br>  <br>Hinata is shit like most of the female characters in this series.</br>  <br>The only time she was ever shown as stalking naruto was when he was leaving the village with jiraiya, and that was hardly stalking, just saying goodbye. Something Suckura couldn't even do.<br><br>Also given her panel time, she was pretty well developped.</br></br></br>  Oh look it is baby's first anime, starring /v/!  <br>it is like she was designed to be a perfect semen demon</br>  <br>You obviously stopped watching before the Chuunin Exam arc. You should give it another shot.</br>  <br>Hinata is love.<br>Hinata is healing.<br>The power of Hinata brings peace to all lands.</br></br></br>  <br>DON'T FUCKING SEXUALIZE HIMAWARI.

She might have inherited her mom's sweater puppies no jutsu.</br>  <br>Nothing is good enough to warrant a dozen threads a day.</br>  <br> Her character development was better than Sasuke's. <br>Yep, but who's wasn't?</br></br>   naruto being on /a/   <br>Tenten's</br>  <br> DON'T FUCKING SEXUALIZE HIMAWARI <br>OK, we won't.</br></br>  <br> You should give it another shot </br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>She's 6 in the upcoming movie</br>  <br>Naruto is normie central the anime.</br>  <br> She's 6 <br><br>Are you fucking retarded?

Yet one thread about Naruto and faggots come out of the woodwork to shitpost in it,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Mum, how come none of the boys like me? <br>  Well, Sarada, unfortunately you inherited my brains, rather than Hinata's rack or Karui's ass. <br>  Also your father was an S-Rank criminal </br></br></br>  <br><br>She look like Hibiki clone  But with more tits </br></br>  <br><br>I thought it from the start. Her short hair is fucking her up. Also her glasses are too. Not saying she's flat since she didn't go through puberty but that would be the final nail. Frankly she looks like that glasses guy from bleach</br></br>  <br>The cake was from a flashback if I'm not mistaken.</br>  <br> Not saying she's flat since she didn't go through puberty but that would be the final nail <br>If she'll get tits they'll be extremely delayed thanks to her mother's shit genes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck would you know that, there wasnt even a preview screening yet?</br>  <br> unfortunately you inherited my brains <br>Doesn't work since Sharingan is a brain defect</br></br>  <br>Sasuke's mom had decent ones. Let's hope sakuras shit genes don't win out she already ruined salads hair</br>  <br>That makes the most sense. However, Hinata looks the same as she does in the present.</br>  <br> he doesn't like short hair </br>  <br>  implying you can't have Sharingan and intelligence <br><br>Sasuke was dark n edgy, but he figured out Danzo's entire Izanagi shtick and came up with a Genjutsu to make him think he still had a use left. He's was bright enough.</br></br></br>  How weird when fanart ends up being prophetic.  <br>Brain defect != lack of intelligence</br>  <br>She won nothing.<br>Getting yourself in a relationship with someone you love isn't a victory, now she is bound by her marriage and lost her freedom.</br></br>  <br><br>It was what the spoilers said right before the trailer came out. Beats me wether or not nips can be trusted.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon but Danzo was a fucking retard when it came to Izanagi usage. <br>Sasuke's victory over Danzo is like playing Dynasty Warriors on Easy. Danzo was basically just jumping into Sasuke's attacks and wasting Izanagi like it wasn't one of the straight up best Jutsu in existence.</br></br>  <br>I don't see it</br>  <br>The whiskers on Bolt and loli Hinata makes me wonder if they inherited some portion of the Kyuubi's power.</br>  <br>But Sasuke and Sakura were by far the male and female with most suitors in the series.</br>  <br>Then what I was getting at was that she inherited Sakura's intelligence.  Although that might not mean much, considering she was pretty much only good in the classroom <br><br><br>Danzo would've wiped Sasuke if he hadn't been holding back to take on Madara/Tobi after the fight. His plan was always to wear Sasuke down with repeated Susano'o use. Sasuke just had more chakra than expected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agree<br>Marriage is the worst contract</br></br>  <br>I agree with you to an extent anon, especially that Kishi did a really poor job of developing his side characters,. I would say however that she grew out of her stalking phase at a young age (she really only stalked him during their time in the academy.)<br><br>Now here is a scary thought: Hinata is actually one of the more well developed side characters in the series, Kishi just made it hard to find any info on her by reading the manga(or anyone else for that matter).</br></br></br>  <br>It wouldn't be the first time. Remember that NH pic from 2006 with the red scarf? Only difference is Bort's a bit more of a hyperactive shithead in the official one.</br>  Which one would you fuck?  Kyon  <br>Asakura</br>  Denwa  <br>Forehead alien</br>  <br>all of them. rape orgys dont know about satiety.</br>  <br>But she's literally Loraina Bobbitt.</br>  Drunk Asahina  Brown hair turn me on.  <br>Seconded.</br>  <br>eyebrows</br>  <br>Hatefuck with the god.</br>  If I had to choose one is take Haruhi<br>But if I could I'd want all of them<br><br>/thread my taste is infallible</br></br></br>  <br>Green hair</br>  <br>look at them hang</br>  Brown hair is delicious.    What the hell? This is a thing in Japan? Canned Bear?  <br>They eat all kinds of weird shit in Japan. Bear seems like it would be one of the more tame items.</br>  <br><br>I wanna know what bear tastes like.</br></br>  Well, why the fuck not?<br><br>Americans &amp; Canadians are crazy enough to actually go into the woods to hunt down living bears.<br><br>Having them canned just takes out the thrill of the hunt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've actually had bear before. If I had to compare it to a familiar flavor, I would say that it's pretty close to beef. By no means is it exactly the same, but that's the best description I can give to someone who has never tried it.<br><br>The texture, on the other hand, is very similar to pork.<br><br>So imagine a beefy flavor with a slight earthy/nutty tone, that feels like pork when you chew it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Canned Bear? <br>How else could I come home and crack open a bear?</br></br>  <br>What's with Asians and eating weird shit? I read chinks eat monkey brains too. I thought Asians were supposed to be smart.</br>  <br>We don't hunt bears to eat, we hunt them either because they are a nuisance and have to be put down, or for trophies. <br><br>Who the fuck would eat bear when you can hunt deer and elk much more safely?</br></br></br>  <br>That's nothing. Australians eat kangaroo (one tasted some that a relative brought, it tastes very similar to beef), while in China and Vietnam some people still literally eat dogs. Still, that's not event the weirdest food the Japanese have: ever heard of wasabi ice cream?</br>  <br>From what I remember, the live monkey brain eating thing is more of a back-woods, underground thing in south Asia.</br>  <br>I don't know about you, but I know people who have hunted bears to eat them later on.<br><br>Where I live, bear-hunting licenses are distributed via lottery, so whoever's lucky enough to win the draw is gonna get the most out of that bear. I'm sure they've got a nice bear-skin rug or two, but you can bet your ass they ate the meat underneath that skin.<br><br> Who the fuck would eat bear when you can hunt deer and elk much more safely? <br>Once again, where I live, whoever's lucky enough to obtain bear-hunting privileges. It's not like anyone can just grab a gun and shoot bears willy-nilly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>People eat weird shit everywhere.</br>  <br> I read chinks eat monkey brains too. I thought Asians were supposed to be smart. <br>They are smart because they eat monkey brains</br></br>  <br><br>That sounds pretty good anon.</br></br>    <br> But asians eat weird shit in a far higher percentage than other peoples, fucking kill yourself you liberal shit. Some groups of people are different to others, what's with you dumb motherfuckers that you try so desperately to prove otherwise?<br><br> It's not even offensive, just a fact.</br></br></br>  <br> asians eat weird shit in a far higher percentage than other peoples <br>Ladies and Gentlemen, this is what happens when an Amerifat gets all his information about other cultures from cartoons.</br></br>  <br>Dude, I live in the US and I've eaten buffalo, horse, bear, guinea pig, donkey, shark, snake, and various insects, and  cat .

Canned bottled water.  how does bear taste like?  <br>Beary tasty.</br>  Is it actually canned bear or is it just a logo/marketing gimmick? I'm pretty sure Chicken of the Sea isn't made from actual chickens.  <br>No alligator meat? Step up your game.<br><br>Also, lol at the guy who thinks anything that isn't hamburgers is "weird shit." When it comes to food, the only thing that matters is if it tastes good or not.</br></br></br>  <br>like parasites</br>  <br> people eat weird shit every where <br> HURRR DURRR LIBERAL HIPPIE FUCKER <br>Retardation: the post.</br></br></br>  <br> europe <br> complaining about unconventional food <br><br>U wot m8?</br></br></br></br>  I want eat yuri bear.  <br>Well, for the milder tastes there seems to be deer-in-a-can just next to the bear in the picture.</br>  <br>Shock<br>Kuma shock</br></br>   amerifats confused that people eat different things outside of America   <br> bottled water <br> in a can <br>how</br></br></br>  Hungry?  <br>Horse meat is pretty common though.</br>  <br>I don't live in that area, so alligator is hard to come by. I'd love to try it sometime though.</br>  <br>Why are Amerifats so fucking ignorant? Jesus Christ</br>  <br> t. amerifat </br>  <br>From their point of view, whites eat weird shit in a higher percentage than others. Everything's a matter of perspective.</br>  <br><br><br>He said he was European.<br>Get rekt Europoors.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there an actual market for coast-raised chickens? How possible are they to begin with?</br>  <br> fucking kill yourself you liberal shit <br>He's either an American expat or an ameriboo.</br></br>  <br>Green tea kit-kat <br>Urgh</br></br>    <br>It's different to try these things, and have them available canned at your local supermart.</br>    <br>yes beary beary tasy.</br>  <br>Nobody who plays TF2 is strong enough to crack open a puppy, nonetheless a bear.</br>  <br> bear meat with curry, deer meat with curry, seal meat with curry <br>they sure love curry</br></br>  <br>I can attest to this.</br>  <br>Teddie please go</br>  <br>that water is labeled for emergency situations such as natural disasters. Water in plastic bottles expire quickly.</br>  <br>would gasoline stay preserved in aluminum cans or does it also degrade even then?</br>   Precure Thread   MANA DA BES  When you realized that precures aren't real?  <br>at being a shit.</br>  Twilight is dead. Long live Twilight.  <br>When you posted that.</br>  <br>Why do you hate Mana so much?</br>  <br>How can kigs be real if Precure aren't real?</br>  <br>Because all she does is nag and talk about how right she is.</br>  <br>I didn't ask about Ace</br>  <br>are kigs those creepy live show costumes</br>  <br> creepy <br>How rude.</br></br>  <br>Kigs not allowed before bumplimit. This is kigfree zone nao</br>  <br>Please define what a kig is for me. I have done google and in the archive but I cannot find a definition anywhere. I will repay you by using my amateur knowledge of finances to engineer a Momokoala for you</br>  <br> nao <br>dang it! i don't have a pic of her. now how am i supposed to change the topic of the thread? whatever.<br>POST UNPOPULAR CURES!</br></br></br>  <br>kig = kigurumi = 着ぐるみ = full-size stuffy costumes<br><br>But because these ones are anime characters, I guess they count them as well. You know about the stage shows though, right?</br></br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime<wbr>gao_kigurumi<br>In the context of Precure, they're used for stage shows so they can get a look consistent with the anime, and consistent across performances over the country.<br><br>They're also used for fetish stuff. Check /jp/.</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>We are playing tough boy? Well whatever, Mana has her ways how to break shell and consume the soft inside with her love.</br>   Makopi in charge of reading the atmosphere   <br>They do it for tokushit and Precure is basically tokushit so it makes sense that they also have stage shows for the little kids<br><br><br>I would really rather not check there<br><br>I can only guarantee one Momokoala though despite my gratitude. Fight each other for it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Finally got it to fit under 3MB at full framerate!<br><br><br>You're really getting a lot of mileage out of that gif, aren't you. I'm glad.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not like the others are very sensitive when they find out what Makopi lost.</br>  <br>Toku lends itself a lot more naturally to stage shows, hence why some people are afraid of kigs.</br>  <br> disgusting boys instead of cute girls <br>Why would you do that when this franchise has so many beautiful girls.</br></br>  <br> disgusting boys <br/></br>  Where is the restroom  <br>In dungeons.</br>  <br>Woah, I've never thought that cures would use dirty tricks like that.</br>  <br>FILTH!<br>Do not degenerate the pure Precures into your weird fantasies!</br></br>  I love Mana.  <br>I don't mind girls with boys as long as they are happy.<br>Still, I will take a group of cute girls over ugly boys any day as long as I live.<br>But I suppose you are faggot that doesn't like girls.</br></br></br>  <br>The filth is you, /u/ poster. Crawl back into your place of dark void where you came from.</br>  pls hapicha was last year  <br>You require cleansing.</br>  <br>No I don't need to be brainwashed.</br>  <br>Right back at you, sc/u/m.</br>  <br>The joke's on you, I'm not even from /u/.<br><br>But OP's picture is from /y/. Therefore filth, go back to /y/ with your whale friends.</br></br></br>  <br>You seem quite knowledgeable about /y/. Either you are /y/ poster, but those don't come here or you are /u/ poster who shitpost on /y/.</br>    <br> cute boys precure <br> Yayoi still rape bait <br><br>I'm okay with this.</br></br></br></br>  Pr/e/tt/y/ C/u/re supports all fetishes, and all pairings are canon.  <br/>  <br>The only people who aren't welcome in /pc/ are the ones who try to dictate which fetishes aren't allowed.<br><br>Straight and gay pairings are all equally (in)valid.</br></br></br>  <br>HIDOI!</br>  <br/>    Cutest boy.    remember to stop by and say hi<br/>  <br> i came here to fuck bitches-roma </br>  <br>You want to give Scum-senpai a heart attack, don't you?</br>  <br>Senpai!? Where?</br>  <br>In the link the anon posted, Yayoi.<br>You should go since we know how much scum-senpai loves you.</br></br>  1-hour drawing incoming.<br><br>Today's theme is the one half of the original duo, the Pretty in Pretty Cure, Yukishiro Honoka aka Cure White.<br><br>http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-07-13?<wbr>lang=en<br>http://togetter.com/li/847004?lang=<wbr>en</wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>    Don't want to be cruel but next up for the Precure the winners of the Chaos Bullet Club Feud and the Authority  <br>I don't get it.<br>And I like Rassin.<br>Are you saying that HHH is going to bury all the cures?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to tease human form aroma, then hug and cuddle him to calm him down when he gets annoyed.</br>  <br>No They are going to Kill HHH unless the Damn Storyline ends. If that's the case then Bullet Club vs All the Precures vs Suzukigun.</br>  <br> hey kid want some majic? </br>    <br> You will never see MiSu beat the crap out of or even bully all the Cures. <br>Why Live?</br></br>  <br>It's a joke but do you know any wrestler that would beat or bully any cures. But seriously I think the anime needs a villian that is just as tough as MiSu ( or Suzukigun or Bullet Club in general) to oppose the cures.</br>  <br>But in all seriousness, You are right Mr. Suzuki gonna need his stable but it's is still not enough to bully 40+ Precures or any Magical girl groups at all!!!</br>  <br> Yaranaika? </br>  ON a unrelated note, Do you think a beast will bully the Precures Like BROCK LESNEAR.  I love this expression.  So i watched an episode of Precure (Smile Precure) for first time and let me say this is fucking embarrassing to watch and i am so ashamed of myself because i kinda liked it.  <br>Smile is extra kiddy, yeah.</br>  <br>Smile is probably the most childish feeling Precure, but it's fun. Glad you like it.</br>  <br>Welcome.<br>You're here forever.</br></br>    <br>Maid<br> [Towa decided to live at Noble Academy] <br> There appear to be three maids here, so I should have no want while living here <br> Maids? <br><br> Pafu &lt;3 <br><br> Roma &lt;3 <br><br> Yui &lt;3 <br> Wait, no! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm scared of Precure<br>I don't like toku and my understanding is that Precure is basically that with cute anime girls</br></br>  Daily Minamin!!  <br>I guess it depends what toku shows you're talking about, but it is largely episodic and more on the superhero side of things compared to other magical girl shows.</br>    <br>That embarrassed feeling is from when the precure radio waves invaded your body and your body tried to warn you.<br>It goes away over time as your body is infected from further viewing.<br> One of us, one of us! </br></br></br>  <br><br>i know, cute girls give us happiness. It doesn't matter how or where do you fall to.</br></br>  Post yer webbums            Here's your new thread.<br> Still no news on vol.11 ch.2 </br>  <br><br>It's going to happen at someday date, I guarantee it. Assuming it's after Yukino final form arc, Yui will make move on 8man and 8man will decide there  probably by rejecting her . Then after that Yukino and 8man sort their feelings out</br></br>  <br> Implying Vol 3's entire Yukino and Hachiman date wasnt important <br><br>Holy shit. Granted BB fucked up that entire novel so if you just watched the anime you probably wouldnt even know what happened<br><br>I think they had Yui learning that Hachiman and Yukino werent dating when she got her gifts but in the LN it was when they were going to that strip card game with chunni</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukinofags think that it's #2 or #4,<br>but it's always #1.</br></br>  <br>Yui was never a loner. She hung out with popular people who were mostly superficial. When she met 8man and Yukino she felt like she didn't need to pretend to be someone she was not around them. That still doesn't make her a loner.</br>  <br>Thats why most people thought the honey toast date was where Yui would sink or swim. Most thought that would happen in Vol 11 but Watari made it a 3some date instead<br><br>Hachiman did make a mental note to out Yui out on a real honey toast date though so thats where it will happen</br></br></br>  What's the biggest asspull that you've seen in anime?  <br>As someone who played the game, is the anime worth watching at all?<br>I do know that at least the anime  made Faldio lose his whole squad at Naggiar against Selvaria, which even better justifies his later actions than the game does,  but aside from that is it more or less the same?</br></br>  <br>Nothing that happened in that final match was far-fetched or unbelievable  by the series' standards, at least. <br>Stage 2 DZONE being the power of teamwork or something was even cheesier than I expected it to be, but awell.</br></br>  <br>Does your reaction image folder need some expanding?<br><br>Because that's the only reason to watch it.</br></br></br>  <br> anime about assassins <br> zero deaths </br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, whenever anyone talks about asspulls in One Piece how come almost no one mentions this and Diable Jambe?</br></blockquote>]
