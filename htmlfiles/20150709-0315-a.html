I think that's a pretty low threshold for "deep jealousy". Maybe i need the translation.</br>  <br>51 - 69 here not 70 though<br>http://raw.senmanga.com/Boku-Girl/5<wbr>1/</wbr></br></br>  Haha, what the hell is Boku no Manga doing.<br>So behind...</br>  Continued from <br><br>Real subs when?<br>LN update for V7 was set for tuesday, and today is wednesday<br>FUNI a shit<br>Albedo gets the ED, but Narberal will be every secondary's waifu by the end of season 1</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because you like a typo, it doesnt make it cool or right</br>  <br>No, the head maid has a dog's head, IIRC<br><br><br> How strong is she compared to the guardians? <br>Weaker</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Real subs when? <br> FUNI a shit <br><br>Ahh, EOPs.</br></br></br></br>   1 cour <br> Will definitely up to the 3rd volume <br>My body won't be ready for this. Also,  Shalltear's DFC scene. </br></br>  <br> &gt;Real subs when? <br> &gt;FUNI a shit <br><br>The subs are fine, (I would have localized bitch as slut but that's just me) the problem is the frame rate, so yes, FUNI is a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still ahh EOPs, since raws don't have that problem.</br>  <br>Would it have been helpdul if Shalltear went into berserker mode during her fight with Ainz?<br><br>I thought about spoiling Ainz, but he has "technically" yet to appear in the anime and all the LN and manga bros already know who I mean</br></br></br>  <br> EOPs <br>what is EOPs? Early Overlord Playbacks?</br></br>  <br>Typical EOP not knowing what EOP means</br>  <br>Typical Non-EOP thinking everyone has the spare time to learn another language</br>  <br>Compared to english japanese is an incredibly simple and formulaic language</br>  <br>really? I know english, spanish, portuguese and SOME italian and find japanese to be a fucking mess. SO many words being used for more than 2 meanings</br>  <br> helpful <br> fight with Ainz? <br>In what what do you mean by helpful? To whom exactly.</br></br></br>  <br>to either of them. She would have lost her spellcasting ability but won a lot of melee potential, no?</br>   KOTAE WA DOKO AYY YEAAHHH YEAAHHH   <br>Imo it seems to be a punny language but that's just my opinion and im no expert. It's like the language designed by Fozzie or Carlos to ensure maximum punnage.</br>  <br>Oh im not accusing it of being a deep language at all. It is like crap made up by a 8yo. Its symbols are based on pictures of things that over time have been so twisted and deformed that they now look like symbols more than they do pictures, thus it is as if a 8yo had drawn a horse and said "mommy mommy I wrote horse!".<br><br>The problem is that, that's also how he writes mare, pony, donkey, ass and mule. Just a horse picture.<br><br>And every word has its own picture. Its not a deep poetic language, its just annoying as fuck to remember every symbol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would there even be a point unless she can build up a blood font?</br>  Daily reminder we're getting a similar MMO<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6nf<wbr>Q3wa9iBc</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1PU<wbr>bc3ofBgY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>CAUSE I FEEEEEEEEEEEEEL</br>  <br>precisely, but its not something she controls, its something that happens when she's bathed in blood.<br><br>When she summoned all those things, if Ainz killed them and the blood showered down, wouldnt she had been at a disadvantage?<br><br>By the same token, if she sliced them apart and used their blood, wouldnt that have been super helpful to her?</br></br></br></br></br>  Where do you guys think the next episode will end? at this pace, it looks like it will end with just SEEING carne village through the mirror  Do you think the anime gonna cover up to vol.5?  <br>doubt it, it's still going somewhat fast, likely they'll end with the grasp heart scene.</br>  <br>No way. We're getting volume three, MAYBE volume 4, but that's it.</br>  <br>The problem are the kanji and hiragana. They should just use roman alphabet.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure I saw lizardmen in the opening.</br></br>  <br>There is also Demiurge and his invasion in OP.</br>  <br>Yea, you can see Cocytus fighting them. Well, slaughtering them really.</br>  <br>It'll probably start with the prologue and end when Ainz shows up to save the day. By which I'm being sarcastic.</br>  <br>If lizards will be relevant they would have been in the scene where they flashed all the relevant characters.</br>  Author decided to use magic caster to catch all the variants (which were former Yggdrasil actual shits) under it, be it wizard, mage, sorcerer, priest, bishop, necromancer, druid and so on and narration also pins it in 2nd volume as such.<br><br>Only those ignorant of the actual magic system call anyone with the term if they can't reconize if action is from mage, wizard or sorcerer. Or like Ainz at start called him one, expecting to calm down the peasants, Enri and Nemu. So if you want to ignore the author who didnt propably think it through, feel welcome to suggest a better term that isn't one of the actual schools or classes.</br></br>  <br>Most likely, and 4th volumes ending isn't really good place to end it. 3rd and 6th volume ends are the good stop signs.</br>  So the MC's in a coma right?  <br>nope</br>  <br>Nope, cogito ergo sum.</br>  <br><br>So his conciousness just gets transported to another world...<br><br>So does that mean that the dark lord is inhabiting his human body?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope this ends up being good, so I can fill the void left in my heart by Log Horizon season 2</br>  <br>Nope. His past body is probably just dead. No biggie really. He didn't have anyone in his past life.</br>  <br>but that doesn't make any god damn sense</br>  <br>How so? Makes perfect sense to me. <br><br>And if you think something simple like THAT doesn't' make sense, boy you're in for a wild ride later.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't have to.</br>  <br>Is the first episode meant to be in black and white?</br>  <br><br>No idea what happened to his human body. Maybe he simply disappeared from existence. Could be he died, like the anon said. Or maybe he's living a split existence, with his original personality continuing to live on and with neither iteration of himself being aware of the existence of the other.<br><br>It's unimportant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>...you might want to go see a doctor anon</br>  <br>Since when an anime is make sense?</br>  <br>Or electric voodoo specialist if his comp can only give him b&amp;w.</br>  <br>2nd: Grasp Heart<br>3rd: Gazefs arrival<br>4th: Ainz takes his name/Epilogue<br><br>Or so I hope, it would give the three volumes all breathing room and 4 eps each + bonus round as 13th.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hello , little peasents.

She said this is called ‘a trap’, I am very sure of it.” <br><br> “Ah… So it Simmering Teapot-sama’s idea. Well with your body it should be no problem… But do youngsters usually dress like this?” <br><br> “Th-, that I’m not too sure.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, ok. The trap one seems very self conscious about it.</br>  <br>lol</br>  <br>a deadly trap indeed</br>    <br><br>Narberal is everywhere.

There's also a plate with a brain on it.</br>    So there is no one in the world that can oppose MC right?  <br>Why are there food look like human parts?</br>  <br>Sure there is, we just haven't gotten that far yet.</br>  <br>To be fair, English needs to be simplified as well. The fact that we have retardations in our language is enough to confused native English speakers is enough of a reason to justify doing it let alone foreigners trying to learn the language.<br><br>Hell, the word foreign is the perfect example. Simplifying it would make it foren</br></br></br>  <br>There is</br>  <br>maybe they like eating humans.</br>  <br> Some monsters from YGGDRASIL were also transported in and, with real world rules combining with their game mechanics, well... </br>  <br>Wait is this an attempt to explain why MC can solo everything despite it being an MMO?</br>  <br>Because humans are food?</br>  <br>Huh? How'd you get that meaning from what I said?</br>    <br>Hopefully the actually old dragons prove to be a nice surprise and hopefully they're also intelligent. Author did do somesort of future sneak peek where Shalltear almost got one-shot by one.</br>  God damned I expected his voice to be more spooky.  <br>I just figured that in that world stat bloat doesn't exist. So bringing Game monsters in would have that stat bloat and thus make them an actual challenge that you'd need a party for</br>  Is it really only him and the NPC's left in the world?<br><br>Guess my hype has gone down then, How the fuck can they create an interesting story with the same characters while stuck in this MMORPG world.</br></br>  <br>Because author doesn't have shit taste like you?</br>  <br><br>watch a doctor</br></br>  <br>World conquest?</br>  <br> despite it being an MMO <br>But he isn't in a MMO<br><br><br>Applys to you too, you fucking retard, Leouch<br>Kill yourself already</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Finally, an anime with a skeleton protagonist that I can get behind. Skeletons get way less representation in media as anything other than 2-dimensional goons than we should, so I bet this one will be a good watch. Even though the trapped-in-an-MMO thing is a tad disappointing, they seem to be angling it as a straight fantasy world as opposed to the 'still a simulation' business that you got with SAO and LH.  <br> World Conquest <br> Helping everyone  <br>You know when you're fighting bad guys it's not exactly world conquest it's more resistance</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't he top of the world already?

Take Shalltear and Ainz's previous fight; Shalltear could heal herself by attacking her own minions and Ainz' death spells actually killed everything in his surroundings, even the air itself (which he didn't expect).<br><br>Anyway, my previous example was about a  treant monster with a lot of health that grew and grew and grew. Enemies with a lot of health are always annoying to kill, but this one took it to an extreme. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bug Maid's hair <br>So they really are made of other bugs.

It feels like a hassle for me. The prose and overall feeling that the writer tries to convey on his piece is completely lost in translation.<br><br>For that reason is almost impossible for me to read anything I find in bakatsuki. The few novels I bought were from the local bookstore, and they are pretty dated, anything recent it's a pain in the ass to find.<br><br>Like for instance, beside this novel, I'm dying to buy and read the official mushoku tensei english translation, but sadly there's none. I tried reading the fan translation and almost popped a brain nerve reading all the basic narrative mistakes there were.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't read it then.</br>  <br> This gets a 0/Code Geass. Granted, I give every show the same rating, but it needs to be said nonetheless. </br>  <br>Because most of the time the "poorly translated" stuff is just some typo that you can easily realize as you read, maybe some weird sentence but you can realize that too in less than a second and keep reading.<br><br>Minor mistakes that only autists get mad about, if you enjoy what you're reading and paying attention then it's no problem.</br></br></br>  <br>  One of them is an imposer  </br>  <br>Nobody cares about your blog.</br>    So is this anywhere near as good as Game of Thrones?  <br>In due time you'll fix that shit automatically while you read.</br>  <br>You'd think it would be pretty fucking obvious if the legend says 6 people but 7 people have the sign.<br><br>"Well maybe the goddess made a mistake lol"</br></br></br>  <br> taking ign seriously <br> IGN rates SAO 9.6 <br><br>40 keks</br></br></br></br>  <br> So is this anywhere near as good as Game of Thrones? <br><br><br>ahaha<br><br>ahahahaha<br><br>aHAHhahAhhahahhahahahaahahahaha<br><br>ahahahaahaaaa</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So that's a no?</br>  <br> comunity <br><br>It has an actual pacing so yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not IGN ratings though</br>  <br>fuck off, retard</br>  Big puffy bunny cunny?

Also, 8 people have the sign.</br>  <br>Hope they go well but RnY is a weird anime to start from.<br><br>How new are they?</br></br></br>  <br>Funded at 2011<br>If you check out their following or official site you will find out they pretty much ignore they ever made Rail Wars</br></br>  <br>Oh they made Rails Wars? Heh.</br>  <br><br> Hates Chamo <br>Shittiest taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Did Chamo's mama tell you to order her around? </br>  Is flower wearing a black censor barre ?  <br>The LN has gotten fairly boring. I gues getting spoiled didn't help. Still, I haven't dropped the series yet I want to see development for the swamp loli. Also to see her kick more ass.</br>  <br> Also hates dat moe speech <br>Absolute shit taste.</br></br>  <br>Yes. She's trying to be the team's fanservice girl. I really don't know why she bothers even trying, what with the fake bunny being there and all.</br>  <br>That's traditional armor in her country, her super knight has a ram helmet.</br>  <br> I guess getting spoiled didn't help <br><br>Of course it didn't dumb faggot, the plot goes around the tweeeests, if you get the tweeeeeeeeeeests spoiled then it loses a lot of meaning.<br>It's not like watching Akagi and people telling you "he's winning" because you already know that so it doesn't matter. The less you know about RnY the better because you're supposed to say "oh fuuuuuuuuuck this filthy traitors"</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm someone who likes to get spoiled and never hesitates to read up spoilers of adaptations I get into since that normally doesn't ruin the story for me. I just didn't expect RnY to be the kind of story that would be buzzkill if you got spoiled. Well, I can still read for the setting and few other characters (Saint Swamp especially) though to keep it going for me, so it's not all lost.</br>  I like the OP of this anime.<br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1YexyFUNsuP</br>  <br>The whole novel revolves around people either being traitors, having their own agenda which takes priority over everyone else or both.<br>Nashetania is fun either way, she's a delightful cunt in vol. 4.</br></br>  <br> I'm a huge faggot </br>  <br> ANN is not better.

His only hope for victory is a surprise Fusion summon.</br>  <br> dick socks </br>  <br>I'm not even sure they could do the tourney, even if they wanted to. Bear in mind that all of the Lancers are supposed to be entering, as well as their pals in Synchro. There's no way to satisfyingly resolve an entire tournament that size.<br><br>My guess is that either Academia invades and starts carding people  like Jean please please , or the Lancers have to emergency port because Standard is being invaded or some such.<br><br>I just don't see way to actually play the entire tournament out, aside from doing a timeskip to the last 8 or something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wanting Shun to win even more <br><br>Bird boy needs to get a good loss to Fusion. Not this Sora off-screen shit. Just Dennis motherfucking Mackfield playing him like a damn fiddle then Fusing Xyz monsters to win. <br><br>But that will never happen because Ruri Raptors are more marketable than Entermages.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inb4 Dennis is a double spy </br>  <br> not triple spy </br>  <br>I hope not. I mean I want Yuuya to be happy as much as the next person who obsesses over him but Jack shouldn't lose his potency within the universe just because new characters show up.<br><br>Wasn't he blown down the stairs by Sora?</br></br></br>  <br> not quadruple spy </br>  <br>Penis is actually rooting for the winners, so, as soon as academia starts losing, he turncloaks.</br>  I'm just catching up on the last 16 episodes now, and I really regret missing all the threads. I'm certainly ENJOYing this new arc, though. Time to stock up on fanart, I guess.<br><br> mfw either Yugo or Yuya will be dimension-ported as a result of the upcoming proximity with Yuzu <br>Please don't make the fruits stay away from each other too long. Please.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't want him to win, it was just a bad joke about how Shun never loses. If anything I want him to be crushed so badly he's left in an even more pathetic state than Sora was after their first duel.</br>  <br>Arc V has a hard on for group duels, they could knock 75% of participants out with another Battle Royale in a few episodes if they wanted</br>  <br>I want him to watch Yuya vs Yuri in the shadows and I want him to see Yuri get blown out and have him just straight up not ever go back to fusion.</br>  Ok, I had enough of this shit. I want you to say to me, why it's not bullshit when I say neither Lavalval Chain, Infinity or Vanity deserves the ban.  <br> See that Yuri I was only PRETENDING to be retarded </br>  <br> fusion requires xyz monsters <br> effect based on the number of materials on the xyz monsters at the time of the summon. </br></br>  <br> Finals of Friendship cup is Yuya vs Yugo, winner gets to vs Jack for title of King. <br> Yuzu is sitting in the stands right next to the ring <br> As Yugo and Yuya are riding along side each other they pass Yuzu, bracelet starts acting up and ports one of them </br></br></br>   Sawatari and Gongenzaka are literally fodders for Shun.   <br> why it's not bullshit when I say neither Lavalval Chain <br>Its a great utility card that helps a ton of decks, but it isnt broken. The only really bad interaction it has is with Clown Blade, and you should hit either of those before you ban this<br><br> Infinity  <br>Would be perfectly fine if only shitty Rank 5 decks could use it. Ptol is the problem card<br><br> Vanity  <br>Probably should be banned yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/dng/ <br><br>Also<br> Chain <br>It's a staple for almsot every deck with R4 access, a plethora of them being casual fun decks, and there is absolutely no reason to ban it because of the meta, since everything using it only has it to have more consistent access to the broken shit that deserves banning and would have more than enough alternatives even with it gone<br> Infinity <br>Ptolemeius is the problem, no need to take away CyDra's alternate win condition<br> Vanity <br>It's fine at 1 and helps keep things in check nicely enough</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dennis is going to make sure that Yuzu isn't around so Yuya can absorb Yugo.</br>  http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>43798</wbr>  <br>After, like, 90% of that duel being offscreen. Bird boy needs to have a full duel with Dennis onscreen. Shun pushes and pushes and just when he thinks he has Dennis on the ropes BAM! Big reveal that Dennis is Fusion in the form of him pulling an Xyz Fusion to beat Shun's 9x Ranked Up Cuntcrusher Falcon.<br><br>God I fucking hate marketing.</br></br></br>  THIS ARC OF SMILE<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>11556</wbr></br>  Why did they pick fusion as the bad guys?  <br> Still won't change his best boy status </br>  <br>Lavalval Chain helps many decks to have access to broken cards, but I don't think it's broken.<br>Infinity is overpowered, but not broken, Ptolemaius is the big problem.<br>And Vanity is fine.<br><br><br>Gonna ask you something, the hands are still good?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  WE FINALLY HAVE A MMD WITH A RIN MODEL!<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm265<wbr>78783</wbr></br>  <br>Superpoly was super evil.</br>  <br>Good enough to splash in anything that needs to fill some monster slots and can use them.<br>Just lost a bunch of their power lately.<br><br> Seriously, &gt;&gt;&gt;/dng, though. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Wasn't he blown down the stairs by Sora? <br>That duel was terrible compared to their first one. I wish they skipped Serena vs Dennis to show it properly.</br></br>  I'am free so who wants a duel on<br>Ygo Pro it just got an update with new cards only for the android version</br>  <br>Maybe. I thought for sure that when Dennis said Serena would be right along during the prison break that he actually meant he'd ported her back to the Fusion Dimension, but he didn't.</br>  <br>The first one is literally the best YGO duel of all time, most duels suck in comparison to it.</br>  His face looks more fox-like every episode.  <br> Lavalval Chain <br><br>why<br><br> Infinity <br>Agreed<br><br> Vanity <br>why</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>his forehead nose conjunction must have hurt that mom pretty badly in childbirth</br>  <br>No, but that one wasn't even a duel. They showed the beginning and the end and that's lame.<br><br>Meanwhile, if they skipped Serena vs Dennis, things like Tricklown wouldn't exist too.</br></br></br>  <br>They couldn't make it xyz as those are their big money makers and nobody cares about synchro and Ritual is a bad joke so it had to be Fusion by process of elimination.</br>  RURI~<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>05685</wbr></br>  <br>Q U A L I T Y</br>  <br> Lavalval Chain <br>It's fine<br> Infinity <br>The problem is the card in conjunction with Ptolemy that and the fact that you're allowed to use overlays on opponent's turns, it effectively can shut down anything if used properly, which is a bit much, deserves to at least be limited or allocated solely to Rank 5 decks, having it in Tellar is too much especially multiple.<br> Vanity <br>Needs to be banned.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't make this game more complicated than it already is.</br>  <br>Synchro already got to be the evil one in 5D's and Xyz was a bit overdone in Zexal<br>And Fusion makes the most sense story wise as it makes sense that Fusion dimension would be the one trying to fuse all dimension.</br></br>  <br><br>I like that we learned that Jean-Michel is actually just some lower dog and doesn't have that much power after all. Makes him somehow more interesting, dunno why</br></br>  <br>And what about the fags like me who just like Cyber Dragon and the fact that you can use Infinity with a lot of deck you may like (like NK or LS) is something I can love even though everyone else can also do it?</br>  <br> not overlaying the dimensions </br>  <br>I love Cyber Dragon too, but the card is a tad much considering it's not limited and can be used on either turn and keep consistent Xyz materials. It mostly just needs to be banned from Tellar, they can easily get two of them out in short work.</br>  <br>How do you make Cyber Dragon Nova or Infinity in NK or LS?</br>  <br>In LS you can use Clownblade and the milling does the rest. NK it's something I have never see tho.</br>  <br>how do you Noble Knight into infinity I need to know for science reasons.</br>  <br>How soon until he turns on the Council and attempts a coup or joins up with Leo as head henchman?</br>  <br> not fine tuning the dimensions </br>  <br><br>It's more of a tech anyway, I have a weird use of outdated cards like Call of the Haunted and Soul Charge, and sometimes I can make a Ptolemaius&gt;Nova&gt;Infinity, at least with NK, with LS is what  say.</br></br>  <br> outdated cards <br> Call of the Haunted and Soul Charge </br></br>  <br>the only NK combo that goes into infinity on its own would be. Brothers +2 fillers into pto into nova into infinity. But even then why would you even run it in Nobles? When will you ever have 3 monsters on the field.</br>  <br>The problem with Ptolemaus is that it took a deck that was already incredibly easy and cheap (Rank 4 spam) and then gave it Rank 5 spam. Now, there's basically no reason to play CyDras because Tellars do it better, and that's just a very sad place to be.</br>  <br>I've seen plenty of NK decks that get three monsters on the field rather easily.</br>  <br>tbh I don't even know why tellars exist except to raise the price of good xyz's. Komoney pls.</br>  <br> Not Penduluming the dimensions </br>  <br>Could you post the Ygopro download link? I'm a devpro user.</br>  <br>Because fuck, designing cards is hard. Here, have a Stratos, a Tin Goldfish, and a Wolfbark. They're archetype-specific. That's an archetype. It counts. Where's my cocaine?</br>  ALL THE POSTS IN THIS THREAD ARE NOW OVERLAY UNITS FOR MY MONSTER  <br>ah good it's only rank 105<br> xyz encore </br></br>  <br>I wanna bang this girl but she is my sister</br>    <br>Who are you? Are you even a Yugioh character? Because of Overlay you couldn't have been in DM, GX or 5Ds and I know you haven't been in Arc V. Are you a shitty OC donut steel?</br>  <br>Err what about Zexal aka Yugioh XYZ</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with that.</br>  <br>Never heard of it. Some kind of fanfic?</br>  <br>I wonder if there is going to be a remix of his OST, fuck that shit was awesome.</br>  <br>Because it's even more unsure where Jean will end up or what he'll do in the future. He tried to brush off the dimension stuff as nonsense in front of the council until he was called out by Azul, so he doesn't seem to be too loyal to his bosses.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Infinity can stay the fuck on the game for all I care, he can negate only once per turn and any beater can beat it, the one who deserves the ban is Trishula, no matter what form he takes, once broken, forever broken, and so, needs to be banned. And no, I don't care about the negate target effect, matter fact, that's another reason for it to be banned.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fusion: Leo <br> Standard: Yusho <br> Synchro: Jean <br>There you go, evil power trio.

The only reason her prediction for the match with Yuya didn't pan out was A) because he has some kind of fate-breaking power, as also seen by the Headmistress' crystal ball shattering, and/or B) it's difficult to properly predict fate using only one tarot card. Even if it was less than accurate, though, her ability to see the future would have been handy, and her ability to scry even more so.</br>   /a/ was afraid Crow was gonna steal the show <br> He still hasn't had a single proper duel yet <br><br>I know what they're doing.

I don't think her predictions are specific enough to be that helpful to the Lancers, and she'd be another head to keep count of and out of trouble.</br>  <br>The real reason is that Aoi Yuuki is expensive and they already have Kakki as pseudo main character.</br>  <br>Think how confused Jean-Michel would be, seeing someone ritual summon.

There was no reason to bring him back to begin with.</br>  <br><br>Huh? Jack is telling him the exact opposite. If anything Jack tells him to not use Egao dueling only to make himself happy so basically Yuya is supposed to go even beyond Egao and needs to entertain the crowd no matter how he himself feels. Which of course is bullshit, but that's exactly what Jack is doing as KINGU. <br>The only thing Yuya can take from this is being more persistent with his Entertainment dueling and just use it when he feels like it, which is also what Yoko told him</br></br></br>  <br>For all the crap he gets, Crow actually didnt win much at all in 5Ds. He jobbed more than Jack</br>  <br><br>This is just stupid. Arc-V Crow has nothing to do with 5Ds Crow and brining your hateboner for Crow to Arc-V is absolutely retarded. There is literally nothing wrong with Arc-V Crow</br></br>  <br>There is literally no reason for him to exist here either. Shinji could have easily taken Crow's role so far.</br>  <br><br>He didn't have a single loss in part 1 but in part 2 he jobbed quite a lot</br></br>  <br><br>The same logic Shinji has absolutely no reason to exist</br></br>  <br>No he didn't. Look at all his wins.<br><br>http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Crow_H<wbr>ogan#Duels</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Someone had to save Yuya &amp; Co.'s bacon when they first got to Synchro and then bust out of prison.<br><br><br>Also for someone who spent a decade in the clink, Hanafuda Man remained mark-free so what did Crow do in this dimension to warrant getting one?</br></br></br></br>  <br>And let's not forget that a Blackwings and RaidRaptors, be it in 1vs1 or as a team in a tag, is sounds like a pretty good opportunity for Winged-Beast infested comboes.</br>  <br>Maybe he was imprisoned before the marks were implemented.</br>  <br><br>Chojiro is a celebrity and also was the most powerful man in prison.

Give to me straight doc, does he have a chance?  <br>Because his ideals are retarded and not even his in the first place.</br>  <br>Yuya won't say ladies and gentlemen anymore. That's good enough</br>  <br>He'll struggle at first because of the riding aspect but I think he'll be alright.<br><br>He'll most likely lose, but his deck doesn't really counter Crow's and vice versa so it'll be fun to watch for the going back and forth part of duels people love</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I'm giving him 40%</br>  <br>The only way he's winning is if Crow lets him win.</br>  <br>There is one reason: They're in a fucking tournament</br>  <br> And then, appearing before Yuya, is a teenage boy with a card in his hand. <br><br>Inb4 Yusei</br></br></br>  Why is the construction of the overlay network so satisfying compared to other summoning animations?  <br>Whatever it takes for Yuya to start tuning like a motherfucker for the rest of the synchro arc.</br>  <br>They may be retarded but they are his, it's not wrong.</br>  <br>Because nobody tries to challenge them. The only ones who do are portrayed as the villains. For example, Kachidoki and his two pawns mocking Yuya's mindset are portrayed as douchebags. Sora rejecting EGAO is self-explanitory since he is currently a villain. Yuri will probably reject the EGAO too and he is the villain. Even Reiji comes off as a dick for saying Yuya's kindness won't do shit on the battlefield, which is true.<br><br>Now Jack will probably be portrayed as an asshole for saying that Yuya's ideology is flawed even though Jack is right.</br></br></br>  <br> They may be retarded but they are his <br>But his ideals are copied from his father.</br></br>  <br>It won't be Yusei.

That's literally his goal in this series. Especially because Jack is the guy who sold his soul to be rich and be used as a government puppet to entertain the crowds. <br>If this leads to anything at all it's Yuya learning how to show Jack true egao</br></br></br>  <br><br>It could be Jack calling Yuya out for his Yuzufaggotry.<br><br>Not that Yuya has really done anything bad as a result of his Yuzufaggotry</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Summaries also said the different ideals between Yuya and Crow would create hostility between them and it turned out to be a friendly joke duel.</br></br>  <br> I don't necessarily want to see Yusei return but if he appears just to give Yuya a card I'll be up for it <br>That'd be shit because it'd make Yusei look like an asshole for not doing anything else</br></br>  <br>If he's a Topfag in this dimension, why should he do something?</br>  <br> Not that Yuya has really done anything bad as a result of his Yuzufaggotry <br><br>He was willing to abandon the rest of the lancers in the jail to go see Yuzu. At that point he might of been willingly to inflict violence on Yugo and drag Yuzu back by the hair at that point. Yuya really needs to relax, he's stretching himself thin as hell with trying to be the De-facto leader of team baka, supervise a crazy shota, keep up the Entertainment ideal, try and rescue Yuzu and keep his promise to Mieru, the kids, his parents and his teacher, Yuto AND be as good, if not, better than his legendary father who discovered the method he duels with now. That's a tall order for a 14yr old with personality issues.</br></br></br>  <br>If he's a topfag why is he giving Yuya a card? And do people really prefer Yusei being back, but just being some random fuck who doesnt effect anything rather than just not existing?<br> The VA said he isnt coming back anyway and there's no way they wouldnt have promoted it the same way they did Jack and Crow </br></br>  <br><br>We have absolutely no idea what Yuya would have done after he broke out. That's all just your headcanon, anon.<br><br>I can't imagine Yuya not trying to take his friends with him when trying to break out or trying to break them out once he got outside.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the sound.<br>  it's the only reason why I watch all the Zexal 1 episodes  </br></br>  <br><br>No the VA said that he's busy banging Aki, not that he isn't coming back</br></br>  <br>DID SOMEONE SAY IT'S TIME FOR AKI-POSTING?<br><br>BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE I HEARD SOMEONE SAY IT'S TIME FOR AKI-POSTING</br></br></br>    <br>Please no<br>Everybody gets unreasonably lewd when we Aki-post</br></br>    <br>Why on earth did this remind me of the MEATBALL PARTY, thing?</br>  <br>Dude, there's a reason why Crow told him to treasure his friends when he asked to be included in the escape.

Crow didn't want Yuya to be caught up in their mess. He's indebted to Shinji, not Yuya, so if Yuya got caught with Crow while they were trying to escape or if the guards found out Yuya and Crow were friends, it would have meant the gas chambers</br>    <br><br>And then Crow proceeded to tell their plan to Gon.<br>If Crow had told Yuya about their plan, he would've done a much better job at distracting people, Sawatari wouldn't have fucked up and they would've escaped without the guards even noticing.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget that one new Red Archfiend dragon synchro.</br>  <br> Sawatari fell into the kitchen is his fault <br> Not Yuya who uses his Hippo to hit him into the air </br></br>  <br>Yeah, only because Gongenzaka forced them to tell him<br><br>He didn't want to take the chance, and when he did, they ended up getting caught.</br></br></br>  <br>Sawatari deserves to lose with his shitty blob monsters.<br>He had fucking Daibakaze, but no !

I want to know more about Academia and Leo's goals.   and I want more GX cards support    <br> I want more Superheavy Samurais <br>Him losing doesnt mean they wont reveal good new Superheavys. Most of the ones from his last few duels which he won have been shit, but we got scales, Horagi and the syncro in the duel he lost against Yuya</br></br>  <br>Guess am I the only anon who doesn't find the UTs unappealing or shitty?<br><br>I couldn't care less for the Yosenjus now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is just getting ridiculous. Superheavy Sams have a lot of support already. We have more Superheavy Sams monsters than Raid Raptors and Entermages combined. <br>Also just because he loses doesn't mean we won't get new Super Heavy Sams, although we really don't need any</br></br></br>  <br>What do you like about them ? I'm really curious about that.</br>  <br>I don't mind UT, I just prefer Yosenjus<br><br>I'm just more disappointed that UT appears to be budget D/D and thats kinda lame, at least Yosen are their own thing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think they could be a really fun deck that can abuse the pendulum mechanic quite well, but Sawatari needs to do any good plays with them first.

They all list some kind of Script magic cards, but we havent even seen one yet.<br>Holy fuck, i'm so sick of Arc V battle Royales</br></br></br>  <br>Yet only two Synchros and only one created in the anime while Raid Raptors have 5 Xyz and 4 created in the anime.</br>  <br>Why?

I don't blame secondaries for perpetuating the common dense headed shonen protagonist stereotypes we hear about him. UBW anime did NOT do him justice.</br>  <br>Go to bed Cooking Priest.</br>  <br> Miura fucked Shirou's character up <br>Nah from what I can tell, it was Miura's second rate episode directors that screwed over the pacing and some characterization.<br><br>Miura himself delivered Shirou's answer. Which was beautiful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy should have never been allowed to draw. Because of him we got those fucking stupid noses.</br>  <br>Found it<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GVC<wbr>4yDWGP6g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I really don't get why people say that. The anime spends a lot of time explaining why Shirou does the shit he does</br>  <br>wow in 5 years he's gotten absolutely no better as an artist</br>  <br>Some people get annoyed that they didn't spend an extra 10 hours narrating Shirou's every thought.</br>  <br><br>Truth be told, I kind of do with UBW was a bit more secondary friendly. It would have made the pacing a bit better imo.<br><br>All the backstories and stuff should have been in the first cour.</br></br></br></br>  The fans who complain about ufo UBW are retarded, the show was perfect.  <br> Miura himself delivered Shirou's answer. <br><br>Did he direct that episode? I thought it was Takahashi Takurow</br></br></br>  <br>If memory serves, Miura personally directed both 20 and 25.</br>  <br>oh never mind, I forgot they basically put most of answer in episode 20 which was why the actual answer episode felt rushed</br>  <br>Yeah, it's perfect if you're a secondary shounen fag.</br>    <br>What makes you say that, epic meme master?</br>  <br>Do you seek attention?</br>  <br>you have it backwards, as far as an adaption goes this was top-notch<br><br>Secondaries may not like because they came from Zero and... Yeah</br></br></br>  <br> I liked [thing] before [popular version of thing]! <br> Everyone who likes [popular version of thing] is a [derogatory label] <br> Now I feel better about myself for having liked [thing] </br></br></br>  <br> UBW was a bit more secondary friendly <br><br>It tried to be by tying all those Zero references but I think the anime got too ambitious with juggling the main narrative of UBW as well so it hurt its pacing in the process.</br></br></br>  I ask of you,  are you my fans?   <br>I'm a fan of Nasu, sure. I wouldn't put myself with all those other crazy fuckwits, though.</br>  <br>That's probably his peak as an artist for character designs.</br>  <br> He didn't seem all too popular with the crowd. <br>What makes you say that?</br></br>  <br>Wow that drawing sure is detailed.</br>  <br>Nah, I mean make it so that the story is structured more like an ensemble cast.<br><br>I honest to goodness love Shirou and co, but I would have loved to see a lot of the offscreen fights/plans. Lancer taking on every servant in a single night being one. <br><br>Or some of IIya's plans bar dealing with Shirou before she became heartless.</br></br></br></br></br>  I still don't get the end of 25. Archer is talking about himself right? How even though he lost to Shirou he's still going to believe he was right and he will live with that suffering and pain forever. After that it shows a closeup of Shirou post-UBW presumably following his dream of being a hero of justice right?  <br>I dunno, whenever Miura was talking about on how he wanted to make "a story about Emiya Shirou", the audience seemed kinda dead.</br>  <br>No, it's Archer saying that Shirou was right. His dream, his original dream, wasn't wrong.</br>  <br>The translation fucked up that scene. Archer said that HE got his answer, not Shirou.<br><br><br>The thing is tha anime couldn't deliver how fucked up in the head and empty Shirou is. And not showing all that people sufferng horrifying deaths was a mistake. Add Shirou's parents dying even if that's from HF, add people begging for help, burning and dying, add more goddammit, make the people empathize with him, that's what they should have done.<br><br>Another low point was not making the connection about Rin seeing the "dead" bodies in the classroom and her reaction after Archer's betrayal. That was supposed to be an important scene, there Shirou realises that Rin is only hiding her true self behind her perfect magus persona.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh ok, so is he in the throne of heroes as he's mulling that over?</br>  <br>The scene was kind of symbolic. Archer was basically mulling things over though.<br><br> "After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland. <br> Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt. <br> Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking). <br> Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope. <br> Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait. <br> The camera stops at Archer's trail, and the scene ends on Shirou's back, shrinking in the distance. <br> (To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it'd be best if you didn't)" <br><br> He's not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point. <br><br>These were the notes given in the script. It was basically supposed to be a visualization of what Rin was just previously saying, with Shirou going farther than Archer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm secondary, and I even got the message that Shirou was fucked up. I have to agree with the other Anon, the audience didn't seem receptive of Shirou at all unfortunately.</br>  <br>That wasn't really in the Throne, that was supposed to be a flashback to their fight in the castle.<br><br>This copy of Heroic Spirit Emiya got his answer, but the original and every other copy will never get this knowledge. UBW anime made it look like Heroic Spirit Emiya got his answer, but that's wrong.</br></br></br>  <br> This copy of Heroic Spirit Emiya got his answer, but the original and every other copy will never get this knowledge. <br>Seems like he did in EXTRA, when the throne seemed to have converge into one "Emiya"</br></br>  <br>It might not be wrong, it could just be a straight up retcon.</br>  <br>Yeah they should have done that better. Didn't the Zero anime have people melting in Kerry's arms?<br><br>Actually, now that I think about it, why are secondaries complaining when they know how horrific the fire is through Kerry?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I went</br>  The anime did show bodies and people being screwed over. Look at the opening seconds of episode 1.  <br> make the people empathize with him, that's what they should have done. <br><br>I agree with this too. I feel a lot of people didn't care about his character in the first place because they thought his sense of heroism wasn't properly founded. They should've done a better job of immersing the audience into the horrors that Shirou felt in the fire and more insight into his personal thoughts about blindly helping other people. Lots of monologues about that would have been great. It also helps pave the way for why he acts the way he does and makes his ideals even less contrived because there is a specific reason he believes what he believes. <br><br>Watching UBW I can see how someone who hasn't read the Visual Novel could easily overlook that aspect of his character and think he's some arrogant kid who is pursuing an idiotic ideal, realizes it's idiotic, but still does it anyways. Also, he really needed some fighting monologues. He may be socially dense, but he's got great battle sense and tactics. I appreciated whatever monologues we got about his schema but there were some fight scenes in the beginning where he looked so fucking clumsy. I really hated the one in the church where Shirou is going after Caster and does some retarded stumbling shit like he tripped on a banana peel. It made him look really dumb.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> , that was supposed to be a flashback to their fight in the castle. <br><br>so this takes place after Archer was presumably destroyed by Gil but really took his remaining mana and materialized himself in spirit form?</br></br></br>  <br>I gotta add that I wish they showed Shirou gaining Archer's battle experience better when he first did projection in the anime.<br><br>Some small scenes of Archer training with Kanshou and Bakuya in Shirou's mind would have been great, before he launched his counter attack on Kuzuki.<br><br>Infact, didn't the VN have a scene where Shirou was in consistent pain, even when doing minor projections?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Watching UBW I can see how someone who hasn't read the Visual Novel could easily overlook that aspect of his character and think he's some arrogant kid who is pursuing an idiotic ideal, realizes it's idiotic, but still does it anyways <br><br>Only if you don't pay attention. Everything you need is right there in the show. Seriously, you just have to actually watch. I don't want to sound haughty, but if you actually view it on more than a surface level, you get it.<br><br>There was an intention when creating the anime to show more than tell. "When the art is good, you don't need to spell it out". If you actually look, most of the time all your questions will be answered in what you're seeing, and what's being said.<br><br>Like, a while back, people bitched that they didn't add in the conversation where Kuzuki tells Caster that they couldn't take on Saber after she got back up, but if you watch the show, you'll see that right after Kuzuki says "wait", they do a deliberate pan onto Saber with her sword ready.<br><br>What do you think the implications are there? It's saying he couldn't take her on again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I really hated the one in the church where Shirou is going after Caster and does some retarded stumbling shit like he tripped on a banana peel. It made him look really dumb. <br>That was plain fucking retarded. Shirou was supposed to be completely exhausted after projecting so much against Kuzuki.<br><br>I also missed how in his first projection, Shirou said that Kanshou and Bakuya were the ones blocking the attacks given their experience.<br><br>Another thing: they NEVER fucking said the names of his sword. They never said Kanshou and Bakuya.<br><br>They could've used slow mo for Shirou's thoughts while fighting. I missed that part when he saves Rin and his body begins rejecting the projection and he goes all "I don't know about other people, but there's no way in hell I'm gonna die for creating swords!"<br><br>Damn, while I write I remember more stuff. In ep3, Shirou "felt" Archer's attack, and they even showed the circuit "interference". Well, they never again used that, and Shirou was supposed to find Rin in ep12 thanks to that.<br><br>I liked the UBW anime because is my favorite route, but at the same time it's a pile of wasted potential.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I also missed how in his first projection, Shirou said that Kanshou and Bakuya were the ones blocking the attacks given their experience. <br><br>You could tell that with the way it was animated. It was Shirou on autopilot.<br><br> Another thing: they NEVER fucking said the names of his sword. They never said Kanshou and Bakuya. <br><br>That's a really minor nitpick.<br><br> They could've used slow mo for Shirou's thoughts while fighting <br><br>That would get old really fast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This can work against the series too. See for example Zero, everything was fucking spilled out every fucking time, that way even if secondaries didn't understand, they knew it was explained for them. Do you think secondaries understood the Grail and Angra Mainyu in Zero? Of course not, but it was there, it killed people and it was edgy.</br>  <br> That would get old really fast. <br>Not for every scene, but for that one was necessary. For his fight against Gil it wasn't needed.</br></br>  <br>Worst thing they did in F/Z was in #24, where Kiritsugu explained the origin rounds.</br>  <br>Yeah but that's technical Jargon that needs to be explained.</br>  <br>Casual anime fans are retarded, this is a fact, that's why you need to explain every little shit.<br><br>And yeah, I know it was retarded, the same level or retardation was also there when Keyneth explained Time Alter. But it was necessary and secondaries understood.</br></br></br>  <br> That's a really minor nitpick. <br>To create attachment, you need to name it.<br><br>Kanshou and Bakuya, married swords created by blabla.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless they added a scene specifically talking about them, just adding their names in really wouldn't add much. You knew they were important because they were the first things Shirou projected, and almost solely the things he projected until the Gil fight.</br>  No matter what they do mainstream audiences will never like Shirou as much as Kiritsugu, both are broken characters and that makes them hard to relate but Kerry has the cool Batman factor, and Shirou is just a broken teenager.<br><br>HF will have the same problem, even if it's darker you have immature inexperienced characters and a victim is the heroine of the route. Almost everyone that started with F/Z will forever be disappointed with F/SN.<br><br>It also has that "competence porn" that is the all the rage these days, doesn't matter if the characters are fucking stupid like Tokiomi or fastwheels, they talk big shit so people think they know what they are doing.</br></br></br></br>  Why is the Fate/stay night fanbase so bitter and unhappy about UBW, again?  <br>I'm fucking not.<br><br>It's probably my favorite adaptation of anything /a/ related. It delivered in more ways than I could ever really imagine.</br></br></br>  <br>it's just some loud obnoxious fans that wanted a 100% faithfull adaptation, I'm pretty sure most people actually liked it.</br>  <br>It was a good adaptation overall.<br><br>But while reading the novel you empathize with Shirou, it makes you root for him. The anime couldn't do that, it only made you think "yeah, do it if you want".</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not unhappy or bitter. It was a good adaptation. Granted, not as good as the original experience of playing the visual novel but I'm not complaining.</br>  <br>The thing is I'm surprised considering Kerry has actually a lot of characteristics that one would find "edgy" but he's still pretty well liked.</br>  <br>The thing about killing his dad and the other girl who also voiced Riesbyfe was completely retarded.</br>  <br>I wish they left his backstory in ambiguity.</br>  <br>I actually expected this anime to surpass the original route. I was pretty excited that Nasu would be collaborating closely and writing new scenes to add depth and fix UBWs flaws. But I felt it just lacked the impact the VN had on me after all was said and done, and some of the anime original scenes were just pointless, like Caster's master which wasn't done very well.</br>  <br>Caster's backstory was fine I thought. She's a big character in the route, so obviously expanding her backstory isn't a bad idea. It's not like magi haven't been portrayed as being cartoon villains before.<br><br>And in some ways I do think it surpassed the VN. There were parts of episode 20 that I thought were just amazing, and really hammered in Shirou's answer. The Gil fight and the epilogue too were just plain superior in my book, as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they believe that  replicas can't be as good as the original </br>  <br>How is it no one liked Archer? he was the batman of the fifth war, and Kerry's spiritual successor.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everyone loved Archer. It was him or Kirei who was the most popular character for UBW.</br>  <br>Archer is popular as fuck. He's constantly topping polls in places like Newtype and at the Ufotable cafe.</br>  <br> But I felt it just lacked the impact the VN had on me after all was said and done <br>Honestly, Shirou vs Gil felt like reading the VN all over again. I'd go as far to say it was better. The epilogue was perfect as well.<br><br>I do agree that they could have done more with the new scenes though. In particular I was hoping they'd give the servants more depth, add their backstories into the show or something.<br><br>I have some complaints about the fights too. Shirou vs Kuzuki was nonexistant and Archer vs Lancer pre-Bulge was too short, and splitting Archer vs Shirou into two episodes was something I think should have been avoided as the second killed any and all momentum. Especially since they cut away from the main attraction every ten seconds to stuff some half assed Saber backstory in there. Oddly enough though, I liked how Assassin vs Saber was handled even though it was a lot different. The music was perfect and the scenes leading up to Tsubame Gaishi were really tense.<br><br>Overall, I'm very satisfied with what we got and I've already got the second BD Box on preorder, but I don't think it's perfect by any means. I have really high hopes for HF since it's my favorite route.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Saber didn't seem to be that mad at Gilgamesh considering what he did to her at the end of the 4th War.  <br>The biggest problem with Shirou vs Archer is the fact that there was a wait between 20 and 21. watched back to back to back, I think 19-21 do the confrontation justice.<br><br>I also don't really have a problem with the Archer vs Lancer fight since Gae Bolg vs Rho Aias was beautifully handled, and I'm sure it'll look amazing on the BDs. Plus there was a lot of action in that episode in general.<br><br>The only episode I felt I genuinely had problems with was 18. I don't know what the hell was going on there, but the CG for UBW looked almost nothing like the CG used for it later, and it was bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like, this is a PS1 cutscene.</br>  I love how cinematic it was. You can make a brief scene like walking to the church one of the most memorable scenes in the show.  <br>Because somehow after Fate/Zero's crushing disappointments (like the ending being rushed as fuck and many iconic scenes being sub par) they expected UBW to not only be better than that but better than the route itself</br>  <br>That was a really nice scene. I wish the BDs added more like it, but I can't really complain since the first season already had three hour long episodes.<br><br>They're supposedly promising more with the second set, though.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, Ufotable fucking nailed the ending with UBW.</br>    The level of detail ufotable give is incredible  <br>That scene was comfy as fuck.</br>  <br>Symbolism, too</br>  <br>The little things they did like Saber acknowledging Ilya for example. That was great stuff.</br>  How much you fags wanna bet those extra ten minutes on the second BD set will be shit no one cares about?  <br>Yeah they also did that when Shirou mentioned he was an Emiya.</br>  <br>Everything to do with Lancer was also really good</br>  <br>This is the stuff we have info about far.<br><br>Episode 13: A scene where Shirou wanders around the city injured, and a scene where Saber gets groped. This really could amount to just a few seconds though.<br>Episode 14: Supposedly a whopping 7 minutes will be added to Caster's backstory, with emphasis on how her master wanted her to summon a dragon. The maids deaths also are supposed to be uncensored, from what I understand.<br>Episode 15: Ilya's eyes getting slashed will be shown.<br>Episode 16: 5 minutes was cut, with a conversation involving Kuzuki and Archer being expanded on.<br>Episode 24: An opening scene before the credits was cut. Confirmed by viewers who saw a private screening with Ufotable staff<br>Episode 25: Nasu mentioned extra content involving Luvia was written for this episode and will be added on the BDs.<br><br>Note that these numbers go over 10 minutes, so there might be some discrepancies. Either folks were bullshitting with stuff like the 7 minutes added to the Caster episode, or Aniplex are rounding down. Considering we have cut content for six episodes though, that might be the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so far*</br>  <br> Episode 24: An opening scene before the credits was cut. <br><br>This is pretty interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was pretty weird that it was the only episode to not have a cold open, but this site here talks about the cut stuff.<br><br>http://gigazine.net/news/20150621-f<wbr>ate-sn-ubw-event/<br><br>No mention of what exactly was cut, but they confirmed something's gonna be added in the BDs.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  I'm still surprised cour 2 didn't have an hour long special.  <br>It makes more sense when you realize episode 12 wasn't meant to be an hour long in the first place. It was a mid-production decision.</br>  <br>That explains quite a bit, although to be honest, Archer vs Shirou should have been an hour in the first place.</br>  <br>Unlike Fate/Zero they managed to plan it out significantly better with the first two episodes</br>  <br>Aniplex has been really inconsistent on numbers when it comes to run times. I look at the import box and the localized box for the first season. One lists itself as 480 minutes, while the other is 420. You have to squint hard and add in the soundtrack if you want to get the 480 number.</br>  <br> Incidentally, the reason Saber didn’t speak her feelings during the Fifth War was because she had never asked Iri about her daughter’s name, and Illya’s appearance seemed far too young for her to be Iri’s daughter (after 10 years, the child that used to sit on Kiritsugu’s shoulders should already have developed a voluptuous body, that was the reasoning). So, she viewed Illya as an Einzbern homunculus completely unrelated to Iri – it’s definitely not a lame excuse. <br><br>She just thought of her as yet another one of Achts dolls. Probably remembered Iri though.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably weren't able to schedule it. If you remember, they did a CM advertising 20 and 21 back to back.</br>  <br> In ep3, Shirou "felt" Archer's attack, and they even showed the circuit "interference" <br><br>Which attack? caladbolg?</br></br></br>  I just got done watching the first season of Zero again. No one should ever fucking complain that UBW is more boring in comparison.<br><br>Like, I enjoyed it, but it was not some action packed thing that some people seem to remember it was. There's basically the fight at the docks, which takes up episodes 4 and 5, and the fight at the mansion, which takes up 7 and 8.<br><br>The vast majority of the rest of the content is just people conversing with each other, which isn't a problem at all, but when people act like Zero was some intense shit, they've got some rose tinted glasses. I mean there's an entire episode revolving around Rin saving her fellow lolis, and people shit on the finale to UBW having its little date scene, but the final episode of the first season of Zero had Waver and Rider going to town to check out the library and buy video games. It sets up Caster summoning his Cthulhu monster, but it doesn't end in any fights or anything.<br><br>I'm hesitant to move onto rewatching the second season, as I'd be comparing BD to broadcast when it came to the two shows, but fuck it, I want to see where people are seeing this magical difference between the two shows.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, and Rider using his RM was one of the stand outs as well. That's a good episode as a whole though.</br>  <br>Because of cookingpriest and his fellow priests doctrination that people think it's a bad adaptation which is not true</br>  <br>Because it was more "mature" with "stronger ideology" debated upon.</br>  <br> Like, I enjoyed it, but it was not some action packed thing that some people seem to remember it was. <br><br>I don't ever recall people loving Zero because of its action scenes, but because it actually feels like a grail war and changes its point of view between the seven masters which are interesting and some have relatable goals like Kariya or Kerry. Instead of following around dense harem MC while he goes to school and eats his bento, followed around by tsunsere-chan and having so much plot armor that he gets attacked by three servants (rider, archer, gil) and lives to tell the tale.</br></br></br>  <br> have relatable goals <br>Team Cool.</br></br>  <br>That really comes down to whether or not you're interested in ensemble storytelling, or a story that focuses on a more centralized cast.<br><br>Shirou is a solid character who's examined further and developed more than any of the cast of Zero, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with him taking on servants. It's a core theme of the narrative. He wants to be a hero, so obviously he has to get on the level of the other heroes. Each time he's gone up against a servant, there's been a perfectly solid explanation for why he survives.</br></br></br>  <br>Also Shirou isn't a harem MC. He gets no harem at any point in the narrative. He has a romance with one girl depending on the route you're on.</br>  <br> when half of the Audience seemed like F/Z fags too. <br><br>Most Western F/Zfags are women and the faggots who go to cons in the first place.<br><br>Why do you care about the Anime Expo audience in the first place.<br><br>Last year, there were actually super long lines for SAO Season 2 premier.<br><br>You actually care about con goers reactions?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hell yeah.</br>  <br> it actually feels like a grail war <br> 3 servants with the sole purpose of killing each other sitting together in a circle drinking wine and discussing ideology </br></br>  <br>Let's not forget how the war is actually officially called off for a little while because there's one team who don't give a fuck that it's a war.</br>  <br> who's examined further and developed more than any of the cast of Zero <br><br>Not in the adaptation. <br><br> Each time he's gone up against a servant, there's been a perfectly solid explanation for why he survives. <br><br>Yeah, plot armor and lots of nasulogic lore contrivances designed so he survives, like Nine Lives.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not in the adaptation.  <br><br>Yeah dude, they do. Maybe you should actually pay attention?<br><br> Yeah, plot armor and lots of nasulogic lore contrivances designed so he survives, like Nine Lives. <br><br>Okay, let's look at UBW. Shirou goes up against Rider, but is saved by Rin. Two masters who could easily call their servants puts her at a disadvantage. She skedaddles.. Shirou goes up against Archer, and wins an ideological battle against him, but it's made clear that he could have killed him a thousand times over. Shirou goes up against Gil, and he uses the powers he's downloaded from Archer, the mana boost from Rin, his distinct tactical advantage, and gets an assist from Archer and Avenger at the end to take him down.<br><br>There's really nothing too crazy unless you inherently don't like the idea of humans fighting servants, but it's on record that people like Kerry and Kirei at their peak could go up against servants too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if this happened in the 5th war fatefags would be praising the hell out of it for how deep it is, but they shit on it because in spite of nasu coming up with the idea of historical figures summoned in one place to beat each other, he never delivered on the obvious question that pops into any fan's head given that premise "what if they sat down with each other and talked about their lives? what would they say?" </br>  <br>Not that guy, but I don't have a problem with the grail dialog, but people who think Zero didn't have some silly stuff in it have a bit of a selective memory.<br><br>I mean it was three servants shooting the shit and getting wasted.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just rose tinted glasses, m8. Everything in F/Z is building up to the finale (ep. 20), just like how F/SN does the same</br>  Did anyone here buy the BDs?  <br>There's nothing to say, retard.<br><br>Medea would never want to talk to someone who is essentially Jason's cousin and Medusa was a loner in the first place.<br><br>Saber would have no reason to talk to Gil.<br><br>Cu was never known to be a talker as well because he only wants to fight and even told his wife to shut the fuck up despite her attempting to warn him that he was gonna kill his son and then proceeded to regretfully kill his son just like that.<br><br>Archer has no reason to be talkative because he already experienced this whole bullshit before and any kind of talking Archer engages in is only for provoking enemies using Eye of the Mind.<br><br>True Assassin is an Assassin. Why would anyone want a talkative assassin.<br><br> Kojirou would refuse any long conversation because as soon as he sees you, he wants you to get the fuck off the mountain since that's his job.<br><br>Fate/Zero retards like yourself, really don't use their brains, do they?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I bet Kojirou would be bro as fuck to hang out with.</br>  <br>What the fuck is going on with Shirou in that picture? Is he wearing his pants up halfway to his chest or does a blackened void just exist under his shirt?</br>  <br>In his spinoffs, he can afford to act friendly because Caster isn't ordering him to tell everyone to get the fuck off the mountain.<br><br>In the VN, he isn't allowed such luxury because Caster could give less a shit that she treats Kojirou as a mangy mutt.</br></br></br>  <br>A talk between Archer and Saber would have been nice.</br>  <br>A talk between Gilgamesh and Saber would have been nice.</br>  <br>What the fuck is there to say between Archer and Saber? He already talked to her before when he was young and now he's a jaded fuck who wants to fuck with his younger self.<br><br>Talking to Saber would just brew more self hatred and there's a chance Saber could find out he plans to murder his younger self through slips in their conversation which makes it even more of a pain in the ass to try to kill Shirou.<br><br>Or worse case scenario, Saber somehow manages to convince him not to kill Shirou and Shirou never has his fight with Archer in UBW.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is there to say? They already had a talk before and F/SN Gil just gives Saber more reasons to try to kill him asap.</br>  <br>Gilgamesh is a changed man and wants to treat Saber right.</br>  <br> Shirou never has his fight with Archer in UBW. <br>I don't see how that would be a big deal, since there's not much of a practical difference in Shirou's behavior before and after the fight.</br></br>  <br>Shirou comes to a complete understanding of his ideals, what they're worth, and why they're worth following. Shirou was basically able to tell Gil the fuck off after his fight with Archer because he finally had a total understanding of his wants, aims, and himself.</br>  Which was more impressive, Shirou beating Berserker or Gilgamesh?  <br>Gil.</br>  <br>I really do love Ufotable for their after effects and  BLOOM  bullshit. People say they're just covering up their mistakes? Good. God forbid some colour brings life to off-model, digitally produced wireframe people and makes it look better at the same time.</br>  <br>Gilgamesh is all bark with no bite.</br>  <br>Gil kills Berserker in UBW. Shirou beats Gil.<br><br>In HF, Shirou beats a weakened version of Berserker who's blind and kind of melting.<br><br>I mean both are impressive, but between the two, beating Gil is a bit higher up.</br></br></br></br></br>  UBW Shirou as a whole is a fair bit more impressive than HF Shirou, especially if you don't add in bad end stuff like Sparks Liner High.<br><br>Like, HF Shirou might technically be stronger, but it kind of fucks him up and he doesn't do a whole lot with it.</br></br>  <br>And none of that impacts his actions all that much. He was acting in the same manner even before he and Archer crossed blades, and he kept acting in very much the same manner after the fight had concluded, although he had developed a new reasoning to motivate his actions.</br>  <br>He also wouldn't have learned better projection or even UBW through that osmosis they ahd during the fight.</br>  <br>Without the reassurance he gets about his ideals from his Archer fight, Gil talking down to him would likely have gotten to him and he'd lose.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/F_5Q0QDaH5w?t=50s  [ ]<br><br>Look here. He uses the knowledge he gained from his fight with Archer to empower himself to take on Gil.<br><br>There's also the simple fact that fighting with Archer kind of made him a fuck ton stronger, so he probably would have been screwed if he tried to take on Gil without that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>animation. CG UBW and copypaste generic weapons, noses and sidemouth lots of still stupid jump cuts,butcherd scenes, rin turned to a generic tsundere, the shirou vs gil fight was fucking bullshit and shitty RN instead kiss with fade to black</br>  <br>Shirou might have already had UBW unlocked due to entering it in the church, but he certainly would be weaker due to not fighting Archer directly.</br>  <br>That's Berserker.</br>  <br>I did.</br>  <br>You can tell ufo fucked up what Nasu gave them when he must come out and explain the scene at the end because ufo couldn't do justice to it.</br>  <br>Awesome.</br>  Which was more impressive: Shiki beating Roa or Shirou beating Gilgamesh?  <br>The awful lack of cogs in the sky and no sparks were a mistake.<br><br>Both Shirou and Archer UBW looked exactly the same. Archer's UBW looks better in this promo art.</br></br></br>  <br>What I fucking hated of Zero was that the fights were fucking choreographies. Nice superhuman stuff there.<br><br>And we complained about Zero a fucking lot, only secondaries believe it was perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>The only thing I remember was "THEY WILL FIX IT ON THE BDS" and the hilariously bad prequel episodes that could have focused more on the cast and characters.</br>  Why couldn't they get Brian Cranston as Kuzuki in the dub?  <br>You might want to go back to 20 and check 24 again. They look pretty different.</br>  <br>Shiki beating Nero Chaos.</br>  <br>Shirou</br>  <br>Anyone could have kicked his ass.</br>  <br> Anyone could have kicked his ass <br>Except for Arcuied and most servants.</br></br>  <br> Fate vs Tsukihime <br><br>Don't open this can of worms, reddit.</br></br></br>  <br>You are retarded. Not even Arc's moon drop can kill Nrvnqsr and said attack is billions of times stronger than shit like Excalibur.</br>  <br>No shit, retard.</br>  <br> Not Reddit but you asked for it. <br><br>What makes Tsukihime better than FSN is the atmosphere, you can feel the danger, the drama, the mindfuck. The music does a better job to add to the atmosphere than FSN. The characters interactions are so superior to the character interactions of FSN that it hurts, and the slice of life segments and Shirou's point of view is fucking annoying. FSN plot is too forced at times, some times they lead to plot holes,weak plot or unexplainable developments. Tsukihime's plot flows better, it's simple and credible.<br>Tsukihime's plot is also more mature, each resolution have more weight to them 1) Arc and Shiki didn't end up in good terms in Ciel's True End, 2) After every single of the Far Side of the Moon routes, Arc and Ciel will keep hunting Roa, 3) Akiha ends up as a doll in one ending, 4) Akiha and Kohaku die in another end, 5) Hisui's Good End wasn't precisely happy. In F/sn, only 2 characters couldn't be saved: 1) Ilya in UBW, 2) Saber and Ilya in HF.<br>Shirou never actually shows his resolve when it comes to deal with people who are prepared to kill,and the story does not have serious and mature Masters - aside from Zouken and the only time Shirou had to confront one of his friends, was in HF against Black Saber. Shiki, on the other hand, had to fight Arc, Ciel, Akiha, and Satsuki at some point - there's also the point when he realizes all what Kohaku has been doing. FSN is just too light and aimed at teenagers. That why the dark and cold as ice Tsukihime is superior.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would hesitate to call Tsukihime "cold as ice", reddit.</br>  <br> not recognizing pasta </br>    <br>Type-Moon really does work better in visual form, huh</br>    <br> Cutting up the birthing woman when the baby is still inside <br><br>Roa, you card.</br></br></br>  <br> Detailed view of a quark <br>Every fucking time.</br></br>  I just finished Mahoutsukai no Yoru and it just might be my favorite Type-Moon thing.

There are some things I've come across that are uncannily good at mimicking Japanese style. I just wish places like /d/ weren't so reliant on it though.
