[  AX thread on /v/ <br> nothing on /a/ <br>How many of you /a/nons are going to AX? <br>What are you buying/cosplaying/watching?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>or fuck off back to /v/</br></br></br>  <br>No fun allowed.</br>  Go back to /v/ then.<br/>  Nothing worthwhile gets announced at AX.<br><br>Wait for actual Japanese event such as Anime Japan and Comiket.<br><br>/v/ has AX threads because Japanese game localization announcements actually happen there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't LWA gonna be premiered there?</br>   going to /v/ <br><br> why doesnt /a/ like cons though? </br></br>  Only "acceptable" thing is a livestream to a con, and that's because people let out their worst 4channer in the chat.  <br>is no one excited for bosshi?</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br>Not anime.</br></br>  <br>we used to have some fun con threads with ryu.<br><br>neo /a/ doesn't know though.</br></br></br>  <br>The reasons why you like going is likely the reasons why /a/ doesn't.</br>  <br>This. Isnt there a crunchyroll stream this time?</br>  <br>I want to meet for bosshi, but then I'll miss out on Super Epic Fun Time Love Love Dating Game Show: Extreme Edition</br>  <br>I'm too poor to go to the good cons though :^(</br>  I live like 30 minutes on foot from the convention center so theres no way im not going. Gonna be broke as fuck but still going anyway.  Give me a livestream and I'll gladly have fun and laugh at everything there. Until then, fuck off.  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br>Because paying 60 bucks to watch edgy 15 year olds dress up in Sword Art Online and Tokyo Ghoul costumes and buy overpriced anime merchandise which you can probably buy much cheaper off a vendor or online. WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT CONVENTION? Does this answer your question?</br>  <br>you forgot watching anime in public</br>  <br>/a/ doesn't care about Western cons or really anime events in general unless they include industry relevant announcements and stuff. <br><br> What are you cosplaying? <br>I really hope no one on /a/ is cosplaying.</br></br></br></br>  I'll be there again this year. Pretty excited about Isuna Hasekura. I'll probably end up spending quite a bit of time in the board game area again. Last year I got to play cards with the guy in charge of the Occulus demo.  I hope they announce Inferno Cop S2  <br>Fuck off, shill.</br>  I just want to see the yucky tuna panel. Maybe participate in a Hisoutensoku tourney if one if going on that day. Other wise everything else is just meh.  <br>Cosplaying is the worst.<br><br><br>Because I hate weaboos.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forget this board is filled with forever alone depressed faggots. They won't leave their rooms without having a panic attack. Also most of the people here are legit autistic, ugly, fat, and plain pathetic. As proven to me with past /a/ meetups. Inb4 autists start getting mad over the truth and calling me normie. :)</br>  Is there going to be some sort of important announcement in the event or is it all going to be overpriced merchandise, meetups, and shit cosplayers?  <br><br>You get gems like these</br></br>  <br>You can buy Japanese merchandise online now, so what's left? Autists and teenagers cosplaying and dub VAs doing panels as far as I can tell.</br>  <br>Apparently there's going to be a KISS concert.</br>  <br>AX is the biggest con in the US and they invite a shit ton of Japanese guests over.<br><br>There will be important announcements but also awful cosplays, overpriced bootlegs, bronies, underage cancer, and fedora neckbeards. And feminists and transboys with the yaoi paddles of nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>Will they be giving out traced Bleach pages?</br>  <br>Well then somebody just make a thread once the announcements happen. No need to make this shit thread if there's nobody even here to give us some eyes on the expo so we can laugh at fags.</br>  <br>I like how they are all from katawa shoujo except for that sauske faggot</br>  <br>Last time anime expo was about anime fans' initiative to show their passion. Now it is a commercial venue. They just want to steal the money from anime fans.</br>  <br>I work across the street from the convention that does Anime North. Aside from being a bunch of autists who dress up as anime unrelated whatever, this infinite mob of unwashed fatasses tend to spill over everywhere. I watched my bus driver almost run a bunch of them down because they don't know where the road begins and the sidewalk ends. Also it seems like they're all obsessed with literal kids shows (sailor moon, pokemon, yugioh, etc) which is just fucking wierd at that point in their lives.<br><br>Also there's the fact that the overpriced merch is usually garbage and who gives a fuck if the dub VAs are there. They're literal nobodies</br></br></br>  <br>No, Sasuke fits in quite well with the cast.</br>  <br>Not sure I get the reference.</br>  <br>does anybody know much money goes to the industry itself?  or is the answer just import bds and figures? </br>  I almost went to a con once. Then I immediately realized that I could be wasting my money by going to Comiket instead. So I did.  <br>Gene Simmons' son is a comic book artist who traced from Bleach.</br>  <br>Who is your employer?<br><br>Does your compensation depend on how many positive responses you gather in this thread?<br><br>Are you considered an employee, and independent contractor, or a temp?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Stop trying to fit in. That wont make you more /a/non, in fact it will make you more /a/utist.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, that. I had totally forgotten about that guy. Honestly the only connection I could think of was DMC or something.</br>  <br> going to conventions </br>  Zero Escape 3  <br>Not an anime.<br>Not a manga.<br>Sage.<br>Reported.</br></br></br></br>  <br> strong independent American women.jpg </br>  <br>You're trying too hard to fit in.</br>  <br>I'm not saying he doesn't fit in it just seems random as fuck.<br>It's like when they were planning it out<br> OK we are all going as Ks i will be kenji <br> I got Shizune <br> ooo ooo Hisao <br> Emi <br> The nurse <br> WELL I'M GOING TO BE SAUSKE GUYS! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was just trying to make a joke about him being a mentally challenged person and therefore fits well with the rest of the disabled characteersKatawas.</br>  <br>Because there's no point in going to western cons unless there's some exclusive shit there that I need to /buyfag/. Everything else, I've got the internet for.</br>  <br>I hope they released him on the way home.<br>Like just left him in a desert or a ghetto.</br></br>  id go if some of my friends were up for it but i doubt we'd all have the free time for it  <br>Fuck off, cons aren't /a/</br>  <br> and they invite a shit ton of Japanese guests over. <br>Hardly any good ones this year, though.<br> There will be important announcements <br>About the Western anime industry. Who's looking forward to hearing what's getting licensed!</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's mean. Sasuke is an extremely mentally damaged person and needs all the medical care he can get.</br>  I've got a mask for Friend from 20th Century Boys, but I don't feel like wearing a suit. So I might just be Casual Friend.  Why is it that AX is the only convention that /a/ mods allow discussion of?  <br><br>I'll be cosplaying as Kumagawa, and I've got an AMV in the contest.<br><br>Feel free to say hello if you see me around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of doubt Kumagawa to be that rare of a cosplay so that may be a bit difficult.</br>  Me and a buddy are going as mako and ryuko. I don't have a wig yet, but his just came in  <br>I dunno I think he would like it in the desert, its warm, he can make new friends who don't hate him, and he could pretend hes fighting the sand village</br>  <br><br>Actually it is. I've never seen another Kumagawa. Granted I usually only go to Sakura Con, so maybe it'll be different.</br></br>   toonami people on /co/ <br> anime expo people on /v/ <br><br>When are you gonna take responsibility for your shit /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>The only reason I go there is to pick up thirsty looking cosplay women</br>  <br> Akagi <br><br>Literally kill yourself. Even Kaga would be better.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I will be dressed as a normal normalfag and be old enough looking to pretend I'm a parent just escorting my kids to the con. Feel free to not say hi to me.</br></br></br>  <br> shitting on /v/ while defending cons <br>Go away you normie poser.</br></br>  <br>Fella at a swap meet gave it to me for free with a keychain</br>  <br>I guess I'll just high five every kumagawa I see then.</br>  <br> cartoon network circlejerking <br>Not anime or manga.<br> normalfag conventions in some non-nipponese shithole <br/></br></br></br>  If I wanted to hang out with a bunch of autistic weeaboos, I'd sit between two mirrors.  <br>You must be great at parties.</br>  <br>Because why do that when you could watch Ryu and Michelle spill spaghetti around each other?<br>Oh wait. Fuck what happened to that i miss watching nico nico streams of anime expo with /a/.</br></br>  I wish I could go. I live in Oklahoma though and I'm not paying for a plane ticket on top of hotel/pass. Plus I have no weeb friends.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=f_G<wbr>ruNNmbKM</wbr>  [ ]<br>NORMIE GET OUT REEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br>  <br>Did you just wander in from facebook? <br><br>That's got to be the most trite "you're a loser" put-down ever. At least pretend that you spend time here and call him autistic or something.</br></br></br>  <br>You got me with that.</br>  <br> him </br>  I've been to an asian convention before for some official event-only figmas. Far superior to the western ones, that's for sure.  This thread is awful.<br>All the casual scum that shit up this board, in one place, talking about their shitty little friends.<br><br>Why is this allowed? There is a board dedicated to your "nuuurdy" dress-up games.</br></br></br>  <br>Please don't bully yourself.</br>  <br>Sure you have.</br>  <br>Oh for Christ's sake, just fuck off.</br>  <br>So true</br>  <br>You mean the same board that hosts Naruto generals?</br>  <br>Depression aside<br> I've never been to an /a/ meet <br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br> :) <br>No, you're just a crossboarder and your opinion isn't worth half a shit.</br></br>  <br>While I hate cosplayers and shit as much as everyone else the /a/ threads for the nico nico streams where 10/10. I mean there are people on here who dont know about Ryu and the french autismo master yellow flag guy.</br>  <br>Just try to stop me. I'm bullying myself and there's nothing you can do about it.</br>  <br>Those threads are the mods' new favorite baby.</br>  Just going with some friends, probably will be hanging around alot just taking occasional pictures with near naked cosplayers for the fuck of it.  <br>This, tbh.</br>  <br>Huh?</br>  <br>Nobody cares.</br>  <br>Aw, does it hurt your fee fees?<br><br><br>Retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry man, I just thought that OP and other guys going to the con would care, not an autistic fuck like you :^)</br>   blogshit: the thread <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>That doesn't look like it's in Japan. Therefore, it's irrelevant and offtopic.<br><br>Fuck off /v/ shitposters, stop filling the thread with your memes.</br></br></br>  Funny how the people defending this thread all use shitposting and emoticons.<br><br>It's almost like they don't belong here.</br></br>  <br>I once had fun watching some animu movies with /a/nons and  playing mh4u </br>  Eh whatever I'm going there to get autographs from ufotable staff and Kawasumi. <br><br>Fuck you all, I'm going to cosplay.</br></br>  <br>No, seriously, what are you talking about? You just randomly greentexted him. <br><br>Are you , and saying that you're a girl (for absolutely no reason)?</br></br></br>  <br> going to <br> not just watching a stream <br>We had fun once.<br>Regardless, good times are dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>I'm bringing my copy of MH4U, but I haven't played in a long time so no one is going to want to play with me.</br>  <br>Who will you cosplay as ?</br>  <br>Lurk more.</br>  <br> him <br><br>Take a deep breath and re-read the posts, idiot.</br></br></br>  2 and a half hours left.  Ruri~  0 hours left, mono's pc case is broke    <br>I always wondered why black people fucking love anime, jrpgs, yugioh, and fighting games.</br>  Clear-Eyes when?  <br>cause they have nerds too?<br> inb4 niggers ain't ppl </br></br>    <br>Nah man, they fucking love that shit, especially fighting games and yugioh, it's just odd. Why those two things?</br>  <br>Black people love YGO and DBZ and Digimon because they were the poor-man's entertainment back in the late 90s / early 00s, prior to cable and satellite television becoming much more affordable for the poor. I would know, I was a gigantic poorfag who kept getting Pokemon games a generation behind.</br>  <br>they tend to have a really big split in their pop culture though. Half of it is the chill pop/soft drink stuff and the other half is the gangster culture. I guess their chill culture allows it to be more open minded to games, probably cause DM was such a hit on tv.</br>  Are we watching on the dolphin today?  <br>Fair enough I guess, though I loved all of those and I wasn't poor. <br><br>True, but I've seen some thug ass black dudes at yugioh tournaments. I'm not talking about chill nice bro black dudes, I'm talking straight up compton mothafuckas. A lot different than MTG tournaments were I see a few normal dudes, but mostly scrawny white kids and pretentious fatasses.</br></br></br>  <br>i want to fuck yuuya~</br>  <br>Yuzu stop it</br>  <br><br>I think it also has to do that while pokemon and yugioh and shit were poorfag friendly they also got a big chunk of the more rich people. That bridge might also be why there is more black people in these area's.<br><br>Unrelated all the black people at my locals are fucking pro at spending money on trading cards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br> Unrelated all the black people at my locals are fucking pro at spending money on trading cards. <br><br>Same here, they're fun to play with though. We have this one black guy at our locals that straight up acts like he's out of the anime, he gets hyped as shit every time he duels. It's pretty entertaining.</br></br></br>  <br>Black nerds are some of the best nerds because they aren't afraid to become physical, which makes nerd-arguments that much more tense and engaging. One of my black friends nearly went apeshit on a scrawny white kid because the white claimed Batman was the best DC superhero, and the black kept providing evidence and arguments about how Wally West Flash is the best DC superhero.<br><br>Needless to say I like the Scarlet Speedster a helluva lot more now.</br></br></br>  How do we make Crow egao?  <br>food</br>  <br>Gib fud.</br>  <br>Have him duel Mitchio.</br>  <br>Black people have no stigma on being fucking pissed which is kinda cool. Also to add to the being cool factor the black guy at my locals plays dedicated Hero's cause he likes Marvel/DC and cause of Jaden.</br>  <br>Why is Yuya giving him a card? Or is he giving Yuya a card?</br>  <br>I love the fact that for as limited/short as GX Abridged was it's somehow set up this stigma of Judai being a wigger.</br>  <br> BUY BLACKWINGS, Yuya. <br>He gives him a tuner monster to be revealed at his fight against Jack.</br></br>  <br>I really liked the Abridged even if just for that.</br>  <br>watch it somehow be a new sub-performapal/sub odd-eyes archtype in the making.</br>  <br>Same, I wish he was actually like that.</br>  <br> Odd-Eyes Blackwing Pendulum Dragon <br> This is Yuya's Synchro instead of Clear Wing </br></br>  <br> he won't eat Yugo at all <br> they become buds <br> Yuya gets his synchro from Yugo teaching him <br><br> &gt;and zuzu gets shays xyz teachings like the boards fortold </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The actual quality of this episode is looking great so far. Ebina should be in charge of every episode.</br>  <br>If it were possible to only have to hire and pay one animation director and one writer, they'd do it.<br><br>At this point I'm simply thankful for when an episode is at least ok in animation quality that it isn't distracting, and extra grateful if it manages to look pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>A better name would be Black-Winged Pendulum Dragon, to follow suit with Rune-Eyes and Beast-Eyes' naming schemes.</br>  <br>Actually yeah Blackwing(ed) Pendulum Dragon would also be a good opposite to Clear Wing Synchro Dragon too.</br>  <br><br> this might actually be a thing </br></br>  <br>Either way, all Yuya needs for a Synchro is to bond with a synchro native, doesn't matter who. And sharing cards is basically giving him a summon method STD like with Sora, Yuzu, and poly.</br>  <br>If it doesn't I'll honestly be surprised. I just don't see Yugo getting eaten by Yuya, maybe Yuri, but not Yuya.</br>  <br>I want it to be Yuri. 3 vs 1 dragon fight later down the line just doesn't hold a lot of tension even if Yuri is only 2nd to Leo in Academia.</br>  Of fuck I just realized 'Ray' and 'Vector' are both geometry terms.  <br>Either way I don't see Yuri taking Clear Wing for himself, chances are he'd just rip it in half or take it with him to throw in Rin's face.</br>  <br>How's sixth grade?</br>  <br> Yuya vs. Yuri. <br> Yuya has all three Odd-Eyes, Dark Rebellion and Clear Wing on the field. <br> Yuri's in a pinch. <br> Top decks Super Poly and fuses them all with his Fusion Dragon. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't be mean anon, some people didn't noticed all the references to Opera and Biology in the second half of 5Ds after all.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cWF<wbr>3JD11LCE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  d2 is out<br>fat is dutch</br>  <br> Yuri Super-Poly's a retrained FGD </br>  I found Ruri.  <br>Which just means Yuya's getting Clear Wing</br>  Any stream link guys?  <br>Ruri best imouto.</br>  <br>What if Ruri is Shun's older sister and she just happens to look like a 14 year old girl and all the Ruris are her daughters...oh shit.</br>  <br>Dude, Yuri will get Clear Wing</br>  <br>Not necessarily. <br><br>I doubt he'd use it.

Also, why did the author feel like continuing this story?</br>  <br>Monster girl thread ?</br>  <br>Who knows, maybe there is hammerspace in the shed, and she lives in her own little dimension. Maybe they'll leave for the mountains. <br>And the story was pretty popular, so of course the author would make a sequel. I'm certainly not complaining.</br></br>  <br><br>moths don't raise their kids, she also seems like she would be jealous of any attention he would give to their children instead of her</br></br>  <br>someone commissioned him to do a part two.</br>  <br>No, neither am I it's just most of the hentai I read seldom receive sequels so I'm actually pretty happy about this one.

What's it called bruh? Drunken tineye/Google is failing.</br>  <br>Just for your terminology, i've decided not to help you.

Go get some fresh air.</br>  <br>Literally search "Yandere moth girl"</br>   There will never be good doujinshi where monstergirls and rape are involved were one party is completely unwilling through the whole event. <br>God damn casuals ruin everything.</br>  <br>Damn, I hope you guys have a nice life together. Mad respect.</br>    <br> thanks anon </br>  what the fuck is the deal with this fucking family?<br><br>did I miss a season where they explained why the Yukinoshita family is so fucking strange and horrible?</br></br>  <br>That is only a part of it.<br>Hayama also chose Haruno. <br>Haruno saw 8man and Yui together and made that remark of Yukino not chosen again.<br>It was an obvious remark inferring to a love triangle.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Atleast what I could gather from vol10:<br><br> lots of girls likes Hayama <br> Hayama is friends with Yukino <br> girls thinking Hayama and Yukino has a thing <br> girls bully Yukino <br> Hayama can't standup for her because "lol I can't get angry with anyone" <br> both go their separate ways </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't get how people see the club drama as a love triangle to win 8manbowl. It clearly used as way to lure Yukino out of her shell and being true to herself and for the club to see what is actually genuine for their relatioship. The romance or thing about winning 8manbowl anyone still has chance, it is not like 8man admits he likes someone so far.  <br>Slight correction to the first part, Yukino was good at hiding it until 8man and Yui in their quest for "genuine" dragged all of Yukino's issues out of her.<br><br>Yukino's basically a statement of how "genuine" doesn't always mean good things. There are a lot of people who have a lot of shit going on internally that they never let see the light of day.</br></br></br>  <br> it's inevitable that they will have to address them, and when that happens there's no chance 8man will come out of it a single man. <br>What if 8man doesn't love any of them romantically?</br></br>   ayane sakura talked to boys a total of 3 times in high school <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p-f<wbr>JxDqDXSw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>is this even possible? goddammit japan</br></br></br>  <br> is this even possible? <br>Possible?

All of them. They're all fucking their producers and directors and voice actors on the side as well.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Don't be naïve.</br>  <br>S-So does this mean that Sugita is fucking pretty women too? If so then I am happy for him.</br>  <br>What a slut.</br>  <br><br>Is it possible? Yes.<br>Is it true in this case? Who gives a fuck.</br></br></br>  what the fuck happened to animage?  <br>His cabal got sundered.</br>  <br>Shut up antimage.</br>  <br> some seiyuu lie to appeal to otaku <br>True.<br> they are having gang-bangs every day with their producers and every staff member <br>Stupid /v/ tier generalization.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course not. Retarded otaku support seiyuus by buying their shitty music and chinese cartoon cds. This is contingent on the fact that these women portraying their waifus are as pure as the waifu since it's the closest they can get to them in "real life" They must maintain the image of purity at all costs. <br><br>In reality, Sakura has probably talked to many men, and sucked and fucked many dicks to get where she is today.</br></br></br>  I takes an expert koebuta to distinguish the pure seiyuus from the ones that just pretend to be lonely to pander to Otaku.

All of these cute dykes are going to waste away without ever experiencing love.</br>  Who is the fluffiest seiyuu and why is it Eri Inagawa?  <br>Yes.

You can't forget the painful moments of the past, they're just as important as the joyful ones.</br>  <br>Well, you're right about that and I can't argue with that, but you should just try not to think about it, its not really a fun thing to recall and talk about.<br><br>Its better to talk about how weird Nana can be at times than thinking how she felt when she was sexually harassed.</br></br></br>  <br>Back to Touyama Nao…<br><br>Sakura: The other day we went out to eat together!<br>Tone: Just you two?<br>Sakura: Yep, after a recording.

Please tell more<br>Sakura: Mmm yeah.<br>Tone: She told you that she said this on radio?<br>Sakura: Nope.

Err… H-How– W-What kind of relationship do you two have??<br>Sakura: Eh?<br>Tone: What kind of relationship?<br>Sakura: Ehehe you wanna know?<br>Tone: Yes! Very much!<br>*They both laugh*<br>Sakura: Well when we meet we hug each other, when we eat out together we talk about how much we love each other. That kind of relationship.<br>Tone: “Talk about how much we love each other”?? *laughs* You mean like “I like thiiis part of you Nao-chan~” “No I like thiiis about youuu”<br>Sakura: We don’t do that kind of annoying stuff…<br>Tone: Ah, sorry sorry.<br>*They both laugh*<br>Sakura: But when I’m with her I get a really warm feeling from her! Just by being near her I feel so warm and fuzzy~<br>Tone: Then you should do your favourite yuri thing.

She's like Kaneda Tomoko 2.0</br>  <br>I fucking hate her grating voice.</br>  Oh. the times where Nana`s face doesn't need fucktons of editing.  <br>Yes, I think seiyuu agencies are trying to one-upped the others in the crazy department.<br>They're keep looking for some socilly-inept, batshit insane ladies to be hired as seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>How many currently exist?</br>  Anyone have that interview where Ayane talks about her obsession with KanaHana?  <br>, <br>Some are not as crazy/weird as Yuu/Rie/Yuuri, but still showing some degree of quirkiness.<br>Like Asakura Momo, for example. Kind of makes sense, since anime fandom is basically where all the weirdos gathering.

He already said in the past that it gets tough when the guest is a female (ie. 3:1), but Fujita Saki was too much for him. <br>Hopefully there will be at least one other male guest at BuruFes...</br>  <br> Fujita and Imai <br>Yeah that is a problem alright.</br></br>  <br>From what I've seen in  what is translated  Tokyo encounter episodes, Sugita acts differently when the guest is a woman. Though he seemed pretty enthusiastic in the Sumire Uesaka episode.</br>  <br> Though he seemed pretty enthusiastic in the Sumire Uesaka episode. <br>Yeah, that's because he was able to bully Sumire and she just willingly took it.</br></br>  <br>It depends on the woman. If they are people whom Sugita has worked with in the past and/or who are into anime/manga/games (eg. Isocchi, Imajin, Ueda Kana, SatoRina, Chiaking etc), he can go wild. Even when the guest is a an older woman (eg. Inoue Kikuko, Tanaka Atsuko, Iwao Junko etc), he can go at a relaxed pace. <br>The problem is when it's someone who isn't that much into 2D and/or goes full "girl's talk" with other female that it becomes a problem. <br><br>Uesaka had been on Anigera (Sugita's radio) already and she is a big fan of Votoms, so Sugita has no problems with her (or to be more exact, he likes her).</br></br></br></br>  <br>She can't do anything to stop it anyway</br>  My Seifu  I'm still mad she's not Alice  Is this an Imagine thread?  <br><br>That is a weird way to spell best girl.</br></br>  <br>New main roles fucking where?</br>    <br>Change the actress name and write '' young girl" in place of "girl" and this chart can also apply to her</br>    <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mW-<wbr>JAiZcGbU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br><br>stop pushing Taneda Risa or /a/ will think she's overrated.</br></br></br>    Why are you fags such sad cases?  <br>She's actually underrated though.</br>  It's almost July now.  <br> &gt;Satomi Akesaka <br><br>I want to marry Meruru-chan</br></br></br>  <br>It's just an observation ok.</br>  Is Sugita still bald?  <br>Muv Luv killed her career.

Proof.  <br>Is this an idol video, or she's lost her virginity? If the latter, good for Gokai Yellow.</br>  <br>She was chubby in her childhood.</br>  Doffy Nico for your heart!  Anyone else want God Usopp's bounty to go up by an unprecedented amount? Maybe from $30 million to $300 million? It might happening when hundreds of former pirates and other ne'er-do-wells leave Dressorsa spreading word of how Usopp broke the Hobby curse and how they revere him as a messiah.<br><br>Not to mention having Usopp's bounty the 2nd highest in the crew is like poetry.</br></br>  <br>Usopp is the best crewmember, so yes</br>  <br>He lost so quickly it's unreasonable or should I say unbelievable. When I was reading the chapter there was no sense of "OMFG!" it was just an "eh? Oh Doffy's lost oh well" I'm not even hype for the future arcs after this bullshit. This really is a poor man's alabasta arc.<br><br>I wish Oda stopped dickriding the chapters. had he just fused the final chapters together it wouldn't have been so bad. Oda's losing his fucking edge.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, 100m is the most likely. I think Usopp might be getting Luffy's previous bounties. Completely baseless, yea, but hey.</br>  Aokiji was haki stabbed by Shirohige, Akainu was haki sliced by Marco and Vista, Crocodile was (haki?) decapitated by Doflamingo.<br>How come they survived that? Can haki users with logia powers block haki attacks or something?</br>  <br>They changed shape so the attack didn't hit them. Crocodile was clearly not Haki decapitated. Aokiji literally does this like the next page after he gets stabbed.</br>  What powers will kaido have?<br><br>I'm betting on one of the following<br><br> Typhon Mystical Zoan <br> Hydra Mystical Zoan <br> Sabre tooth tiger Zoan <br> Blood Logia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A plain ol' Lion Zoan. King of the Beasts, motherfucker. Enies Lobby 2.0 with Chopper Rescue Plot incoming.</br>  <br>Quickly? Lmfao.<br><br>I was honestly getting bored with this prolonged arc. A one on one fight should in my opinion not take several weeks.<br><br>Not that realism and manga go hand in hand, but a one on one fight where both opponents are like fucking gods and it just never ends are really boring.<br><br>I think the reason series like Naruto and Bleach always turn to shit in the end is just that. The ridiculous power ups they always get. Shit becomes really boring when that last drop of realism gets thrown out the window.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then why don't they do that all the time when they get injured? Aokiji lost a leg for fuck's sake.<br><br>If they can just change shape to evade the haki attack, then what's the point of haki attacks? They were brought up especially so that a normal human being could defeat logia users.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because they can't ? They fought for 10 fucking days, dude. Both of them were heavily injured. You think Aokiji is going to be on tip top shape on Day 9th when Akainu was throwing a fucking Magma rock at him ? Hell no. The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel''</br>  <br>God Mystical Zoan. Or devil.<br><br>Probably not, it will be some generic albeit strong animal. But I want Oda to go all out here.</br></br></br>  <br> The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel'' <br>That was literally what it was brought up for in the first place though. And anyway, the fact remains that a haki user can hit logia users, and that rule simply did not seem to apply when Aokiji got stabbed.</br></br>  If Doflamingo could make clones of himself, why didn't he get more outlandish and just copied himself exactly to the detail? Why not go full Bayonetta and create some weird string beasts?  <br>Because Aokiji didn't get hit. It's that simple. The attack simply didn't hit him. You could say he just dodged. It's not that hard to understand. And iirc, CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia.</br>  Does anyone know what kind of island Zou is? Sounds like it would be related to wano/Kano  <br>Haki showed up in the literal first chapter.</br>  <br>Probably because it would be very weird. And Doffy could probably only make some Flamingo's which would have made Luffy lose his shit.</br>  <br>Hmm, in that case I find it weird that Aokiji looked so shocked when being stabbed.<br>Also, Rayleigh could stop Kizaru with a strike of his sword, wouldn't Kizaru possibly be able to dodge it the same way?<br>Then again he did not get hurt by that. Also, Marco sent him flying with a kick, so Kizaru probably just isn't that good at dodging things? Or does not care because he is Kizaru.<br><br> CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia. <br>Same difference. It circumvented a devil fruit power to hit the user.<br><br><br>But it was not adressed by name and described expositionally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People speculate that it is the Korea to Kano's Japan.</br>  <br>King of Beasts fruit.</br>  <br>Big Dick 90inch Mystical Zoan, I'm calling it right now.</br>  <br>Remember when people thought Akainu had blood logia? good times</br>  <br>LMFAO</br>  <br>Black person zoan. Luffy will have to play basketball against him for the title of Yonko. When Kaido reveals his awakened zoan he turns into Shaqaido o'Neal and is like 20 feet tall. To keep up, Luffy will perform a full body gear 3, and also get back his afro power from the Foxy boxing fight.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Pl<wbr>wOe6WKz4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Aokiji just looks serious. Not shocked whatsoever. Kizaru is a lazy shit and you know it. And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. And Rayleigh kept up with a fucking Light dude. That could be also a clue. <br><br>And it still hits Devil Fruit users. You just have to not be a scrub. Which Luffy won't be when he fights Akainu.</br></br></br></br></br>  quote me on this one<br><br>its going to be a monkey zoan</br></br>  <br>quoted <br><br>ayyyyoooo lmaoooo</br></br></br>  <br>Mythical King Kong Zoan who gets taken out by Luffy's Gear 5 "King Kong Jet Pistole Pasta Machine"</br>  <br>kek'd</br>  <br>I can see this happening in Gintama very soon.</br>  <br>I think he looked shocked, but fair point. It just seems like a minor inconsistency to me, but I can write it off as "haki raises your chances against logia types" rather than seeing as like "haki always beats logia".<br><br> And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. <br>Well, he's been a marine for the same amount of time and was known as a "monster" back then aswell. So I just jumped to that conclusion.<br><br>Also, I find it kinda sad that we probably won't ever have a marine as strong as the red-yellow-blue admirals with Shengoku on top. Fujitora apparently is much weaker than the other admirals (though obviously he has still time to prove himself) and I don't have really high hopes for green bull (will he maybe be a zoan user? we don't really have any zoan marines other than The Buddha).<br>It feels like Luffy will never defeat the marines at the zenit of their power, even if he beats Akainu at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do you best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>We don't even know if they both had fruits back then. And if we're going by the movie info, Zephyr says that Kizaru relies on his fruit too much so we can assume that he is a cocky prick that won't think about dodging that much. And Rokugyu and Fujitora has been called ''Monsters'' too.</br>  <br>But Fujitora seems so much weaker than the previous admirals. It would seem unreasonable that the marines could simply replace their strongest forces that were intact for the decades without a drop in power - though obviously possible.</br>  <br>Ayy</br>  Damn, I keep forgetting how few logia users there actually are. Seems like so many more because Smoker was introduced early, but many that seem to be logias from memory are just logiaesk paramecias, like Mr. 3, Jozu or Magellan.<br>It feels like thee are more characters that have conqueror's haki than logia powers (though that obviously is not true.)</br>  <br>An actual high bounty's capabilities horrified Usopp. He's not there yet.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=egJ<wbr>_tcZC0Ek</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>I wouldn't bet against Oda just yet, we've seen the extend of the Marines but not of the World Government. <br><br>We know for sure a new generation of Pacifista is coming, no clue what Vegapunk is up to, CP0 has been on the sidelines.

People who have eaten a Devil Fruit are "hated" by the sea, and cannot swim. The "sea" here can refer to anything from rivers, pools and baths to any kind of standing water. On a worldwide level, they are all the "sea." When these people enter the water, not only can they not use their powers, they have trouble moving their bodies at all. They might be able to struggle a bit, but it wouldn't do much good. That's if their entire bodies are submerged in the "sea." With less than half the body or just the limbs, it gets easier. Also, rain and dripping water have no effect at all. Therefore, hip baths or showers are the most common choice. Now, in Crocodile's case, "water" is the weakness of his very powers, so his abilities are robbed even in the shower. But it's not like there are enemies around when you take a shower, so I'd bet he would take them even with his powers being blocked. Don't you think? ---And to answer your final question, about myself bathing. As it happens, I do bathe. Twice! In a year! </br></br></br>  <br>You could easily rape crocodile while he's taking a shower</br>  <br>So let me get this straight. So if you want your kid to be strong, determined, and successful, all you have to do is make his middle initial D? Why isn't everyone a D then?</br>  <br>it is not the name, it is the bloodline</br>  <br>Because not everyone believes in that superstition.</br>  &lt;- who knew?  <br>If I ever have a kid his middle name will be D</br>  <br> opmemes.com </br>  <br> Shotamingo has an adorable girl voice <br><br>Nice<br>Now why couldn't they do that with Law?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaidou is Kaku with his awakened Giraffe Zoan, which turns him into a Kirin. <br><br>On a more serious note, I'm expecting one of the following<br><br> Mystical/Ancient Zoan <br> Godzilla Zoan <br> Lion Zoan <br> Something that seems dumb like a Flea Zoan or a Tardigrade Zoan that is actually retardedly powerful <br> Paramecia that lets him summon animals rather than become them <br> Something that lets him turn into any animal and mix and match them (Something like Ultimate Kars) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Griffin Zoan</br>  <br>You're not serious right?

His proportions definitely changed though. He's softer-looking since the skip</br>  <br>Chinjao and Garp had a fucking clash of conquers haki you speed reading normie</br>  <br>No they fucking didn't, show me the page. We've seen armament haki clashes look the same with sparks everywhere as well.</br>  <br>What? Did you even read the first half of the series? Luffy looked goofy as fuck up until Water 7. After time skip his upper body looks a little wider, too.</br>  <br><br>First they need to find out who is giving them a ride to wherever they're going because they sure as shit arent getting there on the Sunny</br></br>  <br>that's what im sayng you dip<br><br>he doesnt look the same as he did for the TS. He's younger looking</br></br></br>    <br>is Law's arm on backwards?</br>  <br>Fujitora seems to have gotten his fruit recently going by his words, maybe he'll get stronger.</br>  <br>What the fuck are you saying? Widening of the upper body makes a guy look older. Oda even gave size changes in an SBS and Luffy grew like 5 inches or something. I don't see how you can think he looks younger</br>  A episode worth watching next week  <br>The current group is Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Robin, Franky, Law, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro, can Luffy fit two 9 feet giants on his back.</br>  <br>I already said his eyes are bigger. It's his face that looks younger not his body</br>  <br>Luffy only grew two centimeters, that's like one inch.</br>  <br>Aw Yeh<br><br>It's about damn time<br><br>though the.. makeup looks off? Why are all the lines so thin?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And he can already pull meteors down from space? That would be impressive.</br>  <br>Corazon looks off in those shots, I can't describe it, maybe the shape of his chin is wrong?</br>  <br>His lips aren't as lush</br>  <br><br>It's a shame because he looked nice when one of the show's animation directors drew him for fun on twitter.<br><br>Hope Toei gets their shit together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe no one is putting your dumb ass in place <br><br>http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece<wbr>/716/19</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Damn shame</br></br></br>  It was just like yesterday when people actually thought kyros killed doffy  <br>he was mistaken in the type, dont be so quick to judge im sure youve done the same</br>  <br>good luck getting his hook out of your asshole</br>  <br> http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piec<wbr>e/716/19</wbr> <br> mangapanda <br> confirmed for casual <br>that doesnt look like garp to me you dumbass</br></br></br></br>  <br>Implying that's a bad thing</br>  Cora-san  ;_;   <br>fucking christ<br><br>just once. Could you not?</br></br></br>  <br>Its the exact thing from chinjaos flash back you absolute shitter</br>  <br>good job not proving your point you filthy casual, go back to mangapanda forums</br>  <br>that was a clash of Armament Haki not Conq<br><br>Garp may have Conquerors but he has yet to actually show it off if he does</br></br></br>  I just wanna  fuck  doffy    <br> Homing and Mini Dofla get VAs that sound good but have been in like 3 shows  <br><br>Fingers still crossed for OnoD+Kamiyan power duo</br></br></br>  <br>How fucking dense are you</br>  <br> that hairline <br><br>you dont have a less shit picture?</br></br></br>  <br><br>pied piper paramecia<br><br>he can control animals using his power</br></br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  Post yfw reading the Señor Pink flashback  <br>I dont care about autistic baby man so</br>  <br> "I...I work at the bank." <br><br>He deserves his own manga.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Muh dick</br></br>    <br>and i just went back and read through marineford, nowhere does iva mention dragon having it either, its more like "so he has it, dragon"</br>  <br>holy shit you are dumb. I'm not that anon, but just accept the fact that Garp hasn't shown CoC and move on. Later if or when he does you can shove it in everyone's face, but for now you're wrong.</br>  <br>being a femDoffy fan must be suffering</br>  <br>Shen long mythical zoan is for Dragon</br>  <br>I hope he gets a happy ending.</br>  Doflanon I hope you're well  <br>The gays are here</br>  <br>Well, you're in the thread</br>  <br><br>He should appear at the end of One Piece sharing a cola with Franky.</br></br>  <br>No it wasn't clash of coc you tool</br>  <br>Nah, I mean, like, a happy cover story or something like that.<br><br>More likely we'll get a cover of him visiting his wife and child's graves though.</br></br></br>   This nigger could open a door to another dimension separate from the current one and travel between planes <br><br>There's no way this guy wasn't an awakened user, that sounds OP as shit.</br></br>  <br>I think that's just what it does. It just happens to be really OP.<br><br>Though to be fair, it couldn't be much help in a fight outside of the way he was already using it</br></br></br>  <br>Just got back<br><br>After all this arguing you link a fucking mangapanda page, and you're the on calling others a casual...<br><br>Not only that but you didn't even link the correct page, where Garp and Chinjao clash.</br></br></br></br></br>  r/ing this picture with a sillhouetted happy rocinante  <br>Gedatsu got a happy ending, and Pink has been a lot nicer than him, so you never know.</br>  Are you looking forward to Brook and Kin'emon's brotastic adventure in Wano?  <br>Still good enough to help his allies escape a buster call alive and transport to a new city, give it to a competent enough pirate and he could door-spam through New World all the way to Raftel.</br>  <br>You just know Zoro and the three samurai plus Momonosuke will hog all the attention, Brook will once again get shunted.</br>  Nami literally only has 5% of her body covered at this point  I don't know why you fags read the manga when the anime is so quality. I mean check out this shot from the upcoming flashback sequence. Can you say CHARACTER INTRO?!  <br>Yes, Ace had it, but he never trained it.</br>  <br> tfw Kinemon/Doffy/Hack confirmed for forming an adorable old man trio <br><br>Do you guys think the seiyuu get embarrassed/saddened by the shitty quality of the current anime or are they just happy to be there</br></br></br>  <br>Right but I'm arguing that luffy and Garp had the same result from clashing with chin, and manga panda is just the go to proof website because it's faster then ms . Tk</br>  <br>I think I'm going to barf</br>  Shota Doffy's speech quirk is so cute. <br>Shota Doffy &gt; Shota Law.</br>  <br>That doesn't mean that it was conquerors haki, it could just be their strength. When two conquerors haki user clash the only lasting affect is shockwaves and I'll list the examples:<br><br>Whitebeard vs Shanks = split the sky<br>Luffy vs Chinjao = shockwaves push people out of the coliseum<br>Luffy vs Doffy = shockwaves pushes Laws body away from danger</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This so much.</br></br>  <br>If i had to choose one of the two shotas to pat on the head and tell everything will be alright<br><br>I'd choose law</br></br></br>  After Kaidou is defeated, how much of the series would be left.  <br> Expecting realism in shonen </br>  <br>To be fair I'm pretty sure this is meant to be from Law's perspective (looking up at the building from the trash heap) but yeah the arms look weird.<br><br>Also:<br> yesterday Luffy's VA uploaded a photo to her blog with Usopp and Bellamy's VAs plus a random Yamadera Kouichi and vaguely said she met him at a "strange place" <br><br>What the fuck, is Corazon going to be Spike?<br>I can't read all the moon accompanying the picture.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so does chopper</br>  <br> One Piece seiyuu comment board with the multicolored magnets on the table <br><br>Confirmed</br></br></br>  <br>depends how far away kaidou is; oda confirmed time skip was halfway point so just multiply chapters times two and you have a rough estimate of chapters left</br>  <br>I honestly can't imagine that<br><br>There is so much fucking lore and subplots that hasn't even begun to be explained yet and the coming islands of Zou, Wano and probably Elbaf don't look like they'll answer any of them<br><br>Navy Admirals<br>Big Mom<br>Kaido<br>Blackbeard<br>Revolutionary Army<br>The big black ball that swallowed up Capone<br>Captain Kidd<br>X Drake<br>Whatever the fuck Kuzan's is doing<br>Whatever the fuck CP9 is going<br>Whatever the fuck CP0 and the WG are doing<br>The Gorosei<br>Rio Poneglyph<br>Joy Boy<br>All Blue<br>Mihawk<br>Actually finding the fucking one piece<br>Buggy<br>D. vs World Government<br>100 Year Void<br>Eneru and whatever it is he found in space<br>Vegapunk and whatever his deal is<br>The next Reverie<br>The third Superweapon<br>The Superweapons significance at all<br>Awakenings<br><br>Feel free to add</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn she old<br><br>Well I guess it's to be expected, she's been voicing Luffy for, what is it, 16 years?</br></br></br>  <br>The promise Noah was built for<br><br>Also the war Whitebeard said will result from finding One Piece.</br></br></br>  <br>yea i feel you, but imagine how fast these things were thrown on us, im sure a lot of the stuff is connected and will end up getting revealed/explained at the same time</br>  <br> she's 60 <br> average Japanese female life expectancy is 87 <br><br>Is she gonna finish One Piece? She probably won't wanna voice Luffy on her deathbed</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tanaka and Masako Nozawa are voice immortals</br>  <br>They're among friends, and since so many of them are old, I bet they've known each other for decades, so it's probably enjoyable.</br>  <br>He has said he was halfway done since 2007, I wouldn't trust his time estimates, we might still have twenty years to go.</br>  <br>Coby was introduced in the second chapter, and Oda's been progressing him along ever since, he's going to play a huge role eventually, but we still have no idea what could happen with his development.</br>  What kind of animal on Rokushiki island needed to get hit by this fucking attack in order for it to be killed?  <br>Wouldn't be hilarious if the creature was just a baby of it's kind?</br>  <br>*Rusukaina Meant to put that</br>  Are you ready?  <br>prove it</br>  <br> implying Kaidou isnt a giant tiger/Nue </br>  <br>Because Oda already had trouble defeating him the way he was. If he would have acted logically then he would have been forced to bring in even more help. As it stands, Luffy needs handholding from an entire island to beat a Doflamingo who was suffering from speed AIDS.<br><br>If he had exploited the puppets, like using them to go after innocent people etc then how should Luffy have beated than one? He didnt even manage to beat this version of him without people literally shielding him with their lives.</br></br></br>  <br>Godzilla maybe.</br>  <br><br>Because he could not do any of that shit, is this really hard for some people around here or something? Doffy did what he could and fought with the best he had, the rest is mere fanfiction.</br></br>  <br>Vergo and Sanji got the same sparks as Garp vs Chinjao, and Vergo didn't even use CoA, a proper CoC clash seems to be defined by the range of the thunder like effect.</br>  <br>Yeah, the CoC clash sparks were noticably longer and thinner and coloured more dark.</br>  /r/ing the image comparing naruto, bleach, and one piece across the years    <br>love how the fist homing in to hit its target is now canon</br>  <br> Shota Doffy has a cute voice but is a psychotic murderer <br> Shota Law has a 40 year old Kamiyan voice but is a blushing tsundere <br><br>Gotta go with the one least likely to decapitate me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Could he open the gate of Babylon?</br>  <br>what a wasted fruit</br>  <br>I wonder how Ohtani and the others feel about their several year long vacations.</br>  Toei will rape this scene<br><br>We can only hope they allocate their one good animator to the scene</br></br>  <br> Funimation makes Doffy Canadian </br>  <br> I wonder how Ohtani and the others feel about their several year long vacations. <br>Zoro and Chopper were actually in Kekkai Sensen though I think the latter was only a small part, and she's still Pikachu. I know Sanji and Brook still get work, Cho was in Jojo.<br><br>I have not seen Nami in absolutely fucking anything other than One Piece since Noein.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Noein <br>Wasn't that over a decade ago?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Actually I just remembered her in FMA:B and Kuragehime too.<br><br> I don't watch much. </br></br></br>  <br>they voice characters for other shows, i.e. sanji in keksen, zoro in gintama etc.</br>  <br>I'm sorry, I just meant from One Piece, the cast as a whole seem so close, I was just wondering whether they feel annoyed that they won't be doing anything with them for years.</br>  The episode today was trash. Even the Luffy vs Doffy bits seemed cool at first but after watching them the animation is absolutely atrocious. Toe step up your fucking game.  <br> I'm sorry, I just meant from One Piece, the cast as a whole seem so close <br>I dunno bro<br><br>I'm pretty sure they hang out outside of the recording studio sometimes?</br></br></br></br>  Oda needs to hurry up and write someone with a mind control or hypnosis fruit to satisfy my sexual fetishes. It's his responsibility.  <br>There's a picture of a whole bunch of VA's and their favourite roles and the roles they got famous for are listed next to them. Takai's famous role is Zoro, but his favourite is Hijikata from Gintama, likewise with all the other Gintama seiyuus, apparently they hang out as friends as well, so you never know.</br>  Sorry if this is a silly question, but why did it matter to Law that Doffy used lead bullets?  <br>Because of the amber lead that poisoned Law's homeland and himself, it's just more insulting.</br>    <br>I see. I thought there was some sort of other underlying meaning I missed.<br><br>Thank you, anon!</br></br></br>  <br>Dude</br>  <br>The number of doujins and fanfictions that came out from this episode.........................</br>  <br> ......................... </br>  <br>Even though that would be the best solution, either they will be given a boat or Kanjuro will draw them a crappy one.</br>  <br>i like luffyko in laws crew doujins.</br>  <br> Kanjuro will draw them a crappy one <br><br>Holy hell I want this to happen like even just an attempt. Just to see Law's/Zoro's/Usopp's reactions!</br></br></br>  <br> Kanjuro will draw them a crappy one. <br><br>Setting aside that DF powers won't even work in water, how long do you suppose a paper boat will last on the sea before they all drown?</br></br></br>  Who else here actually enjoyed Oreshura?<br><br>Of all the anime I've watched it just fucking stuck with me.</br></br>  Nopan silver best girl  Ai-chan kawaii!      <br>Kek, fucking kek.</br>  <br>I dropped that shit. It was obvious who was gonna win from episode 1 so I didn't bother for more than 3 episodes.</br>  <br>Is that not how all harems are?</br>  <br>But anons, most harem we see are either unfinished, have harem ending, end with a Chihiro, or end with first girl like you say if the harem has less than 4 girls</br>  <br>So you want an harem where the tsundere wins or something? I don't get you, you kinda blocked 90% of the possible outcomes.</br>  <br> MC hates romance because he wants to spend all his time studying. <br> He studies so much so he can become a doctor and find a cure for orange's injury. <br> Gets with silver instead. <br>Literally figuratively fuck this anime.</br></br></br></br>  Silver a shit. I hope she will lose in the LN.  <br>Orange and Pink were the only good girls.</br>  Orange a shit.  He was still going to become a doctor but he had needs. Manly needs, that Orange's fragile vagina bones couldn't handle.  <br>This so much. Silver is the biggest 3DPD cunt in 2D form I've ever seen.</br>  <br>Okay, but who do you want to win?</br>   Lesser Grails are a dime a dozen, courtesy of the Einzberns <br> The Greater Grail is what actually does most of the legwork in realizing a wish/opening a path to the Root/obtaining the Third Magic and is extremely difficult to recreate <br> In Prisma Illya a major plot point is that   Illya was a homunculus created to serve as a Grail for the Holy Grail War and Miyu is her mirror opposite, a freak of nature who started an entire Holy Grail War because she was somehow born with the abilities of a Grail <br><br>Am I missing something? If Miyu is just like Illya, she must be a Lesser Grail right? So that means the idiots that started her Holy Grail War found a Lesser Grail (which the Einzberns able to trivially shit out every 60 years) and created a Greater Grail (which the Einzberns needed a metric ton of help and resources to make) to take advantage of its powers? Isn't that kind of putting the cart before the horse? Or is Miyu a two-for-one combo? Or am I thinking too much about a lewd magical girl anime?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Miyu's greater grail is  the Mooncell .<br>Still doesn't make much sense considering the Mooncell doesn't even require a lesser grail and the process of getting your hands on it would be even harder than finding a natural born lesser grail.</br></br>  Shero  <br>Sausage drills pls go</br>  <br>Fuck that nigga having chocolate and vanilla imoutos all over his dick.</br>  <br>Technically Kuro is his cousin on paper.</br>  Why aren't you holding her /a/?  <br>You can't dirty a shit hole by pissing in it</br>  Anyway, I do realize that I sound like a total edgelord when I talk about this stuff, but this is what's going on here so there's not a whole lot I can do about it.  <br> Anyway, I do think there is some physical law that prevents people from teleporting things directly into your body usually <br>I was going to ask about those flies, but looks like it isn't a concern.<br><br><br>Hey no worries.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I was going to ask about those flies, but looks like it isn't a concern. <br>Yeah, I see black specks and white specks. I assume they must be really heavily magnified electrons or protons or something, but I honestly don't know</br></br>  <br>"gravitational lensing" maybe? I assume there are black holes everywhere, since that's what I remember from physics class, but normally they don't do this sort of thing so it's not clear to me what's going on exactly</br>  It's here folks, get it while it's hot  <br>It was subs made by one guy. I'd say you went it with your expectations too high</br>  <br><br>See<br><br><br>If you don't like it then don't watch it or find some other subs. OH WAIT, THIS WAS THE FIRST SUB RELEASE.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Conversations with him must be confusing</br>  <br>Maybe Amagifags should deal with no subs for months like with Sabagebu or Hoozuki (OVA 2 subbed but not OVA 1 lel)</br>  <br> implying your ignorance to how bad the subs are will make them any better <br><br>like i said i already watched the episode 3 times, twice raw. only browse the subs to glean that they're fucking shit. can't stop me from criticizing a shit translation, no matter how much you don't want to hear it.</br></br></br>  Ship?  <br>That's amazing, I was going to ask about that because I forgot to do it yesterday. She's way too cute to never show up again.<br>I-I promise I'll pick the manga up once the first season is over</br></br>  So are the Chinese readers a bit annoyed by what's going on? Souma bringing in taiwanese food with a little cart (island) just off to the side of Yugi's giant Chinese place (the mainland) to try to challenge and defeat it.  <br> light novel <br>Haven't read the light novel and it's obvious in the manga.  How does she say it in the LN? </br></br>  <br>If mainland isn't making any issues about it why raise it up? fucking sinkies I swear</br>  <br>you are reading too deep anon.<br>but the chinese site I know was constantly arguing whether or not Taiwanese food is even a branch.</br></br>  Smug face thread  <br> not renaming filenames into imgur filenames that when referenced lead to pictures of gay porn <br>It's like you're not even trying.</br></br>    REMOVE smug anime girls from anime.      Was he edgy enough?  Are you?  Name a funnier anime.  <br>Fuck off with your rec thread.</br>    <br>Came to post this.</br>  Is this the fun posting thread?  <br>Leave<br>Enigma<br>Ass</br></br></br></blockquote>]
