Damn you anon.</br>  my waifu  <br>It's kind of insane how certain 90's manga are near impossible to find online.<br><br>I'm still surprised VS Lamune &amp; 40 Fire could be found, but god help you if you try looking for the other Lamune mangas.</br></br></br>  <br>it always blows my mind how virtually impossible it is to find anything dr. slump related.</br>    <br>When will we get another series with designs by Inazuma?</br>  <br>Never because he could never finish a series</br>  <br><br>You do have to realize though that the entire industry of manga has at least some 10,000+ works over the various decades of production. The chances of finding your particular work of interest has to factor in on how popular it was in its day and exactly how many of its readers were willing to translate and upload to the net. Its should be a feat itself to find something from 10 years ago, let alone 15-20.</br></br>    <br>Wait did more of this get translated?</br>  New chapter is translated.<br><br>How long until these semen demons will have a taste of Papa's boner?</br></br>  I want to pop Ivileye's cherry.     and among them was even an Elder Lich, a powerful undead. <br>Is there gonna be a show down in the future? I am excited</br>  You have been teleported to the New World, last two digits of your post make your current level.<br>Are you a vermin or a remarkable threat to Papa Bones children?<br><br> Rolling for shota bard. </br></br></br>  <br>So which one of them  stays alive? </br>  <br><br> All of them. </br></br>  Marry one, kill one.  <br>Ainz has liches doing construction work, I don't think it'll be much of a fight.</br>  <br>Rolling as a Snow girl</br>  <br>That's nice.</br>  <br><br>A female Paladin, dedicated to fighting evil.</br></br>  <br>Marry both, kill self.

Plus you can't kill her so sorry, you're 0 for 3.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to be a Homunculus maid</br>  <br> Gagaran <br>And you know she must have been raping the virgin boys she targeted. Climb is quite lucky at this point to have Reneer at his back.</br></br>  <br>First, i'll roll than i'll marry her</br>  <br>Chuuni is just annoying<br><br>Princess is a crazy fucking bitch fuck that noise</br></br></br>  <br>She's a pure maiden</br>  <br>I've heard people calling her Chuuni twice.<br>Is she actually bullshitting about fighting possession?</br></br>  <br>*Renner</br>  <br>Yes<br><br>She stops talking about it after they catch her because she's just being chuuni and she got caught.<br><br>If she was really being influenced  Landfall  would know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>considering that Ivileye was a companion of the 13 heroes that means she's seen the sword in action in the original owners possession. She mentions she never knew it had those kind of powers/curses on it before, and also it sounds chunni as shit</br>  I just noticed that whenever possible players are mentioned, it's always in groups. Like the six gods or the eight greed kings or thirteen heroes. It sounds to me like it's individual guilds getting transferred over.<br><br>Too bad Papa Bones is a lonely skellington.</br></br>  <br>Rolling for Demon Lord to join up.</br>    <br>The fuck is a chunni</br>  <br>Had they all logged in, Momonga would probably have convinced some to stay on until the very end and whoosh, there'd be more than just him now.<br><br>One of the dragon's specialty is turning players against each other. Wonder how that's going to work with Papa Bones. Without a WC item, turning the Guardians against him is nigh impossible.</br></br></br>    <br>lets do this</br>  <br>Alright lets go faggots.</br>  <br>You know how you wanted to be something nonsensical like a T-Rex or Harry Potter as a kid? Well a chunii is someone that nevr grew out of that phase and still spouts stupid shit like "Witness my Flames of Obliteration, mirrors of my dark soul!" well into his teens and adult life.</br>  <br>TOMB KING REPORTING FOR ACTION</br>  <br>But these people can actually pull off flames of obliteration.</br>  Ayy fucking finally lmao<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>13399</wbr></br>  <br>She doesn't and that's why it's funny.<br><br>She's a cleric with a dark power sword and great warrior but she still wants to pretend she has a cursed evil energy and dark flames and all that shit when she doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>As long as I'm a cute grill, I'll just charm my way out of any situation :3c</br>  <br><br>Technically this is a lie while also being correct</br></br>  <br><br>I still don't see what's up with the princess but i'<br>d kill her anyway since they are hammering us over the head that something is wrong with her</br></br></br>  <br>rolling as slime</br>  <br>Well as long as she isnt telling people its ok. Reading it it seems like they overheard her talking to herself.</br>  <br><br>I WANNA BE THE GUY</br></br>  <br>Her faith seems iffy for a cleric with this fascination of dark powers.<br><br>Honestly holy power doesn't even make sense to me most of the time. Can anyone that plays enough tabletop explain what holy damage is? I can understand healing and how it can damage undead, but what the hell is going on when holy damage hits a non-undead. I can't even fathom how it can be translated to reality.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was pumped but he's probably only a little bit stronger than iguava. can beat maids and thats about it</br></br>  <br>God smites people in the bible. That's basically what holy damage is. Divine retribution striking people dead.<br><br>I would agree that it's pretty vague, but that's how it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Gods wreck people all the time. They just wreck undead more.</br>  <br>Yeah, I just don't like how it has no analog to anything in reality so it's hard to imagine.<br><br>I always try to see it as either physical construct of light hitting something like green lantern rings or a burning light.</br></br></br>  <br> Her faith seems iffy for a cleric with this fascination of dark powers. <br><br>Again, that's why it's funny. This is a universe where you can gain dark power but she's not actually pursuing that, she's just being silly chuuni about it for fun.<br><br>As far as holy power/damage goes it's literally asking your chosen deity/source of holy power to add some FUCK YOU to whatever thing you're trying to attack. Depending on the system sometimes it doesn't modifying attacks against a non evil enemy but most of the time it's just another damage modifier that just happens to effect evil/undead more than it would a neutral creature. Just imagine it like adding fire damage or something to an attack but it has the added effect of doing 4X damage on undead and shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also a maid and total qt.<br>All the girls are top tier semen demons.</br></br>  <br><br>Basically pic-related</br></br>  <br> Ninya <br> Lukeluther <br> Peter <br> Dyne <br>Nevar forget ;_;7</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I just don't like how it has no analog to anything in reality so it's hard to imagine. <br><br><br>It's easier to imagine than "arcane" damage and shit. Still, sometimes it takes the form of light or fire or lightning but that doesn't necessarily mean that's what it feels like when you're getting hit by it.</br></br></br></br>   people in the New World using MMO lingo <br><br>that's kind of neat, im guessing some of the players became kings or some shit and propogated that shit</br></br>  <br><br> grasping her right hand <br> rings on all fingers <br> talks with her dark personality <br> darkness powers <br> darkness <br>comeon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They were easily forgettable as far as killed off characters go. <br><br>Most of their interactions were just talking to Ainz and I don't think we ever got internal dialogue from any of them. They were also only there for a short time and were absent for like half the time they traveled with Momon. <br><br>Really easy to kill off overall. Compare that literally anyone else from the LIzardmen on and you can see how little you should honestly care about their deaths.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic doesn't have an analog to real life either though. Especially not "dark magic/energy".<br><br>I think of it mostly like a really focused ray of light from the sun, almost like a laser except sunlight. The reaction a vampire would get from normal sunlight, i.e. being scorched.<br><br><br>Aye, but I'm still not feeling people with "martial arts" (hoping for a better translation tbh) "activating skills". Sounds retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ninya <br>Male or female?</br></br>  They need to introduce some more players soon. Not that I don't mind Momongas rape train, but he needs some real adversaries.  <br>They all dudes. They even talk about how having a girl would be weird with them all probably wanting to fuck.</br>  <br>Sure, but they were nice and relatable, and didn't deserve to go like that. I liked them.<br><br><br>Male.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hah, you're in for a surprise.</br>  <br>I've liked arcane as a damage type, it's just pure mana that hasn't been filtered or transformed into another element. Sure we can't imagine what the damage feels like, but that's an issue with the lack of magic in our world and not that the concept is incorrect.</br>  <br>I think it was impactful because it was the first time in the series people we;d spent some time with ended up dead. Good people. Carne village was filled with good people but we were never formally introduced to them the way we were with the Swords. It was then I realized if you weren't with Nazarick, whether good or evil, your life expectancy was pretty short.</br>  <br>Rolling for trickster fairy.</br>  <br>Alright, I've been grinding since .<br>It's finally time to beat Ainz and claim werewolf maid.</br></br>  <br>I'm actually enjoying the slow burn. No reason to rush things.<br><br><br>I guess I thought Ainz would have seen the resemblance to his own past and thought it was a bit sad that they died.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just don't like how we're constantly shown how shit the people Ainz is cautious about are. <br><br>Like immediately after wondering who the fuck the group that MC'd Chair were we get to here a testimony from one of the guys how the super secret strongest person in their entire group could probably beat Chair without gear with the implication being that Shalltear with her armor and lance would fucking murder her so there's another group who we know aren't a threat.</br></br></br>  <br>Surprise for what they're all dead</br>  <br><br>MC's pretty busy building his kingdom.

And of course if any of the "Twenty" show up that alone can put even fairly weak humans on par with floor guardians.</br>  <br><br>00 is GM</br></br>  <br>I WILL EAT YOU</br>   “Realize now, Shalltear. You face Ainz Ooal Gown, with the combined might of all 41 Supreme Beings. From the beginning, you had no chance of victory.“ <br><br>This gave me a boner</br></br>  So, are we getting lizardmen or opening trolling us?<br> I'd vote for the troll </br>  <br>Troll for sure</br>  <br>It's a troll. Frost Pain isn't even on there.</br>  <br>Rolling for a bowfag.</br>  <br>She had a pretty good chance of victory and his strategy relied on him being 80% close to losing. <br><br>If anything that fight, despite Ainz being at a MASSIVE disadvantage, goes to show that Ainz is barely stronger than the floor guardians without loads of prep time.</br></br></br>  <br>Or that almost all of his skills are ineffective on undead races with lifesteal.</br>  <br>Well the Floor Guardians are basically Dungeon Bosses so it's not a big surprise.</br>  <br>I think the fact that they made Shalltear do nothing and had her just stand about showed that they aren't necessarily antagonistic to Ainz. If anything, controlling her and just letting her sit in a spot that was obvious is really a sign of good faith I think.</br>  So, does Ainz ever take a ton of NPCs from Nazarick to go on a jolly adventure together? I couldn't be arsed to read past the first book yet, shit's kinda tiresome.  <br>I keep saying she would have won but for aura interfering.</br>  <br>The lifesteal mechanic wasn't even really that big a deal to the overall fight since he wasn't even really doing chip damage until the very end and her getting into melee with him meant he was fucked even without that.<br><br>The undead thing isn't the only problem, if you have any mechanic to avoid instant death (which was readily apparent in the MMO) he was gimped to shit.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't make her do anything because she mortally wounded the old lady who mind controlled her before she could give any orders.</br>  <br>They didn't. She murdered the shit out of the others and put the World Item user into a catatonic state before they could do anything more with the mind control.</br>  <br>You know that the level 95 fire elemental that took a good amount of time for Mare and Aura to kill? Ainz probably has multiples of those and can also summon thousands of skeletons endlessly. Any other guardian would be wittled to shit.<br><br>Honestly, if Ainz didn't actually need to kill Shalltear, she would have no way to get to Ainz through his summons.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you can also say that Ainz just soloed a Raid boss.<br>Said like that, it holds another meaning</br></br>  <br>That would be complicated. They're extremely dependent upon Ainz. And making them fight each other would be complicated, unless they managed to make they think that their companions are trying to betray Ainz, and they acted before consulting him.</br>  <br>Meant to quote </br>  <br> Cocytus using four weapons <br><br>He says the he only uses one because otherwise it would stomp. Also, he usually fights only with 2.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I do not think the King will stop with things such as meddling.</br>  <br>The fire elemental was level 80 wasnt it? And he only summoned that with the guild staff.</br>  <br>We technically see only two weapons.<br>Dual wielding doesn't necessary means one on each side</br></br>  <br>That doesn't matter. Shalltear is good for crowd control. If you just add minions that are weaker than her, you're only helping her, thanks to being an undead she's resistant to most types of damage, and will lifesteal their hp bars.</br>   The whole everything with Shalltear vs Papa Bones <br> Everything after it <br>What an awesome fight, and then so many feels for lonely Ainz.</br></br>  <br>He takes best maid out for some adventuring.</br>  <br>That's why I'm saying that just because Shalltear hard counters Ainz, the other guardians don't necessarily match up to him.<br>Ainz can probably easily defeat any of the other guardians.</br></br>  <br><br>The only troll here is that after adapting vol 1, the anime is going to get rushed as fuck animate up to volume 8.</br></br>  <br>It really doesn't because we never get a gauge on how competent the parties invading Naz were. We're told she could take on a full group of 6 and some more but there's really no comparison on how good the people invading ever were. <br><br>If you really want to compare shit to the old game it means that the guardians are so shit that a single above average player (and I quote "middle of the high tier") with a joke RP build and small use of cash shop items was able to solo her meant she's overall not impressive (as far as we're just comparing every endgame thing from the NPCs to players) with most of his moves being useless and his final gambit being "use the shitty spell to job change and auto attack her".<br><br><br>That would only put her at even more of a disadvantage. She even summons shit for herself to kill while her Eidolon tanked Ainz (which he needed to use his ultimate shit to stop anyway). Adding the summons (which we're told how many relevant things he can summon anyway) only helps her in the long run and the fire elemental that A) was shit and B) could only be used by using the guild staff which he would never take out was better than any of the undead he's summoned before. Turning that into a prolonged fight would have been even shitter since he role is to be a drawn out tank fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well to be a threat to papa bones you either need to be a lvl.100 priest or a lvl.100 paladin. pretty much nothing else is a threat. maybe a lvl.100 mage. the problem all 3 run into is the NPCs in the tomb are all raid level boss characters, and all have varying strength which make a papa bones busting character sorta gimped for dealing with the npc horde. <br><br>I'll roll a paladin. they're fun to play even if you aren't taking on undead lichkings</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz's build relies heavily on using his summons as meatshields/support, and his Unholy/Instant-Death Spells. Against Shalltear using Summons is stupid because she can lifesteal off of them, and his Unholy spells don't work on her because she's Undead.</br>  <br> It really doesn't because we never get a gauge on how competent the parties invading Naz were. <br><br>It wasn't so much how competent the raiding party was, It has to do with the quality of the gear they used. Shalltear has divine class gear, at least for the spear.</br></br></br>  <br>The other guardians all have other shit to avoid instant death mechanics and even though they mention that Chair is probably "stronger" than the others that the difference in strength is minimal enough that any two guardians fighting together would easily kill her fast.<br><br>I don't think Ainz would lose to any guardian shown thus far (honestly Pandora's Actor maybe) but really the "major disadvantages" he had against Chair were easily negated by the huge amount of preptime he had to where any floor guardian would be a hard enough fight.</br></br></br>  <br>ayyyy</br>  Gotta build my own Nazarick for that pathfinder game. That still needs ~2 more players.<br><br>Advice on design?</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say easy, but Shalltear is the only guardian that could realistically beat him.  Hell, the only reason he won was because he used his superior spell casting strength as a diversion to burn through Shalltear's MP and skills, and then took it to a melee fight with a bunch of OP weapons. Had the situation changed even a bit, Ainz would have had even more difficulty, or lose right out </br>  <br>Rollin to capture and  sexually bully  Narberal<br><br>60+ pls</br></br></br>  <br>The only reason he won at all was because of aura fucking with the fight.</br>    <br>True, the last second hesitation very nearly cost him the entire battle, damn Papa Bones and his sentimental heart or bone</br>  <br>It was upper 80s. And yeah he didn't use his regular divine items and AoG during that fight.</br>  <br>He should have taken PA. Taking Narbel was the worst decision of his life.</br>  <br>Ainz can beat any of the Floor Guardians relatively easy, compared to Shalltear, since she is specifically built to be his counter.</br>  <br>Why is narberal so cute and useless?<br><br>I don't understand how she pulls it off.<br><br>I don't even want to fuck her. I just want to hang out with her and talk.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What did she do? I forgot. I however remember that the whole fire/resist and faking his hp bar were more important overall.</br></br>  <br>Makes me wonder how large groups could have trouble with a floor guardian if a single lv 100 can handle them. Even if Ainz is upper/mid tier it sees like the first few floors can easily be put on farm status by actually competent players.</br>  <br>Rolling for regular human spear-user.</br>  <br>She psyched out Shalltear when she was going in to finish Ainz.</br>  <br>Rolling for duel wield shield.</br>  <br>I cant remember 100% But when ainz hesitated she did something to distract shaltear before she could land the deathblow.</br>  <br>And yet it took 1500 of them to actually make a meaningful raid on the tomb.</br>  <br>She isn't built to be his counter. She has anti death resistances and beyond that she has a good class match up but that's it. <br><br>If you give any sort of anti instant death then Ainz is looking at a fight that's really not any different from the Chair fight.<br><br><br>At the very last blow Aura gave off a weird Aura that made Chair hesitate just a moment longer than Ainz did.<br><br><br>Well it wasn't just the floor guardians. You had to deal with any entire zone of enemies and traps, Ainz was still upper tier and knew her inside and out, and despite mentioning that they liked to pretend to be the final bosses the instances with the mine and shit implies the guild would still go to PK the fuck out of people invading.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it was never one floor guardian, it was always the guardians, their minions, and possibly the battlemaids. I'm pretty sure it was mentioned all the members of Ainz Ooal Gown waited in the throne room to meet anyone who could possibly get past. Plus I'm sure if any raids decided to stick around and farm one of the floors, the guild members would show up to take them out since they aren't doing it the right way, or other floor guardians/minions would show up to corner them or chase them off. But then again, you have to remember Shalltear was the first floor guardian, so she probably decimated any invading forces with her offensive power, and the raids decided to continue on rather than sit around and wait for Shalltear to be brought back.</br>  <br>Full Divine Gear.<br><br>People seem to be stuck in the mindset that YGGDRASIL endgame is like WoW's endgame. Where as long as you have a good guild that'll actually carry you, even a total scrub can get somewhat decent raid gear in literally like a week.<br><br>Based on the description that even if you include the hardcore players, the average level 100 had 0-1 pieces of Divine-Tier gear. I would assume YGGDRASIL is more like the p2w korean MMOs. In those, in order to get anything resembling end-game gear, you have to farm raid bosses for materials to make your gear. The catch?  The rare materials have 1/10000 drop rate on raid bosses so you're fucked unless you either land that 1/10000 chance multiple times, or you hate your money. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget pre-fight buffing, pay2win item abuse, attacking his opponent before the fight even started, using a treasure trove of high powered guild weapons he just gathered, reading up on all of Shalltear's abilities before the fight, setting mines up before the fight, wearing holy resist gear in secret, and pretending fire spells do nothing to him. With so many dishonorable tactics in a 1v1 fight it's no wonder he succeeded.</br>  <br> She used Sky Eye to spy on Shalltear and give off murderous intent to distract her for a split second long enough for Ainz to break the hourglass </br>  <br>A true pvp p2w god.</br>  <br>I don't think we'll be allowed to make non euclidean and nonsensical level transitions like that.</br>  <br>Rolling for skelly brawler</br>  <br>It's kinda sad how poorly she does at blending in with humans given her race. But then again she is only a level 1 doppelganger.</br>  <br>And from what we know, practically all the big names of Ainz Ooal Gown threw tons of money at the game, Ainz himself once spent all his money on trying to get a super rare ring.</br>  <br>Dont forget dropping two super magic spells on her.</br>  I wonder if fighter classes had a skill that let them turn into spell casters, like how spell casters have Perfect Warrior  <br>Aw yeah son, level 95 fighter, I'm ready to level castle walls and tear apart whole armies alone. Plus I still have room to grow.</br>  <br>I played FFXI with it's 0.0000001% droprates for years. Being with people that wont gank your drops or leave when they get yours and you haven't is a bigger issue than actually farming stuff.<br>There's also the fact that mulltiple guilds were higher ranked and/or stronger so it's not like there wouldn't be anyone incapable of fighting them<br><br>Then let's take the fact that everyone seems to insist that it's SO HAAARD to beat them that players all got scared away.<br>Absolute fucking Virtue didn't scare players away until Sundi accidentally revealed that it really was supposed to take 12+ hours to fight and there wasn't some super secret trick to drop it down to a reasonable time we couldn't discover. Sure the motivation to beat it was more of a fuck you to the devs but you underestimate just how hard players will throw themselves at a challenge.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didnt they change Absolute virtue anytime someone found a way to feasibly beat it?</br>  <br>I live to serve papa bones.</br>  <br>Roll</br>  <br> fighters <br> able to do anything at max level </br></br>   DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE N PASSION   <br>Touch Me was literally unkillable for a while.</br>  <br> 12 hours straight dealing with shitty MMO gameplay <br><br>Dunno how the fuck people would willingly submit to that torture.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't talk shit about Touch Me</br>  <br>Yeah.<br>To be fair the first few times were from people experimenting so much they found random as fuck glitches to exploit.<br>I mean seriously. Who honestly expects to discover that you can become invulnerable to the strongest being in the game via catching yourself in a cutscene at a spot halfway across your current map section?<br>Plus the Wall of Justice where players would nuke it from above while it couldn't reach high enough to hit them.<br>The first time it died it didn't have drops because they put some obscene monster in the game without expecting players to kill it.(How do you get that lazy?)<br><br>Noone could actually fathom that it was SUPPOSED to take that long. Everyone thought that they were just missing some obvious in retrospect trick to make it from impossible fight to a reasonable but difficult fight. That's why that Pandemonium Warden fight managed to keep the players in for so long. Noone could believe that there was anyone Sadistic enough to make something like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 12+ hours to figh <br><br>Let's be real here, was it fun?</br></br></br>  <br>He's concerned about his subordinates going on a killing spree. <br><br>Nevertheless, he's willing to sacrifice Nazarick if he can make sure that he can get away with his children. However, this is unlikely, given how formidable Nazarick actually is.</br></br></br>  <br>Ever played a game for 12 hours straight? Feels like you're slowly rotting away, falling and falling ever more.</br>  <br>I wonder if he only cares about the floor guardians or if he plans on taking the battlemaids and lower level NPCs and even a few skellingtons.</br>  <br>If 1500 players and NPCs attacking couldn't conquer Nazarick, I doubt anything in the New World below a godly being could take the tomb.</br>  <br>He cares about what was actually made by the guild.<br><br>The generated NPCs can all fuck off for how much he cares</br></br></br>  <br>I once played for 30+ hours straight back when I was in high-school.<br><br>I was fine all the way through but when I actually stopped and went to sleep I felt like dying.</br></br></br>  <br>Nazarick is a testament to endgame hoarding. He has enough legendary weapons hoarded away to equip a small army, much less the Divine weapons that many of the defenders seem to have.<br><br>This is not counting the mountains of high-end material most endgame guilds obtain over the course of just a year, much less 10. Ainz also has an advantage in that he's essentially a adult from the future; he has far more schooling than most individuals in the New World. He isn't like the demon lord and hero from Maoyuu, whom have to politicize their way to impose reforms; his minions essentially do anything he asks, alongside the perks of being mostly immortal monsters.</br></br></br>  <br>He cares about what was made by his old comrades, since they are like the children of his friends</br>  <br> goblin club </br>   DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION   <br>The only reason they lost was floor 8.<br><br>If they found a way to ignore Victim (and if the secret NPCs like the miko/Lastborn/Rubedo or whatever combination of them are each other aren't that amazing) then they would have beaten the tomb completely and even the guild itself would have lost.<br><br>Really if they all got together and tried again they would have won but Victim just fucking ruined everyone's day so much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I DON'T WANT OUR SOULS TO LET GO </br>  So, is there a way for Ainz to actually bone Albedo and Shalltear, with him being a skeleton and all? I'm sure this topic was probably discussed at length already.  <br>Not to mention the hoard (in comparison) of World level weapons that all the Guardians have, and Ainz has up his sleeve to turn around any situation if it gets too dangerous.<br><br>Needless to say, if there ever was a threat that warranted the FULL might of Nazarick, every trick, trump and ace, said threat would be swiftly and overwhelmingly crushed.</br></br></br>  <br>They also had 40 other members answering the call to war. Now it's just Ainz.</br>  <br>I knew better(that entire region of endgame didn't offer much to me back then and I already had the only real drop from there needed fairly quick) and the people that did fight it before that revelation tended to also be experimenting on it for SCIENCE to figure out the mysterious super secret method to weaken it.  Turns out there was one tiny little trick that required you to use your job ability (that was on a once every 2 hours timer) at the exact same time it used it's own matching job ability to "seal" that ability. note that you have to pick from one of 13+ ja to get the right predicted one, natural lag means that by the time you see it it's already too late, a full wipe resets it to unsealed, it's aoe damage was enough that most of these jobs would DIE just from being close enough to seal it even in the latest set of gear before the 75 cap was removed, and even if you lived next door to the serve in Japan it was outright impossible to do so with proper timing without a bot. <br><br>There is a reason that when FFXI players heard that Sundi had cancer and had to step down that everyone barely held back tears of joy.</br></br></br>  <br>Easiest way is to use the wish ring that would transform him easily but I'm sure there are other work arounds.<br><br>If he really wants an heir (which he doesn't) and it has to involve actual fucking he'd be better of fucking Albedo or Aura since Chair is undead.</br></br></br>  <br>What's Victim's power?</br>  <br>Ruining peoples day</br>  <br>To separate the atoms inside himself.</br>  <br> Majin Vegeta </br>  <br>If you kill him he releases EVERY SINGLE debuff possible on the entire floor.<br><br>He can't attack and there's no friendly fire but he follows you throughout all of floor 8. There's implications that even if you were aware of this and didn't fight him the other characters on floor eight (with the only confirmed being cherry blossom guardian) would result in you having to use an aoe at some point and you'd still kill him.</br></br></br>  <br>So basically, Victim is the wizard's book of exploding runes?</br>  <br>Well we don't really know how the invasion went. Victim and floor 8 very clearly ended the invasion right there, but there were 7 other floors that easily could have torn through the attacking forces, weakening them and reducing their numbers in huge swathes. I doubt theres a way to just "ignore" a floor guardian though. But still, even if they got past Victim and Floor 8, they would have to still deal with Albedo and the whole of Ainz Ooal Gown, which would have been a fucking nightmare to face, Touch Me alone would have been an absolute monster to face. And if by some miracle the invaders beat down all 41 members of Ainz Ooal Gown in their throne room, armed with who knows what weapons and items to route their invaders, theres still getting to the treasure room, which is guarded by Pandora Actor, so that's potentially fighting Touch Me two times in a row.<br><br>Regardless, the invasion would have probably been stonewalled by the guild if they made it past Victim</br></br></br>  <br>That's some nice stuff. Whoever made him was a wonderful asshole.</br>  Honestly I'd like to know how they did what they did with him at his level. There has to be some tradeoff.  <br>The middle girl looks like she's all about FREEDOM</br>  <br>You know what would be neat, if we get a side story telling us what all happened during the riad.</br>  <br>None of the guild members fought the invaders, they all waited in the throne room like final bosses. The invaders were wiped out due to the Floor Guardians, ultimately completely being annihilated by Floor 8 and Victim.</br>  What's up with Shalltear and the whoe chair thing, anyway?  <br>What would be neat is a side story about Touch Me being a complete beast.</br>  <br>He is a floating embryo that cant do anything but die. Thats a fairly big tradeoff.</br>  <br>Some sort of dual wielding shadow kirito mixed with ninja and EMIYA in there, It's going to be either amazing or I get Urobutcher's lucky rolls and fail at everything.</br>  <br>When's this ED song coming out? It's so good.</br>  <br>The trade-off was probably lots and lots of real money, and probably why he is literally useless when he's alive.</br>  <br>Both OP and ED come out on August 26th.<br> The wait is going to kill me. </br></br>  <br>Aw man, such a long wait. It's so catchy it's stuck in my head and now I have to hear the whole thing.</br>  <br>See but you can't assume that either. You're right on not knowing how powerful the 1.5k Player/NPC raid was but I cannot imagine having downed everything else that engaging in PVP with the guild meant defeat. The game balance was fucking abysmal but I can't imagine even Touch Me just being able to wade knee deep into hundreds of players just smashing through them (after losing his 100% resistance option) and the other players in the guild minus "the strongest magic caster" were nowhere near Touch Me's level. <br><br>It's all up to speculation since we don't know the details but I'd really imagine with that many players (despite it largely being NPCs) they were just getting zerged until Victim who shines the absolute brightest when his range is everyone regardless of numbers. <br><br>I guess we really never know since the deepest level defenses (whether it be the demon golems, the delay maids, the guild itself, PA, and the Avatara) never got a time to shine ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It still gets me that in universe the average player was so fucking stupid that the combination to make the low level Victim never got found out by anyone and that Yg itself was the most sealed game of all time where players had secret fucking classes due to everyone being assblasted over sharing.<br><br>It must had the most toxic community of all.</br></br></br>  <br>Rolling for radiant fist monk</br>  <br> but I can't imagine even Touch Me just being able to wade knee deep into hundreds of players just smashing through them <br>Wasnt he so powerful that they just banned his build?</br></br>  <br>I ain't even mad. If I had some super class that I found I wouldn't tell anybody shit.</br>  <br>Victim is also efficient as fuck as he is low leveled so he doesnt contribute much to the Guardian npc total level count max.</br>  <br>I bet it's something along the lines of forcing the low level with his martyr job preventing him from going beyond current strength<br><br>I mean these are supposed to be level 100 raid bosses, game devs just didn't account for people to make a boss with what is essentially a gimmick class that forces the loss of 5 levels on your character.</br></br></br>  <br>What end up happening was with all his previous traits that gave damage reduction him winning the tournament to get the special champion class meant he ended up with 100% damage reduction (he literally could not be hurt) so they had to change it.</br>  <br>stop that<br><br>the 700 levels were for the actual guild base not the dungeons it's why all the maids or butlers except Sebastian max out at level 60</br></br></br>  <br>Does it take less gold to revive since its so low level?<br>Can you even revive that thing?</br></br>  <br><br>Yes, it's like getting wasted, fun while you are doing it, hell the next morning.</br></br>   the feeling of his life being carved away. A feeling similar to your vision darkening from losing most of your blood, it violently rattled Ainz’s… No, Suzuki Satoru’s weak mind. <br> rattled </br>  <br>Yes. Ainz mentions he would res him if he dies.</br>  <br>I thought Victim was just one of the bought NPCs.<br><br>Tabula bought like a hundred carrion babies to make a spooky room at they were level 20.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ding!<br><br>Grats!</br></br></br></br>  <br>So apparently the Guardians full under a different system. <br><br>Ah, I bet I know. They can only have 700 lvls worth of NPCs free of charge when they raise their guild that high. After that, I bet they had to buy them after that.</br></br></br>  <br>Dont think they ever stated if he was custom npc or premade one.</br>  <br>Maybe he was based on some rare as shit monster in a misc far corner?<br>I personally don't get how anyone could possibly have run into whatever monster he's based off of and NOT realize he's perfect for defending a floor.<br>Given the level of assblast people got from victim he's clearly the sort of thing players would remember running into for later use.<br><br>But yes. The game community was clearly full of retards and toxic as fuck.<br>I mean seriously. How else could guilds actually let themselves get tricked into killing each other when they have an entire planet to divide up and they're the only threats to each other?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably is custom though considering how cheap his gimmick is and how the invaders didnt know about him.</br>   There will never be a game like yggdrasil where you can pk non-humans lawfully and create characters force the devs to patch out your skills.   <br>But if the raid succeeded they would have gotten a shit ton of loot as well as the world class items if they weren't used.</br>  <br>Instead everyone lost 5 levels and a random piece of gear<br><br>Which is probably why Nazarick has such a huge treasury</br></br></br>  <br><br>Odds are the fact that Dieing loses you levels is what prevented most players from even thinking about the implications of the Martyr Class. <br>it's only the fact that NPC revives work on a different system that makes the build work at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Well you can't blame them. They had 1500 dudes. THEY didn't know that shit was going to go down. Not to mention the guild was only ranked like 8th. I'd hate to see what the other tops guilds where like.</br>   “Our leader said so awhile back when we were alone. She was grabbing her right hand pretty hard and said something about how only a woman of faith like her can suppress its power.” <br> Was the thirteen heroes's leader a chunni?</br>  <br>Does noone hack into the datafiles in the future or something? Even if they can hide certain things the're is loads of stuff that's getting broken into within hours of a patch. They might not know how to GET said stuff but they can know it exists which is probably why everyone actually knew of the world class items.<br><br>Wrong link or misinterpreted me saying something that might be a spoiler for you?</br></br></br>  <br>ranked 9th, but had the most World Class items out of any Guild( 11 out of the 200, second highest had 3)</br>  <br>No that's them taking about the Blue Rose leader.</br>  <br>I wonder based on what were the guilds ranked. Ainz ooal gown was mostly a PK guild but considered "a top guild" with the hardest tomb in YGGDRASSIL, so were other guilds just ahead on raid progress, loot stash or what?</br>  <br> Does noone hack into the datafiles in the future or something? Even if they can hide certain things the're is loads of stuff that's getting broken into within hours of a patch. They might not know how to GET said stuff but they can know it exists which is probably why everyone actually knew of the world class items. <br><br>It's retarded but for the sake of the story just imagine that the people who played MMOs in the future were idiots.<br><br>They try to get around it by saying that information was a good commodity to have and that the level of shit like a bajillion classes meant nobody knew everything but let's be honest people would find a way and would know everything.<br><br>It's just a story and the Yg stuff doesn't really matter so I ignore what's ultimately a really minor aspect of the story,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It might be some system based on totals or something.</br>  <br>Another thing. why didn't they properly siege the place if they had that any people? If there's no teleport system they could have tried to lock the players inside while taking shifts.<br><br><br><br>Probably based on rarity of gear obtained, wealth(p2w probably helped that alot), and how absolutely fabulous your base was.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the devs had future bullshit tech to stop hacking.</br>  <br> Another thing. why didn't they properly siege the place if they had that any people? If there's no teleport system they could have tried to lock the players inside while taking shifts. <br> sieging people playing a game <br><br><br>They'd just make alts if worse came to worse, keeping the game up on a different computer</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz was a small as fuck guild and relied on you being a functioning member of society. Out of all of them Momonga was the most NEET of all and even he wasn't on 24/7. I'm sure even he was outclassed by a NEET playing all day and wasting his future welfare e currency.<br><br>The other guilds were probably just larger and just generated more "activity points" which is usually how guilds are ranked or were dedicated to PVP (I'm assuming the other top guilds had a member who was one of the other 8 world champions)/PVE to a much higher degree than Ainz Oon which seemed to enjoy just making shit in their dungeon.</br></br></br>  <br> If there's no teleport system <br>Did you miss the part where almost immediately after the story begins, it mentions that there is one?</br></br>  <br>Yes and yes.</br>  <br> Another thing. why didn't they properly siege the place if they had that any people? If there's no teleport system they could have tried to lock the players inside while taking shifts. <br>there was lots of Teleportation, so long as you were part of Ainz ooal gown, otherwise the teleport blockers in the Great Tomb of Nazarick wrecked your day</br></br>  <br>Well there is the whole lose 5 levels on death thing<br><br>Yeah you can grind at shifts but after the first few wipes trying to figure out boss mechanics and getting harassed by a bunch of assholes that can freely teleport through the base to hit you when you are stuck fighting gargantua or someshit you'll eventually stop being a threat.</br></br></br>  <br>Considering how stuff that entire government agencies work on for years to create gets cracked within hours I kinda doubt that.<br><br><br>That's different. I meant as in as long as there was no way to teleport around outside of the tomb.<br><br>I must have forgotten or you're referring to the teleports inside the guild base which don't really count for when you're besieging em from the outside to ensure they can't earn the money to pay upkeep.<br><br>The Alts delivering cash if there was a mail system that another anon said makes more sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's special about this nigga?</br>  <br>He's Ainz's husbando.</br>  <br>His build is literally broken, as in the devs made the class/race combination impossible to select when they figured it out. He's  untouchable .</br>  <br>That's Mr. Nigga to you</br>  <br>Rolling</br>  <br>Its future magic, I aint got to explain shit.</br>  <br>Considering all Ainz members were members of Society it is even more impressive they managed to be so high on the guild rankings. Not to mention their guild was also very small. Also it makes sense they mostly PKd shit out of intruders, humanoid races and just tinkered around in their Tomb like any good villains.</br>  <br>Going by what others said he apparently managed 100% damage mitigation because devs are retarded enough to not notice that before a dude abuses the shit out of it to beat an entire world tournament.</br>  <br>Except of Touch me whod go around being everyones hero in shining armor.</br>  <br>No him beating the world tournament is what allowed him to get 100% damage resistance.</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br>roll plz</br>  <br> "In real life, he has a beautiful wife and children."<br><br>The more you know about this guy cooler he seems.</br></br></br>   Guide the beasts to their cage <br><br>what does he mean by this?</br></br>  <br>Where are people getting the 100% resistance from? I don't recall Ainz mmentioning anything too specific about it.</br>  <br>He's "hunting" a guy. He calls him a beast.</br>  <br> Guide the soldiers to the trap/ambush point.</br>  <br>whats the best way to get this?</br>  <br>Gear, spells and racials.</br>  <br>get what?</br>  <br>just an assumption<br><br>I figure it was less damage mitigation and more like super self healing on a nearly pure tank to the point nobody could outdamage it while he still had room to go on the offensive thanks to dovahkin racials.</br></br></br>  <br> That's different. I meant as in as long as there was no way to teleport around outside of the tomb. <br>Portalling out of the Great Tomb of Nazarick is going to happen next episode</br></br>  <br>the manga I watched the first 2 episodes and I want to read the manga</br>  <br>Well, aside from the obvious of just googling it, I'd recommend you read the LN first.</br>  <br>It's when they go to the Treasury in 3</br>  <br>They started off with just the Teleportation Rings. Then once Volume 2 starts, Teleportation magic gets brought up constantly.</br>    Right! I’ll just ask the Guardians to think about it. I can ask them if they have anything that they want badly enough to pay money for! <br> Ainz's hug tickets incoming.</br>  <br>talk about bad idea of the week.</br>  <br>what website is best used for reading manga these days?</br>  <br>what has manga got to do with Overlord?<br>go read it at Baka-tsuki</br></br>  <br>google</br>  <br><br>I'll be nice, you can get the first volume here:<br> http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%AA%E<wbr>3%83%BC%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AD%<wbr>E3%83%BC%E3%83%89-1-%E3%82%AB%E3%83<wbr>%89%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AF%E3%82%B3%E3%8<wbr>3%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%EF%<wbr>BD%A5%E3%82%A8%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9-%E<wbr>6%B7%B1%E5%B1%B1-%E3%83%95%E3%82%AE<wbr>%E3%83%B3/dp/4041030714/ref=sr_1_4?<wbr>ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437268954&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywo<wbr>rds=%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%90%E3%<wbr>83%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> </br></br></br>  <br><br> Mare offers 100 million for a "Sleep with Ainz" ticket.<br><br>Albedo offers 400 million.</br></br> </br></br>  <br>gold?

Ainz Fun Bucks?</br>  <br>No that's literally what they do</br>  <br> An auction was held to decide what rewards they should get for their service. They didn't want this, but Ainz ordered it.<br><br>Everyone is assumed to have started off with an annual budget of 15 million. Things escalate from there.</br></br> </br>  <br> Ainz mentioned he is going to create some kind of Nazarick currency made of paper to pay the Guardian's salaries, but since everything in Nazarick is free and the things sold in the New World are shit, he is going to ask the Guardians what kind of thing would they pay money for.<br> This'll obviously end up with Ainz whoring himself in exchange for Ainz Fun Bucks.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if they'll have his face on them</br>  <br><br>I assume Albedo gets preferential prices for being a such a good customer, right?</br></br>  <br>How would anyone tell?</br>  <br>Sorry. I meant I wonder if Ainz will have his face on the Fun Bucks.</br>  <br>I just imagine Albedo day after day refusing to use her money for cuddling and sex while slowly counting up the coins needed to buy herself a one-time pregnancy and official wife status.</br>  <br> &gt;Implying all skeletons looks the same <br> racist </br></br>    <br>Mare is just....innocent right?

Said person who used it most likely was proficient in it and wanted to spread his knowledge to fellow humans.  In b4 Touch Me on his alt was the cause. <br><br>In the same vein, it is most likely the same WC item was used again for the auto-translate affecting the whole world, otherwise there's no way demihumans which live god knows where out in the far reaches would have gotten access to eating that konjac shit.</br></br></br>  <br> You will never be a cool species  <br><br>I'd change in an instant if I could.</br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me that the ocean water isn't salt water.

More like KensuGAY  Fucking reifaggots, man.    <br>Kensuke is the straightest, realest nigga. He sells videos of his dick for money.</br>    <br>Kensuke a shit.</br>    <br>Ayy, yo fuck you Touji. Stupid cockass nigga.</br>  <br><br><br>At least Kensuke still has both his arms and legs.</br></br></br>  Abandon thread.  <br>That's the same fujoshit that hijacked an Asuka thread yesterday ain't it? And then was being butthurt in the other eva thread up.</br>  <br><br>Nah, fuck you. Touji best grill. This is now a TOUJI APPRECIATION THREAD.</br></br>    <br>KENSUKEFAGS NOT WELCOME.</br>  <br>He did this same thing in an Asuka thread a while back too. These threads are cancer anyway though.</br>  Isn't Kensuke the oddman out? Jock has freckles girl. Shinji has painful strangulation girl. <br><br>Who does glasses have?</br></br>  <br>KENSUKE A MAJOR SHIT.</br>  I want to watch evangelion. I really can't find the best subs and the /a/ wiki says nothing... So i'm kneeling in front of you /a/autists<br> tell me the best subs for the best anime ever, onegai </br>  <br> still clinging to the fujoshit boogeyman <br>You're just booty blasted that you Asukafaggots can't maintain your own thread.</br></br>  <br>Touji is the REALEST NIGGA.</br>  <br>Damn, he is an asshole. An asshole and a huge faggot.</br>  <br>Download [2D4U].<br>There. Fucking retard.</br></br>  <br>HE'S ALSO BEST GRILL, KENSUKE IS WORST GRILL. FITE ME FAGGOTS.</br>  <br><br>if I post Rei will moot stay away?</br></br>  <br>Which episode is this, I don't remember this.</br>  <br> backpedaling after saying you were assblasted about Asuka threads <br>Dis fujoshit.</br></br>   thread overrun by Toujifags <br>You faggots always do this shit. Everytime I try to have a nice peaceful Kensuke thread you fuckers have to ruin it. Your waifu is A LOSER WHO GOT HIS LEG CHOPPED OFF. KENSUKE WON THE SHINJIBOWL, SO DEAL WITH IT YOU AUTISTIC RETARDS.</br>  <br>Fuck off, Kensuke is an EMOTIONLESS DOLL. Touji is feisty and hot and has a great ass. The superior waifu is pretty much every way.</br>  <br>You know, you don't have to invade an Asuka thread and spam like a retard, go make your own thread.</br>  <br>Unlike Kensukeshit, Touji actually has a fucking character and is way hotter than Kensuke. Touji is superior waifu, moot and Anno agreed; don't bother them about it.</br>   that landwhale from yesterday is so anally rekt they will argue with themselves <br>Anno didn't die for this</br>  <br>Also Touji won the Shinjibowl, not Kensuke you stupid faggot. Sasuga Kensukecucks.</br>  <br>Kensukecucks don't even understand how deep Eva is, so they choose the shallowest fucking character as best grill. What a fucking joke. NO ONE FUCKING LIKES KENSUKE, EVERYONE LIKES TOUJI MORE. Kensuke is literally a meme waifu with no character and depth and backstory whatsoever.</br>  <br>Also Touji's dub VA is LITERALLY HIS OWN WAIFU; HOW FUCKING EPIC IS THAT? Literally the best waifu. Stupid shitty emotionless doll Kensuke can't even compare.</br>  <br>There's a reason why Kensuke was replaced with Kensuke Q in 3.0. It's because HE SUCKS. No one in Japan wants him in the movies so they fucking replaced him with a clone that ended up being more likable than he ever was! IF YOU ACTUALLY LIKE POKA POKA KENSUKE GO FUCK YOURSELF. Touji won the Shinjibowl in NGE, in the Manga, AND he'll win it in Rebuild too! He's simply perfect, and there's nothing you Kensukeshitters can do about it but cry.</br>  <br>Now I'm going to bed, and remember this Kensukecuckshitters: If I ever see you make another Kensuke thread again I'll fucking derail it with BEST WAIFU TOUJI MOTHERFUCKING SUZUHARA. Peace.</br>  He even copypasted exactly what he wrote a few weeks back. There's not even effort involved.  <br>Moot won´t come back until Third Impact.</br>  Where are the Asukafags at?<br>Lets end this gay shit already.</br>  I cry to myself every night while jacking off because no one loves me  <br>I´m with you good sir.</br>  <br>Nobody wants to get involved in the fujoshit's autism</br>  <br> tfw you don´t even love yourself </br>    I hate Asuka, she's ugly.

Have fun shitposting, I need to go do  not anime </br>  I want to have sexual relations with Bossuka.  <br>No she´s not.  ;_; </br>   fujos assblasted they will never be as perfect, beautiful or desirable as Asuka-chan <br>It must be a sad existence they live.</br>  <br>I only wish I could lift like her :(</br>  <br>Eyepatch Asuka, best Asuka.</br>  <br>If you stopped being such a useless shitposter you too can get a nice body.</br>  MUH DICK    seeing asuka smile like that makes me really happy, it´s just perfect  <br> his dick </br>  <br>Of course I've never really cared much about moot as a person, but I do have to be a bit thankful towards him considering he even bothered keeping this shitheap going at all, regardless of reCAPTCHA and other crap. I don't really miss him, but I do miss when he used to fuck with the board's format, like with BELIEVE IT, Komm susser tod, and Code Geass. Also, when he got drunk and shitposted, and Asuka's birthdays. Those were kind of fun.<br><br> Also, I summon this card from my deck, and it is a five. </br></br></br>  <br>More of Misato-san please</br>    <br>It can make you believe in miracles.</br>    <br>I don´t know who the retard was that though it would be a good idea to give Asuka blue clothing whatsoever but there you go.</br>  <br>Is this what the kiddies consider a nice body nowadays?</br>    <br>Who is this "moot" you're talking about OP?</br>    <br>Misato a whore, but I kinda like her anyway.</br>  <br>A landwhale like yourself would only be familiar with those.</br>    <br>no u<br><br>Asuka is a bitch, but I don't want to stir shit in your thread so<br><br>she also has no tits</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The founder of 9gag, he always wanted to be a little girl and marry Asuka.  but he can´t ;_; </br>    <br>I don't even like seafood.

The wheelchair girl was Alfou, and to give full context her father is rich or owns the hospital or something, and Alfou is spoiled when she's bedridden<br>She hears that her father remarried and had another child, effectively throwing her away<br>As a last resort, a girl is called in to volunteer to be her friend and help her, and that is of course Yuragi<br>They immediately become friends, and discuss how Alfou loves the Grimm version of Cinderella, where she must lose her glass slipper to get the prince, and her step-mother and sisters have their feet cut off and their eyes gouged out at the end<br>The moral that she likes is that to gain happiness, one must first sacrifice, so by losing her legs she'll be able to become a bride<br>Yuragi brings wixoss to her and suggests that she plays black<br>This is when Mako's sister dies, which traumatizes Yuragi and prevents her from seeing Alfou anymore<br>Alfou decides to go through the extremely painful rehabilitation so she can move herself around and go see Yuragi herself<br>She ends up in front of their school, but as Yuragi passes and Alfou speaks out, their eyes meet and Yuragi walks away without a word<br>(Recall that at this point she's developed the inability to see faces)<br>Alfou basically falls into despair as the Cinderella who will live forever covered in ashes<br>That's when she meets her LRIG, and makes her wish: Let me be by Yuragi's side!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>She's just too obsessed with a shitty twintail who'll probably never love her back.</br>  <br>And, time to leave this thread in fear of spoilers.</br>  <br> Maybe in the end Yuragi will get over both her obsession and her past trauma, so she'll finally be able to recognize Alfou's face and they'll live together happily ever after. <br> I want to believe.  ;_;  </br></br>  <br>All this suffering.</br>  <br>OKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAA!<br>All this foreshadowing.</br></wbr></br>  <br>The more this develops the more I want to see it animated.</br>  <br>It will never happen. It's such a shame Mari Okada wasted something like this in a spin-off and not in the main series.</br>  <br>At this point Re/verse will surpass even WIXOSS S1.</br>  <br>Because not everything is anime sales, fucking faggot.</br>  <br>Look at the glorious background and you will find the answer.</br>  <br>These two are very cute!</br>  <br>Piruluk is now Amika property.</br>  <br>I completely forgot that that's when Valentines' Day is.</br>  Will be a recap?  <br>R U U C H A N<br>U U C H A N<br>U C H A N<br>C H A N<br>H A N<br>A N<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    post yfw it's written by the same scriptwriter who did Spread     backstory movie about Midoriko when she was a Selector   At first I thought the movie would focus on completely different characters, but using the same is a big plus.  I just watched the first season. What the hell kind of ending was that? What was the scene at the beginning supposed to be (if season 2 spoiler, don't answer)? Do I have to watch Spread? (It seems people hate it)  <br> Do I have to watch Spread? (It seems people hate it) <br> relying on other people for your enjoyment <br>Just watch the first episode and decide things for yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>The first season ending was a punch to the face then a suplex and while you were lying down in pain, finish you off by a kick to the balls.<br><br>It was great.</br></br></br>  <br>No nigga. The first episode was what we expected to happen THEN the writing shifted to another road.</br>  <br>It was more a watered-down Madoka but I don't want to start a war. <br><br>I'm not the kind to complain but literally nothing is explained. What was the "condition" supposed to be? What was Tama's wish?<br>I'm a sucker for tweests but plot-wise, it was absolutely empty and felt like it was here just for the sake of being here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS.</br>  <br>You need to pay attention more. The show gave a lot of hints regarding this.<br><br>We know that you need to recite the "whole" Eternal girl chant to fulfill it.<br><br>We know that the only really two conditions are that you win at least 3 games and your LRIG thinks she can grant your wish. This is when you start to glow.<br><br>In Iona's case she was not turning Eternal girl on her 3rd win due to her unique wish of wanting to be the LRIG of the best Wixoss player. So she had to lose once before Ulith thinks she is capable of "granting" that specific wish.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I had understood that but that was truly a risky act coming from Iona. <br>Did Tama say she couldn't grant the wish because it was absolutely impossible or because she didn't want Ruu to become a LRIG? She said she didn't want to be far away from Ruu so she sacrificed herself, is that it?</br></br>  <br>Tama made a selfish decision that is selfless towards Ruuko. She did not want Ruuko to be sacrificed and be a LRIG alone. Add to that Mayu's emotional manipulation of Tama and you've got your pot of confusion brewing.</br>  <br>Looks like I have to watch Spread after all, no matter if it's shit. The ending really felt contrived, albeit understandable, and made solely to spite Madokafags.</br>  <br>Enjoy the derailed ride.</br>  I'm confused,  why were there 2 Alfous on chapter 7? Was it just a way to show what Alfou wanted but regreted later? or was the other Alfou Alfou's original LRIG? They had different hair too, one of them had 2 braids but the other only one   <br>chapter 8*</br>  When these two will fuck?  <br>Never<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>  I miss Selector threads. It was fun looking forward to this show with you all every week. Haven't gotten that kind of feeling from an anime since.  <br>You better prepare yourself for the new Gundam because it's mostly guarantee almost half of the people from these threads will be there.</br>  <br>Yeah, but so will /m/.</br>  <br>Fine with me, I already go to /m/ anyway for Gundam and  Symphogear .</br>  <br>We just need another HYPE anime original, like Samflam, WIXOSS or YuYuYu.</br>  I can't wait to hear something like this in the new gundam.  <br>  another HYPE anime original <br>Why aren't you watching Symphogear GX, anon?</br></br>  <br>Symphogear GX only has shitty memesubs.</br>  <br>I should have posted this image, actually.</br>  <br>You have Crunchy for minimal-song-subs-speedsubs now, Commie for memesubs, and H&amp;D for maybe-not-quite-as-flowing-but-not-<wbr>memesubs. No worse than Funi simulcasts and then the wait for Asenshi for WIXOSS.</wbr></br>  <br>Not that anon, but is it worth it? I haven't watched the first two seasons.   Can't believe I don't watch anything this season besides Gangsta. </br>  <br>You can't just skip, you'd have to go back and watch from the beginning.</br>  <br>You'd have to marathon the two previous seasons but believe me it's worth it.</br>  <br>If you like songstresses fucking up toku-style mooks with magitech powered armor, Wild Arms references, and suffering overcome by friendship and hotblood, then yes, definitely (especially if you like Nana Mizuki, Aoi Yuuki, and/or Ayahi Takagaki, as they all have main-character roles).  is absolutely right, though.</br>  <br>The wait is real now.<br> What's up with asenshi site? It's been down for a couple days now. </br></br>  <br><br>Thanks, I'll go for it then.</br></br>  <br>It's up on my end.</br>  <br>This season is shit and they have their own lives. I hope they do the next gundam.</br>  <br> Nana <br> Aoi Yuuki <br>Ok, I'm completely sold now.</br></br></br>  <br>It's up for me, just checked.</br>  <br><br>Well shit, I have some figuring out to do, then.</br></br>  <br>Oh, turns out I just had an old-ass bookmark to asenshi.net when they moved to .moe at some point. Crisis averted.</br>   waiting for Asenshi <br>You fucking skeleton bitches.</br>  <br>Skeletons, you say?</br>  Waifuest!    <br>I want to sexually fuck Aki-lucky's shocked face</br>  Glorious LRIG.  Ok, I've started watching episode 2 of Spread and I'm wondering what the fuck is up with all of those flashbacks and weird dreams. Also, the plot doesn't hold when there are no stakes and the characters are absolutely not hellbent on trying to change anything, and it doesn't seem to be such a bad thing for the friend to be a LRIG now.<br><br>I feel like continuing beyond this point would be a bad idea. I'm giving up.</br></br>  <br>Okay.</br>    <br> I feel like continuing beyond this point would be a bad idea. I'm giving up. <br>I pointed the same back then in the second episode of Spread's thread.</br></br>  <br>It's a shame she just got a a few minutes.</br>  Oh boy, maybe we'll finally get something about Ru's dark past<br><br>Also hopefully more Aki-Lucky</br></br>    <br>    Can't believe I don't watch anything this season besides Gangsta. <br>Symphogay's as campy as it usually is. This season's pretty good though; Lerche's going into maximum overdrive with three whole shows.</br></br>  Would you buy Wixoss cards if they were translated and released in the west?<br><br><br>This season is good for light shows. I don't think anything heavy this season is worth watching.</br></br></br>  <br> Would you buy Wixoss cards if they were translated and released in the west? <br>Yes, hurry up and do it Takara-Tomy.</br></br>  <br> Would you buy Wixoss cards if they were translated and released in the west? <br>YES</br></br>  <br> Gurashis taking over other threads <br>Stop this. /a/ will start spewing their "cancer fanbase" shit.</br></br>  <br> Would you buy Wixoss cards if they were translated and released in the west? <br>Sure.</br></br>  <br><br><br>They are going to be busted by Bushiroad if they got the balls to do that.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't get the appeal of the series beyond PTSD little girls. </br>  <br>No way in hell if they are censored.</br>  <br>It's pretty gay too.</br>  Is this series actually decent? <br>I watched the first episode of the first season when it was airing, but stopped at that point because it appeared to be setting up to be melodramatic with the whole 'muh incest' theme and the main girl being a pushover, however second season's opening is pretty based which still makes me wonder whether this shit is worth watching.</br>  <br>That's the point, anon. And they are around 18. The manga is doing an actually good depiction of the toll a zombie world takes on the mind of the girls, that is the strength of the manga.<br><br><br>GG isn't. It has occasional sexy times but it hasn't gone down the /u/ slope and I beg it to stay so.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is this series actually decent?  <br> I watched the first episode of the first season when it was airing, but stopped at that point because it appeared to be setting up to be melodramatic with the whole 'muh incest' theme and the main girl being a pushover, however second season's opening is pretty based which still makes me wonder whether this shit is worth watching. <br>WIXOSS is not for everyone.

Please retcon spread and fix it's problems  <br>It's most likely to ignore Spread happened.</br>  <br>You just brought up an interesting point. Studio Pablo's schedule doesn't mention work for any movie in 2016 so I guess it really is just going to be a recap.<br><br>It does cite movie work for 2017, so I guess this could be a recap movie setting up a sequel for the year after?

Although Zorori is notorious for his pranks and tricks, his conniving plots often backfire and end up helping his targets, and despite appearing to be villainous and immoral, he is actually caring and sentimental. Nevertheless, Zorori has the wits, intelligence, and dexterity to always find a solution out of the most hopeless of situations. Travelling with a pair of twin boar bandits, Ishishi and Noshishi, he continues on his journey to make his deceased mother proud. <br>Fucking Okada!</br></br>  <br> Known for tricks, but helps his targets <br> Appears villainous, actually caring <br>That's Okada.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8v7<wbr>xtD0gkYM</wbr>  [ ]<br>Seems like this will be filled with 'random' Okada.</br>  <br>Ruuko loks cute and Chiyori looks fantastic.</br>  Talkback thread<br><br>http://ayy.yal.jp</br></br>  <br>isn that from battle of gods?</br>  <br>what the fuck am i supposed to do with this?</br>  <br>Google it and you're good to go</br>  apology for poor english<br><br>where were you when goku dies?<br><br>i was at home eating smegma butter when screwattack ring<br><br>'goku is kill'<br><br>'no'</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> goku dying <br> implying he doesnt die all the time <br>Minor setback, at most.</br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  I have Sayla preordered.  <br>That is one pretty figure.</br>  maybe one day i'll finish gundam. then i can move onto zeta  <br>Then you can watch the true masterpiece, ZZ.</br>  https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order<wbr>/detailPage/item?itemCode=101386728<wbr>2&amp;ref=list<br><br>Version 2 coming too I bet.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  I got something a little different from the usual buyfaggotry in the mail today. My Takarajima (Treasure Island) animation cel arrived today. Cels from Takarajima are really hard to find. I've only been able to find one site that has them, they only had a small selection.  <br>Anime ja nai!</br>  <br>I never said it was.</br>  <br>Its Ple</br>  <br>I thought turn A was the masterpiece</br>  <br>I watched about 16 episodes, it's kinda stupid and the mecha designs are awful. At least Laura is cute.</br>  <br>Good to know the site's at least legit.</br>  <br>Don't you already have a few of these?<br><br>Anyways, they're not uncool. Congratulations on your finds.</br></br></br>  Can't stop thinking about this beauty.  <br>So many gatari characters, I don't know if I should buy them all or none at all.</br>  <br>How about you only buy Kissshot and Shinobu.</br>  <br>Right now I have both ougi and kiss-shot on preorder. You just gotta get both.</br>   moving out because you can't bear the shame of your figure collection of half naked women to your family   <br>I already preordered Kissshot. I'm considering Nadeko.</br>  I didn't see anything in the guide related to managing finances related to figure purchases. I was wondering how you guys keep track of how much you will owe per month and all that.<br><br>Thinking about making a simple Excel file, but I was curious to see if anyone here does anything different.</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate Ougi but this is really nice.<br><br>Such a strange conflict.</br></br></br>  <br> not hiding your figure collection in your closet in led lit deltofs </br>  But what if I only want GAR things?  <br> still living with your parents when buying that shit <br>damn you really fucked up</br></br>  <br>Nope, this is my first cel.<br><br><br>Yeah, they were pretty fast with shipping too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm the only one who thinks this will bin?<br><br>Just going by MFC numbers, there's 1k people with her on pre-order, then add the Japanse and the number can grow 3 times more or so, yet she's still available fucking everywhere. Kinda feel this is going to end up like Mikasa, shit ton of people with her, yet it never ran out of stock and now is selling for like 6k.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just display them anyway</br>  <br>whatever</br>  <br>Work is less than 30 minutes away and I live here rent free while paying student loans.<br><br>Seems dumb to move out. Besides the obvious shame.<br><br><br>Could try this.<br><br><br>You are a better man than I.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it might be a case of them overestimating the popularity and making too many, or it's just been SO LONG since it was announced nobody cares any more<br><br>... or they're just waiting for kizu to air then it'll be super popular - himouto stuff on amiami went from nothing to the 5 most popular spots after the first episode aired so it can happen if SHAFT actually fucking finish it</br></br></br>  <br>Even though you ask, it's not like there is any solid alternative to an Excel spreadsheet.<br><br>I recall many people here manage their orders on Excel. It's easy to make and use.</br></br></br>    Anybody else getting the pink version? I'd prefer the original version but I missed out on it. Pink hair looks alright to though.  <br>I used one for about a month and stopped. I don't see the point unless you spend a huge amount every month or are really poor.</br>  <br>who wants a gomora?</br>  Does anyone have experience with those $15-25 chinese knockoff oppai/butt mousepads form ebay?<br>Not expecting them to be anywhere near official ones, but are they at least serviceable?</br>  <br>Get the best one.</br>  <br>I like Ultraman, so this and the Baltan have me kind of tempted, but I don't collect girl figures.</br>  <br><br>I use Excel, I got a job exclusively to maintain this hobby, so it helps me keep track of how much am I going to spend each month and if I can spend more if anything goes up without warning.</br></br>  <br>How about you just buy an official one?</br>  <br><br>I don't known the character and I usually don't like male figures, but that one looks pretty cool.</br></br>  <br>Wow<br><br>super cute</br></br></br>  <br>I have the original, but I can't decide if I want to buy this one, or not.</br>  <br>It's just aesthetically pleasing, don't mind the the character.</br>  <br>the only official ones that interest me are in the hands of scalpers and cost about 3 times as much as I'm willing to pay.</br>  <br>How is the original anyways? Besides being over hyped, did it turn out alright?</br>  <br><br>Dat ass so phat, even the skirt clings to it.</br></br>  <br> did it turn out alright? <br><br>It turned out pretty great. <br><br>http://toy-navi.net/archives/441507<wbr>55.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they are probably made by the same chink as the official ones</br>  <br>That is super lewd.</br>  <br>Looks like I'm getting the strawberry version then.</br>   I missed preorders <br><br>Do you think there will be any Rankos after she gets released?</br></br>    <br>That's a tiny butt.</br>  <br><br>But it looks firm and tight, those are the properties of a good butt.</br></br>  <br>I think it could use a little more depth.</br>  Please sell on the PLUM shop so someone can sell this.  <br>This is the only worst girl worth getting.</br>  <br>Yes, preorders have been closed for months.</br>  <br>I buy too much with my dick.

They've been much slower on the time between announcing and sculpting figures these days.</br>  <br>Total opposite, most manufacturers used to announce figures that were released years later. Nowadays we get some figures and preorders going up in mere weeks.</br>  <br>Figures also look better than ever nowadays.<br>I wish they would go back and do some old properties, some characters only have shitty figures or none at all.</br></br>  <br>今冬</br>  <br>Of course buddy, this winter. I swear</br>  <br>I'd spread my vanilla all over that ware</br>   Amazon selling nendoroids directly from their warehouses <br>They can be trusted right? They have one I want for the same price as mandarake but I won't have to pay shipping on amazon and I get that prime 2 day.</br>  Out of curiosity, why's Alter's Vivio always so cheap?<br><br>The figure looks amazing, why's it always like 3k when all other Alter figs tend to shoot up in price?</br></br>  <br>Ya, you're totally right, just like Phat's Anastasia, or GSC's Kiss shot, or MF's Lucina/Satsuki.<br> newfags </br></br>  <br>How much did the madoka production notes cost you? I already have them, but I'm curious.<br><br>And I got that prize figure this month, she's great.</br></br></br>  <br>it's old</br>  <br>You mean three figures that g against the general trend? Shocking. Now compare that to every Sin by Amakuni, Hestia and Momohime by them as well, or all the figures by Alha Max since their first Alisa. <br><br><br>Now go back to some years ago and check what we had back then, DArtagnan took 4 years, ignis of the endless winter took 5, All the Hyaka Ryouran Figures took at least a year, go even further back, Shii by GSC took 2 years, BRS took two years as well,. It wasn't that rare to see the exact same figure unpainted for three straight wonfes. <br><br>And if you want a larger sample look at Orchid Seed, they keep a years long queue of figures since 7-8 years ago and jsut recently they hav gotten into the sub-yearly releases.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody liked Vivio in Strikers</br>  <br>As long as it doesn't look like shit it's an insta-buy for me, I love snake god Nadeko.</br>  <br>The fact she barely even appears in that form, probably. I have her though, she's pretty great. Looks lovely alongside Signum too.</br>  <br>theres also the ougi figure that was posted before.<br>it was announced at the same wonfes and is already up for preorder.</br></br>  <br> talking about a GSC figure. <br> writes a paragraph on non GSC figures, as if that has anything to do with what was said. <br>dumb.</br></br></br>  Did anyone here buy the various merchandise for Houkago no Pleiades? <br><br>I bought the entire set of it, for some reason they didn't ship it all together though and one of the packages is stuck in customs.</br></br>  <br><br>Says the retard who can't even read.</br></br>  <br>Nothing pains me more than knowing that this masterpiece sold poorly and we'll never see anything more than what is already out on amiami. I bought a key chain, quality figures never ;_;</br>  <br>I'm sure they are fine,   but I'm not sure and I just ordered one too.  </br>  <br> How your car will perform with these new additions </br>  <br>I don't even know who this is but I want it.</br>  <br>I preordered a mug on amiami.</br>    <br><br>Was this honestly worth picking up? It was one of the few series last season I didn't even watch the pilot of.</br></br>  <br>yeah, sure bro</br>  <br>I got both for 160. I wasn't going to get the normal note but I figured the autism of getting one and not the other to save around 10 dollars would eat at me. Felt the same about Hibiki until I noticed I couldn't find her cheaper online.</br>  <br><br>That fucking paranoia, holy shit.</br></br>  <br>How do you not know Sayla?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Maybe he's new.<br>Also, any Lalah figures?</br></br>  <br>Aunt Jemima bottles are still a thing, I think.</br>  <br>I instantly dismissed his comment as sheer bait and didn't even bother replying since I assume everyone knows the important characters from the original Gundam--if they don't know them then they aren't even worth responding to in the first place.</br>  <br>Eh... I don't get it.</br>  Why do most shows get clear files for merchandise? Do people actually use them?    <br>I think it's just an easy way to merchandise illustrations alongside posters.</br>  Who would buy this?<br><br> page9.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/aucti<wbr>on/k193343255</wbr> </br></br>  <br>I use them, they come in handy sometimes.</br>  <br>Holy shit that is hilarious. Look at pochaco go. Too many people scared of going boom.</br>   awesome design <br> unique take on character <br> <br>Oh yeah, I can't wait to... <br><br> Play Arts Kai <br><br>God.Is.Dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck. Looks like some bid was rescinded? Shows 702,000 en now. Still, too fucking much.</br>  <br> awesome design <br>That's debatable.</br></br>  <br>I thought Rin hasn't gotten a phat yet.</br>  <br> people still think paks are bad </br>  <br>Maybe recent PAKs aren't as terrible as some older ones, but they are still shit.</br>  So, amiami isn't letting me log in and I don't know why. Whenever I try to log in it says "There was an error with your e-mail address and/or password. Please try again." and I even tried the "did you forget your password?" option but it isn't working either. <br><br>What's up with this? My account was working just fine a few days ago.</br></br>  <br>At least Subaru has an okay figure that's not too hard to get. <br>There's also that one doujinshi and the artbook, although the former is impossible to find at a decent price so I just settled for xpoz's other unrelated doujin.</br></br>  <br>Did you cancel anything recently?<br>I'd say shoot them an email.</br></br>  <br>I found the scene the cel is from. It's from episode one, the scene where Benbow attacks Billy Bones.</br>  Why havent NG gotten figures from Phat yet? Minami is next.  <br>Happened to me before, just send them an email saying you can't log in and don't wanna make a new account since it's a rule violation.</br>  <br>Because they got ones from GSC.</br>  <br>I have one of mai waifu I use for keeping paperwork and info pages in when I'm travelling.</br>  <br>So phat isnt allowed to do the? I want a good Rin and I dont like GSCs</br>  <br>She hasn't, I got the GSC one. Since Phat is under the GSC umbrella they're probably avoiding doing the same girls.</br>  <br>It may happen eventually. I like the GSC ones but I'd like a set of NG in matching outfits.</br>  <br> NG in matching outfits. <br>Fuck NG. I want Triad Primus in matching outfits. I'm really tempted to get Rin's GSC but I'm holding out for something better. Phat ones are an instant preorder though,</br></br>  <br>WASH AWAY THE ANGER.</br>  <br>Who did the Subaru fig I want to pick one up now</br>  <br>Not enough belts.</br>  <br>And she was from back when the ova happened in 2012</br>   some shitty watermarks but whatever <br><br>This figure looks hot as HELL</br></br>    <br>Didn't cancelled anything, idk what's going on.<br><br><br>Thanks! Emailed them already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Link?</br>  <br>Only if it's fulfilled.</br>  <br>No. How hard is it to search Pleiades, or even Pleiades + mug on amiami? Come on.</br>  <br>Did you import the swimming wear?</br>  Thinking about ordering this in the hopes that they make a Yuudachi one too.  <br> being gaijin and supporting boatshit.  <br>I'll never understand</br></br>  <br>What does that have to do with anything? It's not like gaijin can't play.</br>  <br> being gaijin and supporting japanshit <br>It's fucking retarded, right?</br></br>  <br>What does being gaijin have to do with anything? We can play boats just like anyone else.</br>  <br>Not all gaijin are EOP, and you don't even need to know nip to play the game or enjoy the character designs/voices.</br>  <br>You are actually fucking retarded. The irony is real</br>  <br>Because the series revolves around japanese warships and a lot of Japs support it also because they see it as nationalistic. It's not like they're American or EEuropean boats</br>   http://page4.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/<wbr>jp/auction/d168072732</wbr> <br><br>How much are you willing to pay for your waifu /a/ ?</br></br>  <br>this actually looks really good. i've never even played kancolle</br>  <br>and?</br>  <br>A lot more than that.</br>  <br>About tree fiddy</br>  <br>at least twice that</br>  <br>those hips</br>  <br>I'm German. I am 100% ok with supporting it.<br><br>Unlike butthurt Americans, apparently.</br></br></br>  <br>the amount of references to the ships being sunk in real life is pretty funny.</br>  <br>Thanks m8 just ordered her from hobby link</br>  <br>No, I got them at  SDCC . The shop had it for retail price, same as the GuPs.</br>  <br>What are Bismarck, Prinz Eugen, Z1, Z3, U-511, Littorio, and Roma then?</br>  I love getting multiple packages in a week.<br><br>Somehow Amazon's packaging was better than FromJapan's.</br></br>  <br>Non-Allied ships.</br>  <br>What was your recent activity on the site?<br>You might have gotten banned, happened to me when I purchased an item for a trade with a guy on MFC, had it shipped directly to him.<br>They unbanned me but I was pretty mad.</br></br></br>  <br>No shit, you're an axis power. Of course you'll support your Japanese brothers.</br>  <br>Wow, AX was selling the GuPs for $10 each.</br>  <br>i need this in my life</br>  <br><br>I am convinced the crotch plate is forced cast-off. But i need proof.</br></br>  <br>Eagerly awaiting owari in the fall.</br>  Starting to realize I hate long hair on figures. Always feels like it's going to break.  <br><br> being butthurt about a conflict that ended decades before you were born </br></br>  <br>That's the price he bought it for. I saw the booth at SDCC.</br>   https://<span>youtu.be/-Jsy7xx0ltA  [ ]   <br>Buy it and let us know</br>  <br>I saw another shop selling blind boxes for 15+ apiece too, nobody there bought anything from what I could see.</br>  <br><br> buy it. <br><br>Like i can now.</br></br></br></br>  I preordered Sayla<br><br>Now give me a good figure of this goddess.</br></br>  Symphogear scale this WF?  <br>After listening to the OST properly I feel like I should buy it.</br>  <br>Don't hold your breath, anon.</br>  Postman showed up right before I left on a trip so these pictures were rushed. I'll unbox them and post pictures when I get home if no one else posts theirs.  <br>We need a Char figure more than anyone else.</br>  <br>There's already one.</br>  <br>Then why do you care?</br>  <br>Still waiting on an Amuro. I almost bought his prize figure for 5000 yen a while back. Kind of regretting not doing that, since now I can only find it on YJA and it's more of a hassle to get it there.</br>  How do you guys hide this shit from your girlfriends and friends?  <br><br>Because i want to own it anyways.</br></br>  <br> I love getting multiple packages in a week. <br>Same here. Getting a package can just brighten up your day. I'm glad years of being a poorfag taught me some self control, otherwise I'd be getting figures in the mail nonstop.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand why some of you faggots do this. What do you need to rush and post shitty pics for? If someone else posts it doesn't mean you can't, it wouldn't even take much effort to do better than this. I just hate you.<br><br><br>By shoving all my merch up your ass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I ask them to understand.</br>  <br>i cover them in a blanket of cum</br>  <br>Like this</br>  <br>R.I.p</br>  <br> hiding things <br>I display them at work. Not the lewd ones, obviously.</br></br>  <br>I was just about to order the Hibiki figma off of the after market, but I think I'll wait until Wonfes is said and done to see what comes out of that first.</br>  <br>Use excel. It's really the best way. I'm not poor like one guy mentioned but it helps if you order a lot and from different places. <br><br>In my excel I put down what I'd estimate shipping to be, paypal conversion, links to the item, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's pretty great. Iwasaki Taisei did an amazing job for his first anime soundtrack.</br>  <br>I don't. Even my naked/lewd loli figures stay out in the open. Family and friends either don't care or they think it's "cute".</br>  <br>Actually there are far better alternatives, depending on the use you want from it. Personally I use Mint for Android, keeps track of expenses, income bills and whatnot.</br>  <br>I just have a note on my iphone with figure names, release dates and prices.<br>also have any other stuff like video games there so i can make sure im properly budgeted for everything.</br></br>  <br>I want to do indecent things to this body.</br>  I just manage my figure expenses like this. I have a 300-400 monthly budget When I receive an item, I just save what I spent on mfc.  <br>I usually don't do stuff like that but I wanted to prompt someone else to post theirs since I can't enjoy mine yet, sorry. Usually I'd take the pieces of cardboard out of the window for more light but it's a bit of a hassle and I was being rushed out. I still tried to put in some effort where I could, the original pictures were much darker.</br>  <br>Don't do anything lewd to Noel's body please.</br>  <br>Ya blew it kid.</br>  <br><br>My mum thinks my lewd figures are cool but my gunpla and chogokins are childish and lame. A woman will just never understand.</br></br>  <br> signed up for Mint when I had no job <br> each weekly email was a depressing reminder of all the money I didn't have <br>That said, this thread was a huge help during those times before I got a job, which was recently. It was kind of inspiring to see people's monthly orders and all the new figures that were coming out. Thanks, guys.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up poorfag.</br>    In your opinion, what figures have exceptionally delicious thighs?    <br>My collection is mostly made up of mechs and male figures like Lupin III and Cobra. I don't have anything that would warrent hiding even if I had a girlfriend.</br>  <br> mechs and male figures <br>Yes you do.</br></br>      <br>Na, this stuff is surprisingly acceptable around normalfags.</br>   want all the Kayon Alters <br> would cost me $400 <br>I should probably sell my Apple watch.</br></br>  <br> tfw im friends (one of two) with local pharmacist assistant <br> she sees my grandpa come in for his depression meds regularly <br> he asks her every time if she could help me get out of the house <br> he tells her that i need to make more friends and talk to more people, and that he's worried about me <br> he's literally never said a word to me about it before <br><br>my family thinks im a failure,  at least i have my figures thought right </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My dick</br>    <br>Head looks bad<br><br>Delicious body though</br></br></br>  Who is going to buy all 38 life-sized standees to party with 24/7 at home?  <br>He's not poor anymore you retard.</br>  <br>Horizon's shiny thighs are probably my favourite amongst all my figures.</br>  <br>Yeah they accept you for what you are, a manchild.</br>  <br>What are you going to do with them anon? Conga Line?</br>    <br><br>Yeah this just screams manchild to me. It's like adult transformers collectors, except worse.<br>At least with bishoujo figures people will think you aren't gay and you can be surrounded by pretty girls. Also, why would you even want a figure of a male?<br> I-I like his character <br> H-he's got a great personality <br>No, you're just a faggot.<br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That faggot has posted his collection numerous times.<br>It looks like a junk heap you'd find at a flea market.</br></br>  <br><br>They should've gone with the bat elin for the reaper figure</br></br>  <br>Personal audience to cheer me on as I pursue my hopes and dreams.</br>  <br>Nice outfit though the hairstyle does not mix that well with it. Also, thighs should have been fatter.</br>  <br> It's like adult transformers collectors, except worse. <br>Nothing is that bad.<br> Also, why would you even want a figure of a male? <br>Because I don't collect things to please my dick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this real?</br>  <br>It's a real  GK </br>  <br>Purple Hard</br>  <br>I've never seen a sadder collection in my entire life. Even faggots who collect SAO and AOT shit are better than that display of pure disgust and anguish. I want to kill myself after looking at something so terrible. <br>And if your'e not buying things to please your dick, your'e buying them to please your asshole you fucking faggot.</br></br>  <br>Too much puffy</br>  <br>They need to move this to console or think of a mobage. MMO are shit now, but I want to play as an elin.</br>  I think umaru chan is giving me mental troubles.<br>I really want to like it, it's cute and all but watching it in my undies, unshaven and miserable only makes me even sadder.<br>The world of umaru is perfect, cute and cuddley and the real world is disgusting, foul and depressing.<br>Umaru is so happy that it makes me depressed.<br>Anyone else feel that way or should I seek medical help?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seek help</br>    well when she grows up shes going to be a bag of shit like you if she continues indulging like that so there's your consolation  <br> The world of umaru is perfect, cute and cuddley and the real world is disgusting, foul and depressing. <br>Your first anime? Otherwise </br></br>  <br> Your first anime? <br>No. I usually avoid overly cute stuff. When i watched azumanga 10 years ago I didn't have that problem for some reason.<br>But this anime is giving me real "brb gensyoko" vibes.<br>I'm sitting here in my appartment in my underpants, a fully grown man with a beard in a disgusting 3D world and I'm voyeuristically peeking into this perfect 2D world of umaru and her brother.<br><br>It doesn't feel right and depresses the shit out of me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What exactly prevents you from shaving, wearing nice clothes, cleaning your fucking room, excluding all 3DPD people who can ruin your day from your life and creating a perfect 2.5D bubble around yourself to enjoy?<br>If you just sit there being jealous it's only your fault your life is shit.</br></br>  Is this why Umaru-chan is so hated on /a/? Because she lives the life everyone here wants but doesn't have?  <br>Most of it is because she's annoying and spoilt. But there must be lazy anons who can't be assed to clean their apartments up too.</br>  <br>Man I would kill to have an adorable and talented otaku imouto to spoil. You guys are looking at it all wrong.</br>  <br>Thats a 10000 yen fine Anon.</br>  WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?  <br> What exactly prevents you from shaving, wearing nice clothes, cleaning your fucking room, excluding all 3DPD people who can ruin your day from your life and creating a perfect 2.5D bubble around yourself to enjoy? <br>The fact that I have to go outside... well should. I haven't been to university in a few months because I panicked and couldn't stand 3D people anymore.</br></br>  <br>The moment you stop giving her attention she turns into a fucked up gyaru that sucks old men to compensate.</br>  <br>You feel guilty watching something that glorifies this lifestyle because you know the reality of it. You're subconsciously comparing yourself to the oblivious and happy Umaru and wish you could live without this guilt on your shoulders. Normally you'd be able to dodge the anvil of emotion by escaping into the world you're watching but knowing that this world is a brighter version of yours, you know you'd only darken it and be back in your own despicable shoes.<br><br>But fear not. <br>If there's an anime that makes you feel guilty about your lifestyle, you may change, you may be your own beacon of light that finally dusts off this depression and lack of motivation. In the end, you might actually have your life improved by an anime.<br><br>Either that or you'll feel bad for a minute, go back to masturbating and collapse under the weight of your own uselessness. After that you'll go back to the same old same old without having changed at all. I'm placing my cash on the second option.<br><br>In short. This is not for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you majored in computer science<br>Only major that rewards you for being a shut-in autist.</br></br>    <br> her solving the captcha at the end </br>  <br> I hope you majored in computer science <br>History.<br>There was just too much pressure and too many people. I didn't feel like going outside anymore.<br>I failed all exams because I didn't attend a single one this semester.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> In the end, you might actually have your life improved by an anime. <br><br>Going off of that, if you haven't watched Welcome to by NHK get OP, I think you'd benefit from it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss our old captchas.... NOT.</br>  <br> Going off of that, if you haven't watched Welcome to by NHK get OP, I think you'd benefit from it. <br>I hated the part where he got a job.<br>I read the manga though. No idea how the anime ends.<br>I also hate genshiken and how happy those otaku all turned out to be.</br></br></br></br>  Take a shower and clean up your room, retard.  it feels kind of dark to me, like umaru's carefree world is a house of cards, ready to topple over at any moment. <br>where shes totally dependent on nii-chan for companionship, dinner, shopping, and so many things.</br>  <br>Your aversion to happy endings might be keeping you from your own happy ending.</br>  <br> umaru's carefree world is a house of cards, ready to topple over at any moment. <br>Theres drama looming in the manga, while its not on full force yet but I think Im gonna enjoy when it happens.</br></br>  <br>You forget that she can turn the retard mode off when she goes outside. Sure losing onii-chan's support will be unpleasant, but she's capable enough to manage without it.</br>    <br>I like Onii-san-chan.</br>  <br> it feels kind of dark to me, like umaru's carefree world is a house of cards, ready to topple over at any moment. <br>Yeah, that's what is bothering me too.<br>That's why I can't play games like animal crossing or kirby either.<br>Things that are too happy make me anxious as fuck. Umaru without her brother would turn into a total disaster of a depressed sack of shit in no time and she knows it.</br></br></br></br>    <br>shitposting like a pro.<br>Is it normal that I'd rather fuck her otaku form than her perfect schoolgirl form?</br></br>  <br>They hate Umaru because they cannot see her as waifu. Those poor lost souls needs someone who can take care of them, while with Umaru they will need to take care of her.<br><br>So sad.</br></br></br>    <br>god damn it moot</br>  <br>She'd just find someone else to mooch off of. Also she isn't a failure when she goes outside.</br>  <br> They hate Umaru because they cannot see her as waifu <br>Actually I think I'd get along great with her. I'd be buying vidya and staying up all night playing games and watching anime anyway. Think of it this way, I only have to buy one copy of games. Plus making food is like low effort, I do that for myself everyday anyway.</br></br>  <br>I always pick all but one of the correct options (unless there are only 2 correct, in which case both) and then one incorrect one.</br>    <br> australian <br/></br>  <br>What do you think Umaru shitposts about?</br>  <br>dicks</br>  One of these days I'm gonna buy some potato chips and chocolate bamboo shoots with a bottle of coke and watch Umaru chan.  <br> chocolate bamboo shoots <br>I wonder if I can find this in China. I found some Calpis Water here the other day in a FamilyMart, pretty good stuff. Though it was pricy at like 17.8 yuan versus the a bottle of coke or iced tea of the same size which sells for around 2-4 yuan. Heck the bento I bought for lunch yesterday was only 14.2 yuan.<br><br>I'm guessing Lawson's might have more nip goods, but I've only seen those in Shanghai.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's you, but we're talking about people who can't take care of themselves, there's a lot of guys that spend most of their time just browsing the web, watching anime, playing videogames or reading manga, they don't clean their rooms, don't cook, don't anything. You see, if someone shows you with an example how pathetic you are, you usually get mad, it's the same in this case.</br>  <br>FYI, you can turn on "legacy captcha" in the settings and go back to the old captcha so you, too, can shitpost like Umaru-chan</br>  <br><br> fuck <br><br>Too lewd and rude. I want to build plamo with her and have mock battles while watching mecha anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck 4chan isn't banned in China yet?</br>  <br>They're not literally bamboo shoots, just cookies shaped like bamboo that have a chocolate coating. I imagine you could probably buy some chocolate covered shortbread cookies and eat them with potato chips to achieve the same results.</br>  <br><br>He's probably in Hong Kong or Taiwan.</br></br>  <br> they don't clean their rooms <br>Well I don't usually clean my room either, there are clothes and stuff littered all over. Once every couple of weeks though, I get my shit together and clean stuff up. How can people not cook though? I would get sick of takeout and convenience store food everyday.<br><br><br>I'm as surprised as you are, guess they don't care cause the average chink is even worse than a nip at English. Also China has it's own everything, the Chinese part of the internet is pretty much a self contained bubble.<br><br><br>Mainland actually, I fucking wish I was in HK or Taiwan.<br><br><br>Ehh, yeah I could do that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you asian?</br>  <br>Western analog to that would be chocorooms.</br>  <br>Brown I suppose? I come from the continent of Asia but am not yellow.</br>  Umaru is only happy because she passes as normal in the real world. Just take a bath, put on some clothes, go rent/buy a book and read it in a park or in a coffee shop. People will think you are normal or even smart when they see you. They will never know that you're a gross weeb.  <br> rent a book <br>I think that is called "borrowing a book" from a library.</br></br>  <br>Who ?</br>   It's time.   <br>Prison School full of worst boys.</br>  No  So how about  It really isn't time. This season is shit.  I'm loving that bara-ness of Ushio. If Tora didn't look like he came out of a 90s comic book (and wasn't a furfag, let's be honest) I could see there being plenty of doujins where Tora forcefully 'eats' Ushio. <br><br>Does Tora have a human form and, more importantly, is it cute?</br></br>  <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>You're just being picky, anon.</br>   Why can't Rui just be loved tenderly?    <br>We see a man orgasm on-screen and this season is supposed to be shit?</br>  Which Tenkai would you Knight?  <br>Because traps deserve to suffer</br>  <br>None. They look a little underdeveloped.</br>  <br>The only thing missing this season is a decent sport series with qt boys, but other wise we got all tastes filled.</br>  Anyone else start playing this? It's an actual rhythm idol boy game.<br>Some of them are cute.</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>IB is best idols</br>  When's HQ coming bach?  <br>That was a surprise.</br>  <br> this face right after while the shower soundclip was still running </br>  <br>I don' have any devices that can play the game.<br><br>Also fuck off to<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  I like how this season continues to omnipander.  Would you let Leo be your tortoise knight?  <br>Watching haremshit for its guys is only going to break your heart, anon. <br> But I'm also enjoying GATE </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br><br>It's a good week.</br></br>  <br>I wonder</br>  <br>Why would you assume I know what that is? <br>Is it an anime or a manga?</br></br>    <br>It's from Aichuu, a mobile rhythm game.</br>  <br>What could have been</br>  <br> that show </br>  <br>Try googling text from the card then,</br>  <br>Then fuck off to </br>   thread turning into /v/ again   <br>That author who does Oreimo doujin better deliver.</br>  <br> dat look <br> dat wet hair <br> dat everything <br>popped a boner</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching it for  adult characters and I love the modern military in a historical or medieval setting theme. One of my favorite anime is Zipang. </br>  <br>I wish that Ghostbusters had more than 1 cute guy in it but I'm also enjoying it.</br>  I've finally figured it out, he's just Mattsundere.  Did /a/ like K? wasn't around when it was airing but it's pretty homo. <br>Here's Green King.</br>  <br>I can't figure out which one is more dominant. He is the boss and has clearly more authority but then again sensei is older.</br>  <br> dem tiger brows </br>  I've never understood these threads.<br>It's satire right.</br>    <br>Is it on google play? I can't find it.</br>  <br>Don't forget<br> dem armpits </br></br>  <br>Just as satirical as waifu threads.<br>Which means it started out as a joke and now people mistakenly believe it's a real thing and okay.</br></br>  <br>The movie was disappointing, but I can't wait for S2. I rewatched it like 3 times.</br>  <br>Its region locked. The bitches on otome general should be able to help you get it though.</br>  <br> Shounen MC with passions outside of sports or food <br>Fucking fresh.</br></br>  <br>Maybe fucking off to /vg/ well help.</br>  <br>Also, nomination for having the most surprise homolust of the season?</br>  <br>Thanks, I'll try. I've been looking for a mobile rhythm game anyway.</br>  <br>Alright.<br>So is this shit limited to 2D. I have no idea how this works.<br>Like how lolicon doesn't translate to 3D at all, can anyone that participates in these threads explain themselves?</br></br></br>  <br> surprise <br>You should read the manga, it's pure bait.</br></br>  <br>The movie felt more like something that should have been an ova instead. Did you understand a lot of the stuff that went on in season 1? The manga has horrible art but reading in explained a lot more stuff by adding in details. It was the Green King that caused all that shit to happen in season 1.</br>  <br>Everyone on this show has brain problems.</br>  <br> So is this shit limited to 2D. <br>This is a given.</br></br>  <br>Chapter 1 reads like a BL manga.</br>  <br> surprise </br>  <br>It's hardly a surprise, though the premise might sound like it's reverse harem. But it barely focuses on the fact MC is a girl and hasn't had romance so far. It's more bros being bros shonen manga.</br>  <br>I did but I don't remember it being this homo.</br>  <br>Does it have a female mc?</br>  <br>The mc is female yes</br>  <br>He's so depraved.</br>  It's time to post your husbando!  <br>Can I post my son instead?</br>  <br>This thread is off to a good start.</br>  <br>Bl needs more diverse art styles</br>  <br>It sure is.</br>  <br>Hmm, looking back he is extremely depraved.  I hope he gets the mob doujins he deserves </br>  <br> fujos <br> watching shoujo  <br>I doubt he'll get anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Summer is the best time of the year, after all.</br>  <br>Technically it's shounen, but you're probably right anyway.</br>  <br>Who looks exactly like a boy 100% of the time. There are certain implicit leanings here.</br>  <br>That's not shoujo though<br>It's "neo-shonen", aka shonen that most likely still panders to girls(see Kuroshitsuji).</br></br>  <br>Tora is a qt oversized cat, do not sexualize him.</br>  <br>You need to relax. Why don't you lay down right over there.</br>  <br> neo-shonen <br>Why do you have to invent new terms if you can just call it shoujo?<br><br>Monthly GFantasy might as well call itself shoujo since by now 90% of its target audience is girls. <br><br>ffs, Switch, Saiyuki, Pandora Hearts, Nabari no Ou and Kimi to Boku ran in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This show is shit though. Only watching because some anon told me that there will be shota suffering in the future.</br>  <br>Wow sounds like it's demographic is shoujo.</br>  <br><br><br>MC is so fuckin ugly.</br></br></br>  <br>He looks roofied.</br>  <br>Okay. I just hope we at least see more of this delinquent.</br>  <br> Yes he does </br>  <br>So even if you call those shoujo, what does that have to do with  ? G Fantasy's titles are popular among fujoshi.</br>  <br> Ranpo kittan threads are somehow gayer than homothread </br>  Yo homodachi, any of you interested in some typesetting?  <br>Not really. You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos. Besides, he looks a lot cuter in the manga.</br>  <br>Ouran got some doujins back then, they were all terrible but still.</br>  <br>And he is even uglier in the manga.</br>  <br>Why are they so LONG?</br>  <br>I think he's cute</br>  <br> You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos <br><br>No man, I'm just not blind.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking LONG </br>  <br>This doujin was great.</br>  <br>I think he's really cute.</br>  <br> fujo design <br>He looked like Sousuke on manga cover.</br></br>  <br>Actually in that image he looks fine, if only the rest of the show was drawn that well.</br>  <br>Well, Sousuke is cute.</br>  <br>Wrong Sousuke though.</br>  <br>Then you should've posted who you meant, dumbass.</br>  <br>Everybody knows which Sousuke dumbass.</br>  Myreadingmanga died?  <br>No?</br>  <br>Oh god, CLAMP has a problem.</br>  <br>Because they're not 15</br>  My homo-meter was off the charts this chapter   cutest boy is gone <br><br>Suddenly there is no reason to watch it anymore.</br></br>  <br>nope.</br>   3745HOUSE new doujin out <br><br><br>Uh? Sensei still there.</br></br></br>  <br>That's some weak trolling there, dumbass.</br>  <br>What are you saying, Kaitocchi is still very much present.</br>  <br> cutest boy is gone <br>Something happened to the teacher?</br></br>  <br>Why use it? Basically everything on it is on sadpanda</br>  <br><br><br><br>Jesus christ get some taste. No wonder everyone is laughing at you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some aren't, and I prefer the scroll down format.</br>  Sera-sensei is a tyrant teacher and probably smells like beer and oil.  <br>Still posting worse Sousuke dumbass?</br>  <br>I prefer a guy that smells of blood, sweat, and whiskey.</br>  <br>Is it going to be KarmaxNagisa or NagisaxKayano? I'm personally rooting for  OotaxNagisa .</br>  <br>What an ugly bitch.</br>  <br>Kayano is clearly the manga endgame, but that won't stop me fapping to any good KarmaxNagisa doujins.<br>I really wish we'd get NagisaxKarma sometime too.</br></br>  <br>At least someone is posting a Sousuke dumbass</br>  <br> everything on it is on sadpanda <br><br>A lot of translated manga and doujins aren't. Site is good, if you ignore the terrible layout and users.</br></br></br>  <br>He sure is. Makes him even more moe.</br>  <br> Manlets </br>  <br>You are wasting image limit dumbass.</br>  <br>They also make me smile</br>  <br>And you still haven't posted the Sousuke you were thinking of, dumbass</br>  <br>No, it makes him shit.</br>  <br>Manlets are cute</br>  <br>No need to post the obvious dumbass.</br>  <br><br>Can you faggots fuck off?</br></br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Old post, but am I looking at this wrong? He looks like he has a bustle, or dislocated hip.</br>    <br>Thanks for agreeing that GATE MC is cute.</br>  <br>He means Sousuke from Free. Hence why he quoted the thing about fujo bait. Now both of you can shut up.</br>  <br>And there's this faggot.</br>  <br>Almost forgot about this. I thought they'd reveal Nagare's design in the anime as some sort of surprise and not earlier.</br>  <br>He's as ugly as Sousuke still better than FMP Sousuke though.</br>  Thanks to the anon that mentioned Gakuen Ouji last thread. Shit's crazy. Nobunaga a shit but he has some serious homolust.  <br>So which Sousuke were you thinking of? Because this Sousuke is pretty cute too.</br>  <br> You're welcome! </br>  <br><br>He's wearing a dress. He's just holding side of it out.</br></br>  <br>He's better as a shota.</br>  <br>Already mentioned dumbass.</br>  <br>You haven't posted him yet.</br>  <br><br>Everyone is better as shota duh</br></br>  <br>Most bad boys are.</br>  <br>I thought it was strange too. He has a really cool design though. along with his priest and shota. Sorta wish Munakata didn't beat him to the punch of making Fushimi a clansmen. He would have fit in well with the greens.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>REJOICE</br>  <br>So it WAS Aizen all along!</br>  <br>Deaf moe is cute.</br>  <br>That's some Aizen tier trolling right there.</br>  <br> Kotomine is now the same voice of another Best Priest. </br>  <br>No you're Aizen!</br>  <br>I don't think he's moe but Nic sure is hot.</br>  <br> MFW he speaks. <br><br>I never thought having a speech impediment could be so sexy.</br></br></br>  What do I say to people who think having more than one husbando is perfectly fine?  <br>Call them a slut.</br>  <br>I call them out for the sluts that they are.</br>  <br>You join them.</br>  <br>Tell them not to use words they don't understand.</br>  <br>Leave them to their delusions and then go back to feeding your husbando.</br>  <br>It's perfectly fine.</br>  <br><br>Slut</br></br>  <br><br>You cum guzzling whores.</br></br>  I didn't like this that much but the new cover is so nice I'm tempted to buyfag it.  <br><br>I love cumming in my pure husbandos.</br></br>  <br> husbandos <br>Don't use words you don't understand.</br></br>  <br>I thought I was the only one who didn't like the story. Art's nice though.</br>  <br>Tell them having more than one husbando will ruin their laifusbando.</br>  <br>I love all my husbandos.</br>  <br>Or more than one husbando is a bad endo.</br>  <br>I would've liked it better if Shun hadn't been such a shit. <br>Mio getting character development out of nowhere didn't help either. He lost a lot of charm.</br></br>  The staff really, really likes these guys. This episode had a bunch of anime-original touchy-feely shenanigans. <br>I'm dying to know what they're doing in the pot in the ED since they're facing away from the viewer.</br>  Which sword would you  polish?   <br>The on-topic one.<br><br> Fuck that's lewd. </br></br></br>  <br>Lewd swords are best swords.</br>  <br>The one that belongs in /vg--<br>oh wait your swordshit general is dead because your game fucking sucks.</br></br>  <br>Kill those abominations.</br>  I didn't expect to like this guy as much as I do now. I can't wait for his suffering to begin.  <br>I didn't expect to like any character, or even the show itself, as much as I do. Truly glad I picked it up.</br>  It was  okay.   <br>Same here. Even  imouto  is growing on me.</br>  <br>I like him too, the sol scenes with the teleportation guy and him are great. The whole cast is really nice to watch.</br>  <br>Alright, I'll bite.</br>  <br><br>What's the target audience for this show? I was expecting the two guys to get paired up with the girls but it feels more like the two guys and the two girls are getting paired up among themselves.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/833992/2c2c79<wbr>6cd7/</wbr>    <br>Megane's autism is so endearing.</br>  <br>Might be omnipandering.  I know this isn't the thread for this, and I'm usually no yurifag, but I have to say that the two girls seem cute together. Kind of wish it were real rather than just ED fanservice. <br><br><br> I can't figure out which one is more dominant. <br>I think it's pretty clear, since Kaito barely acts his age and Nagisa pretty much curbstomps his enthusiasm given the slightest chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dropped CG but moeducer was really a gem boy there. Glad he got noticed.</br>  <br>I hope we have time for his backstory.<br><br>By the way, are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones?</br></br></br>  <br>I am, but first I need to learn how.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure, if fujoshi jump on this, Kaito will be the one on top.</br>  <br>I never saw HS for this one so I don't how they compare, but subs for every other HS show have been pretty shitty, so I'm sure these are better.</br>  i waited 3 months to see this moe face again, and i was not disappointed  <br>Is this shit still being translated?</br>  <br> are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones? <br>I haven't seen CR's script aside from the pastebin with the mistranslations from episode 1, but judging from that I'd call the other option better.</br></br>  <br>That one's the sequel, so no. <br>Someone's typesetting the old one right now, don't know if it's completed yet.</br></br>  <br>Going to buyfag it for the art. I'm probably going to buyfag all her works.</br>  <br> To be honest the suffering was the only reason I picked up the manga.</br>  Please tell me this semen demon shows up again at some point.  <br> Everyone in this story returns at some point. <br>Also Obi is best girl.</br></br>       MILF <br>I'm out.</br>  new tanks out<br><br>Unreal, Tenma, Megastore Alpha and Comic LO.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/830692/be92cb<wbr>8596/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830694/385e36<wbr>357f/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830697/8ff738<wbr>702f/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/833654/61d561<wbr>ea39/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>anon, surely you don't have shit taste?</br>  <br>kill yourself, my man</br>  <br>I know the one you're talking about, but I can't remember the name.

Is there a contract or something?  <br>What you're looking for was by bobobo. So yes it was removed.</br>  <br>Because they hire him to do it. That's a really silly question.</br>  <br><br><br>I wish he'd actually do a real chapter every now and then. Something like the good old days: with useless clothing and public sex.</br></br></br>  I really enjoy super long 200+ page stories in my porn. Anyone have any favorites they care to share?  Fakku announced 4 new book licenses today<br><br>[Naruko Hanaharu] Shoujo Material<br>[Bosshi] Asoberu Karada<br>[Takeda Hiromitsu] Ima Real<br>[Kisaragi Gunma] A Straight Line to Love</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bosshi <br> Takeda Hiromitsu <br>does anybody seriously fap to those artists?</br></br></br>  My personal favorites, couldn't fit all the links in one post. If any fetish category seems to have a lot of doujins, it's because they're part of a long running series, or because I like the artist who happens to focus on one fetish. All of them are also in English.<br><br>http://pastebin.com/5N0LnR7q</br></br>  <br> being an eromanga hipster </br>  <br>You have  shit taste . I've fapped to those artists quite literally thousands of times.</br>  <br> boring vanilla <br> finally something new but same artist they did already <br> already translated but better <br> boring vanilla by the sameface master <br><br>This giant list of shit they can do and they are still picking shit that was already translated or artists that they already did. Wonder if wani is only giving them a small selection of artists to pick because of certain deals with the others.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shoujo Material <br> vanilla <br>Is it fun lying on the internet?</br></br></br>  <br> implying any of those aren't sameface artists </br>  <br> Not fapping to Takeda Hiromitsu <br>Wat?</br></br>  <br> having such bad taste <br>shoujo material is one of the most incredible hentai ever produced. that title alone puts fakku on a different level</br></br>  <br>It's just the same people trying to find any excuse they can to criticize fakku. they be grasping at straws at this point.</br>  <br><br>Ima Ria's a good pick, but Takeda is more well known now thanks to Maken-ki, so it's not an unsafe choice.</br></br>  <br>Isn't shoujo material that book the artist made millions off of?</br>  <br>Okay jacob and/or daiz.<br><br>People totally never shit on people's taste in artists in any other situations. Only when it pertains to fakku, yep. Stop being so defensive, you make it too obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if it's just because of that book, but there was an article once that said that Naruko Hanaharu was a millionaire</br>  <br>I don't really understand why people support fakku<br><br>they helped nuked galleries for books they'll never release. They have 9 fucking books in their store while the wani bullshit removed literally thousands of galleries.</br></br></br>  <br> grasping at straws <br>You used the argument a lot by now. You have to be the same guy because I heard this a lot in these threads.</br></br>  <br>People just grasp at a lot of straws in these threads</br>  <br>Yeah, according to a TV show it sold over a million copies. The nips were really surprised by it and didn't believe it, so I'm not sure whether to believe it or not, I dunno how credible the show itself is, and it's not like Hanaharu himself was on there or anything (though Igumox was).</br>  <br>They'll get around to it. Eventually. Hope you still like fapping to hentai in 2060 when they finally catch up on their backlog.</br>  <br><br>That's why I'm kind of pissed that they want to enter talks with MORE publishers. Why? Forget that Wani's been around since the 70s, just go back as far as 2010 and you still have more material available than Fakku could release for years, even with an increased release schedule with a larger staff. They literally cannot even offer Wani's recent catalog in a decent time frame and yet they want to fuck up more stuff.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck, even just for the X-EROS magazine alone assuming one per month, that's gonna be like 3-4 years playing catchup.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/s/0d5be8c98e/35<wbr>894-4</wbr>  <br>You're not being fair, the only way for them to release more content is if they grow. But you won't support them because they won't release enough content. Aren't they doing xeros and kairakuten now? how big is their team, that is a massive undertaking on its own</br>  <br>yes undoubtedly I can't wait to fap to freshly released hentai from 2015 in 2060</br>  <br> replying to yourself </br>  <br> So this is where I was born from </br>  <br>Fuck off Daiz.</br>  <br>It's Bobobo, like anon told you earlier, which is removed for Wani.</br>  <br>What exactly is 'fair'?<br><br>The fact that they made their business out of pirating the work and translations of other people, and are now issuing takedowns against those people so they don't have competition on their piracy ring because they told you they're going 'legit'?</br></br></br>  <br><br>And they've been 'going legit' for a long time now. Let's see if they even remove h-manga at the end of this month like they said they were.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I wonder what it would take to get it through your thick head that they didn't have anything to do with the Wani DMCAs. Tenboro said the DMCAs came from Wani, literally every other scanlator that got them said they came from Wani. Unless your argument otherwise is that Fakku was puppeteering Wani, and even went as far as to send themselves a DMCA to cover it up.<br><br>Just drop that from your argument, because it makes you look stupid. Especially because the whole "building your fanbase on piracy" is a halfway legitimate point.</br></br></br>  <br>LIAR THERE WAS NO LOLICON OR FEMDOM IN THAT!</br>  <br>The problem it seems he has and me as well is that they are looking for other publishers to make partners with when they can't even produce a fraction of the content their current publisher has. <br><br>If they made a new partner that publisher would gain a vested interest in sending out takedowns to western sites just like wani. Then we get into the same situation with that new publisher where we get less translations of stuff it is going to take fakku years to do if they ever even get around to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you referring to yourself in third person, Jewcob? Fuck off.</br>  <br>Do we have to start with this again?</br>  <br>That anon is right. If people stopped trying to pin the takedowns on fakku which has been proven multiple times to be false they would have a lot more ground to stand on</br>  <br> I wonder what it would take to get it through your thick head that they didn't have anything to do with the Wani DMCAs <br><br>Dude, they have a contract deal with wani. They hired scanlators who basically ran blogs that barely anyone knew about. Are you fucking going to tell me that wani knew about the english translated releases of YQII, and the massive amounts of wani galleries running under pseudonyms on a handful of unremarkable websites?</br></br></br>  <br><br> still using the exact same terms to samefag and shill with <br><br>Jesus christ just fuck off already, it's so obvious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Daiz.</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/833912/3a1661<wbr>13b8/<br> 25 pages <br> 3mb <br><br>Wut.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/filena<wbr>me/1406450752439.png<br>Your other advertising thread was removed and you instantly go here, Daiz.</br></wbr></br>  <br>I saved it from that post anon, do you know how filenames work on 4chan?</br>  <br> responding to samefagging shills <br><br>Why even bother? Just ignore them and wait for them to get tired of responding to themselves, or until they get banned.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it won't have the exact same filename as your current one when I save your image.

Don't try to pass off somebody else's translational as your own, for example. Individual scanlators/groups may get mad and be melodramatic, but as long as you're clear about what you're doing they can either learn to do a better job or go fuck themselves.</br>  <br><br>I'm eagerly waiting for the next comic milf. I just hope I can find a translator for Takatsu again.</br></br>  <br>Anybody who believes that Wani wouldn't, at the very minimum, make Fakku assist in locating material hosted on scanlator blogs and places like panda as one of the conditions of the licensing agreement is painfully naive.

Wani is just a piece of shit anyway.</br></br>  <br>I was here during the purge and I remember fakku announcing their deal at the same time. Purge happened on july 24th, 2014. There's forum links of fakku where they got slammed with DMCAs in March and jacob was in talks with wani to keep their pirated content on their site by striking a deal.</br>  <br>Does Tenboro post the DMCAs he gets somewhere?</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/801871/58037b<wbr>fd64/</wbr>  <br>No, but we did get this tidbit:<br>http://forums.e-hentai.org/index.ph<wbr>p?s=&amp;showtopic=167500&amp;view=findpost<wbr>&amp;p=3446965</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> there are snakes in the grass <br>Wow</br></br>  <br>E-Hentai received takedown notices from Wani to get rid of content around the same time as everyone else in April (see eg. ). Most sites removed Wani content back then already, but E-Hentai didn't - it was just "hidden" in the secret club. That's why they got a second takedown later, after which they actually removed the content. So in reality the purge already started months earlier, it just took a bit longer until it actually reached the panda.</br>  I know this isn't /r/ but I'm in dire straits, I need anything with eye bags, which as I believe aren't tags on panda so I don't know where to start.  <br> MILFs edition. <br><br>Oh yiss</br></br></br>  <br>Why not jus say Mother's edition.<br><br>I dislike the term MILF.

Generally speaking the likelihood of getting hit by enforcement directly correlates with how convenient the method of piracy is. That's been the case for a long time, really.</br>  <br>It's terribly rude though.</br>  <br> tfw when Daiz files a DMCA against himself for stuff being on Nyaa </br>  <br>Couldn't have anything to do with Jacob saying he hated that hentaikey site e-hentai. And thus would probably have no problems with these threads being removed from the board he said he likes so much.</br>  <br>The possibility would be almost zero if you weren't in these threads though.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277350 <br>That's a nice little cum puddle.</br>   joe posting in the otherchan panda threads as well <br><br>It's the same shit everywhere.</br></br>  <br>Maximum_Shill</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277350 <br>Source?<br>Kind of reminds of Mizuryu Kei.</br></br>  <br>I didn't even have anything to do with this particular case.<br><br>Besides that, I've been in these threads long before I started working for FAKKU, and I see no reason to suddenly stop coming here just because of that fact.</br></br></br>  <br> I didn't even have anything to do with this particular case. <br><br>yes buddy I'm sure you didn't</br></br></br>  <br> with this particular case. <br> implying you've had something to do with other cases. <br>I knew it.</br></br></br>  Wait, did this happen because the link was posted too soon or just because it was Fakku(tm)?<br><br>If someone posted, for example, an old Fakku release in another thread would it still be bombed?<br><br>This is scary as fuck, you know, I've never seen something like this happening.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except this is the first time something like this has happened here.</br>  <br>It's just because it's Fakku.

My only fear is that it might expand to other occasions.</br></br>  <br>An entire panda thread was deleted after someone posted a link to fakku stuff. This just seems to have been removed from the catalog.</br>  <br>It's the first rule of the site, so go figure.</br>  <br>It's still in the catalog if you have the thread pinned, like I do.</br>  <br>the thread is still in the catalog; the content in op's post has just been deleted</br>   tfw fakku is oppressing you   HorribleScans when?  How can you tell if what you're posting is copyrighted, specifically from Fakku? I don't want to tack on a DMCA to my ISP history.  <br>If it's uncensored it's probably a fakku release</br>  <br>HorribleScans has already existed for some time anon.

Just look for the thread without an image.</br>  <br>Oh Jewcob, the irony.</br>  I'm certainly interested in Fakku's release of TiTiKEi since it was previously fan translated by YQII and now it's professionally translated by YQII. I wonder how much he's changed his translation.  <br> Implying a ban would stop anyone on 4chan </br>  From now on I will only fap to pirated fakku stuff, every day.  <br>Hey guess what? The image you just posted is wani. Enjoy your prison sentence.</br>  Who cares about Fakku guys. Yeah they're jews but that's the world we live in today. Just ignore them and enjoy what you have.  <br> OP had started the thread for the purpose of linking to a FAKKU book, though. <br>He only asked if this thing was copyrighted, he didn't even know the fucking name, how was he supposed to know that?<br>It's not even a case of some vanilla doujins being taken down, but talking about them is now prohibited as well.</br></br></br>   File deleted <br>Janitors having a giggle.<br><br>And considering OP also didn't have the common courtesy of putting Sadanda in any field no one who is getting into /a/ now will find this thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Daiz killed him because Kino banned him for advertising.</br>  <br>In other words, it's just as difficult to get into as sadpanda itself. Extremely simple, but too much for many.</br>  <br> A thread made for linking to a website made for illegally obtaining unlicensed things linked to something for illegally obtaining licensed content <br><br>Shit man, we may as well just stop having Sad Panda threads</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, that's just the beginning.<br>No more threads about any anime or manga unless you can prove that you legally acquired it.<br>Also, no images from either.<br>kek.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'M ON YOUR SIDE ANONS! <br> hehe they bought it </br></br>  Thanks /v/ for fucking everything once again, fuck you dumb niggers, I wish I could report all this shills using the MOTHERFUCKING no shill report.

Specially JAcob, he hates the panda.</br></br>  <br>Is there any reason to stay on 4chan left?</br>  <br>Uhh well considering requests belong on  which is actually against the rules, that's probably why it was removed</br>  <br>He did, in both subject and comment.</br>  <br>Only if you want an alive imageboard.</br>  <br>Not like Sad panda threads have any effect on hentai. These threads could die and that wouldn't change a thing.</br>  <br>Wrong.<br>These threads are most sole source of HENTAI NEWS for most people.</br></br>  It was also removed on the archive. Really sad that fakku jews care that much when most of their site is filled with pirated content. Really, really sad.  <br>Hentai News Network when?</br>  <br>Hopefully never.</br>  <br> most people <br>Ahahahahahaha</br></br>  <br> alive imageboard <br> have to browse with an 1000+ term filter list to filter out all of the normalfags, newfags, shills, 3dpd, tumblrinas, etc. <br><br>4chan is dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends if you look at english translated hentai or not. If not then yah probably nothing but if you do I can say, as someone directly involved on occasion, a good amount of stuff wouldn't have been translated without these threads.</br>  <br>Except fakku people of course, they browse /h/.<br><br>It's either that or waiting one hour for a single reply that doesn't even mean shit.</br></br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/834178/1c8c63<wbr>21b2/<br><br>2CUTE</br></br></wbr>  Quoting Tenboro: See?

Normal deleted posts always show up on the archive, in this case it was more like the contents of the post just got wiped, which I guess the archive updated.</br>  <br>I agree, I do so much more enjoy waiting for 100 replies that don't mean shit.

Why does Kiyoshi get all the fine bitches?  Tell that to Hiramoto  <br>Does it already count as a generic harem series?</br>  she already does that fine just by her self   check Gelbooru <br> nothing but Meiko porn <br><br>This is how it should be.</br></br></br>  <br><br>no it doesnt, Hana is the only girl that likes Kiyoshi after 180 fucking chapters</br></br>  <br>but mari is also confirmed entranced by kiyoshi's ass</br>  <br>Who is Chiyo?</br>  <br>someone who friendzoned kiyoshi early on</br>  <br>But she was jealous when that whole Kiyoshi/Mari thing went down.</br>  <br>that was only supposed to look like jealously to fool the readers. it was later explained that she was honestly worried for mari as she was rumoured to have become a slut</br>  <br>More like worried about her sisters honor and school reputation.</br>  <br> seeing that her man is happy wearing chiyo's headband she changes her mind and forces him to keep her panties on <br>Hana is the only girl who has displayed jealously in the series so far...oh there's Risa too</br></br>  <br> citation needed </br>  <br><br>Because he had great taste</br></br>  <br>That was never touched on again. It was a gateway into getting her to kiss his ass. The entire point of that scene was to humiliate mari after all the bullshit she did at the start.</br>  <br>She was only worried about mari this has been discussed a lot.</br>  <br>are you serious? did you completely miss the poison sucking chapters?<br><br><br>it was confirmed back then with the flashback and mari's behaviour (she got horny while sucking kiyoshi's ass)</br></br></br></br>  <br> That was never touched on again. <br>it's akira we are talking about here. you can bet that he hasn't forgotten about that</br></br>  <br>if its akira were talking about then you can expect something that completely shatters your expectations, she could find an even better guys ass. I recall gakuto having quite an ass.</br>  <br>fair enough, but so far my point still stands.<br>In addition, she's going to spend more time with kiyoshi than the other boys in the next few chapters because of the cavalry battles</br></br>  <br>And glasses bro girl, she cried and shit when she thought he was taken away by joe</br>  <br>But that still doesn't mean she likes him, so until proven differently her or chiyo doesn't have romantic feeling for him. Hell I, not even sure if Mari even likes him as a person</br>  So i started reading this after putting it off for ages and..<br>Jesus christ, I get the feeling I'm reading the wrong translation.</br>  <br>Because of a nice ass? What his father told her was that any guy with a nice ASS! can't be a bad person, not that she should fall for any guy with a a nice ass.</br>  <br>That guy must be joking.</br>  <br> Tyranny </br>  <br>I never said that she fell for kiyoshi, I was talking about his ass.</br>  <br><br>So you're saying that you think Kiyoshi has a nice ass?</br></br>  <br><br>Easily yes.</br></br>  So why did Mari start hating her dad?  <br>Mine is better.</br>  <br>I guess I am..</br>  <br>The only thing we know is because hes a pervert.</br>  <br>Try to guess.</br>  <br> implying she doesn't have a repressed father complex </br>  <br>perhaps his indiscretions caused a divorce?</br>  <br>Whoah, wait a minute. Is it already Monday? Japanese raws were already released?</br>  <br>yup</br>  <br><br>She didn't understand the ass mans life.</br></br>  <br>everyone has a brain fart once in a while.<br>this happens when you don't hire proofreaders.</br></br>  <br> Utopia hasnt even done 183 yet <br><br>Yes i know it was translated but still.</br></br></br>  <br>Their site has been down for days as well.</br>  <br>Do people not understand what a harem is? If there are two girls then it's just a triangle. Mari has not shown any interest in Kiyoshi. Chiyo is debatable, but not really.<br><br>I also disagree with the anon who said that Hana's only interested in him sexually. Obviously she's interested in him romantically, why else would she have snatched the headband from Chiyo or let him keep her underwear on? I mean, really.</br></br></br>  <br> or let him keep her underwear on? <br>she didn't "let" him, she forced him to keep her underwear on after witnessing his happy face while wearing chiyo's headband</br></br>  <br>He didn't resist &amp; agreed to it so he wasn't forced to do shit.<br><br>Also, doesn't change the fact that she has romantic feelings for him.</br></br></br>  <br>She probably got into some embarrassing situations for the ethical asspects her dad taught her.</br>  <br>  doesn't change the fact that she has romantic feelings for him. <br>I wasn't really trying to confute that<br> He didn't resist &amp; agreed to it so he wasn't forced to do shit. <br>he didn't object because his head was still spinning after all the concentrated shit happened in the previous chapters but hana clearly told him to keep her underwear on no matter what</br></br></br></br>  <br>So did Kate have a tight butt Mari get herself into?</br>  <br> Do people not understand what a harem is? <br>They do. Controversial posts just help to get a discussion going.</br></br>  Probably my favorite page  <br>No wonder most male MC are beta seeing that page it's the best mix of being in love and being serious for the girl.</br>  <br>His head was not spinning, that was the<br>Point of the scene w/Gakuto.</br></br>  <br>but that's what he keeps repeating himself in ch 184</br>  So Hana has to win right?<br><br> She has pictures of them making out. They've pissed all over each other. Unless Hana is ready to get into some freaky shit and accept that the guys has been macking with another broad, Hana should be the default winner </br></br>  <br> My brain isnt working <br><br>Just means hes still thinking about things.</br></br></br>  <br> unless hana <br>Chiyo</br></br>  <br>He went from being scared of Chiyo to finding his resolve and declaring that he still likes her. That's a complete 180 of earlier.</br>  <br>Hana has to come out &amp; be honest, I think. Once she can do that then maybe, but I'm kinda hoping that Kiyoshi &amp; Chiyo do it first &amp; it doesn't work out. Who knows with this manga though?</br>  <br>He wasnt scared of chiyo herself, he was scared of the idea of corrupting her which is why he says stay away from me. What declaration?</br>  <br>yes but what does that have to do with my post? my only point is that hana genuinely likes kiyoshi. As you mentioned, Kiyoshi is still going after chiyo</br>  <br><br>He's chasing an ideal girl that doesn't exist. But that's ok, in the end, his Id will prevail.</br></br>  <br>Hana has so has Chiyo.</br>  <br>I don't know, it depends whether akira wants to drag things out or not. he might give in to anime fags (if sales go well) and turn the series into a more conventional harem series by adding chiyo and maybe mari to kiyoshi's harem for real</br>  <br>No they havent. Hana at least gives him huge clues but neither chiyo nor hana have directly come out and told him.</br>  <br>It's not their fault he suffers from MCitis <br><br>literally can't be any more forward<br> Grope me as much as you want <br> My sisters a slut if she's trying to get you <br><br>vs<br> Show me your dick <br> Make out sessions <br> Pissing on each other <br> General jealousy <br><br>Coming out and saying it would just be pointless at this stage</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was scared of corrupting her, b/c he thought he was corrupted.</br>  <br> Grope me as much as you want <br>You're misinterpreting this scene completely. If she actually wanted him to grope her she wouldnt have started crying. This is the penultimate result of her sisters flashback thinking of "You can't understand it until you try it" and chiyo constantly repeating "Its settled my sister really is a slut".</br></br>  <br><br>I doubt it, but it's possible. It would certainly be disappointing, as has had very little actual interaction with anyone besides Hana.</br></br>  Just started reading this yesterday, and shit's gotten really fucking bad since the introduction of the real student council. The whole plot is now moving on retarded yaoi and SM antics for the boys, and SLUT MISUNDERSTANDINGS for the sisters and MC. The fabled ass-man turned out to be a pussy-ass bitch too<br><br>Its almost unbelievable how this manga turned into complete shit in just this arc</br></br>  I love the mango, but why can't I get myself to watch the anime?  <br>Stop reading it then.</br>  <br>  JC Staff <br><br>It's okay</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good point. If she liked Kiyoshi she would not have done that. I wonder if the scenes with Chiyo seeming that she suspects them are really going to be a red herring or she ends misinterpreting them. Though it can't be a coincidence that she keeps interrupting them. She, almost seems like the antagonist to their progress.</br>  Someone can translate the title of chapter 183 for me please?  <br>She is an urine slut.<br><br><br>He lied about that.<br><br><br> not even sure if Mari even likes him as a person <br><br>Why would you think that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Theres a huge buildup of misunderstandings and jumping to her own conclusions with her. Shes going to be completely disappointed when nobody gives a shit about her birthday in the way she thinks everyone is preparing for it. It sounds like a buildup to where we see a darkside to her that kiyoshi will mostly likely not enjoy at all and start to wonder.</br>  What's going to be really awesome about this anime is that while a good portion of them will start to do that shit where they start off strong &amp; end pretty weak this one will have a solid ending.  So will fugly get NTR'd?   There is no such thing as a bad sumo-love <br> There is no such thing as a bad crow-lover <br> There is no such thing as a bad Ass lover  <br><br>Sumo is the mother<br>Crows are the sister<br>Ass is the father<br><br>So what's Chiyo's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking it </br>  <br>Because even if she does show him more respect for how much he has help her she still doesn't seem to trust or like him. It feels like she's waiting for him to fuck up so she can start hating him again</br>  <br>change ring</br>  <br> not liking yaoi and SM antics </br>  <br><br>no wait, I think it's "changeling" from the movie</br></br>  <br>don't make /v/ tier threads</br>  <br> her whole character is built upon assumptions and jumping to conclusions, think about even since her first introduction <br> seen MC easer and assumed he liked sumo also <br>  jump to the conclusion that since he (faked) like sumo and help a crow he couldn't had peeked on the girls and wasn't a bad person  <br>  seen he had her outfit and assumed he was a pervert, turned him in and act him in trouble  <br>  assumed her sister was a slut <br> assumed the boys actually cared enough about her to find out about her Bday and make her a gift <br>  assumed the mc wanted his blankets on the floor folded and that they weren't for a reason  <br> assumed the panties belonged to glasses bro  <br>Etc basically she's a plain person who usually makes situation worse with her assumption</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Changeling is a 2008 American drama film, written by J. Michael Straczynski and directed, co-produced and scored by Clint Eastwood, that explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, political corruption, mistreatment of mental health patients, and the repercussions of violence.<br> female disempowerment, mistreatment of mental health patients, and the repercussions of violence. <br><br>sounds about right</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no such thing as a bad  liar. </br>  <br>its fine when it doesn't stall a heated arc for 40 chapters<br>I can't stand watching those faggots episodically build that rocket with retarded Andre running around anymore</br></br>  <br>I agree with the slut-arc, could have been shorter. <br><br>The boys building the PBR instead of an actual simple bottle rocket was fucking hilarious and completely in-character, one of these pooped his pants in front of the whole class, the other one got naked and placed a bottle on his penis in front of his girlfriend and the third one was planning to run bound in ropes into the girls' changing room. They're fucking retarded.<br><br>It starts gaining momentum again, don't worry.<br>Also why the fuck do you think the assman is a bitch?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoyed Andre at the start, now I feel as though he ruins any panel he's in.</br>  <br>Cause his character lives from Meiko.The confident one.</br>  <br><br>Meiko got annoying as well, with all the fucking sweating.</br></br>  <br> Also why the fuck do you think the assman is a bitch? <br>His daughter's best friend (also his student) gets abused into mindbreak and he won't take his own daughter's word on that. She needs help, not get locked alone in a room<br>And then there's rumors all over the school about his daughters being sluts, and they also get bullied for that.</br></br></br>  <br>mari treated him like a bitch through the whole first arc and he took it without putting her in her place. guy's down with midlife crisis, he needs to get back on track sure.</br>  <br>*soon, not sure</br>   such a talented artist spends his time drawing perverted high school stories <br>And not a day goes by that I don't thank the gods that there are people like this in the world.</br>  <br><br>wait for bd</br></br>  <br>Thx ;D , ahhh and this frase on vice abdomen?</br>  <br>I mean, she caught him red-handed with literally porn. The Chairman's hijinks are one of the things that make this manga so special for me.</br>  <br>Did she enjoy getting peed on?</br>  <br>well, he should have explained to her that there's nothing wrong with porn. catching him is not the problem, the problem is her thinking he's doing something wrong</br>  <br>Mari was right.<br>It is wrong to be caught like that.</br></br>  <br>Mari wasn't right. She wasn't mad that she caught him. She was mad he was reading porn, regardless if he got caught or not, because she considers porn something bad. Which is really dumb.</br>  <br>No she wasnt. What he does in his free time is none of her god damn buisness.</br>  So did Chairman cheat on his wife is that why Mari hates him?  <br>I have the feeling it's either that or a boy did something bad/pervy to mari. In both cases it'd be really poor and cheap, I hope the mangaka can come up with something better than this.</br>  <br>something like: "in the end, the style is going to match the fashion"</br>  <br><br>God is faces on women have gotten so shit.<br><br>I loved his realistic approach in the early chapter, he's gone more and more animu with each chapter, chapter 250 will have them with no fucking noses.</br></br></br></br>  <br> being caught watching porn at work  <br>that's not exactly his free time</br></br>  <br>Not in the school which would not matter if he had not been caught.</br>    <br> weekly issues <br> better art than monthly issued manga <br>how does he do it?</br></br></br>  <br>He loves what he does and it shows.</br>   I can't pee when I have an erection <br><br>that's incorrect...</br></br>  <br>A lot of backgrounds and props are photographs.</br>  <br>I want to believe. I want to believe that Chiyo's character is going to turn around at some point.<br><br>Reading back in the story there's a lot of foreshadowing &amp; mirroring. Maybe that scene with her during the Sumo thing is a sign of things to come when she realizes that everyone lied to her, especially Kiyoshi?</br></br></br>  <br>If you seriously think mari was mad because he was reading porn in school, as opposed to reading porn in general, your reading comprehension is in the negatives.</br>  <br>I think it's way less than you think. If anything he rises a lot of panels aside from the flashbacks.</br>  <br>*reuses</br>  <br>It does matter where you read your porn.</br>  The fact the author is sexualizing Hana more in the latest chapters doesn't bode well, so far the only reason to believe she might have won was the fact that she's the only one that hasn't show her tits.  <br>not to mari. she's mad at porn regardless of where.<br>besides, a principal who's alone in his office room reading porn might be a little in poor taste, but it's not like it's morally reprehensible. still, the point stays, location was not the reason for mari's reaction.</br></br>  <br>Well, he also writes that manga about Robert Johnson, he's pretty versatile.</br>  <br>Wtf are you talking about? Hasn't the author been specializing Kiyoshi too?! Hasn't the big joke with Hana that they have been having sexy time together?</br>  <br>Dumbest post of the day award goes to....</br>  Link to the raws?  <br>Hana will steal all the MC's first but Chiyo will still win</br>  <br>This , being hana is suffering.<br>Funny suffering.</br></br>  <br>*sexualizing</br>  <br> tfw Hana is his first girlfriend too </br>  <br>Thank you ;D</br>  <br> Hana is his first wife </br>  LIVE I TELL YOU<br><br>LIVE FOR THE SAKE OF HANA</br></br>  This thread is lacking Hana expressions.   karate <br>of course it had to be the dane cook of martial arts</br>    <br> Claims GF status <br> Takes his first time <br> Forces to take responsibility <br> First divorce as well <br><br>Chiyo - A man who takes responsibility can't possibly be evil!<br><br>The end</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone fucking forgets that the only reason Kiyoshi is still in school is because of Chiyo that threatened to quit too.  <br>If you aren't that bothered now you might as well wait until the BDs and try watching again.</br>  <br>He stayed because of her breasts.</br>  <br>I forget most of the details about the story.</br>  <br>I really don't remember almost everything.</br>  Reminder that Hana lusts for Kiyoshi's D on a daily basis  <br>Well he also grew the resolve to stay because he had goals like the wet-tshirt contest.</br>  <br>medusa cant come soon enough</br>  <br>I'm half tempted to get that 1/7th scale figure of Hana to make her pose with dat medusa</br>   yfw Prison School becomes the SAO of this season <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oIS<wbr>iuPK3l04</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Why do people always run to SAO as the first comparison?<br><br>SAO is by no means a decent example of literature, 2 years of semen glopping endlessly into mainstream popularity is all it has going for it.</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to know, was the 2 years line really in the ln?</br>  <br>why are they talking so much in the first few seconds with nothing happening? is that how people watch anime?</br>  <br> 1/7th Hana figure with medusa pussy <br><br>I'd buy the shit out of it</br></br></br>  <br>It's been out since december, it just cost like $160+, i might buy one early august off amazon. Even comes with a bottle prop and some other stuff</br>  <br><br>That was hilarious, thanks.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit, it's true! This is the single greatest fucking thing ever!</br>  <br>they are on jcafe</br>  <br>mmh, it ain't that bad, you just need to get through the beginning of the new arc, it gets better again after a couple chapters. I mean that moment got me bored too, but really, it gets better after a while !</br>  <br> Medusa shit there. <br>Yeah way to ruin it.</br></br>  <br>it certainly is but 160$ is a bit too much for me. <br>Now I wonder why burglars in japan even bother assaulting banks and jewelry shops when they could make millions just by robbing random otakus rooms</br></br>  <br> nearly all of them are niggers. <br><br>also ? what's the point of filming yourself while watching an anime, I mean are there actually people watching those kind of videos ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I did it was pretty funny since you can emphatize with the reactions of other people.<br><br>Of course the first sitting is alone.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>good to know that you are a filthy fucking secondary lelouch you piece of shit</br></br>   kissing before marriage <br>slut</br>  <br>Yeah, why would I lie to you? There's also figures of the vice president as well. One is like huuuge and one is oddly proportioned. I'm just gonna order the Hana figure though. Maybe put some aside for a potential new figure release due to the anime.</br>  <br>I hope you are wearing your purity ring anon.</br>  <br> Do NOT sexualize the Hana. <br>hanakana was an inspired choice to voice hana. <br><br>she'd giving me a permaboner with her gangsta voice combo'ed with her genki voice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AROUND HIS DICK!</br>  Well /a/, what is your...Choice?!  Reminder that if you don't think Mari has something for Kiyoshi you're in denial  <br>More like anyone who thinks Mari has something for Kiyoshi is delusional.</br>  When will get Jo's arc where he conquers many young female hearts? He's the token harem protag of this series.  <br>The time of troubles is not yet upon us.</br>  <br>More like, if you don't think mari and a vlad-style impalement are a match made in heaven you're delusional.</br>  Kiyoshi wants to do things with girls &amp; Hana wants to do things with him. When is Kiyoshi gonna realize this?  <br>when hana starts wanting to do with him the things he wants to do with girls and not whatever her confusion invents as pee-revenge.</br>  This hana shit has dragged on long enough, why doesn't she just tell him to fuck her brains out?  The adaptation is shit so far  <br>hopefully the bd's aren't shit</br>  <br>for the same reason shingo thought putting a bottle on his dick as kiyoshi suggested was a legitimately good idea and a non-psycho like anzu would go for it, or why shingo and joe blew it with anzu and cake recently. mangaka has characters act stupider than usually to avoid making relationships</br>  <br>I think it's great.</br>  <br>But I thought illicit relationships were banned. Also, how bad would it look if a student council member &amp; prisoner were dating?</br>  <br>They arent banned unless the USC is in power. Which is why the boys helping them is a double edged sword.</br>  <br>I don't suggest they'd date in public. But announcing their interest for one another and trying to date in secret, or even off school -since not in prison anymore- would have worked for anzu/shingo. Similarly, for kiyoshi/hana, being honest with each other and then trying to hide they're dating-shenanigans ought to be the way to go, not this stupid back and forth.</br>  <br> double edged sword <br>dumb. <br>the word you're looking for is dumb. they could have asked kate to make a wet-t-shirt contest in exchange for helping her crush mari, she'd oblige happily</br></br></br>  <br>shit or not its still aoty material</br>  <br><br> The boys are dumb <br><br>Shocker.</br></br></br></br>  <br>they showed they can be pretty smart at the end of the first arc though, they shouldn't turn back to being idiots whenever the plot demands it, it feels cheap.</br>  <br>Unless Kate's side has a Chiyo no one is going to be asking her for shit.</br>  <br>Sorry that was meant for:</br>  <br>the boys =/= kiyoshi. the rest didn't give a shit about the usc and mari until kiyoshi pointed out kate didn't plan for wet-t-shirt contest. at that point, it'd make more sense to ask kate for one, than help mari.</br>  <br>They are only smart when they working towards a goal with Gakuto being the providing the true brains behind everything. I have yet to see Gakuto really move on his own. He really only moves into action, because of Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi only moves forward, because of Chiyo who fucks him over as well as aid him at the same time.</br>  <br>They can't. They can't let it be known that easily to the world that they are a bunch of perverts. They all want girlfriends, after all. They don't want to be hated. Can you imagine the chaos and destruction that would come crashing down on their asses if the girls found out WHY they are having a wet t-shirt contest? Oh, the humanity!<br>Not to mention the fact that kate obviously does not aprove of the contest (hence its disapearance from the calendar). What if she simply did not comply AND put them in jail for making such a resquest? Think of the risks and consequences!<br>Also: the courage necessary to make such request! The path they took is the only real option.</br></br></br>  <br>Working with Kate would mean being against Chiyo. Not gonna happen.</br>  <br>Good response. It takes into account that these characters are human. The other anon can't seem to grasp that small detail.</br>  <br>Not to burst your bubble, but the world (=the school) knows why they went to prison in the first arc. Everyone thinks of them as creepy perverts already, that boat has sailed.<br><br><br>I was referring to the rest of the 5, not kiyoshi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She didnt disappear anything from the calender. They have a completely different event which is clamming. Knowing this manga the wet-tshirt contest is either a lie or completely different from what the boys expect and the clamming is actually what you think is because kate is a huge fucking dyke and would be the one to do that.</br>  <br>So? They are trying to start anew &amp; meet some girls this time. Don't want to tarnish their rep even more than it already is.</br>  FUCK HANA SHE'S A SHIT<br><br>A SHIT<br><br><br>KATE A BEST</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're grasping at straws mate, the boys being viewed as non-perverts is impossible. besides, a girl who would consider being a pervert a bad thing would be a poor fit for them anyway.</br>  <br> you probably enjoy the same shows as these freaks <br> you probably have the same waifu as them <br> you probably have jerked off to their favorite hentai manga </br></br></br>  <br>It's good for the comedic scenes anyway.<br> but muh pantyshots <br>kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>When did this happen?</br>  <br>I want her to be raped by a black man</br>  <br>When they go to Kiyoshi's room to do ouroboros and Hana starts off by making a show of being as casual as possible</br>  <br> stalker <br> best <br>ayy</br></br></br>  <br>Shit, I don't remember that at all.</br>  <br>JUST<br>CUCK</br></br>  why are chapters 168-175 missing from batato   Supposing.
