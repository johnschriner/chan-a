Then why is he grabbing her ass on the promo pics and why does she look like she needs his D to survive? <br><br>Is it all just shitty fanservice or something?

I also have seen parts of her you haven't </br></br></br></br>  Say "Ahh~" Anon-kun  <br>Stop posting, Ruru.</br>  <br>Lelouch had more important things to worry about than sex.<br><br>And C.C. had fucked so much she probably didn't even care about it anymore.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't listen to the Kallencucks. They confirmed for fuck buddies. Lelouch even brags to Mao about how he's seen parts of her he has never seen. He also knows her real name, that nobody knows, and they have a literal mind-body link connection that might as well be something more than vaginal sex anyway.</br></br>  Does C.C. do anything in the show? I watched the whole thing and outside of her eating pizza she's the most forgettable character outside of the Mao arc.  <br><br>Ahh~</br></br>  <br><br>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</br></br>  <br> Lelouch even brags to Mao about how he's seen parts of her he has never seen.  <br><br>He was trying to get his goat and upset him. Mao fucked CC more times than Lelouch ever did. Heck, CC was probably molesting Mao ever since he was a kid.</br></br></br>  <br>Does saving lelouch's life numerous times count as doing anything?</br>  <br>excuse me gentleman but how is this tail attached to her ass?</br>  <br>Maybe her butt hurts?</br>  <br> le dead sister face </br>  <br>Oh silly anon, you know how.</br>  does geass work on animals?  <br><br> This obvious Kallencuck bait </br></br>   Akito Exiled episode 3 is out and subbed for about a week now <br> haven't seen a single thread on /a/ about it <br><br>I'm not even sure what I expected anymore.</br></br></br>    <br>I thought you were dead</br>  <br><br>it looks like she's eating that one pizza with the hotdogs in the crust</br></br>  <br>G-Glue?</br>  <br>typical Kallencuck fag</br>  <br>There were a couple when it came out.

It'd be anticlimactic if they just ended up being released at the end of the series without a fight. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does C.C. like pizza?<br><br>Not even good pizza, but shit tier Pizza Hut delivery, that's stuff is awful.</br></br>  <br> I like that 70s look she has. <br><br>But does she have a 70s bush?</br></br></br>  <br> implying /a/ dislikes Code Geass </br>  <br>Product endorsement.

Not solely her body.</br>  I'd rather fuck Kallen  <br>Do you really want to sit down and discuss her personality. <br><br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br><br> Hating on Shirley <br><br>Well I can see where are you coming from...<br><br><br><br> Hating on nunners <br><br>Go away Rolo, you are dead</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How good of a pilot was CC? <br><br>like tier 3.<br><br>tier 1: aces. <br>Kallen, Suzaku<br><br>tier 2: breddy good<br>Todo's crew, other rounds, Xin ke, cornelia, guilbert, akito,<br><br>tier 3: important characters with overpowered frames<br>lulu, CC, rolo<br><br>tier 4: only plot armor separates these characters from tier 5<br>tamaki, oogi, viletta, leila<br><br>tier 5: cannon fodder<br>unnamed characters that die easily</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lelouch doesn't even care about her naked body <br><br>Based</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why's C.C. always lying down?</br></br>  <br>Nunnally never appreciated her brother like Rolo did.</br>  <br>Lulu</br>  <br>Too much pizza.</br>  <br>This list is skewed. Kallen is not that good. She's only on the level of the Round Knights.<br><br>Suzaku is on a whole other level than every other pilot in the series. He would destroy anyone.</br></br></br>  KALLEN&gt;ALL<br>EVERYONE ELSE CAN EAT SHIT</br>  <br>Die</br>  <br>Fat slut<br>Just imagine how that pizza is gonna look on belly years from now.</br></br>    <br> Suzaku is on a whole other level than every other pilot in the series <br><br>what are you talking about? did you see their battle in the R2 finale? Kallen and Suzaku fight till a stalemate. They're totally evenly matched (even though Gino does say that Kallen won... let's consider his opinion biased).</br></br></br>  <br>Kallens knightmare had higher specs though.</br>  <br> Suzaku coordinates the fight perfectly so that he can fulfill all these conditions: <br><br>i. disable Kallen's mech without killing her<br>ii. take exactly enough damage to blow up his mech and fake his death<br>iii. time this perfectly so it looks like a stalemate<br><br>And all against a machine with better stats.<br><br>Did you even watch the show?<br>He would have fucking destroyed her if he was trying.<br>But he wanted to fake his own death.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, that fight isn't really a good reference for anyone's power level really, since Suzaku was only fighting to 'survive' and not to 'win', because the plan involved him being perceived as KIA.<br><br>At the very least Kallen came very, very close to killing Suzaku even with his geass, so that has to count for something.</br></br></br>  <br> official CG <br> Megami promo art <br> official </br></br></br>  <br> (Source: /a/)  <br><br>Jesus Christ.</br></br></br>  <br> so new it hurts </br>  Can you guys just please post more c.c          <br>The spec difference isn't a significant amount at all. They're both 9th gen so it is minimal at best. Plus, Suzaku himself attributes his difficulty to her own skill during the battle, so its not that big of a gap at all.<br><br><br>Suzaku and Kallen are equals.<br><br><br>Add in Orpheus and Oldrin(Protagonists from Oz the Reflection) and Bismarck to tier 1.<br>Bismarck, you have to remember, was holding his own against the Albion in an inferior KMF, and Suzaku was only able to win by using his "Live!" command. Bismarck is also shown to be so much better than Xingke when they fought.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why are so many C.C. fans so antagonistic to Kallen fans? Especially since pretty much all Kallen fans like C.C. a lot as well.  <br>Suzaku and Kallen are both aces. But i dont think they're equals.</br>  <br>Lots of hot glue, if you get my drift.</br>  <br>no one gives a fuck about Kallen</br>  Hey, CC just stole that guy's pizza!  <br>Well, thats just wrong though. One of them has never been portrayed as significantly better than the other. And theres no evidence to suggest that they aren't.</br>  <br>I do</br>  <br>His homolust pretty much led to the betrayal of the Black Knights and consequently, Lelouch's death, so fuck right out of here with that shit</br>  <br>No one gives a fuck since her character got dropped on it head on R2. Like, all that buildup she had on R1 was just gone and the bodyguard spotlight was given to Rolo</br>  <br>He earned his spot by killing that annoying cunt Shirley</br>  <br>One tragic annoying cunt getting killed by another less tragic, more annoying cunt does not make him a good character.<br><br>Shirley was a generic boring happy-go-lucky support character, but I sure as fuck would've like her getting more screen time than fucking Rolo</br></br></br>  <br>Gotta pander to the fujos. Apparently Lulu and Suzaku wasn't enough.</br>  <br>Jesus, these proportions are absolutely atrocious.</br>  <br>Yeah he kinda fucked that up/</br>  <br>I'd be fine with another fujobait.<br>I was not fine with a fujobait that happens to be the catalyst for most of the train wrecks on R2.<br>The character was solely written to be a continuous "Euphinator" plot device</br></br></br>  <br> So who is the best Geass? </br>  <br>I cry evry tiem</br>  Daily reminder that Euphie did nothing wrong.  <br>except genocide</br>  I recently finished and haven't talked about this show with you guys. Do they explain why Lelouch never seems to care about bitches? Also why did he chose such a silly hat to rule the world with in the end?  <br>He's a man that gets shit done. Bitches don't fit in the "Get shit done" part of his schedule.</br>  <br>Because he's a true manly man who cares more about his goals than bitches.</br>  <br>Did you not pay attention? <br> He spends eternity with CC </br></br>  <br><br>You'd think he'd find time between his chess games or something.<br><br>Yah she's hot, but she's kinda confirmed to be a stanky ho that was getting dicked since the 19th century. I feel he'd be above that.</br></br></br></br>   All this hate for Shirley, who is obviously best grill.   Hey /a/, I've never been here before, but I just came here to say this:<br><br>I just finished watching Attack on Titan, and the ending was such a fucking cop-out.<br>It basically answered none of the questions from earlier in the series. <br><br>It's like they set it up for a second season but never made one.<br><br>Great show apart from that though. It just ended way too soon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shounen shit aren't welcomed here, except for few like One Piece</br>  <br>What's so good about One Piece anyways? I never gave it a fair chance since all of my normie "friends" liked it and it's huge/long as fuck which makes me weary.</br>  <br>Watch the first 2 episodes. If it doesn't make you scream out<br> AWESOME <br>then it's not for you.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>one piece is certifiable garbage with an artstyle worth genociding an entire race for just to make sure it never happens again</br></br></br>  <br>two bombs weren't enough</br>  Post characters you expected to hate, but ended up liking.  Sabagebu made everyone likable. <br>It even made fat girls cute.</br>  I thought she would be really annoying, but the way she handled everything was really sweet  <br>I don't even remember who ths is</br>  <br><br>It's Ben.</br></br>  <br>This girl right here. I was totally ready to hate her guts but turn out to be a really interesting character.</br>   Oh great here we got another girl hits guy for comedy bit <br> actually that's a very serious problem <br> oh she's working on fixing it, and it really bothers her that it happens too <br> Damn her dad is a right bastard <br> the more I watch the more I notice she's really a sweetie </br></br></br></br>  First impressions are bad.  <br>Is this a grown up Nanako?</br>  <br>I still hate her, she's making finishing the first season incredibly difficult.</br>  <br><br>that a girl or a boy?</br></br>  <br>Boy.<br><br>OP didn't state girls only.</br></br></br>  <br>She would be more likeable if the writer doesn't treat punching other as a joke, when we suppose to feel sorry for her at the same time.<br>Especially when mc she hits is also psychological tortured due his sisters.</br></br>  <br>Nanako's design reminded me quite a bit of her, but they are unfortunately fairly different characters.</br>      Is there an actual project translating the novels?<br><br>Also monster girls when?<br><br>How can the racist Japanese ideology allow monster girls live and work inside society without being victims of discrimination?</br></br></br></br>  Nothing wrong with /ak/  Gate 24/7 lives on  I think my dick broke    <br>Please stop</br>    http://rule34.paheal.net/post/list/<wbr>Gate%3A_Thus_the_JSDF_Fought_There/<wbr>1 </wbr></wbr>   <br>needs more monstergirls<br><br>and more goth loli</br></br></br>  <br><br>Delilah is best girl!</br></br>  <br>gook detected</br>  <br> and then she died cold and alone with only the hallucination of her beloved coming to rescue her to comfort her <br><br> SHE COULD OF HAD IT ALL MAN </br></br></br>  <br>So Yanagida gets to tap that?</br>  <br>I hope so, he's the real victim behind Itami's actions and deserves a happy ending</br>  <br><br>Yes he does</br></br>  Shitposters are asleep post monstergirls  <br>Because those filthy monster girls are not allowed to travel to glorious Nihon.</br>  <br><br>Hide the monster girls.</br></br>  <br> could of <br>How about kill yourself?</br></br>  why not collect all monstergirls that appear in gate in a picture for rolling waifu purpose?<br><br>I would but im too stupid for it</br></br>  <br> Some of them end moving to Japan  </br>  <br>That's a big list</br>  Fluffy bunny crotch never  <br>BIG FAT RABBIT TATS</br>  So the inside of the Gate is Medieval Europe right?<br><br>But why don't the locals make remarks about the JSDF being Asians?<br><br>I'd say slanted eyes is pretty shocking, I don't see modern Japs getting along with Romans since they are so different physically yet nobody makes the remark, instead the most defining factor about them is their uniforms</br></br></br></br>  <br> So the inside of the Gate is Medieval Europe right? </br>  <br>In its society and technology more or less<br>Come on Anon let's not argue on semantics</br></br>  <br>hmmm they dont look like the normal caps that they had the school kids wear. They look sort of like bowler hats? Is that a bong influence?</br>  GATE is really bad.<br><br>Also lol at actually translating the originals because those were so racist and propagan-tastic and weird even the Nips were kinda creeped out by it- which is why GATE has gotten toned down almost every iteration.</br></br>  <br>toning down the nationalistic wank, I get it<br><br>but toning down the gore and combat to basically nothing is just awful</br></br></br>  <br>Gore costs more money and doesn't really sell a show.</br>  <br> even the Nips were kinda creeped out by it <br>as if that's something out of the ordinary, Nips are ridiculously afraid of their own military history.</br></br>  <br>Did not know GATE had monster girls. Definitely picking this up</br>  <br>Read the manga, then follow the anime and weep.</br>  <br>then what's left? no more weeb wank, no more violence and no more gore<br><br>monstergirls and cute things? whoopdee fucking doo.<br><br>I like the "culture shock" aspect of the special region and Japan colliding that came with Gate, and coming from /k/, the military wank enticed me of course. If you take out half the things I liked in the manga, I see no interest in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>...they're just gonna tone down the gore and politics, not the fanservice, r-right?</br>  <br>http://i.imgur.com/g456FR5.gif</br>  <br>Already favourited the manga to read in bed later, will follow the anime if I like what I read. Need more stuff to watch anyway</br>  <br>http://imgur.com/download/fH7UZXS</br>  <br>Well considering the manga has loads of rape im gonna say that gets cut too.</br>  <br> loads <br>There like two instances.</br></br>  <br> no smoking hot flashback to the bunny queen surrendering <br>why live</br></br>  <br><br>More of their WWII history than the JSDF.<br><br>The youngins in Japan are generally pretty nationalistic anymore (China saber-rattling helps) and pretty into the JSDF and tacticool shit.<br><br>GATE itself was pure nationalistic JSDF wank material by a JSDF member (who so happens is a batshit insane racist/nationalist who would've fit right into WWII-era Japan's military go fig), which is a bummer because the concept is fun.<br><br>So what if an otherworldly force invaded the Earth...and we kicked their fucking asses? Basically less "heroic battle for the future of humanity" and more "Well, okay, there's a portal to another world on earth now. How do we handle this fact?"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So spoonfeed me, or not, but is this the same princess who is just wearing a rabbit ears headdress, or is she an actual bunnygirl? Am I getting characters all mixed up?</br></br>  <br>Nope, she's an actual bunnygirl</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense. Guess those other anons were talking out their asses.</br>  <br>that pic is a  dying hallucination <br><br>she chose the  uchiha route </br></br></br>  <br>Such a useless rabbit.<br>Only good for her sex appeal.</br></br>  <br>[spoilers]Yeah I've been spoiled on that bit. That's some bleak business man[/spoiler]<br><br>I kind of wonder how the show will handle it, though I suppose they could easily suggest most of it rather obliquely since <br>certainly isn't happening for sure in show form the same way.<br><br>Pic unrelated.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah...sorry.</br>   you will never 3some with delicious Pina and Bozes   <br>I forget they're technically knights. That makes it hotter.</br>  <br><br><br> dat firm, toned ass </br></br></br>  <br>Do the Japanese ever get punished by the UN for their actions, they're doing the equivalent of slaughtering all in some backwater tribe in the amazon that's never had contact with the modern world. If America did the same thing Japan does in this manga the whole world would call them out 100 times worse than they did for the middle east or Vietnam. <br><br>On another note, none of the characters or factions make logical decisions. Why do the empire soldiers charge blindly to their deaths? Realistically, the JSDF would fire their guns once and all the enemy soldiers would shit their pants and lay down their arms. Why does the JSDF start a full on land war? For the few hundred Japanese Civilians they kidnapped? That's fucking stupid. They could easily send an elite task force in with helicopters and extract the civilians, they obviously don't need to worry about AA so it would be the most logical and cost effective solution. All these decision are obviously around to serve the nationalistic JSDF wank fest of a plot. Why the hell does America try and steal the alternate dimensional people with special forces, the American government would never risk doing that when they could've easily strong armed the Japanese government into handing them over through political or economic methods. I could go on and on.<br><br>This manga makes me sad, because the concept has so much potential, and could've been used way more effectively in the hands of a compitent writer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do the empire soldiers charge blindly to their deaths? Realistically, the JSDF would fire their guns once and all the enemy soldiers would shit their pants and lay down their arms. <br>The Imperial soldiers never saw a gun. They never even saw a Japanese soldier. The JSDF spammed artillery at them from beyond visual range and they all died before they knew who they were even fighting.</br></br>  <br>Tomita is one lucky son of a bitch</br>  another doodle  <br>Call them out for what?<br><br> "Ay, yo. UN here. You can't repel them invaders. You got to take it up the ass. Thanks." <br><br>No country in their right mind would follow them order much less the UN having order for NOT repelling an attacking faction.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The JSDF never actually start a fight though. They just retaliate and finish them.</br>  <br>Yet everyone gets pissed off at america for invading the middle east after 9/11.</br>  <br>That's even worse, the JSDF could just drop a few shells in front if the invading army and they would run for the hills.</br>  <br>Shh, let it go. Don't take away from my war boner.</br>  <br>do some rory pls<br><br>also moar harpy pls<br><br>you fancy fellow with a fine face you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who gives a shit? There were 16 other countries invading with America. <br><br>Every god damn country hated America since we founded this damn country. Hell I'm pretty sure the Native Americans still hates us.</br></br></br>  <br> Fine face <br> mfw im covered in veteran face hair <br><br>Fine.... indeed...</br></br></br></br>  <br>you manly man with a mound of...<br><br>of<br><br>of manliness</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>hey<br><br>I tried</br></br></br>  Just the best girl passing by.  <br> mound of manliness <br><br>i fucking imagined a breast with a mustache and fucking died. Mein sides</br></br></br>  <br>He's lucky she didn't break his ribs</br>  <br>Or all his lower half.</br>  <br><br>Agreed.</br></br>  <br>Oh luck another autist who cant enjoy anime</br>  <br>Its not autism when you want characters to have motivation and act rationally. Having characters do things solely to serve the plot is considered lazy writing, it can be done in small amounts but Gate is chock full of it. When characters don't act like actual humans makes them feel uncanny, the same way shitty art makes them look uncanny.</br>  <br>topkek<br><br>but seriously, draw some rory pls</br></br></br>  <br>Worth</br>  <br> expecting this from a medium that's held hostage by shut ins <br>lmao A Y Y</br></br>  <br>And? America didn't start the fight in WW2, they're still seen as bad guys for dropping the bombs. Israel didn't start the fight and they're getting yelled at for going into Palestine.</br>  <br>They all have their supporters though.</br>  <br> Because those filthy monster girls are not allowed to travel to glorious Nihon. <br><br>You have not read the novels then. There's a lot of story in them. The author seems to be open minded about monster girls. Those who can meet Japan's immigration requirements can move to Japan and some do just that. <br><br>I would assume that harpy girls have automatic approval to immigrate to Japan due to their unique special skill.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ah, that makes sense. Guess those other anons were talking out their asses. <br>There are a lot of people who superficially hate Gate. Gate's existence simply provides an opportunity to bash Japan and that's the real goal of their posts.</br></br>  <br> Yet everyone gets pissed off at america for invading the middle east after 9/11. <br><br>So wahabi-type terrorists do 9/11, then we proceed to steam-roll one of the few relatively secular governments in the area. that historically were hostile to fundamentalists. Afghanistan I can understand, but pretty much everyone else in the world understood Iraq was an unrelated person grudge by Bush. <br><br>That was a fantastically counterproductive own-goal -- there's a reason why diplomats describe "The Coalition of the Willing" as "The Coalition of the Bullied", and tongue-in-cheek describe the winner of the Iraq invasion as being Iran.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And then it turns out Pakistan was harboring OBL.<br>Oh well, at least we're turning to Asia thanks to the Chinese being meanies.</br></br>  <br> Realistically, the JSDF would fire their guns once and all the enemy soldiers would shit their pants and lay down their arms. <br><br>No they wouldn't. I assume you have not read the novel. But at least you should have seen the manga and had some comprehension ability applied? In the manga, it was shown how magic and arms both played a role on the battlefield. So simply hearing loud noises or seeing explosions isn't enough to stop them. Maybe it would if all soldiers had YOUR sense of commitment. An army made of people like you would always lose - YOUr country would be called the Surrender Monkey country if everyone there was like you in not understanding commitment as a soldier.<br><br>You say it is stupid to fight on. So, you'd try to anonymously shoot your commanders in the back so that the fight could be abandoned? That did happen in Vietnam. To get out of some fights, some USA units had a pattern of officer death that was highly suspicious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh this is after she was captured and gangraped right?</br>  <br>Doesn't change the fact that it was a stupid war that used the martyrs of 9/11 to garner support in America. <br><br>Its exactly the same as what Japan is doing in Gate, without the excuse of non-existant "Weapons of mass destruction."</br></br></br>  best girl  <br> Its exactly the same as what Japan is doing in Gate <br>so you havent read it at all.</br></br>  <br>This guy needs to do some doujins, goddamn,</br>  <br>Soldiers have a little thing called morale, and it tends to drop when losing a battle, especially in the face of technology they haven't seen before. Soldiers route all the time, and commanders order it too, any competent General knows when to back down. why fight a battle you know you can't win? Your country would have long fallen, for you'd have thrown all your good men into futile battles. Much like the Japanese during WW2 and their "Lets smash our fighter pilots into the sides of ships" doctrine, because their HONORUUUU wouldn't let them back down.<br><br>And you're right, I haven't read the books, but you'll notice I mentioned the manga in my comment, so I'm not judging the merit of the books, they could be pure fucking gold and I wouldn't care because an adaptation shouldn't need you to read any previous material for you to understand it.</br></br></br>  <br>Explain to me how it's any different.</br>  fuck on... boring...  K-E-K  <br> Weapons of mass destruction <br>All the PM has to do is say they're land on the other side and all of Japan will rise up and say "Kill them savages."</br></br>  <br>Chapter 47 clearly shows that they DON'T FUCKING KNOW they can not win. Empire had trampled all opposition on their continent and was sure it can do the same with the guys in green whatever magic they possess. They are brutal, barbaric, superstitious and crappily educated.</br>  <br>Gorgeous! Moar pls</br>  any more on the dragon chick?   friday <br><br>hopefully.</br></br>      Who came up with her uniform  <br>The JSDF is deployed through the Gate on the argument that the Gate opened in Japan and that the land on the other side of the Gate is therefore part of Japan. But that doesn't hold up under any legal scrutiny; the Kingdom of Lesotho, for example, is completely surrounded by and only accessible through South Africa, but that doesn't mean South Africa has any jurisdiction there. Even the Japanese government officials in the manga admit that it's a shady excuse to gain access to all the other world's resources for themselves; the only reason the UN goes along with it is probably that the Security Council states want to deny each other those resources just as much.</br>  <br>okay <br><br>moar pls</br></br></br>  <br>Vanilla doujins</br>  <br> those dragon faces </br>  <br>They're pretty funny</br>  <br><br><br> blue skin </br></br></br>    <br>maybe they'll retcon it in the anime</br>  <br>I honestly expected it to be super tan skin but hey, beggars can't be choosers anon</br>  <br>Those two are young and retarded unlike their mom</br>  <br>There is already merchandise with her in blue. Besides it's not skin it's scales. They are just mostly omitted as is the fur on the beast girls</br>  <br>no it's skin. She has scales too.</br>  <br>merchandize where?</br>  <br>Nothing 18,000kg of American engineering won't fix.</br>   some fan-mail I sent to the mangaka a long as time ago was actually read by the guy <br><br>Oh gosh, now I'm embarrassed.</br></br>  <br>Ok, lets take Rome for example, the Empire in Gate is quite clearly based off them. Rome was the big kid on the block during it's glory days, it had the most economic, political and military power in, at what that point was, the known world. When they tried, they could win any war, but the commanders were still competent enough to retreat when they knew they were outmatched. Even when fighting people who were technologically inferior to them they would often play it safe and wait for the most favorable conditions.<br><br>An entire expeditionary army dies to the JSDF within the first chapter. Then another entire army dies when trying to take back the ground conquered by the JSDF, and yet later, soldiers still willingly charge forward to their deaths. It is a pre information era civilization, but that doesn't change the fact that two whole armies went missing, that shit can't just get swept under the rug, it's going to spread by word of mouth pretty quickly. Its just dumb writing if the commanders are that blind.</br></br></br>  <br>I've seen some keychain accessory designs. Though it could be just fan art.</br>  <br>it's<br><br>it's beautiful<br><br>I've always found the Phantom aesthetically pleasing, the shape of the airframe just exudes raw power</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WTB Myuute will trade smut</br>    Anyone else really looking forward to pina losing her shit when she realized they're fucked? one of the most comical parts of the series for me.  <br>I'm more looking forward to her yelling at Boozes and Pinash</br>  <br>  later, soldiers still willingly charge forward to their deaths. <br>Actually in Itarika they charge the city defences and THEN they are decimated in minutes. After that there are no full-scaled battles between JSDF and the empire (so far at least).</br></br>  <br>Her tits are looking a little big.</br>  <br>Running downhill in open toed shoes sounds like an awful idea</br>  <br>yup, check out the artist's pixiv if you want to know more about Roris.....sizes.</br>  <br> They are brutal, barbaric, superstitious and crappily educated. <br><br>Literally the same thing the colonial powers said about Japan and other non-colonial powers before westernization.</br></br></br>  <br> rory as a catgirl <br><br>I don't know how to feel about that</br></br></br>  <br>What? You want leather? Fine, here.</br>  <br>this<br><br>this I like</br></br></br>  <br>Oh on this note I'd like to add to the "charging rifles is unrealistic" /a/non. The zulus dit just that with their sticks and bows against the english troops.</br>  <br>Jeez you're hard to please. Fine, have some lace.</br>  <br>Nothing says goddess of love like a bondage suit.</br>  THe part i want to see aniamted (and narrated) is the opening of the PX store and the growth of it's economy.<br><br> A PX is set up to facilitate trade and distribute supplies <br> merchants and locals gather <br> catgirls arrive to fill labor shortage <br> JSDF soldiers are lured in by catgirls <br> JSDF bring more trade with them <br> trade brings more merchants <br> more cat girls arrive due to labor shortage <br> ... <br> Endless loop </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hmmmmmmmmm</br>  <br>I hope some of the 4-komas get animated. <br><br><br>Still not enough?

We're talking about launching classical music out of cannons.</br></br>  <br> pukingmadotsuki.jpg <br>why.</br></br>  <br>Some people just have no concept of standards. Just go to any site dedicated to a niche fetish, and you will see people literally suck the dicks of artists who shit out 10 minute MS paint scribbles.</br>  <br>The difference being the Zulus had a ten to one advantage at the battle of Isandlwana, and the British hadn't set up fortification. Another big difference is the British had the Martini rifle, which was a single shot breach loading rifle, not a fully automatic Howa Type 89. <br><br>You cant just look at a singular isolated event and say "Thats totally realistic and happens all the time." because it's simply not true, the battle of Isandlwana was an exception, not the rule. It is seen by historians as a completely unique scenario.</br></br></br>  <br>All bombs are not enough.</br>    <br>The whole ramming planes into ships thing actually had fucking excellent returns. For the price of one or two balsawood planes and 2-4 soldiers you could assplode a ship that cost a hundreds of times more to build and kill hundreds of times as many men.<br><br>Even considering that the planes in question had to close to effective AA range and thus probably get shot down half the time, they don't stay in AA range for long if they just dive straight into a ship, there weren't a lot of AA defences or fighter screens designed to beat planes as fast interceptors going straight for the objective at top speed.<br><br>The 'Divine Wind' referred to by 'Kamikaze' are the typhoons and unusual weather patterns that destroyed every other army that attempted to invade Japan. The implication being that they were pretty sure at that point that the Americans were going to try a land invasion of Japan, and they would just destroy every single troop transport America sent by crashing planes into them.</br></br></br></br></br>   western   <br>Also, compare with the battle of Rorke's Drift, where the British were outnumbered 20:1, but had time to set up a rudimentary defense, and was able to repel the attack.</br>  <br>seriously you guys got ants in your pants over this? All I wanted is to see Delilah drawn in her fluffy goodness</br>  <br>There's plenty of shitty nip artists too.</br>  <br>historically you don't get armies 4 tech levels apart fighting each other.<br>and battle of Alnus had 150 000 troops against maybe tens of thousands of JSDF soldiers.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait, didn't he get stabbed by her and then shoot her in return?</br></br>  <br>Listen, /a/ has drawthreads with artists who are 100 times more talented doing these for free.</br>  <br><br>and they don't get posted because it's shit<br>the best western art is what is displayed here</br></br></br>  <br><br>Unless you max out Science and Production.</br></br>  <br>that is if I ever get their attention</br>  <br>guess they don't have a huge fan following though</br>   mfw im just going to continue doodling out of desperation that someone wealth fetishists will notice me   <br>deviantart is hardly "the best western artists" and you know it.</br>  <br>A great start for luv-luv stuff</br>  <br>You have to spam Mysu in their thread.</br>  <br> Not maxing out economy <br> Not buying every science and production building with insane dosh </br></br>  <br>what?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure my post was in English. <br><br>Go to the drawfag threads and spam MYSU in their thread. That will get their attention if any of the oldfags are still there.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a terrible plan, they didn't have any planes to intercept incoming dive bombers and torpedo bombers.

Now all they have to do is have fewer crew per ship, cheaper ships, spread out over numerous smaller fleets and they win the fucking war. It is an entirely valid strategy if you give zero fucks about committing to a strategy that by actual necessity kills your own dudes.<br><br>Not to mention that once US fleets got closer they start launching them from airfields on land, which are EVEN CHEAPER STILL than aircraft carriers.</br></br></br>  <br>Muv-luv does a pretty good job of showing that every country has its share of corrupted assholes but also has its share of good people.</br>  <br>God bless Walken</br>  <br><br>What do you mean? We're the good guys 8 out of 10 times. We're just not very effective.</br></br>  <br><br>It's counter-balanced in unlimited when Walken fights some YAMATO-DAMASHII dude and that purple headed bitch complains about the US non stop</br></br>  is the Gate /34/ I posted that bad? I've seen far worse stuff on paheal alone. at least I gave references for Delilah, Rory and Tyuule  <br>Holy shit, fuck off. Yes, its bad.</br>  <br>Yeah they were in the infirmary together and she kept on feeling guilty that she out of battle instinct attacked an ally. So in turn they had a long recovery together.</br>  <br>I'm sorry but I got bills to pay and I really can't really afford commissions</br>  <br>I don't remember /a/ drawfags charging anyone.</br>  The anime fucking ruined shino. She was to be the tough bulky chick but had sex appeal, butt not some moe tiny shit. They at best couldve kept that as making the way rory is now. Though shes a gothic loli she can go whatever she likes.  GATE x Stargate crossover when?  <br>But that not how it works, not one single fleet was destroyed by kamikaze attacks, 1 or two smaller ship would get destroyed in an attack that would waste 20+ planes, not a single large aircraft carrier or battleship was ever sunk by Kamikaze attacks. This was because they would never leave fleet formation and they would be stationed in the center. Nothing would get through the wall of flak mixed with intercepting american planes. Who gives a shit if a cruiser gets blown up, they can be replaced extremely quickly. Kamikaze was just a bad strategy.</br>    <br>To be fair it's a gun store. Nobody has any business taking out a loaded gun.</br>  <br>Dumb excuse for current setting, but weeboos will lap it up.<br><br>What probably would happened is that every permanent member voted against Japan hogging the resources by themselves, and Gate becomes some sorta world heritage site.</br></br></br>  bumpo  <br> fluff <br>Hey I drew you some</br></br>  <br>The chest is a little broad.</br>  <br>I was too preoccupied with proper shoulder alignment so I've noticed this a bit too late</br>  <br>Does she ever get a good end?

The independent noble head of Itarka allowed demihumans to exist with far less discrimination, so there's more of them in the Itarika area without them falling into slavery due to indebtedness.<br><br><br> It loves monster girls and protects them from harm, nyan~ <br>The manga has a market scene showing various shops including a butcher shop.

Any Speculation on how far we'll get if there is one? Monthly manga is painful, and LN/Novel Translations probably never,  <br>A two course run was confirmed at the expo.

The story is about how Aoi used to think she was a genius, how she was a top straight A student in elementary and middle school but somehow fucked up the exam for highschool so she had to go to Kitauji. At which point Aoi met Asuka and she finally understood what it means to be a genius. I mean Aoi is still in the top 10 ranking of Kitauji but Asuka makes it look fucking easy. Aoi had to quit club to go to nightschool for her grades while Asuka jokes that she's too poor to afford them.
