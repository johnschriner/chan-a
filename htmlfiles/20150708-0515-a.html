This thread doesn't have an OP that looks like it was drawn by a 10-year old.</br></br>  Akari~n  <br>but this one is better, and was posted in the last thread first</br>  What the hell's going on in the other thread's OP picture anyway? It looks like a 2006-era Deviantart picture, and looks like Chinatsu hasn't slept in about 5 days or something going by the major-league bags around her eyes.  <br>H-HAAIII!</br>  Bakkin has been updated, if anyone hasn't had a chance to read Oomuro-Ke Chapter 35 yet.<br><br>http://bakkinbakkingamu.com/release<wbr>-oomuro-family-volume-2-chapter-35/<wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  Round 2, modified due to backlash<br>Marry, Kissu, Befriend</br>  <br> Marry <br>None<br><br> Kissu <br>None<br><br> Befriend <br>All</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only correct answer</br>  <br>Marry Ayano.<br><br>Kiss Akari's cheeks.<br><br>Befriend Chitose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That won't happen</br>  <br>Way to go, captain obvious.</br>  <br> Kiss Akari's cheeks. <br>L E W D</br></br>    <br>That thread looks horrible.

That's extremely lewd.<br><br><br>They're hard to assemble?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to hug Yui!  So a half dozen guys just seceded and decided to have their own /yryr/ thread?<br><br>This never ends well.</br></br>  <br>Welcome back!</br>  <br>I want to hug you!</br>  <br>Anon, that's lewd.

This is probably how Bronies started.<br><br>Please guys, lets never become like Bronies.

Everything will come undone.</br>  <br>We're above having a pope<br>On with the reformation!</br></br>  <br><br>Thread holy war. I recommend electing Kyouko as Pope as she is super effective against the China-heretic.</br></br>  <br>It's just a hug!</br>  <br>Japan isn't allowed to have a military anymore, so that is the secret weapon to how they are going to conquer China.</br>  <br>The other thread is a Chinatsu hate thread, though, so this one will have to be the love-thread.</br>  <br>butts?</br>  <br>G-guys, I'm thinking about defecting.</br>  <br>it also helps that she's the best girl</br>  <br>Lady Sakurako graciously accepts the burden of leadership.</br>  <br>Go ahead and join the weird cunt-lick thread then, you don't seem Yuru enough for this one.</br>  <br>But if Yurus became the next ponies, wouldn't Namori be drowing in money?<br><br>And since jellyfish can swim (in money) wouldn't that mean we'd get things like an animated Oomuro-ke spinoff?<br><br>No, you're right. That way lies madness.

That makes it much more OK in my opinion. Having an inner child isn't as weird as having an inner pony.</br>  <br> I thought you said 'defecating' at first... <br><br>I intended to do both at once.</br></br></br>  <br>But then the Chinatsu lovers will change sides</br>  <br>The Yuru civilization is declining</br>  <br>You just described 50% of all threads on /a/.<br><br> ehehe </br></br></br>  <br>I fully support Lady Sakurako!

Just because everything went well for over a year without mods going crazy doesn't mean that caution is wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Synchro the weakest summoning method?</br>  <br>Because Rank 4, Shaddolls and Nekroz happened.<br><br>Coincidentally, Synchro can benefit the most from pendulum summoning, once we get actual synchro pendulum archetypes with pendulum tuners. A Synchro-spam deck with everything, including the tuners and possibly even the synchros themselves, being pendulum could really stir some shit up, even with the R4 spam.</br></br></br>  <br>In terms of support synchro is the weakest atm but on paper it's probably the strongest barring a few consistency issues with tuner/non-tuner.</br>  <br>The problem is that synchroing is inherently minus-y, and depletes resources like mad. Pendulum tuners would solve that problem handily.</br>  <br>I mean it's equal to xyz in minus and fusion is technically more minus, it's just there's no current archtype that rewards you for synchroing like shaddolls, BA, and nekroz do for their respective summoning. We may see it alot more with the new dracoknight pendulum archtype.</br>  <br> inb4 all the synchros get a free T.G Hyper Librarian effect </br>  <br>#freemahniggaHyLib</br>  <br>Well even just some more "When this card is sent to the graveyard to X" cards would help alot. Just hyper librarian and formula have limited what synchros can do since if they get too much we get plant/junk decks.</br>  <br>The new Jet Synchron, Jet Warrior and Rush Warrior seem pretty good</br>  Like Jaden and the Masked HEROes should a Yusei style deck focus more on Stardust synchros and only sparingly use the Junk synchros and armory arm?   There will never be ovas following the 5D's cast durring the 8 year time skip.   <br>I feel like Speedroids and their good amount of search are already a step in the right direction.<br><br>I'm just hoping they get a WIND level 5 tuner with some sort of inherent special summon. It'd allow us to easily go into Stardust, its upgrades, Formula and most level 5s to go for Quasar/Sifr. Speedroids already have the toolbox and a decent searcher to make nearly anything from 2 to 7 and could even expand that with a high-level tuner to easily summon.<br><br>While they might not have as much advantage generating, they do have a good consistency already and are definitely at least as versatile as Yang Zing without having to rely on your opponent to destroy your things.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> there will never be OVAs of ARC-V where we see Yuya and Yuzu taking care of their kids </br>   Speedroids can use this <br> Yugo=Fusion <br>SPEEDIEST LORE</br></br>  <br>In the 5D's manga apparently there are 2 more lvl 6 stardust warriors synchros</br>  <br>This Friday at least.</br>  <br> There will never be OVAs following DM's cast during the time between DM and GX or following the GX cast during the time bwtween GX and 5D's. </br>   yusei and jack will never have science babies together.   Number 39 Utopia has 11 forms <br>Stardust Dragon has 11 forms<br>Odd Eyes Pendulum Dragon has 8 forms</br></br>  If we'll see Yuzu in her riding suit, then we should see Serena in hers, right?    <br>You disgust me</br>  <br>Doesn't Neos have like 15+ forms??</br>  <br>Wait until we see Ruri and we get fanart of her riding Yuri.</br>  <br>Try within the next 24 hours since they usually come on the 7th.</br>  <br>That's not gonna happen.</br>  <br>So does Yugo always wear his track suit??</br>  <br>Yuuya is literally sex</br>  <br>He's poor you classist insensitive fuck.</br>  <br>The 10 is for Yuzu, by the way.</br>  So we haven't seen what Yuya's bike will look like.<br><br>What if its  Yusei's bike </br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is while Yuzu is pleasured by her tomato, Yuzu cannot satisfy Yuya.<br><br>Clearly a more lewd citrus is needed.</br></br></br>  goddammit, I don't want to find Yuzu this arousing  <br>Oh man Yuya/Yugo can not meet each other if there is a Ruri near them, Jean will see this and will freak out.</br>  <br>EBINAAAA</br>  I sure do  I mean, you might think I'm lying, but I honestly have never seen Yuzu as that hot before.<br><br>Until the post-showers scene.<br><br>What are you doing to me, Ebina.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did she get the tits?</br>  <br>She won them in a duel.</br>  <br>Embrace your Ruri fever.</br>  <br>Against Aki?</br>  <br>Lack of her Yuya.<br><br>That's why Serena's bigger.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> aki had potential to become best girl <br> gets sidelined by sex cults, pregnancy, and Crow </br></br>  One year ago, we were facing off with Reiji, and trying to figure out what he meant by the future of pendulum summoning.<br>So, have we found that future?</br>  <br>Pendulum-Xyz and other Pendulum Extra Deck cards presumably. Didn't you see his shit-eating grin when Yuya brought out OERD in their duel?</br>  <br> One year ago, we were facing off with Reiji <br><br>Nigga, you're not an anime character.</br></br></br>  Reminder IV left Yugioh to join Shokugeki No Souma  <br>He's going to make a cooking deck.<br><br>Or he's going to cook trading cards.</br></br></br>  <br> Two 4's  <br><br>Sasuga</br></br></br>  <br><br>Most funniest part is his name is Yugi in the show, I wonder if that was a reference</br></br>  I need more psycho Kaiba caps. Apparently the god cards really broke him  <br>I eagerly await for the moment he starts screaming about fan service.</br>  <br> His name is Terunori Kuga. Yugi is just his nickname in threads. </br>  It's Yusei's birthday so lets say nice things about Jesus Fudo.  <br>I want to see him and Shun trying to outchuuni eachother</br>  <br>Their duel would last 4+ episodes.</br>  <br>yugioh best boy</br>  <br> At the end of the duel Yusei and Shun agree that bonds are the most important thing in the world, while Shun shares his Ruri album with Yusei </br>  r-ruri?  <br>Not yet</br>  <br>;_;</br>  things i want to happen in arc v with the ruris and tomato boy  <br>Here she is</br>  <br>  Yuzus face when <br>Post Yuzu reaction guys</br></br>  RANK UP MAGIC  <br> Wanting a harem <br>go watch zexal</br></br>  <br>RAN GUP MAJICK</br>  <br>Clearly Shun is aiming for all the Ruris.<br><br>Since he can't tell them apart at a glance, I wonder what he'd do if he is forced to choose one Ruri out of four without being allowed to make sure who's who.</br></br></br>  <br>  Implying harem  <br>  Not appreciating visual gags <br>shit taste right there anon</br></br></br>  <br>RURI FORCE</br>  Threadly reminder that Yuya doesn't give two shits about other dimensions and their problems. He just wants his waifu back.<br><br>Yuya may be the best or the worst MC that Yugioh has ever seen.</br></br>  <br>For some reason I miss those kids. I never thought I'd say that.<br>Goddamn Arc V, you amazing.</br></br>  <br>Clearly this is the producers' way of saying "Het rules".</br>  <br>Well of course he's the best, because he actually cares deeply about something beyond winning cardgames and 'friends', which is incredible.</br>  <br>I will never miss shibireru kid</br>  <br>  Reminder shivers kid is a Eldrich Abomination <br>You can never escape him<br>Regardless in which dimension you run</br></br></br>  I love how Sawatari almost looks up to Yuya now, and thinks of him as his friend.<br>This show has the best characterization out of any Yugioh series by far; just about every character is likable or redeemable in some way.</br>  <br>Will Shun pull out a rank 7 Falcon to save Ruri? Will she hug him and call him onii-chan afterwards?</br>  <br>He sort of has to after getting beat by him twice, unless he is Kaiba</br>  <br>Hey if you think about Yuya's doing what exactly Judai was doing only more hetero</br>  <br> Shun pulls out rank 7 to save Ruri <br> Yugo pulls out Accel Synchro to save Rin </br></br>  Reminder that Yuzu doesn't know Yuya is in Synchro.  <br>Yeah, and if Yoko didn't smack EGAO back into Yuya's head we'd have all of Synchro destroyed by EGAO!Yuya by now.</br>  <br>Not for much longer unless we get some really contrived bullshit.</br>  <br> just about every character is likable or redeemable in some way <br>I can't wait until they redeem Eita.</br></br>  <br> Yugo doesn't own a TV </br>  <br>They're going to the arena in the preview though.</br>  <br> "Yuzu, let's practice Riding Duel." <br> "Looks like there's some sort of Exhibition Duel, though, Yugo." <br> "Meh, it's always King dueling against some random nobodies. Who cares. Let's go practice!" </br></br></br>  <br>Not necessarily; he's come to appreciate his skill as an entertainment duelist, judging by how excited he was when he found they could partake in the Friendship cup together.<br>This has developed from petty rivalry and into common admiration. <br><br>On another and probably unrelated note, does nobody here understand conventions regarding characterization? Or are duels all that matter to you guys in this heavily character-focused show?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Arc V has done some crazy shit already, I wouldn't be surprised if they found a way.<br>But it wouldn't really accomplish anything, considering how narrow and bland his character is.</br></br>  <br> are duels all that matter to you guys <br>Yes.<br><br>I will not be satisfied until Yuya wrecks Reiji in a duel, but I know he won't. In fact, I think he'll never defeat Reiji.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bummer, I'm really fascinated by film abd television conventions and the like. Probably going to study it later on.<br>Shame this show has been structured so fantastically and I have nobody to discuss it with. But hey, cards are fun.</br></br>  <br>nobody in /a/ is smart enough for you, go somewhere else</br>  <br>I've tried. Other forums that discuss this show are either full-blown autism incarnate or the embodiment of /dng/. <br>This place is still my best bet; you guys are still great.</br></br>  I just realized that the shitposting which would emerge from a Yuzu vs Sawatari duel would crash /arc-v/  with no survivors   <br>Why? All qualms between them have been resolved.</br>  <br> Sawatari ever getting a significant duel again that doesn't involve him dying or something </br>  <br> Even Teppei was based as fuck for like 10 seconds <br>And what a glorious ten seconds that was</br></br>  <br>But could Monarchs defeat Melodious?</br>  <br>At least he accomplished something this time. His monster became fodder for Rise Falcon; he's never helped in any way in any of his previous duels.</br>  <br>He gave Shun those pendulum monsters that one time</br>  <br>His pendulum scales became Shun's pendulum scales in the vs Jobelisk fight. In fact he's becoming fodder for Shun.</br>  <br><br>Yup, but even then it was Gon that made that happen, not him.<br>However I'd still like to know how Shun planned to solitaire those three Level 6's out of his hand.</br></br></br>  <br>There's at least the Friendship Cup. He might even beat someone.</br>  <br>With a low attack like that, Wild Vulture probably has a special summon from the hand effect like other RR. Using the pendulums was symbolic more than anything else.</br>  <br>If his first round opponent isn't a random nobody, probably not.</br>  <br>yfw he beat's Shun and it's not a complete asspull</br>  <br>Only in your dream world, Sawatari.</br>  <br>Sawatari lives in his dream world, he's just sleepwalking through the real one.</br>  <br>Maybe if he had Monarchs and Yosenju, he could beat him.<br>Or if he remembers to set Breakthrough Skill</br></br>   yfw   NO CHANGE  happens to the TCG banlist  The chairman is fucking evil, isn't he? I just have a feeling...  <br> Yfw Tewart denied us Arkana's DM and is such a lazy fuck that he won't do anything with the banlist because his precious ritual deck </br>  <br>Everyone is evil, anon.</br>  <br>We also thought Nico Smiley was evil, he was just based.</br>  Who is the best Arc-V and why is it Shun?  <br>Because Shun is a hero. An anti-hero, but a hero nonetheless. <br><br>Is he the most powerful Lancer sans Reiji and godmode Yuya?</br></br></br>  <br>Because he's the goddamn batman.</br>  <br>He's certainly the one the writers wank to the most.</br>  <br>No they definitely wank to Serena more, both metaphorically and literally.</br>  <br>Edgy good guy /= anti-hero.</br>  <br>I want more people like you in here to talk about narrative structure in /a/rc-v</br>  <br>And that's why they're perfect for each other.</br>  <br>That's pretty much exactly what that is.<br>A character whose intentions are good natured but whose methods are disagreeable.</br></br>  <br>You could argue he was an anti-hero pre-Junior Youth Championship seeing as he carded LDS teachers but wasnt necesseraliy a villain</br>  <br>I want them to OTK people together.</br>  <br>I'm hoping to be studying media and communications early next year, love that kind of stuff.<br><br>I've actually been considering for some time now to try doing a sort of overview of the Yugioh series, because there's a surprising amount of depth behind its goofy premise. However that would require sitting through GX and the latter half of 5ds to give a complete review... so we'll see about that.</br></br></br>  <br>the second half of 5ds, while not as good as the first 64, is actually not that bad. It has some missteps, a lot of filler, and that "twist", but overall, pretty acceptable.</br>  <br> You should watch the currently airing precure. </br>  <br>I don't know why people ship these two together when Shun is so obviously 100% dedicated to Ruri and Ruri alone. And by 'Ruri' I mean the XYZ Ruri, not the Fusion "Ruri" or the Synchro ""Ruri"".</br>  <br>Because ruri is his sister?</br>  <br>Serena is not Ruri.</br>  <br>He wants to find and rescue her, because that's what men do when their siblings are taken by strangers.<br>As for who wants to 'be with', probably nobody. There's a very good chance that he's battle-hardened to the point where he's forgotten how to love. Having your home and friends and family reduced to ashes and cards before your eyes would do that.</br></br>  <br>PTSD is a bitch.</br>  <br>Agony of death I can handle, but death AND defeat? Man, that's too much.</br>  <br>He still has his sister so if there's anyone he wants to be with, it's her.<br><br>Once the war is over, they can live together again and try to lead decent, happy lives.</br></br></br>   tfw I could've had my own Yuzu <br>Keep your childhood friends close</br>  <br> inb4 she is completely brainwashed to the point of no return <br> inb4 he has to kill her </br></br>  Will Yuya's pendulum ever touch Yuzu's bracelet? Euphemistically and literally?  <br><br> they touch <br> Yuya and Yuzu fuse into Yugi-Oh, King of Entertains </br></br></br>  <br> Suddenly Yami Yugi <br>And that's how Atem was born kids</br></br>  <br>Then he'll just have to join Academia.

Yuya might not be consciously controlling that ability, but to a bystander it'll look like he's holding back against almost everyone. [spoilerThen again, he hardly has an audience when he goes godmode.[/spoiler]</br>  <br>Hey remember that one time Mokuba was turned into a princess inside Kaiba's video game machine</br>  <br>What happens if Yuya eats Yugo in front of a live crowd</br>  <br>Kaiba wanted to love Mokuba without being gay, so that was the result.</br>  <br>Reiji and Gon are the only two characters who saw it that are still around.

He knows Yuya has some sort of Darkness and it would be better if it didn't show up.</br></br>  <br> "Let's go practice, Yugo" </br>  So basically everyone knows they can just dangle the word "Yuzu" in front of Yuya to make him do whatever they want.  <br> My clone is a scrub <br>More over, Crow will probably be the one to duel the King in tournament.</br></br>  <br> Her face looks weird in that image, but I can't figure out exactly what's wrong. </br>    <br>Yeah...poor kid. He needs to learn to stop being a crybaby bitch that won't take anything seriously. Imagine the final boss/duel, all his friends defeated and carded. Reiji was just outsmarted by his father and lie on the ground defeated. "Yuyu, he k-killed them all. Gon, the kids, Nico poor Nico...Just remember to ega-" He gets carded at that very moment while the professor laughs and states that he was too weak to stop him. Yuya's heartbeat gets louder and his head tilts down. "I ...WON'T....LET YOU GET A-AWAY WITH THIS". Music intensifies while lightning bolts hit around him and the ground shakes. His hair slowly starts lifting. Reira backs away slowly while watching in horror. Then, suddenly Yuya's theme starts playing LADIES AND GENTLEMAN.</br>  <br>And then you realize you can do the same to Yuto and Shun by dangling "Ruri", and Yugo by dangling "Rin"</br>  If Yuya wins, I'm dropping this show.  <br>Don't worry he won't win.

I feel like they don't really pay attention to the archetypes they create or anything, especially some of these Xyz overlay effects. At least I still have fun times with Arc-V.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They game is fucking garbage and Konami doesn't make anything better.<br><br>Keep your sanity and don't play the game.<br>Unless you want to see what will surpass all those decks you listed.</br></br></br></br>  Anyone testing out Deskbot 006?  <br>I think I'm good on actually playing anymore honestly, I just wanted to see how RaidRaptors actually did, it ranges from getting it's ass stomped to doing pretty good. But too much frustration between which one you'll get.</br>  <br> Noble knights <br> good </br></br>  <br>You forgot about Yosenju's 「Unlimited Stun Works」.</br>  <br> He can't defeat Noble Knights </br>  <br>I never said it was good, just that their constant recycling of their equip spells was stupid. A lot of these new decks just seem to be capable of silly things. <br><br>Didn't try it out or play it, but I wouldn't be surprised at this point honestly.</br></br></br>    <br>I also didn't say that.</br>  <br>the game got faster and better who the fuck cares? Thats how it works when your game gets powercreep and becomes more complex.</br>  <br>Hair down Yuto a qt</br>  <br> Easier summoning and access to destruction and negation in a game with no resource system is a good thing </br>  <br> Yuto a qt <br>Yes</br></br>  <br>tfw just a few years ago people were maindecking triple axe pf despair</br>  <br> card games that take 30 minutes to play between two people are "well-designed" <br>Fuck off Wizardfag, I like explosive plays.</br></br>  <br>that doesn't exactly sound better then the current game tbh</br>  <br>Don't forget if you use ANY OTHER DECK than that, you will be called shit playing with rogue deck.</br>  <br>Rank 4 is complex? It's literally designed for kids to get in the game easier.<br>Anyone can play Tellarknights.</br></br>  <br>I really wouldn't say the game as any more complex than it was back when it first released to be honest. It's still very easy to understand what's going on and still do things, nor would I say that TCGs deserve a power creep as you put it, at least not on the levels of some of the things I saw, granted not all of it was inherent bullshit, they were just silly things, like I said with Noble Knights recycling of equip spells, not that it's hard to deal with, it's just silly. <br><br>Good design should not be based on a growing power creep, it should be based around balanced play and proper combos within an existing archetype. Card games aren't shounen, they don't need to be jumping from one extreme to the next just to stay relevant and competitive. The game could easily have tons of new cards, summoning methods, effects, archetypes and what have you still remain competitive and not have this inherent power creep. The fault doesn't lie with the game as it does more so with Konami's inability to adjust.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you tried 006 on Salvation yet? Can i get your decklist?</br>  <br>I've never had games go for 30 minutes in MTG, even with half assed random decks. YGO is certainly faster, but you're over-exaggerating a bit there. <br><br>Sadly, it does have a pretty bad community still, which is amazing after all this time. But I guess anything competitive has it's fair share of shitters and good people spread about.</br></br></br>  <br>The power creep is really fucking up the game, It's run xyz in some way or get the fuck run over. Even the ritual focused deck needs a few xyz monster in the rare event they get a dead draw.</br>  <br>Xyz amazes me, because they're cool cards and I like what the anime has done with them, but they amaze the hell out of me. You'd figure Konami would have learned from Synchro, and Xyz has certainly tapered off a bit, but the Rank 4s might as well just be normal effect cards with no summoning required they're so easy to get out.</br>  <br>The game has no pace, the only thing it used to have were tributes to at least space out plays.<br><br>The gameplay suits an anime perfectly, quick combos, quick turnarounds, big monsters out sooner.<br><br>But there's something wrong with a game of "strategy" if a player is able to lose on the second turn of the game.<br>It's equivalent to being able to move 8 pieces per turn in a game of chess.<br>Holy fuck Yugioh just calm down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That card exists <br><br>Damn Fusion Scums</br></br></br>  <br> I really wouldn't say the game as any more complex than it was back when it first released to be honest <br>Look at the tourney decklists from 2003<br> http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Yu-Gi<wbr>-Oh!_World_Championship_2003</wbr> <br>Compare them to say, Nekroz decks and they're clearly more complicated. You have the multiple extra deck options, hard OPTs to juggle etc. to utilize. Every monster does something other than have high attack, as opposed to earlier in the game<br><br> like I said with Noble Knights recycling of equip spells, not that it's hard to deal with, it's just silly <br>How can it be bad for the game if it isnt oppressive to deal with? They are capable of powerful plays, but the recycling of equips is clearly there to balance the massive downsides of inherent minuses that equips bring. NKs are perfectly fair</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>I never tried deskbot, bruh. I'm pretty interested with it though. As for decklist, sure.<br><br><br>Pretty much what you said. Now it's all about using the same deck, and trying to get the combo first to win.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gosh, Yuto is just Yuma 2.0<br><br> KATTOBINGU <br><br> EGAO </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> over-exaggerating a bit there <br>Games can reach up to half an hour in tournaments if both decks bring heavy control. Mostly cause they sit there contemplating their cards for at least 3-5 minutes per turn before making a move.</br></br>  <br>I remember what the decks were like back then, the game itself still isn't more complicated, the only thing that has gotten more complicated is one's ability to string things together and for some decks requires constant draw mechanics just to get the precise cards you want, it's good in that regard, but breaks the flow a bit when you have someone spending 3-4 minutes just on turn 1 and end up with something that you either get lucky and can deal with it or can't deal with it at all. <br><br>I also think every card needs an effect, at least not some of the more ridiculous effects I've seen. Infinity should only be usable on your turn, because if it's gotten out early, it makes baiting it hard, and I don't even want to get into S0. <br><br>As for NK, the equip spells can be oppressive to deal with if they start managing to get them out. They aren't hard to deal with at first, but it quickly turns into blow the deck up fast or not at all, especially once they have an entire backrow, a monster that can't be destroyed, and can just recycle NKs and the equip spells back effectively almost always having a monster in the 3300+ range of attack, on top of one of their equip spells consistently bringing them 500 LP every turn. It's very hard to deal with unless you have certain Xyz monsters, which is what the game has become, relying solely on effects, as you said, opposed to a more varied use of monsters with high attack/defense and no effects. Again it's bad design when decks feel completely and utterly useless when you aren't running Xyz, especially specific ones like Exciton and Castel constantly. They shouldn't feel like a requirement to stay relevant, Xyz as a whole that is, and again certain Xyz being a requirement out of Xyz as a whole. It's dumb.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then that isn't the game's fault is it? That's the players fault for taking so long to contemplate.</br>  Shivers is best character  All of you, go back to /dng/, fuck.<br><br>Someone post best shota pics instead.</br></br>  <br>The main difference between MtG and Ygo is that there are infinitely more ways to do things than Ygo. The reason they take so long is because every card in their hand could be played but playing them sometimes isn't the best choice if you want to win in the long run.</br>  <br>You mean Augustus Gloop.</br>  <br>Which is the problem with YGO, it's gotten to the point where only certain cards are even viable anymore while others ones are just tossed to the side. It's definitely possible to still have a fast and coherent game and still have all the cards be usable with proper set ups and skill.</br>  Will we ever get a mood like this again? Odd Eyes Pendulum Dragon in the first OP always made me laugh with how much fun it seemed to be having.  <br><br><br>Someone clearly hasn't played legacy.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't tell me what to do Sora, you had to stall for half a day just to beat Shun, but you were going "all out" right?

Too bad, shit was incredible.</br>   Eating up haremshit just because of monstergirls <br>I don't know if I should laugh or cry.</br>  <br>a lot of the scenes were literally straight out of the manga, shot for shot<br><br> shit was glorious </br></br></br>  <br>Nigga Rachnee may be caring but she flat out tried to rape Darling the moment she became a member of the house. If Cerea didn't come she would have popped his cherry.</br>  <br>It was pretty good.</br>  <br> I enjoyed both premieres </br>  <br>Don't think too hard about it, it's just OP randomness/crazy.</br>  <br>Well, not everyone loves bigger breasts, so she was obviously important part of me, since there's noone else who is small.<br> and no, don't mention Suu, she grows up all the time for action anyways </br></br>  <br>It was ok in my book, quite faithful.</br>  <br>Based Cerea saving Darling from Liar Spiders, and doing sick Virgil Combos on a door WITH A FAKE SWORD to do so.</br>  Cant wait for ANN reviews on this.  <br>we've been eating it for three years now.</br>  <br>Now now, I understand that jealousy, but darling is fucking based and deserves all those girls.</br>  Where did this come from, and is there more?  Isn't it sad knowing this will sell like shit?  How the fuck is there already a cover of this song<br> uploaded 6 days ago <br>WHAT<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Esm<wbr>AYZpaf_s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Almost all of them have tried to rape him. Pretty sure Lala is the only one who hasn't yet.</br>   All this talk of rapists <br><br> Suu not even shown yet <br><br>Cant wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been reading since chapter 1 and was never such a fan of Smith myself.<br>Now she's on my top 5.</br></br>  <br> mfw HS still hasn't added this on their schedule <br>I wonder if this means HS release is going to be delayed.</br></br>  <br>Post the original images pre-manga serialization</br>  <br>snake cloaca/10 at least, anon.</br>  <br> Melusine will never coil you up in her scales and then fly away into the night <br><br>Why even bother living.</br></br></br>  <br> That.

That's all this is anyways.</br>  <br>Those are words for war anon</br>  <br> caring about tumblr </br>  <br>That was fast.</br>  <br>dorito/10</br>  <br> Pacific Rim <br><br>Mein negro.</br></br></br>  <br>He's fast.</br>  So how many chapters should Ep2 cover?<br><br>This Ep was only chapter 1.</br></br>  <br><br>I know, I guess it's just amazing that people are so dedicated that they can transcribe music and notes and shit after it was used in the background of a voiced trailer.<br>Here's another cover.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HDw<wbr>WG5zxUWQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They won't go crazy anyways.<br>The only thing that makes them blow up is loli.</br></br></br>  Opening http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x2lo2<br>Ending http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x2lhf</wbr></br></wbr>  <br>it... won't be that bad? The girls like him because he's very accepting and caring and stands up for them like when he punched the gawkers.</br>   yfw Lala at final episode   <br>I need lala being lewd soon</br>  <br>The PV had both Papi and Cerea in it, so it looks like they're doing 2 chapters per episode.</br>  <br>Yeah and then after that we'll get the awful Cerea Date chapter, which is currently battling the Rachnee flashback chapter for worst chapters in the series, and possibly worst chapters in a harem series.</br>  <br>Best girl in the final episode? Anon the amount of diamonds i'd be is nothing compared to what just happened.</br>  I am glad they included Team Demolition service. Love them more than harem girls. Cyclope and Zombie are the best.  How well do you guys think this'll sell?   Suu's eyes in the final Determined Gaze shot of the OP <br><br>DO THESE EYES LOOK LIKE THE EYES OF MERCY?!</br></br>  <br>I'd assume that's where the season ends.  With all the girls chasing after him because Lala predicted his death. </br>  <br>Noice.</br>  <br>But Dullahan can never remove their armor/clothing.. the legend sucks I know</br>  <br> Last episode ends on Darling's neck in the Scythe </br>  <br>This episode was chapter 1 and 2.</br>  <br> To be continued... </br>  <br>we've seen lala with different clothing. In the onsen chapter and in the keychain.</br>  <br>what about the swimsuit keychain though?</br>  <br>I... did not expect that ED to be as fucking metal as it was.</br>  OP/ED YouTube links.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Tum<wbr>h8gydreE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=j3M<wbr>KpbGcfD4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Don't know, but since they're gonna show all the girls i think they'll adapt 1/2 chapters per episode</br>  <br>This is exactly the kind of thing tumblr hates. <br> He stands up for them? You mean they can't stand up for themselves? <br>Add to that the fact that they're all hot and they'll just hate it more.<br><br>Still, who gives a fuck about tumblr?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MONSTAH, MONSTAH</br>  <br>That's a start, but look at her swimsuit. As un-revealing as it gets in anime, sadly</br>  What groups are subbing?  DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THE FACE OF  tender   RAPE  Best I can do. Someone get a better version of this.<br><br> Suu's eyes and face <br> Rachnera's sultry, in love eyes </br></br></br>  <br>The fuck at the love spirit bomb.</br>  Now remember everyone. The protagonist is called Darin. Don't forget this.  <br>Crunchyroll is the only one I know for sure.</br>  <br> Suu rapeface. <br><br>Yes.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>YES.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We all doubted them from the start but they fucking delivered. <br>What is there to doubt when there's no loli involved? <br>That's the only thing too risque for TV.</br></br></br>  <br> Tender rape  <br><br>Such thing is possible?</br></br></br>  What chapters are getting cut for the anime?<br>The OP had up to Rachne, and no Lala, so her entrance will probably be the end point of this season, but if they keep this 2 chapter per episode pace they're going to need to get rid of a lot of content.</br>  <br>I think the other girls address him differently.</br>  <br>that will make the lewd just that much better</br>  <br>Lamia subspecies<br>All my yes!</br></br>  I need a pic of Miia furious snake eyes near the end.  Anyone else not feeling quite sadisifed? I feel like something was missing   first monmusu doujin is papi <br> goddamn fatass instead of darling <br>I can't fap to this. Goddamn artists.</br></br>  <br>Patience, Best girl Lala will appear soon.</br>  <br>Just needs more MONSTAHS.</br>  <br>Game journalists do, apparently. But that's a long story in of itself.</br>  <br>Darling<br>Husband<br>Master<br>Dear<br>Honey<br>I think Lala calls him Lord?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do we know who will be subbing it yet?  <br><br>I love the fact they gave Suu and Rachnera irises and pupils.

Any advice before I start? Which episodes to skip etc.</br></br>  <br>I remember Kakozu/Hidan vs Kakashi/Shikamaru being one of the best and smartest fights in the series up until Naruto comes and ruins everything with the same old kagebunshin-rasengan combination. Kakashi vs Pain was also pretty good, but then again he had to lose because Naruto is the hero. At least we still have Guy vs Madara.</br>  <br>naruto is the best, bleach was ok and shit piece is garbage.</br>  <br>All the filler eps that focus on just side characters are usually pretty top notch, too.</br>  <br> Nuturu, WanPiss, Bitch <br> No Hunter x Hunter <br>Fagget</br></br></br>  <br>Naruto has the same problem as Dragon Ball in that regard<br><br>Where side characters are really interesting and can do really cool stuff, but the main character is the only one who's ever allowed to win.</br></br></br>  This is the only franchise where I actually want there to be a next generation thing where everyone can start fresh.  <br><br><br>Did that black ninja bang some white girl?</br></br></br>  Narutos and Sasukes kids are gonna bang right?  <br> Did that black ninja bang some white girl? <br><br>Other way around.<br><br>The fat ninja banged the delicious chocolate ninja girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>No.<br><br>They are not like their fathers outside of looks.<br><br>Probably they are going to have conflicting views from time to time and fix them with words instead of jutsus and fists.<br><br>Boruto is not interested in future Hokages and she's not interested in him at all.<br><br>And plenty of Japs are into Sarada x Inojin already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He seriously thinks that Bort and Salad won't be a thing <br><br>There is literally no reason to make her a girl otherwise. It's so SP can have an easy out for shipping</br></br></br>  <br><br> dat desperation </br></br>  <br><br>Likewise bolt isnt interested in her. Its not happening.</br></br>  <br>Honestly I wouldn't mind seeing some more about the new generation. Ideally not by Kishi but someone who isn't a completely burnt-out autist, but you take what you can get.<br>Sarada has been established as a fairly interesting character, and from what we've seen of Bolt they could have fun chemistry. I would prefer her and Bolt not being a thing because it's al too obvious but<br> it's a way for Sarada to have Naruto as a father (in law) <br> it's a way to reunite the bloodlines for a Rinnegan <br> it's another way for Kishi to connect Sauce and Nardo, something he's weirdly persistent at </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Dat samefagging <br><br>It's not same, it doesn't feel the same.<br><br>It's not SasuNaru. Stop projecting Naruto and Sasuke non-existant sexual tension on to them.<br><br>Hell, the movie most likely will never have any significant moments between the two aside of teamwork and regular crosswording.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Desperate as fuck.<br><br>Sorry fujo no cookie for you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly.<br><br>That's why I said he's not interested in future hokages or anything hokage related.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Fujo <br><br>I don't think you know what that word means.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do you fags think this series is going last into the next gen being married?</br></br>  <br>I don't think it will, but I'd be surprised if there was not some sort of romantic shit, slight or no, go on if it was made.</br>  <br><br>Are you sure sure you are not the closeted Fujo?<br><br>Yeah, you only ship them because one of them has a vagina, but you are truly using Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry as a basis for that ship when we already saw that they are simply not like their fathers.<br><br><br><br>I for one, don't want a "Naruto GT".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Holy shit, that's pathetic.<br><br>Damn man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well there probably will not be anything. Salad is too serious and Bolt is as well not unlike naruto who acted like a retard around girls he liked.</br></br>  <br>Being a shipperfag (fujo or not) itself is pathetic.<br><br>And you clearly enter in that category.<br><br>So stop get thag huge stick out of your ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  Daily reminder this movie is the last canon thing if it is not written by kishi<br><br>But we all know he is handing it off<br><br>You dont go through all this trouble to start a new cast and world build for nothing<br><br>It just will not be canon</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm an autist, and my friend won't tell me what gay anime he's watching, i can't stand it, does anybody know what anime this is from?  <br>That's Kuroko no Basket.</br>  <br>Sounds like trouble.</br>  Trouble  <br>Fuck you i know where you live</br>  <br>To Love-Ru.</br>  <br><br><br>Thank you very much people of /a/<br><br>Autismo out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wait a moment... isn't that outfit from eva from black cat?</br>  Show me your wisdom, /a/.                              <br>sasuga John</br>    facts  I don't know if this fits.<br>But I feel like I completely understand the deranged mind that came up with this.

Even after Dario was obviously grave robbing him and stole his ring, and even had a letter detailing how he died, he still trusts and believes in Dio when he has the exact same sickness.<br><br> Part 2 <br>Straizo becomes a vampire and tries to kill joseph even though he already knows the pillarmen are awakening and that he is just food to them. He was the one who woke them up killing the speedwagon people in the first place, but just goes out to kill Joseph. Even if he succeeded he knew the Pillarmen were coming and that he didn't have hamon anymore, so the fuck was the point?<br><br> Part 3 <br>They take public a private boat but not a private plane? seriously if they just took a private plan with just Abdul, jotaro, kakyoin, and Joseph, only The Sun could have possibly stopped them from reaching Cairo in 1-2 days.<br><br> part 4  <br>Josuke could have easily healed Aya like he did Okuyasu at the end and found out who Kira was, but he just let her die. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127714173#p127714173">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it's better than most of the drawn crap in this thread so far.</br>  <br> Josuke could have easily healed Aya like he did Okuyasu at the end and found out who Kira was, but he just let her die. <br><br>She was a god damn bomb.
